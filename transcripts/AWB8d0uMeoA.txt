322.00s: What's up outliers, happy Friday and happy episode 11?
331.24s: So it's not quite like Star Wars.
334.00s: Actually, I don't know how many Star Wars episodes there are, but for this, I can tell you
339.32s: that there are 11.
341.72s: And we will be wrapping up the outlier options trading basics stream.
348.80s: And I run this series maybe one or two times, a few times a year, typically.
354.00s: I timed this one to be, you know, towards the start of this year.
357.20s: We've been meeting every Friday for the last 11, essentially in a row.
362.76s: And the goal behind doing these is to help provide structure.
369.00s: The time that we spend together for one hour on Friday, the take a look through this stuff
374.56s: is in no way shape or form sufficient in order to learn enough.
380.48s: The quote unquote, be a option trader, but it provides you context and it gives you structure
389.56s: to learn to follow along on some of the key themes that go into making this a viable
398.56s: approach.
400.04s: Now, the goal for the session today is I want to run through a quick recap.
408.20s: And then I actually want to spend the majority of our time talking about where to go from
415.36s: here, how to take the stuff that we've discussed, that we've started to learn, and how to
422.16s: actually turn this into something usable for you longer term.
427.24s: So with that, I figured that we could start by just quickly rehashing what we've discussed.
436.80s: So we've discussed options 101, and I'm actually going to move you over to this screen and
442.52s: kind of combine both of these like this so that you can get a side by side view of the
451.80s: stuff that we have talked about and the stuff that I think you should consider integrating
461.52s: into your approach going forward.
463.80s: So here we have the beginning, the beginning started with a recap.
470.32s: We talked about things like the opportunity around options.
477.12s: And for those that don't remember, the opportunity around options effectively boils down to the
484.04s: fact that it provides a strategic investment.
489.40s: And the concept of a strategic investment is simple.
491.48s: It means that we can shape and form the idea into something very specific.
497.40s: It's not like a stock return.
499.88s: When you're buying or selling a stock, the stock can go up or the stock can go down.
504.56s: In this space, it's actually quite different.
508.60s: And you can structure things to fit a lot of different ideas.
513.44s: You can trade things that you think might go up a little bit, might go up a lot, might
517.60s: go up a lot, but over a longer term time frame that might go up and then might go down.
522.92s: That might have no stock change, but the volatility changes and so on and so forth.
527.40s: That's one of the beautiful things about options.
530.04s: The second thing is we talked about where the key market participants, who else is in
535.92s: this space, what they're doing, why they're doing it.
539.08s: The reason why this is important to you is because it is always prudent to understand
546.16s: to get in where you fit in.
549.28s: Understanding that there are areas of trading that retail has zero potential to compete, but
556.56s: that doesn't mean that we cannot find ways to make money in trading.
560.56s: And the other thing is when a retail trader is setting out to enter the markets, it's
570.72s: really, really important to understand the world that we're stepping into.
575.56s: I think a lot of traders step into the market with a lot of hopes and dreams.
580.40s: They have a lot of desires, but the reality is the market doesn't really care about any
585.40s: of that.
586.88s: And unfortunately, I think for a lot of traders, they run into a series of issues where
591.92s: they start to realize that fact the hard way through losing money, which is unfortunate.
597.72s: Episode two, we talked about buying versus selling options.
600.88s: Just literally just talked about the actual structural implications of them, but then also
605.80s: the different use cases for them, which is important because for a trader like me,
610.56s: I do both.
612.40s: And what I do in terms of buying or selling premium largely depends on what's going
616.72s: on in the market and what kind of risk that I want.
618.92s: There are absolutely traders out there that choose to either buy premium or sell premium.
624.48s: There are other ways to go about this.
626.72s: I typically think that the more adaptable you can be as a trader, the more consistent
634.76s: that you thus can be as a trader.
637.32s: You're not beholden to only being able to capture specific ideas when your one fastball
644.32s: pops up.
648.12s: Next up, I think this is still that standard issue I've shared with you guys before.
652.16s: We're like this thing locks up, but we'll be all right.
655.96s: Next up was pricing, understanding standard pricing models.
660.44s: And the key takeaway from this is that when we're pricing an option, we know everything
664.40s: except one thing, which is implied volatility.
667.76s: And the name of the game of options trading largely revolves around different expectations
673.60s: and ideas around volatility.
679.08s: After that, we got into trader organization.
683.98s: This matters because there's a lot happening here.
687.72s: And this is actually going to be one of the big things we're going to talk about with
690.60s: the path forward from here because you are not going to remember all this stuff.
696.08s: It is literally impossible to and the only way that you're going to effectively be able
701.96s: to iterate and create something for you that is successful longer term is if you actually
708.64s: have a good system in place to track what you're doing.
713.68s: After that, we talked about volatility and obviously all of the nuances, the different
718.04s: kinds, how it behaves, how it can be classified as its own asset class, which is pretty cool.
725.00s: Then we got into the Greeks.
726.92s: The Greeks are essentially the way that we measure how options move.
734.72s: And it gives us a lot of fidelity around the positions as we're building them.
740.76s: And we learn things like the Greeks are not static.
743.84s: They change.
744.88s: The Greeks have relationships with one another.
747.04s: There's multiple order Greeks.
748.24s: We can have Greeks that are specifically isolating effects with respect to price.
752.36s: We can have Greeks that isolate effects with respect to other Greeks.
756.36s: And this again gives us insight into how an option moves.
761.32s: Then we just had a general Q&A.
764.32s: In this one, we talked a little bit about the learning path for an options trader.
767.48s: How long it takes to get your feet under you, how to build strategies, those kinds of
771.80s: things.
773.28s: And more recently, the last couple, how to not only read and navigate an options chain,
780.84s: but also how to use it to identify underlying market information.
786.20s: Because there's a lot in there.
789.32s: And the options chains are actually very educational in that way.
792.92s: And for that, we got into building an option, how to actually start taking these ideas,
801.44s: to turn it into a trade, and then thus to take multiple trades into build a portfolio.
808.76s: That's what we've talked about over the last 10 episodes.
812.04s: So if you've made it through all of these episodes genuinely, you should give yourself
817.64s: some kudos, whether that's a pat on the back or whether that's just taking a moment and
821.52s: saying like, yeah, actually, that is, as you click through this, this is a lot of shit.
826.40s: It's a lot of stuff.
828.76s: You all know that when we go through these things, I try to strike a balance with how deep
833.48s: we go, but this is in no way like very superficial level.
837.20s: It's definitely a little deeper than that.
840.04s: So not just the scope of what we covered, but we covered some decent depth behind it all.
847.56s: So anytime that you go through a program like that, whether it's something as simple as
853.32s: it's just kind of a YouTube series with me or anything else, I think it is important
858.04s: to create the mental association with feeling satisfied after completing a task, but then
864.36s: also completing something that is genuinely helping you round out your skill set.
869.64s: Options trading can be really, really tricky in the sense that you can do a lot.
875.28s: And then after a while, it kind of feels like you're just like learning into the void.
879.32s: But that is part of the process in building and understanding.
882.96s: It's actually really funny.
883.96s: I had a podcast yesterday with somebody I respect in the field significantly, which is
889.08s: you and Sinclair.
891.20s: And that podcast will be out next week.
893.92s: And one of the things he mentioned during that podcast that resonated with me so strongly.
901.08s: And it's something that will probably make a lot of sense to you actually after I say
906.12s: it in terms of connecting the dots on a lot of things that I do.
911.52s: And one of the things you and talked about was the importance of building a baseline,
919.16s: meaning when you look at something and rather than looking at something, trying to identify
926.44s: what's wrong or what's missing, instead looking at it and just understanding what's normal.
936.08s: And then after you look at something so long and you understand what's normal, then
942.80s: it becomes really easy to spot things that are ab normal in some way.
947.80s: And you've heard me call this out a million different times on the different live streams
951.48s: that I do with you all.
953.40s: And I found it so interesting because as you and I was talking about that, I couldn't
960.52s: identify more with it.
962.36s: It's like such a big part of what I do.
967.60s: And I think it's something that an options trader needs to understand and adopt for themselves.
976.04s: Because the reality is for most options trader, traders out there like this ain't it.
983.88s: This is not going to be the thing for you.
986.36s: And the reason why that's the case is most people come into this with really bad expectations.
992.88s: They have a lot of things that they want to accomplish.
995.52s: They have a lot of hopes and dreams.
997.04s: They want something that returns better than the market.
1000.36s: That's not very volatile.
1001.84s: That never has a down month that doesn't require a lot of time or effort.
1005.44s: Right?
1006.44s: Like there's all these things that traders come into this thing wanting, which I don't
1009.56s: blame them.
1010.56s: I kind of want that too.
1013.00s: But it's not the reality of what we do as traders.
1016.80s: And again, it's a good thing because if it was able to be so, then it would be really
1021.60s: difficult to make decent money doing this because it would become increasingly flooded.
1027.76s: So all of that is to say a big part of your success as a trader is sticking around long
1034.40s: enough to build experience, to then create a baseline understanding of things, to then
1041.76s: start thinking of different ways that you can make money from deviations from baselines
1048.24s: or from standard market effects, but the only way you can really understand a market
1051.68s: effect is if you study and see it that it's there.
1056.24s: So that leads us now to where we sit today and the purpose of the episode today, which
1063.88s: is building a roadmap, thinking about where we go from here.
1070.88s: And I actually thought what better way to take all of this stuff and put it all together,
1080.28s: then to actually go through a little bit of an exercise with you all.
1083.68s: I actually had built a pretty robust final exam that I was going to give you guys.
1089.32s: And maybe I'll send it out at some point.
1091.00s: It's just a bunch of random questions or multiple choice so that it was going to be easier
1094.04s: to do on the stream.
1095.04s: So say they're thinking it's like any one of you can have chat GPT give yourself a quiz,
1101.56s: so I was thinking that's probably not the best use of our time together on the stream.
1107.36s: And I thought a better use of time together would be to work through all of this stuff
1113.88s: kind of in order and think about how we take these pieces and turn it into something bigger
1120.84s: than the sum of the individual parts.
1123.16s: So that's the game plan.
1124.44s: I want to walk through a roadmap forward for you, but before I could open the door for Thor.
1130.84s: Okay.
1139.84s: Let's get to it. Let me grab our drawing pad.
1150.28s: And let's catch this out, shall we?
1155.96s: So the way that I'm approaching this conversation is that we just finished a pretty basic and
1164.36s: generalized course that helps us understand the context of options.
1171.60s: Now the game is figuring out how to take this information and then to turn it into something
1176.56s: further.
1177.76s: Now we've already talked about all kinds of things, the outlier strategy process, the
1183.04s: outlier trade process, right?
1184.68s: Like you're familiar with all of these core concepts, which is great.
1190.68s: But that means now we need to actually begin applying things in a meaningful way.
1199.60s: So what is, and I would like you to throw this in the chat, what is the number one most
1208.52s: important thing to you as a trader?
1214.64s: This is above everything.
1219.28s: And my guess is a bunch of you are going to get it wrong.
1222.40s: And it's not like wrong, wrong.
1223.56s: It's like semi wrong.
1227.04s: What do you think?
1230.60s: What is your first, you were very first priority as a trader.
1244.64s: Anybody?
1251.64s: Consistency of results.
1256.84s: Nope.
1257.84s: Lauren says mechanics.
1258.84s: Nope.
1259.84s: Tommy says goals.
1261.84s: Nope.
1262.84s: Jordan says returns.
1264.92s: That's the closest.
1266.72s: Alberto says having fun.
1268.16s: We know that's not correct.
1270.20s: That basis increases our wealth.
1271.60s: That's also close.
1273.68s: Paul says get a good return for the risk.
1275.60s: That's close.
1276.60s: Her.
1277.60s: Juicy bot says managing minimizing risk.
1280.12s: That's not it.
1281.64s: Tommy says how to make money getting warmer.
1284.88s: Nate says protect capital.
1286.44s: That is absolutely not the case.
1289.56s: You can protect your capital much easier ways than going into the stock market.
1294.00s: I'm much better off protecting my capital by putting it into a CD.
1298.76s: It's easy to protect the capital.
1303.92s: The things in here that you guys were talking about that were close.
1307.88s: Were things like returns, things like increase our wealth, good return for the risk.
1316.16s: Those are closest.
1320.72s: Tommy says how much money need to make and what time frame.
1324.16s: This more of like a planning consideration.
1326.32s: That's not your number one priority.
1328.92s: Haters says taking risk.
1331.88s: That's not it.
1333.88s: Closer, but still not it.
1336.04s: Think of it this way.
1338.96s: If we.
1342.04s: Wanted to just make money.
1345.20s: We can make money by buying and holding an index ETF.
1352.72s: So through the through the approach of trading, we're trying to do more than that.
1359.24s: Now it doesn't necessarily mean that we're trying to do more in the sense of getting better
1362.28s: returns all the time.
1363.60s: You can trade to try to be more consistent, to try to have less drawdown, to have less
1367.92s: volatility.
1368.92s: Like there's other things that you can trade for.
1372.44s: It's not always beating the market.
1375.64s: But there is a absolutely essential function that needs to be in place in order to do anything
1387.08s: as a trader.
1389.44s: It's a four letter word.
1405.20s: Your number one priority as a trader is edge without edge literally nothing else you
1421.92s: do as a trader matters.
1426.68s: You can have the best best risk control.
1430.96s: If you have great risk control and no edge, you will simply lose money in a controlled
1439.64s: way.
1441.96s: That's not good.
1444.16s: You can have the best capital protection model out there.
1451.00s: You could protect your capital in the best way possible.
1456.16s: It's great to have protected capital, but that makes you no money.
1462.64s: This is the entire focus for a new trader.
1470.24s: He's developing edge.
1473.72s: There are a lot of ways to approach this problem set.
1478.60s: As we go through this entire list of things, some of the things in here are designed to
1489.12s: directly support edge.
1493.60s: Some of the things in here are designed to help us capitalize on edge or maintain our
1501.28s: ability to extract an edge.
1506.68s: But everything that you do as a trader, it must incorporate some sort of edge.
1516.00s: Whether your ultimate goal is to maximize the risk to reward that you're taking.
1522.24s: Whether your goal is to consistently profit as a trader.
1526.32s: Whether your goal is to try and have some sort of income generation component to what you're
1534.08s: doing.
1535.08s: The edge is what is required in all of those scenarios universally, period, full stop.
1542.16s: This is the focus.
1545.12s: Now that being said, in order to get and build an edge, this is where the uncomfortable
1555.72s: reality enters the equation because we now have to do hard work.
1563.08s: There is no fast, easy way to a consistent edge.
1569.64s: And if we reflect back onto something like this, which you've seen before, the outlier
1579.84s: strategy process, notice the first thing that's in here, the profit mechanism.
1590.56s: This is how you are going to make money with whatever it is you're trying to do.
1598.68s: So this is your edge, whatever the edge ultimately is that you're attempting to extract.
1606.76s: One of the things I would encourage you to think away from is sometimes people will think
1614.32s: that edge is some sort of market outperformance.
1620.84s: And there's an argument, by the way, depending on the context to be made for that for sure.
1626.60s: But in the context of a standard trader that's looking to accomplish a set of goals, whatever
1632.88s: those set of goals are, edge is how you're going to realize your performance towards those
1640.88s: goals.
1643.04s: So then we know that this is our focus.
1647.12s: We have got to create an edge.
1651.08s: The second priority, another exceedingly unsexy concept, organization.
1666.72s: So this is beyond the documentation and all that stuff.
1670.60s: It's going to be your trading plan, your trading log, yada, yada, yada.
1674.48s: But in terms of organization, the other things I bucket into this are having defined goals.
1684.52s: It's being organized not only as a trader in the activity of trading, but being organized
1691.00s: as a trader, as a human being that's doing something.
1695.80s: So in order to have any chance of success as a trader, we need to very clearly articulate
1703.00s: what we're attempting to undergo, why we're attempting to do this.
1707.68s: And here's the fun fact.
1710.20s: If traders actually spent time up front defining what their goals are and not just defining
1718.96s: a goal in the context of like, oh, I would like this.
1722.88s: Not that at all.
1723.88s: That's bullshit.
1724.88s: That's what you'd like defining goals in the context of I think this is in the realm
1731.40s: of possibility.
1733.40s: And then taking time to vet it because I cannot tell you how many times we go through
1740.92s: something like Reddit or just general conversations I have from people DMing me or emailing me,
1748.00s: asking things like, hey, Eric, is 1% per week reasonable?
1755.64s: 1% per week sounds so reasonable.
1761.36s: You have a $100,000 account.
1767.64s: All you're trying to do is make 1% per week.
1773.20s: That seems like somebody that's not being overly aggressive.
1779.60s: That's trying to grow their account slowly.
1783.52s: And then if you annualize that return, does anybody know what the annualized return on 1%
1789.08s: per week is?
1792.68s: Obviously, you could do the math, but without doing the math.
1798.40s: I'm wondering if anybody just knows.
1801.84s: It's like almost 70%.
1811.56s: I want to say it's like 67, 68, 69.
1814.48s: It's like something in the 60s.
1817.64s: So it's high 60s.
1820.44s: So it's like 70% per year is what this person is asking to do.
1826.24s: This is the equivalent of, I used to jitsu a lot.
1831.32s: I don't think a lot of you are probably jitsu players.
1833.64s: So I think the analogies probably go off.
1837.64s: What's a better, most commonly known sport?
1841.16s: I mean, maybe in the US football, I hate football or maybe soccer, but I don't know anything
1846.64s: about soccer either.
1847.64s: I guess the way to think about it is back to Jiu-Jitsu is if this is your expectation,
1859.16s: this is the same as being brand new at a sport and genuinely thinking that you are going
1864.96s: to not only compete but outperform most of the top performers if not all of them.
1872.20s: Like that's literally what this is.
1875.48s: And I don't necessarily think that this always comes from greed.
1880.92s: I really don't.
1882.44s: I think this often comes from genuinely not taking the time to clearly define your goals
1888.20s: and vet them to even see if this shit is realistic.
1892.48s: Because the paradigm of a standard trader is they're so concerned with what they want,
1898.00s: with what they hope that they totally forget that that doesn't actually matter to the
1905.16s: markets.
1906.24s: Getting used to interacting with the system that is completely agnostic towards your existence
1911.56s: is super important.
1912.56s: That's actually one of the beautiful things about the military.
1917.52s: Is the military teaches you early on that it's really not about you or your preferences.
1924.60s: It's always going to be for the greater good.
1926.16s: I'm just offering this as a general mindset for those that might be veterans or military
1932.08s: people because you already have a leg up when it comes to understanding the fact that
1936.64s: you might have your preferences, but your preferences ultimately don't really matter in the Marine
1942.08s: Corps.
1943.08s: We always say needs of the Corps matter more.
1945.48s: As a trader, there's nothing wrong with defining your goals and having aggressive goals.
1950.84s: I think aggressive goals are fine, but I will remind you in my humble opinion, I think
1956.60s: for the first two years, greater than 0% return is perfect.
1969.64s: Because lame seems like why are we doing this?
1973.20s: Why even bother?
1974.40s: Why even trade if all I'm trying to do is be greater than 0?
1981.32s: The reason is because as a new trader, there is just about nothing.
1988.12s: You are going to do in the first three years that is actually going to matter with respect
1995.80s: to meaningfully growing your account.
2000.32s: It is what it is.
2001.32s: It over it.
2002.32s: The reality is, for your first few years of trading, you are actually focusing on building
2010.24s: a sustainable skill set.
2013.28s: You're focusing on things like creating an effective process to learn, to track what you're
2020.72s: doing.
2022.56s: Because you go back to what I said in the beginning, a big part of becoming an expert at anything
2029.56s: is developing experience.
2031.72s: You cannot develop any experience in trading if you blow up your account trying to do things
2037.60s: that you literally do not have neither the context nor the skill set to produce.
2045.44s: This is one of the instances where I actually think the notion of if you aim low enough,
2051.96s: you might be able to hit it is fully applicable.
2056.44s: This is accepting the fact that slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
2064.08s: What that means is, and again, we use this in the military, where a lot of times, if you're
2068.48s: trying to go through some sort of fine motor movement when you're in a high stress scenario,
2074.48s: your movements become really erratic, jagged, very not smooth.
2078.88s: And even though it feels like you're moving super, super fast, like maybe during a reload,
2084.08s: you're actually slowing down because you're so jagged in your movements.
2089.12s: So by deliberately slowing your movements down, which seems in feels like you're moving
2094.72s: slower than when you're really trying to move super fast, you actually ultimately move
2099.24s: faster because things are smoother.
2102.56s: Then trading the exact same concept applies.
2107.76s: If in your first few years you're focusing on good, solid fundamentals of trading, building
2112.96s: the skill set, which is what we're about to go into, then you are building the foundation
2118.04s: to then actually achieve returns.
2122.24s: And if you don't like this and if what I'm saying upsets you, that's actually good because
2127.32s: it means you're learning something, but the second thing it means you need to reconcile
2132.04s: with yourself.
2132.96s: If this is the thing for you, because if we talk about why do so many traders fail,
2139.28s: it is not because trading is all that difficult.
2142.08s: It really is not.
2144.36s: It's difficult in the sense that it requires doing a lot of things and at least being decent
2149.48s: at most of them, but it's not difficult in the sense that you have to have specific
2157.44s: personal attributes in order to stand a chance at being successful at this.
2162.56s: It doesn't matter if you were born six foot tall or seven foot tall, trading doesn't
2168.52s: care about any of that stuff.
2170.28s: It cares about things like your work ethic, how adaptable are you, how persistent are
2176.40s: you, things like that.
2178.08s: So that's what I mean, that it's not that difficult because anybody that applies a concerted
2183.80s: effort towards this can absolutely find something that generally works at least moderately
2191.56s: well if they apply the right methodology, which includes a lot of iterative learning.
2199.40s: So now that we have the beginning concepts identified, now is when we actually get into
2208.48s: the next steps, how do we take this list of things, this list of things that we learned
2215.44s: in how do we turn it into something that we can actually monetize, make money.
2222.12s: We already know the first thing is edge.
2225.92s: So in order to even understand anything about edge or what edge can look like, step one
2233.72s: here, and this is something I think makes sense literally for all of you, for at least
2240.68s: the next three months.
2248.56s: For three months.
2252.56s: Monitor the market and take notes.
2266.48s: Again, it seems so simple, it seems so stupid.
2272.72s: And just like you saw in the karate kid, when Mr. Miyagi had the dude, I forgot the
2277.62s: dude's name, do in the wax on, wax off repeatedly, over and over and over again.
2285.46s: It seems useless.
2287.06s: It seems not applicable to what you might be trying to do, whereas this I'm actually giving
2291.26s: you something directly, at least in the realm of what you're trying to do.
2295.66s: The reason why those kinds of things are so useful is again, because they're building
2301.98s: a base understanding of something, they're building a completely solid foundational core.
2312.54s: So in the case of wax on wax off, it's getting the movements right, doing it over and over
2317.38s: again until it becomes muscle memory, taking that to a trading lens by simply monitoring
2323.42s: the markets meaningfully.
2325.94s: When I say monitor the markets meaningfully, this isn't just randomly flipping through
2330.98s: things and just kind of haphazardly seeing what you see.
2335.22s: This is actually developing an approach to looking at markets and analyzing markets.
2341.90s: And as you probably guess, I have a video that I can share with you that walks through
2350.30s: a process to actually analyze markets.
2354.86s: It's the video that I just dropped in there.
2357.62s: And the video is titled How I Analyze the Stock Market to Build Ideas.
2364.54s: The reason why I insist on you taking notes is because there is a well studied and documented
2374.22s: effect that you learn better by writing things down.
2379.10s: That's it.
2380.10s: It's not that you have to have this big data source that you're going to go back and
2383.26s: look through.
2384.26s: The entire concept here is we're starting to build an understanding of what's normal,
2388.90s: what's abnormal.
2392.78s: This can be done during market close.
2395.22s: You don't have to do this during the day sitting there just staring at the market, seeing
2399.14s: what's happened.
2400.74s: You can do it at the end of the day and you can just see what you see and take notes on
2405.34s: it.
2406.34s: You should be very deliberate.
2407.34s: What we're doing here is we're building context.
2409.94s: And three months, by the way, is just a snapshot.
2412.18s: This is a super short amount of time.
2415.18s: The next thing is step two, which I believe occurs simultaneously in conjunction with
2425.10s: step one.
2426.90s: And here, I think you pay for trade ideas.
2439.62s: Step three, also during this very same three months.
2450.34s: We build a trade log and trade plan.
2452.10s: That's really the only way you pay for trade ideas is to have a supporting trade log.
2457.34s: Here's what's happening during these first steps.
2461.14s: We're creating market context.
2464.26s: We're starting to throw ideas out and we're looking at the performance.
2468.74s: This is not going through back testing.
2471.82s: This again, this here is not because any of these ideas are probably going to work.
2479.58s: The reality is they're probably not going to work and that you need to see that.
2485.06s: The other thing is the main takeaway from step two here is actually the same as step
2490.38s: one.
2491.38s: It's building context.
2493.54s: Now during this time frame though, we are starting to try and build an approach to placing
2501.22s: trades.
2502.22s: And again, this is where something like the outlier trade process is relevant.
2513.30s: So I'll grab the video for that for you.
2522.06s: Here.
2526.86s: So during this, you're not worrying about back testing ideas.
2532.22s: You're not worrying about if the idea is good.
2537.06s: I will remind you just about everything you come up with.
2541.78s: Your first two years of trading is probably hot garbage.
2546.38s: That's just the facts.
2548.38s: And again, that's not like something that you should be like, wow, that's crazy.
2551.98s: Why would you say that or how could it take that long?
2554.34s: Again, think about any other skill based activity you've ever done in your life.
2561.90s: How good do you get in the first year?
2565.82s: Obviously, from where you start, you grow exponentially.
2571.22s: But then if you look back at where you were one year into that activity compared to where
2577.82s: you might be now 10 years down the line from there, you probably think of it as like,
2583.98s: shit, I didn't know anything.
2585.38s: It's actually kind of embarrassing.
2587.50s: It's the same idea here.
2589.22s: We are not even worried about trying to come up with grand ideas because we do not have
2595.70s: the context yet.
2599.06s: Ben says, why do that?
2601.10s: Why not test the idea first to prove it's at least theoretically possible?
2604.14s: It's a great question.
2605.38s: It's because you have no idea what the test for at this point.
2608.42s: For a trader that's been in the market for X period of time, that is, meaning when I say
2614.46s: X period, I mean probably sub two years, you're not in a point to even, you don't even know
2620.06s: how to back test.
2621.22s: You don't even know what to look for.
2623.58s: If you're a trader that is again in that window, you are not familiar with the concepts
2629.14s: like adverse selection.
2631.22s: You don't know about confirmation bias.
2633.46s: You don't know about sampling error.
2635.18s: You probably don't know about sample distributions and sample out of sample.
2638.94s: All of these things have to be done and understood deeply before you even attempt to crack open
2644.86s: a back test.
2646.34s: Because if you don't, then all you're doing is reaffirming terrible habits.
2652.14s: So again, the main thing to answer Ben's question on this one is all you're doing is
2657.78s: gaining context.
2659.42s: You're not actually trying to trade these great ideas.
2662.34s: Everything that you're trading in this is probably going to get thrown out.
2665.14s: This is just so that you can look at the markets and just so that you can be engaged with
2670.10s: your interaction with the markets while you're learning.
2672.22s: That's exactly what this is.
2673.98s: This is not the actually built trade ideas because a trader at this point is not prepared.
2679.62s: They're not prepared in any way.
2682.18s: It's a come up with good trade ideas.
2687.22s: Pepe said TA should also be considered as a must.
2691.22s: No.
2692.22s: Definitely not.
2694.02s: You can trade, you literally can trade an entire career with zero technical analysis
2698.94s: if you're so inclined.
2700.54s: If you're an options trader genuinely, there are different approaches that one could easily
2707.46s: argue.
2709.58s: The probabilities of movement are already generally accurately reflected in a chart, which
2715.86s: air go are already going to be baked into an options chain.
2719.70s: So it depends on your approach.
2721.66s: It depends on your profit mechanism, but I wouldn't consider it a must.
2725.26s: I think it's a good idea personally.
2726.78s: I think it makes sense.
2728.70s: But I do not think that it's a must.
2732.70s: But that does move us into step four.
2752.50s: In analysis process, here, all we're doing is trying to create a standardized process
2763.94s: with respect to how we conduct analysis.
2768.02s: So this is not going to be always check the six month chart, the two month chart, the
2774.42s: one month chart.
2775.42s: It's not that at all.
2777.06s: We're thinking much higher process level here.
2780.90s: We're thinking economy, stock market, these two are to develop baseline context.
2800.82s: Then after we get the baseline context process down, then we can start outlining trade analysis.
2810.70s: Now the trade analysis in this context again is not for a specific strategy.
2815.38s: It's the main muscle movements that regardless of what strategy we're doing needs to happen.
2823.06s: So the trade analysis for a zero DTE strategy is going to look different than if I'm trying
2829.58s: to trade a ratio called the Agnolum Palantir for a longer term idea.
2833.78s: However, that being said, it does not mean that the major steps that I take in a zero DTE
2840.90s: process do not apply to what I'm looking at the ratio called the Agnolum Palantir.
2847.26s: So the trade analysis process for me is you guys know always starts with the portfolio,
2855.70s: understanding the portfolio and creating alignment with this base context.
2861.66s: This is always going to happen first.
2863.78s: So before I ever analyze an individual trade, I'm doing these things every single time.
2870.22s: Then I can start thinking about analysis tools.
2879.02s: So in here are things like for technical analysis, how do you think you're going to conduct
2884.30s: it broadly?
2885.30s: Again, this is not specific to a strategy yet.
2888.62s: This is us trying to create a general approach to analyzing an individual trade.
2896.50s: What are the data points we think we might use we might look at?
2902.42s: This here I think essentially takes up the first six months like all of these steps combined,
2910.74s: the timeline here, probably like the first six months of a general trader's cycle.
2919.62s: From here is when we get into the heart of the work.
2926.06s: Oh, duh.
2929.54s: I'm so stupid.
2930.74s: I forgot that I'm writing with this pen.
2933.58s: I have to clear this off.
2935.26s: So if there's anything on there that you want, make sure you grab it.
2938.70s: I have to clear it off because this is in the way.
2944.18s: So the next step, which I already forgot what step around was at step five.
2969.70s: Now that we have some baseline stock market understanding, we have an idea we've been logging
2978.62s: stock market movements for a few months.
2981.62s: We've developed a general, a general outline for a trading plan, a trading log.
2989.46s: We've started testing some random trading ideas, realizing most of them suck.
2994.58s: Some of them make money.
2996.10s: There's a really low confidence interval when we put on the trades.
2999.58s: There's very low predictive value in terms of whether or not we think we're actually going
3003.66s: to make money or not.
3005.34s: All of those things will happen in the first steps leading into this.
3010.62s: Then once we get to this, we're actually saying, I'm going to take this seriously.
3018.42s: At this point, this comes into play, the outlier strategy process.
3030.46s: This is exactly where you employ this framework or whatever framework you have that you prefer
3039.86s: at this point.
3042.98s: We've already reviewed all of this.
3044.66s: You're familiar with all of this.
3047.06s: But this is where you need to actually go and find profit mechanisms that you can trade.
3057.26s: You have to understand them in depth.
3061.26s: You have to quantify them, qualify them.
3065.10s: You have to then start attaching some of those signals that you found earlier that you're
3070.14s: tinkering with and trying to align those signals with the profit mechanism to see if you
3077.50s: can actually use those signals to identify the profit mechanism.
3081.74s: From there, you can start playing with what kind of options structures might fit.
3087.18s: Notice again, I will continue to reiterate this point every single time we look at this.
3091.58s: Notice how this is about trading options.
3094.42s: Notice how I don't say shit about options until the third step in this process related
3104.68s: and about specifically trading options.
3108.30s: Options aren't mentioned until the third step.
3111.78s: What does that tell you?
3113.10s: It tells you that options are simply a vector to capitalize or to extract or to monetize
3122.38s: an idea.
3124.02s: But you need the idea.
3126.46s: There is no baked in option anything that's automatically just going to provide you profit.
3133.46s: It doesn't exist.
3136.02s: You have to have a profit mechanism.
3138.46s: You have to have some sort of approach to identifying, quantifying, qualifying the profit mechanism.
3144.86s: And then you can worry about what structures matter.
3149.46s: The overwhelming majority of options traders, they get stuck worrying if they're going to
3154.54s: buy five DTE options or seven DTE options to trade this idea.
3160.10s: And the reality is both of them are probably going to lose money in the long run.
3164.74s: We're optimizing for the wrong thing.
3166.82s: We have the cart so far in front of the horse, you can't even see it.
3170.82s: So this step five is probably, I would argue, the next 12 to 18 months.
3178.86s: And over this 12 to 18 months, you might find three to four profit mechanisms like good
3193.02s: ones.
3194.90s: You might find three to four.
3200.50s: As always, some people might take longer and find more.
3204.42s: Some people might find more in shorter time.
3206.62s: I'm just trying to give you some context, some ideas from somebody who's gone through
3211.94s: all of this and somebody who's helped other people navigate through all of this.
3216.42s: This is what I spent a lot of time with the people that are in the coaching stuff and
3220.10s: in the discord.
3221.74s: And it can be really frustrating because a lot of the times it feels like it's like, man,
3226.02s: this just takes kind of like a lot of time.
3228.66s: And I don't really feel like I'm learning as fast as I want.
3232.74s: The unfortunate reality is we can only move at the pace of time.
3240.26s: And time in markets is how we develop experience.
3246.50s: So some of it is based on our ability to build that context to then come up with ideas.
3254.54s: So after step five, this becomes easier now.
3262.06s: So step six strategy, dev, import folio, use or implementation.
3279.98s: Now strategy development in this context is taking this step here for these three to
3291.34s: four profit mechanisms.
3294.10s: And it's making sure that they then work together at the portfolio level.
3300.14s: So here's what I'm talking about in this step.
3305.38s: Let me move this.
3309.42s: And I think this would be clear.
3313.38s: If we have a $100,000 portfolio, our goal is 15% per year.
3325.46s: We already know that we want to minimize total drawdown.
3330.30s: So drawdown will be set at 35%.
3337.66s: We don't want to draw our portfolio down more than 35%.
3343.02s: We also know that we have a standard W2 job.
3346.46s: And we can only look at the market the last trading hour, the first trading hour, first
3351.46s: hour.
3352.86s: And this isn't for the full hour.
3354.94s: This is just sometime during the first hour and last hour.
3364.38s: So we have our goal.
3367.18s: We have our risk parameter.
3369.18s: We have some of the qualitative overlay that is just a fact of our life that we have to
3375.06s: account for.
3376.74s: So now as we go through these three to four profit mechanisms, if you found one profit
3381.50s: mechanism that is following Intraday VWOP for an index, guess what?
3399.14s: This doesn't matter.
3400.66s: This doesn't fit this.
3405.34s: We can't do this.
3407.46s: So even though we might have found a viable profit mechanism that makes sense and looks
3411.66s: good, it doesn't matter in this context.
3414.90s: Now this might lead somebody to say, well, Eric, Eric, why wouldn't we first try to define
3426.50s: our portfolio use case and then go find edge that fits it?
3434.34s: It's a great question.
3438.02s: Does anybody have a guess why it's this way?
3443.34s: And anybody that knows me knows that I care a lot about efficiency and I care a lot about
3449.30s: rock solid process.
3450.62s: So there's a reason.
3453.38s: Anybody have an idea what that reason is?
3465.70s: Ben says IDK I would ask why is well, and it's a good question.
3469.14s: It's a very natural question.
3470.50s: So I'm glad that you would ask that.
3473.90s: But as you might guess, there is a reason.
3477.86s: Does anybody have a guess as to what the reason might be?
3489.30s: None.
3492.50s: Because it consumes time.
3494.02s: No, that's a good guess.
3496.14s: I mean, realistically, arguably, the step five and step six here would consume more
3502.38s: time, wouldn't it?
3504.70s: Something that we just go try to find edge and then we try to fit stuff in the portfolio.
3511.14s: So also counter to Pallows point, it actually is less efficient in a way.
3519.94s: Ben says overall exposure to see different things.
3522.06s: That's definitely part of it.
3526.10s: The reality is for a new trader finding any edge, any edge is a tall enough task.
3542.06s: So again, taking it back to a sports analogy, this is like what Gordon Ryan does in Jiu-Jitsu,
3552.74s: where as he's competing with world-class athletes, he'll have a letter that he signs before
3562.18s: the match and he says how he's going to submit his world-class opponent before the match
3570.18s: starts, which for those that don't have context of Jiu-Jitsu, even finishing somebody, meaning
3575.86s: actually getting a definitive submission, is difficult.
3578.82s: A lot of them just go by time and points.
3582.14s: So the fact that not only is he so confident in the submission, but he's also picking
3588.14s: what he's going to do is quite literally an elite level move.
3595.42s: This is the same, a new options trader that has less than five years in the market, especially
3603.30s: in this case, less than three years in the market, coming in and saying not only am I going
3609.70s: to find an edge that I like, but I'm going to be able to find an edge that fits all of
3617.86s: my parameters.
3620.14s: Let me go find that.
3622.14s: It's beyond arrogant.
3623.74s: It's beyond misguided.
3625.94s: The probability of an actual new options trader finding an edge literally at all, in
3634.86s: case you need a reminder, is low.
3639.18s: It's very low.
3643.18s: If we take a look at what is the probability of a regular options trader finding an edge,
3651.82s: it's exceedingly low.
3654.66s: So that's why this is a scenario where we are knowingly doing something that's slightly
3662.26s: suboptimal because of the landscape and because of the reality of what we're doing.
3668.74s: This is exactly why.
3670.06s: If a new options trader can find any edge, that is an incredible start.
3677.58s: It's literally an incredible start.
3680.42s: So whether that edge can be traded during market hours when you're able to get to the markets
3685.22s: or anything, it doesn't even matter yet.
3687.62s: The fact that you can even find it is huge because if you're able to actually genuinely
3694.38s: find a true edge that you can extract, that you can monetize over time, then you can
3700.98s: absolutely become more selective.
3705.82s: Paul says, how do you know that you've found an edge?
3708.14s: That's an absolutely great question.
3710.74s: And the funny answer to that is the way that you know you've found an edge is when you
3715.30s: don't have to ask anymore, which I know sounds kind of silly, but it is the exact truth.
3721.42s: Once you are onto something that you can consistently see results of some sort with some sort
3727.22s: of predictive value that is based on something logical, then you know that you're probably
3735.38s: onto something and you'll see it start to materialize.
3739.10s: Now to talk about this from a general perspective, because Paulo also in his question brings
3747.34s: up a really important point, which is that of discerning return path from just Appen
3754.64s: Stamps, part of that again comes from this process.
3763.98s: By actually defining the market effect and then doing research on that market effect.
3772.98s: So for example, a well-known market effect is variances premiums.
3776.94s: You've heard me talk about a million times because it is actually a defined market effect
3781.06s: that we know is there reliably.
3783.42s: Sick.
3784.58s: Sick story, bro.
3786.70s: But I know then because this is something that is well researched, it's documented.
3792.30s: I can look at studies about it.
3793.98s: I can see it in the market to confirm what I'm seeing.
3799.46s: Right.
3800.46s: Then I already know I'm kind of off to a good start.
3804.02s: I already know that I'm looking at something that's based on something.
3809.38s: So that's exactly how two things come into play.
3814.58s: The first thing is finding something that we actually can even identify that we're going
3821.70s: down the right path in the beginning and then building off of that.
3826.58s: That's exactly how if I were a new trader trying to identify in edge in the beginning,
3833.54s: that's exactly what I would do is I would start with something that probably knowingly
3838.22s: doesn't have a ton of edge, but it has something there and it's based on a well-documented
3844.78s: market effect that I know exists for a reason and it's logical and then trying to find
3849.82s: ways to monetize that.
3854.38s: That's the exact way I would start.
3857.58s: Now to just put a bow on this and then happily turn it into just an open Q&A for the next
3864.82s: 15-20 minutes.
3868.10s: This, it's not a lot of steps, but sitting down and actually doing this work is
3880.50s: absolutely what is required.
3883.06s: If somebody is unwilling to do this work, then the probability of you being a successful
3888.62s: trader long-term is about zero.
3891.90s: If you are willing to do this work, it is highly, genuinely, highly probable that you
3897.74s: will find something.
3899.38s: It doesn't necessarily mean that you'll hit your portfolio goals.
3902.30s: It doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to smash the S&P 500 every year.
3906.02s: It all depends on what you find and how adept you are at employing it, but the overwhelming
3912.50s: probabilities you'll find something because there's a lot of stuff out there that exists
3916.34s: right now that we know exists that's well studied and documented.
3920.62s: If again, you start with something like that as your base, then you can very easily iterate
3927.58s: that into something more meaningful over time as you're exploring other ideas.
3933.22s: In my opinion, this is the first two years for a new options trader.
3940.06s: There's a lot of iterative learning going on during this time frame, continuing to try
3945.02s: to read new books, expand your general knowledge base.
3949.34s: There's using things like ChatGPT to help make sure that it's quizzing you so that you're
3954.70s: continuing to validate your knowledge.
3956.82s: There's using those external audits or AARs.
3960.38s: The discord that's free to join for everybody is a great place to do this.
3964.58s: You can literally ask somebody in their hey, can you just quiz me on options?
3970.02s: Just literally, ask a few questions.
3971.86s: That's useful for everybody.
3973.98s: But there's no reason to grossly overcomplicate the beginning stages for an options trader
3981.66s: because there's already enough going on that you have to tangle with.
3985.78s: So there's the next 24 months for anybody that's been a part of the series so far.
3994.18s: So before we turn to just open Q&A, I do want to say for those that actually stuck out
4000.10s: the whole thing from me to you, solid job.
4003.38s: There's a lot to do here.
4004.74s: Your work literally is just starting, but I think that this will provide a usable foundation.
4011.90s: And my hope for doing these sessions is not just to give you a video to watch, but to
4019.66s: give you an honest, earnest take on trading, what it takes to be successful and to try
4027.82s: to set you down the right path.
4030.06s: I think sometimes some of the things that I say, they're a little bit disheartening also
4035.86s: to me because I don't want to sound like I'm trying to dissuade anybody from trying to
4040.14s: trade.
4041.14s: I think it's good for everybody to at least try.
4044.90s: But I think what's more damaging is making it seem easier than it is or just covering over
4054.90s: the rough spots to make it more approachable.
4058.82s: And I think that that hurts people because the majority of people that start trading options
4063.94s: are the exact group of people that typically don't have a bunch of money to lose because
4068.14s: I know that that's exactly why I started trading options because I did not have money
4072.22s: and I was trying to figure out how to make money.
4074.70s: So that's my TED Talk.
4076.62s: I hope that the series is good for you.
4079.50s: I do plan to run another one of these at some point throughout the rest of the year,
4084.86s: maybe one or two more.
4086.98s: And we will absolutely dive into another one in the future.
4092.54s: But I'll turn it over to just a general Q&A throw anything you want in the chat.
4097.66s: I will happily roll through those.
4100.10s: I'm going to go grab the manager, Thor just finished his dinner, so I'll grab him and
4104.30s: then we'll get to it.
4116.98s: The champ is here.
4124.98s: The champ is here.
4126.58s: He's straight up smelling like dinner.
4129.06s: Look, you guys can see his eyes.
4130.78s: There's actually light enough for reflection.
4135.82s: So if you guys have any, oh, and now he's tired.
4140.34s: He's going to recharge before we go for our walk later.
4143.78s: So he's ready to rock and roll.
4153.46s: Oliver says, do you think Elon will exceed 30 children?
4155.98s: How many kids does he have right now?
4158.42s: I actually don't know how many he has, but it wouldn't surprise me.
4164.10s: I do think that because I really believe that he believes that there's a significant
4169.86s: imperative for him to do that.
4173.38s: So I absolutely can see it.
4176.94s: Reese says, it might have been hung up on the word, but what would you say is your edge,
4180.78s: not trying to copy yours just seem hard to define.
4183.82s: So I think you can, there isn't like what is your edge Eric or what is your edge Reese.
4194.22s: I have different strategies that have edge.
4199.62s: So one of my strategies that has edge is the coverage strangle as I've built it.
4205.86s: And it's something that reliably creates profit and it typically beats the underlying
4211.66s: index.
4213.22s: So it still has down years, right?
4215.82s: So it's not again, edge isn't something that's nipotent or always, but the strategy in
4223.66s: the long run absolutely yields edge, the variance for premiums that I play in index volatility
4230.86s: has edge.
4232.50s: The earnings place that I trade has edge, my pattern recognition when I'm trading breakout
4239.70s: setups or breakdown setups has edge.
4243.54s: So these like these different approaches, it's the approach itself that has edge.
4249.62s: I wouldn't think of like what is your edge as a person or as a trader.
4254.22s: I would think it's, it's a little more specific to the strategy than that.
4261.78s: The reality is, is like as a trader, you and Aitley have to get a lot of things right.
4266.46s: And that's just an expectation.
4268.02s: It doesn't lead to profit, right?
4270.46s: You'll hear things like discipline, risk management, those kinds of things.
4275.42s: And you have to have those like there's no debate.
4278.78s: You have to have those.
4280.42s: But even if you have those, it doesn't necessarily mean that you make money.
4284.38s: So the way to think about it is that like as a trader, there's a bunch of things you
4288.18s: have to do that are just base expectations.
4291.18s: And then what you do beyond that is really the pursuit of edge.
4297.82s: Policies, how do you go about back tests?
4299.98s: It's a good question.
4301.66s: The way that I go about back tests is by first looking at the market and trying to come
4309.70s: up with different ideas based on things that I see or things that I think might logically
4315.34s: make money.
4317.06s: So one of the examples is post earnings announcement drift.
4323.38s: Before I knew that that was a thing, I had already been trading it for a while.
4330.90s: I had come across it and it was an effect that I could see following an earnings release.
4337.22s: I didn't have it qualified quite the same is a lot of the studies do.
4342.78s: I had a different criteria that I would use.
4345.78s: But what I do is look at the market and based on what I see, I try to find things that
4351.74s: I think like hmm.
4352.90s: I wonder if I can make money off of that.
4355.74s: And then I will then start to develop the structure for what I need to have in order to
4363.66s: be able to validate or invalidate the idea.
4367.18s: So the purpose of back testing for me is I'm going to grab a relevant data source of
4376.02s: whatever it is that I'm trying to look at.
4378.30s: So in that case, I'm going to have to find the names that I would trade earnings.
4382.90s: And I need to get their price performance details around earnings and then the earnings details
4387.34s: around, you know, the specific duration.
4390.66s: And then I would start programming it.
4393.14s: Now I typically use Python.
4395.62s: Now I think with the advent of chat GPT people have slightly more capability, although I
4400.98s: have tried to use it for stuff like that.
4403.06s: It's really not that good.
4404.58s: So I think I would use it more as like an accelerator for back testing, not to actually
4408.90s: run it.
4409.90s: It's very unreliable with the logic that it tries to use sometimes.
4413.66s: But I think it'll get better.
4415.82s: And then I approach back testing, not in an attempt to turn something into something.
4427.14s: I look at a back test literally to see what's there.
4431.26s: And first to start with standard measurement.
4435.38s: And then after that, I go through, I segment the data.
4439.82s: I try to make sure that I'm following good data hygiene.
4443.90s: And then I can start overlaying some basic criteria to see if my general approach or idea
4450.74s: might make sense on a risk adjusted return.
4454.82s: Now a really important thing when it comes to back testing is the tendency for people
4461.78s: is to say like, oh, I noticed that this helped my returns.
4466.90s: Let me try adding this on top of it.
4469.54s: And let me try adding this on top of that.
4472.14s: And then you kind of start with this base effect that after you add 32 filters, it looks great
4477.66s: in a back test.
4479.34s: That is obviously what we would call overfitting.
4482.70s: And the danger is trying to strike a really good balance between optimizing something so
4489.06s: that you know that you're extracting as much of it as you can, which does require parameterization.
4495.22s: But without going too far.
4497.22s: And the way that I validate that is through different kinds of robustness checks.
4501.82s: You can segment, you can check variance between segments.
4505.10s: And then you can forward project with out of sample data, that kind of stuff.
4510.46s: So the whole purpose of back testing and the approach I follow is essentially that.
4515.58s: And then the last thing I would mention is even if I have a good back test, that doesn't
4520.90s: mean that the strategy works or that the idea is valid, it just means that it's not a
4524.70s: bad idea to test and then to go from there.
4528.62s: Because a back test, even if you account really diligently for things like slippage, for
4533.54s: cost and stuff like that, there's a lot more to it.
4538.98s: And when you're actually trying to employ it on an actively trading market, so the back
4544.18s: test is a way to quickly and then slightly less quickly, more in depth, validate ideas.
4551.78s: But it will not represent the actual performance of the strategy.
4557.02s: I could grab a water beer back.
4568.98s: So, I'm going to go back to the last thing I did.
4573.98s: I'm going to go back to the last thing I did.
4578.98s: And then I'm going to go back to the last thing I did.
4583.98s: And then I'm going to go back to the last thing I did.
4588.98s: And then I'm going to go back to the last thing I did.
4593.98s: All right.
4600.98s: Hey, yo, Lauren just hooked a bunch of people up.
4603.98s: Thank you very much for doing that, Lauren.
4604.98s: Very nice.
4605.98s: Thank you.
4606.98s: Lauren says, I just want to thank you for doing this, learned a lot, and appreciate taking
4609.98s: the time to do it.
4610.98s: That's awesome.
4611.98s: That really is like really encouraging to hear, especially as simple as it is because a lot
4617.98s: of the times when I'm doing stuff like this and talking about this, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
4623.90s: obviously do my best and I hope it's stuff that's useful.
4626.90s: But I never fully know, like if what I'm actually talking about is connecting, if it makes sense,
4632.98s: if it's logical.
4633.98s: So I, I really am stoked to hear that it's something that's like useful for you.
4639.90s: That was hopefully right level.
4643.34s: I don't want stuff to be too easy, but I also don't want stuff to be
4647.46s: agreedgiously difficult for this.
4649.34s: And I want there to be like clean takeaways.
4651.82s: So yeah, that's, that's awesome.
4653.46s: Thank you very much for mentioning it.
4655.82s: Ben says, how much what you do is discretionary versus systematic as far as edge, everything
4662.54s: I do is discretionary.
4665.50s: I have ideas that are based on effects that I can observe and measure, but the way that
4673.42s: I implement them is always with discretion.
4677.74s: There's absolutely ways to systematically extract edge as a retail trader.
4683.34s: It's just much more difficult and it's the kind of edge that you can extract in those
4692.14s: circumstances tends to be slightly lower than what you can actually pull once you're
4699.50s: an experienced trader applying that experience.
4702.30s: There's value.
4705.22s: There's objectively value and experience as a trader.
4708.50s: You have to temper it because sometimes the intuition or the, the approach that traders
4714.10s: will have will be to overweight their experience at the wrong times or underweight it at others,
4719.50s: which negatively impacts their performance, but there's definitely value and experience
4724.46s: as a trader.
4725.46s: So I always, the saying that I use for that is the trader always has the last say.
4734.14s: So even if I'm doing something that has a specific parameter that I typically would
4738.78s: follow because it generally makes sense, I always allow myself to deviate.
4743.74s: And it's because I've developed enough trust in myself that I know I wouldn't deviate
4748.54s: for some sort of half baked random idea that's based on an impulse.
4753.34s: And the deviation typically would be because I'm seeing something that I know isn't captured
4759.38s: in what I did previously in building the strategy.
4763.02s: So I need to react differently to that scenario.
4766.10s: It's a good question.
4769.58s: Jordan says can edge be found by being very familiar with the specific equity and then coming
4774.18s: up with option structure that works for that snapshot in time?
4777.58s: Could you expand?
4778.58s: I follow your question, but depending on how you're thinking about it would lead to the
4785.58s: yes or no.
4787.66s: In a high level, the answer absolutely could be yes.
4791.42s: But the option structure itself is not necessarily what would be delivering on the edge in
4798.46s: that specific underlying.
4803.50s: So I need to understand your use of that a little bit more.
4818.38s: At a high level, if you think about developing like a really close relationship with a specific
4829.38s: stock, you absolutely can then identify anomalies.
4836.70s: Jordan says for example, you mentioned how you tend to always run a covered strangle
4843.46s: on IWM is that edge.
4846.86s: All the strategy is edge.
4848.86s: I mean, the funny element of that is I haven't traded a covered strangle in IWM in several
4854.14s: years now.
4856.10s: So the reason being is we have to adapt to evolving market conditions.
4865.86s: So for example, IWM over the last several years, small caps in general, have performed
4871.50s: very, very poorly.
4873.34s: Jordan says must be an old video.
4874.82s: Definitely was.
4875.82s: It's the ones that you're talking about, like the old covered strangle videos.
4879.62s: Because if we take a look at, let's just take a look at like a quad chart.
4884.46s: So it's not like obnoxiously noisy here.
4890.46s: And let's bring these back.
4892.18s: Let's go back 10 year monthly.
4899.82s: What do you notice?
4903.42s: What do you notice about these as you go into 2021?
4909.78s: What's happened here?
4914.82s: Is the total returns generated from small caps have absolutely cratered.
4921.34s: For the longest time, small caps were far more favorable in terms of total return.
4926.98s: It's because they're a higher volatility.
4929.06s: So the amount of growth that you would get from small caps typically would be more than
4932.66s: what you would get from large caps and mega caps.
4935.54s: But what ended up happening in 2021, like post COVID, is we entered actually a really
4941.38s: restrictive environment that made it very, very challenging for small caps to make a
4948.78s: bunch of money.
4951.30s: So if we measure from here to here, I want you to notice something.
4956.26s: And this has everything to do with the change in market paradigm.
4962.54s: This is the COVID drop.
4964.94s: And then this is the recovery out of the COVID drop.
4969.14s: If I look inside the S&P 500, it rallied 118% from the draw of the COVID drop to the
4979.62s: following peak.
4981.46s: If we look at that in small caps, it rallied 150%.
4989.78s: That's another 50% on top of what you saw in spy, a massive variance in favor of small
4994.86s: caps.
4995.86s: But at this point, I was still trading the Russell.
4999.38s: This is actually when I had an old video, I don't know if it's still out there, but I had
5004.02s: an old video talking about managing the coverage strangle during like a really big market drop.
5010.54s: Because I had a coverage strangle out at that exact time.
5013.86s: What happened here is this period here heavily favored small caps.
5022.66s: But then as we had to get into a more restrictive fiscal policy environment, small caps have
5029.80s: lagged ever since.
5031.58s: So you can see effectively from 2021, it just ran sideways.
5037.30s: And this is as rates and inflation was going up, which is very difficult for small caps.
5043.58s: So I very, very regularly trade small caps and absolutely would again.
5048.70s: But the problem is is the current market conditions that we're sitting in really, really don't
5052.78s: favor them.
5054.02s: So I have no other choice but to move into other things.
5059.86s: Now the broader question though, of running the coverage strangle, the coverage strangle
5065.70s: as a strategy that I've built absolutely has edge.
5070.82s: Because it captures on various risk premiums on the put side also puts you.
5075.74s: It captures a little bit of premium from the short calls that minorly hedge the downside
5081.54s: moves that doesn't really cap my upside potential because they're sold at a ratio.
5087.10s: And I also aggressively manage them typically to avoid assignment on those short calls.
5092.54s: I also apply a value averaging approach, which is a way to effectively create returns
5100.50s: out of volatility.
5102.82s: So that's all part of my scaling strategy in addition to dollar cost averaging.
5108.18s: So the coverage strangle really takes several effects and it compiles them into what it
5115.90s: is and what the opportunities are.
5119.02s: So to recap those, we have what's Q.
5126.06s: We have variance risk premiums.
5129.50s: We have short call.
5132.06s: I don't want to use the term hedge because I don't mean it that way, but that is what will
5135.66s: be most familiar to people.
5138.14s: So I have the short call hedge, but then these are also managed to avoid assignment when
5148.50s: I want.
5151.06s: Then there's dollar cost averaging.
5154.26s: There's value averaging.
5156.94s: And then there's drift that's being played.
5162.50s: So the coverage strangle is really giving me access to all of these things.
5168.38s: And the way that I built a strategy is to help me extract all of these things.
5173.74s: The great example of this is if we take a look at the triple queues, you guys have seen
5181.62s: the coverage strangle in here several times now.
5184.70s: If I zoom this out, because we can get rid of these drawings, I don't really need these.
5193.30s: But if I zoom out into the timeframe where I started trading the coverage strangle in
5199.82s: the triple queues, which was, I want to say maybe October of last year, I started doing
5206.02s: like a sample portfolio because I've always tinkered with different kinds of leveraged
5212.32s: coverage strangles as a smaller allocation of the portfolio.
5216.74s: But I think it was towards the end of last year, maybe October, somewhere in here.
5222.70s: But effectively, what I do is let's say I can't remember.
5227.82s: Let's say it was somewhere in here.
5230.06s: What I do is in the value averaging and dollar cost averaging, as things rally up, I try
5237.82s: to maintain a certain amount of equity exposure.
5240.50s: I'm making money on the short puts and I'm rolling the short calls up and out at a loss
5245.42s: each time.
5246.42s: But I'm moving my bases up and up and up.
5248.82s: Then as the market starts to unwind heavy, I typically pair down my equity allocation.
5255.42s: So this is essentially, let's say if I got in here, I'm getting out somewhere in here
5260.98s: with some of the equity not all.
5262.94s: So I'm realizing a profit.
5265.06s: So let's say if I started with $500, obviously it's more than that for the coverage strangle,
5272.62s: but just using smaller numbers for an example.
5275.18s: And let's say on this move up here, I make 50 bucks on the equity side of things.
5281.78s: So what this means is I've actually just increased how much I can buy because I have 50 new
5289.06s: dollars that I didn't add into it externally.
5292.18s: And that's just from the equity that's not including any of the performance of the options
5295.54s: during the same time frame.
5297.38s: So then as it starts going down, down, down, down, down, I really just kind of slowly
5302.58s: scale into it.
5304.34s: So then we add another share, we add another share.
5308.30s: So this is the dollar cost averaging component.
5311.02s: So this is DCA, this is VA.
5314.62s: As I'm dollar cost averaging into it, then when it has its next big up move, I either
5319.72s: again decide how I want to play it if I'm going to start unwinding on the way up or yada,
5324.18s: yada, yada.
5325.18s: But this is how I use the coverage strangle to not only play the longer term effect of
5333.32s: the indices, which is if we zoom out long enough, we can see the longer term effect of the
5338.34s: indices is they tend to rally.
5340.66s: I'll go into QQs, the underlying in this instance.
5344.06s: So this is the last 10 years monthly, right, tends to rally.
5348.10s: So there's absolutely a drift effect by the market with these.
5354.06s: But then I amplify my exposure by playing these shorter term moves with options and then
5361.06s: a mix of dollar cost averaging and value averaging.
5366.38s: So all of that is a pretty long answer for you, Jordan.
5371.50s: I hope it paints the picture though on the difference between just trading the coverage
5376.94s: strangle as a structure in IWM is an underlying and the steps that actually go into taking
5384.18s: the structure into something that outperforms the benchmark that it's relative to.
5390.26s: That's the broader idea there.
5397.38s: Anything else you guys got?
5401.38s: Okay, cool.
5403.38s: Yeah, glad it was useful.
5407.38s: I still have time.
5409.74s: I actually totally forgot.
5410.90s: I need to start our dinner order.
5412.70s: I even think about it.
5415.54s: Whoops.
5417.02s: But obviously happy to get anything else that you guys, any questions, anything about
5426.10s: trading that you're stuck on if you're not sure what your personal next steps should
5430.26s: be.
5431.78s: All of that stuff is fair game at this point in time.
5442.38s: Paul says do edges have expiration dates?
5444.82s: That's actually a really great question.
5447.18s: So I would not phrase it that way personally.
5454.14s: I would phrase it more so that edges can absolutely go into and out of favor.
5463.94s: That is absolutely the case.
5467.10s: So what that means is when we're trying to trade again, some sort of broader market
5475.34s: thing like post earnings announcement drift post earnings announcement drift actually
5480.10s: used to be way more prevalent in more names.
5484.10s: But in the recent history, it's actually slowed down quite a lot.
5489.62s: And the reason why it slowed down so much is because of general market participants.
5494.46s: But what that ultimately means is the total edge has actually shifted quite a bit when
5501.34s: we're looking at something like post earnings announcement drift.
5506.38s: So in that context, it absolutely is something that doesn't necessarily have an expiration
5513.46s: date.
5514.46s: But it definitely is something that has a change in the effect over time with without
5523.38s: a doubt that is absolutely the case.
5527.26s: So yeah, I hope that clarifies that part a little bit for you.
5536.34s: And says, what is your argument for options directionally is not sub optimal as compared
5544.14s: to shares.
5545.38s: What is your argument for options?
5548.82s: Directionally are not sub optimal compared to share.
5561.86s: So what is your argument for the first reason?
5565.86s: The first reason why I would argue that options can be preferential over shares for directional
5573.62s: plays is capital efficiency.
5576.66s: I think whether you choose to buy options, you can access leverage.
5584.06s: If you choose to sell options, you can make money even if the market goes slightly against
5589.86s: you and your directional bet is wrong.
5593.58s: So I mean, those are the main ones I would point to like the main reason why you would buy
5598.22s: options comparatively to shares is for leverage.
5602.98s: That's really the main reason.
5607.58s: Through that leverage, you gained guaranteed downside if you buy an option.
5613.10s: If you sell an option, you don't gain guaranteed downside, but you gain the ability to manage
5619.02s: the basis through things like rolling.
5622.30s: So the fact of the matter is you can just make a lot more money with an options trade.
5629.38s: Let's just take a look at an example together.
5633.22s: Let's...
5636.38s: I'm not going to pick an individual.
5637.86s: Actually, we can pick an individual stock because this is one that I traded recently that's
5641.86s: been topical Tesla.
5644.38s: So if I want to try to trade Tesla to the downside, there are a few ways.
5651.02s: We can short shares, which is fine.
5654.82s: We can sell calls.
5657.90s: We can buy puts.
5659.94s: Now with shorting shares, there's a cost to carry that position and it is a little bit
5669.70s: expensive to maintain the position.
5672.54s: So let's go to when I first started trading it, which is on this drop, specifically below
5679.78s: the 50-day moving average here.
5683.10s: At this point, the moving averages were already negatively inverted.
5687.06s: So I had entered a short position here and then I scaled into it here.
5694.46s: So I mean, really, we can go to the 29th.
5697.78s: Wanted to have earnings, I don't remember.
5700.78s: After the close, that's right.
5702.42s: I tried...
5703.42s: I was going to trade earnings for it, but then I didn't...
5706.42s: I had started entering a short position but came out of it from earnings and then I
5711.98s: waited to get back in until we dipped below the 50 again.
5715.78s: The trade here was really, really embryonic, meaning it was early.
5721.62s: This was partially hypothesized due to the broader sentiment that was building.
5726.18s: It was also keyed off by some options activity.
5729.86s: Let's take a look at here the third of Feb and we'll just take a look at two comparative positions.
5745.70s: Well, I guess we could do three, four.
5751.62s: Let's just do four.
5754.98s: So it's loading right now and then we'll take a look.
5757.54s: Risa has never heard you mention it since it happened today.
5760.66s: Does quadwitching have tradable effects?
5762.50s: Definitely.
5764.02s: It certainly does.
5770.66s: Let's hit play.
5773.86s: So all I'm going to do is we're in on demand right now.
5776.58s: We're back in time and I'm going to show you a position and then we will build a little bit
5785.78s: more of a position around it so that we can observe the effects over time, which is my goal here.
5796.02s: So let's do that.
5800.02s: First thing we could take a look at just selling shares.
5804.02s: Let's see how much this would cost.
5805.62s: I think this is regulation T.
5812.34s: Yeah, this is taken 20 grand.
5814.18s: It's regulation T.
5815.94s: So this is not like a portfolio margin account.
5818.34s: But what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually add it to analyze.
5822.34s: And then we'll take a look at this from a portfolio lens.
5824.82s: We got to get rid of the old stuff that's in here quickly.
5828.10s: Give me one sec.
5831.46s: So we can get rid of this.
5833.46s: We can get rid of this.
5836.02s: We can get rid of these.
5837.38s: And the reason why is I want to keep track of these
5841.14s: so that we can see how they perform comparatively.
5845.14s: We have that one.
5846.74s: Then let's say that we think it's going to continue to go down for whatever reason.
5851.70s: I typically prefer 90 day for the diagonals.
5855.54s: And let's do two different tranches.
5858.74s: So that first one is going to take up 20 grand ish.
5861.62s: I'm going to effectively use a similar amount of money in this one just to compare it directly.
5867.38s: So this one is 16 313.
5875.06s: So let's add a little more to this one.
5880.02s: So we'll add we'll have one base position for this trade and then we'll have one kicker.
5885.46s: So right now we have like four grand left to play with.
5888.74s: I would go a little bit lighter than that.
5890.90s: But maybe we go to like the two 70s.
5894.58s: We buy these as well.
5899.14s: And let's grab a couple more of these two 70s.
5903.30s: Grab five of those.
5907.14s: Okay.
5908.50s: So now let's fast forward time.
5911.70s: We'll just go to the fix them.
5915.30s: And let's see how we do here.
5917.46s: All I'm going to do is effectively monitor what the value for these would be at this point in time.
5930.18s: And then we can do the PNL for each.
5935.86s: First we'll take a look at just the equity.
5938.58s: Okay.
5943.54s: So our equity position right now is making 11,250 bucks.
5950.26s: That's where it's sitting at.
5955.22s: At this 11343.
5957.06s: Sorry, 11343.
5959.46s: Now let's take a look at the options position.
5962.34s: The options position is making 20,830.
5966.66s: So it's making effectively double using actually a little bit less money from the other trade.
5979.14s: So this is an example of, and this isn't optimized by the way.
5984.26s: A more optimized trade here would have been meaning if I want to like really overfit to prove
5988.98s: the point.
5989.78s: I would have just done $20,000 worth of out of the money options.
5993.46s: But I wouldn't trade that way.
5994.66s: So even though it would make for a better back test, you know, in this sample,
5998.98s: for the example more broadly, it's just not reflective of reality.
6003.22s: So this is like an actual position that I put on, not this one specifically, but close to it,
6008.90s: where there is a deep in the money leg and then there are kickers outside of it.
6013.46s: So this is an example of how rather than trading the underlying, in this case, we're just
6020.34s: talking about downside.
6021.46s: It doesn't matter if it's down side or upside, same concept supply.
6024.90s: But when we're trading the underlying, this makes the options component,
6029.78s: makes more money with less total risk and less money utilized than the long equity component.
6037.62s: So Ben, let me know if that answers the perspective of why options would not inherently be suboptimal
6051.62s: for a directional place compared to the underlying.
6055.38s: Ben says I have just read options for price direction due to they don't have linear reaction to price,
6065.22s: as with shares, as well as paying more due to liquidity of option.
6072.10s: I don't follow that last part, but the other inaccuracy with your statement is actually
6081.78s: some options do have linear reaction to price, just to be aware.
6089.14s: So what you're referring to there is the variance of delta and gamma.
6097.86s: But if you have an option that has a delta of one, it will move linearly with the underlying.
6108.42s: Ben says you're losing money on your fills.
6111.86s: I see. Yeah, there definitely is less liquidity in options than the underlying out right?
6119.14s: I absolutely would agree with that point.
6121.86s: The underlying itself is also going to have slippage.
6125.22s: So in this case, you can see Tesla at this point was bid at $270.28 offered at $270.50.
6132.66s: So this also has a bid-ass spread.
6135.22s: And effectively, if you multiply this by 100, the bid-ass spread sometimes on the equity can be
6141.14s: even worse. It's rare that it would be the case, but it can be. So let's take a look at an example
6146.98s: here. If we take a look at just these 270 options, which we bought, that we have to get out of.
6151.94s: These are 25 cents wide. If you multiply 25 cents, I'm 100, you get 25. So that's effectively
6161.14s: the slippage here. If you take a look at the bid-ass spread on this, it's what, $270.22.
6169.06s: So really not that different is the broader point. The bid-ass, and again, if you do that on 100
6175.86s: shares for the equity, that's, you're going to pay that $270.22. So it's actually not that different.
6184.50s: And very frequently, options will be less liquid. I'm not arguing that options are more liquid.
6188.90s: They're definitely not. But they're not inherently way off compared to the equity, especially to
6196.74s: involve volatile periods. So Risa says the leverage should make up for the spread, also trading liquid
6206.50s: underlying helps. Yep. Two super important points. And understanding how volatility behaves.
6212.98s: When markets are going through broader drawdowns, then things inherently are going to become more
6219.54s: volatile and wide-mounted. So yeah. Sweet. Well, I have my dinner order launched. So I'm just
6231.14s: going to turn to making a video. But I'm happy if anybody else has any other questions that you want
6235.30s: to hit before we wrap up. Feel free to throw it in. Obviously, happy to hang out a bit longer on
6243.78s: this one, because this is our, this is our season finale. This is where we're designed to pull
6248.10s: everything together. So I hope, I hope you guys walk away with a pretty effective,
6258.50s: forward-looking plan. That's the general intent.
6264.50s: Cool. All right, okay. That makes me complete for the season. And I hope if you guys have
6273.70s: any questions, as always, you'll reach back out. We'll kick another one of these off in a few
6277.54s: months. But in the meantime, if you have any questions, as always, hit your boy up, be an outlier.
6282.50s: See you later.
