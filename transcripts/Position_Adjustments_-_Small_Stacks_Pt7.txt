0.64s: hey everyone eric here power's been out
2.88s: all day
3.36s: so i'm getting caught up right now the
5.76s: main thing that i wanted to share today
7.44s: is just a
8.40s: couple updates on the small stacks
10.00s: portfolio there were a few adjustments
12.40s: made
12.80s: in there so let's jump over to the
14.64s: screen and take a look
16.08s: so first off in xlf i had the
19.52s: two october 24 puts i collected 50 cents
22.48s: i closed those out today for
24.08s: 26 cents which came in at a
27.20s: realized profit 24 bucks and
30.24s: realistically that one was a little over
32.56s: 50
33.76s: left on the table but i wanted that
36.24s: money so that's why i took it down just
38.32s: a little bit earlier than i typically
40.24s: would
41.20s: so that is the main adjustment for the
44.56s: short puts
46.40s: now for the diagonals
50.08s: there is a couple additional adjustments
52.48s: made
53.52s: in pfizer i'm looking at
57.28s: probably just letting that one go right
59.44s: now if we take a look
61.92s: this was xlf so i just kind of took it
64.08s: down on that slide update
66.00s: but if we run over to pfizer so
69.04s: i i'm short the 36s in my
73.20s: small stacks portfolio i have the 36s
75.76s: and 36 and a halfs in my margin account
78.40s: right now pfizer is doing exactly what
80.72s: we want we want it to go up
82.32s: so it went up today just on the news
84.48s: that they're talking about maybe having
85.92s: the vaccine ready by the end of the year
89.04s: i think that's a pretty big move for
90.32s: that but whatever the
92.16s: fact of the matter is right now it's
93.36s: doing exactly what i wanted to do i am
95.36s: not going to try to manipulate this
97.20s: trade
97.68s: in the small stacks portfolio to try to
101.28s: make more money on it or to save the
103.44s: long i think a lot of people in a
105.04s: covered call situation
106.88s: go down the wrong path because the best
108.96s: case this is just like a cover call
110.80s: that's why i use that analogy
112.88s: more people are familiar with that than
114.40s: the diagonals but
116.88s: in the scenario of a covered call a lot
118.80s: of people see their short strike fall in
120.48s: the money and they're like oh well crap
122.00s: now i have to adjust this so i don't
123.36s: lose the stock or
124.96s: i don't want to lose the stock i need to
127.44s: figure this out and
128.96s: realistically you shouldn't trade these
130.64s: unless you're willing to flatten a
132.16s: position so
133.36s: for me best things happen right now i'm
135.84s: going to continue to let it go
137.60s: if i see it rise higher then great
140.88s: i might take down the
144.32s: trade a little bit early but otherwise
146.64s: there's very little incentive
148.40s: until i see the short calls have very
150.56s: very little
151.68s: extrinsic value so i'll keep an eye on
153.92s: the extrinsic value of those 36 puts and
156.16s: that'll tell me when
157.36s: i want to take it down if i take it down
159.92s: for for
160.88s: a full profit right now it's sitting at
163.60s: about two-thirds
165.12s: max profit if it sits right here
167.44s: remember
168.48s: i have it set up in such a way that
170.80s: there is no max profit if it continues
173.04s: up i'll continue making more money so
175.28s: we'll let this go for now but if
178.40s: i see again if i see an opportunity to
180.88s: take it down early i will
182.72s: then the next one is kroger now this
185.52s: one's a little bit of the opposite this
187.44s: one's
188.00s: hurting a bit after earnings so
191.04s: what i did today is i took in my short
194.96s: call
195.68s: and then i scaled in with my leaps
198.80s: i added a well not a leap technically my
201.68s: long call
202.80s: i added another long call which in turn
206.00s: reduced my basis
207.76s: so now i have two of the 29
211.68s: calls out in 16 april 21 for
214.80s: a total cost of 6.79
219.44s: so they're trading at a 72 delta which
221.36s: is pretty low that that's lower than i
223.20s: like to see
224.24s: but we're working through the down move
226.40s: i also
227.44s: chose to take down the short calls i had
230.96s: i was short the 36 and a half
235.20s: calls out in 25 september and i got a
238.24s: dollar 16 for those i closed them out
239.92s: for three cents
240.96s: no reason to leave those on what you'll
242.80s: notice though is i did not add another
244.64s: short call
245.68s: the reason being is i want to wait at
248.32s: least a little while to see if price is
250.00s: going to normalize i can still make some
252.00s: money
252.64s: on the short call instead of it being a
254.48s: dollar something it's close to 40 50
256.40s: bucks so it's not a lot but
258.32s: again in light of the overall portfolio
260.40s: that's not awful
261.84s: and realistically though i want to see
264.80s: if this
265.44s: move here is kind of a temporary drop or
267.68s: if it's going to gain a foothold my
269.84s: instinct is that it'll gain a foothold
271.52s: at some point
272.88s: earnings itself definitely came in a bit
275.60s: but they're still doing well they beat
277.52s: earnings expectations
279.60s: um so i'm not i'm not really that
282.96s: worried about it
284.56s: anyways that is what's going on in
286.88s: kroger
287.92s: now for a very quick overview of the
290.16s: entire portfolio
292.16s: right now we're utilizing about third
296.00s: three thousand sixty bucks so that takes
298.32s: us a little over sixty percent
299.68s: utilization
301.12s: um realized p l is a hundred seventy
304.24s: nine dollars
305.04s: which is a three point six percent
307.52s: return on the account
309.28s: and if you'll remember i started this
311.52s: account on the first of september
314.16s: so overall performance is looking good
317.44s: i have an additional 215 dollars
320.48s: in credit out right now and that'll
324.08s: add about 4.3 percent
327.60s: uh to the account right now i haven't
330.16s: bothered
330.80s: adding the p l to my capital to increase
333.36s: the capital i'll probably do that on a
334.88s: monthly basis or so
336.32s: just because it's not worth the effort
338.16s: of continually updating that every time
339.92s: it goes up and down
341.36s: um if it goes down enough obviously i'll
343.52s: have to adjust it but if it's going up
345.12s: it's really not a big deal
346.80s: so right now like i said i've about 2k
349.44s: open
350.40s: and what i'm gonna look to do is see if
353.52s: any short puts
354.80s: look appealing to me so i'll take a look
356.64s: tomorrow see if
358.40s: there's anything that i want to
360.32s: reestablish in place of xlf
362.88s: that would have me in about uh two short
365.76s: put positions for the coverage strangle
367.92s: and then two leap positions which i like
370.96s: that setup in general
372.64s: so we'll see how that all flushes out
374.88s: kind of to be determined just yet i'll
376.72s: take a look tomorrow
378.32s: i'm absolutely not opposed to sitting
380.64s: where i'm at right now because it is
382.88s: the the account is still making what i
384.88s: need it to make
386.00s: so i'm not really worried about it i
388.56s: zynga has been kind of
390.32s: tinkering with my short so this is one
394.80s: i'm keeping an eye on
396.32s: right now i'm short the eight and a
398.00s: halves and it's
399.44s: chilling at about 8 40. so i'm gonna
402.48s: continue waiting in here
404.16s: whether i need to adjust or not i want
406.16s: to take as much
407.36s: time value out of the options before i
409.36s: choose to adjust
410.64s: and while it continues kind of trending
413.12s: sideways at this level
414.96s: i will pretty much wait now a few notes
419.12s: the 9 day is dropping below the 50 which
422.00s: isn't great
423.04s: and i am going to watch like a hawk how
425.60s: it treats this 200-day moving average
428.40s: but until i see you know kind of big
430.96s: changes in those
431.92s: i i don't have any major major
434.80s: adjustments to making here
436.40s: so that is what's up and happening in
439.44s: the small stacks portfolio if anybody's
441.20s: any questions
442.24s: as always let me know and i'll catch
443.92s: everybody later
