484.00s: you
486.00s: go
488.00s: all right
490.00s: first things first
492.00s: let's get into a quick
494.00s: analysis of the stock
496.00s: I'm going to continue
498.00s: managing this time stamp
500.00s: We will take a pause as we are
502.00s: changing key
504.00s: topics just so that
506.00s: it's easy to navigate
508.00s: going back in time for everybody. So,
509.92s: First thing, grab it up on the platform, move you guys over to the main screen, and let's
519.72s: talk about it.
521.28s: So we know that GameStop had a pretty significant sell-off this day.
527.00s: We looked at this day specifically because it was essentially 10% down move on a day with
532.44s: no news.
533.44s: Like still, essentially no news, which is kind of nuts.
539.12s: Because when companies are making moves like this, I'm speaking in generalities.
545.92s: Sometimes when companies make moves like this, we might not see it the day of, although
549.88s: almost always you do.
551.84s: It's really rare that you'll see a company move 10% plus in a day on no information whatsoever.
557.96s: But on smaller companies, sometimes that can happen, and the information will come out
563.84s: maybe a couple days later, and you could just essentially tell that somebody knew what
567.04s: the hell was going on, and they were playing the move.
570.88s: But that's not even happened here.
572.80s: So bizarre.
574.72s: Now I drew this channel.
579.20s: When did I draw the channel?
581.08s: Definitely before all this.
582.08s: I drew this channel off of these lines here.
585.32s: I don't think there was any of this in this yet.
588.80s: And it's still running within this really, really steep declining channel.
595.40s: So there's a couple things that stick out to me from this.
600.84s: We've definitely given up this 30 handle.
604.04s: And the reason why that's important is from the way that I'm actually trading it, I took
609.56s: some of the shares down.
611.04s: Some of the actual shares that I'm holding.
613.92s: And I'm setting alerts that as it starts moving its way back up so I can get back into
620.12s: it as the rebound eventually occurs.
624.52s: These two lines have been drawn forever now.
627.68s: I wonder if it tells me like when I actually drew it.
634.40s: Does it tell us?
635.40s: I don't think so.
644.04s: Unless it's from here.
645.04s: Anyways, I don't remember when I drew these, but this definitely would have been over
648.84s: a week ago at least.
650.72s: The reason I'm curious about when I drew them is because the price behavior that you see
658.16s: is helping us identify where we expect the floor to be in GameStop, which is big question
666.48s: right now.
667.80s: Still hasn't had that significant of a fall.
670.88s: All things considered going from 33 to 27.
674.52s: Now it's a decline, right?
676.88s: That's literally an individual bear market for the stock essentially.
680.60s: However, that being said, it's also a really volatile stock.
684.68s: So really volatile stocks like this will ebb and flow into these kind of moves all the
688.48s: time.
689.48s: So it's not like the same thing is calling it like a bear market in an index ETF, just
692.56s: completely different.
695.60s: That context is only for your general consumption because I know that there was some people
699.88s: that were talking about like, oh, maybe it's setting up like a cup with a cup with handle
705.52s: or something like that.
707.52s: This is too deep of a decline for that again, from a standard technical perspective.
712.40s: Normally, you're going to be sub 10, 15% decline, definitely not 20 plus.
718.00s: So from a general market perspective, we can see that volume really ramped up heavy
725.24s: on this down day.
726.72s: And then it's been on a slow decline.
728.96s: Now we've had some updates, some down days.
731.12s: But the main thing is if you take a look at the volume moving averages, both the
736.20s: five and the 20, they're both negative sloping.
739.68s: So volume is siphoning out ever so slowly, but volume still remains quite elevated compared
746.08s: to where we saw it pre squeeze from May.
751.40s: So there's still definite interest in the stock.
755.24s: We'll take a look through see what institutional ownership and stuff like that looks like and
758.88s: then we'll start looking through if there's any specific news.
761.52s: But from a price action perspective, negative trend.
765.64s: Long term up trend still.
767.68s: So if we zoom this out even to one year daily, you can see that there's still very clearly
774.24s: positive slope in the linear regression.
777.96s: Well, these are standard deviation channels.
779.96s: So that's a really important note that that tells us that this thing is still in an uptrend.
784.80s: Even when I zoom this into a six month timeframe, still an uptrend.
789.08s: So even though on this short term time frame, so if we get this tightened in enough, it
794.60s: will show a downtrend here.
796.24s: So if you come into a one month daily, you can see that it's clearly on a downtrend in
801.12s: the shorter term timeframe, but anything from a three month timeframe out, it's still
805.20s: positive sloping.
806.72s: So still very much in general accumulation.
811.32s: The way that we would describe this from a standard stage style technical analysis lens,
818.16s: right stage one through four.
821.08s: Here would have been accumulation, pretty significant accumulation.
825.20s: This is now distribution.
827.00s: So distribution a lot of times will happen when there's steeper consolidations, but this
833.20s: here now is the zone to watch where I have these two alerts that 29 down to the 27.
839.60s: Essentially.
840.60s: Now as I mentioned before, if we start seeing price falling heavy below the 26 and a half,
847.68s: to me, that's short term bearish because this has clearly been defined as a new volume
854.40s: node where lots of people are transacting here.
857.40s: So if it starts getting to the point where it's plummeting below that, well, then that
861.44s: means at least for me, I'm not going to unwind more of my shares from the coverage
866.60s: triangle that I have on in there at this point, but that's when I'm just going to start
870.56s: setting a bunch of alerts for when it does start to base up and out.
875.08s: And then I also will sell more cash secured puts into that because the volatility will
879.16s: be elevated.
880.16s: But volatility right now is at 78 and a half percent, which is a high roast number, but as a
886.92s: relative basis, implied volatility percentiles literally 8 percent super, super light.
893.56s: And that's again, just pointing out how volatile of stock game stop is, which I think everybody
900.76s: knows that's why we trade it.
903.64s: Now, another thing that we see here is from a oscillator lens RSI down here.
912.04s: I use a two line RSI.
914.04s: I use a moving average and then I use the RSI line itself.
918.92s: And it uses a seven day VWAP for the moving average.
922.20s: And you can see that that's negative sloping.
924.36s: And you can see that the RSI itself is also negative sloping below the moving average,
930.28s: both below 50.
931.32s: That's bearish.
932.28s: That is a complete bearish alignment of that indicator across the board.
936.76s: So all of this is to say from a trading perspective right now, we, for me, not adding
945.80s: longs. I don't add longs in periods like this until it starts to show sustained moves.
953.00s: And again, something I try to remind everybody of as much as I can is that when game stop
958.04s: starts to have really big massive moves, we tend to get a little bit of a heads up.
963.16s: It doesn't happen overnight. It's never next day.
966.04s: There's always a series of indications leading into the move that give you
972.28s: as much time as you possibly can need again from a trader perspective to get back in if you're so
977.40s: inclined. So a lot of the move that we saw here absolutely came from the cap.
983.72s: So we know that he posted, let me grab X and let me find drawing kitty.
999.40s: So the cat posted here and this was on the 22nd.
1006.44s: So if we take a look at the stock movement, here's the 21st bit of a down day got caught,
1015.32s: which is great. And then 22nd, pretty significant rally up and out also into the 23rd.
1022.36s: So this is just another reality. This is absolutely another undeniable reality about the way
1029.32s: that roaring kitty can interact and move the stock. He moves the stock. That's all there is to it.
1034.84s: Especially in a near term, has he always moved the stock? I don't think so.
1038.84s: But we can run a pretty simple analysis of his last X number of posts and see what the average
1047.40s: move in GameStop was. If you guys are interested in doing that, we literally can do it on the stream
1051.40s: later. It's super easy to do. But there's a correlation there, which I know, because I already looked at it
1057.08s: from a loose perspective. Now, the interesting part is the reversal component to that,
1064.76s: which is also tradable, by the way. So one of the things I've noticed is
1070.84s: analyzing the correlation between when the cat posts, what the stock does, how long the stock does
1077.40s: it, and when does it start to reverse? Because it almost always has a reversal several days after
1082.44s: the post within several days after the post. I should say.
1087.56s: And just tradable. That's what I'm highlighting is that understanding these kinds of details
1095.88s: are really informative because they're tradable. So let's take a look at the options.
1102.36s: It looks like we have a few people interested. Yeah, so we can run through
1108.36s: the diamond handbook after we've finished the analysis, see how much time that we have left.
1112.20s: And if we do, I'm happy to do that with everybody.
1117.32s: Richmondson seems like when GME gets all above average, it goes up when lower volume goes down,
1123.32s: when vol goes through the roof, it spikes huge in near term.
1131.48s: I am unsure. Yeah, I'm unsure. The reason why I say I'm unsure is because I know that that's just
1140.12s: an anecdote. I know that that's just what you've happened to have seen, which is okay. But before
1145.24s: I like to say stuff like that or before I would say stuff like that personally, I like to actually see
1149.88s: it and run an actual analysis because I can see why you might catch that trend. But my guess is
1157.40s: there's probably a little bit more to it, but I'm unsure. So I think it's a fair starting point
1163.32s: at least. So the option chain is actually pretty damn quiet. So the option chain is at 545,000
1171.40s: calls against 165,000 puts. And we're all over the place. We have aspirations out. This looks like
1179.40s: July, let's see, 7 Feb, 17 April, 21 Feb. It's kind of all over the place,
1189.40s: 21 Feb. So a lot of them are for the next primary expiration. This looks like. So of this 545K,
1197.96s: 94 of it isn't 21 Feb, 119 is in 31 Jan. So this is light. There's nothing in here that's really
1208.20s: interesting me that's standing out is like really impactful or anything like that. The only thing to
1214.44s: highlight that is a slight departure from what we've seen the last couple cycles is that the bulk
1219.08s: of the OI is for the call side is in the front expiration now 31 Jan, but it's so light, 119,000 super,
1227.00s: super light. So yeah, nothing really jumping out at me from from this perspective, volatility's low
1233.64s: across the surface. We can see anything stick out to us here. These two stick out 21 March 17 April.
1243.48s: I'm assuming earnings is somewhere in that time frame just from the spike from 72 to 82,
1250.92s: essentially to 89. My guess is these will ramp up. They typically do in GameStop. It'll go through
1256.20s: periods where it's quiet or like this, but it's normally not sustained for significant durations of time.
1262.84s: So yeah, I mean, at a really high level from an options lens, not a whole lot that I'm seeing
1270.04s: that's leading me to think anything specific is going on. This is about status quo. The volatility
1276.92s: contracting as much as it has that is marginally interesting just because volatility ends to carry
1282.84s: a bit higher in GameStop. And from a technical perspective, long term uptrend defined as three
1289.96s: month timeframe plus, but short term downtrend as defined one month and within. So we're seeing a
1298.52s: divergence short term timeframe compared to the long. That's normally when we look for capitulation,
1305.00s: meaning we try to see where the new defined trend is going to lead. So for me, from a technical lens,
1312.36s: all eyes are on the short term side of the analysis window. And I want to see if either it's going
1319.80s: to start rotating through and falling below some of those key levels. Or if it's going to consolidate
1326.28s: base out, if it bases that's one thing in and of itself, or if it bases and then starts to resume
1333.56s: its appreciation from a business perspective from a fundamental perspective, GameStop is in a very
1344.20s: weird spot. And I'll explain what I mean by that. So let's grab GameStop here.
1351.32s: On bar chart, it's flagged as a buy. That's actually interesting.
1362.04s: 64% buy with weakening short term outlook. Yeah, that sounds that's
1367.64s: fucking funny because we literally just essentially re-irrated this exact thing. That's hilarious.
1373.24s: And let's take a look at some of the fundamentals. I want to specifically look at it
1382.60s: under the hood. I don't care so much.
1392.04s: All right, let's
1393.96s: take a look at how it's doing in the general landscape. So this is plotting it against other,
1408.76s: quote unquote, gaming companies. It's general competitor list. It's going to be a mix of things.
1416.68s: It's not really a direct comparison, right? Because pen is similar, but not the same EA.
1423.24s: But it gives us an idea of how the industry is doing. So if we take a look within the industry
1430.20s: of gaming, we can see RSI, SGHC, and SNAL are the only ones that are above it on a 52-week time
1438.52s: frame. That's really important because this means even though GameStop is having a near-term
1444.60s: reversal, the fact that it's performing so well within the broader sector and the segment of
1450.04s: gaming, that's actually exceedingly telling because it went through the squeeze as we saw.
1459.08s: But the really cool thing about this is that the squeeze abated, right? Like this isn't still
1466.12s: pricing from the squeeze. What you see here is actual fundamental pricing happening in the stock
1473.64s: as compared to what you see here, which is structural factors that are driving changes in the stock
1481.48s: price that are generally unnatural. A natural meaning, it's not reflective of the fundamental
1487.40s: value of the company. It's reflective of, again, market factors, people being short and being caught
1493.32s: on the wrong side of that, having to buy. It's probably a mix of institutions from a hedge fund,
1500.04s: Lens, and then also from market makers, which induces not just a short squeeze, but a bit of a
1505.64s: gamma element to it. That's what you see here. This is different. This is actually a fundamental
1513.80s: pricing of the company that's changing, which is good. So the fact that it's sustaining this move,
1521.72s: post squeeze, and it's sustaining this placement post squeeze is actually really, really good.
1529.32s: So all of those things lead me to believe that the company is still generally situated well.
1538.36s: The problem it has is it needs to do something. That's just an objective reality. GameStop
1545.96s: has to do something. It's in the process of doing some things. We can see that it's closing
1553.32s: its weaker performing stores. Really smart. And it essentially needs to continue down that path
1559.80s: of doing something. The reason why the something is so important here is because just because GameStop
1568.20s: has money, that's great. It needs to do something with the money to generate revenue. And I continue
1575.16s: to reiterate that point because lots of people will continue to say like, oh man, look at all the
1580.12s: interests that they can earn on that money. That interest doesn't really matter. It doesn't really
1586.44s: matter because people don't right now people don't buy GameStop because it's a bank that earns a yield.
1593.56s: That's not the business model. The business model is mixed and we're starting to see it branching
1600.12s: out into the card grading services and things like that. But it needs to continue innovating there
1606.12s: in order to sustain a fundamental valuation and a fundamental valuation change. That's what it needs.
1613.16s: So we're seeing that happening, but it still has a ways to go. Now it has lots of ammunition to use,
1622.60s: but it needs to do something. So that is the Cliff Notes version of where GameStop looks like it is
1631.88s: right now. And we will now pivot back into the top theories, which is analyzing right now the
1642.28s: Diamond Handbook. And book. Let's grab that. I'm going to move this out of the way. And then we'll grab
1655.72s: it. So it looks like we're generally in kind of like a series of AMAs. And this one, let's grab
1667.72s: where we left off. I know how to do this. I know how to do this. Oh, where are we at?
1675.64s: 360. So now we have Lucy Commissar. I am unfamiliar with Lucy. So I'm going to look
1690.12s: her up really fast just for my literally just for my general understanding. Lucy,
1695.08s: the
1696.76s: Thomas are who looks like a journalist. Is that correct? Or is this
1705.64s: let me move the chat so I can keep an eye on you guys as I
1709.88s: looking through. Is that sound correct to you guys though?
1715.16s: Journalist? If not, that's okay. I just don't know if this person is like well known in the
1721.64s: community. As you all know, I don't know. But when I look them up, what I see is journalists.
1731.48s: So I guess we will figure out. Yeah, okay. So it looks like there's a thing called the Commissar
1741.24s: Scoop Reports and Analysis. Oh, whoa. So she has like her own her own thing and it literally talks about
1752.12s: a lot of capital-based things. Secret underbelly of the global financial system offshore bank
1764.92s: and corporate secrecy. This is great. So the reason why I'm taking the time to do this is because
1769.72s: I'm going to reach out to her and see if she wants to do a podcast at some point. I did the same
1775.24s: thing before with Susan Trimbeth, who actually responded to me, but I don't think that we
1782.84s: connected fully on the original email because I think she just looked at my overall brand
1788.28s: as like options trading. She was just like, I'm not an option trader. So I'm not sure
1793.32s: where my work would overlap. But then I followed up with another email explaining essentially this
1798.28s: entire segment that we've been doing. So I'm still optimistic that I'll be able to line up with
1804.44s: Susan at some point. But I'm going to grab an email literally right now and see if I can connect
1810.84s: with Lucy once we go through her work. Because I just want to make sure that, you know, obviously the work
1816.44s: is good. I'm sure it is, but I like to look at the stuff before.
1823.00s: So it, but it looks like she's been in the game for a while, man. This is insane. That's cool.
1831.08s: So the other thing that looks to be very cool about her work is that it looks like, I mean,
1838.28s: she's been doing this stuff for a hot minute. And she's in all sorts of stuff, private equity
1847.80s: abuses, tax evasion, Russia, money laundering. So very, very, very cool. All right. So I found her
1859.64s: email, but we will keep that pulled up. And then let's go through this AMA and see what we can learn.
1867.88s: Okay. Out of the ordinary AMA question, let me just skip through all the stuff. Okay.
1877.48s: Okay.
1882.28s: This is the first AMA with Lucy commissar, but as many of you know, we are having her back in May 24.
1893.88s: Okay.
1894.28s: Okay.
1900.84s: Oh, Ella.
1904.68s: I don't care too much about all this stuff. I just want to get into Lucy's work. Okay.
1911.08s: Got involved in journalism long time ago. Civil rights movement. Okay. So this is definitely the
1915.16s: person I'm looking at without a doubt. UPI, writing, Philippines, people said the dictator
1927.40s: alluded to the country and money on Swiss banks. I thought, what's that all about? So you could tell
1932.28s: that she started. Man, she's been in all sorts of angles of this stuff. This is nuts.
1943.00s: Okay. Well, you're telling me as I understand it, that offshore means a secrecy haven. So you
1949.48s: still have an offshore account in the US. Yes, you can places like Delaware, Wyoming, they advertise,
1956.76s: set up a company. You can't have a bank account that is secret, but you can have a company that is
1961.32s: see. Yep. That's correct. And for those that don't know, wealthy people do a lot of stuff with this
1968.52s: and it's for a bunch of different reasons. Everybody immediately assumes, you know, it's just to
1973.08s: evade taxes and stuff and there are definitely our tax havens in structures like this. I've
1978.60s: spent a while working with different kinds of attorneys to learn about all this stuff because
1984.68s: it's a world that I didn't understand. And I spent time learning all about this and there's a lot
1993.16s: of things you can do that are very crafty to help optimize both your actual financial picture from
2000.44s: attacks, optimization standpoint, but then also from a just overall robustness perspective,
2008.92s: I guess I would say. So let's see what else we have here. All right, game stop. Here it is. Well,
2016.84s: because of writing offshore, I got invited to be in a film which would be called Wall Street
2020.68s: Conspiracy came out in 12 when the person called me and talked to the person invited me,
2025.32s: I said, I never heard of naked short selling. Here we go. Don't worry. We want to talk to you,
2030.20s: talk to you about offshore and how that's linked and it certainly is linked. But when I went to
2034.92s: the studio where people were being interviewed for the film, I met everybody who was involved in
2040.12s: fighting naked short selling. What fucking sucks about this is that this film came out in 20,
2052.20s: fucking 12 and we're still talking about this shit. So that tells you something huge. That tells you
2061.16s: that the people that really like it don't want it to fucking go away, which is why it's now
2067.40s: 13 years later, a decade and a half and we're having the same fucking conversation.
2076.68s: That's disenfranchising and this is also why I reiterate what somebody like Dave Lauer is doing.
2085.72s: It's really important because what Dave Lauer is doing is such a long drawn out process
2096.12s: that is difficult to run all the way to ground. And yeah, I don't know, it's just it's a bummer
2104.84s: to see that we're literally talking about the same as basic shit right now as a decade and a half
2111.32s: ago, but thus here we are. So here we go. Met Wes Christians, Suzanne Trimbath, who we're literally
2121.48s: talking about, Dr. T. Therefore, people in the film, Carl Hagberg. Okay.
2134.76s: Let's see. I'm just going to look it up directly on YouTube. Well, I'm going to add this to my,
2144.12s: I don't think we can watch this together. Unfortunately, because the channel will probably,
2148.76s: the stream will probably get taken down, but we'll read conspiracy.
2159.16s: And here it is. Wait, there's two of them. Okay, there's a lot of them.
2170.76s: There's one from front line. And then there's one. I'll drop both of them in here.
2181.00s: I don't know either of these. I'm just grabbing what I'm seeing. So I can't speak to which one of
2186.36s: these is the correct one or if they're the same one, I'm not sure. The first one I dropped is from
2191.32s: a YouTube channel called the Wall Street conspiracy movie. The second one is called Money, Power,
2196.12s: and Wall Street Part One full documentary from front line PBS. But I will earmark the conspiracy
2206.92s: movie, the Wall Street conspiracy movie. I'm actually going to add it really quick to a watch list.
2214.68s: And then I will work through this personally. And then we
2218.04s: will see. So let's add this to watch later.
2226.04s: And then hopefully I'll be able to share out what we can find. All right.
2235.64s: I suggest everyone go watch it. My opening, absolutely phenomenal. Let me,
2240.52s: I'm actually going to see if I can reach out to the people that run this channel.
2247.96s: There's a website.
2257.16s: Here I'm going to go to the website. Okay. So the domain is gone.
2266.20s: Well, damn. I want to
2268.20s: put it on. Who bad?
2273.96s: Imagine it would be terribly boring for you. This, uh, fuck it. We'll try to do it with audio and see if it works.
2297.56s: Yeah.
2308.52s: Damn, this is old, man.
2313.88s: So you guys can see the post captions. I'm just kind of flipping through it.
2319.00s: Naked short selling. Look at this.
2324.20s: Oh, it's so.
2348.20s: I'm going to see if I can.
2364.20s: Are you guys able to read that quick? If so, I'll probably speed it up a little bit.
2370.84s: I'm going to see if I can try to place some of the audio for you guys. I just don't know if it's
2376.28s: going to drop the stream. I'm unsure.
2383.72s: But let's see if we can speed this up a little bit.
2407.24s: So we're still just talking about naked shorting.
2429.48s: Yeah.
2430.92s: So this is all just talking about the financial crisis. I mostly want to see the,
2437.56s: this stuff about naked shorting.
2439.56s: So this is talking about internal, internal users that were leaking information to try to manipulate the price. I think we know about this stuff for a stock called Eagle, Eagle Tech.
2469.64s: What the fuck? What kind of riddles is that guy talking? And you guys picked that up?
2482.68s: That dude said whenever you have all the ingredients, you're going to bake the cake.
2487.80s: And then if the duck wax, you're going to feed the duck.
2492.04s: And when you get the ducks to quack, you feed them. I honestly can't wait until I'm a fucking 85 year old dude that doesn't have to say anything, cohere and anymore. And I can just say shit like that.
2509.08s: That I could just be like, well, the fucking ducks are barking. So I'm going to walk the dog.
2518.20s: I have to figure out which ones I'm going to use.
2521.08s: So I'm going to go ahead and do some more.
2523.08s: Yeah.
2525.08s: Yeah.
2527.08s: Yeah.
2529.08s: Yeah.
2531.08s: Yeah.
2533.08s: Yeah.
2535.08s: Yeah.
2537.08s: Fun fact, this is essentially how I watch movies to I just fucking put it on fast speed and flip. There's so much shit in there that you don't need.
2545.08s: Okay.
2549.08s: Yeah.
2557.08s: Yeah.
2559.08s: So this is talking about the basics of short selling. I imagine most of us are familiar with this.
2579.08s: Yeah.
2593.08s: Did not know that.
2595.08s: That's brand new news to me. I had no idea that it had to do with the tulip market in Holland.
2601.08s: But short selling does have a use which I will continue to remind people just in terms of pricing.
2607.08s: If if it was actually done correctly, like not this bullshit naked short selling and whatnot like that. That's nonsense.
2614.08s: But short selling itself does have a use.
2619.08s: Yeah.
2629.08s: Yeah.
2639.08s: Which this reflects exactly what we were talking about last week during the last episode of this where during the shareholder meetings, we were finding that there were so many extra voters.
2653.08s: And so I think that's why people are thinking that they had a vote and it's because of it's literally because of this.
2659.08s: So this it's all all just connecting those dots.
2683.08s: Fucking sound familiar.
2689.08s: They're saying that when they looked at all the shares being sold that there were too many shares being sold.
2699.08s: Wouldn't it be weird? Wouldn't it be just absolutely bizarre? If somehow there was a way for.
2710.08s: A company to have in excess of 100% short interest.
2715.08s: Wouldn't that be absolutely insane if that could happen because you would think it's only possible to short what's there.
2726.08s: So the idea that maybe there's too many shorts.
2732.08s: You know, I don't know, maybe I'm just going off the reservation here, but it almost seems as if it shouldn't be a thing for there to actually be.
2745.08s: Access shares being sold short.
2762.08s: Don't worry what he's saying is people that are in Wall Street institutions, brokers, market makers, they're all the fucking same humans you are.
2782.08s: They're always doing hold and pray, which is never a good vibe.
2787.08s: So anytime you feel bad about yourself doing something on the stock market, don't worry.
2792.08s: There's people with glasses that are brokers doing the same shit.
2796.08s: That's kind of selfish. I hope on the way back the plane doesn't make it.
2817.08s: It just feels like that impacts other people, not just yourself.
2831.08s: Yeah, we don't need all this.
2846.08s: Let's talk about the DTCC and the function of the DTCC.
2871.08s: I think all of you have gotten primed enough to the one and a half times speed. I think we can bump it up right.
2880.08s: Normally I'm at like two and a quarter. So this is still like glacial.
2885.08s: So let's see if we can do 175.
2930.08s: This is the phantom share issue.
2957.08s: The funny thing about the phantom share issue. This is what I find so curious about it.
2962.08s: If I were a stock holder, long term stock holder, I own the stock. I might vote as a shareholder.
2972.08s: What I find so interesting is that there are that many entities that are choosing to vote so much so that you can clearly see that there's an excess over what should be being received in terms of the stock holder.
2986.08s: That's just curious to me.
2991.08s: I don't fully understand the motivation behind the additional entities for the voting.
2996.08s: The basic answer might be people thinking that it could be them trying to make bad decisions to vote it into the ground, but you're not really going to be able to accomplish that through a shareholder voting.
3006.08s: That would have to be done through much more specific avenues.
3012.08s: I got to pop the door for Thorik his milk.
3026.08s: He's pacing back and forth whimper and so you know we got to hook him up.
3031.08s: When I say whimper and that's his war cry by the way, there's no whimpering around here, not in this household.
3038.08s: All right, let's go.
3053.08s: What what a fucking response.
3058.08s: I understand part of their point right when you're working with really massive systems to have everything line up and zero out is very difficult.
3068.08s: I do get that, but I feel like there at least has to be a reasonable level of tolerance.
3076.08s: Like at least so what a fucking response.
3106.08s: If I have a chance to talk with Susan, I want to show her this clip.
3133.08s: I actually need to save this clip.
3138.08s: The reason why I want to save this clip is because the fact she like this is shock inception.
3146.08s: She was shocked in what mid 2000s that 10 years ago this ship was coming up mid 2000s.
3156.08s: What is the response going to look like when we have a chance to talk about it in mother fucking 2025.
3165.08s: What's the response going to be?
3168.08s: Oh damn, this is nuts.
3172.08s: Yeah, I forgot, I got to update our timestamps because we started started watching.
3177.08s: Watching our show the time we start this thing at like 50, 53 minutes in.
3184.08s: The wall, the.
3189.08s: The conspiracy movie review.
3195.08s: I'm going to have to start crowdsourcing people to help me keep up with these fucking timestamps.
3200.08s: I keep forgetting.
3214.08s: Yeah.
3244.08s: Yeah.
3251.08s: That's fucking crazy.
3260.08s: Yeah.
3266.08s: That's fucking crazy.
3289.08s: That's kind of fun.
3319.08s: I like this sign guy.
3329.08s: Big fan of the sign guy.
3339.08s: Oh, back to equal tech.
3346.08s: Yeah.
3356.08s: Yeah.
3364.08s: Yeah.
3374.08s: Whoa.
3383.08s: So this is talking about seller boxing.
3413.08s: So this is essentially just talking about seller boxing and like a quick recap of the incentive behind that is that if you can get a company to go bankrupt, then you have a much better tax picture from the short side of that trade.
3438.08s: So this is a way to make money from two different sides of the trade like pretty seamlessly.
3445.08s: So really, really interesting.
3448.08s: I'm going to earmark where we're at in this so that we can come back to it.
3452.08s: I don't want to spend the whole session on it.
3455.08s: Let me grab a link to where we leave off right here at like 25 minutes.
3461.08s: I'm going to come back to this because I want to finish going through the the AMA at least for Lucy before we before we wrap up.
3471.08s: So let me move this out of the way.
3473.08s: And then let's get back to the diamond handbook of 58.
3487.08s: Okay.
3497.08s: Okay.
3507.08s: I'd like to show you how the off shore system really does connect with nature selling. It's about this adona story started 20 years ago.
3516.08s: Software company based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. That's a confusing place.
3522.08s: So starting out, want to do expand in IB that dude was working with the company called that company that he could help finance their growth that company was owned by corporate raiders car icon and Bennett, Bennett,
3537.08s: and that's about interesting that she calls icon a corporate raider find that curious the deal was that dude was going to get so don't have $2.5 million deal,
3547.08s: locate investors sell shares to them, lenders would be paid back with the loans come due.
3552.08s: Would be converted to share so you have a loan that would be promised to pay or shares the amount of shares, depending on the stock price at the time of conversion.
3560.08s: This would become called death spiral financing.
3564.08s: So, and then this is I guess where offshore and negative short selling enters the picture.
3572.08s: These dudes had a company called rhino advisors that's a sick ass name.
3577.08s: There would be intermediaries working with Sedona and the man from.
3581.08s: Paul men, they were working with an offshore fund called Amaro International registered in Panama based in Zurich.
3591.08s: The offshore places, ladenburg investors included the bat liner group.
3595.08s: Well, if anybody did some due diligence, they would find that Herbert bat liner that's a fucking hell of a name to.
3601.08s: 99 German intelligence report was in the business of laundering illicit funds.
3607.08s: The US prosecutors told the Colorado trial and federal court that bat liner had been handling money for a prominent Latin American drug dealer.
3615.08s: The contract with Amaro said no shorting because shorting would push down the price of shares and the less shares were worth when it came time to convert them.
3626.08s: So, the stock Amaro would get.
3629.08s: But the baddies went to work.
3632.08s: This is convoluted.
3635.08s: I need a diagram.
3638.08s: When Sedona signed the deal with Solomon in 2000 shares were at six.
3645.08s: Every time the company made a good deal, good news, they're sure it's went down and they couldn't figure out why.
3653.08s: Turned out that the baddies were shorting the sale through an electronic communications network that allowed the seller to hide.
3661.08s: And a month before the conversions, baddie and told the brokers at the infamously corrupt now defunct New York brokerage called.
3671.08s: Reffko to start selling Sedona stock short from an account at an offshore refco affiliate Jesus.
3679.08s: So, refco is not a fly by night had four billion and 200,000 customer accounts largest broker on the CME in a month they push the price of shares down from six to one.
3692.08s: Now, baddie and told the brokers keep selling use unbridled levels of aggression.
3697.08s: Now, the key thing to that I'm king into here is how this is a coordinated effort.
3705.08s: The ability for one entity, even with four billion to do something is limited.
3710.08s: That's the beautiful part about segmented markets.
3714.08s: The problem is that so many of them are in a similar position trying to do similar things that we run into this problem where these motherfuckers have a bunch of friends and they just call up their friends.
3725.08s: We like, you know, that you do this, which is crazy. It's crazy that this is so colluded.
3734.08s: And it raises an even more important point as far as I'm concerned, which is with the amount of collusion that we see.
3743.08s: The fact that and how pervasive it is when things start to get that big they become known, right?
3752.08s: So think of when you think of when you consider like old school mob bosses.
3760.08s: The entire neighborhood knows who the mob bosses, the cops know who the mob like all these different entities know what's going on who it is and who's involved.
3772.08s: But they don't do things about it for a litany of different reasons.
3777.08s: The curious thing about this is with something this significant and coordinated and to be clear, I'm not talking about just this one instance.
3786.08s: I'm talking about this happening across different companies.
3789.08s: It's really shocking that there hadn't been enough that would come out and start to challenge it.
3798.08s: And I'm saying that partially tongue in cheek. The reality is most of that probably was coming out in different places journalists reaching out.
3807.08s: Those kinds of things, but nothing was happening. The fact nothing was happening tells you again the alignment of the incentive structure.
3818.08s: Weird.
3821.08s: Because every dollar that you sell is a dollar in my pocket price fell 75 cents and it fell fell to 10 cents.
3828.08s: Lauren says why people are so passionate about GameStop.
3833.08s: I I agree with you to a degree. The reason why I say that is because I think a lot of people in GameStop.
3842.08s: And again, this is my just general observation.
3846.08s: I think a lot of people in GameStop have a very casual relationship with it.
3851.08s: And if we were to ask the majority of people that are involved in the stock, like if they could describe these elements, I'm I'm dubious that they could.
3861.08s: I think a lot of people would essentially be able to frame it as the stock should have gone up more and it didn't so the game is rigged.
3869.08s: And I do think that that happens to partially be the correct conclusion here, but I think it's missing a lot of details.
3876.08s: And I think that the main reason why people are upset about that are not necessarily because they're so concerned about the efficiency and the fairness of the market as a whole.
3888.08s: But I think a lot of people are just frustrated that they didn't get their money.
3892.08s: Maybe that's too dystopian of me to think of it that way.
3897.08s: But the reason why I say that is because with how long this thing has been going on for a lot of things could have been done if people cared about it from the perspective of I care about markets being fair.
3914.08s: And I say that because what Dave Lauer is doing with Dave Lauer is doing by filing that lawsuit that's a lot of work, but that's also putting his money where his mouth is that's not cheap, a fund.
3929.08s: So there could have been people if we were really, really genuinely interested in fairness of markets, we would have banded together crowdsource funding to hire a legal team to then try and start a lawsuit.
3942.08s: But I think for the majority of people it's way more casual than that. And I'm not saying that that's bad. I'm just saying that I don't actually think the depth of people look at it from, oh, I want this to be fair.
3955.08s: I think a lot of it is people didn't get the outcome that they wanted. They're upset about it. And I get that. But I just think it's a little deeper than that.
3967.08s: Rob says I put 30,000 in as a protest. They are shutting the truckers down and freezing bank accounts. Physical protests don't work.
3976.08s: I mean, I guess that there's a lot to that. I think your ability to protest however you want. I think it's fair. So you doing it that way. I think it's okay.
3988.08s: And I think to try to figure out what you want the impact of your action to be is also really, really important.
3997.08s: But I think when we say like they're shutting the truckers down and freezing bank accounts, that part I'm not positive what that's in reference to more broadly. I need more details and like who they are.
4010.08s: It's just another dangerous thing that we do when we're upset about something when we don't like something we generalize it really, really broadly versus keeping it very specific to who the entities are.
4021.08s: So yeah, just a couple thoughts on that. But let's see.
4024.08s: Of the baddies, they've been doing it a month represented 40% of all trades. Somebody should have been looking to start trying to figure out what's going on conversion.
4031.08s: Lefse don't is still out of 2.5 million loans. Oh, one point nine.
4037.08s: They would have to issue more shares because they would end up letting baddies control the company.
4042.08s: So in the start of February, they had 77 employees, 65 clients that wanted the software IBM contract, 7 million financing.
4049.08s: When the stock tanked, they lost business couldn't get other financing and had a fire.
4055.08s: So Sedona finally went to the SEC justice department. They were looking what's going on. They charged Andreas in a criminal case, but he jumped.
4064.08s: He jumped sale and went to Vienna. Austria doesn't have treaty with the US that where somebody is miscreant and a financial crime. You can't demand that person. So there's no extra edition. Yeah.
4077.08s: Okay.
4079.08s: More moved by them.
4081.08s: So Thomas baddie and on Rhino have settled with the SEC for 1 million without admitting guilt, but they did not sue any of them.
4090.08s: In May of 03, that's when was Christian got involved. He filed a civil suit against Laydenberg thalmin and some others. Okay.
4099.08s: So I'm taking a pause here because I need to email this lady.
4103.08s: So now that I understand a little bit more of her work and more what she's talking about.
4108.08s: I 100% want to see if I can try and get her on the podcast because the thing I'm most curious about from her perspective is based on what she was looking at.
4119.08s: This amount of time ago.
4122.08s: What does she think about where we are today and where we are now genuinely interested in that. So let me email Lucy.
4137.08s: I'm literally emailing it right now. So I'm saying, hey, Lucian team. My name is Eric.
4143.08s: I run a YouTube channel.
4148.08s: Creating and have been diving into the game stop story.
4155.08s: For about six months now.
4160.08s: Came across your work in an AMA on Reddit.
4167.08s: Regarding the offshore component and tie to make it shorting.
4178.08s: I'd love to chat with you sometime.
4183.08s: If you'd be willing to hop on a podcast.
4191.08s: I'm going to ask you to understand your perspective.
4196.08s: Of the evolution.
4200.08s: Thanks for.
4205.08s: Email sent. So we'll see.
4208.08s: I would really, really like to be able to talk to her.
4213.08s: Lauren says you assume people know how to crowdsource and get an attorney.
4217.08s: Not everyone understands that world. So they bought shares and help.
4220.08s: Yeah. And I think that that's also huge.
4225.08s: And I also think that the retail trader in doing that actually did find a way to your broader point.
4232.08s: To protest. And specifically regarding this individual ticker.
4238.08s: My comment was more so that I think it's tied mostly to the individuals and their individual financial relationship with that ticker.
4246.08s: I think that's a good perspective of because of my interaction with this ticker.
4251.08s: I now can clearly see that there are clear elements of manipulation in the broader market.
4257.08s: And I want to do something about that for the broader market and broader market fairness.
4262.08s: And I think if we came to that second conclusion.
4266.08s: Then even though individuals might not know where to start.
4270.08s: That's the cool part about the internet.
4272.08s: And if you're going to go through Superstalk, you're going to find every walk of life, every kind of person that's on there.
4276.08s: I'm sure that there's attorneys on there directly realistically.
4284.08s: A TCM says I think most GME shareholders are fairly well informed such as knowing that.
4289.08s: Knowing what seed and co and where and where most traders are to admit.
4294.08s: Jesus Eric sounded out.
4296.08s: Seed and co is where most traders I talk to have never heard of anything like it.
4300.08s: And that they don't actually hold shares only beneficials. Yeah.
4304.08s: So I think TCM you're comparing another element that I fully agree with.
4310.08s: Because when we look at GameStop, GameStop or the people that remain really close to the story.
4317.08s: Absolutely. We'll know more about all of these different kind of inner workings.
4321.08s: It's one of the reasons why I'm so fascinated because it's helping me learn more about a lot of these inner working.
4326.08s: So I fully agree with you compared to like the standard trader.
4331.08s: Because from the perspective of a standard trader, most of this stuff honestly doesn't impact the day to day business that they're trying to run.
4338.08s: But yeah, I couldn't agree more that GameStop is one of and I don't think it's just GameStop.
4344.08s: I think the people over at AMC, I know way less about that story.
4348.08s: I haven't spent a lot of time on that specifically.
4351.08s: But I can absolutely see correlators between them. So yeah, fully, fully agree.
4357.08s: Day swag says my goal is to grow the shares.
4360.08s: I'm unsure if that's a protest, but it feels good to have an opportunity to learn. Yeah, that's good.
4365.08s: And for for you, day swag, I mean, whether you do it in protest or out of not protest, it doesn't, it's whatever, whatever is best for you.
4375.08s: Right. And whatever however you want to treat it, whatever the activity means to you.
4380.08s: So yeah, that's awesome. I love that. That's that's been one of my favorite things about GameStop is I'm now understanding way more broadly.
4388.08s: The the perspective of like entities like this that I would have been otherwise unaware of. So yeah.
4399.08s: The museum says the community actually tried a crowdsource West Christian, the guy collected the money stole it and went crown and then crowdsourcing was banned.
4409.08s: That's crazy.
4412.08s: I imagine there has my guesses there has to be more to that story than that. I just have to.
4418.08s: That would be my original perspective on that.
4421.08s: I am really curious TCM if you have any do you have any documentation posts anything like that related to it.
4431.08s: It's just so interesting to me because it seems like that dude, West Christian is.
4438.08s: It seems like they're trying to help.
4444.08s: So that that would just be utterly shocking to me if they stole the money from.
4450.08s: The GME community not saying it didn't happen, but I'm just so curious about it.
4457.08s: They swag is let Lauren know that Lauren is they swags we.
4463.08s: If you guys don't know we have a love affair in in and it's brought by GameStop isn't that beautiful.
4470.08s: We have now a GameStop maybe Cohen can do the wedding or something.
4478.08s: But we literally have a GameStop love affair that we all get to be a part of and support.
4485.08s: So I love if nothing else comes from all of my time looking at all this GameStop stuff.
4493.08s: This is this is the win. This is the win for us.
4498.08s: All right.
4500.08s: So this is when lawyer was Christian got involved file a civil suit against them.
4507.08s: Judge Swain in New York heard the sue in over nine years blocked the suit by not ruling on the very first key motion never allowed Sedona to get discovery.
4518.08s: Which would have given them the documentation needed dismiss mostly defendants, including central figures.
4525.08s: So Sedona is still in business trading less than a penny share one of the lessons major company such as Layton Berg may enable fraudsters the SEC and the courts do not provide protection to the victims.
4535.08s: I think we can see that.
4537.08s: Sedona was taken down an oh one when SEC passed reg show which was to deal with nicot short selling which we know didn't fix it.
4544.08s: Oh for the included massive loopholes facilitated nicot shorting game stop.
4553.08s: If for example ignored fails that didn't happen in public exchanges the bad Ian had moved trades through Canada crazy.
4562.08s: And so they actually put out a paper saying this only refers to trades on exchanges.
4568.08s: This doesn't include when you call it nobody knows what's happening in Canada or some other places are not providing information and dark pools.
4576.08s: And again, I'm not sure if this is actually dark pools or if she means internalization here.
4582.08s: I'm not taking the lesson west Christian told me that more than 1200 hedge funds and offshore accounts were working through more than 150 broker dealers that's fucking easy.
4591.08s: That's crazy.
4597.08s: Liam.
4609.08s: If these people in the country and going to someplace like Austria, then it's too bad so sad kind of thing is that correct that's correct.
4617.08s: So they're talking about people's ability to flee and avoid extradition one note here is it's not necessarily too bad so sad.
4625.08s: It just means that justice might be delayed because the reality is is that if they ever want to try to go through the US or any other entity like associated with us in any significant way.
4638.08s: They're running a risk. So one of the things to keep in mind, although it's not pure justice and it's not ideal, but it is something at least to be aware of is that for these people when they flee to somewhere like Austria, you can still live a life you can be fine.
4657.08s: You can't be terrible, but you do have a target on your back and if you're trying to go somewhere through the US at any point, you essentially can't.
4667.08s: So if you have family friends, anything like that, that's all gone. You have to let all that go. And then you now have to adopt an entirely new life where you're at again, I'm not saying that it's terrible.
4676.08s: I'm not saying that they won't get by and that it's not fine. I'm just saying that it's not exactly like just get off Scott free and everything's fine.
4683.08s: There's still this thing looming over you that you still have to navigate quite literally for the rest of your life.
4690.08s: For instance, they went after the baddy and settlement for one million, they file legal complaints, what about lit it, it, it, it, they don't go after the big players. So then speaking of low hanging fruit, low hanging fruit.
4704.08s: If the SEC won't go anything, won't do anything when it comes to manipulation, what, what ways that companies that as well share it was can do to fight against manipulation.
4716.08s: Okay.
4717.08s: Bringing cases federal court, even if they get to a certain level, they might be knocked out because certain cases, the judges rule only the SEC jurisdiction federal courts not useful.
4728.08s: Going to state courts, you can get discovery, find out where the bodies are. Fuck yeah, always looking for some bodies. Give me one sec, I got a pop the door for door.
4738.08s: Take a look at it.
4740.08s: Look at you guys, it's like chat inception, you can see what I look at this is how I respond to you guys is I just keep an eyeball on this thing in case you were wondering fun fact.
4767.08s: Okay, so they're talking about the discovery process, which is fucking brutal, then go through everything.
4780.08s: Okay.
4785.08s: Game stop was able to reach a price 344 till journalist wrote negative articles stated that the price game stopped, which stated that the gate.
4800.08s: So this looks like.
4803.08s: Lauren says I'm happy you have it on live chat, not top chat, top chat is the devil. I sometimes I remember to put it on live chat. I don't always, but thankfully our streams are small enough that I can pretty much keep up with everybody.
4816.08s: I think it gets really difficult if like it's like a really big stream.
4821.08s: I imagine that's like a different problem. Hopefully that's a problem. We'll have to deal with at some point in the future is you get more people involved in this stuff.
4828.08s: But right now it's not.
4831.08s: Well, let's see.
4834.08s: Journalist wrote negative articles.
4838.08s: I'd like for that's a good way to get another story, which specifically deals with journalists.
4843.08s: Egyptian pretended to be Italian San Diego. Wait, is this actually San Diego here or is this a different thing?
4858.08s: I'm assuming that's actually where I'm at because I'm in San Diego. So I'm wondering if this is actually San Diego.
4865.08s: 200 hedge funds that remembers pain of three to six are much for the privilege of being on the website. Who are we going to hit next? I see.
4876.08s: Mr. Pink, that's a fun. Yeah, that's a fun name.
4885.08s: I'm just skimming through this.
4894.08s: Just a lot of fucking. She's doing a great job giving a ton of backstory, but it's a ton of backstory.
4903.08s: The question on tape to the broker we have journalists on the take.
4906.08s: Persian had gone to a rubah. Rubah's sick by the way, really good diving there.
4910.08s: It got in cards. You can load with money 25.
4914.08s: With a bank card that someone can use at ATM or using these cards to pay journalists.
4920.08s: Yeah, okay.
4923.08s: The interesting thing is I'm actually really curious like how impactful the journalists are on on the price.
4929.08s: I imagine. I mean, you have to imagine like fairly impactful if motherfuckers like Kramer are still in business and stuff.
4937.08s: I've never done any sort of a study on.
4940.08s: I did do a small study on Hindenburg research, but I've not done a broader study on like journalists and journalist impact on prices.
4949.08s: I wonder if there's anything like that.
4959.08s: Oh, Gindie case is definitive proof been manipulation by media. They're paid to do that.
4967.08s: Yeah, I mean, this is you would think that the media is supposed to be unbiased and objective.
4972.08s: Maybe this is just because this is older. I can't imagine anybody has actually thought this for decades.
4979.08s: Genuinely, I don't think anybody I'm 30. How fucking old am I? 33?
4985.08s: They're about to be 34. I don't know how 33 or 34 and this.
4993.08s: I mean, I can't think of anybody in my generation that actually thinks the media is unbiased and objective.
5004.08s: I can't imagine that that's been the case. What since like maybe the I don't even know like the 50s what the perception was.
5010.08s: I wasn't really around back then, but I do think that there was a point in time.
5015.08s: Maybe maybe it's just us church and it up and you know thinking about a better time that maybe didn't exist.
5020.08s: But I thought that there was a period in time where like journalistic integrity was actually like a really, really important thing and was much more widely consumed.
5030.08s: So this is just interesting. It just can't imagine anybody actually thinks that today.
5037.08s: Okay, video.
5042.08s: Jim Kramer. Good old Jimmy Kramer.
5047.08s: Do you believe major media outlets have been compromised? We know that. I don't think that's much of a. Do you believe it's possible that large institutions compensate media outlets? Of course.
5060.08s: Here's another thing for those that don't know and I'm not looking to go too far down like the tin foil rabbit hole and all that kind of stuff.
5072.08s: But if you look at who are some of the largest purchasers and sponsors of media.
5079.08s: So are the largest corporate.
5086.08s: What are the big sponsors of news and media?
5099.08s: Let's see. No, I don't want to know the biggest.
5110.08s: I don't know the big news.
5114.08s: The big news.
5118.08s: Let's see.
5123.08s: These are federal.
5130.08s: Lawrence is the government.
5135.08s: Let's see. I'm actually going to see if chat you be taking a little self research.
5142.08s: What companies are the largest donors and sponsors to US based news and or media.
5160.08s: Let's see.
5175.08s: I don't actually kind of nuts how difficult is to find this. I don't actually think that that's.
5185.08s: Happens dance.
5192.08s: So one of them.
5202.08s: The interesting thing about Pfizer is when you're watching, you know, sports media, you'll see it a lot of sports media will say presented by or in partnership with.
5214.08s: You'll see that.
5218.08s: Pop up every once in a while and you always find that interesting because it's like, you don't actually see a lot of advertisements there by that company.
5226.08s: So then.
5229.08s: What's going on.
5232.08s: And I think a lot of it is this.
5236.08s: I think it's this that exact kind of thing.
5239.08s: I think that's what I think is a lot of it.
5249.08s: And I want to maintain a decent name brand.
5253.08s: I don't have to advertise.
5255.08s: What I could do is I can donate to your media company and just ask you don't write shit about me.
5260.08s: You don't have to promote me.
5262.08s: In addition, how can regular consumer differentiate between trusted sources and compromise outlets?
5267.08s: Fuck that's a guy.
5269.08s: I don't think the way.
5277.08s: Yeah, so it's just talking about something that's built up over time.
5281.08s: The only thing I can recommend from this perspective is to try and look at stuff from multiple sources and not multiple of the same sources.
5292.08s: I actually try to look at stuff from what I would consider to be opposing sources.
5297.08s: So if there's a piece of news that I'm trying to read, I'll literally look for the article on CNN and then I will look for the article on something like Fox.
5304.08s: And I will look at both of their slants on it.
5308.08s: The good part about both of their slants is that we know their slants, right?
5312.08s: It's not like any subtext that you have to pick up.
5315.08s: It's going to be like abundantly clear the disposition as you're writing it.
5319.08s: But I continually try to find really, really objective sources of news.
5325.08s: And I struggle with it so hard.
5328.08s: Believe it or not, that's actually one of my absolute favorite reasons why I like I like finance so much.
5337.08s: Because finance really does a good job at getting rid of all of the excess bullshit around stuff.
5345.08s: And there's also another thing that I'll tell you guys about that I do like.
5349.08s: It's called it's loading right now. Hold on.
5355.08s: It's called ground news.
5358.08s: I don't know if you guys are familiar with ground news, but I like that a lot too.
5362.08s: Ground news is pretty decent.
5365.08s: And the thing about ground news is it kind of just shows a little bit of different perspectives, which I like.
5375.08s: And it kind of helps make it a little more clear what the perspectives are.
5380.08s: So yeah, overall, I think it's a bit challenging though to find.
5390.08s: Actually good objective information, but it is what it is.
5396.08s: Cool. Let's continue here.
5400.08s: Yeah, okay.
5403.08s: Motley Fool Market Watch.
5406.08s: Yeah, okay.
5409.08s: Evidence after the make clear.
5414.08s: I would like to know your opinion on mainstream media for a CNBC coverage of GameStop.
5418.08s: Oh, I like this one.
5422.08s: I agree with your distrust and because of what I haven't watched television 20, 30 years.
5427.08s: I don't have a working TV. This is funny. I do it. I do have a working TV, but I don't watch TV either.
5432.08s: Literally zero. So I identify much with Lucy here.
5437.08s: And when there are hearings go to the website committee. So I would not trust any of these places.
5441.08s: So I'd like to ask you to read this.
5447.08s: So I would like to read a summary.
5452.08s: So a quick way to stop being deceived is by avoiding the media.
5456.08s: Yep.
5465.08s: I like that.
5470.08s: I don't think that's like a big, big surprise.
5475.24s: A lot of them too, we, I think it's important to remember as a bunch of them are going to
5478.48s: have their own perspectives and stuff, right?
5482.80s: And because they have to represent constituents.
5494.64s: Is it official who's saying has unverified information, unqualified sources?
5500.00s: What do you make of that?
5501.48s: I mean, I don't actually think that that's inaccurate.
5507.56s: This is, this is completely accurate, but I also don't think it's fair to bubble up
5513.76s: the sources as just this.
5517.72s: But I think it's completely fair to say all of these, even regular news, everything
5522.72s: has unverified information, unqualified sources.
5525.56s: Like I, I think that that's a fair statement, actually.
5529.04s: But I understand Lucy's broader point is that they're being naive, especially in the,
5536.76s: the way that they're talking about these things, which I completely.
5541.12s: Totally disagree with this person who's obviously showing a better never even looked
5547.68s: at Superstonk and saw the very granular series analysis that's being done there.
5552.80s: Again, let's, let's be honest.
5555.76s: If we go through Superstonk right now and we scroll through, you're going to see a lot
5559.88s: of nonsense.
5560.88s: Just people have them fine, people ship posting.
5563.00s: I'm not saying that it's bad, but I'm just saying like if you, you actually have to dig
5567.56s: a little bit and the reason why I know this is because I'm fucking doing it.
5570.56s: I've been doing it for again, six months now.
5575.12s: And it's not relegated to the time I spend doing these streams with you.
5578.24s: It's like the way that I understand this stuff is by spending a lot of time looking at
5582.00s: it.
5583.00s: My point is is that I would argue the majority of what you come across on there are people
5586.12s: talking about.
5587.12s: Shuffman bananas up their ass and fun memes, right?
5589.84s: It's people being a community, forcing around supporting one another.
5593.68s: But in that, this, un-equivically exists.
5601.72s: This DD library that we're going through in this specific segment of the library, the
5606.60s: Diamond Handbook is literally the perfect depiction of that.
5610.68s: There is some exceedingly, exceedingly intelligent analysis occurring here.
5617.16s: Couldn't, literally couldn't agree more.
5620.16s: Okay.
5622.20s: We like, we like Keith, that's good.
5626.64s: You said the same share could be located dozens of times.
5629.68s: Yep, the option market makers like Citadel were exempt from the rules.
5632.96s: Yep, yep.
5633.96s: So this is good.
5635.96s: Okay.
5642.96s: Overstock.
5646.96s: You'll plaintiff, fake plaintiff.
5654.24s: Shill is a real word then.
5655.84s: Yes, that's so funny.
5657.76s: Two lawyers from these went to prison.
5660.44s: Why did they not look for the other part of the scheme, which is a question.
5664.88s: Overstock filed suit against 11 prime brokers.
5668.84s: 11 of them.
5670.36s: It pursued strategy conversion for market makers.
5674.08s: Yeah.
5676.20s: Conversions were bought by prime brokers, acquire and vent long stocks that they could
5679.28s: loan out.
5680.28s: I think the security is lending market.
5682.28s: It's just like the mob completely rigged, completely agree.
5686.32s: I'm trying to get to the TLDR for this one.
5693.16s: Am.
5695.16s: All right.
5696.00s: I got to add our leave off point here.
5698.36s: Man, this was a really interesting session.
5700.60s: Leave off point for 25 Jan.
5706.48s: We need to watch some of the Wall Street conspiracy movie.
5715.08s: I'm going to add the link to that in here so that we have it all in one spot.
5723.64s: We need to start from around 26 minutes.
5730.04s: Anything you guys want to take a look at before we wrap up?
5734.16s: Any questions you guys have from a broader perspective?
5736.80s: I haven't really taken time to do like any sort of broader questions and what not, which
5742.36s: I apologize for.
5743.36s: That's why I'm ending a few minutes early before dinner gets here so that if people
5747.44s: have questions, we have a chance to talk about it together.
5750.80s: But if not totally cool as well, Nathan says so far, we can look at that kind of thing
5756.92s: on Monday.
5757.92s: I prefer to keep it specific to GameStop for this one.
5762.52s: The purpose of having specific themes for the streams and whatnot is so that we can
5766.40s: stay like zoomed in, honed in on stuff.
5770.04s: And then streams like the Monday, Wednesday stream, those are good for kind of taking
5774.08s: a look at whatever.
5775.08s: PCM says check Reddit link on Discord.
5777.48s: Awesome.
5778.48s: Thank you.
5779.48s: I will take a look through that.
5785.48s: Just let me know where it is.
5789.48s: Cool.
5790.48s: All right, okay.
5791.48s: Well, then that wraps me up.
5792.48s: If you guys need anything, you always can drop me a line, shoot me an email.
5795.48s: If you have a question, hit me up in the discord.
5797.48s: Do my best to respond to everybody's best I can.
5800.72s: Thanks for being a part of the journey with me.
5803.04s: I cannot tell you how much I'm enjoying learning all about this.
5806.16s: I think this is probably one of the most interesting stories I've come across from a bunch
5809.52s: of different reasons, but this specific segment of going deeper and all of the analysis
5815.40s: behind GameStop, the company, the market.
5818.80s: This has been one of the coolest parts for me because I am a market junkie.
5823.04s: Like I said, I've been obsessed with this stuff since I've been a teenager.
5827.04s: So being able to go insanely deep on this and understand the market's more in depth
5832.84s: is so cool to me.
5834.64s: And I'm thankful to be able to do that all with you and hopefully show you all some of
5839.24s: that as well.
5840.60s: So being outlier, I'll see you all later.
