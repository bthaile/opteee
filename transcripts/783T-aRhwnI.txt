0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  you
120.00s:  you
150.00s:  you
180.00s:  this
210.00s:  so far that I can clearly identify it's taught me a ton about how markets behave, the way things
220.40s:  seem to be versus the way that they are. And yeah, super, super interesting to me. So the
228.72s:  game plan for this session today is pretty standard fair. We'll start with a quick overview.
234.00s:  Just analyze where GameStop is today. Any new news that's coming out, those kinds of things
240.48s:  and then we'll dive into the next iteration of the top theory analysis where we're going through
248.64s:  the DD library. I think we're almost through the second half of the Diamond Handbook, I believe
258.24s:  it's called the Diamond Handbook, which is over 400 pages. So we've consumed an incredible
266.24s:  amount of information, different theories and stuff, which is super fun for me. It's interesting
271.36s:  to see the way that people think. And again, for those that don't understand my interest and
279.12s:  application for this, I imagine most of you are, but for anybody that's tuning in for the first time,
284.24s:  like I'm still primarily a trader. It's how I make my money. It's what I do. So GameStop is
290.24s:  interesting from a lot of general market function perspectives for me. And understanding the way
298.32s:  that people think about it, the way that people use it, the way that people treat it is very interesting
303.12s:  to me. And it's just a lot of it is so different than what I do. So I really enjoy that perspective.
310.72s:  And then also there's the reality that I trade GameStop and I trade GameStop for a reason.
316.96s:  And it's because there's a lot of volatility. Now I still fully consider myself a guest in the
323.68s:  GameStop house because I was not there the entire duration. Like I know some people have been
329.52s:  in the stock for four years now, five years now. And I just kind of come in trade, leave when
335.76s:  it's time to move on to something else. So taking time to get into detail on it has been super fun.
343.20s:  Now one quick admin note is you'll notice that on Tuesdays, I'm starting to get into a regular
349.68s:  cadence of a GameStop specific video coming out on Tuesdays. And the reason I'm hammering that in
355.68s:  is because while there's not always a lot going on with GameStop, meaning the cat doesn't always
362.88s:  post or the stock isn't always flying all over the place. So that means that it kind of has slowed
369.28s:  down the number of GameStop videos that I've been doing is standalone videos because it's been
373.36s:  a little more quiet. But I realize even though I am still looking at it every day, I'm not sure that
380.48s:  people are able to like track what I'm tracking specifically from an options and derivatives
386.72s:  perspective. So that's the goal of that Tuesday video. And the other thing that you'll note is on
392.88s:  that video, I'll walk through the position that I've been sharing with you all. I'm using a model
400.88s:  position really breaking out part of my broader position and then showing everybody how we can
406.80s:  trade GameStop specifically using options. And it's just the way that I'm doing it in what I
413.84s:  consider to be probably one of the more applicable ways for most people that trade GameStop from the
418.72s:  perspective of most that I know really want to buy it, want to hold it. So we want to base the
424.08s:  options trading around the equity position, which we can absolutely do. That's the cool part about
430.00s:  options. So who do we got in the chat? We got Lucas Lauren Reese. We have our blue box friend
441.28s:  EK. What does a metallurgist say during a heat wave? You have to tell me it looks like tingling. Oh, you're
453.12s:  already answered it. I realize it's another person. I'm smelting. I'm smelting. I like that one.
462.00s:  Thank you for the joke. We'll make sure that oh, damn it. We have to like put it together
468.48s:  so that I can pin it. Oh, fuck. I fucked that up too. Damn. One sec.
475.84s:  I want to make sure that your joke is able to be pinned so everybody can enjoy it. There you go.
482.32s:  There you go. All right. First things first. Let's get into a quick analysis of the stock.
492.16s:  I'm going to continue managing this time stamp. So I'll take a pause as we're like changing key
496.72s:  topics just so that it's easy to navigate going back in time for everybody. So a 20 into the
503.12s:  stream and we were doing GME stock analysis. Let's see what the dealio is. First thing, grab it up
512.88s:  on the platform. Move you guys over to the main screen. And let's talk about it. So we know
522.56s:  that GME stock had a pretty significant sell off this day. We looked at this day specifically
528.88s:  because it was essentially 10% down move on a day with no news. Like still essentially no news,
535.20s:  which is kind of nuts. Sometimes when companies are making moves like this,
543.60s:  speaking in generalities, sometimes when companies make moves like this, we might not see it the day
548.96s:  of although almost always you do. It's really rare that you'll see a company move 10% plus in a day
555.52s:  on no information whatsoever. But on smaller companies, sometimes that can happen and the information
563.04s:  will come out maybe a couple days later and you could just essentially tell that somebody knew
566.88s:  what the hell was going on and they were playing the move. But that's not even happened here. So
573.68s:  bizarre. Now I drew this channel. When did I draw the channel? Definitely before all this. I drew
582.40s:  this channel off of these lines here. I don't think there was any of this in this yet. And it's
589.68s:  still running within this really, really steep declining channel. So there's a couple things that
598.48s:  stick out to me from this. We've definitely given up this 30 handle. And the reason why that's
604.72s:  important is from the way that I'm actually trading it. I took some of the shares down. Some of
611.04s:  the actual shares that I'm holding. And I'm setting alerts that as it starts moving its way back
618.24s:  up so I can get back into it as the rebound eventually occurs. These two lines have been drawn
626.24s:  forever now. I wonder if it tells me like when I actually drew it.
634.24s:  Does it tell us?
640.72s:  I don't think so. Unless it's from here. Anyways, I don't remember when I drew these, but this
647.68s:  definitely would have been over a week ago at least. And the reason why I'm curious about when I
652.48s:  drew them is because the price behavior that you see is helping us identify where we expect the
662.08s:  floor to be in GameStop, which is big question right now. Still hasn't had that significant of a
670.24s:  fall. All things considered going from 33 to 27. Now it's a decline, right? That's literally
677.60s:  individual bear market for the stock essentially. However, that being said, it's also a really
683.52s:  volatile stock. So really volatile stocks like this will ebb and flow into these kind of moves all
688.40s:  the time. So it's not like the same thing is calling it like a bear market in an index ETF.
692.32s:  Just completely different. That context is only for your general consumption because I know that
699.12s:  there was some people that were talking about like, oh, maybe it's setting up like a cup with
704.24s:  a cup with handle or something like that. And it just, this is too deep of a decline for that
709.92s:  again, from a standard technical perspective. Normally, you're going to be sub 10, 15% decline,
715.84s:  definitely not 20 plus. So from a general market perspective, we can see that volume really ramped
724.48s:  up heavy on this down day. And then it's been on a slow decline. Now we've had some updates,
730.00s:  some down days. But the main thing is if you take a look at the volume moving averages,
735.60s:  both the five and the 20, they're both negative sloping. So volume is siphoning out ever so slowly.
743.20s:  But volume still remains quite elevated compared to where we saw it pre squeeze from may.
751.28s:  So there's still definite interest in the stock. We'll take a look through, see what institutional
757.20s:  ownership and stuff like that looks like. And then we'll start looking through if there's any
760.08s:  specific news. But from a price action perspective, negative trend long term uptrend still. So if we
768.00s:  zoom this out even to one year daily, you can see that there's still very clearly positive slope
776.16s:  in the linear regression. Well, these are standard deviation channels. So that's a really important
781.04s:  note that that tells us that this thing is still in an uptrend. Even when I zoom this into a
785.76s:  six month time frame still in uptrend. So even though on this short term time frame, so if we get
792.64s:  this Titan in a knob, it will show a downtrend here. So if we come into a one month daily, you can
798.40s:  see that it's clearly on a downtrend in the shorter term time frame. But anything from a three month
804.08s:  time frame out, it's still positive sloping. So still very much in general accumulation.
811.20s:  The way that we would describe this from a standard stage style technical analysis lens,
818.00s:  right stage one through four, this here would have been accumulation, pretty significant accumulation.
824.96s:  This is now distribution. So distribution a lot of times will happen when there's steeper
830.88s:  consolidations. But this here now is the zone to watch where I have these two alerts that 29 down
838.24s:  to the 27 essentially. Now, as I mentioned before, if we start seeing price falling heavy below
846.08s:  the 26 and a half, to me, that's short term bearish because this has clearly been defined as a new
853.92s:  volume node where lots of people are transacting here. So if it starts getting to the point where
858.96s:  it's plummeting below that, well, then that means at least for me, I'm not going to unwind more of my
865.52s:  shares from the coverage strangle that I have on in there at this point. But that's when I'm just
870.08s:  going to start setting a bunch of alerts for when it does start to base up and out. And then I also
875.76s:  will sell more cash secured puts into that because the volatility will be elevated.
880.16s:  Valtzility right now is at 78.5%, which is a high roast number. But as a relative basis,
887.84s:  implied volatility percentiles literally 8% super, super light. And that's again, just pointing out
896.48s:  how volatile of stock game stop is, which I think everybody knows that's why we trade it.
902.56s:  Now, another thing that we see here is from a oscillator lens RSI down here. I use a two line RSI.
914.08s:  I use a moving average and then I use the RSI line itself. And it uses a seven day V-wap
921.28s:  for the moving average. And you can see that that's negative sloping. And you can see that the RSI itself
927.68s:  is also negative sloping below the moving average, both below 50. That's bearish. That is a complete
933.28s:  bearish alignment of that indicator across the board. So all of this is to say from a trading
940.16s:  perspective, right now we, for me, not adding longs. I don't add longs in periods like this
949.52s:  until it starts to show sustained moves. And again, something I try to remind everybody of as much
955.84s:  as I can is that when game stop starts to have really big massive moves, we tend to get a little
962.24s:  bit of a heads up. It doesn't happen overnight. It's never next day. There's always a series of
968.24s:  indications leading into the move that give you as much time as you possibly can need, again,
974.80s:  from a trader perspective to get back in if you're so inclined. So a lot of the move that we saw
981.28s:  here absolutely came from the cap. So we know that he posted, let me grab X and let me find
994.24s:  for him kitty. So the cat hosted here. And this was on the 22nd. So if we take a look at the
1009.20s:  stock movement, here's the 21st bit of a down day got caught, which is great. And then 22nd,
1018.88s:  pretty significant rally up and out also into the 23rd. So this is just another reality. This
1024.72s:  is absolutely another undeniable reality about the way that roaring kitty can interact and move
1031.84s:  the stock. He moves the stock. That's all there is to it, especially in a near term. Has he
1036.64s:  always moved the stock? I don't think so. But we can run a pretty simple analysis of his last
1044.48s:  X number of posts and see what the average move in GameStop was. If you guys are interested in
1049.60s:  doing that, we literally can do it on the stream later. It's super easy to do. But there's a
1054.40s:  correlation there, which I know, because I already looked at it from a loose perspective.
1060.48s:  Now the interesting part is the reversal component to that, which is also tradable, by the way.
1067.20s:  So one of the things I've noticed is analyzing the correlation between when the cat posts,
1074.80s:  what the stock does, how long the stock does it, and when does it start to reverse? Because it almost
1079.84s:  always has a reversal several days after the post within several days after the post I should say.
1087.60s:  And just tradable. That's that's what I'm highlighting is that understanding these kinds of
1094.88s:  details are really informative because they're tradable. So let's take a look at the options.
1102.40s:  It looks like we have a few people interested. Yeah, so we can run through the diamond handbook
1109.52s:  after we've finished the analysis, see how much time that we have left. And if we do, I'm happy
1114.72s:  happy to do that with everybody. Richmondson seems like when GME gets all above average, it goes up,
1121.28s:  when lower volume goes down, when vol goes through the roof, it spikes huge in near term.
1131.60s:  I am unsure. Yeah, I'm unsure. The reason why I say I'm unsure is because I know that that's
1140.00s:  just an anecdote. I know that that's just what you've happened to have seen, which is okay. But
1144.64s:  before I like to say stuff like that or before I would say stuff like that personally, I like to
1149.28s:  actually see it and run an actual analysis because I can see why you might catch that trend.
1156.40s:  But my guess is there's probably a little bit more to it, but I'm unsure. So I think it's a
1162.48s:  fair starting point at least. So the option chain is actually pretty damn quiet. So the options
1169.60s:  chain is at 545,000 calls against 165,000 puts. And we're all over the place. We have
1176.96s:  explorations out. This looks like July. Let's see. 7 Feb, 17 April,
1186.48s:  21 Feb. It's kind of all over the place. 21 Feb. So a lot of them are for the next primary
1193.76s:  expiration. This looks like. So of this 545K, 94 of it isn't 21 Feb. 119 is in 31 Jan. So this is light.
1206.40s:  There's nothing in here that's really interesting. Me that's standing out is like really
1210.88s:  impactful or anything like that. The only thing to highlight that is a slight departure from what
1216.56s:  we've seen the last couple cycles is that the bulk of the OI is for the call side is in the front
1222.64s:  expiration now 31 Jan, but it's so light. 119,000 super, super light. So yeah, nothing really jumping
1230.40s:  out at me from from this perspective, volatility is low across the surface. We can see anything stick
1237.84s:  out to us here. These two stick out 21 March 17 April. I'm assuming earnings is somewhere in that
1245.92s:  time frame just from the spike from 72 to 82 essentially to 89. My guess is these will ramp up.
1254.24s:  They typically do in GameStop. It'll go through periods where it's quiet or like this, but it's
1259.20s:  normally not sustained for significant durations of time. So yeah, I mean, at a really high level
1266.56s:  from an options lens, not a whole lot that I'm seeing that's leading me to think anything specific
1272.88s:  is going on. This is about status quo. The volatility contracting as much as it has that is
1279.60s:  marginally interesting just because volatility tends to carry a bit higher in GameStop. And from a
1285.68s:  technical perspective, long term uptrend defined as three month timeframe plus, but short term
1293.12s:  downtrend as defined one month and within. So we're seeing a divergence short term timeframe
1300.56s:  compared to the long that's normally when we look for capitulation, meaning we try to see where the
1306.80s:  new defined trend is going to lead. So for me, from a technical lens, all eyes are on the short term
1314.72s:  side of the analysis window. And I want to see if either it's going to start rotating through
1321.36s:  and falling below some of those key levels or if it's going to consolidate base out, if it bases,
1328.00s:  that's one thing in and of itself, or if it bases and then starts to resume its appreciation.
1336.48s:  From a business perspective, from a fundamental perspective, GameStop is in a very weird spot.
1345.36s:  And I'll explain what I mean by that. So let's grab GameStop here.
1355.68s:  On bar chart, it's flagged as a buy. That's actually interesting.
1360.08s:  64% buy with weakening short term outlook. Yeah, that sounds, that's fucking funny because we
1369.04s:  literally just essentially re-irrated this exact thing. That's hilarious.
1374.32s:  And let's take a look at some of the fundamentals. I want to specifically look at it
1382.64s:  under the hood. I don't care so much.
1390.16s:  All right, let's.
1396.96s:  Nothing jumping out at me here, like crazy. Let's take a look at how it's doing
1405.04s:  in the general landscape. So this is plotting it against other, quote-unquote, gaming companies.
1412.24s:  It's general competitor list. It's going to be a mix of things. It's not really a direct comparison,
1419.44s:  right? Because pen is similar, but not the same EA. But it gives us an idea of how the industry is
1426.40s:  doing. So if we take a look within the industry of gaming, we can see RSI, SGHC, and SNAL are the
1436.24s:  only ones that are above it on a 52 week timeframe. That's really important because this means even
1442.88s:  though GameStop is having a near-term reversal, the fact that it's performing so well within the
1448.16s:  broader sector and the segment of gaming, that's actually exceedingly telling because it went
1454.80s:  through the squeeze as we saw. But the really cool thing about this is that the squeeze abated,
1464.56s:  right? Like this isn't still pricing from the squeeze. What you see here is actual fundamental
1471.52s:  pricing happening in the stock as compared to what you see here, which is structural factors that
1479.68s:  are driving changes in the stock price that are generally unnatural. A natural meaning it's not
1485.52s:  reflective of the fundamental value of the company. It's reflective of, again, market factors,
1491.28s:  people being short and being caught on the wrong side of that having to buy. It's probably a mix
1497.68s:  of institutions from a hedge fund lens and then also from market makers which induces not just
1504.40s:  a short squeeze but a bit of a gamma element to it. That's what you see here. This is different.
1510.88s:  This is actually a fundamental pricing of the company that's changing, which is good.
1517.52s:  So the fact that it's sustaining this move post squeeze and it's sustaining this placement post
1526.08s:  squeeze is actually really, really good. So all of those things lead me to believe that the company is
1532.96s:  still generally situated well. The problem it has is it needs to do something. Like that's just an
1544.08s:  objective reality. GameStop has to do something. And it's in the process of doing some things, right?
1552.00s:  We can see that it's closing its weaker performing stores. Really smart. And it essentially needs to
1558.56s:  continue down that path of doing something. The reason why the something is so important here is
1565.52s:  because just because GameStop has money. That's great. It needs to do something with the money to
1572.48s:  generate revenue. And I continue to reiterate that point because lots of people will continue to say
1578.16s:  like, Oh man, look at all the interest that they can earn on that money. That interest doesn't
1584.24s:  really matter. It doesn't really matter because people don't right now people don't buy GameStop
1590.96s:  because it's a bank that earns a yield. That's not the business model. The business model is mixed.
1598.40s:  And we're starting to see it branching out into the card grading services and things like that.
1604.00s:  But it needs to continue innovating there in order to sustain a fundamental valuation and a
1609.76s:  fundamental valuation change. That's what it needs. So we're seeing that happening. But
1616.48s:  it still has a ways to go. Now it has lots of ammunition to use. But it needs to do something. So
1625.28s:  that is the Cliff Notes version of where GameStop looks like it is right now. And we will now pivot
1635.76s:  back into the top theories, which is analyzing right now the diamond handbook.
1646.24s:  And book. Let's grab that.
1649.76s:  I'm going to move this out of the way. And then we'll grab it.
1656.72s:  So it looks like we're generally in kind of like a series of AMAs. And this one, let's grab
1667.76s:  where we left off. I know how to do this. I know how to do this. Where are we at?
1675.68s:  360. So now we have Lucy Commissar. I am unfamiliar with Lucy. So I'm going to look her up really fast
1691.28s:  just for my literally just for my general understanding. Lucy.
1695.12s:  The
1696.80s:  Thomas are who looks like a journalist. Is that correct? Or is this
1705.68s:  let me move the chat so I can keep an eye on you guys as I
1709.92s:  looking through. Is that sound correct to you guys though?
1715.20s:  Journalist? If not, that's okay. I just don't know if this person is like well known
1721.44s:  in the community. As you all know, I don't know. But when I look them up, what I see is
1729.12s:  journalist. So I guess we will figure out.
1737.68s:  Yeah, okay. So it looks like there's a thing called the Commissar scoop reports an analysis.
1744.64s:  Oh, whoa. So she has like her own her own thing and it literally talks about
1751.20s:  a lot of capital based things. Secret underbellity of the global financial system of short bank
1764.96s:  and corporate secrecy. This is great. So the reason why I'm taking the time to do this is because
1769.76s:  I'm going to reach out to her and see if she wants to do a podcast at some point. I did the same
1774.80s:  thing before with Susan Trimbeth, who actually responded to me, but I don't think that we
1782.88s:  connected fully on the original email because I think she just looked at like my overall brand
1788.32s:  as like options trading. She was just like, I'm not an option trader. So I'm not sure
1793.12s:  like where my work would overlap. But then I followed up with another email explaining essentially
1798.08s:  this entire segment that we've been doing. So I'm still optimistic that I'll be able to line up
1803.28s:  with Susan at some point. But I'm going to grab an email literally right now and see if I can
1810.48s:  connect with Lucy. Once we go through her work, because I just want to make sure that, you know,
1815.68s:  obviously the work is good. I'm sure it is, but I like to look at the stuff before.
1823.04s:  So it but it looks like she's been in the game for a while, man. This is insane. That's cool.
1831.12s:  So the other thing that looks to be very cool about her work is that it looks like, I mean,
1838.32s:  she's been doing this stuff for a hot minute. And she's in all sorts of stuff, private equity
1847.84s:  abuses, tax evasion, Russia, money laundering. So very, very, very cool. All right. So I found her
1859.68s:  email, but we will keep that pulled up. And then let's go through this AMA and see what we can learn.
1867.92s:  Okay. Out of the ordinary AMA question, let me just skip through all the stuff. Okay.
1882.40s:  This is the first AMA with Lucy commissar. But as many of you know, we are having
1889.20s:  her back in May 24. Okay.
1900.80s:  Oh, Ella. I don't care too much about all this stuff. I just want to get into Lucy's work. Okay.
1911.12s:  Got involved in journalism long time ago. Civil rights movement. Okay. So this is definitely the
1915.20s:  person I'm looking at without a doubt. UPI, writing, Philippines,
1926.32s:  people said the dictator alluded to the country and money on Swiss banks. I thought, what's that all
1931.36s:  about? So you could tell that she started. Man, she's been in all sorts of angles of this stuff.
1941.52s:  This is nuts. Okay. Well, you're telling me as I understand it, that offshore means a
1947.60s:  secrecy haven. So you still have an offshore account in the US. Yes, you can places like Delaware
1954.40s:  Wyoming, they ever they advertise, set up a company. You can't have a bank account. That is
1959.76s:  secret, but you can have a company that is. Yep. That's correct. And for those that don't know
1965.44s:  wealthy people do a lot of stuff with this stuff. And it's for a bunch of different reasons.
1970.24s:  Everybody immediately assumes, you know, it's just to evade taxes and stuff. And there
1974.88s:  are definitely our tax havens in structures like this. I've spent a while working with different
1980.64s:  kinds of attorneys to learn about all this stuff because it's a world that I didn't understand.
1987.92s:  And I spent time learning all about this. And there's a lot of things you can do that are very
1994.72s:  crafty to help optimize both your actual financial picture from attacks optimization standpoint,
2002.48s:  but then also from a just overall robustness perspective, I guess I would say.
2010.48s:  So let's see what else we have here. All right, game stop. Here it is. Well, because of writing
2017.60s:  offshore, I got invited to be in a film which would be called Wall Street conspiracy came out in
2022.00s:  12 when the person called me and talked to the person invited me, I said, I never heard of
2026.16s:  naked short selling. Here we go. Don't worry. We want to talk to you talk to you about offshore
2031.44s:  and how that's linked. And it certainly is linked. But when I went to the studio,
2036.24s:  where people were being interviewed for the film, I met everybody who was involved in fighting
2040.72s:  naked short selling. The man.
2045.52s:  What fucking sucks about this is that this film came out in 20 fucking 12. And we're still talking
2055.20s:  about this shit. So that tells you something huge. That tells you that the people that really like it
2063.44s:  don't want it to fucking go away, which is why it's now 13 years later, a decade and a half.
2072.40s:  And we're having the same fucking conversation. That's disenfranchising. And this is also why
2080.80s:  I reiterate what somebody like Dave Lauer is doing. It's really important because what Dave Lauer
2089.84s:  is doing is such a long drawn out process that is difficult to run all the way to ground.
2101.84s:  And yeah, I don't know. It's just it's a bummer to see that we're literally talking about the same
2107.28s:  as basic shit right now as a decade and a half ago. But thus here we are. So here we go.
2118.88s:  Wes Christian, Suzanne Trimbath, who we're literally talking about, Dr. T.
2123.60s:  Therefore, people in the film, Carl Hagberg. Okay.
2134.80s:  Let's see. I'm just going to look it up directly on YouTube. Well, I'm going to add this to my.
2144.24s:  I don't think we can watch this together. Unfortunately, because the channel will probably,
2148.80s:  the stream will probably get taken down, but we'll read conspiracy.
2159.12s:  And here it is. Wait, there's two of them. Okay, there's a lot of them.
2170.80s:  There's one from front line. And then there's one. I'll drop both of them in here.
2181.04s:  I don't know either of these. I'm just grabbing what I'm seeing. So I can't speak to which one of
2186.40s:  these is the correct one or if they're the same one, I'm not sure. The first one I dropped is from
2191.36s:  a YouTube channel called the Wall Street conspiracy movie. The second one is called Money,
2195.76s:  Power and Wall Street Part One full documentary from Frontline PBS. But I will earmark the
2205.68s:  conspiracy movie, the Wall Street conspiracy movie. I'm actually going to add it really quick
2212.40s:  to a watch list. And then I will work through this personally. And then we
2218.08s:  will see. So let's add this to watch later. And then hopefully I'll be able to share out what
2230.08s:  we can find. All right. I suggest everyone go watch it. My opening, absolutely phenomenal. Let me,
2240.56s:  I'm actually going to see if I can reach out to the people that run this channel.
2248.00s:  There's a website.
2257.20s:  Here I'm going to go to the website. Okay. So the domain is gone.
2266.24s:  Well, damn. I want to go back.
2269.68s:  Imagine it would be terribly boring for you.
2277.60s:  Oh, fuck it. We'll try to do it with audio and see if it works.
2300.48s:  Damn. This is old, man.
2313.92s:  So you guys can see the close captions. I'm just kind of flipping through it.
2319.04s:  Naked short selling. Look at this.
2324.24s:  Oh, it's so.
2348.24s:  I'm going to see if I can.
2363.84s:  Can are you guys able to read that quick? If so, I'll probably speed it up a little bit.
2370.88s:  I'm going to see if I can try to place some of the audio for you guys. I just don't know if it's
2376.24s:  going to drop the stream. I'm unsure.
2383.68s:  But let's see if we can speed this up a little bit.
2406.24s:  So we're still just talking about naked shorting.
2429.44s:  Yeah.
2430.96s:  So this is all just talking about the financial crisis. I mostly want to see the
2437.60s:  this stuff about naked shorting.
2446.24s:  So this is talking about internal users that were leaking information to try to manipulate the price.
2466.24s:  I think we know about this stuff for a stock called Eagle Tech.
2476.64s:  What the fuck? What kind of riddles is that guy talking?
2480.64s:  And you guys picked that up. That dude said whenever you have all the ingredients,
2486.08s:  you're going to bake the cake. And then if the duck wax, you're going to feed the duck.
2494.96s:  And when you get the ducks to quack, you feed them. I honestly can't wait until I'm a
2500.24s:  fucking 85 year old dude that doesn't have to say anything coquir in anymore. And I can just say
2508.56s:  shit like that. That I can just be like, well, the fucking ducks are barking. So I'm going to
2513.60s:  walk the dog. I have to figure out which ones I'm going to use.
2530.96s:  Fun fact, this is essentially how I watch movies too. I just fucking put it on fast speed and
2542.40s:  flip. There's so much shit in there that you don't need.
2549.44s:  Okay.
2556.96s:  Yep.
2558.08s:  Absolutely.
2560.08s:  So this is talking about the basics of short selling. I imagine most of us are familiar with this.
2587.44s:  I
2593.44s:  did not know that. That's brand new news to me. I had no idea that it had to do with the
2598.96s:  tulip market in Holland. But short selling does have a use, which I will continue to remind people
2606.16s:  just in terms of pricing. If if it was actually done correctly, like not this bullshit,
2611.36s:  naked short selling and whatnot, like that, that's nonsense. But short selling itself does have a
2616.08s:  use. Yeah.
2619.36s:  Yeah.
2639.04s:  Which this reflects exactly what we were talking about last week during the last
2645.12s:  episode of this where during the shareholder meetings, we were finding that there were so many
2651.60s:  extra voters people thinking that they had a vote. And it's because of it's literally because of
2656.16s:  this. So this it's all all just connecting those dots.
2675.20s:  Yeah.
2686.48s:  Fucking sound familiar. They're saying that when they looked at all the shares being sold that
2693.28s:  there were too many shares being sold. Wouldn't it be weird? Wouldn't it be just absolutely bizarre?
2703.60s:  If somehow there was a way for a company to have in excess of 100% short interest,
2715.12s:  wouldn't that be absolutely insane if that could happen because you would think it's only possible
2723.36s:  to short what's there? So the idea that maybe there's too many shorts, you know,
2733.12s:  I don't know, maybe I'm just going off the reservation here, but it almost seems as if it shouldn't
2740.00s:  be a thing for there to actually be excess shares being sold short. I don't know.
2763.92s:  Don't worry. What he's saying is people that are in Wall Street institutions, brokers,
2778.96s:  market makers, they're all the fucking same humans you are. He's doing hold and pray, which is never
2785.36s:  a good vibe. So anytime you feel bad about yourself doing something on the stock market, don't worry,
2791.44s:  there's people with glasses that are brokers doing the same shit.
2809.92s:  Huh, that's kind of selfish. I hope on the way back the plane doesn't make it.
2817.20s:  It just feels like that impacts other people not just yourself.
2821.44s:  Yeah, we don't need all this.
2845.84s:  So it's talking about the DTCC and the function of the DTCC.
2851.44s:  I feel like all of you have gotten primed enough to the one and a half time speed. I think we
2877.20s:  can bump it up, right? Normally, I'm at like two and a quarter. So this is still like glacial.
2884.08s:  So let's see if we can do 175.
2899.92s:  Crazy. The thing that I want to make sure that you guys are connecting are the elements that
2904.96s:  we're tying from all these other pieces, coalescing in multiple spots. When we're trying to
2911.52s:  piece together the truth, the reality, how things actually are. One of the elements that's really
2917.44s:  important is objective analysis. But part of that objective analysis is seeing how many things
2924.08s:  tend to line up. This is now the unearthed version of this exact thing that we've heard from a bunch
2932.56s:  of different sources from a bunch of different vectors. That tells me something important.
2937.28s:  That tells me there's something behind what the fuck they're talking about.
2953.84s:  This is the phantom share issue. The funny thing about the phantom share issue.
2959.60s:  This is what I find so curious about it. If I were a stockholder, long term stockholder,
2967.68s:  I own the stock, I might vote as a shareholder. What I find so interesting is that there are that
2975.28s:  many entities that are choosing to vote so much so that you can clearly see that there's an
2982.40s:  excess over what should be being received in terms of votes. That's just curious to me.
2990.88s:  I don't fully understand the motivation behind the additional entities for the voting.
2996.24s:  The basic answer might be people thinking that it could be them trying to make bad decisions to
3002.08s:  vote it into the ground, but you're not really going to be able to accomplish that through a shareholder
3005.68s:  voting. That would have to be done through much more specific avenues. I got to pop the door for
3013.12s:  Thorik, because Mel just...
3025.76s:  He's pacing back and forth with whimpering, so we got to hook him up.
3030.24s:  When I say whimpering, that's his war cry, by the way. There's no whimpering around here,
3035.52s:  not in this household. All right, let's go.
3053.20s:  What?
3053.68s:  What a fucking response. I understand part of their point, right? When you're working with
3062.32s:  really massive systems to have everything line up and zero out is very difficult. I do get that,
3069.76s:  but I feel like there at least has to be a reasonable level of tolerance, like at least.
3078.72s:  So what a fucking response.
3083.20s:  Yeah.
3108.32s:  If I have a chance to talk with Susan, I want to show her this clip.
3132.96s:  I actually need to save this clip.
3138.72s:  The reason why I want to save this clip is because the fact... She, like, this is shock
3144.96s:  inception. She was shocked in what, mid-2000s, that 10 years ago this ship was coming up, mid-2000s.
3155.28s:  What is the response going to look like when we have a chance to talk about it in
3162.48s:  Motherfuck in 2025? What's the response going to be? Oh, damn, this is nuts.
3171.84s:  Well, yeah, I forgot. I got to update our timestamps because we started watching our show.
3178.16s:  What time do we start this thing at? Like 50, 53 minutes in.
3186.64s:  The wall, greet, and speedy movie review.
3195.60s:  I'm going to have to start crowdsourcing people to help me keep up with these fucking timestamps.
3199.52s:  I keep forgetting.
3208.08s:  You
3238.16s:  You
3240.16s:  You
3266.72s:  That's fucking crazy.
3270.16s:  You
3295.44s:  That's kind of fun.
3300.16s:  You
3302.16s:  You
3322.72s:  I like this sign guy
3329.04s:  Big fan of the sign guy
3333.12s:  You
3339.12s:  Oh, back to Eagle Tech
3362.32s:  You
3373.60s:  Whoa
3383.12s:  So this is talking about seller boxing
3392.16s:  You
3423.04s:  So this is
3425.12s:  Essentially just talking about seller boxing and like a quick recap of the incentive behind that is that if you can get a company to go bankrupt
3433.20s:  Then you have a much better tax picture from the short side of that trade. So this is a way to make money from two different sides of the trade like pretty seamlessly
3444.80s:  So really really interesting. I'm going to earmark where we're at in this so that we can come back to it
3451.04s:  I don't want to spend the whole session on it
3454.56s:  Let me grab a link to where we leave off right here at like 25 minutes
3460.64s:  And then we'll come back to this because I want to finish going through the the AMA at least for Lucy before we
3468.08s:  Before we wrap up
3469.60s:  So let me move this out of the way and then let's get back
3474.48s:  To the diamond handbook
3477.92s:  58
3481.84s:  All right
3486.72s:  All right
3491.84s:  All right
3500.24s:  Ah
3503.20s:  Okay, I'd like to show you how the offshore system really does connect with naked short selling
3511.20s:  It's about this adona story
3514.16s:  started 20 years ago
3515.92s:  software company based in king of pressure, Pennsylvania. That's a confusing place
3521.68s:  Who's starting out want to do expand in IB
3525.20s:  That dude was working with the company called that company
3529.76s:  That he could help finance their growth that company was owned by corporate raiders carl icon and benefit
3536.56s:  Bennett LeBelle interesting that she calls icon a corporate raider
3540.48s:  Find that curious the deal was
3544.16s:  That dude was gonna get sedona to and a half million dollar deal located investors sell shares to them
3548.96s:  Lenders would be paid back with the loans come do
3551.76s:  um would be converted to shares
3553.92s:  So you have a loan that would be promised to pay or shares the amount of shares depend on the stock price
3558.80s:  At the time of conversion this would become called death spiral financing
3564.56s:  So and then this is I guess where offshore and naked short selling interest to picture
3572.40s:  These dudes had a company called rhino advisors. That's a sick ass name
3577.44s:  There would be intermediaries working with sedona and the man from
3581.76s:  Fallmen they were working with an offshore fund called amro international
3587.04s:  registered in Panama based in Zurich the offshore
3591.36s:  Places ladenberg investors included the bat liner group
3594.80s:  Both anybody did some due diligence. They would find that herber bat liner. That's a fucking hell of a name too
3600.24s:  or
3601.44s:  99 German intelligence report was in the business of laundering elicit funds
3606.80s:  The US prosecutors told the Colorado trial and federal court that bat liner had been handling money for a prominent Latin American drug dealer
3613.68s:  To the contract with amro
3617.52s:  Said no shorting because shorting would push down the price of shares
3622.00s:  And the less shares were worth when it came time to convert them the more the stock amro would get
3628.56s:  But the baddies went to work
3631.84s:  Fuck this is convoluted
3636.24s:  I need a diagram
3637.84s:  When sedona signed the deal with
3640.56s:  Thalman in 2000 shares were at six
3644.72s:  Every time the mic company made a good deal good news
3648.64s:  They're sure as went down and they couldn't figure out why
3653.20s:  Turned out that the baddies were shorting the sale through an electronic communications network
3658.64s:  That allowed the seller to hide
3661.68s:  And a month before the conversions
3664.32s:  Baddie and told the brokers at the infamously corrupt now defunged new york brokerage called
3671.04s:  refco to start selling sedona stock short from an account at an offshore refco affiliate
3677.76s:  Jesus
3679.76s:  So refco is not a fly by night had four billion and
3683.52s:  200,000 customer accounts largest broker on the cme in a month they pushed the price of shares down from six to one
3691.84s:  Now baddie and told the brokers keep selling use unbridled levels of aggression
3697.28s:  Now the key thing to that I'm king into here is
3701.28s:  How this is a coordinated
3704.00s:  effort
3704.96s:  The ability for one entity even with four billion to do something is limited
3709.92s:  That's the beautiful part about segmented markets
3714.16s:  The problem is that so many of them are in a similar position trying to do similar things
3719.60s:  That we run into this problem where these motherfuckers
3722.80s:  Have a bunch of friends and they just call up their friends. We like you know that you do this
3726.72s:  Which is crazy? It's crazy that this is so colluded
3734.72s:  And it
3736.00s:  Raises an even more important point as far as I'm concerned
3740.00s:  Which is with the amount of collusion that we see
3744.00s:  The fact that and how pervasive it is
3747.60s:  When things start to get that big they become known
3751.76s:  Right, so think of when you think of when you consider like old-school mob bosses
3759.92s:  The entire neighborhood knows who the mob boss is the cops know who the mob like
3765.44s:  All these different entities know
3768.24s:  What's going on who it is and who's involved
3771.52s:  But they don't do things about it for a litany of different reasons
3776.32s:  The curious thing about this is
3780.00s:  With something this significant and coordinated and to be clear
3783.52s:  I'm not talking about just this one instance. I'm talking about this happening across different companies
3789.28s:  It's really shocking that there hadn't been enough that would come out
3796.08s:  And start to challenge it and
3799.20s:  I'm saying that partially tongue in cheek the reality is most of that probably was coming out in different places
3805.20s:  Journalists reaching out those kinds of things, but nothing was happening the fact nothing was happening tells you again
3811.68s:  The alignment of the incentive structure
3818.32s:  Weird
3821.04s:  Because every dollar that you sell is a dollar in my pocket price fell
3824.96s:  75 cents than it fall fell to 10 cents
3828.64s:  Lauren says why people are so passionate about GameStop
3832.96s:  I
3835.12s:  agree with you to a degree
3837.44s:  The reason why I say that is because I think a lot of people in GameStop and again, this is my just general observation
3846.00s:  I think a lot of people in GameStop have a very casual relationship with it
3850.80s:  And if we were to ask the majority of people that are involved in the stock like if they could describe these elements
3858.64s:  I'm dubious that they could
3860.96s:  I think a lot of people would essentially be able to frame it as
3864.96s:  The stock should have gone up more and it didn't so the game is rigged
3868.88s:  And I do think that that happens to partially be the correct conclusion here
3873.20s:  But I think it's missing a lot of details and I think that the
3878.16s:  The main reason why people are upset about that are not necessarily because they're
3883.04s:  So concerned about the efficiency and the fairness of the the market as a whole
3887.84s:  But I think a lot of people are just frustrated that they didn't get their money now maybe that's too
3894.16s:  dystopian of me to think of it that way
3896.88s:  But the reason why I say that is because with how long this thing has been going on for
3903.92s:  A lot of things could have been done if people cared about it from the perspective of
3911.28s:  I care about markets being fair and I say that because
3917.12s:  What Dave Lauer is doing with Dave Lauer is doing by filing that lawsuit
3922.40s:  That's a lot of work
3924.16s:  But that's also putting his money where his mouth is that's not cheap the fund
3929.44s:  So there could have been people if we were really really genuinely interested in fairness of markets
3935.68s:  We would have banned it together crowdsource funding to hire a legal team to then try and start a lawsuit
3942.88s:  But I think for the majority of people it's way more casual than that
3946.16s:  And I'm not saying that that's bad
3947.76s:  I'm just saying that I don't actually think
3950.80s:  The depth of people look at it from oh, I want this to be fair. I think a lot of it is
3957.28s:  People didn't get the outcome that they wanted they're upset about it and I get that but I just think it's a little deeper than that
3966.88s:  Rob says I put 30,000 in as a protest they are shutting the truckers down and freezing bank accounts physical protests don't work
3975.28s:  I mean, I guess that
3978.80s:  There's I mean, there's a lot to that right? I think your
3982.24s:  ability to protest however you want I think it's fair right so you doing it that way I think is okay
3987.92s:  And I think to try to figure out what you want the impact of your action to be is also really really important
3997.52s:  But I think
3999.92s:  When we say like they're shutting the truckers down and freezing bank accounts
4003.04s:  That part I'm not positive what that's in reference to more broadly. I need more details and like who they are
4009.92s:  It's just another dangerous thing that we do
4012.56s:  When we're upset about something when we don't like something we generalize it really really broadly versus keeping it very specific to who the entities are
4020.64s:  Um, so yeah, just a couple thoughts on that but let's see
4024.08s:  Other baddies they've been doing in a month represented 40% of all trades
4028.80s:  Somebody should have been looking to start trying to figure out what's going on conversion left Sedona still out of 2.5 million loans
4034.56s:  Owing 1.9
4036.88s:  They would have to issue more shares because they would end up letting baddies control the company
4041.28s:  Okay
4042.56s:  So in the start of February they had 77 employees 65 clients that wanted the software IBM contract 7 million financing
4049.76s:  When the stock tanked they lost business couldn't get other financing and had a fire people
4056.48s:  So Sedona finally went to the SEC justice department they were looking what's going on they charged Andreas in a criminal case, but he jumped
4064.16s:  He jumped sale and went to Vienna
4066.80s:  Austria doesn't have treaty with the US that where somebody is miscreant and a financial crime you can't demand that person so there's no extra
4073.68s:  Diction yeah
4077.60s:  Okay
4079.60s:  More moved by them
4081.60s:  So Thomas baddie and unrino have settled with the SEC for 1 million without admitting guilt
4086.24s:  But they did not sue any of them
4090.32s:  In May of 03 that's when was Christian got involved he filed a civil suit against ladenburg thalmin
4097.84s:  And some others okay, so I'm taking a pause here because I need to email this lady
4103.12s:  So now that I understand a little bit more of her work and more what she's talking about
4108.00s:  I 100%
4110.24s:  Want to see if I can try and get her on the podcast because the thing I'm most curious about from her perspective is
4117.84s:  Based on what she was looking at this amount of time ago
4122.32s:  What does she think about where we are today and where we are now
4127.04s:  Genuinely interested in that. So let me email Lucy
4132.00s:  I'm literally emailing her right now. So I'm saying hey Lucien team my name is Eric
4143.28s:  I run a youtube channel
4148.48s:  Trading and have been diving into the game stop story
4154.88s:  For about
4157.92s:  six months now
4160.32s:  Came across your work in in AMA on credit
4167.52s:  regarding
4170.88s:  The offshore component and tie to make it shorting
4178.32s:  I'd love to chat with you sometime
4181.84s:  If you'd be willing
4185.92s:  To hop on a podcast
4190.80s:  You understand your perspective of the evolution
4200.16s:  Thanks for you
4204.56s:  Cool email send so we'll see I would I would really really like you be able to talk to her
4212.08s:  Uh
4213.04s:  Lauren says you assume people know how to crowdsource and get an attorney not everyone understands that world so they bought shares in hell
4220.00s:  Yeah, and and I think that that's also huge right and I also think that the retail trader in doing that
4227.36s:  Actually did find a way to to your broader point
4230.56s:  To to protest and specifically regarding this individual ticker
4235.76s:  My comment was more so that I think it's tied mostly to the individuals and their individual
4242.48s:  Financial relationship with that ticker and just less so from the perspective of
4247.20s:  Because of my interaction with this ticker. I now can clearly see that there are
4252.48s:  Clear elements of manipulation in the broader market
4255.92s:  And I want to do something about that for the broader market and broader market fairness
4260.96s:  And I think if we came to that second conclusion then even though
4266.24s:  Individuals might not know where to start
4268.80s:  That's the cool part about the internet. It's crowdsourced if you go through superstar
4272.80s:  You're going to find every walk of life every kind of person that's on there. I'm sure that there's attorneys on there directly realistically
4284.08s:  A tcm says I think most jm e shareholders are fairly well informed such as knowing that
4289.20s:  Knowing what seed and co and we're and where most traders that to admit
4293.84s:  Jesus Eric sounded out
4296.00s:  Seed and co is where most traders I talked to have never heard of anything like it in that they don't actually hold shares only
4302.80s:  Beneficials. Yeah, so I think tcm you're
4307.12s:  You're comparing another element that I fully agree with
4310.40s:  Because when we look at game stop game stop for the people that remain really close to the story
4317.44s:  Absolutely will know more about all of these different kind of inner workings
4321.28s:  It's one of the reasons why I'm so fascinated because it's helping me learn more about a lot of these inner working
4326.72s:  So I fully agree with you
4328.80s:  Compared to like that the standard trader because from the perspective of a standard trader most of this stuff honestly doesn't impact the day to day business
4337.20s:  That they're trying to run
4338.72s:  But yeah, I couldn't agree more that's game stop is one of and I don't think it's just game stop
4344.88s:  I think the people over at AMC I know way less about that story
4348.80s:  I haven't spent a lot of time on that specifically
4351.28s:  But I can absolutely see correlaries between them. So yeah fully fully agree
4357.20s:  This swag says my goal is to grow the shares
4360.00s:  I'm unsure if that's a protest, but it feels good to have an opportunity to learn. Yeah, that's good
4365.76s:  And
4366.88s:  For for you day swag. I mean, whether you do it in protest or out of not protest
4371.92s:  It doesn't it's whatever whatever is best for you right and whatever however you want to treat it whatever the activity means to you
4380.08s:  So yeah, that's awesome. I love that. That's that's been one of my favorite things about game stop is I'm now understanding way more broadly
4388.24s:  the
4389.60s:  perspective of like entities like this
4393.28s:  That I would have been otherwise unaware of so yeah
4397.92s:  These Sam says the community actually try to crowdsource west christian the guy collected the money stole it and went crown and then crowdsourcing was banned
4408.80s:  That's crazy
4411.76s:  I imagine there has my guesses there has to be more to that story than that. I just have to
4417.76s:  That would be my original perspective on that
4420.72s:  but I am
4422.96s:  Really curious tcm if you have any do you have any documentation posts anything like that related to it
4430.64s:  It's just so interesting to me because it seems like that dude west
4434.32s:  christian is
4438.08s:  It seems like they're trying to help
4443.68s:  So that that would just be utterly shocking to me if they stole the money from
4448.16s:  The
4450.16s:  The gme community
4452.24s:  Not saying it didn't happen. I'm just so curious about it
4457.36s:  Dayswag is letting Lauren know that Lauren is day swags
4462.32s:  Ween if you guys don't know we have a love affair in in and it's brought by game stop isn't that beautiful we have now
4472.88s:  A game stop maybe Cohen can do the wedding or something
4476.96s:  But we we literally have a game stop love affair that we all get to be
4482.72s:  A part of and support
4484.96s:  So I love if nothing else comes from all of my time looking at all this game stop stuff
4492.88s:  This is this is the win. This is the win for us
4498.00s:  all right
4499.76s:  so
4501.92s:  This is when lawyer was christian got involved file civil suit against them
4507.36s:  Judge swain in New York heard the sue in over nine years
4510.64s:  Blocked the suit by not ruling on the very first key motion never allowed so don't have to get discovery
4518.00s:  Which would have given them the documentation needed dismiss mostly defendants including central figures
4525.44s:  So so don't install in business trading less than a penny share what are the lessons major companies such as
4530.00s:  Layton Berg may enable fraudsters the s sc and the courts do not provide protection to the victims
4535.20s:  I think we can see that
4536.48s:  The don't it was taken down an oh one when s sc passed reg show
4540.24s:  Which was to deal with negative short selling which we know didn't fix it
4543.84s:  Oh for the included massive loop holes facilitated naked shorting yep game stop
4549.68s:  um
4552.96s:  If for example ignored fails that didn't happen in public exchanges the baddie and had moved trades through canada crazy
4559.76s:  But it's the
4562.80s:  Uh, they've actually put out a paper saying this only refers to trades on exchanges
4567.60s:  Ah
4568.80s:  This doesn't include when you call it nobody knows what's happening in canada or some other places are not providing information and dark pools
4575.76s:  And again, I'm not sure if this is actually dark pools or if she means internalization here
4581.52s:  So they did not take the lesson west christian told me that more than 1200 hedge funds and offshore accounts
4586.80s:  We're working through more than 150 broker dealers that's fucking easy
4590.88s:  That's fucking crazy
4596.96s:  Hey um
4600.96s:  Hey
4608.80s:  If these people end up leaving the country and going to someplace like austria then it's too bad so sad kind of thing is that correct
4615.36s:  That's correct
4617.36s:  So they're they're talking about people's ability to flee and avoid extradition one note here is it's not necessarily too bad so sad
4625.20s:  It just means that
4627.36s:  Justice might be delayed because the reality is is that if they ever want to try to go through the us or any
4634.48s:  Other entity like associated with us in any significant way
4638.56s:  They're running a risk
4640.16s:  So one of the things to keep in mind although
4644.08s:  It's not pure justice and it's not ideal
4646.96s:  But it is something at least to be aware of is that
4650.48s:  For these people when they flee to somewhere like austria
4654.48s:  You can still live a life you can be fine. It's not terrible
4657.92s:  But you do have a target on your back
4661.12s:  And if you're trying to go somewhere through the us at any point you essentially can't
4666.56s:  So if you have family friends anything like that that's all gone
4669.84s:  All that go and then you now have to adopt a entirely new life rear at again
4674.40s:  I'm not saying that it's terrible
4675.92s:  I'm not saying that they won't get by and that it's not fine
4678.56s:  I'm just saying that it's not exactly like just get off scot free and everything's fine
4683.12s:  There's still this thing looming over you that you still have to navigate quite literally for the rest of your life
4690.56s:  For instance, they went after the baddie encadement for one million they file legal complaints
4694.96s:  What about lit it it it it they don't go after the big players
4697.44s:  So then speaking of low hanging through low hanging through
4702.64s:  Um
4704.72s:  If the scc won't go anything want to anything when it comes to manipulation what
4710.16s:  What ways that companies that as well as shareholders can do to fight against the manipulation
4716.24s:  Okay
4718.24s:  Bringing cases federal court even if they get to a certain level they might be knocked out because certain cases the judges rule only the sccs jurisdiction
4726.08s:  federal courts not useful
4728.40s:  Started going at state courts you can get discovery find out where the bodies are
4732.40s:  Fuck yeah always looking for some bodies give me one sec. I got to pop the door for door
4738.88s:  Take a look at
4755.92s:  You
4757.92s:  Look at you guys it's like chat inception you can see what I look at this is how I respond to you guys
4763.44s:  Is I just keeping eyeball on this thing in case you were wondering fun fact
4767.68s:  Okay, so
4773.04s:  They're talking about the discovery process which is fucking brutal then go through everything um
4782.08s:  Okay
4785.04s:  Game stop was able to reach a price 344 till journalist wrote negative articles stated that the price game stopped
4791.20s:  Which stated that the game
4799.68s:  So this looks like
4803.44s:  Laurence's I'm happy you have it on live chat not top chat top chat as the devil
4807.20s:  I sometimes I remember to put it on live chat. I don't always but
4812.80s:  Thankfully our streams are small enough that I can pretty much keep up with everybody
4816.64s:  I think it gets really difficult if like it's like a really big stream
4820.88s:  I imagine that's like a different problem. Hopefully that's a problem. We'll have to deal with that some point in the future as you get more people involved in this stuff
4828.24s:  But right now it's not
4831.36s:  Well, let's see
4834.48s:  Journalist wrote negative articles
4837.28s:  I'd like for that's a good way to get another story which specifically deals with journalists
4843.52s:  Egyptian pretended to be Italian San Diego
4847.92s:  Wait, is this actually San Diego here or is this a different thing
4858.88s:  I'm assuming that's actually where I'm at because I'm in San Diego so I'm wondering if this is actually San Diego
4863.76s:  You 100 hedge funds that remembers pain of three to six are much for the privilege of being on the website who are we gonna hit next I see
4876.96s:  Mr. Pink that's a fun. Yeah, that's a fun name
4885.20s:  Um
4887.36s:  I'm just skimming through this just a lot of fucking she's doing a great job giving a ton of backstory
4899.28s:  But it's a ton of backstory
4903.28s:  So Kirshan on tape to the broker we have journalists on the take
4906.80s:  Kirshan had gone to Aruba Rubas sick by the way really good diving there
4910.80s:  It got in cards you can load with money 25 to a bank card that someone can use at ATM or using these cards to pay journalists
4920.48s:  Yeah, okay
4923.04s:  The interesting thing is I'm actually really curious like how impactful
4927.28s:  The journalists are on on the price. I imagine
4931.28s:  I mean you have to imagine like fairly impactful if mother fuckers like Kramer are still in business and stuff
4937.28s:  I've never done any sort of a study on
4940.64s:  I did do a small study on Hindenburg research
4944.24s:  But I've not done a broader study on like journalists and journalist impact on prices. I wonder if there's anything like that
4959.76s:  Oh gindi cases definitive proof been manipulation by media they're paid to do that
4967.44s:  Yeah, I mean this is you would think that the media is supposed to be unbiased and objective
4972.48s:  Maybe this is just because this is older
4974.96s:  I can't imagine anybody has actually thought this for decades genuinely. I don't think anybody
4981.52s:  I'm 30 how fucking old am I 33
4985.60s:  They're about to be 34. I don't know how 33 at 34 and
4990.72s:  this
4992.88s:  I mean I can't think of anybody in my generation
4996.96s:  That actually thinks the media is
5000.40s:  unbiased and objective
5004.40s:  I can't imagine that that's been the case what since like maybe the I don't even know like the 50s what the perception was
5010.16s:  I wasn't really around back then
5012.24s:  but
5013.28s:  I do think that there was a point in time maybe maybe it's just us church and it up and you know thinking about a better time that maybe didn't exist
5020.24s:  But I thought that there was a period in time where like journalist to integrity was actually like a really really important thing
5027.20s:  And was much more widely consumed
5030.56s:  So this is just interesting so it just can't imagine anybody actually thinks that today
5039.92s:  Hey video
5043.28s:  Jim Kramer good old Jimmy Kramer
5050.16s:  Do you believe major media outlets have been compromised? We know that I don't think that's much of a
5054.40s:  Do you believe it's possible that large institutions compensate media outlets of course
5062.08s:  Yeah, of course
5064.40s:  Here's another thing for those that don't know and I'm not looking to go too far down like the tin foil rabbit hole and all that kind of stuff
5071.68s:  But if you look at who are some of the largest
5075.20s:  purchasers and sponsors of media
5078.72s:  Who are the largest corporate
5084.72s:  You know
5086.72s:  sponsors
5089.04s:  Of
5091.04s:  news and media
5099.04s:  Let's see now I don't want to know the biggest
5109.92s:  Or donors
5112.88s:  And news media
5116.88s:  Let's see
5121.12s:  These are federal
5130.00s:  Lawrence is the government
5132.00s:  Um, I don't think so let's see I'm actually going to see if chat you be taking help of self
5139.12s:  Research
5142.32s:  What companies
5146.72s:  Are the largest donors and sponsors to
5153.76s:  US-based news and or media
5160.64s:  Let's see
5172.08s:  It's actually kind of nuts how difficult is to find this I don't actually think that that's
5182.48s:  I don't actually think that that's um happenstance
5192.24s:  So one of them is Pfizer
5196.88s:  The
5201.04s:  Interesting thing about Pfizer is when you're watching you know sports media you'll see it a lot on sports media
5210.32s:  We'll say presented by or in partnership with
5213.92s:  But you'll see that
5216.48s:  Pop up every once in a while and you always find that interesting because it's like yeah, you don't actually see a lot of advertisements there by that company
5223.68s:  so then
5227.04s:  What's going on and I think a lot of it is this
5232.08s:  I think it's this that exact kind of thing if and I'm not gonna
5236.96s:  relegate it to Pfizer, but like if I'm a big company and I want to maintain a decent name brand
5242.80s:  I don't have to advertise
5244.32s:  But what I could do is I can donate to your media company and just ask you don't write shit about me
5249.76s:  You don't have to promote me. Just don't write anything or if you're gonna write something write something that's decent
5255.12s:  So I think that we all know that that kind of thing is
5259.44s:  Um like pretty profound at this
5262.56s:  In addition, how can regular consumer differentiate between trusted sources and compromise outlets? Fuck that's a I don't think the way
5277.36s:  Yeah, so it's just talking about something that's built up over time
5281.28s:  The only thing I can recommend from this perspective
5284.88s:  Is to try and look at stuff from multiple sources and not multiple of the same sources
5292.08s:  I actually try to look at stuff from what I would consider to be opposing sources
5297.20s:  So if there's a piece of news that I'm trying to read
5299.52s:  I'll literally look for the article on CNN and then I will look for the article on something like Fox
5304.56s:  And I will look at both of their slants on it
5308.24s:  The good part about both of their slants is that we know their slants right it's not like
5313.04s:  Any subtext you that you have to pick up. It's gonna be like abundantly clear the disposition as you're writing it
5318.72s:  But
5319.92s:  I continually try to find really really
5323.52s:  objective sources of news and I struggle with it so hard believe it or not. That's actually one of my absolute
5331.44s:  favorite reasons
5333.44s:  Why I like
5335.60s:  I like finance so much because finance really does a good job at
5341.76s:  Getting rid of all of the excess bullshit around stuff and there's also another thing that I'll tell you guys about that
5348.72s:  I do like it's called
5352.48s:  It's loading right now hold on
5356.24s:  It's called ground news
5359.12s:  I don't know if you guys are familiar with ground news
5361.04s:  But I like that a lot too ground news is pretty decent and
5366.72s:  The the thing about ground news is it kind of just shows a little bit of different perspectives which
5374.80s:  I like and it kind of
5376.80s:  Helps make it a little more clear what the perspectives are
5381.12s:  so
5383.76s:  Yeah overall I think it's a bit challenging though to find
5389.12s:  And
5390.16s:  Actually good objective information, but it is what it is
5396.56s:  Cool let's continue here
5400.64s:  Yeah, okay
5402.64s:  Motley Fool Market Watch
5406.40s:  Yeah, okay
5408.80s:  Evidence after the mechley. Yeah
5411.20s:  You'd like to know your opinion on mainstream media for a cmbc coverage of game stop. Oh, I like this one
5421.84s:  I agree with your distrust and because of what I haven't watched television 20 30 years
5427.20s:  I don't have a working TV. This is funny. I do it. I do have a working TV
5430.32s:  But I don't watch TV either literally zero
5433.20s:  So I identify much with Lucy here
5436.56s:  And when there are hearings go to the website committee
5439.04s:  So I would not trust any of these places. I agree
5443.28s:  So a quick way to stop being deceived is by avoiding the media. Yeah
5448.64s:  Yep
5453.84s:  I liked that
5460.64s:  Oh, what is this
5465.04s:  So they're talking about like the ignorance of elected officials
5467.92s:  I don't think that's all
5471.68s:  I don't think that's like a big big surprise a lot of them too. We I think it's important to remember as a bunch of them are gonna have
5479.92s:  They're own perspectives and stuff right and because they have to represent constituents
5486.16s:  I
5494.24s:  Elected official who's saying
5497.12s:  Has unverified information on qualified sources. What do you make of that? I mean, I don't actually think that that's
5504.24s:  inaccurate
5507.36s:  This is this is completely accurate
5510.08s:  But I also don't think it's fair to bubble up the sources as just this
5517.44s:  But I think it's completely fair to say all of these even regular news everything has unverified information
5524.40s:  Unqualified sources like I think that that's a fair statement actually
5528.80s:  But I understand Lucy's broader point is that
