0.48s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.28s: before the live stream later today we
4.72s: had a bit of a mixed bag so although
7.04s: Futures are now up slightly we saw the
10.76s: S&P 500 down tick just a little bit and
14.80s: a couple things unfolded here first
16.48s: thing is xlre real estate fell off a
19.68s: cliff here so did XLV and I referred to
22.64s: these for the sectors not the ticker
24.40s: itself so obviously real estate
27.08s: Healthcare and then we have xlp
31.12s: Staples and interestingly enough we see
34.12s: technology ticking up a little bit this
35.80s: is actually because Nvidia has hit
38.16s: all-time highs which we're going to take
39.36s: a look at today so I want to spend a
41.80s: minute just talking about the market in
43.88s: a broader sense here because there's a
46.28s: really interesting Trend that's going on
48.88s: one of them is notice how many of these
52.16s: sectors are red and how many of them are
56.12s: green all of them are red the only one
59.44s: that's green is Tech there's almost an
62.24s: inverse relationship at this point
64.40s: between the rest of these sectors in
66.84s: Tech now it's not purely inverse I'm
69.48s: using it in pretty Loosely here but I am
72.56s: highlighting that there's a clear
74.80s: breakdown in the relationship between
76.76s: these now if we take a look at Nvidia
80.36s: Nvidia just hit a high of 14371 and it
84.44s: is pinned there so if we go out all the
87.00s: way we are hovering literally at alltime
90.04s: highs and they have earnings coming up
93.16s: soon which is really interesting their
95.84s: earnings is slated for the 20th of
100.44s: November so really strong behavior in
103.88s: Tech if we take a look through the rest
106.68s: of the tech sector specifically we'll
108.56s: look at Information Technology Nvidia
111.24s: really leading everybody here but Apple
114.24s: was also up AMD was also up but we can
116.68s: see that there's a little bit of a
118.16s: breakdown in relationship between
119.48s: something like Nvidia and Micron which
122.64s: is interesting to watch that's stuff
124.68s: that I typically will try to look to
126.52s: play even Intel's playing along a little
128.56s: bit here so this broad Market rally is
133.28s: continuing but it does look like it's
136.44s: starting to consolidate a little bit and
138.36s: the performance of these sectors is
139.76s: going to become increasingly important
141.96s: as we're hovering around highs here I
144.32s: personally come in I Look to set alerts
147.08s: something below this consolidation low
149.04s: because right now I'm long S&P futures
151.44s: and if we start dropping below there I'm
154.04s: going to look to start exiting out until
156.68s: we finish this consolidation and then
158.44s: try to get back in during the next move
160.56s: this is the same thing I'm doing in some
162.20s: stuff like Russell even crude oil I
164.44s: re-entered a trade yesterday because
167.12s: crude oil has been um running pretty
170.28s: hard and it had a great day today and it
174.00s: looks like it might want to continue the
175.56s: rally so the market is definitely still
178.44s: in this uh bit of a a holding pattern we
182.40s: holding right near highs which is really
184.28s: good to see but it's everybody's still
187.40s: waiting for the shoe to drop now
189.20s: speaking of the shoe to drop if we take
191.24s: a look quickly at the FED watch tool I
193.32s: won't hurt your eyes with that one first
194.92s: we'll start with this but we can see
197.64s: that the probability of a 50 bips cut
200.04s: used to be over 50% now it's literally
202.72s: zero it's completely gone and it's not
204.20s: come back we're actually seeing an
207.16s: increase in the probability of no cut
210.36s: so on the 18th of October this was
212.60s: around 9 9.61% now it's at 13 it was as
215.68s: high as 16.4 within the last week so
219.88s: what's going on here it's a great
222.20s: question but what this broadly tells me
225.12s: is that the market does not have a firm
228.28s: footing on how to think about this
231.16s: upcoming meeting what the expectations
233.00s: are because we continue to see this
235.68s: glorious mix of Market data flowing
239.40s: through
240.36s: that causes a little bit of pause now
243.32s: this coming week we have a few things on
245.16s: the docket series of different fed
248.20s: speakers happening you know we had a
250.68s: couple today we have a few tomorrow we
253.16s: have home sales on the 23rd we have
255.92s: crude oil inventories which again this
257.68s: is typically an important metric but I
259.40s: think we already have a decent idea of
261.92s: what's going on here the beige book has
263.84s: not been as impactful lately as it has
266.28s: been in other periods of time so it's
268.40s: something to be aware of but nothing to
270.32s: overweight too heavily jobless claims
272.68s: this is kind of a big deal PMI very big
275.40s: deal because as we continue to get
277.52s: different kinds of economic data
279.32s: specifically things that show economic
281.40s: strength that moves the probability of a
284.00s: cut further and further away the FED is
287.44s: kind of working off of the luxury of
290.04s: time that they have afforded to them
291.48s: right now because the economy continues
293.56s: to show so resilient and the fact that
296.00s: this is an election year on top of that
298.40s: really makes things even more
300.40s: interesting in my opinion so that's the
304.56s: broad swath of what's Happening up to
307.04s: the 24th we go to the 25th we can see
309.40s: that there's durable goods consumer
311.16s: sentiment from Michigan these are
313.32s: typically pretty important from
315.88s: understanding the consumer standpoint of
317.88s: things because right now we do see the
319.52s: consumer is relying more on credit and
322.84s: we're starting to see defaults not
324.60s: massively nothing you know losing our
326.68s: minds but there is a Reliance on Def on
330.00s: credit leading to defaults which that's
332.28s: not exactly a ideal
334.88s: look the other thing that we have going
337.40s: on right now that's worth touching on
340.12s: quickly is earnings so if we come back
343.36s: here and we grab the calendar we can see
346.12s: that today we had nue that was reporting
349.76s: after the market we have a bunch
351.16s: reporting tomorrow before after the
352.72s: market these kinds of things are going
354.48s: to move sympathetically with other names
356.72s: so what that means is if you have stocks
358.68s: in the same industry that are reporting
360.40s: so for example you have Lockheed Ron and
364.52s: you can better believe that there's a
366.64s: tie between these two in something like
368.40s: Boeing although they're not the same
369.92s: company there's differences Boeing's
372.12s: planes don't fly apparently but you know
374.08s: that part aside there's overlap so when
377.28s: you see some of these other stocks
379.12s: moving on sympathetic moves that can
381.04s: lead to some pretty cool trade ideas I
383.24s: think so I've been playing both earnings
386.28s: releases paired down because I'm not
388.12s: seeing the same kind of opportunities
389.64s: that I like to in terms of risk premiums
391.84s: but I am playing the continuation moves
394.04s: very heavily because there's a lot of
396.92s: really heavy moving names and speaking
399.84s: of heavily moving names I want to show
402.20s: you one other thing so you can see NN
405.32s: ran 34% today I actually reviewed this
408.24s: not too long ago on a live stream cuz I
409.80s: have a position on in here I'm running
411.12s: it via long calls and then and wlf are
415.40s: at the top of this list again along with
417.16s: I andq these have been running near the
419.68s: top of this list for some time now and
421.68s: this is just looking at Daily gainers so
424.20s: if I grab a chart and we poke through
425.92s: these really quick I want you to just
427.68s: take a peek nne clearly breaking out and
431.44s: you can see that I'm sliding up my
433.16s: alerts as it goes up I already started
435.16s: pairing a little bit out of the trade
437.00s: after here and I'm just going to leave
439.56s: the runners on at this point to see what
441.16s: I can squeeze out of it but today was a
442.92s: massive massive gain this was a giant
446.04s: blowoff here and again this is just a a
448.68s: very stand standard breakout style play
451.20s: for me we can talk about that on the
453.28s: live stream a little bit later if we
454.72s: take a look at
456.00s: OK same story up and up it's been going
459.72s: up parabolically essentially from what
462.60s: the the 15th it's doubled in price from
465.32s: here not even from down at the lows from
467.44s: here so OKO has been running at the top
470.36s: of this list for a little while wlf has
472.44s: appeared a few times same story breaking
474.80s: up and out and then I NQ also same like
478.28s: the charts look I believe it or not I
480.20s: changed it it's a different ticker it's
481.68s: like the same chart these things are
483.16s: showing tremendous amounts of strength
485.16s: so I offer this as another way to look
487.00s: for ideas even though the rest of the
488.84s: market might be looking a little sad not
491.60s: offering giant moves giant opportunities
493.56s: all over the place there's tons of stuff
496.08s: always you just have to look anything
498.36s: you want me to take a look at let me
499.76s: know be an outlier see y'all later
