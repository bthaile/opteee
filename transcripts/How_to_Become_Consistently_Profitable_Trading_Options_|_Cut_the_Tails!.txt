0.08s: cut the tails off in your trading what
2.64s: the hell does that mean I'm going to
4.00s: walk you through it I'm also going to
5.52s: explain why you care because it can help
8.88s: you make more money trading and at the
10.44s: end of the video I'm going to walk you
11.44s: through the exact process I follow to
14.00s: identify and manage tals in my trading
17.88s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
19.64s: back to all the outliers shout out to
21.28s: the patreon family consider signing up
23.52s: we got weekly workshops all sorts of
25.48s: cool things in there and without further
28.28s: Ado let's get started here we have have
30.52s: a
32.40s: $68,000 account and the title of this
35.64s: Reddit post I know that probably shocks
37.52s: you that this is where this is from and
38.88s: it says incoming
41.04s: $50,000 loss in my favorite part here it
44.28s: says I know I'm stupid for doing this
48.80s: yes you are never thought Nvidia would
51.60s: move like it just did guess what this
55.08s: person just figured out what a tail is
57.04s: when we talk about tals it is Sy
60.60s: with extreme data points in a data set
64.28s: you think about it my branding for my
67.28s: YouTube channel in my community be an
69.96s: outlier that is a tail an outlier is a
74.60s: part of a data set but it's a tail in
77.68s: this case we think a positive skew tail
80.60s: a good tail in trading we typically want
83.60s: to look at the tals that hurt us so
87.08s: let's get a better sense of what that
89.52s: actually is if we take a look at this
91.96s: strategy this is a z DTE SPX 15 Delta
95.68s: strangle I run tons of these don't worry
98.88s: about all the details just know in this
101.04s: example I'm referring to something that
102.76s: has no stop it has no wings this is just
105.56s: placed as is and this is running from
107.68s: 2018 to 2024 this returned
111.28s: $1,210 at a 0.2% compound annual growth
115.28s: rate kager okay let's figure out why we
118.48s: care about the tails because if I apply
122.48s: a stoploss to this strategy everything
125.60s: else is the same it returns
128.00s: $5,151 at a 7.6% compound annual growth
132.72s: rate this is why we care about the Tails
135.92s: it can help you make a lot of money now
137.64s: it's really important to note this is a
139.40s: delicate process because as we go
141.48s: through this you're going to notice a
142.84s: few things that are worth calling out so
145.60s: to help us understand that let's take a
147.36s: look at what tailes are if you look at
151.04s: this distribution notice these little
153.36s: purple dots pretend that that is the
155.92s: profit and loss for your trades so as we
158.80s: look across this standard distribution
161.32s: note that you don't have to have a
163.36s: standard distribution it could be lepto
165.16s: kurtic mesokurtic doesn't matter it
167.04s: could have all different kinds of skew
168.88s: the point being though that at some
171.24s: point in the data set you're going to
173.64s: notice this right here me which is the
176.12s: mean this is the average of the data so
178.64s: that's where the bulk of the the data
180.16s: Falls around and if you look at the -1
183.08s: and + one standard deviation that's
185.16s: Sigma you'll see that
187.88s: 68.3% of data Falls within negative 1
192.72s: and positive 1 standard deviations
195.16s: interesting thing is you go down to two
197.52s: standard deviations this is
200.68s: 95.5% of data and then
203.24s: 99.7% of data at three standard
205.40s: deviations so as you go further out in
208.48s: your standard deviations it becomes more
210.28s: and more inclusive of your data set
212.68s: notice that there's both positive and
216.20s: negative deviation so in the case of
218.96s: this being p&l for a trade this means
221.08s: these are your losing trades these are
222.68s: your winning trades we want to have as
224.32s: many winning trades and if we have some
225.88s: big winning trades over here that's
227.32s: great you have to keep all things in
229.16s: context though if you have a bunch of
231.56s: outliers in your winning trades you have
234.24s: to take a close look at what's going on
235.72s: there but an easier place for us to
237.92s: start is looking at the losing side of
240.36s: the equation so what does this look like
242.76s: in a practical sense well if we take a
245.00s: look at those first two strategies that
246.64s: I shared with you the short strangle
249.20s: without a stop and then with a stop
251.44s: without a stop notice the average profit
254.12s: was 311 average loss was 1191 Max profit
259.32s: 1340 Max loss was ne$
263.44s: 7,287 after I applied the stop take a
266.96s: look at what happened to the average
268.20s: profit it went from 3 11 down to 307 the
272.92s: average loss went down to 670 The Max
276.80s: profit remained the same no impact to
278.72s: that and then the max loss went down to
283.08s: 3345 so we improved both the average
286.32s: loss and the max loss by about 50% and
289.92s: then we took a minor hit to the average
292.72s: profit no impact to the max profit this
295.80s: is how we can approach cutting tails off
299.32s: of our strategies this is why this
301.04s: strategy returned so much better because
303.40s: when I looked at this and you see the
305.88s: average loss is 1,200 bucks the max was
308.48s: 7,300 bucks that's a big difference
311.72s: notice the difference between these from
313.96s: 67 or 670 to 3,300 bucks still big
318.24s: difference but not as big this is
320.48s: massive so this is why we care about
323.72s: Tails this is what they look like in a
325.80s: data set so now let's talk about how we
328.76s: go about getting rid of them when you
331.00s: start this process you have to be aware
333.52s: of something called overfitting Data I'm
336.76s: not going to go into statistics 101 just
340.00s: note that when we're looking at back
342.76s: tested data it's looking at previous
344.88s: information we have to be aware that
347.08s: whatever we do to previous information
349.56s: as we receive new data points it's going
351.40s: to look different so if you optimize a
354.24s: strategy so that it looks perfect in a
356.64s: back tested sample going forward it's
359.20s: not going to look anything like that
360.76s: that strategy is not going to be robust
363.12s: because you have overfit your data to a
366.36s: specific sample that is continually
368.04s: changing so we're looking for things
369.76s: that are more robust the other thing to
372.28s: keep in mind is as you go through this
373.96s: process it's not as simple as just cut
376.36s: the tails off because if you notice as
378.28s: we cut those tails off it impacts the
381.20s: rest of the expectancy of the trade so
383.12s: we'll get into what that means in just a
384.68s: minute so the first thing is start with
386.76s: a large data set the more data the
388.28s: better ideally you have a trail log and
390.08s: if you are in the patreon you have
392.04s: access to a free sample of one to get
394.32s: you started the reason why we want a
395.92s: large data set though is because it
398.64s: gives you a wide lens to start with so
401.92s: what I like to do in this example is you
404.80s: can see these are all different
405.80s: permutations for zero DTE strategies and
408.84s: this top one you'll notice the max
410.72s: profit and loss there's no application
413.84s: I'm not touching it I'm putting the
415.36s: trade on and letting it go to expiration
417.28s: notice the max loss in this scenario was
419.08s: 82 51 then you'll notice I started
422.48s: applying Max loss protocols then I apply
425.76s: Max profit protocols then I combine the
428.00s: two protocols what I'm doing in the
430.00s: beginning is I'm looking for extremes
432.96s: and then I'm trying to apply different
435.52s: rules that help me control the extremes
438.48s: while monitoring the impact to expected
441.20s: return so here's what that means if I
443.68s: take a look at this strategy and I apply
446.56s: a 200% Max loss mean meaning 200% of the
450.92s: credit received that takes my Max loss
453.80s: from 8250 down to 3 Grand that is a
457.32s: great change now if I look at the
459.40s: average win prior to the adjustment it's
462.20s: 378 and after the adjustment it goes
465.32s: down ever so slightly so I don't
468.48s: actually care that means I haven't made
470.44s: a big impact there now notice how the
473.88s: number of winners changes the number of
476.36s: winners with no management is 642 the
479.52s: number of winners in this case is 584 so
482.44s: what's happened we have less winning
483.88s: trades here what's going on in this
486.12s: scenario is because we have a stop when
489.36s: the strategy goes out there are periods
492.48s: that the trade profit and loss goes
495.28s: outside of your stop you get stopped out
498.88s: so it's no longer a potential winning
500.64s: trade that's a losing trade in this case
502.64s: but sometimes it comes back in and
505.28s: becomes a winner so if you do not apply
508.80s: a delicate balance here you can have
510.96s: things that get stopped out and then as
513.16s: it comes back in you would have made
514.88s: money the other thing you could do is
516.32s: try adding legs to strategies like this
518.84s: this is just a concept I'm sharing the
520.88s: problem with adding legs is multiple
522.44s: fold not going to go into detail this
523.92s: isn't about this explicit strategy this
526.32s: is specifically about the idea of
528.76s: cutting tails off but if you want to
530.08s: talk more about that let me know and I
531.92s: can make a video on it for you guys so
534.28s: after this we figure out what rules we
536.48s: think we could apply so in this case I
537.96s: see a big loss I want want to figure out
539.88s: how to get this loss down without
541.28s: affecting the profit too much so I start
543.40s: by applying stops I start by applying
546.00s: buying legs because if you buy legs that
548.40s: seems really great because then you
550.04s: don't have this instance where something
551.80s: goes out of sample and comes back in
553.52s: seems great but unfortunately it doesn't
555.60s: work that great so after you apply it to
558.80s: the broad data set then you need to
560.84s: apply it to segmented data so what that
563.92s: means is if you remember in the original
565.36s: example we looked at 2018 to 2024 that
568.60s: entire period then what I'm going to do
570.88s: is split that period up typically in
573.56s: half test those two periods so the first
576.92s: half of that range and then second half
579.68s: and then I'm going to split it up into
581.28s: each year by doing this I'm making sure
584.60s: that the strategy holds up in different
586.64s: market conditions and isn't just being
589.32s: smooth because of a long Runway it's
592.04s: really important to segment your data in
594.68s: this way to make sure that you have
596.36s: stuff that falls in Sample and out of
598.36s: sample again I'm not going to go into
600.56s: statistics 101 it's good practice just
602.84s: know that then you can apply it to
604.96s: projected data you could throw it into a
606.80s: Mante Carlos simulation to get new
608.44s: prices for future occurrences lots of
611.08s: deviations and see how it holds up then
613.72s: from there start testing in a small
616.32s: amount of money paper trading live stuff
618.64s: like that put real money behind it see
620.52s: how it does and continually optimize it
623.08s: because markets change if you apply one
625.96s: structure here that doesn't mean it's
627.80s: going to work Forever This is a the big
629.60s: reason why in the past year I was
631.12s: trading a lot of short strangles versus
634.24s: my typical go-to for a long time before
636.12s: that was short straddles and it's
637.64s: because markets change you have to stay
639.12s: sensitive to how things are doing so in
641.28s: a nutshell the way we cut tailes off our
643.32s: trading is we review data we segment the
646.16s: data out after we apply different rules
648.76s: that we think might work and we observe
650.76s: the impact to our expected return if
653.44s: you're unfamiliar with what that is I'll
655.08s: throw a video in the notes below this is
656.80s: simply how things perform in aggregate
659.32s: looking at win probability average win
662.04s: loss probability average loss that gives
664.48s: you a really solid idea on how you can
666.36s: project something like this forward
667.96s: using sample data and to decrease the
671.84s: unnecessary losing positions that you
674.76s: have and to decrease the drag you
677.32s: experience on your portfolio if you have
678.88s: any questions let me know be an outlier
681.12s: see you guys later
