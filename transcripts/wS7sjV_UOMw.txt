0.00s: Hands down, my favorite option strategy is the covered strangle. This video is going to go into exactly why and it's for two reasons.
6.96s: It's extremely adaptable to most market conditions and once you create a sound strategy around the covered
13.44s: strangle option structure, it allows you to benefit from different market forces in different market conditions.
20.72s: And I'll explain exactly why that's the case in just a minute.
23.52s: So what's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers and a huge shout out to the Patreon members and
29.28s: YouTube members you guys make creating content like this possible for me. So thank you guys and if you enjoy my content
35.28s: consider signing up. Helps me a lot with that. Let's get right to it. Executive summary. So for those that don't know
40.48s: I'm really big into organization and I will throw a link in the notes below on the concept of trading plans and
46.88s: strategy outlines. This is kind of the excerpt of a strategy outline that walks through how I view the strategy,
53.60s: how I intend to deploy it. The executive summary is like the acid test. It's just an overview of what it is succinctly.
58.96s: So the covered strangle is designed to maintain market exposure. So I trade the covered strangle in almost
66.24s: every single market condition. It's primarily a bullish strategy. The market exhibits positive drift
73.84s: over a long term time frame. So it allows me to expose myself to that. But we can enhance the buy and hold
80.16s: return because one of the downsides of buying hold is when the market goes down. You lose out on a lot of
86.40s: opportunity and buy and hold because you just essentially have to get it by and hold. But in this case
92.00s: we can use options around a otherwise buy and hold strategy to really amplify the return potential.
98.32s: So what's the setup here? What does this thing actually look like? Well real simple really. It's going
102.72s: to start with a cash secured put then it's going to have long stock and then it's going to have a covered
107.04s: call. Let's take a quick look at each of those by themselves first. If we pull up the platform you can see
112.00s: a trade that I have on right now in IWM which is a covered strangle. And let's take a look at each
117.76s: of these individual legs. So first we have the cash secured puts. Cash secured puts will have limited
124.64s: profit potential. It's defined at the onset of the trade and technically undefined risk down to zero.
130.00s: Then we have the covered call. This part is actually really important first. It's going to start with
135.84s: the long stock right. So long equity you've seen this before. It's just a positive sloping line for
140.56s: anybody that's looking at this chart saying what the hell is this? This is literally just a risk profile
145.20s: but it shows you your profit and loss at different stock prices. So the Y-axis is our P&L and then the
151.04s: X-axis is the price in the underlying. So long stock it's just upward sloping right. You dollar
156.72s: for dollar you move with the underlying. Now right now I'm long 800 shares of IWM at 181 94. So covered
164.32s: call typically looks like this where if we have long 800 shares we would be short 8 calls against it
172.32s: and notice how we cap our upside potential. Now right now my covered call actually looks like this.
178.80s: Notice how it has unlimited upside potential. This is for a very particular reason. I do not sell
184.96s: short calls to long stock at a 1 to 1 ratio. Typically we'll get into different circumstances on what
190.32s: ratios you would want to use when but the guiding feature here is if I'm long 800 shares at 181 94
197.12s: and I'm short six short calls at 182 which is above my basis. I have 200 shares that are uncapped.
204.64s: That's why I do not have capped upside potential. One of the largest drawbacks of the covered
210.56s: call is capped upside potential. We accept some money upfront but then we give up our upside
216.56s: potential and a lot of times the stock will run and then you're like well damn it I'm missing out on
220.88s: a lot of gains for a little bit of a credit upfront. Say something god damn it you're on television.
226.48s: This allows us to create balance. So in this case if I want to unwind the position short I might sell
233.68s: 8 short calls against the long 800 shares in the hopes that all 800 get called away and I'm okay
239.44s: with that. But in other instances you can modulate how many short calls you sell and we'll get into
244.48s: what that trade-off looks like in a little bit. So those are the legs that's it. It's really not
248.32s: that complicated. So I want to run you through overall management real quick because I just gave you
253.12s: what the max profit and the max losses for each of those but let's take a look at P&L management.
258.08s: For the cash secure put I'm typically going to look at something around 65% max profit. I personally
264.32s: use a sliding scale that's IV adjusted days to expiration. I'm not going to go into that into
270.32s: this video because it really doesn't offer that big of an enhancement over this as a general
276.88s: approach. Then for the long stock normally I'm just going to use support and resistance using
283.76s: moving averages linear aggression channels kind of what you typically would do when you're trading.
288.48s: So whatever your overall approach is to managing long stock positions that's what I would apply here.
294.96s: Now the products I trade make this slightly different and in general I'm mostly going to be looking
301.12s: at taking profit when I want to unwind the position but I overall look at things like moving
306.08s: averages linear aggression channels because I don't want to ride things all the way down if I don't
310.80s: have to. We'll get into that in a little bit but overall that's what I'm looking at for the cash
314.56s: secure put and the long stock. For the covered call the profit is just going to be managed at whatever
319.04s: the short strike is and I'm going to let it expire more often than not. We can get into managing the
324.16s: covered call section of the trade when it's in the money in a little bit but overall that's what
328.08s: I'm going to do that's why I'm selling the short strike on those calls because I'm comfortable
332.56s: unwinding there. So for the loss side because I trade very curated products for the strategy my
340.96s: loss management is very different than just about every other strategy that I run. In this case if
348.32s: you are trading a normal stock like a growth stock something that you hope goes up but you're not
353.76s: super convicted your technical analysis you know makes you believe that you're pretty you know
358.24s: confident that it's going to move in your direction but not totally then I would apply your general
363.28s: loss management approach to any other long stock position that you have meaning I normally would use
369.36s: support and resistance in the broader trend. I'm going to go into why when I'm trading my variation
374.88s: of this strategy I don't really follow this because I really don't take many losses in this strategy
380.80s: at all and that's not like some sort of huge flex I'm always right I'm not. You're joking right?
385.68s: There are periods where I'm very wrong but the way I structure the strategy I'm okay being wrong
391.20s: in holding in unrealized loss for periods of time provided that we manage the rest of the strategy
396.00s: correctly which we're going to get into in just a second. So from here let's talk about the process
400.80s: so that you get a feel for how this works. First we are going to have that cash secured put and
405.76s: that's typically how I'm going to enter the trade. From there there are two scenarios that cash
410.32s: secured put can be out of the money in which we would sell again or it can be in the money and then
415.84s: if it's in the money you have three choices you can close those in the money short puts for a loss
421.76s: I very rarely pretty much never do that you could roll them out I do this very frequently or you can
427.20s: take assignment if you take assignment there are a few other scenarios that happen here you're now
433.12s: going to be long shares because cash secure put means part of that bargain is if you're assigned
439.12s: you're going to buy the underlying at your strike price so you're going to be long at your strike
444.40s: price that's when I would offer those covered calls at a ratio the same time I'm going to sell more
451.04s: cash secure puts the way I manage this is by creating very careful scaling protocols that allow
459.36s: me to have capital to continue to add more cash secured puts to manage the basis this is one of
465.76s: the biggest differences in this strategy compared to anything else in general adding to losing trades
470.96s: is a poor prospect in this scenario it's slightly different because what I'm doing is very
477.76s: carefully manipulating my basis on the way down when things aren't working there is a period time
484.24s: where it's painful you're holding something that's losing money it's uncomfortable but notice how
488.32s: I'm trading IWM I've never seen any sort of US based broad market index not make new highs at
496.16s: some point so if my hypothesis in that changed eventually sure I would take a loss no problem but
502.32s: this isn't Japan Japan has that scenario where they still haven't made new highs but if we zoom
507.12s: all the way out this is going back essentially to the inception of IWM we've never not made new highs
513.36s: at some point in time even if we take a look very quickly at spx another broad base will really
518.96s: we would use spy but spx just let us let's us go back further in time notice how we've gone down
524.16s: before but we've never not made new highs that part is so important to the strategy because there's
530.16s: no other scenario that I would feel comfortable adding risk on the way down but in this scenario I do
536.24s: feel comfortable you just have to be patient so in this scenario we now have essentially the full
541.28s: covered strangle where we're long the equity we have the ratio covered call and we have the cash
546.24s: secure put out that is the entire setup now in this scenario if you're trying to avoid assignment
550.64s: which I'll get into the trade-offs here in a minute and you choose to roll those short puts
554.56s: then really you're just up here you just go back up to selling and managing the cash secure put
559.20s: now I want to talk to you real quick about the covered call side because now we have more options
564.08s: we have the cash secure puts that we're managing which I went over up here and now we have the
568.16s: covered calls where there's two scenarios either they're going to be out of the money and if they're
572.48s: out of the money we're just going to offer more covered calls and then if they're in the money we
576.88s: allow them to be assigned or we can roll them if we roll them we just go back up here the cover
582.80s: call and keep managing it as as is again the main differentiation between how I'm going to roll
589.76s: short puts versus short calls short puts I typically roll pretty aggressively to manage my
595.76s: basis so I don't get stuck at a top the short calls I rarely will roll unless it's I can clearly
602.32s: make a lot more money but otherwise allowing assignment here's a big part of the strategy because
607.20s: it frees up capital of long equity that we can now offer again via the cash secured puts let's
614.32s: now talk about the products I gave you a little bit of a preamble but this is such an important
620.00s: aspect to the strategy I'm going to look for very liquid products ideally that have weak lease
625.28s: the weaklies aren't always super liquid but if something offers weaklies generally speaking it's
630.88s: going to be liquid because there's at least some demand there but overall I'm going to focus on
635.76s: liquidity what's liquid you can essentially look at ETFs large cap stocks those kind of products
641.92s: the reason why liquidity matters in this case is because there are periods of time where you're
645.60s: rolling deep in the money option if they're not liquid you're going to get eaten alive in those
650.08s: instances I sometimes will prioritize a dividend sometimes I won't if I'm looking for a dividend
656.24s: I would want something at least 2% if it's offering a dividend if I'm trading an index ETF I
662.08s: sacrifice some of that the reason why I like these products and specifically why I like IWM versus
669.92s: the spy for example I'll actually throw a video in the notes below why I prefer spy over IWM
676.56s: what do you say I totally dork that up I mean why I like IWM over spy but it really comes down to
683.36s: diversification of the products and volatility typically speaking IWM is going to have slightly
688.96s: more volatility on average which when we're selling options we want that the other thing is
693.44s: diversification if you take a look at the S&P 500 notice there's a lot of products but Microsoft
699.04s: Apple Google meta they make up a lot of the index whereas you look at the Russell 2000 that's
704.96s: really not the case it's very well diversified the top 10 holdings make up like 2% of this product
711.36s: whereas this it's like 20% so overall you're going to get better diversification and volatility
715.84s: in IWM but sometimes you could trade individual large cap stocks if you're looking for a little bit
719.84s: more growth I don't do that so much anymore myself but I definitely did back in the day when I was
724.72s: trying to aggressively grow the account now for implied volatility like I said we are trading
730.16s: options and short options so in general I am going to prefer periods where implied volatility is
736.32s: going to be trending over realized volatility meaning the variance risk premiums are a little more
741.28s: invoge if you will so if I zoom in here to a six month daily we can see essentially that trend
746.88s: between the yellow and the white lines I want to be very clear this is not a determining factor on
751.52s: whether or not I'm going to put the product on but this is sometimes an informing factor in terms
757.20s: of what scaling protocols I'm going to implement and what initial size I'm going to offer this
762.56s: becomes important then so I'm going to get more aggressive when implied volatility percentile is
767.52s: above 20% typically but most importantly when this relationship widens when the variance risk
772.64s: premiums are greater and if you're unfamiliar with that concept I'll throw a link in the notes
776.56s: below on variance risk premiums very similar to the volatility side of the equation for technical
782.40s: analysis fundamental analysis the way I think about this is it is a long term position meaning the
788.40s: hypothesis for this could be a one year hold a two year hold a three year hold but it's comprising
794.40s: of a bunch of short term trades as well so apply the correct analysis that fits your approach to these
800.08s: things for me I'm going to look at different timeframes when I'm trading something like IWM for
805.76s: the coverage triangle again based on my technical analysis I'm not necessarily not going to trade it
811.68s: but if I wanted to let's say this wasn't IWM let's say that this was just stock XYZ probably
816.88s: wouldn't buy it here it's I would want to see it break above 180 essentially but really it has a
822.48s: lot of downward pressure but with IWM I don't care as much because I'm amplifying the position
828.16s: with options and it's a longer term hold so the way that I'm applying this analysis is more to
833.84s: inform me on how much I want to offer initially and then how I'm going to scale into the position so
839.36s: I'm going to look at things like moving averages I'm going to look at things like linear regression
843.36s: channels I will throw a video in the notes below that walks through the technical analysis I typically
849.36s: like to use then for individual stocks fundamental analysis is really important I'm going to be looking
855.04s: at things like sales revenue overall profitability of the company which if we take a quick look at a
861.76s: scan this is just a very general scan that I use this is looking within the S&P 500 that has weak
867.76s: lease I'm looking for something that's solvent has a decent quick ratio typically I prefer it above
872.16s: one that revenue is continuing to grow sales per shares continuing to grow that it's trading above
877.92s: the 50 period EMA the 20 period EMA you could pick different EMAs but then I'm also going to look
882.80s: at all these other kind of ratios as flow relative value free cash flow PE ratios stuff like that
890.08s: but because I'm typically trading in index ETF I actually don't care quite as much so let's
896.48s: now pivot over to best practices we're going to talk about all of these specifically how to think
901.60s: about them and what the trade-offs are for each so for the cash secured put side of it I'm typically
907.76s: going to offer at a delta of 0.15 to 0.5 the trade-off here the way to think about it is do you want
914.48s: to sell a 20 delta or a 30 delta the higher the delta you sell the more upfront money you are
920.24s: going to collect however the trade-off is the probability of it falling in the money and requiring
925.28s: management is going to be greater that's your trade-off the other thing to consider is that the
929.52s: lower delta you sell the lower the basis is going to be those are the two primary inputs that I
935.92s: think about when I'm choosing a delta the other thing to keep in mind is the distance off of highs
942.24s: and this kind of bleeds into number two here but if we're very close to market highs I'm
947.36s: typically going to favor a lower delta like a 20 or 25 delta and that's just because the
952.40s: propensity for us to fall down becomes greater if we're revving right against highs now one of the
958.40s: premier aspects of my strategy is sizing and scaling the way I think about this is every single
963.92s: trade I put on has three features it has a total capital allocation how much money am I going to
970.40s: give to this trade in total I define that up front then the initial outlay is the second piece what
976.96s: is my initial offering going to be as a percentage of my total allocation then the third thing based
984.24s: on that remaining amount of money that's not used in the initial outlay how do I scale into the trade
991.44s: so the way to think about the trade-offs here is the allocation is what it is that's whatever fits
997.12s: into your portfolio this comprises the core allocation of my core portfolio so I'm very generous with
1004.56s: the total allocation I like to split my portfolio into two buckets core and speculative core being my
1010.64s: main effort as we would say in the Marine Corps that's my bid for success it's how I want to meet my
1014.88s: primary investing objectives so I'm very generous with my allocations there so that's the total
1020.24s: allocation for the initial outlay I'm going to look at two things I'm going to look at our percentages
1026.40s: off of all time highs the closer we are to all time highs the less I'm going to offer maybe like 20%
1033.36s: 30% and also implied volatility if we're really close to all time highs and implied volatility is
1039.68s: very low I'm going to scale down quite a bit because you stand to lose more than you really stand to
1046.16s: make it becomes difficult to trade the strategy the way to think about the initial outlay is if it's a
1051.60s: bigger outlay you're going to make more money up front it's a bigger credit right larger position
1056.48s: but you sacrifice being able to scale in on the way down so for example coming back to this during
1064.16s: COVID which is a really great recent example if I we were trading here where volatility was low
1070.48s: and we were near highs relative to the point in time if I was like fully allocated here I would have
1076.88s: had nothing to add on the way down I would have essentially had to sit on my hands and wait until we
1083.68s: rallied out of here and then made new highs that's okay it's not a worst case scenario because
1089.12s: you're still eventually going to make money but that's not what I'm looking for I want to be able to
1093.68s: scale in on the way down so that as we make this v shape recovery which I didn't know at the point in
1099.44s: time as we make that recovery I can make a lot more money so it is important to note that when we're
1106.88s: thinking about scaling it's a tricky prospect I typically am going to use something like each
1113.92s: 5% decline I'm going to look at deploying something whether it's 5% of my remaining allocation 10%
1120.16s: you have to figure out what's right for you but you have to think about scaling is silver bullets
1124.56s: because going back to this example if let's say I had actually let's say I had 80% allocated so
1133.20s: let's say I had a hundred dollars in this position and I wanted to scale in on the way down if I had
1139.52s: no money left to scale I could only scale in 20 more dollars your basis isn't going to change that
1144.16s: much now let's say you had a thousand dollars I'm just using round numbers because I'm an idiot and
1148.40s: it's easier for me but let's say you have a thousand dollars allocated to this trade but you
1155.44s: enter with a hundred dollars now if you scale in with another hundred dollars up here your basis is
1161.20s: going to be the difference between those two not bad good basis improvement in order to get the
1166.00s: same kind of basis improvement again now you have two hundred dollars in the trade you have to add
1170.72s: two hundred dollars so you went from one hundred utilization to two hundred utilization to four hundred
1175.52s: utilization if you wanted to do that again now you're at eight hundred utilization the point being the
1180.00s: more you add to the trade the more money you need to make a meaningful impact on your basis so
1185.92s: I like to scale meaningfully up front but then slow down and wait on the way down because the
1192.08s: average bear market is two hundred and ninety eight days so I actually left a lot of money on the
1198.16s: table here because I was scaling in based on my typical protocols which again is keeping in mind a
1203.92s: longer bear market which we didn't get so I left a lot of money on the table but I was geared up for
1208.64s: a much worse case scenario so that whenever we eventually do bottom I still my basis is decent enough
1215.76s: that I can continue to trade options around it because this goes into number three my short call
1221.68s: delta I prefer to be above the basis of my shares so right now again is a great example of this if
1229.76s: we go to the analyze tab and we put on the actual trade that I have which is short two separate lots
1235.68s: of puts I'm long eight hundred shares short six calls my basis is one eighty one that's over here
1242.08s: but I WM is trading down here at one seventy six so by by scaling in I didn't start the trade with
1249.52s: eight hundred shares I started with probably two or four hundred shares but by scaling in on the
1254.32s: way down I was able to improve my basis enough to at least be able to sell calls against it that
1259.92s: allow me to collect something reasonable if your basis is too high you lose the ability to sell short
1267.20s: calls above your basis because if you do short calls if you sell them below your basis you're now
1273.76s: possibly locking in a loss which sucks especially if you've been holding the trade for a long time so
1279.60s: I really look to avoid that and then at a ratio because we get to maintain upside potential we already
1284.48s: went through technical analysis fundamental analysis all of this stuff is really what drives how much I
1290.16s: want to scale when I want to take profits the most important part is don't fall in love with
1294.80s: specifically if their individual stocks stay sensitive to whatever your benchmarks are now
1299.68s: days to expiration we're pretty much all of these I'm going to be looking at something between zero
1303.92s: and fifty days out I base that on implied volatility and then the current market conditions
1309.04s: here's why if the markets are really low implied volatility and steadily grinding higher I'm going to
1315.20s: favor the longer duration so that I can collect enough money for the trade to make sense I'm looking
1320.00s: for about a 1% return on invested capital for the cash secure puts so if you're not able to get
1326.08s: that because implied volatility is too low you kind of have to add more time if you're in markets
1331.04s: like we see now you don't actually have to do that so I tend to prefer shorter term time frames
1336.32s: and it's for several reasons one variance risk premiums are going to be higher to it allows me to
1341.76s: be more sensitive to current spot price movements so that if I decide to manage the trade I have more
1348.00s: opportunity what do I mean by that? Great question let me show you so if we pull up this options chain
1353.52s: let's say right now I have short puts out in 22 May if these fell in the money I could roll them out
1360.64s: to 24 May add two days I can roll them out to 26 May to 30 May because of the weekly
1365.84s: expirations I have a ton of choices because the trade off here is the further out in time you go
1371.12s: the more money you collect but you start you have to wait longer first but you lose sensitivity
1377.12s: what I mean by that is let's say instead I had these short puts out 41 days out and then they fall
1383.20s: in the money quickly well the next roll I have available is 62 days then 90 days so instead of
1390.40s: adding two days to the trade that I have to wait I'm now adding 30 at a clip so that's the trade
1396.56s: off here the shorter term time frames you can trade typically I prefer you're going to get better
1400.96s: theta decay but in low implied volatility environment slowly ascending markets it's difficult to do that
1406.32s: now for rolling or rolling versus assignment a couple things to keep in mind for the short puts
1412.24s: or the short calls the best time to roll meaning when you have the most choices whether you want to roll
1417.36s: out in time not too far or out in time and up or down depending on if it's a putter of call
1422.88s: when the stock equals your strike price that's when you're going to have the most opportunities
1427.44s: but you have to balance a few things you have to balance how much time value you're buying back
1432.96s: so if we go to this example and let's say I wanted to roll these puts for whatever reason
1438.08s: I'm buying back $30 that otherwise would decay out so that's the time value you're buying back
1445.04s: that I don't want to do that I want to make money on the time value not buy it back then you also
1449.76s: have to think about sensitivity to days to expiration which I just went over making sure that we can
1454.48s: try to stay close in time to give us more choices we have better theta decay because the theta decay
1460.40s: curve is going to be really fast in here and if you need to roll you have more
1465.20s: expirations available to you without going super far out in time but then also your basis because
1469.68s: sometimes as the markets just continue to grind down those short puts can get really tricky and you
1475.68s: have to figure out the best way for you to manage your basis and sometimes you have to go instead of
1480.32s: going two days out or four days out you have to go 20 days out but this way instead of your basis
1485.12s: let's say these you know 170 fours were in the money let's say you looked two days out or four
1490.32s: days out and you're like okay well I can roll those 170 fours to 172 but let's say you go 20 days
1496.16s: out you're like okay well I can actually get them to 164 now for a credit that's really impactful
1501.68s: and that hits an important concept when we're rolling in either of these instances I'm going to
1505.92s: look for a credit if you can't get a credit sometimes a small debit is okay provided the overall
1512.64s: position is still profitable which I have a bunch of videos on rolling and how you can track
1517.52s: that math I'll throw those in the notes below but the tradeoff here simply comes down to
1522.32s: do you want to roll to improve your basis do you want to improve your profitability or do you
1527.60s: want to allow assignments specifically if it's short calls for example I'm typically going to
1532.24s: err on just allowing them to be assigned but if you can roll a make some more money that's okay so
1536.48s: the last thing I want to talk about here is the allocated capital because this is a capital
1540.40s: intensive strategy so one of the things I talk about now is being able to actually put the
1545.68s: capital you've allocated to the trade into something that earns the risk-free rate so we can kind
1550.40s: of double dip this is something that a lot of people don't think about so for example let's say
1554.48s: that we're going to put $100,000 allocated to the strategy you're going to use $20,000 up front
1560.56s: you might not even need all 20,000 if you're selling puts and then you have $80,000 as just sitting
1566.96s: there typically what I'll do is I'll take the money that's not being used and I'll put it into
1571.84s: box spreads and I'll just be careful about the timing so let's say for example I have short puts
1578.08s: expiring 26 May right now I have box spreads out in SPX that expire 24 May or that even expired
1585.76s: uh yesterday today's the 20th of May so that I can cover these as well if I'm to get assigned so
1592.56s: by deconflicting the timing of the box spread it allows you to capture the risk-free rate on the
1597.60s: capital that otherwise would just be sitting there and this is more pertinent now because the risk-free
1603.60s: rates over 5% so you could put in a 10-day box spread and at least make something on it as compared
1609.12s: to the money just sitting there so I'll throw a video below on box spread so that you can figure out
1614.00s: how I like to think about those and using that to really maximize the profit potential of the
1618.72s: strategy so that's the overview of the coverage strangle I know you're thinking 30-minute video how
1623.52s: can that be an overview I've spent a lot of time developing the strategy so I'll throw a playlist
1628.00s: below that walks through a bunch of live trades that I have on how I manage them how I look at the
1633.28s: current markets to manage the trade in that scenario because I trade it so much if you enjoyed the
1638.16s: video please like subscribe share it really helps me grow I appreciate you guys watching the video
1643.60s: and don't forget to be an outlier I'll see you guys later
