362.00s: you
390.84s: you
407.64s: so
410.14s: le
410.62s: a
412.64s: stop
413.76s: now
415.76s: just
416.68s: go
418.36s: What I want to get a sense of region matter, this is like a fucking, like a really big
428.24s: response.
429.24s: I don't need all that.
430.24s: I literally just want to know the answer to my question.
432.32s: So, it's giving me sales channel breakdown.
435.48s: Here we go.
437.32s: Big box retailers Walmart target best buy 40 to 50%.
443.52s: Walmart alone is the single biggest seller.
446.88s: Mine Amazon direct websites represents 30 to 40%.
451.96s: Specialty retailers, GameStop, ebgames, ebgames.
456.00s: I haven't heard the term ebgames in a long freaking time.
461.52s: That's, if I recall correctly, that's what actually used to be in the mall by my house.
466.72s: And then it moved to a GameStop or it might have been both of them.
470.48s: I'd have to ask my buddy, he would know.
472.52s: I just don't remember.
473.52s: I do remember like ebgames being a thing.
477.36s: I think it was ebgames was in the mall.
480.40s: And then I think GameStop was like its own little shop that was part of like a strip mall.
484.60s: You guys don't care.
486.08s: Club's regional store is about 5%.
487.84s: So, it's Costco, Sam's Club, Regional Luck, Tronic Trains, local shops.
492.32s: So really it doesn't look like specialty retailers as much of the total sales.
496.52s: 10 to 15%.
497.52s: So then the follow on question is for specialty retailers like GameStop, what is the typical
510.36s: margin on the sale of a console?
515.76s: Because my guess is it's not going to be a lot.
522.96s: 5 to 8% gross margin.
528.40s: 3 to 5% if they're discounting or bundling.
532.96s: Yeah.
536.40s: Hardware is treated almost like a loss leader.
539.88s: They want you in the store to buy games, controllers, headset, warranties and GameStop
543.52s: memberships.
544.52s: All of which are much higher margins.
547.12s: 20 to 50%.
548.52s: Honestly did not know that.
549.92s: It kind of actually reminds me of the new car sales thing, right?
555.00s: Where a lot of dealers actually sell new cars.
558.68s: People always complain about dealer prices.
560.60s: But actually a lot of times they're kind of not huge margins on the sale of a car.
567.28s: A lot of times it is everything to do with trying to get you into their sphere for then
574.72s: warranties, maintenance and stuff like that.
576.96s: So it literally reminds me of that.
579.28s: Exactly where I was expecting because it's an interesting idea, Rudea Baguette, to be
582.72s: honest, like that's I love looking at stuff like this, right?
585.76s: Because we can take a logical idea of thinking the sale of a new console is could be wind
591.72s: at the back.
592.88s: And then we can click into it a few times and we can take a look.
595.52s: And again, the reason why I do these with you is I'm trying to show you how to think
599.72s: through this stuff logically yourselves as well to like analyze the things that you're
603.76s: hearing.
604.76s: Because if you like doing this research grade, if not, I love doing it with you guys.
608.88s: So I'm always happy to run the research side with you all.
612.96s: But I find it really important, especially with something like GameStop, especially with
618.12s: something that has so much information floating around that a lot of times it can be stuff
624.40s: that's just been said in different capacities versus, you know, what the reality of things
630.72s: might be.
631.72s: Rudea Baguette says, I forgot how greeting Nintendo is.
633.44s: I actually don't think that's a Nintendo driven thing.
636.20s: I think that that's actually more so driven by the broader sales approach, which is
643.12s: trying to get people in the door, meaning to the store.
646.32s: And then from there, you can kind of try to sell other stuff to them.
651.68s: Again, it's really not novel for the sake of like GameStop or other, a lot of other
657.80s: brands will do stuff like that.
659.68s: And you'll actually knowingly take on parts of business at a knowing loss in order to
665.36s: secure other potential business that then net net overwhelms that loss.
669.80s: So honestly, the fact that they're not doing it at cost is actually kind of cool because
676.32s: the reality is if you're looking at something that's only 10 to 15% of the total sales
682.36s: for like a new console.
683.36s: So let's take the research one step further.
686.00s: We'll grab a notebook for us to track some of this stuff and we'll just get a ballpark
691.84s: idea because why not?
696.12s: So I'll throw this over here.
697.64s: I'll move you guys on the main screen in a second, but I have to ask you, PTA, a couple
702.32s: of other questions.
703.84s: So next question, I want to know, oh, that's actually great.
709.20s: Yeah.
710.20s: So breakdown, how this impacts GameStop financials during console years?
714.12s: Yes.
716.12s: I'd like both of those like that in addition for the last Nintendo use the last Nintendo
731.12s: switch release for the comparison.
737.24s: And I think using the last Nintendo switch would be a really good like like comparison.
740.64s: And we can actually see what it is.
743.32s: Now in the meantime, let me grab a quick grab here.
751.60s: I want to talk to you all about the GameStop coverage triangle and where things sit because
756.28s: there actually have been some pretty cool changes to it that I want to walk you through.
760.64s: I don't know where we left off last.
762.80s: I think we discussed it a little bit.
765.16s: I honestly don't fully remember, but doesn't really matter because we're going to take
769.64s: a look together now.
770.96s: So let's do that.
772.28s: Let's grab this also in case you're wondering what this cool photo is behind my head.
776.36s: I took this from the drone.
777.64s: This is from Iceland.
780.12s: I have like three screens and on each of the screens is like a different photo from somewhere
784.20s: we've been pretty cool.
785.40s: Okay, let's get on with it.
789.12s: GameStop there you are.
790.72s: Okay.
793.84s: So this is where we are.
798.12s: We literally have.
799.76s: Oh no, okay.
800.36s: So there was a new update because this one wasn't out there before.
804.68s: So here's what's gone down in GameStop for those that don't remember.
810.80s: I originally had rotated out of the equity itself on 7 April at a basis of 2575 and I sold
822.32s: it for 23.
823.80s: So I lost $1,000 realized on that.
828.52s: The reason is, Joe says, can you sell that pick as wallpaper?
832.04s: I don't know.
833.04s: I've never tried, but if any of you guys want any of the photos that I've shown you, literally
835.92s: just tell me I'm happy to share them.
840.16s: And then Joe, if you feel like trying to sell it, go for it.
841.84s: I don't care.
843.08s: I know that you are trying to get your hustle on.
846.00s: So if that would help you, let me know.
851.40s: So I recently moved out of shares.
855.88s: The big reason, again, let's take a look at what was happening here.
860.40s: If we take a look at one of the trades, when I started phasing into the position, the
866.92s: phasing in started, we actually have to go back further, funny enough for this.
872.64s: Oh, damn, it loses all scale every time I forget.
876.20s: We need to go to November.
879.16s: The eighth, right here.
883.44s: So on this breakout is where I started this coverage triangle sample trade that I'm
891.28s: working with you all.
892.64s: And again, it's a sample trade.
893.92s: It's like a sample section of the portfolio, but this is a real trade that I'm actually
897.52s: trading right now.
899.12s: We started here.
900.60s: And then we were buying in January, November.
904.24s: We bought all the way into March.
906.80s: So kind of a series of different purchase campaigns was on the 27th.
912.12s: So following earnings on the strap, we bought some.
916.08s: And then on the 7th of April.
919.88s: So here we ended up exiting.
923.96s: So the reason for the exit is actually not because I was expecting GameStop to go down.
929.84s: That's actually not it at all.
932.44s: It's because if you look at the campaign and the different prices that I was transacting
937.04s: at, 24, 32, 24, 32, 27, 21, the average price at that point for the latest series, which
944.16s: was at 400 shares was 25, 75.
948.08s: So not a bad basis by any stretch.
951.28s: However, it's also not really where it needed to be based on how this thing was moving.
956.92s: So I'll explain that to you in a second, but Thor needs to go out.
968.04s: Might as well leverage the standing desk and stand up a little bit.
976.04s: Okay.
978.32s: So when looking at this broader position and when I started getting in versus how things
985.04s: were overall moving, absolutely no context on how this thing was going to behave after
996.48s: the release.
997.48s: And again, going back to the original thing I tried to continue to explain you guys,
1000.64s: because I know that there's a lot of people that are really into just holding and that
1003.76s: is totally cool.
1005.60s: I am a trader.
1006.72s: I move in.
1007.72s: I move out.
1008.72s: I have to.
1009.72s: It is literally my lifeblood.
1011.12s: So even though I could just buy $25,000 of GameStop and then just hold it, absolutely could
1015.96s: do that.
1016.96s: It's not really any sort of usable or useful demonstration of my approach to stuff like
1023.52s: this.
1024.52s: And that's really the broader goal behind talking about these traits is just to give you
1028.00s: ideas on other approaches, how things might work.
1032.68s: And it's all just knowledge tools for the toolbox for you to be aware of whether it's
1036.92s: something that you like.
1037.92s: Don't like totally cool.
1038.92s: I get it.
1039.92s: You got to do it's right for you.
1040.92s: All right.
1041.92s: So what I'm explaining to you is from the original entries again, back on eight November,
1048.00s: which is way back here.
1049.32s: It's pretty far back in time.
1052.56s: And as things are trending around, you can take a look at the total range from when I
1057.56s: got into this.
1060.12s: And if we draw a line from peak, we made 40%.
1065.12s: And that was actually one of the reasons why you started seeing me off loading some shares
1071.20s: in January.
1072.20s: That was the exact purpose is because it was a really solid move and it was me trimming
1078.32s: some profits.
1080.40s: So in case you guys don't know, we do have a love story that was built by GameStop on
1085.12s: this live stream.
1086.12s: You've heard it here first and it is between our very own day swag and Lauren.
1090.24s: Just in case you guys know love does exist even online and I mean, what better facilitator
1096.48s: than GameStop.
1097.72s: But that part aside, shout out to those two.
1105.28s: Sure the peak that we hit in January, we really have not been back near it.
1112.20s: So you can see we fell down.
1113.72s: We had this pretty aggressive sell off really on not a lot of news that was fairly informative
1120.68s: to me.
1122.24s: And we kind of continue trending down, down, down.
1125.12s: And I remember discreetly that I was actually looking at taking an exit here, but I had a
1130.60s: couple of things going on.
1131.96s: So I actually just said I'll just hold the shares and deal with it later, which is
1135.16s: exactly what had happened.
1136.48s: I'll tell you the later.
1138.08s: So as it's going down, it's not a big loss or anything.
1142.28s: It really doesn't matter.
1143.72s: But from a trader's lens, it's not doing anything for me.
1147.16s: It's not making me money.
1148.60s: It's just capital that's committed to something that's not really doing what I need it to
1154.46s: do.
1155.80s: So because of that, that's why you saw me take that rotational exit on the 7th of April.
1162.48s: All I did was take my shares down at a small loss, like a thousand bucks.
1167.96s: And then I moved them into short puts.
1171.12s: The short put position that I put on was sized specifically to cover the cost of this
1178.76s: loss.
1180.28s: So you can see the original trade that went on was this.
1186.32s: It was the 10 20, I'm sorry, it was a four lot of the 23s.
1193.08s: And the reason why the math is like this is because I had another trade on at the same
1196.96s: time.
1197.96s: So you'll see what I'm talking about.
1199.48s: So if we take a look at that four lot that went out on 7th April, right?
1203.56s: You can directly attach these two things that I did.
1207.08s: So these two things happen on the same day.
1210.80s: I take these down, I move into these and the overall credit on these generally overcomes
1218.88s: the P&L loss on these.
1222.08s: That's the idea.
1223.60s: Now again, the reason why it's not it's off by like 30 bucks or whatever is because I
1227.16s: had another position on existing already.
1230.72s: So just for context, it was this one.
1233.72s: So this was also out at the same time.
1236.44s: So between these two different positions, you'll notice that the realized P&L on those
1242.80s: short puts was not actually anywhere near enough to overwhelm this loss.
1249.48s: You'll see that I took them down for a dollar eight loss.
1253.92s: Why would I have done that?
1257.72s: Any guesses?
1258.72s: It was a four lot.
1260.56s: And I closed it for a dollar eight.
1263.20s: There's a very specific reason why I made that move.
1268.84s: And if you take a look at what's on right now, you can see what I recently added this
1274.84s: one.
1276.44s: So then you can take a hypothetical guess that it was something to do with this trade.
1283.68s: Joe says to vacation, nope, that one wasn't for vacation.
1288.52s: I think I might have adjusted that one while I was traveling.
1292.20s: If I think that adjustment is literally while I was traveling, Reese says by equity that's
1298.48s: not correct either good guess what ended up happening here is you'll still see I have
1302.92s: no shares.
1303.92s: It's all in short puts.
1306.56s: Here's what happened.
1308.80s: As I'm doing the math and I'll try to draw it out.
1314.24s: I don't I never know if the drawing is like useful or not useful.
1317.68s: But I hope it at least helps a little bit.
1319.92s: That's the at least that's the intention behind it.
1324.68s: All right.
1330.52s: Or not all right.
1331.52s: Yo, open up.
1333.32s: Here we go.
1335.72s: Okay.
1336.64s: Let's give us a little bit of.
1344.20s: This is fine.
1346.88s: Okay.
1348.04s: So here's the original position down here.
1351.20s: We have 400 don't all this don't even worry about it for the context of this conversation.
1356.40s: So there's 400 shares at 25 75.
1364.40s: And over this time frame game stops rolling over.
1367.20s: So what we do is we close these for 2308.
1372.36s: This realizes this loss of 1070.
1378.64s: So now I find an opportunity to take my original trade.
1384.12s: The first thing I want you to pay attention to is the change in basis.
1389.00s: What we do is we take this point specifically.
1398.04s: We look at what the basis originally was 25 75.
1406.48s: And I was able to sell a four lot for 255 at the 23.
1413.24s: So what did I do here?
1414.64s: I literally just reduced my basis by 275 by making this transition.
1420.88s: So what that means is if I got assigned on this position rather than being stuck with
1426.12s: the basis of 25 75.
1427.76s: And now of the basis of 23.
1429.52s: And if I took assignment at that, I effectively would have been at a scratch compared to this
1434.92s: original position.
1436.44s: Because again, this original position would have lost 1070.
1439.32s: This other position would have made me 1020.
1442.80s: So I'm down 50 bucks.
1444.60s: That's if I did nothing else.
1446.68s: So what I did is I use that move as an opportunity to make this change.
1452.12s: And if you'll recall when I made that move on 7th April, it still wasn't above my
1457.88s: cost basis.
1458.88s: That's why I sold it for a loss.
1460.60s: So I was able to take a cost basis that otherwise was too high.
1464.96s: And I was able to put it in short puts that were slightly out of the money.
1468.04s: So really aggressive adjustment that was timed honestly very well.
1471.80s: And the reason all of this exists is really from a timing perspective trying to align with
1477.44s: what price behavior is.
1479.04s: There is no master plan at the beginning of this trade to say like at this point, I'm
1483.72s: going to do blank.
1484.72s: And it's because I have absolutely no idea what it's going to be doing at some point
1489.44s: in the future.
1490.44s: It's all context dependent.
1493.20s: Rare view says Uncle Sammy going to love you for those short turn gain sales.
1498.04s: That is a really common misconception.
1502.20s: The part that I will leave you with is there are a lot of ways you can structure yourself
1509.48s: who be in a much better tax position than just being a standard retail trader using a standard
1516.88s: brokerage account.
1518.36s: Some thoughts food for food for thought, something to chew on.
1522.36s: But the other thing I'll always remind people with even when I wasn't structured as I
1527.56s: am now.
1529.28s: The short term capital gains doesn't, it's you pay capital gains on what you make.
1537.64s: And you can try to make more later with other amounts of money.
1542.80s: It does open a really important point though, which is if you do not make enough once you
1550.84s: include all of the friction of your conduct of business, which also includes commissions,
1557.64s: which is part of all of this to rare views point.
1560.60s: It's not even just taxes that I'm dealing with.
1562.48s: I'm dealing with slippage.
1564.60s: I'm dealing with commissions.
1567.08s: So you have to track all of these activities and make sure that what you're doing is still
1573.20s: more profitable than what you would be doing otherwise, which is super, super important.
1578.88s: You can also trade things in like tax advantaged accounts.
1584.08s: So if I was doing this in a Roth IRA, there's no taxes, right?
1588.32s: So there's a lot of different things you can do.
1591.04s: The only reason I'm taking the time to talk about this is a lot of people just get in
1594.28s: the mindset of, oh, I'm not going to trade because a short term capital gains tax, I
1597.28s: heard that that's really bad.
1599.08s: And it can be if you suck at trading and you're getting taxed bad on top of it, that's
1602.80s: a terrible scenario.
1604.32s: But if you're okay at this, it can just be a cost of doing business.
1608.80s: You don't want to pay it, but it is what it is.
1614.88s: Ruta Begis says, doesn't this positioning leave you unexposed to some random crazy moves?
1620.48s: Yes and no.
1622.24s: What anybody that follows the saga so far with how I trade GameStop, what do you think I would
1628.76s: say to that response is to why I'm not concerned at all about being unexposed to some random
1635.68s: crazy moves?
1636.96s: Any guesses?
1640.16s: Sky Shadek says, heard someone say, if you're worried about taxes, that's a good problem
1643.48s: to have.
1644.48s: We call it a high class problem.
1645.76s: Trying to minimize your tax footprint is a high class problem.
1649.08s: You only pay taxes on what you make.
1651.16s: So that's the exact, that's the exact point that sky is making.
1657.96s: Recess can always buy equity.
1660.40s: Bingo.
1661.40s: Darkmark says you'll see the volume.
1663.64s: Bingo.
1664.64s: Recess if volume shows up.
1665.64s: Bingo.
1666.64s: That's exactly correct.
1667.92s: There has literally never been a random crazy move in GameStop that was not preceded
1673.36s: by volume.
1675.24s: So it doesn't matter to me.
1676.68s: Right now volume is, it's not terrible.
1679.40s: Oh shit.
1680.40s: I mean, I do this giant slash.
1682.80s: Volume is not terrible, but it's definitely not good.
1685.72s: Meaning thinking it's something like that.
1688.56s: Because if you take a look at when I scaled out, there was this massive volume around
1692.48s: earnings.
1694.12s: Why do you think that there wasn't an exit on the 26th March?
1699.08s: Because volume showed up the day before.
1702.00s: It showed up on the day following earnings.
1704.68s: I have no idea what's going on, but I'm going to hold the equity for sure.
1709.28s: Then volume peaks here to the downside, unfortunately, but volume was still there.
1713.84s: Still held shares.
1715.56s: What do you notice about the day that I entered the trade?
1719.36s: Volume had been contracting.
1721.64s: The five day average volume was already firmly below the 20 day average volume.
1727.96s: Five day average volume was downward sloping.
1730.80s: So the volume was siphoning out at this point.
1733.76s: So felt very, very little risk of missing the boat in that way.
1739.20s: All that being said, I still could have.
1742.00s: There always could be that anomalous condition.
1745.12s: That something just happens to fly on a specific day and I didn't have the shares on in that
1751.36s: context.
1752.92s: Again, the way that you have to trade as a trader is from a broader probabilistic analysis.
1760.80s: For the number of conditions where I would have to keep my money invested in something
1765.56s: that's not otherwise doing what I want.
1767.84s: If in the event there's a parabolic move, it means I'm going to be tying capital up
1774.92s: for extremely long durations.
1778.16s: And the net profit on that, even if you get a 600% return, still can lag this more active
1784.40s: style if again, you're doing it well.
1787.92s: So I accept that opportunity risk because it is a business risk.
1793.56s: There's no doubt about it.
1795.08s: It's just that based on the historic precedent that we've seen in GameStop and really any
1799.84s: other kind of meme stock name that you've heard is volume always has proceeded.
1806.16s: There has not been an instance.
1807.76s: Number of volume has not proceeded.
1809.92s: The real big moves.
1811.44s: Now I've talked about this before.
1812.80s: It does mean I'm not going to bottom ticket.
1814.72s: It means that I'm not going to get in at the absolute lowest price if I'm waiting for
1818.00s: some confirmation of volume before I start scaling in.
1820.28s: It's again, this is a decision because what I'm doing is I'm scaling in as it's a higher
1825.20s: probability of the move happening.
1827.72s: So then instead of me sitting there holding the bat and holding the bat is kind of the
1832.68s: same as having your money in a trade, your capital committed.
1836.36s: Kind of just sitting there holding the bat and you're just swinging at everything.
1840.20s: And then you end up getting tired or whatever.
1842.52s: The comparative or the comparison here would be that I'm waiting until there is a weak
1847.32s: picture that I do well against.
1849.72s: And then I'm going to go out and swing like that kind of thing.
1853.24s: So it's just a very tactical.
1854.72s: It's an active approach.
1856.00s: That's exactly what I'm doing.
1858.00s: So back to a couple of the key things of the adjustment here.
1862.48s: So this movement here essentially locking in almost a $50 loss, which would have been
1869.32s: the total net, it reduced my total basis by 275.
1873.28s: It's a big change on something like this.
1875.40s: It's essentially a 10% plus change.
1878.44s: So this gave me a 10% basis change.
1882.44s: Basis decrease, which is great.
1884.76s: Now the reason why you see this here, the trade coming down for a dollar eight and you'll
1890.24s: notice that the realized PNL is a long cry away from this 1020 that otherwise I was banking
1896.68s: on in order to recoup the loss that was booked down lower.
1902.24s: So here's what's going on with that.
1905.76s: If we scroll up, I guess I'll hide this so it's not so confusing.
1910.04s: If we scroll up, you'll notice on the 26th of March, there is this existing position,
1916.68s: the four that's essentially $472 of premium.
1920.68s: This one expires on 16 May.
1923.08s: So that one is existing.
1925.92s: And this is essentially the change that you see happen here.
1931.92s: What I did was take this trade down.
1934.72s: I took another existing trade that I had down these two combined make 1083.
1941.00s: These two combined already overwhelmed this loss.
1944.56s: So that loss is booked and covered.
1947.04s: And again, this isn't even including the net PNL that I needed to recover because there
1951.40s: was a profitable close before that.
1954.80s: So all of this is said between these two trades, these already covered this loss.
1960.44s: So now I literally have a completely blank slate.
1965.36s: So I have 25s, the 25 strike that's out in 30 May.
1971.84s: And I have the 26 strike that's out in 16 May.
1975.28s: I'm using 60% of the allocation.
1978.80s: And it's a completely blank slate at this point.
1981.32s: All of the prior trades have been successfully managed into really what I need them to be.
1987.80s: And if you take a look at the overall profile for the trade, again, take a look at the difference
1997.88s: in overall performance.
2001.08s: If you look at the percent change, this is essentially from when I started this exercise,
2006.32s: if I had just bought shares and did nothing else, bought shares on the day I started this
2011.58s: exercise, it would have been 2431 I bought.
2014.56s: They would be at 2746 now.
2016.40s: It's a 13% gain.
2018.60s: That's what it would have been if I did nothing.
2020.92s: So far, I have a 22% realized and unrealized game.
2026.60s: It's important to call that out because part of this game is dependent on this one.
2031.04s: It's money here.
2032.44s: So I make that caveat because I'm not trying to over sell the performance.
2037.20s: There's a difference between what's realized and unrealized.
2039.68s: So for example, if I move this down to give you the realized PNL just for like what's
2045.16s: been booked as a win, booked PNL is 10.3%.
2055.52s: But again, if you compare that against this 13, this is realized.
2061.00s: This 13% appear is unrealized.
2063.72s: It means it's attached to open shares in order to realize that 13% you would have had
2068.56s: to close it.
2069.56s: That's why I don't compare it that way.
2071.64s: It's why I compare it like this because this is also unrealized plus realized.
2076.72s: This one wouldn't have any realized segment to it.
2079.40s: So it's to create an apples to apples comparison.
2082.76s: So this is where we sit right now with GameStop.
2084.96s: I really do think about 60% is overall close to what I would want to be.
2091.72s: I think I might scale in a little bit more.
2095.04s: But again, with volume as light as it is, I'm not over eager.
2099.92s: I'm actually kind of waiting to see what kind of activity we can get out of it before
2106.80s: I start scaling in more capital.
2108.92s: And the main reason is again, this is the cool part about trading actively.
2114.00s: I am in order to get this 12.96% return from here to here, you need to use all of your
2121.20s: money.
2122.40s: That means all of the $25,000 that we started this exercise with, that's what yields the
2127.48s: 13% return.
2129.56s: The difference is this 22% return has been made without us ever even going over 90% utilized.
2137.56s: I've never been more than 90% utilized in this exercise.
2140.28s: I think the highest I was is like mid 80s or something like that.
2143.96s: So it's outperforming the buy and hold equivalent using less money, equaling less total risk.
2152.56s: So that's where we sit with that trade.
2156.20s: If there's any questions on it, let me know.
2158.76s: As always, happy to explain it.
2160.36s: I do my best to try to show you the logic behind what I'm doing and why.
2167.72s: Let's see.
2168.72s: Juicebox says, if I expect it to hit 34 by June, what's the most profitable call option
2173.00s: spread I can make?
2175.00s: Well, a couple of things.
2179.36s: I can tell, I can tell by that question that you're really unfamiliar with options and
2184.68s: that's not a dig at you.
2185.68s: I can just tell by the vernacular you use.
2188.96s: And what I would tell you for that is, before you trade options, you want to have a pretty
2196.88s: good understanding of them.
2198.44s: Otherwise, you're kind of stepping in front of something that is more likely to hurt
2202.88s: you than to help you.
2204.64s: That being said, I'll still answer your question.
2206.40s: I'm just offering that piece of information for you to do what you will.
2213.00s: But we literally can model it together.
2216.48s: The way to think about this is that you want to strike a balance and especially if we're
2221.68s: saying by June, right?
2223.80s: So that tells us that we don't want to go super far out beyond June.
2228.12s: Juicebox says, I'm good with options.
2231.32s: If you say so, I, again, I can tell you literally by the language that you're using that you're
2236.32s: not.
2237.32s: But if you think you are, then you are.
2241.76s: Now, if we take a look at what the most, one of the more, again, most would be relative,
2249.20s: depending on how the actual return path looks.
2252.76s: But if we take a look at the June expiration and we think that it's going to go to 34.
2260.64s: Now a really common way to try to trade this is, oh, I'll buy the 34 calls, which again,
2270.32s: depending on the way that you think it's going to go is really important because the path
2277.40s: of returns that it's going to take is really important to determine what is going to make
2284.68s: more money.
2285.68s: And I'll explain what that means.
2286.68s: Juicebox says, I'm driving.
2288.08s: That's not, again, I'm not trying to get it to you.
2291.16s: I can, it's literally the words that you're using.
2294.00s: Obstetrator wouldn't say most profitable call option spread, like that, that series of
2298.96s: words.
2300.20s: And then also you saying, I can make.
2303.04s: That's also, we would never say those words.
2305.96s: It's like if you hear somebody talking about something that you are very familiar with,
2311.56s: right?
2312.56s: So Juicebox then says single leg, but you said call option spread.
2316.48s: So this is the point.
2317.80s: Again, it's just to make sure that you are aware that if you say that you're good with
2323.32s: options, but you're talking about them like that, like you're not, you're not.
2327.20s: And that's okay.
2328.20s: You cannot be super savvy with options.
2331.64s: But what's dangerous is if you tell yourself that you're good with them, but then you're
2336.04s: not.
2337.04s: That's where it gets really dangerous.
2338.92s: Anyways, all that aside intervention aside, if you're good with options, you're good
2342.96s: with options.
2344.56s: Now, right?
2346.32s: Now if the next big question to ask though, to like to give you a natural answer, juicebox,
2353.48s: is what is the return path that you expect over this time frame?
2358.00s: And here's what I mean by this.
2360.00s: If we take a look at the next 55 days, is it your hypothesis that GameStop would move
2368.00s: a lot in the near term?
2370.48s: Do you think it's going to move a lot as you get closer to June?
2375.08s: The reason why I'm asking this is because the blanket answer here is units would be the
2380.64s: most profitable, buying a ton of really cheap far out of the money options.
2385.80s: That would be the most profitable.
2387.52s: But depending on what expiration you pick, it's going to look a lot different depending
2391.56s: on how long it takes to get there.
2393.76s: It matters a lot and it is everything to do with the way that options decay.
2398.04s: So let's take a look at an example here.
2400.88s: If I were expecting personally, hypothetical scenario because I'm not, but if I were expecting
2408.44s: 34 in GameStop, come June.
2411.60s: I think it's going to be sometime between now and June, but I really don't know when
2419.32s: in that time frame, the move is going to happen.
2422.52s: So June is kind of the end state that I'm looking at, but I really don't have a sense
2426.80s: leading into June where the move is most likely to kick off.
2430.72s: Well, it tells me that buying units is unlikely to going to be really useful to me because
2438.72s: you'll see why here.
2440.32s: So let's say I think again, that same thing sometime by June and let's say that the other
2446.52s: scenario here is, and again, I would have to know this from juice boxes lens to kind
2450.64s: of tailor the response to him.
2452.72s: But is it leading into June?
2454.68s: Do we think that we're going to kind of hang around this level, meaning the 28 to the
2459.68s: 24?
2460.68s: Do we think it'll be tighter?
2461.68s: Do we think it'll be closer to like the 27 handle?
2464.16s: Do we think it might drift up into the higher 20s?
2467.40s: And really we're starting to see a floor here at 26.
2471.20s: All of these things matter for shaping what we would consider to be optimal.
2475.24s: Now the reality of trading is what I'm asking him to do is essentially impossible, right?
2482.36s: Nobody knows all this stuff.
2483.56s: It's a series of guesses and that's okay.
2485.80s: It really depends on the conviction.
2488.04s: But the short answer is if I think this thing is going to go to 34 and let's just say
2494.36s: it's sometimes soon, what I would do is I would go out far out of the money.
2498.12s: I would pick like maybe these five delta something like that, the 90s.
2504.40s: And let's say that I have a $5,000 bankroll.
2509.08s: So we go into analyzer.
2510.72s: Let's say that that's the risk that I want to put on in the trade, not the bankroll,
2514.56s: but that's the total risk I want to put on.
2516.76s: So we already know that we can put on a really big position.
2522.16s: So let's do like two, let me see, 32 cents, three two times.
2534.16s: Yeah, it's a little less than 200.
2538.60s: It's like 150.
2540.36s: You can get like 150 of these.
2543.80s: Give or take if you wanted to spend 5 grand.
2546.60s: So the reason why this is the more profitable thing you could do is if we add the theoretical
2552.16s: price here at 34.
2555.52s: And you'll see what you'd make at 34.
2557.00s: You'd make $7,600.
2558.96s: So you would double your money and then some.
2562.56s: Now if you think the move is going to happen sooner, you would want to use sooner options.
2568.92s: And it's because they're cheaper.
2570.84s: You can buy even more of those units.
2574.20s: Thus you can build an even bigger position.
2577.64s: So again, for that example, we've used the 50s and we can get those for 12 cents.
2584.20s: That puts us grabbing like 4.75.
2592.04s: And then comparatively, if you take a look at what the P and L would be at that point,
2596.84s: would be 26 135.
2599.84s: Juice box says with 5K, you wouldn't get the 20 strikes.
2602.44s: Again, I'm answering the original question.
2604.96s: And what I'm trying to show is what the most profitable approach is.
2612.12s: This is hands down the most unrealistic approach, by the way, most unrealistic.
2618.72s: What I'm doing is I'm optimizing for something that we're pretending to know, but we don't
2622.80s: meaning that it's going to go to a super high level in a short term time frame.
2626.52s: What I'm trying to show you is that the concept of units is really important.
2630.16s: And it's simple as this.
2633.00s: Even though these have a tiny delta, a delta of .04.
2637.12s: Again, let's use our Excel sheet because I think it'll make this a little more clear.
2643.60s: Now, it's clear everything here.
2646.48s: So let's take a look at some of these different positions.
2648.80s: So we're saying that we have a $5,000 bankroll to use.
2653.88s: And in one scenario, I'm showing you that we were able to get what is that 150 loss.
2663.52s: Another scenario, I showed you that we're going to get 475 loss.
2668.24s: And if we take a look just from a raw delta lens, I don't care about anything else in this
2675.32s: context other than delta.
2677.76s: You can see that the 150 here has a delta of 822.
2686.56s: The 475 in the 16 maize, those have a delta of 1890.
2695.12s: Here's what's happening.
2696.88s: When you're buying really cheap, really far out of the money options, you can buy so many
2702.60s: of them to still get a really high aggregate delta.
2708.24s: And what I mean is this, let's look by comparison.
2712.24s: Let's say the 55s and let's say you think it's going to go to 34.
2715.40s: So you do what most people would try to logically do and you would go to the 34 strike itself.
2723.04s: So let's see how many at the 34 strike itself we could get.
2728.84s: And those are trading for $1.89.
2731.96s: So we have $5,000 divided by $289.
2735.20s: It gives us 26 contracts.
2738.04s: So we can get 26 contracts of these for the same relative cost.
2746.40s: And you can see the delta that these give you is 876.
2753.64s: Now this is me being slightly lazy because I'll do the actual math so that it's a true
2758.64s: like like comparison, so $5,000 divided by 32.
2763.12s: It gives us 156 contracts.
2765.60s: The reason is this wouldn't actually have more delta in the aggregate.
2769.48s: It would be like this.
2771.00s: It would be like 854.
2773.48s: Okay.
2776.76s: So here's the comparison.
2779.16s: You can essentially buy 26 options and get 876 delta.
2784.56s: You can buy 475 options.
2786.52s: This is the New York term expiration and get 1890 delta.
2790.36s: You can get 150 options and get 854 delta.
2793.68s: This is also further out in time.
2795.72s: So this is the idea of units.
2797.84s: Even though you're buying things that have infinitismally smaller delta than this one
2803.20s: or things that are closer to being at the money, you can buy so many of them that you
2807.96s: can eventually brute force your delta.
2812.40s: Sky Shadex says the magic of convexity.
2815.44s: That's actually the ultimate P&L factor.
2818.40s: But actually the thing I'm showing you right now is nothing to do with convexity.
2825.20s: Convexity comes in as you get the move.
2828.52s: So what Sky Shadex is referring to is if we take a look at what the total max delta.
2835.80s: So this is current delta's.
2839.60s: This is max delta's meaning how many total delta's does this thing represent?
2845.44s: And it's literally this times 100.
2849.60s: I don't want that.
2852.08s: I just want.
2855.36s: So what Sky is referring to is what the delta's can become if you get a big move.
2864.12s: So the max delta meaning if they wind up deep in the money and they become a delta
2868.72s: of one, these are the max delta's they can achieve.
2872.40s: So if you take a look at what the total delta's are as a percentage of the max, they're
2876.36s: actually very small on a relative basis for the far out of the money ones.
2881.60s: And it's because they need a big move in order to become what they can be to grow into
2887.28s: the total position they can be.
2889.36s: So what Sky is referring to is actually the context where these start to grow into
2896.64s: these.
2898.08s: And you can see these are way larger positions, totally than this.
2903.04s: And that's why in a big enough move, these would absolutely smoke the return profile
2909.16s: of the one where you buy the strike where you think it's going to go.
2913.32s: Because this can only go a little bit higher on a relative basis, right?
2918.20s: So you have 67% delta growth here.
2922.12s: Here you have like 96% delta growth.
2926.76s: So these can turn into huge trades.
2929.12s: So what that actually looks like to show you in context, I have no idea how logical this
2933.92s: is for you guys.
2934.92s: I don't know what the general understanding of options is, but let's target a price of
2938.72s: 50 and let's just click through these.
2940.88s: What you're going to notice is this will get to its maximum delta faster and then it
2950.50s: moves dollar for dollar with the underlying.
2952.76s: So that means that this will get to its delta of 2600 quickly relative to these.
2957.84s: And then that's as high as it's going to get.
2960.04s: These will take longer to get to their maximum delta's.
2963.32s: But if they get there, these end up moving as the underlying moves a dollar, these move
2970.24s: huge amounts of dollars comparatively.
2973.76s: So if you take a look at the 26.
2979.16s: Lots that we bought and we look at what the P&L would be, it would be $40,000.
2985.08s: If we take a look at the 156 lots on that same price, those become $53,000.
2993.56s: And then if you take a look at the 475 lots, those become $290,000 at 50, meaning a giant
3000.98s: move, by the way, 100% move.
3003.28s: But what I'm showing you is again, answering the original question of what makes the most
3007.08s: money, what makes the most money is where you can get the most delta's if you get the
3011.32s: actual move you're looking for.
3013.24s: Now all of that aside, the ability to time and to be able to buy these at a point that
3022.88s: then it moves in the direction that you want quick enough is kind of like your ability
3029.64s: to win the lottery.
3030.84s: Like that it really kind of is like that.
3033.44s: And here's why what's going to happen with this trade is time is going to pass.
3042.20s: And as time passes, your position actually needs a bigger and bigger move in order to make
3049.80s: you money.
3050.80s: So let's eyeball what that looks like here.
3055.48s: Let's take a look at I'm just going to mark down where we're at today.
3060.52s: And let's use a plus 15% move.
3063.40s: Let's say that we get a really, really big move in our favor.
3066.44s: Actually, let's use a 10% move.
3069.00s: So this will be a plus 10% move.
3075.84s: It thinks I'm trying to do math, but I'm not.
3079.24s: And let's now take a look at what happens as we fast forward time, what we make.
3089.20s: So today is going to be this is using 26 April.
3093.00s: I want to track the days so that you can clearly see what I'm talking about.
3097.28s: And at that 10% move, you make 71, 1, 1, 8.
3102.56s: If you get a 10% move, you're going to make 7 grand.
3106.04s: Okay.
3107.04s: Now let's fast forward time.
3109.56s: Let's say that time passes, I think these are in 16 May.
3114.48s: So let's go two weeks forward.
3116.64s: Let's go to two May.
3119.44s: What do you notice that just happened to your return?
3122.60s: If we go two weeks forward now to two May and you take a look at what your PNL is, it's
3128.44s: $443.
3130.72s: Here.
3136.48s: So what just happened to us?
3139.16s: So this minus this divided by this, your max profit just cratered by 94% not max profit.
3148.92s: That's incorrect.
3149.92s: Your relative profit, I should say.
3152.08s: And the reason why I should say that is because max profit still is unlimited if it goes
3157.72s: up.
3158.72s: But what I'm showing you is as two weeks pass, this same 10% move.
3164.16s: If you got the 10% move today, just pretend the market was open, it's using, you know,
3169.60s: just near term pricing, you would make 71, 18.
3173.64s: But if that 10% move happens in just two weeks from now, you make $443.
3179.76s: So the amount that you would have made has now decreased by 94%.
3184.64s: This is the cost of holding these units.
3189.28s: That's the Theta decay.
3191.04s: The reason why there's so much Theta decay is when you look at the option, you will say
3195.80s: something like, well, wait a minute, there's really not that much Theta in these.
3200.80s: There's, there's so far out of the money.
3204.64s: So let's go to here.
3208.52s: Let's go to the 50s.
3210.64s: Your Theta is two cents.
3213.96s: It's two cents on something that's only 12.
3217.36s: I think it was we would buy it for 12.
3221.16s: So your daily Theta decay is two cents on something you bought for 12.
3226.00s: On a percentage basis, your Theta decay is fucking huge.
3230.32s: So what that means is as time passes and as these remain super far out of the money,
3236.24s: you effectively need a tremendous move in order to make a good amount of money.
3244.80s: So to summarize everything, you just learned.
3247.76s: You learned the idea of what units are.
3251.60s: If we're talking about the hypothetical scenario of what would the most profitable trade be,
3257.00s: it would be where you could accumulate the maximum number of deltas within the time frame
3262.04s: you're suspecting the move would happen.
3264.72s: The cost to this is that if you are incorrect in terms of your timing, you are severely,
3272.56s: severely punished, especially if it's a shorter term trade idea.
3277.76s: So now this opens the better question in my opinion, which is how might we strike balance?
3286.72s: If we think it might hit 34 sometime between now and June, what kind of trade structure
3293.08s: might make sense in the context of we don't know if the move is going to happen in two
3297.40s: weeks.
3298.52s: And we can see other trades where if we fast forward two weeks, even though it might not
3303.28s: make the same amount of money, if you got that 10% move today, it will make way more money.
3307.64s: If you get the 10% move and two weeks happen to have passed.
3310.92s: And the way that we do this is we buy options that actually have higher deltas.
3316.60s: So this is what that can look like.
3319.36s: Well, first, let me take a giant pause.
3323.16s: Does what I just explained does that make sense?
3326.88s: Are we understanding the idea of units and are we understanding the cost of holding
3331.48s: those units, the cost of gaining that convexity via gamma, the cost associated with theta,
3338.12s: and how important the timing is for your idea?
3342.32s: Because if you're trying to do something via timing and you're buying units, you are
3346.88s: on the clock.
3347.88s: You've got to be good with your timing.
3350.56s: Now there are cheaper ways, admittedly, in order to run this kind of concept, but it's
3356.56s: still expensive.
3358.16s: And it's almost like maintaining front spot volatility in some sort of volume decks.
3363.92s: You buy units that are really cheap, really far out of the money in the front expiration,
3368.64s: because they're already essentially decayed down.
3370.44s: There's not much more that can decay out of them.
3373.32s: So if you go to the 50s here, you get them for two cents.
3377.24s: So what you can do is you can grab the 50s in this front expiration.
3380.88s: You can size your trade down.
3382.40s: You don't have to use the entire five grand, but you can use a relative amount of money
3386.80s: that allows you to try this trade multiple times for the same total cost.
3392.36s: It's still a low probability trade, which is another way you can do it versus doing something
3396.64s: like buying them that are 16 days out.
3398.72s: I definitely would not do that.
3400.04s: Or I'm sorry, in 16 May, which is 20 days out.
3402.84s: Definitely would not do that.
3404.48s: If I thought the move, for example, might happen between now and 16 May, I would buy
3410.84s: the front expiration far out of the monies.
3414.72s: I would essentially just write it off as a loss, but then I would model it so that if the
3419.96s: move does happen, you can see how much you can actually make, because let's make that
3425.64s: point.
3426.64s: If we have a $5,000 bankroll, and I think the move is going to happen sometimes over
3431.48s: the next three expiration cycles.
3434.48s: So actually, we can keep all these.
3439.28s: Let's get rid of these.
3443.80s: So we know that essentially, we're going to split this up between three expiration cycles,
3450.04s: because that's when we think the move is going to happen.
3452.04s: So we have 1667, we get to use on any one of these individual expiration cycles.
3458.20s: So these are trading at two cents, those 1667 divided by two bucks, you get 833 contracts.
3470.28s: I forgot where those were, to be honest, here, 833.
3478.92s: So we have 833 contracts that we can get effectively this front week.
3483.92s: The current delta on those, if we grabbed 833 of these.
3490.24s: Again, by the way, this is a terrible, terrible idea, terrible idea.
3497.16s: I'm literally just giving it to you for context.
3500.04s: These actually, you have to get them for three pennies, my bad, because I had it on the
3503.04s: sell side, and you're not going to be able to play a bit of spread on these there.
3506.16s: When you're buying units, you're essentially going to have to cross the bit of spread.
3509.28s: That's just the nature of the beast.
3511.24s: So 1667 now divided by three, you get 555 contracts, 555.
3519.72s: Okay.
3521.72s: And now we get our position on.
3528.48s: Here's what happens.
3530.64s: If time passes during this front time frame, so again, let's say that we're expecting
3537.52s: this 10% move this line, as we fast forward each day, as time passes, you'll see that
3545.60s: the clock is ticking against you.
3548.08s: Absolutely.
3549.08s: But you can only lose that 1667.
3552.68s: Whereas if we take a look in that other scenario where we're going out to 16 May, you might
3557.28s: end up overpaying because you're gaining exposure to a couple of explorations out if
3561.84s: the move is actually set to happen sooner.
3564.56s: This is only in the context of you somehow have this massively high conviction that you
3570.80s: think a big move is going to happen within a certain time frame.
3574.32s: What I'm literally telling you is that this is the ideal way to light your money on fire.
3580.40s: That is the overwhelming outcome from trying to trade it this way.
3584.60s: But again, I'm just talking about the concepts and the structures behind this so that you
3589.40s: at least have an idea to answer that question because that's, I mean, really the broad goal,
3596.00s: right?
3597.00s: And this video here is a video that talks about some of this concept, but more specifically,
3606.48s: it talks about how to buy call options smarter in something like GameStop specifically.
3612.32s: Because things like GameStop that are really high volatility have a very different return
3616.64s: profile in terms of how they will behave.
3619.44s: Things that are really high volatility have a higher cost for the leverage.
3623.48s: So that video that I just posted in there is really the upfront more applicable answer
3630.76s: to what juice box is probably actually trying to ask, which is not the actual like what
3637.80s: is the most profitable, but what is the fair idea to capitalize on this move?
3644.60s: That's what that video goes through.
3650.56s: So any questions on any of that stuff?
3654.32s: Again, this isn't really just for GameStop.
3656.36s: This is just talking about how options behave, but we're talking about how options behave
3661.00s: in this scenario in the context of GameStop, which I actually think is a really good conversation
3665.84s: by the way, because GameStop brings a lot of really interesting nuance to the equation.
3674.24s: Okay, looks like we're good.
3679.72s: All right, so we have a little bit of time left.
3684.44s: Do we want to go to the DD library or do we want to just poke through the latest news
3688.64s: with GameStop and stuff like that?
3690.48s: I'm going to make a video on just like actually deep diving the current markets on the GameStop
3696.56s: because I haven't done that in a while.
3698.20s: I'm planning to do that next week.
3700.24s: So that's on the horizon just to inform your answer, but we haven't done the DD library
3705.72s: in a while on having to do that or we can spend 10, 15 minutes just poking through the
3710.52s: sock and seeing if there's anything that jumps out at us.
3713.92s: I haven't done that in a while admittedly.
3715.96s: I've been managing a bunch of my other positions because of how the market has been behaving
3722.40s: more broadly.
3725.56s: GC says DD library, you got it.
3729.32s: Thor is not in here.
3730.76s: He was going to grab his dinner.
3732.56s: So I don't know if he's done with dinner, but he definitely would be done with dinner.
3738.84s: He's probably just chilling out there.
3741.48s: All right, let's grab the DD library.
3743.56s: I actually don't even fucking remember where we left off.
3746.32s: You guys will have to help me here.
3749.92s: I'm going to need some help.
3755.36s: Juice box says, dude, I gave you a price target and you told me about 90 strikes.
3759.92s: Yeah, you gave me a price target in the context of a question.
3765.44s: And as somebody said that you know about options, then I answered your question, like your
3772.08s: actual question that you asked.
3774.08s: This is one of the important things.
3775.88s: Again, especially as somebody who knows options is, I obviously then would think that you
3781.52s: know the question that you're asking, which is precisely what we just explored, which
3787.16s: is the most profitable way.
3790.04s: My talking about 90 strikes and you latching on to 90 strikes as if that means that we were
3796.12s: talking about the entirely wrong thing that reaffirms what I was talking about before in the
3802.28s: context of I actually don't think you have any idea what you're talking about with options.
3807.24s: It is nothing to do with the strike.
3808.92s: You're focusing too much on the strike price.
3811.40s: The 90s could literally never go in the money and they can still make tons of money if you
3817.48s: get the move in that time frame.
3819.80s: This is another common really misconception of really common misconception with respect
3823.88s: to trading options.
3824.88s: Is people think that you need your strike price to go in the money to make money and it's
3831.24s: literally objectively not the case.
3832.84s: You don't need that at all.
3834.44s: So for a juice box who seems disenfranchised that I took 20 minutes to answer the question
3842.64s: you asked, check out that other video.
3847.28s: Okay.
3848.08s: Rudebega says, wait, there's an actual library of all the DD.
3851.52s: That's cool.
3852.52s: It's very cool.
3853.52s: I don't think it's all the DD.
3855.44s: This goes back to the beginning for sure.
3857.68s: We started with like these really, really new ones.
3863.52s: Oldest to knew it.
3864.52s: So this is the order we've been going in.
3866.96s: And then I think the latest it goes up to, let's just, just 2023, 17 April 2023, just for
3874.68s: context.
3876.16s: I have absolutely no idea where we left off.
3878.16s: Remember we did one with Lauer.
3879.68s: I know we did this one.
3881.44s: I know we did this one.
3882.44s: Did this one?
3883.44s: I don't think we did this.
3884.76s: No, we did the chaos theory ones.
3887.08s: Let's just click through these really fast.
3889.20s: If I remember them.
3890.52s: Yeah.
3891.84s: I remember that one for sure.
3893.88s: Let's try this one.
3897.52s: Yeah.
3899.80s: We looked at this one already.
3903.00s: Remember this one.
3905.32s: Let's check this one.
3907.32s: I see if you see.
3914.32s: I don't remember this.
3917.24s: Do you guys remember this one?
3919.44s: Wait, I kind of do.
3923.04s: Look.
3924.04s: Let's just take a look real quick.
3930.00s: I'm actually, I don't want to skip.
3932.28s: That would be lame.
3933.28s: The whole point of this is to go through in order.
3937.44s: This one.
3941.64s: Let's see where we left off on this one.
3946.08s: Okay.
3947.08s: So we're in the D.D. library.
3951.32s: Let's see what we clicked.
3953.32s: Oh, all right.
3955.32s: Sure.
3956.32s: All right.
3960.32s: Do you mean back?
3961.92s: Do you mean theory of everything?
3965.28s: Do we saw this one?
3976.00s: Like the roll in 10 behind.
3980.16s: OK.
3981.04s: So let's go back to where we went into this one.
3984.60s: And then OK.
3990.16s: So we should be close.
3992.28s: Here we go.
3994.60s: All right.
3995.60s: So DTCC, we, I know we did that one already.
3998.20s: C-E-B-E.
3999.92s: I'm going to get an electronic book.
4002.72s: Yeah.
4003.72s: OK.
4004.72s: So we did the theory of everything.
4005.72s: That was the latest one.
4007.36s: OK.
4008.36s: Great.
4009.36s: I know exactly where we're at now.
4010.36s: Thanks for your patience.
4011.36s: I just didn't want to skip anything.
4013.72s: So we are at the beginning of the chaos theory.
4018.36s: I think this one just has pieces from another one that we've seen.
4022.28s: So yeah.
4026.68s: Wait, we've definitely seen this one.
4028.44s: Anyway, let's just click through this.
4030.16s: Yeah, we definitely have seen this one.
4031.76s: I know that for fact.
4035.88s: Because this is talking about all the attachments
4038.68s: and the connections.
4040.08s: Yeah.
4040.28s: OK.
4040.48s: I remember this.
4041.76s: Between the different entities.
4045.76s: So this is the everything connection part 1.
4048.64s: Let's take a look at 2.
4051.72s: Conflexed of interest.
4052.52s: Yeah.
4052.72s: We already remember this too.
4060.72s: OK.
4062.20s: Let's just start from here.
4063.12s: Oops.
4063.44s: Wrong one.
4065.60s: Let's just start from here.
4067.00s: These aren't that long.
4069.44s: All right.
4071.24s: Let's see.
4072.52s: Former CFTC.
4073.60s: Now works for Citadel as he chairmen.
4077.00s: Pointing to fraudulent activity and efforts to prolong necessity.
4080.20s: So for being implemented.
4081.92s: OK.
4082.24s: So this is kind of old, obviously.
4089.24s: OK.
4089.92s: Let's see.
4093.60s: Let's dig in, shall we?
4096.12s: Can you guys see this?
4096.92s: OK.
4097.20s: Or do I need to zoom in?
4098.88s: Zooming in is kind of annoying.
4101.44s: But we can do it.
4107.88s: Oops.
4110.88s: We were the fine former.
4112.04s: Yeah.
4112.24s: So we know this former SEC, Jake Clinton,
4114.56s: took a job at Apollo GM newly created role lead of independent
4120.60s: director on its board.
4121.80s: That's super common, by the way.
4123.92s: The military people do that a lot as well, where high ranking
4127.40s: military officials will exit the military.
4130.24s: And then they will migrate into like higher level government
4136.04s: contracting or just those kinds of jobs.
4140.56s: So it's it shouldn't be that surprising.
4144.36s: People typically look at it as some sort of like really nefarious
4148.56s: thing.
4149.68s: But if you think of it from like a logical lens,
4152.40s: a lot of those places actually benefit pretty heavily
4156.52s: from having those kinds of people with that kind of experience
4162.32s: coming into their businesses to help.
4165.96s: Again, I'm not weighing on it.
4167.92s: Is it good?
4169.00s: Should it happen?
4170.32s: I'm not talking about it from that lens at all.
4172.40s: I'm just saying it makes, it doesn't surprise me at all
4175.68s: to see people that have developed
4178.04s: eminence in a field being sought after in a lot of these firms
4182.84s: where things are highly competitive, right?
4184.84s: Like that none of that there is shocking to me in any way.
4189.44s: Like it makes total sense.
4191.16s: OK, continuing on found out Apollo and Tiger same building.
4197.28s: OK.
4201.60s: Now we encounter first conflict of interest.
4203.84s: Well, I mean, there's a million of them realistically turns out
4207.48s: stepped down last month because of highs with Epstein.
4213.60s: I'm just trying to get the way.
4217.28s: So you're telling me that the former SEC chairman is working for a company
4219.96s: that was connected with one of the most infamous criminals of all time.
4224.88s: So Epstein again, what Epstein did is, well, what we think he did is
4234.44s: absolutely reprehensible, fucking insane.
4238.44s: But the guy was also pretty deep into the financial world overall.
4244.16s: So the idea that saying that SEC chairman is working for a company
4247.96s: that was connected with one of the most infamous criminals,
4250.64s: I mean, Stephen Hawking had been to the fucking island.
4254.88s: So do I think that Stephen Hawking was on the island playing with people?
4260.88s: I don't think so.
4262.08s: I mean, the motherfucker couldn't even talk.
4264.20s: So I don't anticipate some sort of massive ability to do that.
4271.48s: So all I'm saying is that, again, even with stuff like this,
4276.72s: I think it's really important to try and be objective.
4280.40s: Do I think that it's a good look?
4281.92s: Do I think that's a healthy connection?
4283.64s: No, of course not.
4285.60s: But I don't immediately say the former SEC chairman,
4289.68s: when they're working for a company that had connections with somebody
4293.60s: that was really big in the industry that happened to do bad things.
4297.08s: I don't think that that inherently makes the tie, right?
4301.20s: So it's something to be aware of.
4303.08s: I absolutely think it's insane and reprehensible.
4307.24s: But I do think it's something that should still be tempered until we see more.
4314.72s: So let's see what else we find.
4316.72s: Liam Black attended a Apollo global meeting days after resignation.
4321.92s: Take a step back.
4325.04s: Former chairman turns out, Jake Clayton, know each other pretty well,
4329.88s: directly from CFTC.
4331.16s: So now you have two former chairman Wall Street.
4333.32s: Did it?
4333.84s: OK, so this is just talking about where people work.
4336.68s: Nothing from these two continually work together even now.
4339.48s: So yeah, I mean, this doesn't surprise me much.
4345.48s: Credit sui's leaky boat.
4348.20s: They can't just keep themselves out of the news.
4351.36s: OK, as a result bankruptcy 5000.
4355.24s: 50,000 people lost their jobs when it became evident during the courthouse hearing.
4359.44s: Was nobody extended a handout to loan.
4364.32s: Reensill.
4367.04s: As a result of different parts,
4369.24s: Reensill had to be liquidated means to recoup the loss.
4371.92s: One of the impacted was Green Souls tech partner, Tolia,
4376.00s: I guess, who had plans to acquire them Apollo.
4380.24s: OK, that's an interesting tie.
4384.88s: Yeah.
4390.16s: And it looks like JP Morgan jumped in.
4394.68s: I mean, I'm not sure what the primary attachment here.
4398.68s: OK, researching around it seems that for one reason or another,
4401.48s: consolidation of banks appear to be focused,
4404.16s: added into the near future.
4406.16s: I mean, yeah, it's always like that.
4409.60s: Like this is not.
4412.40s: I actually don't really.
4415.92s: Yes, like big banks are always trying to expand it and consume smaller banks.
4421.32s: So I don't think that that's like some sort of revelation here.
4424.44s: That's just literally their business model.
4428.16s: BlackRock looking to expand.
4429.92s: We know that.
4431.96s: This becomes especially interesting considering how BlackRock is positioning
4435.24s: Souls is the fourth branch of government.
4438.40s: Yeah, I mean, I don't really know disagreement with any of that.
4441.16s: I think that all stuff makes sense.
4445.88s: Gary Gensler, GGLF, LHF, this is.
4453.52s: Fellow Apes, warmly, Gensler, SEC,
4456.48s: Trust, Wheel of the Power, SEC Chairman,
4458.44s: while closing loop holes, Gary Gensler,
4461.32s: hence events are, we already know all this stuff so we can kind of skip.
4464.92s: Fun fact, not a lot was done.
4471.80s: So we moved from Libert to Sofer.
4473.60s: We already know this.
4475.12s: This is, I think, a bigger.
4480.12s: A bigger transition probably loosely attaches to this,
4485.16s: but I don't think a massive.
4493.20s: I believe that many of the bad hedge funds took on massive risk with expectations
4497.36s: that the Trump administration would get reelected and prolong the need for transitioning to
4502.76s: Sofer and others involving former SEC and CFC Chairman.
4507.56s: This would give them ample amount of time to make profits on the companies and banks.
4510.40s: They bankrupt.
4516.16s: I mean, I, like this isn't, this isn't how those kinds of institutions work.
4528.96s: Massive risks with expectations that an administration would win a presidential election.
4534.64s: Like there's just not, that's not how places like this operate.
4540.00s: You don't become as powerful and as large as places like this do.
4546.48s: If this is how you do business.
4549.40s: So I find that to be an interesting takeaway.
4557.92s: Table growth.
4558.92s: Yep.
4559.92s: That funds have been taking advantage of the low interest rates that are being gained.
4566.28s: So that's why they're going to take this whole new stream through rehab application
4569.08s: in the repo market.
4570.76s: Money is never going to be able to pay back.
4576.72s: Only a matter of time before Sofer drops the bomb on them.
4584.52s: I mean, this didn't really, this didn't really pan out.
4589.16s: So it's, I think the idea behind it is fair.
4592.12s: I think a lot of, one of the things I noticed with the GameStop folks is a lot of people
4596.16s: take the GameStop thing and they try to zoom it out to like global economic collapse.
4606.20s: And I honestly think that's a really alluring, but likely incorrect logical path to go down.
4616.28s: Because when you zoom out that far, there's so many new variables that get injected into
4622.84s: the system that becomes so difficult to manage that the probabilities of any of these general
4630.12s: ideas being correct just literally from a path perspective is so low because of how extreme
4636.92s: we get with what we're trying to postulate here.
4640.72s: So yeah, it's like they're fine, but I just think that that's something to pay attention
4646.04s: to as you conduct analysis on stuff like this, like the simpler the analysis is that you
4650.88s: can do that's more directly tied to the thing that you're trying to analyze the more successful
4657.12s: from a probabilistic lens that your analysis is going to be.
4660.40s: So like trying to tie the move from library like library was a terrible system.
4667.60s: And it that was going to move anyways because of a slew of other reasons.
4673.44s: So trying to tie that move to something like this, which I understand their, their concept
4678.64s: around the financing rates, but again, like when you're analyzing anything and a lot of people
4686.48s: analyze institutions from this lens as if they're the enemies, which is fine.
4690.48s: You label them as whatever you want.
4692.48s: I don't, but I think it's up to each person to choose how you choose to label things.
4697.36s: But especially if you're analyzing an enemy, again, one of the worst possible things you can do
4702.48s: is underestimate them. And a lot of the assumptions we make in these DDS literally make these
4710.48s: giant institutions. We just analyze it from the lens that they're fools, which is crazy.
4717.28s: They're, they're supremely smart.
4720.96s: So the idea, again, going back to why that matters is when you're trying to conduct your analysis,
4725.84s: it's really important to not let your dislike of something,
4730.08s: taint your opinion to actually be able to objectively analyze their capabilities and
4735.52s: their limitations. Because going back to the transition from sulfur to liboard,
4740.64s: their ability to estimate their costs is supreme. They know exactly what their costs are.
4747.84s: Now, like they're going to have inventory out. And then as this move from sulfur,
4753.12s: or a liboard or sulfur comes up, they're just going to be like, well, let's, let's see what it is.
4757.12s: And then we'll figure it out from there. No, man, they're going to model it. And they're going to
4761.36s: have an exact idea of what it will be. Will it be absolutely perfect? No, none of this stuff is
4766.08s: absolutely perfect. But they'll have a pretty fucking good idea. So that's just something I notice
4771.04s: a lot in these. And I think it's a mistake. I think that even if you don't like something or
4776.88s: an entity or someone, you should still treat them with some level of respect so that you can have
4783.84s: a better chance of objective analysis. So that's the main thing I picked up going through the general
4792.48s: chaos theory series, but specifically the final connection component. I think that it's just a
4799.28s: general mistake to do that. So interesting stuff, though. I'm actually really excited to get into
4806.08s: this next group of things. But let me get caught up on the chat. And then I got a bounce.
4818.00s: Trading your option says this might not be the time. But when it comes to selling credit spreads,
4822.00s: wouldn't it wouldn't picking a short time period be more beneficial due to theta decay?
4829.04s: Sort of. Yeah, sort of. The thing to remember with vertical spreads is really you're kind of
4836.80s: neutralizing most of the Greeks that you're picking up with them. Because if you're trading
4844.00s: right like a shorts higher delta and then a long lower delta, like you still have these
4853.12s: counteracting deltas that ultimately really reduce your delta profile quite a lot for the average
4858.32s: trader. So let's take a look at what I mean by this. We'll use GME because we're here.
4863.84s: And let's take a look at going out 34 days. And let's take a look at the 25. We'll sell the 25
4872.72s: and we'll buy the 24's. Well, let's take a look at what happens to your delta. Oh, actually,
4879.04s: there's a better way to do this. If you sell the 25's and then buy the 24's.
4890.08s: Yeah, cool. So here's essentially what happens. If you take a look at what, let's say, for example,
4899.60s: your theta is at spot price when you start the exercise here.
4909.04s: Your theta in the beginning is $2.71. When you add your second leg, your theta literally
4918.00s: becomes 32 cents. So while the theta still matters, when you're trading narrow spreads,
4926.72s: it's really more of a directional bet than anything. Because yes, they do experience theta decay,
4934.40s: but it's going to be quite muted on a relative basis because again, you have the other leg that's
4939.60s: effectively cancelling out the other leg. That's the whole point of them. Is it really mute all
4945.68s: of the Greeks across the entire profile? So the short answer is whenever you're selling premium,
4953.28s: yes, from an absolute general perspective, when you're within 60 days for an at-the-money option,
4960.32s: your theta decay is going to accelerate exponentially until you get to zero. But when you're trading
4966.16s: something like spreads, you're already muting it from the jump. So you're already going to have
4973.28s: much slower Greek movement from the get go. So it doesn't mean anything terrible, but it just means
4984.08s: that you can kind of sell almost where you want at that point. Like if you go outside of 60 days,
4989.60s: then it's going to be even slower. So I wouldn't necessarily do that. But I think vertical spreads,
4996.64s: that's just one of the big downsides to them realistically is how effectively this happens.
5005.68s: MFN says do you an expect an aggressive upthrust of GME asset in the nearly soon? Good question.
5015.12s: I don't see anything. Honestly, I don't really see any big catalyst right now.
5019.76s: I'm actually going to do a video probably right after this to deep dive GameStop for everybody
5024.72s: just to get caught back up on where things sit. So I will report back soon and let you know if there's
5032.96s: anything in there that I'm seeing that sticks out to me. But I mean so far, the aggressive
5038.48s: upboard thrusting seems I don't want to say I'm likely because I don't know. I haven't really
5044.56s: looked at it, but there's nothing jumping out at me that leads me to believe that there is going to be
5049.44s: highly aggressive upboard thrusting of the GME asset. But we will report back our fine.
5059.28s: All right, gang. Great hanging out. I'm stoked to be back on the Saturday cadence. It's really
5064.72s: fun just to poke through this stuff. I think GameStop is just such an interesting stock to look through
5070.08s: the lens of trading and the markets from. So it's always fun hanging out with you all.
5075.04s: As always, if you need anything, you can just hit me up in the discord, be an outlier, be an ape.
5079.36s: I'll see you guys later.
