 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you What I want to get a sense of region matter, wow, this is like a fucking, like a really big response. I don't need all that. I literally just want to know the answer to my question. So it's giving me sales channel breakdown. Here we go. Big box retailers Walmart target best buy 40 to 50%. Walmart alone is the single biggest seller. Online Amazon direct websites represents 30 to 40%. Specialty retailers, GameStop, eb games, eb games. I haven't heard the term eb games in a long freaking time. That's if I recall correctly, that's what actually used to be in the mall by my house. And then it moved to a game stop or it might have been both of them. I have to ask my buddy, he would know. I just don't remember, but I do remember like eb games being a thing. I think it was eb games was in the mall. And then I think GameStop was like its own little shop that was part of like a strip mall. You guys don't care. Clubs, regional stores about 5%. So it's Costco, Sam's Club, regional, electronic trains, local shops. So really it doesn't look like specialty retailers as much of the total sales. 10 to 15%. So then the follow on question is for specialty retailers. Like GameStop, what is the typical margin on the sale of a console? Because my guess is it's not going to be a lot. 5 to 8% gross margin. 3 to 5% if they're discounting or bundling. Yeah, hardware is treated almost like a loss leader. They want you in the store to buy games, controllers, headset, warranties and GameStop memberships. All of which are much higher margins. 20 to 50%. Honestly, did not know that. It kind of actually reminds me of the new car sales thing, right? Where a lot of dealers actually sell new cars. It people always complain about dealer prices. Actually, a lot of times they're kind of not huge margins on the sale of a car. A lot of times it is everything to do with trying to get you into their sphere for then warranties, maintenance and stuff like that. So it literally reminds me of that. That's exactly where I was expecting because it's an interesting idea, Rudy Begitt, to be honest. Like, I love looking at stuff like this, right? We can take a logical idea of thinking the sale of a new console is, could be, wind at the back. And then we can click into it a few times and we can take a look. And again, the reason I do these with you is I'm trying to show you how to think through this stuff logically yourselves as well to like analyze the things that you're hearing. Because if you like doing this research grade, if not, I love doing it with you guys. So I'm always happy to run the research side with you all. I find it really important, especially with something like GameStop, especially with something that has so much information floating around that a lot of times it can be stuff that's just been said in different capacities versus, you know, what the reality of things might be. Rudy Begitt says, I forgot how greeting Nintendo is. I actually don't think that's a Nintendo driven thing. I think that that's actually more so driven by the broader sales approach, which is trying to get people in the door, meaning to the store. And then from there, you can kind of try to sell other stuff to them. Again, it's really not novel for the sake of like GameStop or other, a lot of other brands will do stuff like that. And you'll actually knowingly take on parts of business at a knowing loss in order to secure other potential business that then net net overwhelms that loss. So honestly, the fact that they're not doing it at cost is actually kind of cool because the reality is if you're looking at something that's only 10 to 15% of the total sales for like a new console. So let's take the research one step further. We'll grab a notebook for us to track some of this stuff and we'll just get a ballpark idea because why not? So I'll throw this over here. Move you guys on the main screen in a second, but I have to ask you, PTA, a couple other questions. So next question, I want to know, oh, that's actually great. Yeah. So break down how this impacts GameStop financials during console years. So I'd like both of those like that. In addition, for the last Nintendo, use the last Nintendo switch release for the comparison. And I think using the last Nintendo switch would be a really good like like comparison. And we can actually see what it is. Now in the meantime, let me grab a quick grab here. I want to talk to you all about the GameStop coverage triangle and where things sit because there actually have been some pretty cool changes to it that I want to walk you through. I don't know where we left off last. I think we discussed it a little bit. I honestly don't fully remember, but doesn't really matter because we're going to take a look together now. So let's do that. Let's grab this also in case you're wondering what this cool photo is behind my head. I took this from the drone. This is from Iceland. I have like three screens and on each of the screens is like a different photo from somewhere we've been pretty cool. Okay, let's get on with it. GameStop there you are. Okay. So this is where we are. We literally have. Oh no, okay. So there was a new update because this one wasn't out there before. So here's what's gone down in GameStop for those that don't remember. I originally had rotated out of the equity itself on 7 April at a basis of 2575 and I sold it for 23. So I lost $1,000 realized on that. The reason is Joe says, can you sell that pick as wallpaper? I don't know. I've never tried, but if any of you guys want any of the photos that I've shown you, literally just tell me I'm happy to share them. And then Joe, if you feel like trying to sell it, go for it. I don't care. I know that you are trying to get your hustle on. So if that would help you, let me know. So I recently moved out of shares and the big reason again, let's take a look at what was happening here. If we take a look at one of the trades, when I started phasing into the position, the phasing started, we actually have to go back further, funny enough for this. Oh, damn, it loses all scale every time I forget. We need to go to November. The eighth, right here. So on this breakout is where I started this coverage triangle sample trade that I'm working with you all. And again, it's a sample trade. It's like a sample section of the portfolio, but this is a real trade that I'm actually trading right now. We started here. And then we were buying in January, November. We bought all the way into March. So kind of a series of different purchase campaigns was on the 27th. So following earnings on the strap, we bought some. And then on the 7th of April. So here we ended up exiting. So the reason for the exit is actually not because I was expecting GameStop to go down. That's actually not it at all. It's because if you look at the campaign and the different prices that I was transacting at, 24, 32, 24, 32, 27, 21, the average price at that point for the latest series, which was at 400 shares was 25, 75. So not a bad basis by any stretch. However, it's also not really where it needed to be based on how this thing was moving. So I'll explain that to you in a second, but Thor needs to go out. Might as well leverage the standing desk and stand up a little bit. Okay. So when looking at this broader position and when I started getting in versus how things were overall moving, absolutely no context on how this thing was going to behave after the release. And again, going back to the original thing I tried to continue to explain you guys, because I know that there's a lot of people that are really into just holding and that is totally cool. I am a trader. I move in. I move out. I have to. It is literally my lifeblood. So even though I could just buy $25,000 of GameStop and then just hold it, absolutely could do that. It's not really any sort of usable or useful demonstration of my approach to stuff like this. And that's really the broader goal behind talking about these traits is just to give you ideas on other approaches, how things might work. And it's all just knowledge tools for the toolbox for you to be aware of whether it's something that you like. Don't like totally cool. I get it. You got to do it's right for you. All right. So what I'm explaining to you is from the original entries again, back on eight November, which is way back here. It's pretty far back in time. And as things are trending around, you can take a look at the total range from when I got into this. And if we draw a line from peak, we made 40%. And that was actually one of the reasons why you started seeing me off loading some shares in January. That was the exact purpose is because it was a really solid move and it was me trimming some profits. So in case you guys don't know, we do have a love story that was built by GameStop on this live stream. You've heard it here first and it is between our very own day swag and Lauren. Just in case you guys know love does exist even online and I mean, what better facilitator than GameStop. But that part aside, shout out to those two. Sure the peak that we hit in January, we really have not been back near it. So you can see we fell down. We had this pretty aggressive sell off really on not a lot of news that was fairly informative to me. And we kind of continue trending down, down, down. And I remember discreetly that I was actually looking at taking an exit here, but I had a couple of things going on. So I actually just said I'll just hold the shares and deal with it later, which is exactly what had happened. I'll tell you the later. So as it's going down, it's not a big loss or anything. It really doesn't matter. But from a trader's lens, it's not doing anything for me. It's not making me money. It's just capital that's committed to something that's not really doing what I need it to do. So because of that, that's why you saw me take that rotational exit on the 7th of April. All I did was take my shares down at a small loss, like a thousand bucks. And then I moved them into short puts. The short put position that I put on was sized specifically to cover the cost of this loss. So you can see the original trade that went on was this. It was the 10 20, I'm sorry, it was a four lot of the 23s. And the reason why the math is like this is because I had another trade on at the same time. So you'll see what I'm talking about. So if we take a look at that four lot that went out on 7th April, right? You can directly attach these two things that I did. So these two things happen on the same day. I take these down, I move into these and the overall credit on these generally overcomes the P&L loss on these. That's the idea. Now again, the reason why it's not it's off by like 30 bucks or whatever is because I had another position on existing already. So just for context, it was this one. So this was also out at the same time. So between these two different positions, you'll notice that the realized P&L on those short puts was not actually anywhere near enough to overwhelm this loss. You'll see that I took them down for a dollar eight loss. Why would I have done that? Any guesses? It was a four lot. And I closed it for a dollar eight. There's a very specific reason why I made that move. And if you take a look at what's on right now, you can see what I recently added this one. So then you can take a hypothetical guess that it was something to do with this trade. Joe says to vacation, nope, that one wasn't for vacation. I think I might have adjusted that one while I was traveling. If I think that adjustment is literally while I was traveling, Reese says by equity that's not correct either good guess what ended up happening here is you'll still see I have no shares. It's all in short puts. Here's what happened. As I'm doing the math and I'll try to draw it out. I don't I never know if the drawing is like useful or not useful. But I hope it at least helps a little bit. That's the at least that's the intention behind it. All right. Or not all right. Yo, open up. Here we go. Okay. Let's give us a little bit of. This is fine. Okay. So here's the original position down here. We have 400 don't all this don't even worry about it for the context of this conversation. So there's 400 shares at 25 75. And over this time frame game stops rolling over. So what we do is we close these for 2308. This realizes this loss of 1070. So now I find an opportunity to take my original trade. The first thing I want you to pay attention to is the change in basis. What we do is we take this point specifically. We look at what the basis originally was 25 75. And I was able to sell a four lot for 255 at the 23. So what did I do here? I literally just reduced my basis by 275 by making this transition. So what that means is if I got assigned on this position rather than being stuck with the basis of 25 75. And now of the basis of 23. And if I took assignment at that, I effectively would have been at a scratch compared to this original position. Because again, this original position would have lost 1070. This other position would have made me 1020. So I'm down 50 bucks. That's if I did nothing else. So what I did is I use that move as an opportunity to make this change. And if you'll recall when I made that move on 7th April, it still wasn't above my cost basis. That's why I sold it for a loss. So I was able to take a cost basis that otherwise was too high. And I was able to put it in short puts that were slightly out of the money. So really aggressive adjustment that was timed honestly very well. And the reason all of this exists is really from a timing perspective trying to align with what price behavior is. There is no master plan at the beginning of this trade to say like at this point, I'm going to do blank. And it's because I have absolutely no idea what it's going to be doing at some point in the future. It's all context dependent. Rare view says Uncle Sammy going to love you for those short turn gain sales. That is a really common misconception. The part that I will leave you with is there are a lot of ways you can structure yourself who be in a much better tax position than just being a standard retail trader using a standard brokerage account. Some thoughts food for food for thought, something to chew on. But the other thing I'll always remind people with even when I wasn't structured as I am now. The short term capital gains doesn't, it's you pay capital gains on what you make. And you can try to make more later with other amounts of money. It does open a really important point though, which is if you do not make enough once you include all of the friction of your conduct of business, which also includes commissions, which is part of all of this to rare views point. It's not even just taxes that I'm dealing with. I'm dealing with slippage. I'm dealing with commissions. So you have to track all of these activities and make sure that what you're doing is still more profitable than what you would be doing otherwise, which is super, super important. You can also trade things in like tax advantaged accounts. So if I was doing this in a Roth IRA, there's no taxes, right? So there's a lot of different things you can do. The only reason I'm taking the time to talk about this is a lot of people just get in the mindset of, oh, I'm not going to trade because a short term capital gains tax, I heard that that's really bad. And it can be if you suck at trading and you're getting taxed bad on top of it, that's a terrible scenario. But if you're okay at this, it can just be a cost of doing business. You don't want to pay it, but it is what it is. Ruta Begis says, doesn't this positioning leave you unexposed to some random crazy moves? Yes and no. What anybody that follows the saga so far with how I trade GameStop, what do you think I would say to that response is to why I'm not concerned at all about being unexposed to some random crazy moves? Any guesses? Sky Shadek says, heard someone say, if you're worried about taxes, that's a good problem to have. We call it a high class problem. Trying to minimize your tax footprint is a high class problem. You only pay taxes on what you make. So that's the exact, that's the exact point that sky is making. Recess can always buy equity. Bingo. Darkmark says you'll see the volume. Bingo. Recess if volume shows up. Bingo. That's exactly correct. There has literally never been a random crazy move in GameStop that was not preceded by volume. So it doesn't matter to me. Right now volume is, it's not terrible. Oh shit. I mean, I do this giant slash. Volume is not terrible, but it's definitely not good. Meaning thinking it's something like that. Because if you take a look at when I scaled out, there was this massive volume around earnings. Why do you think that there wasn't an exit on the 26th March? Because volume showed up the day before. It showed up on the day following earnings. I have no idea what's going on, but I'm going to hold the equity for sure. Then volume peaks here to the downside, unfortunately, but volume was still there. Still held shares. What do you notice about the day that I entered the trade? Volume had been contracting. The five day average volume was already firmly below the 20 day average volume. Five day average volume was downward sloping. So the volume was siphoning out at this point. So felt very, very little risk of missing the boat in that way. All that being said, I still could have. There always could be that anomalous condition. That something just happens to fly on a specific day and I didn't have the shares on in that context. Again, the way that you have to trade as a trader is from a broader probabilistic analysis. For the number of conditions where I would have to keep my money invested in something that's not otherwise doing what I want. If in the event there's a parabolic move, it means I'm going to be tying capital up for extremely long durations. And the net profit on that, even if you get a 600% return, still can lag this more active style if again, you're doing it well. So I accept that opportunity risk because it is a business risk. There's no doubt about it. It's just that based on the historic precedent that we've seen in GameStop and really any other kind of meme stock name that you've heard is volume always has proceeded. There has not been an instance. Number of volume has not proceeded. The real big moves. Now I've talked about this before. It does mean I'm not going to bottom ticket. It means that I'm not going to get in at the absolute lowest price if I'm waiting for some confirmation of volume before I start scaling in. It's again, this is a decision because what I'm doing is I'm scaling in as it's a higher probability of the move happening. So then instead of me sitting there holding the bat and holding the bat is kind of the same as having your money in a trade, your capital committed. Kind of just sitting there holding the bat and you're just swinging at everything. And then you end up getting tired or whatever. The comparative or the comparison here would be that I'm waiting until there is a weak picture that I do well against. And then I'm going to go out and swing like that kind of thing. So it's just a very tactical. It's an active approach. That's exactly what I'm doing. So back to a couple of the key things of the adjustment here. So this movement here essentially locking in almost a $50 loss, which would have been the total net, it reduced my total basis by 275. It's a big change on something like this. It's essentially a 10% plus change. So this gave me a 10% basis change. Basis decrease, which is great. Now the reason why you see this here, the trade coming down for a dollar eight and you'll notice that the realized PNL is a long cry away from this 1020 that otherwise I was banking on in order to recoup the loss that was booked down lower. So here's what's going on with that. If we scroll up, I guess I'll hide this so it's not so confusing. If we scroll up, you'll notice on the 26th of March, there is this existing position, the four that's essentially $472 of premium. This one expires on 16 May. So that one is existing. And this is essentially the change that you see happen here. What I did was take this trade down. I took another existing trade that I had down these two combined make 1083. These two combined already overwhelmed this loss. So that loss is booked and covered. And again, this isn't even including the net PNL that I needed to recover because there was a profitable close before that. So all of this is said between these two trades, these already covered this loss. So now I literally have a completely blank slate. So I have 25s, the 25 strike that's out in 30 May. And I have the 26 strike that's out in 16 May. I'm using 60% of the allocation. And it's a completely blank slate at this point. All of the prior trades have been successfully managed into really what I need them to be. And if you take a look at the overall profile for the trade, again, take a look at the difference in overall performance. If you look at the percent change, this is essentially from when I started this exercise, if I had just bought shares and did nothing else, bought shares on the day I started this exercise, it would have been 2431 I bought. They would be at 2746 now. It's a 13% gain. That's what it would have been if I did nothing. So far, I have a 22% realized and unrealized game. It's important to call that out because part of this game is dependent on this one. It's money here. So I make that caveat because I'm not trying to over sell the performance. There's a difference between what's realized and unrealized. So for example, if I move this down to give you the realized PNL just for like what's been booked as a win, booked PNL is 10.3%. But again, if you compare that against this 13, this is realized. This 13% appear is unrealized. It means it's attached to open shares in order to realize that 13% you would have had to close it. That's why I don't compare it that way. It's why I compare it like this because this is also unrealized plus realized. This one wouldn't have any realized segment to it. So it's to create an apples to apples comparison. So this is where we sit right now with GameStop. I really do think about 60% is overall close to what I would want to be. I think I might scale in a little bit more. But again, with volume as light as it is, I'm not over eager. I'm actually kind of waiting to see what kind of activity we can get out of it before I start scaling in more capital. And the main reason is again, this is the cool part about trading actively. I am in order to get this 12.96% return from here to here, you need to use all of your money. That means all of the $25,000 that we started this exercise with, that's what yields the 13% return. The difference is this 22% return has been made without us ever even going over 90% utilized. I've never been more than 90% utilized in this exercise. I think the highest I was is like mid 80s or something like that. So it's outperforming the buy and hold equivalent using less money, equaling less total risk. So that's where we sit with that trade. If there's any questions on it, let me know. As always, happy to explain it. I do my best to try to show you the logic behind what I'm doing and why. Let's see. Juicebox says, if I expect it to hit 34 by June, what's the most profitable call option spread I can make? Well, a couple of things. I can tell, I can tell by that question that you're really unfamiliar with options and that's not a dig at you. I can just tell by the vernacular you use. And what I would tell you for that is, before you trade options, you want to have a pretty good understanding of them. Otherwise, you're kind of stepping in front of something that is more likely to hurt you than to help you. That being said, I'll still answer your question. I'm just offering that piece of information for you to do what you will. But we literally can model it together. The way to think about this is that you want to strike a balance and especially if we're saying by June, right? So that tells us that we don't want to go super far out beyond June. Juicebox says, I'm good with options. If you say so, I, again, I can tell you literally by the language that you're using that you're not. But if you think you are, then you are. Now, if we take a look at what the most, one of the more, again, most would be relative, depending on how the actual return path looks. But if we take a look at the June expiration and we think that it's going to go to 34. Now a really common way to try to trade this is, oh, I'll buy the 34 calls, which again, depending on the way that you think it's going to go is really important because the path of returns that it's going to take is really important to determine what is going to make more money. And I'll explain what that means. Juicebox says, I'm driving. That's not, again, I'm not trying to get it to you. I can, it's literally the words that you're using. Obstetrator wouldn't say most profitable call option spread, like that, that series of words. And then also you saying, I can make. That's also, we would never say those words. It's like if you hear somebody talking about something that you are very familiar with, right? So Juicebox then says single leg, but you said call option spread. So this is the point. Again, it's just to make sure that you are aware that if you say that you're good with options, but you're talking about them like that, like you're not, you're not. And that's okay. You cannot be super savvy with options. But what's dangerous is if you tell yourself that you're good with them, but then you're not. That's where it gets really dangerous. Anyways, all that aside intervention aside, if you're good with options, you're good with options. Now, right? Now if the next big question to ask though, to like to give you a natural answer, juicebox, is what is the return path that you expect over this time frame? And here's what I mean by this. If we take a look at the next 55 days, is it your hypothesis that GameStop would move a lot in the near term? Do you think it's going to move a lot as you get closer to June? The reason why I'm asking this is because the blanket answer here is units would be the most profitable, buying a ton of really cheap far out of the money options. That would be the most profitable. But depending on what expiration you pick, it's going to look a lot different depending on how long it takes to get there. It matters a lot and it is everything to do with the way that options decay. So let's take a look at an example here. If I were expecting personally, hypothetical scenario because I'm not, but if I were expecting 34 in GameStop, come June. I think it's going to be sometime between now and June, but I really don't know when in that time frame, the move is going to happen. So June is kind of the end state that I'm looking at, but I really don't have a sense leading into June where the move is most likely to kick off. Well, it tells me that buying units is unlikely to going to be really useful to me because you'll see why here. So let's say I think again, that same thing sometime by June and let's say that the other scenario here is, and again, I would have to know this from juice boxes lens to kind of tailor the response to him. But is it leading into June? Do we think that we're going to kind of hang around this level, meaning the 28 to the 24? Do we think it'll be tighter? Do we think it'll be closer to like the 27 handle? Do we think it might drift up into the higher 20s? And really we're starting to see a floor here at 26. All of these things matter for shaping what we would consider to be optimal. Now the reality of trading is what I'm asking him to do is essentially impossible, right? Nobody knows all this stuff. It's a series of guesses and that's okay. It really depends on the conviction. But the short answer is if I think this thing is going to go to 34 and let's just say it's sometimes soon, what I would do is I would go out far out of the money. I would pick like maybe these five delta something like that, the 90s. And let's say that I have a $5,000 bankroll. So we go into analyzer. Let's say that that's the risk that I want to put on in the trade, not the bankroll, but that's the total risk I want to put on. So we already know that we can put on a really big position. So let's do like two, let me see, 32 cents, three two times. Yeah, it's a little less than 200. It's like 150. You can get like 150 of these. Give or take if you wanted to spend 5 grand. So the reason why this is the more profitable thing you could do is if we add the theoretical price here at 34. And you'll see what you'd make at 34. You'd make $7,600. So you would double your money and then some. Now if you think the move is going to happen sooner, you would want to use sooner options. And it's because they're cheaper. You can buy even more of those units. Thus you can build an even bigger position. So again, for that example, we've used the 50s and we can get those for 12 cents. That puts us grabbing like 4.75. And then comparatively, if you take a look at what the P and L would be at that point, would be 26 135. Juice box says with 5K, you wouldn't get the 20 strikes. Again, I'm answering the original question. And what I'm trying to show is what the most profitable approach is. This is hands down the most unrealistic approach, by the way, most unrealistic. What I'm doing is I'm optimizing for something that we're pretending to know, but we don't meaning that it's going to go to a super high level in a short term time frame. What I'm trying to show you is that the concept of units is really important. And it's simple as this. Even though these have a tiny delta, a delta of .04. Again, let's use our Excel sheet because I think it'll make this a little more clear. Now, it's clear everything here. So let's take a look at some of these different positions. So we're saying that we have a $5,000 bankroll to use. And in one scenario, I'm showing you that we were able to get what is that 150 loss. Another scenario, I showed you that we're going to get 475 loss. And if we take a look just from a raw delta lens, I don't care about anything else in this context other than delta. You can see that the 150 here has a delta of 822. The 475 in the 16 maize, those have a delta of 1890. Here's what's happening. When you're buying really cheap, really far out of the money options, you can buy so many of them to still get a really high aggregate delta. And what I mean is this, let's look by comparison. Let's say the 55s and let's say you think it's going to go to 34. So you do what most people would try to logically do and you would go to the 34 strike itself. So let's see how many at the 34 strike itself we could get. And those are trading for $1.89. So we have $5,000 divided by $289. It gives us 26 contracts. So we can get 26 contracts of these for the same relative cost. And you can see the delta that these give you is 876. Now this is me being slightly lazy because I'll do the actual math so that it's a true like like comparison, so $5,000 divided by 32. It gives us 156 contracts. The reason is this wouldn't actually have more delta in the aggregate. It would be like this. It would be like 854. Okay. So here's the comparison. You can essentially buy 26 options and get 876 delta. You can buy 475 options. This is the New York term expiration and get 1890 delta. You can get 150 options and get 854 delta. This is also further out in time. So this is the idea of units. Even though you're buying things that have infinitismally smaller delta than this one or things that are closer to being at the money, you can buy so many of them that you can eventually brute force your delta. Sky Shadex says the magic of convexity. That's actually the ultimate P&L factor. But actually the thing I'm showing you right now is nothing to do with convexity. Convexity comes in as you get the move. So what Sky Shadex is referring to is if we take a look at what the total max delta. So this is current delta's. This is max delta's meaning how many total delta's does this thing represent? And it's literally this times 100. I don't want that. I just want. So what Sky is referring to is what the delta's can become if you get a big move. So the max delta meaning if they wind up deep in the money and they become a delta of one, these are the max delta's they can achieve. So if you take a look at what the total delta's are as a percentage of the max, they're actually very small on a relative basis for the far out of the money ones. And it's because they need a big move in order to become what they can be to grow into the total position they can be. So what Sky is referring to is actually the context where these start to grow into these. And you can see these are way larger positions, totally than this. And that's why in a big enough move, these would absolutely smoke the return profile of the one where you buy the strike where you think it's going to go. Because this can only go a little bit higher on a relative basis, right? So you have 67% delta growth here. Here you have like 96% delta growth. So these can turn into huge trades. So what that actually looks like to show you in context, I have no idea how logical this is for you guys. I don't know what the general understanding of options is, but let's target a price of 50 and let's just click through these. What you're going to notice is this will get to its maximum delta faster and then it moves dollar for dollar with the underlying. So that means that this will get to its delta of 2600 quickly relative to these. And then that's as high as it's going to get. These will take longer to get to their maximum delta's. But if they get there, these end up moving as the underlying moves a dollar, these move huge amounts of dollars comparatively. So if you take a look at the 26. Lots that we bought and we look at what the P&L would be, it would be $40,000. If we take a look at the 156 lots on that same price, those become $53,000. And then if you take a look at the 475 lots, those become $290,000 at 50, meaning a giant move, by the way, 100% move. But what I'm showing you is again, answering the original question of what makes the most money, what makes the most money is where you can get the most delta's if you get the actual move you're looking for. Now all of that aside, the ability to time and to be able to buy these at a point that then it moves in the direction that you want quick enough is kind of like your ability to win the lottery. Like that it really kind of is like that. And here's why what's going to happen with this trade is time is going to pass. And as time passes, your position actually needs a bigger and bigger move in order to make you money. So let's eyeball what that looks like here. Let's take a look at I'm just going to mark down where we're at today. And let's use a plus 15% move. Let's say that we get a really, really big move in our favor. Actually, let's use a 10% move. So this will be a plus 10% move. It thinks I'm trying to do math, but I'm not. And let's now take a look at what happens as we fast forward time, what we make. So today is going to be this is using 26 April. I want to track the days so that you can clearly see what I'm talking about. And at that 10% move, you make 71, 1, 1, 8. If you get a 10% move, you're going to make 7 grand. Okay. Now let's fast forward time. Let's say that time passes, I think these are in 16 May. So let's go two weeks forward. Let's go to two May. What do you notice that just happened to your return? If we go two weeks forward now to two May and you take a look at what your PNL is, it's $443. Here. So what just happened to us? So this minus this divided by this, your max profit just cratered by 94% not max profit. That's incorrect. Your relative profit, I should say. And the reason why I should say that is because max profit still is unlimited if it goes up. But what I'm showing you is as two weeks pass, this same 10% move. If you got the 10% move today, just pretend the market was open, it's using, you know, just near term pricing, you would make 71, 18. But if that 10% move happens in just two weeks from now, you make $443. So the amount that you would have made has now decreased by 94%. This is the cost of holding these units. That's the Theta decay. The reason why there's so much Theta decay is when you look at the option, you will say something like, well, wait a minute, there's really not that much Theta in these. There's, there's so far out of the money. So let's go to here. Let's go to the 50s. Your Theta is two cents. It's two cents on something that's only 12. I think it was we would buy it for 12. So your daily Theta decay is two cents on something you bought for 12. On a percentage basis, your Theta decay is fucking huge. So what that means is as time passes and as these remain super far out of the money, you effectively need a tremendous move in order to make a good amount of money. So to summarize everything, you just learned. You learned the idea of what units are. If we're talking about the hypothetical scenario of what would the most profitable trade be, it would be where you could accumulate the maximum number of deltas within the time frame you're suspecting the move would happen. The cost to this is that if you are incorrect in terms of your timing, you are severely, severely punished, especially if it's a shorter term trade idea. So now this opens the better question in my opinion, which is how might we strike balance? If we think it might hit 34 sometime between now and June, what kind of trade structure might make sense in the context of we don't know if the move is going to happen in two weeks. And we can see other trades where if we fast forward two weeks, even though it might not make the same amount of money, if you got that 10% move today, it will make way more money. If you get the 10% move and two weeks happen to have passed. And the way that we do this is we buy options that actually have higher deltas. So this is what that can look like. Well, first, let me take a giant pause. Does what I just explained does that make sense? Are we understanding the idea of units and are we understanding the cost of holding those units, the cost of gaining that convexity via gamma, the cost associated with theta, and how important the timing is for your idea? Because if you're trying to do something via timing and you're buying units, you are on the clock. You've got to be good with your timing. Now there are cheaper ways, admittedly, in order to run this kind of concept, but it's still expensive. And it's almost like maintaining front spot volatility in some sort of volume decks. You buy units that are really cheap, really far out of the money in the front expiration, because they're already essentially decayed down. There's not much more that can decay out of them. So if you go to the 50s here, you get them for two cents. So what you can do is you can grab the 50s in this front expiration. You can size your trade down. You don't have to use the entire five grand, but you can use a relative amount of money that allows you to try this trade multiple times for the same total cost. It's still a low probability trade, which is another way you can do it versus doing something like buying them that are 16 days out. I definitely would not do that. Or I'm sorry, in 16 May, which is 20 days out. Definitely would not do that. If I thought the move, for example, might happen between now and 16 May, I would buy the front expiration far out of the monies. I would essentially just write it off as a loss, but then I would model it so that if the move does happen, you can see how much you can actually make, because let's make that point. If we have a $5,000 bankroll, and I think the move is going to happen sometimes over the next three expiration cycles. So actually, we can keep all these. Let's get rid of these. So we know that essentially, we're going to split this up between three expiration cycles, because that's when we think the move is going to happen. So we have 1667, we get to use on any one of these individual expiration cycles. So these are trading at two cents, those 1667 divided by two bucks, you get 833 contracts. I forgot where those were, to be honest, here, 833. So we have 833 contracts that we can get effectively this front week. The current delta on those, if we grabbed 833 of these. Again, by the way, this is a terrible, terrible idea, terrible idea. I'm literally just giving it to you for context. These actually, you have to get them for three pennies, my bad, because I had it on the sell side, and you're not going to be able to play a bit of spread on these there. When you're buying units, you're essentially going to have to cross the bit of spread. That's just the nature of the beast. So 1667 now divided by three, you get 555 contracts, 555. Okay. And now we get our position on. Here's what happens. If time passes during this front time frame, so again, let's say that we're expecting this 10% move this line, as we fast forward each day, as time passes, you'll see that the clock is ticking against you. Absolutely. But you can only lose that 1667. Whereas if we take a look in that other scenario where we're going out to 16 May, you might end up overpaying because you're gaining exposure to a couple of explorations out if the move is actually set to happen sooner. This is only in the context of you somehow have this massively high conviction that you think a big move is going to happen within a certain time frame. What I'm literally telling you is that this is the ideal way to light your money on fire. That is the overwhelming outcome from trying to trade it this way. But again, I'm just talking about the concepts and the structures behind this so that you at least have an idea to answer that question because that's, I mean, really the broad goal, right? And this video here is a video that talks about some of this concept, but more specifically, it talks about how to buy call options smarter in something like GameStop specifically. Because things like GameStop that are really high volatility have a very different return profile in terms of how they will behave. Things that are really high volatility have a higher cost for the leverage. So that video that I just posted in there is really the upfront more applicable answer to what juice box is probably actually trying to ask, which is not the actual like what is the most profitable, but what is the fair idea to capitalize on this move? That's what that video goes through. So any questions on any of that stuff? Again, this isn't really just for GameStop. This is just talking about how options behave, but we're talking about how options behave in this scenario in the context of GameStop, which I actually think is a really good conversation by the way, because GameStop brings a lot of really interesting nuance to the equation. Okay, looks like we're good. All right, so we have a little bit of time left. Do we want to go to the DD library or do we want to just poke through the latest news with GameStop and stuff like that? I'm going to make a video on just like actually deep diving the current markets on the GameStop because I haven't done that in a while. I'm planning to do that next week. So that's on the horizon just to inform your answer, but we haven't done the DD library in a while on having to do that or we can spend 10, 15 minutes just poking through the sock and seeing if there's anything that jumps out at us. I haven't done that in a while admittedly. I've been managing a bunch of my other positions because of how the market has been behaving more broadly. GC says DD library, you got it. Thor is not in here. He was going to grab his dinner. So I don't know if he's done with dinner, but he definitely would be done with dinner. He's probably just chilling out there. All right, let's grab the DD library. I actually don't even fucking remember where we left off. You guys will have to help me here. I'm going to need some help. Juice box says, dude, I gave you a price target and you told me about 90 strikes. Yeah, you gave me a price target in the context of a question. And as somebody said that you know about options, then I answered your question, like your actual question that you asked. This is one of the important things. Again, especially as somebody who knows options is, I obviously then would think that you know the question that you're asking, which is precisely what we just explored, which is the most profitable way. My talking about 90 strikes and you latching on to 90 strikes as if that means that we were talking about the entirely wrong thing that reaffirms what I was talking about before in the context of I actually don't think you have any idea what you're talking about with options. It is nothing to do with the strike. You're focusing too much on the strike price. The 90s could literally never go in the money and they can still make tons of money if you get the move in that time frame. This is another common really misconception of really common misconception with respect to trading options. Is people think that you need your strike price to go in the money to make money and it's literally objectively not the case. You don't need that at all. So for a juice box who seems disenfranchised that I took 20 minutes to answer the question you asked, check out that other video. Okay. Rudebega says, wait, there's an actual library of all the DD. That's cool. It's very cool. I don't think it's all the DD. This goes back to the beginning for sure. We started with like these really, really new ones. Oldest to knew it. So this is the order we've been going in. And then I think the latest it goes up to, let's just, just 2023, 17 April 2023, just for context. I have absolutely no idea where we left off. Remember we did one with Lauer. I know we did this one. I know we did this one. Did this one? I don't think we did this. No, we did the chaos theory ones. Let's just click through these really fast. If I remember them. Yeah. I remember that one for sure. Let's try this one. Yeah. We looked at this one already. Remember this one. Let's check this one. I see if you see. I don't remember this. Do you guys remember this one? Wait, I kind of do. Look. Let's just take a look real quick. I'm actually, I don't want to skip. That would be lame. The whole point of this is to go through in order. This one. Let's see where we left off on this one. Okay. So we're in the D.D. library. Let's see what we clicked. Oh, all right. Sure. All right. Do you mean back? Do you mean theory of everything? Do we saw this one? Like the roll in 10 behind. OK. So let's go back to where we went into this one. And then OK. So we should be close. Here we go. All right. So DTCC, we, I know we did that one already. C-E-B-E. I'm going to get an electronic book. Yeah. OK. So we did the theory of everything. That was the latest one. OK. Great. I know exactly where we're at now. Thanks for your patience. I just didn't want to skip anything. So we are at the beginning of the chaos theory. I think this one just has pieces from another one that we've seen. So yeah. Wait, we've definitely seen this one. Anyway, let's just click through this. Yeah, we definitely have seen this one. I know that for fact. Because this is talking about all the attachments and the connections. Yeah. OK. I remember this. Between the different entities. So this is the everything connection part 1. Let's take a look at 2. Conflexed of interest. Yeah. We already remember this too. OK. Let's just start from here. Oops. Wrong one. Let's just start from here. These aren't that long. All right. Let's see. Former CFTC. Now works for Citadel as he chairmen. Pointing to fraudulent activity and efforts to prolong necessity. So for being implemented. OK. So this is kind of old, obviously. OK. Let's see. Let's dig in, shall we? Can you guys see this? OK. Or do I need to zoom in? Zooming in is kind of annoying. But we can do it. Oops. We were the fine former. Yeah. So we know this former SEC, Jake Clinton, took a job at Apollo GM newly created role lead of independent director on its board. That's super common, by the way. The military people do that a lot as well, where high ranking military officials will exit the military. And then they will migrate into like higher level government contracting or just those kinds of jobs. So it's it shouldn't be that surprising. People typically look at it as some sort of like really nefarious thing. But if you think of it from like a logical lens, a lot of those places actually benefit pretty heavily from having those kinds of people with that kind of experience coming into their businesses to help. Again, I'm not weighing on it. Is it good? Should it happen? I'm not talking about it from that lens at all. I'm just saying it makes, it doesn't surprise me at all to see people that have developed eminence in a field being sought after in a lot of these firms where things are highly competitive, right? Like that none of that there is shocking to me in any way. Like it makes total sense. OK, continuing on found out Apollo and Tiger same building. OK. Now we encounter first conflict of interest. Well, I mean, there's a million of them realistically turns out stepped down last month because of highs with Epstein. I'm just trying to get the way. So you're telling me that the former SEC chairman is working for a company that was connected with one of the most infamous criminals of all time. So Epstein again, what Epstein did is, well, what we think he did is absolutely reprehensible, fucking insane. But the guy was also pretty deep into the financial world overall. So the idea that saying that SEC chairman is working for a company that was connected with one of the most infamous criminals, I mean, Stephen Hawking had been to the fucking island. So do I think that Stephen Hawking was on the island playing with people? I don't think so. I mean, the motherfucker couldn't even talk. So I don't anticipate some sort of massive ability to do that. So all I'm saying is that, again, even with stuff like this, I think it's really important to try and be objective. Do I think that it's a good look? Do I think that's a healthy connection? No, of course not. But I don't immediately say the former SEC chairman, when they're working for a company that had connections with somebody that was really big in the industry that happened to do bad things. I don't think that that inherently makes the tie, right? So it's something to be aware of. I absolutely think it's insane and reprehensible. But I do think it's something that should still be tempered until we see more. So let's see what else we find. Liam Black attended a Apollo global meeting days after resignation. Take a step back. Former chairman turns out, Jake Clayton, know each other pretty well, directly from CFTC. So now you have two former chairman Wall Street. Did it? OK, so this is just talking about where people work. Nothing from these two continually work together even now. So yeah, I mean, this doesn't surprise me much. Credit sui's leaky boat. They can't just keep themselves out of the news. OK, as a result bankruptcy 5000. 50,000 people lost their jobs when it became evident during the courthouse hearing. Was nobody extended a handout to loan. Reensill. As a result of different parts, Reensill had to be liquidated means to recoup the loss. One of the impacted was Green Souls tech partner, Tolia, I guess, who had plans to acquire them Apollo. OK, that's an interesting tie. Yeah. And it looks like JP Morgan jumped in. I mean, I'm not sure what the primary attachment here. OK, researching around it seems that for one reason or another, consolidation of banks appear to be focused, added into the near future. I mean, yeah, it's always like that. Like this is not. I actually don't really. Yes, like big banks are always trying to expand it and consume smaller banks. So I don't think that that's like some sort of revelation here. That's just literally their business model. BlackRock looking to expand. We know that. This becomes especially interesting considering how BlackRock is positioning Souls is the fourth branch of government. Yeah, I mean, I don't really know disagreement with any of that. I think that all stuff makes sense. Gary Gensler, GGLF, LHF, this is. Fellow Apes, warmly, Gensler, SEC, Trust, Wheel of the Power, SEC Chairman, while closing loop holes, Gary Gensler, hence events are, we already know all this stuff so we can kind of skip. Fun fact, not a lot was done. So we moved from Libert to Sofer. We already know this. This is, I think, a bigger. A bigger transition probably loosely attaches to this, but I don't think a massive. I believe that many of the bad hedge funds took on massive risk with expectations that the Trump administration would get reelected and prolong the need for transitioning to Sofer and others involving former SEC and CFC Chairman. This would give them ample amount of time to make profits on the companies and banks. They bankrupt. I mean, I, like this isn't, this isn't how those kinds of institutions work. Massive risks with expectations that an administration would win a presidential election. Like there's just not, that's not how places like this operate. You don't become as powerful and as large as places like this do. If this is how you do business. So I find that to be an interesting takeaway. Table growth. Yep. That funds have been taking advantage of the low interest rates that are being gained. So that's why they're going to take this whole new stream through rehab application in the repo market. Money is never going to be able to pay back. Only a matter of time before Sofer drops the bomb on them. I mean, this didn't really, this didn't really pan out. So it's, I think the idea behind it is fair. I think a lot of, one of the things I noticed with the GameStop folks is a lot of people take the GameStop thing and they try to zoom it out to like global economic collapse. And I honestly think that's a really alluring, but likely incorrect logical path to go down. Because when you zoom out that far, there's so many new variables that get injected into the system that becomes so difficult to manage that the probabilities of any of these general ideas being correct just literally from a path perspective is so low because of how extreme we get with what we're trying to postulate here. So yeah, it's like they're fine, but I just think that that's something to pay attention to as you conduct analysis on stuff like this, like the simpler the analysis is that you can do that's more directly tied to the thing that you're trying to analyze the more successful from a probabilistic lens that your analysis is going to be. So like trying to tie the move from library like library was a terrible system. And it that was going to move anyways because of a slew of other reasons. So trying to tie that move to something like this, which I understand their, their concept around the financing rates, but again, like when you're analyzing anything and a lot of people analyze institutions from this lens as if they're the enemies, which is fine. You label them as whatever you want. I don't, but I think it's up to each person to choose how you choose to label things. But especially if you're analyzing an enemy, again, one of the worst possible things you can do is underestimate them. And a lot of the assumptions we make in these DDS literally make these giant institutions. We just analyze it from the lens that they're fools, which is crazy. They're, they're supremely smart. So the idea, again, going back to why that matters is when you're trying to conduct your analysis, it's really important to not let your dislike of something, taint your opinion to actually be able to objectively analyze their capabilities and their limitations. Because going back to the transition from sulfur to liboard, their ability to estimate their costs is supreme. They know exactly what their costs are. Now, like they're going to have inventory out. And then as this move from sulfur, or a liboard or sulfur comes up, they're just going to be like, well, let's, let's see what it is. And then we'll figure it out from there. No, man, they're going to model it. And they're going to have an exact idea of what it will be. Will it be absolutely perfect? No, none of this stuff is absolutely perfect. But they'll have a pretty fucking good idea. So that's just something I notice a lot in these. And I think it's a mistake. I think that even if you don't like something or an entity or someone, you should still treat them with some level of respect so that you can have a better chance of objective analysis. So that's the main thing I picked up going through the general chaos theory series, but specifically the final connection component. I think that it's just a general mistake to do that. So interesting stuff, though. I'm actually really excited to get into this next group of things. But let me get caught up on the chat. And then I got a bounce. Trading your option says this might not be the time. But when it comes to selling credit spreads, wouldn't it wouldn't picking a short time period be more beneficial due to theta decay? Sort of. Yeah, sort of. The thing to remember with vertical spreads is really you're kind of neutralizing most of the Greeks that you're picking up with them. Because if you're trading right like a shorts higher delta and then a long lower delta, like you still have these counteracting deltas that ultimately really reduce your delta profile quite a lot for the average trader. So let's take a look at what I mean by this. We'll use GME because we're here. And let's take a look at going out 34 days. And let's take a look at the 25. We'll sell the 25 and we'll buy the 24's. Well, let's take a look at what happens to your delta. Oh, actually, there's a better way to do this. If you sell the 25's and then buy the 24's. Yeah, cool. So here's essentially what happens. If you take a look at what, let's say, for example, your theta is at spot price when you start the exercise here. Your theta in the beginning is $2.71. When you add your second leg, your theta literally becomes 32 cents. So while the theta still matters, when you're trading narrow spreads, it's really more of a directional bet than anything. Because yes, they do experience theta decay, but it's going to be quite muted on a relative basis because again, you have the other leg that's effectively cancelling out the other leg. That's the whole point of them. Is it really mute all of the Greeks across the entire profile? So the short answer is whenever you're selling premium, yes, from an absolute general perspective, when you're within 60 days for an at-the-money option, your theta decay is going to accelerate exponentially until you get to zero. But when you're trading something like spreads, you're already muting it from the jump. So you're already going to have much slower Greek movement from the get go. So it doesn't mean anything terrible, but it just means that you can kind of sell almost where you want at that point. Like if you go outside of 60 days, then it's going to be even slower. So I wouldn't necessarily do that. But I think vertical spreads, that's just one of the big downsides to them realistically is how effectively this happens. MFN says do you an expect an aggressive upthrust of GME asset in the nearly soon? Good question. I don't see anything. Honestly, I don't really see any big catalyst right now. I'm actually going to do a video probably right after this to deep dive GameStop for everybody just to get caught back up on where things sit. So I will report back soon and let you know if there's anything in there that I'm seeing that sticks out to me. But I mean so far, the aggressive upboard thrusting seems I don't want to say I'm likely because I don't know. I haven't really looked at it, but there's nothing jumping out at me that leads me to believe that there is going to be highly aggressive upboard thrusting of the GME asset. But we will report back our fine. All right, gang. Great hanging out. I'm stoked to be back on the Saturday cadence. It's really fun just to poke through this stuff. I think GameStop is just such an interesting stock to look through the lens of trading and the markets from. So it's always fun hanging out with you all. As always, if you need anything, you can just hit me up in the discord, be an outlier, be an ape. I'll see you guys later.
