0.92s: what is up outliers today I am just
4.40s: going to recap some of the GameStop live
8.20s: stream that I do Saturdays at 5:00 P
9.84s: p.m. Pacific time because I actually
11.36s: learned some really interesting things
13.76s: and because it's a short Market week I'm
16.60s: going to do my standard weekly Outlook
18.72s: video tomorrow being Monday because
20.80s: that'll be right before the um the
22.88s: Market opens on Tuesday so today will
24.84s: just be about GameStop and there was a
27.16s: couple really really interesting things
28.84s: that I picked up from the live stream
31.52s: yesterday which I always remind
32.80s: everybody I have a blast doing those
35.64s: because of this because I have the
37.08s: opportunity to learn a little bit
38.72s: hopefully share a little bit of my
41.16s: experience and information with others
43.32s: to maybe help them with their process
44.96s: but I love that it's this beneficial
47.16s: back and forth style interaction which
49.72s: is super fun because I think it's um
51.68s: really informative for everybody so one
54.84s: of the things I did yesterday was I
57.88s: popped onto dfes raring
60.68s: ky's page on Reddit and I went all the
64.24s: way down as far as I could go to the
65.64s: origin and I found something fascinating
69.04s: something that I didn't expect to see
71.36s: personally and when I clicked into this
74.12s: I can see that we started with
77.24s: $3,962 account and I can see $3,962 is
81.08s: in cash and then I can see $100,000 is
84.88s: used okay nothing so special about that
88.36s: this is what I find
91.00s: semi- special the fact that his entire
95.24s: portfolio here is in
98.04s: options I genuinely took the cat to be a
102.60s: stock Trader that used options to
106.00s: amplify his position this tells me
109.20s: otherwise this is an options Trader now
112.32s: again obviously he trades stock and
113.88s: stuff like that I'm not saying he's one
115.16s: or the other most of us are not um you
117.80s: know relegated to being one or the other
119.52s: but my original perception was that when
122.20s: I went back this far and started looking
123.92s: through these that I actually would have
126.08s: seen a stock position and then some
128.44s: options amplifying it not just options
132.32s: so I found that really really
133.72s: interesting and the Curious thing is I
135.88s: go through a couple of these different
137.24s: cycles that I can see these different
139.40s: posts and I pick up another really
143.32s: interesting series of adjustments that
146.44s: go into these positions so the first
149.08s: thing I want note is take a look at the
154.16s: fact that we have a th000 total options
157.68s: in here and we started with just 50 then
162.56s: we started with another 50 and notice
164.80s: the time between these trades so we see
167.96s: from the 7th to the 20th to the 12th to
170.32s: the 18th so we can see sometime passes
173.24s: we're not scaling in right away and one
175.84s: of my favorite Parts here is we actually
177.24s: get to see a little bit of degenerate
179.08s: Behavior I use that term with all due
182.16s: respect and just love for the dude and
185.52s: what he does and I also identify as a
188.32s: degenerate I think that's what most of
189.92s: us are as Traders and I see he starts
193.92s: you know with five grand five grand five
196.16s: grand five grand and he you know he's
198.36s: buying when at 60 75 55 50 and then all
201.32s: of a sudden I see a 21 Grand block come
204.64s: in so then he grabs 200 at 30 this is
209.44s: the quintessential adding to a losing
212.36s: position scaling in now again I say that
215.72s: partially in just because a lot of the
218.36s: the standard methodology you will hear
220.64s: from a lot of Traders kind of like the
223.04s: can slim style specifically comes to
225.48s: mind but others as well where you don't
227.20s: want to add to losing trades I myself
230.44s: actually don't fully believe in that and
232.56s: I think that once you become a slightly
234.12s: more experienced Trader you get to
235.92s: explore these areas of nuance so to me
240.28s: I will add to losing positions if it's
242.28s: part of the broader plan so I don't
244.56s: actually view this as just kind of being
246.52s: you know like a lost YOLO degenerate
248.80s: Trader I view this as him scaling into a
251.60s: position and then when it got really
253.08s: cheap he liked it at 60 he liked it at
255.00s: 75 he loved it at 30 that's that's what
257.20s: I took from this because the other thing
259.32s: I noticed is that he also scaled back in
261.20s: as it was going up so this is a really
264.80s: interesting Behavior to me specifically
267.20s: because he started so light 50 50 50 50
271.88s: and then he essentially Doubles Plus for
274.52s: the rest of these transactions the
275.88s: smallest transaction after that is 100
278.12s: Lots so that I can't help but find
282.80s: interesting now another interesting
285.80s: thing I find about this is that this is
288.00s: clearly centered on a specific strike so
291.52s: he's scaling into the same position over
294.16s: time so if we go back to this first we
297.68s: can see that this position went on
300.88s: pretty early and if I hover over this it
303.48s: should tell me when he posted this the
305.60s: 8th of September 2019 8th of September
309.72s: in 2019 take a look at the options he
311.68s: bought he bought
313.68s: leaps that were out in
316.08s: 20121 so he's playing the long game here
319.32s: the other thing that this tells me is
320.80s: especially when he first started with
322.52s: GameStop is that this isn't as scalped
326.76s: of an approach as I thought because one
329.28s: more analyzing everything that he's
331.36s: doing it's so easy to fall into
334.60s: this I don't know to this mindset where
336.84s: it's like yeah this dude essentially is
338.40s: a time traveler he knows what's going to
339.80s: happen before it happens he positions
341.20s: and times it perfectly and as I look
343.88s: through more of this again he's an
346.24s: absolute stud he's crushed it but it's
348.92s: not perfect and again I use that with
351.40s: all due respect I'm not saying that he
353.56s: did anything bad or anything like that
355.08s: it was just that my perception after
357.52s: looking through and reading about him I
359.32s: I kind of built him up to be where
362.12s: everything I thought he did was like
364.12s: perfect and as I go back this far I can
367.28s: actually see elements where again
369.56s: there's no reason for him to go out as
371.72s: far with leaps if he had a specific date
375.20s: or specific time in mind for something
377.40s: to happen so this to me represents him
381.52s: trading this broader thesis of him
384.08s: liking GameStop this is again to me not
388.20s: indicative of him attempting to trade
390.24s: these different FDD cycles and stuff
392.12s: like that in the beginning because
394.12s: otherwise I don't see why you would
395.76s: position it quite this way but I thought
397.88s: that was interesting then if we scroll
400.08s: up a bit we have to go for a while
402.68s: because this is still the same position
404.24s: all options we have to scroll up more
406.76s: this is
407.84s: now 29 November all options still no
412.12s: change then we go
414.96s: into 11 December all options still with
418.84s: a couple with one additional trade here
421.60s: so his account value is declined it's
424.04s: gone from 113 down to 83 and he added
427.24s: another 100 Lots at the same strike so
431.28s: now he has 1100 so he's kind of moving
433.56s: an even lot increments again this is all
436.00s: part of the fingerprinting process for
437.68s: me then this
441.04s: happens we now go into a bunch of
444.32s: different expirations and what I find so
447.12s: interesting about this change is notice
450.16s: how we now have even closer
453.44s: expirations so we still maintain this
456.04s: eight call position but then we have
459.04s: July in 2020 April in 2020 Feb in 2020
464.28s: and then April in
465.72s: 2021 so he's maintaining a deep position
469.88s: he scaled down this front options
472.88s: position and he spread some of his
475.84s: Capital around fascinating he took this
478.12s: from over $100,000 position to down to
480.92s: 62 and then he started moving that out
482.96s: into other strikes and
485.56s: expirations very interesting and again
488.32s: this was really surprising to me because
490.40s: this is all the way out now in 31
492.56s: December 2019 and there's still no
495.08s: shares at all in this picture it's all
498.72s: options find that very interesting so
501.92s: then we go out a little bit further we
504.64s: still have all options and this is now
508.72s: 14
510.64s: we go out further this should be the end
513.32s: of Jan 2020 all options then we have end
518.76s: of Feb
520.12s: 2020 all options his account has
523.56s: contracted meaningfully he's down to 44
526.96s: Grand from his start I don't I didn't
529.48s: catch what his Peak was but from his
531.76s: start was over 100 now we see
535.44s: shares so this is the first time that we
538.80s: see shares enter this equation and it's
541.84s: just
543.72s: $1,400 so his account value is now back
546.80s: up quite a lot he has 117 in cash 215
551.24s: total so my guess is he deposited a bit
553.68s: of money here and then obviously made
555.92s: some money potentially off of these
557.32s: options and stuff but this takes us now
559.52s: to April of 2020 is the first time I see
562.04s: him buy shares so this dude has been
564.84s: trading options really as a leveraged
567.76s: position for some time as he's building
570.20s: out this position in May of 2020 notice
573.48s: his share equivalent hasn't changed and
576.16s: he's building out more options so I
579.32s: thought that was really fascinating and
581.44s: I learned a lot about the way that he
583.80s: tends to purchase options what
585.76s: expirations all of the trades that I've
587.64s: seen him put on as I scroll through this
590.20s: whole Saga is not short-dated he's not
593.96s: doing a bunch of stuff that's expiring
596.12s: in like 5 Seconds most of the stuff that
598.84s: he's buying are things that are further
600.80s: out in time and most of them are out of
603.84s: the money right so we can see that in
606.48s: this case the stock was trading at 401
609.12s: and we can see that he had the eights 10
611.64s: 15s 20s and 12 across different
614.48s: expirations these were all further out
616.24s: of the money so the other thing that I
619.80s: identify as I go through this whole
622.16s: process with him is his preference for
627.20s: strike selection via I'm using it ment
629.88s: is a surrogate
632.04s: Delta he has a bit of a Delta preference
635.60s: so we can see him now scaling more into
638.16s: shares more into shares again and this
641.84s: process continues for him so I don't
644.44s: know if everybody else knew that it's
646.72s: probably old news to the vast majority
649.36s: of people out there but again I'm new to
652.28s: this so I'm enjoying learning these
654.36s: different artifacts myself this isn't
656.08s: something that I've come across a lot of
657.48s: different places I think one of the
659.04s: reason why I didn't expect to see this
660.84s: is because when I first started doing
663.16s: the the live streams and talking with
664.60s: people like Newton and kind of learning
666.20s: the background it was explained to me
668.52s: that actually for a long time super ston
671.40s: and like some of these other communities
672.72s: wouldn't even allow the discussion of
674.52s: options which again that just led me to
677.60s: believe like oh okay yeah then you know
680.16s: since so much of this is modeled after
682.72s: roaring Kitty I took that to mean that
686.64s: yeah he obviously used options just as a
689.48s: position amplification but the majority
691.56s: of his money more often than not would
693.08s: be in stocks that starts to happen here
696.00s: in July of 2020 as he's moving into more
698.84s: and more of the equity so really
701.72s: interesting and I'm really interested to
704.84s: see if we find out soon hopefully if
708.84s: he's maintained some sort of GameStop
711.00s: position as he's been playing chewy
714.16s: because as I go through his entire
716.48s: portfolio going back from when he
718.00s: started here I mean it's all GameStop
722.36s: right so I haven't seen him trade other
724.72s: things in here and I haven't really
728.84s: picked up on this is
731.24s: hilarious um I haven't really picked up
735.16s: on that that pattern for him so yeah I
739.12s: love the way that this dude calls it a
740.96s: straight Yolo from the get-go that's
743.68s: essentially exactly what I see here as I
746.36s: watch his account value go from 22 Mill
749.64s: to 48 mil to 33 mil and the dude just
753.52s: doesn't care he's just holding through
755.64s: all of this I saw the account value go
757.92s: down to 26 I mean it's epic it's
760.96s: absolutely epic so then we see the
762.92s: ending account value at like 34.4 mil in
765.88s: 2021 final update this I find
768.72s: interesting that he called it the final
770.20s: update on 16 April this is interesting
773.32s: and I would love to learn a little bit
774.64s: about why this as the final update
777.12s: versus April 17th or the end of April
779.80s: like why here I don't know if this had
781.76s: to do with the case and stuff like that
783.60s: that was going on and the fact that he
784.96s: was going to have to appear in front of
786.56s: Congress I don't know if that happened
788.36s: here or if this happened previous to
790.36s: that you guys um got to help me with
792.68s: that because I know that you know the
794.28s: timeline better than I do but then he
796.64s: comes back obviously to June and the
799.96s: dude has gone from 34.4 Mil to
803.44s: 210 so quarter of a billion absolutely
807.08s: fascinating learn a lot so what I want
809.60s: to do in the next gme live stream is
811.92s: actually go through these Early Trades
813.76s: more in detail and like go back into On
816.32s: Demand on thinker swim and like actually
818.12s: explore these positions see what they
820.08s: looked like at the time that he was
821.76s: getting in because for me sheer
824.68s: curiosity this is not something that I'm
826.56s: looking to trade off of I actually model
828.80s: exactly nothing what I do after Roar and
831.48s: kitty respect him tremendously obviously
833.84s: but what he does works for him and I can
836.28s: tell you I've been trading for a long
837.84s: time but there's no chance that I want
839.88s: to put my entire portfolio into a a
842.24s: single position that's just my uh my
845.76s: risk tolerance and I know myself and
847.80s: it's because you know my background with
849.48s: money and like what I'm trying to do is
851.12s: different than what Hugh's trying to do
852.56s: it seems and that's okay right different
854.48s: people have different objectives all I'm
856.08s: saying is that because I understand
857.44s: there's a difference in our motivations
858.76s: and the way that we treat risk this
861.64s: wouldn't work for me but the
864.16s: overwhelming majority of his success
866.40s: obviously came from his intellect his
867.80s: ability to identify these opportunities
870.16s: but also his willingness to literally
872.80s: take from the jump his $100,000
875.00s: portfolio and take $100,000 of that and
877.40s: just put it directly into options like
880.24s: that is not an insignificant move to
882.92s: make so really really cool to see so
886.80s: yeah that's some of what we learned from
888.12s: the past weekend I'm looking forward to
890.36s: diving in even further learning more as
892.00s: always if there's anything I should take
893.16s: a look at let me know be an outlier I'll
896.48s: see you all later
