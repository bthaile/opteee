0.08s: 13 options trading lies that you've been
3.24s: told now that's a little inflammatory
5.64s: not all of these are directly what I
7.12s: would call lies but there are a lot of
10.84s: misrepresented data points that are
12.72s: super misleading to people so the goal
14.36s: of this video is to walk through 13 of
15.88s: them what they are and then to give you
18.24s: the reality around some of them
20.36s: hopefully so that you can make better
22.52s: trading decisions let's get straight
24.72s: into it so this is actually a post that
27.32s: I recently did on Reddit not too long
30.24s: ago and it serves as a great spot for us
32.84s: to start the conversation and I'll be
35.20s: able to add way more color around these
37.64s: obviously because we are on a video so
39.80s: the first one you see here is 90% of
43.48s: options expire worthless and the reality
46.84s: this is not true the overwhelming
49.40s: majority of options are closed before
52.84s: expiration 55 to 60% of the total option
56.92s: contracts that are opened about 30 to35
60.12s: 5% of those expire worthless so the
63.92s: reason why this matters is because
66.28s: sometimes when people will say like oh I
69.52s: like to sell options because most of
71.72s: them expire worthless it's not the case
75.08s: and it's important to differentiate
77.32s: that's why I highlight a lot of these
80.20s: it's not just because the fact in and of
82.68s: itself is wrong but it's the
84.92s: implications of what the LIE is in this
89.96s: context so you can look at this data um
92.56s: the OIC or sibo whatever your preference
95.24s: is but the cliffnotes version is most
98.44s: options are actually traded before
99.96s: expiration the next one is the followon
103.04s: argument of but that means most options
106.56s: that are taken to expiration expire
108.04s: worthless that's correct and it doesn't
110.64s: matter the reason why it doesn't matter
112.28s: is because again the implication of the
114.76s: first one are people typically taking
117.44s: that to think that we're better off
118.76s: selling because of this and it's not the
122.44s: case so that followon argument point is
126.08s: really just more pedantic than anything
128.08s: again it's not wrong it's completely
129.40s: fine but what I'm most interested here
133.00s: are the rationale and the implications
135.48s: of things which is the next one is
136.84s: selling Theta is an edge the answer to
140.56s: this is sometimes it inherently is not
145.04s: an edge Theta is simply the measurement
148.96s: of time so when we think about an option
152.24s: an option has two parts of the premium
156.28s: intrinsic and extrinsic value x trinsic
159.68s: value is broken off it has time which is
164.12s: we know time time is defined at the
166.48s: onset of the option time decays linearly
169.20s: and then there's volatility the
170.96s: volatility component is where there can
173.88s: be Edge in selling Theta or selling
176.52s: options for the sake of collecting Theta
179.40s: but the time frame that it makes sense
183.16s: is not always and it's actually relative
185.88s: to the relationship between implied and
188.80s: realized volatility so if we take a look
190.92s: at this down here you can see that there
193.12s: are periods where implied volatility
196.00s: exceeds the same time frame for realized
198.92s: volatility and then other times it's the
201.76s: inverse so in this case if you sell
204.32s: Theta here you actually can lose money
207.32s: because the realized volatility is more
209.84s: volatile than what's implied which is
212.16s: what's priced into your options when you
214.24s: choose to sell now a couple cliffnotes
217.00s: versions for General context here is if
220.36s: you're looking at things like spy well
223.64s: this very often will have risk premiums
227.08s: so if you take a look at this chart this
229.64s: is going back 6 months notice that there
231.92s: is this one period this was back that
233.96s: move during August of this year where
236.08s: realiz really picked up a bit compared
238.36s: to implied but generally speaking the
240.88s: indices are going to have risk premiums
243.16s: so it is absolutely okay and safe to
246.60s: assume in general you can find risk
249.96s: premiums through selling strategies you
252.08s: can say that the problem is that unless
254.72s: you're Delta hedging in purely isolating
258.24s: volatility which most people don't
260.04s: you're not fully exposing yourself to
262.56s: this exact phenomenon and again the
265.60s: implication here is people will
267.32s: automatically default to sell it
270.28s: because they think that selling always
272.40s: has an edge and it doesn't in something
275.24s: like S&P 500 it very often will but it's
277.92s: not always so it can be really
280.08s: misleading the next one this one's
282.36s: really native to the people that trade
284.68s: the wheel which is when we save things
286.68s: like I'm going to sell puts to buy stock
289.40s: at a discount and collect a premium that
293.04s: sounds great doesn't it sounds really
294.60s: really good here's the problem if you
296.72s: sell a put let's take a look at an
299.04s: example something like spy and you come
302.36s: in here you go 49 days out and you grab
306.32s: these 30 Delta short puts the
308.88s: 592 and you sell them when you sell a
312.12s: put you are taking undefined down to
314.88s: zero risk and you have defined profit
318.60s: what's the payoff for that why would
320.60s: somebody take that trade well it's
322.20s: typically because implied volatility is
323.88s: overpriced so you have a little bit of a
326.24s: structural Edge when that is the case
328.72s: and the second component is you have a
330.24s: bit of a buffer space to be wrong so
332.80s: spot price right now is like 603 it can
335.12s: move all the way down to here which 586
337.96s: and change and you can still hit a
340.68s: profit so you get a bit of a buffer room
342.96s: that's also great the problem people
345.48s: have when they sell puts with that kind
348.04s: of mindset the first thing is not
351.00s: comparing it to any other strategy but
353.32s: at the time of expiration if you're
356.44s: assigned a put let's say the stock drops
359.04s: to 5 70 you're buying the stock in this
362.84s: context at 592 when spot price is 570
367.80s: this you're literally buying it at a
370.56s: premium at the time of expiration the
373.00s: reason why that matters is because when
375.68s: people say things like this they're only
378.40s: trying to focus on the elements of the
380.40s: trade that they like that sound good
383.48s: that Comfort them and they're not
386.00s: actually thinking about what the reality
388.20s: of the position might look like which
390.60s: sometimes can be kind of ugly so if we
392.64s: take a look at something like Tesla and
395.96s: let's zoom out let's do like a threeyear
397.76s: daily if you sold puts in here and let's
401.76s: say that you're like oh I would love
404.00s: owning Tesla at 302 back in 2022 we we
408.08s: just think that's a bargain what a great
409.88s: spot to be able to get Tesla so I'm
411.60s: going to sell these puts so that maybe
414.08s: I'll get assigned at a discount but
416.44s: here's the problem when it's at a
418.08s: discount relative to when you sell the
420.20s: puts in time frame there's a reason why
422.72s: it's going down so the original calculus
425.40s: that you had that decided that it was a
428.28s: discount at the time of selling the puts
431.12s: might not still be a discount in the
433.44s: scenario that you're assigned on the
435.36s: puts because things change that's why
439.12s: the underlying price moves so you might
442.48s: find yourself getting assigned at three
444.32s: and change thinking that you got in at a
446.08s: steel until it drops to $11
450.16s: so the main issue here is not selling
452.80s: puts I sell puts all the time selling
454.40s: puts is fine but it's the way that
456.76s: people do this and the tricks they play
459.36s: because they want to feel comfortable
461.36s: now if you really want to sell puts to
463.56s: buy a stock at a discount guess what we
465.88s: do rather than coming in and selling
469.00s: some sort of 30 put what you need the
471.92s: underlying to drop a bunch to get there
474.28s: so maybe we actually sell something
476.12s: that's slightly in the money maybe we
477.84s: grab the 350s or the 350 5S that are
480.28s: like a 50 Delta you're going to collect
482.40s: a ton of extrinsic value and your
484.40s: probability of being assigned is much
485.88s: higher which is what we're saying we
487.92s: want so you're actually getting the
489.56s: stock at a little bit of a discount
491.20s: because of the premium received to
492.64s: current spot price and you're collecting
494.20s: way more money to do it but alas most
497.24s: people say that they're really
498.32s: comfortable with assignment until the
499.92s: stock drops 15% and then all of a sudden
502.24s: they don't want that to be the case they
503.92s: don't want assignment anymore rightfully
505.36s: so conditions change all right next one
508.20s: to make money on a long option you need
509.88s: the stock to go to be at or above your
513.12s: strike price this is only true at
514.88s: expiration this is a really common
516.76s: mistake going back into Tesla let's say
520.72s: that we think Tesla is going to go up
522.20s: we're going to go out about 90 days this
523.84s: is 84 days to expiration and let's say
526.40s: that we go really far out of the money
528.36s: and we grab these
530.56s: 500 calls super far out of the money and
534.00s: we take a look at there's two lines
536.12s: there's a purple line which represents
537.60s: today and then there's a blue line which
539.16s: repres represents at expiration at
541.44s: expiration you absolutely need to be
544.88s: above your strike plus the premium you
547.12s: paid in order to make any money at
549.40s: expiration notice what this purple line
552.04s: does well before expiration as soon as
556.96s: Tesla starts to go up isolating Delta
560.44s: meaning volatility isn't changing and
562.44s: not focusing on time Decay yet this
565.16s: means that the underlying appreciates
568.12s: the options call options will appreciate
570.24s: you will make money so in this case you
572.36s: have the 500 calls even if Tesla goes
575.36s: from spot price today which is 345 to
579.76s: 350 you make 70 bucks that's nowhere
582.12s: near 500 it's nowhere near your strike
583.84s: price but you still make money so the
585.72s: caveat here is you do have to make sure
589.12s: that you're overcoming any changes in
591.68s: volatility and any changes in Theta
593.92s: which is actually why a lot of times I
595.88s: go further out in time like this 84 days
597.92s: to expiration because if you take a look
599.44s: at the Theta here it will be much less
601.96s: Theta here is 15 cents if we come into
604.60s: this 21 days to expiration we go to that
606.68s: same 15 Delta you take a look at Theta
609.12s: it's 25 cents it's nearly double so
612.04s: that's the trade-off there I have a
613.28s: video that goes Super far into detail on
616.16s: buying call options smarter to balance
618.80s: all of these things including gamma but
621.36s: for this specific point you just need to
623.68s: know you don't need it to go above your
625.92s: strike price in order to make money you
627.56s: make money quite a bit before that the
629.56s: next one you can't go broke taking
631.08s: profits you absolutely can and this is
634.16s: for a very specific reason that's pretty
636.60s: simple it has everything to do with
638.84s: expected return sooner or later risk is
642.52s: going to be realized what I mean by that
644.72s: is so we have nine winning trades one
647.04s: losing trade you're making $50 on each
649.96s: of those winning trades so it's really
651.52s: high win rate 90% however on that one
654.64s: loss if you lose $475 your gross overall
658.88s: expect p&l here is 25 bucks you lose
661.76s: money so why why is that the case you
665.28s: can't go broke taking profits well the
667.04s: problem is sooner or later if you
669.60s: continue to trade you're going to have a
672.12s: loss so the only scenario where you
675.84s: can't go broke taking profits is if you
677.92s: don't have a losing trade which you're
679.48s: we're all going to have at some point so
681.00s: it's a it's a completely broken saying
684.20s: that forces people into something called
686.00s: the disposition effect which is really
687.72s: well studied and is where Traders have a
690.72s: propensity to take winning trades down
692.52s: too fast and let winning trades run too
695.40s: large and these kinds of sayings feed
698.28s: directly into that the way we need to
700.44s: manage trades is based on expected
702.12s: return it's not about little sayings
704.08s: like you can't go broke taking profit
705.68s: because sooner or later you're going to
707.24s: have losing trade which can hurt the
710.00s: next one buying is better than selling
711.68s: or selling is better than buying the
713.68s: punchline here is neither is better they
715.76s: both have have a use case that's really
717.60s: important and if one was structurally
720.32s: better than the other nobody would do
722.56s: the other there's lots of smart people
724.12s: in markets so they have use cases they
727.92s: both have pros and cons it's up to you
729.96s: as a Trader to determine what's better
731.64s: for what you're trying to do I both buy
734.52s: and sell it's entirely context dependent
738.20s: the next grouping options are zero sum
742.72s: so in a nutshell they absolutely are now
746.24s: I want to talk about what this means
748.40s: though because most people when they say
751.64s: options are zero sum it simply means
753.88s: that in order for one option to make
755.72s: money the other option on the other side
758.24s: is losing money this is looking at the
760.68s: option contracts in a vacuum and again
762.88s: it's completely correct the problem is
765.92s: the mindset that it infers against the
769.52s: reality the mindset it infers is that
772.32s: because options are zero sum it means
774.04s: that the counterparty on the other side
776.00s: of the trade is also probably
777.52s: sophisticated that might know more than
779.24s: you do and there's a reason why they're
781.28s: on on the other side of the trade that
782.84s: might be smarter than the reason you're
785.04s: getting into your trade or something
787.32s: along those lines the problem is
789.92s: multiple fold the first thing is the
791.96s: counterparty to your trade is probably a
794.00s: market maker which fun fact the market
796.56s: maker doesn't actually care that much
798.76s: about how much they're going to make on
800.08s: the option itself it's a bonus but they
802.32s: make money off of providing liquidity
804.20s: and capturing the bid ask spread so this
806.32s: is where we remove ourselves from the
809.24s: vacuum of just comparing options
811.84s: themselves and what that might infer
814.24s: against the reality of markets which is
818.44s: typically the counterparty to your trade
820.56s: is a market maker who's going to make
822.24s: money by providing liquidity the next
825.60s: important component is that the overall
829.24s: process that somebody's placing a trade
831.76s: for is different so for
834.72s: example let's go back to our example in
838.40s: Tesla and let's say that we have a short
841.24s: call well if somebody sells a call the
844.32s: General inference is oh they want the
846.44s: stock to go down right options are zero
848.72s: sum so that means if I'm buying a call
851.20s: somebody's selling the call and the
852.44s: person selling the call obviously wants
854.08s: the stock to go down maybe or maybe they
858.28s: have 200 shares of Tesla as part of that
860.68s: position and they actually want it to go
862.08s: up they're just collecting some premium
864.16s: against their long shares and they're
865.60s: actually bullish they might actually
866.84s: have the same thesis you do but they're
868.76s: putting a position on that might make
870.28s: sense for the portfolio so the reason
873.04s: why I call this out is because the
875.08s: inferences people make from it that lead
876.88s: them to incorrect
878.96s: conclusions the reality is markets are
881.84s: very diverse there's lots of reasons why
884.24s: people are doing things so if you take
886.76s: the inference that there Zero Sum to
888.48s: mean that somebody is directly opposing
890.60s: your idea for uh potentially better
892.92s: researched idea it's misleading the next
896.04s: one to make money you need to emulate
898.60s: what inst institutions do this one's
900.84s: pretty simple the fact of the matter is
902.80s: institutions are playing a completely
904.28s: different game than you that's what it
905.52s: comes down to so there are elements that
907.88s: an institution exhibits that are great
910.40s: to model things like having a rigorous
912.52s: process checks and balances training
915.40s: those kinds of things are great but the
917.96s: function of a market maker is completely
919.56s: different you as a retail Trader are
921.72s: making money off of speculating a market
924.72s: maker makes money off of providing
927.24s: liquidity and managing risk literally a
929.40s: completely different game so when people
931.68s: come out and say oh my friend is a hedge
934.80s: fund manager or my buddy does this or I
938.00s: was a former whatever it's cool to have
940.60s: that experience but there's a reason why
942.88s: a lot of people that move from
944.28s: professional trading into retail trading
946.28s: don't do as well and it's because
948.28s: they're just different it's different
950.60s: games so I would think really carefully
954.16s: about what elements of institutional
956.48s: professional trading you try to pick up
957.88s: as a retail Trader because they're doing
960.20s: things differently and I actually use a
962.24s: very specific example here uh at the end
964.48s: of the post it says um taking the
967.88s: applicable elements is great obviously
970.32s: of institutional trading that makes
971.80s: sense but trying to emulate what they do
974.12s: is akin to emulating playing basketball
976.36s: like sha even though you're
978.92s: 56 right that's a it's an inherent
981.52s: attribute that you don't have things
983.60s: that market makers have access to or
985.40s: highfrequency Traders or hedge funds
987.52s: there are access features that you don't
989.68s: have you won't have as a retail Trader
991.64s: so you have to play the game the best
993.72s: you can within your space you absolutely
996.76s: should understand how these entities
998.40s: work what they care about how they
999.92s: behave but if you try to do what they do
1002.76s: you're going to fail because they're
1004.60s: different so you have to play the game
1006.88s: your way institutions are out to get to
1010.08s: retail sometimes and it's kind of tricky
1013.36s: because people the the inference from
1016.32s: this is that you're playing a stacked
1018.36s: game that is only out to hurt you and
1021.80s: it's really not so much the case there
1024.04s: are absolutely instances where a market
1026.40s: maker might try to pursue max pain if
1028.96s: we're within a couple pennies because
1030.48s: why not it doesn't hurt them the problem
1033.40s: is in general institutions are busy
1036.92s: competing with each other on the retail
1039.40s: side you're kind of just around them in
1042.40s: the same space but again you're doing
1044.60s: different things so if you apply a
1047.80s: victim mindset as you're moving through
1049.68s: markets which is the bigger inference
1051.48s: here it's just going to be a complete
1053.44s: hindrance the next one one of my
1055.64s: favorites actually one of the reasons
1056.92s: why I started a YouTube channel is to
1058.40s: counteract these kinds of people make XX
1061.44s: per day per week per whatever time frame
1065.04s: easy with no time or effort and in a
1068.96s: incognito window on YouTube I just throw
1071.88s: in options trading and this looks like a
1074.88s: good video the first one it looks like
1076.76s: they're providing just general
1078.08s: information then the second video take a
1080.20s: look options trading in 10 minutes how
1082.56s: to make
1083.76s: ,000 a day this is a
1087.72s: quintessential clickbait video I don't
1089.92s: know anything about him he might be
1091.20s: great and he might just be playing the
1092.76s: YouTube game not talking crap about
1094.40s: Chris he's probably fine but this
1096.56s: objectively is terrible clickbait
1099.00s: designed to trick people into thinking
1101.40s: that this is a reality and it is not
1104.20s: think of it this way if you could make
1106.72s: $1,000 a day options trading in 10
1109.08s: minutes as a beginner only who wouldn't
1112.36s: do that everybody would there's a reason
1115.32s: why trading has such a high failure rate
1117.60s: so don't fall for this kind of stuff as
1119.76s: you scroll through some more you can see
1121.44s: some basic content this is all good
1124.04s: teaching people how to do stuff this is
1125.64s: Benjamin's Channel he's a homie so you
1127.76s: should definitely check out his stuff
1130.32s: this is also Chris another good dude and
1132.80s: then you get down a little bit further
1134.08s: and then we have this
1136.76s: $468 13 minutes again that can
1139.32s: completely happen there's nothing wrong
1141.24s: with that in and of itself the problem
1144.08s: with this is that it's designed to set
1146.92s: up terrible expectations for you the
1148.92s: beginner and make you believe that this
1150.92s: is normal this is common this will
1152.52s: happen all the time and again it's just
1154.36s: clickbait it's designed to get you to
1155.64s: click through the video again I'm not
1157.24s: saying there's anything wrong or that
1159.12s: that didn't happen I don't know but what
1161.16s: I'm telling you is that the inference
1163.36s: from stuff like this is to make you
1164.92s: think that it's common repeatable easy
1167.32s: and it simply isn't
1169.56s: the next one this one's super simple but
1171.80s: everybody messes this up you'll see
1173.80s: things like rolling avoids
1176.72s: losses and again I go into an incognito
1179.64s: window so it's not skewed by anything
1181.60s: that I look at and the first
1183.44s: non-sponsored post is by this guy and it
1186.24s: says avoid losses by Rolling options
1189.60s: which is utter it's not what it
1192.20s: is at all I actually would recommend
1194.40s: checking out this video that talks about
1196.80s: the reality and how it actually works
1198.88s: this isn't just to promote my own stuff
1200.84s: but it's because there are a lot of
1202.88s: misconceptions about rolling options
1205.04s: like this one here I can tell you what
1207.56s: rolling isn't it's not free money it
1210.96s: objectively is not free money so rolling
1216.28s: options and I'll link to that video so
1218.16s: you can check it out but in a nutshell
1220.04s: it's closing a trade and opening a new
1222.16s: trade and tying the accounting together
1224.32s: whatever the realized p&l of the prior
1226.56s: trade was that's whatever the p&l is
1228.84s: that's what's realized so rolling trades
1232.20s: is literally booking a profit or a loss
1235.08s: whatever it was and opening a new trade
1237.48s: that may overwhelm the prior loss but it
1241.84s: doesn't produce free money it's not how
1244.32s: it works the last thing trading is hard
1247.48s: this is completely completely accurate
1250.92s: but inaccurate at the same time it's
1252.36s: kind of a fun topic actually the reason
1254.80s: why I say that is trading the actual
1257.64s: process of trading is is supremely easy
1260.24s: all of the work all of the difficulty is
1263.72s: done long before you click the button
1267.40s: when you're actually executing a
1269.24s: strategy and physically trading that's
1271.40s: the easy part it's as easy as it gets
1273.28s: it's just execution all of the hard work
1276.28s: is done before this is like people who
1278.72s: practice really really hard Kobe
1280.16s: Bryant's a great example and when he was
1282.12s: playing games he would literally talk
1283.88s: about how game was like a
1286.36s: release because he put himself through
1288.88s: hell in training and in practice so that
1291.84s: games essentially become Easy by
1294.56s: comparison SO trading itself overall is
1299.24s: very difficult the vast majority of
1300.84s: people will fail but if you define a
1303.52s: process you go through the effort of
1305.12s: building strategies building a plan that
1307.76s: you can execute that you trust trading
1310.48s: in and of itself the button clicking
1312.64s: component of it is super super easy so
1315.56s: what are some other options trading
1317.56s: myths or Li eyes you've heard I'd love
1320.12s: to hear them in the comments be an
1321.28s: outlier I will see you all later
