0.00s: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the outlier podcast. We have the one and only Dave
6.62s: Lauer coming back to hang out for a little bit. I guess we are sort of uniform here.
11.46s: You just went with the plain green. I kind of like mixed green going on, but yeah, it's
15.82s: good to see you again. How's everything?
16.82s: I don't think I would blend in the way you would. I think your ears would be slightly more
22.22s: effective probably, but this is the color of money. Yeah, I was just going to say that's
27.50s: like a candle stick chart. Like I literally just want to create your head and your green
31.58s: candle. Yeah. So maybe that's your Halloween costume idea.
34.74s: Or yeah, the kids will love that. I was going to say what are your kids going to make
39.66s: you be? Oh, I don't know. I usually don't. I'd like to hand out candy. That's my thing.
46.26s: I'll hang out. Your kids go. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, I have no idea. We have not even
52.42s: talked about Halloween costumes here. I have no clue. Oh, look at me. I'm crazy. I
61.62s: know it's. We're family that waits the last minute on. I was just thinking more sort
66.42s: of like all the ideas. Like there's a lot of. Yeah. Yeah. For you. Like that, I think
71.02s: from yeah, that would be pretty pretty epically hilarious, but I think it would be the top
76.38s: of my list. I like that. I like your green candle. I'm going to think about it. So you
82.70s: know what we have to start with. Yeah. What's where we have with inflation here?
89.34s: Oh, inflation. Where are we at with inflation? I mean, it's like it. All right. Where do you
103.58s: think? Let, let, let, you know, you ask lots of questions. I'm going to ask you a lot of
106.78s: questions on this one. Where do you think we're at with inflation? I already asked that.
113.14s: So then I'll respond. You're my guest. I mean, you know, the numbers, it looks, inflation
121.78s: is almost gone at this point. Interesting interpretation. It doesn't mean that shit's
132.74s: not way more expensive than it was two years ago. See, inflation is the growth rate, right?
139.94s: It's not, it's not the price level. So it's the thing that that economists focus on is
151.38s: how are prices changing? Right. And, and today, you know, if you look at, you know, as we
160.86s: spoke about after the Fed meeting on the live stream, right? If you, if you look at what
166.58s: the Fed sees, they see, they're at it. They're at it. They're at the two handle. It's on
173.42s: its way that it continues to fall. It's held up by, by housing. And primarily like this
180.98s: owner's equivalent rent. It is, that is a sort of number that's, you know, yes, reflects
188.66s: something. But should that really be driving inflation? You know, does it, does it, does
195.66s: it affect people on a day to day basis like the cost of eggs? No, it doesn't. And, and so, you
204.94s: know, I think when you look at food inflation is very much under control. But that doesn't,
209.50s: that's not to say that like things are affordable. Like it, it, it, it means that those prices
217.30s: are, are no longer increasing at the same pace that they were two years ago. And, in the
226.66s: meantime, the amount of money that people are earning wages is increasing. And so the
234.62s: question always is, is, is the increase in wages outpacing the increase in prices? And
242.10s: that's where you start to talk about this idea of real versus nominal inflation. And where
248.42s: nominal inflation might look, disconcerting real, you know, the real price level is actually,
255.66s: I mean, it's, it's such an inflation is so crazy. It's such a psychological thing, right?
263.86s: Like you go to the store and you see like, well, I don't, I'm sorry, most of my girls
269.74s: are shopping as in Canadian dollars. So I don't, I don't know, but like we see $6. For
275.22s: example, doesn't X for six bucks, but I don't know if it's also six bucks in the US because,
279.54s: you know, sometimes things are usually more expensive up here. But, you know, you see $6. And
285.02s: you're like, fuck, like, you know, a couple years ago, I was paying $4 for these eggs. And
291.82s: this is crazy. It's out of control. But at, at the same time, like the amount of money
295.58s: your earning has gone up to. And so on a, on a real basis, it's actually not much more expensive.
305.42s: But the psychological effect of prices that you were used to for a long time, having reset to
312.14s: a different level is it, you know, I'm not, I don't try to dismiss that. Like there's a distinct
317.98s: psychological effect. And, and, you know, economists study this too. And it takes time. It can take,
323.10s: you know, years for people to get past the shock of an inflationary period. And I think that's
329.34s: what we're living through now is people are still trying to get past that. But a lot of the numbers
335.98s: that you look at, you know, let's talk more holistically though. Do you think we are in or going
343.42s: into a recession in the list? I don't know the next six months. Next six, I would classify
348.94s: it lower probability. I would say next 12 higher probability, almost 50, 50, I would call it.
354.14s: Okay. So I think that's a more interesting question. Because I think inflation is not something that
360.78s: lives in isolation. And if you look at the jobs numbers, the jobs numbers, I think are, are,
372.54s: flashing now. I think there's a red light that's flashing. Because the headline numbers look good.
381.58s: And it's primarily due to seasonal adjustments, which normally makes sense. And normally that's
387.58s: that you have to adjust time series for seasonality. But those kinds of adjustments tend to break down
398.46s: as you are transitioning like from one state to another, you know, if you're transitioning from
406.46s: economic growth to recession, then, you know, those seasonal adjustments aren't always
412.46s: as accurate. So I think if you look underneath covers of the jobs numbers, they're starting to
416.62s: become really concerning. And that is, you know, I think bolsters the argument that the Fed is
422.54s: and remains behind the ball. And that they should have been cutting rates a long time ago.
428.38s: And, you know, I think, and I'm sort of, I think I agree with you. I might even be a bit more
433.90s: negative on the odds of a recession. I think the Fed waited so long that they might have pushed us
440.94s: into a recession in the nearer term. But again, I'm not an economist. I studied it in college. And,
450.06s: you know, I read a lot. But, you know, I think there are some red lights that I'm starting to see.
457.26s: And we're also seeing, you know, I mean, I'm really interested, so sort of hear your perspective
463.18s: on volatility. You know, I just saw this great article in the Wall Street Journal today
470.38s: that VIX-45 calls expiring next, you know, in eight days are going nuts. So, you know, what does that
479.66s: mean for where the market sees volatility over the next, you know, short, short time period? That
488.14s: doesn't, that doesn't seem reassuring to me at all. They locked into the 45s for 16 oct?
495.18s: Yeah. Call options outstanding tied to the VIX with the 45 strike.
500.54s: Open interest went from like 100,000 to over 300,000.
504.94s: I'm sorry, no, I, yeah, because I was looking at the volume, because calls today, trends,
509.50s: like traded super heavy was like 413,000, but I was a little more surprised actually at the 20
515.50s: handle or the 25, I think, let me look. Yeah, the 16 oct 25s, they had 32,000 volume today,
523.26s: compared to the 45s, which were at 21,000. In the 40s, I see it 12. That's interesting that they
534.94s: undone on those.
536.62s: Yes. Yeah, what does that mean? What do you, when you see that, what, what's your interpretation?
542.54s: Um, I mean, expansion and volatility, now whether or not it's a direct play, I doubt that for most
550.14s: of them, I have to imagine a majority of these is hedging a broader portfolio of some sort.
554.30s: Right. And the duration is peculiar, but my, my guess is, I haven't looked at the calendar for
563.98s: the next seven days into next week, but my guess is there's stuff next week that the market is
569.18s: pricing right now. That's, that would be my inference. Let's see, that's actually a good question.
577.02s: I know, I'm actually going to grab a calendar now to some curious.
581.74s: But what is it? The week of the 13th, and those are the 16 oct, which is strange, the 16 oct is
589.82s: strange. I guess it's the only next expiration. So it could encompass CPI, PPI that's coming out
594.46s: later this week. So that's probably going to be jobless claim, CPI. And then what's, yeah, next week,
601.42s: there's a holiday. I'm guessing it's another jobless game, housing starts. Yeah, it doesn't look like
607.98s: anything extraordinary. Yeah. So I have to guess it's the Fed meeting minutes on the ninth,
614.14s: PPI, PPI, because those are going to move things quite a lot.
620.78s: That's my expectation at least. We can also, if inflation comes in hot, then feds going to not
629.74s: height, not cut. Well, did you see? And that's going to send the market, really.
636.06s: Before we move on to the cut and the fed watch tool, I threw into chat GPT out of curiosity.
644.22s: The, I wanted to know the purchasing power of one Canadian dollar in 19 versus 24. And it's 83.22
657.18s: cents. Does that sound right to you? In 19, what do you mean? 2019, comparing it to 2024.
666.46s: So meaning, if you had one, the value has eroded by 17%. Exactly. Now it's at 83.
674.62s: 22. Yeah. I think that the inflation was worse here. That sounds right. Yeah. Okay. Got it.
679.58s: I was just curious. I'd like, I'll throw stuff into chat GPT out of curiosity. See how accurate it
683.58s: is. I don't really trust it that much. But I use it to, well, not chat GPT, I use perplexity
691.58s: as a, as like a junior programmer. And it's excellent. Excellent. Really impressive. Yep.
698.78s: Great for that. Yeah. Amazing. An amazing time saver. Oh, it's huge. I can only, like, could you
705.90s: imagine being like a high school kid now? Yeah. There's never a problem that cannot be figured out.
712.70s: Yeah. Yeah. That's actually, you know, if I think about it, one of the reasons why we
715.90s: haven't kids yet is because I know I have to help the little bastards with their homework.
721.90s: When they hit me up, like, you know, hey, because let's, let's be real. The shit that in eight
727.82s: year old working is working on. Nobody knows that stuff. I'm going to actually with some very
732.62s: heavy things. Oh, man. Let me tell you about COVID, Eric. Oh my gosh. All right. School shut down.
742.06s: My daughter was using in like second grade, third grade. And she was struggling with math. And,
749.18s: you know, needless to take this as a house. Like my wife has a master's degree in math. Right?
753.66s: And like, I don't know. You know, I'm not a slouch myself and trying to teach her second grade
759.18s: math was a nightmare. I can't only imagine. I can't. I can't tell you. I was in their thing. Like,
767.26s: if I had a kid during COVID, we would be looking at the same homework, same stumped. I'd be like,
771.98s: listen, bro, I know some about the Patagrian's theorem. Maybe that's see if that works. And I
777.90s: remember my seventh grade teacher. If I didn't use in a triangle when I was writing my peruse,
783.74s: so write it in a triangle somewhere in that paper. And then you'll be alright.
790.62s: Yeah. I have, I had some neighbors that lived next to me in my old house. And I would go over
796.78s: and I would help their kids with their homework because joking aside, I'm, I mean, I'm dumb,
801.58s: but like I can figure someone out. And stuff. I like, I, but some of that stuff I was looking at
808.14s: them. I'd be like, listen, Jaden, I have no idea. I didn't. So we're going to have to come back to
817.26s: this one later, bro. And we're going to do some Google and together. No, I see. I can't wait
821.90s: till high school. Like I feel like high school, I'm going to be able to help the kids out so much.
825.74s: Yeah, but the earlier stuff, like I don't remember learning it. I know how to do most of it. I can't
830.78s: teach you how to do it for the later. No way. You know, no, yeah, it's literally like,
835.26s: especially when you're trying to teach like theoretical things to teach like a young person
839.66s: that it's like, you just have to accept this. And they're like, why? You're like, okay, well,
846.14s: we're going to struggle with this part. You have to accept this so I can teach you the next part
854.22s: that's even more confusing based on this thing that you don't understand. Yeah, that's right,
859.34s: exactly. So looking at the Fed watch tool, there was a really interesting change. And it's changing
868.22s: again right now, actually, okay, again. So one week ago, the probability of no change was 0%.
879.02s: Meaning it was going to be a call. Yeah, no, it's 13%. Right. So we're looking at yeah,
885.34s: now it's 13. What? Someone is positioning themselves. What do you make of this?
891.98s: Maybe someone knows something because that's big. This is actually one of the ways.
898.06s: This is one of the ways that I traded the last rate hike. The first one, I guess I should say,
903.90s: is because when you use the aggregated probabilities tool, oh, no, I'm sorry, the historical.
910.62s: When you use the historical probabilities tool, you can look at the variants in probabilities over
917.26s: for previous periods. And when I was watching Tuesday, it was zero. Right. Wow. Friday and then
925.82s: yesterday. So that's just a two day move. Wow. So riddle me this Batman. Normally,
938.06s: I feel like we look at the markets and this isn't even like satire. Like I genuinely believe this.
943.82s: I think markets are smart. There's tons of super smart people committing tremendous amount of
950.62s: effort and capital to position and to figure this stuff out. I am shocked to see that big of a change
957.66s: on that little of news because I didn't see like some sort of massive new data that came out
964.22s: that would lead to like a massive repricing. Obviously, new information did come out to some degree,
969.02s: but I don't know what any thoughts. So I don't know. All right. If you look at it as a time series,
976.38s: you see when they cut that probability dropped real low, right? Like just a couple percent.
983.98s: Let me grab my screen and then I'll share it so that yeah, people can follow along with us.
991.82s: All right.
999.90s: Let's do portion.
1012.30s: Yeah. So look how it fell pretty hard when the market was certain. There was another cut coming.
1019.26s: And then and that was August 5th by August 19th. It's back. It's up to 60% that there would be no cut.
1029.10s: See that right here. And then it starts falling again.
1036.86s: And now bounces. I don't know. Is it a dead cat bounce? Is someone to someone know something?
1041.82s: I don't know. It's back to where it was.
1050.46s: Literally in the month ago.
1055.98s: Right. So yeah. So it's back to where it was in February. It's also back to where it was
1060.70s: less than just a couple weeks ago. So I don't I mean, I don't know. It's
1066.62s: it feels like there was a lot of certainty. It's like oscillating between certainty and uncertainty.
1077.26s: And I you know, there are probably just two ways that this goes. One, this is sort of just normal noise.
1084.22s: And it's bouncing around or two judging by this sudden open interest in near term very high
1093.18s: VIX calls. I mean, that's you know, the 45 calls. That's pretty far out of the money, right? But
1099.10s: that's those print. Which is units. What's that? This is somebody trying to build units. Yeah. I mean,
1107.50s: those those those trades would print if there was like an upside surprise on the inflation number.
1114.86s: Well, I think the other great point by the way, which interesting like really interesting
1122.54s: reading between the lines because who knows, right? Now one of the things that we can do is we could
1129.50s: take a peek at those VIX calls and we can see what the build out has looked like. So let let me pull
1137.26s: this down super fast for this tool. And then we can take a look at this together because I like now
1144.38s: you kind of have me pretty curious. Okay, here we go. So we can look at what the build out
1157.10s: and VIX is looked like. And then let's just look at today. And then I need to get rid of some of these
1165.98s: fields. Okay. So right now I'm sorting this by premium. So here's 16 oct. I'm only going to look
1181.58s: at the 16 oct. Which is what next Wednesday. So this, I mean, there's massive build out. Yeah,
1196.70s: all across it literally everything 1921. And these are people that are buying those calls. Yeah, I mean,
1205.02s: they didn't pay a ton, right? But that's it's pretty far out of the money. Well, for the 40 and that's
1209.98s: the whole play for the 45s for those that are like not super familiar. Why that would go so far out
1215.50s: of the money. It's not always because they're expecting the stock or in this case VIX to hit 45.
1221.90s: But it's because we like you call it like building units. You can put on way more of those. And then
1228.30s: you just essentially play gamma. But you only do that when you're expecting a big move or if you're
1235.74s: hedging something very specifically that you need that kind of offset. But this doesn't look like
1241.66s: what's hard to say. It's, I mean, it's impossible to say what the portfolio looks like for the people
1246.94s: that are building out these 45s. But take a look at it. I mean, for, and these are essentially same
1252.46s: exact time. So 4,000 there, 3,000 there, 3,000, 3,000. So somebody is, somebody's definitely building out.
1262.70s: I mean, you know, think about it like and the other thing to think about is that these are so far
1266.86s: out of the money and so short term that the it's highly likely that they expire worthless, right?
1274.06s: Unless, unless either it's a hedge in which case doesn't matter if they expire worthless because
1279.26s: that means that the trade you put on is doing okay or someone knows something. This is, this is how
1287.74s: you would look if you were inside or trading. So let's, this is why you're never supposed to
1293.18s: inside or trade like this because the SEC is watching for these exact sorts of things. And it's,
1298.38s: it sticks out like I literally had all different kinds of trade alerts literally designed. That's
1304.14s: how I saw the ones I saw versus what you saw. Which is because there was higher volume in them today.
1309.82s: But it's, it's exactly that. You just look for stuff volume is weird compared to OI and you're like,
1315.66s: something's going on here. Right. Exactly. Well, let's take a quick look at this really fast. I
1320.70s: just want to see the probabilities, which we can use this for. So if we pop into analyze, go to
1328.54s: probabilities. So those are the 16 oct, which is super close. Let's check out the probability of a
1335.82s: touch. This is using one standard deviation move. The probability of getting to the Fort Lake
1342.06s: Fives. Right. Exactly. Hold on. So it's less than it's less. Yeah, it's literally sub point 1%.
1351.82s: Yeah. It's straight up off the scale. I have to zoom in. Yeah. So, so you know, in most
1358.78s: situations, all you're simply doing is handing money over to the call, the call writer in this
1365.10s: situation. Look at this. Zero. Yeah. It doesn't even register. It literally needs a third decimal.
1371.26s: Yeah. So paying almost any money for it is surprising. It's very surprising.
1379.58s: And yet there's a pretty significant build out there. Yeah. What was that? What do we look at?
1386.38s: We just looked at like $365,000 or $465,000 trades in that. Yeah, I can tell you real quick. In the
1394.30s: 45s, I see 65 55 49 48 24 24 16. So yeah, tons. Almost 300 grand there. That you just
1411.98s: listen. Yeah. Yeah. Easy. That's not nothing. It's not nothing. Now, I have to be honest with you.
1418.78s: My perception of like big traits has gotten so fucked up ever since I started looking at the
1424.70s: game stop stuff more in depth. I've gotten way into the weeds on that. And you realize that the cat
1430.94s: is just wheeling and dealing multi million dollar lots and hidden. It's just my my perception of
1438.38s: reality is completely. Sure. But those are those are like, you know, generally speaking, those are
1443.90s: trades where he's these they're in the money or, you know, slightly out of the money or it's an
1449.58s: underlying stock. Like you're actually getting something of value for those trades. Whereas someone
1454.38s: throwing 300 on something that has a zero percent chance of being worth something. Yeah. You know,
1460.30s: that's yeah. Yeah. That's somewhat more unusual. And it's very to your point. It's very indicative
1465.50s: of something. Now with something like the cat, the way we interpret his trades is completely
1469.42s: different. I don't know if you know this, but I literally started a series on Saturday. I do a
1473.34s: live stream. And we went through his Reddit profile. We went to the very first post. Oh, yeah.
1479.10s: No way. You destructed every single trade. And we're like, oh, I post my post. So I think we're on
1485.34s: like episode like six or seven now. But we're like just getting into the 2024 stuff. And I've
1490.62s: learned a lot of fascinating things about the way that he does stuff. Actually, that would be fun.
1495.18s: Let me just realize like there's not too many people that I talk to that are from at least like
1500.70s: generally familiar with options markets. And I forget that you know more about them than I do. So
1507.34s: definitely I want to. Probably. But that was a, where's that anchor man meme? I don't believe you.
1517.66s: Let me show you this because I'm actually really curious. Some of the things that I saw
1522.38s: not even analyzing the cat, but just like a general analysis of the methodology is interesting
1528.22s: to me. And I'm very curious what your opinion is. So here I have to zoom out. I'm just going to give
1535.42s: you a verbal overview. And then we can look at specifics just because it's this is like my workbook
1541.26s: as you can tell it's labeled workbook. And so nothing in here is formatted nice. This is all just
1546.86s: a bunch of bullshit that's cobbled together. So I can see information. That's it. So the entire
1552.54s: genesis of doing this was not to efficiently go through all of his old trades, but it was actually
1559.74s: to like for me to physically see them go to the chart see what it looked like at the time right to
1565.02s: like really build a relationship with what it looked like was going on. And there's a couple things
1569.66s: that I found really fascinating. The first thing is I found when analyzing all of his old options
1578.14s: trades, a really strange tendency. It was almost binary where trades were exited
1586.94s: shockingly pretty early or shockingly very late. The majority fall into the very late category.
1596.06s: So for example, one of the ones that I haven't been able to put my finger on and I don't understand
1602.54s: is these sets of trades here. So GameStop here was trading around like 369 I think. And he had
1612.70s: 15 Jan 2021 and this is 25 Nove. He had 15 Jan 2021. He had 17 calls that he sold, but he kept
1624.54s: the 20s, 15s and 10s. Long story short, as I go through a lot of these, one of the things that I
1631.02s: noticed that I couldn't comprehend is when he was coming up on expiration, he would sell the
1638.94s: in the money options that are deep in the money. And he would leave that out of the money options
1645.18s: on that are doing like two weeks. To me, I would almost do the opposite, especially if the out of
1654.86s: the money's are showing a profit because obviously they're going to get ready to decay way. So my
1660.30s: best analysis of that was if you expect a bigger move, maybe because you have a bigger position
1666.94s: in those out of the money's compared to the money's. You get more leverage on them, right?
1670.54s: That doesn't apply. Same size. It was a thousand lot, thousand lot. You actually have a higher
1675.26s: delta in the money. You would actually make a gross, better amount of money by keeping the
1680.70s: in the money's. So I don't understand that. Sheeps me up at night. These are the things that you
1691.50s: think about at 3 a.m. When you wait, these are the, I know, because you don't have kids right there.
1697.02s: It's that and it's because I have this locked up, a obsessive personality. And one of the things
1703.98s: that I find so infatuating about the cat is as I look at his stuff, there are so many departures
1709.74s: from like what we would consider optimal money making logic, right? Like another thing I can tell
1714.78s: you definitively is that dude doesn't use stops. The other thing I can tell you definitively is that
1718.94s: dude doesn't have profit targets because he has portfolio volatility. That's 100% over the course
1724.06s: of two weeks, right? So it's like, as I look at that, it's just anomalies. It's like you have a
1730.14s: position that's up 40 million dollars. You don't put a stop and you just just just just go. So
1740.38s: take it from the perspective of him not being, I mean, you know, he doesn't call himself a trader,
1748.46s: right? He calls himself an investor. He used to. He changed. So if you watch his more recent
1755.66s: live streams, I actually started going back, I don't know if I mentioned this, your boy's obsessive.
1760.22s: So I started listening to all of his live streams. I started from the very first one. And I've
1767.58s: been going through all of them and they're like four, five hours long. So I do it at like two and
1771.50s: a half times speed. And I just like locked in trying to listen to it. It's very, but if you focus
1778.46s: hard enough, it's there. And long story short, I agree with you. Like he's definitely even the way
1784.46s: that he structures his trades. It's not a trader at all. And I think your analysis on the investor
1789.98s: component is very true. The interesting part is that a lot of the trades that he started putting on
1796.06s: later are trader style trades. They're not leaps. They're not even out six months. Some of them.
1802.70s: Right. Some of them later. Yeah. So, so like in coming back, you mean?
1808.06s: No, even towards saying even before it. Yeah. So even in this period here, he started coming out with
1813.90s: much shorter term options than I would have expected. Okay. Which I thought was fascinating. But
1819.74s: again, overall completely grew with you in terms of because that's the only explanation I have,
1825.02s: an investor believes that something is going to go up. So then if you just hold while it's going
1831.18s: up, and that's been very, very much what I could see from him. And think about your cost basis,
1836.14s: right? Your cost basis. When I say leverage, I'm thinking more that your cost basis on the out of
1841.18s: the money is way lower. Yeah. Yeah. Then on the in the money. And so if you are, if you have that
1847.02s: investor mindset, and you think that you're looking at something going up into the right,
1854.70s: 50 days to expiration, you are very well convinced that it's going to be worth more over the coming
1863.74s: weeks. And if you need, if you want to close something out and raise it for another trade, maybe,
1872.22s: you're going to sell the thing with lower profits.
1876.38s: But who are more gross, right? And then you're going to leave the thing on that you paid less for
1885.82s: because you think that's going to be worth more later on. The tricky part here is he didn't change anything.
1893.50s: So he didn't add anything to the position from here. He actually sold that other that fell in the money.
1899.34s: Right. But we don't, this is all also part of the problem. Like we don't know what his whole portfolio
1905.42s: looks like. Right. Like the multi portfolio thing. Yep. And I agree with that. But it gets more
1910.22s: interesting last one. And then I'll move on with my infatuation here. This one.
1918.54s: He took down the in the monies again. He kept the out of the monies that are now 10 DTE.
1925.74s: That's, I mean, also remember, he comes from Wall Street Betts. Like that's a DGen move right there,
1934.62s: right? It's nuts. You can't forget where he comes from.
1941.66s: Not.
1946.86s: You're looking for logic in Wall Street Betts.
1949.26s: I am. And the funny thing is that that's actually been one of the biggest things I've learned
1953.26s: as I'm like looking more at this stuff is like I have to remember because one of the things that I
1957.98s: also picked up very definitively is that early on. He said, you know, like this is his yellow,
1965.26s: yellow update, right? That's what went on Wall Street Betts. And I looked at the live streams
1970.54s: for his portfolio at the time when he posted the yellow update. And the portfolio that he had in
1977.74s: the live stream had a bunch of stuff in it on the names. The post in Wall Street Betts was in
1983.82s: account with just GameStop. So to your point, because I also think that's a big part of how he
1989.90s: maintained his risk tolerance in here is because if you view the money and there is gone and you turn
1995.50s: a hundred thousand into 200 million, which is still crazy. And you kind of pull out what you want.
2002.62s: I did track every single cash change in the account, like on a total variance delta. So I looked at
2008.94s: the total portfolio value changes and stuff. But one of the questions I had for you when I was
2015.98s: looking at this stuff, because I was actually talking to a buddy of mine that was a market maker
2018.94s: yesterday. He used to make options markets. And I ask everybody that I know that was in that
2024.38s: business, two degree, this question, some super curious. When you see these kinds of orders coming
2031.42s: in from a market making perspective, right? So let's say his latest position where he's building into
2038.54s: multiple hits, two mill plus size. And it's over the course of a few days from a market making
2044.94s: perspective. You see that. What's the what's the internalization? Are you trying to front run and
2050.14s: like move with that order thinking it's informed? Like what's the like what is it? Oh, I yeah, I mean,
2055.82s: I think you're looking at it as highly informed, highly toxic order, right? Like this is an order that
2061.50s: you are your risk as a market maker is really significant. Now there are multiple options market
2070.94s: makers. And so first, you know, you are likely getting hit and backing away. And so then the next
2077.50s: ones, the one that's taking on that next chunk and then back. Yeah, so it does get spread out. It's
2082.70s: not like it all gets concentrated at one firm. And I mean, you know, you're you're talking about
2089.74s: GameStop, which is a very liquid stock, right? Like it trades. And so it's not it's not
2098.46s: crazy to be hedging and you know, to be dealt to hedging and to to increase that hedge over time.
2106.22s: Like you don't have to hedge the whole thing. And you're probably earning some really fat premiums
2111.18s: on it, right? Like you're he's paying for that. And yes. And and you know, that's the
2117.82s: that's the thing, especially with like GameStop options is they are they are just priced.
2123.90s: Yes. Like I mean, the premiums are crazy, right? And people pay them constantly. It's it's like a
2129.74s: money printing machine for market makers. And until you know, until it isn't, of course, and they're
2137.10s: you know, there have been times where it's going crazy. And that's really screwed over some firms.
2143.58s: Even on the equity side, where that if that flow becomes completely one side at all of the
2148.46s: sudden and that thing, you know, it starts to go parabolic like that is a destructive force. But
2153.42s: you know, the outside of those, you know, just handful of times that that's happened,
2158.38s: it's just a money printer really. Right. And then you know, hedging that is I don't think is that
2164.30s: is that hard? Well, especially now, because I think one of the prior arguments is that they,
2169.34s: I didn't realize that we're going to start talking about I love this. This is great.
2172.46s: GameStop now. One of the things that I didn't fully understand though is there's a this big
2180.06s: perception in the community, the like ape community. I'm like, I try to understand like what
2184.70s: they're seeing because they they find a lot of fascinating information. And I find it falls into
2189.66s: I find that it falls into two buckets. Some of it is like this really loosely connected,
2195.42s: tinfoil stuff. And then other things, there's almost like a direct connection, it seems. And
2201.58s: one of the theories that they had essentially was that some of the market makers were under hedging,
2206.70s: which well, your compatriots like to do that from time to time because you all be fucking greedy.
2213.42s: And when something like GameStop though is trading, I have to imagine, especially after 2021,
2221.98s: they're biting the bullet and just hedging. Is that probably a fair guess or no? I think that's
2227.02s: a very fair guess. Yeah, especially on the option side, 100%. You know, like there's just,
2233.18s: there's too much intense idiosyncratic risk in this name. I don't think they take
2240.14s: big risk and there's no reason for them to because of the premiums are so high, right? They're
2245.58s: making so much money on it. They're hedging that as soon as they can. Got it. And then do you think that
2251.90s: like this systemic risk in something like GameStop has changed with the new share offerings from
2257.34s: a market making perspective, Gamma's squeeze perspective, not from all the other stuff?
2261.26s: Yes. I mean, I think that from a company perspective, I think, have been an excellent idea.
2273.98s: And it gives them sustainability, sustainability, a war chest. They can weather anything at this
2281.66s: point. They're not going out of business, right? The short thesis from a bankruptcy perspective
2286.46s: has been taken off the table. That being said, like, you know, there's still a short thesis that
2291.74s: the company's overvalued, but it's not going to, it's not going to go to zero. And so that's done.
2296.70s: And so if you're a short seller and your game is trying to identify companies that are going to go
2301.82s: out to business and short them until they're delisted that this is no longer that situation.
2308.46s: But yeah, I mean, there's just a huge new supply of shares. And likely many were sold to
2314.70s: folks with short positions. So, you know, I think that, yeah, I think that it's hard to argue
2322.70s: the actions from a corporate perspective. But if you're looking at, if you're looking at it from
2326.70s: a short squeeze perspective, yeah, it's probably just the wind out of the sales. Yeah.
2333.74s: Another question for you from just a market making perspective. One of the interesting things
2338.14s: that we see with something like GameStop is the out of the money options as far as you can go.
2343.90s: Yeah. You get hammered. But that's the system. Yeah. That's what I mean. It's market makers print
2351.18s: money on that. So my question though is I don't think it's market makers obviously establishing positions
2358.70s: there. My best guess is that some sort of hedge fund or some sort of institutional position,
2364.38s: like just building units. But I don't know if that's right. That's just my best guess.
2368.22s: Oh, no, no, no. I mean, you think they're their institutional buys of those crazy out of the money
2376.14s: options. I think I, I, the problem with that is I some of the side and I agree with you. I haven't
2382.54s: looked at the tape. So I don't, yeah, I don't know what size because I was going to say some of the
2385.90s: size doesn't read that to me in terms of retail. Because like you'll see the the 125s or something
2393.58s: like that going off for like hundreds of thousands sometimes. And I just sure there's some retail
2399.10s: that can squeeze that out. But like you can't do that that consistently. And I mean, to me,
2404.62s: what that sounds like. So it, I mean, that sounds like a tail risk. That's exactly my guess.
2411.50s: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I mean, you know, these guys who are always losing money on out of the money
2417.66s: options, just don't know and you know, they make their whole year in a day kind of thing.
2423.74s: Pretty sick. Tough business. Yeah. But I mean, there's a great book. Chaos Kings by Scott Patterson.
2432.86s: Did you read that? Okay. So, you know, like universal, that's like, that's their, that's kind of
2437.10s: their model, right? Is there just, they're buying the things nobody wants. And then they're selling it
2442.38s: back to them when everyone wants them. Yeah. And they're just, yeah, the songs you can stay
2447.90s: business long enough. Exactly. You know, those kind of models are really interesting to me when,
2454.54s: when you look at the evolution of market making in general, specifically with where computing is going,
2461.82s: artificial intelligence, I'm not sure how impactful it's going to be as compared to like overall
2465.74s: computing capability. But what do you think market making looks like over the next decade?
2472.70s: Well, that's super interesting. I mean, I, I think that crypto with like the AMM system,
2480.94s: I think that that's a you that's like one of the first sort of unique, uniquely innovative steps
2487.50s: forward since like the advent of high frequency trading, I think. And it almost like democratizes
2494.86s: market making in a way. And it's still not quite there because there are probably, you know,
2502.54s: like it's hard. It's hard to actually make money doing that if you don't really understand,
2507.74s: like it's still not the kind of thing where you can make, you know, gobs of money without knowing
2512.30s: anything. But to me, like that level of automation is, is something that I think we should get to,
2520.46s: like this shouldn't be a small group of firms that controls markets, which is what we have today.
2528.62s: And it would be best for markets in general if it was far more fragmented and diverse.
2534.94s: Don't you think, don't you think if computing power and stuff like that, using that is
2543.02s: an underlying assumption, don't know, you know, how impactful or which way that's going to go.
2547.26s: But wouldn't you wager that if computing power becomes an increasingly important component to
2553.66s: market making, wouldn't that further centralize market making? Well, that's what that's what has happened.
2559.82s: I mean computing and data, you know, data analysis capabilities is everything. Like if you look at
2567.82s: there's a there's a firm, it's less well known in the US because they're they're much bigger overseas,
2572.46s: but they're called XTX. And I think they have one of like the world's largest super computers,
2580.62s: like for AI, like their GPU farm is like one of the top in the world because like that's what,
2587.26s: and they're that's all they do is market making. That's it. And you know, that's been the case for
2592.54s: a long time. I mean, since I've been involved in markets in 2005, you know, the ability to
2602.38s: crunch data faster than the next guy and to crunch a lot of it has that's where edge has come from.
2611.98s: And you know, I think that has led to concentration in the market. That's that's where we're at today,
2620.62s: I think. And so I hope that we get past that. Like they they have to come up to where that kind
2627.74s: of computing power is sort of readily and freely available. It's sort of like an AMM type system
2633.74s: where, you know, everything kind of gets built into these automated contracts and anyone can kind
2639.42s: of put money into the contract, which is managing markets and liquidity and earn money off of that.
2646.86s: That to me is a it's where market making becomes complete utility rather than something that's just
2653.82s: a handful of firms, you know, can control markets with. I see. That's fascinating. Yeah, because when I
2659.74s: originally think about it, I think of it as right now to your point to get more computing,
2665.50s: it's super resource intensive, but exactly if it starts to become more readily available,
2669.10s: that could be a pretty significant flat. And yeah, when when you look at the job of market making,
2677.34s: one of the things I noticed when I talk to different people in different communities,
2681.74s: they have different perceptions. A lot of people view them as like the boogie man,
2686.14s: you know, that they're out there just trying to fuck everybody, which I mean, to be honest,
2690.30s: I wouldn't run it by them. But I mean, I mean, you know, there's a thin line between I want to make
2696.38s: as much money for myself as possible. And I'm going to fuck everybody. Right. So going off that,
2703.98s: if they wanted to fuck everybody in the current structure as it sits now, what are some of the ways
2709.42s: you think they could do that? I think when you look in in some names, especially the concentration
2720.30s: in one or two firms is staggering. And these firms control the price of those stocks,
2726.30s: completely control it. So, you know, they can do what they want with those stocks. And they do.
2733.18s: So one of the things that that Irvin does is we look for market manipulation and we work with
2738.46s: public companies to help them identify market manipulation. And, you know, I can tell you it's,
2744.46s: it's all over the place.
2746.30s: Well, you mean it's 10, Ken is a great guy. He's just, he's just trying to get by.
2752.86s: I am not accusing any specific firm of anything nefarious at all.
2757.90s: Well, I'm talking about generalities. I'll be super specific.
2763.90s: I'm talking perfectly generally that, you know, if you look in, especially in smaller names,
2770.30s: where there's not a lot of volume and there's not a lot of size posted.
2775.98s: They do whatever they do whatever they want. Even better if these names,
2780.86s: it's these stocks are like listed in multiple markets. And there's one market is less liquid than
2785.98s: the other. You know, it's, it's, it's quite easy to control the price. And, you know, you want to
2795.02s: sell it up here, buy it back here, sell it up here, buy it back here. You can push it around.
2800.94s: Yeah. And so, you know, I think that, I think market makers have learned that there is sort of
2808.86s: a base level of manipulation that they can engage in and where they can
2815.90s: understand regulatory scrutiny because they can overpower the regulators with intellect and data
2825.82s: and complexity. And, you know, nobody, everyone's happy because markets continue to function.
2836.06s: Do you think that some of that's an artifact of like the North Star right now is very much
2840.38s: like liquidity focused? Yes. I think absolutely. Yeah. Liquidity is everything.
2848.62s: If you look at our podcasts with, with John Wellborne, we did a couple of them. He's a professor
2857.18s: at Dartmouth. And this is sort of like, you know, his point is that's the root of all evil. Like,
2862.70s: all the SEC cares about is liquidity. Nothing else matters. That's why market makers have this,
2867.42s: short sale exemption and they don't have to leave it shares and such. It's all in the name of liquidity.
2871.90s: And if you like, I always used to say that continuous trading is the root of all evil, but, you know,
2877.66s: it's not quite true. But it's like they go hand in hand, right? For continuous trading, you need
2883.10s: liquidity and you need it continuously. Whereas if you switched to something like periodic or
2889.98s: frequent batch auctions, you can concentrate liquidity and you can concentrate, you know,
2896.86s: real liquidity rather than, you know, this sort of phantom liquidity where they're just printing shares.
2903.90s: And so, you know, I think to me that's a better market structure, but it doesn't really matter
2910.30s: because we're kind of stuck in this continuous model and nothing's going to break us out of that.
2914.94s: What do you think? Why is that? Right? So like, if you offer that alternative and from a theoretical
2921.26s: perspective, it generally sounds like that's better price discovery. Like, that's what that sounds
2925.34s: like to me. Like, real orders, you think it's worth this. I think it's worth this. Let's exhaust
2929.66s: those orders and then whatever the price is is what it is. So from like a layperson's perspective,
2935.82s: that that sounds completely logical and reasonable. So then why not that?
2942.38s: Too many people make too much money with the current system.
2945.98s: As is usually the problem with trying to change it for better. You know,
2951.26s: I mean, I think if you look at like the work that Eric Buttigieg has done, he's a professor
2955.42s: out of the University of Chicago. He's written a couple papers on frequent batch auctions and why
2959.02s: they're superior and what the benefits are. And he's also talked about in some of those papers,
2964.30s: like how would you introduce that into the current system? And it's hard. It's not something
2972.86s: that can probably happen naturally or simply. It's something that, you know, it's sort of,
2979.58s: there's this, if you just have like one spot over here where you have these auctions,
2985.10s: they are offered by certain providers. But then you have this entire market over here, 99%
2991.26s: of which is continuous trading. It's very difficult to attract the liquidity into the auctions
2998.38s: so that they really start to provide material outcomes. That's the issue. It's very much like
3003.34s: a prisoner's dilemma. Interesting. When you look at a couple more questions before I let you
3008.78s: skid that all I know you have, well, I mean, you probably have like important shit to do, but I always
3013.50s: enjoy the ability to just ask dumb questions for a while. But taking this back to GameStop,
3023.82s: what do you think the manipulation, like prospects are for something like that? Because GameStop,
3029.02s: I find, is a little bit of an anomaly because it's not super liquid. It's super volatile. It's
3036.78s: heavily traded. So I think of like these different factors that kind of weigh out differently. And I
3043.02s: try to think of like how much could a market maker manipulate something like that? Any thoughts?
3050.94s: Yeah, I don't know. It's really hard to say. I agree with you. When I talked about it being liquid
3056.78s: earlier, it was really more strictly from the perspective of like an options market maker who needs
3062.70s: to hedge. But a lot of the liquidity has been sucked out of the name because of DRS and
3070.62s: a lot of the holders are long-term holders. So it's kind of a really funky and weird situation.
3077.82s: And I think anytime something doesn't trade a lot, it can be manipulated more easily than
3087.90s: something it does obviously. But there are so many eyes on it. It seems like there's more risk
3095.98s: in doing that at the same time. There's a lot of money involved as well.
3101.18s: Right. I look at stuff like even the base stock volume though. So right now there's what?
3107.18s: Well, think your swim is telling me $446,000 or $446 million shares. I don't know if that's
3112.22s: accurate or not, but just taking that at face value. That's the audience shares. Yeah.
3117.18s: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. But it just changed dramatically because of these markets. Yeah.
3125.50s: Because then I look at the volume today, it's 4.8 million. Call it.
3130.38s: So as a percentage of outstanding, that's like a decent amount of volume. That's still relatively
3135.74s: heavily traded on a percentage basis. Even if you compare it to something like Apple,
3139.82s: I actually think this is more heavily traded than something like Apple.
3144.06s: Yeah. I don't know, man. It's like it's a game-stopper situation. It's hard. I find it hard
3154.78s: to understand the trading dynamics. Price movements seem crazy to me. It's frequently gapping,
3163.02s: but there seems no rhyme or reason to it. Not much, yeah. I don't know.
3169.82s: Yeah, a bit of an anomaly. Yeah. I was wondering if there was some sort of factor analysis
3175.26s: or manipulation. Because I was actually trying to look for papers on that to see if I could
3180.78s: find anything and no luck so far. Are you familiar with anything like that?
3188.46s: I'm trying to think. I'm not. I know that there was some work done, some academic work done
3196.46s: after the SEC's analysis came out of the 2021 trading. That analysis was a fucking joke.
3204.06s: Yeah. I thought that that was a straight joke.
3207.26s: Yeah. That's what the academics came together and they said, we disagree with you SEC
3216.78s: that this was not a game of squeeze. I thought it was pretty good paper.
3226.22s: So I would take a look at that, but at this point, also it's also very dated.
3231.42s: Got it. Yeah. I'm always trying to find just stuff to try to quantify and qualify some of
3237.18s: these things. Because I think one of the things that I try to do especially for the ape side of
3241.98s: the house is because I think so many of them are so used to being deceived, lied to, and then
3248.62s: everything gets written off as manipulation. Yeah. So then it's like, and I understand that
3253.98s: perspective, but I also think that leads to like going too far and thinking like everything is
3259.90s: fucked. So I try to find stuff like that. I'll keep looking and if I do find anything, I'll let you
3266.06s: know. But one of my hopes is to be able to find something related to that and see like if there's
3271.18s: been a decent analysis done. Yeah. I've not seen any of that. Yeah. Yeah.
3276.86s: No. I mean, cool. Last question before you wrap, any new exciting up and coming from Irvin or
3284.06s: from just stuff you're working on? Yeah. I mean, Irvin is doing some interesting things.
3289.74s: And I encourage you all to go check out Irvin.finance and join the conversation there.
3295.42s: You know, it's there's some good, good investment ideas on the platform. People doing research.
3300.94s: It's neat to see a big part of what we're focusing on is connecting public companies to their
3305.82s: investors. But as I told you before we started this today, it became public that we, the investors
3313.26s: are advocacy effort and Irvin have sued the SEC over the final reg NMS rule that was adopted
3323.58s: a couple weeks ago. So I can't really say much at this juncture on it, but I've never sued
3330.70s: the SEC before. So it'll be a learning experience for everybody. It's going to be a learning experience.
3335.98s: Yeah. Super interesting. One question on that. And again, if you can't answer, obviously shut it down.
3342.14s: But I'm curious like what, what was the thought process leading into that? Like, obviously,
3347.18s: there's a culmination point, right, where there's something happens, something happens,
3351.02s: something happens. And then at some point, there's a, okay, fuck this, we need to do something.
3356.78s: What was like that culmination point? Yeah. Right. Again, I'm not sure what I can say at this point,
3367.10s: but you know, what I, what I, I had high hopes for what the SEC was going to do in this rulemaking.
3376.22s: And I think they did a lot of good with it too. I don't, this isn't sort of something to say
3383.66s: that this is trash because it's not. I just think that it fell short.
3388.22s: Missed someone's stuff. Yeah. And it's sort of get to the point where you're like, what else can I do?
3396.30s: Right. We have, we spent time talking to them. People sent letters, you know, by the thousands.
3406.78s: And, and you get to the point where, okay, you've, you've tried, you've exhausted every avenue.
3413.90s: You've tried everything you can. And there's sort of only one, one action left to take at that point.
3419.74s: Really? Yeah. Totally fair. And the reason why I asked that question is just because I want to
3425.18s: highlight the fact that like you, you took action, right? Because lots of people will gripe,
3431.90s: complain, be disenfranchised. And that's something that we the investors has continued to do, right?
3437.42s: Is to take action. And there's not a lot of places that we see that happening. So,
3442.78s: obviously, I'm always a huge supporter of that, that community, the movement, but also like genuinely,
3448.06s: like, thank you for taking the time to do that. Because it is a little bit thankless. I'm sure you
3452.14s: get no shortens of criticism from everybody because that's the nature of doing anything from everyone.
3458.54s: No, because I still give you shit too, because wagyu is garbage. And there's no other way around it.
3466.86s: There's no other way around it. But it takes a lot of effort to do stuff like that. And it takes time,
3474.22s: money, resources. So, yeah, it's super cool that you end the rest of we, the investors,
3480.14s: continue to beat that drum because otherwise, yeah, you just kind of look at it and you're like,
3484.62s: damn, the socks. And then nothing happens. So, yeah, I think it's easy to get for people to get
3489.90s: dismayed and to pull back and to say there's, you know, there's nothing we can do. And that's what
3496.94s: they want, right? That's what they're hoping for. So, you know, I think that maybe people wanted us
3507.02s: to do this sooner. And, you know, I never really saw, I know, I would never, if you would talk to me,
3515.82s: very recently, I wouldn't have said this is anything that we would do. But, but, you know, you get to
3520.46s: the point where you have taken every action you think you should at every step of the way, right? You've
3525.50s: done, you know, as much as you think you could do each time and it doesn't work. And so, you can
3532.54s: do one, you can throw your hands up or you can find the next thing to do. And, you know, I tend to
3537.10s: be just someone who looks for the next thing to do. I'm kind of an eternal optimist in that way,
3541.98s: which is the only way you sort of stay in the reform game after many years because it's a maddening
3547.50s: process. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the last thing to note on that is something I always try to remind people
3552.86s: because you do a good job at this. But I think a lot of people miss the bubble on it. Is that,
3557.02s: obviously, you're playing a deep game here, right? A lot of people they want to, they want change,
3562.46s: they want to see it now. And then if it doesn't happen the next three months, it's like, oh,
3565.90s: God, you know, this is all for not. But the game that you're playing is such a game of delayed
3571.18s: gratification. Yeah, that's not, that's not easy. That's not easy to run it that way, but it's
3577.34s: working with systems like this. It's the only way. Yeah. For sure. I mean, that's exactly the
3582.86s: point, right? Like no change happens like on that time scale, not that I've ever seen at least,
3586.86s: not any, you know, foundational material change. And I know people get frustrated that it didn't
3592.22s: happen, you know, in a matter of days, but I can tell you I've been trying to push for these
3597.98s: changes for many years now. And they still haven't happened despite, I think, being quite obviously
3604.54s: the right thing to do. And so we'll continue to figure out every, every which way we can to,
3610.46s: to get to, you know, improve markets, improve competition and make sure that markets are
3615.34s: accurately reflecting supply and demand, which, you know, is the fundamental purpose and something
3620.94s: that I don't think they do a good job of in a lot of situations right now.
3626.54s: Well, it's always good to talk to an eternal optimist.
3630.78s: The, thank you so much for coming to hang out for a little bit. I always get a chance to
3634.78s: learn a lot from you. And I hope that the audience does as well. I'll throw links to Irvin and
3639.90s: all your stuff below. But yeah, thanks for hanging out there. Great to see you.
3643.50s: Thanks for having me, Eric. Always fun. Yeah.
