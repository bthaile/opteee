0.00s:  What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the outlier podcast. We have the one and only Dave
6.62s:  Lauer coming back to hang out for a little bit. I guess we are sort of uniform here.
11.46s:  You just went with the plain green. I kind of like mixed green going on, but yeah, it's
15.82s:  good to see you again. How's everything?
16.82s:  I don't think I would blend in the way you would. I think your ears would be slightly more
22.22s:  effective probably, but this is the color of money. Yeah, I was just going to say that's
27.50s:  like a candle stick chart. Like I literally just want to create your head and your green
31.58s:  candle. Yeah. So maybe that's your Halloween costume idea.
34.94s:  Or yeah, the kids will love that. I was going to say what are your kids going to make
39.66s:  you be? Oh, I don't know. I usually don't. I'd like to hand out candy. That's my thing.
46.26s:  I'll hang out at your kids. Your kids go. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, I have no idea.
51.82s:  We have not even talked about Halloween costumes here. I have no clue.
56.62s:  Oh, look at me. I'm crazy. I know it's. We're a family that waits the last minute on
65.14s:  one. I was just thinking more sort of like all the ideas. Like there's a lot of
68.50s:  positive for you. Like that I think. Yeah. That would be pretty, pretty epically hilarious,
74.26s:  but I think it would be the top of my list. I like that. I like your green candle. I'm
79.86s:  going to think about it. So you know what we have to start with. Yeah. What's, where
88.22s:  we have with inflation here? Inflation. Where are we having with inflation? I mean, it's
99.70s:  like it. All right. Where do you think? Let, let, let, you know, you ask lots of questions.
106.06s:  I'm going to ask you a lot of questions on this one. Where do you think we're at with
111.26s:  inflation? I already asked that. So then I'll respond. You're my guest. I mean, you
119.02s:  know, the numbers, it looks inflation is almost gone at this point. Interesting interpretation.
131.30s:  It doesn't mean that shit's not way more expensive than it was two years ago. See, inflation
138.14s:  is the growth rate, right? It's not, it's not the price level. So it's the thing that,
148.70s:  that economists focus on is how are prices changing? Right. And, and today, you know, if
158.54s:  you look at, you know, as we spoke about after the Fed meeting on the live stream, right?
164.74s:  If you, if you look at what the Fed sees, they see, they're at it. They're a solidly at
171.34s:  the two handle. It's on its way that it continues to fall. It's held up by, by housing. And
179.94s:  primarily like this owner is equivalent rent. It is, that is a sort of number that's,
186.10s:  you know, yes, reflects something. But should that really be driving inflation? You know,
195.14s:  does it, does it, does it affect people on a day to day basis like the cost of eggs? No,
200.10s:  it doesn't. And, and, and so, you know, I think when you look at food inflation, it's very
207.26s:  much under control. But that doesn't, that's not to say that like things are affordable. Like
213.54s:  it, it, it, it means that those prices are, are no longer increasing at the same pace that
222.34s:  they were two years ago. And in the meantime, the amount of money that people are earning, wages,
231.62s:  is increasing. And so the question always is, is, is the increase in wages outpacing the increase
239.82s:  in prices? And that's where you start to talk about this idea of real versus nominal inflation.
248.06s:  And where nominal inflation might look, disconcerting real, you know, the real price level is
254.86s:  actually, I mean, it's, it's such an inflation is so crazy. It's such a psychological thing,
263.50s:  right? Like you go to the store and you see like, well, I don't, I'm sorry, most of my
269.50s:  girls are shopping as in Canadian dollars. So I don't, I don't know, but like we see $6.
275.02s:  For example, doesn't X for six bucks, but I don't know if it's also six bucks in the US because,
280.06s:  you know, sometimes things are usually more expensive up here. But, you know, you see $6. And
284.94s:  you're like, fuck, like, you know, a couple years ago, I was paying $4 for these eggs. And this
292.14s:  is crazy. It's out of control. But at the same time, like the amount of money your earning has gone up
296.86s:  to. And so on a, on a real basis, it's actually not much more expensive. But the psychological effect
307.42s:  of prices that you were used to for a long time, having reset to a different level is it, it, you
315.10s:  know, I'm not, I don't try to dismiss that. Like there's a distinct psychological effect. And,
319.98s:  you know, the economists study this too. And it takes time. It can take, you know, years for people
324.86s:  to get past the shock of an inflationary period. And I think that's what we're living through now,
330.46s:  is people are still trying to get past that. But a lot of the numbers that you look at, you know,
339.02s:  let's talk more holistically though. Do you think where we are in or going into a recession in
344.94s:  I don't know the next six months? Next six, I would classify it lower probability. I would say
350.78s:  next 12 higher probability, almost 50, 50, I would call it. Okay. So I think that's a more interesting
357.02s:  question, because I think inflation is not something that lives in isolation. And if you look at
366.06s:  the jobs numbers, the jobs numbers, I think, are, are, are flashing now. I think there's a red light
374.70s:  that's flashing because the headline numbers look good. And it's primarily due to seasonal
383.90s:  adjustments, which normally makes sense. And normally that's that you have to adjust time series
391.18s:  for seasonality. But those kinds of adjustments tend to break down as you are transitioning,
401.90s:  like from one state to another, you know, if you're transitioning from economic growth to recession,
408.86s:  then, you know, those seasonal adjustments aren't always as accurate. So I think if you look
414.38s:  underneath covers of the jobs numbers, they're starting to become really concerning. And that is,
419.10s:  you know, I think bolsters the argument that the Fed is and remains behind the ball. And that
424.78s:  they should have been cutting rates a long time ago. And, you know, I think, and I'm sort of,
430.62s:  I think I agree with you. I might even be a bit more negative on the odds of recession.
437.50s:  I think the Fed waited so long that they might have pushed us into recession in the nearer term.
443.42s:  But again, I'm not an economist. I studied it in college and, you know, I read a lot, but,
453.26s:  you know, I think there are some red lights that I'm starting to see. And we're also seeing,
459.34s:  you know, I mean, I'm really interested, so sort of hear your perspective on volatility.
466.14s:  You know, I just saw this great article in the Wall Street Journal today that
471.58s:  VIX 45 calls expiring next, you know, in eight days are going nuts. So, you know, what does that mean
480.62s:  for where the market sees volatility over the next, you know, short, short time period? That doesn't,
488.54s:  that doesn't seem reassuring to me at all. They locked into the 45s for 16 oct? Yeah.
495.66s:  Call options outstanding tied to the VIX with the 45 strike.
500.54s:  Open interest went from like 100,000 to over 300,000.
504.78s:  Oh, I was looking at the volume because calls today, trends like traded super heavy, it was like
510.94s:  413,000, but I was a little more surprised actually at the 20 handle or the 25, I think, let me look.
518.54s:  Yeah, the 16 oct 25s, they had 32,000 volume today, compared to the 45s which were at 21,000
528.86s:  in the 40s, I see it 12. That's interesting that they unden on those.
536.78s:  Curious. Yeah, what does that mean? What do you, when you see that, what, what, what's your interpretation?
542.54s:  I mean, expansion and volatility, now whether or not it's a direct play, I doubt that for most of them,
550.38s:  I have to imagine a majority of these is hedging a broader portfolio of some sort.
556.22s:  And the duration is peculiar, but my guess is, I haven't looked at the calendar for the next
564.54s:  seven days into next week, but my guess is there's stuff next week that the market is pricing right now.
570.22s:  That's that would be my inference. Let's see, that's actually a good question.
577.02s:  I know, I'm actually going to grab a calendar now to some curious.
581.74s:  So what is it, the week of the 13th, and those are the 16 oct, which is strange, the 16 oct is
589.34s:  strange, I guess it's the only next expiration, so it could encompass CPI, PPI that's coming out later
594.78s:  this week. So that's probably going to be jobless claims, CPI. And then what's yeah, yeah, next week,
601.42s:  there's a holiday. I'm guessing it's not. Other jobless games, housing starts, yeah,
607.42s:  doesn't look like anything extraordinary. Yeah, so I have to guess it's the Fed meeting minutes
612.94s:  on the ninth, PPI, PPI, because those are going to move things quite a lot.
618.86s:  That's my expectation at least. We can also, if inflation comes in hot,
627.90s:  then Fed's going to not cut.
632.70s:  Well, did you see the market really? Before we move on to the cut and the Fed watch tool,
640.30s:  I threw into chat GPT out of curiosity. I wanted to know the purchasing power of one Canadian dollar
652.22s:  in 19 versus 24. And it's 83.22 cents. Does that sound right to you?
659.98s:  In 19, what do you mean? 2019, comparing it to 2024. So meaning, if you had one of the value has
669.42s:  eroded by 17% exactly that now it's at 83.22. Yeah, I think that the inflation was worse here.
677.58s:  That sounds right. Yeah. Okay, got it. I was just curious. I'd like, I'll throw stuff in the
681.66s:  chat GPT out of curiosity. See how accurate it is. I don't really trusted that much. But I use it
688.70s:  to, well, not chat GPT, I use perplexity as a, as like a junior programmer. Yep. And it's excellent.
696.30s:  Excellent. Really impressive. Yep. Great for that. Yeah. It's an amazing time saver.
702.86s:  Oh, it's huge. I can only like, could you imagine being like a high school kid now?
709.50s:  There's never a problem that cannot be figured out. Yeah. That's actually, you know, if I think about it,
715.18s:  one of the reasons why we haven't kids yet is because I know I have to help the little bastards with
719.58s:  their homework. Come on. When they hit me up, like, you know, hey, because let's, let's be real.
726.70s:  The shit that an eight year old working is working on, nobody knows that stuff.
731.50s:  With some really heavy things. Oh, man. Let me tell you about COVID, Eric. Oh my gosh. All right.
739.74s:  School shut down. My daughter was, she was in like second grade, third grade. And she was
747.42s:  struggling with math and, you know, needless to take this is a house where like my wife has a
751.98s:  master's degree in math, right? And like, I don't know. You know, I'm not a slouch myself and
757.18s:  trying to teach her second grade math was a nightmare. I can only imagine. I can't tell you.
766.30s:  I was in there thinking like, if I had a kid during COVID, we would be looking at the same homework,
770.46s:  same stumped. I'd be like, listen, bro, I know some about the Patagrian's theorem. Maybe that
776.14s:  see if that works. And I remember my seventh grade teacher. If I didn't use in a triangle when
782.70s:  I was writing my proof, so write it in a triangle somewhere on that paper. And then you'll be
790.78s:  yeah, I have, I had some neighbors that lived next to me in my old house. And I would go over and
796.86s:  I would help their kids with their homework because joking aside, I'm, I mean, I'm dumb, but like,
802.06s:  I can figure someone out. And stuff. I like, I, but some of that stuff, I was looking at them. I'd be like,
809.42s:  listen, Jaden, I have no idea. We're going to have to come back to this one later, bro, and we're
819.18s:  going to do some Google and together. No, I see, I can't wait till high school. Like, I feel like high
823.34s:  school, I'm going to be able to help the kids out so much. Yeah, but the earlier stuff, like, I
827.82s:  don't remember learning it. I know how to do most of it. I can't teach you how to do it for the
831.98s:  like, no way. You know, yeah, it's literally like, especially when you're trying to teach like
836.86s:  theoretical things to teach like a young person that it's like, you just have to accept this.
842.14s:  And they're like, why? You're like, okay, well, we're going to struggle with this part.
851.66s:  You have to accept this so I can teach you the next part that's even more confusing based on
856.38s:  this thing that you don't understand. Yeah, that's right. Exactly.
861.58s:  So looking at the Fed watch tool, there was a really interesting change. And it's changing again
868.46s:  right now, actually, okay, again. So one week ago, the probability of no change was 0%. Meaning
879.58s:  it was going to be a call. Yeah. No, it's 13% right? So are you looking at yeah? No, it's 13. What?
887.90s:  Someone is positioning themselves. What do you make of this? I don't think someone knows
893.10s:  something because that's big. This is actually one of the ways. This is one of the ways that I
899.26s:  traded the last rate hike. The first one, I guess I should say, is because when you use the
906.06s:  aggregated probabilities tool, oh, no, sorry, the historical. When you use the historical
911.74s:  probabilities tool, you can look at the variance in probabilities over for previous periods.
919.10s:  When I was watching Tuesday, it was zero. Right. Wow. Friday and then yesterday. So that's
928.46s:  just a two day move. Wow. So riddle me this Batman. Normally, I feel like we look at the markets.
939.98s:  And this isn't even like satire. Like I genuinely believe this. I think markets are smart. There's
945.50s:  tons of super smart people committing tremendous amount of effort and capital to position and to
952.94s:  figure this stuff out. I am shocked to see that big of a change on that little of news because I
960.54s:  didn't see like some sort of massive new data that came out that would lead to like a massive
965.90s:  repricing. Obviously, new information did come out to some degree, but I don't know what.
971.26s:  Any thoughts? I don't know. So I don't know. All right. If you look at it as a time series,
976.22s:  you see when they cut that probability dropped real low, right? Like just a couple percent.
983.90s:  Let me grab my screen and then I'll share it so that yeah, people can follow along with us.
993.82s:  All right.
999.90s:  Let's do portion.
1006.38s:  Yeah. So look how it fell pretty hard when the market was certain. There was another cut coming.
1019.18s:  And then and that was August 5th by August 19th. It's back. It's up to 60% that there would be no cut.
1028.86s:  See that right here. And then it starts falling again and now bounces. I don't know. Is it a dead cat
1039.34s:  bounce? Is someone to someone know something? I don't know. Like, you know, it's it's back to where it was.
1049.42s:  You know, yeah, literally in.
1051.26s:  Less than a month ago. Oh, but also like February.
1055.82s:  Right. So yeah. So it's back to where it was in February. It's also back to where it was
1060.70s:  less than just a couple weeks ago. Yeah.
1064.54s:  So I don't I mean, I don't know. It's
1069.58s:  it feels like there was a lot of certainty. It's like oscillating between certainty and uncertainty.
1077.26s:  And I you know, there are probably just two ways that this goes. One, this is sort of just normal
1083.18s:  noise. And it's bouncing around. Or two, judging by this sudden open interest in near term,
1092.62s:  very high VIX calls. I mean, that's, you know, the 45 calls. That's pretty far out of the money,
1098.46s:  right? But that's those print. Which is units. What's that? This is somebody trying to build units.
1106.94s:  Yeah, I mean, those those those trades would print if there was like an upside surprise on the
1113.42s:  inflation number. Well, I think the other great point, by the way, which interesting, like really
1122.06s:  interesting reading between the lines, because who knows, right? Now, one of the things that we can
1128.94s:  is we could take a peek at those VIX calls and we can see what the build out has looked like.
1135.90s:  So let, let me pull this down super fast for this tool. And then we can take a look at this
1142.62s:  together, because I like now you kind of have me pretty curious. Okay, here we go.
1153.58s:  So we can look at what the build out in VIX is looked like.
1158.94s:  And then let's just look at today. And then I need to get rid of some of these fields.
1170.94s:  Okay. So right now I'm sorting this by premium.
1178.22s:  So here's 16 oct. I'm only going to look at the 16 oct,
1182.78s:  which is what next Wednesday.
1191.98s:  So this, I mean, there's massive build out. Yeah, all across it. Literally everything 1921.
1202.46s:  And these are people that are buying those calls. Yeah, I mean, they didn't pay a ton, right? But
1206.54s:  that's it's pretty far out of the money. Well, for the 40 and that's the whole play for the 45.
1211.34s:  So for those that are like not super familiar, why that would go so far out of the money.
1215.82s:  It's not always because they're expecting the stock or in this case VIX to hit 45. But it's
1222.14s:  because we like you call it like building units. You can put on way more of those. And then you
1228.46s:  just essentially play gamma. But you only do that when you're expecting a big move. Or if you're
1235.74s:  hedging something very specifically that you need that kind of offset. But this doesn't look like
1241.66s:  what's hard to say. It's, I mean, it's impossible to say what the portfolio looks like for the people
1246.94s:  that are building out these 45s. But take a look at it. I mean, for, and these are essentially
1252.14s:  same exact time. So 4000 there, 3000 there, 3000 3000. So somebody is,
1261.34s:  somebody's definitely building out. I mean, you know, think about it. And the other thing to think
1265.26s:  about is that these are so far out of the money and so short term that it's highly likely
1272.14s:  that they expire worthless, right? Unless, unless either it's a hedge, in which case,
1277.26s:  doesn't matter if they expire worthless because that means that the trade you put on is doing okay.
1283.26s:  Or someone knows something. This is how you would look if you were insider trading.
1289.90s:  So let's, this is why you're never supposed to insider trade like this because the SEC is
1294.94s:  watching for these things. Exactly. And it sticks out like I literally had all different kinds of
1302.06s:  trade alerts literally designed. That's how I saw the ones I saw versus what you saw. Which is
1307.34s:  because there was higher volume in them today. But it's exactly that. You just look for stuff.
1312.86s:  Volume is weird compared to OI and you're like, huh, something's going on here. Right.
1318.14s:  Well, let's take a quick look at this really fast. I just want to see the probabilities,
1323.18s:  which we can use this for. So if we pop into analyze, go to probabilities. So those are the 16
1331.98s:  oct, which is super close. Let's check out the probability of a touch. This is using one standard
1337.98s:  deviation move. The probability of getting to the Fort Lecloifs. Right. Exactly. Hold on.
1344.94s:  So it's less than it's less. Yeah, it's literally sub point 1%. Yeah. It's straight up off the scale.
1354.22s:  I'd have to zoom in. Yeah. So, so you know, in most situations, all you're simply doing is
1361.42s:  handing money over to the call, the call writer in this situation. Look at this. Zero.
1367.50s:  And it doesn't even register. It literally needs a third decimal. Yeah.
1371.66s:  So paying almost any money for it is surprising. Is very surprising.
1377.98s:  And yet there's a pretty significant build out there. Yeah. What was that? What do we look at?
1386.38s:  We just looked at like $365,000 or $465,000 trades in that. Yeah, I can tell you real quick.
1394.06s:  In the 45s, I see 65, 55, 49, 48, 24, 24, 16. So yeah, tons.
1410.22s:  Almost 300 grand there. That you just listen. Yeah. Yeah. Easy. That's not nothing.
1416.14s:  It's not nothing. Now, I have to be honest with you, my perception of like big trades has gotten so
1421.98s:  lucked up ever since I started looking at the game stop stuff more in depth. I've gotten way
1427.02s:  into the weeds on that. And you realize that the cat is just wheeling and dealing multi-million
1433.42s:  dollar lots and hidden. It's just my perception of reality is completely. For sure. But those are
1441.26s:  like, you know, generally speaking, those are trades where he's they're in the money or, you know,
1447.66s:  slightly out of the money or it's an underlying stock. Like you're actually getting something of
1451.90s:  value for those trades, whereas someone throwing 300 on something that has a 0% chance of being
1457.74s:  worth something. Yeah. You know, that's yeah. Yeah. That's somewhat more unusual. And it's very to
1464.30s:  your point. It's very indicative of something. Now, with something like the cat, the way we
1468.14s:  interpret his trades is completely different. I don't know if you know this, but I literally
1470.94s:  started a series on Saturday. I do a live stream. And we went through his Reddit profile. We went
1476.86s:  to the very first post. Oh, yeah. No way. You constructed every single trade. And we're like,
1483.02s:  going post by post. So I think we're on like episode like six or seven now. But we're like just
1488.86s:  getting into the 2024 stuff. And I've learned a lot of fascinating things about the way that he does
1493.98s:  stuff. Actually, that would be fun. Let me just realize like there's not too many people that I talk
1499.10s:  to that are from at least like generally familiar with options markets. And I forget that you know
1504.70s:  more about them than I do. So definitely I want to show you. Okay. Probably. But let me know
1511.66s:  is a where's that anchor man meme? I don't believe you. Let me show you this because I'm actually
1519.66s:  really curious. Some of the things that I saw not even analyzing the cat, but just like a general
1525.98s:  analysis of the methodology is interesting to me. And I'm very curious what your opinion is.
1531.74s:  So here I have to zoom out. I'm just going to give you a verbal overview and then we can look at
1537.10s:  specifics just because it's this is like my workbook as you can tell it's labeled workbook. And so
1544.14s:  nothing in here is formatted nice. This is all just a bunch of bullshit that's cobbled together so
1548.78s:  I can see information. That's it. So the entire genesis of doing this was not to efficiently go
1557.02s:  through all of his old trades, but it was actually to like for me to physically see them go to the
1562.94s:  chart, see what it looked like at the time, right? To like really build a relationship with what
1567.34s:  it looked like was going on. And there's a couple things that I found really fascinating. The first
1571.82s:  thing is I found when analyzing all of his old options trades a really strange tendency. It was
1581.90s:  almost binary where trades were exited shockingly pretty early or shockingly very late. The majority
1593.18s:  fall into the very late category. So for example, one of the ones that I haven't been able to put my
1599.50s:  finger on and I don't understand is these sets of trades here. So GameStop here was trading around
1608.22s:  like $369 I think. And he had 15 Jan 2021 and this is 25 now. He had 15 Jan 2021. He had 17 calls
1621.82s:  that he sold, but he kept the 20s, 15s and 10s. Long story short, as I go through a lot of these,
1630.22s:  one of the things that I noticed that I couldn't comprehend is when he was coming up on expiration,
1636.78s:  he would sell the in the money options that are deep in the money and he would leave that out
1643.74s:  of the money options on that are doing like two weeks. To me, I would almost do the opposite,
1653.74s:  especially if the out of the money's are showing a profit because obviously they're going to get
1658.30s:  ready to decay away. So my best analysis of that was if you expect a bigger move, maybe because you
1665.90s:  have a bigger position in those out of the money's compared to the in the money's. That doesn't apply.
1671.58s:  Same size. It was a thousand lot, thousand lot. You actually have a higher delta in the money. You
1676.54s:  would actually make a gross better amount of money by keeping the in the monies. So I don't understand
1683.82s:  that. Keeps me up at night. These are the things that you think about at 3 a.m. when you wait.
1692.94s:  These are the things that you think about at 3 a.m. when you wait. These are the things that you don't
1694.78s:  have kids right there. It's that and it's because I have this fucked up obsessive personality.
1702.38s:  And one of the things that I find so infatuating about the cat is as I look at his stuff,
1707.58s:  there are so many departures from like what we would consider optimal money making logic right.
1713.82s:  Like another thing I can tell you definitively is that dude doesn't use stops. The other thing I
1717.82s:  can tell you definitively is that dude doesn't have profit targets because he has portfolio volatility.
1722.78s:  That's 100% over the course of two weeks right. So it's like as I look at that. It's just anomalies.
1729.10s:  It's like you have a position that's up 40 million dollars. You don't put a stop and you just
1734.54s:  just just just just go. So so so um take it from the perspective of him not being I mean I you
1746.14s:  know it doesn't call himself a trader right. He calls himself an investor. He used to he changed.
1753.58s:  So if you watch his more recent live streams I actually started going back. I don't know if I
1758.78s:  mentioned this you boys obsessive. So I started listening to all of his live streams. I started
1765.90s:  from the very first one and I've been going through all of them and they're like four or five
1769.90s:  hours long. So I do it at like two and a half times speed and I just like locked in trying to
1775.34s:  listen to it. It's very but if you focus hard enough it's there. And long story short I agree with
1782.70s:  you like he's definitely even the way that he structures his trades. It's not a trader at all.
1787.50s:  And I think your analysis on the investor component is very true. The interesting part is that
1793.66s:  a lot of the trades that he started putting on later are trader style trades. They're not leaps.
1800.86s:  They're not even out six months. Some of them right. Some of them are later. Yeah. So so like in
1805.58s:  coming back you mean um no even towards saying even before it yeah so even in this period here
1812.46s:  he started coming out with much shorter term options than I would have expected.
1817.26s:  Okay. Which I thought was fascinating. But again overall completely grew with you in in terms of
1822.62s:  because that's the only explanation I have right. An investor believes that something is going to go
1827.34s:  up right. So then if you just hold while it's going up and that's been very very much what I
1833.42s:  could see from him. And think about your cost basis right your cost basis when I say leverage I'm
1838.46s:  thinking more that you know your cost basis on the out of the money is way lower. Yeah yeah.
1843.66s:  Then on then on the in the money is right. And so if you are if you have that investor mindset
1849.50s:  and you think that it you know you're looking at something going up into the right you know 50 days
1855.42s:  to expiration you are very well convinced that it's going to be worth more over the coming weeks.
1864.14s:  And if you and if you need if you want to close something out and raise it for another trade maybe
1871.26s:  you're going to sell the thing with lower profits. But who are more gross right. And then you're
1883.66s:  going to leave the thing on that you paid less for because you think that's going to be worth more
1887.58s:  later on. The tricky part here is he didn't change anything. So he didn't add anything to the
1895.18s:  position from here. He actually sold the others that fell in the money. Right. But we don't this is
1901.18s:  all also part of the problem. Like we don't know what his whole portfolio looks like. Right like the
1905.82s:  multi portfolio thing. Yep. And I and I grew with that. But it gets more interesting last one and
1911.18s:  then I'll I'll move on with my infatuation here. This one. He took down the in the monies again
1921.34s:  he kept the out of the monies that are now 10 DTE. That's I mean also remember he comes from Wall Street
1932.06s:  bets. Like that's a D Gen move right there right. It's nuts. You can't forget where he comes from.
1942.46s:  Not. I just you're looking for logic in Wall Street bets. I and the funny thing is that that's
1951.50s:  actually been one of the biggest things I've learned as I'm like looking more at this stuff is like
1955.90s:  I have to remember because one of the things that I also picked up very definitively is that early on
1962.38s:  he said you know like this is his yolo yolo update right that's what went on Wall Street bets.
1968.38s:  And I looked at the live streams for his portfolio at the time when he posted the yolo update.
1974.54s:  And the portfolio that he had in the live stream had a bunch of stuff in it on the names.
1981.10s:  The post in Wall Street bets was in account with just game stop.
1985.58s:  Right. So to your point because I also think that's a big part of how he maintained his risk tolerance
1991.18s:  in here is because if you view the money and there is gone and you turn 100,000 into 200 million
1997.42s:  which is still exactly right. And you kind of pull out what you want because I did track
2004.06s:  every single cash change in the account like on a total variance delta. So like I looked at
2008.94s:  the total portfolio value changes and stuff but the one of the questions I had for you when I was
2015.98s:  looking at this stuff because I was actually talking to a buddy of mine that was a market maker
2018.94s:  yesterday. He used to make options markets. And I ask everybody that I know that was in that
2024.38s:  business two degree this question. So I'm super curious. When you see these kinds of orders coming
2030.94s:  in from a market making perspective. Right. So let's say his latest position where he's building into
2038.30s:  you know multiple hits two mill plus size. And it's over the course of a few days from a market
2044.70s:  making perspective. You see that. What's the what's the internalization? Are you trying to front run
2050.14s:  and like move with that order thinking it's informed? Like what's the like what is it? Oh yeah. I
2055.58s:  mean I think you're looking at it as highly informed highly toxic order right like this is an order
2060.62s:  that you are your risk as a market maker is really significant. Now there are multiple options
2070.62s:  market makers. And so first you know you are likely getting hit and backing away. And so then
2077.10s:  the next ones the one that's taking on that next chunk and then back spread it out. Yeah so it
2081.58s:  does get spread out. It's not like it all gets concentrated at one firm. And I mean you know you're
2088.78s:  you're talking about GameStop which is a very liquid stock right like they're it trades and so it's not
2096.94s:  it's not crazy to be hedging and you know to be delta hedging and to to increase that hedge
2105.66s:  over time like you don't have to hedge the whole thing. And you're probably earning some really fat
2110.62s:  premiums on it right like you're he's paying for that. And yes. And and you know that's the
2117.82s:  that's the thing especially with like GameStop options is they are they are just priced. Yes.
2125.82s:  I mean the premiums are crazy right and and people pay them constantly it's it's like a money
2129.98s:  printing machine for market makers until you know until it isn't of course and they're you know
2137.34s:  there have been times where it's going crazy and that's really screwed over some firms.
2143.50s:  Even on the equity side where that if that flow becomes completely one side at all of the
2148.46s:  sudden and that thing you know it starts to go parabolic like that is a destructive force but
2153.34s:  you know the outside of those you know just handful of times that that's happened it's just a
2158.78s:  money printer really right and do you know hedging that is I don't think is that is that hard.
2165.58s:  Well especially now because I think one of the prior arguments is that they I didn't realize
2169.90s:  that we're going to start talking about I love this is great. GameStop now. One of the things that I
2175.98s:  didn't fully understand though is there's a this big perception in the community the like
2182.46s:  ape community I'm like I try to understand like what they're seeing because they they find a lot
2186.78s:  of fascinating information and I find it falls into two I find that it falls into two buckets.
2191.90s:  Some of it is like this really loosely connected 10 foil stuff and then other things there's
2198.46s:  almost like a direct connection it seems and one of the theories that they had essentially was
2203.90s:  that some of the market makers were under hedging which well your compatriots like to do that from
2210.86s:  time to time because you all be fucking greedy and when something like GameStop though is trading
2218.54s:  I have to imagine especially after 2021 they're biting the bullet and just hedging
2224.06s:  is that probably a fair guess or no I think that's a very fair guess yeah especially on the option
2229.82s:  side 100% you know like there's just there's too much intense idiosyncratic risk in this name
2238.38s:  they I don't think they take big risk and and there's no reason for them too because of the premiums
2243.90s:  are so high right like they're they're making so much money on it they're hedging that as soon as they can
2249.10s:  got it and then do you think that like this systemic risk in something like GameStop has changed
2255.82s:  with the new share offerings from a market making perspective gamma squeeze perspective not from
2259.82s:  all the other stuff uh yes I mean I think that um those like from a company perspective I think
2272.38s:  have been an excellent idea and sure you know it gives them sustainability sustainability a
2278.70s:  war chest um they can weather anything at this point like they're not going out of business right
2283.42s:  the the short thesis from a bankruptcy perspective has been taken off the table that being said like
2289.66s:  you know there's still a short thesis that the company's overvalued but it's not gonna it's never
2294.38s:  it's not gonna go to zero and so that's done and so if you're a short seller and your game is
2299.74s:  trying to identify companies that are going to go out to business and short them until they're
2303.50s:  delisted that this is no longer that situation um but yeah I mean there's just a huge new supply of
2310.70s:  shares um and likely many were sold to folks with short positions so you know I I think that
2317.82s:  yeah I I think that it it's hard to argue the actions from a corporate perspective but if you're
2325.10s:  working at if you're looking at it from a short squeeze perspective yeah it's it probably just
2329.74s:  the wind out of the sales yeah um sure another question for you from just a market making perspective
2337.10s:  one of the interesting things that we see with something like GameStop is the out of the money
2342.30s:  options as far as you can go you get hammered but that's system yeah that's what I mean that
2349.58s:  there it's market makers print money on that so my question though is I don't think it's market
2356.78s:  makers obviously establishing positions there my best guess is that some sort of hedge fund or
2362.38s:  some sort of institutional position like just building units is but I don't know if that's right
2367.26s:  that's just my best guess oh no no no I mean you think they're their institutional
2374.14s:  buys of those crazy out of the money options I think I I think I retail the problem with that is
2379.66s:  I some of the side and I agree with you I haven't looked at the tape so I don't yeah I don't know
2384.22s:  what size because I was going to say some of the size doesn't read that to me in terms of retail
2390.94s:  because like you'll see the the 125s or something like that going off for like hundreds of
2395.98s:  thousand sometimes and I just sure there's some retail that can squeeze that out but like you
2400.54s:  can't do that that consistently and I mean it to me what that sounds like so it I mean that sounds
2407.50s:  like a tail risk that's exactly my guess yeah yeah exactly I mean you know that these guys who are
2415.82s:  always losing money on out of the money options just don't know and you know they make their whole
2421.74s:  year in a day kind of thing pretty sick tough business but I mean there's a there's a great book
2430.70s:  Chaos Kings by Scott Patterson did you read that okay so you know like universal that's like that's
2436.14s:  their that's kind of their model right is they're just they're buying the things nobody wants
2441.26s:  and then they're selling it back to them when everyone wants them yeah yeah and they're just yeah
2447.02s:  this long so you can stay a business long enough exactly you know those kind of models are
2452.22s:  really interesting to me when when you look at the evolution of market making in general specifically
2459.02s:  with where computing is going artificial intelligence I'm not sure how impactful it's going to be
2464.70s:  as compared to like overall computing capability but what do you think market making looks like
2469.74s:  over the next decade oh that's super interesting I mean I I think that crypto with like the AMM
2479.34s:  system I think that that's a you that that's like one of the first sort of unique uniquely innovative
2487.10s:  steps forward since like the advent of high frequency trading I think and it almost like
2493.90s:  democratizes market making in a way and it's still not quite there because there are probably
2502.22s:  you know like it's hard it's hard to actually make money doing that if you don't really understand
2507.66s:  like it's still not the kind of thing where you can make you know gobs of money without knowing
2512.22s:  anything but to me like that level of automation is is something that I think we should get to
2520.54s:  that like this shouldn't be a small group of firms that controls markets which is what we have
2527.34s:  today and it would be best for markets in general if it was far more fragmented and diverse.
2535.42s:  Don't you think don't you think if computing power and stuff like that using that is
2543.02s:  an underlying assumption don't know you know how how impactful or which way that's going to go
2547.26s:  but wouldn't you wager that if computing power becomes an increasingly important component to
2553.66s:  market making wouldn't that further centralize market making. Well that's what that's what has happened.
2559.82s:  I mean computing and data you know data analysis capabilities is everything like if you look at
2567.82s:  there's a there's a firm it's less well known in the US because they're they're much bigger overseas
2572.54s:  but they're called XTX and I think they have one of like the world's largest super computers like for
2581.02s:  AI like their GPU farm is like one of the top in the world because like that's what and they're
2587.74s:  that's all they do is market making that's it and you know that's been the case for a long time
2593.02s:  I mean since I've been involved in markets in 2005 you know the ability to crunch data
2605.02s:  faster than the next guy and to crunch a lot of it has that's where edge has come from and
2614.06s:  you know I think that has led to concentration in the market that's that's where we're at today I
2620.70s:  think and so I I hope that we get past that like they they have to come a time where that kind of
2627.98s:  computing power is sort of readily and freely available it's sort of like an AMM type system where
2634.46s:  you know everything kind of gets built into these automated contracts and anyone can kind of put
2639.74s:  money into the contract which is managing markets and liquidity and earn money off of that that to
2647.26s:  me is a it's where market making becomes complete utility rather than something that's just a handful
2654.30s:  of firms you know can control markets with I see that's fascinating yeah because when I originally
2660.14s:  think about it I think of it as right now to your point to get more computing it's super resource
2666.30s:  intensive but exactly if it starts to become more readily available that could be a pretty significant
2670.54s:  flat-nour yeah when when you look at the job of market making one of the things I noticed when I
2678.54s:  talked to different people in different communities they have different perceptions a lot of people
2683.74s:  view them as like the boogie man you know that they're out there just trying to fuck everybody which
2689.02s:  I mean to be honest I wouldn't run it by I'm I mean you know there's a thin line between I want to
2696.14s:  make as much money for myself as possible and I'm going to fuck everybody right so going off that
2703.90s:  if they wanted to fuck everybody in the current structure as it sits now what are some of the ways
2709.34s:  you think they could do that um I think when you look in in some names especially the concentration
2720.30s:  in one or two firms is staggering and these firms control the price of those stocks completely control
2727.26s:  it so you know they can do what they want with those stocks and they do so one of the things that
2734.94s:  that Irvin does is we look for market manipulation and we work with public companies to help them
2739.74s:  identify market manipulation and you know I can tell you it's it's all over the place
2747.26s:  um it's 10 Ken is a great guy he's just he's just trying to get by I am not accusing any specific
2754.86s:  firm of anything nefarious at all well I'm talking in generalities I'll be super specific
2763.90s:  I I'm talking perfectly generally that you know if you look at especially in smaller names where
2771.02s:  there's not a lot of volume and there's not a lot of size posted they do whatever they do whatever
2777.18s:  they want um even better if these names it's these stocks are like listed in multiple markets
2784.14s:  and there's one market is less liquid than the other um you know it's it's it's it's quite easy to
2790.70s:  control the price and you know you want to sell it up here buy it back here sell it up here buy it
2797.18s:  back here you can push it around yeah and so you know I think that um I I think market makers have
2806.94s:  learned that there is sort of a base level of manipulation that they can engage in and where they can
2817.82s:  withstand regulatory scrutiny because they can overpower the regulators with
2824.38s:  intellect and data and complexity um and you know nobody everyone's happy because markets continue
2834.46s:  to function do you think that some of that's an artifact of like the north star right now is
2839.98s:  very much like liquidity focused yes I think absolutely yeah liquidity is everything
2847.58s:  um if you look at our podcasts with um with John well-born uh we did a couple of them uh he's a
2856.70s:  professor Dartmouth and this is sort of like you know his point is that's the root of all evil like
2862.62s:  all the SEC cares about is liquidity nothing else matters that's why market makers have this
2866.86s:  this short sale exemption and they don't have to locate shares and such it's all in the name of
2870.94s:  liquidity and if you like I always used to say that continuous continuous trading is the root of
2876.54s:  all evil but you know it's not quite true um but it's like they go hand in hand right for
2881.66s:  for continuous trading you need liquidity and you need it continuously um whereas if you switched
2888.38s:  to something like periodic or frequent batch auctions um you can concentrate liquidity and you can
2895.10s:  you can concentrate you know real liquidity rather than you know this sort of phantom liquidity
2902.14s:  where where they're just printing shares and so you know I think to me that that's a better
2907.82s:  market structure but it doesn't really matter because we're kind of stuck in this continuous model
2912.78s:  and nothing's going to break us out of that what do you think what why is that right so like if you
2918.22s:  offer that alternative and from a theoretical perspective it generally sounds like that's better
2923.74s:  price discovery like that's what that sounds like to me like real orders you think it's worth this
2927.82s:  I think it's worth this let's exhaust those orders and then whatever the price is is what it is
2932.94s:  so from like a layperson's perspective that that sounds completely logical and reasonable so then
2940.46s:  why not that too many people make too much money with the current system
2946.06s:  as is usually the problem with trying to change it for better you know
2951.26s:  I mean I think if you look at like the work that Eric Boudich has done he's a professor out of
2955.66s:  the University of Chicago and he written a couple papers on frequent batch auctions and why they're
2959.74s:  superior and what the benefits are and he's also talked about in some of those papers like how would
2964.78s:  you introduce that into the current system and it's hard it's it's it's it's not something that
2973.34s:  can probably happen naturally or simply it's something that you know it's sort of there's this
2981.02s:  if you just have like one spot over here where you have these auctions which some they're they are
2985.74s:  offered by certain providers but then you have this entire market over here 99% of which is continuous
2992.30s:  trading it's it's very difficult to attract the liquidity into the auctions so that they really
2999.18s:  start to provide material outcomes that's that's the issue it's it's very much like a prisoner's
3003.90s:  dilemma interesting when you look at a couple more questions before I let you skid that all I know you
3010.62s:  well I mean you probably have like important shit to do but I always enjoy the ability to just
3015.50s:  ask dumb questions for a while but taking this back to GameStop what do you think the manipulation
3025.34s:  pers like prospects are for something like that because GameStop I find is a little bit of an
3030.22s:  anomaly because it's not super liquid it's super volatile it's heavily traded so I think of like
3039.50s:  these different factors that kind of weigh out differently and I try to think of like like how much
3045.34s:  could a market maker manipulate something like that any thoughts yeah I don't know it's it's really
3052.54s:  hard to say I agree with you like when I when I talked about it being liquid earlier it was really
3057.58s:  more strictly from the perspective of like you know an options market maker who needs to hedge
3064.62s:  but you know a lot of the liquidity has been sucked out of the name because of DRS and
3070.30s:  you know a lot of the holders are long-term holders so it's it's kind of a really funky
3076.14s:  and weird situation and you know I think any anytime something doesn't trade a lot
3085.26s:  it can be manipulated more easily than something it does obviously right um
3091.66s:  but you know there are so many eyes on it seems like there's more risk in doing that
3097.42s:  at the same time you know like there's a lot of money involved as well right I look at stuff like
3103.10s:  even the base stock volume though right so right now there's what for well think your swim is tell me
3108.14s:  446 thousand or 446 million shares I don't know if that's accurate or not but just taking that
3114.38s:  at face value that's the audience shares yeah yeah yeah yeah but it just changed dramatically
3120.70s:  because of you know these that that's markets yeah yeah because then I look at the volumes today
3126.94s:  it's 4.8 million call it so as a percentage of outstanding that's like a decent amount of volume
3134.22s:  like that's still relatively heavily traded on a percentage basis even if you compare it to
3139.10s:  something like Apple I actually think this is more heavily traded than something like Apple yeah um
3145.58s:  I don't know man it's it's like it's a yeah game stop is such a weird situation it's hard I find it
3154.62s:  hard to understand like the trading dynamics price movements seem crazy to me it's it's it's
3160.62s:  frequently you know gapping but but there seems like no rhyme or reason to it not much you know it's
3168.54s:  yeah I don't know yeah bit of an anomaly yeah I was wondering if there was like some sort of
3173.66s:  factor analysis or like manipulation I because I was trying to I was actually trying to look for
3179.66s:  papers on that to see if I could find anything and no luck so far are you familiar with anything like that
3185.98s:  um I'm trying to think I'm not I know that there was some work done some academic work done
3196.46s:  after the SEC's analysis came out of the 2021 trading that analysis was a fucking joke
3203.98s:  yeah I thought that that was a straight joke
3209.90s:  um yeah and that's what this you know the academics came together and they said we disagree with
3216.22s:  you SEC that this was not again misquease and and you know I thought it was pretty it was pretty
3224.06s:  good paper got um so I would take a look at that but it's you know at this point also it's also
3229.42s:  very dated got it yeah because I'm always trying to find you know just stuff that to try to like
3235.90s:  quantify and qualify some of these things because I think one of the things that I try to do especially
3240.62s:  for like the ape side of the house is because I think so many of them are so used to being deceived
3246.78s:  lied to and then everything gets written off as manipulation yeah so then it's like and I I understand
3253.82s:  that perspective but I also think that leads to like going too far and thinking like everything is
3259.90s:  fucked so I try to find stuff like that if I you know I'll keep looking and if I do find anything I'll
3265.26s:  let you know but what one of my hopes is to be yeah to be able to find something related to that and
3270.14s:  see like if there's been a decent analysis done yeah I've not seen any of that yeah no um cool last
3279.34s:  question before you wrap any new exciting up and coming from Irvin or from just stuff you're working
3285.50s:  on yeah I mean Irvin is doing some interesting things and I I encourage you all to go check out
3292.54s:  Irvin.finance and and join the conversation there you know it's it's there's some good good
3298.46s:  investment ideas on the platform people doing research it's neat to see a big part of what we're
3303.02s:  focusing on is connecting public companies to their investors but as I told you before we started
3309.34s:  this today it became public that we the investors are our advocacy effort and Irvin have sued the SEC
3317.98s:  over the the final reg NMS rule that was adopted a couple weeks ago so I can't really say much at
3327.34s:  at this juncture on it but I've never sued the SEC before so it'll be a learning experience
3333.98s:  for everybody it's gonna be a learning experience yeah super interesting one question on that
3339.98s:  and again if you can't answer obviously shut it down but I'm curious like what what was the thought
3345.18s:  press is leading into that like obviously there's a culmination point right where there's something
3349.82s:  happens something happens something happens and then at some point there's uh okay fuck this we
3355.66s:  need to do something what was like that culmination point yeah um right I again I'm not sure
3365.74s:  what I can say at this point but you know what I what I I had high hopes for what the SEC was going
3373.74s:  to do in this rulemaking and um I think they did a lot of good with it too I don't this isn't
3382.30s:  sort of something to say that this is trash because it's not I just think that um it fell short
3388.78s:  miss some of the stuff yeah and um it's you sort of get to the point where you're like what else can
3395.66s:  I do right we we have we we spent time talking to them people sent letters you know by the thousands
3405.02s:  um and and you get to the point where okay you've you've tried you've exhausted every avenue you've
3414.06s:  tried everything you can and there's sort of only one one action left to take at that point really
3420.54s:  yeah totally fair and the the reason why I asked that question is just because I want to highlight
3425.50s:  the fact that like you you took action right because lots of people will gripe complain be disenfranchised
3433.90s:  and that's something that we the investors has continued to do right is to take action and there's
3439.26s:  not a lot of places that we see that happening so obviously I'm always a huge supporter of that
3445.02s:  that community the movement but also like genuinely like thank you for taking the time to do that
3450.30s:  because it is a little bit thankless I'm sure you get no shortish apprentices from everybody
3454.70s:  because that's the nature of doing anything from everyone yeah because I still give you shit too
3460.30s:  because wagyu is garbage and there's there is no other way around it there's no other way around it
3468.54s:  insanity but it takes a lot of effort to do stuff like that and it takes time money resources so
3476.54s:  yeah it's super cool that you end the rest of we the investors continue to to beat that
3481.34s:  drum because otherwise yeah you just kind of look at it and you're like damn the sucks and then
3485.90s:  nothing happens so yeah I think it's easy to get for people to get dismayed and to pull back
3492.54s:  and to say there's you know there's nothing we can do and that's what they want right that's
3498.30s:  that's what they're hoping for so you know I think that maybe people wanted us to do this sooner and
3509.42s:  you know I I never really saw I know I would never if you would talk to me
3513.82s:  very recently I wouldn't have said this is anything that we would do but but you know you you get
3520.30s:  to the point where you have you have taken every action you think you should at every step of the
3524.86s:  way right you've done the you know as much as you think you could do each time and and it doesn't
3531.50s:  work and so you can do one you can throw your hands up or you can find the next thing to do and
3536.46s:  you know I tend to be just someone who looks for the next thing to do I I'm I'm kind of an
3540.62s:  eternal optimist in that way which is the only way you sort of stay in the reform game after
3545.26s:  many years because it's a maddening process yeah yeah well the last thing to note on that is something
3551.50s:  I always try to remind people because you do a good job at this but I think a lot of people miss
3555.42s:  the bubble on it is that obviously you're you're playing a deep game here right a lot of people they
3560.70s:  want to they want change they want to see it now and then if it doesn't happen the next three
3565.10s:  months it's like oh god you know this is all for not but the the game that you're playing is such a
3570.54s:  game of delayed gratification yeah that's not that's right it's not easy that's not easy to to run it
3576.46s:  that way but it's working with systems like this it's the only way yeah for sure I mean that's
3582.30s:  exactly the point right like no change happens like on that time scale not that I've ever seen at
3586.62s:  least not any you know foundational material change and I know people get frustrated that it didn't
3592.22s:  happen you know in a matter of days but I can tell you I've been trying to push for these changes
3598.38s:  for many years now and they still haven't happened despite I think being quite obviously the right
3604.86s:  thing to do and so we'll continue to figure out every every which way we can to get to you know
3611.82s:  improve markets improve competition and make sure that markets are accurately reflecting supply
3616.70s:  and demand which you know is the their fundamental purpose and something that I don't think they do
3621.90s:  a good job of in a lot of situations right now well it's always good to talk to an eternal optimist
3630.86s:  the thank you so much for coming to hang out for a little bit I always get a chance to learn a
3635.10s:  lot from you and I hope that the audience does as well I'll throw links to Irvin and all your stuff
3640.54s:  below but yeah thanks right here now to upgrade to see you thanks for having me here always fun yeah
