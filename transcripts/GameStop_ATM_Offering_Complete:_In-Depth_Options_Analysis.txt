0.72s: boom we're back what's up outliers today
3.20s: we're talking about GameStop because we
5.00s: have some pretty exciting news as I
7.68s: imagine most have seen already which is
10.96s: this right here so the at the market
15.32s: Equity offer is now complete this is as
18.16s: of today 23 September and we can see
20.88s: exactly what happened here it says it
24.04s: filed a prospectus supplement with the
27.00s: SEC to offer to sell up to a maximum of
30.32s: 20 million shares for the at the market
35.12s: offering and it says the aggregate gross
38.92s: proceeds are approximately
41.04s: 400 Mill so what's going on here take a
45.52s: look at
47.72s: this GameStop intends to use the net
50.24s: proceeds from the ATM program for
51.96s: General Corporate purposes which may
54.08s: include Acquisitions and Investments I
57.56s: think this is mostly what we've been
60.08s: expecting to see and hear and I know
62.36s: that this isn't necessarily Earth
64.40s: shattering this line here but they also
66.96s: didn't have to include this and the fact
69.12s: that they did I think that's important
71.48s: to note because it's telling us pretty
73.64s: clearly that they're starting to message
75.68s: there's something going on with this
76.84s: money as we know because for a company
79.64s: to just raise money to just have money
82.72s: in the bank it doesn't actually make
84.64s: sense and this is something that we've
85.96s: talked about before because a lot of
87.96s: people will say like oh they're just
89.12s: earning really good interest on the cash
90.88s: that's sitting there interest is fine on
93.56s: large sums of money but again it's a
95.28s: drop in the bucket compared to a
96.76s: business doing what a business does
98.84s: which is sales revenue it's going to way
102.40s: better than 5% that they're going to get
104.48s: on their money so they're not just you
106.24s: know applying like a standard um
109.24s: individual Trader or investor mindset of
111.72s: let me just get a good yield and then
113.56s: that'll be good enough that's obviously
115.28s: not the case at all they're going to do
116.80s: something with this money it's the only
118.24s: reason why you raise it now what that is
120.96s: we don't know still but I actually
123.64s: really really like that they include
126.20s: this because this also builds off of
127.96s: what we recently saw back in
131.16s: August where they filed this 8K that
134.72s: essentially saw them cutting ties with
137.20s: creditors so this starts to unlock their
140.20s: ability to do things like m&a
142.80s: Investments depending on you know what
144.80s: form this all takes it enables them to
147.44s: do that unencumbered they don't owe
149.96s: anybody anything they're able to move
152.04s: autonomously so what I'm seeing here is
155.64s: a breadcrumb trail and it's starting to
158.92s: piece together now what it turns into
161.56s: again I have no idea I'm very eager to
163.76s: find out also still nobody has told me
166.72s: what this is up here I like some video
169.08s: games I'm not like a huge gamer and I
170.76s: don't know what this is is this just
172.12s: like a fantasy drawing or is this
174.04s: actually from like a video game or
175.16s: something and if so please tell me which
176.52s: one cuz every time I see it it's on a
178.68s: bunch of these I just don't know which
179.64s: it is
180.44s: is also everybody listening to this with
183.36s: earphones on you owe me a huge favor
185.80s: that I have cat-like reflexes cuz I just
187.88s: caught myself in the biggest sneeze on
189.52s: planet Earth and was able to pause the
191.68s: recording fast enough so I didn't blow
193.24s: out all of your eard drums which I'm
194.80s: pretty sure it would have okay so recap
198.40s: ATM done 20 million shares out 400 mil
202.60s: in the bank we have this that I need to
205.68s: know what this is nobody's helped me
207.00s: with that yet and we are now looking
209.12s: forward to the rest of this puzzle to
210.92s: come together in terms of what kind of
213.88s: Acquisitions or Investments this could
217.24s: look like so from my perspective just
221.12s: really exciting stuff and the reason why
222.80s: it's so exciting is because there's
224.12s: opportunities there's so many
225.64s: opportunities that are available here
227.88s: we've seen everything from getting
229.80s: deeper into Collectibles we've been
231.48s: seeing conversations about moving
233.04s: further into the peripheral lines I've
235.04s: been seeing conversations about starting
237.12s: to acquire either synergistic comp are
240.24s: completely different style companies and
242.32s: nobody knows that's kind of the fun part
244.52s: now my guess is GameStop and Ryan Cohen
247.60s: probably has a decent idea of where
249.20s: they're trying to take things at this
250.36s: point I do not think that they're just
252.16s: like oh let's just keep raising money
253.40s: and then we'll see what happens I don't
255.28s: fully see that is the case I'm not
257.20s: saying that they have something lined
258.44s: out uh discreetly but my guess is they
261.76s: have some ideas on where they want to go
263.40s: with this because that that's the other
264.56s: thing is with how much money they have
266.44s: in the bank to add $400 million is
269.40s: actually really interesting to me that's
271.20s: a strategic move I don't know why they
273.32s: pick that but it's not happen stance
275.80s: they're not just like ah you know this
277.20s: will be fun to have another 400 million
279.20s: in the bank I don't think it's that so
282.64s: what this actually is I don't know yet
285.36s: but to me this looks like a series of
287.24s: strategic movements that are leading
288.72s: them towards something to do with this
292.16s: now how does this translate to stock
293.96s: price movement really really well
296.08s: because as you can see after earnings we
299.04s: came down massively big spike in volume
302.40s: and then we can see that daily volume
304.20s: leading into the last couple days I see
307.04s: 92 mil 8 mil 5.9 6.3 10.7
312.92s: 8.9
316.00s: 61.9 so obviously on the 20th and this
319.40s: is we reviewed these orders already
321.16s: there were massive dark poool orders
323.68s: that came through on the 20th and that
326.76s: doesn't surprise me and we can see that
328.36s: we kind of cleaned up today
330.28s: overall volume today was still 13.7
332.44s: million that's high compared to the
334.24s: relative averages so the beautiful part
338.48s: about this is look at the price movement
342.08s: here this is an again example of as soon
346.48s: as overall pressure starts to be
349.32s: relieved GameStop starts to Rally look
351.96s: at these days post earnings really ugly
354.96s: didn't look good didn't like earnings we
357.04s: had a bit of a trail down and then we
358.56s: just have a couple massive spikes
361.16s: following through which is really really
363.64s: cool to see so now a couple other
366.20s: General technical notes I do see RSI
369.92s: sloping above its moving average and I
373.12s: see both of those trending above the 50
375.68s: handle on again the RSI so that's just
378.88s: generally money moving in which again
380.56s: you don't need that to see that that's
382.32s: what's starting to happen here there's a
383.80s: lot of buy volume that's driving this
385.24s: kind of price movement now if we take a
388.32s: look at the options flow and let's take
391.88s: a look at options flow specifically for
396.28s: today and I'm looking at the call side
399.36s: options that have been bought relatively
401.72s: quiet there's nothing that I would
403.92s: consider overly remarkable here if I
406.60s: throw in the bid to see what's been sold
409.04s: a couple more larger trades but still
411.84s: not a lot of remarkable movement at
414.12s: least for today alone again I continue
417.08s: to remind you guys I don't come in here
418.84s: and try to spit everything I see is the
420.88s: most crazy thing on planet Earth I'm a
423.20s: Trader what I try to do is objectively
425.40s: analyze information and again right now
427.64s: that's information I see here it's just
429.12s: relatively quiet it's nothing too crazy
431.36s: now let's take a look at GameStop on the
433.04s: dark poool side of things because I know
435.28s: that this will look a little bit
437.64s: different and we can see today that if I
441.36s: sort this not by time but if I sort this
444.84s: by size we've had a handful of really
448.20s: large trades come through so we're
450.28s: seeing you know things several 10,000s
453.16s: right so
454.04s: 74,000 19,000 20,000 so a bunch of those
457.32s: still that's about the same but here's
460.40s: the thing that we have to look at as per
461.84s: usual is if we look in filter by
464.84s: 5,000 there was a bunch of 5,000 blocks
467.40s: again today so if we take a look at the
470.96s: 20th in
472.92s: isolation a bunch of these 5,000 blocks
476.28s: and again I have to actually add more so
477.84s: that you can see all of them and this is
480.08s: now going back from the 20th so now
484.64s: let's take a look at essentially the
487.32s: last week including today and we can see
491.52s: that what I like tracking is what's the
494.80s: relationship of these blocks and how are
498.36s: they coming in so like the 23rd we can
500.60s: see that there's a bunch of them on the
502.36s: 20th we can see that there's a ton of
503.96s: them literally a ton of them that's all
505.44s: me scrolling through the 20th then I can
507.64s: see on the 18th a few 17th a few 16th
510.24s: less so I can look and see what's the
512.88s: flow of these 5,000 block orders and
515.40s: again it just is interesting to follow
517.20s: along and I want to keep an eye if they
520.28s: continue after this next order flow is
523.76s: done now that GameStop announced it's
525.56s: complete I wonder if that's going to
527.16s: have any impact on these 5,000 blocks
529.36s: that we see I don't know yet now the
532.00s: last thing I want to take a look at with
533.24s: you
534.36s: quickly are the options chains as you
537.00s: know so if we jump in here there's a
539.80s: couple things that jumped out at me the
541.88s: first thing is that volume today was
543.96s: super heavy call side
545.76s: 173,000 calls against 38,000 puts
548.60s: massive call skew most of that
551.08s: transacted at the offer or above meaning
554.04s: these are people buying calls so still
556.48s: generally bullish configuration but the
558.24s: open interest is most interesting to me
560.68s: because we can see that the open
561.80s: interest didn't contract that much that
563.44s: means people from last expiration cuz
565.28s: there was um over 100,000 options that
567.92s: should have expired well did expire
569.48s: Friday that were rolled out into this
572.24s: week and with new positions established
574.32s: but this is the most interesting thing
577.48s: to me so far take a look at where all
580.32s: these big positions are this is the
582.64s: first time truly that I see the front
586.12s: expiration cycle being way less dense
589.88s: than the front the next expiration cycle
592.48s: the next expiration cycle after that
594.20s: until you get to the next primary
595.96s: expiration cycle the the 18 OCT and if
599.52s: you take a look at these kind of these
601.36s: white rectangles those are all 18 OED
604.48s: those are several weeks out but that's
606.84s: where most of the oi is right now that's
609.80s: very cool because that's sticky open
612.24s: interest that's not going to come down
614.32s: every single week with people having a
616.96s: bunch of options expiring worthless so
619.36s: if we take a look at this front
620.48s: expiration cycle there's 103,000 calls
624.08s: in there we take a look at 18 o it's
626.40s: double and a half almost 243,000
629.68s: that's really important because the way
631.92s: that the options have been flowing so
633.20s: far in GameStop have been inverted to
635.40s: that where the front cycle has been the
637.52s: heaviest by far leading to a bunch of
640.00s: turnover that's not what we're seeing
642.52s: here which again I just find it
645.08s: remarkable not remarkable as in
647.08s: unbelievable but worth remarking so
651.12s: that's that the other thing is when I
652.60s: look at the Vall it's come down a lot
655.20s: this has been highly informative for me
657.76s: so I keep a really really close eye on
660.12s: volatility and the volatility surface
662.44s: because it helps me understand Market
664.64s: perception of movements and I typically
666.80s: like this kind of view something like
668.20s: this and we can see a bunch of things
670.84s: now one one of the things I notice with
673.36s: certainty is that we are back again to a
676.20s: generally normal configuration where in
678.44s: general the put side runs higher Vol
681.12s: than the call side I track that because
683.88s: when I see the call side running higher
685.92s: Vol than the put side that's something I
687.64s: typically will trade and it's Al
689.52s: something that tells me something about
691.16s: Market expectations of movement so right
694.20s: now we've kind of reverted back to what
696.68s: I would consider to be more normal so
699.80s: overall right now GameStop is in a
702.60s: really interesting spot in my opinion
705.12s: and I really hope that we start to see
708.56s: more of this puzzle unfolding because
711.64s: price is starting to move a little bit
714.00s: better and I mean right now it looks
716.32s: like we're starting to bump up against
718.68s: some near term resistance here at like
720.64s: the 22 and A2 handle we'll see how that
722.48s: goes but the point of control is still
724.44s: up here at 24 and it would not surprise
727.00s: me now that the suppression of the ATM
729.28s: is completed to see this start to drift
731.56s: back up because it's very clear to me
733.48s: that a lot of this downward pressure was
735.60s: due to that because as soon as that's
737.32s: been generally abated we can see this
739.16s: thing flying so I am really eager to see
742.60s: where we go from here as always if
744.24s: there's anything you want me to take a
745.40s: look at let me know I'll see you at the
746.80s: YouTube live stream later today at 5:00
748.60s: p.m. Pacific time be an outlier I'll see
750.44s: you later
