0.40s: what's up lrs quick market update we are
3.44s: at the Futures open right now it's
5.56s: Sunday afternoon and just want to touch
7.52s: base on two names djt and GameStop and I
10.88s: want to talk quickly about just what the
13.00s: Market's doing and then we'll get into
14.36s: those two stocks so if we run over to
16.80s: the flexible grid we can see that we had
19.56s: overall uh upswing and we can see this
22.40s: across all primary sectors within the
24.84s: S&P 500 we can see just about everything
28.12s: saw some level of appreciation last week
31.24s: however some things really stand out so
33.72s: xli so Industrials financials energy
37.48s: Communications definitely hovering near
39.72s: all-time highs consumer um staples still
44.44s: pretty low still up a little bit but low
47.32s: but yet discretionary all-time highs
49.64s: that's an interesting Divergence between
51.44s: those to me and then we can see
53.16s: technology finally hit three-month highs
56.36s: it's been struggling for some time now
58.60s: and if we pop over CH something like QQQ
61.24s: really fast we can see that it has
63.84s: finally retaken this summer high from
67.56s: about 6 months ago so the market right
70.08s: now Euphoria that's what I see there's
72.04s: going to be a lot of money continuing to
74.60s: move into the market tomorrow is a
76.44s: little bit different just because it's a
77.68s: bank holiday SO trading desks are closed
79.52s: although trading's open normally a
81.52s: little bit lighter volume but we can see
83.56s: Futures on the open tonight they're
85.76s: definitely positive we have e- minis up
88.80s: 0.15 % the Russell which is still
93.04s: probably going to be a a key leader here
95.20s: for a little bit cuz small caps they
97.16s: have a lot of ground to cover if we look
99.36s: at the performance for small caps on the
101.92s: year they're now up
104.96s: 19.42% whereas the S&P 500 is up
108.44s: 26.69 per. so for the longest part of
111.88s: the Year small caps were light years
114.08s: behind and now it looks like they're
115.64s: finally catching up just a little bit
119.32s: now let's take a peek at djt a couple
122.08s: people asked about this what this might
123.72s: look like now that the election is kind
125.28s: of known and this in here has been at
129.68s: least in my opinion completely expected
131.44s: meaning this decline now what has been
134.12s: slightly interesting is we can see the
136.72s: day that the next trading day after we
138.92s: understood that he had won the 6th of
141.04s: November big big big giant Gap up and
144.16s: fully has expected a
147.00s: absolute crash towards the bottom
150.36s: and again A lot of people are using this
152.72s: as an election proxy well now the
154.96s: election output is known and I think
157.52s: that we're going to be in an interesting
159.36s: spot because now we have to see what
162.08s: people actually value DJ Chi at and I
164.96s: mean I've already gotten out of it I've
166.28s: traded it in two different tranches I
168.24s: traded it that box that I just had
170.00s: highlighted I've ran that up through to
172.00s: here and then I had it again from here
174.96s: to here and I exited early on the day of
178.32s: the election just because for me it was
180.20s: almost like an earnings play and the
182.60s: fact that the now unknown is now known
185.24s: that was my play and it happened to work
187.96s: out it could have gone the other way
190.00s: parabolically I still would have gotten
191.44s: out just because that that was what I
193.32s: was trying to gain exposure to now if we
196.04s: take a look at the options chain look at
199.84s: the put oi this is being played to the
202.84s: downside now massively the overwhelming
205.96s: majority of put open or open interest is
208.32s: on the put side we have 875,000 puts
211.16s: against 515,000 calls this is people
213.48s: playing the downside rightfully so I
214.96s: don't blame them the reason why I don't
216.68s: blame them is just because this isn't to
218.72s: say djt can't go up but this whole run
221.84s: was based on something that we now know
224.60s: that still hasn't actually changed the
227.60s: value of the organization yet because
230.32s: especially while Trump is in office
231.80s: obviously his b his brand becomes
233.56s: slightly more um worth but the problem
237.92s: is is that this isn't just based on his
239.96s: personal Brand's worth it's it has to do
244.16s: other things and that's one of the big
246.60s: issues that it's going to run into so if
248.72s: we look at volatility absolutely crazy
251.56s: high volatility 290% down to 260 227 all
255.96s: the way down we can see a little bit of
257.28s: a kink in the volatility smile um it's
261.80s: kind of like a up smile kind of
263.12s: like mine um but the volatility the term
266.08s: structure here we can see it goes from
267.56s: 210 to 197 up to 204 so high low high
273.08s: that's just typically not what you would
275.12s: see there's a lot you you you see this a
277.68s: lot though in stuff like this the other
279.56s: thing is take a look at the call
281.96s: transactions from Friday this is
284.00s: interesting to me take a look at how
286.00s: many of these calls were at the offer or
288.44s: above
289.72s: 38% so I have to be honest that's very
292.60s: striking to me it I would not expect
294.96s: that many calls to be open so this
297.16s: absolutely indicates that some people
298.80s: are expecting a follow through so we'll
300.96s: have to give it another couple days for
302.44s: me I have ideas on what might happen but
304.96s: I always remain based off of what's
306.92s: actually happening and we need another
308.88s: couple days to see how that goes all
310.92s: right now GameStop we talked about this
312.92s: a lot on Saturday during the gme live
315.96s: streams that's every Saturday at 5:00 P
317.44s: p.m. Pacific time but this I just want
320.52s: to touch on because how cool is this we
322.92s: started to see a pretty significant
325.24s: expansion in volume here and it was
328.48s: carried through to here and again going
331.08s: back we've looked through now for 3
334.12s: months all of roaring Kitty's old trades
336.92s: we've been analyzing the price
338.28s: performance of GameStop extensively and
341.16s: not just from like a cursory overview
343.00s: I'm also logging so that I can look at
345.68s: it from a broader quantitative
347.08s: perspective and one of the main things
348.52s: that I can definitively say is before it
350.92s: has these really big parabolic moves we
352.96s: see volume start to expand every single
356.76s: time that does not mean every every
359.92s: single time volume expands GameStop's
361.92s: going to move doesn't mean that but it
363.64s: does mean every time I've seen GameStop
366.16s: move it has had volume that's nothing
368.72s: Earth shattering that's not specific to
370.32s: GameStop but that is really common
373.08s: especially in mover stocks like this
375.68s: that kind of stayed dormant if you go to
377.32s: the 24th 2.6 million volume then it runs
381.20s: to 5.9 essentially doubling and then it
384.20s: goes to 13.64%
389.72s: in my opinion this is a breakout style
392.88s: position that then over the last week
396.04s: got carried through way more than I
398.20s: think a lot of people expected so we saw
400.72s: a pretty reasonable run here from 20 A2
404.24s: up until about 25 so now the question is
408.96s: does it stay up here and maintain its
410.88s: momentum or does it start to capitulate
413.96s: which to me it doesn't look like
416.04s: capitulation the reason why I say that
417.52s: is because I do think 25 is a massive
421.08s: area of resistance and we talked about
422.84s: this again on the live stream the reason
425.44s: for that simply is if we go back far
427.80s: enough you can kind of see a a really
430.84s: clear volume note here in the 2526
433.92s: handle and that indicates and same thing
436.16s: right here that indicates that there's a
437.88s: lot of people that bought in really
440.28s: freaking high above this and they're now
444.36s: excited to have an opportunity to get
446.88s: out so a lot of those people are taking
449.60s: their exit and you can also see that
452.16s: represented if we look at a daily
455.00s: there's no surprise to me that if you
457.36s: take a look at where the sale volume
459.40s: really starts to step in take a look
461.88s: it's in here it's when it's above 25 now
466.16s: some people think that that's the market
467.68s: makers pushing the stock down absolutely
469.88s: can be part of the equation not weighing
471.48s: in on that but what I do know
473.72s: objectively is that it is a ton of
475.96s: people that are getting their first look
478.56s: since essentially
480.80s: October September time frame to get out
484.04s: at break even and my guess is a lot of
486.76s: these people started getting in at
488.28s: astronomically high prices like 53
490.44s: because there are volume nodes way up
492.48s: here they're small but they're there so
494.56s: that means that people very likely
496.32s: averaged into this committing more
498.36s: Capital to the trade wanting to get out
500.56s: because it's too big of a trade and
502.36s: they're taking their exit now the thing
505.60s: that looks encouraging to me is that it
507.88s: didn't go up to just 20 and get slammed
510.72s: all the way down it didn't just tick
513.36s: above 25 it ran a little bit above 25
516.00s: enough sellers started stepping in to
517.64s: press it down but just shy of 25 it's
520.20s: not like $25.99 but it closed at what
523.20s: 2488 so very close so this tells me that
526.96s: the sellers are eager to get out at 25
530.44s: but there's not in Mass which again
533.00s: makes complete sense because if we Zoom
535.24s: back out again we can see that there are
537.32s: volume notes here but this volume note
539.56s: is now becoming the absolute
542.40s: bulk anything from 23 down to 20 so
547.04s: there's a group of people looking to get
549.24s: out a large group of people but there's
550.92s: a larger group of people down here so
553.28s: really interesting overall price
554.92s: behavior I'm really eager to see how it
557.56s: moves this week uh my positions in here
560.44s: always transparent about that I still
562.76s: love shares I have short calls that are
564.32s: now underwater that I'm going to have to
565.88s: manage that's no problem and then I
568.08s: traded this move here so I bought more
571.00s: options a little near dated um than the
575.12s: other option trades that I already have
577.00s: on that are out in April these are just
578.68s: out in like January and these are still
581.40s: on so I'll stay into these essentially
583.48s: and I'm just sliding the stop up so
585.36s: that's all there is to it now if we take
587.52s: a look at the options chain really quick
590.68s: let's take a look at total oi we have
594.28s: 567,000 calls against 218,000 puts so
598.48s: still massive call skue and the one
600.60s: thing that stuck out to me during the
602.16s: live stream was this the near-term
605.20s: options chain is all sorts of messed up
607.92s: now notice how much that already aligned
609.88s: if you watch the video from Saturday
611.48s: compar it to here this is already a
613.60s: massive normalization it makes way more
615.44s: sense here so now it's looking like in
619.64s: uh 20
621.20s: DS the 23s are at like
624.56s: 104.6 per V against the 15 noves which
628.72s: are like 9 8 so that closed almost 10
631.68s: points this was really interesting
633.60s: because that was so far out of whack but
635.28s: it looks like it's starting to normalize
636.60s: same thing with some of those Kinks that
638.56s: we saw in 15 no so that's good um
641.92s: otherwise it's just really really
643.16s: anomalous it was actually something I
644.36s: was looking at trading the other thing
646.00s: I'll note here quickly is that there are
648.12s: massive call IV skew on both of these
650.80s: this went away for a while now it's
652.32s: coming back so this is people starting
654.44s: to price more richly to the upside
656.56s: expecting potential upside movement very
659.48s: cool to see as always if there's
661.56s: anything you want me to take a look at
662.80s: throw it in the comments or shoot me an
664.24s: email Eric outlier trading. be an
667.84s: outlier I'll see you later
