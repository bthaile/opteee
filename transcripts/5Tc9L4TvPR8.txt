0.00s: What's up, outliers? Today we're going to talk about how to trade zero DT options for
4.64s: beginners. I have a playlist that talks about zero DT options in a bunch of different ways,
10.40s: because it's something that I regularly do myself. However, there are a ton of traps
17.00s: and especially for small accounts. So the goal for this video is to walk you through
22.40s: in orientation on what these are, how to think about them, how to potentially start using
27.56s: them in a way that's more likely to at least give you some runway before lighting all of
33.72s: your money on fire as compared to the droves of people you see on Reddit. That essentially
38.50s: are gambling and yolowing their money and zero DT options, trying to guess what direction
43.60s: something is going to go on the last 42 seconds of the day using all of their life savings
47.52s: and then wondering why it didn't work out. Let's start first with understanding what's
53.90s: going on here with zero DT options. First and foremost, what are zero DT options? Super
59.10s: simple. They are contracts that expire on the same day. Now, when we discuss zero DT options,
69.62s: it refers to the daily expiration cycle, whereas one stupid note, but worth mentioning,
75.78s: is zero DT's have been around before. It's just not every day, right? You just have to wait
80.42s: until options expiration third Friday, the month until more and more have been added.
84.90s: But come of May of 22 and specifically the indices first. So think SPX and DX places like
93.06s: that they added Tuesday Thursday, expiration to complete the existing one. They was a Friday
98.22s: AKA now we have daily expirations. This is been spread out a little bit into some of the
103.50s: smaller brother and sister indices. So SPX has XSP, which is attempt the size that also
110.62s: will have zero DT ease and then same thing with spy. There's a couple of very important
115.58s: differences though when we're talking about these that you have to pay attention to, we'll
119.02s: get to that in a little bit. So why are they popular and how popular are they? Well, let's
125.62s: take a look. This is from Cebo and we can see based on exhibit two that options are now
133.82s: over 50% of XPX volume. It represents over a trillion dollars, notional value trading
143.82s: every single day. It's an incredible, an incredible adaptation of the market, but then also adoption
154.06s: from users. And the interesting thing here is that it provides a fascinating use factor
162.38s: for both retail and institutions. Now, unfortunately, most of the time retail is going to do what
168.78s: I was just explaining. They're going to try to use some sort of technical indicator and
172.02s: they're going to try to guess directionally, which way something is going to go and probably
176.66s: the most difficult time frame to do it. This is not say it's impossible. It's just really,
180.10s: really hard to do consistently over time. I've been trading for over 18 years now and the
185.34s: really short term time frames I've studied them at nauseam. They're super difficult and it's
189.50s: because they're the price movement that happens in those time frames is based on things that
196.18s: you cannot accurately forecast. They can be done based on somebody just choosing to adjust
201.06s: their book for one reason or another. There's not a technical indicator that gets you to that.
206.14s: There is over the long run when you start talking days, weeks, months, you start to be able
211.54s: to actually analyze things with a little more efficacy. So the reason why all this matters
216.22s: is because when we're talking about zero DT options, they really are a binary event in the
223.62s: amplify price movements. Now, for retail traders, they have a way to speculate on something
228.98s: that's super cheap. If you look at zero DT options, they're very cheap, funny enough, on
233.78s: a relative basis. They're actually very expensive, which we'll talk about. But then institutions
239.10s: have a use case here because then they don't have to carry a hedge for an additional time frame
244.34s: if there's a specific event that they want to hedge through. Let's say the Fed is coming out
248.10s: with a statement. They don't want to unwind their positions. They can use shorter term options
251.94s: in addition to all the other institutional purposes, speculation, market making, all
255.90s: that kind of stuff. So the way to think about zero DT options is it's kind of like any other
262.42s: option, but it's on crack cocaine. And it's because everything is going to move super fast,
267.94s: and it has to make a really big decision. Every single option has a decision to make. So if we
274.98s: go to spy, this is after the close and we open up the 10 June expiration, what do you notice
281.62s: about the delta for everything that's out of the money? It's effectively zero, zero point two.
288.74s: These are learning a little bit, but these will also be zero. And then everything that's in the
293.94s: money is the delta of one. Every option has to make this choice come expiration. It's going to
299.62s: either have a delta of zero, meaning it's out of the money, has no value anymore, or it's going to be
304.66s: in the money and worth whatever the intrinsic value is. It's a big choice. And we can actually
310.34s: measure this choice that options make. And that's one of the beautiful things about the Greeks.
316.58s: Is they give us a view to assess how these options behave, but take a look at this specific
323.78s: bullet point. We know that there is a cheap way to speculate. This is the standard sensation
329.14s: seeking side. That's not what I would emulate at all. But then there's actually a fairly practical
334.58s: side. High volatility risk premium embedded in these ultra short dated options. There is persistent
342.18s: risk premium index options in general, and especially now in zero DTEs. So there's an interesting
348.82s: opportunity here. And if you can read between the lines, you probably know which way I'm taking you
352.50s: so far. So now let's talk about how these options behave. Because again, the Greeks aren't some
359.30s: like optional thing to loosely know exists. If you're going to trade options, especially zero DTE
365.54s: options, if you do not understand the Greeks, they can completely destroy your capability to be
371.14s: profitable in this. And I'll show you exactly why it's more profound than you might understand.
377.38s: Now there's a couple general traits that are useful to know. And I'll show you a couple things
383.62s: quickly. The first thing we're going to look at is spy. And it's because it has volume. Now when
390.26s: I'm trading zero DTEs, most often I'm using European style options. So think SPX. And it's because
397.38s: they're cash settled. There's no assignment. And there is no exercise risk in terms of
404.82s: early exercise or having a position where part of it's in the money and you don't want to take
410.02s: the inventory of shares on all that goes away with the cash settled index. But we'll start with
414.58s: spy because again, it has volume. I want you to notice something. Take a look at the beginning
418.58s: of the day. You notice how high this volume is relative. Then if you take a look at the end of
425.62s: the day, the volume is also very high. And then sometimes you'll see these spikes throughout the day
431.14s: here and here. That's random. If you take a look at the day prior, again, you can see the same thing,
435.54s: beginning of the day, high volume kind of trails down throughout the day and then peaks at the end
439.62s: of the day. What I'm showing you is markets get very busy for 30 minutes after the open and 30 minutes
445.78s: into the close. If you're trading zero DTEs, you have to know this because let's say, for example,
451.38s: you're trying a buy strategy and you choose to buy in the first part of the day. Well,
456.50s: there's a good chance you're buying really expensive premium that is going to quickly contract.
462.34s: And then your trade is going to be in a compromised position from the jump. And now I would like to
467.86s: show you why that's the case. I want you to focus on this little table that I made for you. This
473.94s: is measuring the Greeks. This is actually using yesterday. It doesn't matter. And I have used this
479.54s: as using spy. And I'm basing it off of a 30 Delta put. It doesn't matter if it's a putter or
483.78s: call in the context of this. I just want to show you the relationships and the impacts the Greeks
488.18s: have relative to the premium. So I have three different expressions. I've one date expiration,
493.30s: 39 days of expiration and 221 days to expiration. And notice when we take a look at the Greeks,
501.70s: Delta Gamma Theta Vega. Notice what portion of this premium Delta Gamma Theta and Vega take up
513.78s: for a one day option. So this is after the close looking at an option that expires the next day.
518.82s: Then make that same comparison of Delta Gamma Theta Vega of a 39 DTE option. And then do the same
528.58s: for this 221 DTE option. And before I tell you what do you see? There are some very important things
537.30s: to pick up. The first thing is literally everything except Vega is amplified massively. The other
546.74s: thing you'll notice is that is you get closer and closer in time. The amplification increases
554.82s: because if we take a look at these 221 day options, Delta makes up 1.57% of the premium. Gamma is
562.90s: 0.02% and Theta is 0.31%. So super, super low. Then if we go to 39 days, we go from 157 to 519.
574.82s: We go from 0.02 to 0.2. Then we go from 0.31 to 2.42 and then the big jump.
583.14s: When we go from 39 into 1. So what I'm showing you, which is exactly what the Greeks tell us,
589.54s: is how these options are going to behave. So these 1 DTE options are going to have Delta's that
595.78s: comprise a massive amount of the premium of the option. These are 30 Delta's across the board.
601.70s: But because every option is in the process of making that very big choice, Delta is huge.
607.38s: And therefore Gamma is also huge because Gamma measures the rate of change of Delta,
612.10s: Theta is probably one of the most dastardly things you are fighting if you're trying to buy
618.26s: zero DTE options because they're cheap because you can be correct, but still lose money
623.22s: because you can't outrun this Theta. And the fun fact is Theta is not linear throughout the day.
629.94s: Theta will have different pockets in the beginning of the day when you see all that volatility and
633.54s: that volatility contracts. Theta is going to be more aggressive. Then it's going to be kind of slow
637.86s: and steady a lot of the day and at the end of the day it's going to be really aggressive again.
641.70s: So if you don't understand these concepts, it will be very difficult, especially of a small
646.26s: account because this is super unforgiving if you're just throwing money out there hoping that
649.94s: this is going to work. So now that we have an idea of what zero DTE options are, how they behave,
657.70s: let's now talk about some ways to think about approaching it. But the first step I want to take
664.42s: between that is to actually show you plots of these. So if we take a look, I showed you that table.
670.66s: I purposely didn't put it in the form of a graph because you don't need that. You can see the
675.62s: data there, but for those that are more visual, here are some graphs. This isn't plotting zero DTE.
681.46s: This is just using long dated shorter dated, but this is just showing you the relationship of delta
686.82s: to date's expiration. You can see how this slope starts to get really aggressive and this is just
692.42s: going to get more and more aggressive as you get closer to expiration. Gamma has a really tall peak.
699.30s: This is closer for at the money options. Gamma is going to get super high because all of those
704.82s: monies, all of those options need to make that choice of moneyness either in the money or out of
712.26s: the money. Then we can see Vega is what it is here. Vega on really short term options isn't really
718.98s: that big of an impact. It's because there's so little extrinsic value. Let's spend a couple
723.78s: minutes talking about how to trade these in a small account. The very first thing to keep in mind
728.82s: is my typical approach is being on the sell side. The reason is pretty transparent. If you take a look
735.78s: at what we just talked about, that's not to say that you can't make money buying, but it's very,
739.46s: very difficult and the cards are absolutely stacked against you. You have to be super good in terms of
744.98s: your directional picking, which is very difficult to do in that time frame as we talked about earlier.
750.26s: The main profit mechanism that we're trying to capture with zero DT options is variance risk
754.50s: premium. This is the propensity for implied volatility to be higher than realize volatility. This
758.98s: is generally the case. Now, if you apply what we refer to as a dumb strategy, we're just every single
765.78s: day no matter what you do the same thing. You will generally capture that variance risk premium,
771.06s: but it's not going to be as efficient as it could be if you're able to feature match and find
776.34s: some filters to apply. That's the secret sauce that goes into building a high performing zero DT
784.34s: strategy. There's different signals you can apply to try to measure this. Now, a super basic one
791.22s: is plotting implied volatility over realize volatility. That's a way to get you started because we
796.82s: know some of the primary traits, things like volatility clusters and so on and so forth. But
801.54s: you can use that as a starting point for your research, especially for the pro community. We
805.54s: spend a lot of time getting into the nuance here because that's where things really get interesting,
810.02s: but this is plenty to start with without a doubt. Now, the way that I look to typically trade these,
815.78s: again, is via some sort of sell side. We know that puts tend to be excessively price relative to
823.30s: calls. So we can do some sort of ratios. The simplest way to start, in my opinion,
828.58s: is via some sort of iron condor. And you can see that represented here. What I have is just various
835.30s: delta options plotted. So a 10 delta short call short put and then a five delta wing. Then a 15
842.50s: delta short call short put and the five delta wings and so on and so forth. You can take her with
846.50s: a bunch of these different versions. The main point that I'm showing you in this older test
852.42s: is that the P&L for all of them is profitable. Even the worst performing one was profitable.
858.10s: And if you're curious about this test, again, check out that zero DTE playlist. I go through all this
862.02s: stuff there. I want to talk about the core concepts here because for a small account,
868.26s: when you're trading zero DTEs, it is a numbers game. It's something that you have to get enough
872.58s: cycles in in order for the strategy to approximate. And it's going to go through periods where it
878.02s: clusters. That means you can have four, five, six losing trades on a row. It's not super frequent,
883.06s: but it can happen. And you have to be able to weather that negative path. And if that erodes too
890.98s: much of your account value, then you're out of the game. And then you don't even get a chance to
894.82s: actually test the strategy. So the way to find that balance is to figure out what the max loss
899.78s: would be based on the structure you select if it's a short iron condor. And then you have to
904.66s: project out not losing once twice three times. You have to project out losing six, 10, 15 times,
909.78s: depending on what delta is you ultimately select. And you have to be sure that your strategy is
914.34s: able to endure those so that this way, you don't get stopped out in the middle of your strategy.
920.66s: This is all about developing a sound process. And then slowly refining it over time. This is not
926.10s: a way that's going to make you a ton of money super fast. This is not what it is. The cool part
930.34s: about zero DTEs, especially from my approach, is that they do allow you to tap into a less correlated
937.06s: return source. The intraday moves still matter, but you're really trying to take a sampling of
941.46s: vol and you're trading that more specifically. So you might have the rest of your portfolio scattered
946.34s: across all these different expressions. The market can be going down. Those positions might not
950.02s: be doing well, but then this can perform just fine in that kind of context. So it gives you another
954.74s: return source. Again, really important to pay attention to the total fees that you're paying
959.94s: because it gets expensive. That liquidity can dry up so poorly at the end of the day. So if you're
965.38s: trying to run stops, you can get mutilated by that. You have to be super careful. And then as I
970.98s: mentioned before, making sure for me, using European style options so that I'm not worrying about
977.30s: taking something into expiration and coming up with inventory that I don't want. This is a brief
981.62s: overview on how a small account can rationally attempt to trade zero DTE options. If you have any
987.94s: questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you later.
