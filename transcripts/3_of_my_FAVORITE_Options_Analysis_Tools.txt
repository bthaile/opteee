0.68s: options are really informed markets we
2.96s: can glean a lot of information even if
5.32s: you're not an options Trader but if you
6.80s: are all the better the goal of this
8.60s: video is to walk you through three of my
10.36s: absolute favorite options analysis tools
13.52s: so that you can make better informed
15.28s: decisions because at the end of the day
17.52s: leveraged markets are almost always
19.84s: going to bring in a lot of really
22.76s: smart a lot of very
27.52s: smart a lot of very smart
32.20s: money okay it's not all smart money you
35.20s: will find degenerates that find their
37.20s: way into options but don't let this
39.08s: represent our illustrious Community
41.76s: there are a lot of smart money and
44.84s: Traders involved in options markets it's
48.60s: actually where a lot of interesting
51.04s: phenomena and effects can be found take
53.52s: for example something like this if we
55.96s: take a look outside of our friends at
58.24s: Wall Street bet and we look at something
60.36s: like insider trading what smarter way is
63.44s: there to make money than insider trading
67.24s: take for example our very own icon
69.72s: somebody like Nancy Pelosi who clearly
72.64s: is not insider trading but her portfolio
74.88s: has return over 700% in a decade that's
78.28s: pretty impressive you must just be
79.92s: really good at analyzing stuff joking
83.36s: aside insider trading is actually a
86.28s: pretty smart expression for people and
87.76s: the reason why people will use options
89.36s: to try to chase down Insider information
92.04s: is because of the leverage we can also
95.20s: look at Option pricing and its
97.36s: informative of Market moves we can look
100.80s: even in really big indices like the S&P
103.32s: 500 and we literally can extrapolate
106.68s: where probabilistic moves might be based
109.84s: on options positioning and it tends to
111.84s: be pretty damn good the reason this all
114.64s: comes together is because if you have an
117.64s: educated opinion and you're trying to
119.24s: monetize it
120.60s: most people who are strongly convicted
122.80s: in that educated opinion are going to
124.40s: look for leverage because you can make
127.24s: more money so let's talk about how we
131.08s: can use some of these different tools to
133.60s: make us more money in trading options
135.64s: we're going to start with very basic
138.84s: probabilities now probabilities derived
141.88s: from options trading are actually highly
143.96s: informative so let's take a look at
145.68s: something like lunar and we can see this
148.48s: is what's called a probability
150.08s: probability analysis from think or Swim
151.76s: there's different tools that plot this
153.00s: in different ways you can even make your
154.52s: own if you don't have access to this
156.12s: platform you can do it in Excel I've
157.40s: done it a bunch of times what this does
160.16s: is on the x axis shows you based on
162.80s: different days to expiration duration
165.36s: the y- axis shows different prices and
167.92s: right now I have it fit to be
169.68s: probability of a touch within a one
172.00s: standard deviation range so what this
174.04s: means is let's say what do we think the
176.44s: probability of lunar hitting 15 is
178.80s: within the next two weeks 14 days well
181.68s: rather than guessing or going off of
183.80s: some janky assumption that you have
186.00s: because you feel it in your left
187.44s: ventrical and you think that that's your
189.64s: heart's telling you the right direction
191.00s: your heart's probably lying to you but
192.80s: we could take a look at the 15 strike in
195.44s: 14 days you can see it's a 24.71
198.28s: probability of hitting that you
199.64s: literally can quantify the probability
201.60s: of these things happening this really
203.44s: feeds into our ability to structure
205.64s: trades informatively because then we can
208.28s: look at things like expected returns
210.92s: based on the probability of this price
213.52s: being hit within our time frame and then
215.64s: we can look at what our p&l would be at
217.76s: those points and make an informed
219.64s: decision we can use Delta as an
222.96s: approximation for an option being in the
226.12s: money at expiration but it's only an
228.92s: approximation and I'll show you why
230.72s: that's the case because the probability
232.84s: of an option being in the money or out
234.36s: of the money actually have their own
237.44s: calculations for those that geek out
239.48s: over this stuff as much as I do you can
241.56s: actually check out this video which I
244.80s: realize this is a wrong one because if
246.84s: you go there you're going to find a
247.92s: bunch of formulas and stuff and most
249.56s: people are going to click off and never
250.68s: come back I'm just kidding for those
252.12s: that are actually interested in why
254.72s: Delta is used as an approximation for
257.60s: probability of in the money you can
259.68s: check out this video I'll throw a link
261.20s: to the description below to it and
264.76s: suffice it to say that the calculation
267.32s: for Delta is very similar to the
268.96s: probability of an option being in the
270.36s: money or out of the money similar
271.96s: they're not the same and let me show you
273.92s: exactly how this works so we'll stay in
275.48s: lunar for our example we'll go into the
277.32s: trade window here and let's just pick
280.12s: this N9 days to expiration if we take a
282.84s: look at Delta which is this column on
284.28s: the call side we take a look at this 39
286.20s: Delta option well actually let's start
288.56s: with the 48 Delta option with the 48
290.76s: Delta we would expect there to be a 48%
293.80s: probability of this option being in the
295.32s: money at expiration if we take a look at
297.52s: the actual calculated probability 41.3
300.64s: 4% so it's actually a pretty big
302.84s: difference it's six points in change why
305.76s: is it so different it's so different
308.96s: because
310.40s: volatility really exacerbates this
313.44s: phenomenon so if you take a look at
315.40s: something like apple for a
317.52s: quick near-term example 9 days to
320.64s: expiration and we take a look at the 50
322.80s: Delta you notice that the 50 Delta
325.44s: probability is actually 48.91 per. so
328.40s: it's actually pretty close right like
330.12s: not not too far off well even for
332.48s: something that has lower volatility a
334.56s: little more evenly priced markets if we
337.00s: go far enough out in time let's just
338.48s: pick this 191 days to expiration we'll
340.76s: do this 46 Delta the 46 Delta option has
345.28s: a
346.32s: 39% probability of being in the money so
348.64s: you notice as you go further out in time
350.72s: the variance between Delta is an
352.84s: approximation in the actual calculation
354.88s: widens you'll also notice that it's
357.48s: really dependent on volatility so if we
359.48s: have have more volatile stock like lunar
361.92s: and we go further out in time let's take
363.76s: a look at this 40 Delta this is actually
367.36s: a
369.40s: 26.2% probability of being in the money
371.60s: even though it's a 40 Delta so when you
375.20s: use Delta it can work just fine in near
377.68s: term stocks meaning near-term
380.56s: expirations for those stocks and then
382.28s: also stuff that's not quite as volatile
384.04s: but just know that there are limitations
385.64s: and it's not perfect you can also use
388.56s: these probability con that are just
390.60s: simply baked into the expiration cycle
392.72s: so you'll notice that we can see what's
394.88s: the probability of lunar within the next
398.72s: 9 days falling within a
402.04s: 1.62% or 1.62 $1.62 range and it's a one
407.32s: standard deviation probability of being
408.88s: in there so we can use all these
412.40s: different probabilities to inform our
414.08s: trades the next piece here is volatility
417.40s: we can use different elements of
419.80s: volatility to inform what we think might
423.04s: happen if you're familiar with the
424.48s: things that I do for a lot of the more
426.32s: memes slowth style stocks like lunar
429.24s: like GameStop we use volatility a lot so
432.48s: let's take a look first at this idea of
434.60s: smile and surface now again for those
438.28s: interested in going a little further
440.24s: into detail I have two videos for you I
442.36s: have one that talks about volatility
444.08s: volatility surfaces IV rank IV
446.52s: percentile all those kinds of things
447.96s: here and then this one talks about
449.60s: volatility surfaces and smiles now I'm
452.08s: just going to give you a quick synopsis
454.00s: again for those that might not be
455.36s: interested in all the nerdy details we
457.68s: can go back over to the options chain
460.56s: and we can plot the implied volatility
464.32s: for different options in different
467.08s: expirations so all of these different
469.00s: lines represent a different expiration
471.48s: different this purple here is 13 DS this
475.12s: kind of I don't know what color that is
476.72s: pinkish is 27 DS and so on and so forth
479.52s: so if we clean this up just pick a
481.00s: couple of the main expirations to make
482.68s: it a little more clear we can visualize
485.40s: what the volatility is for different
487.64s: strike prices at different points in
489.48s: time and why is this informative well
492.44s: very often you'll find this kind of
494.40s: configuration where the out ofth money
496.92s: puts have much much much more expensive
499.28s: implied volatility compared to the out-
501.36s: ofth money calls this is standard now
504.80s: what happens if you see this flipped
507.20s: what happens if you see the call site
509.60s: have way more implied volatility than
511.16s: the put side well that means that the
512.92s: market is actually a little more nervous
514.88s: about something going up and it's
517.08s: pricing in the probability of an upside
519.12s: move a little more heavily and a decent
522.04s: example of this typically I don't know
523.44s: if it is right now but actually will we
525.88s: do see it right now in GameStop so if we
528.52s: take a look specifically at this 20 D
530.64s: expiration take a look at that we can
533.20s: see that it's actually pricing the
535.32s: out-of-the money calls way more richly
537.44s: than the puts which is not normal that
539.48s: that means that there is an expectation
542.40s: of an upside move which is why these are
544.32s: being priced more richly we can also see
546.88s: which strike prices are being priced
548.92s: more richly compared to other ones so
550.68s: like for example the 36 handle is here
554.16s: is definitely priced more richly
555.84s: compared to the 37 handle stuff like
558.24s: that so that's more for more specific
561.64s: options trading and volatility Traders
564.88s: now implied volatility percentile is a
567.16s: really important concept this plots the
570.92s: volatility the implied volatility for a
573.88s: stock against itself now there's a
576.04s: difference between implied volatility
577.80s: percentile and implied volatility rank
581.24s: suffice it to say that other video will
583.16s: go way further into detail on the
585.56s: differences but implied volatility
587.72s: percentile is typically a better metric
590.56s: the reason why it's better is it's less
592.96s: prone to skew so if we go back to
595.44s: GameStop we can see that the implied
597.48s: volatility percentile is 6 1 but the
600.60s: implied volatility rank is only 20% why
603.32s: is this implied volatility percentile
606.64s: plots the current IV and it literally
610.28s: looks at out of the past year how
614.56s: frequently is the volatility higher or
617.72s: lower than where we are today so what
620.88s: this means in this case is 61% of the
623.48s: time volatility is lower than where it
627.08s: is right now so it means volatility is
629.00s: actually quite elevated why does the
631.00s: implied volatility rank only show it at
633.32s: 20 it's because this metric is very
635.92s: prone to skew it uses the
638.48s: extremes so even though we're definitely
641.68s: on a higher relative volatility over the
643.92s: past year something like implied
646.08s: volatility rank is going to include
648.16s: these kinds of moves when we had the
649.84s: squeeze back in the spring/summer so
653.44s: that metric is going to be skewed in
654.92s: here until that data point falls off
657.08s: this is why I prefer implied volatility
659.48s: percentile this tells us on a relative
661.60s: basis how volatile something is then we
664.72s: also have implied volatility versus
666.88s: realized or historic volatility this
669.96s: again is more for the volatility Traders
672.24s: out there but this is how we can capture
674.52s: things like variance risk premiums so
678.44s: what we want to see is how frequently is
680.52s: implied volatility running overstated
682.96s: relative to Historic volatility all this
685.32s: means in simple terms is the market is
688.76s: pricing bigger moves than are actually
691.88s: happening and as you guessed it I have a
693.96s: video that dives deeper into detail on
695.88s: that all the links to these will be in
697.24s: the description for you to check out
698.96s: whenever you feel like it why does that
702.12s: matter well because if you're buying
703.84s: options it means that you're typically
705.32s: buying options more expensive than what
706.96s: the moves tend to be and then if you're
708.80s: selling options you might be able to
710.08s: monetize that now we can also look at
712.88s: things like expiration volatility and
715.40s: skew what does that mean let's take a
717.80s: look first we'll crunch that down pop
719.76s: over here expiration volatility gives us
723.28s: ideas on what might be happening in
724.96s: different time frames so if I just iBall
727.60s: through this I can see that this
730.36s: 116% IV is much higher compared to the
733.08s: relative ones right before and after why
735.48s: is that the case could be a bunch of
737.44s: different things it could be partially
739.12s: because it's a primary expiration it
741.28s: could be that there's an event expected
743.44s: going on here more often than not when
745.80s: you see a higher level of volatility
748.84s: further out in time than near-term stuff
751.80s: it tends to mean something it we don't
754.08s: always know what it is this is really
755.84s: useful for trading things like biotech
758.08s: stocks and whatnot now we already went
760.40s: over volatility skew in terms of out of
762.80s: the money puts versus calls and the way
764.96s: that that works on the volatility smile
768.08s: but we can also take a look in the
770.44s: options chain itself to visualize put
772.64s: skew we can take a look at the
774.52s: individual implied volatility for these
777.44s: different strike puts right now we're
779.36s: looking in GameStop 37 days to
780.96s: expiration and we can see like for
784.04s: example that these strikes are actually
786.60s: really really cheap compared to
788.44s: something that's closer and further out
789.88s: of the money so what am i showing you
791.76s: these are trading at a 79% VA the 22s
795.08s: but if we take a look at the 26s it's an
796.88s: 86% V and if we go way out here to the
799.40s: 11s it's 151% V so we can take a look at
803.92s: which strikes themselves have anomalous
806.88s: volatility either high or low and then
809.16s: we can also look at the volatility
810.92s: relative per Delta and compare puts to
814.56s: calls so a 30 Delta option in on the put
817.92s: side here is an 88.7% VA we go to a 30
821.40s: Delta on the call side and we take a
823.56s: look at the Vault it's
824.80s: 135% fall that tells you a lot because
828.04s: typically there's what we call put skew
831.00s: the market tends to price puts more
833.60s: expensively than calls because the
835.92s: market fears the downside but this case
838.44s: it's inverse first again that's
840.52s: indicating that the market is expecting
843.52s: some sort of upside move now the last
846.68s: thing on our list is a general tool
848.84s: volume and oi we can use this to
851.88s: identify things like liquidity and we
854.40s: can also use this to identify
857.04s: interesting options positioning so let's
860.24s: take a quick look at what this looks
862.12s: like first things first liquidity so we
865.12s: can look at which of these contracts
867.60s: have really high volume and open
870.00s: interest what you will almost always
872.16s: notice are the contracts that end in
874.76s: zero or five will have the highest open
878.12s: interest this is just natural human
880.08s: tendency to like those kinds of round
883.08s: numbers this will be across pretty much
885.36s: all products so if I take a look at the
887.32s: 20 strike there's 177,000 open interest
890.24s: if I take a look at the 25 strike it's
891.88s: 26,000 open interest everything in
893.84s: between it much smaller almost always
895.84s: the case you'll also find that more
898.68s: often than not most of the volume in
900.92s: open interest is going to be in primary
903.60s: expiration Cycles because there's more
906.60s: liquidity there now we can look to see
910.84s: if there's concentration at these
913.08s: different levels and we can kind of use
914.80s: that to inform ideas so one of the
916.64s: things you'll see me do is first find
919.72s: where we are in terms of expirations so
922.40s: right now when I look at the call
925.28s: options and put options in GameStop I
928.44s: can see
929.52s: that most of the open interest is
931.68s: actually out in 17 j25 there's a lot of
934.80s: cases where this will invert and we'll
936.60s: see it in near-term expirations that's
939.48s: the market expecting a near-term price
941.96s: movement for some reason or another
944.08s: that's usable information for us I also
947.24s: like to see the total skew between call
951.44s: open interest and put open interest
954.00s: because when we see way more calls than
957.00s: puts that tends to mean that the market
959.52s: is expecting an upside movement that's
961.88s: why people are coming in here to buy
965.04s: Halls so we can also detect kind of
969.00s: standard activity something like hedging
971.80s: Behavior so if we go into spy you'll
975.04s: notice that the puts are really really
976.84s: heavy 12 million puts compared to 6.2
980.40s: million calls why is that well it's
982.04s: because a lot of entities will use spy
985.76s: or SPX to hedge a broad basket of stock
988.92s: stocks because there's a lot of things
991.00s: in the S&P 500 Index they might have
993.56s: individual Holdings in individual
995.72s: companies and then they'll come in here
997.48s: and they'll use this to hedge the whole
999.60s: portfolio why does that matter because
1001.68s: the context matters a lot because if you
1003.80s: look at this outright you might say wow
1006.64s: the they're expecting a market crash
1008.36s: that's why there's so many excess puts
1010.28s: compared to calls but it's not so much
1012.08s: the case you'll typically see it like
1013.68s: this now you can track the actual ratio
1017.96s: and when that starts to move then it
1020.36s: becomes a little more interesting so
1022.48s: right now 2: one puts to calls from
1024.48s: tracking this I can tell you it's not
1025.96s: that excessive but if we see something
1027.80s: like 4: one 5 to one puts to calls
1031.24s: that's people really ramping up downside
1033.16s: protection for some reason or another so
1036.92s: these are three of my absolute favorite
1041.16s: options analysis tools let me know if
1043.44s: you'd like to see a part two because
1044.96s: this is the tip of the iceberg we can go
