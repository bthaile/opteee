0.00s: What's up outliers? Today we're going to talk about how to read an options chain. Believe it or not,
4.24s: there is a ton of really useful information baked into an options chain that most traders kind of
12.40s: gloss over because they don't know what to look for. So we're going to do a quick recap of what
17.76s: the chain is, how to read it from a basic perspective. And then I'm going to give you a look inside
23.04s: a more advanced way to pull information to make better informed trades. So what is an options
30.08s: chain? And that's this thing right here. It's essentially where all of the listed options for
34.56s: a security exist. And it shows you all of your different choices with respect to options.
41.20s: Now we're going to be looking at a live options chain. Well, the on the platform itself versus
45.76s: this screenshot. I just wanted to give you something. If you want to grab a screenshot or something
49.20s: as we go through this so that you kind of have an idea of like the key metrics that we're going
52.96s: to work through. So let's get into the weeds. So first I have Palantir up here just as an example.
58.32s: And the first thing I want you to notice are all of these different aspirations. These are also
62.96s: known as series as terms, but every option's chain is going to have different expiration cycles.
69.04s: And you'll notice that there are some that are broken out into these yellow text labeled weekly.
73.84s: And then the rest are kind of like this gray text. These are normal explorations, the gray text.
79.04s: And they represent the third Friday of the month, standard options expiration. And then there's
83.44s: weeklies. And if you look at something like SPX, there's even daily options. The main note is that
89.60s: in general, most of the liquidity is going to be in the standard options expiration. And that's
96.80s: simply because that's where larger institutions and entities gather together because they know that
104.00s: the other one's going to be there. It's kind of like going to play basketball and knowing which
107.76s: court to go to because that's where the people are out of the version of that. Then you'll notice
111.84s: that for every single one of these explorations, there's a different implied volatility.
116.24s: Every expiration has its own implied volatility. Now if we click open one of these expiration cycles,
122.96s: you'll notice that there's kind of two broad sections. There's the call side over here labeled
128.08s: by this. And then there's the put side over here labeled by this. Then you will notice that there
133.28s: are a bunch of columns. I actually have a lot, which is why you can't even really see the names.
137.04s: Don't worry. We're going to go through them. But one thing to note is that the same columns that
140.80s: are on the call side, they're mirrored over here on the put side. So you'll notice, for example,
145.36s: the bid in the ask and then you'll notice the bid in the ask. So the point of that is you will
151.20s: essentially review this together on one side, but it applies to the other side. So another thing
157.52s: that might jump out at you is the different coloration. There's kind of like this gray color and then
161.36s: there is this not gray color. This color represents in the money options. That's why they're
166.32s: caddy corner to one another like this. So quick refresh for calls. If your strike is below the current
173.28s: stock price, which is 84 92 in pounds here, then it means you're in the money. Then everything
179.04s: that's above that is out of the money and then vice versa for puts. So now let's talk about these
184.88s: individual columns. The first thing you'll see here is bid as spread. And the bid ask shows us first
192.32s: the bid. That is the most somebody is willing to buy something for it. That's their bid.
199.28s: And then the ask is the cheapest somebody is willing to sell something for it. So essentially if
204.32s: you were going and you were like, I want to buy an option, you have to go towards the ask. And if
208.40s: I want to sell an option, you go towards the bid. Now one of the cool things is you'll notice that
212.88s: there's a gap in between these and we can try to transact towards the middle of this gap. So if we
219.84s: click into this and hit buy, you'll notice how there's this little bar down here that shows the
224.72s: mid price and then the natural, which is whatever you would get hit at the bid or the offer
230.08s: respectively. So you can actually try to play it from the mid. So let's say if I wanted to buy this
235.04s: option, well, if I wanted to buy it right now, I would have to do it at 385 is that's where there's
240.96s: currently a offer resting from somebody willing to sell it at that point. But if I'm not necessarily
247.28s: trying to get filled right the second, I can try and play the bid at spread. And maybe I put in
251.44s: a bid and I'm willing to pay $3.70. Maybe I get filled there. So you can get filled towards the
257.84s: mid point, but the bid and the offer, those are the resting orders that are sitting there. Now this
263.36s: can be a market maker or it can be a retail trader that just as an order sitting there waiting to
267.36s: get filled. Next up, I'm going to jump over to this column, which is the last price. That's just
273.68s: the last price that that option transacted at. And you'll notice that there's a bunch of these
278.32s: different rows, all of these different rows represent different strike prices, right? So you can see
283.36s: 38, 39, 40 and so on and so forth. So the strike prices obviously are shared between calls and puts.
289.20s: So if we're hovering in on this row that's now highlighted in blue for you, you'll see the last
294.40s: price is 360. That's the last price this option traded at. Then you'll notice this next is Delta,
299.68s: which measures the rate of change of premium per one point move in the underlying. That means if
304.72s: Palantir goes up by $1, the premium of your option, Seteris, Parabis, everything else remaining
309.36s: the same would move up 41 cents. Then you have your gamma, which is your rate of change of Delta
316.16s: per one point move in the underlying. So that means that if Palantir did go up by a dollar,
320.80s: you would make your 41 cents from your Delta, but then your Delta would also grow by three pennies
326.48s: from 41 to 43. Next up, you have Theta. You'll notice that Theta is negative. This is the rate of
331.76s: change of premium per one day passing. And as we know, options decay. So that means from today to
338.64s: tomorrow, this option here will lose 13 cents. Next up, we have Vega. This represents the premium
345.84s: rate of change per one percent change in implied volatility. So if the implied volatility
351.36s: in Palantir goes up by 1%, this option here would go up by 8 cents. So there's a lot we can use
360.32s: the Greeks for. And specifically, it's to help us fine tune our positions. I have an entire video
366.32s: that walks through that in depth. We'll throw a link to that in the notes below. But the main
370.40s: thing to note is you can throw them on your options, Shane, so that you can be aware of these things
374.00s: as you're building your positions. Now, let's talk about a couple other things. Volume, which is this
378.80s: one represents the number of this specific option that traded today. So for this 90 call,
385.76s: there is 56, 77 contracts traded today. We don't know if those are opening contracts for closing
392.32s: contracts. We just know that they traded today. Then over here, this 88, 82, that represents
398.88s: open interest. These are contracts that are currently open. This metric can go up or down. New
407.52s: contracts can be open so it can go up from 88, 82 or it can go down because people can close
413.44s: contracts. This updates overnight and it's not updated throughout the day. So this means this 88, 82
420.56s: will stay like that all day. And then at the end of the day, the volume that occurred today will
426.16s: be integrated into the open interest, whether that volume is opening trades, then this number would go
432.08s: up open interest. If some of these are closing trades, then some of this would go down by those
437.92s: closing trades. So this column right here with the colored numbers actually represents the day
443.60s: over day change of open interest. These are custom coded by me. You can use Chat you PT to help you
449.36s: with it if you're interested, but it just helps me visualize the changes of open interest. And you'll
454.56s: see why that matters to me later. So what this means is from yesterday into today, 415 contracts were
461.44s: added were open for the 90s. And you can see 2524 were added for the 92s. And you can see three were
469.44s: closed net net over the entire transactions for the day. So we can observe the changes in open
475.60s: interest, which is really useful. Next up, we have the implied volatility. So just as the stock
481.20s: itself has implied volatility, just as the term itself, the expiration as volatility, every single
486.64s: option also has implied volatility. Then we have probabilities. So one of the really cool things
492.56s: about options is they inherently provide us probabilities. A lot of people will use delta as an
498.32s: approximation for a probability, which is generally okay. I have an entire video dissecting acts.
503.60s: It's not fully accurate. You can actually see it's not accurate right here, because this column
507.84s: here shows us the probability of being in the money at expiration. And then this column here
512.00s: shows us the probability of a touch sometime before expiration. And you can see that the probability
517.04s: of being in the money at expiration is 34.54%. But this shows you 41%. So you see that's actually
522.24s: pretty big gap. So delta is somewhat useful for that, but it's not perfect. Now the last two
526.96s: columns I'm going to show you are currently the size. This is an assessment of liquidity. Notice how
532.00s: there's only two at the bid at 350. And then there's 183 at the offer at 385. What does this tell us?
540.80s: Well, it tells us that there is a really small offering to essentially take these at the 350.
547.76s: There's only two contracts that are offered at that price. So for some reason, people really aren't
553.04s: wanting to trade at the bid. So they are sizing it down a lot. But you can see for the
559.92s: ask side of the equation, it's kind of different. There's 183 offered at this 385. So we're more
567.68s: open to trade at this. So then what this tells us from an inherent perspective is if I wanted to
572.00s: put on a five lot and let's say that I wanted to sell a five lot at the bid for 350. Well, it means
577.84s: I would only get two of them off unless more step in to allow me to complete that transaction.
583.20s: So you can use the size, which is the number resting at the bid in the offer respectively,
589.60s: to get a sense of the liquidity that's being offered at those levels. And then the last one here
594.64s: is theoretical price. The theoretical price essentially is the platform's method to calculate
600.08s: what the option should be trading at using all of the standard inputs into an options pricing model.
606.32s: So stock price dividends, implied volatility, so on and so forth. So ideally, this gives you at
611.44s: least a like a sense of what the fair price of so this is how you read an options chain. Now,
618.16s: I want to show you how you can use an options chain to glean a lot of really usable information.
623.92s: I'm going to focus on just two of these for this video. If you would like me to run through more,
629.12s: let me know we could do a follow up. So the first thing I want to talk to you about is volume over
633.44s: open interest. And then I want to talk to you about implied volatility. So if we take a look at
639.04s: the broad options chain itself, we can see a bunch of different metrics with respect to volume,
645.28s: open interest, and so on and so forth. So here's the total volume for today. And we can see that
649.76s: there's 746,000 calls traded against 535,000 puts. So way more calls than puts now somebody might
656.88s: immediately assume that that means that that's bullish. Lots of people are buying those calls,
660.24s: but we don't know inherently. But what we can do is we can see what percentages of those
665.44s: traded at the bid at the offer or between the market. So if it traded at the bid or the offer,
671.84s: we make an assumption. Now, people regularly wrongfully assume that this means with certainty that
678.00s: something is bought or sold because remember the bid is essentially where you need to go to sell
682.72s: things and then the offer is where you go to buy things. Now, we can make an inference based on if
689.04s: the option was traded at the bid or the offer, but we don't know with certainty. And that's for a
693.92s: bunch of different reasons that are not in the scope for this video. But you should know that it's not
697.76s: with certainty. So we can just glean general market data at that level. So today, most of the calls
703.92s: that transacted clean at the bid or the offer occurred at the ask. So those are people that are
709.52s: buying calls. Interesting. Not a huge skew. Sometimes it's way more dominant than others, but it's
714.80s: a starting point. Then we can take a look at open interest data. We can see, well, how many total
720.08s: calls are there relative to puts now for index options? You'll typically see more puts than calls.
726.32s: In single security options, it typically reflects the general bias that people have. And the reason is
732.64s: for hedging activities versus directional speculation. So in this case, you can see people are clearly
738.00s: taking directional bets on balance. You're likely to the upside. But then we can get more specific.
742.88s: We can say of this two million, where's most of the open interest sitting? And we can see in 21
749.36s: March, there's 322 K against 267. The point of doing this is to see if one of these cycles is
756.72s: profoundly higher than the others that might mean people think something might be going on around
763.44s: that time frame that they're trying to capture. Now, the last thing I told you that I wanted to talk
767.92s: about with respect to volume and open interest is volume over open interest. So we can use open
773.92s: interest to see where people are building out positions and why? How much money is at them? This
778.72s: can go into even trying to hypothesize Max Payne, which I have a video on. It can come into trying
785.28s: to assume where we think the market might be expecting things to go. But what we can also do
792.24s: is track the relationship between volume and open interest, like this strike here. Notice how
797.20s: there's 513 options traded and there's only 188 options open. What that tells us is with certainty,
804.88s: some really the majority of these options are being bought to build a position to open up contracts.
812.56s: These aren't contracts coming down. So whether or not they were bought to open or sold to open,
818.00s: that's we don't know yet. We'd have to look at the data below. But we do know that 513 of these traded
824.08s: today only 188 of them exist. So when we see volume exceeding open interest, it tells us that there's
830.08s: a build out occurring at that level. That's actually what this column tells me. Notice how
835.04s: where you see 1.1 that tells us that if that's over one, there's now more volume than there is open
842.40s: interest. So it allows us to hypothesize and to look at activity for people that might be building
848.48s: out directional positions that might know something. Now let's talk about volatility really quick.
852.16s: We can see that there's term volatility across all of the different exploration cycles. And really
857.12s: what we look for is just big deviations like this here. So you can see it goes from 79, 74 down to 69
863.60s: then kind of starts rallying up. So that leads us to believe that the market is pricing slightly higher
868.64s: volatility in this section compared to this for one reason or another. We don't know. But we can
873.20s: start doing some homework and we can come up with ideas as to why that might be the case. There
877.76s: could be a contract renewal. There could be earnings coming up. But it tells us it's a question
882.16s: mark we should look for. The other thing we can do is actually look at the volatility surface.
887.20s: So if I crush this down and just look at a couple cycles to make it easier to see, you'll notice
891.76s: that I can see a lot of different things by looking at the surface. I can see the relative
896.72s: volatility between expiration cycles at the same strike. I can see if certain strikes have really
902.16s: high implied volatility like these do right here, the 22s compared to something like the 23s.
909.52s: And that could be for a bunch of different reason. I can also look and see if the general out of
914.80s: the money puts are more expensive in terms of vol than the out of the money calls. If I see this
920.56s: kind of smile that has higher put IV that tells us that the market is pricing in more severity to
926.56s: the downside, but a higher probability move to the upside. And to show you an example of what this
930.96s: can look like reversed. If we look at something like GameStop and we take a look at the 21 March
935.92s: in 17 April, what do you notice difference? The calls are way higher than the puts. So a lot we
940.96s: can pull from these. These are two of the very, very basic but really useful starter ways to use
947.52s: the options chain for information. As always, if you have any questions, let me know, be an
951.60s: outlier. See you later.
