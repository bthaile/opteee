0.00s: How to manage a portfolio.
2.24s: Do you have a specific process that you follow?
5.72s: And if so, what is it?
6.98s: Can you walk somebody through exactly how you manage a portfolio
11.92s: been less than 10 minutes?
14.08s: If the answer is no, it means that you're missing a lot of important details.
18.24s: So the goal of this video is to walk you through how I think about managing a portfolio.
23.40s: Now, right out of the gate, my approach has changed over the years that I've been trading.
28.44s: I started trading over 16 years ago now.
31.28s: So there are definitely some differences that I do now compared to where I start.
35.48s: So the point is, is it's an evolving process.
38.12s: But I want to walk you through looking back at that experience.
41.12s: What's worked well for me?
42.88s: And then at the end of the video, I want to walk you through exactly how I split out my
46.60s: portfolio and how I like to think about managing my risk.
50.20s: What's up, everybody?
51.20s: Eric here.
52.20s: Welcome back to all the outliers.
53.20s: Shout out to the Patreon family and the YouTube members.
55.68s: And with that, let's talk about how to manage a portfolio.
59.32s: So the very first thing is I really do believe this applies to everybody, whether you are
63.52s: a passive investor and active investor, there are points that you need to manage a portfolio.
69.48s: You have to touch and adjust your portfolio.
72.00s: And that's an important point because really the only thing that changes is the frequency
76.92s: and maybe what you track the depth of the information that you collect.
80.60s: But overall, even if you're a passive investor, there's going to be periods of time where
84.36s: you need to rebalance things.
86.44s: So regardless of how active you are, I think it's important to think about a reasonable
92.72s: time frame for you to manage your portfolio.
95.72s: So if you're active, it's obviously as active as you like to trade.
99.36s: If you're a passive investor, once a quarter, once every six months, once a year, something
104.24s: like that is probably completely fine.
106.56s: So let's talk about what we should be thinking about to start.
111.48s: I am a huge fan of Stephen Covey and the seven habits of highly successful people.
115.16s: And one of the things he talks about is begin with the end in mind.
118.08s: The reason why I think that's so important is because as we think about how we're going
122.32s: to manage a portfolio, what we're trying to accomplish needs to be integrated into those
127.80s: interactions when we're managing a portfolio.
130.72s: So what do I mean by that?
132.12s: What is the objective of your portfolio?
135.00s: Are you trying to aggressively grow your account or are you trying to manage income so
141.04s: that you can have a secondary source of income?
143.56s: The reason why those two thing matters is depending on which one of those you're focused
146.88s: on, the way that you deploy your portfolio is going to vary widely based on that.
153.04s: So what I really think it's important to do is think about your long-term and short-term
157.00s: objectives and then quantify, quantify, quantify.
161.56s: That means if you say, I want to grow my account, that's not good enough.
166.08s: You're missing a ton of fidelity that's going to impact the way that you do everything.
172.00s: So if your goal is to grow your account by 1% per year versus 20% per year, the details
181.80s: that get you there are vastly different.
184.92s: And we take a lot of these things for granted.
187.24s: So when we're talking about what we're trying to do in the markets, whether it's talking
190.40s: about portfolio management or strategies, we have a lot of things baked into our thoughts
195.44s: if we say grow the account.
197.08s: Well, really we're inferring all of these other things, but you got to get into detail.
202.56s: Take the time and quantify what you're trying to do.
205.88s: I cannot overemphasize how important that is.
210.00s: So with those details quantified, here are the guiding principles I think about.
216.48s: Efficient and detailed.
218.36s: The more active you are, the more detailed this should be.
222.92s: And it's because the details matter, your number one job as a portfolio manager to lay
230.24s: it out front.
231.56s: Super simple is manage risk.
234.20s: You have to manage risk.
235.64s: That is your number one job.
237.20s: You cannot make money if there's no money to make money on.
240.80s: So whatever you are attempting to do, your profits are secondary.
246.48s: Your return target is secondary to risk management.
250.20s: That has to come number one, and it's got to be baked into what you're doing.
254.12s: So think about how you want to manage risk and think about how you want to track your
260.00s: risk management throughout the life cycle of your strategies.
264.36s: So with that, let's think about risk.
268.24s: What is your desired risk?
270.64s: This is the very first stage that I am going to come across every time I engage in portfolio
276.84s: management.
277.84s: So what does this actually mean?
279.96s: Well, I'm thinking through based on my analysis of the current market conditions, how much
287.44s: risk do I want to have out on my YouTube live session today, today is the 13th of March.
293.16s: And I am almost 100% utilized, 98% utilized.
297.52s: And it's because there's a ton of opportunity right now with all the SVB bank failures.
301.24s: I have a ton of positions expiring today.
303.52s: My last story short, I had a high risk tolerance for today because I saw a tremendous amount
309.56s: of opportunity that might not always be the case.
312.56s: And it very frequently isn't.
314.08s: If you look at a lot of my live sessions back from 2022, a lot of my things were 20% utilized,
322.76s: 10% utilized.
323.76s: I had very low risk tolerance.
325.96s: And it's for different reasons.
327.48s: Sometimes it's because I was ahead of pace and I didn't need to have a lot of risk.
331.24s: It's because I didn't see a lot of opportunity and I wasn't looking to force trades.
335.00s: The reasons are limitless, but you need to define this.
338.56s: And you can define this in two ways.
341.12s: The very first thing I think about is based on my current standing in terms of my progression
346.52s: towards my end of year goals, which I've quantified.
349.80s: So I have an idea of what I need to be at.
353.16s: Do I need to have more risk on or less risk on and still be on pace?
358.84s: So I think about how does my current tracking align with my overall long term, short term
365.44s: objectives from there.
367.76s: I like to think about and more importantly, what is my assessment of the market conditions?
372.80s: The reason why this is so important is because let's say I'm trailing behind in terms
378.08s: of my overall portfolio objectives.
380.24s: I'm not making enough money I need so far for the year, but I really am kind of risk
386.48s: off.
387.48s: And my overall market assessment is pretty bearish or negative, meaning I'm not sure what
392.28s: I want to put out.
393.28s: I don't want to run my short strategies for whatever reason.
396.20s: So I might just accept the fact that I could have a period of time where I'm running behind
400.98s: pace.
401.98s: And sometimes that is what it is.
403.48s: You can't allow it to happen for too long though.
406.04s: That's why going through the process of outlining your desired risk is so important because
411.40s: you can say, okay, maybe this month, I'm going to be hands off.
415.84s: But then next month, if your overall market disposition hasn't changed, but now you're
420.16s: starting to fall behind in terms of your objectives, you need to figure out how to interface
424.72s: with the markets, meaning you might need to just add some more speculative trades out, things
429.08s: like that.
430.08s: And I'll walk through how I split out my portfolio in just a few minutes.
433.02s: But this idea of understanding your current desired risk is absolutely important.
438.12s: So now let's talk about how I break out portfolio management.
443.84s: And there's two levels I look at.
446.60s: We have the portfolio level.
449.12s: And then we have individual trades and strategies.
451.96s: So what I mean by this is when I'm looking at my overall portfolio, I'm looking at things
455.92s: like beta weighted deltas and does my overall risk align with what I want for my beta weighted
463.08s: deltas.
464.40s: I also think about things like are any of my current products too correlated.
470.00s: So that means if I have a bank of America trade on and a Wells Fargo trade on at the
474.28s: same time, but I'm not super stoked about financials like I am not right now, maybe having
480.44s: two of those positions on even if I like them isn't the right answer.
484.28s: Maybe I need to make a transition on one of those trades.
486.96s: So I'm going to look at the overall risk in terms of size that I have out.
491.72s: I'm going to look at the correlation between the products to make sure that I'm not becoming
495.32s: too centralized in terms of my risk profile.
498.52s: And I'm going to juxtapose all of that against my market hypothesis.
502.32s: This is the very first tier that I'm looking at from there.
506.28s: I'm going to look at each individual trade.
508.80s: So what is the risk in the trade and in terms of my risk metrics, have I hit them?
516.12s: Meaning if I have a mental stop set or if I have a resistance level set for a directional
522.20s: trade that is now becoming violated, I need to manage the risk in the trade.
528.00s: That's the very first thing that's listed here for trades and it's the very first thing
531.60s: that's listed here for the portfolio and it's for a reason.
534.40s: If you recall way back at the beginning of this video, your number one job is to manage
539.40s: risk.
540.40s: That's why it is front and center.
542.36s: I prioritize it and I emphasize it because that is what I need to do first.
548.08s: So when I'm looking at individual trades, have I met my risk management thresholds, which
553.76s: need to be predefined before you enter a trade.
556.56s: What I'm going to look at is it time to take profit.
558.56s: This is the more fun scenario, but maybe I need to just review and say, Hey, did I hit
563.24s: my max profit on this short put or did my ratio diagonal hit my profit target, which
569.64s: is validated by hitting x point that's predefined before entering the trade.
576.40s: Those kind of details matter quite a bit.
579.48s: Time I trade options.
581.28s: There's a time component to what I do.
583.92s: So is something expiring soon?
586.32s: If so, is it okay?
587.64s: Do I want to take it into expiration or do I need to manage it?
590.96s: Another aspect of time that doesn't just apply to options traders, but if you trade
595.40s: an equity, but earnings is coming up and you don't want to be exposed to earnings.
600.24s: Well, there you go.
601.60s: You need to do something about it and it's because of an event that's coming up.
606.12s: And then the last thing is the thesis review.
607.96s: This really ties to time sort of, but if I put on a trade with a certain thesis,
613.96s: for example, if I wanted to trade XLF like I am right now and my thesis is bearish.
619.60s: And I'm looking at my position in XLF and I look at XLF and it's not doing what I thought
625.00s: it was going to do.
626.16s: I don't have to wait until my risk metric is hit or until my profit metric is hit.
632.12s: If my general hypothesis, if my thesis isn't happening, that's grounds to manage that
638.68s: position in and of itself.
640.92s: So there's a couple of the things that I tend to layer into this, but I think this is
644.52s: a good overview for most people on how I like to think about portfolio and individual
650.84s: trade management.
652.56s: Now I want to walk you through how I construct my portfolio and what the implications are.
657.24s: I have a core allocation and I have a speculative allocation.
662.08s: I purposefully split my portfolio into these two pieces because it gives me a ton of
667.20s: clarity over where I have my money, what kind of trades I'm putting on where and it
671.96s: allows me to you guessed it, control my risk.
676.72s: So the way I think about my core positions is this is kind of my main bid for success.
681.36s: This is my main effort as we would say in the Marine Corps.
684.76s: So when I have my annual return targets, which is now around 12% per year, it used to
690.00s: be 15, but I'm guiding it down just because of my natural progression.
693.60s: I don't have the same return requirements.
697.36s: When I'm thinking about getting that 12% per year, that 10% per year, really 8% per
701.64s: year, it could be whatever it is for you, 20% per year.
705.08s: This is the primary way I'm expecting to do it.
707.56s: So I am going to wait the core allocation of my portfolio to give me the highest probability
713.68s: of success to hit that goal.
715.60s: The speculative is when I have a hypothesis, when there's something that's playing out
720.64s: that I think there's an opportunity and I want to take advantage of it.
724.52s: For example, SBB, the financial sector right now, the overall market volatility right
729.36s: now, it's why I'm so invested as of today is because I am leveraging this speculative
735.04s: allocation of my portfolio significantly.
738.08s: And it's because I see a lot of opportunity.
740.92s: So how do I break these out?
742.32s: Well, in terms of the overall allocation of the portfolio, for the core, I allow myself
748.32s: to use up to the entire portfolio on a core position.
752.52s: So this is something like a coverage strangle in IWM.
756.04s: If for whatever reason, I want to have all of my portfolio in that position, I'm fine
760.12s: with it.
761.12s: That's no problem for me.
762.12s: I'm okay with the variance.
763.12s: Is it exactly what I do?
764.62s: Probably not.
765.62s: I would probably add some sort of inverse related product or something to hedge some of
769.72s: the risk, whether it's adding bonds.
771.60s: And it's just because there's not a huge reason for me to be 100% invested in my portfolio
776.24s: at this point.
777.24s: But back in the day, this was common for me speculative.
780.44s: This is guided down significantly from what it used to be part of it is because as my
784.36s: accounts grown, I have a larger dollar amount to play with.
787.12s: So 40% is plenty.
788.60s: However, if I wasn't in that scenario, speculative used to be allowed to be up to 80% of the portfolio.
796.28s: And there's times where between core and speculative, I was levered, meaning over 100% utilized.
802.04s: You have to figure out what's right for you based on your objectives.
805.44s: But the name of the game here is figuring out what makes sense and what's right for you.
810.08s: Then what kind of strategies do I run in these different allocations?
814.24s: So for the core allocation, I typically run things like the coverage strangle ratio
818.88s: diagonals.
819.88s: And when I say the coverage strangle, it's all the individual components of that as well.
823.32s: So it's things like cash secure puts.
825.40s: It's things like ratio covered calls, things like that.
829.56s: And when I look at the speculative allocation, it's essentially everything.
834.00s: Now I typically don't trade the coverage strangle in the speculative.
838.00s: That's not a hard and fast rule.
839.40s: It's just not my typical go to.
841.52s: And then I have things like straddles, strangles, long and short single options, earnings plays,
847.04s: like the event driven play today in SVB, FOMC meetings.
852.44s: This is where there's events that I'm trading around and I'll pair it with a strategy.
856.80s: So within this allocation that I have for the core and speculative allocation of my portfolios,
863.96s: I then sub-allocate to the individual positions based on how I feel about them, how much
869.76s: money I want tied up in each one of the positions.
872.52s: And the way that I think about the individual positions is realistically speaking, if it's
878.12s: a coverage strangle, I allocate more of the portfolio.
881.44s: Like I said, I would do 100% of my portfolio in IWM coverage strangle, no problem.
887.76s: Typically speaking though, it would be guided down a bit based on where I want the rest
892.52s: of my positions on.
893.52s: So for my core allocation, let's say I currently have 60% of the portfolio utilized and I have
899.80s: 50% of that tied up in the coverage strangle of that 50% that's tied up.
904.68s: It's not all out at a given point in time.
907.20s: This is a big part of my scaling protocols, which I talk about pretty regularly and it's
911.08s: an important part of what I do.
912.92s: So as you can see, there's different tiers to all of this capital management and scaling
917.28s: and it gives me an immense amount of control over things.
921.08s: Exactly how in 2022, when the market was down 19%, I was up 20%.
927.64s: It's not because I'm a genius and learned what was going to happen before it was going
930.92s: to do and made some sort of great trades based on it.
933.32s: I traded with the market showed me, but I have plenty of capital that I can ebb and flow
938.40s: based on market conditions.
940.20s: And another great example is same thing in last year, 2022.
943.80s: My IRA account, which I only had 32 trades in total was up about 5%.
949.96s: It didn't trade that much.
951.24s: It's based on capital management.
952.88s: It's based on the way that I think about the risk and the portfolio so that I can ebb
957.28s: and flow as I see opportunity come and as I see opportunity go.
961.64s: So all in all, if you do not have a systematic approach to managing your portfolio, you're
966.80s: going to be a mess.
967.80s: It's going to be impossible for you to crack things in depth and then also most importantly
973.32s: validate what you're doing.
975.36s: We're thinking about our portfolio management.
977.92s: It needs to be a process exactly as I've outlined here.
980.88s: I'm going to start with my objective that are quantified figure out where I'm sitting
983.96s: against those.
985.36s: What is my current desired risk based on my portfolio analysis, which I've highlighted
990.40s: here pretty cleanly for you.
992.88s: Current risk desired out current risk that is out.
995.56s: What is the correlation of the products?
996.80s: Is there anything that I need to adjust from a portfolio level and what is my market
1000.84s: hypothesis?
1001.84s: How does all of this rack and stack together?
1003.88s: Like, subscribe, if there's anything that you want to see me talk about, throw it in
1006.88s: the comments below.
1008.44s: Be an outlier.
1009.44s: I'll see you guys later.
