0.16s: boom we're back let's talk about
2.00s: scanning for trades because this should
4.40s: not be a halfhazard approach it should
7.36s: be pretty systematic and it's for a few
9.72s: main reasons but it all boils down to
12.00s: efficiency so I'm going to walk you
13.24s: through the three primary steps I take
15.72s: when I'm scanning for trades and then
17.24s: give you some examples at the end of the
19.28s: video so make sure you stay tuned to
20.76s: check those out welcome back to the
22.32s: outliers shout out to the patreon family
24.40s: you guys make content like this possible
26.20s: for everybody else and if what I do
27.68s: helps you consider signing up otherwise
30.00s: let's get straight into this idea of
32.24s: scanning for trades the very first thing
34.40s: we're going to start with is a portfolio
36.08s: review this is because you have to
39.52s: understand how something does or doesn't
41.72s: fit into your portfolio you can come
43.72s: across the greatest opportunity on
45.64s: planet Earth but if there's no room in
47.68s: your portfolio to logically take on that
49.96s: risk it doesn't have a place so we start
52.00s: here and we look at three things the
53.80s: first thing is utilization how much
55.92s: money am I currently using is it enough
58.24s: or is it too much what what I'm asking
60.68s: here is is it enough meaning do I have
62.56s: enough risk out in order to continue
65.28s: moving me towards my monthly and annual
68.76s: performance targets or after I conduct a
71.68s: review of my portfolio do I have too
73.60s: much risk out at which point I'm not
75.88s: scanning for trades anymore I am going
77.68s: to be managing the portfolio now the
80.00s: reason why monthly and annual
81.72s: performance targets is also on here is
84.40s: because if I am way ahead of where I'm
88.12s: supposed to be for my annual performance
90.76s: I am going to be super selective very
94.68s: very selective extremely high threshold
97.96s: for trades to go on because there is no
100.76s: reason for me to force anything
102.84s: whatsoever if I am on par for my annual
106.28s: performance okay then I need to look for
109.20s: good trades still but I'm not going to
111.84s: be quite as selective and if I'm behind
114.56s: pace for the year and let's say that I
117.40s: need to open up my acceptable limits
121.20s: slightly but at no point does it become
123.48s: just put everything on there can be
125.44s: instances where you're behind your
127.56s: annual performance and it's just because
129.56s: of the way that the markets are moving
130.84s: and that is what it is so this isn't
132.96s: kind of a sliding scale to where you
134.36s: just start accepting garbage but the
136.64s: main difference is if you were well
138.32s: ahead of pace you should become super
140.68s: selective now risk assessment this is
142.92s: pretty simple I'm going to run through
144.64s: these different things within the
145.92s: portfolio for each individual position
148.12s: and then for the portfolio at so what
150.56s: are my Beta weighted Deltas for the
152.08s: whole portfolio that's kind of part of
153.92s: utilization but then for the individual
155.96s: positions and I'm going to run through
157.36s: all these different things the reason
159.28s: why this is all included in a video on
161.76s: scanning for trades because all of these
164.48s: inputs give me information that what I
167.40s: will integrate into my scans for example
170.12s: if I have a bunch of Trades that are
171.88s: coming up on expiration and I know that
174.20s: I'm going to be very light in my
176.16s: near-term section of my portfolio now I
179.28s: kind of know one of my preferences might
181.68s: be shorter duration positions to fill
184.64s: the Gap that's about to be there same
186.56s: thing if I notice that I have no bar DTE
190.44s: opportunities or risk on at a given
192.48s: point in time I might start looking for
194.40s: some longer duration thesises so that I
197.00s: can then fill that space having
199.88s: expiration diversification is important
202.40s: same thing kind of for the rest of these
204.32s: now the last thing here is portfolio fit
206.84s: so once I go through all of these
208.72s: different things I'm going to come out
210.48s: with an output what risk do I need or
213.28s: what risk do I want and we'll get into
215.76s: how that kind of feeds into the broader
217.80s: process when we get into the examples
219.64s: now next thing the actual scanning now
222.04s: that we've gone through our portfolio we
224.08s: have an idea of what we're looking for
225.92s: now we get to start looking now notice
227.84s: how I have these two different buckets
230.48s: right out of the gate portfolio driven
232.96s: versus opportunity driven scanning these
235.24s: are two very very different things when
238.12s: I'm looking at the end of my portfolio
240.96s: review and I now have a portfolio driven
243.48s: need I know exactly what I need so in
246.04s: this case let's say you go through this
247.44s: portfolio process and you realize that
249.56s: you are actually not using enough money
253.00s: and you need to add short-term risk and
256.72s: let's say that you know after your
258.68s: market analysis you want more bullish
262.04s: Deltas I've just given myself a bunch of
264.64s: criteria that I know what I'm looking
267.12s: for whereas sometimes if I'm just
269.68s: looking for opportunity let's say that
271.84s: I'm not using enough money but I don't
274.20s: have any particular portfolio needs I
276.64s: just need to use more money well now I'm
278.48s: going to go searching for opportunity
280.44s: what looks good out there that's what's
282.40s: going to drive the difference between
284.16s: portfolio and opportunity driven
286.24s: scanning so again for the portfolio
289.48s: we'll Define the need in this step then
291.24s: we'll look for the criteria to scan for
293.76s: that need and then conduct the scan and
295.56s: then for the opportunity driven this is
297.48s: when we're looking again same exact kind
299.88s: of idea we're going to scan analyze
301.80s: whatever the output is and then see if
303.60s: it fits within the broader portfolio all
305.72s: right let's talk about the last part
307.88s: here which is structuring the trade I'm
309.64s: going to fly through
314.20s: this because this part is kind of a
316.72s: whole different series but it is still a
319.44s: piece of my scanning process because
321.64s: based on how I'm Loosely structuring the
323.92s: trade mentally will inform how I scan
326.32s: for things and then the output of my
328.64s: scan will also inform what kind of trade
331.12s: structures make sense it's all a
332.96s: symbiotic relationship that I'll kind of
334.92s: bring together for you in a neat package
337.96s: when we get to the examples right after
339.56s: this section so the disposition that I
342.44s: have for a few things is really
344.36s: important for the market and the
346.16s: individual product because again let's
348.48s: say we look at the portfolio we're not
350.40s: using enough money in this example and
352.72s: we are very bearish but once we look at
355.16s: our beta weighted deltas and we realize
357.08s: that we have a bunch of negative weed
360.00s: Deltas to the Spy well how bearish are
362.56s: we maybe even though we're bearish we
365.16s: might need to add some long Deltas
367.56s: despite us being negatively viewing the
370.48s: entire market and having a negative
372.12s: disposition that's why this whole thing
374.68s: pulls together in different layers to
377.28s: inform Us by the time I get to the end
379.52s: of this flow I almost have the decision
382.16s: made for me it makes it much simpler for
384.60s: me to arrive at good trades so I'm going
387.08s: to start with the market disposition and
388.80s: then again if it's an opportunity driven
391.72s: trade I'm going to review the product
393.24s: nice and early once I get through this
395.68s: scanning phase I'm always going to make
397.56s: a short list of things that make sense
399.92s: and then I will kind of structure trades
402.36s: and then make a final decision based on
404.36s: what best fits the overall portfolio now
407.68s: inventory this is an important feedback
410.28s: into the broader portfolio fit do I want
412.28s: to hold shares or not what exposure
414.64s: duration do I need and then based on
416.72s: those inputs which strategy fits the
418.80s: best okay okay so now let's get into
420.48s: some examples where we get a chance to
422.16s: bring all of this together for you let's
424.20s: say we went through those first steps
426.88s: and we come up with some sort of short
429.12s: Deltas we're not using enough money in
431.08s: the portfolio we need short Deltas so
433.36s: what does this process look like well
435.20s: the first thing I'm going to figure out
436.56s: is how many short Deltas do I need I'm
438.72s: going to then allocate money to a
441.12s: prospective trade based on how it fits
443.12s: into the portfolio notice how I haven't
444.84s: scanned for anything yet these are all
446.52s: things that are done before I even start
448.20s: looking then I'm going to Define my
450.00s: market disposition again we need short
452.12s: Delta so we think that the market might
454.68s: be rolling over here for example then we
457.04s: go through the product preferences this
459.28s: can be anything from do I want to fade a
462.52s: specific stock do I want to fade a
464.48s: sector do I have anything that I'm
466.72s: leaning towards right now based on
468.40s: current market conditions we already
470.56s: know we need to Define what exposure
472.80s: duration we're looking for so in this
475.36s: example let's say we're going to give a
477.16s: trade $20,000 Market disposition is
479.64s: bearish product preference singular
481.76s: sector I'm open to either exposure
484.04s: duration anything greater than 2 weeks
487.60s: management inputs I don't care if I'm
489.76s: going to be managing it a lot or a
491.16s: little but again this does impact what
493.84s: strategy we end up selecting what kind
495.60s: of products we can trade strategies in
497.60s: management inputs is how frequently can
499.52s: you interact with this position then we
501.40s: conduct our scan so to scan for this
503.76s: need I'm going to conduct a sector
506.32s: review first so let's do that I'm
509.44s: looking for short Deltas first I'm going
511.64s: to look at 6mon rundown of the various
515.12s: sectors and see what names are in the
517.72s: bottom four in this case I see
520.24s: Healthcare real estate Staples utilities
522.60s: now I'm going to zoom this into a 3month
524.60s: look and again I see materials
526.96s: Industrials Staples real estate so these
529.56s: two are repeats down here utilities
531.92s: isn't that far off so I would still
534.00s: consider this on the table and then I'm
535.64s: going to bring this in closer to the
537.24s: duration hypothesis that I have one
539.40s: month I see energy Healthcare
541.64s: discretionary services so we can see
543.84s: Staples in the really short term is
545.56s: actually rallying same thing with
547.16s: utilities this is why looking at
548.88s: different time frames is so important
550.84s: because I'm trying to find something
552.16s: that's really sickly something that is
554.32s: just not doing well so when I get to the
557.36s: end of this View Healthcare has appeared
560.28s: quite a few times so I'll click in
562.08s: healthcare and I'll see okay life
563.80s: science is tools and services health
565.48s: career equipment and supplies
566.96s: Pharmaceuticals these are all lead
569.16s: leting the sector down the reason why I
571.80s: want this sector alignment to the
573.92s: downside is because I want as many
576.92s: factors stacked in my favor does this
580.32s: mean that individual sectors within
582.32s: utilities might be dragging in this case
584.84s: they're not but that could still be
587.08s: happening but I don't want the overall
590.16s: sector that I'm going to be fading to do
592.24s: well I'm going to look for robust
595.32s: weakness so in this case I'll start with
597.88s: the sector review and then I'm looking
599.64s: for the bottom sub sectors and then the
602.28s: just laggards within those sub sectors
605.08s: and then now finally is when I overlay
608.56s: my ta inputs so let's take a look at
611.64s: what that looks like so there are tons
614.36s: of different ways to set up your scans
616.56s: this is a very very very simple example
620.80s: on how in my opinion you can set up a
623.92s: pretty reasonable
626.04s: scan you're right you're you're joking
628.72s: about that
630.40s: right you're joking right so what we
633.72s: have here I'm just using moving averages
637.28s: and the way I set this up is
639.20s: purposefully to give me a really big
641.84s: window that I can then close in this
644.92s: gives me more things to look at now if
647.08s: you want to spend less time looking at
649.44s: stuff you can make this very strict but
651.24s: again going back to the original trade
652.96s: hypothesis here I just need short Deltas
655.00s: I don't really care what it is so this
657.04s: means if I look at the portfolio and I
659.76s: say oh well I want to have a defined
663.24s: risk trade or an undefined risk trade
665.84s: that can be determined ahead of time in
667.88s: this case I don't care so in this case
669.92s: what I'm looking at is by sector I'm
672.96s: looking at things where price is a
675.68s: little bit below the 2250 and 150-day
679.20s: moving averages that's it so in this
681.04s: case really I care mostly about these
683.76s: shorter term moving averages because
685.52s: we're looking at something that's
686.60s: greater than 2 weeks probably less than
688.44s: 90 days
689.48s: something like that and I'm going to
691.08s: look for where I can find weakness so
693.08s: here we know if you'll recall that the
695.48s: health sector has not been performing
697.32s: well so I see things like nvro algn T do
701.84s: and you can see all of their charts are
703.56s: bad srpt vktx all of these are not doing
707.44s: well mRNA BM so what I'm doing here is
711.32s: creating a short list so as I go through
714.40s: those different products I apply in this
717.00s: case primarily technical input if this
719.72s: say for example was a really long
721.80s: duration bullish thesis I would overlay
724.48s: quite a few fundamental components but
726.28s: in this case it's mostly ta and then I'm
728.24s: applying the short list once they get
731.16s: through that short list I will then
733.04s: start structuring trades so what you can
735.76s: see here is overall I'm looking to have
739.52s: a very very systematic approach to
742.52s: looking for things and once I get
744.64s: through those list of names that I was
746.16s: rattling off I run through kind of a
748.32s: more in depth analysis of each I will
751.12s: pull up the charts I will look at some
753.28s: of their earnings to see if they've been
755.80s: beating or if they're Contracting and
758.32s: I'm looking for the most sickly looking
760.64s: things of the bunch again this is all
762.72s: for this one specific need of short
764.88s: Deltas if this was an inverse scenario
767.52s: where I'm looking for bullish it's kind
769.12s: of the same thing but now I'm looking
770.68s: for the top sectors the top performing
773.08s: sub sectors instead of looking for
775.08s: bearish ta and fundamental inputs I'm
777.20s: looking for bullish ta fundamental
779.04s: inputs same exact process just different
782.00s: direction now in another scenario let's
784.56s: say that instead of starting with a
786.44s: portfolio need I come across an
788.64s: opportunity and a great example of this
790.60s: is the vix trade that I recently made a
792.96s: video on when I was talking about ratio
795.52s: put diagonals so if we come over here to
797.80s: the vix and when the vix dipped below 13
801.72s: here that was an opportunity driven
803.80s: trade for me so I saw this opportunity
806.64s: just based on how I typically observe
808.84s: markets this Drew my interest I then
811.16s: thought does a bullish trade in vix
814.44s: bearish Market trade fit into my
816.28s: portfolio the answer was yes so then
818.52s: from there it kind of short circuits
820.88s: this part because I already found what
823.20s: I'm interested in for whatever reason so
825.40s: then I apply the analysis for whatever
827.60s: I'm interested in then apply the more
829.52s: in-depth analysis and then structure a
831.36s: trade around it but you can see that
833.28s: overall I'm following the same blueprint
836.24s: I'm just skipping at least this part of
838.60s: the the scan because it doesn't apply in
840.32s: this scenario but all of these other
842.32s: things matter to me when I'm structuring
844.92s: the position again even for an
847.00s: opportunity compared to a portfolio the
849.12s: main difference is how this scanning
851.52s: section Works where this one I don't
853.56s: really know what I'm looking for and I'm
854.92s: looking for things to find opportunities
857.64s: in this case I already know what I'm
859.60s: interested in for whatever reason so let
862.04s: me know if you have any questions on
863.88s: this process if there's anything that
865.68s: didn't make sense or if there was
867.24s: something you learned I would love love
868.96s: to know about that so I can dive a
870.36s: little bit further into detail on those
872.00s: things maybe in future videos like
873.96s: subscribe share be an outlier I'll see
876.28s: you guys later
