720.00s:  Why do I think it's so important for you to go through and look at each of these as independent
725.36s:  data points versus just taking the average?
729.32s:  There's a very specific reason.
735.08s:  And it looks like we got some Moda, we got Zack, Scott, Beach, bum.
739.84s:  We got Reese, our boy, Shrej, good to see you.
742.68s:  My brother, Shrej, I hope you and the family are doing well.
746.04s:  I've been reading a lot about your people of India, spending that section in that book
752.88s:  I was telling you about is fucking thick.
755.36s:  There's a lot of Indian history that is absolutely fascinating, big fan.
761.76s:  Dark Mark says to look for anomalies.
763.60s:  That's part of it.
764.60s:  That's not the reason I'm thinking of, but that is absolutely a benefit of doing this,
768.80s:  for sure.
769.80s:  You're on the right path though.
772.56s:  So let's take a look at a scenario.
776.80s:  And I think it might help prove this point.
780.44s:  Let's say we have a 1% return, 2% return, 1% return, 2% return.
787.20s:  If we average this, you have an average of a 1.5% return, right?
797.24s:  Then we have another scenario.
807.16s:  The average is 1.5.
811.00s:  What do you notice here?
812.04s:  This is a very basic example, but I'm trying to prove a point here that hopefully we'll
816.48s:  be, put you on the right track on why doing each one is important.
823.68s:  Reese says does it behave within the expected range?
825.88s:  That's part of it.
826.88s:  But that's part of it.
830.12s:  Focus on math.
831.84s:  What's the difference between arithmetic mean and a geometric mean?
846.64s:  No clue.
847.64s:  That's fair.
848.64s:  That's completely okay.
849.64s:  Anybody have a guess?
853.56s:  An arithmetic mean simply takes the average of numbers.
857.76s:  A geometric mean accounts for volatility across the numbers.
862.08s:  These two things will have a different geometric mean.
865.32s:  This, they have the same arithmetic mean.
869.04s:  And it's because the mean is just the average.
871.60s:  So think of it in terms of your returns.
873.88s:  If this was 1.5% return, 1.5% return, 1.5% return, so on and so forth.
879.24s:  And this is 1% return, 2% return, 1% return, 2% return.
883.68s:  The average percent return is the exact same.
887.28s:  But the path that the return takes is different.
890.56s:  And this is why we use something like a compound annual growth rate, Cagger, which is a geometric
897.16s:  mean.
898.16s:  It accounts for the volatility of returns.
900.88s:  This is literally doubling and then halfing of the return and then doubling the return
905.64s:  again.
906.64s:  This is literally no change in the return.
908.48s:  It's the same thing.
909.48s:  Okay.
910.48s:  Taking it back to this example, I want to be able to conduct some very basic statistical
918.52s:  analysis around the constitution of these averages.
923.80s:  I want to know what the deviation is because we can have an average here.
929.80s:  That's 11.6% and then an average actually move a 14.1%.
933.88s:  You could say, well, fuck, I don't want to do that.
936.60s:  That sounds terrible.
937.72s:  That's not good at all.
939.08s:  But then you could go through the data and find that there's an instance where the implied
944.76s:  move was 11.6 and it came in at 33%.
947.96s:  Let's just say that that was one instance.
950.92s:  Let's say everything else was closer to within the range.
953.96s:  Well, this would lead you to believe it's not suitable.
957.92s:  When you look at the actual constitution of the data points, you might find that it's
960.92s:  completely suitable.
962.32s:  That there was an event that was outsized that will happen with earnings.
966.76s:  And then you can be completely fine with the overall risk that you're taking in the
972.28s:  trade.
973.96s:  So this is why if I'm trading earnings, and this is why for those that have seen some
978.96s:  of the different versions of kind of like the more basic earnings trackers that I all
982.20s:  use from time to time, I include the individual data points for this.
987.56s:  So Cliff notes version.
990.72s:  You can use the averages, but it's a very broad brushstroke tool that misses a lot of
996.00s:  detail that you want as a trader.
998.60s:  The only reason to not get to the actual detail that you want as a trader is either you
1003.12s:  just don't know and that's okay.
1004.36s:  That's the point of this to telling you you should do this or you're fucking lazy.
1010.00s:  And if you're lazy, again, I can already tell you trading is not the shit for you.
1014.64s:  Now I genuinely believe from the bottom of my heart that's probably not the case for
1019.40s:  people that are hanging out on a Saturday afternoon to learn about options trading
1024.92s:  in this case, tracking some earnings positions.
1028.40s:  So my guess is for some people in the watching the live stream, probably more the former category,
1033.84s:  where it literally just might be a gap of information.
1038.12s:  But I want to make sure that that point is crystal clear.
1041.36s:  So when I say you can't use, you can, but you shouldn't just use the average and that
1051.84s:  you should look at the individual data points so that you don't look at something in a
1058.08s:  broad brushstroke using an arithmetic mean.
1061.96s:  Does that statement make sense?
1064.00s:  And if it doesn't make sense, please tell me because we will spend the time right now.
1068.56s:  And we, I literally can build an example.
1070.28s:  I actually bet you I can make perplexity build an example for us even faster.
1073.44s:  That would be kind of cool to say.
1075.20s:  So if that statement doesn't make sense, tell me if it does make sense, fantastic.
1078.44s:  That means that again, you're already moving along in terms of your general trading understanding
1084.28s:  and how to interpolate this information.
1088.72s:  Shrejay says we'd love to hear more about the book, say less fan, BRB.
1108.44s:  So this is, I'm kind of like a freak about efficiency.
1120.76s:  So what I have is a bathroom book.
1123.20s:  I literally, I leave it cracked open and then I flip page by page.
1127.76s:  So if I'm going in to go number one or go number two, it doesn't matter.
1131.24s:  I'm going to read a page in the book.
1133.12s:  Now this is the second version of the book that I've read, but this is the book.
1142.28s:  So the Smithsonian history of the world, map by map, it's kind of a chunk.
1147.44s:  But right now I'm learning about Maria India.
1151.92s:  But I got to be honest, you boy doesn't know, you boy doesn't know much about Maria India.
1157.32s:  But this is what I thought was really interesting.
1160.36s:  This is the roots of Indian history.
1164.84s:  I'm learning that a lot of Indian people actually came down from the earliest recorded
1174.68s:  Canaan was in Kuveru, which is from the north.
1178.20s:  And then people kind of like made their way south, which is really interesting.
1181.96s:  And it's a lot of what we would consider today like Middle Eastern style cultures that
1187.24s:  formed what it is now.
1190.76s:  I thought that she was interesting.
1192.28s:  So I am going to put this book back.
1195.12s:  Oh, hold on, look at this, look at this dude.
1201.28s:  Sometimes I imagine that's probably what I look like to you guys when you give me an answer
1204.68s:  that pisses me off.
1206.52s:  I feel like I look like this guy.
1210.16s:  The eyebrows too.
1211.48s:  You might be my spirit animal.
1217.24s:  Twice when I just walked by, Thor just stared at me like bitch, stop moving.
1242.20s:  His one like we move around.
1243.56s:  He gets nervous that he's going to get left behind, but he's trying to sleep.
1247.16s:  Tough life, tough life for the dude.
1249.64s:  Treyjee says, yeah, that's accurate and it's reflected in our food.
1252.64s:  Yeah, it makes a ton of sense.
1253.80s:  Super fascinating though.
1255.96s:  The melting pot of that region is really interesting and especially from like a Western
1260.24s:  perspective, because I always say everybody knows like I am a fucking red blooded American.
1266.80s:  I love our country.
1269.28s:  Our country is like a little tiny baby child.
1273.08s:  We've been around a few hundred years.
1275.36s:  Places like China, India, the Mesopotamia region, whatever you want to call it now, like
1280.12s:  the thousands of years.
1281.76s:  It's like fucking it's a different story, bro.
1284.68s:  So I feel like Western education does a not great job capturing how deep the history is
1293.16s:  in all these other places as compared to us.
1296.04s:  We're literally like the rebellious children that didn't like our parents and we're like,
1300.40s:  yeah, fuck these guys.
1302.32s:  And now we have people like me that say famed.
1306.84s:  So we've gone so far.
1308.52s:  We're very cultured.
1310.40s:  So haters says because the average can be skewed by outliers.
1314.84s:  That's correct.
1316.16s:  Now, haters, take that comment one step further.
1321.88s:  It's not just that the arithmetic mean can be skewed by outliers, which is completely
1329.48s:  accurate, by the way, 100% correct.
1332.36s:  But there's a second point in there that is even more important.
1336.24s:  Put yourself in the position of a person that's trying to trade these.
1340.88s:  Put yourself in the position of we have earnings coming up on February 25th and CLSK.
1347.56s:  And the expected move is 19.2%.
1351.24s:  We can look at the average expected move is 11.6 and the average realized is 14.1.
1357.92s:  Does this 19.2?
1359.80s:  Does that mean that we're good?
1361.24s:  That this is a good trade green light.
1364.16s:  Not inherently so.
1366.16s:  There's a really important component to this.
1369.32s:  So haters, take that mind, take that thought one step further.
1373.52s:  We have the composition that there can be outliers that skew the data.
1377.88s:  But then there's also two other terms that you probably will want to become familiar with.
1384.44s:  And I realize like at some point, we're going to have to do some sort of like basic statistics
1391.24s:  on like tracking these things.
1394.32s:  So you guys probably won't know the exact terms, but I'm curious if you could describe
1397.76s:  them from a qualitative perspective.
1401.16s:  What else would I care about?
1402.72s:  There's the average.
1403.72s:  There's the fact that I can find a couple outliers.
1407.76s:  What else do I care about here?
1410.40s:  Any ideas?
1414.04s:  You know that arithmetic means a prone skew, skew prone.
1417.72s:  Don't know why I said that backwards.
1419.28s:  That didn't make sense.
1422.24s:  But if we're getting ready to put a trade on in here, volume and volatility, that's
1426.64s:  not it.
1427.76s:  Think about the frequency.
1430.52s:  If the implied versus actual was skewed because of two outliers, would I care more about
1440.88s:  that than if the implied versus actual essentially has a deviation that shows it very regularly
1449.16s:  is outside the expected move?
1451.32s:  Which one of those would I be less prone to put a trade on?
1454.80s:  Something that was skewed because of two big moves or something that shows a persistence
1459.96s:  in implied being underpriced compared to realized.
1463.64s:  When you frame it that way, it becomes very straightforward, right?
1466.60s:  I think everybody would know the answer to that.
1470.88s:  So, when we're looking at this data by plotting it out each time, we get a sense of the count
1487.32s:  of frequency that it exceeds.
1489.64s:  Which again, we can see this here.
1490.96s:  We're tracking this in a very lay fashion, right?
1495.76s:  We're literally just doing a gross count.
1498.84s:  What I would do is for each of these, I would actually build out the input section to include
1511.84s:  both implied versus realized for the past 12.
1518.00s:  And then you can look at things like the variance.
1524.56s:  Having a standard deviation of log normal returns is really useful because it helps normalize
1532.32s:  some of the moves and it's a slightly more informative metric.
1536.20s:  I am not going to go into that far of detail on this because again, this is all for beginners.
1542.64s:  You should know about that and you should look into that.
1547.76s:  But you don't need to have that mastered upfront.
1551.88s:  This information that will be pertinent in the future.
1555.28s:  This goes back to the beginning thing that I've talked to you guys about a million times
1559.40s:  now, which is as a beginner trader, you have to put first things first.
1564.88s:  And we're applying a little bit of the Pareto principle where if I look at the average expected
1572.40s:  move and the average realized move and the frequency that realized is greater than implied,
1579.20s:  then I use that as the basis for the decision.
1581.92s:  That's probably pretty close.
1584.04s:  Probably pretty close.
1585.04s:  Is that it is accurate as I would want it to be?
1587.04s:  Absolutely not, but probably pretty close.
1589.04s:  It's an okay place to start.
1590.92s:  So the point is you have to get something on the board to then iterate and learn off
1596.36s:  of.
1597.36s:  I'm just giving you a little bit of a deeper roadmap here to keep in the back of your
1600.32s:  minds.
1601.32s:  So let's continue now with this example.
1605.36s:  So we have the expected move from this move here.
1609.12s:  I'm using historic data right now, so this won't be obviously super informative.
1614.08s:  And then I'm going to actually insert another column.
1617.24s:  This will be average expected move.
1624.84s:  And that is 14.1%.
1632.68s:  And then we need to add a couple other columns in here, this expiration, these prices
1638.08s:  away.
1640.88s:  Those are the ranges.
1644.08s:  So this we can do something like IV edge something really, really basic.
1655.60s:  This isn't exactly what I would consider it, but it's okay.
1662.12s:  And what I would do is actually codify this so that if it's conditional formatted, I
1674.12s:  use conditional formatting a lot because it makes things a lot faster to eyeball.
1681.40s:  So I would do something like greater than zero.
1685.60s:  And then maybe we also do less than zero.
1689.24s:  And instead of that, we do this.
1694.56s:  So margin requirement, I don't even know what the margin requirement is for like a 10
1699.76s:  delta.
1700.76s:  Oh, I forgot we have to go back into on demand.
1704.16s:  That's where we're figuring all this out.
1706.68s:  So this just so you know, I'm citing this, I'm pushing it off the screen though, just
1711.84s:  literally for the sake of efficiency.
1714.76s:  So that I don't have to slide things around a million times when we're doing this.
1718.56s:  So I'm going to go back into on demand, because if I'm not mistaken, I think we were literally
1721.76s:  just modeling the trade in here in CLSK.
1725.00s:  CLSK.
1726.00s:  I don't know why we're at the 4th of March.
1730.40s:  Mike says shout off from the UK.
1732.40s:  Hey, yo, we're looking at going to the UK soon.
1735.96s:  I like, I still can't really fly that long right now without being in like too much pain.
1741.56s:  So we're not going this season, but we're looking to go to Ireland pretty soon and then we'll
1748.08s:  probably hop across to the UK and see which is better.
1753.08s:  Tasty trades and options that just became available to us over here and we're hungry so much to
1757.28s:  learn.
1758.28s:  That's awesome.
1759.28s:  Yeah, Tasty trade is great.
1760.28s:  I actually have a podcast coming up with Tom Sausanoff pretty soon.
1763.44s:  They have definitely a different approach to trading than I do, but they provide a massive
1768.92s:  amount of really awesome information for folks.
1773.20s:  And I'm stoked.
1774.88s:  I'm actually really surprised that it just became available to you over there.
1777.92s:  Oh, you mean is the broker?
1779.36s:  Because I was like, how the fuck did they just y'all have the internet, right?
1785.88s:  That makes I assume that's what you mean, right?
1787.88s:  The broker.
1789.12s:  But yeah, because I hope you're watching like the content and stuff.
1795.44s:  They put out a lot of great stuff.
1796.76s:  I don't really watch their stuff anymore myself too much, but I have a lot of respect for
1803.42s:  Tom.
1804.42s:  So I know that he's doing genuinely good things across the board.
1811.24s:  Okay, so back to our example and here we said, we need like a entry date.
1821.36s:  We need to add this date.
1832.56s:  And they had earnings August.
1839.12s:  Does this give me the date that would be convenient?
1844.24s:  Doesn't let's come.
1846.80s:  Let's see if I can just pick it.
1848.88s:  If I remember, oh shit, this does not look familiar.
1852.00s:  Well, we can make it easy.
1853.48s:  We can go to the end of August.
1855.52s:  See where the little thing is and then go back right here.
1860.32s:  The ninth after the close, we need to go to the ninth.
1867.44s:  And then we need to adjust this so that it's towards end of day entry, just like we would
1874.00s:  actually trade it like this.
1879.60s:  And now we can I think we already started modeling.
1882.56s:  Yeah, we already have the trade essentially modeled.
1884.84s:  I'm not going to worry about margin requirement.
1886.60s:  Just know that that's something that we like I absolutely would track.
1890.48s:  I just don't care to bother with it.
1893.72s:  That would give us stuff like return on invested capital and whatnot.
1897.20s:  Maybe I'll just hide it so that you know what's there.
1901.32s:  And then this is the data that we're inputting and then this is all auto populated data.
1910.04s:  So this should be nine aug.
1918.72s:  This minus this.
1920.72s:  I don't know.
1922.72s:  Oh no, I'm so stupid.
1926.96s:  I'm so stupid.
1929.76s:  We're literally looking at December.
1931.56s:  Why you guys let me do this?
1933.04s:  Let me like the second right that they reported.
1937.52s:  I was doing the the past week earnings releases.
1940.24s:  I think it's the second unbelievable that you guys would let me do this.
1952.08s:  Does this calendar work in on demand?
1957.52s:  That's unfortunate.
1958.52s:  It's a little bit nice.
1960.96s:  I'm pretty sure it was here.
1963.16s:  Let's see if it was.
1965.60s:  We had the I didn't care what this strike was.
1973.08s:  Eight delta for 22 cents.
1974.68s:  Let's see if that's what we can get here.
1976.48s:  Eight delta's yeah, this is correct.
1978.32s:  I don't know what all this is.
1983.64s:  Eight delta.
1985.64s:  Yep, that's exactly correct.
1988.64s:  Okay, so it's not nine August.
1990.44s:  It's two days.
1995.64s:  Two.
1997.64s:  And we're at 14 52 now 14 52.
2001.64s:  Right.
2006.64s:  And this is normally what I would do next to these is input the strike price.
2013.28s:  And then I can calculate like how far away that that is from the current spot price.
2018.92s:  I don't really care.
2020.36s:  I think that this is useful for people to see.
2026.80s:  I can kind of visualize it from the delta alone.
2030.16s:  So I'll put it in here just to try to give you a slightly more holistic example.
2040.72s:  So this would be put strike all strike.
2045.72s:  So the put strike was what 11 and a half.
2049.80s:  And I'm just going to do it for this one and then you'll see what I'm talking about.
2053.56s:  And then the call strike was 20 and a half 20.5.
2059.88s:  So what I can do is I can see how far these strikes are from the spot price.
2066.24s:  The other thing that I do want to do though is make sure that I maintain the same convention.
2071.04s:  So what I do is this.
2075.48s:  I've been using puts first.
2077.80s:  I want to keep using puts first.
2080.64s:  So I'm going to maintain that here so that it all flows together.
2083.84s:  So this is all put stuff then call stuff.
2086.80s:  Then we have put stuff call stuff.
2088.84s:  That's the idea.
2092.24s:  And this we can just do a percentage for the puts.
2098.80s:  We can see how far away our put strike is from it.
2103.52s:  So what we would do is take this minus this divided by this.
2116.96s:  And this will give us how far away we are.
2121.20s:  And this would be to the upside.
2124.92s:  Would be this minus this divided by this.
2134.40s:  So then we can monitor how big the gap is relative to what the expected move is.
2141.40s:  So that's 41% has to get moved over to the call side.
2149.16s:  I'm just not doing it right now because I'm in the process of raising my desk.
2153.76s:  So this goes here.
2156.44s:  And then what I would do now is this.
2160.04s:  I would essentially take the stock price.
2165.92s:  And I would subtract the stock price times the expected move.
2172.04s:  This gives me the lower range.
2174.84s:  So then what I can do is I can color code this.
2178.76s:  Then for the upper range, I can say, I need to know my call strike.
2189.12s:  I know my bad.
2190.12s:  I need to know this plus this times this.
2200.96s:  So this shows the upside band.
2205.32s:  And then what I would do here is just create another color code rule.
2211.60s:  I would essentially conditionally format this.
2224.48s:  And I would format it as.
2228.12s:  I don't want this row.
2229.32s:  My bad.
2230.64s:  Wrong row.
2232.80s:  Want this row.
2236.28s:  And what I'm going to format it as like this.
2238.44s:  So we'll do conditional formatting.
2244.12s:  And the plan is we can set it so that if this is for the put side, if the lower range for
2253.44s:  the put is higher, then our expected or in this case, our strike, then we like that.
2263.52s:  If that's not the case, then it would we would color code it red.
2268.64s:  Right?
2269.64s:  Does that make sense?
2270.84s:  So what then I can do is I can as I'm manually inputting data for what's coming up this
2277.24s:  week, there's a bunch of usable data that's being populated for me as I'm moving along.
2284.92s:  So in this case, that's just letting me see based on the expected move, like the average
2291.96s:  or the current expected move, our my strikes for the shorts outside the range.
2299.04s:  And that's kind of really important because if they're not, that doesn't necessarily mean
2305.60s:  you don't take the trade, but it definitely means there needs to be a pretty good reason
2311.68s:  why we would take that trade because there could be another trade that looks even better
2318.36s:  for whatever reason.
2320.60s:  So that's the next step that would go into there.
2324.80s:  I just don't want this getting like too noisy too fast.
2330.16s:  This would be when we do the actual close.
2337.72s:  So then what we do is whatever the exit is less the entry divided by the entry.
2348.12s:  And then we would do if his blank.
2359.68s:  So if this is, oh, because it just grabbed the see from me, I was wondering what happened.
2370.76s:  So if this is blank, then I don't want this to put anything in there.
2377.68s:  If it is not blank, I want it to give me this.
2383.40s:  I think I put it extra parenthesis.
2386.68s:  No, what am I doing wrong?
2394.84s:  I did have an extra parenthesis.
2396.24s:  It was in the front.
2398.16s:  Now, it's still giving me a problem.
2402.36s:  What's your ish?
2406.60s:  His blank.
2412.92s:  This is missing a parenthesis.
2415.92s:  Priced.
2416.92s:  Amateur hour.
2417.92s:  If that's blank, I want that.
2420.12s:  If it's not blank, this.
2424.72s:  There we go.
2429.76s:  Perfect.
2431.60s:  Credit received super simple premium times lots times one.
2442.92s:  As a dollar.
2444.68s:  That little bit of room.
2448.64s:  The debit will be simple.
2451.04s:  It will be the exit premium times lots times 100.
2461.24s:  That can set as a zero for now.
2462.96s:  We don't have to create any formula at that.
2465.48s:  The P and L will obviously be our credit.
2468.80s:  I'm going to do plus the debit because what we will format it as the debits will be negative
2476.92s:  numbers.
2477.92s:  Okay, so that's the CLSK trade on.
2482.28s:  I think there's also ZS.
2484.76s:  If I'm not mistaken on the same day, I'm pretty sure there was two for the Monday.
2489.68s:  ZS.
2501.68s:  Right now it's pre-buffering.
2502.68s:  That's why it's moving a little bit slow.
2505.52s:  Okay, cool.
2508.52s:  So now we can start filling in our basic data.
2511.60s:  So 2D stock price right now is 208.34.
2515.56s:  Now this is a great example of how this sheet might have to evolve and I'll show you how
2521.12s:  and why.
2522.56s:  So the expected move for D's was 9.4%.
2529.56s:  And the average expected move was 10.2%.
2539.56s:  And I realized that we should have average realized volatility.
2552.60s:  And this is 10.1, 10.2%.
2560.28s:  I didn't bother going back and adding it to that yet.
2567.48s:  So then we can take a look at this is incorrect because that's based on you can so for the
2578.28s:  implied volatility edge here, there's a lot of different ways you can slice this and
2583.04s:  you'll find that different versions are more helpful.
2586.72s:  You can look at what the implied volatility edge is relative to IV.
2591.56s:  You can take a look at the implied volatility edge relative to realized volatility.
2596.96s:  It's really up to you and what you like to see.
2601.80s:  So what you can do to kind of capture both of this, you could do IV by average IV.
2613.96s:  And then you could do IV by average RV, right?
2619.28s:  So that we can get a sense this should be those two, well, it's not average.
2626.12s:  We're doing just a straight ratio.
2628.28s:  So average less.
2633.72s:  So then this would be the expected move less the average realized move.
2641.60s:  And then for CLSK, that was 14.1 is the realized, realized what I was doing 11.6 is the average.
2654.96s:  14.1% here.
2663.64s:  So now you can track how you compare to the average IV.
2668.84s:  You can compare how you track to the average realize volatility.
2673.64s:  And again, I would do the same formatting, just like we did on the other one.
2678.32s:  I'm just not going to bother.
2680.52s:  Move all this down.
2683.36s:  And normally what I would do for stuff like this is I want to make it, I like to make
2692.96s:  these kind of clean.
2695.40s:  So what I'll do is I'll do a lot of if playing formulas for stuff like this, I'm just not
2701.28s:  going to go through and do that now.
2704.24s:  So let's take a look at ZS.
2709.40s:  And of the past 12, we see one, two, three, four, four of the past 12 exceeded 60s.
2724.36s:  And then this will be short put delta, maybe we stick around like a 10 delta to start 10
2732.20s:  delta here.
2735.20s:  So 10 delta on the put side puts us at 180.
2743.24s:  On the call side that 10 delta puts us at 245.
2751.52s:  And then we collect 2.3.
2754.88s:  So one of the things I want you to notice is how you see when you finish setting up the
2761.76s:  actual data on the other side, it takes a little time to set it up up front.
2767.40s:  But once it's set up, it's really not that heavy to maintain.
2771.88s:  It's actually quite easy to maintain.
2776.12s:  And what I mean by that is like for me to fill this in didn't take me long at all.
2780.72s:  It definitely took me less than a minute, especially if I wasn't flipping back between
2784.28s:  CLS and this is giving me most of what I want to see right out of the gate.
2790.68s:  I can already see what the ranges are.
2796.00s:  So again, we want to compare these ranges.
2798.60s:  The downside range is 188.76 compared to the put side is 180.
2803.00s:  So that's good.
2804.44s:  And then for the high side ranges 227 and it's 245 here.
2809.48s:  So that looks good.
2810.48s:  So let's finish this process.
2831.20s:  We'll do it for the whole column.
2841.20s:  And then let's do format conditional.
2851.36s:  So for the put side, we want this to be bigger than what is this for the put side J 11.
2870.48s:  I don't know how to use this one.
2889.96s:  Let's see if perplexity can help.
2896.04s:  I want to highlight the U 11 using J 11.
2906.60s:  If higher if U 11 is higher, make it green, if not red.
2917.84s:  I'm still getting used to Google Sheets compared to Excel.
2923.72s:  Oh, so you just had to add that's super easy.
2937.08s:  And then let me test this really quick.
2938.56s:  Let's do 100.
2940.08s:  Yeah, okay.
2941.08s:  Worked great.
2942.08s:  Beautiful.
2943.08s:  Easy as.
2946.76s:  So then we'll do the same thing just that we can eyeball it.
2957.28s:  And then let's test that again real quick.
2959.40s:  100.
2960.40s:  Yeah, perfect.
2961.92s:  So then I would do the same thing on this side.
2966.08s:  So in this case, it's kind of the natural inverse.
2971.80s:  So in this case, we want W 11.
2981.28s:  And compared to our strike, we want this to be less than our strike, which is in L 11.
2993.96s:  So that's good news bears.
2996.36s:  I grabbed that a little faster.
3000.08s:  And then we do the same thing, but flip it.
3005.68s:  And when you flip it and reverse it, then it's bad news bears.
3008.68s:  So let's double check this.
3010.76s:  So let's say that we had 220.
3013.92s:  Yeah, perfect.
3016.00s:  Good.
3017.00s:  So there are our conditional formulas.
3023.52s:  So that you can eyeball pretty stuff.
3034.16s:  Hater says, yeah, this isn't dividing by 12.
3036.72s:  This is just of the last 12.
3039.44s:  I'm just making it shorter.
3044.32s:  Because if I do like of last, it wastes a ton of this column.
3050.20s:  And I don't like doing wrapped columns.
3053.80s:  So I'm just making it this.
3058.96s:  It could be maybe this is equally short, something like that less confusing for you guys.
3064.52s:  Yeah.
3065.52s:  Cool.
3066.52s:  So all our formulas are on trade is on.
3072.48s:  I think we just need to fast forward to tomorrow now.
3076.00s:  When we double check that any of these Tuesday trades were not before the open.
3082.08s:  So I'm going to come out of on demand for a second.
3084.84s:  I'm going to go to not that when it gets its act together.
3090.64s:  We're going to go to the calendar and we need to see here we go.
3096.48s:  So this was on the second.
3100.24s:  Why is this shit off fucked up?
3104.84s:  This is all.
3106.84s:  This is super annoying.
3116.84s:  I mean, I guess this stuff is fun, but they change this.
3121.28s:  It's kind of annoying.
3124.28s:  Oops.
3128.28s:  CLSK ZS they're after the market and then let's see if any of these are before the market.
3133.00s:  Yeah.
3134.00s:  CLC E's before the market.
3141.36s:  So we got to put that one on.
3147.20s:  So that's the only other one that has to go on now.
3149.04s:  Great.
3150.04s:  So now we go back.
3152.44s:  Back into the past.
3154.12s:  And then we do PLCE.
3164.00s:  Take a peak.
3167.00s:  I'm going to pop my win.
3170.00s:  We had a warm day today here in SoCal.
3180.00s:  It was like 75.
3184.00s:  I imagine up in L, well, depending on where in LAUR, it might have been even warmer there.
3188.00s:  No.
3190.00s:  CLC E was at 15.9.
3194.00s:  The expected move was 22.3.
3202.00s:  The average expected move, 12.7.
3208.00s:  Oh, no, this is going to.
3212.00s:  This is going to be terrible.
3219.00s:  The expected move or two is 22.3.
3224.00s:  Average expected move was 12.7.
3226.00s:  So obviously they're expecting something big.
3229.00s:  Average realized 17.7.
3231.00s:  Of the past 12 realized exceeded on 12345.
3240.00s:  I would say five.
3242.00s:  Expiration will be 60s.
3245.00s:  And let's take a look.
3248.00s:  These options are straight trash.
3250.00s:  So there would be no trade here for me at all.
3254.00s:  But let's just pretend we look at the nine delta.
3261.00s:  Just so that we can track the move.
3264.00s:  0.09.
3266.00s:  And that per point one zero.
3268.00s:  My bad, that puts us out of nine.
3270.00s:  Point one, which is a nine.
3273.00s:  And then on the short call of point one is the 20.
3276.00s:  1 is the 20.
3279.00s:  One.
3280.00s:  I'm not even worried about the premium or anything
3282.00s:  because there would be no trade.
3284.00s:  So one of the things that you'll notice here is as I'm looking at this
3289.00s:  and building the move and whatnot.
3292.00s:  Notice how I said when I looked at it, there's no trade.
3296.00s:  It's too liquid.
3297.00s:  That doesn't mean I can't track it.
3299.00s:  That doesn't mean it's not a serviceable data point.
3302.00s:  I mean that there's nothing for me to learn from it.
3305.00s:  Now, once you get your feet under you and you're not kind of like
3309.00s:  aren't learning the earnings landscape.
3311.00s:  Yeah, I wouldn't waste literally any time with something that's not
3316.00s:  tradable because I'm actually going to build a relationship with stuff
3319.00s:  that I trade.
3320.00s:  But in the beginning, when you're building a data set just to understand
3323.00s:  how these things move, that's there's nothing that falls into that bucket.
3326.00s:  It's worth your time to at least see how it moves.
3328.00s:  It doesn't take that long.
3330.00s:  So now let's go to three December and I'm going to fast forward now to zero
3335.00s:  seven thirty.
3337.00s:  I'm going to give it an hour for volatility to come out.
3341.00s:  Now again, this is applying a broad brushstroke in entire hour.
3346.00s:  You can pick all different kinds of times that you might want to exit.
3350.00s:  And if I was enterprising, I would include different exit times here for me to test.
3358.00s:  Do I want to try exiting 15 minutes after the open five minutes after the open
3362.00s:  30 minutes after the open 45 or an hour?
3365.00s:  Whatever time do I want to wait until the end of the next day?
3369.00s:  It's entirely up to you to pick now of general starting point.
3374.00s:  I would argue is after 15 minutes and sometime before three hours.
3380.00s:  Because in that time frame, you're starting to take on a different risk,
3385.00s:  which is like the continuation of the earnings move and stuff like that.
3390.00s:  So Mike says five Celsius, which is 41 Fahrenheit, I much prefer your temperature hands down.
3397.00s:  I do not like warm.
3399.00s:  So we're normally when Mel and I travel, we literally go like we go to places that don't have warmer temperature.
3406.00s:  Like unless I'm diving, if I'm scuba diving, which I love, which is funny,
3410.00s:  because that's always in the fucking tropics where there's like good scuba diving.
3414.00s:  Typically dying unless I'm in the water.
3417.00s:  But I guess that's also kind of perfect because if you scuba dive somewhere in like the Caribbean a lot
3421.00s:  and you're in the water a lot like I am, your body temperature naturally lower.
3425.00s:  So you actually run pretty cool and the warm feels not bad.
3428.00s:  But other like barring that I run way too warm.
3432.00s:  That's why we go to places like Iceland, Alaska, like I'm trying to get the fuck out of the heat.
3437.00s:  I do not like that is that warm right now.
3441.00s:  But all right, let's see, let's see how things go here.
3445.00s:  So PLCE was at 13195.
3448.00s:  This would be 3Ds in the example.
3453.00s:  3Ds, 3Ds.
3455.00s:  Stock price here is 13.195.
3461.00s:  Premium doesn't matter.
3467.00s:  So then the other thing that we can do is we could add another column
3476.00s:  to check exit price relative to entry prices or to your strikes.
3484.00s:  So this would be, I don't know which way I want to do it yet.
3489.00s:  Let's see.
3490.00s:  So let's eyeball this.
3492.00s:  So we can do for the put side.
3499.00s:  We want to see if it's greater and then by how much.
3502.00s:  So we'll do stock less our strike for the put side.
3508.00s:  So this would be stock less put strike.
3514.00s:  And then for the call side inverse.
3518.00s:  So this would be our call less not equals less stock.
3525.00s:  So this would be all less strike less.
3533.00s:  So this will show us our gap for our option.
3539.00s:  So now the conditional formatting here would be really simple.
3545.00s:  We would essentially just do if this is greater than zero, then it's green.
3550.00s:  If it's less than zero, it's it's not green that's bad.
3553.00s:  I don't have a premium in here.
3555.00s:  It doesn't matter for this example, because there's no trade just wanted to track it.
3558.00s:  So ZS, let's take a look.
3560.00s:  Let's see how things went in ZS.
3562.00s:  Now this does matter because just because the stock landed in our zone.
3567.00s:  It doesn't mean it's profitable depending on what volatility did.
3570.00s:  So we actually absolutely will need to track the premium in here to see essentially how we fared.
3579.00s:  So ZS was at two 120 to a 1.2.
3588.00s:  And I'm realizing that this format needs to apply to everything.
3595.00s:  And we need to take a look at what did we have?
3600.00s:  We had the 180s to 45s for $2.30.
3604.00s:  So the 180s and 240 fs.
3606.00s:  So the 180s and the 240 fives.
3610.00s:  An hour after the open they're trading for 13 cents.
3613.00s:  So let's say we exit there minus 0.13.
3619.00s:  And now we have our first full complete trade.
3621.00s:  Now let's take a look at CLSK CLSK.
3625.00s:  We do the same thing.
3627.00s:  We take a look at the stock price and CLSK which is 13 6286.
3632.00s:  13 6286.
3635.00s:  You don't have to type in all that it literally doesn't matter.
3637.00s:  I would just round this.
3639.00s:  Just doing it just cause copy and whatever is there like a fucking parrot.
3644.00s:  And we had the 11 and a half 20 and a half.
3649.00s:  So 11 and a half, 1 and a half.
3656.00s:  Six cents minus 0.06.
3661.00s:  This is it.
3664.00s:  That's all I got.
3665.00s:  This is literally the process.
3667.00s:  And you literally just do this for everything that's there.
3671.00s:  And by the end of this, you'll have a sense of how things worked.
3676.00s:  Now a couple admin notes with respect to doing this.
3681.00s:  I would be as efficient as humanly possible.
3686.00s:  So what that means is if I'm taking the time to click through on demand,
3692.00s:  you'll notice that it takes a few seconds to load each time.
3696.00s:  I can absorb a lot of data if I'm efficient.
3702.00s:  So what that means is I can have one variation of this that is using 10
3707.00s:  deltas.
3708.00s:  I can have another variation of this that's using 15 delta.
3711.00s:  I can have another variation that's using 20 delta.
3713.00s:  If I'm so inclined, whatever you feel like.
3716.00s:  And you don't have to do a million of them,
3719.00s:  but you can get a really good sense using a few of them.
3723.00s:  And by doing that, you increase your efficiency massively.
3728.00s:  Because then as you fast forward time and you see what happened,
3732.00s:  rather than just looking at the 11 and a half and the 12 and a half,
3736.00s:  maybe I'll have one for the 11 and the 20 and so on and so forth,
3739.00s:  whatever aligns with those deltas.
3741.00s:  And then I can compare all of them in mass.
3746.00s:  That's all there is to it.
3747.00s:  It's literally just data mining.
3749.00s:  It's just work.
3751.00s:  But after you complete this kind of work, you can learn a lot about
3756.00s:  what things make sense.
3757.00s:  What deltas generally seem to work, you can get more sophisticated
3762.00s:  and you can say, well, maybe I changed my deltas based on the IV,
3769.00s:  IV edge, the implied volatility compared to the average implied volatility.
3775.00s:  Maybe if that's a bigger edge, I care about that, or maybe you create
3780.00s:  a composite metric that takes the standard deviation of all of the individual
3787.00s:  data points that I showed you.
3789.00s:  And you compare that against your IV to then adjust what deltas and strikes
3795.00s:  also your position size.
3797.00s:  Again, you don't have to get into that upfront.
3799.00s:  That's like future state.
3800.00s:  That's next step stuff.
3802.00s:  But I want you to be aware of these things so that you have some ideas
3806.00s:  on what it can progress into what to look for.
3809.00s:  But in the beginning, you can see like if you follow something
3813.00s:  generally similar to this, it's not so bad.
3817.00s:  Now, what I do want to do really quick before we wrap up,
3819.00s:  and then I'm going to take a bit of a break before we do the GME live stream.
3823.00s:  But I actually want to cherry pick one of these that went really bad
3827.00s:  so that we can see what that looks like.
3829.00s:  So let's see if we can find one from this list.
3831.00s:  I'm just moving it over here so that I can flip through them fast.
3835.00s:  And we can find one that went terribly.
3837.00s:  CRM, how'd you do?
3839.00s:  We could try CRM.
3840.00s:  That one looks okay to start with.
3842.00s:  How did Octodew?
3844.00s:  That one's not bad enough.
3846.00s:  MRVL.
3848.00s:  95 to 115.
3850.00s:  That's a big move.
3852.00s:  The LTR.
3854.00s:  No way.
3855.00s:  That's a good one.
3856.00s:  CHWY.
3857.00s:  No, that's a good one.
3859.00s:  AEO.
3860.00s:  Ooh, that's a...
3864.00s:  That's a big drop.
3866.00s:  DHPT.
3869.00s:  I like AEO.
3872.00s:  So AEO before the move,
3877.00s:  they must have been after the market, yeah.
3880.00s:  Or before it doesn't matter.
3885.00s:  Okay, so they closed.
3887.00s:  Let's just, I'm going to eyeball this really fast.
3890.00s:  They closed at 2054.
3893.00s:  Oops.
3896.00s:  And then this stock,
3898.00s:  I'm just using the open for the next day to eyeball,
3901.00s:  which one we want to look at, 17.3.
3903.00s:  So it's a 15% drop,
3921.00s:  which funny enough PLCE was a bigger move than that.
3924.00s:  We said, not CRM, but Octa,
3927.00s:  330 to 360.
3929.00s:  That's like 10%.
3930.00s:  So we can skip that one.
3932.00s:  MRVL was another pretty big one.
3936.00s:  MRVL, you closed at 9591.
3944.00s:  9591.
3946.00s:  And then where did you get to here?
3950.00s:  Opened at 112.
3953.00s:  It was like a 16% move.
3956.00s:  So we can use MRVL.
3958.00s:  MRVL I think would be a good example also because it's exhibited
3964.00s:  like a pretty big move to the upside.
3968.00s:  And the upside tends to be priced a little less rich,
3972.00s:  but it'll be compensated by for the downside.
3975.00s:  So MRVL,
3976.00s:  so I'm not going to worry about the dates and all this shit.
3979.00s:  I'm just going to throw this in super fast so that we can see.
3982.00s:  OK, so the expected move is 8.6%.
3985.00s:  This is a great example.
3986.00s:  The average expected move is 8.6 with very low deviation,
3992.00s:  as I look at it, which is very interesting.
3994.00s:  10.3% of the past 12.
3998.00s:  There's one, two, three, four, five, six instances that we moved outside.
4005.00s:  So we're going to look at 60s.
4008.00s:  And let's build us a trade.
4018.00s:  Except I forgot where what days is this the third after the close.
4025.00s:  This is good.
4027.00s:  Third after the close.
4029.00s:  So let's go to end of day 12.
4033.00s:  45.
4038.00s:  And then let's grab some option.
4041.00s:  Just scooting this out of the way so I can move a little quicker.
4047.00s:  See what we got.
4050.00s:  So 10.
4055.00s:  So 10 delta.
4058.00s:  Wow, this is like super not rich.
4061.00s:  That's crazy.
4068.00s:  Fucking shocker.
4069.00s:  The fucking options market is telling you what's going to happen.
4073.00s:  That's hilarious.
4074.00s:  That fucking love options.
4079.00s:  It literally tells you what's going to happen before it happens.
4082.00s:  It's like a premonition.
4085.00s:  Now I say that definitively knowing what happened.
4087.00s:  So part of it isn't just but the market was pricing this move.
4090.00s:  Like there's no doubt my mind.
4091.00s:  That's an objective fact.
4094.00s:  110.
4096.00s:  We'll do a one lot.
4098.00s:  And at the 84 110 84 110.
4102.00s:  You got a dollar for one.
4106.00s:  Okay.
4108.00s:  So let's fast forward to tomorrow.
4111.00s:  The 4th of December.
4114.00s:  And let's see.
4117.00s:  For these.
4120.00s:  And then we need to change this to like 0 7 30.
4125.00s:  Now we're after the open.
4128.00s:  And let's see what this is running for.
4131.00s:  So this is something that moves 16.
4133.00s:  0.78% on an 8.6% expected move.
4138.00s:  Very, very interesting.
4140.00s:  Very, very interesting.
4143.00s:  Both our.
4148.00s:  Both our put in our call.
4151.00s:  Put with safe call was not safe.
4154.00s:  So this literally would have been a no trade.
4158.00s:  So if you take a look again, I'm just using the data from before.
4161.00s:  But if you take a look at this.
4164.00s:  The put had a massive buffer.
4166.00s:  The call did not have a massive buffer.
4169.00s:  The call actually was projected to be in the money.
4172.00s:  From our rudimentary system here.
4175.00s:  So this we would have closed out for 793.
4186.00s:  So I want to give you this because I didn't want to have just all winning trades in here by happenstance.
4191.00s:  That sets the rolling expectations.
4193.00s:  Now what I can show you is that your net P and L is not so bad.
4198.00s:  So you absolutely are down money.
4202.00s:  You're down 456 bucks.
4204.00s:  But you also had something that literally had a double expected move that straight up gave you warning ahead of time in a few different instances.
4212.00s:  So we chose to ignore to put the trade on for the sake of the example.
4215.00s:  And this is the process of just getting a relationship with trading earnings, understanding how stuff can move.
4222.00s:  And then positioning things smartly so that you don't end up in this scenario unnecessarily.
4227.00s:  It will happen. It objectively will happen.
4229.00s:  This reinforces the point of having to size things carefully more than anything.
4233.00s:  You're never going to be able to not have losses.
4235.00s:  It is a part of the game.
4236.00s:  But what I can tell you is that again, like this would have been a no trade here because of this condition right here.
4242.00s:  The fact that even based on the implied move.
4246.00s:  We were going to be in the money.
4247.00s:  That means you have no buffer whatsoever.
4250.00s:  If the realized move is bigger than the implied that's unacceptable on an earnings trade.
4254.00s:  That's just bad risk.
4255.00s:  So as always, if there's any questions, hit you boy up.
4258.00s:  I'll see you guys at least for the apes out there.
4260.00s:  I'll see you on the GME live stream in an hour.
4262.00s:  Be an outlier.
4263.00s:  See you all later.
4266.00s:  You
