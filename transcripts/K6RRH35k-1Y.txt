422.00s: you
450.00s: Why 8% to 10%? Great question. It's because this is the long-term market average.
456.56s: So, one of the things I think makes a lot of sense for a new trader is first be greater than zero,
462.28s: focus on the process. Then once you are able to be greater than zero,
467.12s: we want to start scaling ultimately to where we want to land.
471.88s: So, let's say our ultimate target is 20% per year, whatever.
476.12s: Well, going from zero to 20 is a big jump. So, a really great interim step is to see if you can
484.32s: paste the market. And a big thing that I would be looking for in pacing the market is can I do it
490.88s: with lower risk? And this is a measure by volatility. So, what I mean by this is if the stock market
502.20s: returns 8.5% on that year. However, you return 8.2%. I wouldn't inherently consider this a miss.
511.08s: I would then say what was the max drawdown of this version versus this version,
519.32s: which gives me a simple risk-adjusted performance metric. You could use sharp sortino, whatever makes
528.80s: you happy. This is just essentially a very base version. But it gives a super important context.
536.96s: Because if we do this, let's say this had a 12% max drawdown and let's say that we had a 9% max drawdown,
544.08s: well, this is actually quite a bit better. I'll take this one over this one for sure. So, that's the
550.56s: broader idea here. So, now, we know what our target is going to be to start, which will be this
558.32s: metric here. So, this is our first thing we need to answer. The second thing we need to answer is
564.32s: risk tolerance. The risk tolerance for a $5,000 account is pretty simple, I think. There's no
576.16s: worlds where you will be able to pursue a really strong return without having a pretty large risk
584.96s: profile in front of you. The reason for this is because when we look at the market and we look at
594.00s: building a portfolio, there's going to be a ton of limitations that you have that you simply
600.40s: have to accept. So, trying to define risk tolerance as the 30% max drawdown is unrealistic.
607.20s: It's probably not going to happen. So, in the case of a really small portfolio, the way that I
612.48s: mentally would bucket it as if like this is the total risk, I wouldn't trade that way. But I would
618.56s: prepare my mind to lose this entire amount. The reason why I'm saying that is because if you think
624.40s: of that and you're like, oh, shit, I don't want to lose the 5K, then that tells me we might need to
629.20s: take some of this out, put it into something else, and then trade with the residual. With a small
634.72s: account, you kind of have to be prepared to lose that account. It doesn't have to happen. In my opinion,
640.80s: I don't think you need to go that route, but it happens in most instances. So, to deny that or to
647.76s: not at least acknowledge that as a potential route to me is just a complete mistake. So, our
654.64s: risk tolerance instead, we know 30% probably isn't going to cut it. So, maybe we target something
660.16s: like 50%. So, this will be a 50% max drawdown. So, that means our 5K account would be looking like
666.88s: $2,500. That essentially serves as the portfolio level circuit breaker.
675.76s: So, now we would need to figure out what kind of strategies and stuff we want to put in the
679.84s: portfolio. We're just going to do that live because I don't want to waste too much time on the
684.56s: planning stuff, although I will continually remind everybody that's the bulk of the work we do
689.68s: here as traders as planned. So, I don't want to skip over that without making sure that that's known.
696.00s: We're just going to spend a little more time on the practical execution component here. So,
702.08s: when I think of strategies in account this size, I'm going to be, again, this is if I were
708.96s: personally doing this, like you saw me in the SmallStacks account, I'm using stuff like Cover
713.52s: Trangles, Ratio Diagnoles, Verticals. And then Long Options, that's kind of it. Like, that's
726.24s: going to be the majority of this thing. And really, I consider Long Options in this bucket here
732.00s: because most trades that I would put on in the context of a Long Option is mostly in the context
737.44s: of it can turn into a diagonal if I so choose. So, this is kind of it. So, now if I were to try to
745.68s: think about splitting out my portfolio as I typically would, there's core,
750.40s: in speculative allocations. And there's a couple of different ways to do this. We all know the way
756.64s: that I typically prefer to trade this kind of thing for core is in some sort of index ETF,
763.92s: which we'll have to talk about because that's going to be difficult for a small account to come
769.36s: up with a Covered Strangle. Might not be able to do it. For the core allocation, it might need to be
776.88s: done via a Ratio Diagnol. The Covered Strangle just might not be accessible yet. We'll have to see
782.48s: what we see. We'll let me go back in time. And then the speculative will be trading things like
787.44s: where you're used to seeing me talk about, right? So, running through Earning Cycles, taking a look at
792.88s: directional opportunities based on momentum, trying to all, you know, this sort of stuff.
798.72s: So, let me take a pause here. And Thor is slinking towards the door. So, I'm going to let him out,
804.32s: but perfect timing because I wanted to ask you, are there any questions on what we've covered so far
811.76s: on the build out on the methodology on the broad approach that I'm talking about? Are there any
816.24s: questions that we have up to this point? Let me open the door.
823.60s: Or do we generally feel okay, okay, so Lauren's good. Chase is good, beautiful. Great.
835.36s: Love it. So, let's, I'm going to clear this stuff off. I'll take a screenshot before I do that,
841.76s: just so that we have it.
852.88s: I just want to keep this for our references we go through this.
874.80s: And I'll add this here.
883.84s: Cool. And then this stuff we can kill.
890.08s: Okay. So, we are, we're good. Next step, we need to start thinking about what kind of stuff
899.28s: we're going to be able to trade. And this is where things are going to start getting annoying
903.44s: right out of the gate. So, the thing that we need to solve for right, right to start is what kind
913.52s: of stocks are even remotely accessible or something like a coverage triangle or a ratio diagonal.
924.40s: Either of those kind of things will be a little bit challenging to find. And again, that's the
930.08s: nature of trading with a small account. We'll figure something out. Now, what I wanted to do is
936.88s: start. Maybe we could do like 2023 something like that. It depends. I feel okay. So, we could do 2022,
946.88s: which is has a pretty big drawdown. 2022 was down 19%.
959.28s: 23 was up 23. 2020 was up 18. 2020 was a little bit anomalous.
965.60s: Kind of think of like a good representative year. The better stress test would be in like 22.
972.72s: But that almost requires a completely different methodology and approach. So, I don't necessarily want
979.12s: to base this entire scenario off of that adaptation. Like, that's a completely different thing that
986.24s: we would have to build out. So, my inclination is to use 22. The other reason I'm not going
992.00s: further back in time is because on demand has limitations in terms of like the ability to
997.12s: populate data. So, I don't want to go back too far because then everything in there starts to get
1002.16s: really wonky. So, we'll start with 22. In the context of 22, we know we have hindsight bias
1010.64s: going into this because we know 22 is an up year. Nonetheless, the ability for us to like
1017.52s: tinker with this approach, I still think we'll hold absolutely fine. So, let's do that. So,
1024.16s: we'll focus on 22. So, the first thing we'll do is literally just hop in the good old time portal
1031.36s: here and we'll go back in time. And I'll take us back to 23. January 1st, the beginning of the year.
1048.64s: This is good. So, this is after the market had sold off a bit coming from
1057.84s: 22 bear market. So, now we're able to start looking at some ideas. Now, the first thing
1070.96s: that we need to figure out is like what kind of stuff is even accessible to us with respect to
1077.92s: trying to trade a coverage triangle or a ratio diagonal. Now, the way that I would do this is I
1084.24s: would conduct a scan. Now, I don't know if scanning works. It doesn't. So, scanning does not work in
1091.36s: on demand, unfortunately. So, maybe we could just poke through the watch list and see if anything
1098.96s: because this looks like it's updating effectively. And maybe we can find some stuff here.
1113.68s: I'm trying to see if Ibit was actually like tradable then.
1119.20s: Because I think Ibit just got launched. Yeah, so that's no good. I think some sort of Bitcoin
1129.28s: proxy would be nice though. What was QLD? 34. Okay, so these will be okay. So, QLD will be okay.
1142.88s: TQs. Literally, this will probably where we'll go. So, TQs will serve as the base for a
1154.72s: coverage triangle. This is based more on price. And this is in like if you see TQs below 20 bucks,
1163.12s: I'm interested effectively no matter what because the risk there is pretty contained.
1167.52s: So, this would allow us to trade effectively an entire coverage triangle on it with the caveat
1176.56s: that if we want to get into shares, we can't let it run too far. So, I would start with shares to
1183.68s: begin the position. So, let's start building what this portfolio might actually look like.
1191.28s: And I'm going to grab this.
1201.68s: This way we can have an actual look at the whole portfolio.
1213.92s: This we don't need.
1221.52s: This stuff we don't really need.
1232.40s: This doesn't matter. This doesn't matter.
1237.84s: These don't really matter.
1242.56s: Okay.
1242.96s: So, let's start with the stuff that matters. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to break,
1254.88s: I'm going to actually break this down so that it's easier for us to see like what we're doing.
1261.28s: But our first position will start with the core allocation.
1267.36s: The core allocation in the context of this portfolio should get most of the money.
1272.96s: And I would, especially if it's something in like this, I would look to give it maybe 70%
1279.92s: ish of the total money. So, we're looking at a $5,000 account.
1290.48s: So, we've got $5,000.
1295.52s: This is what we'll start with. Then we can take a look at our allocations.
1320.72s: And again, this is, I wouldn't use this as as law yet.
1328.88s: I would simply use this as a starting point. No more, no less.
1334.48s: So, now we know loosely, again, to start what allocation of the portfolio is going to get what?
1355.04s: Most of this will obviously go into a coverage strangle here. Probably a little bit more because
1361.20s: in order for us to do a too lot, we would need to use 1672 upfront for the first purchase,
1368.24s: which is what we'll do. And then to be able to sell a put, we'll need a little bit more.
1374.24s: So, in the context here, it'll be 3, Jan. I'm not going to worry about putting in the year because
1380.00s: it doesn't matter that much. Stock prices at 1672, this will be starting just 100 shares.
1391.20s: And there's no expiration on that. The basis is going to be 1672.
1404.80s: So, we can calculate the cost for this. You can automate all this stuff in a log, by the way.
1413.04s: I'm not bothering to hear just because it's a little faster to run it quickly.
1418.80s: But all I would do is have a space, frustrated, quickly, quickly run through these.
1431.04s: And it would be kind of like this. But I mean, this we could literally just do the math, right?
1440.00s: This for this kind of trade, we know that the margin requirement is effectively going to be
1447.04s: the total cost. And with the sake of the coverage triangle, in this case, where we're not applying
1453.68s: necessarily a momentum following approach, we define the risk as the entire size of the position.
1463.20s: So, this will be the first, the first that goes on.
1466.56s: So, I'm not going to worry about cost. Actually, we will worry about cost.
1479.04s: Yeah, we will worry about cost. So, this will be 1672.
1485.04s: The reason why I'm worrying about cost here is because it doesn't make a difference in this
1489.84s: context, but other positions it will. And then this kind of stuff doesn't really matter.
1497.20s: I don't care about days, expiration. We can get rid of all that for now.
1503.52s: Okay. All right. So, we have the very first position that we'll put on. And then let's add two more.
1520.32s: We will need the strike price.
1527.76s: We will need delta.
1531.92s: So, this obviously won't have those. Okay. Now, let's see if we can find a put in here that will work.
1539.04s: I'm going to move this out of the way for now. And let's take a look at what we can find.
1552.64s: This is an old, let me just reset this. Nothing's in here. We'll go to 17 Feb.
1569.44s: So, in 17 Feb,
1578.40s: we'll be able to get the 15s. Those are going to be a 30 delta.
1587.68s: And the way that I would do this is like a 15 put premium.
1593.84s: Let's call it a dollar 20 whenever doing this and you're effectively simulating options,
1602.00s: positions like paper trading this way. One of the things to always keep in mind is you should
1607.76s: be giving yourself unfavorable fills pretty much always. So, you can see that it's bid 119 offered
1618.24s: 124. You could realistically likely get a better fill than that, but I'm not going to bother.
1625.28s: What I'm going to do is position myself so that I at least am looking at this in the more likely
1634.48s: context of what it likely would look like. That's the way that I'm thinking about it.
1640.72s: So, for the rest of these, we'll calculate the stuff from here.
1647.92s: So, we know the margin, 1519.
1656.08s: And for the cost, this will be, I'm going to do the math in this one since most of these will be
1663.44s: options going forward. So, we'll have size, premium, 100. So, this just represents what we're
1673.36s: taking in. The way that I would run this kind of log is these would be negative.
1679.20s: If it's money out, so the premium on this one, I would run it this way so that I know that this
1690.16s: is a debit. I didn't bother doing the math on this one simply because
1699.28s: the stock transactions different for those that are wondering, oh shit, for those that are
1704.48s: wondering a way that you can do this, that's pretty efficient is you can just set different if
1711.52s: then rules for your cost calculation. So, for example, you could say like, if there's a size,
1719.84s: but there's no strike, then this is equity. And this is how you calculate equity, which would be
1726.48s: size times premium. If you guys want to go through that detail, let me know. I'll literally show
1731.68s: you how to do it yourself in like by querying chat you PT so that you can learn how to do it.
1737.28s: If you don't care then that's cool. We just know that you can do that.
1741.76s: All right, percent capture doesn't matter that much.
1746.08s: Stock move will figure out later. Okay, Reese votes for that, which is completely cool. Let's do
1751.68s: that super fast. It really won't take that long. So, I'm grabbing Gemini just because it literally
1756.64s: happens to be up. So, I would tell it in where is this? In Google Sheets,
1768.88s: sell N76. I want to calculate the cost of a position input, but differentiate between options
1784.00s: and equity positions. Write a formula that first checks whether the position is in option or equity
1801.52s: by looking at D 76 to see if it's blank. If not blank, then check F. It doesn't really matter. You
1822.80s: could also use E then check E 76 to see if there's an expiration. If there is no expiration,
1835.12s: it should be classified as an equity position, the cost calculation
1844.96s: is D 76 times H 76. If there is an expiration, it's an option. The cost calculation is D 77
1874.96s: times H 77 times 100.
1885.76s: Pretty much it.
1892.96s: And out of curiosity, I'm going to take this same prompt. I'm going to drop it into chat
1898.56s: GPT because I also have that up. I just want to compare what they give us. You guys know, I typically
1903.84s: like to do this. Ah, see? This is why I like to do it because there are two different things. This
1914.08s: is what chat GPT gave me. And then this is what Gemini gave us. So, let's see. So, it's checking for
1926.56s: blank. This is using different functionality. And this is saying Excel. So, this might be defaulting
1935.12s: to Excel when it shouldn't. But if is blank is still a function in here, which is fine. I actually
1942.72s: like what this came up with better. So, let's jump this in. It should be negative 1672. It is.
1950.24s: If we drag this down, it should be 120. It is. So, the formula works great. Done. Done and done.
1960.40s: Reese says, damn, the advantage of AI is when you know exactly what you need. I meander too much.
1964.96s: So, let's say you didn't know what you need in this scenario. And let's say that you needed to
1972.40s: reason through it like more carefully. Let's do.
1981.52s: It doesn't really matter.
1991.52s: Yeah, there's not like a good example in here to be honest. I was going to do one where like we're
1996.40s: filtering whether it's a put or a call. But let's say that you needed to figure out how to do that.
2002.48s: Here's what I would say. And I'm just going to put it in S. So, in S76, I want to indicate if an
2013.28s: option is a put or a call. In F76, I input the strike followed by C or P.
2028.24s: C for call or P or put. How can I differentiate.
2048.00s: And actually spell differentiate correctly. How can I differentiate if it's a call or put in
2054.96s: S76. And what it'll do is it's just going to use some sort of write formula. That's all. So, it'll pull
2063.68s: from the right. It'll check if it's a C or if it's a P. And then it'll say like if C then call,
2070.24s: if P then put. But we'll see what it gives us. But Reese, that's exactly correct. What you need to do.
2081.52s: Right. So, you can see exactly what we know. Now, what it's doing is what I don't want.
2088.24s: Because it's simply checking only if it's C, which this can give us an issue further down the
2095.12s: line. If we want to do something else, I would make it more specific. I would say I don't want to
2100.96s: just check if it's C. And if it's not C, assume P. I would want it to be check if it's C or check
2108.56s: if it's P and then align both. But it doesn't, it doesn't really matter. The way to think about,
2114.40s: it's so funny. The way to think about prompt engineering, it's literally the same exact thing
2119.52s: is trading. All of the work is done in the prep. So, if you just throw in like lazy, lazy inputs,
2127.12s: the only thing you're doing is making it longer for you to eventually get to where you want to be
2132.56s: anyways. So, the upfront investment in like carefully thinking through what you're trying to do
2137.84s: is pretty much always worth it. Pretty much always worth it. Okay. So, now we have our put on what we
2145.76s: need to do here is calculate how much money is being used. And then we also need to calculate
2153.52s: how much risk is out because as we know, this is going to be a limiting factor,
2167.92s: meaning the number of positions we can actually put on. So, right now, margin and risk are the same
2174.16s: again for the reasons I was explaining before. These are going to be the same because these are
2177.84s: defined as the cash requirement. So, now we need to get and figure out if we want to put our call on
2185.20s: or if not. I actually see that we're a little under invested where as of right now, especially with
2192.40s: a smaller account, I wouldn't want to leave a ton of cash sitting to the side. I would like to keep
2198.48s: a little bit of money sitting to the side if possible. So, what that means to me is I don't
2206.16s: necessarily want this to be $3,500 what I see here. But I also know that I would prefer not to cap
2213.52s: the upside of these options when I sell a call. So, we're going to see if maybe instead of doing
2220.48s: 100, let's see if we do 125. And let's see what that does to our total picture. It puts us
2230.80s: like right on target. So, this is probably what I would do in this scenario. This is suboptimal.
2237.84s: And the way that I would be thinking about this $5,000 portfolio is that if I'm doing what I
2242.40s: should be doing and aggressively saving every month, this should continue to go up. So, that then I
2248.16s: can filter more capital to be able to build into these positions over time. This is just again,
2254.64s: this is the game of trade-offs and this is a pretty big one because you're between a rock and a
2260.00s: hard place. You don't want to use all your money up front and certainly not. But we also do not want
2269.04s: to have capped upside. So, maybe we'll see if we can just do like 110. That takes us to 1839.
2278.16s: That gives us like 150 bucks, which isn't much, but it's something. So, maybe that's what we'll do
2285.12s: instead of doing 125, we'll do 110, something like that. If I were doing this for real,
2294.08s: this is the structure I would use because in my mind next month, I'm going to have more money to
2299.44s: put into the account. That's equally as important as anything else we're doing right now as the
2303.92s: saving component. So, we'll proceed this way. So, now we know that there's another thing we have to
2308.88s: do quickly, which is include our short call. So, let's figure out where our short call is going to be.
2323.92s: And we'll do something like the 21 and we'll get 59 cents.
2331.12s: And is that a 30 delta again, the 25 delta?
2344.40s: And we'll get 59 cents.
2352.88s: The margin for this trade would be blank. There's no margin requirements because
2360.48s: the short call is tied to the rest of the position that you see here. So, there's no additional
2366.16s: margin requirement at all. Okay. So, now a couple other things that I would track
2376.72s: is whether or not these are like what my total debits and credits are.
2382.08s: So, the way that we can do this again, we can grab Gemini or whatever flavor you like.
2390.08s: And again, if you don't want to do the formula, it's super easy. We're going to say in cell N74,
2398.00s: I want to calculate or I want to sum all of the negative numbers from N76 to N.
2412.48s: Let's see what it gives us. I'm going to open the door for Thor.
2428.48s: He's very excited to be here. So, this looks completely correct. So, we'll just dump this in.
2435.28s: Boom, we got our number.
2445.28s: So, now you don't need to ask it again, right? Like, you can reason through what this would be
2455.04s: over here that it needs to be greater than zero. Right? So, the reason why I say that is like,
2461.36s: as you're doing these different formulas and stuff, I wouldn't get to the point where like,
2464.96s: you ask it to do everything. I would still actively be trying to think through it myself
2472.64s: because there's a lot of value in that process. Okay. So, we know so far that our total debits,
2480.96s: like the money that exists out, that we've bought outright is 2090 credit. We have 179
2491.20s: dollars in. So, what we can do is we can figure out what our credits are relative to the total
2498.96s: portfolio size in terms of a return. And we're already at 3.58 percent return, which is massive.
2505.44s: That's a big return. So, again, if we were to annualize 3.58 percent over the course of a month,
2514.96s: 3.58 percent, that's a 52.5 percent return. So, we don't really need to add more risk here,
2523.76s: although we can and we should. So, now let's actually see if Gemini can help us here.
2530.24s: What I want to do is ask it for a list of stocks that are like sub-hundred dollars.
2535.68s: Great. Because that's the hardest thing to do in this scenario is like the active scanning
2539.84s: process that I would do because it's scanning back in time. So, actually, we can just,
2546.64s: I think the watch list will be better for this. Let's use the watch list.
2552.16s: So, we have our first position on. Great. And we're looking for more. So, we should, as always,
2559.04s: go to Ford. Because Ford is like the Toyota Corolla of the stock market, meaning everybody who's
2568.64s: poor trades Ford at some point. And it's just because that's how it goes. So, Ford has had kind of
2576.96s: like this triple bottom. I don't love this broader trend that you're seeing from 22 into 23.
2586.24s: So, this is the kind of thing we're like at least in the beginning. If I were to trade it to the
2592.88s: upside, it would be very, very cautiously. But this is just not what I would pick yet. So, we'll add
2599.52s: this to a watch list. So, let's add, I don't think there's an alert thing. So, we'll have to check back.
2608.16s: We'll have to check back on how it does really above this level. If it starts rallying strong
2614.88s: on volume above 1230, then maybe. So, let's see if we can find other relatively cheap stocks. If
2622.80s: there's stuff that you have in the top of your mind that you think might be decent, let me know.
2628.88s: NLR, this one looks fine enough. Real estate, don't love. Now, what I'm looking for here is
2640.88s: actually stuff to be able to sell some premium in. That's the idea here. XAR, XBI, XRT.
2657.92s: So, right now, I'm just flipping through the watch list looking for stuff that's weak.
2664.72s: Lauren says Ford is boring. Ford is very boring. But what's fun is making money and then using that
2671.92s: money to do stuff you enjoy. So, I will fully grant to you that Ford is boring. It most certainly is.
2686.56s: But I also personally wouldn't care if Ford is boring as I try to remind traders like in the
2696.24s: beginning, the job, the entire goal of what we're doing is to make money. So, yeah, I don't
2704.08s: disagree though. Ford, it's massively boring. Jayden says, S-Y-M.
2713.52s: This is like 12 bucks, okay. So, what do we see here? Then it looks like you guys also mentioned
2721.52s: CCL. So, we can take a look at that as well. I wouldn't short this yet because of this little bit of
2737.44s: a recovery rally. So, we can add this to our watch list. Let's check CCL.
2743.20s: This looks interesting. So, CCL does look a little bit weak here.
2760.32s: But I feel like this post earnings rally. It's a little too early because it kind of held this
2766.96s: support level. So, I would wait here as well probably. Let's check SoFi.
2779.04s: SoFi is kind of interesting and SoFi is also super cheap. SoFi is one of those names where
2784.56s: if we wanted to trade it, this is kind of cool because it doesn't take a ton of money. But I would trade
2793.76s: this to the long side personally. So, I mean, we don't have to do a short. We could do along.
2803.84s: The reason why I like this is because I would consider this a pretty low risk entry. Like, our stop
2809.04s: would be at below 422. So, call it like 415, which is a tiny move relative to where we are.
2815.52s: So, that kind of even though it might look a little bit better to the downside, which I'm not
2819.76s: really convinced that it does right now. It looks like it's mostly consolidating. This I would consider
2825.28s: to be a high probability, but a low risk entry. And I have no idea what SoFi did this year. So,
2832.64s: this will actually kind of a fun experiment. So, let's see if we can build our ratio called
2837.92s: diagonal in here. Something like SoFi. Let's see how it moves.
2849.36s: 1316. What kind of goes through these surges? But they happen pretty fast. 14, 17.
2862.64s: That's two weeks.
2873.36s: Three, almost a month.
2879.36s: Two weeks. Who knows what I'm doing right now? Why am I doing this?
2884.80s: Eight days a week and a half. Why am I bothering doing this? Any guesses?
2899.36s: Chase says no idea, which is fair. It might seem like a strange thing to do.
2905.12s: But there's a reason.
2912.24s: Lauren's got it. Good job, Lauren. That's exactly correct. So, this shirt has like hair
2919.28s: inside of it. So, it's like super itchy. But Lauren is exactly correct. Lauren says DTE. What I'm
2924.96s: doing is I'm trying to get a sense of what DTE makes sense for this thing based on how it moves
2930.08s: and what I can determine for it. So, what I'm noticing is a lot of these big moves are like
2935.44s: pretty explosive, right? This is 20 days. This is a month. So, my expected holding duration for
2942.40s: this wouldn't be super long. Maybe a month and a half if it's long. So, that tells me a lot
2949.60s: about what expiration I would want to go into if I'm maybe planning on holding for like 45 days.
2955.60s: I typically don't like holding long options as they come within 50 days. Definitely, like that's on
2962.40s: the that's on the tight end. So, this one maybe like the one away, but I wouldn't put that on just
2974.56s: yet. Right now it's consolidating. This is another one that I'll add to our watch list. So, we have
2980.96s: Ford on our watch list. We have SoFi on our watch list. This would be for like long calls.
2987.68s: This would be for whatever we can get on and Ford.
2993.28s: So, let's see if there's anything else that immediately looks good. If so, great. If not,
2998.08s: we just add it to the watch list and then we'll fast forward some time.
3002.32s: Let's see.
3008.80s: Betts. Betts is an interesting one. I don't know how liquid.
3016.16s: I don't know how liquid it will be for us.
3022.72s: Why not says did well on SoFi and Rivet? Don't tell me that. I don't want to know what happens.
3027.04s: The whole point of doing this is to fucking figure out what happens as we go.
3032.64s: So, this one is super interesting. This one is also too early to tell. I would trade this
3041.28s: potentially in either direction. It seems like in the longer term, maybe down side, but near term
3048.72s: with this kind of like rally out. It's really hard to say because this looks like some sort of
3054.64s: news driven sell off. I just don't know what. So, nothing sticking out to me here yet.
3065.92s: V and Q. Maybe.
3072.56s: FXE looks really strong. What is this? EWZ. So,
3079.76s: what I'm doing is I'm just trying to get some context for what the market looked like at this
3087.84s: point in time as we're just kind of, you know, for roosing through stuff.
3094.24s: Reese says seeing how quickly it falls, what to prepare for it, that's sort of it. It's not fully
3100.00s: it because, again, part of what I'm doing is I'm intending to use that information to help me
3108.08s: figure out what I might want to do. So, I wouldn't, like that's, I definitely would say that's
3120.72s: part of it, but not like the, not the main part. So, this looks interesting, but again, like when
3132.00s: you see stuff that's falling, when it's coming into these spots, this would be watchless material.
3139.60s: And the reason why it's watchless material is it looks slightly favorable to the downside, right?
3144.96s: Because it broke below this. But now it's really holding this consolidation. It's falling into it,
3151.20s: but I would need to see it below it. So, that I'm going to add to our watch list, EWZ.
3157.36s: And then this would be something like, call credit spread or some flavor of that.
3164.40s: So, as we're just casually looking through stuff right now, I'm just building a watch list
3172.96s: for us to be able to circle back to a little more quickly as we're trying to see what's going on.
3177.36s: So, let's continue.
3178.08s: And I'm purposely picking stuff that like I don't really know about because some of these,
3186.88s: I know exactly how they did, which I don't want to, I don't want to trade them.
3193.44s: See, this looks interesting. Apple looks interesting because this seems like,
3200.56s: this seems like it's like falling pretty heavy. Like that's a,
3214.96s: a not insignificant down day. So, let's see what the call side looks like here.
3224.48s: And this is just to see these are $5 wide. So, this is immediately out of the equation.
3229.92s: Next.
3236.40s: Amazon away.
3239.68s: Meta to expensive Netflix to expensive.
3242.96s: Good maybe.
3250.72s: Microsoft to expensive.
3254.16s: Cisco.
3256.40s: So, Cisco looks decent here, I would say.
3263.68s: It's, and it's funny because Cisco is actually rallying right now when most other stuff
3269.92s: is kind of doing poorly. So, let's see what we can get for like a put credit spread.
3279.28s: At the 45 handle.
3285.28s: You'd have to go two and a half dollars wide.
3290.88s: And you get 50, 52 cents.
3298.96s: It's a little big.
3302.08s: If I could get something closer to like a dollar wide, I would like it a little bit more.
3310.88s: But this is two and a half dollars wide collecting 52 cents. So,
3320.24s: yeah, I, I don't hate it, but it's a little big, but I think we might be able to get away with it.
3329.76s: Because that's risk in like 250, 248 or whatever.
3338.64s: Or 249.
3340.64s: So, let's see.
3343.84s: Let's see what we can get out of this.
3346.88s: Yes.
3353.92s: Yes. So, it's 1, 190, a, if we get filled there, we probably wouldn't.
3361.52s: So, let's call it at like 50 cents.
3364.16s: Again, penalize ourselves a little bit.
3366.48s: So, it'll be risking 200 bucks to make 50.
3371.84s: So, we'll, we'll see if we can make that happen.
3374.40s: So, let's add, let's add a couple things really fast.
3379.76s: The first thing I'm going to add is just a spread calc.
3385.36s: And the things that I want here, this is again, stuff that I would make in a log,
3390.64s: just because I know I'm going to be looking at this stuff and I want it to be fast.
3395.44s: So, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to include size,
3404.08s: width, premium. So, this will be profit, potential.
3416.64s: And then, we'll just do when, we'll do when size, loss size.
3427.52s: So, one of the things is by taking the time to build these little tools again,
3432.08s: it's a little bit of investment upfront, but once it's built, it's built, right?
3435.68s: So, like we're talking about doing a one lot, the width here is two and a half dollars wide.
3439.68s: The premium we're talking about is 50 cents.
3442.72s: So, what we can do is we can make it so that we just give it these handful of inputs
3447.28s: and we can calculate not just the win, loss, but we can also calculate the expected return,
3455.68s: which again, on spreads is typically going to be negative.
3459.12s: But we want to see how much of a negative it is and how good, because we're trading
3465.28s: directionally right now. By selling a put spread here, this is not like a, I don't have an opinion
3472.72s: or I think, you know, I don't think direct, like you think it directionally, you don't get to
3477.60s: not think directly with the vertical spread. So, anyways, the total win size here is just our premium.
3488.56s: Times size times 100. I don't know why I added a parenthesis, just because felt good.
3494.72s: And our loss here is the width, less premium times size times 100.
3513.04s: And then we'll just throw a negative in the front here.
3519.04s: So, the purpose of this is now is we're evaluating any other spreads. We just do it super fast.
3525.92s: Now, the other stuff we can throw into here again quickly is we could do
3532.00s: probability of a win, probability of a loss, probability of a win in this case,
3541.12s: we can either use delta or we can use the actual calculated probability. So, the probability is
3546.72s: 34% chance of being in the money. So, the way I would do this is like this.
3557.36s: Probability of losing is 34, 17. This isn't necessarily a max loss, but this is the probability of losing.
3566.64s: And then this is just one less this. So, now I have a quick look at what the probabilities are.
3576.96s: And then again, as you know, now we can calculate the expected return.
3582.24s: Just so that we know, we already know it's going to be negative. Well, we don't know, but
3586.24s: pretty good suspicion that it will be negative. So, this will be the win size times our probability of a
3594.32s: win plus loss size times probability of a loss. So, this is negatively expected 35, which again,
3606.56s: fully that doesn't surprise me. Vertical spreads are very often going to be this. Just because this
3613.60s: is negative expected value doesn't mean it's a bad trade, but it does mean that there's no inherent
3618.56s: edge to it. It means that you have to be the edge. You don't just get to put this on and it'll work
3623.84s: and you'll make money. You have to be directly correct for this trade to work. So, with Cisco
3631.84s: trading where it is, I would take that directional bet. So, let's put the trade on. So,
3636.96s: free Jan, Cisco, stock prices 47, 42. We're going to be doing a one-lot expiration. I think is
3646.80s: the same. 17 Feb. And for this, since it's a spread, it'll be like the 45 42.5 puts
3660.08s: Delta. I'll just use the short. It doesn't matter if I wanted to do both. I would just do like 0.3
3664.80s: slash 0.17. And again, you can deconstruct all of these and what not. It doesn't really matter.
3672.72s: So, premium here, we're planning to get good, all-fashioned,
3677.36s: fitty cents. We already know how much money this is going to take because we can see what the
3683.44s: loss size. Now, again, another cool thing you could do is see what this loss size is relative to
3689.52s: your portfolio value and just leave this sit here. So, this is risking 4% of the portfolio. That's
3695.44s: a massive amount of risk for this kind of spread. Like, in a regular size account, there's no world
3702.32s: where I would ever do this. But this is a small account. You have to make concessions. It's the
3709.28s: only choice you have. So, this is three trades. We're using a decent amount of the account, not a
3718.32s: ton, but definitely a little bit more than I would typically care to use. So, right now 75%
3727.04s: utilized. And then again, this will be the amount of risk will change a little bit.
3739.52s: What the fuck did I just do? Oh, stop that. Not that immediately.
3746.32s: There we go. Because these should be the same right now.
3749.20s: Okay. All right. Let me take a pause yet again and see if there's any questions so far
3758.88s: with what we've set up, how we've set it up, where things sit right now, anything like that.
3766.56s: I still really want to try to find a short trade. There's got to be something that looks good
3771.92s: for a short. Give me a second. In the meantime, if you have a question, let me know. Just feel like
3776.88s: there's got to be a short somewhere. You come. You come. How do we feel about Qcom?
3792.88s: It's just everything is consolidating. Everything.
3798.32s: I have to be consolidating. And Jay consolidating. Pfizer. Fucking consolidating.
3809.28s: Pfizer's kind of extended though. So maybe there's something here. Maybe this isn't necessarily
3816.88s: like a pure short expectation, but there might be something here. I'm thinking it more so in the
3826.32s: context of it peaked here and then it's consolidating lower. So we'll take a short here. Why not?
3836.96s: Let's see what we can get for these calls. We have to go two and a half wide again. And again,
3844.64s: we're going to be directional. So premium here is 60. Call it 68 cents.
3857.04s: Probability of losing.
3864.16s: 34.9.
3869.04s: What you'll notice this actually has a slightly better take a look at that.
3874.08s: Our EV just went up pretty significantly over what we just saw from Cisco. That's kind of curious.
3880.56s: And it's essentially the same probability, but take a look. This is a 38 delta compared to what
3887.68s: we got over here, which was a 30 delta. That's actually interesting. And it makes me like this
3892.96s: trade more. So PFE 50.95 size one X3 17 Feb. Now we're looking at the 52.5 55s. So 52.5
3909.84s: slash 55. These are the calls. Delta is 0.38 by 0.2. Premium is again, we're calling it 68 cents.
3926.08s: We know our risk in the trade is 182. So now we're 80% utilized. That's beautiful. That's
3935.04s: like a pretty good spot to be. And we're looking again, if we were to plot out our return,
3942.80s: our return target for the year. We'll just do 9%. We'll just pick the midpoint.
3956.48s: So you can see like we're already well on the way in terms of what this might get us.
3964.64s: And again, this is not including a return potential on the long shares. This is just using a return
3971.04s: potential based on the credit that we've taken in so far. So this is almost like what we're trying
3979.20s: to get over the full year. Now we don't expect this to happen. We fully anticipate the
3985.84s: probability of stuff going wrong to be pretty high, such as the nature of trading. So now let's
3992.00s: just fast forward time. Let's see what's up. So now I'll bring us forward. I don't want to go
4000.08s: full weeks because I wouldn't wait that long to do stuff. So we'll skip days. We'll do like every
4004.72s: other day to start. Zah. Buyers of trade already looks good.
4016.48s: And this is starting to break down more. So this almost starts to become interesting from a
4022.40s: couple of other ideas. One thing that I would be consulting with that I just can't right now
4028.08s: based on where the platform is is just implied volatility percentile and rank like I can't see any
4034.96s: of that. So I'm just using the options chain to proxy it. But I would want to use that for sure.
4041.76s: But these are still mostly directional plays. Okay. So Pfizer, where do we sit right now? We had the
4048.40s: 52 and a half's and the 55's. We sold those for 68 cents. And it's already at like 34.
4060.40s: So those might need to come down soon actually. But not that soon. We still have 20 delta's on the
4066.32s: short so we can wait a little bit on Pfizer. So nothing, nothing doing there. Let's go to Cisco. I'm
4076.96s: just going to go backwards. So Cisco is going against us. We have the 45 42 half put spread.
4086.16s: We put that on for 50 cents. Our we're down here in terms of the short strike. But there's
4095.68s: just nothing to be done right now. This is just let it sit. TQs is sideways nothing to be done.
4106.08s: So let's go to Monday.
4114.96s: All right. So TQs, we're starting to see a little bit of a rally.
4121.04s: There's two things we might have to do here. The calls are good.
4127.84s: We're at the 21. But I really wouldn't want to get ran over. So gonna have to pay pretty close
4134.32s: attention to those calls, I think. And then the put we just need to see if we need to rebalance it.
4141.28s: One of the things to keep in mind is with something that's at these price levels is you're going to
4145.92s: run out of the ability to short puts super fast. Right. So think about it. The original put that we
4152.72s: that we sold was at the 15. So as TQs might make its rally. And I don't remember exactly the path
4160.96s: had for the beginning of the year. But as this has its rally, what's going to happen is even if we
4166.96s: try to rebalance the the delta's on these, let's take a look. So we're at the 15 put right. We're
4172.56s: already down to 17 delta's that started at a 13 delta. We lost half our delta's right away.
4177.68s: I would want to rebalance this. The problem is if we bring it back up to the 17s, what just happened.
4185.12s: We now just add another $200 to this trade that will put us at our total allocation available
4194.08s: for the trade literally right away, which is extremely suboptimal. And again, it's why saving
4202.48s: and all this other stuff is important. So a trader is faced with this kind of thing with a very
4207.44s: difficult situation in my opinion, because you either have to just buy the shares outright and
4214.56s: just hold it until it comes back down. Or you sell the put by the shares a little bit later when
4222.00s: they're a little bit more expensive. Now, just understanding the fact that this is kind of a
4228.96s: ticking timeframe. And you are running out of the choices available to you pretty quickly.
4237.20s: I would probably favor just buying shares. I would prefer to be able to sell the puts,
4243.12s: but they're going to end up taking way too much of the account unless I decide to give myself a
4248.40s: little bit more on the core allocation, which might have to happen. I might flex a little bit here
4254.88s: because we can see from the speculative allocation, we're not using anywhere near this amount of money.
4261.36s: The total sum that we have on right now is $382 of risk relative to the $1500 that we're expecting to
4267.60s: use here. So we have room to play. So my gameplay in here will probably be to roll these up to the 18
4277.44s: or to the 17, to the 17, I think here, because that's going to give me double the deltas that I have,
4286.56s: well, not double the deltas, double the premium that I have, and almost double the delta, which I
4291.36s: need. Otherwise, I'm going to miss the directional move, which I don't want. So let's go to 9,
4296.96s: Jan. Let's take a look at the price. It's $1892. And these would be closed at 57.
4310.48s: So now, again, we can do all this different math. I don't care about the capture.
4317.36s: The rest of the stuff is okay to track. So the stock move is easy.
4321.52s: It's just this minus this divided by this.
4334.32s: So stock is up 13%, which is pretty, pretty significant. And then these two, I'll actually flip.
4340.40s: So K&L, we have our closing plus what we opened at times size times 100. This doesn't differentiate
4357.44s: for long shares, just because I'm not wasting the time on that. Didn't mean to do that.
4370.48s: So that gave us a 4.2% return on a Vesic capital. So there's our first put that's out the door.
4377.36s: Now, again, another thing that I would do is I would modify the formula so that if there is a
4384.24s: closing price like this here, don't count the margin or the risk input so that this way, I could
4393.44s: easily update this without having to spend a bunch of times. So we'll do that super fast.
4401.92s: So we'll grab Gemini again. And then essentially I'm just going to say, modify this formula
4409.84s: so that if there is an input in M,
4420.96s: that row is not calculated, is not included in the sum.
4427.12s: So again, this is just literally plain speaking to GPT, telling it exactly what we want. It's using
4441.76s: not blank, which is fine. That's again error prone. It's not exactly what we would want, but it
4449.76s: works just fine. So we're cool here now. So then I'm going to tell it to do the same for this
4456.72s: formula. Or again, you could just copy the logic it did. Do the same for this formula.
4467.60s: So now as soon as I input the close, I don't have to like go back and delete it, which I don't
4474.24s: want to do. Because again, if you go back and delete it, you're deleting useful information.
4480.32s: So your goal is to preserve your inputs as much as you can because it's going to help with
4485.92s: analysis later on. So now we're 50% utilized. We need to put on our new short put here in TQs.
4495.04s: Let's get Gemini out of the way. So this will be 9 Jan, TQs, stock prices at 1892.
4506.88s: We're going to do a one lot. We're still going to be in 17 Feb. And now we're looking at the 17 put,
4513.12s: that's going to give us a 29 Delta premium that we'll get on that put is 111.
4519.28s: And we're going to put up 17 on D to do it. Cool.
4535.92s: Okay. So we have our trades. We can look for more that kind of thing. I'm going to fast forward time.
4547.28s: Just so that we can, because I know that we're pretty deep in this. We're ready in our 15 minutes.
4554.64s: So let's just, I fast forward it a little bit more time.
4558.96s: Ah, bummer. So at this point, our short puts will be doing really well. But we kind of missed
4572.32s: our opportunity to buy shares, at least to get another smooth 100 lot. We're too late now,
4578.72s: which sucks, but is what it is. So let's take a look at what these are trading at. Now the 17 puts,
4587.84s: they're down for 30 cents down at 11 Delta. If we rolled them up to the 20 that takes us another
4594.32s: 300 bucks. So that would take us to a total of 4,090. That's 90%. Right. So we're,
4602.80s: we're out of the put game here. Unfortunately. So here's what would happen next in my approach to
4609.84s: this kind of thing. This would come down. Stock is now at 2166. These are going to come down for,
4621.68s: what did we say 30? That's called 30 cents. And really the only thing we can do at this point
4632.72s: is buy shares with the residual allocation that we have as much as we want to use. So 35
4641.20s: hundred bucks. We're only using 20 90. So we know we're not going to be able to sell more puts.
4647.60s: So we might buy another, we have 1500 bucks left, maybe 750. Because this is also knowing where TQs
4659.92s: is. The distance off of near term highs puts us at pretty low point. So this is 23 jam.
4667.44s: T triple Qs stock price is 21 65 size. We'll have to figure that out. It might be like 25 lot.
4678.24s: There's not going to be an expiration and 21 65 should be 66. So maybe 35 34 34. Do we get 34 shares?
4697.44s: So now our total position here, 736.
4707.76s: 736. So now our entire TQs position is effectively set except we need to manage these calls now.
4719.52s: So the calls are officially a point in the money. So this would be 23 jam. This is too late.
4726.64s: This would have been managed earlier for sure, especially when you have like a smaller amount tied
4732.80s: to this. So just as what it is. So 21 66 is when we're managing these. And then our strike is the
4744.80s: 21s. So we'll get those down for like a dollar 99.
4755.28s: Okay. Next 23 jam TQs. 21 66. This will be a one lot. We'll be in
4766.48s: probably 17 March now. And let's see, we need to get at least a dollar 99.
4776.16s: That puts us at the 22s or the 23s if we accept a small loss. So let's see if we can get to those 23s.
4787.12s: Those are a 46. So we're already getting buried super fast. And let's call it $1.60.
4797.20s: So in the original, we got $2.19 closing it for $1.99. So we can make that move.
4803.52s: So the margin on these would be nothing because it's tied to the underlying trade.
4809.84s: And now we take a look at the others really fast. And then we'll just kind of talk about this
4814.56s: process because it would just be this like over and over again now. So Pfizer, we got our down move
4821.76s: for sure. Wow. That just absolutely broke down. So Pfizer were at the 52 half and 55.
4836.88s: So these are down for nothing.
4842.56s: So that comes down for a penny.
4845.92s: So Pfizer would be down.
4852.56s: And this is still 23 jam.
4858.64s: 45.2.
4863.76s: And we'd get out of this for about a penny.
4875.84s: So now what I would do is I would actually calculate.
4885.76s: This is wrong.
4888.16s: Oh, because this is calculating off the stock transaction. So what I would do now is I would
4894.08s: change this formula.
4904.88s: Oh, that's just our credit. My bad. One's stuck. We need to aggregate our PNO.
4909.60s: So we need to essentially input a sum if we want if this is not blank.
4918.08s: So we can again tell GPT exactly what we want. So P81
4927.12s: sum P82
4934.40s: is PAD some PAD 2.
4938.80s: If M
4941.36s: has an input. So this will some are close trades.
4954.88s: And again, you can just essentially use this logic. But
4960.96s: so this looks good.
4963.12s: It is good.
4967.12s: It is going to be blank. Yeah, this is good.
4975.04s: No, that's not right. We want this sum.
4981.52s: I want some E82 to P based on this filter.
4990.80s: I gave two versions too, which is kind of interesting.
4996.48s: As we're I'm going to wrap this up once we finish just marking these trades where they're at.
5002.32s: But if you have questions or if you have anything that you want to discuss more deeply about
5007.60s: like this process. If some of what we're doing doesn't make sense. If you don't know how to
5015.04s: apply some of what we're doing now is the perfect time to start throwing those things into the
5020.40s: chat. Let's just verify that this is correct. And it's completely correct. So this is good.
5030.64s: So it's summing essentially what we have. And you can see we're still net positive
5037.12s: after even after this pretty big losing trade realistically.
5042.72s: And that should be there.
5050.40s: So then we can calculate the return on the account so far.
5057.92s: Which is positive 1.42% and we are 20 days, 20 trading days into the year.
5072.16s: Okay, so let's see the rest of this really fast. We really only have one other look at which is this go.
5080.40s: And Cisco, I don't remember what we did. What are we doing, Cisco?
5088.64s: We're long. 45, 42 and a half put. How we doing? Oh, we're like still right on the
5096.64s: we're right on the cuss. So those are 37 cents. We sold them for 50. That's a leave it.
5106.40s: That would be no change. Cool. So let's talk about and just kind of recap what happened here.
5117.36s: What was this process of building the portfolio like? What decisions were made and why?
5123.36s: And you'll notice that this is not difficult. It's really not difficult to follow exactly this.
5131.84s: You can see literally together while we were on this, we built a rudimentary log with the key
5140.16s: stuff that matters. This isn't everything, but it's the main stuff that's applicable to what we're
5146.16s: doing. We have a useful side calculator that we'll use for one of the core strategies that we have.
5154.40s: We have our watch list that we're following these different names to see which way we might want
5160.16s: to trade them. And we have some portfolio level statistics. We have what we're trying to make on
5165.36s: the year based on our input return target, which in this case is the midpoint between 8 and 10.
5171.20s: And we're able, another thing that I would do is I would differentiate so that this could be more
5182.32s: automated. Just differentiate and be like, have a flag if it's core speculative, see your S,
5189.92s: so that you can see your running totals of core and speculative, make it a little easier to come
5195.28s: up with those numbers. So I would just add an input for that to make it even easier still.
5202.88s: I would essentially make everything speculative unless it's core. This way you don't have to worry
5208.24s: about inputting a bunch. So for example, what I would do is I would just have the core allocation
5213.76s: calculate if the ticker is TQs because that's what we're using for core in this scenario.
5218.88s: And then if it's not TQs, then it's speculative. That's how I would think about it.
5223.84s: So notice how we're not using the entire portfolio. You don't have to. Notice how we have a couple
5231.52s: complementing positions. We have stuff that's short premium to the upside, short premium to the
5239.04s: downside. We have our core position already built. And the game now is literally just cycling through
5248.32s: and making the same decision tree that you've seen so far. Like that's literally it.
5253.44s: That's all that goes into this. But there's a couple things that matter a lot to us to track.
5260.88s: So for example, the risk, I would split the risk tracking out into two places, core risk, speculative risk.
5272.40s: Because the core risk is going to be a dominant portion of this. The speculative risk will be a
5278.40s: smaller subset. But I want to see how much of a subset that it actually is. That's useful
5284.72s: information for me to track. Stuff like that. But the broader idea here is when you're trading a
5291.52s: small account, it's annoying. There are disadvantages. But it's very doable. Notice how we use things
5300.00s: like verticals, which I don't care for. But it is what it is. Because when we're trading vertical
5306.96s: spreads in a small account, you're accepting the fact that it's not the most efficient expression
5312.88s: of what you're trying to do. However, there's a tradeoff. And it makes it fit the account better
5319.12s: because remember, even when we're sizing stuff like this, 200 bucks, that doesn't seem like that
5324.16s: much. This represents 4% risk on the entire portfolio. That's not a trivial amount of money
5331.68s: that's being put at risk at the portfolio level for a vertical spread where you're aiming to make
5337.04s: 50 bucks. So this is also why I think it makes a lot of sense to have buy side strategies. And
5345.44s: that's actually what I would have done after the first time advance or maybe the second time
5349.36s: advance. We could do it really quick now just because we're here so that we can at least close the
5353.28s: loop on what this watch list looks like. John says, hope you're having a grave. I'm having a
5360.40s: perfect Friday. Sitting here, chatting about options. It would be a little bit better if it wasn't
5365.92s: about a small account. That's kind of annoying. But chatting about options with the outlier community,
5371.68s: it's the best thing you could do on a Friday. Love your channel. Thank you very much. I appreciate
5376.56s: that. I hope that this stuff is useful. All right. Let's take a look at these on our watch list
5381.44s: really quick. Ford, we didn't have an opinion on
5388.00s: and it looks downside. But it held this. That's interesting.
5399.68s: So we looked at it here. It rallied hard, consolidated and is rallying again. So I would probably
5407.76s: go upside in Ford if I had to pick. And then so far, we wanted long calls in here. Again,
5415.92s: I think the spot we decided would be a breakout though, which would have been here. This is where
5421.68s: that entry would have been. So so far would be long. Some sort of call position there. And then
5430.08s: EWZ was a call credit spread of some sort. Which we would have been getting ran over depending
5442.16s: on where it was. That would have been essentially a full a full loss though. I presume.
5448.40s: I don't know what the vol would have been. But
5451.60s: Yeah, because I mean this no, yeah, we were looking at a call credit spread. We that's right.
5461.84s: I remember now because because of this initial drop at holding this consolidation, it wasn't
5468.40s: a fade or a long. I wouldn't have traded either way here. So I probably wouldn't have traded this
5474.72s: to the upside. This maybe at this point could be something for like a call credit spread,
5481.60s: but I wouldn't be convinced because this year it's consolidating super super super effectively.
5492.88s: Okay, so this will be the last version of these surviving options with a 5K trading account that
5501.68s: you guys see. And my game plan is now for the next one is to turn into the next main topic that we
5511.52s: have talked about, which is taking a look inside the actual trading strategies that I use.
5520.72s: The main purpose for that series is going to be actually just zooming in on
5528.88s: how I build out what I refer to as like the strategy toolkit. And it's the way that I think about
5537.12s: having things to be able to trade most market conditions. So we're going to be spending most of
5544.48s: that conversation looking at it from that lens. It's less about what I personally do with my personal
5551.76s: strategies, although we will talk about that. And it's so much more about how to build a strategy
5562.32s: toolkit that allows us to trade varying market conditions. That's the main main idea. So
5574.64s: well, let me see what you guys have in the chat. And then again, if you guys have any questions
5583.60s: or anything that you want to talk about now is literally the perfect time to throw those in and
5589.28s: happy to spend a few minutes while we're waiting for our dinner to get here. Actually, let me finish
5596.16s: making my dinner order. All right.
5614.32s: John says, do you still like box? That's the best savings account kind of ticker of all time.
5620.64s: I never really felt anything about box. Nothing that I trade. And it's because what you get in
5630.72s: box is a little bit different than what you can get without using box and just trading box spreads
5639.60s: yourself. So I personally wouldn't use this. Although if you guys haven't seen, I had my friend
5649.92s: Wes. He's the dude that made this. I had him on the podcast. He's a marine veteran. It's super smart
5656.96s: duty. He's a PhD. He's actually, I'm due to reach out to him to get another episode with him at
5663.52s: some point because I like connecting with him. He's a, he's a really cool dude. But yeah, I mean,
5669.20s: I just use box spreads because if you take a look at like the holding duration versus what you can
5676.16s: get on where is I think I have the box spread calculator in here already. I'm not mistaken.
5688.88s: I do. Oh, this is just comparing the yield curves. So if we look at
5702.08s: a current box spread, let's see. Let's see what we can find. I just want to price stuff out.
5717.92s: Okay. I was going to move it over. It's kind of difficult. I'm going to do the math first and
5740.64s: then I'll pull it over so that you guys can see. I'll do like a one lot. So let's say today's
5745.28s: six June and let's say that we want to put on a box spread. Let's take a peek.
5758.40s: So let's say we want to go out here. That's over a week and I would want to come out a day
5766.08s: earlier if possible. We'll do like the 15 July. So let's see what we can get for just a standard
5774.08s: box spread. We'll keep this at 75 for now. It might be okay. 55. Yeah, this is fine. So let's buy
5785.60s: cell 65 by so in a lot. So right now the mid is 99615 probably wouldn't get a fill there, but let's see.
5806.64s: So on a one lot using 5,500, 6,500, tracking the net premium out to start as 996.15.
5820.32s: That yeah, there's no way you'd get a fill there. That puts us at a 5.72% premium over the
5831.36s: risk-free rate. The total loan out there is just 99615 so assuming $100,000 overall idea.
5840.88s: The corresponding I need to update the current risk-free rates though.
5847.68s: And again, those that are in the the pros side of stuff you guys have this already.
5854.48s: This is just a template that you can download.
5862.48s: Okay, so now we have a slightly different picture. It's 5.81%. Because the yield curve did shift
5873.52s: slightly, which is actually kind of interesting. So what I'm doing is I'm just updating
5883.52s: what the yield curve shows us. And it looks like
5897.12s: interesting.
5902.32s: It looks like a modest shift in the front. That's kind of curious to me.
5908.88s: Anyways, so let's, yeah, so anyways, like when I look at trading a box spread,
5919.52s: this is more or less why I prefer to trade box spreads out right because you essentially are
5930.96s: going to get a better you're going to get a better rate just by trading it yourself,
5938.40s: which I think is at least what would I tend to prefer. Yeah.
5952.80s: Interesting. The curve shifted like not a ton but a little bit. So like the front was
5961.20s: 4335. Now it's at 4224 for a month. It's not an insignificant front shift.
5967.84s: Not enough. So anyways, yeah, that's why I prefer box spreads personally.
5976.24s: Chase says is part one available. Yeah, so part one, you actually have to skip through a lot of it.
5982.88s: Where's part one here?
5985.84s: Part one, you have to skip through a lot of it because
5994.64s: um, we had like a conversation in the beginning about what we were going to focus on based on a
6004.80s: couple polls that we took. So I would start it at what I'll tell you right now.
6015.92s: Let's see. So here we are.
6032.88s: So we want to start I think
6036.24s: here. I don't know. There's actually. Wait a minute. This is this one. What the fuck?
6049.04s: I was like, what's happening? It's so funny. Look, this is straight doppelganger.
6056.80s: All right, this is the right one. All right, all right.
6060.88s: So we want to start from like
6067.92s: here. I would say like 28 minutes in. That's where I would kick off.
6076.08s: I
6087.36s: updated the timestamp in there so that you'll be able to see exactly where to start.
6094.40s: All right. Black mama says 5k is really hard. I've made
6101.68s: challenges from one to two A plus setups. I actually don't like that's the thing is 5k
6110.96s: really isn't hard. The hard part with a $5,000 account is a trader wrapping their arms around
6118.72s: what's realistic. That's the hard part because you can see even in the example that we just went
6125.12s: through together. If we take a look at the like the realized returns
6134.32s: here and this here $71.71 gross dollars is probably the most
6144.32s: disinteresting and unappealing return on planet earth, right? Like nobody cares about that.
6152.72s: However, in the context of like an actual market return, that's not bad. Right? 1.42% return over
6165.52s: the course of a few weeks is not bad. So I think that's probably one of the biggest struggles people
6172.24s: will go through. The implementation of a $5,000 account really isn't that difficult. It's just a
6178.40s: matter of accepting those trade-offs. The hard part is for somebody to be able to look at
6183.52s: something that is going to make them a bunch of money really fast and easy that doing that
6189.28s: and saying something like a 1.42% return getting you $71 is good. I think that's the real hard part
6198.96s: for for people which totally understand. Like that's difficult to swallow.
6204.16s: John says, I really want your look at AR and that gas. We'll probably do that on maybe the
6217.68s: Monday stream. But yeah, I think box itself is fine, but I would just trade box spreads
6228.48s: out right myself. You'll get a better yield. That's just that's the function.
6241.92s: Black Mamba says it's hard for an experience for a pro. It's okay. Each mistake can end in a blow
6247.92s: up. These are facts. Yeah, but that again, like that's the point is that if you manage your expectations,
6256.88s: none of these if we even experienced a full loss would blow the account.
6262.80s: Right? That's actually the entire point is that this pads you. So even if we lost our entire
6270.56s: TQ's position, which is the largest position this would have, we still would have just under
6276.56s: two grand to use. So again, that that goes back because each trade you put on needs to be thought
6285.84s: through so that it is not that because for a lot of people, they're just so focused on how
6292.16s: much money they think they're going to be able to make from a position that they don't spend
6297.52s: enough time looking at even this like we talked about, right? These vertical spreads.
6302.08s: The vertical spreads are shots. They're directional trades. It's you could be right.
6305.92s: It could be wrong. It's like if it's shot, however, if we size these smartly, even if we lose on
6313.84s: them, it still gives the portfolio a large enough chance to be able to put more on for the numbers
6322.72s: to kind of break out a little bit better. So the thing here is most people that start with a small
6333.20s: account, just start with the completely wrong expectations, which is really what the first session
6339.76s: was about, right? The first session, I don't remember where it is.
6346.24s: Those somewhere around here.
6356.96s: No. Here. So if you take a look at what actually matters, if a new trader is able to wrap their
6369.52s: arms around like what actually matters, then run in a 5K account really isn't that difficult.
6378.00s: But the problem is most don't. And most people who start trading options just kind of flop around
6386.08s: haphazardly. Black Mama says inexperience will deteriorate and lose the account. A pro will handle
6393.60s: most of 5K or used by unexperience. It is what it is. Yeah. No, I completely agree. I think most,
6399.12s: but that's again, that's the whole point of the segment, right? Is because for a lot of people,
6404.32s: the reason why they approach it that way is just because they don't know better. And I remember when
6410.16s: I first started trading options, I didn't know any better. So yeah, completely agree though. And
6415.44s: that's the undoing of most traders, even people with bigger than 5K accounts. It's just to your
6421.44s: broader point way more tied just to the experience element. And people who are inexperienced tend to
6429.76s: think that trading is going to be fast easy money. And again, as soon as you're around for a little
6435.52s: bit, you know, objectively, this is not the case. And the, I think the main issue that people with
6441.76s: small accounts tend to have is really, really fucked expectations that then ends up being their
6450.48s: undoing unnecessarily. Simply if somebody just knows a little bit better about the reality of what
6457.28s: this thing is likely to look like. So yeah, I agree though. It definitely is, it's challenging
6465.60s: because there's a big pill that has to be swallowed that nobody likes. That's the issue. But
6475.84s: cool. All right, gang. Hope this session is useful. I hope this is like the mini series at
6480.24s: least gives you some ideas on different ways to approach trading 5K account again. Today we
6486.32s: literally just built a portfolio together back in time from scratch. And you can see it didn't even
6491.44s: take that long doing it in an educational concept like this. We're an hour and 40 minutes in.
6498.48s: So it can be done relatively quickly. Now obviously it's quick because I know what I'm looking for
6504.88s: and I know what I'm doing. But the broader point is like it doesn't have to be this crazy
6510.80s: overwhelming thing. It just needs to be something that's thought through at a relative level.
6518.40s: And if you can do that, then you can position yourself to be in a much better spot. And again,
6523.60s: you'll notice that a big thing that I always talk about is paper trading because even if you're
6530.80s: actively live trading a 5K account, the way to think about it is you're just learning the basics
6538.40s: that's not going to be done to scale the account massively. You're just getting a proof of concept.
6543.52s: So you should still be doing that with the paper trading account in parallel so that you can test
6548.64s: different things, test trading more so at scale, that kind of stuff. But as always, if you have
