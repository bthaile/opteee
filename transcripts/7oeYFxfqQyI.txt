0.00s:  game stop is showing some signs of life. Get ready for your Tuesday update on the crowd
7.56s:  favorite game stop. We're going to just take a look at the stock, take a look at the
10.66s:  options. We'll talk about some position updates. And to kick us off, just like I have been
15.64s:  doing on these Tuesday videos, you just want to recap what we covered in the game stop
20.60s:  analysis live stream from this last Saturday, it's every Saturday at 5 p.m. Pacific
26.30s:  time. And we kind of ran through the DD library again. So we looked at a few things we
32.10s:  had. There was essentially one or two of them that I would consider to be like true research.
39.50s:  One of it was likening us to the O8 crash. And obviously that hasn't really played out
44.26s:  because the broad idea is that we're due for like another big crash. But I like the research
48.82s:  specifically related to the O8 crash. Now the parallel and the transition from the O8 crash
56.78s:  into game stop, I thought was a little bit weak in terms of the, you know, the actual correlation.
63.06s:  But I still thought it was interesting nonetheless. And then the rest of the stuff we were looking
68.54s:  at was a game of funny memes. There was somebody that really enjoyed doing Lego memes. So they made
74.26s:  like a whole book of it, which is pretty funny. And then there was a general magazine. It was
79.86s:  like a national geographic design, almost, which was pretty neat. So we are still working through
85.94s:  the top theories and analysis. This is we wrapped up part 14. So this is over 20 hours now. Just
93.78s:  looking at the top theories, not including the overall game stop analysis. That's been on stream
98.58s:  for now 32 episodes. This is pretty fun. Cool. So that's stuff aside. Let's take a look at the
104.90s:  stock itself because it's in a very interesting spot here. So as everybody knows, game stop
111.70s:  absolutely had been contracting for quite some time now. A lot of it actually looked to be in my
117.62s:  opinion, some type of institutional selling. And again, I don't go into the world of whether
124.74s:  that's institutional selling to suppress the price or anything like that. I'm just talking
128.34s:  from a standard market behavior perspective. This that's what it looked like because it wasn't
132.90s:  tied to any specific news. There was a slight uptick in overall average volume. And that to me
140.02s:  looks like some sort of entity that's looking to unwind a long position that they might have in
146.26s:  it. Now that's complete conjecture. I don't know. Let's just fairly calm in based on this kind of
152.50s:  pattern configuration. So then that move digested out. We came into a couple really important
158.58s:  levels. The first one was the 26 and a half level, which we fell right down through that.
164.34s:  And then we were hovering at 25 and a half. And I was actually pretty nervous if we were to fall
170.50s:  below 25 and a half. And we did. Now the cool part about this is on the fall through 25 and a half.
180.58s:  You can actually see that there's really nothing in here as far as a volume profile. There's just
185.30s:  not a lot of transactions. Now the reason why that's so important is because that means there's
192.82s:  not a lot of legacy buying at that level. It's kind of no man's land. And if we zoom this into a
198.10s:  three month daily, you can see the same thing here. There's just not a lot of volume being transacted
204.34s:  at. However, it did come to find some pretty firm support on the 200 day moving average.
210.02s:  And then it had a really strong day yesterday on the 10th. You can see that
215.86s:  it rallied pretty hard through this overall descending channel, which is good. Now I don't think
222.26s:  we're out of the woods yet because if you take a look again, just from a standard technical
226.98s:  analysis perspective, let me get rid of that one and grab the line for you guys like the trend
231.94s:  line so I can show you what I'm seeing, which is from here down to here. It's still very much
240.02s:  in a pretty confirmed downtrend. It's just starting to lighten up in terms of the slope,
246.42s:  at least in the near term time frame and a long term time frame, it's still unequivocally
250.58s:  upward sloping, you know, appreciating. So this was really well received. And essentially it
257.62s:  gapped up to 25 and a half and then it rallied all the way up to 27. So that was a really,
263.62s:  really big day again on relatively light news. But this is again, it looks to be institutional
271.14s:  sponsorship of some sort that looks that is exactly what that looks like to me. Now this is the
277.30s:  broader value area is far as I see it. And now this becomes near term support on the downside and
286.26s:  it still looks like it's generally descending. So it's a game of wait and see. We have to see
291.54s:  from a price action perspective how it behaves, but it is good that it found some support on the
296.74s:  200 day MA. There's definitely some interest there. Now to the upside, there is a really significant
304.50s:  volume node in here, which I'll highlight it for you so that you can see. So it doesn't surprise me
310.34s:  at all to see the price meander up into that and then get pushed back down. The reason being is
316.10s:  very frequently when we get into this kind of price area, people that were in at these levels
325.22s:  after it fell down to 24 ish, they're happy to get out at a break even. So that's for the people
332.66s:  that are more actively trading it. So this still looks like GameStop is near term downtrend.
340.26s:  It looks like it's decelerating the downtrend a little bit, which is good. These are starting
344.74s:  these channels are widening out. And now the game is to see if it starts to approach this
351.78s:  prior high and then this prior high to get above right now, what will essentially be a supply
358.18s:  zone for people to to offload. Now in terms of volatility, volatility really hasn't moved that much.
364.82s:  So you can see implied volatility percentile still just down at 6%, which is very, very light
371.30s:  for GameStop. The implied volatility itself is at 77 and a half, which again on a
378.50s:  gross basis that's still quite high. And the reason why that's important is because for people like me
383.38s:  and the position I've been showing you trading the covered strangle in GameStop,
388.58s:  this volatility even though it's relatively low to GameStop, it's still very, very high.
394.18s:  So to give you an example of what I mean by that, let's say if you wanted to sell a put and let me
399.94s:  grab a worksheet here so that we can just kind of look at it together. So if I wanted to sell a put
406.02s:  here and it's the 24 strike. So the 24 strike and we're looking at a 0.27 delta 0.27.
419.22s:  And then if we take a look at the premium, we get it's kind of really wide. Well, let's call it like
426.34s:  98 cents, something like that. 0.98, that's the premium you get. So a very standard calculation here
436.42s:  is essentially to take the premium received divided by the strike and then to turn this into a percent.
441.54s:  So this means that if you sell a cash secured put, you're going to put up 24 hundred bucks,
445.86s:  you're going to get 98 bucks. And it's essentially a 4.1 percent return on your money. And if you
451.38s:  have no context on if that's good, batter and different, this will mean that much to you. So
457.30s:  that's actually why I want to help give you some context. So let's take a look at in equivalent.
462.90s:  I'm now going to pivot over to spy. We're going to stay in the same expiration that 38 days to
468.50s:  expiration. I'm going to find the same delta so that we can look at the commensurate. So this one's
474.18s:  GameStop. This one will be not SPT. In fact, this one will be SPY. So let's take a look now at spy.
486.02s:  So the strike for a 27 delta here is like the 590, so 590.27, which is great that it lines up
492.98s:  perfectly. And at that 27, you're going to get 499, 4.99. So then if we take a look at this as a
500.90s:  percentage to compare, take a look at the difference. So because GameStop is so volatile, in general,
512.58s:  even though right now it's relatively not compared to itself, you're getting 3.24% more money
522.02s:  on a relative basis. So that's why right now trading something like GameStop is so attractive,
528.50s:  even though the volatility is low. And this leads to another important point again from a trader's
533.94s:  lens, which as most of you probably know by now, that's the primary lens that I apply when I'm
540.82s:  looking at markets because it's how I make a living. I am a trader. So if we take a look at what you
549.94s:  can make in something in GameStop, what I'm doing is I'm grabbing the coverage strangle as it sits
556.50s:  in the portfolio right now here. I can show you what we have. So this is the coverage strangle
565.14s:  as it sits in GameStop. And what this means is on a relative basis, you can collect a lot of money
574.18s:  relative to how much money you're putting up. So right now, I still have just 250 shares,
581.38s:  so that puts me at 28% of my exposure of this 78% in total, 28% of it is in shares. And this is
590.82s:  actually an ideal time for me to start scooping up some more shares. Now, what I don't like to do
598.02s:  is buy shares and things as it's contracting too quickly, right? Because I need to see where it goes.
603.86s:  But now is actually a pretty good accumulation zone. Now that we see that it's behaved around here
610.10s:  pretty well. And I actually started looking to buy shares at this breakthrough. But I didn't
617.54s:  in this model section of the portfolio simply because we don't have that much left. Meaning we
624.34s:  only have 20% of the capital left of an allocated amount. The reason why that's so important is because
629.70s:  through the cash secured put side of the equation, even as GameStop is having these kinds of moves,
637.86s:  it can be really lucrative. You can make a lot of money. And then again, when it looks good,
642.26s:  you can roll that money into buying shares when you are prepared to. So the reason why I'm talking
649.54s:  about this opportunity is for this right here. This is looking at volatility. And you can see that
655.14s:  overall implied volatility, this is looking at 30 day vol. It's absolutely contracting massively.
660.74s:  It used to be up to 130% now. It's down to 93% in this reference range. And you can see, though,
669.38s:  that realize volatility, which is the gray line. Don't worry about the purple line at all. Pretend it's
673.22s:  not there. The gray line is one month realized of all. So 21 days technically or 20 days. And you can
679.78s:  see that they're starting to converge on one another. But there's still so much excess of all
684.82s:  compared to the realize volatility. That leads to strong opportunity from short premium
690.82s:  perspectives, which is exactly what the coverage triangle is. So now let's take a quick look at GameStop
698.82s:  related news. And I want to take a look at it starting from here because I saw it come through on
707.14s:  a handful of different things. So we can see that there was the picture from Ryan Cohen with
714.42s:  the former MicroStrategy CEO, Michael Sailor, which was put the internet ablaze. Lots of people.
720.58s:  We're really, really curious about what that all means. And GameStop started moving on that. I
727.54s:  think a lot of people are starting to become curious if GameStop potentially might be getting
732.02s:  involved in Bitcoin. And you can see they didn't comment on anything. I think that right now GameStop
737.78s:  is playing their cards pretty close to their chest. So you can see that this came across a bunch
744.50s:  of different news sources. And it likely is a significant reason behind the price behavior that you see.
751.22s:  Because if there are institutions that see GameStop continuing to make its pivot and they really like
757.38s:  the potential direction it might go, then this starts to become really, really interesting.
764.10s:  So overall, it looks like the movement towards Bitcoin is really well received. It's something that
773.14s:  a lot of people have been talking about, but we have to wait and see if that's what materializes or
777.86s:  not. Again, it looks like they're playing the cards really, really close to the chest. So as always,
784.02s:  if you have any questions, anything you want me to take a look at, let me know. Be an outlier. See you all later.
