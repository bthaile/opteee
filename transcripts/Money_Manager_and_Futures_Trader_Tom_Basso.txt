2.32s: hey everybody so i am super stoked i
5.36s: have tom bosso here i actually listened
9.04s: to how to pronounce your name i hope i
10.56s: didn't kill it from it oh you did it
12.16s: perfectly it's italian basso yeah there
14.64s: we go good so first off you know welcome
17.28s: to the channel we had a chance just to
18.72s: talk for a few minutes you know get uh
20.56s: generally acquainted but um i'm really
22.96s: looking forward to your perspective here
25.52s: so when you see me looking down it's
27.12s: because i have my handy-dandy notebook
29.76s: because i'm polish and i can't remember
31.76s: things from so many concussions i'm 69
34.40s: and i can't remember things yeah
38.00s: but
39.28s: realistically i think
41.04s: one of the really fun
43.68s: parts of my youtube channel is just
46.80s: connecting with people like you with a
49.52s: very different background something that
51.36s: i
52.00s: know very very little about and i'm
53.60s: really excited to dive into that so
55.52s: first off thank you so much for uh
57.20s: coming on and chatting for a while it's
59.44s: certainly my pleasure and thank you for
61.12s: your service thank you oh my god the
63.20s: marine thing on the back wall there
65.20s: that's right yeah a lot of people are
66.56s: like what is all that crap on your walls
68.72s: i got like knives ale horns i got a
71.12s: tomahawk all sorts of little doodads
72.96s: hung up my wife loves it let me tell you
75.04s: you probably know how to use them
78.48s: um
79.52s: so i figure you know always helpful to
82.40s: start with a bit of background and what
85.52s: led me to you is i was looking through
88.40s: just twitter and your name popped up and
90.64s: i was looking through your page a little
91.76s: bit and i was like oh okay
93.60s: this is like
94.96s: just a couple things lined up that
97.36s: really piqued my interest obviously the
99.68s: money manager background that you have
102.08s: is always of interest just because it's
104.56s: such a
105.76s: different world than retail trading um
109.12s: maybe not you know completely disparate
111.44s: but i'm sure you could share a little
112.96s: more about that in a little bit but then
114.64s: the other thing
115.92s: was you know the part about like futures
119.20s: in currency trading still you know we
121.20s: were talking a little bit about hogs and
123.52s: lumber just a few minutes ago and i was
125.44s: like to me that's actually really
127.84s: interesting that
129.28s: you have that money manager background
131.60s: obviously still very active as a trader
133.76s: so first off
135.36s: i would love to just get a you know
137.28s: quick synopsis of how you got started in
141.28s: the markets and what did that look like
144.00s: for you
145.12s: yeah i was a chemical engineer out of
147.12s: clarkson university up in northern new
148.88s: york this is back in 1974 at the end of
151.76s: a 50 down market on the s p
155.60s: so
156.40s: i'm making
157.84s: 12 000 a year and in those days 12 000 a
160.80s: year was a lot of money
162.80s: and uh so i started sucking money into a
166.72s: stock account at lunch a bunch of us
168.48s: engineers would sit around at lunch and
170.88s: talk about investments and
173.52s: what newsletters we were reading and
175.28s: what their our brokers told us and
177.68s: sharing ideas and eventually led to an
180.32s: investment club of some sort and
182.80s: another guy and myself started
184.48s: practically managing it
186.40s: de facto because nobody else in the club
188.64s: really could
189.76s: had any energy to do anything so
192.80s: little by little we took over that and
194.40s: it kind of raised a bunch of money and
197.52s: uh
198.32s: we hooked up with the third guy and uh
200.96s: that ended up forming a firm investment
203.52s: advisory firm which we ran part-time for
206.24s: about three years or so while we were
208.48s: still working as during the day as
210.48s: chemical engineers and one thing led to
213.04s: another pretty soon we have enough money
214.56s: under management we can afford my salary
216.96s: outside of the chemical company so i
219.04s: leave and i open up an office and the
221.20s: whole thing goes crazy and i eventually
223.04s: sold my shares in that and ended up
224.80s: forming trendstat which was my firm for
227.60s: i think around 28 years or so and we
230.32s: expanded into all sorts of areas
232.24s: currencies futures
233.84s: mutual fund timing we did a little
235.52s: stocks in the early going
237.44s: even traded some treasury bonds along
239.52s: the way when we had to do
241.68s: use the treasury bonds for collateral
244.00s: against the futures transactions
246.64s: the laws have evolved over the years and
248.72s: things that could happen today
252.00s: i mean literally didn't exist back then
254.40s: right you would have really been
256.72s: inventing the wheel if you would have
259.28s: just been all by yourself and probably
261.76s: never raise a dollar
263.44s: so i tried to stay
265.44s: with what i knew could be interesting to
268.32s: clients but then
269.92s: you mentioned in your questions
273.44s: you know so i've gone from just an
275.60s: amateur now all of a sudden i was
277.36s: trading my own money that was successful
279.20s: now i'm managing other people's money
281.36s: and now i got my own firm and it grows
283.68s: to 600 million and i'm trading
286.40s: money for
287.44s: you know merrill lynch and chase and all
289.44s: sorts of big banks and
291.84s: the world is just completely
294.24s: going crazy new market wizards come out
296.72s: i'm now mr serenity so
299.20s: everybody knows who i am i'm getting a
301.04s: lot of people stopping by to say hi and
303.52s: down in scottsdale where our office was
305.60s: and um you know the world kind of went
307.60s: nuts for about at least three four years
310.08s: and then
311.12s: and then it just kind of fizzled the
312.40s: currency business uh when the euro came
314.56s: into being
315.76s: gosh about 15 different pairs that i
317.84s: traded disappeared so the
319.68s: diversification went down
322.24s: and a lot of big institutions get really
324.64s: cold feet quickly
326.32s: uh it's like they didn't know what to
328.48s: expect they it's like they sort of they
330.88s: didn't
332.24s: mind having currencies and it wasn't
333.92s: like there was a lot of losses
336.16s: but they just saw the potential for
338.88s: profit to get narrowed and the potential
341.36s: for diversification definitely to go
343.68s: down which does put you in a more
345.68s: vulnerable position i agree with them
347.52s: there i don't agree with them that there
349.60s: isn't still some nice potential in the
351.68s: fx markets and i certainly have made
353.44s: some good money still
355.12s: but
356.40s: um you know the institutions are the
358.32s: institutions they do what they do and
359.92s: they have bureaucracies and committees
362.48s: and when that got you know trentstet
364.56s: then asset center management went down i
366.56s: got to a point where it was
368.72s: probably 60 percent of my time was spent
371.60s: with people coming in and auditing our
373.76s: firm the irs the sec the state of
376.16s: arizona
377.28s: the investment advisory business
380.24s: so the
381.28s: national futures association would come
383.12s: in
384.40s: and our firm was so complex that because
387.04s: we traded so many different things that
389.36s: a good example i was on the board of the
391.28s: national futures association
393.60s: uh representing one of the three slots
396.24s: that were commodity trading advisors
398.96s: and i did that all the way up until i
400.72s: retired and then i resigned from the
402.40s: board since i no longer was a cta i
404.80s: retired all my resignations and
407.28s: happily put a smile on my face and the
409.60s: smile's been there ever since i think
412.32s: uh what ended up happening is they'd
414.64s: send in a somebody to audit us or to
416.96s: review our our stuff and
419.52s: these people generally are six months or
421.60s: less out of school
423.60s: and
424.64s: i've got
425.76s: foreign exchange going on i've got
427.76s: futures going on i've got mutual fund
429.60s: timing going on
431.68s: i've got hundreds of clients
433.84s: everything's automated
435.68s: unbelievably
437.28s: uh you know it takes us maybe
439.52s: in the afternoon it took us 15 20
441.68s: minutes to run
443.04s: hundreds of accounts across
445.36s: dozens of trading desks across i don't
447.68s: even know how many positions probably
449.68s: hundreds of positions
451.52s: and would transmit them all all in 20
453.92s: minutes and uh
455.92s: and so these people would come in and i
457.84s: felt like i was
459.36s: okay i'm kind of obligated i'm on the
461.04s: board of the nfa
462.88s: i got to be polite to these people i got
464.56s: to try to help but it's part of the
465.92s: organization i'm on the board of
468.24s: i felt like i'd spend days and days
472.40s: teaching these kids what they're really
475.28s: should be asking me and then teaching
477.68s: them how to answer yes exactly
480.48s: and it just seemed awfully
483.52s: big waste of time and i about 60 percent
486.16s: of my time
487.44s: towards the end was done in
489.92s: in what i call non-productive to the
492.08s: client the client's paying me money to
493.84s: manage their money
495.44s: but only 40 of my time is able to be
498.32s: managing their money or inventing new
500.24s: and better trading strategies or working
502.40s: on the position sizing algorithm some
504.80s: more or trying to find new markets we
506.72s: can trade or
508.00s: all the things you do that try to help
510.24s: improve value-added to the client
513.12s: i couldn't do it i was tied up in
515.52s: reading legal documents and running over
517.76s: accounting
519.12s: programs and it just seemed like
522.24s: and and that's not what i really thought
524.16s: was fun in life i wanted to
526.08s: i got in the money management business
527.60s: because i really liked managing monies i
529.68s: decided finally i don't really need the
531.68s: money
532.64s: why am i doing this so we found
536.08s: our employees a number of opportunities
538.72s: out there and they scattered to the four
541.36s: winds some of them actually went into
543.04s: retirement with me others
545.84s: found other positions uh some of them
548.56s: fairly
549.44s: unbelievably substantial compared to
551.36s: where they were at at my place so
553.52s: good for them and um
555.76s: you know
556.88s: life goes on and
558.40s: i've enjoyed retirement now for some 18
561.04s: years right
562.80s: i've only worked 28 so 10 more years and
565.76s: retirement becomes my number one job in
568.56s: my life
569.84s: and pretty good job yeah so
572.96s: that's kind of the evolution all the way
575.44s: from starting out as a chemical engineer
577.12s: to retirement sort of but
579.36s: uh
580.80s: hopefully that answered your couple
582.48s: questions there it does but as with any
585.84s: good answer to a question
588.08s: i have more uh so the first one you were
592.00s: um talking about this is really just
595.20s: geographic question for for my own
597.68s: understanding so you said that you were
598.96s: in upstate new york was that just for
601.28s: college or were you when you were um a
604.08s: chemical engineer did you move to
605.60s: arizona st louis no st louis oh okay got
608.40s: it very early stages of monsanto the
611.04s: famous company that invented all the
613.36s: herbicides and everything okay got it i
616.08s: was i was making industrial chemicals it
618.24s: had nothing to do with all that ag stuff
620.16s: but that was a different division but
621.76s: yeah i was a chemical engineer designing
624.08s: actual
625.28s: you know orthonortrichler benzene was my
628.00s: first project know all about that
630.84s: acetaminophen i did some vanilla
632.72s: flavoring
634.00s: uh i did a project for that um we we did
637.20s: some um
638.56s: uh a plant for brazil
640.80s: uh sao paulo brazil um so it it was fun
644.96s: for a while and then after about five
646.56s: years i realized you know it's kind of
648.08s: the same thing over and over again
649.84s: you've designed one pump you've kind of
651.84s: designed them all you know they don't
653.44s: get out they don't end up being all that
655.36s: much different so
657.28s: i had very high ratings
659.52s: that was promoted as fast as i could be
662.24s: i eventually moved to the business side
663.92s: of the company i ended up getting an mba
666.40s: thought that would be my career path
668.00s: more on the business side of the
669.20s: chemical industry industry and
671.84s: and then along came this money
673.36s: management thing and okay i'm making
675.28s: this over here and i'm making i could
677.20s: make that over there it's the same
678.80s: number right and i this is really
682.08s: intriguing i could have my own business
683.92s: and that would be fun
685.76s: so i got it
688.08s: into the money management business and
690.16s: never looked back
691.44s: so what can you just walk me through
693.84s: where are you from originally
695.52s: syracuse new york on the west side a
697.36s: little village called salve it's like 10
699.68s: 000 italians everybody's got an i o
702.72s: or a at the end of their name okay got
705.28s: it because i went to rit so oh yeah sure
707.92s: yeah so i'm generally familiar with
710.00s: upstate new york area that's why i was
711.36s: curious about that i would have
712.40s: considered them but they didn't have
713.84s: chemical engineering at the time yeah
715.84s: well now they got all pretty much any
717.68s: engineering you can think of um
720.72s: i had a good friend that did like
722.00s: packaging science
723.84s: which that's actually a pretty
725.36s: fascinating gig but anyways
727.20s: um so then you went to this job in saint
732.48s: louis
734.08s: i stayed there for about uh i was
736.48s: probably an engineer or in the business
738.32s: side for
739.76s: maybe eight years now okay
741.84s: and then by then i was full-time money
744.08s: management okay so the money management
746.32s: started in st louis and then what moved
748.48s: you to arizona well that was a strange
750.96s: thing financial planner seemed to like
753.28s: working with me because i was so
756.24s: i don't know
757.36s: i hopefully pleasant to be around with
759.92s: the clients i knew my stuff i was highly
762.08s: technically capable
764.32s: a lot of the financial planners lean
765.92s: towards the
767.92s: the uh salesman side you know they they
770.24s: have to represent a lot of different
772.48s: types of strategies and products to
774.40s: their clients
775.68s: so that they have to be outgoing
777.36s: personalities and go out and find the
779.60s: clients and you know have lunch with
781.28s: them and do all the things that
782.96s: that more the sales type of the industry
785.20s: does and
787.20s: when every anybody had a challenge you
789.76s: know like they had a big pension plan
791.52s: and
792.24s: they're wondering what are they supposed
793.52s: to do with it you know
795.12s: are there they're going into retirement
797.36s: now they've got this huge rollover what
799.04s: do i do with it a lot of times i'd be
801.28s: brought in just to talk through the
803.20s: issues and i knew so much about so many
805.84s: things in the industry
807.52s: that i could help narrow things down to
810.32s: crystallize their thinking and many
811.84s: times we ended up with some of the money
813.52s: to manage
815.04s: so it was sort of marketing on my side
816.96s: too
818.08s: and it turned out that when i looked at
820.48s: the number of clients i had in st louis
822.24s: and the number of clients i had in
823.60s: phoenix and we did business in all sorts
825.84s: of places california florida texas we
828.48s: had a number of clients strewn all over
830.56s: around the world really in currency
832.16s: trading
833.28s: and so
834.96s: what would ended up happening is i had
837.04s: the most concentration of of
839.60s: clients in the phoenix metropolitan area
842.88s: uh the word had spread mouth to mouth
845.76s: and clients had talked to other clients
847.76s: and we'd end up with a strange phone
849.12s: call out of the blue and when are you
850.88s: coming down to phoenix next i'd like to
852.72s: meet with you and stuff so
854.56s: it just kept going and i
856.40s: love golf and i got really tired in st
859.12s: louis and putting my clubs up in about
860.96s: october and pulling them back out in
862.64s: april to play in the mud right and uh
865.28s: here i i play year-round and it's
867.76s: gorgeous it's right off heaven so for me
870.80s: as a golfer this is like uh the place to
873.68s: live and then i thought to myself well
876.00s: this is probably where i'd end up
877.36s: retiring anyway
878.96s: so
879.76s: i might as well move the company while
882.24s: i have the energy and the money and
884.64s: everything else to do it uh it cost me a
887.04s: quarter of a million dollars to move the
888.80s: company here overnight and we had
890.88s: airborne express we had 40 computers to
893.84s: move we had rock collections we had a
896.24s: boat that we moved and not mine my head
899.84s: trader
900.72s: uh we had china collections we had all
904.40s: sorts of weird everybody's cars and
907.36s: their spouses we had we booked an entire
910.48s: auto carrier straight through husband
912.80s: and wife team
914.24s: and everybody showed up at work with
915.84s: their cars we loaded them on and off we
918.40s: off it goes to phoenix so it was a
920.96s: fun overnight experience but by 4th of
923.92s: july weekend
925.60s: friday afternoon we shut it down
927.04s: everybody got on the plane at lambert
929.04s: field in st louis we arrived in phoenix
931.76s: that night at about
933.28s: six seven o'clock i had dinner
936.00s: showed up next day at uh
938.56s: saturday
939.60s: of fourth of july weekend and and the
941.60s: weekend that fourth of july happened
943.60s: that fall on a tuesday so monday was a
945.76s: dead day too we had a four days to play
948.08s: with but by by thurs by tuesday
950.88s: afternoon
952.16s: even monday we needed to be up and
954.08s: running right preferably sunday because
956.40s: the currency markets were going to be
957.76s: open
958.56s: in some places of the world on monday uh
961.28s: yeah guess what britain doesn't
964.00s: celebrate the 4th of july
966.32s: think about it unbelievable so

971.04s: to be operational and we were
972.88s: operational by
974.56s: completely by sunday morning
977.20s: that's impressive so
978.96s: for i'm in the marine corps as a
980.88s: logistics officer so listening to you
983.12s: talk about the logistics there that you
985.60s: know what i'm talking about it's just
986.96s: speaking to me yeah because
988.88s: we've got uh we've got airborne express
991.20s: with a box
992.72s: with packing material sitting in front
995.12s: of every computer we're running the last
997.20s: run of the day on currencies
999.20s: and as soon as it's
1000.96s: everybody's that's left in the company
1002.80s: every half the company's already down in
1004.72s: phoenix get ready and the other half is
1007.44s: finishing up st louis
1009.28s: as soon as that last one hit it
1011.84s: successfully and we called new york and
1014.08s: they said yeah we got it
1015.92s: that computer went down they picked it
1017.76s: up stuck it in the box they got the box
1020.80s: is sitting on a dolly
1023.20s: and they're out the door hitting the
1025.44s: afternoon run for
1027.28s: airborne express they deliver it in
1029.52s: scottsdale to our new office uh sometime
1032.16s: about like 10 30 the next morning that's
1034.40s: so cool
1036.40s: that's a really good planning
1039.36s: yeah we
1040.40s: that was highly uh highly highly
1043.68s: designed it took us probably the better
1045.52s: part of
1047.44s: six to nine months well from start to
1049.36s: finish it might have been almost a year
1051.12s: but from the time we told the employees
1053.60s: and actually started planning some of
1055.36s: the really really dtl stuff it was
1058.32s: it was a real heavy six months of
1060.00s: planning and getting every detail
1061.68s: figured out every computer where it was
1063.44s: going to go do we need to replace it we
1065.52s: had a whole new network we had a whole
1067.12s: new computers down at scottsdale but we
1069.44s: brought some of the old equipment as
1070.80s: well as backups and
1072.72s: uh we had
1074.16s: a new design to the office so that we
1076.16s: had places where we could run
1078.48s: back in those days you don't have so
1080.16s: much this but back in those days the
1082.00s: computers were so slow
1083.76s: we'd started
1084.96s: you know some kind of a big study
1086.96s: and we'd started on like monday
1089.36s: afternoon and it would run till thursday
1091.28s: morning or friday morning or something
1093.68s: so you'd have to have these computers
1095.12s: sitting on shelves kind of away from
1097.04s: everybody so that nobody would touch it
1099.52s: and right you'd literally take the
1102.56s: keyboard
1104.08s: and shut it off
1106.88s: so that nobody could go up and
1108.40s: accidentally
1109.84s: yeah hit a keyboard you know
1112.24s: interrupt the flow of this massive study
1114.80s: we're doing so that we designed our
1117.92s: operations so there's computer labs with
1120.08s: multiple
1121.12s: layers of micros computers that
1124.80s: could run individual studies and be
1126.48s: independent from the other ones
1128.48s: and so some of our research people could
1130.24s: tie into any one of those machines by
1132.16s: hitting a couple switches
1133.92s: that's pretty crazy now because i mean
1136.24s: obviously now we have python or adam and
1140.40s: you know it's a couple minutes if that
1142.48s: the world is different yeah
1144.64s: cfc-sharp
1146.48s: so what
1147.60s: one of the one of the things that i was
1149.52s: really really curious about is when you
1152.40s: first got into trading
1154.72s: what
1155.84s: like while you were still a chemical
1157.76s: engineer what what trading were you
1159.84s: doing like what kind of trading did you
1161.76s: actually start with stocks
1164.40s: okay and
1165.92s: it was low price stocks was my favorite
1168.16s: i tended to like to buy stuff that was
1170.24s: less than ten dollars a share
1172.16s: i felt like the percent return on
1174.16s: investment was the highest
1176.08s: uh it was trying to find small companies
1178.32s: that would be the next microsoft or you
1180.56s: know ibm or whatever
1182.80s: and i had screens that i would try to do
1185.52s: back in those days a lot of it was done
1187.04s: by paper there were no computers i had
1189.44s: to
1190.16s: add subtract multiply divide calculator
1193.04s: uh 1980 is when you really had the ibm
1196.56s: first ibm pc come out and i bought one
1199.20s: and that was revolutionary
1201.60s: very expensive too
1203.28s: um for for me at that age uh but it was
1207.36s: well worth it it leveraged my time i
1209.44s: never looked back i bought the first ibm
1211.52s: at and kept expanding and
1214.56s: just
1215.52s: ended up with 40 computers at the peak
1217.60s: and 10 people to run them got it
1220.64s: so you started with stocks
1223.28s: and then
1224.32s: what what happened what
1227.60s: here's the mental process and um
1230.72s: it's a very interesting one uh to me
1233.36s: because i have evolved over what 50
1236.64s: years or so now
1238.16s: and it goes like this
1240.08s: if you start out in stocks and you're
1241.60s: just buying long
1243.76s: in the back of your mind you're thinking
1245.20s: you know especially me because i came
1246.96s: out in 73 74
1249.20s: i just saw when i was junior senior
1251.92s: college i'm tracking stocks to see what
1254.08s: companies that i'm considering going to
1256.64s: look like financially because i'd like
1258.72s: to go to a company that was doing real
1260.40s: well
1261.52s: so i thought i'd you know i'd go to plot
1263.52s: all these chemical companies so i had
1264.96s: dow and dupont and monsanto and shell
1267.84s: oil and all sorts of exxon
1270.88s: and
1272.88s: you start realizing when you think about
1275.12s: it that hey you know if the stock market
1277.36s: were to go down 50 cents on a dollar
1279.20s: again 50 percent
1281.44s: or worse or you know say it's a
1283.44s: depression 1929
1286.40s: whatever
1288.32s: i'm gonna really lose a lot of money
1291.60s: value of my account
1293.44s: wouldn't it be nice to have something
1295.20s: that could make money
1296.80s: during that period
1298.72s: to at least diversify myself and offset
1301.60s: some of it
1303.12s: and that got me thinking about
1305.36s: futures because
1307.28s: in commodities because uh
1309.20s: back in those days you could trade say a
1311.12s: corn contract it didn't cost you that
1313.12s: much
1314.40s: and uh
1315.92s: i thought to myself well corn probably
1318.00s: doesn't really care what the stock
1319.28s: market's doing today right and and stock
1321.76s: market rut doesn't really care what corn
1323.44s: is doing today so there's two things
1325.76s: that could do their own thing
1328.00s: and then i started thinking about well
1329.52s: how about cattle
1331.28s: how about gold
1333.12s: how about
1334.56s: bonds
1335.92s: and little by little i kept adding
1339.04s: and i just
1340.64s: it was this
1341.92s: sort of a
1343.44s: approach that in my mind is trying to
1345.36s: get to sort of an all-weather
1348.16s: type of strategy where
1350.24s: you know throw some hail at me a tornado
1353.12s: or hurricane sunny day i don't really
1355.68s: care
1356.48s: every day
1358.16s: here at my office is the same as the day
1360.48s: before no matter what happens in the
1362.08s: world and uh i've got eight different
1364.96s: strategies running
1367.12s: across futures and etfs and securities
1369.92s: probably at any one time somewhere
1371.84s: between 40 to 60 positions
1375.36s: that cover the gamut and all sorts of
1378.16s: things could happen and you look at my
1381.60s: my portfolio on a day like today and out
1383.84s: of say
1385.20s: around 50 to 56 positions probably
1388.72s: i'm running probably
1391.44s: 60 to 65 percent of them went my way
1393.92s: today the other 35 went against me the
1396.16s: ones that went against me didn't go
1397.68s: against me that much the ones that went
1399.36s: in my favor went big right so i had a
1402.00s: really good day but that's just a
1403.76s: typical day of what
1405.52s: what goes on here i don't
1407.20s: win on everything every day that i trade
1410.16s: i don't even try right uh i'm trying to
1412.96s: get lots of different exposures so that
1414.88s: no matter what the world and the markets
1417.52s: throw at me
1418.80s: i'm just sort of cruising along
1421.20s: right another another day
1423.44s: so for for context um
1427.04s: when i started trading i started with
1429.76s: some stock but then i got into
1431.60s: derivatives mostly options though
1434.48s: um and i've been trading futures for a
1437.04s: while now but i find it really
1439.52s: interesting
1440.80s: that you even stumbled into them because
1443.12s: what like what year was it when you
1444.96s: started like working with with futures
1448.00s: probably 1976 which i actually i'm not
1451.84s: familiar do you know when futures were
1453.52s: like launched like on actual exchanges i
1456.32s: know they've been around forever i don't
1459.04s: but yeah
1460.80s: there's different um i mean now there's
1463.84s: i don't know 75 to 100 futures you could
1466.88s: readily get to around the world
1468.56s: electronically especially
1470.80s: back in those days um you know there was
1473.44s: maybe 20 25 markets got it that were
1476.48s: deep enough and everything was traded by
1478.88s: hand so basically i would call a
1481.04s: commodity broker commodity broker would
1483.92s: write a ticket up by hand
1486.56s: take it over to his teletype operator
1488.64s: they would type it in it would go to the
1490.16s: floor the floor would either
1492.96s: signal it into the pit or they give it
1495.20s: to a runner the runner would run it out
1497.60s: there hand the piece of paper to the guy
1499.60s: in the pit guy in the pit would do his
1501.52s: hand signals and buy or sell
1503.68s: he'd write up who he bought or sold it
1505.44s: to toss the ticket on the floor the
1507.44s: runner would pick it up take it back to
1509.44s: the teletype operator teletype operator
1512.16s: back to the broker's office teletype
1514.96s: then sends the little message over to
1517.28s: the broker's desk
1518.96s: he then calls me for my fill
1522.24s: wow nowadays
1523.68s: that's so straightforward yeah nowadays
1526.32s: i sit here and i go oh
1529.04s: i think i got one too many contracts of
1531.68s: corn there i need to peel off one so i
1534.16s: get my cursor and i
1536.00s: go
1536.80s: corn
1538.00s: sell one
1539.20s: mark it
1540.64s: submit and it's beeping over here on the
1543.36s: right side already done and then i watch
1545.84s: my position size go down by one over
1548.32s: from my corner and i'm done
1550.32s: it takes
1552.00s: less than 10 seconds to do everything so
1554.24s: how did i'm really curious so
1557.04s: like like i was saying when i started
1558.48s: with options there was definitely you
1560.64s: know material available right with like
1563.04s: we have books one of my favorites is
1565.04s: options as a strategic investment um but
1568.24s: i mean i started trading options mostly
1571.76s: in like 2008
1573.36s: so even like youtube and stuff like that
1575.76s: wasn't huge then it existed but it
1577.68s: wasn't huge with that data how did you
1579.92s: even come across futures let alone like
1583.28s: get to the level of proficiency where
1586.16s: you know you're running 60 different
1588.88s: um trades at once with it well the first
1591.60s: trade i did i remember was in corn and i
1594.00s: had no idea what i was doing
1596.40s: and i started with six hundred dollars
1598.72s: and immediately went to four hundred
1600.24s: dollars and and then i closed it
1603.12s: and i
1605.68s: they said what happened
1608.00s: it was a good hand
1609.76s: so i had to figure it out little by
1611.44s: little
1612.64s: you know talking to the broker reading a
1614.56s: few books nothing comes to mind as being
1616.88s: significant but just figuring out the
1618.40s: math of it got it and then
1620.80s: i guess the profound moment for me was
1622.88s: to sit there with if you remember
1624.72s: point-and-figure charts they're still
1626.16s: available on some platforms hardly
1628.56s: anybody uses them anymore
1630.56s: back in the day when you didn't have
1631.84s: computers you had little cards on the
1633.68s: floor so they put x's up and zeroes down
1636.24s: or o's down and
1637.76s: they could track a lot of price
1639.36s: information on a small card and that
1641.44s: card could fit in their pocket with a
1642.88s: pencil
1643.84s: because they're out there without a desk
1645.52s: and no computers right so
1647.68s: that was point and figure was really big
1649.76s: back in the 20s and 30s and 40s
1653.76s: before computers but bar charts and
1655.60s: candlesticks and all that are now the
1657.92s: fancy stuff and very colorful
1660.96s: so
1662.00s: back in those days when i had that i
1663.60s: took a bunch of point and figure charts
1665.20s: about all the major commodities that i
1666.96s: could possibly trade and i figured that
1669.20s: out by just looking at the wall street
1671.36s: journal and they had a page
1673.44s: and i had saved all these wall street
1674.88s: journal
1675.76s: third sections or whatever that were
1677.28s: nothing but data and i had
1679.60s: literally in my closet i had stacks and
1682.80s: shelves of
1684.64s: labeled by which year is which and going
1687.52s: back for
1689.04s: a decade or something
1691.28s: so if i wanted to do a study on futures
1693.52s: i just resigned myself to getting a long
1697.52s: drink of iced tea or something
1700.24s: and sitting at my desk
1702.00s: and putting a big pile there and then
1703.68s: saying okay what was the price of corn
1705.52s: today
1706.88s: and then put it over here and then do
1708.64s: that it would take me a weekend
1710.08s: sometimes
1711.36s: and i would just go through and i just
1713.12s: do one market and do all the point and
1714.72s: figure
1716.48s: what happened after i had a bunch of
1718.00s: these charts is one day i decided you
1720.80s: know
1722.16s: a lot of money could be made in the very
1724.48s: big runs
1725.92s: right so what i did is i laid the charts
1728.88s: down on the floor never forget this it
1730.88s: was in my living room
1732.40s: and i'm sitting on the sofa and i
1734.16s: cleared away this massive space
1736.72s: and i just put all the charts facing me
1740.08s: and from that far distance i could see
1742.32s: every trade that i wanted to make sure i
1744.08s: was in at
1745.28s: right so i kind of
1748.00s: circled them in a way i i yelled them in
1750.32s: so i knew this is a trade i need this is
1753.12s: a trade i would like this is a trade i
1754.72s: would like
1755.76s: and so i i took the top 10 things that i
1758.88s: could see from a distance
1760.88s: and i brought them all back up to the
1762.40s: coffee table level now they're right in
1764.48s: front of me again
1766.64s: i said what are the
1768.24s: common characteristics here of these
1770.24s: trades these are the ones i want the
1772.40s: other stuff is garbage it's not going to
1774.40s: get you anything
1775.60s: these are going to make you a lot of
1776.80s: money
1778.00s: so when i did that i discovered
1780.88s: something that i thought i could live
1782.88s: with that got nine out of the ten of
1785.28s: those trades
1787.28s: that was the start of it
1789.20s: that's
1790.24s: really really interesting and then one
1792.72s: thing led to another and i started
1794.32s: realizing
1796.32s: that just trend following was a an easy
1799.60s: way
1800.48s: to pick up all of those trades ten out
1802.40s: of ten right don't filter it too much
1805.20s: try to get in on every one of those big
1806.88s: trades because they pay for a whole lot
1808.48s: of losses right
1810.32s: that's interesting so do you think that
1812.32s: like this cyclicality of futures was
1815.92s: part of that analysis you were kind of
1818.24s: because uh like when you when you first
1820.56s: start trading something like corn you
1822.32s: know we may not think about the harvest
1824.32s: season or the planting seed you know
1825.60s: what i mean stuff like that
1827.28s: um
1828.80s: okay and then
1831.12s: if it's going up i want to be long if
1832.64s: it's going down i want to be short
1834.56s: got it so
1835.76s: generally irrespective of like the the
1838.88s: future you know
1840.56s: um characteristics themselves but more
1843.04s: how is it working on the chart no
1844.48s: predictions whatsoever just
1847.20s: look how it's moving and go with it you
1849.36s: know i've got it strictly measuring the
1852.08s: trend if the trend is up i want to be
1853.60s: long if it's down i want to be short
1855.92s: the beauty of futures
1857.52s: you can go in both directions right and
1859.76s: uh
1861.04s: so when the stock market was having a
1862.48s: struggle over in my stock portfolio side
1865.52s: i could be cleaning up over in the
1867.52s: future side and you know life's good
1870.00s: just keep going
1871.92s: as stocks are down and futures get up
1874.40s: the futures get a little more dominant
1876.56s: my math would have me taking money from
1879.20s: futures and moving it over into my stock
1881.04s: portfolio so now i'm buying stocks cheap
1883.60s: with the extra money i've made over in
1885.20s: futures right that protects my drawdown
1887.68s: coming up in futures that sooner or
1889.20s: later is going to happen
1890.64s: gets me some cheap prices over in stocks
1892.64s: and now that goes crazy and maybe
1894.72s: futures is struggling and
1896.72s: again the other way
1898.64s: goes
1899.44s: it turns around and i take some money
1900.88s: from the stocks i put us over in the
1902.24s: futures and i keep balancing and
1904.24s: rebalancing and rebalancing and
1906.56s: it improves your return to risk ratios
1909.12s: and it uh
1910.64s: at this stage you know that's all i try
1912.72s: to go for is very high return to risk
1914.64s: ratios
1916.00s: i i i like to get to
1918.40s: little or no drawdowns i haven't got
1920.24s: there yet but i keep working at it
1922.48s: um
1923.44s: because then your denominator the risk
1925.68s: side gets to
1927.52s: close to zero and your return to risk
1929.76s: it's close to infinity right
1932.48s: that's a high comfort level for most
1934.24s: people and certainly for a guy like me
1936.32s: in retirement it's perfect i'd rather
1938.48s: not
1939.28s: have a lot of violent moves um
1942.16s: sometimes it's unavoidable i mean if
1944.32s: crude oil one day is going negative like
1946.64s: it did last year
1948.72s: i'm short there's not much you can do
1950.40s: about it you just have to kind of enjoy
1952.00s: that ride and then deal with whatever
1954.08s: comes out of it typically a lot of
1955.84s: brokers close those positions for you
1958.48s: whether you wanted to have them or not
1961.04s: but it was at a nice profit so
1963.28s: yeah and i didn't i just put the
1964.56s: position on for the next month so
1967.92s: i was still short but i uh but i took in
1970.56s: the profit on the one that went to
1971.92s: negative
1972.96s: and i think that that's
1974.48s: the lesson you'll learn here is that
1977.12s: you're looking at a lot of different
1978.40s: return streams over a lot of different
1980.08s: time periods over a lot of different
1981.68s: markets
1984.32s: and
1985.36s: your strategy
1987.52s: dictates the sort of the personality of
1989.60s: that return stream so if you plot
1992.32s: any strategy against any set of markets
1994.96s: and with a certain
1996.64s: logical position sizing algorithm you're
1998.96s: going to get some kind of equity curve
2000.56s: going up the page
2002.64s: and what you find is
2004.80s: one of my friends uh lawrence benzdorp i
2007.04s: don't know if you've ever heard of him
2008.16s: automating your stock portfolio great
2010.16s: book on multiple systems trading he
2012.48s: lives down in brazil in a beautiful
2014.56s: place
2015.60s: um
2016.84s: he uh you know talks about when a track
2019.76s: record's going up the page and then has
2021.44s: this little dips called draw down and
2023.04s: then they go back up and resume and make
2024.72s: new highs
2025.92s: that's kind of like a hole it's like a
2027.84s: pothole
2028.96s: right and your job when you're trying to
2031.52s: deal with multiple systems and trying to
2033.52s: think about diversifying yourself to try
2035.92s: to improve your return to risk is to
2037.68s: fill that hole
2039.20s: so ask yourself
2041.12s: why did that loss occur
2043.68s: and what could you do to fill the hole
2046.16s: is there an option strategy is there a
2049.44s: hedging strategy that could have
2051.44s: diminished the hole maybe you don't fill
2053.12s: it all the way maybe you just make the
2054.64s: hole a lot less deep
2057.12s: but you keep trying to straighten that
2059.12s: line out so it's just a smooth upward
2063.52s: sloping uh line up the up the hill right
2066.64s: right
2067.68s: if you have that you know if you had a
2069.92s: line that looked like a cd or something
2072.56s: and and you were and yet you were making
2074.56s: good returns in the markets that would
2076.24s: be pretty nice so it's our goal i
2078.72s: haven't gotten there yet but uh keep
2080.64s: trying yeah
2082.16s: i think it's a good uh good goal to
2084.88s: shoot for at least though yeah um so
2088.32s: that leads me to kind of
2090.80s: one last historic question for you again
2094.00s: this one is kind of a selfish question
2095.68s: i'm just curious about it
2097.28s: um but you mentioned mutual fund timing
2100.88s: um as you know part of the i'm just
2102.72s: curious what what did that look like
2104.32s: because i've heard different variants of
2106.08s: that before but
2108.16s: i'm kidding yeah well of course today
2110.16s: you have exchange traded funds so mutual
2112.32s: fund timing is just uh
2114.24s: is for the dinosaurs like me back in the
2116.32s: old days um what you had to do
2119.68s: you've only had when i came out of
2120.96s: school i think there was 500 mutual
2123.28s: funds or something like that in the
2124.72s: world
2125.84s: nowadays there's i don't know how many
2127.60s: etfs i mean thousands and thousands yeah
2130.48s: and uh
2132.56s: they trade tick by tick i mean there's a
2134.40s: bid aspect all day long
2136.40s: uh so
2138.56s: mutual fund timing looked like this
2140.16s: again this is getting back into the
2142.32s: ancient years but computers might have
2145.20s: just barely started coming into play
2147.92s: but basically about three o'clock in the
2149.84s: afternoon
2151.44s: st louis time we would
2153.68s: have to figure out whether we're going
2156.08s: on a signal long or selling whatever we
2159.28s: were doing or just doing nothing and
2160.96s: staying with what we had but let's say
2163.12s: we had to buy
2164.80s: we would have to get that signal at
2167.04s: about right at three
2169.04s: have it already pre-calculated have
2170.72s: everything faxable ready to go
2174.00s: we would fax it into a trading desk
2177.84s: by 3 15 when the futures markets
2181.44s: kind of closed and the after market
2183.68s: trading finished up they had to know
2187.36s: whether they were buying or selling and
2188.96s: how much and then try to adjust their
2190.96s: positions so that they could keep the
2193.20s: mutual fund
2194.64s: properly positioned for all these assets
2196.72s: particularly important if you're selling
2198.88s: they need to raise cash to pay you off
2201.52s: they need to sell something in those
2203.04s: last 15 minutes so
2204.96s: there was a lot of that and a lot of it
2206.64s: was manual and and
2208.56s: the bigger you got the more the mutual
2210.40s: funds hated you
2212.08s: and
2213.12s: then the rydexes of the world came in in
2215.44s: the early years where uh they invented
2217.76s: mutual funds that were geared towards
2220.08s: timing they welcomed timers right they
2222.80s: got tons and tons of business from the
2224.56s: timing industry and then of course etf
2227.12s: started coming in and the whole world
2228.72s: changed and now everybody would time
2230.72s: etfs and that's what i trade now i don't
2232.96s: even do mutual funds anymore got it i
2235.52s: use ets i i trade 20 sector funds and
2238.24s: then i have a momentum etf
2240.48s: uh program that our strategy where i
2243.68s: i look for etfs that are
2245.84s: uh with a high relative strength over
2247.84s: the last 30 days and then i try to
2249.76s: concentrate my purchases on those
2252.32s: with fairly tight stops and then let
2254.32s: them run if they want to run and if they
2255.76s: want to turn take me out that's okay
2258.00s: but these are going to be very volatile
2260.40s: kind of make a lot of money in an up
2262.24s: move type
2263.44s: instruments it's only a small portion of
2265.60s: my money so right just another return
2268.40s: stream that's different from the other
2270.08s: return streams
2271.84s: that's super interesting i get i kind of
2274.40s: geek out about some of
2276.40s: i don't know just how things were
2278.64s: um because it's me i think it's helpful
2281.04s: for context because you know the the
2283.28s: market hasn't been around that long and
2284.96s: a lot of people i think get used to the
2287.20s: idea that what they're doing right now
2289.60s: will be working in 15 years
2292.48s: it may or may not so i like to learn
2295.20s: from folks like you that have seen
2297.28s: evolution and how you've adapted
2299.68s: so yeah
2301.20s: you know like there was no bitcoin when
2302.88s: i was in the business there was no
2305.52s: um bitcoin futures i'm trading bitcoin
2308.40s: futures there was none of those just a
2310.08s: few years ago
2311.44s: um
2312.56s: ethereum just came in in december
2314.88s: yep brand new and i'm trading that now
2317.60s: um
2318.88s: so
2319.60s: yeah things evolve which you gotta be on
2321.92s: the lookout for in my mind
2325.12s: is
2326.56s: what viable liquid markets are there out
2329.04s: there and that actually have movement
2332.16s: that are not price fixed by governments
2335.44s: by
2336.72s: something artificial
2338.72s: because the more price movement happens
2340.80s: the more profit a trader can make it
2342.88s: stands to reason if you buy something
2345.04s: and you only sell it here you didn't
2346.56s: make anything right but if you can buy
2348.56s: it here and sell it there
2350.64s: then you're going to make the difference
2352.16s: between these two right and
2354.80s: so you want things that move you like
2356.96s: volatility but you want to be able to
2359.12s: attack
2360.56s: the risk involved i think so many people
2363.12s: out there
2365.04s: including my dad
2367.36s: who liked to buy cds at the savings and
2369.60s: loan was always trying to
2372.00s: be fearful of risk protective of risk
2374.40s: he's trying to provide for his family he
2376.32s: was a postal carrier in the syracuse
2378.64s: area
2379.76s: and
2381.04s: so he didn't have a huge sum of money
2382.88s: and he didn't have a certainly my level
2384.80s: of uh knowledge of investments but
2387.52s: he
2389.92s: thought he was trying to avoid risk by
2392.48s: going to a savings and loan cd
2395.04s: right but then what happened right
2397.52s: reagan reaganomics interest rates went
2399.52s: up savings and loans to the tune of
2401.60s: hundreds of billions of dollars went
2403.52s: under including my dad's money
2406.56s: so it turns out the government came in
2408.48s: and bailed out a whole bunch of people
2410.00s: and my dad was made whole and
2412.32s: he learned his lesson that you know
2414.00s: risk-free isn't exactly risk-free right
2416.80s: and you got to think a little bit more
2418.48s: through these things and i think that
2420.88s: what my lessons that i've learned over
2422.80s: my lifetime is the best way
2425.20s: to handle risk is not to try to avoid it
2427.76s: but instead to try to attack it
2430.56s: so example
2432.08s: mutual fund timing when an early lesson
2434.72s: if i've got a growth stock mutual fund
2436.40s: that's going to go up in an upmarket but
2438.48s: in a down market it's going to get
2439.92s: killed how can i attack the down market
2442.40s: risk well there's a couple different
2444.24s: choices
2445.76s: back then it seemed like the logical
2447.44s: thing was to do is just sell out of it
2449.04s: and go to a money market fund
2451.12s: so put together a trend following model
2453.68s: you're going to miss the top but it's
2455.12s: going to go down a certain amount you're
2456.56s: going to get a signal you're going to
2458.32s: say okay i'm out that's enough of a loss
2460.56s: from the top i'm going to sit out here
2462.96s: and let the market settle down give me a
2465.28s: signal to the upside as soon as i get
2467.52s: that signal i move it back into the risk
2470.72s: so i'm attacking the risk by doing
2472.88s: something against
2474.80s: that which i will cause me to lose it
2477.52s: and
2478.64s: nowadays you could also use a
2480.80s: an index futures head so you could have
2482.72s: the etf on the one side if you wanted to
2486.48s: and
2487.28s: that's going to make money with the palm
2489.20s: going up
2490.72s: and then you could put in place a
2492.32s: futures hedge with a signal
2494.56s: and that's got to make money when it
2496.00s: goes down
2497.44s: if you balance them perfectly
2499.68s: they're going to move together you're
2500.88s: going to make and lose equal amounts of
2502.96s: money
2504.16s: that's another way but that futures
2505.84s: hedge is attacking the risk and i think
2508.72s: the more you attack risk the more you
2510.96s: feel
2512.96s: sort of empowered and relaxed i think
2514.88s: one of the reasons jack schwager always
2516.72s: thought of me as mr serenity is that i
2518.96s: attacked risk across so many different
2520.72s: markets and so easily
2522.72s: that
2524.16s: everything i did was sort of boring
2526.72s: right serene
2528.56s: and i think too many traders get locked
2530.72s: into you know they follow 10 or 20
2533.04s: stocks and they live and die with the
2535.60s: intra-day movements of these 20 things
2538.08s: that they got on five screens in front
2540.72s: of them
2543.36s: that's kind of limiting to me i mean the
2546.80s: action is all in 20 things i've got
2549.52s: hundreds of things i can consider
2551.92s: all automated and it takes me 20 minutes
2553.84s: a day
2554.80s: and the rest of the day i go do other
2556.48s: stuff i was out working on the
2558.24s: subdivisions landscaping for two hours
2560.64s: before lunch right beautiful day you
2563.60s: know sunny out here in scottsdale and
2566.56s: a short sleeve shirt at this point uh
2569.60s: you know a lot of the countries
2571.44s: got the park is on already
2573.36s: and uh you know to me
2576.16s: life can be pretty good to just if
2578.00s: you're thinking through what you're
2579.36s: trying to achieve and you
2581.84s: you kind of systematize it and attack
2584.32s: the risk that you see out there you're
2586.64s: going to smooth things out and it's just
2588.40s: going to make your mental side of
2590.16s: trading so much easier to deal with
2592.00s: you're not going to be
2593.36s: up at night and stressed out and ulcers
2596.48s: and all the things that you see you know
2598.16s: that traders sometimes
2599.92s: stereotypical traitors go through the
2602.64s: wall street wall street the movie you
2604.96s: know guys
2606.48s: i'm not i mean somebody told me to watch
2609.04s: a wall street movie or series that they
2611.20s: really really enjoyed
2612.88s: and i watched the first couple and i
2614.48s: said this is garbage this has nothing to
2616.80s: do with trading in my view it's
2619.76s: it
2620.48s: it was story time the whole time right
2623.28s: it wasn't to me normal mathematical
2626.16s: training that i go through there's no
2628.40s: excitement like that so
2630.48s: yeah it's it's funny so i i have a
2633.84s: mentor that i reference on the channel a
2635.68s: lot just because he's an army doctor um
2638.72s: he's old now he just retired from
2640.48s: training he's in his 80s
2642.32s: um but he has a very similar mindset to
2645.60s: you where you know he said is as long as
2648.88s: you are
2650.64s: you have a well-developed plan in
2652.40s: implementing a plan there's nothing to
2653.76s: get excited about
2655.12s: um and i i really
2658.00s: think that that's an important message
2660.16s: for people because i think a lot of
2661.68s: people are under the impression that the
2663.84s: way to be successful is exactly like you
2665.76s: said have six monitors put more charts
2669.36s: up and you know look at it first yeah
2672.08s: exactly look at it for 16 hours a day
2674.08s: and spaz out about it i had a guy today
2676.96s: on twitter asked me a question he said
2679.28s: you know i really feel like i've
2681.28s: got what i want to do with the stocks
2683.12s: down and i've got my positions and
2686.08s: it usually takes me about you know half
2688.64s: an hour or so a day to get everything
2690.72s: put in place and my stops are there and
2693.28s: everything's great but then i feel
2695.60s: guilty i don't know what i'm supposed to
2697.36s: do the rest of the time
2699.76s: and uh and yet
2702.96s: all these people talk about
2704.96s: trading and you know they're they're
2707.04s: watching this move and that move and
2708.80s: they're putting charts on twitter and
2710.64s: it's
2711.44s: it's sort of
2712.56s: exciting sounding to me and i i don't i
2715.20s: don't feel like i should be paying
2716.56s: attention to that stuff but a lot of
2718.40s: it's compelling and i'm not sure if
2719.84s: that's part of the trading process or
2721.60s: not and i said no
2722.88s: right 20 minutes a day 100 30 minutes
2725.28s: you're all done
2726.48s: go out and play golf go hit balls go
2728.40s: work out go yup make lunch go make
2731.92s: dinner go
2733.36s: uh i don't know read a book go watch a
2735.68s: movie
2737.36s: go
2738.08s: prune your yard yeah cut yeah your grass
2741.52s: yep
2742.32s: my million of other things you could do
2744.40s: the very first thing my mentor first
2746.00s: told me um about trading is you know
2748.56s: this isn't where you go for excitement
2750.08s: this isn't where you go for
2750.96s: entertainment he's you know if you can
2752.96s: keep it not exciting and just business
2755.36s: and it's productive it's good and go do
2757.60s: something else exactly yeah i i would
2759.84s: agree
2761.12s: so
2761.84s: i'm really curious for like a a more
2764.32s: practical slash current conversation
2766.96s: when
2767.76s: i think about you know most traders
2770.40s: especially in my audience a lot of them
2772.40s: are derivatives traders a lot of them
2773.84s: trade options um and things like that
2776.80s: but i'm really curious to understand a
2779.60s: little bit more about the way that you
2782.80s: like to approach you know hedging and
2785.52s: filling in those potholes and things
2787.20s: like that how do you go about actually
2790.56s: devising different ways to fill the
2793.28s: potholes or to smooth that line a little
2795.36s: bit i have obviously
2797.68s: my take on it but i imagine yours is
2800.48s: probably a lot more developed
2802.96s: yeah and it's getting more and more
2805.44s: complicated as i get older when i have a
2807.52s: little bit more
2808.88s: well and i have more capabilities uh you
2811.52s: know i'm consulting with a trading
2814.32s: platform that is hopefully going to be
2816.56s: out in 2022
2818.32s: uh more on that when it happens
2820.88s: but
2822.00s: the
2822.72s: as i get more automation in what i'm
2824.56s: doing either using spreadsheets or
2827.04s: some programming
2828.96s: what you end up with is ability to
2830.48s: expand your time horizons so let's say
2833.84s: you know for i'll just throw out some
2835.20s: numbers they don't mean anything
2836.96s: uh let's say i'm running a strategy of
2839.60s: 25 different futures markets and i'm
2841.60s: doing it on a
2843.68s: picket number 21 day
2846.24s: triple indicator
2848.48s: by cell engine it's just to coin an
2850.96s: example that's not what i do but i'm
2853.04s: just coining it to make it simple
2856.32s: i could then take the platform and say
2858.64s: well how about a 10 day or a 9 day or
2861.36s: something like that so now i've got a
2863.28s: shorter term one how about a 50 day
2865.84s: what does that look like
2867.52s: now the risks in a 50 day are going to
2869.28s: be very long so your position size is
2872.08s: going to be very small the nine-day
2874.56s: smaller risk size bigger positions but
2877.84s: you're going to get a lot more whip saws
2879.36s: you're going to get a lot more action
2881.60s: so but you're going to get different
2883.28s: return streams from each of those three
2885.68s: time periods
2887.36s: then you start adding markets and you
2890.08s: say instead of 25 markets how about if i
2892.32s: could go up to 50 markets
2894.56s: now you're all of a sudden trading iron
2897.12s: ore in singapore or
2899.60s: whatever you know lead in london or
2901.52s: something uh you know you've got
2903.28s: different markets that are going to have
2905.20s: different return streams
2907.04s: some of those
2908.64s: are going to be very different from what
2910.24s: you have now so they're going to help
2912.24s: fill the hole because they could be
2913.52s: making money when yours the ones that
2915.68s: you are currently trading are losing
2917.20s: money
2918.32s: then there's the whole gamut of
2921.28s: sort of geography there's
2923.60s: stock indices around the world you can
2925.36s: deal with
2926.48s: there's sovereign debt around the world
2928.56s: you can deal with
2930.32s: you can trade currencies around the
2932.08s: world 24 hours just about
2934.64s: uh so there's precious metals tended to
2938.00s: go most of the the time around the world
2940.16s: there's lots of energy markets
2942.56s: there's lots and lots of things that you
2944.48s: can do that
2946.00s: get you some exposures there
2948.16s: so then you have
2949.76s: different strategies so now you're
2951.76s: getting into let's say
2953.68s: a good example
2955.84s: i decide that i'm one of my strategies
2958.96s: is to trade on a nine-day basis the
2961.68s: nasdaq index
2963.76s: futures
2964.96s: long or short long short back and forth
2968.16s: that's all i do
2969.68s: it's been highly profitable there's
2971.68s: enough movement in it
2973.60s: that
2974.48s: it seems to
2975.92s: run far enough to where i can move my
2977.36s: stops up to the point where i break even
2979.36s: or better and then i if it hits it i
2982.00s: reverse go the other way all right so
2984.48s: now that is one return stream but it's
2986.48s: going to be driven by
2988.24s: the stock market's movement in one
2990.72s: direction or the other but what about
2993.12s: those years or months
2995.44s: where the stock market doesn't do
2996.84s: anything well then i sit there and say
2999.60s: well you know there's these things
3000.80s: called
3003.20s: index options over here
3005.20s: how about if i figure that we're going
3007.44s: into sideways actions and i get an
3009.44s: overbought condition
3011.52s: and sell a call spread
3015.04s: or i get an overblo sold position
3018.16s: the market's oversold and i sell a a put
3022.08s: spread
3023.44s: so i've got my i got a limited loss
3026.24s: locked in
3027.60s: i can't have a runaway infinite loss or
3029.84s: anything because i've got myself covered
3032.08s: i've got a limited return but it's going
3034.56s: to tend to make the return as the market
3037.28s: goes sideways and the time premium
3039.76s: disappears and the prices don't go
3042.08s: anywhere so that's going to coin a lot
3043.68s: of money during sideways action when my
3046.08s: trend falling is going to be sitting
3047.20s: there doing nothing
3048.56s: right
3049.44s: so that's an example of aren't they both
3051.84s: in the stock market sure but the way you
3054.56s: structure your strategies is so
3056.40s: different that one can be making money
3058.72s: while the other one's losing
3060.56s: right the same thing
3062.88s: amazingly right so uh that's kind of the
3066.00s: way i look at it i try to look at
3067.60s: strategies
3068.96s: when i look at that hole and i see that
3071.04s: the hole was caused
3072.72s: by a lot of sideways action that caught
3075.68s: my trend following models in whipsaws
3078.24s: then i say to myself
3080.16s: how about if i came up with a strategy
3082.40s: that actually tried to trade in sideways
3084.40s: markets and try to exploit that and you
3086.32s: end up with a whole different mindset
3087.92s: and
3088.80s: development development of the math and
3090.80s: the logic that you would use to try to
3092.56s: extract the profit out of that
3094.64s: got to start adding these pieces
3096.40s: together and i've got eight of them now
3098.24s: i've got so many different pieces and i
3100.24s: i'm on my way to more i probably will
3102.88s: have
3105.28s: who knows 12 to 20 over the next few
3108.08s: years if the platform gets up and
3109.76s: running and i have the capability of
3111.28s: leveraging my time even more i'll
3112.80s: probably invent a few more
3115.20s: so when you're going through this
3117.28s: automation process what what software
3120.00s: are you using to actually automate right
3122.08s: now
3123.28s: well that's one of the issues the
3124.80s: platform is not finished it's not ready
3126.48s: for time prime time yet i get access to
3129.36s: it as a
3130.48s: alpha tester you could call it i'm sort
3132.56s: of the
3133.84s: the alpha consultant trying to help
3137.28s: help them build it
3139.60s: and it's getting close i think within
3141.36s: the week i'm going to probably be
3142.80s: running simulations on it
3145.28s: so it's it's not forever off there but
3147.52s: i'm hoping it's pretty quick that we get
3149.36s: it out there to the public but it could
3151.20s: be a lot of fun for a lot of traders i
3152.80s: think but it's an easy to use platform
3154.88s: that allows me to then
3156.88s: get the data
3158.80s: add some track markets play with the
3161.20s: actual strategies and the math that i
3162.96s: want to use to buy and sell play with
3165.12s: the position sizing and run simulations
3168.00s: of historical data right see how it acts
3170.56s: now what i can do then
3172.56s: is i can design something that is going
3174.96s: to try to go after that hole that i saw
3177.44s: back there in
3179.28s: 2008 or whatever
3183.28s: if i then
3184.64s: run a new strategy
3186.64s: i've got to try to design it so that it
3189.04s: makes money in 2008
3191.44s: and doesn't cost me too much the rest of
3193.52s: the time when everything else was making
3195.28s: money because what i'm going to do is
3197.12s: probably pull some of the success of the
3199.04s: good strategies the rest of the time
3201.12s: down a little bit right
3203.20s: but i'm going to then improve the 2008
3205.44s: hole
3206.88s: smooth the line right
3208.88s: you know so that's what i'm going for
3210.96s: all the time and
3212.56s: um so that's the mentality i take on
3214.80s: i'll just try to i think through
3217.12s: okay the mark prices aren't really going
3219.12s: any place but they are you know noise
3221.68s: it's a noise band so in that type of
3224.24s: environment i'd kind of like to sell the
3226.32s: highs buy the lows and buy the lows and
3228.24s: sell the highs and
3229.60s: i know i'm going to be limited on my
3231.28s: amount of profits i can make on each run
3233.12s: so it's got to be a shorter term
3234.84s: probably and i'm starting to you know
3237.68s: check the items off and say okay this is
3239.84s: starting to sound like maybe
3241.68s: this type of math would work and i'll do
3243.92s: some testing and
3245.60s: and play with it a little bit see if i
3247.52s: can come up with something that with the
3248.80s: right markets and the right combination
3250.72s: of math that easy to run and simple and
3254.24s: understandable and strikes at the heart
3256.16s: of that hole that i'm trying to fill
3258.56s: then i'm
3259.68s: i'm good to go and turn it on now we
3261.60s: have number nine
3263.12s: got it then go look for number ten
3265.92s: so for those that are interested i know
3269.12s: definitely in my audience there there's
3271.12s: people that are really interested in you
3272.96s: know learning how to automate more
3274.40s: effectively i
3276.08s: i haven't ventured far into it myself
3278.08s: you know i i use primarily um
3281.28s: think or swim is the platform and a lot
3283.84s: of people do and there's a bit you can
3286.32s: do in there but it doesn't you know it
3288.24s: doesn't sound anything close to you know
3290.32s: what this new platform um would
3292.16s: potentially be able to do but yeah for
3294.16s: those for those that are maybe
3296.32s: interested in you know how they could
3298.96s: take next steps to automate more of what
3302.16s: they're doing what would you recommend
3304.16s: for them well the first thing i would do
3305.76s: is kind of what i did
3307.52s: you start with spreadsheets i mean
3309.04s: there's certain little functions that
3310.88s: you do every day as a trader
3312.96s: uh an example um
3316.40s: let's say you've got on your broker
3318.24s: platform think or swim or whatever
3320.48s: you've got a distance between where the
3322.88s: price is now and where your stop loss is
3324.88s: and the stop loss is you know line on
3326.96s: the page you can easily see it
3329.20s: and either in your head or by a
3331.20s: calculator you can say the risk for
3333.12s: trade is
3335.52s: 13.27
3338.24s: well you can set up a spreadsheet
3341.20s: it's sort of a macro where you can put
3342.88s: in 13.27
3344.96s: put in your equity and it could tell you
3346.32s: how many shares you should have right by
3348.80s: your position sizing algorithm so
3350.96s: there's things like that you can do so
3352.64s: without having to sit there and use a
3354.64s: calculator
3356.80s: you can use thinkorswim or some simple
3359.52s: little spreadsheets
3360.96s: you know there's lots of api i know uh
3363.60s: interactive brokers has spreadsheet
3366.56s: api capability so they can send you live
3369.52s: data yeah on you on your account and on
3371.92s: some pricing and you could create
3374.08s: algorithms within the spreadsheet so
3376.24s: that as this live data is coming in from
3378.24s: your trader workstation
3380.16s: it's actually helping to make decisions
3382.16s: and alerting you to hey you should be
3383.84s: buying this stock over here it's
3385.12s: breaking out right now
3386.88s: that type of thing so little things like
3389.36s: that
3390.56s: the way i did it my mentality when i
3393.12s: first started was simple i was so busy
3396.80s: being a chemical engineer running money
3399.28s: i was getting an mba i was custom
3401.76s: designing a house southwest of st louis
3404.88s: i was getting married
3407.60s: i felt like i had five full-time jobs
3410.16s: all at the same time
3412.32s: i uh
3413.60s: i ended up
3415.36s: saying to myself what i really need to
3417.12s: do is to put myself out of business from
3419.52s: the standpoint of trading i need to stop
3421.92s: working i need to have everything that i
3424.24s: do
3425.20s: is routine if it's something that i
3427.52s: could tell a computer to do and i can
3429.44s: get rid of it that gives me another five
3431.92s: or ten minutes a day i need that five or
3433.92s: ten minutes because i'm overwhelmed
3435.84s: right so i worked really really hard at
3438.00s: analyzing
3439.28s: every step that i went through every day
3441.76s: kind of wrote it down and i said what
3443.84s: out of here could i make go faster or be
3446.08s: more efficient i said aha right there
3448.48s: instead of me writing down all these
3450.88s: orders by hand and pencil
3453.28s: i could go ahead and try to get the
3455.68s: computer to write those down and have
3457.76s: them be nice and printed so you wouldn't
3459.44s: have to worry about my sloppy
3460.72s: handwriting
3461.92s: everybody could read it
3464.08s: all right now i gotta sit there and i
3465.60s: gotta fax it how about if i got these
3467.76s: things called fax cards and put it in my
3469.68s: computer and then have that dial up the
3472.24s: broker's modem and drop the fax straight
3474.40s: to him right from my computer so now i'm
3476.32s: generating the text file and i'm sending
3479.04s: it right from the computer
3480.72s: now hey that's starting to look
3482.64s: interesting now how what can i do
3484.88s: to
3485.76s: automate the actual decision making on
3488.00s: the buy and sell
3489.52s: well that's a little more hard because a
3491.36s: little more difficult because of the uh
3493.36s: the nature of what i was trading and how
3495.52s: i was trading it then but
3497.44s: you know if you take long enough you can
3498.96s: peck away at it and tell the computer
3500.88s: this is how i do what i do and now the
3503.20s: computer is generating your orders
3505.84s: position sizing
3507.44s: gotta know how much to buy and sell well
3510.16s: there's math involved with that too you
3511.76s: can put that into the computer so pretty
3514.08s: soon
3515.20s: you get down to the end of the day and
3516.64s: you're hitting one button and it incomes
3518.48s: the data and hitting another button it
3520.00s: runs it through your orders hit another
3521.60s: button it's transmitting to the broker
3523.84s: and you're done in five ten minutes and
3525.44s: you go on
3526.48s: you just liberated an hour or two of
3528.56s: your life every day right and that was
3530.88s: very valuable to me then and it's still
3533.12s: valuable to me now i i'd rather be out
3535.36s: playing golf than sitting in front of a
3536.80s: computer
3538.56s: fair enough i i don't know i am abysmal
3541.76s: at golf i like driving a golf cart
3543.28s: though but if the computer sounds better
3546.00s: to me than golf just because
3547.68s: i just like the sun i think the sun is
3550.08s: so much fun and and we get 330 sunny
3552.88s: days a year here so
3554.40s: i don't ever get tired of it and uh
3556.96s: it's to me it's just uh
3559.52s: i don't know i i feel retired i don't
3562.08s: feel as retired when i'm sitting in
3563.52s: front of a computer right yeah that
3566.16s: sounds right
3567.76s: um so i had one more question for you
3570.00s: sure um
3571.28s: had an interesting past couple years
3573.04s: with covet and everything uh this coming
3575.36s: year looks
3576.88s: equally interesting for a lot of reasons
3579.68s: um i'm just curious you know what do you
3581.44s: think about 2022 coming up like as a
3585.20s: macro whatever comes into the top your
3587.20s: mind about going into this training here
3589.76s: well
3591.36s: uh my wife always jokes that she hears
3593.44s: me say this so often and i'll say it one
3595.36s: more time
3596.48s: she repeats it now she's heard it so
3598.24s: many times
3600.40s: i always try to remind myself that the
3602.40s: market will do what the market will do
3604.72s: and if you keep you put that in a sign
3606.88s: and stick it on your wall
3608.96s: and remind yourself of the fact that you
3611.12s: got to be ready for everything and let's
3614.16s: not get ahead of ourselves and try to
3616.32s: pre-position
3618.24s: which way we're going to lean or what
3620.48s: you think is going to happen because
3622.00s: then you psychologically get shaded one
3624.40s: way and i like to stay dead neutral i
3627.52s: completely agnostic to the direction i
3629.68s: mean
3630.32s: i can see the stock markets it's been
3632.56s: having a good run here
3634.56s: um i mean today i think the nasdaq's hit
3637.12s: the skids a little bit but then they
3638.48s: were coming back i don't know whether
3640.16s: it's going to carry or not but
3642.88s: it's been doing pretty well through
3644.16s: december and it could easily continue on
3647.28s: there's no reason for it to necessarily
3649.28s: go down
3650.24s: on the other side of it there's lots of
3651.92s: reasons why it could go down
3653.84s: so
3655.44s: i got to be ready for both i'm ready for
3657.44s: both uh if the thing wants to fall apart
3659.92s: and go down 60 on the s p
3663.12s: fully prepared ready to go hedges will
3665.52s: be in place timing will get me out of a
3667.68s: lot of etfs momentum will go to zero and
3670.48s: i'll be
3671.76s: in cash hopefully my futures pick up
3674.00s: some stuff over on the bond side maybe
3676.16s: gold maybe currencies
3679.44s: you know things like lumber uh oil could
3682.08s: collapse in a recession type of an
3684.48s: environment
3685.84s: gas could crush down copper could fall
3691.68s: you know we could have inflation in the
3693.20s: meats and grains
3695.28s: you know there's lots of opportunities
3696.88s: out there
3697.76s: cotton
3699.60s: coffee cocoa
3701.84s: there's just lots of different return
3703.28s: streams and
3704.48s: so
3705.44s: whatever happens
3707.20s: i'm
3708.40s: i got everything i need in place to do
3710.56s: what i got to do and so my
3713.60s: i guess my
3714.72s: the one thing i think you could count on
3716.40s: probably in 2022 will be volatility yeah
3719.68s: so
3720.48s: uh
3721.76s: i'm kind of
3723.36s: since volatility helps feed my profits
3725.60s: i'm kind of looking forward to that but
3728.08s: uh because the more volatile the market
3730.00s: is the more profit you can make from it
3732.16s: uh of course the more risk you have to
3733.84s: manage but right i do
3735.92s: do a decent job i think of managing risk
3738.08s: and position sizing is a forte of mine i
3740.80s: wrote a book on the subject
3744.40s: so
3745.44s: i think that that's my my attitude
3747.52s: towards trying to predict 2022 i
3750.64s: almost am agnostic as to what's going to
3752.72s: go on as a traitor now as a citizen i
3755.52s: got a totally different opinion sure i i
3757.76s: really hate what the last year i thought
3759.60s: we've shot ourselves in the foot as a
3761.12s: country so many different ways i cannot
3763.04s: believe it
3764.16s: uh and it's happened so fast it's just
3766.48s: stunning
3767.60s: and how the
3770.08s: how anybody thinks what we're doing is
3772.16s: logical long-term is just beyond me
3775.28s: uh
3776.16s: but
3776.88s: hey i'm one guy one vote and uh we'll
3780.32s: see where it goes from here but uh
3782.80s: boy i think some things really got to
3784.72s: change or we're going downhill so fast
3786.72s: when it may not be any markets to trade
3789.12s: down the road that'll be a bad day
3791.76s: yeah
3792.72s: but uh yeah right now
3795.28s: i'm just watching them move around and
3797.92s: i'm sort of amazed they're up as much as
3800.24s: they are but hey i'm long like 75
3802.72s: percent of my sectors and i've got one
3804.96s: momentum etf on and
3808.24s: had a good day in futures today so it
3810.00s: was uh you know it's a good day and
3812.40s: i just try to have positive days every
3814.40s: day if i can
3815.76s: right and it sounds like you know just
3818.08s: the general disposition is seeing what
3820.40s: the market you know offers and then
3822.40s: taking advantage where you can yeah i
3824.48s: think traders have to i think there's an
3826.72s: old adage you
3828.48s: can't control the wind but you can
3830.16s: adjust the sales yeah and i think that
3832.40s: that's a real good analogy to the stock
3836.00s: to this to the markets in the trading of
3838.72s: markets in that i can't control whether
3841.44s: lumber prices go up or down i'm right
3844.16s: just a small fry retired guy
3847.36s: uh
3848.64s: and
3849.52s: but i can say all right let's see right
3851.52s: now the directions up
3853.92s: i'm long
3855.20s: so as it continues up
3858.00s: i had a real good day in lumber today
3861.20s: now
3862.08s: a week from now
3863.60s: or less even
3865.60s: it could turn around and start going the
3867.20s: other way gives me my signal to go short
3869.68s: i'm out of the long take the profit go
3871.68s: short and then starts plummeting
3874.40s: all right so i've adjusted my sales the
3876.96s: wind has definitely changed direction
3879.52s: and i just adjust the sales and i you
3881.60s: know continue to propel the vote don't
3883.68s: worry about
3884.88s: which way your job is to
3887.60s: is to let the market do what it wants to
3889.84s: do because that's what it'll do for
3891.84s: forever
3892.80s: and your job as a trader is to position
3894.96s: yourself so that you attack the risk and
3897.60s: exploit the profit right
3899.84s: yeah and you can only exploit what's
3901.92s: there
3902.80s: if there's no movement and the markets
3904.72s: go dead sideways for the whole year
3908.32s: you'll be lucky to even break even
3910.16s: because there's costs of trading there's
3911.68s: whipsaws there's all sorts of things
3914.24s: so you really need movement i actually
3916.00s: did a study that's at enjoy the
3917.60s: ride.world
3919.04s: on
3919.92s: movement in markets equals profits for
3922.08s: the commodity industry if there's no
3924.48s: movements and the volatility is very low
3926.72s: that month in the industry
3928.72s: then you'll see the cta
3930.64s: performance indexes will be lousy
3933.12s: negative whatever yeah hard to speculate
3935.28s: there's big volatility you'll see the
3937.44s: ctas do very well right
3940.08s: right
3940.80s: and
3941.60s: that actually leads me to kind of the
3944.96s: last part here is
3946.88s: um i did have the opportunity as i was
3949.04s: talking about before we started
3951.12s: recording to check out enjoy the
3952.72s: ride.world but i thought it'd be you
3955.12s: know cool just to talk about it for a
3956.80s: couple minutes here before we sign off
3958.64s: because
3959.68s: um like i was saying one of my favorite
3961.68s: things to do is to connect traders with
3964.00s: resources and there's a lot of really
3966.88s: good reading on there that i that i've
3968.88s: learned so
3970.24s: yeah yeah talk to me about it enjoy the
3972.56s: ride came out of a interesting
3975.12s: session by the pool in malaga spain
3978.56s: uh with rosado in our hands a nice
3981.28s: little chilled
3983.04s: spanish wine
3984.64s: my wife and i were just i don't know
3986.72s: talking about all sorts of things and i
3988.24s: said you know i wish there was one one
3989.92s: problem in my life i wish i could solve
3992.00s: i get i enjoy helping new traders coming
3994.96s: into the business and i feel like it's
3997.12s: my way of giving back to what's been a
3998.88s: very great success career for me
4001.60s: and uh but they asked me the same
4004.48s: questions over and over and over again
4007.52s: and i find myself typing
4009.84s: emails like thousands of emails i've
4012.48s: already done
4013.60s: and i must have answered you know any
4015.92s: one question a hundred times and it's
4018.64s: very inefficient
4020.72s: and it it's not getting
4022.56s: smaller it's getting worse more people
4024.64s: seem to know i mean i back then i had i
4026.96s: wasn't even on twitter hardly and now
4028.88s: i've got like 33 000 or 32 000 twitter
4031.76s: followers
4032.80s: so everybody's always asking me
4034.16s: questions and i'm trying to answer them
4035.92s: all yeah but um
4038.56s: so i started thinking
4040.08s: you know what we need is a way to
4041.44s: automate the way they could respond to
4043.36s: the emails
4045.12s: and uh she said well why don't you like
4048.16s: kind of do what
4049.52s: some of your friends do
4051.44s: actually run traitor
4053.68s: sort of mentoring or education programs
4056.00s: where you actually you know work with
4058.48s: them and
4059.84s: make them go to school you know run a
4061.60s: school basically for traders i said yeah
4064.16s: but then i'd be working again i'm
4065.76s: retired i don't want to work going
4067.36s: backwards here i'm going backwards it's
4069.76s: not right so then i explain the
4071.76s: difference between synchronous and
4073.36s: asynchronous what we're doing right now
4075.60s: is synchronous because we're both on the
4077.28s: zoom call together
4078.96s: but asynchronous means you send me an
4080.96s: email and i'm on the golf course when i
4082.88s: get back from the golf course i answer
4084.48s: your email i don't have to be around
4086.40s: when you actually uh said something and
4090.64s: so that's why i always liked the email
4092.80s: approach but
4094.56s: we started evolving into
4096.88s: well how about if you had a collection
4099.20s: that people could get to they said like
4101.04s: a website ah there's the answer and uh
4104.96s: we thought oh we could call it like how
4107.68s: about enjoytheride.com
4110.08s: and it turns out it was taken
4112.16s: of course so i said well how about enjoy
4114.88s: the ride.world because i have people
4116.48s: sending me emails from all around the
4118.16s: world asking me trading questions from
4119.92s: india and china and
4121.76s: taiwan and japan and i sometimes i have
4124.56s: to use google translate to even
4126.32s: understand what they're asking
4128.08s: and google translate to answer them by
4130.08s: the way too because i hope it translates
4132.80s: well because i have no idea what it says
4134.48s: when it's translated
4136.24s: and uh so all of a sudden enjoy the
4138.80s: ride.world got born about
4142.08s: i guess it was about three and a half
4143.36s: years ago or something four years ago
4146.16s: and what what i did is it took about
4148.32s: nine months to a year of learning
4150.72s: um how to create a website it was
4153.04s: fascinating to me i never knew how to do
4155.04s: that and i learned a lot
4156.88s: and uh
4158.08s: got everything all lined up and then i
4159.76s: just started going out into the web and
4162.88s: i was astonished to put my name into a
4165.28s: web search and then look at how many
4167.44s: citations and things that are out there
4169.36s: from
4170.56s: my earlier career that are still there
4173.04s: and so i just collected all the research
4175.12s: papers that i'd ever written started
4177.12s: collecting the interviews from people
4178.80s: that i either had copies of or had
4181.52s: access to or links to
4184.48s: further interviews like this one
4186.40s: hopefully we'll put on the website so
4189.44s: future visitors to the website will see
4191.36s: you and i talking
4192.96s: uh you and me talking and um
4196.88s: so that's kind of evolved and then the
4198.80s: people were asking me what kind of books
4200.24s: do you recommend well i'll do a
4202.00s: recommended reading page and i'll put it
4203.44s: in the order of how i recommend them
4205.76s: and then how about uh
4207.84s: do you ever do webinars i mean do you
4209.68s: ever
4210.72s: do that type of stuff well yeah if my
4212.32s: wife and i feel in the mood we we set up
4214.80s: a webinar and we talk about a topic and
4216.72s: she produces it and i
4218.40s: i do all the presentation and answer the
4220.72s: questions she asks the questions and
4222.80s: people live are asking me questions
4225.36s: and those are fun and then i record them
4227.36s: and put them on there and people can
4228.64s: watch them in the future did a video
4230.64s: series on how to create a trading
4232.16s: strategy for yourself
4234.08s: um
4235.44s: every now and again lawrence and i will
4237.04s: do a seminar if
4239.04s: if governments around the world will
4241.12s: allow their people to travel to
4243.44s: different places yeah it's been hard to
4245.76s: do a seminar lately because you can't
4247.60s: get anybody to come to it because they
4249.68s: can't
4250.48s: get here yep
4251.68s: lauren's had a three-week process to go
4254.24s: through to get
4255.36s: get to the last seminar it was very
4257.36s: expensive and very involved involved two
4259.44s: different tests he's fully vaccinated
4262.32s: he's never had it
4264.32s: and yet three weeks to get here
4267.28s: it was crazy
4268.88s: i drove down from my
4271.04s: my place here that i'm talking right now
4273.20s: down to the phoenician so it was me for
4275.04s: me it was like a 20-minute trip right in
4277.44s: my car
4278.88s: but that's essentially that's what
4280.64s: happened i put my hedging page up there
4282.64s: i put
4283.91s: [Music]
4285.28s: trying to remember what else i have
4286.64s: there there's a whole bunch of different
4288.48s: types of things on enjoy the ride.world
4290.56s: that allow
4291.52s: a trader to just come in and
4294.08s: you know if he wants to just listen to
4295.44s: an interview listen to this interview
4298.08s: hear what questions you're asking you
4299.84s: might he might pick up one gem of
4302.16s: wisdom there along the way and then
4305.04s: watch another one pick up something else
4307.52s: and hopefully it crystallizes some
4308.96s: people's thinking and gets them head
4310.56s: started a little bit down the path
4312.32s: because when i started out i had to
4314.24s: invent all this stuff myself there was
4315.92s: no
4316.72s: there was no internet yep to speak of
4319.52s: there was no mentoring programs there
4321.92s: was
4323.04s: there was physical copies of books and i
4324.96s: read a lot of books on trading and
4326.64s: mental side of trading
4328.40s: trading psychology if you will
4330.88s: but the resources out there now at
4333.04s: places like enjoy the ride.world are so
4335.20s: extensive that you could just
4338.00s: research for six months or a year before
4340.24s: you ever get started and it would be
4342.08s: well along the process
4344.16s: yeah to where where you need to be
4346.64s: that's awesome well
4348.24s: i'm sure a lot of people are really
4349.60s: thankful you know that you've taken the
4351.12s: time to put that together i definitely
4352.64s: enjoyed poking through it myself i'll
4354.24s: make sure to uh link to the website also
4357.44s: in the uh video description when i put
4359.44s: this up
4360.88s: i will
4361.92s: do the same the other way with this
4363.68s: interview awesome perfect that'll be fun
4365.76s: one more interview the interview page is
4367.28s: getting very very long good you could
4369.20s: you could probably spend 40 50 hours
4371.76s: listening to me talk to different people
4373.76s: it's good
4374.80s: if you had the time that's good i i
4377.12s: think people like you with the amount of
4379.04s: experience you have you know the fact
4381.12s: that you take the time to share it with
4382.56s: people yeah um is is really impactful
4386.08s: um last question i have for you is i
4388.72s: know you're on twitter um so you know if
4391.84s: somebody wants to look you up see what
4394.00s: you talk about on there it looks like
4395.84s: it's
4396.64s: at
4397.68s: underscore tom i'll also link to that
4400.40s: and i'm the i'm the same exact thing on
4402.40s: gitter
4404.24s: g-e-t-t-r
4406.80s: and i'm enjoy the ride.world on my page
4410.24s: on facebook
4411.60s: okay
4412.48s: and uh
4413.77s: [Music]
4415.44s: let's see i think i'm enjoying the ride
4417.12s: dot world on parlor and me we
4420.72s: can do a search on my name on me we
4423.68s: so i'm on
4425.12s: linkedin
4426.72s: tombaso
4429.76s: so i'm on linkedin as well so there's
4432.00s: lots of places i have an instagram
4434.32s: account but i've never quite figured out
4436.56s: i mean it's kind of like they want to
4437.84s: have a picture there to do something and
4440.32s: i
4441.44s: i work with computers and messages and
4444.00s: economic data and all that
4446.72s: instagram doesn't fit what i do that
4448.72s: much it's not like i'm trying to sell my
4450.72s: uh my golf shirts right i wear my etr
4454.24s: golf shirts but nobody else does
4456.32s: it's funny you say that just because a
4458.00s: lot of people you know especially for
4459.68s: like youtube and stuff like that it's
4461.12s: helpful to be on on instagram but um i
4464.48s: hate it so it is not funny i
4468.16s: my most hated social media is twitter i
4471.68s: can't stand twitter
4473.52s: it
4474.32s: i think i must be
4476.00s: i don't know
4477.60s: what's the term
4478.96s: is it you
4480.00s: there's a term for it loquacious is that
4483.04s: a
4483.92s: proper term
4485.04s: i use a lot of words i talk too much or
4488.56s: whatever but 288 characters i see it's
4491.20s: not sufficient for me to get across my
4493.36s: point
4494.40s: and uh but you know i get her same setup
4497.36s: it's 777 characters
4500.00s: got it so it looks the same but i got
4502.88s: 777 characters you just have to do the
4505.76s: you just have to do the comment thing
4507.28s: you know where they have the first title
4509.20s: and then they start writing their own
4510.72s: well and you see these things they're
4512.32s: broken into five pieces it's yep it's a
4515.04s: thousand characters broken into five
4517.28s: different posts and oh gosh i
4520.32s: come on and then it's actually on and on
4522.64s: twitter the other thing i don't like
4523.84s: about twitter i have my picture up there
4526.48s: on my profile right and i've got
4529.04s: it's the same picture everybody sees i
4531.20s: think it's got this screen behind me uh
4533.44s: on it
4534.80s: i've had seven imposters and all of them
4539.04s: use that same picture now tell me
4541.28s: twitter can't lock down that photo
4543.84s: somehow
4545.52s: or make it
4546.88s: you know
4548.80s: i run into all sorts of other
4551.60s: images that you can't even do a control
4553.60s: screen
4554.56s: on you can't capture your screen because
4556.80s: it'll block it it just depends on
4558.88s: security you can't tell me twitter can't
4560.56s: come up with a way to get rid of
4562.64s: imposters you just gotta get them to
4565.04s: verify your account get that blue check
4567.04s: mark and then everything
4568.64s: tried twice they turned me down both
4570.56s: times apparently i'm not enough of a
4572.88s: public figure or personality you're an
4575.20s: impossible sports figure or whatever
4578.08s: else i suppose i'm not an actor
4580.72s: um so no no blue check for me hmm
