0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: you
120.00s: No, we're going to talk about
122.00s: the
123.00s: ,
125.00s: but
127.00s: a
129.00s: it's
131.00s: what's up
133.00s: outliers happy Monday pretty interesting day out there with a few very key pieces of news that we are going to talk about today one of them is on the screen right now actually
139.00s: didn't have a chance to start looking through this yet so
144.00s: the recent announcements regarding Tesla's Robotaxi. And then the other big piece of news
152.24s: stems from the Iran Israel slash US conflict. And this actually is led to some of the more
163.92s: profound recent changes that we've seen in oil prices, which has been massively tradable.
173.28s: The oil futures right now are showing down 4.5 percent. Gold is down a point in a quarter,
181.60s: Bitcoin up 2% VIX down 2.9% NASDAQ, Russell and E-minis all are up right now, which is
194.96s: actually also kind of interesting because they're being led by the Russell. And the Russell's been
202.32s: the week one of the group by far. Now let's start with kind of the the easy one I suppose,
209.28s: which is the the ceasefire. This looks like one of those instances where the market had this
217.52s: completely correct, literally completely correct. I made a post about it earlier that I thought was
224.88s: genuinely entertaining. I made a post. I think it was on X. Let me see when it was because the
232.88s: yeah, it was seven hours ago. So this is when I ran Walter Bloomberg posted that I ran launched
242.96s: attacks targeting Qatar and Iraq. And the markets literally were up. And I actually found that to be
252.32s: extremely telling, extremely telling the fact that the markets were rallying despite that going
259.44s: on to me told me that the the market itself really was not that concerned with what this conflict
267.04s: is where it was at. And then obviously an expectation of some sort of less impactful
274.48s: resolution. This is one of those cases where the market it can be really good as a guiding feature
283.12s: honestly to analyze information that's coming out because at face value, seeing that original tweet
290.32s: from Bloomberg, I'm sitting there thinking like, okay, yeah, this is obviously going the wrong way.
294.32s: This is escalating. However, the market is pretty detailed and it's good at pricing things.
303.36s: Stop that. So because of that, the market led me to reassess the initial reaction that I had.
312.88s: And sure enough, the market seemed to have some pretty good ideas. So let's see what the
319.28s: latest is. This is from AP and Dubai. It says Trump announced Israel and I ran a grid to a complete
326.48s: and total ceasefire soon after Iran launched a limited missile attack on a US military base
332.72s: and Qatar retaliating for the bombing of the nuclear sites. So the reason why this is interesting
344.56s: is because the way this whole thing went down, it shows how much just showmanship is going on.
353.28s: The US makes this attack with beetles, bombs a few spots. And then the US first postures and says
367.20s: any sort of attack against US interests will be, it'll just lead to pretty significant escalation.
375.76s: And that leaves Iran with essentially no way out. There's no real way out of that.
385.68s: Because if Iran doesn't do anything and they just get punched in the lip and they don't do anything,
390.40s: that absolutely devastates their sovereignty after somebody bombs them on their soil. So then
397.84s: the fact that they opened that up and essentially said, if you attack back, this is going to lead
405.68s: to an escalation. But then the US obviously had a backdoor conversation with Iran because I ran
413.12s: communicated to the US that they were going to attack some of these spots which led to us leaving
420.24s: those spots and then the attack unfolding with preemptive warning. So that clearly is just all
427.68s: showmanship that's Iran essentially saying like, listen, we got to do something here otherwise we
432.32s: look exceedingly weak. So let's agree for what we can do here. And that's essentially clearly what
439.60s: happened. So I think this broadly circles back to what makes the most sense, which is some sort of
448.88s: broad scale conflict over here that it just doesn't help anybody or anything. And I think the
454.96s: reason why the US got involved is to show Iran that they're going to have to do something because
459.52s: Iran was obviously very comfortable continuing the conflict with Israel. And Israel was happy to
466.24s: play the game as well. So by the US entering the conversation, player three enters the game,
472.64s: the dynamic changes a little bit. And now we are seemingly at a ceasefire. So the market
480.88s: effect here is pretty interesting. If we take a look at just the broad market effect, we got to go
488.64s: to the futures here specifically. And if you take a look at crude, crude has had one of the most
497.04s: insane moves that I've seen in crude oil for some time now. So zooming in on this, you can see that
505.68s: we rally from 60. We get up to the mid 70s. We almost crack 80. And then we now have one of the
516.00s: largest intraday than follow on two day selloffs that effectively that we've seen in recent
524.08s: history with crude massive move. This also comes from a very clear priority of Trump who does not want
536.08s: expensive oil. He's made that super, super clear. And this is some level of partial alignment there.
545.52s: So what's the tradable output here? I see a few things. One of them is it does seem like this is
553.84s: going to be a weight off the market shoulders. You can see that things are rallying right now. I
559.52s: actually have some long Russell futures on just playing this after hours move. And we'll see how it
568.72s: actually ends up how it actually ends up panning out. But right now the Russell is leading the pack.
579.04s: And that is an important data point because it shows a broader underlying shift. Because if you
587.84s: take a look at the Russell, the Russell's been the under performer for some time now. Nasdaq is within
593.36s: striking distance of all time highs. E-minis are within striking distance of all time highs.
598.72s: Nasdaq is still a ways off even from the 2300 handle with it trading around 2166. So this clearly
607.44s: has a lot of ground to cover. Valtility is rejecting. I did not get my short vault trade on because we
615.36s: did not get enough overextension to the upside for me to be able to do anything, which is unfortunate.
619.92s: Because that is a standard go to idea for me, but alas other plans in place here there wasn't
627.68s: really anything that that looked too too good to me. Now one quick admin note for those that are
634.80s: watching this live, we found a way to essentially be able to let people dial in to the stream.
641.68s: So if you're in the discord and you want an opportunity to dial in, I'll have time a little
648.08s: bit later for open Q&A, but all you need to do is go into the chat room, the voice chat room in
655.76s: the discord, which it's free for everybody. You can go into the chat room and then effectively
662.08s: I can join and then stream the conversation from there. So it comes through here. So there's a
669.60s: way for us to do kind of like live Q&A and conversation, which I want to start integrating into these.
676.56s: So this first one, it'll be obviously working out the details, but if you are interested in doing
684.24s: that, you can let me know in the chat. So then I'll monitor the chat room in the discord, but again,
690.40s: we'll have time for kind of like the Q&A segment, like maybe 15 minutes. I just want to get through
694.32s: the rest of the trade up material. Hey, yo, what's up? Lauren TCM King says, how do you, I don't
700.96s: usually watch live. You catch them later at 2x. Yeah, that's kind of the standard, I actually think
706.16s: for a lot of people because most of the live streams funny enough, they get most of their views
711.12s: in the recording side of stuff. Which leads me to believe sometimes I think I might try another
720.80s: pilot soon where I literally just do more videos instead of the live streams. I like the live
728.16s: streams because I actually just enjoy hanging out with you guys. It's more fun than creating videos,
733.68s: but unfortunately live streams don't do a lot for the channel in terms of growth.
738.64s: The YouTube algorithm doesn't really promote live streams, which makes a lot of sense.
743.92s: All right. So let's take a look and dive into our next key piece, which is what are the
756.24s: tradable effects here? First tradable effect, I think we noted is the Russell. Okay. Next tradable
763.20s: effect is still the continued move in crude. I don't think crude is fully done. I'm short futures.
771.36s: I think that there's still probably downside, which is likely to be like the 60s low 60 handle.
782.56s: And that's about where I'm expecting it to be. So I have a short that I'm running in there right
790.00s: now that I'll continue to let that go. But I think short oil is another another spot.
799.60s: A couple others, I think gold is reeling back a little bit right now. I think this largely comes
807.20s: from the risk on risk off relationship, because if we take a look at ETF flows for the day,
814.24s: which I haven't looked at yet, but my guess is that we will probably see capital inflows.
821.28s: That would be my guess. Capital inflows, essentially across the entire board.
828.48s: So yeah, about as expected. So what that tells me is just there will be some money that's
836.96s: positioning more risk on. And that's kind of the cool part. Again, one of the things that people,
841.76s: I've heard a few people say is like, oh man, like they're so tired of like the news cycle.
846.00s: It's too much. They can't keep up. But the reality is there's actually some significant benefits
851.28s: to the way that the news cycle is with Trump, the administration and in general,
856.64s: is that it forces stuff all over the place. So the whole game of like deep insider information
862.64s: will always be at play. But this kind of flow of information does level the playing field to a degree.
869.76s: Because it I've said this before, it just becomes an equal game of like nobody knows.
875.28s: So the fact that this morning I ran was shooting missiles and that this afternoon slash evening,
883.12s: depending on if you're East Coast time, that there's now a piece of agreement, right? It's kind of
891.84s: kind of crazy. Normally, there would at least be a couple more days in between those I would imagine.
897.60s: So this also means that I think the broad market attention shifts a lot. I think the market will
907.20s: start to shift its attention more so to the Fed picture. And then we're coming up on another
914.48s: earning cycle, which starts in a couple weeks. So that'll likely be the more dominant direction
920.48s: that we see things now starting to focus. Okay. So now let's take a quick look at the robot taxi.
928.80s: Kill these. The robot taxi is really, really interesting. It's one of those things where it's fun
939.12s: to see the kinds of ideas that Tesla dreams up and what this could look like. It's obviously still
948.64s: very much in its infancy, just like autonomous driving. The reality is autonomous driving is still
953.68s: a long ways off. Even though out here in California, you'll see a bunch of Tesla's that are on the
959.60s: highway doing a great job managing that. And I do think it's the technology is developing rapidly.
970.08s: But with how unscripted so much of this is, meaning day to day driving, it is
978.40s: something to pay attention to. A great example of this. I had a buddy out visiting and we were driving
986.72s: the new Tesla performance model, whatever that one is. I don't remember. And I was tinkering with it
993.44s: because you know, as I'm a gear head, I like cars, I build cars, I drive cars, I have a car club,
997.92s: like like cars. And I was driving it and it was the automated driving is just very impressive what
1006.24s: it can do. However, the thing tried to fucking kill me and three other people in the car because
1013.92s: it had, it didn't do a good job analyzing actually a other bad driver. So what ended up happening is
1023.44s: we were coming on the on ramp. The extra lane to the right was gone because of construction. It
1031.92s: had like one of those cement barriers. So we're getting ready to come on the highway at a pretty good
1037.92s: rate of speed. And then there's somebody in front in that lane that we were emerging into.
1046.48s: And then there was somebody directly speeding up along the merge lane that we should be getting
1052.72s: over. And the car literally had us accelerating into this trifecta where there was a car in front of
1061.68s: the guardrail to the right and then a car that was speeding up to the left. So I don't know if
1067.68s: slash when the Tesla was going to correct. I was monitoring pretty closely. So I gave it as much
1076.08s: time as I felt comfortable before intervening. And I ended up having to get on the brakes like
1082.00s: pretty damn hard because I waited a while to see if it would intervene and it hadn't at that point.
1087.60s: So who knows Tesla the car itself might have had a very last second intervention come on the
1093.84s: brakes even harder than I did. But all of the passengers got pretty jostled because I was explaining
1099.52s: to them what I was doing. And they got pretty jostled when I made the correction myself.
1106.32s: So all of that's to say one single anecdote. We drove that car most of the time that it was here
1114.24s: and most of the time was fantastic. But that's the problem. That's the issue that's automated driving
1122.40s: faces. It's not the fact that it's going to get it right 95% of the time. It's that it's going to
1131.04s: be judged on the 5% it gets wrong. And that's a difficult threshold to get over as a company.
1139.84s: That's not easy. So I think the technology itself is fascinating. It's well developing. But
1149.92s: yeah, it's likely going to take a little bit of time to come through. So first I'm literally
1156.88s: just going to click through anything that I see different here. And then I want to just see
1163.76s: what the news cycles are. Like this stuff is cool because here's the other thing to keep it
1171.20s: keep it G. If you use Uber or Lyft, that shit real like it genuinely is a roll of the die.
1183.92s: It is literally a genuine roll of the die who you get. I've had some really awesome drivers.
1190.40s: I probably have had equal number of not good drivers. And I don't pick the cheap option
1196.24s: when I use them. I'm typically picking one of the more expensive choices. So that's just to
1201.68s: de-conflict sometimes people when I will tell them that kind of thing they'll say like,
1205.28s: oh, that's just because you know, you're doing like the economic one. And it's not the case. I'm
1209.52s: typically not. The point I'm making here is that I imagine the standard ride quality is going to go
1217.44s: massively across the board. Because if you can successfully automate this, that does make a big
1223.76s: difference. I would use the service. Now I would use the service once it's fully stabilized.
1230.16s: Because right now there's no way that I would feel comfortable getting in the back of
1237.20s: automated driving vehicle. Unless like if I was going to short distance and sure who cares.
1241.92s: But I'm thinking stuff like going from my house to like the airport where you're spending
1245.36s: in a decent amount of time on the five in California, which for those that don't know,
1250.24s: it's a fast highway. It's not like the northeast style highways where the speed limits like 55
1255.60s: and people speed at like 65 or 70. It's literally like the flow of traffic typically is 85.
1263.20s: And like that's not even being dramatic. It's literally like 85. So the issue with that is that
1270.24s: the margin for error goes down pretty significantly. And the repercussions for a mistake go up
1278.64s: significantly. So I think that's going to be one of the bigger issues that they face is like if I
1283.20s: were to use this kind of service, it would only be in like short little local stuff out of curiosity.
1290.32s: And there would have to be some sort of eject button, which I don't know if there's a thing.
1294.88s: That's actually what I want to see right now. Like this. No, that's how to I want to know if
1301.12s: there's a way to like. Yeah, this in an emergency tap pullover vehicles touch screen your vehicle will
1308.96s: stop at the nearest safest location. Yeah. So that will be something I would be very interested to
1317.84s: see how well that that actually works. But let's see. So this is from and gadget. It says the first
1324.24s: robot taxi rides are running into a few bumps. Tesla launches robot taxi service over the weekend.
1330.40s: Only a small number of cars heavy human supervision on and off the road exactly as you would expect.
1336.24s: While less impressive than previously promised, the company's caution ultimately seems for the best.
1340.88s: I don't know why that would be unimpressive. Like that makes total sense to me. At least one robot taxi
1347.20s: attempted to drive on the wrong side of the road based on a video posted to X and spotted by Bloomberg.
1352.40s: The ride video shared by Rob Mar is largely on eventful. Tesla Navigating Turns Merge's view issues
1358.48s: except for around seven minutes or so on to the ride. This is the this is the the issue that they have
1368.80s: is again, it's going to be these small little hurdles like this that make it more difficult
1378.00s: for this to work. Now zooming out though, there's a really, really interesting opportunity
1385.60s: where if we look at what this means for companies like Uber and companies like Lyft,
1393.68s: they're effectively on notice and Uber itself is really not in a super great position right now.
1402.88s: And they're going to need to pivot really quickly in order to be able to make this broader
1409.68s: this broader thing work, which I haven't seen much of the news around Uber and how they're
1417.84s: attempting to deal with the rise of the robot taxi because their model really isn't built
1424.80s: for adaptation or taking up the robot taxi business model. So I don't see them as an
1431.60s: operator for it. They could be or they could be consumed, but even that the main benefit to a
1440.40s: company like Uber is that they get to offload a lot of cost and risk because you're essentially
1447.28s: using contractors. You have people that are operating their personal vehicles and that decreases
1453.12s: a ton of the logistical burden on the company, which makes it a really slick idea. And I don't
1459.44s: see that fully going away. Now, the other thing to keep in mind is I don't actually think that
1466.24s: there's going to be some sort of at least several year removal of these kinds of companies because
1474.24s: when I fly relatively frequently and if I'm going to a normal airport, I almost always see
1482.88s: a row of regular cabs still there. So the fact that there's still even regular cabs
1488.80s: is kind of crazy. So I don't see the robot taxi taking too much away from Uber, at least in the
1498.40s: very near term, although they do have they do have some big strategic decisions that they're going
1506.00s: to have to navigate, which I don't imagine are going to be super easy for them. So Josh says,
1512.88s: have taken a regular cab when Uber wait times were too long. Yeah, which is really interesting.
1519.52s: Like the fact that there's still a market for that kind of thing because normally speaking,
1528.56s: I always preemptively time it because I know that they wait five minutes. So I will order them
1534.80s: early Uber or lift, I'll order them early and have them have them wait. I'd rather them wait
1542.88s: for me for three minutes than me wait for them for three minutes. I'm going to value my time over
1548.48s: their time and that's one of the benefits of the service. But I completely agree, Josh, that
1557.60s: there's definitely an opportunity for like a still a viable use case for a cab because here's
1566.72s: one of the other things. I had this a while ago where I scheduled this is when I was consulting
1572.88s: with Deloitte and I used to fly pretty much every week. And when I would sometimes have to leave
1579.76s: really early on a Monday. So I'm having to leave the house at like five. And I'll schedule the
1587.04s: lift ahead of time. But then the lift driver the next morning will be like, ma'am, fuck that,
1591.60s: I don't feel like getting up anymore. Maybe they go out, have too much a drink. Well, the problem
1596.24s: is is my ride wasn't available. And then there's no other providers in the region. One of the things
1601.28s: that cabs do well is like they're reliable if you scheduled them ahead of time. For that
1608.72s: realistically, you're better off just using a driving service. But that's a whole other thing.
1612.32s: When I was working at Deloitte, you can't expense a driving service. So I still think Tesla here,
1618.96s: you can see that it really enjoyed that news. And I still have the ratio called diagonal
1626.16s: on in Tesla, where my base position is out in 15 Jan 27. So I got tons and tons of time on these.
1635.52s: I am short, the 18 July 375s on the call side. So those are still okay. No real
1646.16s: action needed on those just yet. At least as far as I can see. So those still look pretty good to me.
1657.20s: Now, Admin, no. I'm going to take a look through a few more things. But if you want to dial into
1664.16s: the stream, you can hop into the chat room and just ping me in the discord and then I'll pop over
1670.08s: and then I'll be able to put you on. So that's you can literally talk live if there's a question
1676.72s: or something that you want to take a look at. Just let me know. And you will be on the stream.
1683.84s: Just like dialing into show, which is pretty cool.
1687.04s: Zach says, what are your strikes for 27 on the calls, the long calls I'm at the 420s?
1695.04s: So let's take a look at where those are at.
1700.96s: The 420s are a 59 delta. So I got those when they were a bit lower.
1714.24s: And the 18 July.
1724.88s: The 375s. So these are underwater a little bit. I sold them originally for 1095. And it's a 1 to 2.
1735.20s: 1 to 2 ratio. So essentially, I have 50% of the position covered. It's really just because Tesla's
1740.80s: been an absolute crap. So yeah, that's this position, which looks pretty good. The
1750.16s: Palantir ratio called diagonal is looking good. I am getting to a point, though, where I likely will
1758.48s: need to adjust it ever so slightly. Oops, didn't mean to click that. Let me get that out of the way.
1764.08s: That's like just all those off. I will likely need to adjust it ever so slightly because of the
1772.00s: short call component is not where we need it. So I have two different tranches out of short calls.
1783.60s: I have the 140s and the 155s. The 140s are in 18 July.
1793.92s: And those were out for 638. So I'm probably going to have to roll those realistically speaking.
1805.20s: And yeah, the 140s, but the problem is that they still have so much extra intrinsic value.
1816.72s: And they're only at a 56 delta. So it might not.
1819.92s: Stax says, are you back on discord for the Patreon members? Sorry for the loop. Sorry, I don't
1825.84s: follow. I don't follow the question. Sorry, let me know what you mean. Are you back on the discord?
1835.28s: Let's take a look at a couple broad market scans. Because that's what I would be doing right now.
1843.68s: Anyways, we're not going to go super deep in a detail. We'll do a little bit more of that tomorrow
1848.72s: on the pro stream. That's really where I spend most of my time actually trying to configure individual
1853.92s: trades. I'm mostly going to use this as an opportunity to create short lists for stuff that's
1859.44s: likely worth following up on. So what I'm going to do now is start with just a few basic scans.
1867.92s: The first one I'm looking at things that are up the most over the last year. This helps me with
1875.12s: like momentum and stuff like that. So TSSI is primary leader. And they're up 1,261% over the last
1888.80s: year. So these guys are, I mean, absolutely crushing it. Insane. And let's take a look at the
1901.52s: options here. Lauren says, didn't you shut the discord down for a bit because of the bots?
1913.84s: Oh, that's what you mean. Start it. Now I understand stacks. And thank you for Lauren for helping
1918.08s: me understand. Yes. So the flow is different though. The way that people get into the discord is
1925.52s: through the free side of the Patreon. It essentially allows us to conduct a slightly better review
1932.32s: and have a tighter onboarding process. So it's for free, everybody to get into the Patreon community.
1939.76s: That was, it just adds an additional step to make it more difficult for the bots to get in because
1945.92s: it's not even bots really. It's spammers. They're live people that we're trying to scam people,
1950.80s: which is super annoying. So Lauren, you're exactly correct. So far, it's been better. We'll obviously
1957.92s: keep an eye on it because if it gets bad again, then we'll have to turn it off. But so far, it's been
1963.84s: okay. Thankfully. So yeah, thank you for the, thank you for the heads up.
1968.16s: I want to take a look at TSSI specifically here.
1986.88s: And I just want to get a sense of if there's still like this really broad positive side positioning.
1993.84s: Yeah, so this looks like profit taking. Let's see.
2010.32s: So Nets here. Yeah, it looks mostly like profit taking, which
2018.64s: with stuff that rallies this hard, you kind of, you have to expect to see it. I mean, this is just a
2030.88s: wild move. But this still looks interesting to the upside. So we'll set an alert.
2039.04s: And we'll keep an eyeball here. If there's anything that you guys would like to take a look at,
2051.92s: let me know. The other thing that I do want to throw out for specifically those that attend the
2060.40s: Friday sessions, the beginner, really, the options trading basics, it's coming up on time to like
2067.36s: actually reconfigure the series for the next mini series. And I'm not sure what I want to focus
2075.20s: on for it. So if you attend those beginner, the beginner streams on Friday, if there are specific
2083.76s: elements of options trading that you want to focus on, please let me know either in the discord
2091.76s: in the chat here, wherever, because that will give me ideas on what we should do for the next mini
2098.64s: series, because I don't really want to do like a reboot of the actual 101 yet, going back to like
2106.80s: the very basics. I just don't feel like doing that. So I want to like focus in either on a key sub
2114.00s: component and do like a four or six episode mini series on it. So pretty open, pretty open to ideas
2124.24s: depending on what you might want to look at. Okay, so back to this. Let's take a look at. So again,
2131.12s: this is just looking at stuff that's up big over the last year. This I have a position in,
2139.60s: but need some updates. Let's see what these options look like. Yeah, so still pretty good call skew,
2150.96s: really, really light options chain. And this is looking at S E Z L. I have changed this fucking boom
2164.56s: arm thing. Need to get like one that just sits on the desk. Let's take a look at the options.
2180.80s: So the options chain is actually quieting down a lot.
2184.72s: Let's take a look at the net premiums. So still super heavy on the call side though.
2198.16s: Wow, and a bunch of it's right on the front in it. ET July, look at that 928k again 71 439 and 436.
2207.84s: So this is very much in the front end. Interesting.
2218.24s: So this gets earmarked. I'm going to add this to my actual watch list.
2224.88s: This will be 23 June. And then I actually want to run through the prior names on the watch list as
2231.28s: well for those that don't know. I'll show you what I what I have.
2240.40s: So what I do is based on the stuff that we talk about. I'll track like a small list of things like
2252.08s: this here. And this is really for us to be able to go back and see like based on what we looked at
2257.44s: and what we talked about. How did things end up moving and reconciling again,
2263.12s: like what the broader expectation was. So I like to go back through these. I'm going to save
2269.20s: this for a little bit later. I just want to finish going through some of these scans. But then we'll
2274.24s: we'll take a look. So let's take a look at SZL. And let's take a look at their premium all side
2282.32s: 464, 52, 59. And then it flips to put side, but there's nothing here. And then call side 144.
2289.92s: So this is also very heavy to the front. SZL, TSSI is still heavier on the front.
2301.04s: And then let's take a look for six months. Now for those that trade momentum,
2312.56s: let me move you guys over for a second so I can grab something. I want to grab a piece of a book.
2319.84s: I just don't want to have to flip through too much of the book because I try not to eat.
2325.52s: I try not to put too much of that stuff out there because I feel like if somebody wants to read
2332.40s: the book, you should support the author if you can. Again, I don't say that any sort of judgmental
2337.12s: way because I went through a phase where I had to try to get stuff. However, I could get stuff.
2342.08s: But I'm at the point now where I don't have to do that thankfully. And
2350.00s: here.
2356.32s: Okay, this is the section that I think makes sense. So this is from a book called quantitative momentum
2364.40s: of practitioners guide to building momentum based stock selection systems. This is written by
2370.08s: actually a friend of mine named West Gray. He's a PhD prior marine. So super solid dude.
2378.00s: He runs some of the largest ETF funds over a billion dollars of ETF funds. So it just
2385.28s: wild amount of money. And he loves momentum. He's like very interested in momentum.
2392.72s: And in his book, he talks about three different types of momentum. There's more than three,
2397.84s: but here are three short term long term intermediate. And it gives you the requisite lookback periods
2404.40s: for these. So short term is a month look back long term five years or 60 months intermediate is
2411.28s: one year look back. And what they do is they start from a really solid position, which is what I
2420.56s: always recommend to you as traders is review the existing research.
2425.68s: Anytime that we think about trying to trade something, we should review the existing research.
2432.56s: That's what you do in any sort of research based approach. That's exactly what they do here. Because
2441.04s: it's fucking smart. It decreases the total amount of work you have to do because you can pick up
2447.92s: where things have been left off. Okay. So they cite a paper by Lehman. And it says that that
2457.04s: paper, which is from 62 to 86. So a really long study, but in a dated market regime, it says
2464.56s: finds that portfolios of securities that had positive returns in the prior week, typically a
2470.96s: negative returns in the next week. This is an important effect. If you trade momentum,
2479.04s: this is a very important effect for you to be aware of. And then it says those stocks with
2484.80s: negative returns in the prior week, typically at prior returns the next week. So this is just
2491.12s: looking at broad data samples and coming up with general trends. But this is a reversion style
2498.32s: approach. Next by Jagadish. For those that don't know in terms of momentum, Jagadish has a bunch of
2505.12s: papers. A lot of really great work. And it says that they find similar reversal in returns last
2511.60s: month winners or next month's losers and vice versa. So the effect is large and significant. So
2517.52s: there's literally a tradable effect right here. You can trade short term reversals on momentum.
2525.04s: So again, what you can do is you can sort things that have had a negative return over the last
2531.36s: month with the expectation of at least some sort of positive recovery return on the following
2536.96s: month. And you can test all this stuff on your own. And then this goes further into detail on
2544.72s: these different kinds of reversion. So here it's again, it summarizes pretty clearly. It says
2551.76s: key takeaway short term winners or losers in the near term future short term losers or winners
2557.52s: in the near term future. Overall momentum over a short time horizon one can expect to see a
2563.04s: reversal in short term returns. And then is you zoom this out over a longer time that obviously
2569.36s: will begin to change. So the concept of momentum is really important. And when I'm studying stuff
2576.24s: like this, there's a really slick way to think about this then. So we can take a look at stuff that's
2581.52s: a big over the last month. And then maybe we can speculate that it doesn't necessarily go down,
2586.88s: but might not have as strong as a following month or at least a couple of week period if things
2592.64s: start looking overextended. So that's one really simple approach. Then you can play longer term
2598.64s: continuation ideas and stuff like that. That just gives you some context on like why I'm using the
2603.92s: scans that I am because it walks me into those kinds of ideas based on what the portfolio needs more
2609.76s: probably. Lauren says deeper dive into selling calls and puts. I think that would be good. I think
2620.72s: like something about selling options could be really good because a lot of people like to sell
2625.36s: options. I think maybe that would also be like a really good series to try to help those in
2630.64s: theta gang understand like the risk that's in front of them because a lot of them really don't
2636.32s: I think fully appreciate what they're doing and the implications of what they're doing.
2640.64s: That could be a really good one. Let's take a look at L.E.U. really fast. So L.E.U. popped up
2647.84s: actually from a little bit of research I was doing on nuclear investment opportunities.
2655.68s: I posted the summation of that research for the pro members in the discourse. You can see like
2662.16s: actual the out brief that I built iterating with Gemini a little bit on the concept.
2668.16s: But this stock flagged for a couple different reasons and it's because they have a very interesting
2675.68s: positioning in the broader nuclear theme. So when and for those that don't know this is like the
2685.28s: funnest part about the stock market to me is you get a chance to learn about a ton of stuff.
2691.60s: You're never going to be a full expert in any of it but you'll have a rudimentary understanding
2695.76s: of a ton of things which I actually really really enjoy. So one of the things that I was learning
2701.04s: about today was this concept of enrichment and the concept of HALU, H-A-L-E-U which is high
2714.08s: assay low enriched uranium which is a next generation fuel essential for many advanced reactor
2722.40s: designs. So the interesting thing is with this companies like L.E.U. are actually really really
2733.04s: well positioned because L.E.U. is the central player in the U.S. to solve the HALU problem.
2741.92s: And they right now are one of the this part right here. It's strategic advantage is that it operates
2752.00s: the only facility in the U.S. licensed by NRC to produce HALU. This gives centrist of de facto
2759.68s: monopoly on the domestic market making it indispensable partner for the entire advanced reactor
2766.32s: industry. So it places it at a really interesting crossroad. So the idea here then to me is okay,
2774.80s: well let's see what the market is saying inside here which based on total O.I it's about same
2782.80s: same yet when we take a look at puts you're noticing a bunch of these puts being sold on the day
2789.68s: which are people either gaining entry via short puts or people that were just directly wrong
2794.56s: getting shaken out. But if we take a look at the actual options chain for L.E.U. just to see
2803.04s: what broader positioning trends we might be able to detect we can see that the call side is
2809.92s: significantly heavier in terms of premium than the put side. So the call side is 2.4 against
2815.44s: 1.5 903 against 543 825 against 261. So a lot of the puts that I see that are coming out are at
2827.60s: really interesting levels some of them represents synthetic stock positions to me. But you can see in
2833.68s: the the longer run that overall call skew continues. So that in and of itself is a pretty interesting
2842.24s: skew. Now if we take a look at the actual I'm looking for here this if we take a look at
2855.20s: just some of the random reports that exist this is one of the things I actually like by the way
2862.24s: about thinkorswim is that it cleanly links to stuff like this. So we can see that
2870.24s: that there's a pretty long bias at least from market edge. I don't know market edge long term
2885.28s: long term success rate. So I never really look at these individual ones too heavily. I just
2889.60s: wanted to pop in and see what they wrote about more often than not what I care about is the overall
2895.20s: analyst rating not so much any individual one. So we can take a look at that in one of these two
2902.56s: spots I think here. And let's go to L.E.U.
2916.72s: So I don't know how many this is which is actually kind of important to me. How many is this?
2925.76s: One two three four five six.
2934.72s: 15 entries but with multiple of them being from B. Riley the same entity.
2941.44s: So this is interesting because when you go back to the momentum factor a big part of momentum is
2947.92s: actually in information discreetness or indiscreteness. And when things are less covered they tend
2957.52s: to have more growth potential which is actually quite interesting. So this looks like it's just starting
2966.64s: to gain broader traction on the larger larger stage so to speak. And if we take a look at their
2976.08s: financials let's see. So what I'm doing is I'm just getting a sense of where their book comes
2990.72s: from Uranium's 103 mil contract services 541 product 315. And net income let's take a look year
3004.32s: over year. So Q1 against Q1 is pretty strong. Let's take a look at Q2 54 mil against year over year Q2
3022.40s: which isn't Q3 in my bad sorry. Oh no Q2 is here in my bad my bad my bad. This is Q4 Q3
3031.28s: here's Q2 so Q2 was 31 mil in 2024
3042.00s: 13 so year over year it's growing
3045.44s: Q4 of 23 was 56 mil 54 mil so that's good. Revenue expanding like that year over year is
3062.24s: really good. Receivables going up is good. I mean this looks interesting to me so we'll keep this
3072.16s: on the list. So what is this 23 June? L.E.U. This would be like long calls.
3087.20s: So now let's actually just poke through these really fast and see how the prior
3097.12s: prior ideas have been panning out. I'm going to move this out of the way so I can just go faster
3101.60s: but you can see what's here now and I'm just going to flip through them and see how things are going.
3109.84s: So first one is GE we looked at this on 25 May
3117.04s: here and this was a bullish idea so really two solid exits that one's working just fine
3127.12s: next is SMR this was also on 25 May so even with the pullbacks this is still looking absolutely fine.
3139.04s: Duke energy this was long calls on 25 May this one I think is a loser it would have been entry here
3148.24s: so even though it's technically up a little I still would call it a loser because this didn't go
3153.52s: the direction that it should be going that being said this looks interesting from a risk premium lens
3159.84s: now that I'm looking at it. Yeah I kind of like this oh yeah that's the other thing I wanted to do
3179.20s: so I wanted to update one of these labels this one I want to update this so that I can look at
3192.32s: the percentage of time for the window looked at that there's risk premium so update this script
3201.60s: having chat GPT to update this script so in the VRP label at the end it includes a count of
3216.00s: handles where there is positive VRP then express as a person which should be
3228.48s: xx cent and then positive over negative. See what this does
3243.76s: and this is looking at 30 day
3257.92s: all right still let's go 11 out of 19 37 that does make sense
3273.44s: so this is showing 11 out of 19 however the chart is a six month daily
3292.64s: so right now it's looking back only 30 bars which that makes sense
3303.44s: so now this new version should get rid of that
3314.32s: the math doesn't make sense now it shows 74% 93 over 3
3326.08s: so I'm having to explain this to me what it's trying to do
3342.24s: okay so it's just doing yeah this looks good
3345.36s: cool that worked
3358.80s: talkingly well wait um I will update the version that you guys have in the
3368.32s: thingscript library on the patreon so I'll post this in there so that you have the new version of
3374.16s: it so this will be iv lower plot
3383.36s: and again to find these all you need to do is go to the thingscript collection
3389.28s: and you'll find it so you guys have that now too so all I'm doing with this is getting a sense of
3395.04s: how frequent there's 30 day risk premiums because this does look interesting from like just a
3401.92s: risk premium play except there's absolutely no liquidity which is the worst
3407.68s: v-sats this was a risk premium play this was from 25 May so we really we would have lost here so
3419.52s: that's absolutely a loser it wouldn't have even gotten to be that bad the v-sat that one's a loser
3427.44s: aap this was a long strangle that would be delta hedged this was on three June so this would be fine
3441.68s: that would be profitable CRWV this was looking at trading intraday longs from three June
3452.64s: June which mixed I wouldn't consider that a win hymns originally was a breakout but they just
3461.76s: got smashed today that's for sure so hymns was an instance where there wasn't an immediate entry
3469.20s: but kind of an earmark for an entry you can actually see where the alert was set but yeah hymns
3476.56s: got absolutely smashed today so there's that would just be a lingering thing there'd be nothing on
3484.48s: there mvst this was long calls on 10 June so those are under water now
3496.72s: bba i these were also long calls on 10 June here so those are up doesn't actually look like a lot
3508.32s: but those are actually of decent oh no these were on eight June my bad both of those were from
3514.80s: eight June so mvst as well so that would have been an entry here these are actually doing not
3520.24s: terrible this I like better for like a short put style trade though just because
3528.64s: it's like you can see that there's a pretty clear floor baked in but I mean there's a lot of
3534.64s: calls trading here there's a lot of calls trading and man that's huge premiums though
3543.52s: so super volatile coming into earnings on the 31st how do they look at earnings
3555.12s: let's see how they typically look bba i
3565.44s: a big downside drift big downside drift literally all save for two of the last
3578.24s: downside drift so I like this one but it's nothing that I would do just yet
3588.08s: i would trade it for earnings which again that's on the 31st so this has been super range bound
3600.88s: so this is the kind of thing where trading short triangles looks pretty good
3608.96s: but then you just have to size it with the expectation of a big move at some point
3614.00s: yes
3615.52s: Lauren says gnw volume is almost doubled oh interesting gnw
3622.88s: yeah
3626.08s: they obviously had some really big news come out here on the 18th
3631.28s: oh earnings
3632.56s: yeah they they had earnings
3645.92s: so yeah they clearly just had a had a solid had a solid report
3652.24s: that's what I see there
3656.40s: tweets all right gang good catch you know i'm out of here being a hot liar see you guys later
3662.08s: you
