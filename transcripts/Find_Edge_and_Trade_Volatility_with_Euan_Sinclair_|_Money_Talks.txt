2.30s: what's up everybody I am super stoked I
5.70s: have Yuan Sinclair here with me and I
8.46s: was just telling him before we started
9.96s: that I'm a huge fan I've essentially
12.12s: read all of his books which are
14.10s: fantastic reads we'll talk a little bit
15.66s: about those in a little bit but first
17.82s: and foremost you and first thank you for
20.40s: taking some time to chat with us and
22.20s: then secondly welcome to the
23.94s: conversation great to have you thanks
26.04s: very much for having me I'm always
28.32s: always delighted to give my
29.70s: ill-considered opinions on things so
31.62s: this is great I'll talk about options
33.06s: all day
33.96s: it's actually really cool though that
36.12s: you feel that way because you know I I
38.34s: feel like a lot of people once they
41.10s: figure out their way sometimes they
42.60s: don't want to share quite as much and
43.80s: they just want to do so I think it's
46.14s: just really really awesome that in
48.78s: addition to being able to do something
50.40s: you are actively trying to share
52.20s: information about it which is just kind
54.36s: of incredible so with that is the
56.16s: background
57.72s: um I've read like I said all of your
59.94s: books but for the people that are
61.44s: listening in that might be coming across
63.12s: you maybe for the first time
65.22s: I would love to start with like how did
67.38s: you get into trading why trading
69.12s: obviously I know that you have a very
71.52s: um technical background but what led you
74.34s: into the world of trading as compared to
76.02s: any other Avenue open to you
79.38s: well actually at the time I didn't think
81.24s: there were any other avenues open to me
83.04s: which is sort of why I fell into trading
85.98s: um I'm coming New Zealand originally and
87.54s: New Zealand does not have a history of
90.66s: trading in the same way that the US does
94.08s: um there are historical reasons for that
95.58s: in terms of the way the stock market was
97.26s: structured and also taxation laws it
100.14s: made it much cheaper for people to
103.02s: speculate on property rather than stocks
106.26s: so no one knew anything about stalks I
108.18s: didn't know anything about stocks
110.34s: um I did my PhD in England
112.50s: I always wanted
114.78s: to be a physics Professor I always
116.76s: thought I was going to be until I
119.16s: figured out hey I didn't really like
122.04s: doing what academics spend most of their
124.26s: time doing
125.58s: and B I probably wasn't good enough to
129.60s: get the sort of job I wanted
131.66s: academics brutally competitive and
135.84s: I was probably looking at three or four
137.70s: postdocs before I got a permanent
139.80s: position and that permanent position
142.08s: probably wasn't going to be Caltech or
144.30s: MIT so at that point I started looking
146.70s: around and I remember actually saying to
149.46s: someone at the time the problem is I had
151.92s: no skills
153.54s: and she was trying to make me feel
155.52s: better of course so she was like oh you
157.14s: can do this and this and this I'm like
158.58s: yeah but I really you really can't can I
160.50s: and this was before this was before
162.90s: everyone knew how to use computers and I
164.88s: didn't use a computer for my PhD it was
166.80s: very much old school you know pencil and
169.56s: paper mathematics
171.72s: um
172.50s: so Nick Leeson at the time did me the
175.62s: favor of blowing up Baron's bank which
178.56s: was the oldest
180.14s: English
181.74s: uh merchantment
184.38s: so that was big story over there and so
188.04s: the popular press was talking about it
190.44s: and explaining these things called
192.42s: derivatives and then they said and these
196.02s: things are now being priced by phds and
199.02s: Mathematics and physics and they're
201.06s: called Rocket scientists and I was like
202.92s: ah probably could do that
205.56s: so I started going for interviews
207.90s: based on that it was really
210.06s: just a matter of timing and what I heard
212.10s: about and I kind of thought sure I like
214.92s: sort of making bets and I can do numbers
217.68s: if that's all it takes I can do that
221.12s: so you came across derivatives in that
224.70s: context and then after you did that how
228.78s: did you find your way into options
230.52s: specifically compared to all the other
232.80s: kind of derivatives that are out there
234.12s: you know top of Mind Futures obviously
235.98s: there's way more than that but
237.90s: um y options
239.76s: okay so I just want to be very clear I
242.04s: had no idea what I was doing at this
243.60s: point like coming from the outside I
247.44s: didn't know the difference between
248.82s: Trading
250.26s: sales
251.66s: being a court being a court date to me
255.18s: it does none of these jobs are
258.50s: particularly publicly visible
261.06s: so I could have ended up quite easily in
263.40s: a completely different spot I see
266.70s: Futures was never going to happen
268.44s: because of the culture of Futures
270.06s: Trading in England which is very
273.18s: very old school very East End uh sort of
276.66s: you know
278.22s: almost the guys who would be sort of
280.74s: working in Market stores would have been
283.08s: taxi drivers would have been running
284.76s: pubs it's a very very blue collar type
287.88s: thing those guys you know they were
289.80s: never going to hire me so it was really
291.90s: those guys didn't want me more than I
294.78s: didn't make a deliberate choice to get
296.22s: into options the people who were hiring
298.08s: people like me were the options firms
300.60s: and the big ones at that time were all
302.76s: from America they'd all gone to Europe
305.16s: and set up operations there
307.08s: so they knew very well what they wanted
309.90s: it was basically mimicking what they've
311.76s: been doing in the US for four or five
313.80s: years before that
315.24s: interesting so it was kind of like you
317.22s: were growing where you were planted
318.60s: almost that's where the opportunity was
320.40s: and you kind of found your way into
321.54s: options that way as compared to like a
323.34s: discreet decision point like I want this
325.50s: versus that
326.82s: yeah I I chose the particular job based
331.80s: on
332.64s: the people I wanted to work with and the
336.30s: firm type I wanted to do
338.70s: as opposed to the exact thing I would be
342.06s: doing like I was also offering a job as
344.76s: a
345.60s: like a real quote you know pricing
348.36s: things and doing structured pricing and
351.66s: also as I convert our sales Trader
356.46s: so I didn't know the difference between
359.34s: any of these things like I said and I
361.14s: really just went on the basis of I think
363.48s: these people are kind of cool I'd like
364.80s: to work for them
366.60s: got it so you go through a couple jobs I
370.80s: assume or what did your first couple
372.42s: gigs look like just to have an idea of
374.22s: your evolution in the options space
378.06s: well actually I've had a lot of jobs if
380.28s: you look at my resume but it's really
382.92s: largely
384.48s: two jobs okay because most of them have
388.32s: been with the same group of people in
391.86s: various different contexts so I started
395.46s: off doing Market making I evolved to
398.28s: doing
399.36s: pure quote stuff for a couple of years
402.02s: then I was doing sort of management risk
405.30s: management stuff then I quit and just
408.84s: traded my PA and did some work in it
412.56s: starting a hedge fund and in the last
415.80s: couple of years I've gone back to those
418.32s: guys again
419.46s: so it's really
422.04s: it looks like I've had a lot more jobs
423.66s: than I really have I'd say I've had two
425.22s: jobs
426.24s: got it and so I think people like you
429.36s: have one of the most fascinating
430.86s: perspectives because you've kind of seen
433.26s: you know two sides of the coin you were
436.86s: on institution Market making side and
439.44s: then obviously you are also trading your
441.06s: personal account
442.80s: um I would love to you know talk just a
444.90s: little bit about that because some of my
446.94s: favorite things I've heard you say and
449.16s: things that I've read of yours is kind
451.26s: of dispelling some of these common myths
453.72s: that retail Traders have about the
456.36s: institution side and I also tend to
459.06s: agree with your general hypothesis that
460.86s: a lot of it I don't want to speak for
462.30s: you but it seems like retail traders in
464.58s: general we we want to blame something it
467.10s: can't be us that's doing something wrong
468.78s: there's got to be a boogeyman out there
470.64s: that's making all of this go awry as
472.98s: compared to just not having a positive
475.20s: expectant strategy so I would love to
478.02s: touch on that real quick that's one of
479.64s: my favorite parts of your dialogue that
481.92s: I've heard so far and I was actually
483.12s: like really pertinent I think to a lot
485.22s: of the the retail communities so as we
488.76s: retail think about institutions market
490.74s: makers again A lot of times we think
492.54s: they're the boogeyman they're doing
493.62s: something wrong
495.00s: um to affect us I'm curious what your
497.04s: take is on that kind of thought process
498.72s: and if you could shed a little light on
501.06s: the institutional side and what it's
502.62s: actually like for them
505.08s: yeah okay so first it's not just retail
508.56s: people who like to blame something else
512.22s: a professional trading desk is full of
514.62s: the biggest crybabies you've ever heard
516.24s: nothing's got their fault it's always
518.16s: the technology it's always someone else
520.02s: who knew something toxic order flow
523.32s: um no one can complain like trainers so
525.72s: that's something retails got down very
527.64s: well oh good they've learned that as
530.04s: well as the pros
531.96s: I think
533.88s: a couple of the big misconceptions uh
538.68s: what the professionals do is a
542.22s: completely different job to what retail
544.86s: guys do it's in the same space
548.16s: but it would be like comparing
551.84s: this is an analogy I'm just dreaming up
554.22s: so it might be terrible it might it's
555.84s: like comparing a car dealer to a car
558.90s: designer
560.04s: they both work in the auto space
562.74s: but it's a completely different job
565.16s: retail has to go out and sort of scam
568.98s: the whole world for little niches that
571.62s: they can make money in and they
573.54s: typically have to jump from thing to
575.34s: thing because none of these things last
576.96s: very long and it's all a matter of
579.30s: chasing the hot thing so a few years ago
581.52s: it was about
582.96s: and then it was the mean stocks and then
585.48s: it was crypto and so on and so on
588.80s: institutional guys don't do that if
591.42s: you're an Institutional Trader you will
593.28s: be brought in and you'll be trained and
595.80s: so there's this idea oh you can't learn
597.78s: trading well tell that to the
599.58s: professional firms who train thousands
601.86s: of Traders every year
603.42s: and what they do is they train you to do
605.64s: a very specific thing you're an option
607.98s: an equity options Market maker you will
610.44s: be able to spend the rest of your
611.88s: trading career doing that
614.22s: so you become a very very specialized in
618.90s: one thing as opposed to retail who are
621.90s: Jack of all trades and jumping around
623.58s: and that's one of the reasons retail is
625.50s: so much harder because because
629.06s: that you you have to reinvent yourself
631.38s: all the time and professionals don't and
634.98s: that reinvention process is just a very
637.44s: very difficult thing markets evolve much
640.20s: quicker than people can
641.94s: so what retail we're trying to do is is
645.90s: very difficult and one of the reasons
647.82s: retail don't succeed and they're always
649.98s: like well we don't succeed because the
651.60s: pros have better information and better
653.40s: technology that's not it is all but the
655.68s: reason the pros do it is because by
657.96s: doing an easier game
660.12s: I mean they have the costs ends the
663.18s: capital backing to run these very very
666.00s: low margin trades at very big size and
669.36s: make money
670.44s: most of the things the pros do the
672.48s: retail can't do because it's too
673.86s: expensive like you can't do Dynamic
676.02s: hedging of an option as a retail guy
677.64s: you'll just get eaten alive by costs
680.52s: um that kind of thing
681.96s: so I think that's the biggest
684.36s: misconception
687.24s: um
687.96s: the other things and all the thing which
689.58s: I've gone on about in the past that a
692.04s: lot of retail like to blame market
693.90s: makers for manipulating the market
697.56s: makers have no ability to manipulate
700.50s: anything a market maker is completely
704.58s: at the mercy of income order flow they
707.70s: are the last people to have any control
709.86s: over the market and normally when you
712.02s: see something like a stock getting
713.46s: pinned at expiration
715.32s: it's normally hurting the market makers
717.48s: the market makers aren't doing that
719.76s: so that's another
721.62s: another misconception and the idea that
724.02s: other high frequency trading is making
725.70s: it harder for us you know it's made it
728.40s: so much easier for retail because
730.02s: they've reduced costs
732.54s: um I'm old enough to remember when
734.70s: stocks were trading on the New York
736.20s: Stock Exchange and they were eighth of a
738.18s: dollar wide
739.44s: and you know good luck getting a
741.60s: specialist to actually fill you
743.76s: whereas now I mean every stock is almost
747.24s: a Choice market it's so much easier in
749.94s: that regard we still have costs but the
752.70s: bid asks of spread is nowhere near that
754.62s: hurdle it used to be
756.84s: got it and I I think that that makes a
759.54s: ton of sense by the way I see you
761.46s: drinking a seltzer water is that
763.50s: accurate
764.46s: uh yes what flavor do you have this is
768.36s: uh grapefruit oh Bowl Choice I'm going
771.30s: with mandarin orange myself but
773.70s: grapefruit is also respectable
780.06s: coconut stresses me out yeah
783.44s: coconut is a is a seltzer water that
786.00s: just doesn't sound right
787.86s: um so one of the things I actually from
790.50s: a personal perspective this is one of my
792.24s: favorite things about doing these kind
793.44s: of conversations I is I also get to
795.06s: interlace like my general personal
796.80s: Curiosities and one of them is
799.26s: I understood your analogy I forgot which
802.98s: book it's from but it was kind of like
804.42s: that market makers are essentially the
805.92s: Scavengers where they're just trying to
807.42s: pick up you know what they can along the
809.16s: way and they can't necessarily affect
810.96s: the market in any like significant way
814.04s: I'm curious how you juxtapose that
816.72s: against like stop hunting or something
819.30s: like that because to me that seems like
821.64s: there's a little bit of nuance there
824.28s: um and I'm just curious your thoughts
827.22s: yeah okay so
830.66s: then my gears stop hunting I don't even
833.34s: know if it really goes on much anymore
834.84s: that was a big thing 30 years ago but
838.68s: the Futures markets were a lot thinner
840.78s: 30 years ago and
843.92s: the Futures market makers and high
846.60s: frequency trading because high frequency
848.22s: trading is basically just using all the
850.02s: tricks that the old guys used there's
852.00s: nothing new in high frequency trading
853.74s: it's basically just Futures Trading
855.54s: Circa 1995 done fast
859.26s: um
860.16s: the bitter it's a very different game
862.26s: from options with options the bid asks
865.02s: spread is incredibly wide
867.54s: so it's easy to make that money
869.34s: initially and then you have to do the
872.22s: decomposing part of it page that until
875.04s: expiration mitigating the risk and so
877.62s: forth so the hard bit about options
879.42s: Market making is risk management
882.00s: Futures Market making the bid asks where
884.34s: there's minuscule so a lot of the money
887.64s: they made wasn't pure Market making it
890.64s: was doing stuff like hunting stops
892.50s: creating little micro squeezers
895.58s: it is a very different game
900.42s: um and it's not pure Market making the
902.76s: same way it wouldn't be
905.70s: that do it like that'd be like I'm three
908.40s: four three four three
911.22s: the money they made would be from
913.26s: pushing the market around like you say
915.60s: but they can push at a few points
918.30s: you know they couldn't run the spooza
920.22s: 200 points I mean they're not doing that
923.40s: but they do have the ability to put
926.04s: these little micro squeezers together
928.50s: got it that makes a ton of sense I was
931.08s: actually wondering if it was a timing
932.52s: thing so just in terms of like the
934.50s: market conditions so I I think that's a
936.90s: really good explanation
938.46s: um dovetailing off of that one of the
941.34s: other things I wanted to ask you is
944.28s: I feel like as the retail Traders become
948.90s: I don't want to use the term
950.10s: sophisticated just because I think we're
951.66s: a far away off of that but comparatively
954.06s: I feel like there is a certain level of
956.76s: gain in just general retail Trader
959.34s: sophistication I notice a lot of retail
962.16s: Traders compare their approach
965.94s: to a institution side approach and it
970.26s: always confuses me a little bit because
971.82s: I feel like retail Traders feel like
974.46s: what the professional approach is is the
977.10s: right Broach it's almost like if you
979.20s: play sports and you want to get good at
981.30s: basketball you kind of watch the NBA but
983.94s: to me it seems like that could be a
986.28s: dangerous comparison but I wanted to get
988.44s: your thoughts on that thought process
991.70s: yeah okay so what basketball right if
995.16s: you're a rec league player you are
997.80s: playing the same game as the NBA you're
1000.02s: just playing it a lot worse
1001.88s: whereas retail Traders are doing they
1004.70s: have to do different things to the pros
1006.86s: and like I said for a couple of reasons
1009.14s: first most of what the pros do is very
1012.62s: low margin on massive Capital bases and
1015.86s: low costs retail can't do that and if
1019.70s: they try they're going to lose
1021.56s: the other thing is
1023.24s: if you take a firm one of the big
1025.16s: options trading firms like you know
1026.66s: Susquehanna don't we have hundreds of
1029.18s: tech people and quotes it's a team
1032.42s: effort so you know you as a retail guy
1035.66s: might have a Dutch model that you've
1037.64s: programmed in VBA or python
1040.34s: but Susquehanna has a Dutch model that
1043.40s: 50 people have been working on for the
1045.56s: last 20 years
1047.12s: even if you try and do that it would be
1050.24s: the same as the rec league player
1052.22s: stepping on the court with Steph Curry
1053.80s: it's just at that point just ridiculous
1056.66s: you're going to lose if you do the same
1059.84s: thing as the pros you're not going to
1062.60s: make money
1063.74s: so I think there's a misconception about
1065.84s: what the pros actually do and then
1068.30s: there's this idea that you have to do
1070.58s: what the pros do whereas you should be
1072.26s: doing something totally different
1074.84s: right and that's actually a beautiful
1077.36s: segue into the concept of
1080.78s: um just the variance premiums so pretty
1083.90s: much all of your books touch on that in
1086.06s: some capacity and I think it's a really
1089.12s: interesting concept because
1092.12s: um for anybody listening in the way that
1094.34s: you describe it is the most pragmatic in
1098.12s: my opinion and I think it's a lot of
1100.76s: Traders I think accidentally find their
1104.12s: way into it but they don't even really
1105.38s: know what's going on with it or why what
1108.14s: they're doing is working so to peel that
1111.08s: back a little bit I'd love to hear how
1113.36s: you even came across the concept of the
1115.46s: variance premium I know that you've been
1117.08s: studying derivatives Mark it's
1118.34s: essentially back from I think use an
1120.08s: example of an Italian guy oh no that was
1123.02s: for Market making sorry
1124.70s: um the the guy that essentially kept
1127.10s: Market making even though his uh his
1129.32s: thing up burnt yeah that's actually
1130.64s: really good America found it yeah I I
1133.52s: love that actually do you mind mind just
1135.50s: explaining that real quick because I
1137.42s: think just to switch gears the concept
1139.70s: of Market making one of the points you
1141.20s: made in your book is essentially they
1142.58s: have to make markets in order to make
1144.08s: money if they don't make markets they're
1145.46s: not making money and you gave this
1147.14s: really cool example about that that
1149.84s: um that approach
1151.22s: yeah it's a long time ago I'm not really
1153.26s: sure I remember all the details I mean
1155.30s: but the
1156.26s: as a market maker you've got one thing
1158.30s: in your favor which is the bid asks for
1160.64s: it you have nothing else in your favor
1163.82s: like if the market trends you get run
1166.28s: over if you're trading against someone
1168.56s: who knows something you get run over
1171.86s: um if the market becomes more volatile
1173.90s: you'll get run over all you can do is
1176.66s: click the bid ask spread so you have to
1179.06s: do it as often as possible and to the
1181.94s: point where you have to do everything in
1184.82s: your favor to be able to do that so if
1187.64s: you ever get to a situation based on
1189.62s: inventory or technology problems where
1193.28s: you can't trade that is the worst thing
1197.48s: because you'll still be losing money
1199.28s: because of the inventory you've got but
1201.38s: you have no ability to make money and I
1204.44s: just thought the story of uh I can't
1206.00s: remember who it was can't remember the
1207.26s: name of them but he was the founder of
1209.12s: Bank of America or what became Bank of
1210.98s: America uh it was just a good story
1213.02s: because you know it was after the
1214.40s: earthquake in whenever that was was it
1218.38s: 1876 or something
1221.06s: um
1221.78s: and like his bank got knocked down and
1225.08s: he was like look I'm going to keep
1226.16s: trading that's it I'm gonna everyone
1228.20s: else has stopped there's Edge in the
1230.12s: market I'm going to be the one who's
1231.44s: going to be by you know borrowing and
1233.06s: lending money
1234.26s: and uh it's just a great attitude for
1236.24s: market makers to have you know when
1238.28s: things go crazy if you're the guy you
1240.02s: can make markets that's that's what you
1242.78s: want
1243.98s: yeah I actually I looked them up I think
1246.32s: his name is giannini
1248.24s: um and yeah I just I looked up that
1250.70s: story because I thought it was so
1251.66s: fascinating but thanks for sharing that
1253.82s: one I think it's a a good thing for
1255.62s: retail to even understand the world and
1257.78s: the motivations of market makers
1260.06s: um and I think that you know that that
1261.92s: explains a part of it at least so
1264.44s: switching back over to the retail side
1266.30s: you at some point came across variance
1269.54s: risk premium well different kinds of
1271.40s: variance premiums but specifically
1272.72s: variance risk premium
1274.58s: um how did you find that like what led
1276.68s: you what how did you come across that
1279.38s: okay well so I certainly it's been
1282.86s: around forever okay and
1285.98s: there weren't an awful lot of options
1289.22s: books
1290.60s: talking about options trading from any
1293.24s: degree of sophistication
1295.46s: um
1296.60s: but there were always Traders and one of
1300.02s: the things they always said was it's a
1303.26s: floor trading scene
1305.18s: if in doubt hands out
1307.82s: is it because that's a cell you're
1309.92s: selling if you don't know whether a
1312.80s: price is a good buy or a good sell it's
1315.74s: probably something you should be selling
1317.60s: because they knew that the edge was
1320.36s: always with the seller and they didn't
1323.30s: know how the age was and the math wasn't
1325.82s: there the data wasn't there but they
1328.10s: knew that options were overpriced so
1330.80s: really what
1332.42s: what it's been since then is really just
1334.40s: having more data to back up that that
1337.10s: idea
1339.20s: um and that's essentially what I've
1342.02s: basically being trading my entire career
1345.32s: and I think that's one of the things you
1347.06s: can do as a retail person but you look
1349.64s: you could do this you either have to
1351.92s: jump around from thing to thing
1354.56s: or you have to become an expert in one
1356.72s: thing
1357.80s: and if you become an expert in the the
1359.78s: variance premium you could spend your
1361.82s: the rest of your life trading that one
1363.26s: effect
1364.12s: knowing when it's high knowing when it's
1366.44s: low looking for the specific situations
1368.42s: where it's a good trade and where it
1370.22s: isn't
1371.66s: um
1372.32s: it's a different kind of skill like I've
1375.62s: tried to do the thing where I'm always
1378.38s: looking for the hot new thing and
1380.00s: jumping something and I know some guys
1381.68s: who do it and they've done very well I
1383.54s: can't do it because that requires
1387.62s: it requires a lot of imagination to find
1390.80s: these things
1392.66s: and that's just not me I'm I'm better at
1395.72s: thinking about something as a problem
1399.86s: I wouldn't say deeply but thinking about
1401.96s: one thing
1403.10s: so I think that the sort of two
1405.70s: complementary approaches to trading and
1408.86s: ideally you do both but I don't know
1410.90s: anyone who can do both
1413.00s: fair enough and that leads me to the
1415.58s: next question for you
1417.44s: um is when I think about retail Traders
1421.88s: and their approach to the markets I
1424.76s: think you've mentioned it a couple times
1426.20s: now where you know very interest premium
1428.96s: should be integrated somewhere for
1432.02s: retail Traders not necessarily the only
1434.30s: thing they always do but at least
1435.74s: somewhere they should they should take a
1437.42s: look at it
1438.44s: if you were a retail Trader starting out
1441.80s: right now with let's just say I because
1444.14s: I think the average retail Trader
1445.52s: account is pretty small like maybe 5K or
1447.20s: something like that
1448.94s: um what what would you be thinking about
1451.88s: specifically as it pertains to the vrp
1456.74s: okay that's really tough because I think
1460.64s: I don't know this because it's a long
1462.92s: time since I've had
1464.60s: that kind of account
1467.72s: I think you need twenty five thousand
1469.82s: dollars to trade naked options
1472.10s: that sounds right I'm honestly not sure
1474.14s: myself but that sounds that sounds right
1482.90s: um
1483.68s: to try to sell spread or sell strangles
1487.94s: on a very small account you don't have
1490.10s: that option but there are volatility
1493.94s: ETFs and etns and there are vix Futures
1496.94s: and they both are exposed to the
1500.06s: variance premium it's a different
1502.16s: variance premium
1504.50s: um
1506.12s: how do I put this okay so the waste the
1508.22s: way options the variance premium
1509.96s: justices options are overpriced on
1512.36s: everything
1513.38s: but there are lots of sort of sub
1515.24s: factors that go into that
1517.28s: and it's the equivalent of saying stocks
1520.70s: go up
1521.78s: which is also a very well documented
1524.00s: thing if you just look at the charts
1525.56s: they go up but not all stocks go up at
1528.86s: the same rate some stocks are better
1530.72s: than others there's value stocks and
1532.52s: small cap stocks and different sectors
1534.68s: all this thing there are still sort of
1536.96s: ways to break down the variants of
1538.52s: premium and one of them is just
1541.82s: the fact that the implied volatility has
1544.82s: characteristics on its own and you can
1547.28s: trade that through the Vex futures
1550.52s: um
1551.18s: like very easy example before a timed
1555.92s: event of uncertainty so you've got an
1559.22s: uncertain outcome at a given time like
1561.62s: an election
1563.48s: Vicks will almost always go up and then
1566.00s: it will almost always collapse
1568.22s: so there's a very simple trade there
1570.22s: like before the event you buy the Vex
1573.50s: right before the event you short it and
1576.14s: then you cover it
1577.52s: exactly when you do it depends on the
1579.74s: events you have to do a bit of work you
1581.48s: know for fomc it might be five minutes
1583.34s: for an election it might be two weeks
1585.92s: you know I can't tell you those numbers
1587.54s: and I'm not calling them back I just
1590.18s: don't know
1591.92s: um that's another misconception people
1593.84s: have while I'm about to start ranting
1596.42s: they think everything is a secret
1599.24s: whereas very little that works is
1603.08s: actually a secret because there aren't
1605.60s: that many things that really work
1607.64s: so what's the work tend to have worked
1610.46s: for a long time hence there are
1612.98s: generations of people who've been doing
1614.96s: them
1615.80s: if they like pays Trading that works
1619.82s: and 35 years ago it might have only been
1623.24s: one small group of traders who knew
1624.92s: about it but now I can type in pairs
1627.86s: trading into Google and I can find a
1630.20s: YouTube course that teaches you how to
1632.06s: do it
1632.90s: probably not well but you know what I
1636.02s: mean it's like the stuff that works came
1638.90s: as to be pretty well known now so
1642.38s: I can't well I'm not going to tell you
1644.78s: everything I do but I can tell you
1647.00s: literally 90 of what I do and it's not
1649.16s: going to make any difference to whether
1650.24s: I make money or not
1652.64s: well I think there's value in that too
1654.26s: to be completely honest I actually
1655.70s: really enjoy that about your books is
1658.16s: that you share math that I I did stats
1662.36s: as part of my undergrad and my grad and
1664.94s: embarrassingly so that that book like
1667.34s: especially your most recent book
1669.68s: um School the out of me in some of
1671.66s: those math sections it did
1673.94s: um it took me a minute of like
1675.20s: re-reading through it to figure it out
1676.94s: but I think that it's really cool that
1679.40s: you share the basis behind things and
1681.92s: then you even share like some examples
1684.26s: you know to help people connect those
1686.00s: dots so I actually respect the fact that
1688.52s: you share even as much as you do because
1690.50s: I am of a similar voice where I don't
1693.68s: like giving I don't think handing
1695.24s: somebody an answer to something is doing
1697.10s: much for them because then they're
1698.78s: reliant on that specific scenario they
1700.76s: lose the ability to think and adapt for
1702.26s: themselves so I think honestly I think
1704.60s: you share a lot as is so going back to
1710.60s: um kind of the
1712.58s: trading volatility and let's we could
1715.28s: remove the account size in the in the
1717.44s: hypothetical
1719.48s: um I feel like a lot of people that I've
1722.60s: talked to about their relationship with
1724.58s: volatility trading and myself
1726.32s: specifically was I would try it but
1730.46s: hedging would eat me up it was very
1732.80s: expensive for me to hedge now with a lot
1736.22s: of brokerage firms not charging
1739.28s: commissions obviously that doesn't erase
1741.86s: the bid ask spread and what you're going
1743.54s: to eat there but I'm curious if that
1745.94s: factors into your thoughts on retail
1748.88s: Traders dynamically hedging and if your
1752.48s: thoughts on like an optimal hedging
1754.22s: period because I know you've talked
1755.60s: about the Delta bands before
1757.94s: um but I'm curious if the change in
1760.10s: commission structure has changed your
1762.08s: thoughts on you know what retail what
1765.32s: could be optimal for a retail Trader
1767.00s: obviously completely dependent on the
1768.38s: individual Trader
1771.16s: yeah okay so
1774.20s: I haven't done the actual numbers for
1776.66s: this so I'm guessing I don't think the
1779.72s: elimination of the headline commission
1782.48s: charge is going to be enough to do it
1784.16s: right you've asked spread in like for
1787.04s: example you know a 300 stock is going to
1789.08s: have a dollar bid ask spread I mean you
1791.78s: that and if you want to hedge you are
1794.66s: paying that Sprint right A lot of people
1797.18s: have this idea that well I need to buy
1798.86s: it so I'll buy it on the bit no that's
1801.14s: not hedging once you need to do a trade
1803.30s: you need to do the trade so you have to
1806.84s: cross that spread the other thing that
1809.42s: these a lot of zero Commission
1812.56s: brokerage houses
1814.36s: have exorbitant marginal rates
1817.04s: particularly on the short side and that
1820.46s: that's a significant cost as well
1823.52s: um so I doubt that that's going to be
1827.78s: a doable thing
1830.66s: um what I would recommend instead would
1833.12s: be
1834.14s: here's one of your other problems
1836.60s: let's say you want to get short
1838.58s: spy volatility right and I don't know
1841.40s: what aspy is right now you know so I
1843.26s: don't know 370 or something so you sell
1846.08s: the 370 sprattle and then next week
1849.74s: the Market's gone up to 380.
1852.62s: at this point you don't have as much
1854.78s: volatility exposure because you've gone
1856.40s: away from this front right you also had
1860.06s: Delta exposure because you've round so
1863.36s: you would need to do a hit what I would
1865.70s: recommend doing is closing your 370
1868.04s: straddle and then re-entering a 380
1870.50s: straddle so you've got volatility
1872.96s: exposure again which is what you want
1875.00s: and you hitched so you've actually sort
1878.12s: of hedged both components you want to
1880.10s: you've got rid of the Delta component
1881.48s: you didn't want and you've got the gold
1882.92s: component back on
1885.14s: um they can do that once a week that
1887.66s: will eat your life
1889.58s: um if you do that every day again that's
1891.98s: going to become way too expensive
1894.74s: um so you have to allow for that kind of
1897.02s: slot it's one of the reasons that
1900.14s: one of the reasons options are
1901.64s: frustrating is you can be completely
1903.20s: right in all your forecasts and still
1904.88s: lose money and not just in rare cases I
1908.36s: mean quite often
1910.78s: yeah I the reason why I'm smiling so
1913.40s: much is because when I first launched
1915.50s: the YouTube channel
1917.00s: um I was on Reddit a lot just because
1919.10s: it's a if you ever need a place to like
1921.92s: toughen up your skin a little bit it's a
1924.08s: good place to go and it's hilarious
1927.38s: listening to all of the people on there
1929.42s: bitching about the trade that did quote
1932.00s: unquote what they knew it would
1933.56s: obviously because they knew but they
1936.26s: still lost money you know because of
1938.00s: some other Factor pertaining to options
1940.10s: so yeah I think that that's a pretty
1942.20s: relatable circumstance
1944.42s: so when we're looking for vrp there's
1949.52s: obviously different places to look again
1951.98s: not to give too much away from your
1953.90s: books because I will link to all of them
1955.94s: in the video description because I
1957.20s: genuinely think people should read them
1958.40s: I was telling you before we started your
1960.56s: content is so easy for me to want to
1962.42s: promote because I do it already because
1964.04s: I legitimately believe in it I think
1965.84s: it's awesome
1967.34s: um but you talked a little bit about
1970.16s: places where people can more
1972.52s: consistently find it as compared to
1974.90s: others
1976.52s: um I'm curious if that Still Remains the
1980.18s: case obviously this year's a bit of an
1981.68s: anomaly but
1983.18s: um I I think I recall reading about you
1985.64s: know centralizing more indexes compared
1988.70s: to equities outright stuff like that but
1990.68s: I'm curious if that's still about the
1991.88s: case or if anything's changed there
1993.80s: I mean the last few years have been a
1996.08s: bit weird
1997.22s: um but generally
2000.10s: I haven't even if the last few years
2002.56s: have been totally different right I will
2005.08s: take the evidence of the previous
2006.40s: hundred years over two I mean that's
2009.52s: just like if something's always worked
2011.92s: and then it didn't work for a while
2013.74s: unless I know a fundamental reason for
2016.24s: why there's been a shift
2017.80s: I think you've got to take it you know
2020.08s: you've got to weigh the evidence you
2022.00s: know and that could be wrong because
2023.62s: things do change and maybe this was the
2027.04s: change but I'll bet that it wasn't
2029.92s: so in general if you're looking for a
2034.12s: high variance premium
2036.28s: look for things indices have the biggest
2039.94s: um in general things with a very steep
2042.52s: volatility skew either to the cause or
2046.24s: the puts
2047.50s: will have a variance premium
2050.02s: if there's a situation where
2054.64s: well you know I've got this
2057.00s: short related options have higher
2059.44s: variance premiums
2061.00s: why because the variance premium is a
2063.46s: risk premium ensure later options are
2066.10s: more risky to be short
2067.78s: so if you think you know well I'm going
2070.06s: to sell the two-year option just don't
2071.80s: bother there's no risk premium in a
2073.48s: two-year option
2075.46s: um you can sell it if you like but the
2077.86s: chances of it being significantly
2079.18s: overvalued are pretty minimal I mean I'd
2081.94s: rather sell a two-day auction
2084.04s: so
2085.36s: that's what you'd look you'd look for
2087.04s: short dates you look for indices you
2089.56s: look for steep skus
2091.72s: um
2092.56s: there are classes of stocks that have
2094.78s: even higher variance premiums but you've
2097.24s: got to do a lot of work to find them and
2099.28s: that's not the sort of thing you really
2100.90s: want to do as a rule of thumb that's
2103.60s: kind of like build a model with well my
2106.12s: model's got I don't know now 12
2107.92s: variables in it or something
2110.68s: yeah and it's funny you're talking a
2113.98s: little bit about the garch models before
2115.48s: because when again from from you I kind
2119.02s: of came across those different concepts
2121.06s: and I was actually reading one of your
2122.20s: papers on ssrn about the variance
2125.26s: premium so I was like ah you know let me
2127.00s: just Tinker with this to see if I can
2128.62s: even put something together and I very
2131.20s: quickly realized how much of a lift it
2134.14s: would be to continually optimize one of
2136.42s: those at least for I'm an idiot like I'm
2139.00s: I'm just happy to be sitting here you
2140.74s: know like I I don't have the the same
2144.04s: um capacity that you do to keep those
2146.50s: things up to date so I I think with that
2149.50s: as the backdrop
2152.32s: um one of the ways I've heard people
2155.32s: attempt to monitor the vrp is through
2159.82s: essentially comparing IV implied
2162.82s: volatility not for you obviously for the
2164.92s: listeners IV to HV historic volatility
2167.14s: and seeing how that Gap is trending and
2170.02s: that seems like a a decent back of the
2172.06s: napkin kind of easy way to go about it
2173.86s: but I'm curious your thoughts on that or
2175.54s: if there is a more effective way for
2178.12s: retail to kind of analyze those
2180.46s: relationships
2182.80s: you can do better than that but it's
2185.86s: almost certainly not worth the effort to
2188.80s: um you can what you're measuring there
2191.32s: is what historical goal has been which
2194.38s: is backward looking to what implied ball
2196.36s: is now which is forward-looking
2198.70s: but if all you're doing is looking for
2201.04s: broad cases where you know Village
2205.36s: premiums high or average or low
2209.26s: that will get you 90 of the way there
2212.44s: um I don't really think it's worth it
2214.12s: unless you do it very well to do a real
2217.12s: time series prediction model
2219.88s: um
2220.60s: that's one of those situations honestly
2222.64s: you can't do that as well as me
2225.16s: like I'm not saying you couldn't but you
2228.46s: don't have these accuracy if you don't
2230.08s: have the technology you don't hit you
2231.76s: just can't by the time you've caught up
2234.40s: I'll be further ahead and I can't do it
2237.64s: as well as Susquehanna
2239.38s: so I really don't try and play that game
2242.02s: either you know so
2245.56s: that sort of Time series modeling 20
2248.68s: years ago yeah
2250.30s: big agent just doing that now the
2253.36s: Market's sort of priced most of that in
2255.90s: so which has two on the downside that
2259.96s: means that edge isn't there anymore but
2262.00s: on the upside it means you don't really
2263.32s: have to do all that work anymore either
2265.66s: so you should look for circumstances now
2268.42s: where things are going to be stretched
2270.76s: for some sort of other reason like
2273.46s: there's an election
2275.32s: um there's an FOC meeting the time
2277.60s: series stop it's not as important as it
2279.88s: was so yeah
2281.80s: I mean honestly I could lie but most of
2284.98s: the time I just do exactly what you've
2286.60s: said I say it complied to 30 over the
2289.96s: last 60 days it's been 28.
2292.38s: I mean that's about as good as you need
2295.06s: to be now
2296.56s: right yeah I I think it's that's
2299.92s: actually the on my super messy chart
2302.26s: that's the middle box I have there it's
2304.06s: just because I found it to be kind of an
2305.80s: easy way to to look at it
2308.50s: um when I think about placing different
2311.98s: kinds of volatility based trades I've
2314.92s: tinkered with different ways to try to
2318.22s: isolate exposure purely to volatility
2321.10s: like we've talked about a little bit
2322.72s: before potentially via hedging or
2324.28s: trading volatility products in and of
2325.84s: themselves I'm curious again for just a
2328.72s: retail Trader is there one of those
2332.50s: scenarios that seems to make more sense
2334.48s: again just in general whether it's
2336.58s: selling straddles or strangles and then
2338.80s: Delta hedging or just trading the
2340.84s: volatility product itself
2343.06s: um outright a lot of different things
2345.52s: right if you're trading Vic's Futures
2347.68s: you're only trading the employee whereas
2350.32s: if you're trading a scramble you're
2351.94s: trading the implied versus the real
2354.04s: place so they're all tied in together
2356.38s: but they're also slightly different
2358.96s: um oh here's a good rule of thumb
2361.60s: everything in the volatility worlds mean
2363.70s: reverting like everything term structure
2367.30s: if it's out of whack it's probably going
2369.46s: to go back to where it has been skew
2371.80s: same thing variance premium same thing
2374.56s: implied Vol same thing so it's a pretty
2377.74s: good useful rule of thumb so even if you
2380.20s: don't do any other analysis if you just
2382.00s: look at where it is relative to its
2384.28s: historical range that's a pretty good
2386.44s: place to start certainly on the sell
2388.48s: side
2389.32s: it's very dangerous to buy volatility
2391.66s: because you think it's cheap
2393.52s: because it can easily stay cheap for
2395.56s: three or four years
2397.20s: so that is not
2400.18s: you can decide to sell a wall purely on
2403.36s: the basis of stats if you're going to
2405.70s: buy more you need to have some sort of
2408.52s: catalyst for why things are going to
2410.14s: change
2411.94s: um but anyway back to your
2414.22s: question
2416.58s: there's a couple of things retail do
2418.90s: roll here and it comes down to not
2421.36s: understanding where their Edge is
2423.64s: they think they can sell options and
2426.10s: collect data
2427.96s: I think Theta is not an edge
2430.78s: beta is just a measurement of what will
2433.96s: happen over time if nothing else happens
2437.14s: well you know what other things do
2439.36s: happen you move around
2441.22s: so unless you have Mis price volatility
2443.80s: you won't get that Theta you'll collect
2447.10s: the Theta but you'll lose because the
2448.90s: market moves equation
2453.16s: is is exactly says these are profits are
2457.36s: canceled by gamma losses that is the
2460.36s: equation so unless you have a volatility
2462.34s: of the age there's no reason to trade
2465.34s: options but that idea of theta
2469.24s: leads to a couple of very dangerous
2471.28s: things the first one is selling
2473.14s: strangles
2475.30s: um
2476.02s: you can sell a strangle
2478.54s: and be completely wrong about what
2481.36s: volatility should be and still make
2483.76s: money an enormous amount of the time
2485.74s: right for example like
2488.88s: uh let's say
2490.96s: on selling ball at 25 this is I'll give
2494.68s: you real numbers if I did this recently
2496.12s: I still remember them I sell them all at
2497.98s: 25 I expect it to be 20. so I've got
2502.18s: five files of edge
2503.98s: and let's say it's actually 40. so I've
2506.56s: made a horrific trade
2508.60s: if I sell the straddle
2510.82s: after about 10 trades or 10 days or 10
2515.32s: periods
2516.88s: I will probably have enough evidence to
2519.70s: statistically tell me I've done
2521.26s: something wrong
2522.28s: I'll probably actually see you know what
2524.68s: I'm expecting an average p l of x
2527.32s: it's y
2529.06s: and the t-test tells me those things are
2531.82s: different and then I can evaluate if you
2534.70s: saw a strangle that's quite easy for you
2537.10s: to do 10 trades in a row and think
2539.08s: you've made money
2540.58s: and all you've done is you haven't seen
2543.46s: that disastrous case pop up yet you have
2546.76s: Negative Edge it just hasn't been
2548.20s: realized so strangles are dangerous as
2551.50s: hell because they give you the wrong
2553.36s: feedback
2554.62s: you want to be told how you're doing I
2557.44s: mean think about it right you were in
2558.70s: the military
2559.60s: okay do you want to be told you're doing
2562.30s: really well you're going great well you
2564.82s: want to be told the truth
2566.50s: because it's a lot like the truth yeah
2568.84s: absolutely why it's if you if your
2572.14s: friendly drill sergeant is telling
2574.06s: everyone oh you guys are doing great
2576.18s: you're just awesome and you're not
2578.80s: that's the worst thing you can hear and
2581.32s: that's what a strangle is like
2583.06s: the other thing retail do terribly is
2586.18s: they do combos
2587.74s: so I wanted to ask you about these but
2590.68s: the problem is
2592.00s: you are selling something because you
2595.24s: have age
2596.44s: and then you're buying some other things
2599.56s: you are
2600.94s: you know volatility is overpriced
2604.54s: once you know the stuff you're buying is
2607.12s: overpriced but worse than that you're
2609.94s: buying far out of the money auctions
2611.74s: which are the most overpriced
2614.44s: so you're taking you never have a huge
2617.38s: Edge in the market right so
2620.26s: I literally did this example this
2622.42s: morning so I was writing a course
2624.88s: uh I was selling an spy straddle I had
2628.42s: 600 of expected value that I could make
2631.60s: if I bought the wings that I would
2634.06s: naturally buy if I was trying to hedge
2635.98s: my downside I'm reducing that to 260
2639.16s: dollars
2640.24s: and like halving the amount of money I
2642.88s: can make
2644.02s: and all I've done is kept the losses you
2647.20s: have kept the losses
2648.88s: but you're much better off
2651.34s: first if you have to
2654.10s: only hedge the downside
2656.32s: because crashes up they don't
2659.50s: mean they could happen but the biggest s
2662.14s: p up move in the last 20 or 30 years has
2664.42s: been like seven percent
2666.72s: up move there could be a 50 down look
2670.42s: so don't hedge both sides and always
2674.26s: realize Hedges are the most expensive
2676.96s: things you can do
2678.40s: so if you have to do that hedge to stay
2681.28s: in the game
2682.66s: it might not be a game you can win
2685.72s: and you're much better off just trade it
2688.96s: small enough so if the s p goes to zero
2692.80s: I mean you'll lose money but you
2696.22s: shouldn't like you know have to
2698.04s: re-mortgage your house or something
2699.94s: right you're using size to control risk
2702.94s: size and diversification are a much
2705.10s: better risk control than hedges
2707.20s: I mean that sort of hedge is just so
2710.20s: expensive that you're probably better
2711.94s: off just
2713.62s: you know seriously if that's what you
2715.60s: have to do you probably shouldn't be
2717.82s: planned
2718.90s: that I'm I'm honestly
2721.20s: refreshed to hear you say that because a
2723.88s: lot of things I see new options Traders
2726.10s: and myself included I'm one of these
2727.84s: really fortunate people where I started
2729.70s: trading very young and it's because
2731.80s: somebody just recommended investing to
2734.02s: me I had a single mom so we had no money
2735.82s: so I scraped together what I could dude
2737.44s: saw me work and he's like you should
2738.64s: check this out so I was like okay cool
2740.32s: and when I started to find options kind
2743.20s: of like what you're talking about I was
2744.58s: like oh well I want to sell a put in
2746.38s: this but I can't afford it so maybe I'll
2748.42s: just do like a put spread and I feel
2751.06s: like a lot of new options Traders
2753.82s: attempt to force their ability to trade
2757.12s: by doing exactly what I did
2758.68s: unfortunately
2760.54s: um and long term it just doesn't work
2762.10s: out super well at least that was in my
2763.90s: experience as soon as I could move away
2765.22s: from them I did
2766.84s: I want to know your thoughts though I've
2769.48s: seen a lot of people there's I don't
2771.34s: know if you've come across it anywhere
2772.84s: but there's a lot a lot of talk about
2775.42s: these zero DTE SPX spreads there's like
2779.50s: entire communities that have formed
2781.72s: around this idea
2783.28s: and most of them deal with selling far
2788.20s: out of the money spreads either Condors
2790.72s: or put spreads but what they do on top
2793.78s: of that is they include a stop
2796.78s: so not only did they spread it off but
2799.48s: then they have a stop limit of some sort
2802.00s: and very common figures are like three
2804.64s: times credit received something like
2806.68s: that two times credit received I'm
2808.84s: curious if you come across any of those
2811.00s: kind of strategies and if so what your
2812.80s: thoughts were if not obviously no no
2814.96s: problem
2818.38s: yeah okay so
2822.10s: very short dated options like I said
2824.56s: have a lot of itch uh I trade zero DTE
2828.28s: stuff all the time I love it
2831.40s: and I don't want to sort of make a
2833.86s: blanket statement about what these
2835.24s: people are doing because I'm sure
2836.62s: they've all got nuances and so forth
2838.30s: sure but it sounds to me they're making
2840.04s: at least three very common mistakes
2842.56s: the first one is to do a strangle which
2845.26s: like I said it gives you statistically
2847.18s: terrible feedback and it makes it very
2850.00s: hard to know if you're actually right or
2852.64s: you just haven't seen that downside yet
2856.66s: um next about doing the thing I said was
2858.82s: bad which is buying those wings which is
2861.34s: the most expensive thing you can do all
2864.52s: Hedges cost money if you think you've
2867.16s: found a hedge that doesn't cost you
2868.90s: money in some way you've just
2871.00s: misunderstood the situation
2872.86s: right the next thing I hate
2875.38s: is this risk reward thing the two to one
2878.02s: risk reward or three to one it's a
2880.18s: completely arbitrary thing
2882.10s: it's the sort of thing people will say
2884.02s: well if I make three to one I can't go
2886.84s: bankrupt well I mean you can if you lose
2889.72s: enough times right I mean the three to
2892.18s: one thing is just again
2893.86s: someone just made that up right so
2896.38s: unless you can give me statistics to
2898.24s: show that that has a real basis in
2899.92s: something
2900.82s: that sort of thing makes me sort of
2903.40s: it's a big red flag
2905.32s: finally
2907.06s: there's nothing intrinsically terrible
2908.80s: about using stocks with options I mean
2911.56s: again it's just just because they're
2913.36s: options doesn't mean you can't use
2914.68s: stocks
2917.08s: but the idea of a stop
2919.30s: you're making a big assumption about the
2921.76s: Dynamics of the process
2924.34s: once you've hit a stop you've already
2926.26s: lost money
2927.64s: that money's gone
2929.80s: by doing a stop you're telling me that
2932.56s: because I had lost money in the past I
2934.72s: would now lose money in the future
2936.76s: so you're telling me that there is a
2938.98s: trending process going on otherwise who
2942.52s: cares that you've lost money that's over
2945.18s: do you want to be in the trade now if
2948.58s: you want to be in the trade now stopping
2950.50s: yourself out is the worst thing you can
2952.00s: do it's like you're telling me that if
2955.48s: you just walked in this would be a good
2957.10s: trade but because you've lost some money
2959.56s: you're now going to exit it makes no
2961.30s: sense so
2963.76s: like doing a stop you're implicitly
2967.90s: telling me you're dealing with a
2969.22s: trending system
2970.90s: now maybe you are but maybe you're not
2974.20s: and I think a lot of people
2975.66s: automatically think that this idea of
2978.22s: let your profits around and stop your
2980.08s: losses out is a good thing
2983.62s: the world's way more complicated the
2985.96s: demand if that's how you trade a mean
2987.58s: reverting process it's exactly the wrong
2989.62s: way to do it
2991.00s: if it's a trending process sure but that
2994.66s: should be based on the Dynamics of the
2997.24s: underlying not just some arbitrary rule
2999.22s: you put on top of it
3000.72s: so
3002.82s: this is zero DTE thing they do May well
3006.06s: have Edge
3007.56s: but all of those other things that you
3009.54s: said are big red flags to move
3012.80s: it's interesting because
3015.72s: um yeah I tested them myself for a
3017.94s: little bit out of curiosity and
3020.52s: I found exactly what you would expect
3023.46s: with a strategy like that very high win
3026.46s: rate but the losses were overwhelming
3029.52s: especially in in the long run so that
3032.46s: leads me to I have two final questions
3034.26s: mostly just because I literally could
3036.90s: talk your ear off and I want to respect
3039.12s: your time so the the first to last
3042.06s: question is so when you're trading
3045.00s: things like these
3047.04s: um zero DTE strategies whether it's a
3049.02s: short straddle whatever the case is
3051.78s: um what kind of risk management approach
3054.96s: do you take with those is it primarily
3056.94s: sizing that you think and again this is
3059.28s: thinking just from like the retail
3060.72s: perspective
3062.46s: um do you think sizing is the right
3064.26s: answer there or once things move a
3066.30s: little bit then you start Delta hedging
3069.48s: um the main thing I'm curious is with
3071.10s: like the zero DTE overlay because I
3073.56s: think that's an interesting add-on to
3075.36s: that kind of thought process
3077.76s: yeah I think realistically sizing is the
3080.40s: only thing you can do and it's a very
3083.82s: it's a very poor risk management
3085.56s: technique if you're only trading one
3087.42s: thing
3088.32s: because you have to keep your size so
3091.44s: small that you might not make enough
3092.52s: money to make it worthwhile
3094.38s: and you know the
3096.24s: the most robust trade sizing mechanism
3098.88s: is make enough money
3101.46s: that things are worthwhile doing but if
3104.94s: you lose it shouldn't be overwhelmingly
3107.16s: bad and if you can't find that balance
3110.10s: point you probably shouldn't be doing
3112.26s: that trade
3113.46s: so if you're just trading one thing
3115.98s: that's the problem you're going to run
3118.08s: into
3119.64s: um
3120.36s: I trade Equity options right now I've
3123.18s: probably gone on 300 positions
3126.42s:  I had a I had a stock last week
3129.24s: some piece of Biotech garbage that went
3132.78s: from something like thirty dollars down
3134.46s: to five
3135.60s: oh perfect obviously I lost
3138.72s: I lost literally as much money as that
3140.76s: position could have because it went down
3142.74s: below the cash value
3145.26s: and
3146.76s: but I've got so many positions on that
3148.80s: it took me like 20 minutes to even
3150.72s: notice
3152.10s: I mean once I knew that I'd lost money I
3154.26s: could find out pretty easily why but
3156.60s: honestly it was such a small paper cut
3158.46s: in the big mush of things that were
3160.32s: going on it didn't matter
3161.76s: that's the sort of that's robust I think
3164.34s: risk management
3166.32s: um and that's sort of very difficult for
3168.30s: retail to do
3169.80s: so again if you
3173.40s: this sounds discouraging and it is
3176.28s: but you might just have to accept that
3178.92s: as a retail person you shouldn't be
3181.02s: trading this based on that sizing rule
3184.20s: because that's really the only
3187.86s: it's the only real robust way you're
3190.20s: going to have of making money unless you
3192.54s: price it really well and can tell me you
3195.00s: know I've got five volts of energy out
3196.74s: the money and I'm paying away half of
3198.18s: all of edge in the wings
3200.04s: maybe but if you're paying away the same
3202.74s: amount with all terms on each one long
3204.96s: term it's not going to work is it right
3207.24s: right yeah I think that makes a ton of
3209.28s: sense
3210.12s: last question I have for you is what is
3213.42s: one question I should have asked you but
3215.46s: I didn't
3221.40s: uh I think that's pretty
3223.92s: it's a pretty random question I guess
3227.04s: um
3228.06s: I'm gonna ask you one you're not really
3230.10s: a Corvette family
3232.38s: oh Die Hard Die Hard I have I have uh
3236.52s: 2016 C7 sitting in the garage right now
3239.28s: that I've been building for two years
3241.14s: it's actually funny because the Corvette
3243.54s: is appealing to me I used to restore
3246.12s: cars with my uncle and the first car
3248.34s: that I ever worked on with him was a 64
3251.58s: white Corvette Stingray and it was so
3255.18s: much fun so that's essentially what I
3256.80s: have down there I have a thousand
3258.24s: horsepower Corvette that can't stick on
3260.58s: the road it's perfect
3264.06s: um
3264.96s: okay so I have to say
3267.24s: I think the new Corvette is a real
3269.16s: mishmash ugly thing I think it's all
3271.08s: like a robocar the C7 when it came out
3273.78s: was magnificent right it was like holy
3276.12s: crap what is that
3277.70s: I really think the C3 Corvette might be
3281.04s: one of the best five looking cars ever
3282.72s: made I completely agree it should be
3285.78s: look if that was a Ferrari people would
3288.48s: say it was the best looking car ever but
3290.70s: you know there's a lot of slobbery about
3292.14s: the Corvette um which I just kind of
3294.60s: implicitly
3296.34s: said but I mean I don't hate Corvettes
3299.46s: anyway and literally I think the C4 C3
3301.62s: is gorgeous the problem with them is
3304.08s: they're
3305.34s: you know now 50 year old fiberglass car
3308.46s: you can hear them drive down the street
3310.44s: because of all the squeaks
3312.66s: um they they weren't made brilliantly
3315.90s: when they were made and it was 50 years
3318.54s: ago and fiberglass you know even the
3321.48s: fiberglass Ferraris are pretty messed up
3323.76s: now
3325.82s: you can only get so far with them but I
3328.44s: think you're I completely agree with you
3330.24s: on the ca I get why they did it because
3332.34s: in order to continue competing with the
3334.44s: pool that they want to compete with you
3335.94s: need the mid-engine
3337.74s: um but I'm still more of a purist than
3339.84s: that so I really like the front engine
3342.66s: um I was actually my one of my other
3344.22s: favorite cars is a Dodge Viper uh GTS so
3347.70s: that's like more my general style is
3349.80s: kind of the overt you know V8 V10
3353.22s: American Muscle style I just yeah super
3356.76s: addicted to them they're they're too
3358.02s: much fun between that and I get my
3359.52s: European stuff in the motorcycles like I
3361.26s: just saw the Ducati Monster 1200s one of
3363.48s: my favorite bikes
3365.04s: um so yeah what if dream car anything
3368.10s: you could have what would it be unless
3370.68s: you already have it
3372.66s: no I've got
3375.06s: my car sort of I didn't intend to have a
3378.12s: car collection but when you've got
3379.32s: Italian cars you kind of need a
3380.88s: collection otherwise you don't ever have
3382.44s: a car that works
3384.18s: um
3384.96s: I think dream car I'd probably go for
3387.54s: the Lancia Stratos
3389.96s: again if that is a Ferrari engine if
3393.78s: that was called a Ferrari Stratos that's
3395.40s: a five million dollar car right it's a
3398.88s: real bargain not almost impossible to
3401.04s: drive because I've got like 70 weight on
3403.86s: the rear wheels and they've got a
3406.26s: wheelbase and like this long oh so
3411.30s: it doesn't matter though like I'm gonna
3412.68s: let it get one but they that would be my
3414.48s: dream car I love lancius
3417.06s: I I think they're super cool so I'm
3419.10s: actually really fortunate I live really
3421.44s: close right across actually from me as a
3423.42s: neighborhood called Rancher Santa Fe and
3425.16s: there's a there's a bunch of old rich
3426.72s: people that live in there and they do
3428.10s: like a Carson coffee on the weekend and
3429.90s: they have all sorts of stuff that they
3432.72s: pull out that's a really good time I
3434.40s: don't know if I've seen one of those
3435.60s: there but I I'm not sure that that's
3437.64s: super super common out here is it or
3439.76s: it's not super common anywhere they
3442.08s: probably are yeah
3443.40s: two or three of the road going versions
3445.74s: they were basically a race car or a
3447.42s: rally car got it I mean lancia's used to
3450.60s: just be incredible and now they're just
3452.16s: a badge and low end fierce which is kind
3456.00s: of sad I mean it's a lot of these
3457.80s: Cornwall companies are just Badgers now
3459.60s: citroens are just badges right they used
3462.60s: to be one of the most Innovative
3463.62s: companies in the world so we'll answer
3465.60s: you and Sam Sam doesn't even exist
3467.76s: anymore they were awesome
3469.44s: I I don't know they were they were good
3471.42s: my buddy had one when I was in high
3473.34s: school and he drove me once and had a
3476.46s: moon roof and the moon roof for whatever
3478.74s: reason collected a ton of water and
3481.92s: as soon as he went in reverse all the
3484.50s: water fell straight on my lap right
3486.42s: before school and I was like what the
3488.70s:  is this and he was like oh yeah it
3490.44s: does that sometimes after it rains I was
3492.18s: like oh oh sick love that feature
3495.66s: a bunch of my cars do stuff like that
3498.00s: you've just got to get used to it it's
3499.56s: like
3500.34s: if you can't handle that kind of stuff
3503.76s: I don't know get a Porsche right and you
3507.78s: get a push and you'll have a much more
3509.64s: reliable car and you and
3512.34s: 50 000 other people that I see every
3514.56s: week
3515.40s: you know if you're going to get a 40
3516.78s: year old car you know you accept that
3518.64s: weird things are going to happen that it
3520.80s: comes with the water feature I
3522.18s: completely agree yeah it's totally fair
3525.66s: um cool so we're pretty much at time I
3527.52s: had one last question now that I realize
3529.26s: that you're a bit of a car guy and I'm
3530.88s: I'm curious
3532.20s: I've been to Chicago twice I haven't
3534.90s: been around the area too much is there
3537.36s: like good driving roads there that's
3538.98s: actually one of the things that keeps me
3540.24s: here in San Diego is the Canyons I love
3542.52s: the driving out here but I don't know
3543.96s: what it's like out there it's bad yeah
3547.02s: um there are if you drive like two and a
3550.14s: half hours
3552.32s: of the Mississippi and there were some
3554.40s: nice roads up and down the Mississippi
3557.34s: um but yeah close no in the traffic it
3560.28s: takes you an hour and a half to get out
3561.54s: of Chicago
3562.62s: that's one of the problems so no there's
3566.04s: nothing
3567.18s: nothing good around here nope nope
3570.74s: whenever you whenever you come out to
3572.94s: San Diego we'll we'll take the vet out
3575.16s: and you'll see that it's no slouch and
3577.38s: we'll drive around some of the Canyons
3578.70s: out here I think you would love it it's
3580.20s: very fun I've uh I've driven around San
3584.22s: Diego but that not in a particularly
3587.04s: funny car
3588.24s: yeah well next time you come out this
3590.52s: way we'll we'll change that there's some
3591.84s: really really beautiful roads up here
3593.16s: like up Palomar Mountain out to Big Bear
3595.56s: there's some just gorgeous gorgeous
3597.66s: roads you just have to plan around the
3599.22s: traffic and San Diego over to Palm
3601.38s: Springs is amazing
3602.82s: yeah that's and I mean even that there's
3606.00s: depending on the route you take there's
3607.86s: some cool routes but there's also like
3610.44s: some very boring routes but I think
3612.78s: around Palm Springs there's also some
3614.76s: very fun drives yeah
3617.72s: yeah exactly well it can be terrifying
3621.84s: if this is
3623.52s: yes and especially because most
3625.68s: Californians have some sort of car that
3627.84s: does awful in the snow and they just
3629.28s: come sliding down past you I've had that
3631.20s: happen to me multiple times very
3633.00s: entertaining
3634.38s: it sounds about right yeah well you know
3637.56s: and honestly absolute pleasure to to
3639.60s: chat with you
3640.80s: um I was a big fan before we spoke but
3642.48s: now that I know that you're a car guy
3643.86s: I'm a even bigger fan so sincerely thank
3646.38s: you for taking the time to to chat with
3648.18s: us share some of your knowledge I'd love
3650.34s: to have you back on at some point in
3651.78s: time I I think what you share is
3653.94s: important because you don't sugarcoat
3656.16s: things but you're not like uh a fatalist
3659.52s: or something you know like you give
3660.90s: people I think a very fair Shake of
3663.06s: things and I think that's important one
3665.16s: of my favorite things to to wrap us up
3667.38s: is you know I heard you a lot of people
3669.48s: think like oh my superpower is
3671.40s: discipline and you know you kind of
3673.88s: frame that really well because you say
3676.26s: well if you execute a shitty strategy
3679.32s: not that you said shitty but I'm
3680.94s: paraphrasing
3682.44s: um if you execute a shitty strategy with
3684.84s: utmost discipline the only thing you're
3686.34s: gonna do is lose money slowly and
3688.74s: disciplined you know so that's not like
3691.08s: what's going to get people across the
3692.82s: finish line and I think stuff like that
3694.50s: is really refreshing to hear because
3696.54s: that's more or less I think people need
3698.70s: real information so thank you so much
3700.50s: you know for spending some time and for
3703.02s: people that want to get a hold of you I
3705.00s: will link to your books in the video
3706.86s: description below I like I said I think
3708.54s: they're great reads but where else can
3709.80s: people find you do you have I know
3711.36s: you're on Twitter newsletter or anything
3712.56s: like that
3713.76s: no I'm basically just on Twitter at the
3717.06s: moment
3717.84s: um I have a LinkedIn page but I go to
3719.94s: LinkedIn like I don't know once every
3721.32s: six months
3722.72s: Twitter is the probably the easiest
3724.98s: place and if you can't find me on
3726.48s: Twitter
3727.38s: I mean you're probably not going to
3730.02s: benefit from much from any other advice
3731.76s: if you can't manage to find
3735.12s: fair enough well thank you so much I'll
3737.16s: link to all those in the video
3738.24s: description below and I look forward to
3740.46s: catching up with you again in the future
3741.84s: thanks a lot it was nice talking to you
3743.58s: thanks
