0.00s: What's up outliers?
1.10s: Let's talk about trading options with a $5,000 account.
4.14s: This is a really tricky video because you're going to see a lot of the issues with this.
10.78s: Now, I started with a small account.
12.38s: Most of us do.
13.58s: The problem is most of us start not knowing what we don't know.
17.22s: And I just wrapped up my 18th year of trading and looking back over my trading career thus far,
23.46s: I realized how much risk there is in this process right here.
27.18s: So the goal of this video is to give you an orientation, a framework on how to think about trading options with a $5,000 account
35.34s: so that you have something to show for it at the end.
40.14s: Let's start first with a quick overview.
42.36s: So why do we trade options?
44.34s: They're highly adaptable.
46.94s: That means that you can build positions to represent every permutation of what your idea is.
55.70s: Compare that to equities.
56.86s: You can buy stock.
57.78s: You think it's going to go up.
58.86s: It's essentially going to move dollar for dollar with the underlying and that's it.
61.94s: You just buy it.
62.62s: It goes up.
63.26s: You hope you make money.
64.26s: If it goes down, you lose money.
65.42s: A one-to-one ratio options are different.
67.62s: You can trade options that pay you out a lot of money on a little bit of movement.
73.86s: You can trade options that make money if the market goes sideways.
78.62s: It's completely different.
79.74s: So because of that, they offer a lot of opportunity.
83.82s: Options are also really efficient because they provide leverage.
88.18s: Even if you're selling options, maybe a cash secured put, so you're setting aside money
92.86s: that would be tied to an open trade.
95.46s: You still earn interest on that money that's tied to an open trade that's also earning you a return.
101.30s: So the overall leverage provided combined with the liquidity that it can give you is really attractive.
108.54s: And the last thing that options do is allow you to truly isolate profit mechanisms.
115.34s: And if you're unfamiliar with this concept, I'll throw a link in the description below
118.70s: that talks about profit mechanisms.
120.50s: But the concept here is if I think a stock is going to go up a lot, I can build a specific trade for that.
128.70s: If I think a stock is going to go sideways and I want to trade volatility by itself
135.10s: and remove my exposure to the underlying stock movement, I can do that.
140.14s: You cannot do those kinds of trades with equities.
144.02s: It's just the limitation of the securities themselves options.
147.26s: Grinch you that.
147.94s: So one of the things you'll notice as I'm talking about this stuff is options are complex.
153.62s: This is part of the challenge.
155.42s: These first two points are probably the biggest issues that all new options traders will face.
162.10s: They are really complex and they take a lot of time to learn.
166.62s: But there is a extremely low barrier to entry.
172.02s: What that means is anybody can be an options trader.
175.18s: All you need to do is go to a place like Robin Hood, sign up.
179.26s: They have an app and now you're an options trader.
181.98s: Think of anything else that requires a lot of skill, anything else.
187.26s: Normally there's education, there's exercises, there's projects, there's tests,
194.86s: there's certifying exams before you can actually do the skill set.
199.26s: That's not the case for options.
200.98s: And trading is no less complex than a lot of those other things.
205.86s: There's just not that barrier to entry, which is really confusing to people.
209.18s: Couple that with point number three, which is there is a massive lagged feedback mechanism.
216.50s: So if I'm playing basketball and I shoot a ball, when I shoot the ball, I get immediate feedback.
223.66s: Did it go in the hoop or did it not immediate feedback?
228.46s: And based on the outcome in the hoop or not, I can then conduct a self analysis.
234.74s: Was my elbow tucked in as it should be?
237.14s: Was my forearm straight up?
238.98s: Was I jumping too much at an angle instead of vertical?
242.26s: I can think about all these little things that I have to get right.
246.14s: In order to have a good jump shot, but trading is different.
250.02s: You can be trading a really good strategy and go through a long losing streak just because of the
256.66s: sequence of returns.
258.22s: This is called path or you could be do something completely wrong, abysmally wrong,
263.98s: but you can make money.
265.10s: So then you're being positively conditioned to think you're doing something right,
268.74s: even though you're being tricked again through this idea of path.
273.46s: So not only are you dealing with something that's really complex,
277.22s: there's no certification before you can start or anything to vet your understanding.
281.66s: And it looks like it's really easy to do because of slick internet marketing by people trying to take advantage of you.
287.86s: Couple that with the fact that there's drastically lagged feedback in the systems.
293.58s: That's a recipe for disaster within the first three.
296.22s: We got three more to go.
297.42s: The next thing about trading that makes it so difficult is you have to wear a lot of hats.
302.06s: You have to be risk taker, the person putting on the trade.
305.50s: You have to be risk manager to make sure that the trades make sense.
308.94s: And if you look at something like an investment bank,
310.90s: they literally have entire entities designed to these different tasks.
315.38s: They have researchers that are designed to come up with the ideas and then the traders that are meant to execute them.
320.70s: And then a risk management desk that makes sure that what all the traders are doing makes sense together,
325.30s: you have to do all of that.
326.62s: And you have to be super self aware.
328.78s: You essentially have to be your own psychologist to identify all of the small little quirks.
333.42s: We all have his humans.
334.38s: So add that onto the bucket.
336.02s: Then going back to that really slick internet marketing stuff like this,
341.54s: these kinds of things are so dangerous.
343.62s: Now I'm in an incognito tab on Chrome.
346.46s: So it's not skewed by anything that I typically would look at.
349.62s: And after scrolling a little bit,
350.98s: and this is no dig at any of these people.
353.38s: I'm just talking about the marketing, which is this options trading in 10 minutes.
358.10s: How to make a thousand dollar a day at 19 for beginners.
361.14s: What does that prime you to do mentally?
363.46s: Right?
363.86s: That's completely picking you.
366.14s: The next thing, $4,000 in 10 minutes,
369.62s: not saying that this person did or didn't make $4,000 in 10 minutes is absolutely possible and doable for sure.
375.50s: But for new traders, especially with small accounts,
378.26s: this sets you up for the entire wrong mindset coming into this thing going all the way back to this.
385.42s: We think we're going to turn a small amount of money into a bunch of money.
388.18s: And then the last thing, lack of structure.
390.26s: Anybody that follows my work,
391.90s: you know that I am an evangelist for things like trading plans,
396.42s: trading logs, all even throw a video about them below.
399.58s: But we're trading things that are really complex that have lagged feedback that there's a really misleading low barrier to entry.
408.54s: So we think it's going to be much easier than it is.
410.82s: There's a lot of different tasks we have to perform.
413.70s: Most people don't track anything they do.
416.22s: And then they're wondering why it doesn't work.
418.10s: You have to track what you're doing.
420.22s: Otherwise, how on earth would you think that this is going to work?
424.38s: Again, it's because you're primed in a really unhealthy way by people trying to essentially just bait your eyeballs to get you to click on stuff or their own growth.
434.54s: And it's unfortunate, but it's the reality.
436.70s: Let's take a look at a couple studies and I recommend you check these out.
441.06s: So this one is about the performance of different kinds of options traders.
445.38s: This one talks about retail options trading.
447.46s: This one talks about risk premium in the markets.
450.90s: The reason why these studies are relevant to you is because if you want to be an option trader,
456.78s: you have to understand the place that you're operating.
459.94s: You have to understand the tools.
461.50s: You have to understand the landscape.
463.02s: It's the same thing is going back to the basketball example.
465.38s: If you want to be a basketball player, you have to understand the positions.
467.62s: You have to understand different plays.
469.06s: You have to understand offense and defense.
471.02s: You have to understand positioning.
472.30s: All of those things apply here.
473.62s: Again, the difference is is nobody's going to tell you any of it.
476.70s: You have to figure it out because it's all on you.
479.62s: You are a one man or woman band out there doing it all by yourself.
485.14s: You don't have a coach that's telling you do this.
487.34s: Do that.
487.90s: It's you.
488.62s: You are the coach.
489.70s: You're also the player.
490.86s: That is what makes it so tricky.
492.90s: Okay.
493.18s: So now that we understand trading options is tricky.
496.46s: That is just the nature of this thing.
498.46s: I now want to talk about some goals for a small account.
502.50s: What are things to focus on that are a good use of your time?
506.22s: The first one is to focus on saving.
508.42s: I know this isn't about trading at all.
510.18s: Here's the reality.
511.34s: The probability of you turning a $5,000 account into your future wealth is about zero.
518.02s: It's not zero.
519.38s: It could be done.
520.86s: But the probability of that happening is really freaking low.
525.26s: So in the beginning with small accounts, you have to focus on saving because let me show
531.06s: you something.
532.06s: If we take a look at two accounts as an example, we have a $5,000 account of $5,000,000
536.30s: account.
537.30s: If we save $1,000, that $5,000 account just grew by 20%.
543.18s: Just by saving $1,000 with a small account, your savings have an outstanding impact on your
551.02s: overall principle.
552.42s: On a $5,000,000 account, you save that $1,000, you just grew by 0.02%.
557.98s: What ends up happening is when your account gets bigger and bigger, your returns start to
563.10s: matter more than your savings.
565.54s: With a small account, it's the inverse.
568.22s: Your savings will matter so much more than your returns.
573.42s: When you compare these on a return basis, if you get a 10% return on this $5,000 account,
580.18s: you get $500,000, you get a 10% return on a $5,000,000 account, you have $500,000, same
585.40s: return.
586.40s: Notice how different that is.
587.40s: In the beginning, small accounts must save.
589.82s: Towards the end, when you have a more developed account, your return matters so much more.
594.90s: Just keep that in mind.
595.90s: So we have to save.
596.90s: Alright, that's stuff aside.
598.22s: Let's actually talk about this.
599.70s: The next thing is, I already explained that this is kind of difficult.
602.70s: This is not easy.
603.70s: It's not what it's made out to be.
604.70s: It's going to take a lot of effort just like getting good at anything else.
607.58s: You have a choice.
608.58s: Either do it or don't do it.
610.06s: But does not work well is kind of half-assing it.
612.74s: Seeing it like maybe you're the next savant that's just going to pick it up and be supremely
616.78s: good at trading.
617.78s: It could happen, but it's unlikely.
619.58s: So you either make the choice to do it and you accept that it's going to be a lot of
624.22s: work.
625.22s: It's going to be frustrating.
626.22s: It's going to take a lot of time and effort to learn this thing and that's great because
629.34s: trading in my opinion is entirely worth it.
632.42s: But what will screw you up the most is if you go into it half-assed, you trade a little
637.38s: bit, you start losing a bunch of money that could have been compounding in a buy and
641.54s: hold index ETF that works well for most people long-term.
645.50s: It's just a waste of time and you'll have little to show for it.
648.02s: So either commit or don't.
650.86s: This isn't something to kind of do kind of not.
653.78s: Make the choice.
654.78s: Your first goal is to learn options.
658.18s: Notice how I don't say your first goal is to return 10%, 5%, 20%, 50%, that's not
663.54s: your goal.
664.54s: You don't even get to have that goal yet because you have to learn the skill set.
667.82s: The only way you can learn the skill set is if you focus on learning versus the returns.
672.46s: You need to build an approach that's part of learning.
676.06s: We're going to prioritize the process of trading because again, going back to this example.
682.74s: If we have that 10% return, 10% on $5,000 is very unappealing.
689.54s: $500 bucks, who really cares.
691.78s: But if you're able to maintain a 10% return every single year without missing a single
697.54s: year, that all of a sudden becomes really meaningful when you're able to give yourself
703.02s: half a million dollars after you continue to save really aggressively, don't have any
708.10s: losing years and scale really effectively.
711.62s: So that's why we care about prioritizing the processes because again, when you're trading
715.86s: a $5,000 account, it's not about the $5,000 you're learning.
719.94s: Next up, you got to track your work.
721.22s: We already talked about that.
722.22s: This is a great time to test ideas, both via paper trading and live trading.
726.22s: You want to limit drawdowns.
728.26s: Drawdowns are going to happen, but with small accounts, they're a killer because they require
733.42s: a much larger percent to get back to break even.
737.90s: If you pop over to my website, I have a display built for this.
741.90s: It's under resources and down here under volatility decay and loss recovery chart.
745.82s: If you take a look at the loss recovery chart, if you with your $5,000 account,
749.90s: if you draw it down by 25%, you now need a 33.3% return to get back to break even.
757.14s: You've made $0 in this case.
758.66s: You've actually still would have lost money once you include friction meaning fees.
763.06s: But what I'm showing you is that the more you draw down, the bigger return you need
767.30s: to literally get back to break even.
770.34s: You have to avoid that.
771.62s: And again, going back to exhibit A, we're not trying to grow this into our future wealth.
776.06s: We're trying to build a skill set that's sustainable that when coupled with aggressively
781.26s: saving, growing our income will yield future wealth.
785.78s: Last thing, focus on learning already, belabor that point enough.
788.86s: All right, let's now talk about some strategies.
791.86s: The first thing is you do need to outline profit mechanisms.
795.02s: Again, you can check out that video below, but this is just to clearly identify what
799.62s: you're trying to trade.
800.62s: Are you going to try to trade directionally?
802.02s: Are you going to try to trade long term strategies short term strategies value?
805.38s: It's all up to you, but you have to define it and have a sense of what you're trying
809.58s: to do.
810.58s: Risk management is going to be super important.
811.86s: The way that we avoid those draw downs is by managing risk.
815.54s: And there are a few things you can do to completely revolutionize your trading.
819.74s: In a few simple steps, it sounds like gimmicky, but it is the absolute honest truth.
824.22s: I'll throw a link in the notes below about a few simple things you can do.
828.30s: But one of them is every single trade from now on forever.
833.10s: Before you enter, you define your exit points before you enter.
838.30s: So for a $5,000 account, you're naturally going to be oversized.
841.34s: You can't avoid it.
842.34s: But we don't want to have a 10% drawdown on an individual position.
846.46s: That's just too much money.
848.38s: So you can think about things maybe 5% drawdown.
851.90s: And even that for a developed account for a big account, that's a lot.
855.10s: On a seven figure account, you're way more looking at typically things like half a percent
859.66s: to maybe 2%.
860.66s: It obviously depends on your approach and your strategy, but you have to balance it
865.22s: with expected return allocation utilization.
867.86s: This is a way that I think about using a portfolio.
870.78s: Again, I'll throw a link to this in the notes below.
873.62s: Allocation is how much money you're going to use at a given point in time for a strategy.
877.82s: And utilization is how much you're actually using at a given point in time.
881.26s: With a $5,000 account, you have to be very, very cautious with this because you're going
885.74s: to have to essentially use most of the portfolio almost all the time.
889.26s: But you have to pay close attention to the portfolio structure.
892.66s: What that means is we don't want a bunch of trades that are mirroring one another.
896.90s: So let's say if you're able to put on 5 trades that are at a $1,000 capital utilization
901.82s: each, well, if they all behave as the same thing, maybe they're all in tech.
906.62s: Well, if tech goes down, your portfolio structure is trash.
910.66s: You have no diversification within them and your probability of blowing up is big.
915.14s: We have to balance our return expectations for smaller accounts.
919.54s: It's typically best to focus on percents.
922.10s: The reason again for this is going off of what I showed you here.
927.22s: 10% return is pretty solid.
929.74s: The $500 is trivial.
931.50s: That's not exciting.
932.50s: So focusing on the percent return is a little bit better.
934.90s: When you have a bigger account, we generally use both, but focusing on the dollar amount
939.86s: starts to make more sense because it's less about what the percent is and it's more about
943.86s: how much income do I get?
945.70s: What am I spending this month or this year and how much am I putting back?
949.50s: So we have been flow between these, but just for your context, ticker selection is going
954.06s: to be challenging.
955.34s: One of the things that I do is use scanners.
959.18s: So in this example, I'm using bar chart and you can go in and limit your tickers.
963.78s: I'm using things that are optionable that have gone up over a time frame, but they're
967.86s: trading at $15 or less.
970.34s: The reason being is because I want to be able to put on a few trades.
974.34s: If you're trading things that are too expensive, you've run out of choices, strategies, vertical
979.14s: spreads, ratio diagonals, covered strangles and single options, single options kind of
984.90s: bubbles up under ratio diagonals.
987.22s: Let's first start with verticals.
989.42s: We're going to go over to the platform and let's say after going through a scan, you
995.02s: come across soundhound and you're like, oh, I think that this is interesting.
998.74s: They're getting involved in AI.
1000.26s: I think there's a future here.
1001.54s: Now, it's rolling over right now, but let's just use it for an example.
1004.66s: It's a $18 stock.
1006.42s: The first thing you could do is trade verticals.
1009.22s: You can go long or short them depending on what you want.
1012.94s: I'm not a big fan of verticals, but we can look at one.
1015.70s: So let's say you think it's going to go up.
1017.50s: So we're going to look at selling a put vertical.
1020.66s: So it's a dollar wide.
1021.98s: Why does this matter?
1022.98s: Well, verticals give you access to a lot more tickers that are more expensive.
1027.46s: It's because the width of the spread becomes how much money you need essentially.
1034.30s: So in this case, you stand to make what, $59, risking 41, that's actually really good.
1039.82s: Typically, it's going to be way less than that.
1041.82s: But this can give you access to much more expensive tickers because again, you determine
1048.30s: the risk by the width of the spread.
1050.78s: So let's use Apple for an example.
1053.86s: Because if we come in here, we take a look at the same 45 DTE and these are automatically
1060.14s: $5 wide.
1061.14s: But let's take a look because it's a $242 stock.
1065.14s: If we put on a single $5 wide spread in here, let's get rid of this old example, you're
1071.06s: risking 365.
1072.50s: That falls closer to our risk profile.
1075.70s: Again, that's a little too high.
1077.38s: We don't want to be at 10% almost.
1079.42s: We want to be closer to 5% at the max, but just showing you that using a vertical can
1084.82s: get you into much more expensive underlines.
1087.38s: The way I think about verticals is that there are a way to learn.
1090.86s: That's not really the strategy I would try to use longer term.
1095.38s: The ideal strategy that I used when I did a small stack segment not too long ago, using
1101.42s: a $5,000 account was ratio call diagonals.
1104.54s: I'll throw a link to those in the notes below.
1107.94s: But this is where we go out.
1109.18s: I would probably use something like a 90 day diagonal.
1112.70s: It would be actively managed and I'm using the long option as the equity.
1120.62s: You can see that this trade takes 485.
1124.46s: The thing is I'm not going to risk all of that.
1127.02s: I'm going to plan to manage this trade.
1129.14s: What I mean by that is I'm going to apply my technical analysis and I'm going to say,
1133.06s: well, if soundhound drops below 1685, I'm wrong.
1137.62s: It's continued to gone down too far and I wouldn't want to get in it.
1141.94s: Just for an admin, no, I wouldn't get in here.
1143.78s: I'd wait until it bases.
1145.58s: Let's say maybe I had gotten in here or something.
1148.42s: What I'm going to do is I'm going to see what my risk is here.
1151.30s: Let's just call the risk at 17.
1153.26s: If we go in here and we take a look at $17, my risk is about $55.
1158.78s: That's well within my risk tolerance.
1160.22s: I actually can put another one of these on.
1163.34s: This is the difference between allocation utilization here.
1167.02s: In order to buy these two, I'm going to use $970.
1171.14s: I'm using a fifth of the portfolio putting on this one trade.
1174.30s: In terms of actual risk, I'm risking about $100.
1178.10s: That's well within risk tolerance.
1180.46s: I can come in and I can sell calls against it if I'm inclined to try to offset some of
1186.82s: the theta.
1187.82s: You can check out the video on diagonals.
1189.86s: You can trade ratio diagonals both to the upside and to the downside.
1194.26s: Coverage strangles are really difficult to do in here, but they're better suited for
1198.02s: long term holdings.
1200.42s: But again, with a $5,000 account in order to trade the coverage strangle, you have to be
1204.06s: able to buy more than 100 shares.
1206.38s: That means you're essentially going to have to be trading $56, $7 stock at the most.
1210.66s: You're going to be kind of stock.
1212.50s: The last one is long singles, which essentially, again, I would trade them just like I trade
1217.50s: the ratio diagonals.
1218.74s: I just wouldn't add the short leg element.
1222.74s: This is trading option with the $5,000 account.
1224.86s: It's doable.
1225.86s: It's real tricky.
1227.10s: If you want to see a follow-up video that goes through these with actual examples for
1231.10s: a 5K account, let me know.
1232.38s: We could do a follow-up.
1233.38s: If you have any questions, let me know.
1234.82s: Be an outlier.
1235.82s: I'll see you later.
