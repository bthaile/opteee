 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you You the means is it is punching way above its way class with respect to just what it's driving in the broader portfolio. And I just found that actually pretty interesting because it highlights how much volatility is in GameStop for sure and how tradable that volatility is, especially because you'll see on the main chart here, it's been fairly range bound for some time now. It's really been dominantly sideways. I think it's pretty fair to say. So thought that was humorous. We have the the lightest allocation essentially performing the second best. Maybe I was literally sitting there saying, and maybe that means I might need to move a little bit more capital into it now for the coverage strangle that I'm sharing in the sample portfolio. The original idea behind that was allocating $25,000. And the concept was I wanted to trade something that is similar to what other people might have access to trade in a normal portfolio, specifically for this community. So if I do scale it up, it would be in the main portfolio. Now that being said, if we wanted to scale up the community position that I'm trading, then I'm happy to do that. I just don't want to sabotage the original purpose simply because it's performing well. And I'm probably going to put more money into it. So something to chew on. You can let me know if you have a preference there. But before we get started, I would like to hear from you. If there's any new news, any new theories, any new pieces of information related to GameStop that I should be aware of or that we should take a look at. I have to be completely up front. I have not gone through Superstank in quite a while. And I've been working on a bunch of other projects and stuff. So I just haven't had a ton of time in order to spend working on this. So I was going to start there just scrolling through really quick to see if anything looks topical. But so far there hasn't, yeah, there really hasn't been a tremendous amount that's crossed my desk. But as always, please let me know if there's something that we should take a look at. So we got dark mark Reese Powell. Sounds like going to go slay some pow some fresh pow good. Ben Joe, good to see you as well. Powell says, I want to understand why your positions have a 45 day expert. People talk me about going week to week when IV is low. With what position are you referring to? Because that will have that will have a differentiation. So let's scroll through. I'm going to sort this and we do like top by different time frames. Yeah, here we go. I'm just going to look over the last month and see what's highlighting covered calls. I really don't have a 45 day expert for covered calls. If you're talking about like a specific position that I've recently shared now, then I just need to know which one you're talking about. But that's not like a set thing that I will do writ large always. That's why I'm just trying to understand the context of what you're looking at. All right, so this one OG apes. This one is just game stop being up. Okay. Let's see what you guys want to see with. I kind of want to see what this one is. Group of fellow GME enthusiasts, myself taking deep into swaps, particularly UBS. They're trying to wiggle, wriggle their way out of having to follow any rules regarding the maintenance and closing of legacy bags. That's interesting. If true. So UTC staff issues, no action letter regarding merger of UBS, group and credit suites. We'll not recommend to the commission taking enforcement action against certain of UBS, London's branch swapped the other counterparties for their failure to comply with the CFTC's unclear swap margin requirements for such transferred swaps. ECR will not recommend to the commission taking enforcement action against UBS for their food to comply with the CFT swaps clearing requirements for such transferred swaps. Okay. So I have a lot of questions. The first question is, how are we tying to their failure to comply on unclear swap margin requirements and swap clearing requirements with closing of legacy positions? So let's see, let's see what, let's see what this might be. So I'm going to chat you PT and as you know, chat you PT is the dog. So let's see what it says. Explain the latest EC notice regarding UBS issue of no action letter regarding the merger with credit's lease from 15 April. Let's see what that is. I don't know much, but I'm quite, I'm quite interested in what this is. So let's see. On April 15, CFTC, I should know action letter in response to a request from UBS AG pertains to the transfer of certain legacy swap contracts from credit suiis to UBS London following the merger in March of 23 suiis, face significant distress, completed in June of 23. This is exceeding to all assets liabilities, part of the integration, initiated the wind down of CSI and sought to transfer CSI's trading assets liabilities, including legacy swaps to UBS AG London branch. This transfer was executed in a court sanctioned business transfer scheme. The transfer swap to his legacy subs were entered into before the relevant compliance dates for the CFC swap clearing and unclaring swap margin requirements, therefore, we're not subject to these requirements prior to the transfer. See, this is one of my minor frustrations, because when I go through these, what ends up happening is people are looking at this and they're simply saying what's being said about the big bank and the perspective of just here, dislike and distrust of large institutions, which again, I do not blame, but it starts to confound our ability to objectively reason, because effectively, what this is saying is that they moved those assets sooner rather than later and they weren't required to comply with these. So that coming out to me just seems to make sense and it's actually contrary to this idea of currently trying to wriggle out of having to follow any rules. Literally, what this is telling us based on a cursory overview is that those swaps first were being transferred before the compliance dates. So it's not that they were like trying to make them go away, they transferred them early, but then also, they weren't required to the requirements prior to the transfer. So here we go. The issuance of the Nino Action Letter sparked criticism for some market participants and observers. Concerns have been raised that granting such relief may set a precedent, allowing large financial institutions to circumvent regulatory requirements, potentially undermining the integrity of the regulatory framework established after the OA crisis critics argue that this could encourage excessive risk taking in a road market discipline. That's a fantastic point. And that makes me feel a little bit different. I still think that this part of like trying to wriggle out of the positions is different than what this is saying in terms of moving risk ahead of the regulatory window, but I do agree with that. I think based on what this is explaining to me that that's kind of nonsense. So evaluate the criticism from market participants and observers. What elements have merit? What elements do not do it? It says I didn't talk to you, Siri Chil. Moral hazard concerns. I agree with this. Rule integrity erosion. I agree with this. Counterpoint, limited scope relief applies only to legacy swaps entered in prior to the compliance dates. These are not new or risky trades and it's administrative transfer under a court supervised merger. This wasn't a backroom deal. Part of a formal legally binding UK parts, seven transfer vetted by financial regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. Okay. Allows them to dodge margin and clearing rules. So they were imposed for a reason, unequal cost of capital, only applies to the legacy positions and its systematics stability trade off forcing repapering, margining or clearing of these trades could risk disorderly unwine near mispricing, which might introduce new systemic risks exactly what the merger was intended to avoid. Serious. She'll lend him from consequences of bad decisions. I agree with that definitely on the part of Credit Suisse for sure. And then also from a market fairness lens, that's very onion. I think that's completely true. This I think is a really important point as well. So for those that don't know, UBS's acquisition, it wasn't like a massive play because they were stoked on it, although I'm sure that there are elements that they were stoked on. So yeah, I mean, I think from a precedent risk perspective that this is important. So I think granting too many exceptions unless they're warranted by some sort of specific reason starts to set a terrible precedent. The one reason that I do believe is, again, pertinent here is this. So the fact that it was a government forced acquisition is a different precedent, right? Because UBS is already getting put into this equation not fully under their own volition. A bypass margin clearing rules. This I think is a terrible weakness in terms of the concern, like just because they're not subject to the rules, I think it's bullshit. They should be. Especially with, as we've seen, how black box swaps have been. This is one of the things when I talk with Newton about his analysis of them and how difficult it is to really conclude anything from them. And it's for the reasons that I shared with him and then also with the rest of the group with respect to the fact that swaps are essentially, you can't see into them. We don't really know what's in them. And that part, I don't really love. It's a really tricky game because I'm not positive that all of that should be publicly available at all times. But I don't see why the components of a swap wouldn't be part of regular filings on a periodic cadence, just like all other holdings. Like to me, that seems reasonable. But the funny thing too is with Trump in office now, it does seem like the regulatory landscape is likely to change quite a lot. And it's because Trump is obviously in favor of deregulation for the banks. So it begs the question of what kind of progress you might see for anything like this, which let's not dive too far into the political political debate potential. But let's focus on something as simple as naked shorting. Remember when we watched that little bit of a video a long time ago, maybe a month or two ago, about GameStop in the naked shorting where Susan Trimbath was in there. Well, if you remember, that stuff literally was from over a decade ago, like two decades ago. And we're still talking about the very same naked shorting conversation. So that tells you a lot. And that tells you that it's a bipartisan oversight in that neither what no party has moved to actually address something like that. So the financial industry is kind of weird in that way. They do get, they do get to fly a little bit under the radar and some of this stuff. So I agree with that. We truly care about that saga. You know that this is the moment we've been waiting for this confirmation that there exists some legacy short problem. Again, this this doesn't confirm that to be clear. It doesn't it doesn't confirm that there's a legacy short problem. We're making way too many jumps here. We're saying legacy shorts. We don't know that they're shorts and problem. We have no idea. This doesn't look like there's a problem to me. This just looks like a transfer of assets that fell outside of a regulatory window, which probably should have been within the regulatory window. Let's be honest. But to jump to this again, I think is a bit of a leap. We've long examined that banks began reporting massive losses January of 21. Time to be vocal. In that part, I actually I don't feel any type of way about like go for it. The the more attention that gets drawn to this, the better. The one thing that I will always remind organizers if whoever organized this, father of lies. If father of lies ever watches any of my videos or catches this, if one of you sends this to him, the thing that I would remind somebody like him on or them, I should say, because I don't know if it's him, is that you have to be really you have to view human capital carefully. Because when people first see something that they don't like, a lot of times they're very willing to act and do something. One of the problems with financial reform is that it is so slow and it takes so long to actually accomplish something. So I would view the calls to action for stuff like this, which this is completely fine. But I would just be very methodical about the stuff that you really try to draw the community to focus on. Because if that happens too much with too many issues with too many people, you start to lose that drive from the community versus showing in like highlighting things that we really think matter, which this might be it. I'm just saying a general thing that I've seen across when I go through Superstong is that it can become slightly draining, I think, for the casual participant, there are the same I casual participant. Press release, when filing the complaints, it should be worth noting that it's regarding the press release about CFTC staff letter, complaint form. Yeah, cool. I mean, I think it's cool. This again, I'm not really positive that this is them trying to sweep something under the rug. But I do think making that move me outside the regulatory window also shouldn't happen. So yeah, I think that that's, I think that's legit. Okay. We already know this. In case you guys didn't see what the latest on this whole tariff thing, which is really interesting. Japan yesterday, they came off the top rope or it might have been this morning. Well, it would have been last night, but they were saying that with these tariff negotiations with the US that they're considering the trillion in US debt that they hold. So essentially it's a country level bond vigilante move, which is awesome. It's just awesome for the plot. It's a terrible negotiating scenario, not just from Japan, by the way, also with the way that the US did all this shit. It's just terrible because everybody has their fucking knives out, but it's fantastic for the plot. All right. What is this? Kat Errors set eventually released by Finra. Let's ask GPT about that. You summarize the latest CT errors. I don't know when the latest report was. This is from like two weeks ago. Explain the context of why they most often occur. And the drivers of why. All right. Let's see what this is. So like this here, right? This says Kat Error data set released by Finra, which is good. I like this. But if we look at the actual errors here, most of them are just late. I would be way more concerned with the ones that are processed and not accepted, which is obviously a subset of this, right? So you can see what is this? Damn, that's a lot of damn, that's a lot of 60 billion. Let's just give it to the 60 billion, but let's take a look here. 392 million, 382 million, right? Like that, that I think is bad. When there's that big of a variance between what was processed versus accepted, that to me is sketchy. The shit that's late, I'm going to ask chat GPT because I honestly don't know the main reasons why they might be late. We'll find that out in a second. But this doesn't draw my immediate attention as much, but let's see. Late, 10 April error counts escalate over 23 million. Okay. Data ingestion errors, linkage errors, late reporting. This is the one I want to know. So of the common causes of CAT errors, what might the incentives be for the reporting entity to report late, submit incomplete reports for failure to report errors? Underlying drivers, complex reporting requirements, which I do believe is fair system integration challenges. This seems like it shouldn't be a thing forever or this should be the kind of thing that should be infrequent where it becomes an issue versus where it doesn't. And I really do have sympathy for this. The reason being is if you look at the size of the data that's moving, right? I mean, it's massive. It's billions of data points moving, multi-component data points for that matter. And even when I worked at Deloitte, we would regularly see integrations between different systems, even within house in the same company. But if there's an update or a change or something applied to one, it can then break the other. And there are a ton of changes that are ongoing for maintenance of the systems. That's like a very simplistic example for this. But I could see how this genuinely could happen without nefarious intent, which is what I'm going to ask Chattach PtNax, though, is what kind of instances might we see nefarious intent. But this I do feel for. Anytime I see this kind of volume of shit moving, regardless of what it is, even if it's super simple line items, the first thing that comes to my mind is error prone. Even if this isn't going between entities within specific reporting requirements or complex reporting. Reliance third party vendors. So now there's a third party, which is even more difficult lack of robust supervisory procedures and controls of reporting process, contributes to persistent errors. This makes sense. Why would this happen in your guys' opinion? I have an opinion on this one pretty clearly, but I want to know what you guys think. Why would there be an inadequate amount of supervision? And again, as always, I encourage you to approach the conversation here. Even there's a broader lens. While we're talking about a scenario that directly impacts in this context game stop, the stuff that we're covering here really talks about broader game theory, incentives and things of that nature. Because to me, there's a couple really clear line items attached to this. One of them from my opinion is in the military, we use inspect what you expect. And depending on what the punishment is, what people are willing to do to avoid that punishment varies a lot. If there's something that somebody wants to do and the punishment is relatively light, then you just deal with the punishment. You don't care that much because the incentive isn't strong enough to dissuade you from doing whatever that thing is. However, great example, drinking, drinking in the Marine Corps. Big problem. We were raised in a fucking pub in a tavern. So comes with the territory, but Marines making terrible choices while they're drinking becomes a problem and it becomes a force readiness issue literally. So when that, when the Marine Corps decided as an institution to start tamping those downs, the punishments were drinking related incidents got way more severe. And what do you think happened? The number of incidents started plummeting because then people are saying, well, instead of just getting an extra duty, if I get a dy extra duty for a month or whatever kind of sucks, but whatever. Now it's literally you might be fucking kicked out of the Marine Corps. That's a different story. Then it's like, fuck, that's literally just not worth it. And it makes the calculus easier. So in my opinion, a big part of the reason why there's an inadequate amount of supervision is because the stick is not big enough and they don't fucking care. Here's something I would near guarantee you. If there was in excess of a certain amount of errors, if the CEO of the institution got zero dollars that year for their pay, how many errors do you think there would be? Probably very fucking few that are not genuinely attributable to something outside of their power. Probably not. Now I'm not advocating for something like that because it's really, really extreme. But it's again, talking about this overarching decoupling and the distance between regulatory punitive actions and then the incentive structure it creates. This is literally saying we do not fucking care and why would they? They're not made to care. So they're going to focus about the shit that they think is more worth their time to care about. All right, so let's see potential incentives, delay, trade transparency, obscure certain trading behavior, particularly those related to proprietary strategies, large directional positions that could move the market if visible too soon. Maybe by time to clean records, this I think could be volume smoothing maybe reduced regulatory attention. Well, this seems like it's the opposite now where they're getting more attention, but I could see why they might be trying to hide things. While intentional omission is rare due to audit trails and vendor oversight, the incentive to lose detail increases with perceived enforcement weakness or delays in cat recognition audits. Exactly, literally exactly what we just fucking talked about. Right here. The firm perceives cat compliance as low risk. Yeah, I think that that's exactly correct. Interesting. There's within six days. C plus 35. Is that the latest? What creates a comprehensive list of all the game stop related cycle theories? sample E plus 35. E plus 35 FTD cycle. This theory causes it's significant price moving, game stop occur, approximately 35 trading days after a spike in FTDs. The study published by a check journal economics found consistent cycles ETF FTDs affecting game stops price around T35. T21 standard settlement for some securities 13. 13. 90 1335. Okay. Complete submission, failure to report. Yep, so we talked about this. Basically almost entirely preventable. No, I don't think that that's fair. I don't think that's fair at all. I think let's see. Break down the likely percentage of causes of the total amount of CAT errors found. My guess is system integration issues is probably a bigger, a bigger than saying something like it's almost completely. Yeah, exactly. This and again, this is in I don't by the way, let's take a giant step back as I'm going through this. When I'm looking and using chat GPT, I do not take chat GPT at face value at all. This it's the same thing is finding something in a Google search. I do not take it at face value. I always apply just the broader lens that I have as a market participant and just a thinker. Now, if you'll notice before this result was even out, my instincts would tell me, based on what we talked about before, that this would be a primary driver very likely. So when I saw this, I don't think of it as, yeah, it's definitely 40 to 50%. I don't know that. But I still absolutely this bolsters that idea that it's very likely a primary driver. Again, anybody that's worked with any sort of tech integration, if you worked as a consultant with these kinds of things, you literally will see this shit all the time. So I don't think that this is accurate at all. Like almost entirely preventable. I literally think it's the inverse that the majority of it is probably driven by linkage errors of some sort that might put them outside. Later's report just came out. Second half, the reporting period after the Trump terrorist came out. Right. So like this to me makes it ton of sense. When you see, let me just came up to my house. When you see this kind of like market activity, when Trump terrorist came out, just about everything when haywire. So you have to look at it from the lens of the places that are trying to run their business. So this wouldn't surprise me at all that I believe would just check out. So it's interesting. I'm really glad that we're actually seeing this documentation finally, and we can see the numbers. I think that getting a more granular view on this essentially creating a pie chart similar to this would be so insightful to understand how much of it is coming from things like linkage errors versus literally chosen late reporting or incomplete submissions or repair errors. Like because this is still a pretty decent size bucket, right? Like even if you take the low end, it's at least 25% probably of the total instances. So that matters actually like that's not like an insignificant bucket at all. Alan a tall bot. What is this? Jimmy Citadel 2024 filing. Oh, this looks interesting. So this for those that don't know the concept of notional value, we use this in options trading all the time. It's literally the same exact idea. Swaps are just another derivative. So the whole point of notional value is it's providing access to a leveraged position again, just like with options. If you sell a naked short put and the stock is $100, well, you don't have to put up the total amount of cash to cash secure the hundred shares that you might have to buy at whatever your strike prices. What this is saying is that swaps follow the same general concept where they have access to significance amounts of leverage. So that matters a lot because one, it increases capital efficiency. So it becomes very attractive. That's again, why a lot of more professional levered or more professional level traders do move into things like options. This is a notable component of it. It's for leverage. It's for capital efficiency. It's not if you have a small account, you can't afford it. That's part of it for smaller accounts, but even bigger accounts. It's not that you can't afford the underlying position that you can be way more tactical with how you're using your money. Michael says, can we talk about hood has more upside. Yeah, we could take a look at that at the end. I'm going to focus on GameStop for now. The Jean says got some Jimmy Weekly's monthly when IV was 58. That sucks. Depending on what monthly you're in, that is sub-optimal. So why does Citadel's 923 Billy Mountain matter? It shows massive interest rate exposure. Yes. That's true. That's completely true. So I assume this point is understood if it's not let me know, but this is a really important point. It's almost the same weapon that's being used right now by Japan with the terror of negotiations that we talked about before. It's very similar to that. Huge leverage. That's correct. Labeled in millions at this time. Okay. 944 billion, notional value means that Citadel's exposed to contracts based on that amount, not that they owe it. Okay. They only show 6.5 billion assets, 4.7 billion liabilities, so net positive 1.8 or just 24 million net after offsetting. Okay. Yes. Yes. Also, who? Then I found something weird on Superstung Search in this. 18 Citadel reported 11.3 Billy in total exchange traded derivative assets. Then 2019 9.7 Billy 2020. 33 Bill, big red flag. 2021. There's no millions labels on this table yet. It matches the format of every year prior of that's millions 2.3 trillion. Yeah. I would assume that that's trillion for sure. Yeah. I definitely. Okay. OTC cleared no millions 9.5 trillion total derivatives. 6.7 billion. That's a fucking interesting question, right? This question, by the way, why would millions go away and come back? Why would that? That's incredibly sketchy. Because again, going back to even when I was a consultant with the Lloyd, when you're preparing these kinds of documents, it is with very, very deep care that you put them together. So the fact that this might be, you know, lazily put together, I doubt that. So that seems quite purposeful in my opinion. Can't prove it. It's a it is a complete gas on my end, but that's what I believe based on again, just generally thinking about it. Up. There you go. See, I'll talk about same page completely agree with this. Yep. Again, I don't go as far as to say definitely intentional. I'm very against stuff like that just because it's being objective is so valuable in my opinion. But I for me, I would absolutely say something like this was very likely intentional because I do think that. Not debt, not in solving 9.44 billion of interest rate bets in the middle of a bond market unwind. It's not nothing. Very interesting. Very, very interesting. Let me look at on. This is the right one. On. Come. Very interesting. When was this? I want to ask him about it. 21 days ago. I'm going to hit him up really quick. Quick. Quick question on the Citadel. So go up dealer filings,aign review it across them. OV Stream If follow up on what your general thoughts are on the driver, explain. Very, very interesting. So I am curious. What I want to know is based on what he saw, if there's any specific drivers that he's thinking behind it, what time is it? All right, we got to pivot over to the actual DD library. This is cool. And I, this is cool. I'll definitely say that. What I'm reading is this idea about how many public companies CEO's don't take are taking compensation from the role. I think the reality is we also know that Cohen came from decent money. So I do think it's worth noting that he's in a slightly different position. And when I look at somebody like Elon, for example, he strikes me as somebody that is literally trying to find a way to go to fucking Mars, which takes a lot of money. I think somebody like Elon is trying to build his assets to accomplish those kinds of goals. That's not anything to be said against the overwhelming number of super fucking greedy CEOs to be super clear, like super fucking greedy. But I don't view this from like Cohen's decision there is like some sort of massive giving choice, although it is, I do think a lot of it is also optics based and you can almost view it as an investment. So by doing that, it grants him a certain amount of good grace. And the amount that he could probably take from a company like GameStop anyways, which now it has a lot of money and cash. But it wouldn't be worth based on what he already has what he gains from the positioning. And again, I'm not saying that in any sort of bad way, it's still very cool that he does it. I respect him heavily for it. But I do think it's important, again, to always objectively evaluate what we're looking at. I don't think it's like this pure altruism. I think there's some pretty wise decision making going on to support it. I wouldn't consider any of it bad though. All right, let's get to the DD library. I don't want to run out of time before we get a chance to get through a couple of these every single time I fucking do this. I get where we are. You like we did chaos theory. So I think we would be on this one. All right, let's see. We're going to make sure things game in numbers. So we already know all of this. We'll to deliver games stop link ETFs. We know all of this. We looked at all of this before. The correlation between GameStop AMC and costs. Actually, that would be we don't have to do it right now. I'll do it towards the end of the stream. But I actually do want to run like a legitimate correlation analysis between them. I haven't done. I haven't done all three of them. Are there any other names that you got I'm literally downloading the data right now? Are there any other names that you can think of that you think belong with this group? I can do like a like a multi way correlation analysis. I think the last 25 years is probably enough. So I'm downloading GameStop now. And then like I said, I won't do this now. I'll tinker with it later. Let me know what names should be included in this right now. I've GameStop AMC. I'll add costs. I will add XRT. I think it makes sense. I'll add a new one. Any other names that you guys can think of? So far, I have GameStop AMC costs maybe Siri. I've heard. The analysis for me will be super easy. I have a structure already that does it for me. I'm like, shit, no, not you lady. My phone keeps chiming in like yo bro, you want me? And in this case, I actually don't. I used to used to be expressed to before they were bankrupted. Yeah, I'm unfamiliar with that one. All right, I'll run it on this this group. Give me one sec just to start the upload. I'll see what chat you be decoms up with first run a correlation analysis on these names include. There. 10, 20, 60, 90, 180, 252 period correlations. Include. I think we probably also. I don't know, I imagine we also want their first exponent. Exponent. For each to measure. Banks. The relationship. As a heat map. Let that bad boy run. Yeah, I imagine we'll want our first exponent. And then I'll build that out because I'm going to want to get some different levels and stuff from it. But I think that'll be good starting point for us. All right, cool. Let that go. Short interest value. We know this. We know this. The other thing to note about this, by the way, options open interest since 2020. This is also the period in time where open interest in most options, chains that are liquid. Was expanding pretty massively. And a lot of that has to do with just retail interest in options. A lot of that did start happening during COVID and then expanded beyond that. So even if you look at the growth, it's actually kind of funny because it's now just recently where you can see some of the expansion slowing down. And my hunch is it's a bunch of the people from COVID that are at the point where they're washing out. Because that's kind of how that goes. All right. It's already done. Let's see. Create a heat map with first exponents as well. Let's see what we got here. This looks interesting. Now again, coming from chat GPT, I don't inherently trust this right away. I have to look at it more closely. But we can start and see what we see. So what I had it build was a rolling correlation between the names across different time frames. The different time frames is important because you'll find that the market does go through periods where things become really, really correlated. That happens a lot during broad market drawdowns where things across the board become pretty heavily correlated to everything else. It's kind of all of a sudden as an underlying market effect. So that's why I like looking across it in different time frames. The longer term time frames are more important to me. And that's because that's where you get a visual on what is the actual longer term relationship between them. So things like the 90 plus I think is decent. And so let's take a look at GameStop. GameStop to XRT is 0.33, which is actually much lighter than I would have expected. GameStop to series 0.13. So that's about nothing. The most closely correlated it is with is AMC. Games like everything else here I actually wouldn't consider it that correlated with. For correlation to be strong, you really need something that's like 0.750.8 or higher 0.6 if you're being kind of loose and gracious. But the fact that it's that light is actually interesting to me. Also the fact that it's that light across so many time frames is really interesting to me. And again, I don't know if this is well known or not. I typically see people talk about them in the context of like how much they move together. But I also see that that generally comes from the lens of people that look at it casually. When they see it, you know, both of them are up on a day or on a couple days and they say like, oh wow, you know, these are like really. They're doing the same thing and there will be periods that they do that. But that's like it's an illusion. You have to look deeper than that. And there's a couple different ways to look at the actual correlation. So this is measuring the correlation. But the next thing I'm going to plot is a herst exponent. And let me see. So plot the herst exponent for the pairs relationship between all the pairs as a heat map. What the herst exponent found is most of them are really trending, but it's looking at the individual names. I want it to look at them and pairs now. Like this. Oh, that's so interesting. Not what I would have expected at all. Wow, really? What period is this for? Run the test again using the same time frames as before for the correlation. Include a table include a heat map that then shows in every. All time. I'll show you what it gave me. This is really surprising. That's not what I would expect at all. And. This is what I really want to look at. Nope, we're going to save that again. Uh, dot gpg. Okay. It's beautiful, isn't it? This thing that I'm showing you right now at a sheer curiosity. Do you do most people know what this is? Or is this are you just looking at colors and it's kind of like yeah, neat colors. I see a couple really interesting takeaways, but. Me and says I'm yelling bingo. That's awesome. I love that. That's good. So because in this way, I asked because you're not supposed to know this. It's like if you know it cool, if not, it's not like a big deal. But I do like to use again, our time together to, you know, teach one another. Okay. One. Mel just got home. So Thor was like, can I go say hi? So. What we're looking at here is called a herst exponent in this context. It's called a herst spread. What this is doing is you can take a look at two different tickers, two different stocks. And let's say this is stock one. Let's say that this is stock two. And you can measure the relationship between them. Now, a lot of people mistakenly use something like correlation and then that's it. Correlation is literally just looking across the periods. And it's saying how do these move in relation to one another? And a lot of times you will find things tend to be pretty fair correlated, meaning they'll go up together. And that's because a lot of the market exhibits positive drift across the board. Now the herst spread takes this to another level. And what it's doing is it's not only saying like, okay, yeah, is it correlated? But it wants to know when you see extremes like this, what is the frequency that the pair converges towards a center point? So it's not just measuring the overall price behavior as a correlation, but it's literally measuring the magnitude of the mean reverting behavior for the pairs. So when you see herst exponents that are above 0.5, it essentially means that they're not really that mean reverting. And for pairs relationships that are less in this context than 0.5, it means that there's a pretty strong mean reversion tendency for them. And that matters because again, going back to what I do as a professional options trader, pairs trading is a big part of what I do. And this is literally what I would do with anything else when I'm measuring relationships. So the fact that these pairs behave this way, it tells me that the relationship itself is stronger in shorter term windows, but on longer term time frames, not really so much, which is really surprising. This is the kind of thing where getting this from chat GPT and the fact that this is kind of counter to what I would expect, I would run this analysis again, and I would use my own data and my own process versus just throwing it in there because I mean, I believe it, but I question it and I would not I would want to know the like the real answer. But one exercise nonetheless, that is surprising to me that the correlations in the Hurst exponents are what they are for it. Yeah, the little less. A little less than expected. All right, let's continue. Cool trading and squeeze stocks. When we look at the shares, trade. I think this is going back to the fundamental misunderstanding of dark pools. Huge FTDs. Hi, do I miss Russell 2000 GM will move out of this soon. How will the shorts adapt their FTD juggling will even be possible for them, which I think we know in some different ways that they've been able to continue the game. Huge open put interest. Yeah, I think it's dependent on the time frame that you look at it in because it definitely does have big open big put interest, but it's also not really just put interest. It is a little more specific to the time frame that we're looking at and what's going on in the market, especially like after a squeeze, I absolutely would expect to see stuff like that put open interest just expand. Okay, so what did we learn from this one we learned. That I W M held game stop I didn't know that I did not know that, but like I've never really thought of it. And we know we also, so understand what I'm doing whenever I read these I try to think of like a couple takeaways, even if it's something that's not necessarily, you know, like shocking or you know game changing. So I do think that that's one of them. I think the other thing that's worth highlighting from here is we learned about the relationships we didn't necessarily learn it from what they wrote. But we learn more about the relationships as a result of what they wrote so I still I still count that. All right, let's see if we can do one more. Oh no, we have to go through. Shit, we got to do I want to finish this little series. All right, so we're moving it in reverse order, which is cool. The shorts have no way to escape. Unfortunately, we know that they did and do. I also think a thing that a lot of us didn't necessarily fully expect was the behavior of the offerings because that also gives the shorts a very easy way out. That's why when people hypothesize that the shorts are still open, which they could be I don't know nobody knows. But that is one of the marks in my mind against that as a potential idea. And it's primarily literally just because we really we really don't know. But with the offerings that have come out, it gives them a pretty reasonable. Way to exit in my opinion. So. Yeah. So anyways, let's continue. I can get my dinner order started here. Let's see if that works. Um. Deep in the money calls used to create naked chairs. You can do this by the way. You don't need to use AI. Unusual whales, which I am an affiliate for. They didn't sponsor this. I'm not plugging them for that reason. They just have a tool that you literally can set alerts to do this. So that might be a fun thing actually to look at. For. Game stop. Investigate Mary. Put naked shorting. Yes. Dark pool trading data from Fenra show massive changes in trade behavior since January. Huge increases in shares traded. Each trade is of few shares in the key players known short funds. Evidence for naked short trades and suppression of retail by pressure. This I think is misguided. The reason why I think that this is misguided is because. This pits a false story that isn't actually reflective. Of the markets and I'll show you what I mean by this. This framing here. Would lead you to believe that in terms of participants. That there are the naked shorters. And retail. This is not the case. There are still a lot of other participants in this space. The reason why this matters is because if it's the David and Goliath game of. Do I think. Naked shorts could suppress retail buying pressure. Absolutely easy. The problem is that there's a big risk for the naked shorts. If that is their game plan not saying that they didn't do it. I don't know. The risk to their game plan is that it's this isn't the only other counter party that's in the market. There are other massive institutions with tons of money that also like short squeezes. It's not just retail traders that look for short squeezes. There are there are literally funds built around short squeezes. So because of that. This isn't that easy of an equation of oh, if the naked shorts just up their naked shorting activity. They can suppress the you know small week retail buy pressure. And it's like there's way more potential buy pressure that exists than just that, which is really, really important to acknowledge. Because then it really makes their problem set way more difficult to manage. Otherwise, if it was as simple as this, then they absolutely could and probably would do this. Like if I was on that side with their with their game plan, that's exactly what I would do. So it makes sense in that context. It just doesn't reflect what's actually out there. Okay. So let's continue to go through. AI to detect deep in the money calls used to hide FPDs. I absolutely can see that. I'm sure you short funds recent positions. Okay, let's see. This I'm on we've looked at this one before. Yeah. I I want 100%. No, we looked at this before. So one of the things I wonder if we'll get an update. Oh, I don't think so. Maybe because we're going from oldest to newest. So if that's the case, we might be able to find an instance where there's an update to this. Because if the theory is that deep in the money, short calls are regularly being used to hide and move the FPDs, then we should see that activity sustained. If the shorts are still open, if not, then it provides a counter data point. If OTC was being used to suppress retail. Well, okay. So again, dark pool. Dark pool is different than OTC. This is again, it's there's a lot of really common misconceptions and misunderstandings about dark pool dark pool print. Dark pool prints still hit the consolidated tape. Super important to know. Keeping the money call volumes used to create naked chairs. I agree with this. Price has started to move. Yes. A coordinated blocking of by orders on key retail brokers and media induced fud. Help the shorts knock down the price and scare off some of the FOMO paper hand. Again, here's the issue I have with this is that it's not acknowledging the fact that the larger grouping here is not retail traders. So because that is the case, because the larger grouping here is not retail traders. That. Normalize some of what they're talking about here. And the reason why nullifies some of it is because again, it makes it really challenging for them to effectively suppress the by behavior if there are other entities that are involved in the mix. So that's. I don't know that that's one of my opinions on this. I think that it misses some of what's going on underneath. Underneath the surface here. But. I'm finishing my dinner order and then I'll get into just taking a look at whatever you guys would take like to take a look at. So if there's any specific, I think somebody wanted to look at hood. I'm happy to look at hood. You can let me know. Whatever you want to poke through and then we can do that now. So I think a lot of what we come across when we go through these is it really is an interesting mix of information that comes in at different levels. But the overall messages remain very similar, which I actually really I genuinely appreciate. I like that. So I think the messages remain so similar. It highlights the consistency and the pervasiveness of the broader issue going on here. So I actually like that. And just says, hi, you don't have Twitter. I do. I'm on X. What's my thing on X. It's at outlier options. That's where you'll find your boy. Deswag says. Running my coverage triangle and GameStop feels like it's out of steam. I've converted some cash to leaps. Jane calls in a little kicker for upside. Are you still running your coverage strangle? I haven't caught any update videos. Oh, that's funny. You must have missed the beginning of the stream. Deswag. I do have it on and I typically review it on this stream at some point during it, but I'm I have an update video on the position coming out tomorrow. So yeah, definitely still running the coverage strangle in it. GameStop is a really interesting stock to trade from a trader's lens. And again, I'll always emphasize that idea of a trading lens. The lifeblood of an options trader is undoubtedly volatility. And something like GameStop maintains really, really significant levels of volatility kind of regularly, like pretty much always. So it provides a ton of trading opportunities. So if we take a look at let me actually reorder the. What the fuck why is that going over? I gotta fix this. I'm gonna I'm gonna try to make these easier for you to see. I'm gonna do this we're doing. Make the line thicker. We'll make it like a bright yellow. And then for real eyes, I'll do like a lighter gray, but we'll make it thicker. There we go. That's way better. I just want you to be able to see what I'm looking at this. I even think we can just get up to like wait. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, that's literally that'll work just fine. What I'm doing is I'm just trying to make it easier to see the the vol ranges for the point that I'm making right now. So we're talking about why something like GameStop is really attractive from an options trading perspective. And it has everything to do with you notice the relationship between this yellow line and this white line yellow line represents implied volatility. And do you notice how frequently the white line is below the yellow line? It's essentially the overwhelming majority of instances. So that leads to trading something like this really, really attractive from a volatility trading lens, like pretty massively. Now, the other thing that is worth talking about is the presence of puts you. So very frequently you will find that puts tend to trade with higher vol. Then calls. This is called puts you. And if we take a look at the vol surface. You can see that represented here notice how the put side of the equation has higher vol than the call side of the equation. Now, if you've been following my coverage of GameStop. There have been really prolonged periods where the call side of this equation is trading way above the put side. But as of late, that's not in the case. It's been much more normal. This is normal. For most individual tickers, this is what you expect to see across most tickers where the put side will trade at a premium relative to the call side. So the fact that that is the case is really, really interesting to me. And it's one of the reasons why I've made the recent change in the position that I have, which again tomorrow will go into that a little bit more. So not only do you get this really prevalent existence of vol, but you also get really strong skew potential sometimes on the call side, sometimes on the put side. But that's the cool part with trading something like the coverage triangle is I can trade either leg of it actually pretty easily. So that's what I got. Anything else that you guys want to hit before we wrap up for the evening? Man, I was just looking at how crazy how haywire volume went here and then it just died. Really unfortunate. Average volume has been declining for weeks. Average volume in this stage in here was like five to eight. Something like that. And in here it's like about the same a couple weeks ago, but like the last two weeks, it's just been siphon and below, which just kind of slowing down. All stocks will do this. We will see what the next major catalyst is. One of the cool things is we always kind of know that they're likely will be one. So we'll keep an eye on it. Sky says what's your take on gamma scalping something like GameStop no fucking chance. No fucking chance. Gamma scalping on GameStop is psychotic. There is absolutely no way. The reason for that is because if you think about gamma scalping, a big part of running that is actively hedging with the underlying part of your underlying activity is shortening the stock. Right. Like if you have to scrub your deltas, that's part of what you have to do. So there's no fucking chance that you would see me there long and at the money straddle or buying a strangle. And then to actually gamma scalp running short shares. No fucking chance. And to be clear, that's not because I'm completely in the camp of you can't short GameStop. I don't mean that. I mean it more from the lens of if your short shares in a squeeze decides to go off while you're in the process of trying to gamahedge that. Fuck that. Fuck that. And then you literally are part of the group that's trying to buy shares. And again, you would have the long options. So the the PNL for it could make sense depending on how the position looks. But depending on how parabolic it goes, it could not look good really fast. So yeah, no, no chance. I think it's a terrible idea. A day swag says still super confident in the thesis. You've changed my life. People go back and watch this video. That's right. I am so stoked to hear that. You have no idea how cool that is to hear. Been a lot of time just talking, sharing the stuff. So. Whenever I get a chance to celebrate with somebody like you in that circumstance, I'm stoked to do it. So congrats man. Happy to hear that. Darkmark says any predictions on Palantir earnings. Let's take a look. This is after the close. So I haven't looked that closely at Palantir yet. As planning on doing that more tomorrow. But let's see what's up. So market has a little excess on the call side. Still pricing in higher put skews so not necessarily showing huge upside. So skew from a directional lens. Let's take a look at. broader positioning. And for these let's take a look at. We don't want deep in the money. Let's do out of the money only. Let's do single leg only. We'll do it for the last week. And we want to filter it by. We'll start without filter in by the expiration dates. We'll just take a look at the overall order. So first thing let's. A lot of short calls. Wow, that's a shit ton. For calls. Let's get rid of. Bid side. So this is unit accumulation. Going out there to the one 50s like this. These really long term. It's a completely different idea. So it does look like there's some speculative. Bullish positioning. I definitely would wager that. Yeah, because I mean. So I'm going to be coming in above the offer the majority of these are on the call side. So this is to me. Speculating more heavily. Now a lot of these are pretty far out in time. Let's take a look at. Another thing. I want to restrict the DTE. So let's take a look at stuff that's within 30 days. Okay. Now what I'm going to do is gain more context. What I've done is I opened up the window to the last. 30 days and I'm actually going to open it up even more. We'll go back. Let's just go back to the beginning of the year. The reason why I'm doing this is because it gives me an idea. By the way, you defenselessly, it is a little bit, okay? But maybe not. But the meaning of the advantage of how large. These trades are relatives. where there's a mill and a half order, but then you'll also see that there's quite a few 500K and up size positions. And most of them are in near term, meaning these are 12 DTE, and they're out of the money calls. So this is a pretty important indication to me that it does look like there's more speculative upside positioning going on now. So now we can click in again. And the first thing that I want to do again is just see that. So this very much looks like pretty strong, long, bullish positioning, coming into earnings. Let's take a look at no, no, oh, here we go. Yeah, look at this. So the OI for the front expirations is massive and it's pretty much broad positive build out, which I mean to me would make complete sense, right? A lot of this is going to be from people trying to set up for their earnings place. We don't really need a ton. Net net from a positioning perspective, it does look like broadly positioning for an expectation to the upside. Yeah. That's what I would take away. There's some pretty decent size trades too. But this itself is a pretty telling story with respect to that to be honest. And the overall volume is by side, yeah. It looks like people are positioning for upside, which I think makes sense given the broader context of it. If we actually go back and we look at its prior earnings, which I think this has, yeah. So if we look over its last eight quarters, you can see that the overwhelming majority of beats, meaning where the expected outperformed the implied, they're to the upside. And they're pretty massively to the upside. It's literally only had two earnings releases out of the last eight where it had a down move to. So from a general earnings play perspective, this is also something that I intend to play, but I'll probably play it to the upside. That is my expectation. Which is funny, right? Because take a look at EPS. It continues to miss. That's very unique. So a big part of the earnings release is going to be the forecasts. But the fact that it can have this consistent of an earnings miss, but still have that strong of outperformance is like, again, really, really interesting. Just take a look at this. It's essentially missed on all of its fucking earnings. Wow. Yeah, looks bullish positioning. That's what I see. Um, Sky says how much weight do you place on order flow? It depends on what I'm looking at it for. So there are some instances where order flow is just context. There are other instances where order flow matters a whole lot. So it's entirely context driven. It's based on like what I'm trying to use it for. Sky says like for me, it's hard to give it much weight because you have no idea what your counterparty's book looks like. What it doesn't inherently matter what the overall book looks like because you already know what the counterparty's book looks like realistically, right? Like the counterparty to what you're doing is likely a market maker who's putting on a bunch of trades literally providing market. And they're hedging like that's what that means. So you actually have a pretty good idea what your counterparty is and what their book looks like. So trying to war game it from the lens of what's the other side of my trade trying to do. It doesn't really matter. But that's actually a poor use of analyzing options flow in my opinion because if you use it more so in the lens that we're talking about here where we're understanding broader positioning and why things are being positioned how they are, then it actually becomes pretty powerful, I think. Adam says downloading from where I have no idea what that's in relation to. Downloading what? I have no idea what that one is. Sorry. All right gang, it is time for me to bounce. I hope everybody enjoys your weekend. You know, I'll be in April. See you later.
