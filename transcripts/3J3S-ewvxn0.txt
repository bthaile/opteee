268.00s: you
294.00s: how much money is this allocated and GameStop in both the sample portfolio that I share and my
304.08s: actual like primary portfolio from the covered Strangle lens is the smallest allocation.
314.08s: Yet year to date it's performing second best relative to the entire portfolio.
323.36s: What that means is it is punching way above its way class with respect to just what it's
331.20s: driving in the broader portfolio. And I just found that actually pretty interesting because it
338.56s: highlights how much volatility is in GameStop for sure and how tradable that volatility is,
346.40s: especially because you'll see on the main chart here, it's been fairly range bound for some time
353.52s: now. It's really been dominantly sideways. I think it's pretty fair to say. So thought that was
363.12s: humorous. We have the the lightest allocation essentially performing the second best.
368.24s: Maybe I was literally sitting there saying, and maybe that means I might need to move a little
375.04s: bit more capital into it now for the covered Strangle that I'm sharing in the sample portfolio.
381.92s: The original idea behind that was allocating $25,000 and the concept was I wanted to trade something
390.88s: that is similar to what other people might have access to trade in a normal portfolio,
398.08s: specifically for this community. So if I do scale it up, it would be in the main portfolio.
405.20s: Now that being said, if we wanted to scale up the community position that I'm trading,
413.60s: then I'm happy to do that. I just don't want to sabotage the original purpose simply because
419.04s: it's performing well and I'm probably going to put more money into it. So something to chew on,
425.12s: you can let me know if you have a preference there. But before we get started, I would like to
432.40s: hear from you. If there's any new news, any new theories, any new pieces of information related
443.84s: to GameStop that I should be aware of or that we should take a look at. I have to be completely
449.44s: upfront. I have not gone through Superstank in quite a while and I've been working on a bunch
457.60s: of other projects and stuff. So I just haven't had a ton of time in order to spend working on this.
465.76s: So I was going to start there, just scrolling through really quick to see if anything looks
471.12s: you know, topical. But so far there hasn't, yeah, there really hasn't been a tremendous amount
478.88s: that's crossed my desk. But as always, please let me know if there's something that we should take a
486.08s: look at. So we got dark mark Reese pow sounds like going to go slay some pow some fresh pow
496.32s: Benjo good to see you as well. Paul says I want to understand why your positions have a 45 day
502.08s: expert. People talk me about going week to week when IV is low with what position you're referring to.
514.64s: Because that will have that will have a differentiation. So let's scroll through. I'm going to sort
524.88s: this. Can we do like top by different time frames? Yeah, here we go. Just going to look over the
535.20s: last month and see what's highlighting covered calls. I really don't have a 45 day expert for covered
544.08s: calls. That's if you're talking about like a specific position that I've recently shared now,
550.88s: then I just need to know which one you're talking about. But that's not like a set thing that I will
559.04s: do writ large always. That's why I'm just trying to understand the context of what you're looking at.
565.52s: All right, so this one OG apes. This one is just game stop being up.
571.44s: Let's see what you guys want to see with. I kind of want to see what this one is.
588.64s: Group of fellow GME enthusiasts, myself taking deep into swaps, particularly UBS.
593.76s: They're trying to wiggle, wriggle their way out of having to follow any rules regarding the maintenance
600.56s: and closing of legacy bags. That's interesting. If true.
608.00s: So UTC staff issues, no action letter regarding merger of UBS, group and credit suis.
615.52s: We'll not recommend to the commission taking enforcement action against certain of UBS,
626.16s: London's branch swapped the other counterparties for their failure to comply with the CFTC's
633.28s: unclear swap margin requirements for such transferred swaps.
639.12s: ECR will not recommend to the commission taking enforcement action against UBS for their
644.64s: food to comply with the CFT swaps clearing requirements for such transferred swaps.
654.72s: Okay, so I have a lot of questions. The first question is, how are we tying
668.96s: their failure to comply on unclear swap margin requirements and swap clearing requirements
680.08s: with closing of legacy positions? So let's see what let's see what
689.68s: let's see what this might be. So I'm going to chat you PT and as you know, chat you PT is the dog.
699.92s: So let's see what it says. Explain the latest EC notice regarding UBS
714.08s: issue of no action letter regarding the merger with credit suis from 15 April.
730.88s: So let's see what that is. I don't know much, but I'm quite I'm quite interested in what this is.
747.44s: So let's see. On April 15, CFTC, I should know action letter in response to a request
758.88s: from UBS AG pertains to the transfer of certain legacy swap contracts from credit suis to UBS
765.28s: London following the merger in March of 23 suis face significant distress completed in June of 23.
776.64s: This is exceeding to all assets liabilities part of the integration
781.04s: initiated the wind down of CSI and sought to transfer CSI trading assets liabilities including
787.04s: legacy swaps to UBS AG London branch. This transfer was executed in a court sanctioned business
795.04s: transfer scheme. The transfer swap to his legacy subs were entered into before the relevant
804.32s: compliance dates for the CFC swaps clearing and unclaring swap margin requirements.
807.84s: Therefore, we're not subject to these requirements prior to the transfer.
812.80s: See, this is one of my minor frustrations because when I when I go through these,
820.00s: what ends up happening is people are looking at this and they're simply saying
825.04s: what's being said about the big bank and the perspective of just here dislike and distrust
834.08s: of large institutions, which again, I do not blame, but it starts to confound our ability to
843.20s: objectively reason because effectively what this is saying is that they moved those assets
851.36s: sooner rather than later and they weren't required to comply with these. So that coming out to me
860.96s: just seems to make sense and it's actually contrary to this idea of currently trying to
868.16s: wriggle out of having to follow any rules. Literally what this is telling us based on a cursory
874.64s: overview is that those swaps first were being transferred before the compliance dates. So it's not
884.64s: that they were like trying to make them go away. They transferred them early, but then also
892.16s: they weren't required to the requirements prior to the transfer. So
903.92s: here we go. The issuance of the Nino action letter sparked criticism for some market participants
909.04s: and observers. Concerns have been raised that granting such relief may set a precedent,
912.96s: allowing large financial institutions to circumvent regulatory requirements, potentially undermining
918.48s: the integrity of the regulatory framework established after the OA crisis critics argue that
922.24s: this could encourage excessive risk taking in a road market discipline. That's a fantastic point.
927.12s: And that makes me feel a little bit different. I still think that this part of like trying to wriggle
935.28s: out of the positions is different than what this is saying in terms of moving risk ahead of the
941.60s: regulatory window, but I do agree with that. I think based on what this is explaining to me that
946.72s: that's kind of nonsense. So evaluate the criticism from market participants and observers.
961.68s: What elements have merit? What elements do not do it? It says
972.40s: I didn't talk to you, Siri Chil.
981.84s: Moral hazard concerns. I agree with this.
988.16s: Rule integrity erosion. I agree with this. Counterpoint, limited scope relief applies only
993.44s: to legacy swaps entered in prior to the compliance states. These are not new or risky trades and
998.72s: it's administrative transfer under a court supervised merger. This wasn't a backroom deal.
1003.52s: Part of a formal legally binding UK parts, seven transfer vetted by financial regulators on both sides
1009.92s: of the Atlantic. Okay. Allows them to dodge margin and clearing rules. So they were imposed for
1018.48s: a reason unequal cost of capital only applies to the legacy positions and its systematics stability
1024.80s: trade off forcing repapering, margining or clearing of these trades could risk this
1030.00s: orderly unwine your mispricing, which might introduce new systemic risks exactly what the merger
1036.56s: was intended to avoid. Hmm. There is.
1046.24s: She'll live in from consequences of bad decisions. I agree with that definitely on the part of
1050.56s: Credit Suisse for sure. And then also from a market fairness lens. That's very
1056.88s: onion. I think that's completely true. This I think is a really important point as well.
1065.36s: So for those that don't know, UBS's acquisition, it was, it wasn't like a massive play because
1075.36s: they were stoked on it, although I'm sure that there are elements that they were stoked on.
1080.80s: So. Yeah, I mean, I think from a precedent risk perspective that this is important. So I think
1098.00s: granting too many exceptions unless they're warranted by some sort of specific reason starts to
1104.48s: set a terrible precedent. The one reason that I do believe is again, pertinent here is this.
1113.76s: So the fact that it was a government forced acquisition is a different precedent, right? Because
1121.12s: UBS is already getting put into this equation, not fully under their own volition.
1126.96s: A bypass margin clearing rules.
1132.80s: This I think is a terrible weakness in terms of the concern, like just because they're not subject
1140.24s: to the rules, I think that's bullshit. They should be. Especially with as we've seen how black box
1147.44s: swaps have been. This is one of the things when I talk with Newton about his analysis of them.
1156.80s: In how difficult it is to really conclude anything from them. And it's for the reasons that I
1163.60s: shared with him and then also with the rest of the group with respect to the fact that swaps are
1169.20s: essentially. You can't see into them. We don't really know what's in them and that part I don't
1175.20s: really love. It's a really tricky game because I'm not positive that all of that should be
1181.76s: publicly available at all times. But I don't see why the components of a swap wouldn't be part
1190.88s: of regular filings on a periodic cadence, just like all other holdings. Like to me, that seems
1198.96s: reasonable. But the funny thing too is with Trump in office now, it does seem like the regulatory
1211.84s: landscape is likely to change quite a lot. And it's because Trump is obviously in favor of deregulation
1219.20s: for the banks. So it begs the question of like what kind of progress you might see for anything
1226.96s: like this, which let's not dive too far into the political debate potential. But let's focus on
1236.96s: something as simple as naked shorting. Remember when we watched that little bit of a video a long time
1242.16s: ago, maybe a month or two ago, about GameStop and the naked shorting where Susan Trimbath was in
1249.92s: there. Well, if you if you'll remember, that stuff literally was from over a decade ago, like two
1257.52s: decades ago. And we're still talking about the very same naked shorting conversation. So that
1265.04s: tells you a lot. And that tells you that it's a bipartisan oversight in that neither what no party
1272.80s: has moved to actually address something like that. So the financial industry is kind of weird in
1279.68s: that way. They do get they do get to fly a little bit under the radar on some of the stuff. So
1287.60s: I agree with that. We truly care about that saga. You know that this is the moment we've been waiting
1292.56s: for this confirmation that there exists some legacy short problem. Again, this this doesn't
1298.72s: confirm that to be clear. It doesn't it doesn't confirm that there's a legacy short problem.
1305.44s: We're making way too many jumps here. We're saying legacy shorts. We don't know that they're shorts
1311.04s: and problem. We have no idea. This doesn't look like there's a problem to me. This just looks like
1316.24s: a transfer of assets that fell outside of a regulatory window, which probably should have been
1322.64s: within the regulatory window. Let's be honest. But to jump to this again, I think is a bit of a leap.
1332.56s: We've long examined that banks began reporting massive losses January of 21.
1338.80s: Time to be vocal. I in that part, I actually I don't feel any type of way about like go for it.
1345.28s: The more the more attention that gets drawn to this, the better. The one thing that I will always
1352.32s: remind organizers, if you know whoever organized this, father of lies. Like if father of lies ever
1361.04s: watches any of my videos or catches this, if one of you sends this to him, the thing that I would
1366.24s: remind somebody like him on or them, I should say, because I don't know if it's him, is that
1372.40s: you have to be really, you have to view human capital carefully. Because when people first see
1381.60s: something that they don't like, a lot of times they're very willing to act and do something.
1388.00s: One of the problems with financial reform is that it is so slow and it takes so long
1395.52s: to actually accomplish something. So I would view the calls to action for stuff like this,
1403.52s: which this is completely fine. But I would just be very methodical about the stuff that you really
1407.92s: try to draw the community to focus on. Because if that happens too much with too many issues with too
1413.12s: many people, you start to lose that drive from the community versus showing in like highlighting
1419.92s: things that we really think matter, which this might be it. I'm just saying a general thing that I've
1424.56s: seen across when I go through Superstong is that it can become slightly draining, I think, for the
1430.56s: casual participant, there are the semi-casual participants. Press release, when filing the complaints,
1437.76s: it should be worth noting that it's regarding the press release about CFTC staff letter, complaint
1443.04s: form. Yeah, cool. I mean, I think it's cool. This, again, I'm not really positive that this is
1450.48s: them trying to sweep something under the rug. But I do think making that move me outside the
1456.32s: regulatory window also shouldn't happen. So yeah, I think that's, I think that's legit.
1465.68s: Okay. We already know this. In case you guys didn't see what the latest on this whole
1472.64s: tariff thing, which is really interesting, Japan yesterday, they came off the top rope or it might
1478.40s: have been this morning a little bit last night. But they were saying that with these tariff
1484.64s: negotiations with the US that they're considering the trillion in US debt that they hold. So essentially,
1494.00s: it's a country level bond vigilante move, which is awesome. It's just awesome for the plot.
1503.84s: It's a terrible negotiating scenario, not just from Japan, by the way, also with the way that the
1509.92s: US did all this shit. It's just terrible because everybody has their fucking knives out. But it's
1516.24s: fantastic for the plot. All right. What is this?
1521.12s: Kat Errors set eventually released by Finra. Let's ask GPD about that.
1534.16s: You summarize the latest CT errors. I don't know when the latest report was. This is from like two
1543.84s: weeks ago. Explain the context of why they most often occur and the drivers of why.
1565.52s: All right. Let's see what this is.
1584.96s: So like this here, right? This says cat error data set released by Finra, which is good. I like this.
1593.60s: But if we look at the actual errors here, most of them are just late.
1602.72s: I would be way more concerned with the ones that are processed and not accepted,
1609.52s: which is obviously a subset of this, right? So you can see what is this? Damn, that's a lot of
1616.16s: damn, that's a lot. Damn 60 billion. Let's just give it to the 60 billion. But let's take a look here.
1625.04s: 392 million, 382 million, right? Like that, that I think is bad. When there's that big of a variance
1633.28s: between what was processed versus accepted, that to me is sketchy. The shit that's late, I'm going
1639.28s: to ask chat GPT because I honestly don't know the main reasons why they might be late. We'll find
1644.56s: that out in a second. But this doesn't draw my immediate attention as much, but let's see.
1658.32s: 10 April error counts escalator over 23 million. Okay. Data ingestion errors, linkage errors,
1670.40s: late reporting. This is the one I want to know. So of the common causes of CAT errors,
1681.36s: what might the incentives be for the reporting entity to report late, submit incomplete reports
1700.88s: for failure to report errors?
1713.76s: Underlying drivers, complex reporting requirements, which I do believe is fair system integration
1719.20s: challenges. This seems like it shouldn't be a thing forever or this should be the kind of thing
1726.08s: that should be infrequent where it becomes an issue versus where it doesn't.
1730.48s: And I really do have sympathy for this. The reason being is if you look at the size of the data
1737.76s: that's moving, right? I mean, it's massive. It's billions of data points moving, multi-component
1745.04s: data points for that matter. And even when I worked at Deloitte, we would regularly see
1751.28s: integrations between different systems, even within house in the same company. But if there's an
1760.72s: update or a change or something applied to one, it can then break the other. And there are a ton
1770.56s: of changes that are ongoing for maintenance of the systems. That's like a very simplistic
1776.40s: example for this. But I could see how this genuinely could happen without nefarious intent,
1784.08s: which is what I'm going to ask Chattach PtNax, though, is what kind of instances might we see
1788.48s: nefarious intent. But this I do feel for. Anytime I see this kind of volume of shit moving,
1796.80s: regardless of what it is, even if it's super simple line items, the first thing that comes to my
1802.96s: mind is error prone. Even if this isn't going between entities within specific reporting requirements
1810.88s: or complex reporting. Reliance third party vendors. So now there's a third party, which is even more
1818.56s: difficult lack of robust supervisory procedures and controls of reporting process,
1823.92s: contributes to persistent errors. This makes sense. Why would this happen in your guys' opinion?
1831.12s: I have an opinion on this one pretty clearly, but I want to know what you guys think.
1836.16s: Why would there be an inadequate amount of supervision? And again, as always, I encourage you to
1842.56s: approach the conversation here. Even there's a broader lens. While we're talking about a scenario that
1850.96s: directly impacts in this context game stop, the stuff that we're covering here really talks about
1858.00s: broader game theory, incentives and things of that nature. Because to me, there's a couple really
1866.72s: clear line items attached to this. One of them, from my opinion, is in the military, we use
1880.56s: inspect what you expect. And depending on what the punishment is, what people are willing to do to
1890.64s: avoid that punishment varies a lot. If there's something that somebody wants to do and the punishment
1898.56s: is relatively light, then you just deal with the punishment. You don't care that much because the
1905.04s: incentive isn't strong enough to dissuade you from doing whatever that thing is. However,
1912.64s: great example, drinking. Drinking in the Marine Corps, big problem. We were raised in a fucking pub
1919.12s: in a tavern. So comes with the territory, but Marines making terrible choices while they're
1926.48s: drinking becomes a problem and it becomes a force readiness issue literally. So when the Marine
1934.80s: Corps decided as an institution to start tamping those downs, the punishments for drinking related
1941.60s: incidents got way more severe. And what do you think happened? The number of incidents started
1949.28s: plummeting because then people are saying, well, instead of just getting an extra duty if I get a
1955.36s: dy extra duty for a month or whatever kind of sucks, but whatever. Now it's literally you might
1961.44s: be fucking kicked out of the Marine Corps. That's a different story. Then it's like,
1967.76s: fuck, that's literally just not worth it. And it makes the calculus easier. So in my opinion,
1973.20s: a big part of the reason why there's an inadequate amount of supervision is because the stick
1978.88s: is not big enough and they don't fucking care. Here's something I would near guarantee you.
1986.80s: If there was in excess of a certain amount of errors, if the CEO of the institution got zero dollars
1999.12s: that year for their pay, how many errors do you think there would be? Probably very fucking few
2007.68s: that are not genuinely attributable to something outside of their power. Probably not. Now I'm not
2015.12s: advocating for something like that because it's really, really extreme. But it's again,
2019.84s: talking about this overarching decoupling and the distance between regulatory punitive actions
2030.00s: and then the incentive structure it creates. This is literally saying, we do not fucking care. And
2037.52s: why would they? They're not made to care. So they're going to focus about the shit that they think
2043.20s: is more worth their time to care about. All right. So let's see potential incentives, delay,
2050.88s: trade transparency, obscure certain trading behavior, particularly those related to proprietary
2056.00s: strategies, large directional positions that could move the market if visible too soon.
2061.84s: Maybe by time to clean records, this I think could be volume smoothing maybe
2069.04s: reduce regulatory attention. Well, this seems like it's the opposite now where they're getting more
2076.08s: attention, but I could see why they might be trying to hide things. While intentional omission is rare
2083.04s: due to audit trails and vendor oversight, the incentive to lose detail increases with perceived
2089.28s: enforcement weakness or delays in cat recognition on its exactly literally exactly what we just
2096.56s: fucking talked about. Right here, the firm perceives cat compliance as low risk. Yeah,
2109.04s: I think that that's exactly correct. Interesting.
2126.56s: There's within six days.
2136.56s: C plus 35 is that the latest? What creates a comprehensive list of all the
2148.32s: games stop related cycle theories?
2152.00s: Why do you say PN stuffing parties?
2156.88s: C and P ВE
2181.76s: 35 trading days after a spike in FTDs.
2187.84s: The study published by a check journal economics found consistent cycles ETF
2192.00s: FTDs affecting game stops price around T 35.
2198.68s: T 21 standard settlement for some securities 13.
2205.92s: In 90 13 35.
2212.56s: Okay.
2226.80s: In complete submission failure to report. Yep. So we talked about this.
2232.96s: Basically almost entirely preventable.
2236.08s: No.
2240.08s: I don't think that that's fair.
2242.08s: I don't think that's fair at all. I think let's see.
2246.80s: Break down the likely percentage of causes of the of the total amount of CAT errors.
2263.28s: Found.
2267.28s: My guess is system integration issues is probably a bigger a bigger than saying something like it's almost completely.
2275.28s: Yeah, exactly.
2279.28s: And again, this is in I don't by the way, let's take a giant step back as I'm going through this.
2285.28s: When I'm looking and using chat GPT, I do not take chat GPT at face value at all.
2291.28s: This it's the same thing is finding something in a Google search.
2295.28s: I do not take it at face value.
2297.28s: I always apply just the broader lens that I have as a market participant and just a thinker.
2307.28s: Now, if you'll notice before this result was even out, my instincts would tell me based on what we talked about before that this would be a primary driver very likely.
2319.28s: So when I saw this, I don't think of it as yeah, it's definitely 40 to 50%.
2325.28s: I don't know that, but I still absolutely this bolsters that idea that it's very likely a primary driver.
2333.28s: Again, anybody that's worked with any sort of tech integration.
2339.28s: If you worked as a consultant with these kinds of things, you literally will see this shit all the time.
2345.28s: So I don't think that this is accurate at all.
2348.28s: Almost entirely preventable.
2350.28s: I literally think it's the inverse that the majority of it is probably driven by linkage errors of some sort that might put them outside.
2363.28s: So later, this report just came out.
2366.28s: Okay.
2372.28s: Second half, the reporting period after the Trump terrorist came out.
2378.28s: Right. So like this to me makes it ton of sense.
2385.28s: When you see.
2387.28s: Somebody just came up to my house.
2391.28s: When you see this kind of like market activity.
2396.28s: When Trump terrorist came out, just about everything when haywire.
2401.28s: So you have to look at it from the lens of the places that are trying to run their business.
2405.28s: So this wouldn't surprise me at all that I believe would just checks out.
2411.28s: So it's interesting. I'm really glad that we're actually seeing this documentation finally and we can see the numbers.
2419.28s: I think that getting a more granular view on this essentially creating a pie chart similar to this would be so insightful to understand how much of it is coming from things like linkage errors versus literally chosen.
2439.28s: Late reporting or incomplete submissions or repair errors like because this is still a pretty decent size bucket.
2448.28s: Right. Like even if you take the low end, it's at least 25% probably of the total instances.
2455.28s: So that matters actually like that's not like an insignificant bucket at all.
2466.28s: Alan a tall bot.
2478.28s: What is this?
2483.28s: So this looks interesting.
2497.28s: So this for those that don't know the concept of notional value, we use this in options trading all the time.
2504.28s: It's the same. It's literally the same exact idea swaps are just another derivative.
2509.28s: So the whole point of notional value is it's providing access to a leveraged position again just like with options.
2520.28s: If you sell a naked short put and the stock is $100. Well, you don't have to put up the total amount of cash to cash secure the hundred shares that you might have to buy at whatever your strike prices.
2533.28s: What this is saying is that.
2536.28s: Swaps follow the same general concept where they have access to significance amounts of leverage.
2545.28s: So.
2547.28s: That matters a lot because one it increases capital efficiency so it becomes very attractive.
2554.28s: That's again, why a lot of more professional levered or more professional level traders do move into things like options.
2565.28s: This is a notable component of it. It's for leverage. It's for capital efficiency. It's not if you have a small account, you can't afford it.
2575.28s: It's part of it for smaller accounts, but even bigger accounts. It's not that you can't afford the underlying position that you can be way more tactical with how you're using your money.
2585.28s: Michael says can we talk about hood has more upside. Yeah, we could take a look at that at the ends. I'm going to focus on game stop for now.
2594.28s: The john says got some Jimmy weekly's monthly when IV was 58.
2603.28s: That sucks.
2605.28s: Depending on what monthly you're in.
2609.28s: That is sub sub optimal.
2614.28s: So why does citadel's 923 billy matter. It shows massive interest rate exposure. Yes, that's true.
2623.28s: That's completely true. So.
2629.28s: I assume this point is understood if it's not let me know.
2633.28s: But this this is a really important point. It's almost the same weapon. That's being used right now by.
2642.28s: I'm not sure if it's not that good.
2647.28s: Japan.
2648.28s: With the terror of negotiations that we talked about before. It's very similar to that.
2653.28s: Huge leverage. That's correct.
2655.28s: Labeled in millions at this time. Okay.
2660.28s: 944 billion.
2662.28s: That's based on that amount. Not that they owe it. Okay.
2666.28s: The only shows 6.5 billion assets 4.7 billion liabilities. So net positive 1.8 or just 24 million net after offsetting.
2675.28s: Okay.
2681.28s: Yes. Yes. Yes. Also, who.
2687.28s: I found this up. Then I found something weird on superstongers searching this up.
2693.28s: 18 citadel reported 11.3 billy.
2697.28s: In total exchange traded derivative assets.
2701.28s: So.
2706.28s: 19.7 billy.
2711.28s: 20.
2716.28s: 33 bill. Big red flag. 2021.
2721.28s: There's no millions labels on this table yet it matches the format of every year prior of that's millions 2.3 trillion.
2730.28s: Yeah. I would assume that that's trillion for sure.
2738.28s: Yeah. I definitely.
2743.28s: No TC cleared no millions 9.5 trillion total derivatives.
2755.28s: 6.7 billion.
2763.28s: Man, that's a fucking interesting question, right?
2768.28s: This question, by the way, why would millions go away and come back? Like why would that?
2776.28s: That's incredibly sketchy because again, going back to even when I was a consultant with the light,
2789.28s: when you're preparing these kinds of documents, it is with very, very deep care that you put them together.
2799.28s: So the fact that this might be, you know, lazily put together, I doubt that.
2808.28s: So that seems quite purposeful in my opinion, can't prove it. It's a it is a complete guess on my end, but that's what I believe based on again, just generally thinking about it.
2822.28s: There you go. See, I'll talk about same page completely with this.
2830.28s: Again, I don't go as far as to say definitely intentional. I'm very against stuff like that just because it's being objective is so valuable in my opinion.
2843.28s: But I for me, I would absolutely say something like this was very likely intentional because I do think that.
2855.28s: Not that not in solving 944 billion of interest rate bets in the middle of a bond market unwind. It's not nothing.
2865.28s: Very interesting.
2871.28s: Very, very interesting.
2874.28s: Let me look at on.
2878.28s: This is the right one.
2882.28s: On a cum.
2885.28s: Very interesting.
2899.28s: When was this?
2903.28s: I want to ask him about it.
2907.28s: 21 days ago.
2912.28s: I'm going to hit him up really quick.
2918.28s: I think question on the citadel.
2954.28s: I'm going to hit him up.
2959.28s: Very, very interesting.
2961.28s: So I am curious.
2966.28s: What I want to know is based on what he saw if there's any specific drivers that he's thinking behind it.
2973.28s: What time is it?
2974.28s: All right.
2976.28s: We got to pivot over to the actual DD library.
2981.28s: This is cool.
3003.28s: And I.
3008.28s: This is cool. I'll definitely say that what I'm reading is this idea about how many public companies CEOs don't take.
3020.28s: Are in taking compensation from the role.
3025.28s: I think the reality is we also know that.
3035.28s: Cohen came from decent money.
3040.28s: So I do think it's worth noting that he's in a slightly different position.
3047.28s: When I look at somebody like Elon, for example, he strikes me as somebody that is literally trying to find a way to go to fucking Mars, which takes a lot of money.
3060.28s: So I think somebody like Elon is trying to build his assets to accomplish those kinds of goals.
3066.28s: That's not anything to be said against the overwhelming number of super fucking greedy CEOs to be super clear, like super fucking greedy.
3082.28s: But I don't view this from like Cohen's decision there is like some sort of massive giving choice, although it is.
3094.28s: I think a lot of it is also optics based and you can almost view it as an investment.
3101.28s: So by doing that, it grants him a certain amount of good grace.
3109.28s: And the amount that he could probably take from a company like GameStop anyways, which now it has a lot of money and cash.
3118.28s: But it wouldn't be worth based on what he already has, what he gains from the positioning.
3128.28s: And again, I'm not saying that in any sort of bad way, it's still very cool that he does it and I respect him heavily for it.
3134.28s: But I do think it's important again to always objectively evaluate what we're looking at.
3139.28s: I don't think it's like this pure altruism.
3144.28s: I think there's some pretty wise decision making going on to support it.
3154.28s: Wouldn't consider any of it bad though.
3158.28s: All right.
3160.28s: Let's get to the DD library.
3163.28s: I don't want to run out of time before we get a chance to get through a couple of these every single time I fucking do this.
3171.28s: I get where we are.
3174.28s: You like we did chaos theory.
3176.28s: So I think we would be on this one.
3185.28s: All right. Let's see.
3188.28s: Make sure things game in numbers. So we already know all of this.
3195.28s: We all to deliver games stop linked ETFs. We know all of this. We looked at all of this before.
3204.28s: The correlation between GameStop, AMC and costs.
3208.28s: Actually, that would be we don't have to do it right now. I'll do it towards the end of the stream.
3213.28s: But I actually do want to run like a legitimate correlation analysis between them.
3218.28s: I haven't done I haven't done all three of them.
3221.28s: Are there any other names that you got I'm literally downloading the data right now?
3225.28s: Are there any other names that you can think of that you think belong with this group?
3233.28s: Because I can do like a like a multi way correlation analysis.
3240.28s: I think the last 25 years is probably enough.
3249.28s: So I'm downloading GameStop now.
3253.28s: And then like I said, I won't do this now. I'll I'll tinker with it later.
3256.28s: But let me know what names should be included in this right now.
3260.28s: I've GameStop, AMC. I'll add costs.
3269.28s: I will add XRT.
3275.28s: I think it makes sense.
3280.28s: Okay. Any other names that you guys can think of?
3286.28s: So far, I have GameStop, AMC, costs, maybe Siri. I've heard.
3295.28s: The analysis for me will be super easy. I have a structure already that does it for me.
3302.28s: Siri.
3305.28s: Oh, shit. No, not you lady.
3308.28s: My phone keeps chiming in like yo bro, you want me?
3312.28s: And in this case, I actually don't.
3321.28s: I'm not going to use to be expressed to before they were bankrupted.
3327.28s: Yeah, I'm unfamiliar with that one.
3330.28s: All right, I'll run it on this this group. Give me one sec just to start the upload.
3336.28s: I'll see what chat you be decoms up with first run a correlation analysis on these names.
3344.28s: And there are 10, 20, 60, 90, 180, 252 period correlations.
3363.28s: I think we probably also, I don't know, I imagine we also want their herst exponent.
3374.28s: Exponent for each to measure ranks.
3384.28s: And then I'll build that out because I'm going to want to get some different levels and stuff from it.
3396.28s: But I think that'll be good starting point for us.
3402.28s: All right, cool.
3405.28s: Let that go.
3407.28s: We know this.
3412.28s: The other thing to note about this, by the way, options open interest since 2020.
3420.28s: This is also the period in time where open interest in most options, chains that are liquid was expanding pretty massively.
3430.28s: And a lot of that has to do with just retail interest in options.
3434.28s: A lot of that did start happening during COVID and then expanded beyond that.
3439.28s: So even if you look at the growth, it's actually kind of funny because it's now just recently where you can see some of the expansion slowing down.
3447.28s: And my hunch is it's a bunch of the people from COVID that are at the point where they're washing out.
3454.28s: Because that's kind of how that goes.
3459.28s: All right.
3462.28s: It's already done. Let's see. Create a heat map with first exponents as well.
3479.28s: Let's see what we got here.
3484.28s: This looks interesting.
3489.28s: Now again, coming from chat GPT, I don't inherently trust this right away.
3494.28s: I have to look at it more closely.
3497.28s: But we can start and see what we see.
3500.28s: So what I had it build was a rolling correlation between the names across different time frames.
3508.28s: The different time frames is important because you'll find that the market does go through periods where things become really, really correlated.
3517.28s: That happens a lot during broad market draw downs where things across the board become pretty heavily correlated to everything else, just kind of all of a sudden as an underlying market effect.
3533.28s: So that's why I like looking across it in different time frames.
3538.28s: The longer term time frames are more important to me.
3541.28s: And that's because that's where you get a visual on what is the actual longer term relationship between them.
3552.28s: So things like the 90 plus, I think is decent.
3558.28s: And so let's take a look at GameStop.
3563.28s: GameStop to XRT is 0.33, which is actually much lighter than I would have expected.
3571.28s: GameStop to series 0.13. So that's about nothing.
3575.28s: The most closely correlated it is with is AMC.
3581.28s: Games like everything else here, I actually wouldn't consider it that correlated with.
3587.28s: For correlation to be strong, you really need something that's like 0.750.8 or higher 0.6 if you're being kind of loose and gracious.
3601.28s: But the fact that it's that light is actually interesting to me.
3607.28s: Also the fact that it's that light across so many time frames is really interesting to me.
3615.28s: And again, I don't know if this is well known or not.
3619.28s: I typically see people talk about them in the context of like how much they move together.
3625.28s: But I also see that that generally comes from the lens of people that look at it casually.
3632.28s: When they see it, you know, both of them are up on a day or on a couple days and they say like, oh wow, you know, these are like really.
3641.28s: They're doing the same thing and there will be periods that they do that.
3646.28s: But that's like it's an illusion.
3648.28s: You have to look deeper than that.
3650.28s: And there's a couple different ways to look at the actual correlation.
3654.28s: So this is measuring the correlation.
3656.28s: But the next thing I'm going to plot is a herst exponent.
3663.28s: And let me see.
3665.28s: So plot the herst exponent for the pairs relationship between all the pairs as a heat map.
3677.28s: What the herst exponent found is most of them are really trending, but it's looking at the individual names.
3684.28s: I want it to look at them and pairs now.
3687.28s: Like this.
3693.28s: Oh, that's so interesting.
3697.28s: Not what I would have expected at all.
3703.28s: Wow, really?
3705.28s: What period is this for?
3708.28s: Run the test again using the same time frames as before for the correlation.
3725.28s: Include a table include a heat map that then shows in every.
3733.28s: All time.
3739.28s: I'll show you what it gave me.
3742.28s: This is really surprising.
3745.28s: That's not what I would expect at all.
3751.28s: And this is what I really want to look at.
3760.28s: Nope, we're going to save that again.
3764.28s: Uh, dot gp.
3767.28s: Okay.
3773.28s: It's beautiful, isn't it?
3779.28s: This thing that I'm showing you right now at a sheer curiosity.
3782.28s: Do you do most people know what this is?
3786.28s: Or is this are you just looking at colors and it's kind of like yeah, neat colors?
3793.28s: I see a couple really interesting takeaways, but.
3802.28s: Me and says I'm yelling bingo.
3804.28s: That's awesome.
3805.28s: I love that.
3806.28s: That's good.
3807.28s: So because in this way I asked because you're not supposed to know this.
3812.28s: It's like if you know it cool, if not, it's not like a big deal.
3815.28s: But I do like to use again our time together to, you know, teach one another.
3822.28s: Okay.
3823.28s: One.
3832.28s: Mel just got home.
3833.28s: So Thor was like, can I go say hi?
3836.28s: So the what we're looking at here is called a herst exponent in this context.
3842.28s: It's called a herst spread.
3847.28s: What this is doing is you can take a look at two different tickers, two different stocks.
3854.28s: And let's say this is stock one.
3858.28s: Let's say that this is stock two.
3865.28s: And you can measure the relationship between them.
3868.28s: Now a lot of people mistakenly use something like correlation and then that's it.
3875.28s: Correlation is literally just looking across the periods.
3880.28s: And it's saying how do these move in relation to one another?
3885.28s: And a lot of times you will find things tend to be pretty fair correlated,
3890.28s: meaning they'll go up together.
3892.28s: And that's because a lot of the market exhibits positive drift across the board.
3897.28s: Now the herst spread takes this to another level.
3902.28s: And what it's doing is it's not only saying like, okay, yeah, is it correlated?
3908.28s: But it wants to know when you see extremes like this, what is the frequency that the pair converges towards a center point?
3919.28s: So it's not just measuring the overall price behavior as a correlation,
3925.28s: but it's literally measuring the magnitude of the mean reverting behavior for the pairs.
3935.28s: So when you see herst exponents that are above 0.5,
3941.28s: it essentially means that they're not really that mean reverting.
3946.28s: And for pairs relationships that are less in this context than 0.5,
3952.28s: it means that there's a pretty strong mean reversion tendency for them.
3959.28s: And that matters because again, going back to what I do as a professional options trader,
3967.28s: pairs trading is a big part of what I do.
3969.28s: And this is literally what I would do with anything else when I'm measuring relationships.
3975.28s: So the fact that these pairs behave this way, it tells me that the relationship itself is stronger in shorter term windows.
3988.28s: But on longer term time frames, not really so much, which is really surprising.
3994.28s: This is the kind of thing where getting this from chat GPT.
3997.28s: And the fact that this is kind of counter to what I would expect,
4000.28s: I would run this analysis again.
4002.28s: And I would use my own data and my own process versus just throwing it in there because.
4010.28s: I mean, I believe it, but I question it and I would not I would want to know the like the real answer.
4018.28s: But on exercise nonetheless, that is surprising to me that the correlations in the herst exponents are what they are for it.
4031.28s: Yeah, the little less.
4039.28s: A little less than expected. All right, let's continue.
4043.28s: Dark pool trading and squeeze stocks.
4055.28s: When we look at the shares, trade.
4061.28s: I think this is going back to the fundamental misunderstanding of dark pools.
4073.28s: Huge FTDs.
4079.28s: Hi, do I miss Russell 2000 GM will move out of this soon?
4085.28s: How will the shorts adapt their FDD juggling will it even be possible for them, which I think we know in some different ways that they've been able to continue the game.
4096.28s: Huge open put interest.
4100.28s: Yeah, I think it's dependent on the time frame that you look at it in because it definitely does have big open big put interest, but it's also not really just put interest.
4117.28s: It is a little more specific to the time frame that we're looking at and what's going on in the market, especially like after a squeeze, I absolutely would expect to see stuff like.
4128.28s: Put open interest just expand.
4133.28s: Okay, so what did we learn from this one we learned.
4138.28s: That.
4141.28s: I W M held game stop I didn't know that I did not know that, but like I've never really thought of it.
4148.28s: And we know we also look.
4152.28s: So understand what I'm doing whenever I read these I try to think of like a couple takeaways, even if it's something that's not necessarily, you know, like.
4161.28s: Shocking or you know game changing, so I do think that that's one of them.
4167.28s: I think the other thing that's worth.
4173.28s: And we're getting from here is we learned about the relationships we didn't necessarily learn it from what they wrote.
4181.28s: But we learn more about the relationships as a result of what they wrote. So I still I still count that.
4193.28s: All right.
4195.28s: Let's see if we can do one more.
4200.28s: We have to go through.
4202.28s: Shit, we got to do I mean, I want to finish this little series.
4207.28s: All right, so we're moving it in reverse order, which is cool.
4215.28s: The shorts have no way to escape.
4217.28s: Unfortunately, we know that they did and do.
4221.28s: I also think a thing that a lot of us didn't necessarily fully expect was the behavior of the offerings because that also gives the shorts a very easy way out.
4236.28s: That's why when people hypothesize that the shorts are still open, which they could be I don't know nobody knows.
4244.28s: But that is one of the marks in my mind against that as a potential idea.
4253.28s: And it's primarily literally just because we really we really don't know.
4259.28s: But with the offerings that have come out, it gives them a pretty reasonable.
4269.28s: It gives them a pretty reasonable way to exit in my opinion.
4274.28s: So.
4277.28s: Yeah.
4278.28s: So anyways, let's continue.
4280.28s: I get my dinner order started here.
4284.28s: Let's see if that works.
4289.28s: Deep in the money calls used to create naked shares.
4292.28s: You can do this by the way.
4294.28s: You don't need to use AI unusual whales, which I am an affiliate for.
4299.28s: They didn't sponsor this.
4300.28s: I'm not plugging them for that reason.
4302.28s: They just have a tool that you literally can set alerts to do this.
4306.28s: So that might be a fun thing actually to look at.
4310.28s: For.
4313.28s: Game stop.
4318.28s: Investigate Mary.
4320.28s: Put naked shorting.
4323.28s: Yes.
4325.28s: Dark pool trading data from Finland show massive changes in trade behavior since January.
4330.28s: Huge increases in shares traded.
4332.28s: Each trade is of few shares in the key players known short funds.
4339.28s: Evidence for naked short trades and suppression of retail by pressure.
4345.28s: I don't understand.
4346.28s: Can somebody help me understand what they mean by this?
4350.28s: Supportive evidence for naked short trades and suppression of retail by pressure.
4362.28s: This I think is misguided.
4368.28s: The reason why I think that this is misguided is because.
4373.28s: This pits a false story that isn't actually reflective.
4381.28s: Of the markets and I'll show you what I mean by this.
4386.28s: This framing here.
4392.28s: Would lead you to believe that in terms of participants.
4402.28s: That there are the naked shorters.
4409.28s: And retail.
4412.28s: This is not the case.
4415.28s: There are still a lot of other participants in this space.
4421.28s: The reason why this matters is because if it's the David and Goliath game of.
4428.28s: Do I think.
4431.28s: Naked shorts could suppress retail by and pressure absolutely easy.
4436.28s: The problem is that there's a big risk for the naked shorts if that is their game plan.
4443.28s: Not saying that they didn't do it.
4445.28s: I don't know.
4446.28s: The reason why this is not the only other counter party that's in the market.
4451.28s: There are other massive institutions with tons of money that also like short squeezes.
4456.28s: It's not just retail traders that look for short squeezes.
4460.28s: There are literally funds built around short squeezes.
4468.28s: So because of that.
4471.28s: This isn't that easy of an equation of oh, if the naked shorts just up their naked shorting activity.
4477.28s: They can suppress the you know small week retail by pressure.
4482.28s: And it's like there's way more potential by pressure that exists than just that, which is really, really important to acknowledge.
4491.28s: Then it really makes their problem set way more difficult to manage.
4498.28s: Otherwise if it was as simple as this, then they absolutely could and probably would do this.
4504.28s: Like if I was on that side with their with their game plan, that's exactly what I would do.
4509.28s: So it makes sense in that context.
4510.28s: It just doesn't reflect what's actually out there.
4515.28s: Okay.
4518.28s: So let's continue to go through AI to detect deep in the money calls used to hide a few days.
4526.28s: I absolutely can see that.
4529.28s: Major short funds recent positions.
4531.28s: Okay, let's see.
4533.28s: This I'm on we've looked at this one before.
4539.28s: Yeah.
4541.28s: I I want 100%.
4545.28s: No, we looked at this before.
4555.28s: So one of the things I wonder if we'll get an update.
4559.28s: Oh, I don't think so.
4560.28s: Maybe because we're going from oldest to newest.
4563.28s: So if that's the case, we might be able to find an instance where there's an update to this because if the theory.
4573.28s: Is that deep in the money short calls are regularly being used to hide and move the FTDs.
4581.28s: Then we should see that activity sustained if the shorts are still open.
4586.28s: If not, then it provides a counter data point.
4595.28s: If OTC was being used to suppress retail.
4600.28s: Okay.
4603.28s: So again, dark pool dark pool is different than OTC.
4608.28s: This is again, it's there's a lot of really common misconceptions and misunderstandings about dark pool dark pool prints still hit the consolidated tape.
4617.28s: Super important to know.
4629.28s: I don't know if any call volumes used to create naked chairs.
4631.28s: I agree with this.
4633.28s: Price has started to move.
4636.28s: Yes.
4637.28s: A coordinated blocking of by orders on key retail brokers and media induced.
4642.28s: Fud help the shorts knock down the price and scare off some of the foam paper hand.
4647.28s: Again, here's the issue I have with this is that it's not acknowledging the fact that.
4657.28s: The larger grouping here.
4661.28s: Is not retail traders.
4664.28s: So because that is the case because the larger grouping here is not retail traders.
4673.28s: That.
4675.28s: And that's another importance of raising the price whichINK comes in to move forward for distance.
4684.28s: So in the course of completion, we have a particularこれで from somewhere where it is 60%.
4692.28s: involved in the mix. So that's, I don't know, that's one of my opinions on this. I think
4702.24s: that it misses some of what's going on underneath the surface here. But I'm finishing my dinner
4715.84s: order. And then I'll get into just taking a look at whatever you guys would like to take a look at.
4722.88s: So if there's any specific, I think somebody wanted to look at hood. I'm happy to look at hood.
4729.84s: You can let me know whatever you want to poke through. And then we can do that now. I think a lot
4737.68s: of what we come across when we go through these is it really is an interesting mix of information
4748.24s: that comes in at different levels. But the overall messages remain very similar, which I actually
4756.96s: really, I genuinely appreciate. I like that. The fact that the messages remain so similar, it
4763.12s: highlights the consistency and the pervasiveness of the broader issue going on here. So I actually like that.
4774.48s: Ginger says, hi, you don't have Twitter. I do. I'm on X. What's my thing on X? It's at outlier options.
4787.92s: That's where you'll find your boy.
4794.00s: I'm
4800.00s: Dase Wags says, running my coverage triangle and GameStop feels like it's out of steam. I've converted
4806.64s: some cash to leaps. Jane calls in a little kicker for upside. Are you still running your coverage
4813.60s: triangle? I haven't caught any update videos. Oh, that's funny. You must have missed the beginning
4816.88s: of the stream. Dase Wags, I do have it on. And I typically review it on this stream at some point
4824.08s: during it. But I have an update video on the position coming out tomorrow. So yeah, definitely still
4833.20s: running the coverage triangle in it. GameStop is a really interesting stock to trade from
4840.08s: a trader's lens. And again, I'll always emphasize that idea of a trading lens. The lifeblood of
4848.40s: in options trader is undoubtedly volatility. And something like GameStop maintains
4860.56s: really, really significant levels of volatility kind of regularly, like pretty much always.
4870.56s: So it provides a ton of trading opportunities. So if we take a look at, let me actually reorder
4879.52s: the. What the fuck? Why is that going over? Come on, you gotta fix this.
4909.52s: I think what I'm going to, I'm going to try to make these easier for you to see.
4940.24s: Let's do this. We're doing.
4948.56s: We'll make the line thicker.
4954.72s: We'll make it like a bright yellow. And then for realize, we'll do like a lighter gray,
4963.20s: but we'll make it thicker. Now there we go. That's way better.
4970.48s: I just want you to be able to see what I'm looking at this. I even think we can just get up to like,
4977.12s: yeah, that's good.
4986.40s: Yeah, that's literally that'll work just fine.
5003.84s: Cool. What I'm doing is I'm just trying to make it easier to see the the
5009.36s: vol ranges for the point that I'm making right now. So we're talking about why something like
5018.08s: GameStop is really attractive from an options trading perspective. And it has everything to do with,
5024.96s: you notice the relationship between this yellow line and this white line. The yellow line
5030.72s: represents implied volatility. The white line represents realize volatility. And do you notice how
5037.92s: frequently the white line is below the yellow line? It's essentially the overwhelming majority of
5045.60s: instances. So that leads to trading something like this really, really attractive from a volatility
5053.36s: trading lens, like pretty massively. Now the other thing that is worth talking about is the presence
5064.80s: of putsque. So very frequently you will find that puts tend to trade with higher vol
5076.24s: than calls. This is called putsque. And if we take a look at the vol surface,
5082.96s: you can see that represented here. Notice how the put side of the equation has higher
5098.56s: vol than the call side of the equation. Now if you've been following my coverage of GameStop,
5106.32s: there have been really prolonged periods where the call side of this equation is trading
5117.36s: way above the put side. But as of late, that's not in the case. It's been much more normal. This is normal
5126.16s: for most individual tickers. This is what you expect to see across most tickers, where
5134.72s: the put side will trade at a premium relative to the call side. So the fact that that is the case is
5144.80s: really, really interesting to me. And it's one of the reasons why I've made the recent change
5154.32s: in the position that I have, which again tomorrow will go into that a little bit more.
5159.44s: So not only do you get this really prevalent existence of vol, but you also get really strong
5169.92s: skew potential sometimes on the call side, sometimes on the put side. But that's the cool part
5174.64s: with trading something like the coverage triangle is I can trade either leg of it actually pretty easily.
5180.72s: So that's what I got. Anything else that you guys want to hit before we wrap up for the evening?
5197.60s: Man, I was just looking at how crazy how haywire volume went here and then it just
5204.56s: died. Really unfortunate.
5210.88s: Average volume has been declining for weeks. Average volume in this stage in here was like five to eight.
5225.28s: Something like that. And in here, it's like
5230.48s: about the same a couple weeks ago, but like the last two weeks, it's just been siphon and below,
5237.20s: which just kind of slowing down. All stocks will do this. We will see what the next major catalyst is.
5245.04s: One of the cool things is we always kind of know that they're likely will be one. So we'll keep an eye on
5250.32s: it. Sky says, what's your take on gamoscalping something like GameStop? No fucking chance.
5259.28s: No fucking chance. Gamoscalping on GameStop is psychotic.
5267.52s: There is absolutely no way. The reason for that is because if you think about gamoscalping,
5276.24s: a big part of running that is actively hedging with the underlying part of your underlying activity
5289.60s: is shorting the stock. If you have to scrub your deltas, that's part of what you have to do.
5302.08s: So there's no fucking chance that you would see me there long in at the money straddle or buying a
5309.12s: strangle. And then to actually gamoscalping running short shares, no fucking chance. And to be
5318.32s: clear, that's not because I'm completely in the camp of you can't short GameStop. I don't mean that.
5325.68s: I mean it more from the lens of if your short shares in a squeeze decides to go off while you're
5332.96s: in the process of trying to gam a hedge that fuck that. Fuck that because then you literally are part
5341.84s: of the group that's trying to buy shares. And again, you'd have the long options. So the the PNL
5349.12s: for it could make sense depending on how the position looks, but depending on how parabolic it
5354.80s: goes, it could not look good really fast. So yeah, no, no chance. I think it's a terrible idea.
5363.28s: Deswag says, still super confident in the thesis, you've changed my life, people go back and watch
5369.60s: this video. That's right. I am so stoked to hear that. You have no idea how cool that is to hear.
5374.40s: Been a lot of time just talking, sharing this stuff. So whenever I get a chance to celebrate with
5382.16s: somebody like you in that circumstance, I'm stoked to do it. So congrats man. Happy to hear that.
5388.56s: Darkmark says, any predictions on Palantir earnings? Let's take a look. This is
5395.52s: after the close. So I haven't looked that closely at Palantir yet. I was planning on doing that more
5403.28s: tomorrow, but let's see what's up. So market has a little excess on the call side.
5417.52s: Still pricing in higher put skews. So not necessarily showing huge upside skew from a directional lens.
5436.64s: Let's take a look at broader positioning.
5447.68s: And for these, let's take a look at.
5462.72s: We don't want deep in the money. Let's do out of the money only. Let's do single leg only.
5469.92s: We'll do it for the last week.
5475.44s: And we want to filter it by.
5482.40s: Do you want to use these two? We'll start without filtering by the expiration dates.
5488.56s: We'll just take a look at the overall order. So first thing, let's.
5494.40s: A lot of short calls. Wow, that's a shit ton.
5500.48s: Let's get rid of.
5504.40s: Bid side.
5508.64s: So this is unit accumulation.
5516.08s: Going out there to the 150s like this.
5520.24s: These really long term. It's a completely different idea.
5525.28s: So it does look like there's some speculative.
5531.44s: Bullish positioning. I definitely would wager that.
5535.92s: Yeah, because I mean.
5546.56s: From coming in above the offer, the majority of these are on the call side.
5553.04s: So this is to me.
5558.48s: Speculating more heavily. Now a lot of these are pretty far out in time.
5566.40s: So let's take a look at.
5575.44s: I want to restrict the DTE.
5578.80s: So let's take a look at stuff that's within 30 days.
5582.16s: Okay.
5595.36s: Now what I'm going to do is gain more context.
5602.16s: What I've done is I opened up the window to the last.
5606.72s: 30 days and I'm actually going to open it up even more.
5609.60s: We'll go back.
5613.44s: Let's just go back to the beginning of the year.
5616.88s: The reason why I'm doing this is because it gives me an idea of how large
5625.60s: these trades are relative.
5627.20s: Right. So you can see that there's only a handful of these million plus size trades.
5633.84s: And a lot of them are actually on the put side.
5636.48s: So then as we zoom in closer to the last week.
5642.24s: And we see this kind of trading activity.
5647.68s: Where there's a.
5650.32s: Mill and a half order.
5652.32s: But then you'll also see that there's quite a few 500K and up size positions.
5662.64s: And most of them are in near term, meaning these are 12 DTE.
5672.40s: And they're out of the money calls.
5676.48s: So this is a pretty important.
5681.68s: And indication to me that it does look like there's more speculative
5689.44s: upside positioning going on now.
5692.96s: So now we can click in again.
5699.68s: And the first thing that I want to do again is just see.
5706.56s: That.
5711.20s: So this very much looks like.
5714.00s: Pretty strong.
5716.80s: Bullish positioning.
5719.12s: Coming into earnings.
5720.88s: Let's take a look at.
5724.40s: No.
5728.56s: No.
5729.36s: Oh, here we go.
5733.44s: Okay.
5741.60s: Yeah.
5746.56s: Yeah, look at this.
5750.16s: So the OI for the front explorations is massive.
5756.64s: And it's pretty much broad positive build out.
5764.64s: Which I mean, to me would make complete sense, right?
5768.88s: A lot of this is going to be from people trying to set up for their earnings place.
5786.88s: We don't really need.
5791.12s: The ton.
5798.48s: Yeah.
5803.36s: Net net from a positioning perspective.
5806.24s: It does look like.
5809.12s: Broadly.
5813.76s: Positioning for an expectation to the upside.
5825.28s: Yeah.
5828.80s: That's what I would take away.
5834.56s: There's some pretty decent size trades too.
5845.44s: But this itself is a pretty telling story with respect to that to be honest.
5850.16s: I mean, overall volume is by side.
5852.16s: Yeah.
5852.80s: It looks like people are positioning for upside, which I think makes sense given the broader context of it.
5857.84s: If we actually go back and we look at its prior earnings, which I think this has, yeah.
5862.56s: So if we look over its last.
5865.60s: Eight quarters.
5867.60s: You can see that.
5868.80s: The overwhelming majority.
5870.56s: Yeah.
5871.52s: The last.
5872.72s: Eight quarters.
5876.00s: You can see that.
5877.84s: The overwhelming majority of beats, meaning where the expected outperformed the implied.
5886.56s: They're to the upside.
5888.32s: And they're pretty massively to the upside.
5890.96s: It's literally only had two earnings releases out of the last eight.
5895.60s: Where it had a down move.
5899.20s: Two.
5899.76s: So.
5902.16s: From a general earnings play perspective,
5905.28s: this is also something that I intend to play, but I'll probably play it to the upside.
5911.20s: That is my.
5920.16s: Yeah.
5922.80s: That's my expectation.
5925.28s: Which is funny, right?
5926.08s: Because take a look at EPS.
5928.40s: It continues to miss.
5930.72s: That's very unique.
5932.72s: So.
5934.32s: A big part of the earnings release is going to be the forecasts.
5938.16s: But the fact that it can have this consistent of an earnings miss,
5943.20s: but still have that strong.
5945.76s: Of outperformance is like.
5950.24s: Again, really, really interesting.
5953.12s: Just take a look at this.
5954.80s: It's essentially missed on all of its fucking earnings.
5965.60s: Wow.
5970.24s: Yeah, looks bullish positioning.
5972.88s: That's what I see.
5976.88s: Sky says how much weight do you place on order flow?
5980.40s: It depends on what I'm looking at it for.
5982.96s: So there are some instances where order flow is just context.
5987.04s: There are other instances where order flow matters a whole lot.
5991.20s: So it's entirely context driven.
5994.08s: It's based on like what I'm trying to use it for.
5998.16s: Sky says like for me, it's hard to give it much weight because you have no idea what your
6001.52s: counterparties book looks like.
6006.72s: But.
6009.36s: It doesn't inherently matter what the.
6012.88s: What the overall book looks like because you already know what the counterparty's book looks
6017.04s: like realistically, right?
6019.04s: Like the counterparty to what you're doing is likely a market maker
6022.96s: who's putting on a bunch of trades literally providing market.
6029.12s: And they're hedging like that's what that means.
6033.92s: So you actually have a pretty good idea what your counterparty is and what their book looks like.
6040.00s: So trying to war game it from the lens of what's the other side of my trade trying to do.
6045.84s: It doesn't really matter.
6047.76s: But that's actually a poor use of analyzing options flow in my opinion because
6055.20s: if you use it more so in the lens that we're talking about here where we're understanding
6062.40s: broader positioning and why things are being positioned how they are, then it actually becomes
6067.60s: pretty powerful, I think.
6071.28s: And I'm says downloading from where I have no idea what that's in relation to.
6079.28s: Downloading what?
6082.32s: I have no idea what that one is. Sorry.
6088.64s: All right gang, it is time for me to bounce.
6092.72s: I hope everybody enjoys your weekend.
6094.72s: You know, I'll be in eight.
6095.84s: See all the.
