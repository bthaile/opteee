0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.70s: Quick update video before our YouTube live stream today at 5 PM Pacific time in a couple
7.04s: hours.
8.04s: Want to walk through the markets at a high level.
10.24s: It'll be a quick video because not a lot of happened today.
13.60s: There's a couple small things that I want to point out.
16.04s: I want to take a stroll through GME specifically as per usual, keeping that on the cadence.
21.16s: A lot of people are interested in staying up to date on the options chain there.
24.52s: So we'll do that.
25.96s: And yeah, should be a pretty simple one here.
28.56s: Now, I got to say hello from the other side because now I'm on this side of the screen
32.72s: per the recommendation of one of our discord members, which was probably the simplest recommendation
38.12s: on planet earth that makes such a tremendous amount of sense so that I'm now not in the
42.80s: way of things.
44.52s: So you guys will have to find something else to not be happy about in the videos.
49.32s: So I mean, we'll see what you guys come up with.
51.04s: There's always something I suppose.
52.68s: So what do we want to talk about?
54.76s: The main thing is this, S&P 500 and the queues did nothing today.
60.48s: It was a completely flat, boring day with these tiny little baby candles that just are
66.28s: not moving much.
67.68s: IWM, however, continued to diverge.
72.28s: This is important.
73.52s: The reason why it's important is take a look at where spy landed, take a look at where
77.92s: queues landed, and then take a look at where IWM landed.
82.92s: IWM is now essentially at the close that it saw on the sixth.
89.28s: The other two indices are still above.
92.16s: They're still rallying, although they've contracted a bit.
95.88s: This is important.
97.16s: The other thing is the S&P 500 as an index with the percentage of stocks above.
103.28s: This is using their 50 day moving average is cratered, even though this didn't move
108.60s: quite that much.
110.04s: So I interpret most of this as under the top level rotation and small caps are still
118.00s: seeing the brunt of it.
119.68s: The other thing I noticed is take a look at the sale volume today in IWM as compared
126.16s: the sale volume in spy and queues.
129.08s: You can see kind of how much of that candle or the bar down here is consumed in red.
134.92s: In this case, it's the majority.
136.92s: So if we take a look at IWM quickly, specifically, we can see the exact number which was 75% sale
143.80s: volume.
144.80s: So heavy sale volume today, hovering right around this point of control.
150.20s: This is an important level for me.
152.40s: This is also why I do not have any sort of long position right now on small caps, even
157.00s: though I do still find them interesting.
159.72s: And I think that there's still opportunity for them, but I think as it sits right now,
164.96s: it's just not great.
166.76s: And I need to see what it's going to do.
168.24s: Now one other admin note is various risk premium plays are still coming in literally
174.72s: beautifully.
176.36s: And I noticed that because we can see it even here in the Russell where various risk
182.96s: premiums have just spiked essentially from the ninth to the 12th, this is just expanding
189.96s: very meaningfully.
190.96s: And this is the short term, the RP is moving quite a lot.
195.36s: So I'm still trading zeros.
197.04s: I'm still using SPX myself, but another great opportunity here inside IWM.
203.32s: Now as far as SPX, I'm running a couple positions in here.
207.64s: I got filled on some box spreads.
210.60s: I can tell you what it was.
213.20s: It's the 30 aug 5,000, 6,000 strikes for 997.
219.44s: So those are a thousand point wide.
222.08s: And they have 18 days to expiration right now.
226.24s: The percent annual yield for the duration of that trade is 6.081 percent with fees included.
234.12s: It's like plus 0.71 percent over the current risk rate for the same time frame.
240.16s: So just a way to put money to work while I am keeping an eye on things.
245.48s: This is there's a really cool tool that well, it's kind of simple.
249.40s: Let's not church it up Eric.
251.12s: It's a very basic Excel sheet, but I like it.
253.64s: It's cool.
254.92s: And you can access it if you want.
256.52s: There's a video that I did.
257.52s: If you literally just type in box spreads, you'll probably see a pop up because not a lot
261.00s: of people are talking about that stuff.
262.36s: It's kind of boring.
263.44s: It's a big part of what I do with capital that's otherwise sitting on the sidelines.
266.96s: Because in this case, my money is going to earn again, 6.081 percent annualized return.
272.96s: That's not the total return on the trade as it goes out.
276.64s: That's really important to note that's annualized.
280.56s: The return on invested capital will be much lower than that.
283.32s: But it's doing something in the time frame that we're working.
287.32s: Because right now the current risk-free rate is for a one month is 537.
294.12s: And it tailors down from there.
295.92s: Two months is 5295 and so on and so forth.
298.96s: So rates are chilling out a little bit.
301.28s: There are still some kinks in the structure.
304.60s: So three year is at 3, 843.
307.52s: Five year is at 3758.
310.24s: And then seven year is at 3805.
312.88s: So five is depressed compared to the three and the seven.
318.24s: You can trade those kinds of relationships too, but kind of a boring trade.
321.72s: Not what I'm looking at right now myself.
323.96s: Okay, so that's that.
325.48s: Now let's pivot over to GME, GME.
330.88s: It's on a like GME.
333.72s: Didn't mean that.
334.72s: It meant GME.
335.72s: And I mean, you literally can't even see the volume, which is unfortunate.
342.64s: It's just so light volume.
345.40s: We're not, we're really just not seeing much happening here.
349.12s: So the percent by volume for today is 52 versus 48% on the sales side.
356.32s: Total volume was 4.4 million against 10.4 million.
359.80s: So just anemic volume.
361.36s: Now one admin note is I know a lot of people talk about the dark pool volume and how you
367.08s: don't really get to see the actual volume.
370.04s: There's just an important difference between dark pool, ATS transactions versus transactions
376.16s: that are internalized.
377.80s: They're kind of different things.
379.36s: So with dark pool orders, they still will hit the consolidated tape.
383.60s: It's just delayed.
385.04s: If it's internalized, that will not hit the tape.
387.56s: You're not going to see that.
388.72s: So if orders, if there's heavy internalization of orders, you're not going to see any
393.20s: they'll follow through.
394.40s: And that's one of the problems with GameStop.
397.00s: I actually don't know to what degree the orders are being internalized.
400.92s: And if anybody has good research on that, I genuinely would love to be able to take
404.96s: a look at it.
405.96s: If you have access to it, let me know so that I can take a peek, throw it in the comments
409.80s: below because I'm very interested in that question.
412.92s: Because we know that for GameStop, the off exchange volume is massive.
416.68s: However, if we take a look at the off exchange volume today, it was 47.64%.
423.40s: And the 30 day average is 52.
425.64s: So a little bit lighter than that.
426.96s: Now again, the problem with this is we don't actually know of this off exchange volume.
433.80s: How much of it is internalized versus not?
436.52s: In this case, obviously, I would assume not internalized because we have a number.
441.92s: But this then doesn't help us understand what the total volume is that's been internalized.
447.12s: So yeah, I would be interested in exploring that problem set a little bit more and learning
451.20s: more about it myself because I do find that to be an interesting potential problem when
455.92s: we're looking at the reporting and something like GameStop.
458.88s: Now let's take a quick look over at the options chain.
463.68s: And there's a few things I want to highlight.
466.36s: First off, volume very light, less than 100,000 calls against 21,000 puts.
471.52s: Now it is again, good to see such a disparity between calls and puts.
475.60s: Most of it is centralized in this expiration cycle.
477.88s: So we are still seeing a ton of volume in this front expiration cycle.
484.04s: So as we take a closer look at the existing open interest, it's 669 to 337.
491.96s: So again, this is also good that the calls are being built out more and more.
495.92s: And we are seeing some of these other expiration cycles being built out alongside of it.
502.80s: However, the majority of what I'm seeing so far indicates kind of a quiet week, two
510.00s: weeks ahead from an options perspective, that doesn't mean that the stock can't pop off
514.04s: as soon as there's a catalyst.
515.56s: That's what makes it special and do what it does.
518.24s: But there's just not a lot of positioning expecting that is compared to what I saw when
522.20s: I originally got into GameStop towards the end of April early May.
526.64s: So we can still see a bunch of net ads coming in.
530.36s: So people are still building into these positions, which is not super surprising.
534.92s: And these 50s are getting hit pretty heavy.
538.12s: So there's 1869 for with 6000 added over the last trading day, another 1600 traded today.
545.24s: You can see that there's just a lot of volume on these near the money options.
550.60s: And again, this goes back into this is a tough way to make money.
554.40s: And these are swimming upstream because they need a big move very quick in order for
558.84s: them to really show a profit.
560.84s: Now these have a little bit more of a padding because faded decay on these is like 10 cents,
566.08s: 9 cents against something that's 64, 65 cents total or maybe 45 cents for these 22 and
574.44s: a half.
575.44s: That's still a massive percentage of the remaining premium that's bleeding out from
579.36s: faded decay, which is kind of problematic.
581.28s: You really need to move quick in order for this to make sense.
584.84s: What I see also of interest is, vol has collapsed essentially across the entire option chain.
593.04s: We only see slightly elevated vol in 13 in 20 set expiration cycles.
600.64s: And it has earnings on four set, which is really important to me because I would expect
607.84s: this expiration cycle, the six step expiration cycle to be much higher than it is relative
613.92s: to 13 and 20.
615.64s: The fact that 13 and 20 are higher than six and six is the expiration cycle that includes
620.72s: the release, at least as it's scheduled right now here, fourth before the market is fascinating
625.56s: to me.
626.56s: That isn't anomaly.
627.56s: That's not normal.
628.56s: You do not see that frequently, which again can't help but find that interesting.
632.16s: Now looking across, I didn't see anything jump out at me in terms of TNS time and sales.
637.20s: There's a glorious mix of positions going out.
639.80s: There's a mix of expiration cycles from 16-OG, 23-OG, kind of again standard fare, but
645.72s: most of these are really small positions, right?
647.68s: So the 125s, 334 trade went out, but they're trading for two pennies.
652.16s: The bigger trades are kind of these that have a higher price.
655.92s: Sometimes I like sorting by them not to see a million NAs that's actually kind of annoying.
660.84s: I don't even know why they put them in here, but it's to find these.
664.28s: These are the bigger trades.
665.92s: You can see most of these are kind of deeper in the monies, and we still see those far
671.36s: out in time, 125s, getting pinged off a little bit.
674.84s: Can't help but find that interesting.
677.76s: Some of these still look like the other side of the trade that looked like originally sold
682.96s: these.
684.32s: So, because there was a fairly large position over 1 million, notional value that started
689.36s: hitting these.
690.52s: But yeah, most of the trades that are at any reasonable size are not so, not at really
698.44s: high prices, what I'm trying to say there.
700.40s: So if I switch this minimum quantity being like a 25 lot, something, again, let's do 10
706.64s: lot actually, because sometimes people I notice move blocks of 10 in here.
710.64s: And if we look at minimum 10, we're not seeing a bunch of these.
713.68s: Now, these, again, further out in time, people building longer term positions, which makes
718.68s: sense in here.
720.92s: But yeah, nothing jumping out at me today.
723.48s: So that's all I got for this one is always, if there's anything you want me to take a look
727.04s: at, please send it to me.
728.04s: Love taking a look, doing my best to help you guys out, and also learn alongside of you
732.20s: all.
733.20s: And then I'll see you on the YouTube live session later today, be an outlier.
736.40s: See you guys later.
