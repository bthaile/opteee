321.00s:  Reese, we got Narwhal, Rapture's Lornt or Shlup, we got the game here. So it's great to see everybody.
328.04s:  And yeah, thanks for dealing with, again, the mobile setup. I know it's not as effective.
335.32s:  Probably doesn't sound great. Not that it ever sounds very good. I'm not an audio engineer at all.
339.40s:  So, you know, it's probably just part for the course for you guys.
343.16s:  SP Norwhal says, Eric, is there a way to check the options change from 2021? I'm curious
348.68s:  what the strikes and potentially open interest was during the January explorations. Yeah,
352.36s:  I've already looked through literally all of it. I have not on this computer, but I have all
356.28s:  of that data downloaded. The options chain doesn't look too anomalous. There was a lot of heavy
367.80s:  strikes for sure. And the volume came on pretty fast, but the, it was very focal strikes that
377.64s:  were busy. What I was even more interested in Narwhal was what did the options chains look like
385.48s:  like three months before January? And the reason why I was so interested in that is I wanted to know
393.24s:  when did somebody, whether it's not, and it's not just Warren Kitty, by the way,
399.72s:  somebody meaning whoever else played this move, because it wasn't just him. I was one of the people
404.44s:  that played the move. And the reason is because you could see it happening before it happened.
410.76s:  Now, what I'm curious though is who positioned well enough ahead of time to be able to get on like
418.60s:  size before the rest of the market caught on because I was not the kind of person that would have
423.80s:  been writing the beginning. So if we take a look at like a timeframe and we look all the way across
432.12s:  the most of the people like, let's say number three here was January, most of the people started
441.16s:  seeing what was going on like a month out. You can start seeing elements of stuff that looks weird.
447.64s:  But I'm curious for the broader timeframe before that how effectively did people start catching
454.44s:  on and seeing things. So Ricardo says, Newd might have that information. He doesn't. He doesn't have
460.84s:  options data. At least the last that he and I spoke, which is like he actually text me this morning.
469.72s:  So yeah, it's he doesn't have the actual options changed. Like I said, I actually have downloaded
477.56s:  all of them directly from CFO. So from an options trading world for those that don't know, that's
483.16s:  literally what I do. So part of the way that I build strategies is I maintain a pretty
490.36s:  significant data set that goes pretty far back in time. And it's full options chains. And the
496.36s:  reason why I use full options chains is because it helps me further analyze strategies and whatnot.
502.76s:  But to get that data is really expensive and it's not easy. So well, it's easy. Just not
509.48s:  easy to manage because it's really, really heavy. It's a lot of the file sizes are massive because
515.40s:  there's so much data that goes into it. So yeah, I literally have the entire chains built out.
521.80s:  And not just for 20. I have the chains from
526.52s:  continue. Well, it's not just segmented timeframes to look through. But
534.04s:  like the same thing you see in the stock, the options chains, they can be very, very telling
541.56s:  when you start to see volume ramping up changes in open interest ramping up. There's a lot you
548.92s:  can learn from the options chains. So that's one of the things that we'll go through towards the end
553.80s:  of this because right now as I view this, I'm still consuming all of the existing research.
561.96s:  And I typically try to consume as much existing research on stuff like this before presenting
567.16s:  my own research so that I'm not reinventing the wheel. I believe in groupthink and collective
574.76s:  intelligence heavily. So what I'm doing is I'm working on my data set and a bunch of different
582.12s:  studies to see what I can find that I typically would for any sort of ticker that I might be
588.20s:  trading or any sort of individual strategy. And in the meantime, I'm doing this with you all.
594.76s:  To learn more about the existing theories and strategies that we have, which this is the one
601.80s:  that we left off on. Last time, let me get this out of the way. Here.
609.40s:  A Ricardo says Eric, can you check Givo? It's written a lot, I think, since you're so good at
613.80s:  investigating, got in with DJT because you covered it. Maybe later, this stream is typically
619.72s:  a little more focused on GameStop and like the background of GameStop. If you hit me with that
625.72s:  on any of the other like standard live streams, always happy to. But we might have some time at the end
632.76s:  to take a peek through that. So I'm happy to take a look at it with you.
636.92s:  Bruce says, one of our key beliefs in the Moas theory, hidden short interest. If I recall correctly,
641.72s:  he was in the trade from valuation POV, not necessarily from short interest POV. I agree with you.
646.44s:  So I haven't seen anything from the cat that would lead me to believe that he's attempting to play
654.60s:  this for quote unquote Moas. That's not to say that he's not. I have no idea what his underlying
660.60s:  intentions are. But from the way that I've seen him trade it so far, it definitely doesn't lead me
666.44s:  to believe that that's the underlying theory that he's that he's trying to play. What I've seen
672.52s:  from his trades, and if you'll recall, we went through all of them. So let me grab our workbook
679.80s:  really quick. Where is it at? And then I'll show you. So here's the workbook. And then if we go
689.88s:  through this, this is when we went through back from the origin through all of his trades.
697.40s:  And one of the things that I definitely could pick up as I was looking at this is his approach
703.72s:  is actually really simple. It's really, really simple. It starts from a valuation perspective.
709.88s:  And then he employs significant leverage. And he maintains exceedingly strong conviction.
720.12s:  And let's the trades go because there's not a tremendous amount of timing that's tied to this.
727.48s:  And I still don't see any significant evidence of some sort of perceptive timing theory that
736.60s:  he's somehow figured out or broken down. I just don't see it yet.
741.24s:  And I want to be clear when I say that, that doesn't mean that it's not there. I just don't know
752.20s:  because I can't see it. And there's always going to be two distinct parts of the way that I
758.04s:  analyze stuff like this. There's going to be the stuff that I can see and can prove. And then
762.52s:  there's going to be the stuff that I might have a hunch about or an idea. And there are different
766.60s:  things. I can't prove anything related to any sort of underlying timing theory that he's employing
774.92s:  based on the entire series of trades we've seen him run. There's nothing in here that would
781.24s:  lead me to believe that there's a massive timing element. A lot of it has to do with holding options
787.96s:  actually what I would consider to be in a lot of really suboptimal ways from a standard trading
793.80s:  perspective. So that tells me the options are primarily being used from a unit building perspective
802.04s:  and definitely for leverage. So a lot of this stuff isn't trying to optimize for Theta Decay
808.60s:  as an optimizing for volatility. It's to gain leverage. And again, I can see that clearly from
815.64s:  looking through his trades. It's one of the main things that I wanted to go through as far as I could
821.96s:  is to get a sense of what was the overall approach because I'm not going to lie. When I first
827.16s:  started looking at this stuff, one, I had no idea that he even traded options. I keep repeating
833.96s:  that because it's so interesting to me. But like I genuinely had no clue that he traded options
838.84s:  just from the overall sentiment that I picked up from the community regarding options.
843.40s:  And then the second thing is it's also really clear that the theory that he applied came from
852.76s:  a valuation standpoint. And then after watching some of his really streams, you can see that evolve
859.32s:  a little bit in terms of like valuation, trying to be a value investor, and then what that
865.40s:  actually meant to him and how he used derivatives to amplify it. So his approach as far as I can see
872.44s:  is really simple. In general, in structure, it's very difficult to execute. It's very difficult
880.28s:  for any normal rational human being to see a portfolio go from 586 million down to 235 four days later.
888.84s:  Like that's crazy. Like that's crazy to go through that kind of cycle. But the other reality is
897.24s:  is that even when you're in any of these numbers, once you're in this threshold of numbers,
903.16s:  11 million plus, you're sure you might not necessarily be buying a mega yacht with $11 million,
911.00s:  but you are set for the rest of your life in a very cushy way. So part of the thing that I can
917.64s:  probably surmise from this is that he made enough that he was able to just kind of keep playing
923.56s:  the game because he also doesn't seem like a hyper materialistic guy. I don't know because it
928.84s:  doesn't have a massive social media presence, but that in and of itself tells you quite a lot.
933.08s:  So he probably has more money than he could ever need. His kid could ever need a kid or kids. I
938.92s:  don't know his family situation. I purposely don't look that far into it because it's none of my
942.44s:  business. I don't know. I'm not trying to dig into his personal life. I respect his personal life.
948.44s:  But this stuff, like the trading stuff, obviously I'm fascinated by it. And that's one of the
954.04s:  biggest things that I came across is at first I was expecting to see this really calculated
959.80s:  precise approach. And after looking through the data, it's not that. This is somebody that is
966.20s:  exceedingly comfortable with the risk he was taking on. And this is a proverbial lottery win.
974.60s:  Like that's that is the reality of there's a tremendous amount of luck that happened to coalesce
981.16s:  with the timing of his stuff. He almost went in solvent in here. Like he literally almost
987.16s:  went away with his yellow account. And who knows if he would have came back with another one.
991.96s:  So there's a and this is the way that opportunities emerge is he was exceedingly skilled in his
1000.04s:  analysis, which led him to come up with supreme conviction. Then from supreme conviction,
1008.36s:  he's able to put out a certain amount of really small starting amount of capital,
1014.20s:  $100,000. And he's able to say, let's see what this does. And you could tell by the entire premise
1022.20s:  of the original posts he did, yo low posts, that when it is a professional in the industry,
1030.52s:  when you decide that you're going to be super speculative with $100,000, you write that off
1035.80s:  and your mind has gone. Like you put the $100,000 in the account, you pretend it's gone.
1039.48s:  That's not the money he needed. This is just side money that he wanted to see what he can do to
1044.28s:  play out this thesis. He picked an he picked an amount of money that made sense to literally play
1049.16s:  a yellow. And we can see that it's evidenced by the fact that he absolutely had other accounts
1055.88s:  because we can see in the live streams when he was walking through his tracker with his different
1059.88s:  positions in his yellow account. It's just game stop. But then we can absolutely see that there's
1067.80s:  other positions that were in his tracker that weren't in the yellow account. So then it tells us
1073.24s:  there's another account, it's different positions in it. All this is to go all the way back to the
1077.16s:  risk tolerance. This is so different than what a lot of people in my opinion are doing that are
1082.68s:  trying to mirror what he does is most of the people that I come across in the ape community,
1088.68s:  they're all in on game stop, all in on just game stop. And that's fine. You guys know that I am
1096.92s:  the first person to advocate for each person to do literally whatever they want. And I am
1106.04s:  full, I encourage her of that. But I can also tell you that it's not what he did. And it's definitely
1111.16s:  not what I do. I have a position just because I and I've told you guys this a million times, it's
1117.32s:  to play with you all to be a part of the the movement in so far as just supporting you guys.
1125.00s:  Because I think what the apes are doing here is really important for markets and for traders in
1130.92s:  general. I really think that the education that happens in this sphere is incredible. And the
1137.08s:  amount of bullshit that's being brought to light from game stop as a vector is huge. So I feel
1147.32s:  like a lot of it's like support. Like I want to support that. But going back to this, this is
1154.12s:  clear that this dude, he had other accounts, he had other money, he had what he needed elsewhere
1159.24s:  so that he could play his idea out here. And that's what starts to let you go through these
1165.88s:  kinds of ebbs and flows. Because if you don't need this money, you didn't need it at a hundred
1171.88s:  thousand. And you don't need it at 1.5 million. Now he did take money out during these periods,
1177.24s:  which we can see, which is also super smart. That's him pulling some of the capital out
1181.72s:  as he's going along to plus up what he needs. Because then you get to a point where you can
1186.60s:  literally yolo millions of dollars because you just don't care anymore. Like he has what he needs.
1191.48s:  Mike, I'm guessing I would have my 10 foil hat on right now if I had it. Didn't pack it,
1196.44s:  doesn't pack well. And he has what he needs as far as I can tell. So then he's able to play this
1202.36s:  idea out because you can also tell you truly passionate about all of this. There's no reason for him
1207.56s:  to have come back. There's no reason for him to continue to post. There's no reason for him to
1211.72s:  show up with 120,000 calls with 200 million dollars. Like there's no reason for any of that.
1217.00s:  And it's the same reason why I'm sitting here traveling and I'm doing a live stream with you guys.
1223.40s:  Like I can see passion and I have passion not just for game stop but for trading. I am passionate
1231.16s:  about markets and I'm passionate about our community. So you can tell and I can see that he is also
1237.88s:  supremely passionate about all this stuff. So it's really, really interesting to see the way
1244.92s:  that his account is moved. The other thing that we can definitely tell is that there is a slight
1250.68s:  change in approach as we as we go through the individual positions, the holding periods,
1257.40s:  and the way that he actually executed the individual trades, which absolutely evolved to a degree,
1263.08s:  which is really interesting. Let me get caught up on the chat really quick.
1271.00s:  Starbeef says agree. Arche said many, many times that Moas was not part of his thesis. He said
1275.64s:  it would be cool but he admitted he doesn't purport it to understand the short interest data.
1279.16s:  I believe it was in December 16th. I didn't I don't recall that personally so I would take you
1283.96s:  out your word there. Strategy says he seems to wear the various settlement rules. Newton mentioned
1290.44s:  recently regarding ETF kicks with tweets mentioning or matching certain dates. I still don't see
1299.72s:  evidence of that. I would not say that that's not possible. It's entirely possible. And here's
1307.72s:  the other fun fact. This is something that is beyond an underlying suspicion but I genuinely think
1313.88s:  is the case. I think you guys are teaching him. That's what I think because he's smart but he is
1320.92s:  not smarter than everybody combined. And I also am like pretty average but I've been doing this
1328.20s:  a long time and I've learned a lot from you guys. So there is a near 100% probability that he's
1337.24s:  watching different content that's being put out about him looking at Superstong and I guarantee you
1343.16s:  that you guys are teaching him as well. So when it comes to the settlement cycles and stuff I can tell
1348.84s:  you from this. He was not trading settlement cycles. That's not what this is. But what I also can tell
1355.80s:  you is that if he wasn't aware of settlement cycles previously he is now because I am now
1363.48s:  because you are now because as a community you all looked into it. You all started pulling the
1369.56s:  thread and identifying all of these little pieces that ultimately fit together. So I believe
1377.56s:  without a doubt that he is absolutely aware of this point. Again he was not trading it here and
1387.48s:  I can see it right even this. If he's trading settlement cycles that's that's not what this is.
1393.32s:  You don't go from 210 to 289 to 586 down to 235 to 268 and then bounce.
1401.16s:  Like that's not the path. Because again if you're playing settlement cycles and if the theory is that
1408.52s:  he can essentially move the market on his own which to a degree he can but there wouldn't be this
1414.76s:  kind of portfolio volatility just wouldn't be there because there would be no reason for it to be
1419.16s:  there. He would have he would have compounded so much faster than this.
1425.56s:  Which is an insane thing to say because he went from 100,000 to like 600 million but it is
1433.64s:  absolutely the case. He would have compounded so much faster if he was playing cycles that he
1438.76s:  could reliably detect and trade. And again it's it's clear as day because if he's playing cycles
1446.20s:  you don't go from 47 million here down to 17 here. If you're playing a cycle why would you do that?
1454.60s:  It doesn't make any sense. The other thing if he's playing these short term cycles of 30 days and
1460.68s:  stuff like that he's trading options that are much longer in terms of expiration.
1468.76s:  So that also tells me that the propensity to be trading settlement cycles which we're talking or
1475.00s:  about 35 days so that's a different period than the things that he's trading and the way that
1483.56s:  the portfolio moves. So I want to couch all of that with the fact that I don't know. I really don't
1490.20s:  know but I can look at the path of what he's done and come up with the the best objective analysis
1496.84s:  as I possibly can. And if I were the one that we're playing cycles there's no reason to set things
1503.96s:  up this way. And it's the same thing with accumulating long shares. I believe that he's accumulating
1510.76s:  long shares because he loves the company and because he wants to be a part of it he wants to
1515.00s:  support you guys. He wants to lead you guys. And again from a military perspective you can tell a
1521.00s:  leader even though he leads in a strange way for what I would consider to be a leader but he's
1526.04s:  it's almost like the backman. He's kind of like the leader that you guys need. And
1530.92s:  he's that like that's why he's doing all that stuff. And because if you're playing cycles
1536.28s:  doing it with shares is also suboptimal because he's not as far as we can tell looking back through
1542.76s:  Newton sheet he's not unwinding shares. I have he reorganized this thing. I already gave Newton a
1550.36s:  piece of my mind for that obviously joking but I told him that this sheet was hard enough to
1555.56s:  organize or to navigate in the beginning. Now I just I can't find anything because I don't know
1560.28s:  where anything is. Is it here? No this is all GME specific stuff. He used to have maybe it's off
1568.92s:  to the side. He does that too. He took stuff off to the side. So it's real squirrely and hidden.
1577.40s:  What I'm trying to find is he has a thing in here somewhere that shows the share positions that
1583.08s:  he has and he just keeps accumulating. So most of the share positions that we've seen he's not
1589.40s:  unwound and he's continued to this looks like for the company.
1602.28s:  This looks like more GD settlement stuff. This is all settlement cycle. I don't know what this is.
1609.40s:  This is some max pain tracking.
1617.00s:  I really thought I was in here but clearly I'm wrong.
1627.64s:  How crazy is this sheet? The fact that Newton put this together for you guys is incredible.
1633.96s:  This is a ton of work to do and maintain. He's just he's so awesome. He's such a great dude.
1645.16s:  This is so cool. Anyways it's in here somewhere. I just don't know where.
1649.40s:  I know it's in here somewhere because you wouldn't have gotten rid of that.
1653.88s:  But yeah it's in there somewhere. Anyways there's a thing in here somewhere that walks through all of
1663.56s:  Vorinkitties positions in a stock position and he's accumulating. If you're playing settlement cycles
1669.72s:  accumulating shares doesn't allow you to participate because you have to unwind the shares to
1675.32s:  realize the game. So he's accumulating shares building more and more shares. That to me leads more
1683.64s:  strongly back to his premises is a value guy and liking the stock and liking the company and liking
1691.40s:  the company. So I think that the idea that he's cracked this underlying code that literally the
1702.60s:  entire community hasn't been able to sift out yet. I just find that to be exceedingly unlikely.
1708.44s:  Again it's possible. It's entirely possible. But when I'm analyzing stuff there's two ways
1714.44s:  that I analyze things. There's what's possible and then there's what's probable.
1720.20s:  And what's more probable is the simpler explanation that we went through earlier with respect to his
1725.72s:  approach. And my guess is you guys are teaching him now which I think is really cool.
1735.40s:  Stragis says literally the doing thump or matches the theory about various cycles overlapping.
1739.72s:  See the problem with that is the memes and we talked about this before the memes that he
1746.44s:  post match whatever your pattern seeking mind wants it to match. That's the trick with stuff like
1755.32s:  this. He could be talking about antagonizing market makers and drawing them on and riding them.
1761.00s:  He could be talking about a bunch of different things. And that's the purpose of ambiguous communication
1768.36s:  is it allows you to figure out what you think it may or may not mean. But one of the things
1776.68s:  I've mentioned about him before that I genuinely believe to be the case again as far as I can tell
1781.32s:  for my analysis of him is I think when he wants you to know what he's talking about he makes it clear
1789.16s:  and then I think when he just wants to play games and just have some fun and put something more
1795.40s:  obscure out there I think he does that too. Because as I've mentioned before
1803.56s:  communication is really fascinating it's one of the things we learn a lot in the military.
1810.04s:  And if you communicate so obscurely that nobody can understand it it's not really communication.
1821.48s:  It's because nobody actually knows what it means. Like this to me was about as clear as day.
1833.24s:  So when we see this and then this like this to me is him telling you what he wants you to know
1846.76s:  and it's slightly hidden message but pretty clear of a message in my opinion.
1856.44s:  And then he has other stuff that's just more obscure. Like this looks like a partnership between him
1864.60s:  and him and him right and that's kind of the point is that this this stuff can be whatever you
1869.88s:  want it to be. This is hello I love this so much. Strategist says analyzing the tweets is so
1877.48s:  much fun though. I personally don't actually have that much fun doing it because it's just not
1883.32s:  part of how my brain works. Like I deal more so in facts with stuff that I like really think has
1890.44s:  tangible impacts of stuff but what I find to be really fun is watching you guys analyze the tweets
1898.44s:  and stuff. I find that fascinating because the theories that I've seen people come up with some of
1904.60s:  them are so far fetched you can't help but love it. And I really I genuinely love that. So for me
1911.40s:  it's personally less of me trying to analyze his individual tweets I really don't care to do that
1917.56s:  but I love watching the community analyze his stuff because I think it's incredible. I think I told
1923.32s:  you this a while ago there was somebody from the community that sent me a thing when I was doing
1928.92s:  reviewing I forgot what I was reviewing about the caps and somebody reached out with like a series
1936.84s:  of color hex codes that were tied to like a Sumerian and if you guys don't know Sumerian is a really
1943.88s:  old civilization with like Sumerian language that then like piece together some sort of coherent
1953.96s:  message it was one of the craziest things I've ever seen but it was so cool that somebody actually
1960.68s:  came up with that I was trained up on a like this is nuts that somebody can go through this and
1968.36s:  it literally made sense like the the message itself made sense. So yeah the that's the interesting
1976.36s:  thing about all this because I also saw people do this with the what was it the emoji timeline
1984.20s:  and that is that's still people are still trying to figure that out there's absolutely no clear
1990.84s:  anything about what the emoji timeline actually means there's is many versions and opinions of
1997.56s:  what that means as I can think of which is again that's the interesting thing you can tell
2003.08s:  much like Cohen funny enough that he also enjoys just kind of playing around with people
2009.80s:  and he enjoys posting random things like this tits right and it's just to have some fun it's
2017.88s:  just to troll a little bit and play some games and I think the cat also likes to do that
2023.56s:  but I go back to my prior statement I think the cat when he wants you to understand what he's saying
2030.12s:  he makes it clear for what he wants to he wants you to see and understand which I do think is cool
2043.64s:  Bruce says any thoughts on his latest tweet personally for Rowan kitty I think his latest tweet was
2051.40s:  telling you to celebrate Christmas and have a Merry Christmas that's what I thought
2060.68s:  that's my guess Bruce Wayne says wonder why Cohen didn't take the salary only CEO to do that really
2069.64s:  it's a passion project Owen and he also has that like another person that doesn't have a salary is
2079.96s:  Elon but obviously he's rewarded in stock now Cohen buys his stock so it's a different it's
2086.68s:  definitely different but CEOs typically have different compensation packages depending on the
2091.80s:  company and depending on like what they're doing but there's not many CEOs out there that don't take
2097.64s:  a comp and it's 100% because he really cares about the company the community and he's trying to turn
2107.00s:  this thing around what a story that would be for him to to essentially save this thing so I think
2114.36s:  that in and of itself would be just an incredible thing for him because he hears the other thing that's
2120.60s:  worth reminding ourselves Cohen is fucking rich so he like again like he doesn't need the money
2130.36s:  he doesn't need the money he's rich so yeah he's working on a general passion project it definitely
2139.96s:  sets a really good message because you have to think of it also from a branding perspective and
2146.28s:  people like Cohen they're they're playing chess they're playing chess in 4d so he knows that one of
2155.80s:  the reasons why game stop is still a freaking company is because of the community it's because of you
2160.92s:  all it's because of the apes and the apes have made sure that the company stayed alive when quite a
2169.64s:  few periods the company would have been exceedingly challenged stay alive so from him you can almost
2177.32s:  look at it as really cheap marketing because everybody talks about how he doesn't take a salary
2186.92s:  so whatever his salary would have been you can essentially mentally bucket that as what he's
2193.40s:  spending in marketing because everybody talks about it and it's cheap even if you made half
2200.20s:  million dollars a year the amount of conversation of him not taking a salary provides is so tremendous
2208.20s:  that that's cheap it's cheap marketing now I'm not saying that that's the sole reason why he's
2212.20s:  doing it but I also know he knows that right it's again you have to you have to respect the fact that
2218.92s:  people like him they're not superficial thinkers they're thinking in layers and levels and that is
2226.20s:  one of the things that Cohen will absolutely be thinking about it's super cheap marketing and
2231.80s:  it provides a really great connection with the community that literally kept the stock alive
2238.04s:  he's full well aware of all of that and how important again that the apes are to the stock
2244.36s:  the
2246.52s:  ape involvement if you think about it is one of the primary ways that the stock is now sitting on
2253.40s:  four billion plus in cash because he's able to do at the markets when the stock was being
2259.64s:  propped up by both retail activity and institutional activity which is again a massive
2268.28s:  better in the cap of the company and its ability to persist and survive so yeah I think that
2278.12s:  there's a lot of layers to what somebody like he is doing but I think that's the primary reason
2282.84s:  why you won't see him take a salary it's just because it's really smart cheap marketing he doesn't
2287.64s:  and again like the the top line level items he doesn't he doesn't need the money like he doesn't
2293.00s:  need the money what's his net worth Ryan Cohen he's worth $4.9 billion dollars
2302.20s:  so he doesn't need the fucking money so for him that is a really cheap thing to forego and it doesn't
2314.04s:  impact his day-to-day life all not even a little bit not even a scotch not even a trivial amount
2322.76s:  not at all when you're worth nearly $5 billion dollars and here's the other fun fact when you look
2327.56s:  up people's net worth online it low balls it's so hard so he's worth probably quite a bit more
2336.36s:  than that so I think he's in a position most importantly where he just doesn't need the money
2344.28s:  then it allows him to position the message to be what he wants it to be now I would have to imagine
2350.92s:  if he if his net worth was $200,000 my guess is he probably would take a salary because he probably
2357.72s:  would need it in order to continue to make ends meet like most people do so he's fortunate enough
2364.76s:  to be in a position where he he literally and for those that don't know how much for
2370.92s:  point nine or just called five billion dollars I mean it's hundreds hundreds of millions of dollars
2379.32s:  it's more than he could ever spend it's more than the next three generations of him could ever
2384.52s:  spend and that's even being disgustingly exuberant with spending so the main point I'm making is he
2391.80s:  doesn't need the money he has more money than he could ever possibly need for generations he could
2396.52s:  go down 20 generations at least easy and pay for everybody for everything and they would all be fine
2403.96s:  so yeah it's it's just a co-alesting of two things the main reason that he doesn't take a
2410.60s:  salary because he doesn't fucking need it that's that is what it is and then he can position it
2415.80s:  to be different things which is smart it's really really smart on his part
2422.92s:  sweet so let's get into this one which is what we left off last time I'll trash this comment
2429.80s:  and let me know if this is too small on your guys' screen I can't tell because of the
2436.28s:  the mobile setup here I'll zoom it in a little bit let me know if that's better and this is
2441.72s:  GME is briceless oh yeah I forgot I actually have to zoom it out and throw it into GBT first
2448.76s:  also I downloaded the new version of GBT which has been really really interesting um what is it
2457.80s:  I don't know what they call it like one I think it's like a sigma sign but the new GBT is really sick
2467.16s:  I'm sorry I realized I need to just zoom this out for those that don't know the reason why I do
2476.60s:  this is this is the cheat code to drop this into AI to get a general overview first and then for
2484.76s:  us to click through it together the reason why I drop it into AI first is just so that I don't miss
2489.80s:  anything and that if anything really draws my attention we can hone in on it so summarize this article
2501.72s:  and let's see what GBT says and I need to reconfigure a few things
2507.32s:  all right let's add GBT here where's my other window this is the worst part about only having
2521.40s:  two screens I know it's cry cry you guys are over right but on my home setup I have more screens
2528.60s:  than I could possibly need in this case I am stuck with a peasant two screens really really
2535.24s:  tricky all right let's see I'm just getting caught up on the chats coffee donuts this so happy AMC
2550.84s:  is inside the GME it was annoying having popcorn supporters and everything see what's wrong with
2558.84s:  I don't actually understand the the disdain that those two parties have for one another to be honest
2567.08s:  it seems like there would be a natural overlapping symbiosis personally but again I don't know
2571.80s:  well enough I'm still very much a guest in the game stop house so you guys will have all of the
2580.20s:  background on stuff like that then that I won't know but to me it seems like they would be naturally
2587.16s:  symbiotic in terms of the behavior of looking at
2594.04s:  titty says it would be a great collab if only the CEO and board of AMC were predatory shooters of
2599.08s:  their own company oh I see okay I can't wait to see predatory AMC board working with RC people
2605.00s:  think AMC killed the GMEs squeeze and they were wrong to see I I just would encourage people to
2613.72s:  remember the way that the last squeeze went and to just consider what a future squeeze might look
2623.00s:  like and the reason why I say that is I'm hopeful that that might lead to people being less at
2628.60s:  each other's throats and more direct that energy towards the structure of things which probably
2637.56s:  deserves more of the attention versus one another that's the nature of
2643.08s:  control is you try to divide and then you try to promote infighting because it absolutely focuses
2650.68s:  attention away from other things as stuff is going on in the background so from a squeeze perspective
2661.24s:  I don't see how either one of those would be each other's enemy but again I don't know all the
2665.32s:  details I might want pretend to know all right let's see what this says the author the author
2671.16s:  argues that 2020 Federals are intervention which injected trillions of dollars in the market
2675.96s:  created an artificially high stock market while leaving everyday Americans struggling
2685.80s:  I don't understand what the injection here do you see this is a class issue rather than a political
2692.28s:  one large financial choosing to receive massive bailouts and look this wall ordinary citizens got
2697.96s:  minimal relief I don't know if I want to go into this on this one's a little bit I think this
2704.36s:  one might be a little too political for me but I'm going to make this up to water
2718.12s:  yeah I'm not so sure about this one
2722.92s:  there was your three trillion into the markets to large banks and portuguese cycles exos liquidity
2734.36s:  an inflated stock price are officially
2741.40s:  this you see you're going to require hold capital for every share they land yeah I don't know about
2746.36s:  let me I'll flip through it a little bit I don't want to judge it too hard right from the beginning but
2754.12s:  this might be a slightly different flavor all right yeah well this is the problem I don't think
2769.08s:  you could put these two together like if you're talking about class war that inherently becomes
2773.40s:  political because of the the landscape but let me look through this
2782.60s:  all right people are stuck okay if I don't really care for a lot of this I just want to see like
2797.24s:  the actual research that's what I care about
2807.48s:  actually first of all should demand back the seventeen trillion dollar bailout given a bank say
2814.84s:  I'm gonna I'm gonna pass through this one I don't that one felt a little different than what
2822.52s:  it was going for I'm always down to listen to different opinions and stuff but I want it to be really
2829.00s:  focused on like research that's what I care most about is like solid research
2835.64s:  so now let's see what this one is
2840.68s:  who goes down to here
2859.00s:  you can't scroll and move what you're highlighting which is a little frustrating but we get through
2864.44s:  it by zooming out super far it's really not that bad
2869.72s:  oh yeah also at the end if you guys want before we wrap up remind me I took a couple really cool
2874.84s:  pictures today there was like this super snowy section that we were driving around and then there was
2885.08s:  that that should be okay and then there was a really neat series of trainings that were like driving
2894.60s:  through the snow is really pretty let's see
2909.96s:  all right what is this kega we know this we know these
2925.48s:  so so leverage I do not disagree with that at all the and this is actually a really important
2933.56s:  metric to pay attention to um little
2937.80s:  so there's typically a chart of leverage
2956.60s:  um normally you would plot margin debt and stuff like that yeah like this
2962.04s:  so you can see from here margin debt is definitely expanding again it's still not massive
2980.12s:  but I can't go back far enough in time I don't think because I think I don't have the right
2986.28s:  because I don't have the I have a peasant account and free account with these guys so
2992.44s:  but the leverage is big and the leverage is continuing to expand so I think that the leverage
2999.56s:  does become a bit of a problem okay so re re-appartication yes reverse repose okay
3009.08s:  because repose cloud so what is this to us to the cycle theories which we know
3017.96s:  there's different versions of this that I've seen newton is looked pretty hard at 21 and 35 I think
3024.12s:  newton is settled on 35 and then also with the the holiday component though which is important
3030.20s:  because that that skewed things it has to be tracked um
3040.92s:  major spike for game stop could push a big player into default
3049.64s:  again this goes back to my question that I still don't have an answer to and I've asked it a
3058.44s:  few times and I'm gonna continue asking it because I'm hoping to see and so it looks like I'm back
3066.36s:  let me know if this is okay just the it looks like the wifi dropped real quick
3072.68s:  that I think we're back online there's not like a big snowstorm going on right now but there's
3078.28s:  definitely a good bit of snow coming down so my guess is that is a contributing factor recently
3085.56s:  well thanks we're in today oh well we're in today good to see you
3090.52s:  but back to what I was saying the the component I'm really interested in is who are the shorts
3096.20s:  because if it's a bank if it's a market maker or a hedge fund they're very very different
3100.92s:  in the way they look behave act and the implications of game stop going up how centralized it is
3109.32s:  all of those things matter a lot when we're trying to analyze the potential total impact
3115.00s:  which from this we won't know over leveraging treasury bonds short squeeze pandemic or liquidity
3123.32s:  well the liquidity is being siphoned out because they they are starting to take treasury bonds up
3130.04s:  we'll see see if prepared to wind down an auction rules anticipating a large scale defaults
3135.40s:  I don't think that it's necessarily an anticipation of defaults but I think it's in
3139.88s:  in trying to just increase overall market liquidity which is a really big
3148.76s:  like this is a continual focus for the market is providing as much liquidity as possible
3155.40s:  give me frequent t35 t21 cycles may produce another surge soon
3163.64s:  yeah I mean I don't agree with this I don't think that this is
3168.44s:  likely to be the case but yeah I think overall like what we see in this is about what we've seen
3175.48s:  before from an overall analysis perspective let's flip through it now and see if anything else
3180.68s:  sticks out to us dtc we already know all this stuff so talking about the defaults
3193.16s:  okay
3199.08s:  uh coffee says it's amazing the shorts can attack treasury bonds that's the bedrock of a system
3203.48s:  like is nothing sacred well I don't think you need about that like the shorts
3210.68s:  the shorts going up to treasuries
3216.76s:  what do you mean by that
3218.04s:  as of today I was to see approved auction plan you know
3228.84s:  transfers assets to other entities while pushing the damage to the
3231.64s:  amputee amputee can you take the ways all three of them dtsc usc or ready to pull the plug
3242.68s:  the the other thing just to be really clear when we look at this is the margin called
3247.24s:  doesn't trigger a default inherently a margin call is done to actually prevent default and it's
3257.00s:  to prevent widespread catastrophe so now if there are a series of margin calls done in secession
3265.96s:  that absolutely can become a problem and that can siphon out liquidity and it can absolutely
3272.36s:  to pretty massive problems like we saw an o8 but just this by itself doesn't
3278.36s:  they just i wouldn't make this conclusion personally that by
3283.64s:  running a march of call in a member that ipso facto we run it to a default because the other
3289.88s:  thing is when they get margin called the other thing that can do is raise up an auction for them
3294.12s:  and a takeover buyout a really good price for another company which is a way that we typically
3298.20s:  navigate through it
3302.28s:  should as close to hitting fan this be careful just i'm not saying there's anything wrong with
3306.60s:  it just be really careful when you read this because people you this is going to be beat over your
3313.00s:  head people are always always looking at the downside the market's going to crash the world is
3320.76s:  going to end like that that is a really popular angle that you're going to continue to see and
3325.56s:  talked about because it gains traction because fear is powerful so there's nothing wrong with
3331.80s:  reading this but just make sure that the subconscious part of your brain doesn't start
3336.68s:  stowing away stuff like this and then you start to subconsciously permeate into your conscious
3341.64s:  brain and you're like oh yeah shit's pretty bad or it's all going to go sideways soon it's just
3347.40s:  a bad way here's a great example of that in 2019 i started trading for my brother
3354.68s:  and he had a small amount of money and he's the only person i've ever traded for and i was actually
3359.48s:  doing really well for him because he needs the money so i was trying to scale up his account
3364.68s:  and then 2020 happens and key for whatever reason started thinking that you know the world is
3373.32s:  going to end this is never going to get better and have to take the money out in order to you know
3379.88s:  save it and as you probably would imagine he took the money out the account obviously stopped
3387.72s:  growing so i wasn't trading it anymore and i mean i i did done well for his account and
3396.28s:  unfortunately took it out market was fantastic 2020 was a great year and then he you know slowly
3406.92s:  started doing other stuff with the money so the lesson here that i want everybody to be aware of
3412.84s:  is when you read research from people negative stuff will do better than positive stuff fear
3420.36s:  cells so anytime that i'm doing a video and stuff and i've had different people try to consult me
3426.20s:  to help me make better videos better titles better thumbnails so that the channel will grow and
3430.84s:  continue to hopefully do better but one of the things that i won't do among many that i know would
3438.36s:  help me a lot is leaning into fear and it's something that i've done a lot of research on i know
3443.40s:  it works well but i won't do it just because if there's something that's actually bad sure i'll call
3448.04s:  it bad but i don't like the idea of fear mongering because i think that starts to prime people's minds
3454.44s:  to be in a fearful state things are going bad and i i'm very bullish on the globe on human
3461.00s:  innovation i think we continue to figure shit out so and i think we will continue to figure shit out
3468.84s:  but i'm not saying that this person is fear mongering i think it's like this is fear mongering
3475.88s:  shit is close to hitting the fan but i don't think that they're purposely trying to fear monger people
3481.32s:  tend to focus on this angle so this whole rant is just to make sure that you all are aware of all
3488.36s:  of those things i was just telling you about so that you can consciously filter when you see stuff
3496.04s:  like this so that it doesn't slowly build up in your mind and become a thing because that's what
3501.32s:  happens to people and that's how you end up like my brother taking your money out instead of compounding
3509.00s:  it massively spending it on bullshit that doesn't matter and then wishing instead that we had compounded
3515.72s:  okay k-gos those guys abuse what five times leverage and you just all would affect the head on the
3520.68s:  market imagine how bad leverage must have been abused by the law chooses still running today so
3525.48s:  let's actually take a look at that real quick
3542.68s:  this is what i was looking for there's a couple studies that actually talk about this
3549.16s:  that we can take over care
3558.12s:  yeee booy thick peak
3563.88s:  and let's zoom this in so that our friends in the back
3568.60s:  and peep it okay so this is from European securities and markets authority as sma they do a lot
3575.08s:  of different studies not just related to European markets as you expect and they used or
3580.44s:  k-gos as a lot of people did as a case study because there's absolutely a lot the learn from
3588.36s:  so let's take a peek says in march 21 the default of archaegos a us family office led to large
3594.04s:  losses for some global banks archaegos was able to accumulate large exposures to two and leverage
3601.56s:  on equities by entering into derivative transactions with bank counterparts when the price of
3606.60s:  the underlying stocks started to decline the firm was unable to meet variation margins resulting
3612.68s:  in the liquidation of this stocks by the counter party banks which is important so here are the
3621.00s:  losses that the companies various companies ate so credit suisse nomura nor is daily ubs and
3628.84s:  i mean this is no love lost right just to be clear the the losses are big
3637.16s:  this is a drop in the fucking bucket for companies like this so they do not want to consume losses
3645.80s:  like this obviously but this is also not what you see from what this kind of makes you believe
3655.80s:  those guys abuse what five times leverage and you saw an effect that had on the market it absolutely
3660.20s:  had an effect on the market no doubt but it's not like this big prolific thing that changed the status
3665.40s:  quo a couple big banks lost a few bucks and they were sad about it whatever
3675.32s:  i think they're all okay as indicated by the fact that cs is still making tons of money actually
3681.56s:  let's that would be fun to take a look at what cs did in 2021 for its annual earnings
3689.64s:  reddit suisse 2021 earnings
3698.04s:  so it had a fourth quarter loss of 2.17 billion in a full year net loss of 1.57 billion
3709.56s:  and it had a 2.7 billion profit in 2020 so then let's take a look at credit suisse
3718.84s:  earnings year over year
3725.16s:  and here we go as expected
3729.32s:  so
3737.24s:  credit suisse had 19.9 billion in 22 revenues you know real sad it's actually really bad for them
3748.84s:  28 bill in 2020 28 bill 19
3752.84s:  so the company is still making tremendous revenue absolutely tremendous revenue
3762.60s:  so the again just the point is mr bog shams says hasn't changed the status quo yet exactly
3768.12s:  and that's just because organizations like this are always going to be addicted to leverage leverage
3774.60s:  is the tool of choice for informed speculators it's why i use leverage because even though you
3781.88s:  have the ability to lose more money you have the ability to make more money and if you're
3786.68s:  glued at this you're less worried about the risk side and you're more content with the profit side
3794.20s:  so as long as you have good risk management approach which as you could tell cs was oversized here
3800.52s:  but people like Morgan Stanley UBS losing
3804.12s:  all right looks like we're back
3815.96s:  yeah
3821.56s:  and let's take a look
3822.92s:  okay
3825.88s:  so this is ms from 21
3829.64s:  fiscal year 21 net revenue 59 billion
3837.80s:  they were fine
3840.68s:  6.2 billion net revenues right so they they took the loss they had a losing position
3847.40s:  as anything does but as any good risk manager does they managed the rest they had a better
3853.64s:  spread in their portfolio and they were able to eat the loss it didn't even do rail them for
3860.60s:  the year which is kind of crazy if you think about it i had to pop in instructions we're meeting
3866.28s:  some folks that we met earlier today for dinner and i just got to see where we're going
3871.00s:  all right so it's like 17 minutes away that's easy day
3886.04s:  and it's cool yeah so we have plenty of time we'll probably run for like another 20 minutes
3893.16s:  dig it
3893.88s:  wait
3905.08s:  so let's get back to this
3911.32s:  I think we can pop through this
3914.76s:  yeah with quiddity through 2020 we don't know all that this talks about the settlement cycles again
3929.96s:  the one of the things to highlight for the settlement cycles is it's difficult to pick where we
3935.40s:  want to start so and then that can slide us off by an individual day or two days it just makes
3943.24s:  it tricky to manage and track
3949.16s:  all right so oh this is actually interesting i'm excited to read this one well we'll switch off
3956.76s:  after this one and just kind of bullshit a little bit about anything else that you guys want to
3960.04s:  cover but oh that's okay too far but i'm actually really interested because this is one of the
3965.48s:  the long-standing questions i have for apes is the exit approach which i think is actually really
3973.00s:  important in something that i don't truly see people talk about so this makes me pretty excited
3980.76s:  to see this is a part of a dd this is also a very long vertical
3992.84s:  fun fact though we are coming up on two-thirds through the dd from the diamond hand
3998.76s:  handbook which i think is a pretty significant majority of the different research that's been put out
4008.04s:  which i'm stoked on all right so let's see what this let's see what this one's about
4029.64s:  so you're shared during the short squeeze hey that's actually great
4035.56s:  this is great i love this i love that this is something that was put out do you guys know if this
4042.60s:  one was well received or not i'm so curious how the community reacted to this because this is a
4047.48s:  i'm just this is something i've talked about trying to think through a way to skate for me i think
4053.48s:  scaling out is the smartest the smartest way this is easier said than done
4069.08s:  this is good this is not good
4074.52s:  the reason why stop limits are not good is because you might not get filled so when we're trying
4085.56s:  to take an exit on stuff like this we using a stop is fine but i personally would use a stop
4093.56s:  market now the problem with that is you can get terrible terrible fills but you kind of need them
4100.52s:  because otherwise you might not get an exit so that's just something to be generally
4111.16s:  big peak
4113.72s:  lambago this talks about
4119.16s:  different studies for different approaches yeah this is rad i love this
4123.96s:  the one thing i would add on for an exit strategy is just to look at prior moves
4129.56s:  and to base what you think may or may not happen off of purpose so yeah i'm actually really really
4137.48s:  stoked that this person is talking about this this is rad because one of the ways that you can
4147.24s:  procure for shares of game stop if that's your intention is to have more money and the way you
4155.40s:  have more money is if you're able to play the moves we'll get this this will be leave off points
4163.32s:  or 28 December
4167.80s:  before
4169.80s:  Lee
4173.56s:  i love it
4176.04s:  cool so i'm going to kill this is there anything else that you want to take a look at i think
4181.40s:  there was somebody that wanted to look at a stock if you wanted to do that
4184.76s:  i'm happy to do that now as well but the quick recap of what we learned we learned somebody
4195.88s:  that was talking about an exit strategy we learned a little bit of due diligence around the settlement
4203.88s:  cycles leverage and the expectation of a potential kickoff effect from marginal calls and then we
4212.28s:  also learned after looking at the actual impacts to companies like credit suiz Morgan Stanley UBS
4219.88s:  is that although some of them did take some losses it really wasn't exceedingly consequential for them
4229.32s:  so that was a cool one and
4233.80s:  this one was about the fed involvement and liquidity so those are pretty interesting three ones
4248.68s:  i really like that last one michigan says the dd is done we never saw until phone numbers
4256.68s:  oh that's funny michigan says that's why i can't watch y'all too dumb yeah i definitely i'm ignorant
4261.72s:  i'm trying to try to learn that's for sure but you're not wrong my friend you're not wrong the other
4268.04s:  thing i can't tell you though is the difference between you and i is again you probably haven't seen
4275.00s:  the phone numbers yet because they've not come up unfortunately maybe sometime they will but
4280.44s:  i've been really fortunate in able to scale and account over the last 17 years that's
4286.84s:  done pretty well for me so i'm pretty confident and comfortable with my approach but yeah
4294.20s:  obviously you got to do whatever's right for you and i hope that you you have a solid
4299.16s:  approach that you're comfortable with that's the cool part about this whole thing is everybody has
4303.56s:  to do what they're comfortable with and what makes sense for them
4307.80s:  you just want to see you have finance bother
4323.80s:  i didn't see this
4326.76s:  yeah matter
4327.32s:  roryne city says michigan is a life where yeah that's cool whatever whatever works for whatever works
4336.60s:  for him the thing that i just remind people like him and other people is that what's right for
4344.04s:  you and what works for you is cool but that might not be what's right for somebody else so
4348.60s:  for somebody to think that their way is the only way is the epitome of ignorance and each
4355.56s:  person has to do is right for them that's what it boils down to that's the the concept of a marketplace
4361.24s:  it's how this whole thing works is people have to decide what makes sense for them and only you can
4367.88s:  decide that yeah
4375.72s:  that's my point 0.02 cool and then for those that didn't see i did do a game stop recap video
4384.28s:  yesterday just because i didn't do anything about it really during the week and we had an
4389.72s:  options expiration that's actually probably when i'm going to start doing game stop videos as i
4394.44s:  might just start doing them on friday unless there's other stuff that that's going on
4400.92s:  and you can see here the last options expiration was pretty interesting because we were pretty
4409.88s:  deep past max pain and we saw the market hold what i would consider to be some pretty pretty key
4419.64s:  levels so that was pretty cool to see michigan says he's probably paid a game followers and then
4425.64s:  when it's time when it's sell time he'll take the money and tell people to sell a k a gym creamer
4431.24s:  that's funny the fun part about youtube is i don't know how many ads you saw during this but it
4437.32s:  should be zero because i have the ads for the live streams even turned off so i actually make
4442.92s:  nothing doing this so if you want to pay me to do it though that would be sick that would be
4448.04s:  really really cool because i do spend a lot of time doing this and right now as i said i don't
4454.04s:  even have the ads turned on so i don't really make a whole lot on no income source so
4462.20s:  and if i apply your methodology then i just have to hold stuff so then i can't make money off
4468.44s:  that either maybe that's a typical that's a really difficult model actually as i think about it
4474.04s:  all right let's see if there's anything else that newton has updated year
4480.20s:  so
4487.56s:  proved he's
4494.20s:  interesting
4494.84s:  So he also is, he's flagging periods where he's expecting because of large stock movements.
4511.52s:  That's interesting to me.
4513.40s:  Yeah.
4514.40s:  Super interesting.
4515.40s:  Cool.
4516.40s:  All right, Kay.
4517.40s:  Well, that wraps me up from a head out.
4524.88s:  We're going to go link up some friends that helped pull us out after I got the car stock
4529.76s:  in the snow.
4530.76s:  So I'm going to go kick it for a little bit, take the amount for a drink.
4535.88s:  And I hope everybody has a killer rest of your weekend.
4539.24s:  There will be a live stream tomorrow.
4541.04s:  We'll figure out the time and all that stuff.
4543.76s:  And as always, if you guys need anything, let me know.
4546.36s:  Be in outlier, be in ape, be whatever you want to be.
4550.36s:  Catch you later.
