0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: you
120.00s: you
150.00s: you
180.00s: you
210.00s: you
240.00s: you
270.00s: you
301.00s: you
309.00s: learn. So that is literally what our game plan is for today is to do just that. So it looks like we
316.28s: got packs from Australia Beach Bum. We got Reese. We got Narwhal. Rapture's learned or Shlup. We
325.56s: got the game here. So it's great to see everybody. And yeah, thanks for dealing with again the mobile
331.56s: setup. I know it's not as effective. Probably doesn't sound great. Not that it ever sounds very good.
337.80s: I'm not an audio engineer at all. So you know, it's probably just part for the course for you guys.
343.24s: As P. Norwhal says, Eric, is there a way to check the options change from 2021? I'm curious
348.76s: what the strikes and potentially open interest was during the January explorations. Yeah, I've
352.68s: already looked through literally all of it. I have not on this computer, but I have all of that data
357.00s: downloaded. The options chain doesn't look too anomalous. There was a lot of heavy strikes for sure.
369.64s: And the volume came on pretty fast, but that it was very focal strikes that were busy. What I
378.68s: was even more interested in Narwhal was what did the options chains look like like three months
387.40s: before January? And the reason why I was so interested in that is I wanted to know when did
395.64s: somebody, whether it's not, and it's not just Warren Kitty, by the way, somebody meaning whoever
400.92s: else played this move because it wasn't just him. I was one of the people that that played the move.
406.12s: And the reason is because you could see it happening before it happened. Now what I'm curious,
412.04s: though, is who positioned well enough ahead of time to be able to get on size before the rest
420.12s: of the market caught on because I was not the kind of person that would have been right in the beginning.
426.28s: So if we take a look at a time frame and we look all the way across, the most of the people
436.12s: like, let's say number three here was January, most of the people started seeing what was going on
442.36s: like a month out. You can start seeing elements of stuff that looks weird. But I'm curious for the
449.72s: broader time frame before that, how effectively did people start catching on and seeing things.
456.20s: So over Carlos says, new might have that information. He doesn't. He doesn't have options data, at
462.60s: least the last that he and I spoke, which is like he actually texts me this morning.
469.80s: So yeah, it's he doesn't have the actual options chains. Like I said, I actually have downloaded
477.64s: all of them directly from Seemo. So from an options trading world for those that don't know,
482.76s: that's literally what I do. So part of the way that I build strategies is I maintain a pretty
490.44s: significant data set that goes pretty far back in time. And it's full options chains. And the
496.44s: reason why I use full options chains is because it helps me further analyze strategies and whatnot.
502.92s: But to get that data is really expensive and it's not easy. So well, it's easy. Just not
509.56s: easy to manage because it's really, really heavy. It's a lot of the file sizes are massive
515.24s: because there's so much data that goes into it. So yeah, I literally have the entire chains built
521.48s: out and not just for 20. I have the chains from continual. It's not just segmented time frames
530.44s: to look through. But like the same thing you see in the stock, the options chains they can be
539.96s: very, very telling when you start to see volume ramping up changes in open interest ramping up.
548.20s: There's a lot you can learn from the options chains. So that's one of the things that we'll go
552.52s: through towards the end of this because right now as I view this, I'm still consuming all of the
560.12s: existing research. And I typically try to consume as much existing research on stuff like this
566.12s: before presenting my own research so that I'm not reinventing the wheel. I believe in group think
573.88s: and collective intelligence heavily. So what I'm doing is I'm working on my data set and a bunch
581.80s: of different studies to see what I can find that I typically would for any sort of ticker that I
587.96s: might be trading or any sort of individual strategy. And in the meantime, I'm doing this with you all
594.84s: to learn more about the existing theories and strategies that we have, which this is the one
601.88s: that we left off on. Last time, let me get this out of the way. Here.
609.48s: A Ricardo says Eric, can you check Givo? It's written a lot. I think since you're so good at
613.88s: investigating, got in with DJT because you covered it. Maybe later this stream is typically
619.80s: a little more focused on GameStop and like the background of GameStop. If you hit me with that
625.80s: on any of the other like standard live streams, always happy to. But we might have some time at the end
632.76s: to take a peek through that. So I'm happy to take a look at it with you.
637.00s: Bruce says, one of our key beliefs in the Moas theory hidden short interest. If I recall correctly,
641.80s: he was in the trade from valuation POV not necessarily from short interest POV. I agree with you.
646.52s: So I haven't seen anything from the cat that would lead me to believe that he's attempting to play
654.68s: this for quote unquote Moas. That's not to say that he's not. I have no idea what his underlying
660.68s: intentions are. But from the way that I've seen him trade it so far, it definitely doesn't lead
666.36s: me to believe that that's the underlying theory that he's that he's trying to play. What I've seen
672.60s: from his trades and if you'll recall, we went through all of them. So let me grab our workbook
679.88s: really quick. Where is it at? And then I'll show you. So here's the workbook. And then if we go
689.96s: through this, this is when we went through back from the origin through all of his trades.
697.48s: And one of the things that I definitely could pick up as I was looking at this is his approach
703.88s: is actually really simple. It's really, really simple. It starts from a valuation perspective.
709.96s: And then he employs significant leverage. And he maintains exceedingly strong conviction
720.20s: and lets the trades go. Because there's not a tremendous amount of timing that's tied to this.
727.64s: And I still don't see any significant evidence of some sort of perceptive timing theory that
736.68s: he's somehow figured out or broken down. I just don't see it yet.
741.40s: And I want to be clear when I say that, that doesn't mean that it's not there. I just don't know
752.28s: because I can't see it. And there's always going to be two distinct parts of the way that I
758.12s: analyze stuff like this. There's going to be the stuff that I can see and can prove. And then
762.60s: there's going to be the stuff that I might have a hunch about or an idea. And there are different
766.76s: things. I can't prove anything related to any sort of underlying timing theory that he's employing
775.00s: based on the entire series of trades we've seen him run. There's nothing in here that would
781.32s: lead me to believe that there's a massive timing element. A lot of it has to do with holding
787.32s: options, actually what I would consider to be in a lot of really suboptimal ways from a standard
793.56s: trading perspective. So that tells me the options are primarily being used from a unit building
800.28s: perspective and definitely for leverage. So a lot of this stuff isn't trying to optimize for
808.12s: Theta Decay. It's an optimizing for volatility. It's to gain leverage. And again, I can see that
814.68s: clearly from looking through his trades. It's one of the main things that I wanted to go through
820.44s: as far as I could is to get a sense of what was the overall approach because I'm not going to lie.
826.68s: When I first started looking at this stuff, one, I had no idea that he even traded options. I
833.48s: keep repeating that because it's so interesting to me. But like I genuinely had no clue that he
837.32s: traded options just from the overall sentiment that I picked up from the community regarding options.
843.48s: And then the second thing is it's also really clear that the theory that he applied came from
852.84s: a valuation standpoint. And then after watching some of his really streams, you can see that evolve
859.40s: a little bit in terms of like valuation, trying to be a value investor and then what that actually
865.80s: meant to him and how he used derivatives to amplify it. So his approach as far as I can see is
873.64s: really simple. In general, in structure, it's very difficult to execute. It's very difficult
880.44s: for any normal rational human being to see a portfolio go from 586 million down to 235 four days later.
888.92s: Like that's crazy. Like that's crazy to go through that kind of cycle. But the other reality is
897.40s: that even when you're in any of these numbers, once you're in this threshold of numbers,
903.08s: right, 11 million plus like you're sure you might not necessarily be buying a mega yacht
909.88s: with 11 million dollars, but you are set for the rest of your life in a very cushy kind of way.
915.08s: So part of the thing that I can probably surmise from this is that he made enough that he was able
922.60s: to just kind of keep playing the game because he also doesn't seem like a hyper materialistic guy.
928.04s: I don't know because it doesn't have a massive social media presence, but that in and of itself
931.64s: tells you quite a lot. So he probably has more money than he could ever need his kid could ever need
938.28s: kid or kids. I don't know his family situation. I purposely don't look that far into it because
942.04s: it's none of my business. I don't know him. I'm not trying to dig into his personal life. That's
946.60s: I respect his personal life. But this stuff, like the trading stuff, obviously I'm fascinated by it.
952.84s: And that it's one of the biggest things that I came across is at first I was expecting to see this
958.36s: really calculated precise approach. And after looking through the data, it's not that.
965.08s: This is somebody that is exceedingly comfortable with the risk he was taking on. And this is a proverbial
973.64s: lottery win. Like that's that is the reality of there's a tremendous amount of luck that happened
980.44s: to coalesce with the timing of his stuff. He almost went insolvent in here. Like he he literally
986.12s: almost went away with his yellow account. And who knows if he would have came back with another one.
992.12s: So there's a and this is the way that opportunities emerge is he was exceedingly skilled in his analysis
1001.72s: which led him to come up with supreme conviction. Then from supreme conviction, he's able to put out
1010.36s: a certain amount of really small starting amount of capital, $100,000. And he's able to say,
1017.88s: let's see what this does. And you could tell by the entire premise of the original posts he did,
1023.88s: yellow posts that when it is a professional in the industry, when you decide that you're going to
1032.76s: be super speculative with $100,000, you write that off and your mind has gone. Like you put the $100,000
1037.88s: in the account, you pretend it's gone. That's not the money he needed. This is just side money
1042.84s: that he wanted to see what he can do to play out this thesis. He picked in him, he picked an
1046.84s: amount of money that made sense to literally play a yellow. And we can see that it's evidenced by the
1053.48s: fact that he absolutely had other accounts because we can see in the live streams when he was walking
1058.60s: through his tracker with his different positions in his yellow account. It's just GameStop. But then we
1065.16s: can absolutely see that there's other positions that were in his tracker that weren't in the yellow
1071.80s: account. So then it tells us there's another account with different positions in it. All this is
1076.04s: to go all the way back to the risk tolerance. This is so different than what a lot of people in my
1081.72s: opinion are doing that are trying to mirror what he does is most of the people that I come across
1086.84s: in the ape community, they're all in on GameStop, all in on just GameStop. And that's fine. You
1096.12s: guys know that I am the first person to advocate for each person to do literally whatever they want.
1103.40s: And I'm well, I encourage her of that. But I can also tell you that this is not what he did. And it's
1110.92s: definitely not what I do. I have a position just because I and I've told you guys this a million times.
1116.52s: It's to play with you all to be a part of the movement in so far as just supporting you guys
1125.08s: because I think what the apes are doing here is really important for markets and for traders in
1131.00s: general. I really think that the education that happens in this sphere is incredible. And
1137.00s: the amount of bullshit that's being brought to light from GameStop as a vector is huge. So
1145.00s: I feel like a lot of it's like support. Like I want to support that. But going back to this,
1153.80s: this is clear that this dude, he had other accounts, he had other money, he had what he needed elsewhere
1159.32s: so that he could play his idea out here. And that's what starts to let you go through these
1165.96s: kinds of ebbs and flows. Because if you don't need this money, you didn't need it at 100,000.
1172.68s: And you don't need it at 1.5 million. Now he did take money out during these periods, which we can see,
1177.96s: which is also super smart. That's him pulling some of the capital out as he's going along to
1183.00s: plus up what he needs. Because then you get to a point where you can literally yo-low millions of
1188.28s: dollars because you don't care anymore. Like he has what he needs. Mike, I'm guessing. I would have
1193.48s: my 10-foil hat on right now if I had it. Didn't pack it. It doesn't pack well. And he has what he needs
1199.32s: as far as I can tell. So then he's able to play this idea out. Because you can also tell you
1204.20s: truly passionate about all of this. There's no reason for him to have come back. There's no reason
1209.40s: for him to continue to post. There's no reason for him to show up with 120,000 calls with 200
1214.76s: million dollars. Like there's no reason for any of that. And it's the same reason why I'm sitting
1221.08s: here traveling and I'm doing a live stream with you guys. Like I can see passion. And I have
1227.08s: passion not just for game stop, but for trading. I am passionate about markets and I'm passionate
1232.84s: about our community. So you can tell and I can see that he is also supremely passionate about
1239.32s: all this stuff. So it's really, really interesting to see the way that his account has moved.
1247.56s: The other thing that we can definitely tell is that there is a slight change in approach.
1252.04s: As we go through the individual positions, the holding periods, and the way that he actually
1258.84s: executed the individual trains, which absolutely evolved to a degree, which is really interesting.
1265.88s: Let me get caught up on the chat really quick.
1271.08s: Starbeef says, agreed. Arche said many, many times that Moas was not part of his thesis. He said
1275.80s: it would be cool, but he admitted it doesn't purport it to understand the short interest data.
1279.32s: I believe it was in December 16th. I didn't I don't recall that personally. So I would take you
1284.04s: at your word there. Strategy says he seems to wear the various settlement rules. Newton mentioned it
1290.60s: recently regarding ETF kicks with tweets mentioning or matching certain dates. I still don't see
1299.88s: evidence of that. I would not say that that's not possible. It's entirely possible.
1307.16s: And here's the other fun fact. This is something that is beyond an underlying suspicion,
1312.76s: but I genuinely think is the case. I think you guys are teaching him. That's what I think.
1317.40s: Because he's smart, but he is not smarter than everybody combined. And I also am like pretty average,
1327.40s: but I've been doing this a long time. And I've learned a lot from you guys. So there is a near 100
1335.72s: percent probability that he's watching different content that's being put out about him looking
1340.20s: at Superstong. And I guarantee you that you guys are teaching him as well. So when it comes to the
1347.16s: settlement cycles and stuff, I can tell you from this, he was not trading settlement cycles.
1352.20s: Like that's not what this is. But what I also can tell you is that if he wasn't aware of settlement
1359.32s: cycles previously, he is now because I am now because you are now because as a community,
1366.76s: you all looked into it. You all started pulling the thread and identifying all of these little
1373.32s: pieces that ultimately fit together. So I believe without a doubt that he is absolutely aware at
1382.68s: this point. Again, he was not trading here. And I can see it, right? Even this, if he's trading
1390.68s: settlement cycles, that's that's not what this is. You don't go from 210 to 289 to 586 down to
1396.76s: 235 to 268. And then bounced. Like that's that's not the that's not the path. Because again, like
1405.88s: if you're playing settlement cycles, and if the theory is that he can essentially move the market
1410.04s: on his own, which to a degree, he can. But the there wouldn't be this kind of portfolio volatility,
1416.76s: just wouldn't be there because there would be no reason for it to be there. He would have he would
1420.44s: have compounded so much faster than this. Which is an insane thing to say because he went from 100,000
1429.40s: to fucking 600 million. But it is absolutely the case. He would have compounded so much faster.
1436.20s: If he was playing cycles that he could reliably detect and trade. And again, it's it's clear
1443.88s: as day because if he's playing cycles, you don't go from 47 million here down to 17 here.
1450.92s: That why why if you're playing a cycle, why why would you do that? It doesn't make any sense.
1456.28s: The other thing if he's playing these short term cycles of 30 days and stuff like that,
1461.72s: he's trading options that are much longer in terms of expiration. So that also tells me that the
1471.88s: propensity to be trading settlement cycles, which we're talking are about 35 days. So that's a
1480.04s: different period than the things that he's trading and then the way that the portfolio moves.
1485.40s: So I want to couch all of that with the fact that I don't know. I really don't know. But I can look
1492.04s: at the path of what he's done and come up with the the best objective analysis as I possibly can.
1498.68s: And if I were the one that we're playing cycles, there's no reason to set things up this way.
1505.96s: And it's the same thing with accumulating long shares. I believe that he's accumulating long shares
1511.48s: because he loves the company and because he wants to be a part of it. He wants to support you guys.
1515.88s: He wants to lead you guys. And again, from a military perspective, you can tell a leader even though
1522.04s: he leads in a strange way for what I would consider to be a leader. But he's it's almost like the
1526.92s: backman. He's kind of like the leader that you guys need. And his that like that's why he's doing
1533.48s: all that stuff. And because if you're playing cycles, doing it with shares is also suboptimal because
1539.64s: he's not as far as we can tell looking back through Newton sheet, he's not unwinding shares. I have
1547.48s: he reorganized this thing. I already gave Newton a piece of my mind for that. Obviously joking.
1553.08s: But I told him that this sheet was hard enough to organize or to navigate in the beginning. Now,
1558.44s: I just I can't find anything because I don't know where anything is.
1563.08s: Is it here? No, this is all GME specific stuff.
1566.52s: He used to have maybe it's off to the side. He does that too. He took stuff off to the side.
1572.60s: So it's real squirreling and hidden.
1574.60s: And what I'm trying to find is he has a thing in here somewhere that shows the share positions that he has.
1583.72s: And he just keeps accumulating. So most of the share positions that we've seen, he's not unwound.
1590.92s: And he's continued to this looks like for the company.
1596.36s: This looks like more GD settlement stuff. This is all settlement cycle.
1607.88s: I don't know what this is. This is some max pain tracking.
1617.16s: I really thought I was in here, but clearly I'm wrong.
1625.88s: How crazy is this sheet? The fact that Newton put this together for you guys is incredible.
1635.08s: This is a ton of work to do and maintain. He's just he's so awesome. He's such a great dude.
1645.32s: This is so cool. Anyways, it's in here somewhere. I just don't know where.
1649.48s: I know it's in here somewhere because you wouldn't have gotten rid of that.
1653.08s: But yeah, it's been there somewhere.
1657.32s: Anyways, there's a thing in here somewhere that walks through all of
1663.56s: Vorinkittie's positions in a stock position. And he's accumulating.
1667.56s: If you're playing settlement cycles, accumulating shares doesn't allow you to participate
1672.76s: because you have to unwind the shares to realize the game.
1677.16s: So he's accumulating shares, building more and more shares.
1681.00s: That to me leads more strongly back to his premises.
1685.96s: It's a value guy in liking the stock and liking the company and liking Cone.
1692.68s: So I think that the idea that he's cracked this underlying code
1701.40s: that literally the entire community hasn't been able to sift out yet,
1705.88s: I just find that to be exceedingly unlikely. Again, it's possible.
1709.88s: It's entirely possible. But when I'm analyzing stuff, there's two ways that I analyze things.
1715.72s: There's what's possible and then there's what's probable.
1720.28s: And what's more probable is the simpler explanation that we went through earlier
1724.92s: with respect to his approach. And my guess is you guys are teaching him now, which I think is really cool.
1735.48s: Stragis says literally the doing thump or matches the theory about various cycles overlapping.
1739.80s: See, the problem with that is the memes. And we talked about this before.
1745.72s: The memes that he post match whatever your pattern seeking mind wants it to match.
1752.76s: That's the trick with stuff like this.
1755.96s: He could be talking about antagonizing market makers and drawing them on and riding them.
1761.16s: He could be talking about a bunch of different things.
1764.12s: And that's the purpose of ambiguous communication is it allows you to figure out what you think it may or
1774.60s: may not mean. But one of the things I've mentioned about him before that I genuinely believe to be the
1779.80s: case. Again, as far as I can tell from my analysis of him is I think when he wants you to know what he's
1787.08s: talking about, he makes it clear. And then I think when he just wants to play games and just have
1793.96s: some fun and put something more obscure out there, I think he does that too.
1800.76s: Because as I've mentioned before, communication is really fascinating. It's one of the things we
1807.40s: learn a lot in the military. And if you communicate so obscurely that nobody can understand it,
1819.16s: it's not really communication. Because nobody actually knows what it means.
1824.68s: Like this to me was about as clear as day. So when we see this and then this, like this to me is
1843.00s: him telling you what he wants you to know. And it's slightly hidden message,
1852.92s: but pretty clear of a message in my opinion. And then he has other stuff that's just more obscure.
1862.44s: Like this looks like a partnership between him and him, right? And that's kind of the point is that
1867.96s: this stuff can be whatever you want it to be. This is loads. I love this so much.
1873.64s: Um, strategies says analyzing the tweets is so much fun though. I personally don't actually have
1880.84s: that much fun doing it because it's just not part of how my brain works. Like I, I deal more so in
1887.96s: facts with stuff that I like really think has tangible impacts of stuff. But what I find to be
1894.92s: really fine is watching you guys analyze the tweets and stuff. I find that fascinating. Because
1901.72s: the theories that I've seen people come up with, some of them are so far fetched you can't help
1907.16s: but love it. And I really, I genuinely love that. So for me, it's personally less of me trying to
1913.88s: analyze his individual tweets. I really don't care to do that. But I love watching the community
1919.32s: analyze this stuff because I think it's incredible. I think I told you this a while ago,
1924.68s: there was somebody from the community that sent me a thing when I was doing reviewing, I forgot
1930.60s: reviewing about the caps. And somebody reached out with like a series of color hex codes that were
1940.12s: tied to like a Sumerian. And if you guys don't know, Sumerian is a really old civilization with
1946.04s: like Sumerian language that then like piece together some sort of coherent message. It was one of
1957.00s: the craziest things I've ever seen, but it was so cool that somebody actually came up with that.
1962.12s: I was trained up on a like this. This is nuts that somebody can go through this and it literally
1969.00s: made sense like the message itself made sense. So yeah, that's the interesting thing about all this
1977.48s: because I also saw people do this with the what was it the emoji timeline. And that is that's still
1986.52s: people are still trying to figure that out. There's absolutely no clear anything about what the
1993.32s: emoji timeline actually means. There's as many versions and opinions of what that means as I can
1998.76s: think of, which is again, that's the interesting thing. You can tell much like Cohen, funny enough,
2005.40s: that he also enjoys just kind of playing around with people. And he enjoys posting random things
2013.80s: like this, tits, right? And it's just to have some fun. It's just to troll a little bit and play
2019.88s: some games. And I think the cat also likes to do that. But I go back to my prior statement. I think
2027.08s: the cat when he wants you to understand what he's saying, he makes it clear for what he wants.
2035.08s: He wants you to see and understand, which I do think is cool.
2043.80s: Bruce says any thoughts on his latest tweet personally for Rowan, Rowan Kitty, I think his
2050.44s: latest tweet was telling you to celebrate Christmas and have a Merry Christmas. That's what I thought.
2056.84s: That's my guess. Bruce Wayne says, wonder why Cohen didn't take the salary. I only see you to do
2068.68s: that really. It's a passion project. Owen, and he also has that like another person that doesn't
2077.64s: have a salary is Elon, but obviously he's rewarded in stock. Now Cohen buys his stock. So it's a
2086.12s: different. It's definitely different. But CEOs typically have different compensation packages
2091.32s: depending on the company and depending on like what they're doing. But there's not many CEOs
2095.88s: out there that don't take a comp. And it's 100% because he really cares about the company, the
2105.96s: community, and he's trying to turn this thing around. What a story that would be for him
2110.36s: to essentially save this thing. So I think that in and of itself would be just an incredible
2118.20s: thing for him because he hears the other thing that's worth reminding ourselves. Cohen is
2123.48s: puking rich. So he like again, like he doesn't need the money. He doesn't need the money.
2132.20s: He's rich. So yeah, he's working on a general passion project. It definitely sets a really
2141.08s: good message because you have to think of it also from a branding perspective. And people like Cohen,
2147.72s: they're playing chess. They're playing chess in 4D. So he knows that one of the reasons why
2156.52s: GameStop is still a freaking company is because of the community. It's because of you all. It's
2161.48s: because of the apes. And the apes have made sure that the company stayed alive when quite a few
2169.96s: periods the company would have been exceedingly challenged. Stay alive. So from him, you can almost
2177.40s: look at it as really cheap marketing because everybody talks about how he doesn't take a salary.
2187.00s: So whatever his salary would have been, you can essentially, mentally bucket that as what he's
2193.48s: spending in marketing because everybody talks about it. And it's cheap. Even if you made half
2200.28s: million dollars a year, the amount of conversation of him not taking a salary provides is so
2207.32s: tremendous that that's cheap. It's cheap marketing. No, I'm not saying that that's the sole reason
2211.88s: why he's doing it. But I also know he knows that, right? It's again, you have to you have to
2217.88s: respect the fact that people like him, they're not superficial thinkers. They're thinking in layers
2224.04s: and levels. And that is one of the things that Cohen will absolutely be thinking of. It's super
2230.44s: cheap marketing. And it provides a really great connection with the community that literally kept
2236.20s: the stock alive. He's full well aware of all of that and how important, again, that the apes are
2243.08s: to the stock. The ape involvement, if you think about it, is one of the primary ways that the stock
2252.04s: is now sitting on four billion plus in cash because he was able to do at the markets when the
2258.68s: stock was being propped up by both retail activity and institutional activity, which is again,
2266.12s: a massive, massive, better in the cap of the company and its ability to persist and survive.
2275.24s: So yeah, I think that there's a lot of layers to what somebody like he is doing, but I think
2281.96s: that's the primary reason why you won't see him take a salary is just because it's really smart,
2286.28s: cheap marketing. He doesn't, and again, like that the top line level items, he doesn't need the money,
2292.52s: like he doesn't need the money. What's his net worth, Ryan Cohen.
2298.52s: He's worth $4.9 billion. He doesn't need the fucking money. So for him, that is a really
2309.72s: cheap thing to forego, and it doesn't impact his day to day life. Not even a little bit. Not even a
2319.88s: scotch. Not even a trivial amount. Not at all. When you're worth nearly $5 billion, and here's the
2326.60s: other fun fact, when you look up people's net worth online, it low balls it's so hard. So he's
2333.00s: worth probably quite a bit more than that. So I think he's in a position most importantly where he
2343.16s: just doesn't need the money. Then it allows him to position the message to be what he wants it to be.
2348.84s: Now I would have to imagine if he if his net worth was $200,000, my guess is he probably would
2356.36s: take a salary because he probably would need it in order to continue to make ends meet like most
2361.88s: people do. So he's fortunate enough to be in a position where he literally, and for those that
2368.36s: don't know how much for 0.9 or just call it $5 billion, it's hundreds of millions of dollars.
2379.48s: It's more than he could ever spend. It's more than the next three generations of him could ever
2384.60s: spend. And that's even being disgustingly exuberant with spending. So the main point I'm making is
2391.80s: he doesn't need the money. He has more money than he could ever possibly need for generations.
2396.28s: He could go down 20 generations at least easy and pay for everybody for everything and they would
2402.76s: all be fine. So yeah, it's just a co-elesting of two things. The main reason that he doesn't take
2410.52s: a salary is because he doesn't fucking need it. That's that is what it is. And then he can position it
2415.96s: to be different things, which is smart. It's really, really smart on his part.
2423.00s: Sweet. So let's get into this one, which is where we left off last time. I'll trash this comment.
2429.96s: And let me know if this is too small on your guys' screen. I can't tell because of the
2436.44s: the mobile setup here. I'll zoom in a little bit. Let me know if that's better. And this is GME
2443.00s: is faceless. Oh yeah, I forgot. I actually have to zoom it out and throw it into GPT first.
2448.84s: Also, I downloaded the new version of GPT, which has been really, really interesting.
2457.40s: What is it? I don't know what they call it. Like one, I think it's like a sigma sign. But
2464.76s: the new GPT is really sick. I'm sorry, I realized I need to just zoom this out.
2473.40s: For those that don't know the reason why I do this is this is the cheat code to drop this into AI
2481.80s: to get a general overview first. And then for us to click through it together, the reason why I drop
2487.40s: it into AI first is just so that I don't miss anything. And that if anything really draws my attention,
2494.28s: we can hone in on it. So summarize this article.
2498.92s: And let's see what GPT says. And I need to reconfigure a few things.
2510.36s: All right. Let's add GPT here. Where's my other window? This is the worst part about only having
2521.48s: two screens. I know. Let's cry, cry you guys a river, right? But on my home setup, I have more
2528.28s: screens than I could possibly need. In this case, I am stuck with a peasant two screens.
2534.76s: Really, really tricky. All right. Let's see. I'm just getting caught up on the chats.
2549.24s: Coffee donuts says so happy AMC is inside the GME. It was annoying having popcorn supporters
2554.36s: and everything. See what's wrong with that. I don't actually understand the disdain that those two
2564.76s: parties have for one another to be honest. It seems like there would be a natural overlap in
2569.32s: some of the AOS personally. But again, I don't know well enough. I'm still very much a guest
2576.92s: in the GameStop house. So you guys will have all of the background on stuff like that. Then that
2583.56s: I won't know. But to me, it seems like they would be naturally symbiotic in terms of the behavior.
2590.12s: What they're looking for.
2594.12s: Titi says it would have been a great collab if only the CEO and board of AMC were predatory
2598.84s: shooters of their own company. Oh, I see. Okay. I can't wait to see predatory AMC board working
2603.96s: with RC. People think AMC killed the GMEs squeeze and they were wrong. See. I just
2611.72s: would encourage people to remember the way that the last squeeze went. And to just consider
2620.68s: what a future squeeze might look like. And the reason why I say that is I'm hopeful that that might
2627.40s: lead to people being less at each other's throats and more direct that energy towards the structure
2635.56s: of things, which probably deserves more of the attention versus one another. That's the nature of
2642.20s: control is you try to divide and then you try to promote infighting because it absolutely focuses
2650.76s: attention away from other things as stuff is going on in the background. So from a squeeze perspective,
2661.32s: I don't see how either one of those would be each other's enemy. But again, I don't know all
2665.32s: the details and I won't pretend to know. All right, let's see what this says. The author,
2670.84s: the author argues that 2020 Federals are intervention, which injected trillions of dollars in
2675.08s: the market, created an artificially high stock market while leaving everyday Americans struggling.
2686.04s: I don't understand what the injection here. You see this is a class issue rather than a political one.
2693.40s: Large minus those shoes received massive bailouts and look, this wall ordinary citizens got
2698.04s: minimal relief. I don't know if I want to go into this one. This one's a little bit.
2704.04s: I think this one might be a little too political for me. I'm going to go sell to water.
2718.28s: Yeah, I'm not so sure about this one.
2720.12s: I don't know.
2723.08s: It was your three trillion into the markets to large banks and four days cycles. Exos liquidity.
2734.44s: I'm an inflated stock price artificially.
2741.48s: I see people going to have a whole capital for every share they land. Yeah, I don't know about this one.
2747.48s: Let me I'll flip through it a little bit. I don't want to judge it too hard right from the
2753.56s: beginning, but this might be a slightly different flavor. All right. Yeah, well, this is the problem.
2768.68s: I don't think you could put these two together. Like if you're talking about class war, that
2772.60s: inherently becomes political because of the landscape. But let me look through this.
2787.00s: People are still okay. I don't really care for a lot of this. I just want to see like the actual
2798.68s: research. That's what I care about.
2807.56s: Actually, first of all, I should demand back the $17 trillion bailout given a bank.
2815.88s: I'm going to pass through this one. I don't that one felt a little different than what it was
2822.76s: going for. I'm always down to listen to different opinions and stuff, but I want it to be really
2829.08s: focused on like research. That's what I care most about. It's like solid research.
2835.72s: So now let's see what this one is.
2839.88s: Who goes down to here?
2859.16s: You can't scroll and move what you're highlighting, which is a little frustrating, but we get through it.
2865.24s: By zooming out superfarts, really not that bad.
2869.80s: Oh yeah, also at the end, if you guys want before we wrap up, remind me, I took a couple really
2874.60s: cool pictures today. There was like this super snowy section that we were driving around. And then
2882.20s: there was, um, that should be okay. And then there was a really neat series of trainings that were
2893.88s: like driving through the snow. It was really pretty. Let's see.
2910.04s: All right, what is this kega? We know this. We know these.
2924.60s: So, so, so, leverage, I do not disagree with that at all. The, and this is actually a really
2933.16s: important metric to pay attention to. A little, there's typically a chart of leverage.
2954.68s: Um, normally you would plot margin debt and stuff like that. Yeah, like this.
2967.00s: So you can see from here, margin debt is definitely expanding again. It's still not massive.
2980.20s: But I can't go back far enough in time. I don't think I think I don't have the right.
2986.44s: Because I don't have the, I have a peasant account, free account with these guys. So,
2992.60s: but the leverage is big and the leverage is continuing to expand. So I think that the leverage
2999.72s: does become a bit of a problem. Okay, so re re-appartication. Yes, reverse repose. Okay.
3009.32s: Re-appartication. So, what is this to us?
3014.36s: To the cycle theories, which we know, there's different versions of this that I've seen.
3021.32s: Newton is looked pretty hard at 21 and 35. I think Newton is settled on 35. And then also with
3027.88s: the holiday component, though, which is important because that that skews things.
3032.04s: And it has to be tracked.
3041.08s: Major spike for GameStop could push a big player into default.
3049.72s: Again, this goes back to my question that I still don't have an answer to.
3057.48s: And I've asked it a few times and I'm going to continue asking it because I'm hoping
3061.72s: to see. And so it looks like I'm back. Let me know if this is okay. Just the, it looks like the
3068.84s: Wi-Fi drop real quick. But I think we're back online. There's not like a big snowstorm going on
3077.88s: right now, but there's definitely a good bit of snow coming down. So my guess is that is a
3083.08s: contributing factor. Well, thanks, Morantity. Ayo, what up, Morantity? Good to see you.
3088.60s: But back to what I was seeing, the component I'm really interested in is who are the shorts.
3096.28s: Because if it's a bank, if it's a market maker or a hedge fund, they're very, very different
3101.00s: in the way they look, behave, act. And the implications of GameStop going up, how centralized it is,
3109.40s: all of those things matter a lot when we're trying to analyze the potential total impact,
3115.16s: which from this we won't know. Overleveraging treasury bonds short squeeze pandemic
3122.60s: or liquidity. Well, the liquidity is being siphoned out because they are starting to take treasury
3128.28s: bonds. What's the see if prepared to wind down an auction rules and suspending large scale defaults?
3135.48s: I don't think that it's necessarily an anticipation of defaults, but I think it's in trying to
3142.68s: just increase overall market liquidity, which is a really big,
3149.00s: like this is a continual focus for the market is providing as much liquidity as possible.
3155.56s: Jimmy's frequent T35 T21 cycles may produce another surge soon.
3163.80s: Yeah, I mean, I don't agree with this. I don't think that this is likely to be the case,
3171.08s: but yeah, I think overall, like what we see in this is about what we've seen before,
3176.52s: from an overall analysis perspective. Let's flip through it now and see if anything else sticks
3181.08s: out to us. DTC, we already know all this stuff. So talking about the defaults. Okay.
3193.64s: Okay.
3199.48s: A coffee says it's amazing the shorts can attack treasury bonds. That's the bedrock of a system,
3203.64s: like, is nothing sacred. Well, I don't think you need about that. Like the shorts,
3210.84s: the shorts going up your treasuries. What do you mean by that?
3224.04s: As of today, I was to see approved auction plan. Yeah.
3228.92s: Transfer's assets, other it's these while pushing the damage. So it's,
3233.80s: can you take the ways all three of them? DTCS, you're already ready to pull the plug.
3242.76s: The other thing just to be really clear when we look at this is the margin call doesn't trigger a
3248.44s: default inherently. A margin call is done to actually prevent default and it's to prevent
3257.96s: widespread catastrophe. So now if there are a series of margin calls done in succession,
3266.04s: that absolutely can become a problem. And that can siphon out liquidity and it can absolutely
3272.44s: to pretty massive problems like we saw in 08. But just this by itself doesn't,
3278.68s: I wouldn't make this conclusion personally that by running a margin call in a member that
3285.40s: Ipsilfacto, we run it to a default because the other thing is when they get margin call,
3291.16s: the other thing that can do is raise up an auction for them and a takeover buyout. I really
3296.20s: get priced for another company, which is a way that we typically navigate through it.
3302.36s: Should it is close to hitting fan, this be careful. Just, I'm not saying there's anything wrong
3306.60s: with it. Just be really careful when you read this because people you this is going to be beat
3312.60s: over your head. People are always always looking at the downside. The market's going to crash. The
3320.44s: world is going to end like that is a really popular angle that you're going to continue to see and
3325.64s: talked about because it gains traction because fear is powerful. So there's nothing wrong with
3331.96s: reading this. But just make sure that the subconscious part of your brain doesn't start
3336.76s: stowing away stuff like this and then you start to subconsciously permeate into your conscious
3341.72s: brain and you're like, oh yeah, shit's pretty bad or it's all going to go sideways soon.
3346.44s: It's just a bad way. Here's a great example of that. In 2019, I started trading for my brother
3354.76s: and he had a small amount of money and he's the only person I've ever traded for. And I was
3359.16s: actually doing really well for him because he needs the money. So I was trying to scale up his
3363.80s: account. And then 2020 happens and he, for whatever reason, started thinking that the world is
3373.40s: going to end. This is never going to get better and have to take the money out in order to save it.
3381.08s: And as you probably would imagine, he took the money out. The account obviously stopped growing
3388.12s: because I wasn't trading it anymore. And I mean, I had done well for his account. And
3396.36s: unfortunately, took it out. Market was fantastic. 2020 was a great year. And then he slowly
3407.08s: started doing other stuff with the money. So the lesson here that I want everybody to be aware of
3412.92s: is when you read research from people, negative stuff will do better than positive stuff.
3419.72s: Fear sells. So anytime that I'm doing a video and stuff and I've had different people try to consult
3425.80s: me to help me make better videos, better titles, better thumbnails so that the channel will grow
3430.76s: and continue to hopefully do better. But one of the things that I won't do among many that I know
3438.28s: would help me a lot is leaning into fear. And it's something that I've done a lot of research on.
3443.24s: I know it works well, but I won't do it just because if there's something that's actually bad,
3447.56s: sure, I'll call it bad. But I don't like the idea of fear mongering because I think that starts to
3452.60s: prime people's minds to be in a fearful state. Things are going bad. And I'm very bullish on the
3459.80s: globe, on human innovation. I think we continue to figure shit out. So and I think we will continue
3466.68s: to figure shit out. But I'm not saying that this person is fear mongering. I think it's like this
3474.76s: is fear mongering. Shit is close to hitting the fan. But I don't think that they're purposely
3479.40s: trying to fear monger. People tend to focus on this angle. So this whole rant is just to make sure
3486.04s: that you all are aware of all of those things I was just telling you about so that you can consciously
3494.28s: filter when you see stuff like this so that it doesn't slowly build up in your mind and become a
3500.36s: thing because that's what happens to people. And that's how you end up like my brother taking your
3507.24s: money out instead of compounding it massively, spending it on bullshit that doesn't matter,
3512.60s: and then wishing instead that we had compounded it. Okay. K goes those guys abuse what five times
3519.16s: leverage and you just all would affect head on the market. Imagine how bad leverage must have been
3523.16s: abused by the law. Chairs is still running today. So let's actually take a look at that real quick.
3542.76s: This is what I was looking for. There's a couple studies that actually talk about this.
3549.32s: We can take over care. Yeah. Yeah.
3558.36s: Yeah. Booy. Big peak.
3563.96s: And let's zoom this in so that our friends in the back can peep it. Okay. So this is from
3571.32s: European securities and markets authority. Assmart. They do a lot of different studies not just
3576.52s: related to European markets as you expect. And they used archaicos as a lot of people did
3582.84s: as a case study because there's absolutely a lot to learn from. So let's take a peek.
3589.96s: Says in March 21, the default of archaicos, the US family office led to large losses for some
3595.08s: global banks. Archaicos was able to accumulate large exposures to two and leverage on equities
3602.68s: by entering into derivative transactions with bank counterparts when the price of the underlying
3607.32s: stocks started to decline. The firm was unable to meet variation margins resulting in the liquidation
3613.88s: of the stocks by the counter party banks, which is important. So here are the losses that the companies
3622.84s: various companies ate. So credit sues, Nomura, Maurice the only UBS. And I mean, this is no love
3631.80s: lost, right? Just to be clear, the losses are big. This is a drop in the fucking bucket for companies
3640.44s: like this. So they do not want to consume losses like this, obviously. But this is also not what you
3651.32s: see from what this kind of makes you believe. Those guys abuse what five times leverage and you
3657.96s: saw an effect that had on the market. It absolutely had an effect on the market. No doubt, but it's
3662.28s: not like this big prolific thing that changed the status quo. A couple big banks lost a few bucks
3668.76s: and they were sad about it, whatever. I think they're all okay. As indicated by the fact that
3678.68s: CS is still making tons of money. Actually, what did, let's, that would be fun to take a look at.
3683.64s: What CS did in 2021 for its annual earnings?
3689.72s: Reddit sues 2021 earnings.
3698.20s: So it had a fourth quarter loss of 2.17 billion in a full year net loss of 1.57 billion.
3709.64s: And it had a 2.7 billion profit in 2020. So then let's take a look at credit sues
3718.92s: earnings year over year.
3726.12s: And here we go. As expected.
3729.40s: Credit.
3735.40s: So credit sues had 19.9 billion in 22 revenues. You know, real sad. It's actually really bad for them.
3749.00s: 28 Bill in 2020, 28 Bill 19.
3752.92s: So the company is still making tremendous revenue.
3760.28s: Absolutely tremendous revenue. So the, again, just the point is Mr. Boggsham says,
3766.52s: hasn't changed the status quo yet. Exactly. And that's just because organizations like this
3771.80s: are always going to be addicted to leverage. Leverage is the tool of choice for informed speculators.
3779.00s: It's why I use leverage because even though you have the ability to lose more money,
3783.40s: you have the ability to make more money. And if you're good at this, you're less worried about
3789.48s: the risk side and you're more content with the profit side. So as long as you have good risk
3795.88s: management approach, which is you could tell CS was oversized here. But people like Morgan Stanley,
3802.28s: UBS losing
3809.16s: all right, looks like we're back. Yeah.
3821.64s: And let's take a look. So this is MS from 21.
3827.80s: This is a year 21 net revenue, 59 billion.
3837.88s: They were fine.
3840.76s: 6.2 billion net revenues, right? So they, they took a loss. They had a losing position
3847.56s: as anything does. But as any good risk manager does, they manage the rest. They had a better
3853.80s: spread in their portfolio. And they were able to eat the loss. It didn't even do rail them
3860.60s: for the year, which is kind of crazy if you think about it. I had to pop in instructions. We're
3865.80s: meeting some folks that we met earlier today for dinner and I just got to see where we're going.
3876.04s: All right. So it's like 17 minutes away. That's easy day.
3884.20s: And cool. Yeah. So we have plenty of time. We'll probably run for like another 20 minutes.
3893.24s: Dig it.
3898.92s: We've
3899.24s: got to take a look.
3905.24s: So let's get back to this. I think we can pop through this.
3917.80s: Yep, liquidity through 2020. We don't know all that. This talks about the settlement cycles again.
3930.12s: The one of the things to highlight for the settlement cycles is it's difficult to pick where we
3935.56s: want to start. So and then that can slide us off by an individual day or two days. It just makes
3943.40s: it tricky to manage and track.
3949.32s: You're right. So oh, this is actually interesting. I'm excited to read this one. Well,
3956.04s: we'll switch off after this one and just kind of bullshit a little bit about anything else that
3959.72s: you guys want to cover. But oh, that's okay too far. But I'm actually really interested because
3964.84s: this is one of the long-standing questions I have for APS is the exit approach, which I think
3972.28s: is actually really, really important in something that I don't truly see people talk about. So this
3979.08s: makes me pretty excited. Let's see. This is part of a DD. This is also a very long vertical.
3992.92s: Fun fact though, we are coming up on two-thirds through the DD from the Diamond Hand
3998.76s: Handbook, which I think is a pretty significant majority of the different research that's been put
4008.12s: out, which I'm stoked on. All right. So let's see what this, let's see what this one's about.
4022.84s: So you're shares during the short screws. Hey, that's actually great.
4035.72s: This is great. I love this. I love that this is something that was put out. Do you guys know if this
4042.76s: one was well received or not? I'm so curious how the community reacted to this because this is a,
4047.88s: and just this is something I've talked about trying to think through a way to, for me, I think,
4053.56s: scaling out is the smartest way. This is easier said than done.
4069.16s: This is good. This is not good.
4078.60s: The reason why stop limits are not good is because you might not get filled.
4083.96s: So when we're trying to take an exit on stuff like this, we, using a stop is fine,
4091.32s: but I personally would use a stop market. Now the problem with that is you can get terrible,
4096.68s: terrible fills, but you kind of need them because otherwise you might not get an exit.
4103.56s: So that's just something to be generally.
4111.24s: Big peak.
4113.80s: Lambago. This talks about different studies for different approaches. Yeah, this is rad. I love this.
4124.04s: The one thing I would add on for an exit strategy is just to look at prior moves and to base
4130.84s: what you think may or may not happen off of purpose. So yeah, I'm actually really, really stoked
4138.36s: that this person is talking about this. This is rad because one of the ways that you can procure
4148.68s: for shares of GameStop if that's your intention is to have more money. And the way you have more
4155.80s: money is if you're able to play the moves. We'll give it this. This will be leave off points
4163.40s: for 28 December.
4167.88s: Before.
4169.88s: Lee.
4173.72s: I love it.
4176.20s: Cool. So I'm going to kill this. Is there anything else that you want to take a look at?
4181.24s: I think there was somebody that wanted to look at a stock. If you wanted to do that,
4184.84s: I'm happy to do that now as well. But the quick recap of what we learned, we learned somebody
4195.96s: that was talking about an exit strategy. We learned a little bit of due diligence around the
4203.48s: settlement cycles, leverage, and the expectation of a potential kickoff effect from marginal calls.
4211.88s: And then we also learned after looking at the actual impacts to companies like Credit
4217.80s: Suisse, Morgan Stanley, UBS, is that although some of them did take some losses, it really wasn't
4224.52s: exceedingly consequential for them. So that was a cool one. And
4233.64s: this one was about the Fed involvement and liquidity. So those are pretty interesting three ones. I
4248.92s: really like that last one. Michigan says the DD is done. We never saw until phone numbers.
4256.76s: Oh, that's funny. Michigan says that's why I can't watch y'all too dumb. Yeah, I definitely
4261.16s: am ignorant. I'm trying to learn that's for sure. But you're not wrong, my friend, you're not wrong.
4267.80s: The other thing I can tell you though is the difference between you and I is, again, you probably
4274.60s: haven't seen the phone numbers yet because they've not come up unfortunately. Maybe sometime they will.
4279.56s: But I've been really fortunate in able to scale and account over the last 17 years. That's
4287.48s: done pretty well for me. So I'm pretty confident and comfortable with my approach. But yeah,
4294.28s: obviously you got to do whatever is right for you. And I hope that you have a solid approach
4299.56s: that you're comfortable with. That's the cool part about this whole thing is everybody has to do
4305.08s: what they're comfortable with and what makes sense for them.
4307.72s: I just want to see. Yeah, find that spot.
4323.96s: I didn't see this. Yeah, man.
4327.40s: I'm really happy about that.
4331.64s: Rory and T.D. says Michigan is a life where yeah, that's cool. Whatever, whatever works for him.
4337.40s: The thing that I just remind people like him and other people is that what's right for you and
4344.60s: what works for you is cool. But that might not be what's right for somebody else. So for somebody
4349.24s: to think that their way is the only way is the epitome of ignorance. And each person has to do
4356.60s: what's right for them. That's what it boils down to. That's the concept of a marketplace.
4361.32s: It's how this whole thing works is people have to decide what makes sense for them. And only you
4367.80s: can decide that. Yeah.
4375.80s: That's my .02. Cool. And then for those that didn't see, I did do a GameStop recap video yesterday
4384.84s: just because I didn't do anything about it really during the week. And we had an options
4390.36s: expiration that's actually probably when I'm going to start doing GameStop videos. I might just
4395.00s: start doing them on Friday. Unless there's other stuff that's going on. And you can see here,
4405.00s: the last options expiration was pretty interesting because we were pretty deep past Max Payne.
4412.12s: And we saw the market hold what I would consider to be some pretty, pretty key levels. So that was
4421.24s: pretty cool to see. Michigan says he's probably paid a game followers. And then when it's time,
4426.60s: when it's sell time, he'll take the money and tell people to sell a k a gym creamer. That's funny.
4432.12s: The fun part about YouTube is I don't know how many ads you saw during this, but it should be zero
4438.20s: because I have the ads for the live streams even turned off. So I actually make nothing doing this.
4445.00s: So if you want to pay me to do it though, that would be sick. That would be really, really cool
4449.00s: because I do spend a lot of time doing this. And right now, as I said, I don't even have the ads turn on.
4455.64s: So I don't really make a whole lot on no income source. So if I apply your methodology,
4465.40s: then I just have to hold stuff so that I can't make money off that either. Maybe that's a typical,
4470.28s: that's a really difficult model. Actually, as I think about it. All right. Let's see if there's
4475.88s: anything else that Newton has updated here.
4480.20s: There are 15s.
4494.28s: Interesting.
4496.28s: So he also is, he's flagging periods where he's expecting because of large stock movements.
4511.32s: That's interesting to me. Yeah. Super interesting.
4518.68s: All right. Okay. Let me wrap up from the head out. We're going to go link up some friends
4526.52s: that helped pull us out after I got the car stuck in the snow. So I'm going to go kick it for
4532.36s: a little bit, take the amount for a drink. And I hope everybody has a killer rest of your weekend.
4539.16s: There will be a live stream tomorrow. We'll figure out the time and all that stuff. And as always,
4544.36s: if you guys need anything, let me know. Be in outlier, be in ape, be whatever you want to be. Catch you later.
