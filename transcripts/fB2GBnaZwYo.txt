0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here.
2.08s: Starting up a really fun segment,
3.72s: I think I'm calling it small stacks.
6.00s: And essentially what I'm gonna do is
8.22s: take a segment of my portfolio and trade it
11.28s: as if I would a smaller account.
13.28s: So I decided to take 5K.
16.06s: And the reason why I picked that number is I think
18.52s: that that's like pretty much the absolute minimum
21.36s: you should consider trading options with.
24.72s: So with that part in mind,
27.00s: I wanna jump over to the main screen
28.64s: and kinda talk through what this is gonna look like.
31.32s: So it will be a margin account,
33.48s: although I do not expect to use margin frequently.
38.44s: The goal is not what most people typically attribute.
42.76s: I stand firmly in my belief that small accounts,
47.04s: essentially below 20, 25K,
51.08s: their primary goal shouldn't necessarily be
54.16s: to turn into a bunch of money.
56.28s: And the reason why I say that is because small accounts
58.44s: have a lot of shortcomings that they have to work around.
62.04s: IE the ability to manage risk is a big one.
65.44s: So the goals I have for this account
69.04s: is exactly what I would for any small account,
71.20s: which is make sure that we're preserving capital
74.64s: and we're learning.
76.16s: Obviously, I don't really need to do either of these.
80.36s: So for my personal goal,
83.12s: I'm gonna try to paste the market in the account.
87.44s: And the reason why that goal's a little bit different,
90.88s: obviously I've been doing this for a while.
92.64s: So I'm trying to make it a constructive endeavor.
97.04s: Whereas for most folks,
98.36s: I truly think the best possible thing you could focus on
100.84s: is preserving the account not getting in your own way
103.60s: and honing your skill set,
105.44s: creating a trading plan,
106.52s: paper trading strategy, stuff like that.
108.80s: So that is my personal goal is I would like to pace the market.
114.52s: Now, I wanna talk through my strategy real quick.
118.56s: It's gonna primarily be covered strangles
121.04s: and potentially some spreads.
123.84s: I am expecting not to trade many if any.
127.44s: The only reason why I will do any spreads
130.80s: is kind of for instructional slash exploratory purposes.
134.80s: It's not because I really like them because I don't.
137.16s: So I am going to steer clear of them in general.
142.44s: So that is that.
146.68s: Couple notes that I want to highlight.
150.48s: Risk management is gonna be tough.
152.80s: That's the case for any sort of small account.
154.92s: I accept the fact that I very frequently
157.48s: will be over allocated.
158.96s: It's again, just how small accounts go.
162.84s: Now, I wanna put this disclaimer out
164.72s: because I really think too many people's dismay,
167.76s: they're gonna expect me to be wheeling and dealing
170.28s: and trading a bunch and it's not.
173.40s: It's probably gonna be pretty boring for most people
176.36s: because I think that that's the right way
178.60s: to approach a small account is to not actively trade it.
181.48s: Trying to capture intraday moves and stuff like that.
184.76s: I think if you're lucky, you'll break even doing that.
187.76s: If more probably more probable than not,
191.20s: you'll lose money.
192.36s: So again, my approach is gonna be to model this account
195.44s: just like I would again, if like $5,000 is all I had
199.12s: and I wanted to grow it.
200.80s: So in that vein, it's gonna be a lot of buy and hold.
206.16s: So it's gonna be what it's gonna be.
208.60s: I wanna show that upfront
210.16s: because I know that a lot of folks wanna actively trade
212.76s: and stuff like that.
213.92s: If you have a small account, I don't think it's a good idea.
216.00s: So I'm not gonna do it.
217.44s: I'm not gonna set some sort of, for example,
219.24s: I'm gonna try to do what I say I think is best
222.88s: and try to prove why I think it's the right approach.
227.48s: So next video from here is going to be,
230.20s: I'm gonna create a watch list.
231.44s: One of the biggest issues for smaller accounts,
233.72s: especially if I'm talking about, you know,
236.44s: buy and hold is finding products that I can buy enough of
241.64s: in order for it to be a meaningful purchase.
244.08s: So with that kind of is the baseline here,
248.16s: we'll have to look through, see what fits our criteria
251.64s: and I will share that watch list once I build it out
254.52s: and then we will go forward with outlining some of the strategies
258.20s: when I'm gonna be looking at doing, you know, a little more in depth
260.92s: and then we'll just do, you know, account updates
263.48s: just like I do for my personal account
265.88s: on a monthly basis, stuff like that.
267.48s: So looking forward to the segment.
269.08s: If anybody's any questions or anything that they wanna make
271.04s: sure I cover anything like that, feel free.
272.96s: Let me know and let's see what we could do
275.80s: with this 5K account.
