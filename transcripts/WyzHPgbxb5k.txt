0.00s: What's up, outliers? Today I got a video for you walking you through the covered
4.64s: strangle option strategy trading in leveraged ETFs while the market is down
10.56s: anywhere from 20% plus in the tickers that I'm trading. So we're going to talk
15.44s: about the positions, the management that I've been doing for the outlier pro
18.80s: members. This will be familiar to you because I provide slightly more periodic
22.88s: updates on this portfolio. But nonetheless, there's some really important
27.28s: learning points that I really want to share with you all. And again, the whole
32.64s: goal behind this is just to give you some ideas on different ways to do
35.84s: things, ways to think about the market and especially the covered strangle strategy.
39.92s: Some of the different ways to trade it especially when things are not going
42.88s: our way like they are right now. So as things sit today, I am trading the covered
48.16s: strangle in a couple tickers. The two for the sake of this video are
53.20s: here. Now this is all part of a model $600,000 portfolio. All I've done is take in my
60.00s: actual portfolio, take a small chunk out of it, split it into the covered strangle in a
64.40s: series of different names. And I'm just using it to show essentially one of my
68.72s: poor strategies, how I use it in different stuff. So what's happening here is in T-Triple
75.76s: Qs, I have a $150,000 allocation to that strategy, and then SSO 275K. And you'll take a look at
83.44s: the current utilization for both, which is 75 and 77% respectively. That's how much money I'm using
89.60s: in the positions as they sit today. And we will talk through all of that. A couple key notes
94.80s: that I want to highlight for you specifically. The first one is if we take a look at T-Triple Qs,
102.08s: when I first started this exercise sharing this portfolio segment, and I've really built this
108.24s: portfolio to talk about it with you all as an example, T-Triple Qs was trading at $75. As of the
115.60s: close on Friday, it's trading at $53.86. So that marks it down, negative 28%. T-Triple Qs is down
123.20s: quite a lot actually from when this whole thing began. So what I do in these kinds of things is I
129.84s: employ a series of different tactics. And I want to talk to you about those tactics. But first,
136.64s: let's take a look at broadly what's been happening in the market. We know that there's a ton of
141.36s: volatility. A lot of this is wrapped around the different tariffs. The reason why that matters so
145.52s: much is because that effectively means that the short-term price movement of the stock market
150.80s: comes and goes as fast as the other. And that's because it's so news-driven. So catalyst-driven
159.04s: that you will get pretty significant price pops and then collapses. Literally, you can see that
164.08s: represented here when VIX straight up went above 60 on the 7th of April. It's a massive relative
172.00s: move on something like the VIX, especially given the broader landscape that we're in.
176.96s: Now, my overall hypothesis here is that we are in no way out of the woods. I think that it's very
183.60s: likely that we continue to see negative pressure stemming from the tariff conversations.
190.16s: I also think that the market favors the downside more broadly, although that there's always
195.68s: upside potential like we're seeing here. I've looked at things like the cop report and whatnot.
200.24s: And we can see that large speculators have not been buying this dip at all. So all of that to be
206.16s: said is my analysis of the market in general at a high level is bearish. I think it's favoring the
212.64s: downside and least until new data comes out. Now, there is a little bit of a near-term turn going on.
220.48s: And you can see that in SSO, which is a two times leverage ETF where it's closing above these local
227.52s: highs. So that's good. And it did post a higher local low. So this starts to show the reversal in
234.40s: a trend, but it's super early. And it really would need to do quite a lot in order to actually buck
240.64s: this broader trend that you see going on. So there are some signs of recovery just not much.
247.52s: And T triple Q's is a fairly similar story, not a whole lot different in terms of the broader
252.56s: analysis. This is the three times leverage ETF of NASDAQ. Okay. I want to talk to you about the
259.12s: positions specifically and the management of them because I think there's a couple important
263.84s: lessons here to learn with respect to trading the coverage strangle as markets are going down.
269.12s: So you can see that there's a bunch of different trades on here. I don't want to get bogged down
272.96s: in like a full recount of everything. But what I want to show you specifically is as of 7 April,
281.52s: I ended up unwinding 800 shares with the basis of 64 for 4195. So that represents the 17,880
291.20s: dollar loss. That's on the seventh of April. Now you might be asking Eric, why would you do that?
295.20s: You're trading the coverage strangle, which a big part is holding inventory and waiting for a
299.76s: recovery, which is absolutely true. But there's a lot we can do in the meantime to get to a profitable
305.36s: position faster, especially if the broader thesis is the market is continuing to rotate down. So
311.92s: if you take a look at 7 April, it's here. And what happened on this day is we literally were in
319.04s: this aggressive down move continuing to the downside. So I took the opportunity to make an adjustment
325.92s: as it was rallying. And this is the adjustment that I made. I essentially track what the total loss
332.56s: was on the book shares. So again, 17,880. And then what I do is I put on an options position here
341.60s: that you can see that effectively covers the cost of the losing trade. So again, 7 April,
350.40s: I closed these book to loss for 17,880. Also on 7 April, I sold in the money options. They were
358.64s: 82 delta puts at the 63. And I collected 21 dollars, which the net credit on that represents
365.92s: 16,800. So that still represents a small loss. I wasn't concerned about that small loss
372.64s: because once I factor in what I've made from the call side of things, it doesn't really matter.
379.04s: So that was the original adjustment made here. And the entire purpose of this, again, was to move
388.64s: out of the equity with the basis of 64 into options, short puts, which now have a mobile
396.00s: basis. And I already reduced the basis from 6430 to 63. It's the first series of a campaign of
404.16s: trades. Then effectively, what I do is continue managing, rolling these options, adding new legs,
410.80s: taking other legs off. That's what this follow on subsequent series of trades is. And you can see
417.60s: really all I'm doing is realizing profits as we're going down where I can and taking trades off.
424.40s: And I'm using the near term market movements along with changes in my trade size in order to try
432.88s: and make more progress on the basis. So if you take a look, we started at these 63s here.
440.32s: And then we were able to add a little bit of size and take it down to the 60s. Now this is a
449.36s: different trade over here with the 60s. That's another one that I was rolling that's not tied to
453.76s: this one. So the main thing I want to show you here is that by moving out of the underlying,
463.12s: my basis is now mobile. I can move it. I can adjust it. I can move as the market moves,
468.80s: capturing the opportunities as the market rallies to look for slightly better rolling opportunities
476.88s: to then continually manage my basis. So if you take a look at what is existing now,
484.72s: I have everything is out in 20 June. Both of these are part of rolled options. But I was actually
491.12s: able to roll one series of those options actually out of the money now. They were out of 40 delta
498.08s: and it's up to a 10 lot and those took in 533. And then I have a 10 lot at the 60s still.
506.40s: So net net overall, everything included with what's happened. T triple Q's is down 28.2% from where
515.20s: I started this. This again is essentially an unrealized profit or loss. This is making the
521.28s: assumption that we would have bought the entire size at 75 and then just held. So this is an
527.28s: unrealized loss in this case with the basis of 75. And now we have our position which has a
534.24s: realized loss of 14,500 but a net realized total PNL of positive $382. That's essentially if I take
546.24s: either these trades come off at a full profit or I get assigned on these. Then I realized this
552.08s: entire credit of 14 860. And then I would have managed basis here of like mid to high 50s. So it
561.28s: would be close to a scratch given where he triple Q's is today. What I'm showing you is by
567.52s: trading the coverage strangle rather than holding shares and essentially just being down 28%.
572.72s: I'm able to do different things. And in this context right now, if these expire out of the money,
579.12s: I will actually be up 0.34% which is really nothing to write home about but given the context and
585.76s: the comparison about what the basis was in the original trade from the jump. This is exactly what
590.96s: makes this such an effective strategy even during down markets. You have to have a really firm plan.
596.80s: It's essentially the same campaign I'm running in SSO at a slightly different scale. But right now,
602.72s: I'm purposely saying you'll notice in all short puts across all the coverage strangles. I bet it's
608.96s: a slightly different story that one I could take on shares if I wanted simply because it's been
614.16s: behaving a little bit differently. That's a whole other video for another day. But specifically for
618.96s: SSO and T triple Q's with my broader market hypothesis, what I want to do is actually continue
624.00s: rolling these and let's say for example, I can get these off for a full profit or near full profit.
630.72s: I'm not going to relay out another 10 lot and consume 75% utilization of the allocation. I
637.20s: actually want to scale this down if I can. But right now, I'm in the process of managing existing
642.00s: trades and again, using what options allow me to do, which is to remain highly adaptable.
648.48s: So as always, if you have any questions, let me know being out there. I'll see you later.
