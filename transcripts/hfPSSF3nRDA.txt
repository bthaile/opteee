0.00s: What's up, outliers? Our market recap today is grown to three items because of requests
7.16s: from somebody in the discord, which I'm happy to accommodate. So today, we are going to
11.84s: look at Chewy. We are going to look at Nvidia and we are going to look at GameStop in
18.68s: that order. So the reason why I want to start with Chewy is because some of the things
22.72s: we're going to talk about look really interesting for Chewy, but then as soon as you put it
26.80s: in the context of something like Nvidia, you'll see. So let's start off with Chewy.
34.72s: Okay, this is Nvidia. So we have to pull up Chewy. Maybe I can click the box. There we go.
40.68s: Let's start off with Chewy. So as expected, Chewy started just kind of oscillating sideways
47.88s: into this earnings release, generally in line with expectations for me. I actually had
53.84s: a short strangle on it. Once I saw this third day, really short term trade, but my full
59.88s: expectation was that we were going to start just moving sideways. So we kind of continue
65.12s: to see that behavior. And now today, we are right before earnings, which is on the 28th.
72.56s: So what's been going on in here? Well, a few things. We did see volume expand pretty
79.12s: meaningfully over the last three days. So if we go back to the 23rd volume was 4.8
85.60s: mil. If we go to the 26th, 6 mil, and then if we go to the 27th, today, 7.8 mil. So lots
94.28s: of volume that we saw in Chewy. So why is that happening? What's going on here? My
101.56s: guess is mostly earnings. And we saw some options coming out that I want to take a look
107.92s: at that actually do peak my interest a bit because they are relatively interesting for
114.36s: something like Chewy. And we'll get to those in a second. But right now, they're expected
119.68s: to report tomorrow. And it's before the open. So these before the open style reports can
127.32s: be kind of interesting, depending on the broader market and what things look like. If
132.76s: we look at historically, what Chewy is done around earnings, you can see over its past
138.44s: several cycles, it's been a mixed bag. We had a bit of a gap up in Q1 of 24. We ran
146.96s: down in Q4 of 23 down again, Q3 23 down again, Q2 23 gap up, Q1 23 and so on and so forth.
156.16s: I'm sure you're able to continue reading to the left there. So this from a general trading
162.56s: perspective for me is an interesting one because I don't like trading volatility and stuff
168.92s: like this. That's all over the map. It's both I'm seeing periods where implied is being
175.24s: exceeded like historic post move. And then I can't identify near term clear trends in
180.68s: terms of how it's behaving after the implied volatility gets beat by historic meaning
186.28s: are we continuing to see positive drift and things moving to the upside as it, again,
190.48s: I said over the last like three quarters, it's kind of a mixed bag. So I don't like it
195.08s: from in general options trading earnings perspective. But I do think that there's some
202.60s: interesting behavior going on in here that's worth discussing. So let's take a look at
209.20s: the options and the first thing before we get into the individual options and stuff,
213.52s: let's take a look at the volume today. We had 96,000 calls against 44,000 puts and the bulk
220.12s: is for 30 aug. I see these 32s came in at 31,000 contracts. And then I see on the put side,
228.00s: the 25s came in at just 12,000. So this actually popped up on one of my scanners because these
234.36s: 32s were getting hammered today quite a few times. And we'll take a look at that a little
239.44s: bit more in depth. But what does that mean for general positioning? Well, it's tough to
246.08s: say because it's not a massive amount of money. So this could just be a couple medium-sized
251.96s: traders that are out there sharking thinking that something's going on. I don't actually
257.36s: attribute a lot of the volume we saw today to any sort of institutional purchasing or anything
261.68s: like that necessarily could be some of it for sure. But it's small enough that it looks
267.40s: like a glorious mix of random people getting involved. That's kind of the way I look at
272.08s: it. And there were a couple bulk positions that were put on. So for example, I see these
278.44s: aren't the 32s by the way, these are 34s. But I'm seeing these 30 aug explorations getting
285.28s: hit in multiple ways. So if I filter this really quick and I want to just look at this
293.52s: upcoming series for the 30th of aug. And I want to look at the essentially the 30s to
300.48s: like the 35s or 36s, something like that. But we'll go to the 35s. And let's see kind of
306.72s: the tenor of what's going on here. You'll see this. So one of the things I picked up
312.60s: here is that at the 32s, there's some pretty big volume going on. I see 5,000 there. I
321.00s: see 5,000 there. Then I see 3765 here. Then I see a smattering of other numbers going
328.84s: on here. And what I mean by that is just other strikes that are around these options that
336.48s: these appear to be singles to me. So what that means is kind of more of a directional
341.40s: disposition. So if we grab something like this, unusual whales, we can see a few things
347.36s: going on here. This is again, just kind of looking across the board, but it's focusing
351.96s: on just general options activity, both bid and offer side calls and puts. But you'll see
357.92s: that the top of the board here are these 32s and we see them getting hit at the offer,
363.08s: meaning people are buying them. Now again, going back to what I was saying before, these
367.64s: 5,000 lots have become very heavily associated with the cat. And we also know the cat is
375.48s: in Chewie. So this would not be surprising at all to me if Roaring Kitty is playing some
383.08s: of this earnings release pure speculation. I have no idea. And the other thing that's
389.84s: really important for everybody to remember is that he's not the only dude that has 5,000
395.56s: shares or 5,000 lots that they like to move in. The people like round numbers. One of
400.80s: the things that would be much easier to detect if it's the cat versus somebody else is
406.24s: if he did like 5,000 and nine, that would be like a calling card because that's weird.
412.04s: But moving larger sizes in round lots, it's just normal. It is just normal. So this is
420.48s: super open to speculation. Really? Like it would be so easy to argue for or against
425.72s: tremendously. So now the one thing I can say based on what I've seen Roaring Kitty do previously
432.00s: is that he doesn't seem to buy options that expire in three days. I haven't seen him do a lot
437.08s: of that. Most of his options plays that I've seen him run tend to be a month out give or take,
442.00s: which is again, a pretty pragmatic approach to trading options, especially the sizes that he
447.28s: tends to run in. So is it him? I have no idea. Could it be him? Absolutely. Now a couple other
454.24s: notes though, is that even for him, this is a relatively smaller size, but this does start to
460.72s: look more like his size. Right? So if we say, for example, that he started phasing in in the
466.32s: morning, I don't think I've seen him trade at this time previously. Most of what he's done,
471.04s: again, in the other fingerprinting I've done for him is towards the end of the day.
475.04s: So whether or not this first tranche is him, super tough to say, I don't know definitively.
481.52s: But I do see some other interesting transactions here that definitely seem to align with standard
488.48s: practice for him, which is towards end of day transactions. And if you look at the size here,
492.72s: it's almost half a million bucks, which is small for him, but a really large position for just
498.48s: about everybody else. That is again, if it's the cat. I don't know. I really don't know. It's super
506.16s: hard to say. Now we spent a little time on the last live stream going through what his position
510.80s: could look like. What kind of cash could he have depending on different scenarios? And what I do
516.00s: know is that if he bought into Chewie and let's just say that he unwound his game stop position to
523.76s: do so. And again, that's up for debate. I don't know. I'm just using it as a discussion point to try
527.76s: to understand what the account could look like. He had about like $260 or $70 million in the account.
535.44s: And the day that he bought Chewie, giving him like the mid price, which is about fair for
540.40s: nine million, 1000 shares that essentially would take up like 232 million. So all I'm highlighting
546.24s: is that he still has $25 plus million left to play with. Does that mean that he kept some of his
552.48s: GME stock? Does that mean that he had more money somewhere else that he ported in? None of that,
556.00s: I'm not even trying to discuss that. So I don't know. But I'm just trying to give you one scenario
560.88s: where it could be like, this would be relatively small if that is the scenario, because we know he
567.60s: likes to put on some big, freaking trades. But this is not tiny, right? Somebody putting on
573.12s: half a million dollars, expiring in three days. Again, that's nuts. So that leads me to believe
579.12s: with some probability that it could be him. Again, I have no idea. But this is very interesting to me.
588.16s: Now what we do know is those options are going to do something tomorrow. Whether it's good or bad,
593.84s: something's going to happen. So if we take a look at these 32s, which are about a 20 delta,
598.88s: which again, based on the cat's fingerprinting that I've done, which is fallible. I don't know
603.36s: him inside and out. But I did take a look pretty in depth at his previous options, straights to
607.92s: better understand kind of like his behaviors. And 20 delta is a little bit light for what I've
612.40s: seen him do historically. Typically, it's like a 30 delta, something around there. But again,
616.56s: this still very well could be within the realm of possibility. So yeah, it is a really interesting
625.04s: series of trades that I see going on. The volume today in that expiration was wild.
631.44s: 31,000 contracts. So what that also tells me is that this is not just the cat if it's him.
639.04s: This is more people. And if it's not the cat, it's a ton of other people. Because even if we attribute,
646.32s: you know, these larger block trades to him and let's say that he could have built up 15, 20,000
651.76s: of this, that still means probably 15, 20,000 would be other people. So that's much larger even on
661.12s: the residual than all of these others. So people are building into these calls. Heavy, really heavy.
667.60s: And then when I look at the volume on the put side, it's nowhere near what we're seeing on the
672.72s: call side. So it tells me that in general, the options market is playing this to the upside. Now,
678.56s: how informed it is or how indicative it is. I don't really know. But I thought that this was a
683.68s: really interesting call out. Happy to take a look at it. It is going to be something to follow tomorrow.
689.76s: That's without a doubt. And this is kind of the fun part about earnings is I know that there's
693.60s: other theories right now about FTD cycles and stuff with respect to chewy. But honestly,
698.88s: that could be in play here. I'm not discounting it. But what we're seeing here is
703.84s: dominated in my opinion by options and specifically with respect to earnings. I've looked at
710.08s: previous chewy earnings this here. And this is kind of common to see this expansion in volume,
718.40s: this expansion in options activity around the product at least recently. So if there is an
724.48s: FTD cycle that happens to coincide with the good earnings, look out, look out above. I mean,
730.56s: it can start flying. I have no idea. TBD will find out tomorrow morning, not too long.
736.48s: All right. Next, we have to take a look at Nvidia again. And it's because this is
741.76s: this is the story right now. Everybody is fascinated by what happens with Nvidia myself included.
748.40s: And again, the same exact pattern, this sideways trend into earnings quieting down daily ranges
755.12s: contracting. If we take a look at the five day ATR average true range, which is including gaps
762.80s: or if we want to isolate it down to the ADR, which is probably even better, we can see that the five
768.24s: day ADR is now down to 4.3% whereas the 20 day was over 6%. So it's just gotten way quiet
774.72s: in today relative still moving for sure, but relative quiet. And the big thing about Nvidia is
780.88s: that it makes up a lot of the market. It's everywhere. It's in the semi-conductors ETFs,
787.36s: which are going to be highly dependent on what happens here. It's in the S&P 500 is a pretty
791.52s: big percentage, almost 10%. It's in the queues also. So it's like this is going to be a really
797.92s: important release and it's wild to say, but we have one stock, one stock that can move the whole
805.20s: market right now. And that is not being hyperbolic, which I was practicing yesterday. Hopefully,
810.64s: I'm getting better at it so that I can rake in all the views. I realize that I get to get more
814.48s: hyperbolic in my speech in order to get my rep up. So that's about as hyperbolic as I get.
819.04s: But it's honestly not even hyperbally. Like this really can move the entire market by itself.
824.88s: So if we take a look at the options and I want to show you why I wanted to start with
829.44s: Chuy, because we're talking about cool stuff, right? We're talking about half a million dollar
833.04s: position. And then if you grab Nvidia, it's just like, you don't even get below a million
842.16s: until you hold on. Let's see how far we have to scroll. You have to get down here before you
847.20s: drop below a million. The top position is a 10 million dollar position. So it's just a different
856.56s: scale. It's just different. And this I absolutely believe is an earnings play. It's just a smart
863.60s: earnings play because they're going far out in time and they're going deep in the money.
868.32s: This is an institution. Clearly, this is somebody who knows what they're doing that are really
872.88s: trying to position for an explosive upward movement, hopefully for them because this is a huge
879.84s: position, bro. And there's a possibility that this is the same person because we have the 80s
886.88s: being hit pretty close to one another at size and then some. And I mean, this easily could be
893.44s: 20 million dollar position that you're looking at right here from somebody just looking to run
897.84s: this thing up. It will be just fascinating because if you want to talk about money moving,
904.96s: this is it, man. This is some of the most money you can find in an inch or a day or in a daily
912.16s: basis of an options chain. That's not like a big index itself. If you're looking at SPX and stuff
916.96s: like that, they're typically pretty large. But Nvidia here is this is just wild man. Like this is
922.88s: tens of millions of dollars just today literally just today. So if we take a look at
930.56s: the positioning as we get into, oh my god, look at that. Just man, it's lit up like a Christmas tree.
941.04s: All of this green means that it's net ads over yesterday in terms of the volume.
946.56s: And then if you look at the volume today, it's massive new volume blowing up again. 35,000
953.52s: here, 20,000 here, 53,000 here, 38,000 here. Like this is just massive positioning. 61,000 here,
961.84s: 43,000, 85,000. So there is just massive, massive build out happening right now in this product,
971.20s: which is just honestly kind of fun to see to see this much money moving. This is a massive
977.20s: amount of money that's flowing through here. And if you take a look at the volume just today,
982.56s: 1.4 million calls against 886,000 puts and earnings in here is not until after the close tomorrow,
991.20s: which is also interesting. There's a really good chance that I will try to play this directionally,
996.72s: almost because I don't know how you can't. It's just, it's just that interesting to me. We have
1003.68s: some really, really, really big put transactions, 16,850 of these 90 puts. So this is obviously some
1012.32s: sort of hedging activity for probably somebody that I imagine has a big old stock position
1017.92s: that they're looking to hold through the release. I mean, just an incredible amount of money
1025.12s: moving in here. So for this upcoming expiration cycle, 708,000 against 423,000 volume,
1034.32s: calls to puts respectively open interest right now just for this expiration cycles, 1 million
1038.96s: calls against 921,000 puts. So not a clear disparity here yet. I think we need to see the volume
1045.28s: from today get integrated into the OI before coming up with any from decisions there. But
1051.28s: yeah, tomorrow's going to be interesting because from a general market perspective,
1055.68s: it's kind of quiet. There's not a whole lot. I think there's a fed speaker. If we take a look
1060.56s: really quick, we can see what's happened. Yeah. So for the 28th, we have crude oil inventories
1066.40s: and Bostech is speaking. So it's like not a whole lot. crude oil is semi-topical now, but like not
1072.00s: massively big. So it's kind of all eyes on Nvidia. And then the crowd favorite, the hometown favorite,
1078.88s: the mascot, GameStop. And another down day. So I kind of have to expect it at this point.
1087.28s: Again, it's still marking earnings right now for the 4th of September. And actually in a video
1092.56s: that I did, because a lot of people based on the video yesterday, they're like, yo, what do you
1096.48s: think about earnings maybe not being on the 4th, which is actually one of the hypothesis I came up
1103.04s: on Sunday. I talked about that there because when I'm looking at the implied volatility
1108.48s: in here, this still doesn't line up to me. We are seeing this ball stand up for the six
1114.56s: set a little bit. But the fact that this is still 78 to 96% in 13 set. One of my underlying hypothesis
1122.08s: right now is still that earnings might move. The reason why I'm not fully confident in that is
1129.76s: because like we're coming up on time here, right? So the 4th is next Wednesday. We're essentially
1136.32s: a week out. You can't wait forever before you actually confirm when your earnings is going to be
1142.00s: released. So I can't help but find that a little intriguing. But it does look like there's a pretty
1149.12s: significant discrepancy here. So if it does move, it wouldn't surprise me. But if it does move,
1153.84s: I would also expect that to happen soon. Because again, we are coming up on time here.
1160.88s: Now the last thing when I was looking at GameStop, I was taking a look at the open interest, which
1165.44s: this is now starting to contract a little bit. So for total calls, there's 550,000 against 273,000
1172.72s: puts. So this is now moving away from the two to one ratio that I typically like to see in
1179.12s: something like this. So my overall idea here is the same as it's been. My guess is we are going to
1185.12s: be relatively quiet into earnings. That's my guess. If we take a look at this front expiration,
1191.44s: it's 114,000 calls against 26,000 puts. So still massive calls queue on the front
1196.56s: expirations. But it's just not that much. So relatively quiet from an options front.
1205.04s: Now when I look at the chart here, again, this down move is kind of continued. You can see the levels
1210.56s: I'm interested in. I think that we offer at least a first look at some level of support where it's
1218.00s: kind of bumping up to here, coming up on 2035 ish, something like that. And then below that,
1223.84s: there's a longer term volume node that I'm anchoring this off of kind of this value gap.
1229.28s: And it's starting to coincide with the 200 day moving average. So we have to see if GameStop grabs
1236.80s: a footing here. Now for me, a couple other breath indicators that I don't love is the RSI,
1242.72s: both moving average and RSI itself have now talked below the 50 line, which is kind of bullish
1250.32s: bear separator on a broad scale. And we also have the, let me zoom this up for you. You can see that
1259.20s: the RSI is now kind of peaked below negative sloping below the EMA, which in this case, I'm using
1267.12s: a four day EMA, which is pretty fast. So it does look like a bit of negative momentum here.
1272.48s: From a volume perspective, it's still quiet out there, four million shares. So a little bit higher
1277.92s: than the five day average, still below the 20. And it looks like some sideways action, slight
1283.28s: downtrend leading into the earnings release or until we have another catalyst, whatever that looks
1288.56s: like. So that's what it's looking like today. There's no live stream later today. Some doing a
1293.44s: podcast that I'm lining up with somebody on a different time zone. So I have to consume the
1298.88s: the later time. But as always, anything you want me to take a look at? Let me know. Hit me up.
1304.80s: Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
