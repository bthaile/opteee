0.00s:  What's up outliers bit of a day out there time for your weekly game stop update.
6.80s:  Now there was not a game stop stream this past weekend because your boy was getting over
11.20s:  some food poisoning from those haters over at Chipotle, but we're feeling better now
16.80s:  and ready to get back caught up with everything that's going on.
20.56s:  And there was some interesting news that broke today from Ryan Cohen.
24.12s:  I think it broke yesterday.
25.12s:  We'll talk about that a little bit later.
27.72s:  I thought that we would start with just analyzing where we're at now today with the company
31.48s:  and how things look because the broad market right now is going through a bit of a contraction.
37.88s:  So some of the movement that we're seeing in game stop recently is unique to game stop,
43.80s:  meaning the company itself and the overall movement of shares for the company itself.
50.28s:  Then also some of this is literally broader across the entire market because if we take a look at
56.68s:  let's say the S&P 500 for example, you can see the S&P 500 is down for consecutive days.
62.52s:  It's shedding. So this is actually the the broader market closing in not quite there yet,
69.24s:  but closing in on a correction. About a third of the way they're defining it as a 10% pullback
77.96s:  from term highs. So it's moving in that direction, but I think it still has a way to go from the
84.68s:  broader market. So some of this overall weakness is absolutely going to bleed over into individual
91.48s:  names like this. Now a couple of things that did surprise me. I fully expected and based on this
98.04s:  value area. I think we drew this two streams ago together. So this is a couple weeks old now.
103.48s:  So you can see that there was a volume node hanging out here. Lots of transactions at this price
107.72s:  level. And I genuinely didn't expect this move that we saw yesterday. I really would have
115.00s:  expected us to hang out in this volume node a little bit longer. The fact that we didn't do that
121.56s:  in that it's assuming this broader downtrend and now it's posting near term new lows.
129.72s:  So it posted a low here and now this is a lower low than this low. So what that means is the
137.96s:  broader downtrend obviously is intact and it's continuing. It's kind of big and ugly. I identify with
145.16s:  that mostly because in terms of trends, they're normally a little more organized than this kind
150.84s:  of like this. This is a less ugly uptrend, right? It's very organized. This is kind of all over
155.80s:  the place. There's some levels of consolidation built into it before resumption of a downtrend. So
161.40s:  the market is definitely kind of mixed different ways with where it views game stop right now.
170.28s:  And when I look at the company itself, a lot of this near term movement in my opinion is now
176.68s:  fully being driven by sentiment. This is being driven by short term positioning and a lot of people
182.92s:  managing risk, taking risk off not just in terms of individual positions within game stop,
189.08s:  but then also individual positions within things like XRT that feed into game stop. We're seeing
194.44s:  outflows and movements into defensive names. So until the market starts to consolidate and chill out,
203.40s:  which right now I'm still generally bullish on, I think that the impact AI is going to have
208.92s:  is literally as big as anything else we've ever seen bigger potentially than the internet.
214.60s:  So with that level of impact and prosperity ahead of us still, there's one of the most powerful
219.64s:  catalysts I can think of for growth and advancement. Now that doesn't mean that there can't be
224.36s:  bear market in between. There absolutely can be because we're trying to thread a needle with things
229.08s:  like inflation and now tariffs and stuff like that that make the overall picture really difficult
235.64s:  to manage through. So the idea that I have longer term is still always betting on prosperity
243.56s:  and development and growth of business, but near term it can look a lot of different ways. So
248.20s:  I wanted to give you all of that context for the movements that you're seeing here because the way
252.52s:  that I trade things like this personally will talk about the coverage-drungle position. I still
257.40s:  have that on. That's not on anywhere. And I will walk you through what it looks like as of today.
264.12s:  And right now it's just kind of like a sit and wait and hold.
267.96s:  Normally what I will do is unwind shares as it's going down and a big purpose for unwinding those
275.72s:  shares is so that I am what we would call value averaging, taking them down at a profit,
282.44s:  and then unwinding them before they turn into a loss, right? So securing a profit and then being
287.80s:  able to purchase more of the underlying. Now unfortunately I had done some of that already.
295.32s:  And the position is about as trim as I would want it to be given the way that GameStop moves.
301.32s:  So it's holding a loss right now and I'll walk you through all of that.
305.80s:  Now I do want to talk a little bit before we get into that just kind of like the current state
311.48s:  of GameStop as far as we can see. And if we take a look we can see that volatility is
317.48s:  creeping back up a little bit. So we're seeing over 100% vol here. We're seeing 101% vol in the front.
324.84s:  Part of that is going to be from the broader market movement. Part of that is going to be
328.76s:  probably from earnings right now, which are expected on 25 March after the close. So we have some ideas
336.68s:  on volatility moving around, but definitely entering the equation a little bit more heavily.
342.52s:  We can see that there were a ton of calls traded today relative to put 113,000 against 25.
348.20s:  But most of those came in below the bid. So sales probably people selling calls against shares.
354.36s:  It's kind of late to do that in my opinion when you're selling them now you're kind of selling the
357.96s:  calls when they're real low and cheap, which isn't my preferred methodology. But if you're late to
362.12s:  the punch or late to the punch, the options chain is quiet a F. I've not seen it this quiet in
369.96s:  some time now. So it's 557,000 calls against 184,000 puts nothing in here jumping out at me.
377.16s:  This is just very, very quiet. We're across all different expiration cycles. But one of the things
383.08s:  that is noteworthy from the open interest distribution is there is some localization in the
390.04s:  front expirations, but most of it is actually out here in 17 April. That's interesting because
398.44s:  it's not in the next primary expiration. It's in the second primary expiration out in time,
405.88s:  which is slightly abnormal. Normally we see almost all of the open interest concentrated in the front
412.44s:  individual cycle, but then the second largest concentration typically is found in the next
417.96s:  occurring primary expiration. And then we sometimes see stuff way further out in time in the 16 Jan,
425.16s:  15 Jan, out in 27 like super far out. So the fact that it's not here, but here is actually kind
431.80s:  of interesting. So let's take a quick look at the overall trend. So this is looking at a 30-day
442.04s:  flow of premium for puts and calls separately. And I want you to take a note as to how this is
450.68s:  in flow. If we look at where we had some of those really, really busy periods, you can see that it
458.36s:  did start to get a little busy back in January. Then it got super quiet, super quiet. Start to get a
466.04s:  little more active in fairly early fed quiet it down. And then it did spike up again, not that long
475.80s:  ago, but the spikes that you see now are just nothing in context. So even though that there are some,
484.28s:  you know, signs of life in terms of net overall premium traded, it's still just not very much.
491.08s:  So the options market has been quiet in game stop for some time now. And it's not a good thing,
499.00s:  bad thing. It just kind of is what it is. The company right now is starting to lean more and more
504.60s:  on its fundamental positioning. So speaking of fundamental positioning, I saw this post, okay,
511.08s:  so what was today? So this, I saw this post pop up. This was from CoinDesk and CoinDesk had commented
519.32s:  that strive asset management CEO Matt Cole urges Ryan Cohen, Chairman CEO of GameStop,
526.76s:  to adopt as a reserve asset to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset using the five billion in cash that's
533.56s:  sitting on the balance sheet. And Cohen responded letter received. This is
540.76s:  purely designed to build hype. That's the reality. Now, it would be very interesting if this is to
547.40s:  occur into what degree, but the only reason on planet earth, why Cohen would post like that is to build
555.88s:  some sort of hype around that idea because he absolutely knows that this is something that a lot of
561.80s:  GameStop holders have really requested for some time now is to add some Bitcoin. And I will continue
568.12s:  to reiterate the point. GameStop is here because of the shareholders, because of you, because of the
575.72s:  apes. Without you, the company overwhelmingly likely would have collapsed. So I do believe that
584.52s:  there's some element of him that fully understands and recognizes that and probably builds that
591.40s:  into some of the choices he's likely to make. So that's the main reason why he would comment on this,
600.04s:  because if he wanted to continue moving in the dark like he's been broadly, then there would be
604.92s:  the status quo, right? So the fact that he took the time to comment on this in a way that obviously
610.44s:  he's very public, that tells us something about the expected positioning. So it actually would not
616.76s:  surprise me at all to see GameStop start to scoop up some Bitcoin. Now I also have to be honest
622.92s:  though, I thought we would have seen a little bit of life bleed into GameStop on even that tweet.
632.36s:  So if we zoom this in a little bit further to get some context on the volume, I mean, I did expect
638.92s:  to see a little bit more life, but the average volume is still bleeding down. And this is probably
647.00s:  not lack in part to the fact that Bitcoin itself is performing poorly. So the idea of moving into
656.92s:  Bitcoin right now, although it's probably smarter for the longer term horizon. But in the shorter
662.28s:  term, it's kind of like, man, you know, depending on when they look at doing this, you might just be
665.72s:  buying something that's going down in the short term. That's not super ideal. So there's probably
671.40s:  a little bit of an element of that being tied into the movement that you see here in GameStop.
680.12s:  So let's take a quick look at the coverage strangle as promised. So right now I'm still sitting on
685.88s:  250 shares. You can see I'm all the way up at 28.21. So super far underwater, just kind of
692.68s:  sitting there holding things. And that is what it is. So I do have two different
699.40s:  tranches of short options out. I'm short, the 25 puts in 21 March. These are probably going to have
704.76s:  to be rolled. And then I'm short, the 35 calls in 21 March. These are down at like 40 cents or
711.16s:  something like that. These can come down to the profit at pretty much whenever I want. So the
716.20s:  game plan here is really straightforward. I'm not adding any shares to the long equity position
722.60s:  yet because you can see we're already pretty well utilized at 78%. One of the things that I might do
729.72s:  is when I roll these short puts, I might size these down by one contract. By sizing this down by
737.72s:  one contract, I unlock another hundred shares that I have access to to do whatever I want. And in
745.96s:  this case, what I would want is as GameStop starts to consolidate and show strength, slowly start
755.08s:  nibbling on some shares to build up this position. Now this is the downside. Essentially of managing
761.24s:  a smaller position. Like if I was managing, you can see the other coverage strangle that I typically
765.64s:  trade. They're larger positions because you need a decent bit of capital in order to employ
771.24s:  the idea in its largest and purest form. But even with a really small allocation of $25,000,
778.36s:  it's still completely viable. It just means we have to be a little more cautious with the silver
782.60s:  bullets that we use and the silver bullets, meaning the remaining money. So the scenario here
787.96s:  actually is pretty, pretty simple, to be honest. We're not using a bunch of the total amount
796.36s:  allocated to it in the shares. We're literally using only $7,000 of this total 25. So the majority
802.52s:  of what we see here is tied to these short puts, which is exactly what I want. I want it as a
808.68s:  satellite position. Because right now, this would be something I just continue to hold. There's
815.40s:  nothing I need to do with this. The basis is fine. It's a little high, but it's okay, and it'll
819.64s:  absolutely come down as I slowly start to scale in with more shares. So that's all there is to be
825.96s:  done here. It's a little bit of taking a tactical pause, letting things move as they do. One of the
830.76s:  cool things about trading the coverage strangle is even though this kind of stuff is going on,
835.56s:  we still have profits built from prior short options that we've sold and taken in. So we have
841.88s:  $692 and puts $353 in short calls. None of this is right home about, but if you think about it,
850.04s:  it's about a thousand bucks on something that that's realized profit. And in the time span that I
856.60s:  started trading this for you all, it's up about 0.45%. So it's not a bad return. That's realized
863.72s:  PNL. That's not including what's up here, the extra $142. And this will probably come in at a
869.96s:  loss because I'm going to have to roll it. But the point is by trading these options around it,
874.04s:  even though it's not doing what we would like it to do, we can still make some money. So that's
878.68s:  the game plan is now. If you have any questions, as always, let me know, be an outlier. I'll see you
883.48s:  later.
