0.00s: What's up outliers bit of a day out there time for your weekly game stop update.
6.80s: Now there was not a game stop stream this past weekend because your boy was getting over
11.20s: some food poisoning from those haters over at Chipotle, but we're feeling better now
16.80s: and ready to get back caught up with everything that's going on.
20.56s: And there was some interesting news that broke today from Ryan Cohen.
24.12s: I think it broke yesterday.
25.12s: We'll talk about that a little bit later.
27.72s: I thought that we would start with just analyzing where we're at now today with the company
31.48s: and how things look because the broad market right now is going through a bit of a contraction.
37.88s: So some of the movement that we're seeing in game stop recently is unique to game stop,
43.80s: meaning the company itself and the overall movement of shares for the company itself.
50.28s: Then also some of this is literally broader across the entire market because if we take a look at
56.68s: let's say the S&P 500 for example, you can see the S&P 500 is down for consecutive days.
62.52s: It's shedding. So this is actually the the broader market closing in not quite there yet,
69.24s: but closing in on a correction. About a third of the way they're defining it as a 10% pullback
77.96s: from term highs. So it's moving in that direction, but I think it still has a way to go from the
84.68s: broader market. So some of this overall weakness is absolutely going to bleed over into individual
91.48s: names like this. Now a couple of things that did surprise me. I fully expected and based on this
98.04s: value area. I think we drew this two streams ago together. So this is a couple weeks old now.
103.48s: So you can see that there was a volume node hanging out here. Lots of transactions at this price
107.72s: level. And I genuinely didn't expect this move that we saw yesterday. I really would have
115.08s: expected us to hang out in this volume node a little bit longer. The fact that we didn't do that
121.56s: in that it's assuming this broader downtrend. And now it's posting near term new lows. So it
130.12s: posted a low here. And now this is a lower low than this low. So what that means is the broader
138.52s: downtrend obviously is intact and it's continuing. It's kind of big and ugly. I identify with that
146.20s: mostly because in terms of trends, they're normally a little more organized than this kind of like
151.00s: this. This is a less ugly uptrend. Right. It's very organized. This is kind of all over the place.
156.20s: There's some levels of consolidation built into it before resumption of a downtrend. So the
161.48s: market is definitely kind of mixed different ways with where it views game stop right now.
170.28s: And when I look at the company itself, a lot of this near term movement in my opinion is now
176.68s: fully being driven by sentiment. This is being driven by short term positioning. And a lot of people
182.92s: managing risk, taking risk off not just in terms of individual positions within game stop,
189.08s: but then also individual positions within things like XRT that feed into game stop. We're seeing
194.44s: outflows and movements into defensive names. So until the market starts to consolidate and chill out,
203.40s: which right now I'm still generally bullish on. I think that the impact AI is going to have
208.92s: is literally as big as anything else we've ever seen bigger potentially than the internet.
214.60s: So with that level of impact and prosperity ahead of us still, there's one of the most powerful
219.64s: catalysts I can think of for growth and advancement. Now that doesn't mean that there can't be
224.36s: bear market in between. There absolutely can be because we're trying to thread a needle with
228.76s: things like inflation and now tariffs and stuff like that that make the overall picture really
234.68s: difficult to manage through. So the idea that I have longer term is still always betting on
242.92s: prosperity and development and growth of business. But near term, it can look a lot of different ways.
247.72s: So I wanted to give you all of that context for the movements that you're seeing here because the
252.28s: way that I trade things like this personally, we'll talk about the coverage triangle position.
257.16s: I still have that on that's not on anywhere. And I will walk you through what it looks like as of
263.48s: today and right now it's just kind of like a sit and wait and hold.
267.96s: Normally what I will do is unwind shares as it's going down and a big purpose for unwinding those shares
276.68s: is so that I am what we would call value averaging, taking them down at a profit and then
283.08s: unwinding them before they turn into a loss, right? So securing a profit and then being able to
288.20s: purchase more of the underlying. Now unfortunately, I had done some of that already and the position is
296.76s: about as trim as I would want it to be given the way that game stop moves. So it's holding a loss
302.92s: right now and I'll walk you through all of that. Now I do want to talk a little bit before we get
309.00s: into that just kind of like the current state of game stop as far as we can see. And if we take a
315.24s: look, we can see that volatility is creeping back up a little bit. So we're seeing over 100%
321.16s: vol here. We're seeing 101% vol in the front. Part of that is going to be from the broader market
326.76s: movement. Part of that is going to be probably from earnings right now, which are expected on 25
331.88s: March after the close. So we have some ideas on volatility moving around, but definitely entering
339.96s: the equation a little bit more heavily. We can see that there were a ton of calls traded today
345.00s: relative to puts 113,000 against 25. But most of those came in below the bid. So sales probably
352.36s: people selling calls against shares. It's kind of late to do that in my opinion when you're selling
357.00s: them now, you're kind of selling the calls when they're real low and cheap, which isn't my preferred
360.28s: methodology. But if you're late to the punch or late to the punch, the options chain is quiet AF.
368.60s: I've not seen it this quiet in some time now. So it's 557,000 calls against 184,000 puts nothing
375.40s: in here jumping out at me. This is just very, very quiet. We're across all different exploration
381.24s: cycles. But one of the things that is noteworthy from the open interest distribution is there is some
388.68s: localization in the front explorations, but most of it is actually out here in 17 April.
396.76s: That's interesting because it's not in the next primary exploration. It's in the second
403.80s: primary exploration out in time, which is slightly abnormal. Normally, we see almost all of the
409.56s: open interest concentrated in the front individual cycle, but then the second largest concentration
415.72s: typically is found in the next occurring primary exploration. And then we sometimes see stuff
423.40s: way further out in time in the 16 Jan, 15 Jan, out in 27, like super far out. So the fact that it's
430.36s: not here, but here is actually kind of interesting. So let's take a quick look at the overall trend.
439.64s: So this is looking at a 30 day flow of premium or puts in calls separately. And I want you to take a
447.80s: note as to how this is ebbed in flow. If we look at where we had some of those really, really busy
456.04s: periods, you can see that it did start to get a little busy back in January. Then it got super quiet,
464.44s: super quiet, start to get a little more active in feb kind of early feb quiet it down. And then it
471.64s: did spike up again, not that long ago, but the spikes that you see now are just nothing in context.
481.56s: So even though that there are some signs of life in terms of net overall premium traded,
488.04s: it's still just not very much. So the options market has been quiet in gamestop for some time now.
497.64s: And it's not a good thing. Bad thing. It just kind of is what it is. The company right now is
503.00s: starting to lean more and more on its fundamental positioning. So speaking of fundamental positioning,
509.88s: I saw this post. Okay. So what was today? So this I saw this post pop up. This was from coin desk
516.20s: in coin desk had commented that strive asset management CEO Matt Cole urges Ryan Cohen, Chairman
525.32s: CEO of gamestop to adopt as a reserve asset to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset using the five
532.68s: billion in cash that's sitting on the balance sheet. And Cohen responded letter received.
538.44s: This is purely designed to build hype. That's the reality. Now it would be very interesting if this is
547.16s: to occur into what degree, but the only reason on planet earth why Cohen would post like that
555.24s: is to build some sort of hype around that idea because he absolutely knows that this is something
561.00s: that a lot of gamestop holders have really requested for some time now is to add some Bitcoin.
567.08s: And I will continue to reiterate the point. Gamestop is here because of the shareholders,
573.40s: because of you, because of the apes. Without you, the company overwhelmingly likely would have
581.64s: collapsed. So I do believe that there's some element of him that fully understands and recognizes
588.52s: that and probably builds that into some of the choices he's likely to make. So that's the main
597.96s: reason why he would comment on this because if he wanted to continue moving in the dark like he's
602.92s: been broadly, then they would be the status quo. Right. So the fact that he took the time to comment
608.44s: on this in a way that obviously is very public that tells us something about the expected positioning.
615.08s: So it actually would not surprise me at all to see gamestop start to scoop up some Bitcoin.
621.00s: Now I also have to be honest though, I thought we would have seen a little bit of life bleed into
629.56s: gamestop on even that tweet. So if we zoom this in a little bit further to get some context on
636.76s: the volume, I mean, I did expect to see a little bit more life, but the average volume is still
644.04s: bleeding down. And this is probably not lack in part to the fact that Bitcoin itself is performing
654.04s: poorly. So the idea of moving into Bitcoin right now, although it's probably smarter for the longer
660.44s: term horizon, but in the shorter term, it's kind of like, man, you know, depending on when they
664.52s: look at doing this, you might just be buying something that's going down in the short term. That's
667.72s: not super ideal. So there's probably a little bit of an element of that being tied into the movement
675.96s: that you see here in gamestop. So let's take a quick look at the coverage strangle as promised. So
684.68s: right now I'm still sitting on 250 shares. You can see I'm all the way up at 28 21. So super far
691.08s: underwater, just kind of sitting there holding things. And that is what it is. So I do have two
699.08s: different tranches of short options out. I'm short the 25 puts in 21 March. These are probably going
704.44s: to have to be rolled. And then I'm short the 35 calls in 21 March. These are down at like 40 cents
711.08s: or something like that. These can come down to profit at pretty much whenever I want. So the
716.20s: game plan here is really straightforward. I'm not adding any shares to the long equity position
722.60s: yet because you can see we're already pretty well utilized at 78%. One of the things that I might do
729.72s: is when I roll these short puts, I might size these down by one contract. By sizing this down by
737.72s: one contract, I unlock another hundred shares that I have access to to do whatever I want. And in
745.96s: this case, what I would want is as gamestop starts to consolidate and show strength slowly start
755.08s: nibbling on some shares to build up this position. Now this is the downside. Essentially of managing
761.24s: a smaller position. Like if I was managing, you can see the other coverage strangle that I typically
765.64s: trade. They're larger positions because you need a decent bit of capital in order to employ
771.24s: the idea in its largest and purest form. But even with a really small allocation of $25,000,
778.36s: it's still completely viable. It just means we have to be a little more cautious with the silver
782.60s: bullets that we use and the silver bullets meaning the remaining money. So the scenario here actually
788.44s: is pretty, pretty simple to be honest. We're not using a bunch of the total amount allocated to
797.16s: it in the shares. We're literally using only $7,000 of this total 25. So the majority of what we see
803.96s: here is tied to these short puts, which is exactly what I want. I want it as a satellite position
810.12s: because right now that this would be something I just continue to hold. There's nothing I need to
816.28s: do with this. The basis is fine. It's a little high, but it's okay and it'll absolutely come down
821.08s: as I slowly start to scale in with more shares. So that's all there is to be done here. It's a little
827.56s: bit of taking a tactical pause, letting things move as they do. One of the cool things about trading
832.52s: the coverage strangle is even though this kind of stuff is going on, we still have profits built
837.80s: from prior short options that we've sold and taken in. So we have $692 and puts $353 in
846.36s: short calls. None of this is straight home about, but if you think about it, it's about a thousand bucks
852.04s: on something that that's realized profit. And in the time span that I started trading this for you all,
858.36s: it's up about 0.45%. So it's not a bad return. That's realized P&L. That's not including what's up
865.88s: here, the extra $142. And this will probably come in at a loss because I'm going to have to roll it.
871.72s: But the point is by trading these options around it, even though it's not doing what we would like
875.80s: it to do, we can still make some money. So that's the game plan is now. If you have any questions,
881.48s: as always, let me know, be in our lawyer. I'll see you all later.
