0.12s: option volatility it's super
2.00s: straightforward there's really no need
4.00s: for a video on it because you already
5.96s: know the difference between implied
8.52s: realized future realized forecast
12.08s: historic volatilities that all makes
13.84s: sense to you am I right you're anything
15.60s: like me when I first started out trading
17.36s: that all Probably sounds like a bunch of
19.00s: nothing so the goal of this video is to
21.80s: walk through all of those to give you at
24.28s: least a surface level understanding of
26.04s: these different kinds of volatility
27.28s: because they are different things so
28.96s: that you understand how this fits into
31.28s: options markets what's up everybody Eric
34.32s: here welcome back to all the outliers
35.60s: and a shout out to the patreon family
37.40s: you guys make content like this possible
39.24s: if what I do helps you out consider
40.88s: signing up let's get started so we have
45.00s: option volatility what is volatility
47.48s: well really it's just a fancy term for
50.04s: deviation or dispersion what does this
52.92s: mean simple if you take a look at this
54.96s: chart of Microsoft you see these linear
57.64s: regression channels I have a video on
60.04s: those actually I'll throw in the notes
61.72s: below but this middle line here is kind
64.48s: of like a line of best fit for all of
66.60s: the data on this chart so when we move
69.44s: up above or down below that's dispersion
72.92s: from whatever this mean is so that's
76.48s: what we're talking about the variance of
79.80s: something and in this case in trading
81.96s: we're specifically referring to
84.20s: different Securities so let's talk about
86.56s: the common types of volatility there is
89.36s: implied historic realized future
92.00s: realized and forecast we're going to go
94.52s: through all of these quickly so that you
96.16s: have a working understanding of these
98.36s: and then at the end of the video I'm
99.68s: going to walk you through some of the
101.08s: common scales for implied volatility
103.48s: because if you're an options Trader that
104.88s: will be important to you to understand
106.80s: the difference between implied
108.28s: volatility Rank and implied volatility
110.48s: percentile because they're not the same
112.28s: thing so let's start with implied
114.44s: volatility in short this is expected
118.00s: volatility for various time frames that
120.92s: we infer from an options price so
124.52s: because I was looking at Microsoft
126.00s: before we're going to keep looking at
127.36s: Microsoft and we can figure out what the
130.44s: implied volatility is for every single
132.36s: one of these options that's what this
134.16s: column is here for the put side and this
136.40s: column here for the call side the reason
139.44s: why this matters is because if you think
141.72s: about trading options they have two
145.80s: different pieces to their premium they
148.52s: have intrinsic and extrinsic value
151.20s: implied volatility lives in the
153.96s: extrinsic value the time value of an
157.40s: option so we can isolate what the
160.64s: implied volatility is per strike we can
163.76s: look at the implied volatility per
165.96s: expiration cycle so for example again
168.96s: looking at Microsoft the 15 December
170.96s: expiration cycle the implied volatility
173.08s: there is a
174.36s: 21.25% that infers a
177.56s: 12.96 expected move with within one
180.20s: standard deviation that's all this is so
183.12s: it is the expected movement of something
186.60s: so implied volatility has a lot of uses
189.20s: to us now what is historic volatility it
192.72s: measures the realized volatility for a
195.88s: specific period so if we go back here
199.16s: and we look at Microsoft and we look at
202.28s: something like this this little handy
204.96s: dandy volatility think script that I use
208.96s: and kind of modify it quite a bit over
210.60s: time but if you notice there's hv2 hv5
214.32s: HV 21 this is historic volatility for
218.92s: different time frames so you can isolate
221.80s: what the volatility was for specific
224.80s: time frames now realized volatility in
228.08s: can be a couple things when we're
229.96s: talking about realized volatility in
232.08s: general parlament and general speak it
234.16s: is the volatility that's realized in the
236.88s: underlying it's also known as the
238.40s: statistical volatility a lot of times
240.92s: these two will be used interchangeably
243.32s: and that's okay as long as we understand
246.36s: that realized volatility can also be
249.48s: future realized volatility what the hell
252.64s: is that what well this is the realized
257.28s: prediction of future V and this is
260.64s: different than forecast volatility which
263.44s: is the prediction of future volatility
266.52s: so think of it this way we can forecast
268.68s: volatility if you have an implied
270.36s: volatility surface and you're a
272.00s: sophisticated Trader you create your own
274.24s: assessment of volatility you've just
275.96s: forecasted volatility most options
278.84s: Traders especially on the retail side we
281.36s: are dealing with implied volatility this
283.48s: is volatility that is derived from the
286.00s: options price so the smart people in the
288.96s: market are looking at their forecasted
292.44s: volatility and then us retail Traders
295.16s: are looking at what's implied via the
297.52s: pricing of an option then you can assess
301.36s: future realized volatility which tells
303.96s: us how accurate the prediction was of
308.16s: fall make sense good great let's now
312.88s: talk about some implied volatility
315.52s: scales the reason why this matters is if
318.76s: we take a look at Microsoft here and we
322.28s: look at the current implied volatility
324.88s: which is 21% 21.29% is that high or low
330.72s: you can't really tell because there's
333.32s: nothing to compare it against you can
335.40s: have things that have
337.20s: 130% implied volatility that that's
340.32s: actually not very high relative to what
343.28s: that specific products implied
345.28s: volatility typically is again if you
348.00s: think about volatility as the dispersion
350.16s: of things if we look at the implied
352.00s: volatility for Microsoft that's 21.29%
355.04s: and then if you look at it for Tesla
357.16s: it's 49% so we expect Tesla to be a
361.32s: little bit more volatile than Microsoft
363.32s: but when we look at this 49% is this
365.60s: High relative for Tesla well this is
368.24s: exactly why we need things like IV Rank
370.52s: and IV percentile now there's a big
373.16s: difference between these two and in my
375.40s: opinion IV percentile is a much better
379.12s: metric that is less prone to skew why is
383.28s: that well let's take a look at how
384.96s: implied volatility rank is calculated we
386.92s: have the current IV we subtract the 52
390.20s: we IV low then we divide that by the 52e
394.24s: IV High less the 52e IV low so what
397.96s: you'll notice is we're using the
399.48s: extremes we're using the high we're
401.44s: using the low now in typical markets the
405.84s: difference between IV Rank and IV
407.88s: percentile is not that crazy however
411.16s: when we are in more extreme markets this
414.40s: can be massively different which I'll
416.48s: show you in just a second but before
418.24s: that let's take a look at what IV
420.04s: percentile is instead of using the
422.40s: extremes we take count of trading days
426.00s: that are below the current IV then we
429.72s: divide that by the number of trading
431.52s: days so typically you'd use something
433.28s: like 252 so this is just looking at a
436.48s: pure tally it doesn't really care what
439.68s: the extremes were what it cares is where
442.16s: we are relative to its previous
444.88s: performance now a fun fact this is from
447.64s: thinker swim and the the current IV
450.16s: percentile here actually is IV rank this
453.40s: is completely wrong and you'll see that
455.60s: in just a second because I want you to
458.12s: do the math for both of these why do we
460.80s: why do we have to go through this every
462.04s: time this one's a little more difficult
463.60s: you kind of can do the math on your own
465.64s: I have a think script for it but I do
467.84s: want you to do the math for the IV rank
470.68s: for this and then throw it in the
472.84s: comments below what you got before I
475.20s: click on to see if you are correct now
477.96s: you'll see that if if we do the math on
480.48s: this the IV rank for this scenario the
483.40s: current IV is
485.16s: 19.38% so that's this here then we're
487.40s: going to take the 52e IV low which is
489.76s: from here 177 then we're going to divide
492.84s: that by the 52e IV High which is 442
496.12s: less 52 we IV low again .177 and you're
500.04s: going to get 6.3% notice that this
503.48s: happens to be the same in this scenario
505.96s: so what am I referring to then when
508.36s: we're talking about being quite
510.32s: different simple in this example the IV
514.08s: percentile currently for this product
517.28s: which was Apple is 5% so if this is
520.28s: actually IV percentile this should be 5%
523.80s: not 6% but the this is actually IV rank
528.00s: now this doesn't seem like that big of a
530.20s: difference because it's not the market
532.00s: has been relatively Consolidated for
534.28s: periods of time now however if you look
536.84s: at old performance the this is an OG
540.32s: video of Eric check that out some Eric
542.64s: Inception this was during Co and I don't
545.40s: remember what product I was looking at
547.44s: here but the important part is if you
549.60s: look at the IV rank in this scenario
552.08s: whatever it was it was
554.28s: 3.26% however IV percentile was 66% so
559.20s: during covid when there's a lot of
561.24s: volatility this is literally two times
563.96s: that's a massive difference when we're
566.48s: looking at things now it's not that big
568.36s: of a difference because things are
569.76s: relatively low so you're not going to
571.76s: see that big of a skew but it's
572.96s: important for you to know that IV rank
575.40s: is much more skew prone than IV
578.76s: percentile you are going to get a better
581.04s: assessment of IV's performance against
584.24s: itself in an individual product via
586.40s: percentile versus IV rank that is the
589.56s: long and short of it so as always if you
592.00s: have any questions hit me up let me know
594.36s: make sure you hit up think or Swim let
595.84s: them know that they're wrong I've let
597.24s: them know this a million times they
598.44s: don't change it but uh who knows maybe
600.76s: Schwab will get it together and fix it
602.44s: for us but otherwise you should know
604.40s: that that is not IV percentile that's
606.04s: ranked and it is prone to skew if
607.88s: there's anything I missed throw it in
609.36s: the comments below don't forget like
611.00s: subscribe share be an outlier it's the
613.88s: only way to be catch youall later
