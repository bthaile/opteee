0.52s: what's up everyone taking a quick look
2.20s: at the GameStop options chain to kick us
4.92s: off for this week I just want to see if
7.04s: anything looks interesting over the
8.36s: weekend if we've seen any changes in
9.84s: volatility we'll make a quick update on
12.84s: what we have in terms of open interest
15.80s: volatility volume those kinds of things
18.20s: so that we know what we're heading into
19.96s: and a quick shout out to my buddy
22.96s: Richard he and I spoke yesterday for a
27.20s: good part of the afternoon it was like
28.92s: 4-Hour conversation it was so so useful
32.60s: to me because as I've mentioned to you
34.04s: guys numerous times I am a guest in this
37.20s: house I don't have all of the background
38.88s: to history that you all do but I am
41.44s: enthralled by the story it's a giant
44.20s: puzzle that I am enjoying interacting
46.48s: with because I've been trading options
47.92s: for a long time I'm pretty good at that
50.48s: and it becomes generally programmatic
52.60s: after a while so having something pop up
54.84s: like this that truly is anomalous has
57.80s: been very fun for me to dig deeper into
60.44s: I've traded GameStop before during other
62.80s: episodes but I didn't quite get as deep
65.44s: into the lore and Richard essentially
67.44s: gave me a master class he took the time
69.84s: during his afternoon to share that with
71.32s: me so I'm beyond thankful I'm sure most
73.32s: of you already know his channel but if
75.24s: not you absolutely should go check it
76.84s: out subscribe he is a incredible
79.60s: resource on GameStop he's built this
82.16s: giant Google sheet that he shares with
83.52s: everybody for free tons of awesome
85.72s: information all right where did we leave
88.68s: off on the 28th of June Friday well
91.20s: pretty simple we saw a couple
93.72s: interesting transactions come through
96.24s: however most of the larger transactions
99.76s: that took place on Friday in terms of
102.28s: the options markets were kind of
104.12s: sporadic we had a couple going out into
107.76s: five July this is also five July these
109.80s: should all be shaded the same color and
112.92s: most of the transactions that we saw
114.72s: were buys but nothing too large we had
117.80s: some activity out in 12 July and 19 July
121.28s: 19 July is starting to get a bit more
123.72s: active with the second largest size on
126.40s: here except for this one really
128.04s: interesting trade where it looked like
129.80s: somebody was establishing a position at
131.68s: the 11 calls essentially to get assigned
133.68s: that's what it looked like to me so
136.56s: let's hop over to the platform take a
138.12s: look at what we're seeing now so right
140.32s: now we have about
141.88s: 131% IV the first thing that is very
146.36s: anomalous to me is how steady this is
149.32s: across different Cycles so if we go back
152.24s: here volatility kind of popped up a
154.88s: little bit but it's still drastically
157.12s: suppressed from what we saw some time
159.28s: ago the reason why I care so much about
161.92s: this I had a couple people ask me why I
163.56s: talk about this part so much is because
165.48s: option markets are very smart they're
167.48s: actually pretty predictive so what that
169.56s: means is there are studies that look at
173.52s: changes in both the at the money call
177.48s: and put implied volatilities across
180.72s: different iterations and how predictive
183.36s: that is of future price movements
185.40s: without going all the way down the
187.20s: rabbit hole of the study although I will
188.84s: happily link to a couple of them in the
190.40s: notes below for you to check out as I
191.88s: always say you should believe none of
194.08s: what you hear half of what you see you
195.80s: should be able to validate most of what
197.40s: people say if you're to believe them and
200.12s: this is another one of those instances
201.36s: you should absolutely check that study
202.56s: out but when I look at the volatility
205.24s: here in GameStop it's actually very
207.36s: telling to me when I start to see really
209.92s: big call volatility there's a natural
213.68s: tendency as we get closer to expiration
215.32s: for the really far out of the Monies to
216.68s: drift up that typically won't outpace
219.08s: the putside the putside typically will
220.88s: trade at a higher IV because the market
222.88s: tends to fear the downside more we're at
225.52s: a weird spot now because with this
227.44s: recent share offering essentially the
229.12s: removal of debt from Gamestop they kind
231.92s: of have a a capped in downside even at a
235.52s: cash value so it's still quite a bit
238.56s: lower technically than where it is now
240.20s: if I'm not mistaken it's like 13 or so
242.60s: per share but that's still essentially a
244.76s: floor that eventually gets baked into
246.80s: the product so that part is slightly
249.48s: interesting there's still again a pretty
251.84s: decent amount it would have to go to get
253.36s: there so when I look at the volatility
255.52s: across these different expiration Cycles
258.96s: there's a couple things that stick out
260.28s: to me I'm going to focus on the primary
262.36s: expiration Cycles the 19th July and the
264.12s: 16 August I know that this doesn't
266.40s: discreetly line up with some of the
269.04s: cycle theor that are going around
270.96s: Richard and I were actually talking
272.40s: quite a bit about his his most recent
274.40s: one which is fascinating and very well
277.00s: informed I believe and right now I'm
281.12s: just not seeing the option markets
282.92s: necessarily mirroring too much of it but
285.40s: it could also be that it's a little too
286.92s: early a lot of what Richard is looking
288.84s: at is kind of out more towards the
290.48s: beginning of August and you have to get
293.68s: through these front expirations markets
295.72s: options markets are very active maybe
298.32s: two three weeks out and and that's
300.24s: because most people are looking for a
301.56s: bunch of liquidity especially for bigger
303.24s: positions up in the front expiration
305.32s: Cycles now this 5 July expiration is
308.92s: interesting because we have a holiday
311.80s: that tends to lead to muted volatility
314.92s: and that's partially why you see these
316.76s: two vs these two expiration vs being
319.00s: essentially the same typically at least
321.12s: as of late with GameStop the front
323.08s: expiration is almost always been higher
325.20s: but this flattening is going to be
327.20s: largely in part due to the holiday
329.16s: that's coming up in the market being
331.64s: when I look across the open interest in
334.48s: the five July there's nothing too
337.92s: interesting here now I know a lot of
340.80s: people were talking about in the last
343.08s: expiration cycle this call wall and it's
346.60s: okay to call it that but I think people
348.68s: were kind of mistaken the origin of it
350.96s: before I think it was at like the 125s
352.44s: and the 128s they were thinking that it
355.08s: could be like institutions scaling in
357.20s: positions and whatnot and it can be but
360.32s: based on the buying activity that I've
362.28s: been seeing in these really far outof
364.76s: the- money strikes I don't actually
367.68s: think it's in part large from
370.88s: institutions but a lot of retail Traders
374.00s: so if I
375.24s: kill this size requirement and if we
378.92s: only want to look at the out of the
381.24s: money let's take a look at this front
383.48s: series the five July and if we want to
386.96s: take a look at the furthest out of the
388.68s: money there was what the
391.56s: 95s so if we take a look at the 95s and
394.56s: we're only going to allow us to look at
396.32s: the 95s so we'll be able to see clearly
398.16s: the buying activity around the 95s let's
400.44s: see what we see notice the size of the
403.04s: vast majority of these trades they're
404.72s: tiny one lot four Lot 10 lot 15 Lot 10
407.84s: lot and all of these are bought when the
410.20s: options are trading at 3 cents so this
414.36s: absolutely can be a lot of small
417.20s: positions being built by larger
419.68s: institutions but it would still have to
421.88s: be much larger size than this if you're
424.60s: an institution trying to place a larger
426.92s: trade if you look at the largest trade
429.84s: on here which came in at 220 Lots at
432.84s: four bucks it's less than $1,000
435.04s: position it's
436.40s: $880 you'd essentially have to take all
438.92s: of this and it still wouldn't even be a
441.36s: fraction of the size needed for it to be
443.48s: like a quote unquote institutional
445.12s: position this to me just looks like a
447.36s: lot of people speculating on far out of
449.12s: the money on options because they're
450.28s: cheap and they're generally misguided on
453.44s: how these are likely to perform over the
455.24s: time frame but this is just a ton of
458.04s: tiny little trades all the way out into
461.52s: next week this this coming Friday and
464.68s: part of it is probably due to the cycle
466.36s: analysis that people have done and
467.92s: they're trying to front run the moves
469.56s: which is again you can choose to try to
471.56s: bottom ticket and front run the move but
473.32s: it's difficult to make money that way
475.36s: now I want to take a quick look at the
477.76s: 19th July expiration ccle because this
480.20s: is kind of like the the next main active
482.44s: cycle because it is a primary standard
486.08s: expiration cycle as I've told you guys
487.68s: before the weekly they will still be
489.56s: active but they won't have the same
490.96s: activity that the primary expirations
493.12s: which is the third Friday of each month
495.36s: and that's because people are looking
496.52s: for liquidity and there are some pretty
498.96s: big positions here so at the 25s there's
502.00s: 19,000 at the 30s there's
505.44s: 25,000 at the 40s there's 19,000 and as
509.32s: I say those numbers what do you notice
510.72s: they're all kind of like round numbers
512.08s: right 25 30 40 again most larger trades
516.08s: are going to be done at these whole
517.24s: strikes and that again is for liquidity
521.28s: let's go all the way out here we have a
523.56s: big block at the 125s 35k and then at
528.40s: the 100s 21k so let's take a look at
531.60s: these 125s in 19 July and see what kind
534.76s: of activity is going on here so we need
537.52s: to take this up to 125 and then we need
540.24s: to kill this series go to this series
541.92s: let's see the size of these trades the
544.20s: biggest one was 95 so again just taking
548.24s: a quick look at the total value of that
550.60s: trade 95 time 28 bucks it's 2660 it's a
555.68s: small position it's a $2,000 trade
557.88s: that's the biggest one if we go through
560.48s: and scroll down through these to take a
562.24s: look at what the general sizes of these
563.92s: trades I see some 40s some double digits
566.52s: the vast majority I'm seeing are singles
568.88s: triples doubles that's what's jumping
570.76s: out to my eyes so far and as I go
573.32s: through this again I see some tens but
575.68s: still very small positions these are at
577.24s: 20 cents so what I'm highlighting is
580.60s: really the same thing I'm seeing in the
582.20s: near-term expiration cycle the five jues
584.36s: this just looks like a lot of people
586.12s: putting on very small highly speculative
588.96s: trades hoping something hits these are
591.20s: very small trades so that doesn't mean
593.64s: that there's nobody large lurking that's
595.72s: actually one of the biggest things that
597.16s: I'm keeping an eyeball on to see when we
599.72s: do see some serious buying activity I
602.00s: have all different kinds of scans that
603.48s: start kicking off as soon as that
604.96s: happens that's how I got alerted to
606.20s: chewy last week that's how I got alerted
607.68s: to GameStop in the beginning it's
609.12s: because I'm very interested in catching
611.04s: this stuff as it's going off because
612.32s: again for me primarily an option Traders
614.80s: World I I'm just looking to make money
616.96s: on movement I don't really care if it's
618.40s: up down sideways I need movement in some
621.28s: capacity so that's how I keep an eyeball
623.28s: out for these kinds of things so more to
625.64s: come this week as we get through another
627.84s: shout out to Richard I'm hoping that and
629.52s: I can connect again we're going to talk
630.80s: about maybe do sort of like live stream
633.68s: because I feel like I have so many
635.60s: beginner questions that might be useful
637.28s: for other people's context kind of
639.60s: looking at the world of gme through a
641.36s: beginner's eyes and then I hopefully can
643.68s: help color in some lines around the
646.68s: option space how we can use this because
648.44s: I do think that there's a piece here
650.28s: that we can use this for options
651.88s: predictive capabilities to kind of key
653.84s: off when the market starts suspecting a
655.80s: move might be a little bit late but
657.76s: we'll have to see I'm doing a bunch of
659.96s: testing right now on that so as always
663.44s: any questions let me know be an outlier
665.16s: I'll see you guys later
