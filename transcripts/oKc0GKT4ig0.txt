0.00s: Does technical analysis even work?
3.60s: This is a common question and the answer is absolutely it does.
7.92s: Now, it's like any other kind of analysis though.
10.08s: There's no magic.
11.08s: It's not going to give you a predictive outcome.
14.20s: Technical analysis is very useful for a probabilistic
17.72s: assessment of things.
19.24s: That means that if we have a stock that falls below, for example,
22.64s: it's 50-day moving average.
23.88s: It's more likely to at least go down in additional day.
27.44s: That doesn't mean every single time it's going to.
29.44s: But very frequently it will.
31.36s: So the way to think about technical analysis is that it's literally just
34.88s: observing price behavior.
36.76s: This is the actual supply and demand function of people going in the market
41.40s: and doing things.
42.12s: It's their footprint.
43.60s: So you can learn how people are behaving and what they're trying to do
47.92s: because it's important to remember.
49.76s: Institutions in big money can't move that fast.
52.48s: Takes multiple days for them to build positions.
54.24s: So it absolutely does work.
55.76s: It's just not magic.
56.68s: Being all our sale later.
