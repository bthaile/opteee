0.00s: What's up to all the outliers, Eric here.
2.96s: I got a fun video for you today.
4.96s: So I was doing some market research earlier
7.56s: and I got to invite to a paid discord server
10.44s: under like a free trial period.
13.04s: So this video is gonna do a couple things.
15.04s: I'm gonna show you literally the conversation
17.24s: that I had with them.
18.48s: And most importantly, I want to highlight
21.08s: all of the red flags that I had in the conversations.
25.12s: For new traders, really for any trader,
27.96s: don't use a paid discord server.
30.48s: They are absolutely garbage.
32.96s: I've been invited to a bunch of them.
34.40s: I haven't found a good one yet.
36.04s: Not to say that there might not be a good one out there,
38.72s: but a far better use of your time
40.52s: and energy used to buy a book.
41.88s: Now, another thing, I do not hate the hustle.
45.60s: Most of these people are trying to be business minded.
48.40s: They see, you know, stock tweets doing what they're doing.
51.00s: They're like, well, I could, you know, start one of those.
53.60s: The issue I take with them is they pray
56.24s: on new traders or investors.
58.52s: I take a personal issue with that.
59.88s: Hence why I'm literally doing a public service announcement
62.72s: on it right now.
63.72s: So I am not gonna go into the specific discord group.
67.08s: I'm not gonna go into the specific people I talk to.
69.60s: I got all the names out of it,
70.92s: but I want to teach you how to look for these red flags
74.36s: because there's a bunch of them.
75.72s: So let's dive straight in.
78.32s: This is the first message that I got.
81.56s: So this is a DM from the owner.
83.80s: They said that, you know, would you like access to this chat
87.04s: to view over 10 analysts daily alerts?
89.40s: They're referring to them as analysts, which is again,
92.76s: just it tickles me because it's so crazy
96.68s: that they go that direction with it.
99.44s: So it's a paid service.
100.88s: They go through what some of their stuff they offer,
103.48s: you know, some option traders, swing traders,
105.88s: via stock, day traders, stuff like that.
108.80s: And I ask if there's, you know, are there profiles
112.16s: like with their experience levels, with audited returns?
115.60s: And they essentially said that their intros share what they do.
121.00s: And their wind rates, this is the highlight here.
124.32s: Red flag numbers three, really,
127.60s: other than a random person on discord message you
130.00s: to join their paid discord.
131.48s: The fact that they're already focusing on wind rates
133.52s: tells me a lot.
134.72s: That is a amateur investor move, amateur trader move.
138.72s: People who do this for a long time
140.20s: don't focus on wind rates.
141.44s: It's part of an important equation,
143.28s: but a high wind rate can still lose money over time.
146.56s: That's called negative expectancy.
148.12s: You can have a trade strategy that wins 90% of the time
152.24s: but loses money.
153.08s: Conversely, you can have a strategy that is accurate 35%
157.32s: of the time, but is positively expected.
160.44s: So people focus on this because it sells well.
162.76s: If you have somebody that says I can, you know, 90% win rate,
165.48s: everybody immediately thinks that they're going to make fat stacks,
168.20s: kind of like the analyst that I talked to,
171.36s: but it's not accurate.
173.16s: So let's go to the conversation with the analyst.
176.32s: This was my favorite.
177.52s: So you got a favor, you got a kind of a bit about who they are.
181.80s: They're talking about their 85 to 90% return over three months.
186.20s: This is hilarious because you'll see the way that they calculate
191.12s: their returns, which they save for the past two weeks
194.64s: was 352%.
197.16s: The way that they're calculating their returns
199.48s: is simply by adding up the percent return for each trade
204.64s: and they are calling that their total return.
208.60s: Halleurious.
209.68s: That's not how that's done.
211.08s: So again, just another red flag coming out of this person.
214.52s: So going back up to their intro, it talks about their background
220.36s: and then it says that they're going to try to provide
223.24s: an 80% win rate.
225.96s: Again, the focus on the win rate is such a red flag.
229.96s: Next red flag, I asked them how long they've been trading.
232.60s: They say five years, 10 plus.
235.04s: If you count paper trading, isn't that precious?
239.84s: They've only been trading for five years.
242.36s: And in order to sound more legitimate,
245.16s: they want you to see a bigger number.
247.72s: So they throw their paper trading numbers out there.
251.48s: Unfortunately, nobody gives a fuck about your paper trading,
256.76s: just being clear.
258.24s: So moving on, they talk about combining technical
261.80s: and fundamental analysis.
263.72s: This turns into a red flag.
266.32s: This by a statement in and of itself, yeah, you know, could be.
270.16s: But what you'll notice is later on,
272.04s: they say that their average time window for trading
275.12s: is one to four weeks.
277.36s: Fundamental analysis doesn't matter that much
280.24s: in that timeframe.
281.20s: Not to say it doesn't matter at all,
283.32s: but to even really add that as a part of your overall approach
287.40s: if you're swing trading, again,
289.36s: they're just throwing buzzwords out there
290.96s: trying to sound more legitimate.
292.52s: That's not going to be a main part of your strategy.
295.48s: All right, so let's go into their trades.
297.08s: I loved this part.
298.80s: They talked about a sample of the alerts that they give
302.76s: and they talked about their 95% win rate over the last three
306.28s: two weeks or over the last two weeks,
309.00s: which gave them a total return of 352% again,
311.72s: completely inaccurate calculation of that.
313.84s: But whatever, the other red flag,
316.68s: this isn't how option traders are going to list out their trades.
320.44s: This is just random numbers and shit.
323.24s: There's no actual detail here.
325.48s: It doesn't tell you, you know, BTO, STO, none of that's there.
329.72s: Most, most option traders are going to list out their trades
332.92s: in a similar fashion to what they see on their platform.
335.44s: That's not what this is.
336.48s: This is just a person that is seeing, you know,
338.88s: maybe placing trades, but they're not processing it like most
342.36s: of us do and reporting it the way that the large majority
345.12s: of the community does.
345.96s: So again, as a standalone measure, this could be fine,
351.20s: but in conjunction with everything else,
353.44s: I've seen so far in the conversation, another red flag.
356.56s: And then here's a huge red flag.
359.88s: It says that they sold half of the position for 9%
363.04s: and then they were stopped out at the remaining position.
366.44s: They say that they like to get stopped out at break even,
370.04s: once they're at 10% or more.
372.04s: And they walked away with a 5% return.
376.16s: Here's the deal.
377.76s: You're starting to see a couple things.
379.48s: The first one is I don't hate the fact
381.36s: that they're taking partial profits.
382.84s: That's actually kind of a good thing.
384.24s: But the problem is is they're not making any money here.
387.92s: They're adding risk out, but they're getting 5% return
392.04s: on the capital.
392.64s: That's a problem.
393.84s: So again, in a vacuum, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
398.24s: It could be OK, but in light of everything else I'm seeing,
401.24s: the red flag I get here is I bet this is a negatively
404.88s: expecting strategy.
406.28s: That's my guess.
407.56s: So we will find out more about that right now.
412.64s: So I asked them for any numbers because all they use
415.28s: is percentages in reporting the trades, which is another problem.
418.28s: You can't tell what amount of money they entered
420.76s: or exited the trade for, which is important for calculating
424.56s: expectancy.
425.56s: You got it, which this person doesn't even know what it is,
428.84s: which we'll get into in just a minute.
430.80s: So they're saying about their win rate,
434.48s: about how they like to trade naked calls or puts based on opinion.
438.72s: Sometimes they'll do spreads.
440.52s: This is entertaining.
442.44s: How have you done over your four or five,
444.56s: over your five years of trading?
446.08s: Well, I didn't always have the capital, especially at first,
449.60s: but I've outperformed the market since entering the market
452.56s: in total.
454.48s: What does that even mean?
456.12s: I'm looking for a caggar.
457.52s: What's your compound annual growth rate?
459.60s: What is your return for each of those five years
462.00s: that you've been trading?
463.32s: Why do you even consider one of those five years
465.64s: if you're saying that you didn't have money when you were starting?
468.40s: Again, three or four red flags right there.
471.68s: And here is what I was looking to confirm.
475.12s: Essentially, my thought process here is,
477.96s: how does this person deploy a strategy?
479.80s: Do they even have a strategy that is defined?
483.08s: The answer is no, and you'll see how I could tell.
485.92s: So I ask, what is your general option strategy?
488.48s: Short calls or puts, how do you manage them?
490.84s: It says, I'll do both depending on the environment.
493.08s: That's completely fine.
494.40s: For each alert, I send a stop loss is attached.
497.56s: Then once I get 10%, I typically sent a stop loss at break,
502.16s: even for half the position,
503.96s: and sell the remaining 50% in two different cells
506.88s: for 25% a quarter of the position each.
509.48s: You can't make money this way.
511.56s: This is a negative, expected strategy.
514.48s: You can't make money this way.
516.64s: And then the way that I confirm that
518.92s: is saying, where do you place your stop losses?
521.76s: So this person doesn't even know
523.28s: that I'm essentially doing their expectancy for them.
526.00s: They say it depends on the position,
527.40s: but anywhere from 30 to 50% lower.
531.08s: Now I know for a fact you can't make money here.
533.76s: This is just a matter of math.
535.92s: So as soon as some of these losses start rolling in,
538.88s: that 94% win rate, making 5% on a trade means nothing.
544.28s: So this is just a bunch of bullshit.
548.36s: And what frustrates me the most
549.76s: is that this person is trying to sell this to other people.
552.96s: All right.
554.48s: I get a little into how they select their deltas,
556.64s: which is just another non-answer.
558.72s: I go a little further into detail on their time frame,
562.00s: what their average win and losses,
563.60s: essentially explicitly asking them what their expectancy is,
567.00s: but they don't know how to answer that question.
569.32s: I ask them, what is the dollar amount for your win rate,
573.24s: your average win?
574.60s: They say a couple hundred each week.
576.36s: That's also not what I was asking.
578.40s: I do like the fact that they say that they don't risk much
580.56s: per trade, three to five percent of the portfolio,
583.00s: stereotypical fair risk management there.
585.04s: So feather in their cap, unfortunately,
587.68s: at this point, they are way too far gone
590.16s: to be any sort of authority on trading.
593.60s: And then I ask, you can't calculate expectancy
597.20s: with the percentage, which is really what I was trying to get
599.44s: at the whole time.
600.44s: And then they say, sure, you can.
602.12s: Percent return times money invested equals return
605.52s: and dollar form makes sense.
607.76s: That's not expectancy.
610.36s: Oh, sweetheart.
611.96s: I appreciate you trying, but it's just inaccurate.
615.36s: So we go back and forth a little bit more.
618.36s: And I get to the point where, OK, there's nothing
622.56s: happening here.
623.56s: So then I divulge myself, I let them know,
626.40s: not divulge myself, let me sort of big reveal.
628.40s: I just let them know that I'm not really new to this.
631.60s: And I can tell that you are.
633.80s: And this is something that you should probably look into.
636.08s: And then this is my favorite part of the conversation.
638.20s: The owner of the Discord messages me, and they say,
642.84s: I'd rather you have these negotiations in private,
645.76s: rather than shitting on our entire Discord thanks,
649.00s: not fair to the other analysts.
652.32s: They're selling bullshit.
654.04s: I don't care.
655.24s: I purposely did switch it over to the DM conversation,
659.44s: because again, part of my goal here with the platform
662.84s: is to empower traders.
664.48s: Even if they're individual traders selling shitty services,
667.72s: I definitely think that this person should not be selling
670.96s: anything, maybe lemonade.
672.84s: But it's just so disheartening to see.
676.84s: And this is one of the biggest problems we see in the community.
679.40s: Is there are people who are praying on new traders
681.72s: like this all the time.
683.20s: Don't use paid Discord.
685.52s: As always, if you have any questions or anything
687.04s: that you want to see me go over, hit me up in the contact info
690.04s: in the video description.
691.28s: Stay away from these things, please.
693.12s: And I will catch you all later.
