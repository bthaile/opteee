0.48s: what up outliers quick market update we
2.20s: got two things to look at today we got
4.64s: rocket lab USA post earnings and then we
7.08s: have GameStop um there is some really
9.60s: interesting options activity over the
12.32s: the last couple days that I think we
14.28s: should talk about so we'll start with
15.88s: this quickly and we can see overall our
18.52s: KB has been up and to the right this is
21.72s: a 3-month daily chart if I take us out
24.04s: to a year it's essentially been
25.84s: parabolic so what's going on in here
28.36s: well if we take a look at some of the
30.96s: internals before we pivot over to
32.64s: earnings and we talked a little bit
34.24s: about rkb last night but uh this will
36.84s: just touch on some of the higher level
38.92s: components it's been in favor again for
41.80s: the past year when you see stocks moving
43.64s: like this so strong for extended
46.12s: durations they tend to build a lot of
47.84s: momentum that's actually why momentum is
49.44s: a very tradable factor in the stock
51.80s: market it's one of the few things we can
53.76s: like truly quantify isolate and put
56.64s: positions on based on that effect alone
59.44s: and if we just Peak through some of the
61.68s: the key news as we see like this uh this
64.56s: here they had a solid earnings I don't
67.32s: think there was any big shock there when
69.64s: we were looking at the options last
72.92s: night leading into the earnings it was
75.56s: definitely bullishly positioned now
77.80s: what's really interesting though is the
80.80s: move today was different than I would
84.84s: have expected the main reason for that
87.56s: is I wouldn't have expected it to break
90.72s: all the way up here and then get
92.68s: rejected all the way back down that is a
95.28s: lot of selling pressure so those are
98.00s: people that are really really happy to
100.80s: say to just see this up here and they're
104.44s: getting out they're fading out now
107.08s: understanding how many of these people
108.24s: are folks that have you know built in
110.68s: profits I would imagine that would be a
113.16s: lot of them because there's just not
115.64s: that much volume that actually
117.88s: transacted Above This current level
120.12s: right it's just not that old of a
121.60s: company most of the volume was
123.56s: transacted down here at like 466 so
125.92s: these are people that got in down here
128.76s: uh and I mean they they tripled their
130.40s: money plus which is I mean they they
132.52s: actually if they top ticked it I forgot
134.32s: that it it broke above 20 so they
136.96s: literally would have five times their
138.36s: money and then some so
141.12s: the the overall movement today was
144.60s: really interesting to me I didn't expect
146.52s: to see quite this shape of a candle
150.36s: and we need to see how it goes tomorrow
152.72s: my guess is a lot of the sellers
154.88s: probably got it out of their systems
157.48s: because otherwise I mean it definitely
159.00s: could have trailed down more on the day
160.68s: I I don't see any reason why it wouldn't
163.04s: have otherwise because if you look at
165.16s: the volume today overwhelming volume 120
168.76s: million shares traded today their 5day
172.16s: average is 41 mil which includes this
174.84s: day obviously and then 18 mil before
177.96s: this the 5day average was 20 mil against
180.92s: 14 mil so just an explosion in volume
182.92s: and the majority of it was sailed 95%
185.44s: and it stayed up there which that was uh
188.68s: pretty interesting uh for me to see so
191.12s: let's take a look at the options we knew
193.52s: that there was some pretty heavy call
195.04s: skew coming into the earnings release
197.56s: and if we break this out by expiration
200.72s: you can see that it was about two to one
203.16s: calls to put so there was definitely
204.68s: people playing this to the upside not
206.80s: massive positions but big enough for
208.40s: sure to to appr pretty handsomely over
211.16s: the move and these are really short
213.20s: dated options so a lot of them are going
214.60s: to be coming off soon and on a longer
217.16s: term time frame it still maintains
218.76s: pretty heavy call skew so overall
221.12s: transactions today 308,000
223.68s: calls and we can see 22% were at the bid
227.84s: or below so sold 30% opened and 46%
231.96s: somewhere in the market probably a mix
233.60s: between these I have to imagine lots of
235.12s: people taking profits especially on
236.64s: these shorter term options because
238.40s: there's not a giant incentive to these
240.16s: 15s into expiration at this point even
242.92s: if they're far in the money it's just a
244.72s: little bit more risk but I mean who
246.52s: knows you you never really can identify
249.20s: what the rationale is for a Trader so
251.44s: interesting move here altogether now
253.64s: from a quick broader Market
256.00s: perspective um a few things stuck out to
258.28s: me Tech is still really strong so you
260.76s: can see comms up here and then Tech
263.12s: sector here they're still definitely
265.36s: leading the pack and then we still see
267.68s: this really weird breakdown I and I
270.44s: can't put my finger on it between
271.76s: Staples and discretionary discretionary
273.72s: is still hitting highs in Staples is
276.32s: still trending negatively over a
278.64s: three-month period which I just like I
280.48s: said I can't put my finger on it's weird
282.96s: and real estate struggling not a big
284.72s: shock there utilities kind of trending
286.56s: sideways I think you're going to find
287.80s: some really isolated strength within
290.04s: utilities right so we know uh Trump's
292.48s: policies really favor things like oil
294.68s: production stuff like that it's not
296.72s: going to be as favorable to things like
298.16s: solar wind definitely not wind as you
300.48s: can tell Trump is not a fan of the
302.40s: whales being hurt uh if you guys aren't
304.92s: familiar with the joke that I'm making
306.16s: there was from The Joe Rogan podcast
307.68s: where they spend a while talking about
309.08s: the impact of windmills on whales and I
311.00s: have to be honest I had no idea that
312.92s: that was a thing that was actually new
314.44s: information for me entirely and so in
317.64s: healthcare so Healthcare is not happy
319.84s: big Pharma is not looking good and we've
322.28s: seen this being carried out pretty
325.48s: consistently right so if we look at
326.88s: fizer I mean it's just barely catching a
330.24s: bid down here it's overall still sucking
333.32s: wind essentially from when the election
336.60s: was known right so you can see there's
338.24s: the fifth there's the sixth and boom
339.56s: down she goes big big big drop off I
342.56s: think big Pharma is going to have to
344.40s: figure out what this might look like
345.92s: with
346.80s: RFK and his overall involvement right if
349.72s: they start getting in front of their
350.92s: advertising spend I don't even know how
353.80s: big of an impact to be honest
355.64s: interfering with the advertising spend
357.80s: of big Pharma is going to be typically
360.36s: it's a big deal but I'm also I just
362.40s: can't think of many consumers that are
365.00s: like asking for specific drugs based on
367.16s: an ad they've seen obviously they're
368.96s: smart and they're spending the money for
370.28s: a reason but that part I can't figure
372.88s: out but I also think more importantly if
375.60s: they're giving donations and stuff like
377.20s: that to other news agencies it does
380.12s: create misalign incentives right because
382.52s: if I'm fiser sponsoring parts of your
384.76s: show you're more likely to not
387.12s: necessarily emphasize stories that merge
389.84s: my brand so that part I think is more
392.16s: likely to be detrimental the the ad
394.04s: spend itself is interesting and maybe
395.48s: it's part of that so let's take a look
398.68s: at GameStop and specifically in GameStop
401.44s: it is holding this rally like pretty
404.08s: comfortably I know some people are a
405.56s: little dejected that it's not you know
407.92s: mooning right now but this in and of
410.00s: itself in my book is a pretty strong
412.32s: Victory right like look at this candle
414.44s: today even in GameStop it's this like
418.60s: invert hammer
420.24s: but the thing that's important is take a
421.88s: look big volume big sale volume and it
425.20s: still really held its own now does this
427.80s: mean it's starting to roll over it's
429.20s: hard to tell it's a little early to tell
431.04s: in my opinion we can see from an RSI
433.12s: perspective its momentum is slowing but
435.24s: we can visualize that so what I thought
437.68s: was a little more topical from Gamestop
441.28s: is actually this so if we take a look at
445.76s: the options volume and I want to
449.20s: specific specifically look at these that
450.80s: came through so the 40s on the 12th
454.08s: which is yesterday they got tapped not
456.44s: over 3,000 times right so you can see a
458.84s: 3,000 lot that got pushed through here
460.48s: that was worth over a million dollars
462.96s: this does start to look interesting and
467.12s: there's a lot of people asking me if I
468.80s: think that this is roaring Kitty
470.04s: especially because I've just spent
472.00s: literally almost three months analyzing
474.88s: every single one of his trades and what
477.16s: I can say is this does fall close closer
480.16s: in line with what I would expect to see
481.96s: from him now whether or not that's him
483.68s: nobody knows right like there's other
485.36s: people that trade and it's always
486.80s: important to keep that in mind because I
488.04s: know a lot of people are just fingers
490.08s: crossed hoping that it's him stepping in
492.52s: and I would love to see that to be clear
494.12s: I'm in that same camp but I always make
496.84s: that comment because if that's the basis
499.80s: that you're making trading decisions off
501.44s: of that's it's just a little more
503.96s: difficult to to rationalize but in terms
507.28s: of days expiration strike selection this
509.64s: is very much in line with what we've
512.24s: seen from him historically right so we
513.96s: can see that there's 3,000 of them here
516.28s: 1,400 of them here and again these are
519.28s: the 17 Jan 25s we can see another 2,000
523.84s: here we can see another 1,000 here we
526.72s: can see another 800 going through here
529.64s: we so like there's tons of these 40s
532.48s: getting hit and again it's a little
535.24s: further out in time so this is not like
537.00s: some sort of really short-term YOLO
538.84s: esque Style trade this is deliberate
541.76s: positioning and this is deliberate
543.52s: positioning to the upside now I do find
546.80s: it a little bit interesting that there's
549.68s: no sale on these and the reason why I
552.36s: find that interesting is because if we
554.24s: take a look at the different times that
555.44s: these were transacted on the 12th and on
558.64s: the
559.56s: 11th it was kind of towards the end of
561.64s: the day so 26 so somebody had the
565.48s: opportunity to get out at about a 10%
568.08s: gain o overnight
570.04s: and they kind of looked that in the face
571.52s: and they said I don't think so I'm going
573.28s: to hold so it's clearly to me an
577.92s: indication that somebody's kind of
579.44s: trying to play a bigger move not just
581.40s: playing the the shortterm first move
584.12s: that's put in front of them so we'll
586.28s: have to see what these materialize into
588.32s: I'm curious what you all think about the
591.00s: overall options activity in here it's
593.36s: questionable to me it it looks
594.72s: interesting but this is definitely
596.08s: larger trades coming through with some
598.36s: level of conviction if we take a look
600.44s: over the last couple days specifically
603.28s: the majority of these this higher volume
605.52s: that's several hundreds of thousands of
607.20s: dollars essentially has been from the
609.44s: 12th on there's definitely some trades
611.88s: earlier than that but the bulk of it has
615.00s: been in the last couple days so I'm
616.88s: keeping a really close eye I didn't see
618.56s: a lot popping off today on the 13th to
621.80s: any significant degree but as always you
624.20s: know I'm poking through markets seeing
625.56s: if anything is jumping out looking
627.00s: interesting and so far it looks like
630.12s: there's a building phase going on right
631.96s: so we can see that down here another
634.24s: thousand of the 40s got hit on the 13th
636.92s: they got hit yesterday at a couple
638.64s: different times so this is building out
640.56s: a position of some sort we'll see what
642.12s: it looks like as always any questions
644.20s: let me know be an outlier see you later
