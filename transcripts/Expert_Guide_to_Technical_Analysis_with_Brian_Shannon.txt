2.00s: hey everybody eric here and i am super
4.56s: stoked to have brian on from alpha trend
8.08s: so first off welcome to the channel
10.40s: thanks for having me on here eric and
12.32s: just so you know whenever you see me
13.52s: looking down i got my little notepad
15.12s: here because i am
17.28s: partially an idiot and i forget things
19.12s: so i like to write stuff down um but
22.56s: the reason why i came across you first
25.44s: of all
26.40s: is there's a couple people that i
28.32s: interact with regularly on twitter and
30.80s: one of which is jake from trendspider
33.12s: and
34.00s: as soon as you start talking technical
35.84s: analysis your name inevitably comes up
38.40s: in that web
39.84s: and i also wanted to say very quickly
42.00s: thank you for sending me a copy of your
43.76s: book yeah i have literally been enjoying
46.96s: reading that a lot i have actually quite
48.80s: a few questions on that that i'll get to
50.48s: in a little bit but
51.92s: i want to start with a little bit of
53.04s: level setting with you because
55.28s: the way that my channel is set up is i
58.32s: think that the financial industry in
59.84s: general has a lot of in authenticity and
63.76s: one of the things that i've always
65.92s: really benefited from
68.08s: when i was starting trading and what not
70.56s: is i had a mentor that just spent some
72.48s: time with me and kind of just shot it to
74.16s: me straight
75.44s: and
76.56s: in that i learned a little bit about
78.88s: technical analysis but one of the things
81.52s: that i'm known for on my channel is
84.64s: generally a lack thereof
86.80s: so i thought what better person to
89.28s: connect with because one of my favorite
91.52s: things to do on the channel is to tie
93.12s: into different skill sets and obviously
96.00s: you have a very technical skill set and
98.16s: i think that
99.28s: exploring that a little bit offers a
101.52s: really really cool paradigm to the rest
104.08s: of the audience because like i said for
105.60s: me i use some and i'll get into a little
108.08s: bit of what i like to do but i'm more
109.92s: interested in what you like to do so
112.08s: i thought a great way to start would be
114.72s: if you don't mind i would love to just
116.40s: get an understanding
118.32s: of your relationship
120.40s: with the markets kind of at large so
123.12s: maybe when you started in the markets
124.96s: and what's that evolved into over time i
128.16s: started uh in the markets at an early
130.56s: age i think i was you know 12 or 13 and
133.36s: just kind of used to hang out with my
135.04s: dad on friday nights back when wall
136.88s: street week was a big thing with uh
139.04s: louis rukizer i don't know if you know
140.72s: that name eric um it was a you know a
143.68s: friday night show and i would you know
145.36s: was a kid who wanted to hang out with
146.88s: his dad so i would sit there and watch
149.20s: tv with him and he'd always have wall
151.36s: street week on on fridays that was kind
152.96s: of his thing so um i you know they and
156.00s: they talked about the market so i
157.68s: started you know asking them questions
159.60s: here and there once in a while
161.60s: and then there was a company in the
164.08s: boston area where i grew up at the time
166.56s: uh called lojack and they had just
168.64s: gotten a contract with the state police
171.04s: and
171.92s: uh it just i saw it on tv and
175.44s: basically got lucky i said to my dad hey
177.60s: you know can we buy some of this stock
179.52s: and it was you know five dollars a share
181.68s: he said sure i'll put up you know i had
183.92s: money from caddying newspaper roots and
186.00s: all that stuff you do as a kid to make
187.76s: money
188.64s: um and he said well we'll buy a thousand
190.96s: shares and you know he gave me leverage
193.44s: basically right a couple months later
196.24s: the stock went to ten dollars per share
198.80s: and i had a thousand shares of it and i
200.48s: was 14 14 years old so you know i
203.60s: thought hey why does anyone work you
205.92s: know this is this is the way to go i'm
208.40s: gonna i that's what i want to do is be a
211.36s: and and i am a traitor today but it
213.68s: wasn't it wasn't just as easy as it
215.84s: seemed from that trade there's been a
217.84s: lot of up and up and downs you know in
220.16s: between that got me where i am today
222.24s: that was just my first
224.12s: introductory you know kind of
227.28s: got the needle in the arm for a back
229.12s: lack of better uh yeah analogy um but
232.40s: but i mean it's true i was hooked and i
234.64s: really um you know so i you know later
237.44s: on when i was a you know
239.36s: 16 17 i kept my interest in the market
242.64s: and would go to the library and read you
245.52s: know newsletters and that sort of thing
247.12s: one was the cabot market letter um there
249.60s: was value line there and i would you
251.60s: know look at these things and dream of
253.76s: all the money i was gonna make and i
255.76s: between reading mafia books was i like
258.56s: to read those in stock market books when
260.80s: i was a kid
262.00s: um unfortunately i'm a trader not a
264.08s: mafia guy
265.68s: good career choice right those guys are
268.56s: in jail or dead so
270.16s: yeah
271.20s: so um so that really was you know
274.40s: it called to me and um so i went on to
277.20s: become a retail stock broker in boston
280.32s: and you know as i like to tell people it
282.32s: was basically a glorified telemarketing
284.64s: position i really i didn't know what a
286.96s: broker did i went to college i didn't
288.64s: take college as seriously as i should
290.56s: have i was a solid c student basically
293.68s: and not really get degrees just they had
296.24s: a degree and you know
299.20s: i i have mixed feelings about whether i
301.44s: had a better
303.36s: time in school or life afterwards and i
306.56s: think i made the right call just you
308.32s: know finding the balance yeah although
310.96s: you know i think a better balance would
312.48s: have been bees in in a little less of
314.72s: the weekend activities but
316.80s: um that drifted into the weekdays but
320.32s: on to more serious topics uh you know so
322.96s: the the retail stock broker was
325.12s: basically a you know a telemarketing
327.76s: position
328.96s: it wasn't what i wanted to do
331.36s: it was really good that i i learned a
333.60s: lot of skills you know sales skills
336.72s: dealing with people um you know being a
339.76s: retail broker so i i i in and i care
343.52s: around when i say it but it's it's
345.12s: actually partially true that i got to
347.12s: practice with other people's money
349.28s: and make mistakes with their money
351.60s: before i went and became a you know a
354.40s: full-time trader myself which was
358.84s: 1993 i left so 91 i graduated college
362.40s: and went you know to work at lehman
363.92s: brothers moved out to denver worked for
366.00s: a company called dane bosworth and i
367.68s: think was 93 i went and became a
369.76s: full-time trader i opened my own office
372.00s: actually day trading office in denver
374.24s: with a partner
375.76s: and kind of you know had that office for
378.00s: a little while i ran a hedge fund for a
379.92s: little bit which
381.28s: never really amounted to a lot i just
384.08s: was not it didn't have the asset base
386.64s: and i was a little
388.08s: impatient so
389.76s: um you know i started with another
392.08s: company called marketwise where i
393.84s: created uh stock market you know stock
395.76s: trading uh courses you know technical
398.24s: analysis and you know just about level
400.64s: two and you know trading in general
404.24s: and then uh you know left them about 14
407.36s: years ago i started uh in it you know
410.16s: i've been trading full-time and just
412.64s: trading and then howard lindsen over who
415.12s: started uh stock twice approached me
416.96s: once and said hey do you want to start a
418.72s: newsletter um you've got a good youtube
421.28s: following and that sort of thing you
422.88s: know and you've got good information do
424.24s: you want to start a newsletter i said
425.52s: yeah but i don't feel like dealing with
426.88s: all the you know uh customer service yep
430.56s: stuff so
431.84s: uh he said don't worry about it we'll
433.36s: we'll handle that for you so alpha
435.20s: trends was born out of that as you know
437.84s: subscription product and i and i still
440.08s: do it to this day i don't i don't market
442.24s: it heavily or anything like that i kind
444.00s: of let people organically find me and
447.20s: you know if it fits if it's if it's not
449.20s: then i'm not going to beat anyone over
450.64s: the head for it i'm not i'm not into
452.48s: sales you know my passion is the market
454.80s: and if you if you follow me on twitter
456.80s: you see that's you know basically
459.04s: my it it continues to be my passion now
462.08s: it hasn't always been you know the
465.20s: so it's a love-hate relationship and the
468.48s: the law the more experience you get in
470.32s: the market the more it's a love
471.76s: experience because you realize that you
474.00s: can deal with the market on your own
475.44s: terms you don't have to chase things
477.76s: it's okay to miss trades uh you just
480.48s: become more patient more tolerant of
483.60s: market moves
485.04s: um you know my wife likes to say it's
487.44s: you know
489.04s: life's too short to to drink bad wine
491.52s: and life's too short to take marginal
493.44s: trades as well you know there's just
496.24s: no longer do i sit there and just like
498.72s: jones for trades and look to take a
501.20s: trade because i feel like hey i'm a
503.20s: trader i have to trade something where's
505.04s: the action
506.56s: instead it's it's just more methodical
508.72s: uh you know process based uh focused
511.68s: rather and you know
513.84s: managing risk is the most important
515.60s: thing
518.64s: i don't know how you read my mind i
520.40s: literally was just writing down some
522.16s: notes from your book and the very first
524.32s: bullet point i literally just wrote this
525.68s: was risk management because
527.76s: i love that you talk about that in your
529.84s: book and it's something that my mentor
532.40s: spent a lot of time explaining to me
535.28s: because you have people like warren
536.56s: buffett that has his rules and his you
539.44s: know first rule is make money second
541.28s: rule don't forget rule number one and
543.44s: you know he always respectfully
545.12s: disagreed with that for the purpose of
547.68s: traders obviously warm up more of an
549.52s: investor mindset
551.68s: and he always instilled in me that the
554.16s: number one job of any
556.96s: active market participant
559.52s: is risk management that's your you know
561.04s: very first thing and i actually love
563.20s: that you talked about that very early in
565.60s: the book because one of the things that
567.44s: i think about technical analysis is
570.24s: a lot of folks either are non-committal
572.48s: in their forecasts or they always have a
575.20s: reason why you know the forecast didn't
577.04s: work or something like that and it just
579.84s: it to me it feels like it misses an
582.08s: element of reality
584.40s: and the fact that your book started with
586.64s: that really set me on the right tone in
589.44s: my mind for reading the rest of the book
591.60s: because i think
592.88s: um
593.76s: the fact that you talk about that early
595.68s: is super important to me as a trader and
597.84s: obviously
599.04s: i i think that that's a great
601.28s: highlight
602.64s: for a lot of folks that are interested
604.24s: in the market whether it's via ta you
606.08s: know investing or whatever right um i
608.56s: had a couple questions about your kind
611.20s: of career progression um i always this
614.00s: is kind of a
615.36s: selfish part of these conversations
617.84s: because i literally i'm just very
619.20s: curious about people it's your it's your
621.12s: conversation you get to call the shots
623.44s: right well i always i try to make sure
625.12s: that i integrate you know because i get
626.88s: questions that some you know the folks
628.88s: send in that they want to want me to go
630.72s: over with you and whatnot but i always
632.08s: make sure to add a little selfish time
633.60s: in there because some of this stuff is
634.64s: really cool to me
636.00s: um because so for me i started trading
638.32s: when i was in high school
639.84s: and i
641.52s: started with you know buying and selling
643.44s: stock but essentially i've been retail
645.92s: trader side the whole time right when i
648.00s: talk to people like you that have had
650.08s: some mixed experience i find that
651.76s: fascinating to explore some of that
654.40s: so
655.44s: one of the the first questions i wanted
657.12s: to ask you is when you went from your
660.24s: time from working as a retail stock
662.96s: broker and then you opened that day
666.08s: trading office
667.68s: what what was that transition like for
670.16s: you like when you were retail stock
671.92s: broker obviously very focused on sales
674.32s: and getting people you know to to place
676.24s: trades and whatnot and then i'm assuming
678.16s: when you went to that day trading office
680.00s: probably a different focus i'm curious
681.68s: just a little bit about what that looked
682.88s: like for you
684.08s: right so it wasn't straight to my own uh
687.36s: office right
689.28s: but i didn't clarify that earlier what
691.36s: happened was i had uh
693.28s: you know used to read the the get the
695.04s: news the print ibd and in the back page
698.16s: there was always an advertisement there
700.00s: that said uh you know day trade buy
702.56s: power you know get 20 to one leverage
704.80s: right they put 25 000 down and you'll
707.84s: get 20 to 1 leverage so
709.92s: that appealed to me i was thinking you
711.52s: know i don't have enough money to trade
713.28s: full-time you've got to think this was
714.96s: 1993
716.64s: and i was 20 uh i guess 20 uh 21 22
722.08s: years old um is that right uh
725.52s: 2026 whatever it was um but the point is
728.88s: that you know i had a young family i had
730.64s: a mortgage my wife wasn't working and i
733.68s: had about oh so you already had a family
736.48s: at that time i i did yeah yeah so the
739.04s: pressure so the pressure's on the
740.96s: pressure was on for i
742.80s: maybe there was something in my brain
744.72s: that wasn't connected
746.80s: to recognize the magnitude of the risk
749.76s: that's correct because because what i'm
751.44s: going to tell you next i wouldn't
752.72s: suggest anyone do
754.40s: i i had this job as a broker and i had
756.88s: saved up maybe about
758.72s: nineteen thousand dollars and i was
761.36s: just couldn't wait to get out of there
763.04s: once i had my 25 thousand dollars right
765.92s: and this was about this time of year
768.40s: around christmas and and i guess it was
770.88s: 1993 um and and i was trading this stock
774.40s: called chantel pharmaceuticals okay and
777.28s: chantel pharmaceuticals wasn't a
779.12s: pharmaceutical company at all it was a
781.52s: it was a skin cream that had this
784.64s: miraculous anti-wrinkle property nice
787.92s: and they had all these doctors you know
789.92s: that came on the payroll and you know
792.32s: made it seem like a legitimate story so
794.56s: you know where this company's going by
796.16s: those words
797.44s: um so i had run my account from you know
800.80s: nineteen thousand dollars to twenty
802.64s: eight thousand dollars in in the in a
804.80s: two week period as like that's it i'm
807.20s: i'm ready to quit i'm i'm done and you
809.76s: know i'm gonna i'm gonna go so
811.84s: uh i
813.36s: i then took a day off work to go skiing
816.72s: i called the office to see where chantal
819.68s: was this was a monday i took the monday
822.00s: off
822.88s: and the person who answered the phone
825.28s: you know i had a thousand shares of this
826.80s: thing it was let's say
828.48s: twenty three dollars a share
830.48s: and she says it's uh eighteen dollars
832.64s: and fifty cents i was like no no no you
834.32s: get the symbol wrong it should be it's
835.92s: probably like 28 by now right it does
838.56s: nothing but go up anyways barons did a
841.44s: hit piece over
843.04s: on it over the weekend and basically
845.52s: said you know the company's a fraud this
847.36s: thing doesn't do anything for
849.92s: uh wrinkles so i just said listen sell
852.32s: my stock right here right now which was
853.92s: the right thing to do
855.52s: because it ended up it was a fraud and i
857.84s: was lucky to get out 15 a share when it
860.64s: you know i mean within six months it was
862.16s: a two dollar stock what was your basis
864.80s: you know i had been trading it so i
867.76s: i considered my basis basically where it
870.72s: closed on friday which might have been
873.28s: twenty three dollars
875.20s: so i'd lost eight thousand dollars so it
877.44s: brought me back under that twenty five
879.12s: thousand dollar level
881.04s: and you know i was crushed um so
884.56s: i i had already put in my notice that i
887.52s: was quitting
888.88s: and i didn't know what to do so i took a
891.36s: cash advance on my credit card
894.96s: to make up the difference
896.80s: i wired it into new york
899.04s: and
900.32s: started trading and and you know i was
902.56s: scared to death really of losing any
904.88s: money
905.84s: and they say scared money never wins and
908.56s: scared money doesn't win big but i i was
911.12s: able to you know plug away and i wasn't
913.12s: making real money at all i mean i was
914.80s: like making you know eighteen hundred
916.64s: dollars this month
918.32s: twenty six hundred dollars but i was
920.08s: making money
921.44s: uh i had a really i mean
923.60s: my first house cost i think it was 79
926.40s: 000 so my mortgage was like less than a
928.32s: thousand dollars
929.68s: so it was you know
932.00s: it worked thank you
933.84s: right um but i realized i'm never gonna
936.56s: get ahead
937.76s: with this even with this leverage
939.52s: because right one big mistake i'm i'm
941.92s: just done am i yeah going out of the
943.60s: water i've got you know i've got no
945.36s: backup plan right and you got the family
947.12s: now that that that part to me is just
949.84s: i really tip my hat off to you because
952.24s: that is
953.36s: it's i know i get you know like looking
955.20s: back it's kind of like was that right
956.80s: but
957.84s: it's just to make that bold of a move i
960.96s: think deserves some sort of recognition
962.88s: because i feel like at some point you
964.80s: have to trust yourself and you got there
967.52s: a lot earlier than i did like that's
969.36s: that's nuts to me that's awesome it is
971.44s: nuts and that that you know it worked
973.76s: fortunately i can laugh about it and i
976.08s: wouldn't suggest anyone does it and
978.24s: again i had a very strong that's why
980.64s: risk management eric is so
983.12s: important to me i've been on the i've
985.44s: been on the brink of disaster and and
987.76s: i've i've had you know bad drawdowns in
990.72s: between obviously in my 30-year uh
993.76s: career but
995.20s: never bad enough to put me out of
996.80s: business and and and i i i feel like a
999.92s: lot of people out there are putting
1001.44s: themselves in positions where they just
1003.20s: trust the market game to do nothing but
1005.44s: go up and everything comes back and they
1007.84s: would never cut a loser what what you
1009.92s: know what how how would that work they
1012.96s: it's just not a part of some people's
1015.12s: process
1016.32s: anyway so you know the the company that
1018.32s: i worked for they were called generic
1019.76s: trading and i was trading remotely on a
1022.56s: it was on a 24k modem uh and then i i
1026.16s: remember the upgrade to the 48k modem
1028.24s: was just amazing
1029.68s: um
1030.96s: and then uh so i i i went to new york
1033.84s: and talked to the the the owners of uh
1036.88s: ron shearer and meyer offman and said
1038.72s: listen you know there's nothing like
1040.16s: this in denver would you want to back
1042.80s: an office in denver and they did so
1045.44s: i you know got my branch manager's
1047.52s: license open in office
1049.68s: ran it for a couple years merged it with
1051.76s: another company
1053.20s: and you know
1054.96s: worked with them that was marketwise was
1056.88s: the name of the company
1058.32s: for a period of i think about eight or
1060.48s: nine years and um
1063.44s: that kind of just you know ran its
1065.84s: course and uh
1068.00s: fast forward to you know
1070.00s: just sitting down trading for myself
1073.44s: writing notes and doing you know youtube
1076.08s: videos for free with no
1078.88s: intent of of doing anything with it and
1081.36s: then like i said howard approached me
1082.96s: and said hey you want to start a
1084.48s: newsletter so i that that that was that
1087.44s: right right
1088.80s: man that is just so crazy to me the
1090.88s: other thing that i find fascinating
1092.32s: about these conversations is you know i
1095.04s: i have been trading for a little while
1096.72s: right i've been trading for over 14
1098.48s: years now yeah but to talk to people
1100.80s: like you that have like no kidding like
1103.60s: you talking about the modems is what
1105.36s: just inserted this in my brain you know
1107.20s: it's like people like you have like just
1109.28s: this very fascinating perspective about
1112.00s: the evolution of the markets
1114.48s: which is another question that i'm going
1117.36s: to ask in a little bit but i have
1120.84s: another um
1122.56s: another background question to ask you
1125.12s: and what i'm curious about is so you did
1128.08s: this day trading bit for a while and
1129.76s: you're kind of explaining how you ended
1131.36s: up moving over to the the hedge fund
1134.16s: and managing a fund for a little while
1136.56s: and you were mentioning that that wasn't
1138.32s: necessarily your your
1140.64s: um
1141.52s: end-all be-all but i am curious
1145.20s: while you were managing the hedge funds
1147.92s: i'm assuming you had a very different
1150.40s: strategy that you were generally
1152.00s: deploying compared to when you're
1153.68s: trading like now as an individual retail
1155.84s: trader is that true or no
1157.92s: not really i mean so it was you know i
1160.72s: started out kind of just day trading
1162.56s: this was actually you've got to remember
1164.08s: this was during the sows period as well
1166.56s: so's was still the way you executed
1168.72s: orders right um and then they started
1170.88s: coming out with the ecn's the first you
1172.96s: know real
1174.00s: big one was was island and then ready
1176.72s: and archipelago and those gave the
1179.36s: retail trader the ability to get in
1181.36s: between the spreads that back then were
1184.00s: you know quarters and eighths they you
1186.00s: know they were debt they were fractions
1187.44s: not decimals
1188.80s: um so those gave us a perceived
1192.56s: advantage and if you look at it now
1194.48s: you'd be like
1195.68s: why is there a 25 spread in this stock
1198.08s: this is insane right um you know we're
1200.72s: used to pennies now so
1203.04s: that kind of
1204.48s: you know progressed towards you know in
1208.00s: evolution of my style okay um the the
1211.36s: souls the speed of sows
1214.40s: wasn't so important anymore one of the
1216.96s: most influential books early on
1219.60s: was hit and run trading by jeff cooper
1222.64s: and there were some strategies in there
1224.48s: that i learned
1225.68s: that really helped me
1227.44s: kind of see the market for more for for
1230.00s: swing trades and and i started expanding
1232.96s: my time frame
1234.40s: into you know instead of just being a
1236.80s: day trader uh days and sometimes weeks
1240.72s: and you know learning to put my thoughts
1243.36s: of what the company does you know i was
1245.20s: trained as a broker that you know
1247.36s: fortunately for me the when i worked at
1249.76s: lehman brothers i had a senior broker i
1251.76s: worked under and he was in the technical
1253.84s: analysis so i picked up a lot from him
1256.08s: and the way that he would pitch stocks
1258.00s: was he would find earning surprises
1260.56s: but it had to have a good chart if it
1262.32s: didn't have a good chart forget about it
1264.48s: and then we would then i would kind of
1266.08s: have to you know help develop a story to
1269.28s: sell to a customer because a customer
1271.84s: isn't going to buy a stock because it's
1273.12s: breaking out on huge volume right and
1275.84s: you know the things that we take for
1277.52s: granted now instead it would have to be
1279.92s: hey you know they make this product
1281.60s: their sales are this the earnings are
1283.28s: that estimates are going up um you know
1286.56s: value line says this our analyst says
1289.28s: that and creating you know the pitch and
1292.32s: creating the story around it quick
1294.40s: question on that sorry were most of the
1296.56s: people that you were pitching to were
1298.32s: they more investors were they were like
1300.00s: holding for longer than a year or were
1302.64s: you guys managing folks that were
1304.00s: actively buying and selling
1305.84s: um you know more frequently than that
1307.92s: well you you tend to find the people
1310.56s: that you
1312.08s: that are
1313.12s: you know geared towards your personality
1314.72s: so if i pick
1316.00s: if i if i uh pitch somebody on the phone
1319.28s: who is a buy and hold investor and i'm
1322.24s: talking to them about
1324.00s: you know this
1325.60s: we think this is our three to six month
1327.60s: target is the way we generally you know
1329.60s: mention them our three to six month
1331.28s: target is this they'd say well that that
1332.96s: doesn't interest me
1334.40s: then you know then you'd figure out you
1336.24s: know and one of the nice things one
1338.08s: other it's not nice i guess one of the
1339.84s: things that i learned at lehman was that
1341.84s: a successful
1343.36s: phone call is either you get a yes or
1345.36s: they hang up on you
1346.96s: um and i didn't really want them to hang
1348.96s: up on me but it was yeah i'd get pretty
1350.80s: firm nose you'd have to just keep going
1352.56s: back at them back at them back at them
1354.96s: until they really became clear no this
1357.28s: is not what i do right okay fine thanks
1360.40s: um so you would you know your your
1362.32s: customers would kind of be
1364.16s: representative of this the style that
1367.04s: you presented them okay um and
1370.72s: you know
1372.00s: a better salesman would probably
1374.80s: try to be all things to all people and
1376.72s: pretend hey yeah we'll hold it longer
1379.28s: term um but i was more interested in the
1381.44s: market than i was in being in sales so i
1384.48s: gave it to him straight here's what
1385.84s: we're looking for um and that was
1389.36s: you know if i had to do it the other way
1392.16s: uh in fact you know one of the one of
1394.08s: the firms that uh sponsored me as as a
1397.52s: broker um
1399.60s: they wanted me sell insurance products
1402.08s: and i said listen i have no interest in
1404.40s: selling you sure i'm not going to sell
1406.96s: uh annuities and i said no you have to
1409.36s: sell annuities you you i've scheduled
1411.60s: you to take your test you know in a
1413.68s: month so i'm not going to study for the
1415.44s: test we'll see how it goes
1417.20s: and i failed the test because i was
1418.80s: stubborn and i'm 22 years old and i
1420.80s: already know everything so why would i
1422.32s: want to do this
1423.60s: um
1424.56s: but the point is i you know i i was a
1426.64s: stock guy and i'm not gonna
1428.88s: i couldn't authentically sell an annuity
1431.12s: to someone that's awesome so he signed
1433.04s: me up to take the test again i studied
1435.12s: for an hour and failed it third time he
1437.44s: said listen you really don't want to do
1438.80s: this do you say hey you finally got the
1440.32s: hint quit bugging me no we're selling
1442.48s: stocks i'm a stock broker not a
1444.40s: insurance agent yeah
1447.36s: so that was just a little aside there so
1449.44s: that's awesome though i'm glad because
1450.72s: there's so many people especially when
1452.32s: you realize what you can make on
1454.24s: insurance products via commissions
1456.72s: a lot of people are like yes you know
1458.80s: sign me up i but it's like you're saying
1461.44s: they kind of sell their souls in pursuit
1463.52s: of a few dollars and
1465.52s: i actually really respect the fact that
1467.44s: you know they dangled money essentially
1468.96s: in front of your face and you're like no
1470.08s: that's not what i like to do i'm going
1471.36s: to keep doing that so i like i love that
1473.20s: i think that's
1474.40s: cool thanks
1476.48s: um
1477.44s: so then you were talking a little bit
1479.36s: about
1480.64s: the
1481.68s: the broker that you worked under and he
1484.16s: was starting to introduce or i don't
1486.96s: maybe you're already familiar with
1488.16s: technical analysis at that point but
1489.60s: that's really what i want to understand
1491.28s: next is when did you find technical
1493.84s: analysis and when did that become the
1496.56s: thing that appealed to you
1499.36s: the summer of 1991 when i graduated
1502.80s: colleges i said i used to look at these
1504.88s: um newsletters and there was one
1507.12s: newsletter it was the cabot market
1508.88s: letter
1509.92s: and in that they said they were talking
1512.24s: about this company that you know it was
1514.56s: called advanced polymers
1516.72s: and it was you know things that go into
1519.36s: tube products that make it last longer
1521.52s: the flavor lasts longer in gum or in
1524.16s: toothpaste it will hold things better it
1526.96s: was a polymer that you know binded them
1528.88s: together was the story behind it it had
1530.96s: a great story
1532.32s: and
1533.52s: the i remembered reading you know we
1535.84s: like this stock if it gets above eight
1538.16s: dollars per share or whatever the price
1539.92s: was
1540.88s: i was like why would you want to buy it
1542.16s: higher that doesn't make any sense
1544.40s: you know why not buy it at this low
1546.48s: point and
1547.92s: then i looked at a chart and it was just
1550.32s: clear as day i mean the chart just spoke
1552.64s: to me that it just kept coming up to
1554.16s: that eight dollar level and couldn't get
1555.68s: past it
1556.72s: so yeah it can't get past eight well if
1558.96s: it gets above eight well there's clear
1560.48s: sky
1561.60s: and then i started
1563.76s: to say okay i need to learn about this
1565.44s: technical analysis stuff
1567.28s: so that summer i picked up uh the first
1569.36s: book i picked up was uh by john murphy
1573.28s: technical analysis of the fight futures
1575.60s: market which you know it applies to the
1578.08s: stocks then i read the better book which
1580.48s: really has had the huge impact which was
1582.72s: stan weinstein secrets for profiting
1584.96s: bull bear markets
1586.48s: and that one you know i devoured that
1588.72s: book and that one just spoke to me big
1590.48s: time so i had a little bit of knowledge
1593.92s: going into that
1595.68s: uh role under the senior broker i was
1597.76s: basically
1599.20s: i was getting paid five bucks an hour
1601.52s: for qualifying leads and then if i open
1604.72s: the account at least a ten thousand
1606.72s: dollar account i would get a hundred
1608.08s: bucks okay and so i was making peanuts
1611.52s: but i was getting great experience
1612.80s: because i was working for a guy who was
1614.64s: you know he was a million dollar
1615.84s: producer he right a million dollars of
1617.84s: commissions a year so he was top-notch
1619.84s: and i learned a lot there
1621.84s: i didn't stick around long
1624.24s: because i wanted to go be a broker
1625.60s: somewhere else and rush the prize in a
1627.20s: hurry um
1629.20s: which worked out which worked out great
1631.44s: um so
1633.12s: he was you know he would get the
1635.92s: uh daily graphs which is marcus smith
1638.08s: now daily graphs had printed products
1641.20s: called uh what they were called daily
1643.04s: graphs and they were printed books one
1645.84s: was the blue book which was the new york
1648.00s: stock exchange and the green was the
1650.48s: nasdaq and amex
1652.72s: and it was you know it would come every
1654.88s: weekend
1655.84s: uh 200 pages four charts per page it had
1658.96s: you know all the information of sales
1660.72s: and earnings and i would just spend you
1663.28s: know all day sunday as soon as i got
1665.44s: those i would just spend hours going
1667.28s: through them and then you know they were
1669.44s: four per page i would cut them out cut
1671.36s: out the ones i liked that were
1672.72s: interesting i'd go down to kinko's and
1675.04s: put it on 400 percent and make it a you
1678.24s: know full-size page so i could study and
1680.40s: mark notes on it and get ready for the
1682.56s: week ahead
1683.76s: um so that it really just i mean it just
1686.88s: spoke to me and it it
1688.64s: it made so much sense because
1690.96s: i knew when i was a broker i was selling
1693.84s: the chart
1695.20s: but i had to
1696.64s: you know
1697.60s: in it that's what i was selling but i
1699.52s: had to package it with a story right
1702.32s: yeah i had to put some sizzle in it
1704.00s: because people
1705.36s: would be like wait wait i broke past
1706.96s: this resistance on heavy volume you you
1709.44s: lose them as soon as you say that
1711.44s: it's different today because technical
1713.68s: analysis is much wider known and
1716.08s: accepted and seen everywhere these days
1719.52s: yeah yeah definitely and
1721.84s: but i think that that also i don't know
1724.08s: if it was purposeful for you or maybe
1726.16s: subconsciously but even as you're
1728.00s: talking about a lot of this technical
1729.84s: analysis
1730.96s: that you were doing maybe you know you
1732.80s: were doing some of this fundamental
1734.16s: research to support it but
1736.48s: i mean you're telling me about these
1738.16s: different companies and like you know
1739.68s: what they produced you know what it was
1741.28s: supposed to you know what value is
1742.88s: supposed to provide so it even seems
1744.32s: like
1745.12s: you know you might focus more heavily on
1747.20s: technical analysis but it does seem like
1749.20s: there's still you know a bit of
1751.20s: qualitative understanding that you used
1753.36s: you know and to like bundle this whole
1755.12s: thing up which i think is
1757.36s: really interesting do you think that
1758.80s: that's something that you still do today
1760.88s: like when you're trading whatever you
1762.56s: like to trade
1763.84s: do you still have that level of
1766.24s: fundamental understanding as well and
1768.16s: you're kind of driving with technical
1769.68s: analysis or would you say that you're
1771.12s: kind of like more of a pure technical
1773.36s: analyst
1774.40s: yeah you know i don't look at you know i
1777.04s: i sometimes i'll look at a company's
1778.96s: website if i just want to see what their
1781.04s: product you know physically actually is
1783.84s: right but most of the time i'm familiar
1786.16s: with what the company does i mean i'll
1788.24s: look into i'll read the paragraph
1790.72s: description right i'll look at their uh
1794.16s: you know and that's the nice thing about
1795.44s: market smith charts is that they have
1798.08s: what i think are the most important
1799.52s: things the two most important things are
1802.00s: whatever the company is are they
1803.92s: increasing revenues whatever they sell
1805.92s: are they selling more of that stuff than
1808.40s: they did in the same
1810.32s: quarter a year ago
1812.00s: and is that increasing sequentially as
1814.00s: well first quarter you know second third
1816.48s: fourth quarter and not only are they you
1819.28s: know increased revenues but is it
1821.12s: showing up in the bottom line are they
1822.56s: making more money right now they're
1824.40s: selling more stuff are they making more
1826.80s: money selling that stuff
1828.96s: that's basically what i need to know
1830.96s: about the company
1832.40s: um and then if the chart supports it it
1835.28s: gives me that little extra confidence
1837.84s: that
1838.80s: i can go into this stock a little bit
1840.56s: heavier because they have a real product
1842.08s: they have a real company it's not some
1844.48s: fly-by-night little biotech stock that
1847.36s: is in phase 2 you know and it's got this
1850.08s: wild card that you know it can go up
1852.80s: 80 percent of the day but if you look at
1855.12s: the you know every single day if you
1857.20s: look at the nasdaq losers you know in
1859.60s: the top 10 there's two or three little
1861.52s: biotech stocks that are down 30 40
1863.84s: percent
1864.88s: so it just gives me a little bit of
1867.28s: confidence to say hey it's a real
1869.36s: company
1870.88s: and i understand the psychology of what
1873.44s: drives fundamental investors i'm not
1875.92s: necessarily buying the story myself
1878.40s: but i understand that the market values
1881.12s: these things and they do have a real
1883.28s: product so it makes sense that i can get
1885.92s: involved a little bit heavier
1888.00s: uh you know in terms of my risk unit
1890.64s: and uh give me the confidence to hold
1893.28s: overnight and then i want to know are
1895.28s: earnings due
1896.48s: over you know tonight i don't if so i
1898.32s: don't want to hold it if they do in a
1900.16s: week maybe i buy it for the run-up in
1902.32s: front of earnings and
1904.08s: just basic fundamentals eric
1906.40s: that honestly like i feel like that's
1910.16s: that came across in your book
1912.08s: and that was something that i i really
1914.72s: liked because
1916.56s: a big frustration that i have is a lot
1920.40s: of i think retail traders in general
1922.72s: face an uphill battle no matter what
1924.80s: yeah i mean even down to you know what
1927.52s: we can transact at we can get to you
1930.56s: know two decimals whereas market makers
1932.48s: go to four to six you know depending on
1933.76s: where they're at
1934.96s: because there's just a lot of structural
1937.84s: you know
1939.36s: barriers that we already have to deal
1941.20s: with
1942.00s: and something a very frustrating
1944.40s: narrative i see is when people are like
1946.16s: oh you know this is better than that
1948.88s: speaking fundamental better than
1950.24s: technical technical better than
1951.52s: fundamental right and i've always been a
1954.48s: huge advocate of
1956.56s: why pick
1958.00s: that it's not a binary decision you can
1960.40s: exactly like you're saying you can use
1962.24s: both do you need to you know weight them
1964.40s: exactly the same no you know you do what
1966.32s: you're comfortable with but i love that
1968.64s: you integrate some you know other parts
1971.52s: no matter what that is and i think that
1973.52s: there's just a powerful message for
1974.88s: people because a lot of folks you know
1976.88s: might be chartists but even like you
1979.44s: said understanding what the company
1980.72s: sells just helps provide a little bit of
1982.40s: context
1983.76s: and that leads to a follow-on question
1985.84s: and this is just a
1987.12s: general curiosity
1988.72s: if you came across a chart that you
1991.52s: really liked
1992.88s: but the company's description they sold
1995.68s: something that you just don't believe in
1997.44s: or that you know you didn't really think
1999.60s: much of how do you treat those instances
2004.08s: in the market to make money not uh
2006.48s: save my soul um
2009.28s: or you know win points with any
2011.44s: investing committee or
2013.52s: uh be judged uh you know
2016.08s: you know the market's a selfish endeavor
2018.40s: uh i can i can go beyond that pretty
2020.88s: quickly um you know unless it's
2023.04s: something egregious that just just
2025.12s: doesn't make sense to me and i i
2026.64s: honestly can't think of an example um i
2029.36s: you know
2030.48s: your so-called sin stocks you know sell
2033.12s: guns they sell weed they sell booze uh
2036.40s: it doesn't doesn't bother me you know
2038.24s: there's there's products for these
2039.84s: they're part of society
2041.84s: the stock is going
2044.00s: i see it you know right why wouldn't i
2046.96s: get involved right i love that that's i
2049.92s: i truly identify with the same thing i
2051.76s: went through an interesting phase i was
2053.84s: trading um
2055.52s: like
2056.32s: a couple company like philip 66 and i
2058.80s: was trading you know just some stuff
2060.24s: that falls
2061.84s: close to those categories and i was
2063.84s: like thinking through how i felt about
2065.28s: it but i pretty much arrived at the same
2066.96s: conclusion a while ago whereas there's a
2068.72s: market for it people make their own
2070.08s: choices this looks good at the time i'm
2072.64s: gonna gonna trade it all right yeah um
2076.08s: cool so
2077.20s: that's
2078.40s: really helpful to understand a bit of
2080.64s: just your general context
2082.80s: um like i said i think that you bring a
2085.36s: really fun perspective
2088.32s: to
2089.12s: really to the discussion because it's
2091.04s: it's fascinating for me to understand
2093.04s: more about your um your approach so i
2096.48s: want to pivot real quick to just
2098.88s: a little bit more about your general
2101.04s: technical analysis approach
2104.40s: so there's a couple things that i picked
2106.16s: up in the book
2107.36s: that
2108.16s: really just seemed to cross through to
2110.64s: me one of which was the the concept of
2112.48s: multiple time frames
2114.40s: um so if there was like a 30 000
2118.80s: foot view summary if you were to
2121.44s: characterize your general approach to
2123.44s: technical analysis what does that look
2125.04s: like
2126.08s: yeah so i mean you hit it it's trend
2128.40s: alignment and what that basically means
2130.56s: is you know in any given day in the
2133.04s: market you know we we could be in a
2135.36s: bullish environment or a bearish
2137.28s: environment we i mean we we've had off
2140.24s: of the coveted low in 2020 we've had
2142.88s: this phenomenal bull market but along
2144.80s: the way there's been a couple scary
2146.48s: declines right and you know periods of
2149.68s: let's say three to six weeks where we've
2152.56s: clearly been in bearish environments and
2154.32s: if you're buying stocks you know it's
2157.28s: you're you're losing money or if you're
2158.88s: buying some of these stocks that are
2160.80s: yesterday's winners peloton you know
2163.36s: zoom uh paypal you know
2166.24s: the list goes on and on a lot of these
2168.08s: big tech names have been destroyed here
2170.56s: in the just the last few months right so
2173.44s: when i look at those i i look at the big
2176.24s: picture and say hey it's in a primary
2178.80s: uptrend
2179.84s: so to me that becomes a candidate for us
2183.44s: for a purchase
2185.36s: i don't want to buy it after a stock has
2187.68s: already made a move a fomo move you know
2189.92s: fear of missing out hey it's ron i got
2191.68s: to get on board and one of the things
2193.60s: that really
2194.80s: uh is curious is that whenever i you
2197.84s: know interact on one of these twitter
2200.56s: spaces or if i do a webinar
2202.96s: with people who are asking questions
2204.88s: about a stock
2206.32s: they almost always ask me mainly about
2209.04s: two types of stocks one the stock that's
2211.60s: up
2212.32s: ten fifteen percent in the last week and
2214.72s: say do you think this is a good buy here
2217.20s: no look where it's come from or they ask
2219.92s: about peloton and zoom and say does it
2223.04s: look like a good buy down here um and
2225.68s: they've been trained by the dip but they
2228.56s: bought the dip at 10 percent down 20
2231.20s: percent 30
2232.56s: 40 and here we are 60 down
2235.52s: dip buying is not a strategy in my mind
2238.88s: so
2239.76s: what we want to do is buy strength
2242.48s: after a dip a true dip
2245.52s: is a stock in an uptrend that pulls back
2248.56s: to a level find support and resumes that
2250.96s: uptrend
2252.24s: if instead the stock
2254.16s: pulls back breaks below key support
2256.64s: breaks below moving averages those
2258.96s: moving averages start to roll over tells
2261.68s: me we're in a different phase for this
2263.36s: stock the sellers have regained control
2266.32s: it's no longer dip buying you're buying
2268.32s: into the abyss you're buying
2271.04s: from institutions who are liquidating
2273.44s: millions of shares and thinking you know
2277.04s: that it's yesterday it's yesterday's
2278.88s: news and using yesterday's logic that
2281.68s: the stock is in an uptrend and the
2283.84s: bounces have been strong
2285.84s: with today's reality that it's a broken
2288.16s: stock right so what i want to do is i
2291.36s: want to focus on the stocks that are in
2293.04s: uptrends and real
2294.88s: simple i mean if you look at a daily
2296.72s: time frame you could look at a 20 and a
2298.96s: 50-day moving average if the 20-day
2300.96s: moving average is above the 50 and
2303.28s: they're both rising to me it's an
2305.52s: uptrend it's innocent until proven
2307.04s: guilty but it doesn't mean i can just
2308.96s: buy it anywhere again it might have just
2311.04s: run 15 in the last three days i don't
2313.36s: want to be late
2315.12s: because a normal pullback from you know
2316.96s: normal correction could shake me out at
2318.96s: a big loss
2320.40s: instead i want to see the stock that ran
2322.24s: up 15 percent
2324.08s: went sideways for a day or two
2326.48s: and then begins to pull back three or
2328.40s: four days
2329.76s: and it maybe retraces half of that
2332.96s: uh rally that it showed i don't want to
2335.44s: buy it as it's pulling back because
2337.28s: again i don't know if this is the time
2338.88s: it's going to catch you
2341.36s: yeah so
2342.96s: as we start to look at shorter term time
2345.04s: frames and you might look at for
2346.40s: instance a 30 minute time frame of the
2348.64s: last 30 days
2350.16s: you'll see that it's come down and it
2352.00s: starts to turn sideways and as it starts
2354.40s: to turn sideways and stabilize it might
2356.96s: be stabilizing on that 20-day moving
2359.20s: average or at a 61.8 percent retracement
2362.24s: or the volume weighted average price
2363.92s: from the prior low
2365.52s: if there's some technical
2367.36s: reason to be interested there
2369.52s: then i'm aware of it and i look at the
2372.00s: shorter term time frame and i i look at
2374.16s: and say okay looks like the battle is
2376.48s: being waged here between the buyers and
2378.40s: sellers right sellers have taken control
2381.04s: for a few days
2382.48s: now it's turning sideways
2384.72s: if we go back to
2386.32s: technical analysis 101 the first rule is
2388.96s: that you know one of the first rules is
2390.32s: a trend once established is more likely
2392.96s: to continue than reverse
2395.20s: so if it paused and as soon as it starts
2398.56s: to make that first little higher high on
2400.48s: the shorter term time frame it emerges
2403.36s: out of the price correction and then a
2405.76s: time correction it makes that first
2407.68s: higher high in the shorter term time
2409.36s: frame it's now in alignment with the
2412.16s: higher high the higher highs and higher
2414.24s: lows on the daily time frame right
2416.08s: that's where i want to get involved and
2418.40s: set my stop underneath whatever the most
2420.72s: recent relevant high or low is so if you
2424.08s: look at my twitter i
2426.00s: never mention stocks without saying
2428.24s: here's where worst case stop would go
2431.36s: it's always again back to what you
2433.20s: picked up on you know first thing you
2434.96s: said is it's always about risk
2436.72s: management you can't get
2439.36s: hung up in your analysis and say
2441.44s: i'm gonna i think i'm right forget the
2443.92s: market i'm gonna buy more you have to
2446.00s: say at this point the dick you know if
2448.96s: if the first point it makes that first
2451.20s: higher high on the short term time frame
2453.84s: after the pullback
2455.44s: that's where the momentum is now in
2457.20s: alignment with the longer term time
2458.64s: frame
2459.68s: now i'm looking at an emerging trend
2462.32s: defined by higher highs and higher lows
2465.12s: so if instead it breaks higher and then
2468.24s: pulls back and makes a lower low
2470.72s: well my definition of trend is no longer
2472.96s: existing
2474.08s: so why on earth would i still want to
2475.76s: hold this stock because i'm stubborn
2478.00s: because i read their annual report and i
2479.84s: spent 10 hours researching this stock on
2482.08s: the on the weekend and i feel like i
2484.00s: have to make money in it that's part of
2486.16s: the danger of doing too in depth of
2488.40s: fundamental research you start to
2490.56s: feel married to it yep
2492.80s: yeah i think that that's so that's
2494.64s: something that i talk quite a bit about
2496.40s: too is
2497.44s: it was funny when i i don't know was
2499.76s: trading for a little while early on i
2502.48s: would see these people talking about
2504.00s: like emotions and ego and to me it was
2506.64s: always just like something that older
2508.16s: dudes talked about because
2510.40s: you know for whatever reason i didn't
2511.60s: understand it because obviously when i
2513.20s: was 22 in a rush to make money i didn't
2515.68s: have an ego at that point obviously
2518.40s: and you know just it's interesting that
2520.72s: you mentioned that though because
2522.48s: i think that something i find
2524.16s: fascinating is
2525.84s: the markets by definition are in
2529.20s: uncertain space
2531.36s: and people try to find certainty by
2535.84s: collecting more data points but what
2538.72s: they
2539.60s: seem to not totally understand is
2541.52s: sometimes exactly like you're saying
2543.52s: they kind of just create this narrative
2545.28s: for themselves that doesn't necessarily
2548.16s: solve the uncertainty the uncertainty is
2549.92s: still there you just have more data
2551.12s: points that you may not believe in
2554.24s: so that leads me actually to another
2555.92s: question and this is actually a genuine
2558.00s: question that i've had for a long time
2559.52s: for for technical
2561.84s: analysis in general there's a handful of
2564.32s: tools that i like to use i like to use
2566.00s: linear regression channels or standard
2567.68s: deviation channels of some sort maybe
2569.84s: bollinger bands and then typically
2572.00s: moving averages maybe fibs sometimes
2574.72s: um but overall pretty limited i do like
2577.76s: to use volume and maybe an oscillator
2581.28s: just to glance at but not too heavily
2584.48s: right something that i've always found
2587.12s: to be difficult to understand
2589.84s: is
2590.88s: the idea of market timing because
2593.92s: obviously i've read a bunch of white
2596.56s: papers
2597.60s: on the behavior of individual investors
2599.92s: and essentially a very difficult time
2601.92s: that traders have
2603.60s: um
2604.64s: predicting timing of in any capacity
2607.92s: and when i was reading through your book
2609.84s: i actually really liked the way that you
2612.96s: use multiple time frames because it's
2614.88s: not so much that you're tr at least this
2616.80s: is my interpretation
2618.24s: it didn't seem so much that you're
2619.60s: necessarily trying to predict
2622.16s: much of anything you're mostly seeing
2624.64s: what's happening and what's most likely
2626.80s: to happen thereafter
2628.96s: and then you're always still using that
2630.72s: stop to kind of catch yourself but i'm
2633.12s: curious when you're
2635.52s: applying your technical analysis to
2637.60s: charts
2638.64s: is that close to what you're doing just
2640.64s: in terms of trying to understand what's
2642.64s: happening and finding the best way to
2644.80s: interact with that or is there more of a
2646.80s: predictive
2648.56s: paradigm that you're applying
2651.12s: um you know predict is
2654.32s: um too strong i i like to anticipate
2658.16s: i like to anticipate different scenarios
2661.04s: and in that if i predict it means i
2663.68s: think i know the outcome right but if i
2665.84s: anticipate you know at least this is how
2667.76s: i differentiate it maybe i'm splitting
2669.60s: hairs over the terminology but if i
2672.08s: anticipate and if i look at the stock
2674.72s: it's in the uptrend i miss that first
2677.12s: move
2678.00s: it goes sideways for a day or two and it
2679.92s: starts to pull back
2681.52s: and then it starts to stabilize a little
2683.68s: bit that's when i really become
2685.52s: interested in it because i say okay you
2687.68s: know the primary trend is higher it was
2689.52s: up on big volume so i look at you know
2691.76s: the my main tools are uh you know time
2694.80s: frames first i want to identify my my
2697.68s: candidate on the bigger picture the
2699.44s: daily time frame
2700.96s: and then as it begins its pullback i
2702.88s: look at a shorter term time frame
2705.20s: on the daily time frame i have as i've
2707.44s: mentioned some simple moving averages i
2709.60s: look at volume i want to see the volume
2711.92s: expanding in the direction of the trend
2714.08s: i want to see relative to that the
2716.32s: lighter volume as it pulls back
2719.20s: and finds you know as it settles into
2722.16s: let's say a 20-day moving average or a
2724.64s: fibonacci or the volume weighted average
2726.72s: price off the prior lows it starts to
2728.64s: settle in and show signs that the
2730.96s: sellers are losing control the buyers
2733.84s: are stepping up a little bit
2735.68s: i want to thank you know okay in terms
2738.24s: of supply and demand
2740.08s: this you know if shorts were shorting
2742.64s: this because they thought it was up too
2743.92s: much
2745.04s: they realize the bigger picture is still
2746.96s: higher and they're most likely going to
2748.88s: look to be covering that adds a source
2750.96s: of demand if there was a big fund that
2753.52s: started you know they have 5 million
2755.20s: shares and they wanted to take a little
2757.28s: bit off while they can they sell it down
2759.52s: to the 50-day moving average you know so
2762.24s: it once it gets the 50-day moving
2764.00s: average they'll stop selling because
2766.16s: they don't want to hurt the stock in
2767.60s: fact they might start you know put a bid
2769.60s: in there to support their position
2772.08s: so i'm trying to think of who are the
2774.24s: players what are they doing how would i
2775.76s: feel if i was short what do i what would
2777.92s: i be doing what if i was long what if i
2780.48s: was you know as i am in cash what's the
2782.80s: right way to look at this it's
2784.48s: stabilizing at a key level it's starting
2786.88s: to show accumulation on a shorter term
2788.88s: time frame
2790.16s: now if it is truly in an uptrend and i'm
2793.84s: buying it as it emerges after that
2795.76s: pullback it should go on and make a
2797.68s: higher high but if it doesn't
2800.56s: then you know then then
2802.40s: there's maybe something wrong here but
2804.40s: even before it gets to that higher high
2806.48s: let's say i pulled back from 25 to 22
2809.44s: and i'm trying to buy it at 22 and a
2811.44s: half as it breaks that near-term little
2813.84s: resistance
2815.12s: i want to know if i'm wrong if it goes
2817.52s: below 2180 i'm out because that's the
2820.72s: most recent relevant higher low for this
2823.20s: consolidation
2824.56s: and that breaks the definition of trend
2826.64s: so it's if then if if it breaks i'll buy
2829.76s: it
2830.64s: and i will continue to hold it but
2832.80s: instead if it breaks lower i need to get
2835.60s: out because
2836.88s: i'm a technical trader the definition of
2839.36s: trend is higher highs and higher lows we
2841.84s: broke that definition
2843.60s: what the hell am i still doing holding
2845.12s: this stock i'm not being true to the
2846.72s: process
2848.08s: that's pretty powerful i think to be
2850.48s: honest i i think that a lot of people
2853.44s: um
2854.40s: you know when things
2855.84s: might mike tyson you know said it the
2857.92s: the best you know everybody's a play
2859.12s: until they get punched in the mouth
2860.72s: yup and as soon as oh you know people
2863.76s: see something
2865.84s: you know diverting from their original
2867.28s: trade hypothesis
2868.88s: it seems really common to rationalize it
2872.16s: oh you know this is because of this or
2874.48s: because of that and it'll it'll revert
2876.80s: it'll be better it'll be okay you know
2878.08s: eric not to interrupt you it goes back
2879.68s: to what we were just talking about in
2881.04s: the fundamental analysis
2883.04s: i i i like everyone learn my lessons the
2886.24s: hard way when i lose big money that's
2888.96s: when i've lost the you learn these
2891.44s: lessons and what i know is in the past
2893.76s: when i've had big losers
2895.76s: and if i'm not familiar with the story
2899.12s: what do i do you know i'm in a stock i
2901.76s: don't want to sell it i'm stubborn
2904.08s: so i start looking at the news i start
2906.56s: pulling up research reports i start
2908.64s: trying to find something
2911.20s: some shred of hope to hold on to because
2913.60s: i know that price isn't it anymore so
2916.64s: you know start to justify it and
2919.36s: it's been a long time since i've been in
2921.28s: that position that's that's a a great
2923.84s: habit to get out of as quick as you can
2926.56s: recognize you know you're holding a
2928.08s: loser and you're starting to justify why
2930.48s: you're holding it that means sell the
2932.32s: stock that's that that's all it means it
2934.48s: means that
2935.60s: it's arrogant to go in and think that
2938.00s: you're going to be right
2939.52s: so part of your plan has to be that risk
2942.80s: management saying
2944.64s: i could be wrong and i don't want to
2946.48s: lose my money i don't you know i i don't
2948.32s: mind losing a little bit i still don't
2950.08s: like losing you know i don't like people
2952.32s: say love your losers i don't love my
2954.16s: losers
2956.24s: i don't like to lose right we're
2958.08s: competitors we want to achieve at high
2960.40s: level losing sucks it's part of the
2962.80s: process
2963.92s: and you realize that and and sometimes
2966.48s: the best way to to to
2969.12s: you know have that point driven home is
2971.84s: that you do buy the stock at 22 and a
2973.68s: half you sell it at 21.80 and you look
2976.88s: at it the next day it's 18.50
2980.48s: and then then it feels that then it
2982.80s: feels good then you like your losses a
2985.20s: little bit more yeah i'm not the dummy
2987.60s: still holding this thing i had my plan
2990.16s: and i executed it
2991.92s: um so you know it it all goes back to
2994.64s: you know controlling those emotions
2997.12s: and the the way to do it is to to have
3000.24s: that anticipation i could be right
3004.40s: or i could be wrong and if i'm wrong i
3006.56s: have to cut my loss that's that's all
3008.48s: there is to it otherwise you know we've
3011.12s: all been there it's just it's just a
3013.84s: disaster
3015.12s: and i mean it's a psychological effect
3017.20s: that pretty much humans have you know
3019.44s: when we have a winning trade we like to
3021.04s: take those off super quick because the
3022.80s: ego we like to be right and we just
3024.48s: confirmed being right and when we're
3025.84s: wrong we don't want to confirm being
3027.76s: wrong so you just kind of sit there and
3029.52s: wait and hold and then you just your
3032.24s: loss is exponentially growing
3033.76s: potentially
3034.96s: um something to that end actually that
3037.84s: i'm a really big advocate of and i'm
3040.64s: actually curious if you apply any sort
3043.52s: of version of this it sounds like you do
3045.60s: especially with setting your your stops
3047.60s: or wherever you're going to exit but
3049.68s: i'm i'm really
3051.68s: a big advocate of setting profit and
3054.72s: loss targets before you enter a trade
3057.92s: before the emotions are involved and
3060.16s: before all of that exists
3062.24s: it sounds like you do that when we're
3064.56s: talking to the downside right you you
3067.04s: talk about where your next support level
3068.56s: is do you do any form of that when it
3071.28s: comes to profit taking to know when to
3074.00s: take a winning trade off
3075.60s: yeah here's here's how i handle winners
3077.76s: is that
3079.60s: one of what i consider one of my key
3081.92s: strengths in the market
3084.24s: is because i'm looking at multiple time
3085.92s: frames and it's not just the daily and
3087.84s: the you know 30 minute chart i'll go
3089.92s: down to a 10 minute time frame i'll go
3091.60s: down to a two minute time frame when it
3093.28s: comes time to entry so one of my
3095.60s: strengths is that i i'm pretty right on
3098.80s: my entries
3100.16s: um that i'm i'm going to know right away
3102.48s: whether i'm right or wrong because it's
3104.08s: going to start to move it's at the level
3106.32s: where it's supposed to right so when i
3108.88s: enter i enter at
3111.52s: you know at a bigger size intentionally
3114.88s: um because my timing is good enough that
3118.08s: that i know that's one of my strengths
3120.72s: i add a little exercise but my intent is
3123.52s: as soon as it begins to rally and
3125.60s: generally i don't know if you're
3126.72s: familiar with pivot analysis the the
3129.20s: floor trader pivots daily pivot r1 and
3132.88s: r2 s1 and s2 i'll use those as my first
3137.92s: level for taking a third of my position
3140.32s: off so again if we go back to the stock
3142.64s: that was 22 and a half
3144.72s: most likely daily r2 would be somewhere
3148.32s: around
3151.04s: and 12 cents let's say okay
3153.52s: so i'll i'll see it run up to dailyr2
3156.56s: and i'll either sell some immediately
3158.24s: there because a lot of times that's the
3160.16s: high of the day
3161.44s: because there's a lot of programs based
3162.96s: around them so i'll sell that first
3165.04s: third right then and there
3167.12s: and and then i'll hold my two-thirds
3168.88s: position what i do with the balance is i
3171.60s: then raise my stop up to
3174.08s: my
3175.12s: generally you know right around my cost
3177.44s: basis
3178.40s: so if i get stopped out on the
3180.40s: two-thirds of break even
3182.40s: and i've taken 60 cents on the first
3185.04s: third it means that i'll get i'll be out
3187.52s: of the stock with a 20 profit on average
3191.28s: so i want to be in a position of
3192.80s: strength and winners don't take care of
3195.28s: themselves it's about aggressive you
3198.00s: know money management once you're in
3199.68s: them as well
3200.88s: if the stock continues to rally
3203.28s: i'll raise my stop and what i what i'll
3205.68s: often do is you know let's say i get a
3207.28s: nice ended day push it ran another
3209.60s: dollar and a quarter well i might set
3212.08s: half of my stop below the midday low the
3214.48s: next morning the next morning i'll set
3216.56s: it below the prior day's midday low
3218.72s: and then i'll keep my stop on the other
3221.12s: third at break even it might break even
3224.16s: cost so now if i get stopped out of a
3227.12s: third with this much gain another third
3229.12s: with this much gain
3230.72s: and down here i've got break even i'm
3232.72s: gonna give that final third
3234.88s: a lot more wiggle room so that maybe i
3237.68s: can hold it you know if i don't get
3239.12s: stopped out of the second third i'll
3240.96s: just continue to raise that one very
3242.96s: aggressively up under the success of
3244.80s: higher lows
3246.16s: and then the final third i'll trowel it
3249.28s: with a wider
3250.96s: uh
3252.00s: stop using again the definition of trend
3255.28s: but on a larger time frame so that it
3257.92s: might be
3259.28s: i can hold this stock for two to three
3261.12s: weeks
3262.08s: and survive some of these one and one of
3264.48s: one and a half point pullbacks on a 25
3267.84s: stock now um and then i'll get stopped
3270.40s: at let's say 26 and 80 cents on that
3273.84s: final third and maybe i took you know 60
3276.72s: cents on the first third
3278.88s: two dollars and 80 cents on the second
3280.72s: third but i make six dollars on the
3282.32s: final third it's it's worth holding that
3285.20s: and you know i never regret selling the
3287.60s: early pieces because there's there's a
3289.84s: lot of times where i will sell that
3291.60s: first third for the 60 cent gain i'll
3294.40s: get stopped out of the rest at break
3295.92s: even
3296.72s: and then i'll see the stock decline
3298.40s: it'll go down a dollar
3300.08s: and i got out with 20 cents profit and
3302.88s: and to me
3304.16s: it's those incremental gains as well and
3307.52s: not letting them turn into losers
3310.48s: really makes a big difference at the end
3312.48s: of the year
3313.44s: i think that i mean that last part
3315.60s: really is huge is not allowing winners
3318.16s: to turn into losers that's something i
3320.56s: personally trade i'm mostly a
3322.16s: derivatives trader so i trade options in
3324.00s: futures primarily
3326.08s: but when i'm trading longer durations i
3328.32s: have a very different strategy when i'm
3329.92s: day trading it literally looks almost
3332.72s: identical to that where i'll break a
3334.72s: position either into thirds or quarters
3336.96s: right and i find the literally the exact
3340.16s: same thing because
3342.32s: a lot of times
3344.08s: traders
3345.84s: again think in this like we were talking
3347.52s: about earlier fundamental analysis or
3349.76s: technical analysis right trade is on or
3352.64s: the trade is off
3354.32s: and they kind of forget to take a little
3355.84s: creative license in there and to play
3358.48s: with scaling more a lot of traders i
3361.04s: think are two black and white and they
3362.24s: think that if they exit then you know
3363.68s: they should exit the whole thing
3366.56s: i really like that
3368.16s: so i wanted to talk a little bit more
3370.88s: specifically about
3373.20s: your technical analysis approach
3375.52s: obviously i i was fortunate enough to to
3377.60s: get a lot of it from from your book
3380.16s: um but if you were to list out your
3383.92s: typical
3384.96s: trading time frame because that last
3387.28s: part actually surprised me when you said
3388.64s: that you know sometimes you might take a
3390.24s: trade out with that last third you know
3392.24s: like two weeks or something i i wasn't
3393.92s: anticipating that um
3396.16s: what what kind of time frames would you
3398.00s: say you trade generally speaking
3401.12s: i i like to i like to think of myself as
3403.20s: a swing trader okay um so if the stock
3406.80s: allows me to
3408.48s: um so most of my day trades or either i
3411.04s: get stopped out of my what i thought was
3413.20s: going to be a swing trade right away
3414.88s: because it violated my stop and i have
3416.88s: to move on so the market told me to day
3419.20s: trade it um i do some day trades when
3422.80s: you know when i'm just sitting there
3424.00s: there's an opportunity it's just so
3425.52s: obvious
3426.64s: that i
3427.52s: can't resist taking it
3429.76s: but i prefer not to be a day trader okay
3433.12s: um so i i like to swing trade and
3436.64s: generally what the market allows me to
3439.28s: do
3440.24s: uh in successful swing trades is hold
3443.12s: them
3443.92s: the sweet spot is really probably three
3446.08s: to eight days somewhere in there
3448.56s: um and then if if like i said i've got
3451.28s: that final third piece
3454.24s: maybe i'll even sell half of that third
3456.48s: so now i'm down to one-sixth of the
3458.32s: position
3459.60s: and i might try to hold that i i try to
3462.72s: experiment with holding it for a month
3465.20s: or six weeks but what i find out is once
3468.16s: i get beyond that two to three week
3470.08s: period
3471.84s: i'm generally better just being stopped
3474.24s: out rather than trying to hold for a
3476.00s: bigger move
3477.20s: and of course it's you know
3480.16s: depending on what the market what phase
3482.00s: of the market we're in right now
3484.08s: where you know growth stocks are getting
3486.32s: hit hard they're not bouncing um and the
3489.68s: ones that follow through
3491.60s: don't do so for as long it you know
3493.92s: three three to eight days is you know a
3496.32s: longer term window right now for my
3498.56s: trades more of them so when there's
3500.88s: great you know heightened sense of
3502.56s: uncertainty in the market the market
3505.04s: naturally shrinks my time frame it's not
3508.00s: that i'm
3509.44s: sometimes i'm thinking well the market's
3511.12s: more volatile so i'm going to be quicker
3512.64s: to take a little bit off i'm going to
3514.24s: raise my stop
3515.60s: you know faster because moves haven't
3518.24s: followed through but a lot of times it's
3520.00s: just the market tells me that and
3522.80s: and that's the key is to really be able
3525.36s: to objectively listen to the market
3528.84s: and you know in it truly listen not just
3532.96s: hear it but listen and say okay the
3534.72s: market's saying get out get out that's
3536.40s: that's it and then as i go through my
3538.72s: stocks at the end of the day i start to
3540.40s: see hey there's more stocks here that
3542.80s: look like they're ready to break down
3544.24s: than i've seen in the last week that's
3546.48s: the market telling me something i'm not
3549.20s: finding long candidates that's that's
3551.92s: important information that the market's
3553.76s: telling me it's saying hey you know
3556.00s: maybe it's okay to you know do some
3558.00s: smaller short sales
3559.84s: um so it's it's all about trying to be
3562.96s: as objective in listening to the message
3565.28s: of the market as possible
3567.20s: and using the experience that i've
3569.28s: accumulated over the last 30 years to
3572.48s: you know
3573.36s: make sure i i i implement whatever plan
3576.48s: i come up with
3577.76s: and not let my ego get in the way
3579.60s: there's there's still times it surprises
3581.44s: me eric that
3582.56s: you know it doesn't happen very often
3584.56s: but once in a while i look at my account
3586.40s: and go wait a minute who's trading this
3588.56s: account today that's that's not me
3590.48s: that's not the guy that that i've
3592.56s: trained myself to be in the market that
3594.96s: i i was an emotional basket case i
3597.68s: didn't do anything right i broke 12
3599.60s: rules today
3600.96s: what the heck is you know where does
3602.40s: that come from it's it's bizarre
3604.88s: it's yeah it's funny you say that
3606.96s: because
3608.08s: another big it's it's fascinating
3610.56s: talking to other traders because you
3612.16s: find so many
3613.44s: commonalities because that that's
3615.12s: another big one for me is
3617.44s: trying to
3618.80s: impose what we want the market to do or
3622.08s: what we think the market should do just
3623.92s: leads to errors it just leads to
3625.76s: problems yeah and it's exactly like
3627.92s: you're saying taking a look at the
3629.04s: market and seeing the best way for us to
3631.92s: tailor our current skill set to
3634.00s: interface with what the market is doing
3636.40s: tends to be a lot more successful
3637.92s: instead of trying to force things onto
3639.92s: it
3640.64s: and another thing that i i actually just
3642.88s: did a video on this not too long ago
3645.04s: is the concept of emotions because a lot
3648.88s: of people talk about this idea of you
3650.72s: know trying to be like a machine or a
3652.64s: robot and i think that that just sets
3654.72s: people up for failure because at the end
3656.32s: of the day
3657.28s: we need to control our emotions with
3659.52s: certainty for sure we have to do that
3661.68s: but you can only control them if you
3663.44s: acknowledge they exist
3665.12s: and this idea of you know i'm just going
3667.04s: to follow all these rules and like you
3668.32s: said sometimes you know throughout the
3670.16s: day
3670.88s: you just have this other version of
3672.32s: yourself pop out and you're like who the
3673.76s: hell is that guy and
3675.76s: you know that that that's emotions at
3677.60s: work it's
3678.80s: i i think it's something
3680.88s: that
3682.08s: i've become really interested and in
3684.72s: tune with because the way that i keep
3687.60s: trade logs is for especially for shorter
3690.56s: term trades i have like a couple notes
3692.48s: section that i have to fill out
3694.48s: and i'll read them i literally go
3696.32s: through this big annual review at the
3697.52s: end of the year and i'm reading through
3698.64s: some of them now and it's it's
3700.40s: legitimately kind of funny because i can
3702.08s: look at it and be like who the hell is
3703.76s: that guy some of them some of them are
3705.60s: really emotional
3708.08s: um
3708.80s: the more experience you get the the good
3710.88s: news is that you recognize those periods
3713.60s: quicker you recognize them during the
3715.92s: day when you're down x p l
3719.44s: and don't continue to fight and chase
3721.68s: you instead you you know hey back off
3724.88s: you're you're exhibiting you know
3726.88s: dangerous behavior to your financial uh
3729.60s: well-being here back off slow down go
3732.72s: for a walk do something get away from
3734.56s: the screen for a while go reset
3736.80s: and
3738.08s: that's
3738.96s: you know i think that human nature is
3740.88s: always gonna we're always gonna have
3742.48s: some little
3744.32s: self-destructive seed that if we let it
3747.52s: ferment it's going to turn into
3749.44s: something stronger but it it
3752.24s: the key is to recognize it quicker
3755.28s: and then take the preventative actions
3757.52s: that that to me
3759.68s: is is you know it used to be that that
3762.40s: this alter ego would show up once or
3764.32s: twice a year and my big thing was that i
3767.68s: would find a stock that's down too much
3770.80s: and i would buy just a little bit
3773.52s: you know to to test the waters and then
3776.16s: it'll drop you know let's say let's say
3778.00s: i buy 400 shares but then it drops three
3780.88s: dollars and i'm looking at going well i
3782.96s: have to buy more now i'm not going to
3784.64s: sell like 1200 average and and and then
3788.56s: i'd you know puke it out at the end of
3790.32s: the day for a 20 000 loss and go wait a
3793.28s: minute i that's not how i trade what
3795.92s: right happened there
3797.60s: so
3798.40s: now that doesn't happen on you know with
3801.12s: with his bigger number it's but i i i'm
3804.96s: more in tune with catching it
3806.96s: catching it quickly and correcting it
3808.72s: and saying wait a minute this is just
3810.40s: stupid don't for don't forget the times
3812.88s: you did this and it cost you a lot just
3815.52s: move to the sidelines
3817.28s: stop
3818.32s: right
3819.12s: yeah i it for me i i don't really day
3822.32s: trade super frequently anymore i
3824.16s: actually fall into a more similar
3825.52s: category to you where i probably manage
3827.76s: my trades within 20 days normally
3830.88s: um but when i do
3832.88s: venture into day trading i've set like a
3835.12s: couple
3836.32s: hard and fast rules one of which is as
3839.12s: soon as i get stopped out like three
3841.20s: times in a row on something like that's
3843.20s: just go do something else that's it for
3844.64s: the day yeah um i and it's just because
3847.20s: for me luckily day trading isn't really
3849.04s: the the primary you know development
3851.04s: approach that i have
3852.56s: or income approach at this point but i
3854.96s: have learned that once i start having
3857.84s: successive stops then sometimes you know
3860.96s: i i get well i got to get this right you
3863.28s: know i got to figure it out and then all
3864.88s: of a sudden you know it's just stupid
3866.48s: mistakes yeah um you mentioned a little
3869.76s: bit you know obviously some important
3873.76s: habits you've developed over time and if
3876.64s: you were to list out like maybe your top
3879.28s: three or five habits
3881.20s: that you've developed since you started
3883.44s: trading to now what would those be
3887.12s: number one don't chase moves i mean that
3890.00s: that it's so easy to get excited and
3892.48s: feel that fomo and chase stocks
3895.12s: um always ask yourself where has it come
3897.76s: from
3898.72s: you know is it expended much energy
3900.80s: getting to where it is where does it
3902.56s: have the potential to go is it running
3904.88s: into a
3906.56s: an important prior level of support that
3908.80s: has the potential to become resistance
3911.04s: in in and think of it as fresh money
3913.04s: what's my risk reward here
3915.52s: if i was the guy who bought
3917.60s: three days ago when it was 15 lower and
3920.32s: it's now breaking out it makes sense to
3923.28s: sell some to the breakout chasers so ask
3927.28s: those questions where does it come from
3929.04s: where does it have the potential to go
3931.28s: my habits are to you know just
3933.92s: continually
3935.60s: uh you know scan the market manually
3938.72s: with my own two eyes
3940.48s: looking at you know getting a better
3942.48s: feel for the market by looking at a lot
3944.16s: of stocks looking at stocks i know i'm
3946.32s: not going to trade but just saying here
3947.92s: are the themes that seem to be setting
3949.60s: up it's not that i'm gonna scan
3952.48s: and tell the market
3954.32s: here's a list of types of stocks i want
3956.56s: to buy instead i want to listen to the
3958.40s: market i have a general idea of what i
3961.04s: want and i could program that very
3963.44s: easily
3964.48s: but i don't get the same feel for the
3966.32s: market so for me i have to be in tune
3968.24s: with the market
3969.52s: and you know let's say i come back from
3971.20s: vacation
3972.40s: almost like i was looking at the market
3973.92s: on vacation
3975.20s: right
3976.08s: but i often won't trade that first day
3978.56s: because i my feel isn't there my my i
3981.44s: haven't been involved with actual
3984.24s: money in the market i can look at the
3986.08s: charts
3987.28s: right in in and know where we are in the
3989.84s: overall cycle but my feel isn't there so
3993.44s: i
3994.08s: need to just you know sometimes just
3996.24s: slow things down a little bit is you
3998.80s: know and that's a habit as well just
4000.80s: slow things down don't have to try to be
4003.12s: involved in everything
4005.12s: it's again just
4007.76s: i every once in a while i'll put a video
4010.16s: out about you know just some habits that
4012.32s: i think are important you know that
4014.24s: looking back and
4015.76s: um i really like the one you mentioned
4017.84s: about slowing down because a lot of
4019.60s: people i find myself i literally this
4022.40s: morning i was like doing my morning
4023.84s: workout and i was watching something and
4025.92s: it started to move and i was like
4027.84s: immediately starting to place a trade i
4029.60s: was like whoa
4030.64s: like chill out dude you're not even like
4032.88s: i didn't know if that earnings coming up
4034.56s: anything and i was like setting this
4036.00s: trade up on my phone
4037.84s: and i realized like i still have that
4040.48s: tendency sometimes where i feel like i'm
4041.92s: gonna miss something you know if i don't
4043.52s: jump in right now that fomo that you're
4045.52s: talking about so i think that that
4047.44s: cautionary tale in general of like
4049.44s: slowing down
4050.96s: is um just really powerful
4053.68s: um
4054.88s: just real quickly and i mean i i
4057.60s: have those feelings once in a while too
4059.20s: i'll be looking at my phone you know in
4061.44s: bed going what's the market doing and
4063.36s: i'll see something happening um but i i
4066.32s: i try not to look at my phone or look at
4068.24s: the market until i i don't like to be in
4070.72s: front of my computer
4072.24s: uh at the most for more than an hour
4074.72s: before the market opens only if there's
4076.48s: an economic event but generally i like
4078.88s: to be in front of the computer about a
4081.04s: half hour before the market opens
4083.20s: because sometimes i just get itchy and i
4085.60s: and i know this about me and i'll buy
4087.68s: something in the market when i know i
4089.36s: shouldn't
4090.40s: and those end up being mistakes more
4093.60s: often than not
4094.96s: so to
4096.24s: you know prevent myself from doing that
4098.88s: i say well i'm not allowed to sit in
4100.72s: front of the computer until nine nine
4102.64s: eastern right gives me the ability i can
4105.36s: read you know i can read my little
4107.12s: summary newsletters and that sort of
4109.04s: thing but i can't let myself get in
4111.12s: front of price action because i'm not
4113.28s: good at trading in the pre-market and it
4116.56s: ends up costing me money so i i i'm not
4119.60s: allowed to do it i don't you know i
4121.20s: don't allow myself right
4123.12s: yeah it's it's funny because it is one
4125.04s: of those things that i feel like
4127.28s: over time you definitely learn to get a
4129.76s: handle on um but it's interesting to
4132.24s: hear you know that the the urge is still
4134.96s: there for you except i say it all the
4136.32s: time i say it jokingly but anybody who
4139.04s: actively trades we all have a little bit
4140.72s: of degenerate in us somewhere in there
4143.28s: yeah we got that dude that just wants to
4145.04s: get in there and just start slinging
4146.40s: money
4147.84s: and it's important obviously keep that
4150.00s: in its proper place because it gets out
4152.40s: of control quick
4154.16s: um so
4155.60s: i wanted to ask you another
4158.08s: kind of list of some of your favorites
4160.64s: um but this one i wanted to to pivot to
4163.52s: kind of your favorite
4166.08s: ta tools
4168.24s: so
4169.04s: from your book you actually do a like
4171.92s: really really great job outlining a lot
4175.44s: of the tools that you like to use and
4177.20s: the circumstances you like to use you
4179.04s: know obviously a lot of talk about
4180.32s: moving averages and volume you know
4182.40s: things like that which
4183.76s: funny enough those are probably some of
4185.76s: the the primary tools that i generally
4188.48s: also use which i think is just a
4191.60s: indication of how universally they can
4193.52s: be applied depending on you know your
4195.44s: trading approach but i'm really curious
4197.76s: if again if you were to give a handful
4200.24s: of your must technical trading tools
4203.84s: what are those
4206.24s: obviously price only price pays i had to
4208.48s: throw that in there at some point
4211.04s: price
4211.92s: volume some moving averages
4214.40s: simple moving averages whether it's
4216.00s: simple or exponential is irrelevant
4218.72s: multiple time frames
4220.64s: um
4221.60s: anchored volume weighted average price
4224.24s: and
4225.68s: the lower
4227.44s: tiered ones i do a little bit of
4229.28s: fibonacci stuff
4231.44s: just general retracements
4233.52s: um pivot levels as i discussed
4237.84s: and
4239.52s: what else sometimes i'll look at a
4242.16s: volume volume by price seldom but
4244.96s: sometimes i look at that so the keys are
4247.76s: price multiple time frames
4250.40s: moving averages volume
4252.88s: volume weighted average price
4255.52s: got it and just out of curiosity how did
4258.00s: you come across like how did the anchor
4260.48s: at v wap find its way into your tool kit
4262.56s: because i actually found that to be
4263.92s: pretty
4264.72s: unique to you other people will talk
4266.48s: about it but like that also came through
4268.72s: um when i was reading some of what what
4270.88s: you talk about and i found that
4272.48s: interesting because a lot of people talk
4273.68s: about v wap but not everybody actually
4277.04s: ties it to an anchor so how did that
4279.12s: come to how did that come to be
4281.36s: well in 2003 i was trading on a platform
4284.32s: called real tech and real tick had
4286.88s: you know the daily volume weighted
4288.40s: average price on there that represented
4290.48s: as a moving average um it's not a moving
4292.96s: average but it represented like one on
4294.80s: your chart um and then they had a trend
4297.28s: tool called you know that you could drag
4300.56s: from left to right it would show up as a
4302.24s: horizontal line
4303.76s: and when i drag it across the screen it
4305.76s: would go up and down and it would keep
4307.52s: hitting at prices so it was actually a
4310.08s: volume weighted average trend line
4312.64s: uh that would it was kind of weird to
4315.36s: analyze but then i started playing with
4318.64s: the when i had the volume weighted
4320.56s: average price on a chart i realized that
4323.52s: if i change the time frame to like 10
4325.84s: minutes and went back 10 days it would
4328.24s: give me
4329.20s: the 10 day volume weighted average price
4332.08s: so i started just i would
4333.92s: play around with the date in the time
4335.68s: frame to see
4337.44s: hey well from that earnings report i
4339.52s: wonder what the volume weighted average
4341.04s: price was that was 13 days ago so i'd
4343.28s: have to just switch it to a 13 day view
4346.00s: and it allowed me to basically anchor
4348.08s: from that point so i started noticing
4350.72s: how
4351.52s: how
4352.48s: relevant it was to price action that
4354.64s: institutions were either defending it or
4358.00s: you know on the on the long or short
4360.16s: side and it became you know like a
4362.40s: hidden point where buyers and sellers
4364.80s: would show up
4366.00s: so i you know kind of played around with
4368.64s: that for a while and and asked real tech
4371.28s: if they could you know build it as a
4373.60s: tool that you could anchor from any
4375.52s: point they never did it but tc2000 did
4379.12s: about five years ago and they put it on
4382.08s: as the volume weighted average price by
4384.24s: alpha trends that's my handle and um now
4387.52s: it's you know point and click and and
4389.52s: it's on
4390.72s: you know it from from that introduction
4393.12s: about five years ago it's now on about a
4395.12s: dozen different platforms where you can
4397.52s: very easily anchor from any point
4399.84s: forward to understand who's in control
4403.12s: with absolute 100 certainty from any
4406.08s: point in time
4407.60s: that it's not a subjective analysis tool
4411.04s: it's factual supply and demand
4413.68s: that's fascinating and what time frame
4416.00s: do you normally like to use for your
4418.16s: anchor
4420.32s: whatever is relevant i i put them on a a
4424.32s: chart from five years ago
4426.80s: uh where there was a significant high
4429.68s: and maybe it's you know undergone a
4432.00s: long-term accumulation it pops up
4435.12s: and you'd be surprised it hits it
4437.68s: to the t you know it runs twenty percent
4440.80s: hits that v web from the peak five years
4442.88s: ago and then pulls back i mean it's
4445.04s: crazy
4446.08s: so i'll look at them i want to be aware
4448.96s: of all the time frames generally
4451.28s: speaking okay now it's not often i go to
4453.76s: a weekly time frame and look to anchor
4455.92s: something but if if i can't find it on
4458.32s: my daily chart i want to be aware of
4460.72s: what's on the bigger picture is there's
4462.40s: something there i should be aware of
4463.68s: that has the potential to become
4465.76s: supportive resistance the longer it's
4468.00s: been out there the less likely it's
4470.16s: going to have current memory attached to
4472.08s: it but there's still people like myself
4474.48s: who will look at it and decide not to
4476.40s: buy because it's close to that or to
4478.32s: take some profits because it's close to
4480.00s: that level so intraday you know i like
4483.20s: to use it on by you know
4485.36s: 15 minute time frames or 30 minute time
4488.40s: frame so i can see the high
4490.32s: 20 days ago
4491.92s: in the low eight days ago and how they
4494.32s: converge together to form you know a
4497.20s: volume weighted average price pinch and
4499.36s: you know you can see factually that
4502.00s: transition from supply controlled market
4505.20s: to demand you know reaching that
4507.68s: equilibrium of the battle reaching the
4509.76s: equilibrium and then where demand
4512.08s: retakes that control with again 100
4515.92s: certainty that the average price from
4517.84s: that point the buyers are in control
4520.64s: right right that makes a ton of sense
4523.36s: um and then another question i have is
4525.92s: where do fibonaccis fit into this
4528.56s: because you were kind of mentioning that
4529.60s: they're like a secondary tier where do
4531.36s: those fit in for you a lot of times i'll
4533.60s: just use them as a again second tertiary
4536.56s: tier level day
4538.16s: i'll see the stock that goes from
4540.96s: 28 to 35
4543.20s: and then it pulls back to the rising
4545.76s: 20-day moving average and i'll look at
4548.08s: the 28 to 35 and i'll put a fibonacci
4550.56s: and say hey it's right there at the 61.8
4553.52s: retracement so i want to look at and say
4556.24s: you know what's the psychology of the
4558.48s: rising 20-day moving average okay the
4560.88s: psychology is shorts will cover as it
4563.92s: approaches that
4565.36s: longs will you know try to establish
4567.76s: support for their bigger position in
4569.76s: their sideline money will come in shorts
4572.72s: will not want to short it so it's a
4575.60s: transition of supply and demand at this
4577.84s: level deemed important by the market
4580.72s: a smaller piece is a 61.8 percent
4584.56s: retracement level when it pulls back
4586.72s: there the people who counter trend
4588.24s: shorts will say hey we should cover it's
4590.24s: a 61.8 pullback it's still in a primary
4593.20s: uptrend let's take our profits
4595.76s: a big institution will say hey it's
4597.60s: pulled back 61.8 percent we've got 5
4600.48s: million shares of this thing we sold 300
4602.80s: 000 let's bid for 100 000 so
4605.60s: it sticks in this level sideline cash
4608.32s: will come in and say hey i'm a fibonacci
4610.48s: guy i buy 61.8 retracements so it's all
4614.00s: about trying to determine how the
4615.76s: psychology of supply and demand comes
4617.84s: together through those various
4619.92s: participants to form
4622.64s: the basis of hey we're at an inflection
4625.60s: level potential support because it's the
4627.84s: 20-day moving average because it's the v
4630.08s: web from that prior low and it's the
4632.24s: 61.8 retracement so we have three
4635.84s: different groups of of participants long
4638.24s: short and cash coming together in the
4640.64s: same area
4642.64s: to find the same conclusion that one we
4645.52s: shouldn't sell short or if we were short
4647.68s: we should cover if we're on the
4649.44s: sidelines in cash maybe we start to
4651.36s: nibble and you know just forms that
4654.56s: psychology the i'm sorry the the picture
4657.68s: of supply and demand
4659.52s: by understanding you know the
4661.20s: motivations of the participants
4663.36s: right and then can you settle a debate
4666.16s: do you like to draw your fibonaccis from
4669.12s: highs and lows or from close and opens
4672.56s: uh highs and lows yeah i i like to
4675.12s: encompass the whole range
4677.12s: and same is true for the v web you know
4679.20s: i want to know
4680.80s: the i want to know the psychology of all
4683.20s: the participants within that range
4686.16s: got it that makes a ton of sense
4688.24s: um
4690.88s: okay cool so i wanted to wrap things up
4694.64s: um being mindful of your time and one of
4697.36s: the
4698.48s: couple last questions i had for you is
4700.80s: obviously looking back 2020 2022 um just
4705.04s: really unique time frame you know in the
4706.80s: markets even from the covid drop to the
4709.52s: parabolic recovery but i'm curious to
4712.48s: get just your general sentiments you
4714.64s: know again just looking through your
4716.88s: paradigm at the markets what did you
4719.44s: what stood out in 2021 and what was kind
4722.96s: of something either that was impactful
4725.28s: that you didn't expect anything like
4726.64s: that
4728.16s: um i think that there's you know a lot
4729.84s: of things you can look at in the market
4731.92s: and you know learn lessons from and and
4734.48s: to me that it's just kind of
4736.80s: reiterating what i
4738.72s: kind of already know that you know it to
4741.76s: me it doesn't make sense to buy dips
4744.16s: that people fall in love with names
4746.32s: again going back to some of these
4747.92s: leaders that that have been hit so hard
4750.56s: down 50 80 percent
4752.88s: um and people are stuck on zoom and
4755.68s: peloton and paypal and you know the list
4758.16s: goes on and on and on uh
4760.88s: so you know
4762.48s: staying true to the trend
4765.44s: rather than the story is is what
4768.80s: helps me avoid losing money more than
4771.84s: anything
4772.96s: and then focusing on the stocks that are
4776.08s: in those low risk positions and to me
4778.88s: it's you know i
4780.72s: i don't i'm not a person who has
4783.20s: grand you know uh themes for next year i
4786.32s: think that they're kind of foolish to to
4788.72s: do for my time frame i have the ability
4791.28s: to be flexible if my time frame is three
4794.08s: to eight days why on earth would i try
4796.08s: to project something a year out and say
4798.32s: well my price target for the s p this
4800.16s: year and i think these industry groups
4801.92s: are going to lead or whatever it's got
4804.32s: nothing to do with how i put money into
4806.48s: the market and move it in and out so
4809.36s: to me it's always about staying true to
4811.68s: the process
4812.96s: staying focused on
4814.88s: being religious about cutting losers
4817.52s: position sizing
4819.28s: you know risk management your money
4821.12s: management in terms of overall portfolio
4823.52s: in in one position when do i hit the gas
4826.24s: when when the light is green and when do
4828.96s: i slow down and
4830.64s: just nibble on things
4832.48s: uh on tester pieces to you know i i
4835.84s: would still want to be involved in the
4837.52s: stock but the market's not really
4839.92s: uh showing me good signs so
4842.88s: i i'd hate for it to go without me but i
4845.84s: want to be involved without a lot of
4848.08s: risks so taking smaller positions and
4850.80s: just being flexible i i think is is what
4853.36s: i want to
4855.36s: be able to continue to do is is
4858.40s: to you know i hate to repeat myself over
4860.88s: and over again but i want to objectively
4863.36s: listen to the market
4865.52s: as best i can
4867.12s: and not force my opinions but
4870.48s: find those low risk high probability
4872.72s: setups cut my losers quickly if the
4875.12s: market tells me to and
4876.96s: and uh you know do the best job i can
4879.84s: holding as big a piece for as long as as
4882.72s: the trade lets me to right right
4885.76s: so you hit a little bit of kind of you
4888.64s: know your time frame that you like to
4890.00s: look at um so don't have to go into
4893.04s: specifics here but for the last question
4894.80s: i am curious when you're
4897.04s: like just getting ready for 2022 what
4899.76s: kind of things come into your mind
4902.16s: obviously
4903.52s: not necessarily talking about price
4905.04s: prediction market drops you know stuff
4906.80s: like that but just you know when we're
4908.24s: looking at the next year what are some
4910.56s: factors that you're integrating into
4912.96s: that lens
4914.80s: well i think it's more about
4916.96s: you know
4917.76s: uh having my mind in a good place and
4920.72s: being well rested and you know not
4923.28s: deviating from my plans and making sure
4925.68s: that i've done the homework the night
4927.20s: before so that i'm thoroughly prepared
4929.60s: for the next day
4931.04s: um that i'm staying healthy that i'm uh
4934.08s: you know i i've been doing it long
4936.08s: enough that it it's it's it's not about
4938.48s: hey i need to read a new book about
4940.56s: money management it's about am i holding
4943.36s: myself accountable to the truths that i
4946.32s: know and they're in not letting myself
4948.40s: get distracted by something on you know
4951.60s: i don't i don't i don't watch cnbc
4953.84s: because it doesn't help me it in fact
4955.92s: hurts me and not because it's bad
4957.52s: information but it just it distracts me
4960.48s: and someone will be talking about a
4962.16s: stock i'll pull it up i'll be bored and
4963.84s: i'll trade it and i'll lose money
4965.76s: because i haven't done the work uh not
4968.80s: letting twitter become a distraction
4972.64s: for me it's about tuning out the outside
4975.04s: noise
4976.16s: making sure that my mind is in a place
4978.96s: where
4979.76s: i can perform at my best
4982.16s: making sure i know
4984.48s: that i can execute what i know that i've
4988.00s: learned through
4989.20s: a lot of hard experience cutting the
4991.84s: same same things we've been talking
4993.36s: about
4994.32s: yeah i i actually really like that i
4996.72s: think it's like a great ending note to
4998.64s: focus more on your personal game plan
5001.36s: and less on the external noise yeah i
5004.00s: think i think a lot of people get
5005.52s: wrapped up in that even myself included
5007.52s: sometimes i know when
5009.28s: amc was going crazy at the beginning of
5011.20s: the year and you know i i wasn't
5013.28s: participating i was watching it very
5014.88s: closely and then i started nibbling um
5017.52s: and the trade worked out thankfully but
5021.28s: you know that's exactly what you're
5022.48s: talking about i was definitely paying a
5024.64s: lot of attention to external noise a
5026.24s: little fomo came in so i started
5027.84s: nibbling but um that can be dangerous so
5031.04s: again that's still that's the degenerate
5032.80s: in me coming out yeah we
5035.76s: he lives in there um but this thank you
5038.96s: so much for uh taking some time to chat
5041.44s: with us the
5043.44s: the perspective you bring i really think
5045.36s: it's fascinating and i think it's
5046.64s: something that a lot of people that
5048.24s: follow the at least my channel um are
5051.60s: interested in because i again
5054.56s: have a certain lens that i applied to
5056.40s: the market but your lens also applies to
5059.52s: a lot of people and i mean i'm even
5061.52s: excited to learn more about um what you
5064.40s: do in your expertise so thank you for
5066.64s: taking some time to hang out with us
5068.16s: yeah thank you so much eric and uh you

5072.72s: know i've made sacrifices in ways that i
5075.68s: can't begin to realize so i appreciate
5078.00s: that and uh you know there's there's all
5080.00s: kinds of ways to the finish line here in
5081.76s: the market and you know that one of the
5083.84s: things i would encourage people to do is
5085.76s: to make sure that you find one that's
5088.64s: truly suitable to your personality and
5091.12s: and you know figuring out what your time
5093.20s: frame is
5094.40s: and you know tuning out noise and just
5097.60s: being as objective about the you know
5100.16s: getting the results as possible
5102.16s: yeah well thank you and we definitely
5103.84s: you know appreciate you taking the time

5112.64s: before about doing maybe looking at some
5114.24s: charts and having you walk us through

5117.36s: because um i would love to learn you
5119.52s: know more about your approach and
5120.64s: whatnot i think that'd be a great time

5124.56s: all perfect that lines up beautifully
