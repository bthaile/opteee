0.00s: What is up, ape nation, into the outliers that are coming to hang out with the apes and
7.20s: the ape outliers and all the permutations thereof?
12.14s: We have a pretty cool session, hopefully, in store for today.
17.96s: I have a few things on the agenda, but I'm also hoping to pick your brain as kind of the
26.16s: chat in the audience.
28.08s: So that we can figure out other things that we want to go explore together, but I figured
32.60s: there's a few things on the top of my mind.
34.92s: The first thing is the 8K that was filed.
39.20s: I want to take a look at that.
41.56s: And I also want to run through kind of these different studies that I've been looking
47.72s: through.
48.72s: This is how I learn a lot about markets in general is I'll refer to like existing published
55.04s: studies that I can dive into their research, understand how they're looking at things.
61.24s: So we have a couple things on the docket.
63.28s: Some of these I've already read.
64.92s: Some of them I haven't and I'll make it super easy for us.
68.28s: We don't have to go through like these entire things.
70.92s: What I'll do is summarize some of what I learned from it up front, flip through some of
74.92s: the interesting spots with you.
76.88s: And then I can always throw it into chat GPT if you have any specific questions that we
80.68s: want to dive into.
81.68s: But this is a lot of bedrock behind like what makes GameStop special because that's what
90.24s: this boils down to is every time that I'm analyzing different elements of GameStop,
95.84s: it continues.
96.84s: I say it all the time, but like it continues to shock me as an anomaly.
102.32s: There's so many things about the stock that buck normal trends and as a lifelong trader,
109.32s: I cannot help but find stuff like that just truly, truly fascinating.
114.92s: There's so many things about it that every time I think I'm generally understanding or
120.88s: that this that or the other piece kind of finally line up and I'll find something new.
127.80s: And the other thing about GameStop that I enjoy a lot is it's teaching me a lot about
134.28s: market structure that again, even from a pretty longstanding trader standpoint, a practitioner
140.24s: standpoint, I didn't know all these different details because it's never really impacted
146.08s: the majority of what I was doing as a trader.
148.60s: So this thing is just so cool to me and I love these sessions and kind of working through
154.24s: learning more about it from two different perspectives, from the general interest perspective
158.72s: for GameStop, the story, the community, that stuff in it itself is always a blast.
163.88s: But then also from a trading perspective because this is a really, really, really tradable
169.04s: series of events, which we'll talk about as well.
172.08s: So I am happy as you could tell to be here with you all and to start getting into detail.
179.12s: So I figure we can start with a quick recap about GameStop, kind of just what it's done
184.20s: since the last week we've spoke.
186.40s: Then I thought we can take a look at any pertinent GameStop news that's popped up.
190.64s: Obviously some of them have already been covered ad nauseam throughout the week and our
194.24s: boy Newton.
195.24s: I was just texting with him.
196.48s: He has a bunch of research that he's doing now regarding slightly different effects.
203.64s: And so I thought we could do a quick recap just on some general news.
207.52s: And then I can talk to you about some of the research that I'm doing.
210.64s: And then yeah, whatever else you think would be fun to take a look at.
213.76s: That's part of the greatest part of these sessions for me is that the chat always throws
217.56s: out a lot of like really fun things to go explore.
221.04s: So I'm looking forward to that.
222.20s: All right, let me grab the chat now so that I can monitor it and keep up with you all
230.16s: as we move along.
231.16s: So it looks like we have PFA.
234.36s: We got Reese, Elon songs, H. Willie, Joe Tato.
237.68s: That's a super fun name.
239.24s: Tanner Steve, Willie, threshold solutions.
242.88s: Sne, I don't want to mess this up.
245.24s: Sne-hill, Sne-hill.
246.24s: I think that's right.
247.60s: Sne-hill, Vaja, Seddrick, we got the gang in town.
251.88s: We're ready to rock and roll.
253.40s: All right.
254.72s: So Steve says anything about the cat system.
258.28s: Yeah.
259.28s: So the cat system is really, really curious to me.
264.16s: The Cliff Notes version is, well, the disclaimer, I should say upfront, is that I upfront
271.36s: do not have a good foundation for it yet.
275.16s: I've started looking through it kind of in a cursory manner to get familiar with it
279.40s: to understand it a little bit better.
281.36s: But I'm not, like it's not jumping out of me yet.
284.48s: So I just throw that out for general consumption because I'm happy to explore it with you now.
289.12s: But again, I will always flag the things that I'm confident in and the things that I don't
294.36s: know about because I really don't want to mislead anybody and send them down the wrong
298.40s: path.
299.40s: So let's do some homework on that.
306.16s: I'm just taking a note here so that we can run through it in a little bit.
313.52s: And then if you have any interesting articles or if you have any posts or anything like
319.48s: that that you think we should take a look at, let me know because essentially what I know
325.20s: is I have this up for us to look through.
330.76s: But I haven't, yeah, so I haven't gone through like it in mass depth yet.
338.40s: So we'll add this to our list.
340.08s: I have a list for us.
341.08s: We'll move that over there.
342.56s: All right, cool.
343.56s: Thanks for that idea.
344.56s: All right, let's start now though with GME and the first thing that we have to talk
353.84s: about, the easiest thing is starting with a quick look at the chart.
357.12s: And I always emphasize this point.
360.96s: GameStop does not behave by the rules with respects to charts.
364.04s: I know people will say, because I've had people say it to me before like, oh yes, this
368.76s: person has been kind of spot on all the time or whatever the case is.
374.72s: And the fact of the matter is is I've already regressed most of the common trading tools
380.12s: that most traders use.
382.72s: And it does not corroborate that.
385.16s: So the thing with something like GameStop that I've learned is that it does have elements
393.04s: that will follow what we would consider to be more standard technical analysis components
400.08s: that is unequivocally true.
402.52s: But what I find specifically with GameStop is that those will exist until they don't
410.12s: exist.
411.92s: And that to me is kind of worth things get interesting because it's not as simple
417.28s: as just apply technical analysis because there isn't really a bucket of technical analysis
424.92s: that would indicate a lot of what we see GameStop doing until again, it does whatever it
432.08s: does.
433.24s: So I just bring that as a general point because I think it's worth at least, at least
440.68s: identifying.
441.68s: I will continue to conduct technical analysis on GameStop because I think that it's logical
447.04s: and I think that it makes sense to at least consider it.
450.08s: And it will, in my opinion, follow that rule set to a degree, but it will follow the
454.84s: rule set until it doesn't, which makes something like technical analysis really tricky to work
462.52s: with.
463.52s: So just a general admin note.
466.08s: Now one of the things that I, we researched this a bit last time and I think it's worth
471.56s: reiterating, honestly, as many times as we possibly can, one of the things that I have
477.20s: found continually with GameStop is specifically volume is involved in every move.
487.92s: I know what a revelation, right?
490.20s: Like the sky is blue.
491.92s: Got it.
492.92s: Yeah, we all know that.
494.56s: But I don't think we pay enough respect with respect to GameStop because we spend a
500.20s: lot of time exploring all these other different kinds of potential signals as we should, one
506.92s: because they're interesting too, because there could be a pretty strong signal there.
511.32s: But that aside, I think it's kind of important to expand a little bit beyond that and to try
520.16s: to figure out like tradable signals, right?
523.80s: And every time I see any sort of movement in GameStop, there's an expansion in volume
529.84s: that precedes the move, right?
532.60s: I think it was in the last stream that I was talking about in expansion and volume around
536.28s: here.
537.28s: And they're like, yeah, great dude, you just identified that volume expanded on the
540.76s: day stuff was going on.
542.44s: But then what I try to highlight to people in that conversation was actually if you look
546.88s: back even before this move, volume started to expand bigger than its average even before
553.44s: this move.
555.20s: So no, it's not this volume.
557.08s: Obviously, it's not going to be crazy off the Richter scale, but there are still signs.
562.20s: And what I want you to do is take a look at the volume around these different peaks that
569.28s: we see at different points in time and then take a look at the volume here, most recently.
575.32s: This isn't crazy big volume, but this volume here is not all too dissimilar to the volume
581.40s: that we saw here.
583.28s: Now this volume ended up leading into this trowel.
586.72s: So again, just because there's volume doesn't mean it's going up.
590.80s: We don't know exactly what it means.
593.36s: But you'll also notice almost always the volume is going to be wrapped around an earnings
598.68s: event in some capacity.
600.12s: This is common for equities.
601.56s: Again, there's always exceptions to the rule.
603.80s: I don't see some sort of mass of volume spike around this one, but I see it here, here,
608.76s: I see it here still, I see it here, and I see it here.
613.00s: So volume around earnings is going to be something that's part of this puzzle, and it honestly
618.20s: confounds the puzzle a little bit.
620.56s: Because then you kind of have to assess like, okay, well, is it this kind of volume where
625.04s: we had this volume before earnings last time?
629.08s: And then after earnings, it started to take Peter off.
633.64s: Like, it could be that I don't know yet.
637.28s: But what I do know is this volume here is massive compared to the recent volume.
644.92s: And again, it's all contextual because when we look at these volume spikes, we might
649.72s: again, look at this and be like, oh, shit, well, it's only 15 million.
653.72s: And if you look at this over here, it was 279 million.
658.20s: That's not the point.
659.20s: We're missing the point there.
660.36s: What I'm talking about, oh, sorry, what I'm talking about is a relative volume.
665.04s: So if we look in this period before this jump up here, the volume on average was like
671.52s: two and a half million to five million on a five day to 20 day period.
676.48s: It was much lower.
678.28s: And then all of a sudden, you'll see it start blowing up.
682.40s: So it's when we're analyzing anything, but specifically volume in something like this,
688.00s: we have to pay attention to the conditions around it.
691.24s: And not just grossly compare it to this because we know what's going on here.
696.32s: This is in the middle of a fucking squeeze where people are trying to avoid getting their
700.24s: heads ripped off.
701.76s: So they're going and buying everything that they can.
703.80s: And this is before we had the at the market.
706.32s: So there is a ton, a ton of different conditions going on.
710.36s: So the thing I cautioned and this is exactly why you'll notice on my charts, I have these
716.04s: volume averages because it helps me contextualize what I'm looking at.
721.20s: So if you look in this space right here, I don't know how clear it is.
725.24s: I'll read it out to you.
726.96s: But if I go back to the 27th of August, I'm just kind of picking a day here.
733.24s: The volume for the 27th of August was 4.1 million shares.
738.44s: And the average volume was 5.5 million for 20 days, trailing 20 days.
744.08s: And then the average volume for five days, trailing five days was 3.9 million.
748.64s: Okay.
751.24s: If we go to the 29th, volume is now 10 million, 10 million, raw volume right out of the
758.54s: gate over doubled on this day.
762.92s: And the five day average now moves up to down actually to 5.4 million.
768.60s: And the five day average now moves up because of this to 5.7 million.
772.84s: So this is still double the previous volume on a raw basis.
776.84s: And it's double the averages.
779.76s: And we have another day of really high volume, the 30th volume now expands to 15.7 million
788.36s: shares.
789.92s: The 20 day average had moved up to 5.7 because of the previous day.
794.36s: And then the five day average, which is going to be more sensitive to recent volume is
797.46s: all the way up to eight.
798.48s: It's still essentially double that.
802.12s: So this kind of scaling volume is fascinating to me.
807.16s: Now the other thing that again, I approach markets in this, based on my background, right?
812.80s: Like my undergrad and graduate degree are based around statistics.
815.88s: It's the way I look at the world.
818.04s: And when I look at these things, I'm like, okay, cool.
821.08s: I'm seeing volume starting to grow interesting.
826.12s: And I got alerts on both of these days.
828.52s: I obviously, I look at GameStop every day for those recap videos that I've been doing
831.84s: for us.
832.84s: But I also still get the alerts for these things.
836.88s: So now, I'm like, okay, volume essentially has gone from 5 million to 15 over a two
845.24s: day period.
847.28s: And earnings is still not yet.
851.08s: So what I like to do then is say, okay, let's take a look at a historic standpoint where
856.24s: volume tripled into earnings and how close was it into earnings.
861.56s: And if we go back to this, I'm hovering so that you can see if you follow this over
867.48s: here, which just shows the volume for today, I want you to see something volume here,
873.68s: which was the 26th of March on earnings was 17 million.
877.84s: Now if I go back one to two days, volume drops to 4 million.
884.28s: And then if I keep going back, I see 3.9, 3.8, 3.4, 4.4, 2.8, 2.3, 2.1, 3.1, 2.1, 3.8, 3.1,
894.20s: 4.3.
895.44s: What I'm highlighting to you is going back pretty far from this earnings release.
901.28s: Volume did not expand.
904.64s: Here we are still a week out from earnings in volume is expanding.
911.88s: That's not what happened here.
914.12s: What happened in this case is earnings was on the 26th, I can identify volume growing
919.88s: on the 25th.
921.48s: But as soon as you go outside of the 25th to the 22nd and previous, volume has not tripled
927.68s: the same way that we're seeing here.
930.40s: So that's why I say this volume expansion reminds me far more of what I see here than
938.08s: what I see here.
940.64s: Because here I can clearly identify volume is expanding for earnings.
947.00s: There is day.
948.00s: It's the day before earnings, it's the day of earnings, it's the day after earnings,
952.72s: and then it slowly tailors back down.
955.56s: Very normal earnings volume cycle.
958.40s: That's not the case for this because we're still ways out from earnings, which is on
964.64s: the 10th.
966.24s: That's still.
967.76s: It's not even next week.
969.28s: It's the following week.
971.44s: So we have a ways to go again, temporally, not super far, but for this volume to triple,
977.88s: I find that very, very interesting.
981.68s: So what I want to do actually with you all is I want to do a little bit of a study.
987.32s: I haven't done it yet.
988.32s: I can do it now as we're talking.
990.64s: And what I'm going to do is again, I'm going to go to bar chart because I have an account
997.56s: with them.
998.64s: I'm going to go to the story data here.
1006.64s: And I'm going to grab daily game stop data.
1011.00s: Again, going back to 2000.
1012.76s: And again, I know I don't think game stop even goes back that far.
1016.24s: But I just use the default date window that's generally all encompassing.
1020.04s: The reason why I'm re-downloading this data is so that it's essentially raw.
1028.32s: So I have that now and we can take a look at a few things.
1032.92s: I'm going to add a filter here and now we can take a look through together.
1041.60s: Let me squish this down.
1043.76s: And also I need to correct myself because last time I did this with chat GPT and somebody
1050.80s: noted in the comments that what I talked about in the live stream was wrong and I looked
1055.08s: back at it and it was completely wrong.
1058.04s: So I ran it through chat GPT and I was talking to you guys about it on the last live stream
1062.56s: about volume expansion and it was not accurate.
1064.88s: I have to call myself out because again, I don't want to give you guys bad information.
1068.92s: It surprised me because it's a really simple ask that I had of chat GPT when I provided
1073.48s: the source file.
1076.88s: But it was still wrong.
1078.60s: So I have to correct that.
1081.88s: And then also I have to take some drugs now because the old sciatica is still going.
1090.00s: Rock on for that.
1094.20s: And the drink of choice is, as you already know, mango orange spin drift.
1100.44s: That's the way to do it.
1104.20s: So yeah, let's take a look here.
1107.32s: What I want to do is simply look at a day over day change in volume day over day, day
1114.56s: over day volume delta.
1122.16s: And then I'm literally just going to figure out as a percentage.
1127.64s: So this minus this divided by this will turn this into a percent.
1135.52s: I got a wideness out a little bit so I can see my tools easier.
1138.88s: We want a percent.
1140.92s: And I typically like two decimals and then we'll drag that all the way down.
1147.52s: And then I'm going to filter this again.
1151.76s: I have to widen this out so that all my ship pops up.
1155.76s: Okay.
1156.76s: Data will add that filter.
1161.16s: So what I want to do now is not that.
1165.24s: What I want to do now is simply look at periods where volume moved greater.
1172.00s: Let's call it greater than 50%.
1175.52s: So we can do greater than.
1180.76s: And we'll do an or so we'll do greater than or less than.
1190.60s: And we'll do greater than 50% and then we will do negative 50%.
1200.84s: So now what I'm doing is just seeing how frequently this happens again.
1206.64s: And this is going back to the origin of GameStop.
1210.20s: So there's 1391 instances.
1214.36s: So it's too much for us to reasonably look through again on the livestream.
1217.92s: So I don't want to waste a bunch of your time.
1219.80s: So shout out to the apes.
1221.12s: There's over a hundred of us hanging out right now learning about GameStop.
1224.60s: So shout out to you guys.
1226.00s: I literally can't think of a better way to spend Saturday afternoon slash evening, then
1232.36s: diving into this stuff.
1233.36s: It's actually kind of fun.
1234.56s: It's one of the really cool things about the internet because if you think about it,
1239.28s: like there's not that many people at least around my immediate social circle that are
1243.52s: super interested in this stuff.
1245.20s: All my friends or Marines who I love to death, I take a bullet for them, but they're
1250.76s: not so interested in talking about this.
1253.24s: So the ability to connect with people literally all over the world.
1257.00s: Actually, I'm curious for those that are in the chat now, where are you from?
1261.84s: That's typically that's kind of like a fun exercise because I found in a few instances
1265.44s: where people are from way different places than I would have expected.
1270.44s: We got Michigan, California.
1272.72s: Hey, I'm in California.
1274.48s: Ohio, Jersey, the city, PEI, I don't know PEI.
1279.88s: Indiana, North Carolina, Pacific Northwest.
1282.60s: Is that like Seattle?
1284.52s: Kentucky, the city.
1287.32s: I have a buddy that lives in Long Island City for B Williams.
1292.88s: Pennsylvania, my uncle, he lives by Matt Amores, Pennsylvania.
1296.08s: We got Belgium.
1298.04s: Utah.
1299.04s: Hey, we were looking, Roy and Clity, what up?
1302.80s: Utah.
1304.36s: We were not, we were looking at Utah.
1306.96s: Rubin from Norway.
1308.12s: I was literally, literally just in Norway.
1310.92s: That was my last trip.
1312.88s: Korea, Vegas.
1314.76s: Look, like this is the cool part, man.
1317.36s: Like people from all over the freaking place.
1320.60s: Vegas, Alberta, a Wahoo, my in-laws, they have a place on Kauai.
1326.88s: So we go to Kauai pretty regularly.
1330.60s: Fuck it.
1332.36s: Lost in translation.
1333.56s: That's such a great name for being from, fuck it.
1336.60s: Scotland, Connecticut.
1339.96s: Yeah, it's incredible.
1341.32s: Maryland by DC.
1342.76s: Yo, there's another person from the Pacific Northwest for whoever said that before.
1347.84s: H is also from there.
1349.72s: Black swans from Ottawa.
1351.72s: AT says they live near Matt Amores.
1353.28s: That's hilarious.
1354.12s: Yeah, that's literally like my uncle and I whenever I go back to New York, we'll go walk.
1359.96s: What is it?
1360.80s: Ding ding ding ding min's falls or something like that?
1364.88s: I think that's what it is.
1366.68s: I could tell you the one second.
1368.44s: I could tell you the general region that he lives around.
1372.36s: I'm just curious how close you are because it's hilarious.
1377.28s: Um so he lives by what is this region?
1384.28s: That's where we're going.
1391.28s: Yeah, so he's by.
1394.28s: Yeah, so he's by Ding min's very gold key lake.
1397.28s: Yeah, AT that's yeah, that's exactly where he's around.
1401.28s: That's hilarious.
1403.28s: Whoa, Rebel Darkside.
1404.28s: I'm in San Diego dog.
1406.28s: Where and Clity says, what were you looking at Utah for?
1409.28s: Moving.
1410.28s: Yeah, my wife and I were looking at potentially bouncing out of San Diego in the near term,
1415.84s: at least somewhat semi near term, like maybe next two, three years.
1419.20s: So we were looking at Reno.
1420.76s: We were looking at Utah and we were looking at Colorado.
1423.96s: Those are the three leaders so far.
1426.88s: Ricky says Salt Lake City's a dope city.
1428.52s: Yeah, Salt Lake City was cool.
1429.48s: I don't like living in cities personally.
1430.92s: It was going to be like in the suburbs on the outside.
1433.88s: If if that's where we do end up, but yeah, Sean's in Florida, that's super cool.
1439.88s: Sean says what part of Colorado?
1441.88s: Yeah, so for Colorado, we were looking at outside of Denver.
1447.56s: So everywhere from Fort Collins down south to Colorado Springs.
1452.48s: So right now leaning towards Colorado Springs, I think.
1456.44s: Vladimir says Reno, yeah, yeah, Reno, Nevada.
1459.80s: Willie says what made you reconsider California?
1463.40s: It's just because there's a lot of things about the state that don't resonate with me.
1467.68s: I really like cars and I have like a built Corvette C7 that is, I have to play all these
1473.52s: different games because they have really strict regulations on what you can do to your cars.
1478.00s: I like shooting a lot.
1479.36s: Like obviously from my background, but even from growing up, it's like difficult to go
1483.12s: shooting here.
1484.12s: So one of my plans is wherever I move, I'm going to buy a little bit of property that I can set
1487.92s: up a shooting range.
1489.68s: It's just all those little kind of things like that.
1493.04s: So yeah, it's it's a little bit of a break.
1496.32s: The funny part is is like most people think that San Diego has like the nicest weather on
1500.40s: earth and it has beautiful weather.
1502.68s: But the funny part is is like if you'll notice the places I tend to go on vacation, like
1507.64s: the last trip was to Norway, the trip to before that was to Iceland.
1512.48s: Like I'm not going for, I don't really care for the weather.
1515.88s: I don't like it.
1516.88s: It's on a sun.
1517.88s: I don't mind the sun obviously, but I don't like it hot.
1520.12s: I am very much Nordic in descent.
1523.20s: So yeah, it's not not my vibe.
1527.64s: Vladimir says in the Vodans that speeding tickets, they give you an access of use of fuel citation.
1533.76s: That's hilarious.
1534.76s: If that's actually a thing, that is hilarious.
1538.20s: Ben says an old company used to book me flights from Colorado Springs to Denver and maybe
1542.12s: look like a super wealthy person because private flight, but it was just because company
1545.80s: dumped that's so funny.
1547.00s: Yeah, because those two are pretty close together from what I've seen.
1550.00s: I've been to Denver.
1551.28s: I haven't spent much time around Colorado Springs yet.
1554.92s: We're actually going to do like a remote week there sometime to get a vibe check and see
1561.96s: if we like it.
1562.96s: So yeah, the cool part and the point of this exercise, if you take a look through this,
1568.52s: like we have people literally from all over.
1571.76s: Gregor says where's Newton?
1572.96s: I think he's chilling with his fam right now.
1575.56s: Yeah.
1576.72s: So Newton is, he and I have been talking, I'm not sure when we'll be able to line up on
1581.72s: a live stream together.
1583.28s: It's still something that we both are interested in, but he's kicking off a new schedule with
1587.88s: work and stuff and it's just a lot for him because he still wants to do his daily videos.
1593.80s: And then to and his daily videos are not short.
1596.16s: They're like 20, 30 minutes.
1599.08s: And then his job is kicked off again and then he has the family.
1602.36s: So the times like now when he and I would be linking up, it's kind of time away from
1607.24s: his family.
1608.56s: So I think that we are going to try to find a point at some point that lines up again.
1616.36s: But yeah, right now he and I are primarily just communicating via text, keeping up with
1621.92s: one another.
1622.92s: But yeah, I try to, I try to make it flexible for him, but I mean, the dude is busy and
1628.84s: I totally, totally understand.
1630.40s: I'm fortunate that I have a pretty flexible schedule, but I totally respect that he's got
1637.36s: a lot going on.
1639.04s: So yeah, he and I still talk were obviously sharing ideas and kind of exploring things together.
1645.16s: We were literally just talking about a couple new thesis and some of the research that I'm
1648.24s: doing that I'm going to talk to you about.
1649.56s: I don't know why I keep hitting the mic.
1651.12s: Sorry about that.
1653.40s: But yeah, he, he's just been busy.
1658.84s: Rebel Darksides, I think Newton lives in San Diego also he doesn't, he's further north.
1667.28s: Mia says, what's your take on option alpha or any auto trading platforms have you dug
1671.04s: into it?
1672.04s: Yeah, so I actually did an interview with Kirk not too long ago.
1674.32s: I had him on my podcast and it's nothing I do.
1678.08s: So I can't speak intelligently to it is to like whether or not it's efficacious or not.
1682.68s: I could see it being useful for some people, but it's definitely not, it's not for me.
1688.92s: It's the way I would look at it.
1691.24s: Okay, so what I want to do now is actually create a little bit of a distribution here.
1697.20s: So I'll do like count of percent ranges.
1704.80s: And then I'm going to do count if we'll count these.
1711.24s: And what do we want to do?
1712.24s: Do we want to do it like?
1717.32s: Let's do like greater than 100% to start.
1721.16s: Let's see if this works.
1722.96s: Oops.
1723.96s: My bad.
1730.76s: So 455.
1735.28s: And then let's do.
1748.08s: So that's actually interesting.
1752.72s: So there's way more.
1753.72s: I mean, I honestly think we can just filter this then by 100%.
1758.64s: Get rid of the so we'll do one or less than one.
1766.40s: And let's count these.
1770.12s: So 455 up.
1771.20s: So that lines up as expected.
1774.72s: So now this is kind of a more palatable figure.
1778.04s: So now what I would do is actually sort this by largest to smallest.
1785.56s: I'm going to get rid of the negative integers for now just because I don't care.
1790.92s: So I'm just going to do greater than 100 only.
1797.04s: I'll count these.
1800.08s: That is 365.
1802.08s: So funny enough out of that 455 that were greater than 100.
1805.16s: The vast majority of them were positive anyways.
1808.80s: And now let's sort this.
1812.32s: I don't know why it's doing that with the sorting kind of annoying.
1824.32s: It's not letting me sort on top of it, which makes me angry.
1830.92s: Maybe we can sort by date.
1836.12s: And still it, why is it keep doing that?
1840.76s: Up that right now.
1843.44s: Oh, because it's up.
1845.32s: God, I hate myself sometimes.
1849.04s: Oh, no, it's still doing it right.
1855.00s: Yeah, it's still doing it completely right.
1862.76s: Interesting.
1863.32s: Anyways, so let's just take a look through these.
1867.40s: And let's find some of the higher figures like this.
1875.88s: We're like this.
1877.88s: This was in 2023.
1879.44s: Did anything interesting happen in 2023 in here?
1882.52s: Take a look.
1885.56s: I think what I need is, do you guys know where I can get like a historic chart
1892.96s: that lets me look at the chart?
1895.32s: Well, I guess I could just use on demand never mind.
1897.40s: We'll see if it works.
1899.68s: There's always a big question.
1905.20s: I just want to see what this period looks like.
1907.64s: It was in 2023.
1909.96s: That saw a massive is the 29th of November in 2023.
1915.40s: So I want to take a quick look at that.
1919.12s: The 29th of November.
1924.96s: Yeah, big pop, which is interesting,
1928.72s: because this one looks like a bit of a standalone if I'm not mistaken.
1939.28s: Tanner says 2023 had October, November,
1942.56s: March, volume, but besides that, nothing.
1944.48s: Yeah, which is fascinating, right?
1946.44s: Because I can see this September volume that's starting to kick off,
1951.12s: but I can't tell what it's from.
1952.88s: I'm going to fast forward to December just so I can see the period around it.
1956.80s: Oh, earnings.
1958.68s: There it is.
1960.16s: So this had earnings on the sixth,
1963.84s: and volume started to expand on the 28th.
1966.68s: So still, this is not an example of what we're seeing right now,
1973.92s: which is really interesting.
1976.84s: Which is really, really interesting.
1979.00s: So as I'm kind of just, you know, quickly glossing over this,
1982.84s: there's what I'm doing right now has zero statistical efficacy or rigor.
1987.44s: I'm just kind of spot checking a couple of random things real fast.
1991.28s: Just because like for me to actually do this process, it takes a while.
1994.68s: And I have some of it done in Tableau already,
1997.72s: but I haven't finished overlaying some of the other data points
2001.76s: that I'm really interested in.
2002.84s: Things like the FTD cycles or things like not FTDs.
2013.92s: What else am I swaps?
2016.12s: That's it.
2017.12s: Sorry.
2018.12s: Had a bit of a brain sees there or the swaps.
2020.92s: So it's just not done yet.
2023.00s: But so what I'm looking at though are different periods where volume essentially is expanded
2030.04s: meaningfully over the previous day.
2033.12s: And I'm looking for periods where it is at least greater than 100%.
2041.12s: And what I'm able to identify by this are other instances where we're seeing
2047.40s: at least somewhat similar price movement to what we're seeing now and what it's predicated on.
2052.64s: So if I take a look at another period,
2056.04s: I can bring this back over so you can see what I'm doing.
2058.52s: So I'm just picking random periods.
2060.44s: So like this one here, I want to see if this is where earnings was.
2065.12s: So instead of going in on demand yet,
2067.16s: I'm going to focus on finding periods where it's not earnings in close proximity.
2074.20s: All of the other earnings markers there we go.
2076.52s: Okay, so we have seven June, like these definitely, this is definitely something.
2083.48s: I see.
2087.08s: I mean, that's just interesting.
2089.88s: Look at this.
2091.72s: Just from a volume perspective.
2094.12s: Seven June, seven July, eight August.
2099.64s: That's a really tight range over a three day period or three month period.
2105.24s: Consistently with really high volumes.
2108.28s: So this tells me this isn't earnings, right?
2110.12s: Because earnings doesn't happen that many times in such a consolidated period.
2114.12s: So these periods here are now just interesting to me.
2117.96s: I want to know what is going on here.
2121.80s: So we'll go back.
2123.40s: Let's start with eight, eight, 22.
2127.48s: And the whole idea behind this just so that you understand why I'm doing this.
2130.76s: The whole goal here is again, this is me fingerprinting.
2134.44s: I'm getting a series of reference periods
2137.64s: so that I can better understand the price and volume movement that we're seeing right now
2142.68s: relative to this move.
2143.88s: It's exactly why I'm doing this.
2145.96s: So what I'm going to do now is go back into on demand and we're going to go back to 2022.
2152.36s: And we will start in August, eighth.
2157.96s: And then we know for the previous three months that there is pretty significant movements.
2163.88s: And again, this starts to make more sense now.
2167.56s: So when I look at the split, this is normal.
2175.32s: This would typically spur some sort of movement.
2180.20s: This right here looks completely random to me.
2184.76s: So from the sixth volume was at 9.9.
2194.12s: And then on the seventh, it goes to 30.
2198.28s: Why?
2204.12s: I don't understand why that happened there.
2207.40s: That seems random to me.
2211.00s: The movement that I see in May is way more logical because I can see that that's tied to earnings.
2219.56s: Ruben says the Ranger describing with volume is something new and others have gone into
2229.56s: your correctness to earnings.
2232.52s: Yeah, so but maybe you can help me out here, Ruben.
2236.04s: Vladimir off Putin says can't read the dates.
2238.60s: So right now I'm looking at 2022.
2241.16s: So right now the chart is set to be August, eighth, 2022.
2246.84s: And then all I'm doing is looking back at these reference periods.
2251.96s: Right? So the 888-7767 because like that's something.
2257.40s: I don't know what it is, but it's something.
2259.40s: The fact that that is such a regimented cadence for volume to happen to expand month over month
2266.44s: around the same exact time frame. So for example, when I'm looking at this,
2271.48s: this is where I start thinking something about swaps.
2274.68s: However, the problem with the swaps at least so far from what I've researched in GameStop is
2280.60s: what I try to tell people is when I'm looking at things from a statistical standpoint,
2286.20s: I'm not trying to look for what I'm looking for.
2289.08s: I'm simply trying to analyze and see what comes up.
2292.68s: So what that means is when I grabbed the swap data that I could for GameStop,
2297.32s: which took me back into 2022, rather than trying to see
2302.12s: what count period aligns with stock movements and swap expirations, it was essentially
2311.24s: inconclusive. There's some levels of correlation in some instances, but it doesn't pass any
2316.44s: t-test. There's no confidence interval I can assign to it and say like, yeah,
2320.68s: this is reasonably presumative or a reasonable signal for some sort of stock movement,
2326.36s: because you also can't even fully isolate it.
2329.48s: So that's one of the issues that I see with swap. So in here, when I look at this 8-8 date,
2336.36s: I don't know why it's surging here. This doesn't fully make sense to me.
2340.60s: When I look at 7-7, I don't understand this either, because typically, when I see this split,
2348.52s: when did this split happen? The 22nd. And there's not a meaningful movement of volume
2357.88s: around the split. So I can't attribute it to the split. I can't attribute it to an earnings
2365.64s: release here or here, because there wasn't one. Again, this move back in May or on the first of June,
2374.28s: I can attribute the preemptive move here to earnings. Volume started expanding on the 25th.
2380.68s: Earnings was what, five, six days later? That's fine. That's super, super normal.
2386.04s: Expecting a big movement in the underlying leading into earnings is completely normal.
2390.68s: Now, what's not normal are these movements. And I can't quite put my finger onto why these movements
2398.36s: are occurring. Tanner says, Eric, go scroll up. I have exact dates for you to check out. Check out
2407.56s: the volume spikes on those dates. Sure. Here we go. I'm going to copy Tanner's comment down here.
2420.84s: And we can take a look at these together. The issue with doing this, though, is that it's like,
2427.08s: we're form fitting what we're looking for. We're saying, I want to find this. So I'm not exactly
2434.36s: sure what we're hoping to find with these. But let's see. 223.21. So let me get rid of this filter.
2444.84s: I'm going to clear that, clear those. And then I'll sort it by date so I can find them.
2451.72s: And then let's go to 23 Feb 21.
2464.76s: So 23 Feb 21. I don't know why this is all fucked up. But 23 Feb 21 here shows a negative.
2478.52s: Oh no, I'm sorry. Yeah, it shows a volume drop over the previous day. It looks like it dropped
2483.80s: 61%. So I don't see. I don't see a specific or I don't see it's like a, let me know what I'm looking
2499.08s: for. I don't know what I'm supposed to, I don't know what I'm supposed to find. Or do you mean the 24th?
2503.64s: Because the 24th saw a big volume spike. The 24th volume spiked almost a thousand percent. So a big spike.
2517.56s: Yeah. So let's significant about the 24th in your opinion. Let's go there. Let's go. I'm looking
2526.52s: in 21, right? Yeah. Let's go to 21. And then let's go to February 20. I'm going to go a little
2532.12s: bit past it so that we can kind of see how it flows. Yeah, I mean, this is a squeeze to me.
2540.76s: Like that's exactly what this is here in my opinion. So if I were looking at this and trying to
2550.52s: identify the reason behind this kickoff and price movement, this is a squeeze. Yeah, that's exactly
2559.64s: what I see here for whatever reason, but that's what I see here. And again, like I try to identify
2565.48s: for you all, one of the really cool things about this and the use of volume is take a look.
2575.64s: Look at the volume here. The volume front runs the entire squeeze. You can see it run up here.
2585.80s: It contracts. And I also noticed this is pretty common for the larger moves and game stop,
2592.20s: at least from what I've seen so far is it looks like there's typically these two spikes.
2600.12s: Most of them, I see this pattern where there's a spike. It calms down and then typically within
2605.88s: like two weeks, three weeks, it starts another spike that then will typically calm back down,
2613.00s: which I can't help but find that interesting. Vladimiro off Putin, that's so funny.
2619.40s: Vladimiro off Putin says, remember that D.F.V. was still posting in February 2021. Let's take a look.
2623.40s: That would be also very interesting to see what kind of positions he had on around this point.
2631.08s: I have his age linked on my to do list. Here we go.
2638.60s: And then I can expand this.
2644.60s: So let's take a look. January, February, so this is interesting.
2656.44s: Oh, that's funny. So you used to post in Wall Street bets.
2658.76s: 22, 47, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1.
2677.64s: So what I'm doing now is I'm just getting a sense of these different posts.
2682.12s: And to see, because like you can see that he was hovering right around that one to three mill mark
2689.80s: for a long time. Right? 973, one. Anyways, going back up here.
2702.36s: We need to be in here.
2704.28s: Web 19th, Web 3rd, Web 2nd.
2721.48s: So this started like the end of Jan. Did he have anything there?
2727.08s: He did. Jan 28th. So let's see how far back he goes here.
2736.28s: 25th, 22, 19th. So the move really started on the 13th. Let's see how far back he goes.
2742.84s: 11th, the fifth.
2750.84s: Here.
2753.80s: December 31st here.
2756.68s: He this is fascinating because I obviously love this dude. I have a ton,
2763.72s: a ton of respect for him. But and I know that we like to say, you know, things like he's a
2770.28s: time traveler and stuff like that. I get it. It's like partially we're having fun.
2776.12s: But this here shows me that like the timing is not quite as perfect as I even thought it was.
2786.36s: And that's not I want to be so clear. I am not diminishing what he does or what he's done.
2793.32s: I'm just trying to be accurate in my assessment of the timing because otherwise,
2800.60s: I mentally started just assuming that his timing was perpetually perfect somehow.
2807.80s: And that leads me down a different cognitive thought process in terms of what signals
2813.48s: were using and how we're doing it. But the fact that the timing isn't quite as perfect as I was
2821.72s: mentally modeling, it tells me a few things exactly as Cedric is talking about. It seems like a
2828.84s: little bit more of an exploratory kind of thing. But it also tells me that there's not this
2836.36s: highly predictable thing that he's operating off of with pure accuracy.
2842.52s: Which again, it's just important for me to know that because it helps frame the rest of my research
2849.72s: knowing that to be generally the case because that is generally the case here.
2854.20s: Right? Like if he had some sort of, you know, if he had to hit some sort of like near perfect
2862.76s: methodology for entering an exiting, it would tell me a lot about the kind of triggers or signals
2869.64s: that he was using. So when I look at this though, I can see that he started entering even all the way
2876.60s: back on like mid-December. And if we go into December, there just isn't a whole lot going on here.
2884.68s: Price is moving, but it's not moving a ton. So what this tells me is that obviously he has his
2893.56s: pulse on something. He has the pulse of something. I don't know what that he clearly is looking at
2900.04s: because there is some sort of move that happens generally to poorly to where he's operating.
2907.00s: But it's not like this this perfect timing thing. And I also think that's really important for
2913.64s: us to think about as we're conducting our research. Because if we look at all the different
2918.76s: research that we're running right now, we're trying to identify essentially to this specific day
2926.60s: that something should or should not happen. And as I'm looking at this, I actually am starting
2933.24s: to change my opinion that rather than looking at a specific day that we think something should
2939.72s: or should not happen, that we should be looking at specific windows.
2945.72s: That starts to become a thought for me because otherwise,
2952.76s: the timing at least on those first initial plays would definitely be better. Again, I just want
2960.12s: to be so clear, I'm not saying the timing is bad, the trading is bad, nothing like that.
2964.76s: I'm just talking about in terms of if I had a really strong hypothesis that something was going
2971.88s: to happen on X date, right? Let's call it T30, 30 days from now. I wouldn't start building a position
2980.36s: this second. I would, even if it's a big position, I would wait a little bit longer until I get
2986.68s: closer to the effect that I'm trying to trade, right? It's like earnings. I know earnings has
2994.92s: certain behaviors as an options trader that I can take advantage of. Starting two weeks out,
3000.44s: implied volatility is going to start expanding into earnings. I know this.
3006.12s: Then I also know, after earnings, volatility is going to contract to a degree.
3013.64s: So, understanding that, volatility is going to contract through earnings. If earnings is on
3020.76s: the 15th of the month, I'm not going to put the position on the 15th of the previous month
3026.68s: for the earnings effect on the 15th of the following month. It doesn't make sense to me.
3031.88s: Now, conversely, if I'm looking at the run-up into earnings that two-week period,
3037.88s: that's not a perfect window. And it actually varies quite a bit. So, I might put that trade on
3044.04s: 20 days early. I might put it on 10 days early. I might put it on 14 days early, leading into earnings.
3051.40s: It's more of a window. So, part of me thinks that while we're conducting a lot of this research,
3059.64s: trying to pinpoint specific days, I actually think we might want to start looking at it in terms
3067.24s: of windows. Because again, I can see from this positioning in this time frame, whether or not that's
3074.84s: exactly what he was looking at that was going to cause this. I obviously don't know. But it tells me
3080.12s: that this isn't some hyper pinpoint accuracy system. This is something that's based on more of a
3086.68s: window that I find really, really interesting. So, I find that curious. And I find a lot of the work
3097.72s: we're doing to be interesting. But it tells me that I think we should probably start looking more
3105.64s: so at an X period window. Whether it's a five-day window, 10-day window, I'm not sure yet. I have to
3112.76s: do a little bit of digging on that. But we've been spending so much time trying to pinpoint,
3119.72s: okay, the swaps are coming due or the FTDs are coming due on this day. So then tomorrow,
3125.00s: we should see a big move. And it just typically doesn't pan out that way. But if we can start thinking
3131.88s: of it more so as based on these effects that are going on, it's likely to impact the market during
3138.60s: some period, some 10-day window. To me, that makes a lot of sense. Now, again, the interesting part
3146.36s: here is I know a lot of people are doing this and they want to be the person that gets it right,
3152.44s: or gets the specific day, or cracks the code, whatever it is. And that's cool. That's totally
3157.32s: fine to want to do. But as I look at it from a trading perspective, I actually don't really think
3163.64s: that that matters quite as much. And it probably leads most of us astray from a pretty
3175.96s: like a pretty tradable window, I think. Roin Cleedy says, it could be wrong, but it sounds like
3181.16s: you're assuming RK is making his plays off of these hidden cycles. That's also no, no, yeah,
3186.36s: I'm glad you called that out because that's not what I mean at all.
3191.16s: Because I have no idea what he's looking at. I genuinely don't. So yeah, thank you for calling
3196.60s: that out, Roin Cleedy. I don't want to make it sound like I think that he's looking at swaps
3200.44s: or FDDs or whatever. I have no idea. I have no idea. I'm just saying that he's looking at
3208.12s: something, some effect or some signal. That's what I believe. What it is, I genuinely don't know.
3215.56s: I really don't. But again, this tells me that it's not a hyper specific window that he's looking at.
3223.56s: I don't think. So the other thing I look at is like this looks generally around when he's,
3233.64s: you know, still staying active, the fifth, the 11th, the 13th, right? So he's just kind of
3240.20s: updating updating updating updating semi-regular cadence, 28th,
3252.92s: Bab, right? So like this is all persistent exposure if you think about it. So just about all of this,
3262.52s: all of this that I see here, it looks like just standard. He's maintaining exposure of some sort.
3268.04s: Yeah, because he has like the April 18th, 10 call, the April 18th. So what was going on in April 18th
3274.92s: of 21? Was that earnings? Let's fast forward this. I'll just go to the NMA.
3285.88s: No, not earnings.
3289.00s: So standard options expiration for April. I don't know why, I don't know why we picked that.
3305.48s: 16 April. Why do we pick that? When do we add those? Oh, shit, he added those away.
3318.84s: I'll go. They're all the way back here. January. They're all the way back here in 2020.
3327.88s: Okay, so this is just a persistent leverage position. That's what this tells me. So he's adding
3334.04s: these these longer dated calls here, right? Because these are for April and he put them back on in
3340.28s: 2020. Let's see how far back we go. Yeah, man, that's annoying. I'm just going to start from here.
3345.48s: Yeah, they were already on here. So in this case, all the way back in September. And again, this,
3353.08s: this to me aligns with more of the fingerprint I see of him when he trades options is that most of
3360.20s: the positions I've seen him put on as I go through his posts look like they're further out in time,
3365.32s: not always super far, but not like two days. Most of them are like a month of at least a few weeks,
3371.32s: a month away over a month in this case. So in this scenario, when I see that he's put on these
3380.12s: April calls all the way back at least in September, this is just a leveraged position, right? So
3386.12s: and you can tell that he likes to buy and round lots. That's super normal. But in this case,
3391.72s: he's essentially using all of his money, right? So we can see that he has some shares, 10,000 shares,
3398.28s: only $86,000 of his account are here. This is also very fascinating to me because from my understanding,
3407.08s: I think you guys explained to me that the community, I think it was Superstank or one of them that
3414.84s: was like really skeptical of options, right? Is that accurate? Because I think you guys,
3420.52s: I think you guys were telling me that like nobody wanted to hear anything about options that are
3424.36s: like there was some sort of problem if you talked about options. But okay, so yeah, it was Superstank,
3431.72s: got it. And I find this really interesting because obviously he literally has the bulk of his money
3442.36s: in options. This is quite literally how he created wealth like straight up. So because you can see
3452.20s: the total value of the portfolio here for the shares is $86,000. The total value of the
3458.68s: portfolio is 973 with 8K and cash. The rest of that is options. This is all options. He's trading,
3469.08s: he's trading this leveraged to the upside is what I see. And that's why he would have this kind of
3475.88s: exposure is simply for leverage. Like that's 100% what I see here, which is really interesting.
3486.52s: Yeah, man, he had those calls all the way back in August.
3498.28s: No precise target just up. Yep, that makes sense.
3501.40s: Yeah. So one of the most interesting things about this that the more I look at it, the more I
3511.40s: identify is that he is just so willing to take these hyper concentrated risk positions,
3522.52s: which is crazy.
3531.40s: Yeah, it's mostly options, man. Even back when he had a little baby account.
3541.00s: That's interesting. So he really did use options to essentially just his leverage alongside. That's
3547.56s: super interesting. Cedric says lots of people got burned over the years. Super stung said no more
3554.76s: options. Yeah, that's a bummer because you can kind of tell like as I was looking through this,
3559.16s: that's the bulk of what he did. I didn't know that. I literally would not have guessed that
3564.04s: based on what again, the way that the community has kind of taught me so far, I wouldn't have guessed
3571.08s: that the bulk of this is done through options.
3580.12s: So this is like literally I can tell even from this post is that he's just essentially staying
3585.96s: and staying directionally leveraged. And he's hyper concentrated in an individual position.
3596.36s: Yeah. Very interesting.
3607.96s: And he went through some really rough times because this account is oscillated quite a lot.
3615.40s: Okay.
3629.24s: It's been me diversifying across strikes. So this is super normal.
3636.52s: Yeah, right. This is so funny. So this highlights exactly what I kind of expected, right?
3644.68s: Is that this? He likes to be super concentrated. But in my opinion, such actions may have also
3650.92s: reduced my estimated return. So the dude is like laser focused on a thesis he believes in.
3656.52s: And it's like balls to the wall to the return. It's not like not really caring about the risk.
3662.76s: Like this, right? Like to make more money. He's keeping that super super simple.
3666.60s: Oh, hell yeah, here we go. Hold on. Where was that? I'm jacked to the tits. That's what I'm talking about.
3676.68s: We need some need some leverage here. Yeah. See, like look at this. 117,000. It's all over the place.
3689.56s: The industry of gaming. So he's still doing a lot of like background research on
3696.84s: what he thinks. Oh, man, this is fascinating. I've not gone back this far yet.
3709.96s: Is this the beginning? Yeah, it looks like the beginning.
3716.28s: 113,000. Wow, you look at this. He literally started with all
3726.68s: all options. There's not even any shares in here. This is all options.
3731.00s: Man, I didn't realize that I was talking to that I've been doing a bunch of research on a fellow
3736.36s: options. Homey. I thought straight up that he was a stock trader that kind of threw in some
3740.52s: options here and there. But my boy is an option trader. Oh, man. That makes me so happy. Look
3748.44s: at this. The first thing that I see here is it's literally all options. All of it. There's zero
3755.72s: shares. I love this. H says small sub folks would make nuts post. Oh, okay, something else.
3772.28s: Trying to see. Sedric says outlier been sleeping this whole time. What the fuck? Yeah. Like,
3777.80s: I mean, I'm straight up with you guys. I am I'm learning. I'm relatively new to this.
3783.96s: I've traded. I've traded GameStop during kind of several of the squeezes as it's popped up
3790.12s: on my scanners. But it's only in the last few months, maybe like two months, that I've like really
3798.20s: started digging into the background for this. So yeah, that's exactly why I'm still learning.
3805.88s: So yeah, it's said to your point, I don't know. Not only do I not know everything. I hardly know
3811.32s: anything about this. I am so very much in my infancy of learning. And a lot of the way that I've
3818.68s: been learning so far is just kind of like listening to people and the things that I've been researching
3823.56s: mostly to start have been kind of recent history of his plays to get a fingerprint forum. And to get
3831.80s: some ideas on like some of these different cycle theories and stuff like that. But yeah, I mean,
3837.80s: this is nuts. The fact that because I genuinely thought that his core positions would have been
3844.76s: stock. And then he was amplifying them with options. That's exactly what I generally was expecting.
3852.92s: And then that's just not exactly what I'm seeing here because really the primary teachers,
3857.88s: I lean on right now is Newton. He teaches me a lot of the background of GameStop and stuff like
3863.80s: that. And then when we go through these is when I'm learning a lot. So yeah, this is crazy. Very interesting.
3874.84s: J box town says, am I playing Siri options? Does Siri have options?
3879.24s: It does. Let me see. No, I'm not right now. It look good.
3898.44s: Yeah, there's a there's a ton. There's a ton of value in these like for something like this,
3904.36s: that's priced at 329. That's a wild amount of premium for something like that. That's crazy.
3917.72s: I got to get caught back up with the chat. Let me see.
3924.60s: Ricky says reach out to him for a podcast so you guys can keep out on options. I honestly,
3936.36s: as much as I would love to talk to him, I probably wouldn't want to do it on a podcast.
3941.16s: Like I would rather just do like a phone call or something, but he, it's clear that the
3948.92s: dude is kind of tired of being in front of things and he's, yeah, there's a reason why he's not
3956.76s: all over the place, right? He could be if he's so chose to, but he doesn't really care. So yeah,
3962.84s: it's funny is that would be I totally respected understand that he's just trying to, you know,
3968.44s: create a little bit of space.
3972.12s: Cedric says the first reason we thought it wouldn't crazy back in 2001 because Wall Street
3976.92s: Pets bought a lot of calls nonstop and brokers had to buy those shares, hedge, causing price
3981.72s: raise. Yeah, so just to be clear, that's not brokers that is market makers that would be doing that.
3988.44s: And yeah, that's definitely part of it, especially if it's a much lower float stock,
3994.60s: it will certainly display those kind of behaviors. So yeah, I think,
4001.40s: I think that's definitely part of the movement that you saw. And I also think that's part of the
4008.68s: reason why we tend to see this moving the way it's moving now is because of the at the market.
4014.52s: The way that the shares are going to behave in this kind of scenario is going to be slightly
4018.68s: different. Let me see. Chris says no GMME guys are playing Siri just FYI. That's one of the
4033.16s: tricky parts that starts to confuse me is like, I don't fully comprehend the different links that
4039.16s: get made, right? Because I know before people were like super, super skeptical of Chui,
4045.88s: but then obviously when the cat dropped his 13G or D, he obviously, he put a complete end to that
4055.64s: debate. So yeah, I find that interesting to see what products are kind of like greenlit to be
4062.76s: associated with GameStop and then what products are in because the other thing that I think you
4067.00s: guys have taught me is that there's overlap between the GMME community and the AMC community,
4074.60s: but they're not like the same. And there's a schism between them. I find that really, really interesting.
4089.88s: Of Vladimir, the Vladimir off Putin name is so funny. Vladimir off Putin says meme traders are
4096.52s: super tribal. Yeah, that makes sense. All right. Willie says, how do you guys explain the music
4108.52s: emojis on our case post them? Dogstock turned out to be validated. I'm actually really curious
4113.40s: to be honest. Like I love looking at the emojis and kind of hearing the different theories on it,
4119.32s: but my opinion is that people are, I think people are reading into them way further than intended.
4126.52s: That's my genuine guess. I also think the cat knows at this point that anything that he posts
4132.20s: like that based on the community, because I'm sure he watches the community and the response.
4136.28s: I think he knows that when he posts stuff like that, it's going to send people into, you know,
4141.32s: in a bish of research and theories and stuff like that. And I don't know, maybe he just enjoys that
4147.48s: is like a general game to see maybe who gets it. But yeah, I find, I do find that part kind of
4153.40s: interesting because when I look at the general flow of what he's sharing and stuff, like I do
4162.60s: feel like people read into them a little bit further than he was intending. And the reason why I
4168.36s: think that is because this exact thing, I keep sharing the clip because I think it's important.
4172.60s: But there is the clip from Cohen when he was on that podcast. And he was, I'll just share it
4181.00s: again, because it's it's worthwhile enough, I think. But a lot of you will probably already know what
4185.16s: I'm talking about. Oh, and podcast. I keep forgetting I can't do Cohen. I have to do
4197.24s: here. Okay. And then I will share the audio. And then I have to find the spot. Yeah, here.
4211.16s: All right. And then just listen for a second.
4214.76s: I'm 10 Virginia. It's a photo of you in a game stop store.
4218.76s: Can you guys hear that? Does that come through? Okay.
4227.08s: Okay. Cool. Thank you. Hot nitrogen. That's hilarious.
4230.52s: Turn it up a tiny bit. Yeah. Can do.
4232.76s: One second. I'll just take it to like negative two decibels so that it's not like super loud.
4242.76s: All right. Here we go. May 12, 2021. Is that what you do? I don't know.
4249.56s: Sorry. So here he's just talking about like going in and checking out a game stop. But there's
4254.28s: a specific spot in here that I want you to hear. I'm always seeing what the inventory.
4258.92s: You don't get recognized when I wrote about this on our website. I noted what was in your hand.
4264.76s: And we spent a lot of time trying to figure out we thought it was a scooter, an electric scooter.
4269.64s: Yes, it was. Do you do that? All right. All right. That's fair. So we got that one right.
4274.76s: At the way the games were see-look. Here you go. So this is the exact spot I want you to listen to.
4282.36s: Every detail matters. Yeah. Of course. People were looking at the way the games were set up on the
4287.24s: rack. People thought maybe there was a message there. Yeah. There wasn't one, right? No message in
4293.64s: the games? I didn't. I mean, no, there wasn't. No. Right. So that's the point. I'm trying to share
4303.40s: is like the community, whenever you put a group of people together that are really investigative
4310.12s: and very capable, we look into everything and we can go really, really far into things. And again,
4318.28s: like even beyond what's intended. So in this case, you know, he first started with obviously the
4324.52s: theory behind what's in his hand, right? And then they were talking about the, you know, the games
4330.44s: if there was a hidden meeting in the games and he was just like, no, there's not a message.
4336.76s: But you can just imagine the number of conversations that would have happened about the
4343.16s: configuration of those games and what it might have meant. So maybe there was, maybe there was.
4349.00s: And I still don't know. He could have been joking there. I don't think so. Again, I take him at face
4352.52s: value. But I just think it's important to identify that because then when I see people going through
4358.68s: these memes from Rory and Kitty and like trying to assign a specific meaning to each one of these
4365.32s: that's time bound and based on a certain event, it could be the case. It also could be the case
4371.16s: that maybe he thought a couple of them were cool or maybe he just thought that it was funny.
4375.32s: Like whatever it is, I'm unsure. But I think that, yeah, I think that there could be a meaning. I
4384.76s: don't know. But there also could be just playing, playing around like that like this dude,
4392.28s: like taking a picture in the game stop store, not meaning anything necessarily by it.
4397.00s: And then yeah, kind of going off with people guessing all the intricate details about it. So yeah,
4403.40s: that that part I just find generally interesting. So yeah, I just think that's worth a general
4411.08s: conversation. Willie says, Eric, what do you think about Berkshire's stock being linked to GME in
4417.96s: some way? Could you give me some more details? Because I don't actually talk to me about the link
4426.12s: as you see it. And then chop says finish the preference of options as a strategic investment
4430.92s: hell yeah, that's go to book. Do you recommend reading it from cover to cover? What if you okay,
4437.72s: just jumping around? No, I don't think you have to read everything one second.
4447.96s: Yeah, let me grab, let me grab some real quick.
4478.12s: All right, so I got the book here.
4491.00s: And let's take a quick look.
4500.76s: So for those that don't know the book that we're referring to, I'll show it to you really quick.
4506.44s: It's this one. I'm not affiliated with this dude. I actually invited him on the channel for a
4511.16s: podcast like because I'm probably one of his biggest advocates and he turned me down. So yeah,
4516.84s: you know, it's kind of like I view whom as options daddy and daddy doesn't love me. It's okay,
4522.76s: I mean my actual dad's dad are ready. So I guess I'm used to used to that from the dad front.
4528.04s: But yeah, so when I look at the different chapters in here, the way I would look at it is there are
4534.20s: some of them that I think are really, really worth taking a look at. And then I think others,
4541.40s: you don't necessarily need to like run all the way through. So for example, here's how I would
4545.64s: think about it. I'll show you. This is just looking at different strategies and then I'll put it.
4550.92s: Sorry, let me see if you can yeah, there you go, you can read that. So you can read these different,
4557.48s: you know, strategies and the way that I think about it is you can read through and see what
4566.68s: the strategy is about and see if it's something that you want to do. But like there's no real reason
4571.96s: in my opinion to go through this and read all of these different things if you're familiar with them
4577.56s: already or if it's not something that fits into your book. That's the way I think about it.
4584.12s: So for example, like put spreads, you can read through what they are so that you understand what
4588.76s: they are. But then if it's something that you're not going to trade, then I wouldn't read through
4592.84s: the entire thing about put spreads. Again, unless you're you're generally interested in it. So yeah,
4598.44s: let me know. Who was it that asked that? Chop, chop, let me know if that answers your question or at
4607.16s: least gives you some ideas on how I would use it. Now the stuff that I think you really do need to
4613.32s: look at though are things like arbitrage, the mathematical applications. I think those absolutely
4620.28s: need to be included. So there's stuff in here from like a structural perspective that I think
4625.80s: is really important. And then there's a lot of stuff in here that's kind of like good general
4630.04s: reference that you probably don't have to read all the way through.
4643.64s: So we're decided he was ready to stop out of the office for a second.
4657.40s: All right. So back to the other question about
4663.96s: Berkshire involvement. Let me see. That was from Willie. So let me see what Willie followed up with.
4669.80s: Okay. Willie says people have noticed Berk A volume being strange. I'm not sure that that
4675.56s: means anything in my opinion. If that's if that's the link like I wouldn't wait that very heavily.
4687.80s: Chuck of the North says go to Berk A daily in zoom out volume dies the day GME ripped. Let's take a look.
4693.56s: So let's take a look at Berk A. Let's do a side by side. This would be easier.
4708.52s: So we'll do GME up top and then we'll do Berk A. And let's compare these together.
4722.20s: So I don't see that. So Cedric you're saying that volume dies
4732.36s: on the day that GME ripped but I don't see that. I see volume expanding in GME here.
4741.00s: And then I see volume about the same here. And then I see volume in Berk A dying after the sixth.
4752.60s: But this to me looks disassociated, right? Because the sixth is here. The volume was high
4760.20s: into this move. So it follows it through this move, right?
4766.20s: Follows it through this move to the sixth. These are lined up. Volume is still high.
4771.00s: And then volume starts to tailor off after this. So to me, this is something else that's going on
4778.60s: in here personally. Because if I look at these on a longer term time frame, I can see this giant
4785.16s: ebb and flow of volume that then just cuts. I'm not sure what led to this cut in volume,
4790.60s: but it doesn't look like it's, it doesn't at least to me. It doesn't look like it's highly correlated
4800.28s: to GME at least volume behavior. So I mean, even this is completely different like from a previous
4807.40s: perspective. So yeah, unsure.
4818.68s: Let's see. George does the opposite. In case you guys were wondering, George does the opposite.
4825.08s: So that means whatever you do, George then chooses the inverse of what you do,
4832.68s: which I think is kind of good knowledge for all of us to have that when we're talking about
4837.96s: George, that he does the opposite. But George does the opposite. Says if RK jumped on
4844.92s: Siri Liberty has to do with the R play, which is likely why BK is there. That's 100%
4850.60s: why Berkshire is there. I don't know, again, whether or not the cat is there, that I have no idea,
4857.16s: no opinion on whatsoever. But what I do know is that is absolutely why Berkshire is there. For
4865.80s: sure. And these kinds of plays, again, like merger arbitrage is not a standard form of arbitrage,
4875.80s: which I feel like is really important for people to always keep in the back in their mind.
4880.28s: When we're looking at something like merger, because merger,
4885.24s: arb still has a lot of carry risk. Like this deal with this will not deal. Like the reconfiguration
4894.36s: can still run into different headwinds that prevents it from essentially coming all the way to
4899.80s: fruition, which would then impact the value of the deal. And so in this case, like it is considered
4907.40s: merger arbitrage, like that is what it's called. But this specific scenario is a little bit different
4913.80s: because it's kind of like a merger, but kind of not, right? Like it's just kind of like a reorganization
4918.36s: almost I would call it. So, Cedric says it's not arbitrage, the deal can fail. No, I don't think
4925.24s: the deal really can fail because it's an internal reorganization. Like Siri is already held by Liberty
4931.88s: Media. They just have different series of stocks that they're looking to consolidate instead of
4937.64s: having different series of stocks. Now, the thing is there's a variance between the perceived value
4946.44s: that's tracked from Liberty Media that's tracked within Siri. So that's where the arbitrage
4953.56s: merger arbitrage opportunity comes from is the reconciliation of those two values if this reorganization
4960.68s: goes through. So to your point, and I would agree with it 100%, there's always risks associated
4967.48s: with these kinds of things for whatever reason. The reorganization could not go through for some reason
4971.32s: or another, but I wouldn't consider it like a standard merger. So it's not like Liberty is buying
4977.16s: a new company or something like that. So, and exactly, Cedric, that point is also completely factual
4984.12s: is that if they don't do it for whatever reason, then the arbitrage absolutely would fail again
4989.16s: for whatever reason. So the main thing is that there's carry risk involved.
4995.64s: Cedric says arbitrage means there's no risk. I don't know if I agree with that necessarily,
5002.28s: because there's a lot of kinds of arbitrage that include risk. And technically speaking,
5007.48s: like the purest form of arbitrage is just trading the same products on two different markets and
5012.68s: taking advantage of pricing discrepancy. And there's always the possibility that the exchange
5020.36s: that you're trying to trade goes under or something like that. So even in standard arbitrage,
5025.48s: there's risk involved. Now, it's normally much lighter risk, but yeah, it's slightly different,
5031.08s: I think. Nick says your buffering is brutal. Is the buffering bad for you guys?
5037.00s: It looks okay, I'm fine. Okay, cool. Nick, it's your, it's your busted ass internet. Don't try
5050.52s: to gaslight me and say that my shit's fucked up. Everybody else says it's working straight up gaslight
5055.88s: in me blaming your, blaming your bum internet on me. It's your internet. Cedric says I got confused.
5062.60s: Yeah, I don't, I actually wouldn't even say that, yeah, I think that that's totally fair.
5068.28s: If, but I wouldn't even say you got confused because I think the, again, I'm getting to a technical
5073.48s: definition or a technical component, but exactly to your point, which I completely would agree with,
5078.44s: that the nature of most arbitrage plays is that there would be very, very little risk involved.
5083.80s: And I think it's okay to call it no risk, right? It's a slight technical deviation, but I mean,
5089.64s: I don't think you're confused. I just think it's nuanced. And there's a lot of different kinds of,
5097.80s: just a lot of different kinds of arbitrage available. So,
5103.88s: H says tender, arbitrage is lower risk. Yeah, exactly. Like there's different kinds of arbitrage,
5108.84s: but it's just the concept of arbitrage is relatively straightforward and it comes in different
5114.92s: flavors is the way I would think about it.
5120.04s: Nick says your backdrop of the chart was loading forever. Sorry, yeah, I don't know what that,
5123.56s: that's why I change it actually is because like it wouldn't pull up Siri. Am I messing something up?
5133.72s: Because I can see, I don't know, it's just not populating the chart for some reason.
5138.20s: This is the only downside of using thinkorswim on the weekend is that it can be quirky like this,
5143.40s: because this is normally when they go through all their dev time and start updating things and
5147.96s: all that kind of stuff. So, the kind of quick recap so far of what we're at is we see volume
5157.08s: picking up in GameStop. We see that this volume might be associated with earnings, but there's
5164.68s: a big enough gap that when I look at other volume rises associated with earnings, it's closer in time
5171.72s: typically. So, this is I would consider to be a slightly different effect than these and I wouldn't
5181.08s: clearly or just straight up call it some sort of earnings effect because I think that there's
5188.52s: a little bit more to it than that. That's kind of what I'm seeing from here. Now, when I look at it
5194.44s: a little bit more in depth though and we'll take a look at the options chain now because again,
5199.88s: that is something I can do that I'm pretty good at as compared to trying to come up with all
5205.56s: these other ideas that I clearly don't know a lot about, although I enjoy learning about it with
5210.20s: you guys. Let's take a look. I got to order my dinner really quick. I think we're going to do
5217.16s: I think we're going to do barbecue tonight. What do you guys think about that? I think I'm going to
5222.04s: do a sideopold pork, grilled veggies, a trytip, plate, chicken chunks, and then the wife's going to
5229.24s: get a case idea. That's what I'm thinking. What do you guys think? I think barbecue sounds right.
5236.36s: A little bit of barbecue. Briscuit? I kind of like bread. Sometimes it's too fatty for me.
5244.60s: Yeah, sometimes I think briscuit is a little too fatty. Apos fades is what I think is that you like
5253.56s: barbecue. I am, I realize that I'm habitual. So for a while before barbecue, if you guys were doing
5261.40s: the live streams when I was ordering dinner, it was like Mexican and I was just getting like a
5265.64s: burrito in a case of Dia. I was just doing Mexican a bunch of times. And then before that, I was
5270.20s: getting Greek food a lot. I go through like these phases where I just order the same thing over
5275.00s: and over again. Giovanni says you get barbecue all the time. Yeah, that's exactly right. So I would
5279.96s: save for like the past. I mean, I can tell you from my orders probably the past like three weeks.
5286.44s: We've been getting barbecue a few times a week. So yeah, Indian. We literally had Indian last
5294.52s: night like straight up last night. So Indian is on the was it last night or the night before?
5300.84s: One of those two. But yeah, Indian is absolutely on the docket as well.
5308.52s: Oh no, I don't want to start my free trial. No, no, no, no, stop that, stop that, stop that.
5312.68s: That was terrible. He was trying to get me to do a free trial for some shit. I hate that.
5317.08s: Season to sis bro. This is terrible.
5327.72s: Ever tried Thai food. Yeah, I like Thai food. Thai food is really good. The one thing I noticed
5332.36s: about California, my opinion is like we have okay food, but we do not have like really great food,
5341.64s: at least for the stuff that I like. Damn it. It looks like that stupid trial went through somehow.
5347.16s: This is horse shit. I need to figure out how to turn off that. God, I'll do that later.
5353.40s: Don't know why I have this trial now. These people suck.
5358.76s: Reese says I ate Chipotle daily for eight years. I get it. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking
5362.68s: about. Like once I find something that I generally enjoy, I literally just I just keep doing that.
5371.56s: Yeah, it's like that like that simple for me. All right, I got to turn off.
5379.80s: Yes, dude, these guys are sneaky, bro. I don't want your membership.
5394.28s: In case you didn't know, you have to be really, really, you have to be really on top of these
5400.68s: pools. Continue and Uber one. Okay, so I think we're good. All right, we made it through. Man,
5418.52s: that is a tricky flow. All right, we're back at it, gang. We have, we have dinner on the way.
5426.28s: It's not going to be here for like 45 minutes or an hour. So we're back at it.
5432.12s: H says already in 30s, study, already in 30s, studied Eric's ratio, diagonal vids,
5439.48s: looking at modifying the position from straight, long dated to something protects down side a bit more.
5444.12s: Yeah, I figured some of that out. I'm trying to catch back up.
5450.52s: Roy and Cleady says, do you think the current volume spike isn't explained by GameStop
5453.88s: releasing news about canceling their debt facility? And the associated, I think that's a big part
5458.92s: of it. I actually have that as one of the things we're supposed to look at today. So let's pivot over
5464.44s: to that. This. So yeah, I actually, oh no, this isn't the right one. My bad.
5474.60s: Where is it? This one. Yeah, okay. So this post here was, I didn't read through the whole thing.
5484.68s: I thought we can look through it together. But I completely agree with who was it that said that?
5489.80s: Roy and Cleady. I think that's exactly what it is. Now, I don't know how far it goes or the
5496.84s: severity, meaning how much it will move things. But I 100% think that this is a massive part of that move.
5511.88s: I got to tell the wife to feed the dog. Right.
5519.00s: H says, interested in what you think about Stephen Brown's idea about buying to ask Algas?
5525.48s: I haven't seen that. Let me know what it is. Let me know what the idea is.
5539.40s: But anyways, let's go through this. So this part I think is really important because this is
5544.60s: another really big pivot for GameStop. So GameStop did the at the market and essentially eliminated
5555.96s: the overwhelming majority of debt. Then they're now announcing that they're essentially unshackling
5567.48s: themselves. That's what this looks like. So I went through their previous document and just
5574.36s: had a curiosity to see, you know, what are the deals who they have deals with? And one of the things
5582.92s: that's in here that's really important to lead through to read through are the prepayments. I
5591.00s: don't care so much about. I don't think that matters. But the periods that are the sections that I
5598.76s: think matter a lot are the restricted payments change in nature transactions with affiliates. So
5605.56s: kind of this section six, seven, eight, nine. And the restricted payment section is really interesting
5612.84s: because it limits a lot of what GameStop is allowed to do without seeking approval essentially
5621.64s: from the debtors. So by canceling this agreement because now GameStop has its own freedom,
5631.48s: they don't have to go through their leanholders and essentially the other entities that they
5638.20s: previously were working with their creditors. And it gives them essentially full autonomy over what
5644.28s: they choose to do. So when I look at this, I actually believe this starts to bolster more and more
5651.40s: the idea that we might be walking into GameStop looking to acquire something as compared to just
5658.20s: investing all of it to reinvest it into the business. It does look like because I don't fully
5664.36s: understand why otherwise they would make this move at this point particularly. To me, it again
5670.84s: leads me to believe that they're looking at acquiring things, which is actually pretty sick.
5676.92s: So yeah, all right. So let me see this theory that we're talking about above.
5682.04s: By asking,
5691.32s: what else can I say all trades other than when you buy ask is done under a blanket algorithm
5697.16s: DARP? I don't fully agree with that. I can see the idea of trying to buy at the ask if it's done
5704.44s: in mass right to move something up. But I think you can have literally all cumulative retail
5709.96s: traders buy at the ask essentially at the same time. And I don't think that there would be enough
5716.44s: enough of a movement over a sustained period of time. The other thing is there's a pretty big
5723.16s: misconception about dark pools. Dark pools still report your orders. It's just delayed.
5731.80s: And so if your order is routed off exchange for whatever reason,
5738.20s: there's just a delay in the reporting. Now what is not reported are orders that are internalized.
5746.12s: That won't hit the consolidated tape because those orders have already been transacted at some
5751.40s: point and then they're held internally and essentially cycled internally. So there's no subsequent
5755.64s: impact. That leads to lack of transparency and to be clear, so do dark pools. But dark pools still
5763.00s: have reporting requirements and it's not like days later. It's minutes. So yeah,
5769.32s: like in dark pool orders will still hit the consolidated tape. So yeah, I don't think I get the idea
5776.92s: behind like trying to create like a buzz or you know, movement via that. But it's even if your
5783.00s: order is routed off exchange, as long as it's not internalized, it'll still hit the consolidated
5790.04s: tape. So again, just just my thoughts.
5798.20s: A penny for your thoughts, as they say.
5805.08s: Doctors, they says, but dark pool orders influence, but dark pool orders to influence price action
5812.20s: as much. Correct. They don't. So the whole point of dark pool orders is to create a delay in
5816.84s: reporting to obscure movements specifically for larger entities. So they don't get front ran by
5823.40s: people on their big orders. So that's the idea. Now dark pools writ large are, in my opinion,
5831.64s: terrible because they they still lack transparency. Will he says their dark pools regulated? Yeah,
5839.00s: definitely. Dark pools are really heavily regulated. Again, there's like strict reporting
5844.12s: requirements. Let's take a look together. Dark pool trade reporting requirements.
5851.80s: There's entire legislation on how ATS orders have to be regulated.
5865.24s: There you go. So this is from Finra and this is talking about dark pools. And it says,
5875.96s: though their name might make it sound like these venues like transparency or oversight, both
5879.56s: SEC and Finra are actively involved in the regulation of dark pools. So all trade data for
5885.32s: listed stock transactions that occur on ATS, they have to be submitted to Finra and the TRF
5893.48s: facility or the TRF. So this is the part that matters is published on the consolidated tape.
5901.00s: This is when it becomes available to everybody. This right here. So you, dark pool volume,
5910.44s: it still hits the consolidated tape if it's not consolidated or if it's not internalized,
5917.16s: sorry, if it's an internalized order, then it won't. So dark pools are regulated.
5924.92s: I want to be clear, I don't like dark pools. I wish that they didn't exist. But again,
5930.52s: whether or not I like something or dislike something, I think one of the most important things
5935.24s: is to be able to objectively analyze something and not get emotionally wrapped up and whether we
5940.60s: like it, dislike it, whatever that is to separate those two things. So while I don't like them,
5946.04s: and I wish they didn't exist, it's also not this crazy dark world that is wild west and
5954.60s: just anything happens. It's still regulated. So yeah, I just wouldn't look at dark pools as a
5962.68s: bottomless abyss, contrary to the name. And you can look at essentially the ATS right here.
5972.60s: And it'll show you the different orders that rotated through because again, like this website,
5979.48s: PME off exchange volume. This website's great chart exchange. I really, really like this website.
5986.44s: And I'm not affiliated with these dudes. They just have a fantastic, fantastic website. And
5993.96s: you can see a few things from them. But when we're looking at these, this is where they're
6000.60s: getting it from. So when we're trying to track off exchange volume, this is how we can track
6005.64s: off exchange volume because it's reported. If it's not reported, then we can't track it. So yeah.
6019.56s: I'm catching up on the chat here.
6022.36s: I don't forget five of the biggest call volumes last six months came in on Friday. Yeah,
6032.20s: we'll talk about that in a second for sure, especially the order Friday. I think I talked about
6036.52s: that in the last video, but I definitely want to talk about it. Chris says he doesn't do technical
6043.96s: analysis. Who doesn't do technical analysis? I assume we're talking about somebody else because I
6048.20s: definitely do. Cedric says internal orders are the same as a trade done off market. You can do
6055.64s: the same. They're they so a dark pool order in order that's routed to the dark pool. It can be
6061.88s: internalized or it cannot be internalized. There's an offshoot. There's a split. The reason why I
6067.80s: point that out is just to differentiate that dark, it's not dark pool. No volume. That's not
6075.80s: again, like that's how we see this. They're not getting this from like the tooth fairy. They
6081.48s: get off exchange volume from the reporting structure that exists. So there's a consolidated
6089.80s: tape that ingests that data. Now again, to everybody's point, it's not the most transparent setup.
6097.16s: And the orders can be internalized, which that is literally a dark pool, right? That you can't see
6104.92s: into. But that's it's just again, I just think it's important to be accurate when we're talking
6109.72s: about this stuff because it's so easy to get to a point where we're just so disenfranchised because
6114.52s: it's like, oh, shit, it's all fake or it's all going to the dark pool. The volume doesn't matter.
6118.84s: And it's like, I understand that sentiment, but it's like partially true because again, like
6124.12s: dark pools don't inherently not permit order or volume tracking. It still exists. It just depends
6131.16s: on if it's internalized. So yeah, the system is still unfair to a lot of degrees. Retail traders
6138.28s: are not advantaged. Want to be clear about all of that. But because the system is not totally
6143.96s: fair, doesn't mean that it's totally rigged either. Again, in my opinion, because if it were
6149.80s: totally rigged and we looked like this wouldn't happen. Nope. Anybody that's on the other side of
6156.76s: this trade, like the large entities that get hurt when this happens that do have the controlling
6162.84s: hand on a lot of stuff. If they had total control, this would never happen. They don't want this.
6169.80s: So that's that's I just think it's important to look at both sides of this is all. I understand
6175.80s: the frustrations that people have. I don't blame them for having them. But for me, I just look at
6181.16s: markets in the world slightly differently. And even though I have opinions, preferences,
6187.72s: and stuff like that, I do my absolute best to decouple those from my ability to analyze things.
6195.32s: And when I'm analyzing something, I'm trying to do it as objectively as humanly possible.
6199.80s: That's my intent. I still have bias. I still have skew. I always will. We all always will
6204.76s: were humans. But that's one of the reasons why I try to use kind of a statistical approach to
6210.60s: things because I can then quantify things. And that inherently will show the bias if it's there
6218.60s: in terms of my perception. One of my biases is for roaring kitty. My bias was I thought that he
6225.88s: was a stock trader that then used options to amplify the stock positions. That's not what happened.
6233.56s: Right. I can see in the beginning, he was actually just using options and then started
6238.28s: scaling into the stock after that. Which is also really interesting to me. We are two
6247.96s: spin drifts down. We're down to the last beverage. And this one is not a spin drift. We now have
6254.68s: a waterloo, which is a blackberry lemonade,
6259.64s: a seltzer water. So for anybody else that is enjoying a seltzer water or other beverage cheers to you.
6268.68s: Or as my dad would say, stole a lot.
6274.28s: Let's see. Sadiq says, what is weird before Jamie? He's diversified very diversified like
6280.36s: 50 positions. Yeah. So, Sadiq, there's a video. I have to find it. If we want to look through it
6288.28s: right now, I would be happy to try to find it because I don't know where it is, but I remember
6292.44s: listening to it. And so he has a video where he's talking about his methodology. And in that video,
6301.00s: he talks about his transition from being a value investor into something else. And I don't remember
6309.16s: what he called himself as moving into, but I distinctly remember hearing him talking about his
6315.48s: frustrations with being a value investor. And when he has something that's valued and the stock
6321.32s: didn't move towards that value. So I have to find where that is. I don't remember exactly where it is.
6328.68s: But I remember him talking about that specifically, because I thought it was really topical. So for
6333.08s: Sadiq, that's the recollection I have, which might be faulty. But I think that's why he went from
6340.84s: having so many positions to then getting hyper focused because my guess is he was going through
6346.60s: this process. Like if we look at his YouTube channel, you'll see that he's gone through massive,
6354.60s: massive, massive effort here. And we look at his videos. He's gone through massive effort building
6363.24s: like these different spreadsheets and being in the finance industry and trading for a long time.
6370.76s: And then you find that at least seems like he wasn't seeing the success he wanted to see. So then
6379.00s: he changed his style. That's what I kind of take away from it. And I think that's why
6384.76s: he changed his approach and became way more concentrated. Yeah.
6393.64s: Where are we at? Oh, okay, cool. It looks like you guys are.
6400.12s: Sadiq says you don't leverage all in 10x on a guess.
6403.80s: Well, it's not. It's not 10x because he used options and he bought options. So if you're buying
6416.76s: options, you're not leverage where you have unlimited risk. You're limited to whatever you bought
6422.28s: those options for. So if we go back to this here and again, we go back to one of his first posts
6428.52s: that I see here, his portfolio is 113,000 with essentially 100,000 of that in options. So
6440.04s: what this tells me is he's risking $100,000 on GameStop calls. Obviously, he's very bullish.
6451.08s: And obviously he really believed in his due diligence and his thesis, rightfully so.
6456.76s: But this is a highly concentrated position. But I just clarifying that this doesn't open him to
6463.56s: like margin risk or anything like that. This in and of itself is he's just essentially risking his
6470.36s: whole portfolio. It's a yellow, right? As he talks about this exactly what it is. It's a yellow.
6475.16s: Sadiq says he doesn't do that on a guess. Yeah, I agree with you. I think that he did his research
6480.44s: and he really believed in what he was doing. I completely agree with you there.
6486.36s: Yeah, I 100% agree with you.
6491.72s: Vladimir says all same contract with different dates that he bought. Yeah, exactly.
6495.56s: So you can see that this top line is the total contract. And then these down here are all of
6503.64s: the individual positions that he kind of scaled into over time.
6507.72s: So we can see that he started scaling in in June.
6517.80s: One second. I'm going to answer.
6537.08s: Yeah.
6562.92s: Back at it. Sorry about that.
6564.28s: Let me catch up. His first buy was 30, 30. That's funny.
6575.00s: Yeah. So, but anyways, like he obviously is just heavily, heavily, heavily leveraging this play.
6585.56s: Jimmy Zart. His thesis was never just proven and only confirms his thesis when activist
6591.00s: investor RC got on board. Yeah. Well, and again, I can tell from the beginning that this obviously
6597.40s: wasn't a perfectly timed position because he started like really, really light.
6603.80s: So I see 50, 50, 50, 50, then 200. That's an interesting scaling mechanism that, again, most
6611.48s: traders don't really do. But what I can tell you is that there's some degenerate behavior going
6619.48s: on here. And I'm not again, using that term derogatory towards him. I'm a degenerate too.
6625.64s: But I can see some degenerate trading behavior here. So he got 50 at 60, 50 at 75, 50 at 55, 50 at 50,
6633.80s: and then he goes 200 at 30, 100 at 30. So we are averaging down hard core, scaling into a losing
6643.64s: trade at the time. Obviously it shows really profitable at the time that he took the snapshot.
6650.84s: But that is just classic. It's just absolutely classic, slowly scaling in and then it starts
6658.52s: thiffing. It's like, oh, shit, well, if I just add a bunch more, then I'm good. I don't have to go
6664.68s: up his high in order to break even and then it worked out, right? So that's awesome. But yeah,
6670.12s: this is just a standard standard D-chain movement, which I love to see because I fully identify
6677.40s: with it. Yeah, absolutely classic big, big fan. But yeah, I think that's a big reason why we saw
6684.84s: a significant change in his overall methodology. So yeah.
6691.88s: All right. So let's take a look at a couple other things. I do want to take a look at the options
6697.80s: chain for the month. So we'll grab unusual whales for this and we'll go in here.
6705.72s: Reese says, what was the date? This is five years ago. Is the date?
6713.08s: There I go. Oh, that's actually really cool. I didn't know that. If you hover over, it gives you
6715.72s: exactly one eight September. That's actually really cool.
6719.56s: Dr. Zayn says he also knew the squeeze was coming.
6730.84s: I, yeah, well, I think in his videos, he started talking about the potential of a squeeze a bit,
6737.56s: I don't remember. I know that he talked about it though. I don't remember when. So let's go
6742.04s: to the lives because one of these talks about a squeeze somewhere. Let me go all the way back to
6748.60s: the beginning. No squeeze there. Here we go. This right here. So this, this was,
6765.00s: does this give me the exact date? Three years ago. Do we know
6771.80s: this doesn't give me the date? Right click. Cedric, where do I right click? Tell me. Do I? Yeah, teach me.
6787.08s: There it goes. Again, you just had to hover over it. Look at me go. So this was September 4th.
6794.20s: So it doesn't fully corroborate the idea of a squeeze in my opinion until later.
6806.60s: Because he started buying this position all the way back in June. So my guess is maybe as he thought
6816.44s: the squeeze, maybe I don't know again, when he thought it was going to start to come on.
6821.08s: But maybe when he when he was thinking that it was going to start to come on that he would scale in.
6828.68s: That definitely could be something on his radar.
6837.48s: Yeah, interesting idea.
6841.24s: Rhino says, Mr. Part ReS, where we are, Kyoto. Oh, that's so cool. I've only been around there.
6848.28s: I haven't really had a chance to to check out Kyoto. That's so sick. Welcome in, man.
6854.52s: Rhino says in his DD, the short interest was an afterthought. Yeah, because to me,
6858.04s: that looked like something that was scaled on over time. So that let me back up here.
6865.80s: Because when I when I was looking at his first stuff, like, you know, when he was talking about
6869.96s: these kinds of things, it still looked like a value play to me in terms of what he thought was
6874.68s: happening. And then it didn't look like we were, you know, starting to explore the concept of a
6880.28s: squeeze until later. But then we can see that there's a couple, couple call outs for a squeeze,
6888.60s: like right here, right? Squeezed orange or whatever that is. That's an orange. Yeah. So it looks like
6898.92s: something that built over time. To me, it does look like the origin of the position was just a
6906.44s: value play. And he really believed in the value opportunity there. That's what I took. So yeah.
6917.40s: Sweet. All right. So now let's take a look at this. We can change into this.
6926.84s: Ryan O. says, do you think this time, RK will do it like you did in 19 several different strikes and
6931.96s: expiration is to keep the element of surprise? I mean, I typically see him in one strike.
6944.04s: At least recently. So my guess is, my guess would be one strike actually as compared to multiple.
6952.52s: Because it seems like he likes to build into positions. That's another thing I've noticed at
6960.36s: least historically, especially now when he's trading at the size that he's trading at, you kind
6965.80s: of have to build into them over time. Just because literally the positions are too freaking large
6971.32s: to just hop in them all at once. So that's my hypothesis. Ricky says, uh-oh time to get serious,
6980.60s: Eric standing. Yeah. It's just my fucking sciatica that I'm standing. Put on the tin. Yeah, I got you.
6993.08s: Except the only caveat is if I'm going to put on the tin, we got to talk about tin foil. We
6999.24s: can't talk about factual stuff. So you guys are going to have to hook me up with some tin foil stuff
7005.00s: we can look at. Let me look at these options first. And then we can get into the tin.
7012.68s: This, this, look at this. So I'm going to look at just the call side. I'm going to look at just the
7018.60s: asks. And let's take a look. So we see a $660,000 trade that came in targeting the 20th of
7034.60s: Sep. So this is through earnings. I talked about this a bit on the recap video yesterday. I
7042.20s: actually plan on getting further into detail on it, probably in the outlook video for tomorrow.
7049.40s: But this, this move here is absolutely, absolutely interesting to me because that is not an
7058.28s: insignificant position. And there's not a lot of retail traders that have this kind of capital
7065.96s: to run this. Some of us do, but not a ton. And it's, it's interesting. The reason why now, actually,
7077.72s: this is perfect time for this. So, oh, wait, hold on, I got to extend this because it's
7085.72s: cutting off the top of my hat. Hold on. Let me extend this.
7100.20s: There we go. Yeah, that was frustrating me. It's like, what, what is the point of having a tin foil
7106.76s: hat, a Viking tin foil hat with horns that my wife made me specifically for these?
7113.00s: Um, if it's not going to show the horns, I feel like they have to be here. They kind of fade in
7117.48s: and out, but that's, I guess, just kind of how it goes. Actually, give me one more second. I have
7122.68s: another idea. Let's do. We'll duplicate this like this. And then in this instead, we'll move this
7136.28s: here. There we go. See this. So now we have, oh, that's not good. Hold on, hold on, gang. Give me a
7151.64s: second, figuring it out. I almost got it. Okay. That's kind of terrifying. That's, nope, not what I
7161.00s: wanted. Nope, not what I wanted. How's this going for you guys? Is this like super confusing yet?
7169.88s: Because it has me fairly confused. All right. So let's go there. And then let's do this. All right.
7184.60s: So now we have this one for like the regular. And then we have this one specifically for tin foil hat.
7194.28s: I can make sure that the size is appropriate as such. There we go. Now it can be seen in all its
7204.20s: glory on adulthood. This is what I needed in my life. This is, I mean, I love this. I even can
7213.56s: zoom that up just a little bit be like that. I feel like you can like really take in the tin here.
7218.28s: Okay. So now let's get, let's get tinny. This, I don't know if it's the cat, but it absolutely
7226.92s: reminds me of the cat. So I didn't say this in the video on Friday because I, when I'm doing
7234.84s: like the recap videos and stuff like that, I genuinely try to keep it as objective as I possibly can.
7243.00s: And to not, you know, send people down different rabbit holes and all that kind of stuff.
7248.60s: This looks like the cat to me. And the reason why I say that is because I know when he, I think,
7258.44s: when he rotated from when he rotated at least whether it was selling shares, selling partial,
7267.96s: but when he moved into chewy, however, that played out for him, one of the things that I have to
7274.68s: imagine is that he still wants to play GameStop. And I think it's been such a big part of what he does.
7284.44s: So the interesting thing about this position is I would not be shocked if we get a portfolio
7292.92s: update from him soon that will show the chewy position still to some degree and then an options
7301.40s: position in GameStop. That's one of my guesses. And the reason why I guess that is because if we take a
7309.80s: look at his portfolio. And let's take a look through all the way up here. Guess what? He had 268 million
7329.32s: dollars based on the math for his chewy position, assuming that he had gotten in somewhere around here.
7346.84s: Somewhere like, what is this nonsense? I don't understand why these charts won't load. Stop this
7354.92s: immediately. Okay. Since apparently we can't, okay, since apparently we can't look at any charts,
7365.16s: I'm going to go to good old Yahoo Finance and we'll pull up the chart there.
7375.24s: Let's look at Chewie.
7376.52s: And then let's go back like three months. And we think that he got in here on the 24th.
7387.72s: Was it the 20th? I think it was the 24th. And when I look at the 24th, I see,
7395.88s: was it the 24th of June or July? Hold on, let me make sure I'm on the right date.
7406.68s: Do you guys know which date it was specifically?
7413.08s: Of Vladimir says he can sell Chewie down to 5.1. No, isn't it below 5?
7418.12s: June 24th, okay, I was on the right date. Thank you, Rhino. No, I think you're right,
7422.20s: because that's the date that I remember too. But Vladimir off-put and I think it's if it's sub-five,
7429.64s: because it's once you cross the five threshold, it starts. And then I think if it's sub-five,
7436.60s: then he would have to file the amendment within 10 days of the transaction.
7441.88s: So if we take a look at this and let's just assume, because when I look at the chart, there's
7451.08s: a pretty decent size volume for the day as well. So I think it essentially lines up almost perfectly.
7458.20s: But let's say that we give them like the mid price. So the high was 2750, the low was 2475.
7465.80s: So if we give it to them at like 26, 26 times 9 million, 1000 shares, is $234 million.
7476.92s: $234 million. So going back to the hypothesis here, now that we got the 10 foil hat on and we can get
7486.76s: dirty with it, if we come back over here and we look at this, we know that he has a $234 million
7495.24s: position in Chewie. So let's get the exact math. 268452844 minus 234023000. It gives him 34 million.
7512.04s: It's $34 million left over. And then nuts that you put on a $200 million position,
7519.88s: you're like, yeah, I'm just going to keep like 34 million in cash. Let's just if it's in cash.
7525.64s: Part of it could be in GameStop. And that wouldn't surprise me in the least. But what it does tell me
7531.40s: is that he has $34 million residual of some sort. So when I look at this kind of position,
7541.24s: $660,000, it would not shock me whatsoever. If there's some sort of residual GameStop position,
7550.20s: and if he still has a decent amount of money in order to put on a position like this to probably
7557.88s: play earnings, that's what I expected as. So this looks very similar to cat behavior. Also in terms
7566.76s: of the time of entry of the trade towards the end of the day, he's very commonly, I think,
7574.04s: doing that because again, like more professional traders like myself, we know that there's more liquidity
7579.32s: there. So that is also why I think he's doing that towards the end of the day. So yeah, I think
7587.00s: this absolutely could be him. Sedgwick says people do not want him to sell GameStop. But I also think
7594.20s: he did and that it's actually bullish because he come back and the price didn't move. Yeah, I mean
7599.96s: the idea that he didn't sell any GameStop to get into Chewie, I think is
7604.44s: possible somehow, but I would deem that very unlikely personally. And I think the highest probability
7613.24s: scenario is he likely sold a good chunk if not all of his GameStop to move into Chewie for whatever
7621.88s: reason. And then after that, I think he probably now is seemingly starting to play GameStop if this is him.
7638.60s: That's my Uber order. Hold on, I think they're struggling to find the house. I gotta message them.
7652.60s: Okay.
7661.64s: Yeah, so anyways, that's what it looks like to me. Now, Ryan says we do not know how much
7667.32s: many had and how much how much he's using and what we know, he moved to Chewie, he has more than
7672.28s: 20 million to buy other options position, maybe not 120 million, but maybe 40, yeah, or maybe
7677.48s: 660K. I think this is absolutely true.
7682.44s: Munkle says it's possible is possible RK kept Jimmy shares hedge position with 25 long dated puts
7688.52s: leveraged by empowered gain from Jimmy to hedge for his two positions. I don't see him buying puts.
7694.20s: Yeah, I just do not see that as part of his approach at all.
7699.80s: Again, just an opinion, but everything that this dude has talked about is not that.
7707.56s: Yeah.
7717.32s: Yeah.
7719.80s: Um, so anyways, a couple things to highlight here.
7724.28s: Cedric says could could he sell calls on his position for Chewie, maybe?
7729.08s: Um, he could. I'm not sure.
7732.84s: I'm not sure that he would, but he could. I haven't seen. I haven't really seen a lot of his
7744.84s: behavior when it comes to selling, right? So even in this case, he, he didn't sell options. He
7753.88s: didn't sell like I actually don't know. Have you guys seen anything in here where he sold options?
7759.48s: Because I haven't actually now that I'm thinking about it.
7764.92s: This is long. This is long. Let me go back further 2020 long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long.
7775.80s: Yeah. I don't see him. I don't see him buying puts and I don't see him selling calls.
7789.72s: What does this do?
7796.60s: Oh, it's like, uh, I thought I was like, uh, the mouse. Right.
7805.80s: Nope. Not what I was going for.
7812.20s: Nope. Okay. So these are all just like gifts.
7814.44s: Yeah. So I don't see, I don't see him selling calls and I don't see him buying puts.
7830.04s: Yeah. Reese says I don't think he sold options ever. I don't either. I just don't see it.
7834.28s: Like he could do it. But everything about even this comment down here, which is actually really
7840.76s: explanatory to me. Let me find it.
7844.52s: Larming. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
7865.16s: I'm looking for a specific spot in here that we saw earlier.
7870.44s: Yeah.
7887.08s: This is another thing I learned about him. I think that you guys told me is that like,
7892.12s: you actually used to get beat up a little bit, you know, proverbially on like these
7897.80s: uh, forms and stuff, which I think is really interesting.
7909.24s: Cedric says we never saw him hold shares too. Yeah, we definitely see, we've seen him hold shares,
7915.64s: but we haven't, I haven't seen him downsize his shares.
7927.48s: Yeah.
7930.92s: Fridge states
7932.80s: No
7941.28s: I think there was somewhere in here.
7950.68s: No, no, no.
7954.46s: No. No. Yeah, and these are all bought. Okay, I think it's somewhere in here. Here, right
7966.14s: here. Finally, sorry, that took me a minute to find it. But this is the exact spot I was
7970.82s: looking for. Um, we'll click into the comment and see what the conversation was. Wait, where's
7978.30s: the original or did he just, I thought that this was in response to somebody. Yeah, okay. Hold
7988.14s: on. I got to see because that looks like that definitely looks like a comment that's in response
7992.14s: to somebody. Here we go. Why did you keep buying after you averaged down around 30 and then it
8001.18s: doubled to make more money. Okay, here we go. I was curious why you didn't roll to another strike
8008.70s: or expiration. I felt these ones were most attractively priced. Obviously, there's a case to be made
8012.62s: that diversifying across strikes, expertise, whatever, do my risk. But in my opinion, such action,
8020.22s: actions may have also reduced my estimated returns. And quite frankly, that's not how I roll.
8026.30s: So like that is so, so explanatory to me in terms of the way that he looks at things like he's
8035.42s: not looking to reduce risk, right? So when I see this kind of thing, it just tells me that he's
8043.26s: obviously supremely, like supremely convicted in what he's doing. And by the way that he positions
8050.62s: even up until this point, right? Like his disposition when he made this change from value investing
8057.66s: to this, it's the same, it's the same story because in any of these scenarios, like let's take a look
8066.70s: in, let's go up here. So in this case, he literally could have closed this position down
8080.06s: when his portfolio was literally, literally over half a billion dollars.
8092.14s: Billion could have taken this off. He made $175.5 million in a day on these calls.
8101.42s: Half of a billion dollars. If he cared about risk at all, he would have started scaling down.
8111.98s: There's no reason why you wouldn't start scaling down here, especially because if you like think
8118.70s: of this logically from a trading perspective, his options were for 21 June 24.
8124.22s: This is June 6th. He's coming up on expiration. They're not good till forever.
8131.10s: So that would have been an ideal time to scale down if he gave even a remote fuck about risk.
8141.50s: But this tells me he doesn't, like he doesn't
8145.90s: have a risk. He's in G-A-F about risk, just he doesn't, which is incredible. It's part of the reason
8153.26s: why I find his movements so interesting to break down and analyze because that is just highly,
8161.82s: highly anomalous. You just don't see that and it's incredible. It's so fun. It's so fun to look at.
8168.94s: But yeah, that's exactly what this is. He did not care about the risk whatsoever.
8181.66s: Let me see. Let me catch up with you guys.
8186.46s: CCM King says he has never posted selling calls. Yeah, I completely agree with that. I haven't seen
8191.02s: it. Oh, interesting. So H says old Wall Street bets flamed them, fascinating. I don't know why
8199.18s: I don't actually get why.
8209.10s: Vladimir Offputin says D.F. V. Zyola posts were positions at a moment in time. Don't reflect
8214.06s: all transactions. Yes, really important to identify. Now, one of the things that I think is fair to
8220.62s: assume though, especially when you see this many posts is you can definitely infer style from the
8227.50s: posts, right? Like I can tell that he prefers individual strikes. I can tell the DTEs that he tends
8235.74s: to prefer are not super short. I can tell that he prefers to wait his options plays over his
8242.78s: equity plays. Like there's a lot of details I can pick up simply from analyzing a series of
8250.30s: trades from somebody. You can pick up a lot of their behaviors if you're discerning. So I completely
8256.38s: completely agree with you, Mr. Offputin. But I will say that I think in this case, we can come up with
8268.14s: a pretty good idea for the way that he trades. That's my guess.
8277.58s: Yeah, Rhino says I don't think he's doing it for the money anymore after a few million. I would
8281.02s: assume a man would be satisfied. Yeah, I completely agree. Because the other thing is that it doesn't
8285.74s: look like this dude is like heavily balling out or doing anything crazy like that.
8295.10s: Yeah, it essentially looks like he's doing his thing. So yeah, in this case, I completely agree.
8306.38s: I don't think that he really is overly obsessed with money. Even the way that he did the live stream
8312.70s: and how much fun he had with that, you could tell he's not into flexing on everybody with the money.
8318.86s: He's not into that superficial bullshit, which is really cool. It's another reason why I like the
8323.02s: guy so much is that he's really, really seemingly genuine in that sense, which I like a lot.
8330.30s: So H says back before GME, it was more seasoned traders with high risk tolerance. That would
8337.10s: bash each other for a good time. Oh, interesting. Really, really interesting. I didn't know that
8346.46s: about like the older school Wall Street or Wall Street pets. Because I've honestly always took
8352.22s: Wall Street pets that it was just kind of like a bunch of people fucking around generally talking
8358.70s: about taking really big risks or like losing money. Like that's the general gist that I've got from it.
8367.26s: He says, now you can't mention GME on Wall Street pets. I did not know that either. That's also completely fascinating.
8378.30s: Jono Tron says tin foil will get a RK post stream on the seventh. It's clearly in his Busta Rhymes
8385.50s: meme from 516 after 97 Flip mode when I be on the mic. Yes, I do my due to you. Interesting thesis.
8394.22s: We'll have to see how accurate it is. All right, gang. That about wraps me up. Really, really fun session,
8404.06s: though. Had an absolute blast hanging out with you guys. It's time to take the tin foil off.
8409.50s: And it's time to do a little bit of market prep for the rest of my trading. But
8413.82s: incredible hanging out with you all have an absolute blast looking at this stuff. I am so hopeful
8419.98s: that the week ahead is going to be just super, super fun. Now the last thing I want to show you all
8426.94s: just so that you have it for your record. If you're interested in looking it up, this is the
8433.34s: SEC report on the 2021 squeeze and what they came away with, which I think is really interesting
8439.74s: and really worth reading through because there's a lot of small details that I'm starting to pick
8446.22s: up from it. And then the other one I want to show you is this, which is about off exchange volume
8454.54s: market makers and talking about this has pieces about GME in here. So this is another like recent study
8463.18s: that I'm reading through to pick together some more more pieces. So Ricky says, my portfolio is
8471.10s: hopeful to I'm cooked if we go any more downward. Well, I don't know Ricky. Maybe you're following
8477.74s: the DFV model and just yolo yoloing out there. But if you're yoloing it, then you got to give
8483.58s: the same amount of fucks as the cat does with his risk, which is zero. If you're not in that same
8489.42s: boat, which again, I'll keep it a buck with you guys. I'm not like that. I care a lot about my
8493.82s: risk because I have a lot of shit that I have to keep on the table. I already told you all like I
8499.10s: retired my mom through trading. So I do not have that same disposition risk to me matters a lot.
8506.78s: So if you feel some type of way about the risk, then I would probably take a look at another position.
8515.42s: Or change a little bit about what you're doing. So yeah.
8520.54s: Chris says I was hoping you would cover the 20 and a half calls from Friday. Yeah, let's take a look.
8525.18s: I'll take a look right now with you. No sweat. Sorry about that. If I missed it earlier in the chat,
8529.66s: that's my bad. Let me get rid of that. I think we can kill all of this. And oh, shit,
8541.74s: that had unusual whales. Let me grab that again, because I can't pull it up in here. I don't know
8546.78s: what's up with this is still annoying. So this is like two to one. Yeah, let's take a look at GameStop.
8558.86s: All right. And you wanted to look at the 20 and a half calls from Friday.
8565.98s: So let's go just to Friday. And then let's just look at the calls. And then let's just look at the
8577.90s: specific strike, which is 20.5. And then 20.5. I mean, I don't really see anything here personally.
8595.34s: Yeah, this just looks like a handful of positions. It does look like the same person.
8606.38s: And yeah.
8615.98s: But yeah, I don't see much. I don't see much here.
8619.34s: These are pretty small too, right? Like 32,000, 28, 28. None of these kind of things are going to
8630.06s: move the market. So yeah, I don't really see much here, man. Sorry. But yeah, the 20 and a half
8638.86s: look actually kind of quiet to me. As always, I'm always happy to take a look and always enjoy
8645.82s: trying to see if we can find something. But yeah, age says, fuck the test. I want generational wealth.
8651.74s: I hope you get it, man. I really do. That's one of the things that scares me, honestly, about the
8657.42s: GameStop movement and the GameStop community is because I know so many people are kind of leaning
8661.74s: on it is a way to change their lot in life, which I cannot identify more with. I grew up poor.
8669.98s: So I really get that. But the one thing I would say, and again, this is just my perspective,
8676.70s: I absolutely hope the GameStop thing works out for you guys to hit that generational wealth.
8683.34s: That would be incredible. But I also think it's important to identify for every case that you find
8691.18s: somebody like Roy and Kitty who does what he does. He is truly an outlier. He truly isn't
8698.14s: anomaly. For every case that you see of him, there are quite literally hundreds of thousands
8705.74s: of other people that have attempted similar permutations and fail. So the way that I look at it
8713.02s: is I look at trading GameStop as a portion of my portfolio. But I treat risk very differently,
8722.06s: obviously, than somebody like Roy and Kitty who again, I've tremendous respect for. But if it's
8727.42s: for the people that are out there trying to actually attain generational wealth or to really
8732.46s: change their lot in life, I would just consider the calculus. I would look at the probability of
8741.02s: that happening with your current portfolio size through a vector like GameStop versus the probability
8746.94s: of that happening through another vector, maybe a compilation of GameStop and then maybe some
8755.10s: other trading vehicles if you have like decent experience or something. The thing that just makes me
8761.34s: nervous is that I'm nervous that there's going to be a lot of people that are just going to get hurt
8765.50s: and be holding the bag. And I genuinely don't want to see that. It's one of the reasons why I spend
8769.50s: two and a half hours hanging out with you guys on a Saturday, which genuinely I enjoy this. I
8774.86s: really enjoy spending the time with you all. But part of what I try to do is see if I can't share
8780.30s: some other pieces to this broader puzzle, not just for GameStop, but broadly to hopefully help people
8787.26s: build that broader skill set if it's of interest. So for the people that want to go yellow and all
8793.82s: into GameStop, I love that. And if it's something that you really believe in and it's throughout
8798.70s: you want to go, I cannot tell you how much I hope that it plays out. And then for those that are
8805.90s: trying to achieve generational wealth and maybe they have a risk tolerance maybe closer to mine
8812.46s: where I'm not comfortable yoloing everything I have into an individual ticker pretty much anything
8817.10s: individual other than like an index ETF personally. Then I would just kind of build a slightly
8823.74s: different portfolio that gives me the exposure to GameStop that I want like I have and then do some
8828.86s: other stuff on the, you know, on the side. But you can make a lot of money in the markets. That's
8835.02s: what it comes down to. You can really change your lot in life. And one of the coolest things about
8840.62s: markets is that it is a purely solo endeavor. It's all you. So there's nobody that makes sure you're
8846.78s: doing the right thing. There's nobody that makes sure that you have a plan before you're placing a
8851.02s: trade. There's nobody that bosses you around at all. That's part of the beauty. But that's also one
8857.82s: of the issues that a lot of people have is when you have all of that freedom, you kind of have to
8863.26s: be your own boss. And I think a lot of people maybe don't consider that part of the freedom
8869.74s: as much as they should. So I cannot tell you how much I enjoy hanging out with you all. It's an
8875.90s: absolute blast. I'm stoked to continue following GameStop. We'll see what it does is coming week.
8880.70s: The breath of fresh air with volume is sick. So I am yeah, I'm all eyes and ears on it. You'll
8887.50s: obviously see a video pop out tomorrow about kind of GameStop and then the week ahead. So I hope
8893.66s: everybody has a killer weekend. Thanks for hanging out for a while. Be an outlier, be an ape, be an
8898.62s: outlier ape. Whichever version of those applies to you. And I will see you all later or next weekend
8906.30s: for another GME live stream. Take care everybody.
