0.00s:  What is up, ape nation, into the outliers that are coming to hang out with the apes and
7.20s:  the ape outliers and all the permutations thereof?
12.14s:  We have a pretty cool session, hopefully, in store for today.
17.96s:  I have a few things on the agenda, but I'm also hoping to pick your brain as kind of the
26.16s:  chat in the audience.
28.08s:  So that we can figure out other things that we want to go explore together, but I figured
32.60s:  there's a few things on the top of my mind.
34.92s:  The first thing is the 8K that was filed.
39.20s:  I want to take a look at that.
41.56s:  And I also want to run through kind of these different studies that I've been looking
47.72s:  through.
48.72s:  This is how I learn a lot about markets in general is I'll refer to like existing published
55.04s:  studies that I can dive into their research, understand how they're looking at things.
61.24s:  So we have a couple things on the docket.
63.28s:  Some of these I've already read.
64.92s:  Some of them I haven't and I'll make it super easy for us.
68.28s:  We don't have to go through like these entire things.
70.92s:  What I'll do is summarize some of what I learned from it up front, flip through some of
74.92s:  the interesting spots with you.
76.88s:  And then I can always throw it into chat GPT if you have any specific questions that we
80.68s:  want to dive into.
81.68s:  But this is a lot of bedrock behind like what makes GameStop special because that's
90.08s:  what this boils down to is every time that I'm analyzing different elements of GameStop,
95.84s:  it continues.
96.84s:  I say it all the time, but like it continues to shock me as an anomaly.
102.32s:  There's so many things about the stock that buck normal trends and as a lifelong trader,
109.32s:  I cannot help but find stuff like that just truly, truly fascinating.
114.92s:  There's so many things about it that every time I think I'm generally understanding or
120.88s:  that this that or the other piece kind of finally line up and I'll find something new.
127.80s:  And the other thing about GameStop that I enjoy a lot is it's teaching me a lot about
134.28s:  market structure that again, even from a pretty longstanding trader standpoint, a practitioner
140.24s:  standpoint, I didn't know all these different details because it's never really impacted
146.08s:  the majority of what I was doing as a trader.
148.60s:  So this thing is just so cool to me and I love these sessions and kind of working through
154.24s:  learning more about it from two different perspectives, from the general interest perspective
158.72s:  for GameStop, the story, the community, that stuff in it itself is always a blast.
163.88s:  But then also from a trading perspective because this is a really, really, really tradable
169.04s:  series of events, which we'll talk about as well.
172.08s:  So I am happy as you could tell to be here with you all and to start getting into detail.
179.12s:  So I figure we can start with a quick recap about GameStop, kind of just what it's done
184.20s:  since the last week we've spoke.
186.40s:  Then I thought we can take a look at any pertinent GameStop news that's popped up.
190.64s:  Obviously some of them have already been covered ad nauseam throughout the week and our
194.24s:  boy Newton.
195.24s:  I was just texting with him.
196.48s:  He has a bunch of research that he's doing now regarding slightly different effects.
203.64s:  And so I thought we could do a quick recap just on some general news.
207.52s:  And then I can talk to you about some of the research that I'm doing.
210.64s:  And then yeah, whatever else you think would be fun to take a look at.
213.76s:  That's part of the greatest part of these sessions for me is that the chat always throws
217.56s:  out a lot of like really fun things to go explore.
221.04s:  So I'm looking forward to that.
222.20s:  All right, let me grab the chat now so that I can monitor it and keep up with you all
230.16s:  as we move along.
231.16s:  So it looks like we have PFA.
234.36s:  We got Reese, Elon songs, H. Willie, Joe Tato.
237.68s:  That's a super fun name.
239.24s:  Tanner Steve, Willie, threshold solutions.
242.88s:  Sne, I don't want to mess this up.
245.24s:  Sne-hill, Sne-hill.
246.24s:  I think that's right.
247.60s:  Sne-hill, Vaja, Sedrick, we got the gang in town.
251.88s:  We're ready to rock and roll.
253.40s:  All right.
254.72s:  So Steve says anything about the cat system.
258.28s:  Yeah.
259.28s:  So the cat system is really, really curious to me.
264.16s:  The Clifnotes version is, well, the disclaimer, I should say upfront, is that I upfront
271.36s:  do not have a good foundation for it yet.
275.16s:  I've started looking through it kind of in a cursory manner to get familiar with it
279.40s:  to understand it a little bit better, but I'm not, like it's not jumping out at me yet.
284.52s:  So I just throw that out for general consumption because I'm happy to explore it with you now.
289.24s:  But again, I will always flag the things that I'm confident in and the things that I don't
294.40s:  know about because I really don't want to mislead anybody and send them down the wrong
298.40s:  path.
299.40s:  So let's do some homework on that.
306.16s:  I'm just taking a note here so that we can run through it in a little bit.
313.52s:  And then if you have any interesting articles or if you have any posts or anything like
319.48s:  that that you think we should take a look at, let me know because essentially what I know
325.20s:  is I have this up for us to look through.
330.76s:  But I haven't, yeah, so I haven't gone through like it in mass depth yet.
338.40s:  So we'll add this to our list.
340.08s:  I have a list for us.
341.08s:  We'll move that over there.
342.56s:  All right, cool.
343.56s:  Thanks for that idea.
344.56s:  All right, let's start now though with GME and the first thing that we have to talk
353.84s:  about, the easiest thing is starting with a quick look at the chart.
357.12s:  And I always emphasize this point.
360.96s:  GameStop does not behave by the rules with respects to charts.
364.04s:  I know people will say, because I've had people say it to me before like, oh yes, this
368.76s:  person has been kind of spot on all the time or whatever the case is.
374.72s:  And the fact of the matter is is I've already regressed most of the common trading tools
380.12s:  that most traders use.
382.72s:  And it does not corroborate that.
385.16s:  So the thing with something like GameStop that I've learned is that it does have elements
393.04s:  that will follow what we would consider to be more standard technical analysis components
400.08s:  that is unequivocally true.
402.52s:  But what I find specifically with GameStop is that those will exist until they don't
410.12s:  exist.
411.92s:  And that to me is kind of worth things get interesting because it's not as simple
417.24s:  as just apply technical analysis because there isn't really a bucket of technical analysis
424.92s:  that would indicate a lot of what we see GameStop doing until again, it does whatever it
432.08s:  does.
433.24s:  So I just bring that as a general point because I think it's worth at least identifying.
441.64s:  I will continue to conduct technical analysis on GameStop because I think that it's logical
447.04s:  and I think that it makes sense to at least consider it.
450.08s:  And it will, in my opinion, follow that rule set to a degree, but it will follow the
454.80s:  rule set until it doesn't, which makes something like technical analysis really tricky to work
462.48s:  with.
463.48s:  So just a general admin note.
466.08s:  Now one of the things that I we researched this a bit last time and I think it's worth
471.56s:  reiterating, honestly, as many times as we possibly can, one of the things that I have
477.20s:  found continually with GameStop is specifically volume is involved in every move.
487.92s:  I know what a revelation, right?
490.20s:  Like the sky is blue.
491.92s:  Got it.
492.92s:  Yeah, we all know that.
494.56s:  But I don't think we pay enough respect with respect to GameStop because we spend a
500.20s:  lot of time exploring all these other different kinds of potential signals as we should, one
506.92s:  because they're interesting too, because there could be a pretty strong signal there.
511.32s:  But that aside, I think it's kind of important to expand a little bit beyond that and to try
520.16s:  to figure out like tradable signals, right?
523.80s:  And every time I see any sort of movement in GameStop, there's an expansion in volume
529.84s:  that precedes the move, right?
532.60s:  I think it was in the last stream that I was talking about in expansion and volume around
536.28s:  here.
537.28s:  And they're like, yeah, great dude, you just identified that volume expanded on the
540.76s:  day stuff was going on.
542.44s:  But then what I try to highlight to people in that conversation was actually if you look
546.88s:  back even before this move, volume started to expand bigger than its average even before
553.44s:  this move.
555.20s:  So no, it's not this volume.
557.08s:  Obviously, it's not going to be crazy off the Richter scale, but there are still signs.
562.20s:  And what I want you to do is take a look at the volume around these different peaks that
569.28s:  we see at different points in time and then take a look at the volume here, most recently.
575.32s:  This is an crazy big volume, but this volume here is not all too dissimilar to the volume
581.40s:  that we saw here.
583.28s:  Now this volume ended up leading into this trowel.
586.72s:  So again, just because there's volume doesn't mean it's going up.
590.80s:  We don't know exactly what it means.
593.36s:  But you'll also notice almost always the volume is going to be wrapped around an earnings
598.68s:  event in some capacity.
600.12s:  This is common for equities.
601.56s:  Again, there's always exceptions to the rule.
603.80s:  I don't see some sort of mass of volume spike around this one, but I see it here, here,
608.76s:  I see it here still, I see it here, and I see it here.
613.00s:  So volume around earnings is going to be something that's part of this puzzle, and it honestly
618.20s:  confounds the puzzle a little bit.
620.56s:  Because then you kind of have to assess like, okay, well, is it this kind of volume where
625.04s:  we had this volume before earnings last time?
629.08s:  And then after earnings, it started to take Peter off.
633.64s:  Like, it could be that I don't know yet.
637.28s:  But what I do know is this volume here is massive compared to the recent volume.
644.92s:  And again, it's all contextual because when we look at these volume spikes, we might
649.72s:  again, look at this and be like, oh, shit, well, it's only 15 million.
653.72s:  And if you look at this over here, it was 279 million.
658.20s:  That's not the point.
659.20s:  We're missing the point there.
660.36s:  What I'm talking about, oh, sorry, what I'm talking about is a relative volume.
665.04s:  So if we look in this period before this jump up here, the volume on average was like
671.52s:  two and a half million to five million on a five day to 20 day period.
676.48s:  It was much lower.
678.28s:  And then all of a sudden, you'll see it start blowing up.
682.40s:  So it's when we're analyzing anything, but specifically volume in something like this,
688.00s:  we have to pay attention to the conditions around it and not just grossly compare it
693.20s:  to this because we know what's going on here.
696.32s:  This is in the middle of a fucking squeeze where people are trying to avoid getting their
700.24s:  heads ripped off.
701.76s:  So they're going and buying everything that they can.
703.72s:  And this is before we had the at the market.
706.32s:  So there is a ton, a ton of different conditions going on.
710.36s:  So the thing I cautioned, and this is exactly why you'll notice on my charts, I have these
716.04s:  volume averages because it helps me contextualize what I'm looking at.
721.20s:  So if you look in this space right here, I don't know how clear it is, I'll read it out
725.84s:  to you.
726.92s:  But if I go back to the 27th of August, I'm just kind of picking a day here.
733.24s:  The volume for the 27th of August was 4.1 million shares.
738.44s:  And the average volume was 5.5 million for 20 days, trailing 20 days.
744.08s:  And then the average volume for five days, trailing five days was 3.9 million.
748.64s:  Okay.
751.24s:  If we go to the 29th, volume is now 10 million, 10 million, raw volume right out of the
758.54s:  gate over doubled on this day.
762.92s:  And the five day average now moves up to down actually to 5.4 million.
768.60s:  And the five day average now moves up because of this to 5.7 million.
772.84s:  So this is still double the previous volume on a raw basis.
776.84s:  And it's double the averages.
779.76s:  And we have another day of really high volume, the 30th volume now expands to 15.7 million
788.36s:  shares.
789.36s:  The 20 day average had moved up to 5.7 because of the previous day.
794.36s:  And then the five day average, which is going to be more sensitive to recent volume is all
797.56s:  the way up to eight.
798.56s:  It's still essentially double that.
802.12s:  So this kind of scaling volume is fascinating to me.
807.16s:  Now the other thing that again, I approach markets in this, based on my background, right?
812.80s:  Like my undergrad and graduate degree are based around statistics.
815.88s:  It's the way I look at the world.
818.04s:  And when I look at these things, I'm like, okay, cool.
821.08s:  I'm seeing volume starting to grow interesting.
826.12s:  And I got alerts on both of these days.
828.52s:  I obviously, I look at GameStop every day for those recap videos that I've been doing
831.84s:  for us.
832.84s:  But I also still get the alerts for these things.
836.88s:  So now, I'm like, okay, volume essentially has gone from 5 million to 15 over a two
845.24s:  day period.
847.28s:  And earnings is still not yet.
851.08s:  So what I like to do then is say, okay, let's take a look at a historic standpoint where
856.24s:  volume tripled into earnings and how close was it into earnings.
861.52s:  And if we go back to this, I'm hovering so that you can see if you follow this over
867.52s:  here, which just shows the volume for today, I want you to see something volume here,
873.68s:  which was the 26th of March on earnings was 17 million.
877.84s:  Now if I go back one to two days, volume drops to 4 million.
884.28s:  And then if I keep going back, I see 3.9, 3.8, 3.4, 4.4, 2.8, 2.3, 2.1, 3.1, 2.1, 3.8, 3.1,
894.16s:  4.3.
895.44s:  What I'm highlighting to you is going back pretty far from this earnings release.
901.28s:  Volume did not expand.
904.64s:  Here we are still a week out from earnings in volume is expanding.
911.88s:  That's not what happened here.
914.12s:  What happened in this case is earnings was on the 26th.
918.04s:  I can identify volume growing on the 25th.
921.48s:  But as soon as you go outside of the 25th to the 22nd and previous volume has not tripled
927.68s:  the same way that we're seeing here.
930.40s:  So that's why I say this volume expansion reminds me far more of what I see here than
938.08s:  what I see here.
940.64s:  Because here I can clearly identify volume is expanding for earnings.
947.00s:  There is day.
948.00s:  It's the day before earnings.
949.88s:  It's the day of earnings.
951.08s:  It's the day after earnings.
952.72s:  And then it slowly tailors back down.
955.56s:  Very normal earnings volume cycle.
958.40s:  That's not the case for this.
960.92s:  Because we're still ways out from earnings, which is on the 10th.
966.28s:  That's still.
967.28s:  It's not even next week.
969.28s:  It's the following week.
971.44s:  So we have a ways to go again, temporally, not super far.
975.72s:  But for this volume to triple, I find that very, very interesting.
981.68s:  So what I want to do actually with you all is I want to do a little bit of a study.
987.32s:  I haven't done it yet.
988.32s:  I can do it now as we're talking.
990.64s:  And what I'm going to do is again, I'm going to go to bar chart because I have an account
997.56s:  with them.
998.64s:  I'm going to go to the story data here.
1006.64s:  And I'm going to grab daily game stop data.
1011.00s:  Again, going back to 2000.
1012.76s:  And again, I know I don't think game stop even goes back that far.
1016.24s:  But I just use the default date window that's generally all encompassing.
1020.04s:  The reason why I'm re-downloading this data is so that it's essentially raw.
1028.32s:  So I have that now and we can take a look at a few things.
1032.92s:  I'm going to add a filter here and now we can take a look through together.
1041.60s:  Let me squish this down.
1043.76s:  And also I need to correct myself because last time I did this with chat GPT and somebody
1050.80s:  noted in the comments that what I talked about in the live stream was wrong.
1054.72s:  And I looked back at it and it was, it was completely wrong.
1058.04s:  So I ran it through chat GPT and I was talking to you guys about it on the last live stream
1062.56s:  about volume expansion and it was not accurate.
1064.88s:  I have to call myself out because again, like I don't want to give you guys bad information.
1068.92s:  It surprised me because it's a really simple ask that I had of chat GPT when I provided
1073.48s:  the source file.
1076.88s:  But it was still wrong.
1078.60s:  So I have to correct that.
1081.88s:  And then also I have to take some drugs now because the old sciatica is still going.
1090.00s:  Rock on for that.
1094.20s:  And the drink of choice is, as you already know, mango orange spin drift.
1100.44s:  That's the way to do it.
1104.20s:  So yeah, let's take a look here.
1107.32s:  What I want to do is simply look at a day over day change in volume day over day, day
1114.56s:  over day volume delta.
1122.16s:  And then I'm literally just going to figure out as a percentage.
1127.64s:  So this minus this divided by this will turn this into a percent.
1135.52s:  I got a wideness out a little bit so I can see my tools easier.
1138.88s:  We want a percent.
1140.92s:  And I typically like two decimals and then we'll drag that all the way down.
1147.52s:  And then I'm going to filter this again.
1151.76s:  I have to widen this out so that all my ship pops up.
1155.76s:  Okay.
1156.76s:  Data will add that filter.
1161.16s:  So what I want to do now is not that.
1165.24s:  What I want to do now is simply look at periods where volume moved greater.
1172.00s:  Let's call it greater than 50%.
1175.52s:  So we can do greater than and we'll do an or so we'll do greater than or less than.
1190.60s:  And we'll do greater than 50% and then we will do negative 50%.
1200.84s:  So now what I'm doing is just seeing how frequently this happens again and this is going
1207.26s:  back to the origin of GameStop.
1210.20s:  So there's 1391 instances.
1214.36s:  So it's too much for us to reasonably look through again on the livestream so I don't
1218.20s:  want to waste a bunch of your time.
1219.84s:  So shout out to the apes.
1220.84s:  There's over a hundred of us hanging out right now learning about GameStop.
1224.60s:  So shout out to you guys.
1226.00s:  I literally can't think of a better way to spend Saturday afternoon slash evening, then
1232.40s:  diving into this stuff.
1233.40s:  It's actually kind of fun.
1234.56s:  It's one of the really cool things about the internet because if you think about it,
1239.32s:  like there's not that many people at least around my immediate social circle that are super
1243.88s:  interested in this stuff.
1245.20s:  All my friends or Marines who I love to death, I take a bullet for them, but they're not
1251.04s:  so interested in talking about this.
1253.28s:  So the ability to connect with people literally all over the world.
1257.00s:  Actually, I'm curious for those that are in the chat now, where are you from?
1261.84s:  That's typically that's kind of like a fun exercise because I found in a few instances
1265.44s:  where people are from way different places than I would have expected.
1270.44s:  We got Michigan, California.
1272.72s:  Hey, I'm in California.
1274.52s:  Ohio, Jersey, the city, PEI, I don't know PEI.
1279.92s:  Indiana, North Carolina, Pacific Northwest.
1282.60s:  Is that like Seattle?
1284.52s:  Kentucky, the city.
1287.36s:  I have a buddy that lives in Long Island City for B Williams.
1292.88s:  Pennsylvania, my uncle, he lives by Matt Amores, Pennsylvania.
1296.04s:  We got Belgium.
1298.04s:  Utah.
1299.04s:  Hey, we were looking, Roy and Clity, what up?
1302.80s:  Utah.
1304.36s:  We were not, we were looking at Utah.
1306.96s:  Rubin from Norway.
1308.12s:  I was literally, literally just in Norway.
1310.92s:  That was my last trip.
1312.92s:  Korea, Vegas.
1315.00s:  Like this is the cool part, man.
1317.32s:  Like people from all over the freaking place.
1320.60s:  Vegas, Alberta, a Wahoo, my in-laws, they have a place on Kauai.
1326.92s:  So we go to Kauai pretty regularly.
1330.44s:  Fuck it.
1332.40s:  Lost in translation.
1333.56s:  That's such a great name for being from fuck it.
1337.36s:  Scotland, Connecticut.
1339.96s:  Yeah, it's incredible.
1341.36s:  Maryland by DC.
1342.80s:  Yo, there's another person from the Pacific Northwest for whoever said that before.
1347.92s:  H is also from there.
1349.76s:  Black swans from Ottawa.
1351.76s:  AT says they live near Matt Amores.
1353.32s:  That's hilarious.
1354.16s:  Yeah, that's literally like my uncle and I whenever I go back to New York, we'll go walk.
1359.80s:  What is it? Ding ding ding ding.
1361.96s:  Min's falls or something like that.
1364.76s:  I think that's what it is.
1366.60s:  I could tell you the one second.
1368.40s:  I could tell you the general region that he lives around.
1372.28s:  I'm just curious how close you are because it's hilarious.
1378.48s:  So he lives by what is this region?
1384.36s:  Birch Birchwood lakes.
1387.92s:  And he's by.
1389.84s:  Yeah, so he's by Dingman's very gold key lake.
1395.12s:  Yeah, AT that's yeah, that's exactly where he's around.
1398.92s:  That's hilarious.
1402.28s:  Whoa, Rebel Darkside.
1403.96s:  I'm in San Diego dog.
1406.04s:  Where and Clity says, what were you looking at Utah for?
1408.40s:  Moving.
1410.12s:  Yeah, my wife and I were looking at potentially bouncing out of San Diego in the near term,
1415.88s:  at least somewhat semi near term, like maybe next two, three years.
1419.16s:  So we were looking at Reno.
1420.72s:  We were looking at Utah and we were looking at Colorado.
1423.80s:  Those are the three leaders so far.
1426.80s:  Ricky says Salt Lake City's a dope city.
1428.40s:  Yeah, Salt Lake City was cool.
1429.48s:  I don't like living in cities personally.
1430.92s:  It was going to be like in the suburbs on the outside.
1433.80s:  If that's where we do end up.
1435.96s:  But yeah, Sean's in Florida.
1438.48s:  That's super cool.
1439.80s:  Ben says what part of Colorado?
1441.48s:  Yeah, so for Colorado, we were looking at outside of Denver.
1447.56s:  So everywhere from Fort Collins down south to Colorado Springs.
1452.44s:  So right now leaning towards Colorado Springs, I think.
1456.40s:  Vladimir says Reno, yeah, yeah, Reno, Nevada.
1459.76s:  Willie says what made you reconsider California?
1463.36s:  It's just because there's a lot of things about the state that don't resonate with me.
1467.72s:  I have, I really like cars and I have like a built Corvette C7 that is, I have to play
1473.24s:  all these different games because they have really strict regulations on what you can
1476.92s:  do to your cars.
1477.92s:  I like shooting a lot.
1479.36s:  It like obviously from my background, but even from growing up.
1482.32s:  It's like difficult to go shooting here.
1484.08s:  So one of my plans is wherever I move, I'm going to buy a little bit of property that
1487.60s:  I can set up a shooting range.
1489.68s:  It's just all those little kind of things like that.
1493.08s:  So yeah, it's, it's a little bit of a break.
1496.32s:  So funny part is is like most people think that San Diego has like the nicest weather on
1500.40s:  earth and it has beautiful weather.
1502.68s:  But the funny part is is like if you'll notice the places I tend to go on vacation, like
1507.64s:  the last trip was to Norway, the trip to before that was to Iceland.
1512.48s:  Like I'm not going for, I don't really care for the weather.
1515.88s:  I don't like it.
1516.88s:  It's on a sun.
1517.88s:  I don't mind the sun obviously, but I don't like it hot.
1520.12s:  I am very much Nordic in descent.
1523.20s:  So yeah, it's not, not my vibe.
1527.64s:  Vladimir says in, in the Vodans, that of speeding tickets, they give you an access of use of fuel
1532.44s:  citation.
1533.44s:  That's hilarious.
1534.80s:  If that's actually a thing, that is hilarious.
1538.20s:  Ben says an old company used to book me flights from Colorado Springs to Denver and maybe
1542.12s:  look like a super wealthy person because private flight, but it was just because company
1545.80s:  dumped that's so funny.
1547.28s:  Yeah, because those two are pretty close together from what I've seen.
1550.00s:  I've been to Denver.
1551.00s:  I haven't spent much time around Colorado Springs yet.
1554.92s:  We're actually going to do like a remote week there sometime to get a vibe check and see
1561.96s:  if we like it.
1562.96s:  So yeah, the cool part and the point of this exercise, if you take a look through this,
1568.52s:  like we have people literally from all over.
1571.76s:  Gregor says, where's Newton?
1572.96s:  I think he's chilling with his fam right now.
1575.48s:  Yeah.
1576.80s:  So Newton is, he and I have been talking, I'm not sure when we'll be able to line up on
1581.76s:  a live stream together.
1583.28s:  It's still something that we both are interested in, but he's kicking off a new schedule with
1587.88s:  work and stuff and it's just a lot for him because he still wants to do his daily videos.
1593.76s:  And then to and his daily videos are not short.
1596.16s:  They're like 20, 30 minutes.
1599.04s:  And then his job is kicked off again and then he has the family.
1602.36s:  So the times like now when he and I would be linking up, it's kind of time away from
1607.24s:  his family.
1608.56s:  So I think that we are going to try to find a point at some point that lines up again.
1616.36s:  But yeah, right now he and I are primarily just communicating via text, keeping up with
1621.92s:  one another.
1622.92s:  But yeah, I try to, I try to make it flexible for him, but I mean, the dude is busy and
1628.84s:  I totally, totally understand.
1630.40s:  I'm fortunate that I have a pretty flexible schedule, but I totally respect that he's got
1637.36s:  a lot going on.
1639.04s:  So yeah, he and I still talk were obviously sharing ideas and kind of exploring things together.
1645.16s:  We were literally just talking about a couple new thesis and some of the research that I'm
1648.24s:  doing that I'm going to talk to you about.
1649.56s:  I don't know why I keep hitting the mic.
1651.12s:  Sorry about that.
1653.40s:  But yeah, he, he's just been busy.
1658.84s:  Rebel Darksides, I think Newton lives in San Diego also he doesn't, he's further north.
1667.32s:  Mia says, what's your take on option alpha or any auto trading platforms have you dug
1671.04s:  into it?
1672.04s:  Yeah, so I actually did an interview with Kirk not too long ago.
1674.32s:  I had him on my podcast and it's nothing I do.
1678.12s:  So I can't speak intelligently to it is to like whether or not it's efficacious or
1682.36s:  not I could see it being useful for some people, but it's definitely not.
1688.44s:  It's not for me is the way I would look at.
1691.20s:  Okay, so what I want to do now is actually create a little bit of a distribution here.
1697.20s:  So I'll do like count of percent ranges.
1704.80s:  And then I'm going to do count if we'll count these.
1711.24s:  And what do we want to do?
1712.24s:  Do we want to do it like?
1717.32s:  Let's do like greater than 100% to start.
1721.16s:  Let's see if this works.
1722.96s:  Oops.
1723.96s:  My bad.
1730.76s:  So 455.
1735.28s:  And then let's do.
1748.08s:  So that's actually interesting.
1752.72s:  So there's way more.
1753.72s:  I mean, I honestly think we can just filter this then by 100% get rid of the so we'll do
1760.72s:  one or less than one.
1766.40s:  And let's count these.
1770.12s:  So 455 up.
1771.12s:  So that lines up as expected.
1774.72s:  So now this is kind of a more palatable figure.
1778.04s:  So now what I would do is actually sort this by largest to smallest.
1785.56s:  I'm going to get rid of the negative integers for now just because I don't care.
1790.68s:  So I'm just going to do greater than 100 only.
1796.96s:  I'll count these.
1800.04s:  That gives us 365.
1802.08s:  So funny enough out of that 455 that were greater than 100 the vast majority of them were
1806.20s:  positive anyways.
1808.80s:  And now let's sort this.
1814.32s:  We don't know why it's doing that with the sorting kind of annoying.
1824.32s:  It's not letting me sort on top of it, which makes me angry.
1830.92s:  Maybe we can sort by date.
1835.04s:  And still it.
1837.96s:  Why is it keep doing that?
1840.68s:  Up that right now.
1843.40s:  Oh, because it's up God.
1846.52s:  I hate myself sometimes.
1848.96s:  Oh no, it's still doing it right.
1854.88s:  Yeah, it's still doing it completely right.
1862.64s:  Interesting.
1863.28s:  Anyways, so let's just take a look through these.
1867.36s:  And let's find some of the higher figures like this.
1875.84s:  We're like this.
1877.88s:  This was in 2023.
1879.44s:  Did anything interesting happen in 2023 in here?
1882.48s:  Take a look.
1885.52s:  I think what I need is you guys know where I can get like a historic chart that lets me look
1894.08s:  at the chart.
1895.28s:  Well, I guess I could just use on demand never mind.
1897.44s:  We'll see if it works.
1899.76s:  There's always a big question.
1905.16s:  I just want to see what this period looks like.
1907.68s:  It was in 2023.
1910.12s:  That saw a massive is the 29th of November in 2023.
1915.48s:  So I'm going to take a quick look at that.
1919.24s:  The 29th of November.
1924.88s:  Yeah, big pop.
1927.88s:  Which is interesting because this one looks like a bit of a standalone if I'm not mistaken.
1939.24s:  Tanner says 2023 had October,
1941.76s:  volume November, volume March, volume, but besides that nothing.
1944.40s:  Yeah, which is fascinating, right?
1946.40s:  Because I can see this September volume that's starting to kick off, but it does.
1951.60s:  I can't tell what it's from.
1952.84s:  I'm going to fast forward to December just so I can see the period around it.
1956.80s:  Oh, earnings.
1958.80s:  There it is.
1961.28s:  So this had earnings on the sixth and volume started to expand on the 28th.
1966.84s:  So still this is not an example of what we're seeing right now, which is really interesting.
1976.96s:  Which is really, really interesting.
1979.16s:  So as I'm kind of just, you know, quickly glossing over this, there's what I'm doing right
1983.80s:  now has zero statistical efficacy or rigor.
1987.04s:  I'm just kind of spot checking a couple random things real fast.
1991.52s:  Just because like for me to actually do this process, it takes a while and I have some
1995.72s:  of it done in Tableau already, but I haven't finished overlaying some of the other data
2001.48s:  points that I'm really interested in.
2003.04s:  It's like the FTD cycles or things like not FTDs.
2013.04s:  What else am I swaps?
2016.32s:  That's it.
2017.32s:  Sorry.
2018.32s:  Had a bit of a brain sees there or the swaps.
2020.96s:  So it's just not done yet.
2023.04s:  But so what I'm looking at though are different periods were volume essentially is expanded
2030.04s:  meaningfully over the previous day.
2033.64s:  And I'm looking for periods where it is at least greater than 100%.
2041.60s:  And what I'm able to identify by this are other instances where we're seeing at least
2047.84s:  somewhat similar price movement to what we're seeing now and what it's predicated on.
2052.84s:  So if I take a look at another period, I can bring this back over so you can see what
2057.60s:  I'm doing.
2058.60s:  So I'm just picking random periods.
2060.56s:  So like this one here, I want to see if this is where earnings was.
2065.24s:  So instead of going in on demand yet, I'm going to focus on finding periods where it's
2069.12s:  not earnings in close proximity.
2074.28s:  All of the other earnings markers there we go.
2076.64s:  Okay.
2077.64s:  So we have seven June like these definitely this is definitely something.
2083.64s:  I see, I mean, that's just interesting.
2090.12s:  Look at this.
2092.04s:  Just from a volume perspective, seven June, seven July, eight August.
2099.92s:  That's a really tight range over a three day period or three month period consistently
2106.84s:  with really high volumes.
2108.44s:  So this tells me this isn't earnings, right?
2110.52s:  Because earnings doesn't happen that many times in such a consolidated period.
2114.36s:  So these periods here are now just interesting to me.
2118.08s:  I want to know what is going on here.
2122.00s:  So we'll go back.
2123.64s:  Let's start with eight, eight, 22.
2127.84s:  And the whole idea behind this just so that you understand why I'm doing this, the whole
2131.08s:  goal here is again, this is me fingerprinting.
2134.64s:  I'm getting a series of reference periods so that I can better understand the price
2140.60s:  and volume movement that we're seeing right now relative to this move.
2144.08s:  It's exactly why I'm doing this.
2146.20s:  So what I'm going to do now is go back in on demand and we're going to go back to 2022.
2152.88s:  And we will start in August, eighth.
2158.24s:  And then we know for the previous three months that there is pretty significant movements.
2164.16s:  And again, this starts to make more sense now.
2167.72s:  So when I look at the split, this is normal.
2175.52s:  This would typically spur some sort of movement.
2180.48s:  This right here looks completely random to me.
2184.96s:  So from the sixth, volume was at 9.9.
2194.36s:  And then on the seventh, it goes to 30.
2198.28s:  Why?
2204.32s:  I don't understand why that happened there.
2207.72s:  That seems random to me.
2211.16s:  The movement that I see in May is way more logical because I can see that that's tied to earnings.
2225.64s:  Ruben says the Ranger describing with volume is something new and others have gone into
2229.72s:  your correct to tie it to earnings.
2232.72s:  Yeah, so but the maybe you can help me out here, Ruben.
2236.36s:  Vladimir off Putin says can't read the dates.
2238.80s:  So right now I'm looking at 2022.
2241.36s:  So right now the chart is set to be August, eighth, 2022.
2247.08s:  And then all I'm doing is looking back at these reference periods, right?
2252.52s:  So the 8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 7, because like that's something.
2257.52s:  I don't know what it is, but it's something.
2259.64s:  The fact that that is such a regimented cadence for volume to happen to expand month over
2266.12s:  a month around the same exact time frame.
2268.80s:  So for example, when I'm looking at this, this is where I start thinking something about
2273.52s:  swaps.
2274.92s:  However, the problem with the swaps at least so far from what I've researched in GameStop
2280.52s:  is what I try to tell people is when I'm looking at things from a statistical standpoint,
2286.32s:  I'm not trying to look for what I'm looking for.
2289.48s:  I'm simply trying to analyze and see what comes up.
2292.96s:  So what that means is when I grabbed the swap data that I could for GameStop, which
2297.56s:  took me back into 2022, rather than trying to see what count period aligns with stock movements
2308.52s:  and swap explorations, it was essentially inconclusive.
2312.48s:  There's some levels of correlation in some instances, but it doesn't pass any T-test.
2317.24s:  There's no confidence interval I can assign to it and say like, yeah, this is reasonably
2322.36s:  presumative or a reasonable signal for some sort of stock movement because you also can't
2327.44s:  even fully isolate it.
2329.64s:  So that's one of the issues that I see with swap.
2332.28s:  So in here, when I look at this eight, eight date, I don't know why it's surging here.
2338.72s:  This doesn't fully make sense to me.
2340.84s:  When I look at seven, seven, I don't understand this either because typically when I see
2347.44s:  this split, when did this split happen?
2351.32s:  The 22nd.
2353.52s:  And there's not a meaningful movement of volume around the split.
2359.56s:  So I can't attribute it to the split.
2362.84s:  I can't attribute it to an earnings release here or here because there wasn't one.
2369.72s:  Again, this move back in May or on the 1st of June, I can attribute the preemptive
2376.48s:  move here to earnings.
2378.16s:  Volume started expanding on the 25th.
2381.16s:  Earnings was what, five, six days later?
2383.08s:  Like that's fine.
2384.08s:  That's super, super normal.
2386.16s:  And expecting a big movement in the underlying leading into earnings is completely normal.
2390.92s:  Now what's not normal are these movements.
2394.16s:  And I can't quite put my finger onto why these movements are occurring.
2401.56s:  Tanner says.
2403.40s:  Eric, go scroll up.
2405.40s:  I have exact dates for you to check out.
2407.48s:  Check out the volume spikes on those dates.
2410.68s:  Sure.
2411.68s:  Here we go.
2413.96s:  I'm going to copy Tanner's comment down here.
2421.16s:  And we can take a look at these together.
2423.96s:  The issue with doing this though is that it's like we're form fitting what we're looking
2429.00s:  for.
2430.00s:  Right?
2431.00s:  I want to find this.
2432.84s:  So I'm not exactly sure what we're hoping to find with these.
2437.20s:  But let's see.
2440.00s:  223.21.
2442.44s:  So let me get rid of this filter.
2444.84s:  I'm going to clear that.
2447.36s:  Clear those.
2448.84s:  And then I'll sort it by date so I can find them.
2451.96s:  And then let's go to 23 Feb 21.
2461.00s:  So 23 Feb 21, I don't know why this is all fucked up.
2472.60s:  But 23 Feb 21 here shows a negative.
2477.76s:  Oh no, I'm sorry.
2479.80s:  Yeah, it shows a volume drop over the previous day.
2482.84s:  It looks like it dropped 61%.
2486.84s:  So I don't see a specific or I don't see it's like a let me know what I'm looking
2499.08s:  for.
2500.08s:  So I don't know what I'm supposed to find.
2502.28s:  Or do you mean the 24th?
2508.80s:  Because the 24th saw a big volume spike.
2512.40s:  The 24th volume spike, almost a thousand percent.
2515.44s:  So a big spike.
2517.76s:  Yeah.
2518.76s:  So let's significant about the 24th in your opinion.
2523.40s:  Let's go there.
2525.20s:  Let's go this.
2526.20s:  I'm looking at 21 right?
2527.52s:  Yeah, let's go to 21.
2529.64s:  And then let's go to February 20th.
2531.40s:  I'm going to go a little bit past it so that we can kind of see how it flows.
2535.92s:  Yeah, I mean, this is a squeeze to me.
2541.04s:  Like that's that's exactly what this is here in my opinion.
2544.64s:  So if I were looking at this and trying to identify the reason behind this kickoff
2554.16s:  and price movement.
2556.80s:  This is a squeeze.
2558.12s:  Yeah, that's exactly what I see here for whatever reason, but that's what I see here.
2563.68s:  And again, like I try to identify for you all, one of the really cool things about
2568.44s:  this and the use of volume is take a look.
2575.64s:  Look at the volume here.
2580.48s:  The volume front runs the entire squeeze.
2584.28s:  You can see it run up here.
2585.96s:  It contracts.
2587.16s:  And I also notice this is pretty common for the larger moves and game stop at least
2592.64s:  from what I've seen so far is it looks like there's typically these two spikes.
2600.44s:  Most of them I see this pattern where there's a spike.
2603.60s:  It calms down and then typically within like two weeks, three weeks, it starts another
2608.80s:  spike that then will typically calm back down, which I can't help but find that interesting.
2617.04s:  Vladimir off Putin.
2618.04s:  That's so funny.
2619.04s:  Vladimir off Putin says remember that D.F.V. was still posting in February 2021.
2622.84s:  Let's think about that would be also very interesting to see what kind of positions
2628.24s:  he had on around this point.
2631.16s:  I have his page linked on my to do list.
2638.04s:  Here we go.
2641.68s:  And then I can expand this.
2643.88s:  So let's take a look.
2647.60s:  January February.
2648.60s:  So this is interesting.
2652.60s:  Oh, that's funny.
2657.20s:  So he used to post in Wall Street bets.
2661.20s:  22 47.
2665.20s:  Three, two, three, one, one.
2677.96s:  So what I'm doing now is I'm just getting a sense of these different posts.
2684.64s:  And to see because like you can see that he was hovering right around that one, one
2689.00s:  to three mill mark for a long time, right?
2691.96s:  973, one.
2693.60s:  Anyways, going back up here.
2697.60s:  We need to be in here.
2710.52s:  Web 19th, Web 3rd, Web 2nd.
2721.72s:  So this started like the end of Jan.
2725.72s:  Did he have anything there?
2729.28s:  He did.
2730.28s:  Jan 28th.
2731.96s:  So let's see how far back he goes here.
2735.48s:  25th, 22 19th.
2738.68s:  So the move really started on the 13th.
2741.52s:  Let's see how far back he goes.
2742.92s:  The 11th.
2744.92s:  The 5th.
2749.40s:  Here.
2752.40s:  December 31st here.
2755.84s:  See, this is fascinating because I obviously love this dude.
2762.08s:  I have a ton, a ton of respect for him.
2767.08s:  But and I know that we like to say, you know, things like he's a he's a time traveler and
2771.84s:  stuff like that.
2772.84s:  I get it.
2773.84s:  It's like partially we're having fun.
2776.48s:  But this here shows me that like the timing is not quite as perfect as I even thought
2784.88s:  it was.
2786.64s:  And that's not I want to be so clear.
2789.00s:  I am not diminishing what he does or what he's done.
2793.48s:  I'm just trying to be accurate in my assessment of the timing because otherwise like I mentally
2802.08s:  started just assuming that his timing was perpetually perfect somehow.
2808.28s:  And that leads me down a different cognitive thought process in terms of what signals
2813.48s:  were using and how we're doing it.
2816.00s:  But the fact that the timing isn't quite as perfect as I was mentally modeling, it tells
2824.60s:  me a few things exactly as Cedric is talking about.
2828.20s:  It seems like a little bit more of an exploratory kind of thing.
2833.08s:  But it also tells me that there's not this highly predictable thing that he's operating
2839.70s:  off of with pure accuracy.
2842.80s:  Which again, it's just important for me to know that because it helps frame the rest
2848.16s:  of my research knowing that to be generally the case because that is generally the case
2853.48s:  here.
2854.48s:  Like if he had some sort of, you know, if he had to hit some sort of like near perfect
2862.80s:  methodology for entering an exiting, it would tell me a lot about the kind of triggers
2868.28s:  or signals that he was using.
2871.96s:  So when I look at this though, I can see that he started entering even all the way back
2877.76s:  on like mid December.
2880.60s:  And if we go into December, there just isn't a whole lot going on here.
2885.00s:  Price is moving, but it's not moving a ton.
2889.24s:  So what this tells me is that obviously he has his pulse on something.
2895.36s:  He has the pulse of something.
2896.68s:  I don't know what that he clearly is looking at because there is some sort of move that
2902.48s:  happens generally to poorly to where he's operating.
2907.20s:  But it's not like this perfect timing thing.
2911.32s:  And I also think that's really important for us to think about as we're conducting our
2915.96s:  research.
2917.24s:  Because if we look at all the different research that we're running right now, we're trying
2921.72s:  to identify essentially to this specific day that something should or should not happen.
2930.36s:  And as I'm looking at this, I actually am starting to change my opinion that rather
2935.68s:  than looking at a specific day that we think something should or should not happen, that
2941.56s:  we should be looking at specific windows.
2946.08s:  That starts to become a thought for me because otherwise the timing at least on those first
2955.84s:  initial plays would definitely be better.
2959.16s:  Again, I just want to be so clear.
2960.84s:  I'm not saying the timing is bad, the trading is bad, nothing like that.
2964.68s:  I'm just talking about in terms of if I had a really strong hypothesis that something
2971.56s:  was going to happen on X date, let's call it T30, 30 days from now.
2978.00s:  I wouldn't start building a position this second.
2981.88s:  I would, even if it's a big position, I would wait a little bit longer until I get closer
2987.88s:  to the effect that I'm trying to trade.
2991.68s:  It's like earnings.
2992.84s:  I know earnings has certain behaviors as an options trader that I can take advantage
2998.00s:  of.
2999.00s:  Starting two weeks out, implied volatility is going to start expanding into earnings.
3004.40s:  I know this.
3006.40s:  Then I also know, after earnings, volatility is going to contract to a degree.
3013.80s:  So understanding that volatility is going to contract through earnings, if earnings is
3020.08s:  on the 15th of the month, I'm not going to put the position on the 15th of the previous
3025.96s:  month for the earnings effect on the 15th of the following month.
3030.20s:  It doesn't make sense to me.
3032.08s:  Now, conversely, if I'm looking at the run up into earnings that two week period, that's
3038.28s:  not a perfect window.
3039.88s:  And it actually varies quite a bit.
3042.24s:  So I might put that trade on 20 days early.
3045.48s:  I might put it on 10 days early.
3047.72s:  I might put it on 14 days early leading into earnings.
3051.68s:  It's more of a window.
3053.56s:  So part of me thinks that while we're conducting a lot of this research, trying to pinpoint
3060.80s:  like specific days, I actually think we might want to start looking at it in terms of
3067.48s:  windows.
3069.04s:  Because again, like I can see from this positioning in this time frame, whether or not that's
3074.92s:  exactly what he was looking at that was going to cause this.
3077.36s:  I obviously don't know.
3079.12s:  But it tells me that this isn't some hyper pinpoint accuracy system.
3084.24s:  This is something that's kind of based on more of a window that I find really, really interesting.
3090.76s:  So I find I find that curious and I find a lot of the work we're doing to be interesting.
3101.28s:  But it tells me that I think we should probably start looking more so at an X period window,
3109.32s:  whether it's a five day window, 10 day window.
3111.60s:  I'm not sure yet.
3112.60s:  I have to do a little bit of digging on that.
3116.44s:  But we've been spending so much time trying to pinpoint, okay, the swaps are coming
3121.04s:  do or the FTDs are coming do on this day.
3124.28s:  So then tomorrow we should see a big move.
3127.32s:  And it just typically doesn't pan out that way.
3130.84s:  If we can start thinking of it more so as based on these effects that are going on,
3136.64s:  it's likely to impact the market during some period, some 10 day window.
3141.52s:  To me, that makes a lot of sense.
3143.96s:  Now again, the interesting part here is I know a lot of people are doing this and they
3150.12s:  want to like be the person that like gets it right or like gets the specific day or
3154.32s:  you know, cracks the code, whatever it is.
3156.20s:  And that's cool.
3157.20s:  That's totally fine to want to do.
3159.28s:  As I look at it from a trading perspective, I actually don't really think that that
3164.12s:  matters quite as much.
3169.20s:  And it probably leads most of us astray from a pretty, from a, like a pretty
3176.96s:  tradable window, I think.
3179.44s:  Roinclady says I could be wrong, but it sounds like you're assuming RK is making his
3182.80s:  plays off of these hidden cycles.
3184.68s:  That's also no, no, yeah, I'm glad you called that out.
3187.56s:  That's, that's not, that's not what I mean at all.
3191.12s:  I, because I have no idea what he's looking at.
3193.80s:  I genuinely don't.
3195.28s:  So yeah, thank you for calling that out Roinclady.
3197.48s:  I don't want to make it sound like I think that he's looking at swaps or FTDs or whatever.
3201.72s:  I have no idea.
3204.20s:  I have no idea.
3206.08s:  I'm just saying that he's looking at something, some effect or some signal.
3211.60s:  That's what I believe.
3213.04s:  What it is, I genuinely don't know.
3215.60s:  I really don't.
3216.80s:  But again, this tells me that it's not a hyper specific window that he's looking at.
3223.60s:  I don't think.
3225.48s:  So the other thing I look at is like this looks generally around when he's, you know,
3234.20s:  still staying active, the fifth, the 11th, the 13th, right?
3238.60s:  So he's just kind of updating.
3244.72s:  Yeah.
3246.36s:  Updating updating updating semi-regular cadence.
3251.00s:  20th,
3252.92s:  Bab, right?
3254.24s:  So like this is all persistent exposure if you think about it.
3258.36s:  So just about all of this.
3262.60s:  All of this that I see here, it looks like just standard.
3266.32s:  He's maintaining exposure of some sort.
3268.12s:  Yeah, because he has like the April 18th, 10 call the April 18th.
3272.16s:  So what was going on in April 18th of 21?
3276.20s:  Was that earnings?
3278.48s:  Let's fast forward this.
3282.28s:  I'll just go to the NMA.
3285.88s:  No, not earnings.
3292.04s:  April 18th.
3294.24s:  So standard options expiration for April.
3298.00s:  I don't know why.
3302.00s:  I don't know why we pick that 16 April.
3310.00s:  Why do we pick that?
3311.00s:  When do we add those?
3316.00s:  Oh, shit, he added those a while ago.
3319.00s:  They're all the way back here.
3321.00s:  January, they're all the way back here in 2020.
3327.00s:  Okay, so this is just a persistent leverage position.
3330.00s:  That's what this tells me.
3332.00s:  So he's adding these, these longer dated calls here, right?
3337.00s:  Because these are for April and he put them back on in 2020.
3340.00s:  Let's see how far back we go.
3342.00s:  Yeah, man, that's annoying.
3343.00s:  I'm just going to start from here.
3345.00s:  Yeah, they were already on here.
3348.00s:  So in this case, all the way back in September.
3350.00s:  And again, this, this to me aligns with more of the first
3355.00s:  of the last two days.
3357.00s:  And I think that's what I think is the most important thing
3361.00s:  is that most of the positions I've seen him put on as I go through his posts.
3364.00s:  Look like they're further out in time, not always super far, but not like two days.
3369.00s:  Most of them are like a month of at least a few weeks, a month, a way over a month.
3373.00s:  In this case.
3374.00s:  So in this scenario, when I see that he's put on these April calls all the way back at least in September.
3384.00s:  And he's just a leveraged position, right?
3386.00s:  So and you can tell that he likes to buy and round lots.
3389.00s:  That's super normal.
3390.00s:  But in this case, he's essentially using all of his money, right?
3394.00s:  So we can see that he has some shares, 10,000 shares, only $86,000 of his account are here.
3401.00s:  This is also very fascinating to me because from my understanding.
3406.00s:  I think you guys explain to me that the community, I think it was super stonk or one of the
3413.00s:  that was like really skeptical of options, right?
3416.00s:  Is that accurate?
3417.00s:  Because I think you guys, I think you guys were telling me that like nobody wanted to hear anything about options that are that like there was some sort of problem.
3424.00s:  If you talked about options, but.
3427.00s:  Okay, so yeah, it was super stonk got it.
3431.00s:  And I find this really interesting because.
3437.00s:  Obviously he literally has the bulk of his money in options.
3444.00s:  This is quite literally how he created wealth like straight up.
3449.00s:  So because you can see the total value of the portfolio here for the shares is $86,000.
3458.00s:  The total value of the portfolio is 973 with 8K and cash.
3464.00s:  The rest of that is options.
3466.00s:  This is all options.
3467.00s:  He's trading.
3468.00s:  He's trading this leveraged to the upside is what I see.
3473.00s:  And that's why he would have this kind of exposure.
3478.00s:  Is simply for leverage like that's 100% what I see here.
3483.00s:  Which is really interesting.
3486.00s:  Yeah, man.
3488.00s:  He had those calls all the way back in August.
3498.00s:  No precise target just up.
3500.00s:  Yep, that makes sense.
3503.00s:  Yeah.
3505.00s:  So.
3507.00s:  One of the most interesting things about this that the more I look at it the more I identify is that.
3514.00s:  He is just so willing to take these hyper concentrated risk positions.
3522.00s:  Which is crazy.
3531.00s:  Yeah, it's mostly options, man.
3534.00s:  Even back when he had low baby account.
3541.00s:  That's interesting.
3543.00s:  So he really did use options to essentially just as leverage alongside that's super interesting.
3551.00s:  Cetric says lots of people got burned over the years super strong said no more options.
3555.00s:  Yeah, that's a bummer because you can kind of tell like as I was looking through this that that's the bulk of what he did.
3561.00s:  I didn't know that I literally would not have guessed that based on what.
3566.00s:  Again, the way that the community has kind of taught me so far.
3570.00s:  I wouldn't have guessed that the bulk of this is done through options.
3580.00s:  So this is like literally I can tell even from this post is that he's just essentially staying.
3588.00s:  And he's.
3591.00s:  Hyper concentrated in an individual position.
3596.00s:  Yeah.
3602.00s:  Very interesting.
3608.00s:  And he went through some really rough times.
3612.00s:  Because this account is oscillated quite a lot.
3629.00s:  It's been me diversifying across strikes.
3632.00s:  So this is super normal.
3636.00s:  Yeah, right.
3638.00s:  This is so funny.
3640.00s:  So this highlights exactly what I kind of expected right is that this he he likes to be super concentrated.
3648.00s:  But in my opinion, such actions may have also reduced my estimated return.
3652.00s:  So the dude is like laser focused on a thesis he believes in.
3656.00s:  And it's like balls to the wall to the return.
3659.00s:  It's not like not really caring about the risk.
3662.00s:  Like this right like to make more money.
3665.00s:  He's keeping that super super simple.
3671.00s:  Oh, hell yeah, here we go.
3673.00s:  Well, where was that I'm jacked to the tits.
3675.00s:  That's what I'm talking about.
3677.00s:  We need some need some leverage here.
3679.00s:  Yeah, see like look at this 117,000.
3681.00s:  It's all over the place.
3689.00s:  The industry of gaming.
3691.00s:  So he's still doing a lot of like background research on.
3699.00s:  What he thinks.
3703.00s:  Oh man, this is fascinating.
3707.00s:  I've not gone back this far yet.
3710.00s:  Is this the beginning?
3711.00s:  Yeah, it looks like the beginning.
3716.00s:  113,000.
3722.00s:  Wow, you look at this.
3724.00s:  He literally started with all.
3727.00s:  All options.
3728.00s:  There's not even any shares in here.
3730.00s:  This is all options.
3732.00s:  Man, I didn't realize that I was talking to a that I've been doing a bunch of research on a fellow options home.
3738.00s:  I thought straight up that he was a stock trader that kind of threw in some options here and there.
3742.00s:  But my boy is an option straighter.
3745.00s:  I can't get the answer for that.
3747.00s:  Okay.
3748.00s:  That's my man.
3751.00s:  That makes me so happy.
3752.00s:  Look at this.
3753.00s:  The first thing that I see here.
3756.00s:  Is it's literally all options.
3758.00s:  All of it.
3759.00s:  There's zero shares.
3761.00s:  I love this.
3763.00s:  H says small sub folks would make nuts post.
3765.00s:  Okay, something else.
3768.00s:  Um.
3773.00s:  The sedric says outlier been sleep in this whole time. What the fuck? Yeah, like, I mean,
3778.36s:  I'm straight up with you guys. I am, I'm learning. I'm relatively new to this. I've traded,
3785.92s:  I've traded GameStop during kind of several of the squeezes as it's popped up on my scanners,
3791.76s:  but it's only in the last few months, maybe like two months that I've like really started
3798.72s:  digging into the background for this. So yeah, that's exactly why I'm still learning. So yeah,
3806.28s:  sedric to your point, I don't know, not only do I not know everything, I hardly know anything about
3811.84s:  this. I am so very much in my infancy of learning. And a lot of the way that I've been learning so far
3819.60s:  is just kind of like listening to people. And the things that I've been researching mostly to start
3825.44s:  have been kind of recent history of his plays to get a fingerprint forum and to get some ideas on
3833.36s:  like some of these different cycle theories and stuff like that. But yeah, I mean, this is nuts.
3839.36s:  The fact that because I genuinely thought that his core positions would have been stock and then
3846.08s:  he was amplifying them with options. That's exactly what I generally was expecting. And then that's
3853.68s:  just not exactly what I'm seeing here because really the primary teachers I lean on right now is
3858.88s:  Newton. He teaches me a lot of the background of GameStop and stuff like that. And then when we go
3866.16s:  through these is when I'm learning a lot. So yeah, this is crazy. Very interesting.
3874.88s:  J box town says, am I playing Siri options? Does Siri have options?
3883.84s:  It does. Let me see. No, I'm not right now. They look good.
3898.40s:  Yeah, there's a there's a ton. There's a ton of value in these like for something like this,
3904.40s:  that's priced at 329. That's a wild amount of premium for something like that.
3914.16s:  That's crazy. I got to get caught back up with the chat.
3923.20s:  Let me see.
3930.48s:  Ricky says reach out to him for a podcast so you guys can geek out on options.
3934.72s:  I honestly, as much as I would love to talk to him, I probably wouldn't want to do it on a podcast.
3941.04s:  Like I would rather just do like a phone call or something, but he, it's clear that the dude is
3949.36s:  kind of tired of being in front of things and he's, yeah, there's a reason why he's not all over
3957.20s:  the place. He could be if he's so chose to, but he doesn't really care. So yeah, it's funny
3963.36s:  as that would be. I totally respect and understand that he's just trying to create a little bit of space.
3970.16s:  Cedric says the first reason we thought it wouldn't crazy back in 2001 because Wall Street
3976.88s:  Betts bought a lot of calls nonstop and brokers had to buy those shares,
3980.48s:  hedge, causing price raise. Yeah, so just to be clear, that's not brokers that is market makers
3987.28s:  that would be doing that. And yeah, that's definitely part of it, especially if it's a much
3992.48s:  lower float stock. It will certainly display those kind of behaviors. So yeah, I think,
4004.32s:  I think that's definitely part of the movement that you saw. And I also think that's part of the
4008.64s:  the reason why we tend to see this moving the way it's moving now is because of the at-the-market.
4014.56s:  The way that the shares are going to behave in this kind of scenario is going to be slightly
4018.64s:  different. Let me see. Chris says no GMME guys are playing Siri just FYI. That's one of the
4033.12s:  tricky parts that starts to confuse me is like, I don't fully comprehend the different links that
4039.20s:  get made, right? Because I know before people were like super, super skeptical of Chui,
4045.92s:  but then obviously when the cat dropped his 13G or D, he obviously, he put a complete end to that
4055.68s:  debate. So yeah, I find that interesting to see what products are kind of like greenlit to be
4062.72s:  associated with GameStop and then what products are. And because the other thing that I think you
4066.96s:  guys have taught me is that there's overlap between the GMME community and the AMC community,
4074.88s:  but they're not like the same. And there's a schism between them. I find that really, really
4082.96s:  interesting. The Vladimir off Putin name is so funny. Vladimir off Putin says meme traders are
4096.56s:  super tribal. Yeah, that makes sense. All right. Willie says, how do you guys explain the music
4108.56s:  emojis on our case post them? Dogs, Doc, turn out to be validated. I'm actually really curious
4113.44s:  to be honest. Like I, I love looking at the emojis and kind of hearing the different theories on it,
4119.28s:  but my opinion is that people are, I think people are reading into them way further than intended.
4126.40s:  That's my genuine guess. I also think the cat knows at this point that anything that he posts like
4132.40s:  that based on the community, because I'm sure he watches the community and the response. I think
4136.56s:  he knows that when he posts stuff like that, it's going to send people into, you know, in a bis
4142.64s:  of research and theories and stuff like that. And I don't know, maybe he just enjoys that as
4147.60s:  like a general game to see maybe who gets it. But yeah, I find, I do find that part kind of interesting,
4154.24s:  because when I look at the general flow of what he's sharing and stuff, like I do feel like
4163.44s:  people read into them a little bit further than he was intending. And the reason why I think
4168.56s:  that is because this exact thing, I keep sharing the clip because I think it's important.
4172.56s:  But there is the clip from Cohen when he was on that podcast. And he was, I'll just share it
4180.96s:  again, because it's it's worthwhile enough, I think. But a lot of you will probably already know what
4185.12s:  I'm talking about. Oh, and podcast. I keep forgetting I can't do Cohen. I have to do
4197.28s:  here. Okay. And then I will share the audio. And then I have to find the spot. Yeah, here.
4211.12s:  All right. And then just listen for a second.
4214.80s:  It's a photo of you in a game stop store. Can you guys hear that? Does that come through? Okay.
4227.04s:  Okay. Cool. Thank you. Hot nitrogen. That's hilarious.
4230.48s:  Turn it up a tiny bit. Yeah. Can do
4232.72s:  you? One second. I'll just take it to like negative two decibels so that it's not like super
4242.16s:  loud. All right. Here we go. May 12, 2021. Is that what you do? I don't worry.
4250.56s:  So here he's just talking about like going in and checking out a game stop. But there's a specific
4254.88s:  spot in here that I want you to hear. I'm always seeing what the inventory. You don't get
4259.28s:  recognized when I wrote about this on our website. I noted what was in your hand. And we spent
4265.44s:  a lot of time trying to figure out we thought it was a scooter, an electric scooter. Yes, it was.
4270.88s:  Do you do that? All right. All right. That's fair. So we got that one right.
4274.72s:  We got the way the games were. Here you go. So this is the exact spot I want you to listen to.
4282.32s:  Every detail matters. Yeah. Of course. People were looking at the way the games were set up on the
4287.20s:  rack. People thought maybe there was a message there. Yeah. There wasn't one, right? No
4293.20s:  message in the games. I didn't. I mean, no, there wasn't. No. Right. So that's the point. I'm
4302.80s:  trying to share is like the community. Whenever you put a group of people together that are really
4309.04s:  investigative and very capable, we look into everything and we can go really, really far into things.
4317.84s:  And again, like even beyond what's intended. So in this case, you know, he first started with
4323.84s:  obviously the theory behind what's in his hand, right? And then they were talking about the,
4329.68s:  you know, the games. If there was a hidden meeting in the games and he was just like, no, there's not a
4333.36s:  there's not a message. But you can just imagine the number of conversations that would have happened
4342.48s:  about the configuration of those games and what it might have meant. So maybe there was,
4348.48s:  maybe there wasn't. I still don't know. He could have been joking there. I don't think so.
4351.44s:  Again, I take him at face value. But I just think it's important to identify that because then when
4357.52s:  I see people going through these memes from roaring kitty and like trying to assign a specific meaning
4364.40s:  to each one of these that's time bound and based on a certain event. It could be the case. It also
4370.48s:  could be the case that maybe he thought a couple of them were cool or maybe he just thought that
4374.72s:  it was funny or like whatever it is. I'm unsure. But I think that, yeah, I think that there could be
4384.16s:  a meaning. I don't know. But there also could be just playing playing around like that like this
4392.00s:  dude, like taking a picture in the game stop store, not meaning anything necessarily buy it. And then,
4398.00s:  yeah, kind of going off with people guessing all the intricate details about it. So yeah, that that
4404.16s:  part I just find generally interesting. So yeah, I just think that's worth a general conversation.
4412.32s:  Willie says Eric, what do you think about Berkshire Stock being linked to GME in some way?
4419.84s:  Could you give me some more details? Because I don't actually talk to me about the link as you see it.
4427.60s:  And then chop says finish the preference of options as a strategic investment hell yeah,
4431.28s:  that's go to book. Do you recommend reading it from cover to cover?
4435.04s:  Whatever you'll cage is jumping around.
4442.64s:  No, I don't think you have to read everything one second.
4465.44s:  Yeah, let me grab some real quick.
4484.00s:  All right, so I got the book here.
4486.00s:  And let's take a quick look.
4500.72s:  So for those that don't know the book that we're referring to, I'll show it to you really quick.
4506.40s:  It's this one. I'm not affiliated with this dude. I actually invited him on the channel for a
4511.12s:  podcast like because I'm probably one of his biggest advocates and he turned me down.
4515.68s:  So yeah, you know, it's kind of like I view him as options daddy and daddy doesn't love me.
4522.40s:  It's okay. I mean my actual dad's dad already. So I guess I'm used to use to that from the
4527.20s:  dad front. But yeah, so when I look at the different chapters in here, the way I would look at it
4533.36s:  is there are some of them that I think are really, really worth taking a look at.
4539.60s:  And then I think others you don't necessarily need to like run all the way through.
4544.24s:  So for example, here's how I would think about it. I'll show you.
4547.44s:  This is just looking at different strategies and then I'll put it.
4550.96s:  Sorry, let me see if you can, yeah, there you go. You can read that.
4554.64s:  So you can read these different strategies. And the way that I think about it is you can
4565.36s:  read through and see what the strategy is about and see if it's something that you want to do.
4569.76s:  But like there's no real reason in my opinion to go through this and read all of these different
4575.12s:  things if you're familiar with them already or if it's not something that fits into your book.
4582.64s:  That's the way I would think about it. So for example, like put spreads. You can read through what
4587.44s:  they are so that you understand what they are. But then if it's something that you're not
4590.96s:  going to trade, then I wouldn't read through the entire thing about put spreads.
4594.80s:  Again, unless you're you're generally interested in it. So yeah, let me know.
4600.96s:  Who was it that asked that? Chop. Chop. Let me know if that answers your question or at least
4607.44s:  gives you some ideas on how I would use it. Now the stuff that I think you really do need to look
4613.52s:  at though are things like arbitrage, the mathematical applications. I think those absolutely
4620.32s:  need to be included. So there's stuff in here from a structural perspective that I think is
4625.84s:  really important. And then there's a lot of stuff in here that's good general reference that
4630.56s:  you probably don't have to read all the way through.
4650.64s:  So I decided he was ready to stop out of the office for a second.
4657.44s:  All right. So back to the other question about
4663.92s:  Berkshire involvement. Let me see. That was from Willie. So let me see what Willie followed up with.
4669.76s:  Okay. Willie says people have noticed Berk A. Volume being strange. I'm not sure that that means
4675.76s:  anything in my opinion. If that's if that's the link like I wouldn't wait that very heavily.
4687.84s:  Chuck of the North says go to Berk A daily in zoom out volume dies the day GME ripped. Let's take a
4692.96s:  look. So let's take a look at Berk A.
4705.92s:  Let's do a side by side. This would be easier. So we'll do GME up top
4714.00s:  and then we'll do Berk A. And let's compare these together. So
4726.24s:  I don't see that. So Cedric you're saying that volume dies
4732.40s:  on the day that GME ripped but I don't see that. I see volume expanding in GME here.
4740.96s:  And then I see volume about the same here. And then I see volume in Berk A dying after the sixth.
4752.56s:  But this to me looks disassociated, right? Because the sixth is here. The volume was high
4760.24s:  into this move. So it follows it through this move, right?
4766.24s:  Falls it through this move to the sixth. These are lined up. Volume is still high.
4770.96s:  And then volume starts to tailor off after this. So to me, this is something else that's going on
4778.64s:  in here personally. Because if I look at these on a longer term time frame, I can see this giant
4785.20s:  ebb and flow of volume that then just cuts. I'm not sure what led to this cut in volume,
4790.64s:  but it doesn't look like it's, it doesn't at least to me. It doesn't look like it's highly correlated
4800.24s:  to GME at least volume behavior. So I mean, even this is completely different like from a previous
4807.44s:  perspective. So yeah, unsure.
4818.64s:  Let's see. George does the opposite. In case you guys were wondering, George does the opposite.
4825.12s:  So that means whatever you do, George then chooses the inverse of what you do,
4832.64s:  which I think is kind of good knowledge for all of us to have that when we're talking about
4838.00s:  George, that he does the opposite. But George does the opposite. Says if RK jumped on
4844.96s:  Siri Liberty has to do with the R play, which is likely why BK is there. That's 100%
4850.64s:  why Berkshire is there. I don't know, again, whether or not the cat is there, that I have no idea,
4857.12s:  I have no opinion on whatsoever. But what I do know is that is absolutely why Berkshire is there.
4865.60s:  For sure. And these kinds of plays, again, like merger arbitrage is not a standard form of arbitrage,
4875.76s:  which I feel like is really important for people to always keep in the back in their mind.
4880.24s:  When we're looking at something like merger, because merger,
4885.28s:  Arb still has a lot of carry risk. Like this deal with this will not deal. Like the reconfiguration
4894.40s:  can still run into different headwinds that prevents it from essentially coming all the way to
4899.76s:  fruition, which would then impact the value of the deal. And so in this case, like it is considered
4907.44s:  merger arbitrage, like that is what it's called. But this specific scenario is a little bit different
4913.84s:  because it's kind of like a merger, but kind of not, right? Like it's just kind of like a reorganization
4918.40s:  almost I would call it. So, Cedric says it's not arbitrage, the deal can fail. No, I don't think
4925.28s:  the deal really can fail because it's an internal reorganization. Like Siri is already held by Liberty
4931.84s:  Media. They just have different series of stocks that they're looking to consolidate,
4937.04s:  instead of having different series of stocks. Now, the thing is there's a variance between the perceived
4945.36s:  value that's tracked from Liberty Media that's tracked within Siri. So that's where the arbitrage
4953.52s:  merger arbitrage opportunity comes from is the reconciliation of those two values if this reorganization
4960.72s:  goes through. So to your point, and I would agree with it 100%, there's always risks associated
4967.52s:  with these kinds of things for whatever reason. The reorganization could not go through for some reason
4971.36s:  or another, but I wouldn't consider it like a standard merger, because it's not like Liberty is
4976.80s:  buying a new company or something like that. So, and exactly, Cedric, that point is also completely
4983.28s:  factual is that if they don't do it for whatever reason, then the arbitrage absolutely would fail.
4988.80s:  Again, for whatever reason. So the main thing is that there's carry risk involved.
4995.68s:  Cedric says arbitrage means there's no risk. I don't know if I agree with that necessarily,
5002.24s:  because there's a lot of kinds of arbitrage that include risk. And technically speaking,
5007.52s:  like the purest form of arbitrage is just trading the same products on two different markets and
5012.72s:  taking advantage of pricing discrepancy. And there's always the possibility that the exchange that
5020.48s:  you're trying to trade goes under or something like that. So even in standard arbitrage, there's risk
5026.00s:  involved. Now, it's normally much lighter risk, but yeah, it's slightly different, I think.
5034.08s:  Nick says your buffering is brutal. Is the buffering bad for you guys?
5037.20s:  It looks okay, I'm fine. Okay, cool. Nick, it's your, it's your busted ass internet. Don't try to
5050.64s:  gaslight me and say that my shit's fucked up. Everybody else says it's working straight up gaslight
5055.84s:  in me blaming your, blaming your bomb internet on me. It's your internet. Cedric says I got confused.
5062.56s:  Yeah, I don't, I actually wouldn't even say that, yeah, I think that that's totally fair.
5068.32s:  If, but I wouldn't even say you got confused because I think the, again, I'm getting to a technical
5073.52s:  definition or a technical component, but exactly to your point, which I completely would agree with,
5078.48s:  that the nature of most arbitrage plays is that there would be very, very little risk involved.
5083.76s:  And I think it's okay to call it no risk, right? It's a slight technical deviation, but I mean,
5089.60s:  I don't think you're confused. I just think it's nuanced. And there's a lot of different kinds of,
5097.84s:  just a lot of different kinds of arbitrage available. So,
5103.84s:  H says tender, arbitrage is lower risk. Yeah, exactly. Like there's different kinds of arbitrage,
5108.88s:  but it's just the concept of arbitrage is relatively straightforward and it comes in different
5114.96s:  flavors is the way I would think about it.
5120.08s:  Nick says your backdrop of the chart was loading forever. Sorry, yeah, I don't know what that,
5123.60s:  that's why I changed it actually is because like it wouldn't pull up Siri. Am I messing something up?
5133.68s:  Because I can see, I don't know, it's just not populating the chart for some reason.
5138.24s:  This is the only downside of using thinkorswim on the weekend is that it can be quirky like this,
5143.36s:  because this is normally when they go through all their dev time and start updating things and
5147.84s:  you know, all that kind of stuff. So, the kind of quick recap so far of what we're at is we see volume
5157.04s:  picking up in GameStop. We see that this volume might be associated with earnings, but there's
5164.72s:  a big enough gap that when I look at other volume rises associated with earnings, it's closer in time
5171.68s:  typically. So, this is I would consider to be a slightly different effect than these and I wouldn't
5181.04s:  clearly or just straight up call it some sort of earnings effect because I think that there's
5188.56s:  a little bit more to it than that. That's kind of what I'm seeing from here. Now, when I look at it
5194.40s:  a little bit more in depth though and we'll take a look at the options chain now because again,
5199.84s:  that is something I can do that I'm pretty good at as compared to trying to come up with all
5205.52s:  these other ideas that I clearly don't know a lot about, although I enjoy learning about it with you
5210.40s:  guys. Let's take a look. I got to order my dinner really quick. I think we're going to do,
5217.12s:  I think we're going to do barbecue tonight. What do you guys think about that? I think I'm going to do
5222.08s:  a sideopold pork, grilled veggies, a trytip, plate, chicken chunks, and then the wife's going to
5229.28s:  get a case idea. That's what I'm thinking. What do you guys think? I think barbecue sounds right.
5236.40s:  A little bit of barbecue. Briscuit? I kind of like bread. Sometimes it's too fatty for me.
5244.56s:  Yeah, sometimes I think briscuit is a little too fatty. Apos fades is what I think is that you like
5253.60s:  barbecue. I am, I realize that I'm habitual. So for a while before barbecue, if you guys were doing
5261.44s:  the live streams when I was ordering dinner, it was like Mexican and I was just getting like a
5265.68s:  burrito in a case of Dia. I was just doing Mexican a bunch of times. And then before that, I was
5270.00s:  getting Greek food a lot. I go through like these phases where I just order the same thing over
5275.04s:  and over again. Giovanni says you get barbecue all the time. Yeah, that's exactly right. So I would
5280.00s:  save for like the past. I mean, I can tell you from my orders probably the past like three weeks.
5286.40s:  We've been getting barbecue a few times a week. So yeah, Indian. We literally had Indian last night,
5294.64s:  like straight up last night. So Indian is on the, was it last night or the night before? One of those two.
5302.88s:  But yeah, Indian is absolutely on the docket as well. Oh no, I don't want to start my free trial.
5309.92s:  No, no, no, stop that. Stop that, stop that. That was terrible. He was trying to get me to do a
5314.96s:  free trial for some shit. I hate that. Season to sis bro. This is terrible.
5327.76s:  Ever tried Thai food. Yeah, I like Thai food. Thai food is really good. The one thing I notice
5332.32s:  about California, my opinion is like we have okay food, but we do not have like really great food,
5341.68s:  at least for the stuff that I like. Damn it. It looks like that stupid trial went through somehow.
5347.12s:  This is horse shit. I need to figure out how to turn off that. God, I'll do that later.
5353.44s:  Don't know why I have this trial now. These people suck.
5358.72s:  Reese says I ate Chipotle daily for eight years. I get it. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
5363.28s:  Like once I find something that I generally enjoy, I literally just, I just keep doing that.
5371.52s:  Yeah, it's like that, like that simple for me. All right, I got to turn off.
5379.76s:  Yes, dude, these guys are sneaky, bro. I don't want your membership.
5394.24s:  In case you didn't know, you have to be really, really, you have to be really on top of these
5400.64s:  pools. Continue and Uber one. Okay, so I think we're good. All right, we made it through. Man,
5418.56s:  that is a tricky flow. All right, we're back at it, gang. We have, we have dinner on the way.
5426.32s:  It's not going to be here for like 45 minutes or an hour. So we're back at it.
5432.16s:  H says already in 30s, study, already in 30s, studied Eric's racial diagonal vids,
5439.44s:  looking at modifying the position from straight, long dated to something protects downside a bit more.
5444.08s:  Yeah, I figured some of that out. I'm trying to catch back up.
5450.48s:  Roin Cleady says, do you think the current volume spike isn't explained by GameStop releasing
5454.24s:  news about cancelling their debt facility? And the associated, I think that's a big part of it.
5459.44s:  I actually have that as one of the things we're supposed to look at today. So let's pivot over to
5464.80s:  that. This. So yeah, I actually, oh no, this isn't the right one. My bad.
5476.56s:  My bad. Where is it? This one. Yeah, okay. So this post here was, I didn't read through
5484.08s:  the whole thing. I thought we can look through it together. But I completely agree with who was it
5489.28s:  that said that? Roin Cleady. I think that's exactly what it is. Now I don't know how far it goes or
5496.64s:  the severity, meaning how much it will move things.
5503.44s:  But I 100% think that this is a massive part of that move.
5508.96s:  I got to tell the wife to feed the dog. Right.
5519.04s:  H says, interested in what you think about Stephen Brown's idea about buying to ask Algas?
5525.76s:  I haven't seen that. Let me know what it is. Let me know what the idea is.
5539.44s:  But anyways, let's go through this. So this part I think is really important because this is
5544.64s:  another really big pivot for GameStop. So GameStop did the at the market and essentially eliminated
5556.00s:  the overwhelming majority of debt. Then they're now announcing that they're essentially unshackling
5567.44s:  themselves. That's what this looks like. So I went through their previous document and just
5574.32s:  had a curiosity to see what are the deals, who they have deals with. And one of the things that's
5583.20s:  in here that's really important to lead through, to read through are the prepayments. I don't care
5591.52s:  so much about. I don't think that matters. But the periods that are the sections that I think
5599.12s:  matter a lot are the restricted payments change in nature transactions with affiliates. So kind of
5605.76s:  this section, six, seven, eight, nine. And the restricted payment section is really interesting
5612.80s:  because it limits a lot of what GameStop is allowed to do without seeking approval.
5621.12s:  Essentially from the debtors. So by canceling this agreement because now GameStop
5628.56s:  has its own freedom, they don't have to go through their lean holders and essentially the other
5637.44s:  entities that they previously were working with their creditors. And it gives them essentially full
5643.04s:  autonomy over what they choose to do. So when I look at this, I actually believe this starts to
5649.52s:  bolster more and more the idea that we might be walking into GameStop looking to acquire something
5656.88s:  as compared to just investing all of it to reinvest it into the business. It does look like,
5662.96s:  because I don't fully understand why otherwise they would make this move at this point particularly.
5668.64s:  To me, it again leads me to believe that they're looking at acquiring things, which is actually pretty
5675.44s:  sick. So yeah, all right. So let me see this theory that we're talking about above.
5686.24s:  By asking. What else can I say all trades other than when you buy ask is done under a blanket algorithm
5697.12s:  dark? I don't fully agree with that. I can see the idea of trying to buy at the ask if it's done in
5704.64s:  mass, right to move something up. But I think you can have literally all cumulative retail traders
5710.40s:  buy at the ask essentially at the same time. And I don't think that there would be enough
5716.72s:  of a movement over a sustained period of time. The other thing is there's a pretty big
5723.12s:  misconception about dark pools. Dark pools still report your orders. It's just delayed.
5731.84s:  And so if you if your order is routed off exchange for whatever reason, there's just a delay in
5739.36s:  the reporting. Now what is not reported are orders that are internalized. That won't hit the
5747.68s:  consolidated tape because those orders have already been transacted at some point and then they're
5751.92s:  held internally and essentially cycled internally. So there's no subsequent impact. That leads to
5757.60s:  lack of transparency and to be clear, so do dark pools. But dark pools still have reporting
5763.68s:  requirements. And it's not like days later. It's minutes. So yeah, like and dark pool orders will
5770.80s:  still hit the consolidated tape. So yeah, I don't think I get the idea behind like trying to create
5778.16s:  like a buzz or you know, movement via that. But it's even if your order is routed off exchange
5785.52s:  is as long as it's not internalized, it'll still hit the consolidated tape. So again, just
5793.28s:  just my thoughts. A penny for your thoughts as they say.
5805.04s:  Doctors they says, but dark pool orders influence, but dark pool orders to influence price action
5812.24s:  as much. Correct. They don't. So the whole point of dark pool orders is to create a delay in
5816.88s:  reporting to obscure movements specifically for larger entities. So they don't get front ran by
5823.36s:  people on their big orders. So that's the idea. Now dark pools writ large are in my opinion terrible
5832.56s:  because they they still lack transparency. Will he says are dark pools regulated? Yeah, definitely.
5839.84s:  Dark pools are really heavily regulated. Again, there's like strict reporting requirement.
5844.48s:  Let's take a look together. Dark pool trade reporting requirements. There's entire legislation
5857.04s:  on how ATS orders have to be regulated.
5865.28s:  There you go. So this is from Finra and this is talking about dark pools. And it says,
5876.00s:  though their name might make it sound like these venues like transparency or oversight, both
5879.52s:  SEC and Finra are actively involved in the regulation of dark pools. So all trade data for
5885.28s:  listed stock transactions that occur on ATS, they have to be submitted to Finra and the TRF
5893.52s:  facility or the TRF. So this is the part that matters is published on the consolidated tape.
5900.80s:  Right. This is this is when it becomes available to everybody. This right here.
5908.08s:  So you start pool volume. It still hits the consolidated tape. If it's not consolidated or if
5916.24s:  it's not internalized, sorry, if it's an internalized order, then it won't. So dark pools are regulated.
5924.96s:  I want to be clear. I don't like dark pools. I wish that they didn't exist. But again, whether
5930.88s:  or not I like something or dislike something, I think one of the most important things is to be able
5935.68s:  to objectively analyze something and not get emotionally wrapped up and whether we like it,
5940.96s:  dislike it, whatever that is, to separate those two things. So while I don't like them,
5946.08s:  and I wish they didn't exist, it's also not this crazy dark world that is Wild West and
5954.56s:  just anything happens. It's still regulated. So yeah, I just wouldn't look at dark pools as a
5962.72s:  bottomless abyss, contrary to the name. And you can look at essentially the ATS right here.
5972.56s:  And it'll show you the different orders that rotated through because again, like this website,
5979.44s:  DME off exchange volume. This website's great. Chart exchange. I really, really like this website.
5986.48s:  And I'm not affiliated with these dudes. They just have a fantastic, fantastic website.
5992.16s:  And you can see a few things from them. But when we're looking at these, this is where they're
6000.56s:  getting it from. So when we're trying to track off exchange volume, this is how we can track
6005.68s:  off exchange volume because it's reported. If it's not reported, then we can't track it. So yeah.
6014.32s:  I'm catching up on the chat here.
6027.36s:  Don't forget five of the biggest call volumes last six months came in on Friday. Yeah,
6032.16s:  we'll talk about that in a second for sure, especially the order Friday. I think I talked about
6036.56s:  that in the last video, but I definitely want to talk about it. Chris says he doesn't do technical
6044.00s:  analysis. Who doesn't do technical analysis? I assume you're talking about somebody else.
6047.92s:  I definitely do.
6051.76s:  Cedric says internal orders are the same as a trade done off market. You can do the same.
6056.08s:  They're they so a dark pool order in order that's routed to the dark pool. It can be internalized
6062.80s:  or it cannot be internalized. There's an offshoot. There's a split. The reason why I point that out
6068.48s:  is just to differentiate that dark. It's not dark pool. No volume. That's not how again,
6076.08s:  like that's how we see this. They're not getting this from like the tooth fairy. They get off
6082.32s:  exchange volume from the reporting structure that exists. So there's a consolidated tape that
6090.80s:  ingests that data. Now again, to everybody's point, this it's not the most transparent setup.
6097.12s:  And the orders can be internalized, which that is literally a dark pool, right? That you can't see
6104.00s:  into. But that's it's just again, I just think it's important to be accurate when we're talking
6109.76s:  about this stuff because it's so easy to get to a point where we're just so disenfranchised
6114.32s:  because it's like, oh, shit, it's all fake or it's all going to the dark pool. The volume doesn't
6118.16s:  matter. And it's like, I understand that sentiment, but it's like partially true. Because again,
6124.16s:  dark pools don't inherently not permit order or volume tracking. It still exists. It just depends
6131.20s:  on if it's internalized. So yeah, the system is still unfair to a lot of degrees. Retail traders
6138.32s:  are not advantaged. Want to be clear about all of that. But because the system is not totally
6144.00s:  fair, doesn't mean that it's totally rigged either. Again, in my opinion, because if it were
6149.84s:  totally rigged, and we looked like this wouldn't happen. Nope. Anybody that's on the other side of
6156.72s:  this trade, like the large entities that get hurt when this happens that do have the controlling
6162.88s:  hand on a lot of stuff. If they had total control, this would never happen. They don't want this.
6169.84s:  So that's that's I just think it's important to look at both sides of this is all. I understand
6175.84s:  the frustrations that people have. I don't blame them for having them. But for me, I just look at
6181.20s:  markets in the world slightly differently. And even though I have opinions, preferences,
6187.68s:  and stuff like that, I do my absolute best to decouple those from my ability to analyze things.
6195.28s:  And when I'm analyzing something, I'm trying to do it as objectively as humanly possible.
6199.76s:  That's my intent. I still have bias. I still have skew. I always will. We all always will
6204.80s:  humans. But that's one of the reasons why I try to use kind of a statistical approach to things
6211.36s:  because I can then quantify things. And that inherently will show the bias if it's there in
6218.80s:  terms of my perception. One of my biases is for roaring kitty. My bias was I thought that he was
6226.00s:  a stock trader that then used options to amplify the stock positions. That's not what happened.
6233.52s:  Right. I can see in the beginning, he was actually just using options and then started
6238.32s:  scaling into the stock after that. Which is also really interesting to me. We are two
6248.00s:  spin drifts down. We're down to the last beverage. And this one is not a spin drift. We now have
6254.72s:  a water loom, which is a blackberry lemonade,
6259.68s:  a seltzer water. So for anybody else that is enjoying a seltzer water or other beverage, cheers to you.
6268.64s:  Or as my dad would say, stole a lot.
6274.32s:  Let's see. Sadiq says, what is weird before GME? He's diversified very diversified like 50 positions.
6282.00s:  Yeah. So Sadiq, there's a video. I have to find it. If we want to look through it right now,
6288.72s:  I would be happy to try to find it because I don't know where it is, but I remember listening to it.
6293.68s:  And so he has a video where he's talking about his methodology. And in that video, he talks about
6302.00s:  his transition from being a value investor into something else. And I don't remember what he
6310.24s:  called himself as moving into, but I distinctly remember hearing him talking about his frustrations
6316.72s:  with being a value investor. And when he has something that's valued and the stock didn't move
6322.08s:  towards that value. So I have to find where that is. I don't remember exactly where it is,
6328.64s:  but I remember him talking about that specifically, because I thought it was really topical.
6332.48s:  So for Sadiq, that's the recollection I have, which might be faulty. But I think that's why he went
6340.56s:  from having so many positions to then getting hyper focused because my guess is he was going through
6346.56s:  this process. Like if we look at his YouTube channel, you'll see that he's gone through massive,
6354.64s:  massive, massive effort here. And we look at his videos. He's gone through massive effort building
6363.20s:  like these different spreadsheets and being in the finance industry and trading for a long time.
6370.80s:  And then you find that at least seems like he wasn't seeing the success he wanted to see. So then
6378.96s:  he changed his style. That's what I kind of take away from it. And I think that's why
6384.80s:  he changed his approach and became way more concentrated.
6389.28s:  Yeah.
6393.60s:  Where are we at? Oh, okay, cool. It looks like you guys are.
6400.08s:  Sadiq says you don't leverage all in 10x on a guess.
6404.80s:  Well, it's not 10x because he used options and he bought options.
6415.28s:  So if you're buying options, you're not leveraged where you have unlimited risk.
6420.48s:  You're limited to whatever you bought those options for. So if we go back to this here,
6426.24s:  and again, we go back to one of his first posts that I see here, his portfolio is 113,000 with
6432.88s:  essentially 100,000 of that in options. So what this tells me is he's risking
6444.00s:  $100,000 on GameStop calls. Obviously, he's very bullish. And obviously, he really believed in
6453.84s:  his due diligence and his thesis, right, fully so. But this is a highly concentrated position.
6460.48s:  But I just clarifying that this doesn't open him to like margin risk or anything like that.
6466.96s:  This in and of itself is he's just essentially risking his whole portfolio. It's a yellow,
6471.60s:  right? As he talks about this exactly what it is. It's a yellow.
6475.20s:  Cedric says he doesn't do that on a guess. Yeah, I agree with you. I think that he did his research
6480.40s:  and he really believed in what he was doing. I completely agree with you there.
6486.32s:  Yeah, I 100% agree with you.
6491.68s:  Vladimir says all same contract with different dates that he bought. Yeah, exactly.
6495.60s:  So you can see that this top line is the total contract. And then these down here are all
6503.52s:  of the individual positions that he kind of scaled into over time.
6509.68s:  So we can see that he started scaling in in June. One second, I'm going to answer the
6555.92s:  back.
6562.88s:  Back at it. Sorry about that.
6567.20s:  Let me catch up. His first buy was 30, 30. That's funny.
6575.04s:  Yeah. So, but anyways, like he obviously is just heavily, heavily, heavily leveraging this play.
6585.60s:  Jimmy Zart. His thesis was never disproven and only confirms his thesis when activist investor
6591.68s:  RC got on board. Yeah. Well, and again, I can tell from the beginning that this obviously wasn't
6597.76s:  a perfectly timed position because he started like really, really light. So I see 50, 50, 50, 50,
6606.00s:  then 200. That's an interesting scaling mechanism that again, most traders don't really do.
6614.16s:  But what I can tell you is that there's some degenerate behavior going on here. And I'm not,
6621.60s:  again, using that term, derogatory towards him. I'm a degenerate too. But I can see some degenerate
6627.20s:  trading behavior here. So he got 50 at 60, 50 at 75, 50 at 55, 50 at 50, and then he goes 200
6635.92s:  at 30, 100 at 30. So we are averaging down hard core, scaling into a losing trade at the time.
6645.36s:  Obviously it shows really profitable at the time that he took to snapshot. But that is just
6652.80s:  classic. It's just absolutely classic, slowly scaling in and then it starts dipping. It's like,
6659.28s:  oh, shit, well, if I just add a bunch more, then I'm good. I don't have to go up his high in
6665.44s:  order to break even and then it worked out, right? So that's awesome. But yeah, this is just a
6672.00s:  standard standard D-chain movement, which I love to see because I fully identify with it.
6678.16s:  Yeah, absolutely classic big, big fan. But yeah, I think that's a big reason why we saw a significant
6685.68s:  change in his overall methodology. So yeah. All right, so let's take a look at a couple other
6694.24s:  things. I do want to take a look at the options chain for the month. So we'll grab unusual
6701.28s:  whales for this and we'll go in here. Reese says, what was the date? This is five years ago.
6711.60s:  Is the date? There it goes. Oh, that's actually really cool. I didn't know that. If you hover
6715.04s:  over it gives you exactly one eight September. That's actually really cool.
6724.56s:  Dr. Z says he also knew the squeeze was coming.
6730.80s:  I, yeah, well, I think in his videos, he started talking about the potential of a squeeze a bit,
6737.60s:  I don't remember. I know that he talked about it though. I don't remember when. So let's go to
6742.16s:  the lives because one of these talks about a squeeze somewhere. Let me go all the way back to the
6748.64s:  beginning. No squeeze there. Here we go. This right here. So this, this was.
6762.24s:  Is this give me the exact date? Three years ago. Do we know. This doesn't give me the date.
6780.40s:  Right click. Cedric, where do I right click? Tell me. Do I? Yeah, teach me. There it goes.
6788.32s:  Again, you just had to hover over it. Look at me go. So this was September 4th.
6795.20s:  So it doesn't fully corroborate the idea of a squeeze in my opinion until later.
6806.64s:  Because he started buying this position all the way back in June. So my guess is maybe as he thought
6816.48s:  the squeeze maybe I don't know again when he thought it was going to start to come on.
6821.12s:  But maybe when he when he was thinking that it was going to start to come on that he would scale in.
6828.64s:  That definitely could be something on his radar.
6837.44s:  Yeah, interesting idea.
6839.20s:  Yeah.
6841.04s:  Oh, Ryan says, Mr. Part, we asked where we are. Keyodo. Oh, that's so cool.
6846.64s:  I've only been around there. I haven't really had a chance to to check out Kyoto. That's so sick.
6851.12s:  Welcome in, man.
6854.48s:  Reese says in his DD, the short interest was an afterthought. Yeah, because to me, that looked like
6858.56s:  something that was scaled on over time. So that let me back up here.
6865.76s:  Because when I when I was looking at his first stuff, like, you know, when he was talking about
6869.92s:  these kinds of things, it still looked like a value play to me in terms of what he thought was
6874.72s:  happening. And then it didn't look like we were, you know, starting to explore the concept of a
6880.32s:  squeeze until later. But then we can see that there's a couple, couple call outs for a squeeze
6888.64s:  like right here, right? Squeezed orange or whatever that is.
6895.28s:  That's an orange. Yeah. So it looks like something that built over time. To me, it does look like
6902.40s:  the origin of the position was just a value play. And he really believed in the value opportunity
6910.24s:  there. That's what I took. So yeah. Sweet. All right. So now let's take a look at this. We can change
6925.52s:  into this. Rhino says, do you think this time, arcade will do it like you did in 19 several
6931.20s:  different strikes and explorations that keep the element of surprise?
6940.24s:  I mean, I typically see him in one strike at least recently. So my guess is,
6948.08s:  my guess would be one strike actually as compared to multiple.
6954.48s:  Because it seems like he likes to build into positions. That's another thing I've noticed
6960.32s:  at least historically, especially now when he's trading at the size that he's trading at,
6965.44s:  you kind of have to build into them over time just because literally the positions are too
6970.00s:  freaking large to just hop in them all at once. So that's my hypothesis. Ricky says, uh-oh,
6979.76s:  time to get serious. Eric standing. Yeah. It's just my fucking sciatica that I'm standing.
6986.88s:  Uh-put on the tin. Yeah, I got you.
6993.04s:  Except the only the only caveat is if I'm going to put on the tin, we got to talk about tin foil.
6999.04s:  We can't talk about factual stuff. So you guys are going to have to hook me up with some tin foil
7004.72s:  stuff we can look at. Let me look at these options first. And then we can get into the tin.
7009.76s:  This, this, look at this. So I'm going to look at just the call side. I'm going to look at just the
7018.64s:  asks. And let's take a look. So we see a $660,000 trade that came in targeting the 20th of
7034.56s:  Sep. So this is through earnings. I talked about this a bit on the recap video yesterday. I
7042.16s:  actually plan on getting further into detail on it, probably in the outlook video for tomorrow.
7049.36s:  But this, this move here is absolutely, absolutely interesting to me because that is not
7058.00s:  an insignificant position. And there's not a lot of retail traders that have this kind of capital
7065.92s:  to run this. Some of us do, but not a ton. And it's, it's interesting. The reason why now, actually,
7077.68s:  this is perfect time for this. So, oh, wait, hold on, I got to extend this because it's
7085.68s:  cutting off the top of my hat. Hold on. Let me extend this.
7100.24s:  There we go. Yeah, that was frustrating me. It's like, what is the point of having a tin foil
7106.80s:  hat, a Viking tin foil hat with horns that my wife made me specifically for these?
7113.12s:  Um, if it's not going to show the horns, I feel like they have to be here. They kind of fade in
7117.52s:  and out, but that's, I guess, just kind of how it goes. Actually, give me one more second. I have
7122.72s:  another idea. Let's do. We'll duplicate this like this. And then in this instead, we'll move this
7136.24s:  here. There we go. See this. So now we have, oh, oh, that's not good. Hold on, hold on, gang. Give me
7151.60s:  a second, figuring it out. I almost got it. Okay. That's kind of terrifying. That's, nope, not what I
7161.04s:  wanted. Nope, not what I wanted. How's this going for you guys? Is this like super confusing yet?
7169.92s:  Because it has me fairly confused. All right. So let's go there. And then let's do this. All right.
7184.56s:  Right. This is what we needed. So now we have this one for like the regular. And then we have
7191.20s:  this one specifically for tin foil hat. I can make sure that the size is appropriate as such.
7200.80s:  There we go. Now it can be seen in all its glory unadultered. This is what I needed in my life.
7209.60s:  This is, I mean, I love this. I even can zoom that up just a little bit. Be like that. I feel like
7215.92s:  you can like really take in the tin here. Okay. So now let's get, let's get tinny. This, I don't know
7224.08s:  if it's the cat, but it absolutely reminds me of the cat. So I didn't say this in the video on
7232.48s:  Friday because I, when I'm doing like the recap videos and stuff like that, I genuinely try to
7238.96s:  keep it as objective as I possibly can and to not, you know, send people down different rabbit holes
7246.80s:  and all that kind of stuff. This looks like the cat to me. And the reason why I say that is because
7255.36s:  I know when he, I think when he rotated from when he rotated at least whether it was selling
7266.08s:  shares, selling partial, but when he moved into Chewie, however, that played out for him,
7272.88s:  one of the things that I have to imagine is that he still wants to play GameStop.
7279.04s:  And I think it's been such a big part of what he does.
7284.40s:  So the interesting thing about this position is I would not be shocked if we get a portfolio
7292.96s:  update from him soon that will show the Chewie position still to some degree and then in options
7301.44s:  position in GameStop. That's one of my guesses. And the reason why I guess that is because if we take
7309.68s:  a look at his portfolio and let's take a look through all the way up here,
7323.92s:  guess what? He had 268 million dollars based on the math for his Chewie position assuming that he had
7339.92s:  gotten in somewhere around here somewhere like what is this nonsense? I don't understand why these
7351.20s:  charts won't load. Stop this immediately. Okay, since apparently we can't, okay, since apparently we
7363.20s:  can't look at any charts, I'm going to go to good old Yahoo Finance and we'll pull up the chart there.
7371.28s:  Let's look at Chewie.
7380.48s:  And then let's go back like three months and we think that he got in here on the 24th.
7387.76s:  Was it the 24th? I think it was the 24th. And when I look at the 24th,
7393.20s:  I see was it the 24th of June or July? Hold on, let me make sure I'm on the right date.
7407.68s:  Do you guys know which date it was specifically?
7413.12s:  Of Vladimir says he can sell Chewie down to 5.1? No, isn't it below 5? June 24th, okay, I was on the
7419.36s:  right date. Thank you, Rhino. No, I think you're right because that's the date that I remember too.
7425.60s:  But Vladimir off-put and I think it's if it's sub 5 because it's once you cross the 5 threshold,
7432.48s:  it starts and then I think if it's sub 5, then he would have to file the amendment within 10 days
7439.92s:  of the transaction. So if we take a look at this and let's just assume because when I look at the
7449.60s:  chart, there's a pretty decent size volume for the day as well. So I think it essentially lines
7456.32s:  up almost perfectly. But let's say that we give them like the mid price. So the high was 2750,
7463.20s:  the low was 2475. So if we give it to them at like 26, 26 times 9,000,000 shares,
7473.36s:  is $234 million. $234 million. So going back to the hypothesis here, now that we got the 10
7484.96s:  foil hat on and we can get dirty with it, if we come back over here and we look at this,
7491.84s:  we know that he has a $234 million position in Chewie. So let's get the exact math. 268 452844 minus 234
7506.16s:  023000. It gives him 34 million dollars left over. And then nuts that you put on a $200 million
7519.68s:  position. You're like, yeah, I'm just going to keep like 34 million in cash. Let's just if it's
7524.96s:  in cash. Part of it could be in GameStop. And that wouldn't surprise me in the least. But what it
7530.56s:  does tell me is that he is $34 million residual of some sort. So when I look at this kind of position,
7541.20s:  660,000, it would not shock me whatsoever. If there's some sort of residual GameStop
7548.80s:  position, and if he still has a decent amount of money in order to put on a position like this,
7556.96s:  to probably play earnings, that's what I expected as. So this looks very similar to Cat
7564.88s:  behavior. Also in terms of the time of entry of the trade towards the end of the day,
7569.92s:  he's very commonly, I think, doing that because again, like more professional traders, like myself,
7577.92s:  we know that there's more liquidity there. So that is also why I think he's doing that towards
7582.80s:  the end of the day. So yeah, I think this absolutely could be him.
7590.88s:  Cedric says people do not want him to sell GameStop. But I also think he did and that it's
7595.04s:  actually bullish because he come back and the price didn't move. Yeah, I mean, the idea that he
7600.80s:  didn't sell any GameStop to get into Chewy, I think is possible somehow. But I would deem that
7608.64s:  very unlikely personally. And I think the highest probability scenario is he likely sold a good chunk
7618.16s:  if not all of his GameStop to move into Chewy for whatever reason. And then after that,
7625.36s:  I think he probably now is seemingly starting to play GameStop if this is him.
7638.56s:  That's my Uber order. Hold on, I think they're struggling to find the house. I gotta message them.
7644.32s:  Okay.
7654.56s:  Okay.
7661.76s:  Yeah, so anyways, that's what it looks like to me. Now, Ryan says we do not know how much
7667.36s:  many had and how much how much is using and what we know, he moved to Chewy and he has more
7672.16s:  than 20 million to buy other options position, maybe not 120 million, but maybe 40. Yeah,
7677.04s:  or maybe 660 K. I think this is absolutely true.
7682.48s:  Monkall says it's possible is possible RK kept GME shares hedge position with 25 long dated puts
7688.56s:  leveraged by empowered gain from GME to hedge for his two positions. I don't see him buying puts.
7694.16s:  Yeah, I just do not see that as part of his approach at all.
7697.84s:  Again, just an opinion, but everything that this dude has talked about is not that.
7717.28s:  Yeah.
7719.76s:  Um, so anyways, a couple things to highlight here.
7724.24s:  Cedric says could he sell calls on his position for Chewy, maybe?
7729.04s:  Um, he could. I'm not sure.
7735.76s:  I'm not sure that he would, but he could. I haven't seen, I haven't really seen a lot of his
7744.80s:  behavior when it comes to selling, right? So even in this case, he, he didn't sell
7753.20s:  options. He didn't sell like I actually don't know. Have you guys seen anything in here where
7757.92s:  he sold options? Because I haven't actually now that I'm thinking about it.
7764.96s:  This is long. This is long. Let me go back further 2020 long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long,
7773.84s:  long. Yeah.
7776.24s:  Yeah.
7778.48s:  I don't see him. I don't see him buying puts and I don't see him selling calls.
7792.72s:  What does this do? Oh, it's like, uh, I thought it was like, uh, the mouse, right.
7801.52s:  Nope. Nope. That's going for.
7812.24s:  Nope. Okay. So these are all just like gifts. Yeah. So I don't see, I don't see him selling
7821.28s:  calls and I don't see him buying puts.
7824.24s:  Yeah.
7830.08s:  Yeah. Reese says I don't think he sold options ever. I don't either. I don't, I just don't see it.
7834.32s:  Like he could do it. But everything about even this comment down here, which is actually really
7840.88s:  explanatory to me. Let me find it.
7842.80s:  Yeah.
7844.48s:  Larming. No, no.
7850.48s:  No. No.
7865.12s:  I'm looking for a specific spot in here that we saw earlier.
7872.80s:  Yeah.
7887.04s:  This is another thing I learned about him. I think that you guys told me is that like,
7892.08s:  you actually used to get beat up a little bit, you know, proverbially on like these,
7898.00s:  forums and stuff, which I think is really interesting.
7903.28s:  So,
7909.28s:  Cedric says we never saw him hold shares too. Yeah, we definitely see, we've seen him hold shares,
7915.60s:  but we haven't, I haven't seen him downsize his shares.
7925.04s:  I think it was somewhere in here.
7930.80s:  No, no.
7955.60s:  No.
7959.60s:  No. Yeah. These are all bought. Okay. I think it's somewhere in here.
7965.60s:  Here, right here. Finally, sorry. That took me a minute to find it.
7969.60s:  But this is the exact spot I was looking for.
7973.36s:  We'll click into the comment and see what the conversation was.
7977.76s:  Wait, where's the original or did he just, I thought that this was in response to somebody.
7985.76s:  Yeah, okay. Hold on. I got to see because that looks like, that definitely looks like a comment that's
7991.44s:  in response to somebody. Here we go. Why did you keep buying after you averaged down around 30 and
8000.80s:  then it doubled to make more money? Okay, here we go. I was curious why you didn't roll to another
8008.32s:  strike or expiration. I felt these ones were most attractively priced. Obviously, there's a case
8012.24s:  to be made that diversifying across strikes, expertise, whatever reduced my risk. But in my
8018.80s:  opinion, such actions may have also reduced my estimated returns. And quite frankly, that's not
8025.28s:  how I roll. So like that is so, so explanatory to me in terms of the way that he looks at things.
8035.28s:  He's not looking to reduce risk. So when I see this kind of thing, it just tells me that he's
8043.28s:  obviously supremely convicted in what he's doing. And by the way that he positions, even up
8051.28s:  until this point, his disposition, when he made this change from value investing to this,
8058.88s:  it's the same, it's the same story. Because in any of these scenarios, like, let's take a look in,
8069.12s:  let's go up here. So in this case, he literally could have closed this position down when his portfolio
8081.44s:  was literally, literally, over half a billion dollars, billion could have taken this off. He made
8095.76s:  175.5 million dollars in a day on these calls, half of a billion dollars. If he cared about risk
8108.56s:  at all, he would have started scaling down. There's no reason why you wouldn't start scaling down
8115.84s:  here, especially because if you like think of this logically from a trading perspective, his options
8121.92s:  were for 21 June 24. This is June 6th. He's coming up on expiration. They're not good till forever.
8131.20s:  So that would have been an ideal time to scale down if he gave even a remote fuck about risk.
8141.60s:  But this tells me he doesn't, like he doesn't, G-A-F about risk, just he doesn't, which is incredible.
8152.48s:  It's part of the reason why I find his movements so interesting to break down and analyze,
8158.72s:  because that is just highly, highly anomalous. You just don't see that. And it's incredible. It's so
8167.04s:  fun. It's so fun to look at. But yeah, that's exactly what this is. He did not care about the risk
8175.04s:  whatsoever. Let me see. Let me catch up with you guys.
8186.32s:  Let's see him. King says he has never posted selling calls. Yeah, I completely agree with that.
8190.40s:  I haven't seen it. Oh, interesting. So H says old Wall Street bets flamed them,
8196.64s:  fascinating. I don't know why. Yeah, I like I don't actually get why.
8209.04s:  Vladimir off Putin says, D.F. Vizio LaPose were positions at a moment in time. Don't reflect
8214.08s:  all transactions. Yes, really important to identify. Now, one of the things that I think is fair
8220.40s:  to assume though, especially when you see this many posts is you can definitely infer style from
8227.28s:  the posts, right? Like I can tell that he prefers individual strikes. I can tell the DTEs that he
8235.44s:  tends to prefer are not super short. I can tell that he prefers to wait his options plays over
8242.56s:  his equity plays. Like there's a lot of details I can pick up simply from analyzing a series of
8250.32s:  trades from somebody. You can pick up a lot of their behaviors if you're discerning. So I completely
8256.32s:  completely agree with you, Mr. off Putin. But I will say that I think in this case, we can come
8268.00s:  up with a pretty good idea for the way that he trades. That's my guess.
8277.52s:  Yeah, Rhino says I don't think he's doing it for the money anymore after a few million. I would
8281.04s:  assume a man would be satisfied. Yeah, I completely agree. Because the other thing is that it doesn't
8285.76s:  look like this dude is like heavily balling out or doing anything crazy like that.
8290.88s:  It yeah, it essentially looks like he's doing his thing. So yeah, in this case, I completely agree.
8306.40s:  I don't think that he really is overly obsessed with money. Even the way that he did the live stream
8312.64s:  and how much fun he had with that, like you could tell he's not into flexing on everybody with the
8318.56s:  money. Like he's not into that superficial bullshit, which is really cool. It's another reason why
8322.72s:  I like the guy so much is that he's like really, really seemingly genuine in that sense, which I like a
8328.80s:  lot. So H says back before GME, it was more seasoned traders with high risk tolerance that would
8337.12s:  bash each other for a good time. Oh, interesting. Really, really interesting. I didn't know that
8345.44s:  about like the older school Wall Street or Wall Street pets. Because I've honestly always took
8352.24s:  Wall Street pets that it was just kind of like a bunch of people fucking around,
8357.84s:  generally talking about taking really big risks or like losing money. Like that's the
8363.84s:  the general gist that I've got from it.
8367.28s:  Bre says now you can't mention GME on Wall Street pets. I did not know that either. That's also
8374.88s:  completely fascinating. Jono Tron says tin foil will get a RK post stream on the seventh. It's clearly
8384.40s:  in his bust of rhymes meme from 516 after 97 flip mode. When I be on the mic, yes, I do my due to
8391.28s:  yo. Interesting thesis. We'll have to see how accurate it is. All right, gang, that about wraps me
8402.16s:  up. Really, really fun session though. Had an absolute blast hanging out with you guys. It's
8407.28s:  time to take the tin foil off and it's time to do a little bit of market prep for the rest of my
8412.40s:  trading. But incredible hanging out with you all have an absolute blast looking at this stuff.
8418.16s:  I am so hopeful that the week ahead is going to be just super, super fun.
8424.88s:  Now the last thing I want to show you all just so that you have it for your record,
8428.96s:  if you're interested in looking it up, this is the SEC report on the 2021 squeeze and what they
8436.96s:  came away with, which I think is really interesting and really worth reading through because there's
8443.36s:  a lot of small details that I'm starting to pick up from it. And then the other one I want to show
8449.12s:  you is this, which is about off exchange volume market makers and talking about this has pieces
8459.44s:  about GME in here. So this is another like recent study that I'm reading through to pick together
8466.32s:  some more more pieces. So Ricky says my portfolio is hopeful too. I'm cooked if we go any more
8472.88s:  downward. Well, I don't know Ricky, maybe you're following the DFV model and just yolo yoloing
8480.72s:  out there. But if you're yoloing it, then you got to give the same amount of foxes the cat does
8485.60s:  with his risk, which is zero. If you're not in that same boat, which again, I'll keep it a buck
8490.96s:  with you guys. I'm not like that. I care a lot about my risk because I have a lot of shit that I
8496.48s:  have to keep on the table. I already told you all like I retired my mom through trading. So I
8502.96s:  do not have that same disposition risk to me matters a lot. So if you feel some type of way
8510.08s:  about the risk, then I would probably take a look at another position or change a little bit about
8517.60s:  what you're doing. So yeah. Chris says I was hoping you would cover the 20 and a half calls from
8523.52s:  Friday. Yeah, let's take a look. I'll take a look right now with you. No sweat. Sorry about that.
8528.40s:  If I missed it earlier in the chat, that's my bad.
8534.96s:  Let me get rid of that. I think we can kill all of this. And oh, shit, that had unusual whales.
8543.04s:  Let me grab that again, because I can't pull it up in here. I don't know what's up with this. It's
8547.68s:  still annoying. So this is like two to one. Yeah, let's take a look at GameStop.
8558.80s:  All right. And you wanted to look at the 20 and a half calls from Friday.
8567.92s:  So let's go just to Friday. And then let's just look at the calls. And then let's just look at
8577.84s:  the specific strike, which is 20.5. And then 20.5.
8589.52s:  I mean, I don't really see anything here personally.
8597.36s:  Yeah, this just looks like a handful of positions. It does look like the same person.
8604.40s:  And yeah. Yeah, I don't see much here.
8624.32s:  These are pretty small too, right? Like 32,000, 28, 28. None of these kind of things are going to
8630.24s:  like move the market. So yeah, I don't really see much here, man. Sorry, but yeah, the 20 and a half
8638.88s:  look actually kind of quiet to me. As always, I'm always happy to take a look and always enjoy
8645.84s:  trying to see if we can find something. But yeah, age says, fuck the test. I want generational
8650.64s:  wealth. I hope you get it, man. I really do. That's one of the things that scares me, honestly,
8656.88s:  about the GameStop movement and the GameStop community is because I know so many people are
8661.12s:  kind of leaning on it is a way to change their lot in life, which I cannot identify more with. I
8668.32s:  grew up poor. So I really get that. But the one thing I would say, and again, this is just my
8675.92s:  perspective, I absolutely hope the GameStop thing works out for you guys to hit that generational
8683.04s:  wealth. That would be incredible. But I also think it's important to identify for like every case
8690.56s:  that you find somebody like Roy and Kitty, who does what he does, like he is truly an outlier.
8696.96s:  Like he truly isn't anomaly. But for every case that you see of him, there are quite literally
8703.20s:  are hundreds of thousands of other people that have attempted similar permutations and fail.
8711.12s:  So the way that I look at it is I look at trading GameStop as a portion of my portfolio.
8719.76s:  But I treat risk very differently, obviously, than somebody like Roy and Kitty, who again,
8724.08s:  I've tremendous respect for. But if it's for the people that are out there trying to actually
8729.84s:  attain generational wealth or to really change their lot in life, I would just consider the
8737.28s:  I would consider the calculus, right? Like I would look at the probability of that happening
8741.92s:  with your current portfolio size through a vector like GameStop versus the probability of that
8747.20s:  happening through another vector, maybe like a compilation of GameStop and then maybe some other
8755.68s:  trading vehicles if you have like decent experience or something. The thing that just makes me nervous
8761.68s:  is that I'm nervous that there's going to be a lot of people that are just going to get hurt
8765.52s:  and be holding the bag. And I genuinely don't want to see that. It's one of the reasons why I
8769.12s:  spend two and a half hours hanging out with you guys on a Saturday, which genuinely I enjoy this.
8774.56s:  I really enjoy spending the time with you all. But part of what I try to do is see if I can't share
8780.16s:  some other pieces to this broader puzzle, not just for GameStop, but broadly to hopefully help people
8787.20s:  build that broader skill set if it's of interest. So for the people that want to go yellow and
8793.60s:  all into GameStop, I love that. And if it's something that you really believe in and it's
8798.48s:  throughout you want to go, I cannot tell you how much I hope that it plays out. And then for those
8805.60s:  that are trying to achieve generational wealth and maybe they have a risk tolerance, maybe
8811.36s:  closer to mine where I'm not comfortable yolowing everything I have into an individual ticker,
8816.32s:  pretty much anything individual other than like an index ETF personally. Then I would just kind of
8823.04s:  build a slightly different portfolio that gives me the exposure to GameStop that I want like I have
8827.92s:  and then do some other stuff on the side. But you can make a lot of money in the markets.
8834.80s:  That's what it comes down to. You can really change your lot in life. And one of the coolest
8840.24s:  things about markets is that it is a purely solo endeavor. It's all you. So there's nobody that
8846.16s:  makes sure you're doing the right thing. There's nobody that makes sure that you have a plan
8850.00s:  before you're placing a trade. There's nobody that bosses you around at all. That's part of the
8855.60s:  beauty. But that's also one of the issues that a lot of people have is when you have all of that
8861.60s:  freedom, you kind of have to be your own boss. And I think a lot of people maybe don't consider
8868.08s:  that part of the freedom as much as they should. So I cannot tell you how much I enjoy hanging out
8875.36s:  with you all. It's an absolute blast. I'm stoked to continue following GameStop. We'll see what it
8879.76s:  does is coming week. The breath of fresh air with volume is sick. So I am yeah, I'm all eyes and
8886.80s:  ears on it. You'll obviously see a video pop out tomorrow about kind of GameStop and then the week
8892.40s:  ahead. So I hope everybody has a killer weekend. Thanks for hanging out for a while. Be an outlier,
8897.52s:  be an ape, be an outlier ape. Whichever version of those applies to you. And I will see you all later.
8905.20s:  Or next week on for another GME live stream. Take care everybody.
