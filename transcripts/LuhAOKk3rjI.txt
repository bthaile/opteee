0.00s:  What's up everyone? Welcome back to
2.86s:  OutLayer's Happy Friday. We had a
5.22s:  really interesting day,
6.90s:  specifically from GME,
8.50s:  if we're being completely honest,
10.14s:  but well, we got feedback loop,
11.90s:  got to kill that.
13.14s:  But so we have a different session
16.86s:  in line for today.
18.54s:  This is specifically a
20.44s:  options trading workshop geared
22.98s:  towards beginners.
24.58s:  So we have a few things we're
25.98s:  going to talk about.
26.78s:  I have a couple topics that I've
28.58s:  selected from conversations that
30.34s:  I've seen that I actually want
31.70s:  to work through with you.
32.98s:  So you can chat in specific
35.34s:  elements or questions about
36.58s:  these topics that you have or
37.88s:  concepts that you want to explore
39.18s:  more deeply.
40.26s:  And we can do that.
41.22s:  And then I also have some
42.30s:  questions that folks dropped
43.98s:  on the YouTube post that I made
47.38s:  about the event.
48.26s:  So we'll hit those.
49.34s:  But feel free to chat in at any
52.74s:  point if there's something I'm
54.02s:  talking about that confuses you.
56.02s:  If there is a topic related to
57.58s:  what we're talking about that you
58.70s:  want to dive into, if there's an
60.34s:  unrelated topic that you have in
61.70s:  the back of your mind that you've
62.78s:  been wanting to understand or
64.54s:  explore that is all fair game.
66.74s:  My entire goal for you walking away
69.30s:  from this, especially from a
70.94s:  beginner's perspective is I
73.34s:  would love if there are maybe
75.66s:  three takeaways that you
77.74s:  definitively can point that at
79.38s:  the end of the session.
80.14s:  So that's what I'm aiming to
81.66s:  give you.
82.66s:  The other thing is based on where
85.06s:  we go during the session at the
86.82s:  end of the session, I'll give you
88.22s:  some follow up stuff to take a
90.02s:  look at and that I think might
91.78s:  be a reasonable progression for
93.34s:  you.
93.86s:  Now in order to help me, if you
96.02s:  can in the chat, just throw in
98.46s:  what your options trading
100.18s:  experience is, meaning how long
102.62s:  you've been trading options and
104.46s:  what your general style is, that
106.54s:  will be super, super helpful for
108.58s:  me as I move through the rest of
110.10s:  the session to kind of paint
111.54s:  what I'm talking about in light
113.54s:  of your individual experience.
117.54s:  So to kick us off, let's start
119.42s:  with talking a little bit about
122.66s:  the traps of trading options.
124.62s:  The reason why I want to start
125.62s:  with this is because it is really,
128.74s:  really important to understand the
130.70s:  landscape that we're interacting
133.02s:  with.
133.78s:  So there's a few things I want to
135.82s:  highlight here.
137.26s:  The main thing is fully
141.02s:  comprehending how important it is.
145.38s:  What system can look like in the
148.38s:  long run?
149.38s:  So we'll get into that in just a
150.86s:  second.
151.38s:  So no use says no experience.
153.34s:  OK.
154.34s:  And then some other says actual
155.66s:  experience or what we told our
156.70s:  brokers to get ungated.
157.90s:  That's a great question.
159.46s:  But we'll probably go actual
160.82s:  experience.
161.66s:  The brokers, we all know, you
162.98s:  know, you might not give them the
164.74s:  straight up truth.
167.30s:  But you do what you got to do in
168.58s:  here.
169.10s:  Let's keep it a buck so that I can
172.98s:  kind of tailor what we're talking
174.26s:  about for you.
175.50s:  J. Kim has no experience either
178.02s:  metal zone.
178.78s:  I bought calls once expired
180.54s:  worthless.
181.10s:  That sounds exactly about right?
182.90s:  Actually, we can talk about that
184.78s:  exact thing.
186.18s:  I will grab that and throw it into
189.78s:  our agenda.
191.18s:  I specifically will talk about how
193.46s:  to buy calls without them
195.02s:  expiring worthless.
196.66s:  I think that would be really useful.
199.82s:  All right.
200.58s:  Throw this in here.
204.58s:  One of our other questions to hit
206.66s:  in a little bit.
208.42s:  We've all been there, by the way,
210.30s:  the fact that they expire
211.42s:  worthless.
213.30s:  Cool.
214.82s:  And then,
216.46s:  that's a tough,
217.70s:  that's a tough name.
218.86s:  Looks like Patricia, that's
220.14s:  actually my mom's name.
221.62s:  But the the Y and the J
225.38s:  are super confusing.
226.66s:  So Pat, Pat, we could do Pat.
229.62s:  Pat also has no experience.
230.98s:  OK.
231.74s:  So I guess then, since we have a
233.94s:  heavy cohort of zero experience,
237.94s:  I actually am going to grab another
241.34s:  presentation that I've given before
244.26s:  that I think offers at least a
246.22s:  reasonable introduction that we can
248.26s:  work through quickly.
249.82s:  And then we can get into kind of
251.94s:  these other things.
252.70s:  Because I think if you guys have no
254.46s:  experience, the process of selecting
256.34s:  a strike or selecting an expiration
258.78s:  that might be actually a little too
260.62s:  deep and a little too confusing,
263.42s:  which I do not want.
265.26s:  So what I'm going to do is grab a
268.06s:  different presentation really
269.54s:  quick.
270.50s:  And we will flip through this
272.62s:  super fast.
274.82s:  And then.
277.58s:  I think that'll get us in the right
278.78s:  spot.
279.50s:  OK.
281.30s:  So let's talk about options.
285.94s:  What they are, how they fit into
286.98s:  our portfolio.
289.14s:  I'll skip through all this.
290.14s:  None of this stuff matters.
291.22s:  Although fun fact, I was stabbed in
293.42s:  the hand in high school, which is
295.02s:  kind of cool.
295.54s:  And then this is the dude that got me
296.98s:  into trading back in high school
298.30s:  right there.
299.42s:  But all that stuff aside, that's
300.94s:  what I do.
301.54s:  None of that matters to you.
303.38s:  This, I guess we can start here.
305.66s:  So here's the deal with trading.
308.30s:  In general, it's completely
310.02s:  misunderstood by most people
311.38s:  because we think it's access to
313.62s:  fast easy money and it's not.
315.38s:  It genuinely is not.
316.86s:  Now, the cool part is because it is
319.54s:  not that is where the opportunity
322.22s:  lies.
323.22s:  Imagine if we had a system that was
325.86s:  just access to fast easy money
327.70s:  who wouldn't do that, right?
329.70s:  AKA that would price the system
331.82s:  out.
332.30s:  It wouldn't exist anymore.
334.26s:  So the fact that it's not like
336.18s:  that is a massive opportunity.
339.18s:  I've made a lot of money trading
341.62s:  options from my start in 2007.
343.98s:  Millions of dollars literally.
345.82s:  However, that should not be
348.54s:  misconstrued to mean it's easy
351.26s:  because it genuinely is not.
353.82s:  So the important part here, in my
356.14s:  opinion, is to understand what we're
358.30s:  trying to do so that we can be more
359.98s:  successful at doing it.
361.86s:  Because if you come into this
363.10s:  under the guise that this is easy
365.26s:  money, you're probably going to
366.78s:  apply the correct methodology for
368.98s:  something that would be easy, meaning
370.54s:  we're not putting in a ton of effort.
371.78s:  We're not actually trying that hard
373.26s:  because we think it's easy.
374.54s:  And then it doesn't work.
375.50s:  We don't want that.
376.82s:  So all of this is to say trading is
379.74s:  difficult, but in my opinion, if you
382.74s:  take it seriously, it is entirely
384.90s:  worth the time and effort.
386.38s:  That's what it boils down to here.
388.50s:  All right.
389.94s:  When we're trading, it's super
391.50s:  important to be organized.
392.78s:  That's all this means there are
394.02s:  a couple of resources here to give
395.46s:  you some ideas.
396.06s:  You can take a screenshot of this
398.06s:  and to get an idea of what these
399.98s:  documents are, how we integrate
401.38s:  them.
402.06s:  All of this boils down to here
404.66s:  that just like in high school and
406.62s:  college, whatever your education is,
408.38s:  at some point you would have been
409.50s:  handed a syllabus.
411.06s:  That syllabus outlines what you're
412.66s:  doing, what, how you grade and
415.46s:  assess your proficiency, those kinds
417.06s:  of details are captured in there.
418.94s:  That's what this series of
420.82s:  documents are designed to do to
422.50s:  provide that kind of structure for
423.82s:  you. That's all.
425.22s:  Okay. Now let's talk about where
427.34s:  kind of derivatives fit into this
428.74s:  landscape and how to behave.
430.30s:  So we have this broad bucket of
431.86s:  things called securities.
433.10s:  These are just tradable elements of
434.46s:  the markets.
435.46s:  They're broken down into a few
436.82s:  different sub buckets.
437.94s:  We have equities, derivatives and
439.26s:  debt.
440.06s:  Debt is kind of something most of
442.74s:  you might be familiar with, but
443.82s:  it's access to things like bonds,
445.34s:  notes, products that have a
447.86s:  completely different structure than
449.38s:  kind of the other two products
450.66s:  we're going to talk about.
451.86s:  But you should know that this bucket
453.10s:  exists.
454.34s:  Then we have equities which you all
456.94s:  probably are familiar with.
458.62s:  Those are things like stocks, ETFs,
461.70s:  exchange traded funds, those kinds
463.98s:  of products.
464.98s:  And then we have derivatives.
466.50s:  Derivatives are really, really
468.10s:  interesting because as you'll find
470.38s:  out in a second, these are products
472.42s:  whose value actually derives from
475.50s:  other things.
477.10s:  So things like equities and things
478.50s:  like debt.
479.58s:  So these are contracts that
481.82s:  pertain to other things, which
483.82s:  I'll explain more in a few
485.34s:  moments.
486.38s:  In derivatives, we have a couple
488.26s:  big buckets like options futures.
490.34s:  There's way more than options and
492.62s:  futures.
493.62s:  But for most people, this is a
495.98s:  great starting point and there's
497.30s:  no need to add a ton of unnecessary
499.62s:  noise in the beginning.
500.46s:  Just know that there's more to all
502.54s:  of these buckets than what I have
504.18s:  listed here.
505.18s:  These are just a couple examples.
507.78s:  OK, so what I want to talk about
510.38s:  quickly is why options are
512.62s:  interesting to trade.
513.82s:  And then I'm going to get into kind
515.02s:  of what they are in a nutshell.
517.58s:  So options inherently add complexity
520.18s:  to whatever we're doing.
521.78s:  If you're buying or selling stock,
524.10s:  it's actually quite straightforward.
527.06s:  So if we take a look at something
529.54s:  like spy and you buy shares of stock,
534.74s:  you just buy shares of spy.
536.50s:  A couple of things can happen.
537.70s:  It can go up or it can go down.
540.86s:  Pretty much it.
542.10s:  And the way you make money or lose
543.82s:  money is depending on if it goes up
545.90s:  or if it goes down.
547.26s:  Again, pretty simple.
548.94s:  If you introduce options to this equation,
552.10s:  there are other profit factors that
554.62s:  now matter quite a lot.
556.74s:  And let me grab this back so I can show you some of them.
560.90s:  So we still care about direction a lot
563.90s:  as options traders.
565.14s:  It's kind of the most important thing
566.66s:  that we have available to us.
568.34s:  But there are these other inputs
570.50s:  that impact our positions, things
573.06s:  like volatility, how much something moves,
575.62s:  that impacts the pricing of options.
578.62s:  The time frame, things that have longer duration contracts,
583.22s:  typically are more expensive than shorter duration contracts.
586.42s:  As time passes, the value of the contract slowly decays.
591.90s:  Interest rates can even impact options.
594.86s:  This is less important up front for you guys,
597.62s:  just being completely transparent,
599.02s:  but you should know it exists.
600.58s:  And we'll talk more about this a little bit later.
603.18s:  So if we're talking about trading options,
605.74s:  and I say that I like trading options,
607.30s:  but I just gave you a bunch of issues
609.74s:  that options perspectiveally add to our trading process
615.06s:  than why?
615.66s:  Why would we do this?
616.98s:  Well, it's for a few specific payoff reasons.
621.14s:  They are leveraged products, which
623.14s:  means you control more money with a little bit amount of money.
627.38s:  They have completely customizable risk and reward payoff
633.58s:  structures.
634.78s:  That hands down is what makes options what they are.
639.58s:  It's why we call them strategic investments.
642.94s:  So what does that mean?
643.86s:  Well, if we pop over here, let's say
646.10s:  that you bought shares of Spy.
647.66s:  If Spy goes up by $1, you make $1 on your share.
652.98s:  There are a completely different set of rules
656.54s:  that apply to options.
658.22s:  And on that $1 movement, you can make more than $1.
662.62s:  You can also make movement.
664.18s:  Even you can also make money if it
666.30s:  makes a movement that's slightly against your position,
668.78s:  but not too heavily.
670.42s:  You can also trade markets that are going up like this,
673.58s:  that are going down like this, that are going sideways
675.90s:  like this.
676.94s:  It also gives you the ability to trade
679.06s:  a completely different asset class called volatility, which
682.86s:  we'll touch on that a little bit later.
684.54s:  This gets very, very deep pretty quickly.
687.86s:  So we'll talk about some elements of this, however,
691.50s:  just know that there's literally an entire different asset
694.70s:  class that you have direct exposure to when you trade options.
698.46s:  So you click on the wrong thing coming back to this.
701.86s:  So that in a nutshell is why options
706.22s:  become really fascinating products to trade,
709.82s:  because they give you the ability
711.50s:  to completely customize what you're trying to do.
713.70s:  If you want to decrease risk, you can use options for that.
717.18s:  If you want to increase leverage options, can do that.
720.62s:  If you want to trade for income options, can do that.
723.78s:  But again, it adds complexity.
726.06s:  So it's really important to know that there
728.94s:  is a give and take relationship to using these products
732.54s:  that require some level of understanding, which hopefully
735.62s:  will achieve by the end of this video.
738.46s:  So I'll take a pause there up front.
740.94s:  And I want to ask you guys if there's
742.54s:  any questions on what we've covered so far.
745.34s:  The other thing I would love to ask you here
746.94s:  is if there's any preconceived notions
749.50s:  that you have about options.
750.58s:  So when you think about options, what comes to mind?
753.86s:  Do you think that they're super risky?
756.30s:  Do you think that you shouldn't trade them at all?
758.50s:  Do you think that you need a ton of money
760.14s:  to trade them, those kinds of things?
762.22s:  And as you guys are kind of sharing some of that with me here,
766.42s:  we will move on to the next slide.
768.46s:  I'm going to leave this up for a second without even talking
771.02s:  just yet.
772.14s:  And we'll dive into it a bit more.
774.74s:  We'll stretch those stocks on steroids.
777.18s:  They could be, I get your point there,
779.82s:  and I know that you're familiar with options to a degree.
783.46s:  But I think the thing with options
786.26s:  is that they can be stocks on steroids
788.38s:  or they could be stocks not on steroids.
791.34s:  I think that's actually fair in version.
793.42s:  They literally can decrease your risk, which
796.62s:  is important to understand with derivatives.
801.54s:  MetalZone says like straddles will limit your downside.
804.66s:  They can.
805.46s:  That's a great point.
806.62s:  So trading things like, yeah, that's a joke.
809.70s:  That's perfect.
810.38s:  It could be stocks on steroids or stocks on wheat.
812.42s:  That's there we go.
814.78s:  Back to you, MetalZone straddles,
816.98s:  depending on if you buy or sell them.
819.34s:  So I think it's important to understand
822.62s:  how the buy-sell relationship works
825.26s:  and what that results in in terms of a risk profile, which
829.46s:  we'll talk about.
831.18s:  Rudy says losing thousands and thousands of dollars
834.70s:  on one contract is there such a thing like that that can happen?
837.70s:  Absolutely.
838.26s:  There is.
838.74s:  There absolutely is.
839.86s:  Now, is it easy to avoid?
841.78s:  Absolutely.
842.46s:  There's no reason for that to happen.
844.50s:  It's kind of like the idea of if you are trying
849.38s:  to think of a good analogy.
850.94s:  If there's two buildings and your job
853.34s:  is to walk across the two buildings,
855.42s:  and you have a few choices, you can either take the tight rope
859.06s:  or you can take the bridge.
861.02s:  They have different profiles about them.
864.14s:  And let's say at the end, at the other side of the bridge,
868.02s:  there's different payoffs.
869.10s:  So the one that has the tight rope, let's say
871.14s:  there's a bunch of money there.
872.38s:  And the one with the bridge, there's less money there.
874.74s:  That's essentially option-strating.
876.18s:  You can take the tight rope.
877.62s:  The lower probability that you're going to make it,
879.50s:  higher probability that you are going to fall and plummet
882.02s:  to your death and not see that money.
884.58s:  But if you do make it, there's a ton of money on the other side.
887.42s:  Or you can take the much more sure bet and walk across the bridge.
892.22s:  There's going to be less money there,
893.54s:  but it's still there for you to grab.
895.78s:  So I think that that is an important way
898.90s:  to kind of think about the risk profiles available to you guys.
904.98s:  Jay says, I've definitely thought
906.90s:  that you need a decent bit of starting capital
909.26s:  to trade options, also a little scary about the leverage.
912.70s:  Yeah, so that's another great point.
915.02s:  And there's kind of a two-sided answer to this.
919.62s:  The first side is, yes, you don't actually
925.30s:  need a bunch of money to start.
927.82s:  But if I were to give a genuine answer
931.02s:  on reasonable starting capital, the more money you have,
934.98s:  the better off you are provided that you have good risk controls.
939.14s:  So what I mean by that is this.
941.22s:  If you have a ton of money and you're a terrible trader
944.90s:  with terrible risk controls, then there's
946.94s:  the probability that you lose all of your money.
950.74s:  So that would be a bad scenario where more money actually
953.74s:  is a bigger risk because you're not disciplined
956.30s:  and you lose the money.
958.02s:  However, trading a small amount of money
960.98s:  is very difficult because as soon as you put on any single position,
964.90s:  you tend to be oversized in terms of waiting within your portfolio,
968.82s:  you can't accept as much natural movement
972.58s:  in the underlying volatility.
974.90s:  And you essentially have really low margin for error.
979.18s:  The other thing is you really can't trade up to my strategies.
983.46s:  You're forced into trading things like vertical spreads.
986.26s:  And we'll talk about those a little bit later.
988.30s:  Vertical spreads aren't the worst thing on planet earth
990.90s:  and there are people that can trade them successfully.
993.50s:  That I think is really important to note
995.30s:  because my opinion of them is one thing
998.42s:  and my experience with them is one thing.
1000.94s:  But you should know that everything that I'm talking about
1003.22s:  is literally just from my personal experience.
1005.46s:  There's a lot of ways to do this thing.
1007.74s:  So as you hear what I'm talking about,
1009.70s:  I'm going to do my best to offer some different offshoots.
1014.66s:  So let's see.
1019.58s:  Metal Zones as I've always been interested in using them
1022.98s:  to trade sideways markets.
1025.30s:  Yeah, you can absolutely use straddles
1027.50s:  and strangles for that.
1029.34s:  Craig says this man loves to talk about options
1031.02s:  without understanding volatility.
1033.22s:  Potentially, I think I understand volatility pretty well,
1035.74s:  but maybe not.
1038.14s:  Joe says I've lost thousands of dollars on options
1040.74s:  that absolutely has happened to all of us.
1044.46s:  Hollow says far too many options
1046.58s:  are glorified lottery tickets,
1047.70s:  which is actually one of the things we'll talk about
1049.26s:  in a little bit because you're absolutely right.
1050.78s:  A lot of people look to trade the cheapest option possible
1055.26s:  and that's a giant problem
1057.30s:  because just like we saw from Metal Zone earlier,
1061.54s:  I bought calls once expired worthless.
1064.10s:  That's super, super common
1065.82s:  because if we're looking at a product again, like spy,
1069.22s:  and we take a look at the short-term options
1072.94s:  that are super far out of the money,
1074.38s:  they're very, very cheap.
1075.98s:  But there's a reason why they're so cheap
1078.02s:  because the probability of them returning
1080.90s:  a positive yield is relatively low.
1083.78s:  And we'll talk a little bit more about how to read things
1086.90s:  like the gamma and theta on the options
1089.94s:  so that you get a sense of how they'll behave as time moves
1092.62s:  or as the underlying moves.
1094.42s:  But the point being is a lot of times
1096.42s:  the cheaper the options are,
1098.78s:  the bigger movement required from a buying perspective
1102.06s:  in order for them to actually return anything.
1104.06s:  So yeah, it's a really, really important point.
1111.54s:  Oh, let's see.
1112.78s:  No, you says I've always had the impression
1115.18s:  that the barrier to entry is high.
1117.50s:  Yeah, that's absolutely true.
1119.06s:  That's not wrong at all.
1120.98s:  So again, it's high in the sense that options
1125.14s:  add more complexity, for sure, like we talked about before.
1128.66s:  But it's like anything else.
1130.26s:  Once you understand the rules set,
1131.98s:  it's not that, it's really not that bad.
1134.78s:  And the cool part is is that the rules
1136.86s:  will carry over over time.
1139.02s:  So the way that I think about it is,
1140.94s:  imagine if you're playing a sport,
1143.74s:  the first time you play that sport,
1145.46s:  the barrier to entry is pretty high.
1147.06s:  You have to learn all the rules.
1148.30s:  You have to make sure that your playing
1151.62s:  is best as you can within a certain rules set.
1154.46s:  And that can take a little time to get used to.
1157.34s:  Before you even can get to a point
1158.86s:  where you can optimize what you're doing
1160.82s:  to essentially leverage the rules set,
1163.34s:  to move even better in the correct direction,
1166.90s:  meaning there are some sports like you should see.
1169.38s:  There are certain rules that you can bend
1171.46s:  to benefit your play style.
1173.54s:  So with options, it's the same thing.
1176.50s:  You have to understand the rules.
1178.22s:  And there are a lot of them upfront.
1180.34s:  And there are a lot of small details and options
1183.34s:  that are tricky to pick up.
1184.90s:  But once you understand them, they're universal.
1188.54s:  They're there, they don't change.
1190.22s:  And that gives you the ability to benefit from the rules set.
1194.54s:  So there is a relatively high barrier to entry,
1198.10s:  but like learning any other skill set,
1200.02s:  once you learn the skill set,
1201.94s:  it's very, very manageable, I think.
1205.30s:  Greg says, I love talking about structures like its strategy.
1210.46s:  Use the coverage strangle because it's the best.
1213.14s:  Not so much.
1214.22s:  So when we talk about structures and strategy,
1217.34s:  again, to be clear, right, I think it's a pedantic point
1220.74s:  in the framing there, but it's fine to highlight it.
1223.54s:  So if we think about structure,
1225.10s:  it's literally just a combination of options.
1227.58s:  But most of the time when we're referring to structures,
1230.34s:  we're discussing them in the context of strategy.
1233.38s:  Because very infrequently, are we talking about option structures
1238.14s:  just to talk about them?
1239.26s:  We're typically talking about them in the context of trading them,
1242.14s:  which would be strategy.
1243.90s:  So it's a fair point, but something to highlight.
1247.62s:  When somebody says the term option structure,
1250.02s:  they literally just mean the combination of whatever legs
1254.06s:  of the option that we're talking about.
1257.34s:  Strategy is the deployment of that structure.
1260.26s:  How you use that structure.
1262.50s:  So yeah, it's a fair point to bring up.
1264.90s:  And you'll hear people colloquially,
1268.14s:  typically refer to it as strategy.
1269.90s:  Because again, the vast majority of the time,
1272.26s:  we're not talking about the structures in a vacuum
1274.82s:  to just talk about structures.
1276.50s:  We're talking about them in the context of using them in trading,
1279.98s:  which would be strategy.
1282.78s:  StrayJays says barriers, not as high as you'd think,
1286.22s:  but it gets steep fast.
1287.18s:  That's a great way to phrase it.
1288.54s:  That's a great way to phrase it.
1290.22s:  And then John says many blind spots
1291.78s:  in learning to trade options.
1292.86s:  Now, that's a good point, but I think as we go through this,
1296.78s:  you'll probably find that there are some general rule sets
1299.70s:  you can apply so that you stay safe.
1303.26s:  And then as you gain competence,
1305.70s:  you can scope out a little bit more,
1307.78s:  a little bit more, a little bit more
1309.58s:  without putting yourself in danger.
1311.70s:  When I think about probably one of the primary issues
1316.46s:  with new traders is that they tend to get in
1320.94s:  over their skis too fast,
1322.54s:  and then they struggle massively.
1324.42s:  Because they're exposing themselves to risk
1327.42s:  that they don't even identify.
1329.70s:  Craig says strategy is longer short-vol,
1332.34s:  thanks for confirmation that your clue is.
1334.70s:  Yeah, I mean,
1336.74s:  Jason's Craig has no chill.
1337.90s:  Yeah, well, that's kind of some internet people will be like that.
1340.78s:  But again, like saying strategy is longer short-vol,
1343.26s:  that can be a structure, right?
1344.86s:  So I can have a short straddle that is short-vol.
1350.22s:  That's still just a structure.
1352.14s:  So to be completely honest, Craig,
1355.18s:  your point is actually completely incorrect.
1357.98s:  Because being longer short-vol can be just a structure.
1361.70s:  But the bigger point here is like I was mentioning earlier,
1364.66s:  it's just pedantic, right?
1366.18s:  Like to try and draw the demarcation between structure
1370.42s:  and strategy like you are is literally just
1373.14s:  to try to pick a word fight.
1374.26s:  It's not really productive for anybody.
1377.42s:  So back over to introduction to derivatives.
1382.14s:  So as we talked about before,
1384.62s:  a derivative is a product whose value is derived
1388.82s:  from something else.
1389.62s:  That's what makes it a derivative.
1391.70s:  So sometimes I like to use the deed to a house as an analogy.
1396.78s:  So if you think about the D to a house,
1399.10s:  it's just a piece of paper.
1400.34s:  This is an iPad, but pretend it's paper,
1402.98s:  and it's not worth anything.
1404.62s:  However, that deed gives you rights to real property,
1408.94s:  a real asset.
1410.42s:  So this piece of paper starts to take on
1414.10s:  a slightly different value perspective
1415.90s:  because whoever holds the deed has rights to the property.
1420.34s:  So it's kind of a loose analogy,
1422.06s:  but the overall point behind that
1426.14s:  is that you can use options as a tool to grant yourself access
1431.82s:  or different relationships with the underlying product
1434.14s:  which you'll see in this chart below.
1437.46s:  Options are contracts between two people.
1440.58s:  There's always a buyer and seller,
1442.22s:  and this is actually one of the cool parts about them
1443.82s:  because they differ than things like stock,
1446.70s:  where stock there is a limited amount.
1448.70s:  There's only the number of shares that exist.
1450.58s:  Options are very different.
1452.06s:  Options can be created at will.
1454.18s:  There's no rules around them provided
1456.50s:  that there's a counterparty to create the contract.
1460.34s:  Whenever that contract is started,
1463.42s:  there's two sides to every options position.
1466.70s:  There's a buyer and a seller.
1468.78s:  The vast majority of the time you as the market participant
1472.66s:  are going to be paired with a market maker.
1476.30s:  However, over time, that market maker
1479.14s:  is looking to offload their risk.
1481.38s:  So eventually the other side of your contract
1483.86s:  can be another trader,
1485.58s:  but the vast majority of the time,
1487.38s:  it's going to be a market maker at least to open your position.
1490.66s:  Whoever buys the option,
1493.46s:  they have a right to do something.
1496.66s:  So if you buy calls or sell puts,
1500.98s:  I'm sorry, or buy puts, I gotta fix this.
1507.78s:  Jay says, is this recorded by any chance?
1509.94s:  Yeah, so it'll be available on YouTube Live.
1512.90s:  So, oh, I see what I was writing here.
1515.58s:  So if you buy calls,
1518.06s:  you essentially have the right to buy shares at a set price.
1523.46s:  If you buy puts, you have the right to sell shares
1528.30s:  at a set price by a specific date.
1530.26s:  And we'll talk about the details
1531.54s:  and what those actually look like.
1533.50s:  Sellers, then we receive money to fulfill
1538.38s:  the other side of this trade.
1541.42s:  So if I sell a call,
1544.46s:  then I now have the obligation
1548.38s:  to then take the other side of that trade.
1551.42s:  So we'll talk about settlement in a little bit,
1554.66s:  which is a really important element here.
1557.10s:  The main takeaway from this point
1559.26s:  is that the buyer of an option has the right
1563.10s:  to do something with that option.
1565.58s:  The seller of an option, whether it's a call
1569.06s:  or a put, is obligated to do something.
1573.38s:  So notice how I just use those terms, calls and puts.
1576.94s:  There are two kinds of options.
1578.62s:  Those are the two.
1580.30s:  Now, universally, they have some traits about them
1585.02s:  that are really useful to note.
1586.82s:  And you can take a look at that here.
1589.38s:  So calls grant the buyer the right to buy shares.
1595.38s:  I'm sorry, long puts grant the buyer the right to sell shares,
1600.38s:  which is what we talked about up here.
1603.38s:  And then on the short side,
1605.38s:  which is another term that we use for selling options,
1609.38s:  I purposely use these different terms in here
1612.38s:  because you'll hear traders refer to all of them,
1615.38s:  but they do have different meanings,
1617.38s:  kind of like what Craig was talking about before,
1619.38s:  like structures and strategy,
1621.38s:  they get colloquially mashed up.
1623.38s:  And it's the same thing with buying, being long
1626.38s:  or having a debit to open a position.
1630.38s:  So in that sense,
1633.38s:  you'll find a lot of terminology has tons of different meanings.
1638.38s:  Craig says it's productive to have a baseline understanding
1641.38s:  of trading options and not mistaken
1643.38s:  an option structure is having an edge.
1646.38s:  Again, I think you're kind of taking a look at that.
1649.38s:  Again, I think you're kind of taking something multiple steps
1652.38s:  beyond what I said.
1654.38s:  And it's actually a great point because a structure has no edge.
1657.38s:  And there's no point in the video that I said a structure has an edge.
1660.38s:  But it's kind of clear that you're just looking to talk,
1664.38s:  just to talk.
1665.38s:  So you're doing great, though, by the way.
1668.38s:  Anyways, back to actual learning about options.
1673.38s:  So when we look at the term short,
1678.38s:  when it pertains to the transaction to open a position,
1681.38s:  that absolutely means that you sold to open.
1687.38s:  So if you're short in option,
1689.38s:  that's synonymous with sold to open.
1692.38s:  If you're long in option,
1695.38s:  it means that you bought to open.
1698.38s:  Big A says, who hurt you, Craig?
1700.38s:  Leave, man.
1701.38s:  Yeah, it's all good, dude.
1702.38s:  It's honestly, we can kick Craig out whenever we want.
1705.38s:  I try not to do that, right?
1707.38s:  So overall goal is to give people an opportunity to interact like people.
1711.38s:  But you can tell from the chat so far that he just wants to argue a little bit,
1715.38s:  which is you can tell I like arguing.
1717.38s:  So I'm okay with it.
1720.38s:  Provided that he can stay respectful.
1722.38s:  I don't really care.
1724.38s:  J Kim says, if you're selling to open,
1726.38s:  who did you borrow the option from?
1728.38s:  Great question.
1730.38s:  So if you're selling to open,
1733.38s:  you don't have to borrow anything.
1735.38s:  And that is a fantastic point.
1737.38s:  You simply are starting a new contract.
1740.38s:  So remember when we were talking about the correlation between options and shares of stock.
1747.38s:  Shares have a finite number and they have to be borrowed if you sell to open.
1752.38s:  With options, it's completely different.
1754.38s:  You literally enter a agreement with somebody else and you can create those agreements at will.
1760.38s:  So technically speaking, there's no borrowing at the point of selling an option.
1766.38s:  You're creating a new contract taking the short side of it.
1769.38s:  Let me know if that makes sense.
1773.38s:  Craig says selling a course on options, which he doesn't understand.
1777.38s:  Let's also again, could you show me the course that I have?
1780.38s:  Because I don't, but.
1783.38s:  Actually, I think we're.
1786.38s:  We're about here. We'll put you on time out.
1788.38s:  Actually, we'll just give you like a couple minutes.
1790.38s:  We'll give you like a five minutes to see if you're able to.
1794.38s:  Get yourself together.
1797.38s:  It's actually hilarious that you can time out somebody on a YouTube live.
1801.38s:  And it literally feels like I'm doing that to a child.
1804.38s:  It's my favorite thing.
1805.38s:  The fact that there's a grown human being that just got put in time out.
1809.38s:  That's hilarious.
1812.38s:  Okay, cool. So Jay's following along. That's perfect.
1814.38s:  Yeah, that's one of the fascinating points about options actually is they maintain that capability that they can be created at will.
1822.38s:  All right, so let's look at the common traits between calls and puts and how they react to some of those different conditions that we talked about before.
1832.38s:  So.
1834.38s:  If the underlying, which is another term for stock, I use stock here because most people know what a stock is, but I'll use underlying interchangeably because it's not always a stock.
1845.38s:  Again, it's another pedantic point like our friend Craig probably would want to argue about, but materially it doesn't make a absolute difference at all other than knowing the difference, which is important.
1856.38s:  For a beginner perspective, you can insert stock underlying. It's all the same context here.
1862.38s:  The reason why we differentiate between them, those because again, if we go back here, you realize that stock is a type of equity. However, you can trade options on ETFs.
1871.38s:  You can trade them on bonds notes, other kinds of products. So that's the difference here.
1877.38s:  So when we take a look at when the underlying price moves.
1882.38s:  We're saying that the underlying goes up or the underlying goes down. The underlying goes up calls will always appreciate and value across the board. All of them will.
1893.38s:  And if the underlying goes down calls across the board will depreciate, go down and value.
1901.38s:  The puts you'll notice there are the inverse as the underlying goes up puts become less expensive. They depreciate.
1910.38s:  And as the underlying goes down puts become more expensive. They appreciate.
1916.38s:  An interesting part with options that kind of makes them a little easier on the volatility side of things is that volatility impacts the premium of options generally is the same.
1927.38s:  Again, there's always slight nuances. Once you get into the practical applications of things, but if volatility goes up both call and put premium goes up.
1938.38s:  If volatility goes down both call and put premium goes down.
1944.38s:  So when I'm referring to premium in this sense, you'll notice that options contracts have a handful of very specific components.
1953.38s:  And in this case, one of those components is premium that's simply the value of the option.
1961.38s:  So when we look at the price of a stock that share price, that's the value of the stock options have their own value.
1971.38s:  And the reason being is because that contract gives people the right to do something or the obligation to do something.
1979.38s:  And there's a price associated with that. Now the way to think about this using the real estate example before.
1986.38s:  Again, it's not a pure one to one, but it's pretty close where if you think about whole sailing a house.
1993.38s:  So there's somebody that can essentially trade the right to purchase a property.
1999.38s:  And there's a premium associated with that right. It's kind of the same thing here.
2004.38s:  The other components of a contract are whatever underlying we're referring to.
2009.38s:  So a example of this is this all of these options in here listed in this chain, which will become more familiar with in a little bit.
2020.38s:  All of them only pertain to spy, which is the underlying. This is an ETF in this case.
2028.38s:  All of these pertain only to spy. So that's the underlying component.
2034.38s:  Days to expiration is how long is this agreement good for the reason why this matters is imagine you and I were to make a bet.
2044.38s:  And the bet was that the weather tomorrow, I live in San Diego and today it was kind of cloudy. Maybe I forgot what the high was maybe like high sixties.
2053.38s:  And if I were to make a bet that in the future, the weather is going to be also 68 degrees.
2061.38s:  If I were to make that bet in the short term, we kind of know what the probability of it being 60 degrees pretty high.
2069.38s:  But if that bet was for a really long time.
2073.38s:  And the wager was if at some point we need to be higher than 68 degrees.
2081.38s:  Where is it more probable that the temperature will be higher than 68 degrees within one day or within 360 days over the course of the year.
2092.38s:  Probably over the course of the year.
2095.38s:  So when we're looking at stuff like this, it's important to understand that the time component to options increase the premium the longer the days to expiration the DTE.
2107.38s:  The more expensive options will be the strike price. This is super important because when we talk about the right to buy shares or the this the right to sell shares or the obligation to buy or the obligation to sell.
2124.38s:  In this case.
2127.38s:  What price are we talking about? Where do we buy the shares at? What price you do it at the strike price.
2133.38s:  So again, it's kind of like using the D to the house.
2137.38s:  And on the D to the house or probably not on the sale contract technically.
2142.38s:  There will be a agreed price.
2145.38s:  That is the strike price of an option.
2148.38s:  Whatever you the seller and the counterparty the buyer or vice versa are agreeing to look at.
2154.38s:  So let's take a look at some of these traits in this section.
2158.38s:  So if we look across all these different explorations. That's what these are.
2163.38s:  And if we look into one of them, you'll notice on the left hand side here. It's kind of small, but you should be able to see it.
2170.38s:  This is calls and then this over here says puts.
2173.38s:  Then down the center. We have just a reminder of the expiration. It's just a repeat of what's up here.
2179.38s:  And in this case, this represents 42 DTE days to expiration.
2185.38s:  Then you'll notice we have the strike price down the center.
2188.38s:  So all of this is relative to whether it's a call or put. That's why the strike is in the center.
2198.38s:  So the strike says D to the house is not a good analogy. It'd be like saying that physical stock certificate is an option.
2203.38s:  Yeah, I agree with you. Again, I said it's a loose analogy just to give people a little more familiarity with some sort of contract.
2209.38s:  Because I think giving them something like swaps is slightly less useful.
2214.38s:  But yeah, I agree with you. It's not a one-to-one analogy, which again, if you're listening, I said that.
2219.38s:  It's just an example of some other piece of a transaction that has a relationship to an asset.
2225.38s:  And bigger concepts like that might be hard to grasp if you're too focused on, you know, pedantically arguing, mood points.
2234.38s:  All right, let's get caught up on the question.
2236.38s:  So notice has have you ever had an in the money call with no liquidity?
2242.38s:  What do you mean by liquidity?
2244.38s:  Because just about any single position.
2248.38s:  So if you're not looking at a single position, you're going to have liquidity.
2252.38s:  It's just a matter at what cost. So when we're trading options, we care about having more liquidity.
2258.38s:  A notice says no buyer. Very infrequent. It could happen technically speaking, but sooner or later, the mandate for a market maker is to provide markets.
2268.38s:  The only thing is they can create whatever price is desirable to them.
2273.38s:  Let's see if we can find one. Maybe not in spy. It might not be the greatest example, but these all have.
2282.38s:  Yeah, so maybe if we look in something, this is way less liquid. We could look at like QLD.
2290.38s:  So this is a really good example.
2294.38s:  So looking at the 69 giga, strike price in QLD out in 16 Jan, which is 588 days to expiration, really long term that's called a leaps option.
2308.38s:  You can see that right here. The OI is zero and it has no volume. Nobody's transacted here. However, you can still see there's a market super wide, but there's still a market.
2320.38s:  The point being is the mandate for a market maker is to provide a market. However, again, they can quote something that's 69 strike that's super far out in time, which will widen the bit asks spread.
2332.38s:  But nonetheless, it's $4 wide. There's still a market here. So the vast majority of instances, you will have liquidity. It's just not always good liquidity.
2343.38s:  That's the kind of long more exploratory answer to your question.
2350.38s:  Let's see.
2354.38s:  Jason says, do calls and puts appreciate with higher volatility because there's more demand for options for hedging. That's definitely part of it.
2362.38s:  But the main reason why higher volatility impacts the premium for options is because when we're talking about volatility in the context of the underlying.
2373.38s:  That is is an expectation of movement. That's all volatility means it's literally movement. And it's variance. So if we take a look at something that has a higher expected movement as compared to something that has a smaller expected movement from both the buying and selling perspective of that trade.
2395.38s:  And there's more volatility more expected movement. There's higher risk potential, but also higher reward potential. So if you buy a call that has massive expected movement like GameStop right now.
2409.38s:  If you look at something like GameStop compared to something else of a relative price.
2414.38s:  The volatility right now in GameStop is very, very high and on a relative basis. And that's because it's moving so much.
2421.38s:  So if you buy a call, your potential benefit is very high. If it moves in your favor. If you sold that call, your potential risk is massive.
2432.38s:  Because if it does get one of these giant moves and you sold a call that's going to hurt your position a lot.
2438.38s:  So that's why volatility has that kind of unilateral impact in general for premium of options. The good question.
2447.38s:  Craig says use rent to own that actually is a strike price for the home. I agree with you. I think that's a good one provided that there's an existing contract for it. But yeah, I think that's a good example.
2459.38s:  He says, would you say that it's best for a beginner to day trade options or trade options that will take days in the long run, not sure if I'm making sense. No, that's making a ton of sense. That's OK.
2469.38s:  So I think the real answer to that question, which is really unsexy, but it's the genuine. I think the best way for new options traders to trade options is to paper trade them.
2481.38s:  So the reason why I say that and that's using fake money essentially the reason why I say that is because we talked about this idea of complexity and the first time I played rugby.
2491.38s:  I didn't know that you can't run behind somebody, right? You have to run forward that messed me up. So the first time I got the ball in my very first real rugby game. I ran behind somebody.
2503.38s:  Obviously, we had to give the ball up because I committed a penalty. I didn't know all of the rules and I made a giant mistake on the first one.
2512.38s:  And to be honest, I actually knew that rule, but my instincts kicked in and I just made the wrong decision in terms of where I was running.
2519.38s:  So it's similar to options where there's a lot of little rules that can be very tricky. And the fact of the matter is the probability of a brand new options trader taking a tiny amount of money and then turning it into a giant sum of money is so low.
2537.38s:  It's so low. It's so low. So I bring that up because there's really little benefit for an options trader to immediately start trading options with real money as compared to the all likelihood of them drastically scaling down their account drawing down their account, which is way more difficult for them to build up over time because as you guys know, as the percent decline builds, the percent required to get back to break even expands that's volatility decay.
2565.38s:  So it's why sometimes you can actually have a slightly underperforming strategy that outperforms something that has better high years, but worse low years that volatility variance in their P and L actually serves as drag on the returns.
2582.38s:  There's a lot of really good research on that exact principle that I think is kind of worth for people to be aware of. It's called Shannon's demon and it talks about how minimizing variance can actually increase returns without increasing top line returns.
2601.38s:  It's one of the primary approaches that I've taken to trading.
2606.38s:  All right. So I want to take a pause on this slide and see if you guys have any question.
2613.38s:  Okay, Rudy has one. Can you give me a quick example of paper trading or word of real quick? Yeah, of course. So if we use a platform like think or swim, you can go into this.
2621.38s:  I don't know if this pops up on your guys's screen or not, but in the top right here, you'll see it says on demand. If I click on demand, this is now allowing me to go back in time to some other period.
2633.38s:  I just fake money. So I can enter an exit trade to see where it says these are simulated trades. You can essentially place trades in here and see how they do. Now this is back in time.
2644.38s:  So if you want to actually pay per trade today right now with something like think or swim, they have that ability. You essentially ticket when you're logging into the platform. And it's just a fake account.
2655.38s:  Now that's what TD, well, I guess not TD Ameritrade anymore Schwab. It's what Schwab offers. Other brokers will have paper trading available.
2663.38s:  I think one of the best things you could do to paper trade though is literally do it in a Google sheet or Excel.
2668.38s:  And the reason why that's really useful is because you maintain the data set. You keep the data. And that's a giant mistake. I made as a new trader when I was paper trading here and there.
2678.38s:  And I didn't do a great job at it. I would approach that very differently. If I were to do it again. But one of the main things is every time you reset the account, all the data is gone.
2690.38s:  And that's kind of just a waste of time and effort beyond what you can remember. So doing your best to paper trade upfront, track what you're doing so that you can revisit how things behaved is super, super useful.
2706.38s:  Alex says ES is correct. I jumped into options years ago and lost money without even realizing why and more importantly, I didn't know what questions to ask. For example, stock was up option goes down exactly. That's such a great point. And I'm glad that you shared that experience because we've literally all been there before where the underlying goes in your favor, but you're not making money and you don't know why it's a giant problem.
2728.38s:  And doing that with real money, it just doesn't help you out that much. Now I want to be really clear this concept of paper trading is really useful.
2739.38s:  However, paper trading will never fully replicate live trading. So you can't only paper trade, but I think it's great to paper trade upfront, get all those mistakes out of the way and then move on.
2753.38s:  Yes, still doesn't know why. Yeah, maybe sometimes the markets do really screwy things, but since you're being a child, I got to be, you know, the parent here, I'll put you back in time out for five minutes there, Craig.
2764.38s:  Let us know when you are ready to behave like a grown adult. If not, I mean, we can just kick you off. We'll give you a chance, though. We'll see. We'll see if you could pull it together there, buddy.
2776.38s:  So any other questions on the introduction to derivatives, kind of what calls are what puts are what the prospect of opening a position looks like another thing I didn't mention before that's worth mentioning in case it's not semi intuitive is the inverse of this.
2793.38s:  This is how you close the positions. So if we bought to open a position, the way you close that position is you sell to close.
2805.38s:  And if you sold to open the inverse to that position is by close just the inverse.
2814.38s:  Cool. So I think we're good here so far. This is just an options chain, which we talked a little bit about before.
2823.38s:  Paul says, how do you keep track of vol can you charge for that? Yeah, definitely. So there is volatility that exists in a lot of different states.
2831.38s:  So if we come, let's use like a normal ticker like spy and you can go into the options chain.
2840.38s:  First thing you can do is take a look at the volatility relative to all these different explorations. So when we think about volatility in trading, there are a few different levels that apply.
2858.38s:  So we can have the volatility for an individual expiration cycle. We can have the volatility for individual options. So in this case, if we come in here, that's what this column is I've a lot of stuff.
2872.38s:  So it's kind of difficult to see, but this percentage is implied volatility. Then if we go down to the underlying itself, it will also have volatility.
2886.38s:  So the way that you can track it is a few different methods. The easiest one is if you're broker has a tool to show you volatility.
2897.38s:  So you can essentially see how it behaves over time like this, or you can create plots like this. But this is at the equity level. This is at the stock level.
2907.38s:  This is what the volatility looks like. And there are different kinds of volatility, which we actually have a section on that in a little bit.
2914.38s:  But when we're talking about options more often than not, we're using implied volatility. But then there's also historic volatility.
2922.38s:  There's different kinds of realized volatility. There's future realized. There's realized that's historic. So there's bunches of volatility technically speaking, but from a beginner perspective, the important ones are implied.
2936.38s:  And historic forecast matters, which we'll touch on, but it doesn't matter as much in the short term timeframe.
2947.38s:  Polo says, what is the mathematical definition of volatility? Yeah. So the way to think about volatility in a nutshell, it literally is just variance. It's how much something moves.
2957.38s:  So if something is very volatile. So again, if we look at the volatility of spy, the implied volatility of it is 12.83% and you can see how much it moves. I have a couple different metrics for that.
2970.38s:  We'll use the 12 day average true range in this case. The 12 day ATR is 1%. You don't have to know exactly what all those details mean. Just know that spy, which the implied volatility is 12.83%.
2983.38s:  And then it's ATR is 1%. Then if we go to GameStop, its volatility is 253% and it's 12 day ATR is 25%. So what this is highlighting is the higher the implied volatility is for something.
3001.38s:  But the more it's expected to move, that's all that's why when we're talking about volatility and trading, we have forward looking volatility, which is implied and forecast.
3011.38s:  And then we have backwards looking volatility, which is historic. So historic volatility is literally just the stock price. How much it moves. You can track it in different time frames. That's what these white lines here are are historic volatility.
3026.38s:  So implied volatility is looking forward. Historic volatility is what happened in the past.
3036.38s:  Middle zone is okay, that's what I was missing and just let them expire. It was confusing me that when I tried to close them, it was wanting me to sell the calls. Yeah, exactly. So when you want to close in options position, you essentially have to inverse whatever you did to open it.
3052.38s:  Alex says, volatility math is dispersion of data around the mean or over a period of time, variance is the difference from the mean. Yeah, it's obviously even better than I can colloquially explain it. That's really good grab from investor, pdf.
3066.38s:  So and that's actually why you'll notice before when I was talking about volatility that you essentially can use variance in the same context, right.
3074.38s:  Volatility is dispersion around the mean variances, the difference from the mean that's also dispersion.
3080.38s:  Jay says, would it be accurate to say volatility is a measurement of sentiment. Yeah, definitely.
3085.38s:  Valtility primarily is a measurement of movement and you can use volatility then to infer what we expect the movement of something to be.
3096.38s:  So if we come in here, which is actually pretty cool, you can look at this tool and actually let me get something that's not squarely something that's normal will use spy.
3106.38s:  So notice this is called a probability cone and this essentially is taking the volatility for the underlying itself across the various explorations and it's giving you the probability in this case of a one standard deviation move plus or minus.
3123.38s:  You can change this. It can be two standard deviation moves. So this will capture 95.6 95.5% of data.
3131.38s:  And then you can even have three standard deviation moves, which captures 99.7% of data.
3138.38s:  So when we're talking about volatility in the context of options, it's quite literally just how much do we expect the underlying to move.
3148.38s:  And that then would impact the premium that we price into options.
3156.38s:  Jay says so it's kind of like standard deviation with time. Yeah, so you can annualize volatility that's typically what we would do.
3162.38s:  So when we're talking about volatility in this context down here, the implied volatility for the underlying itself, that's the annualized.
3170.38s:  Standard deviations of volatility of movement. And when you're looking at volatility, however, you can break it down into smaller time frames that doesn't have to be annualized.
3182.38s:  So in this case, you can see that the let's call it the 10 June expiration is 6.83% implied volatility.
3190.38s:  So this is relative to this time frame. That's one of the cool parts about options is you can use it to come up with inferences on where price movements might be based on how the market is pricing options.
3203.38s:  So that is a great.
3207.38s:  A great point.
3209.38s:  All right, let's get back to this.
3213.38s:  So let's take a look now at.
3217.38s:  Moneyness and the premium of an option. I want to break this down a little bit more.
3224.38s:  The reason why is because the premium of an option has kind of two big components.
3231.38s:  It has intrinsic and extrinsic value.
3235.38s:  And intrinsic reflects how far in the money it is.
3239.38s:  Extrinsic value represents how much time is left in the options, which includes a volatility input.
3247.38s:  The reason why it's important to understand the difference between these two is because of the way that they behave.
3254.38s:  So first, let's start with moneyness. And this is kind of one of those rules that you just have to accept.
3261.38s:  And then the name it'll be more natural.
3265.38s:  So we'll start with the call side of the equation. Notice kind of this shaded area.
3272.38s:  And then there's this black area.
3276.38s:  The shaded area represents in the money. The black area represents out of the money.
3281.38s:  That's on the call side.
3283.38s:  And then if you look at the put side, notice how it's essentially inverted their caddy quarter into one another.
3288.38s:  And then the shaded area represents in the money.
3292.38s:  Okay, so what does that actually mean? Is there any brave souls that want to take a guess at how you determine if an option is in the money or not based on what you see here.
3305.38s:  And I can even close back into this as a hint.
3309.38s:  I want you to look at where the underlying the last price was.
3314.38s:  The last price in spy was five thirty four.
3319.38s:  So what do you notice?
3327.38s:  Joe says price.
3329.38s:  There you go.
3332.38s:  That's exactly right.
3334.38s:  So what about price? How do we use price to infer if we are in the money or not?
3340.38s:  Well, no use says where the underlying is relative to the strike price. That's exactly right.
3348.38s:  And then Pat says price is higher exactly correct.
3351.38s:  Jay says in the money when the underlying is greater than the strike exactly correct. Nice job. Literally all you got it 100% correct. That's for the call side.
3359.38s:  So whenever you have an option that the strike price is less than the current price. That's in the money.
3366.38s:  That means it has intrinsic value.
3369.38s:  If it's out of the money, it means it has no intrinsic value.
3374.38s:  And this is all extrinsic value, which is composed of time and volatility.
3380.38s:  So as we add more time, the more extrinsic value we have.
3387.38s:  As we add more volatility or expected movement.
3391.38s:  Premiums will also go up for out of the money options and in the money options.
3398.38s:  So when we look at the put side, it's the inverse.
3402.38s:  So if your strike price is above the current price, you're in the money.
3407.38s:  And if your strike price is below, you're out of the money.
3410.38s:  So one of the cool parts is.
3413.38s:  And what Joe is doing there is actually a really common mistake that I want to highlight because it's really important to know.
3420.38s:  He says a long call strike lower than current.
3424.38s:  It's really, really important to break away from whether you're long or short.
3430.38s:  It doesn't matter.
3432.38s:  The call doesn't care if it was sold or if it was bought to open, the call doesn't care which way you want it to go.
3439.38s:  The way to think about it is purely in relation strike to underlying.
3445.38s:  Not whether it was bought, not whether it was sold.
3448.38s:  That's a really common error that new traders make and it becomes kind of confusing because then our brain start wanting to make it related too much to whether or not we bought or sold and what we want to happen.
3462.38s:  And that can be confusing.
3464.38s:  We'll stretch those as I mean, I'm not wrong.
3466.38s:  You're not at all.
3467.38s:  And yet that's completely okay.
3469.38s:  The point I'm highlighting though is that long doesn't matter.
3473.38s:  And that's a really confusing point for people when that gets included into the equation.
3478.38s:  But you're absolutely correct.
3480.38s:  The important part of that statement is call strike lower than current price.
3484.38s:  That's exactly correct.
3487.38s:  Oops, wrong one.
3489.38s:  Let's go back over here.
3493.38s:  Any questions on this part down here.
3497.38s:  Any questions on an option premium.
3503.38s:  And how that's broken down.
3505.38s:  Hey, Craig's back from time out.
3507.38s:  It's good to see you Craig says just pedantics and well, that's not the correct way to use that term, which is pedantic.
3513.38s:  But yeah, it's in that case.
3515.38s:  And as I said, it's exactly as Joe said, he's not wrong at all.
3519.38s:  But from my experience with people with options that if we start including the long or short aspect of mononus, it just unnecessarily can found things right because at the simplest form, it doesn't matter if the option was long short.
3537.38s:  Doesn't matter at all, it has everything to do with strike relative to underlying.
3543.38s:  So yeah.
3546.38s:  It's like we're good on premium.
3549.38s:  Now let's talk a little bit about the Greeks.
3552.38s:  And then I want to walk through some of your guys's specific questions that we can dive into.
3559.38s:  Craig says you explain things really well.
3561.38s:  Well done. Thank you very much.
3563.38s:  Yeah, I actually try to help people, which I know is kind of a different form than popping in a live on Friday, which is actually hilarious that your goal there was just to kind of try to troll.
3574.38s:  Yeah, I appreciate that compliment because I do try to help people.
3577.38s:  It's an important thing to me.
3579.38s:  I had a lot of help along my path.
3582.38s:  So I think finding people and working with people and trying to share that with others is actually super, super important.
3589.38s:  Jay says for extrinsic value, are you saying that volatility is part of the calculation for time value? Yeah.
3595.38s:  So volatility is part of the calculation for extrinsic value.
3600.38s:  So it's we want to make sure that we differentiate those two values from one another because you can discreetly isolate time value.
3610.38s:  It's quite literally just the duration until expiration.
3614.38s:  So if you look at something like the black sholes, Merton model, there is a way to discreetly derive the specific time value of a premium.
3626.38s:  And again, it's based on how far out in time we know that at all given points.
3631.38s:  Valtility in order to figure out what volatility is sophisticated traders and investors, typically market makers institutions, they have volatility forecasts.
3643.38s:  So this typically is done via a surface model that they maintain.
3647.38s:  They use different pricing rules. They use recent price data to then project what they think volatility is going to be going forward.
3656.38s:  Then price discovery occurs where different people essentially puts in put in their bids on what they think volatility is going to be, which eventually normalizes and stabilizes price.
3666.38s:  Then we would take implied volatility out of that. And that's how we can see what the volatility input is.
3673.38s:  Now it is entirely possible for a retail trader to maintain a forecast, but it's very likely not going to be better than what you're going to get from implied because essentially what the insinuation is there that we are able to more accurately predict volatility than the broad market consensus, which again, it can happen, but it's just not entirely likely.
3694.38s:  Let's see. So Joe says I appreciate your help. He got me to take action towards a gig I want today. Hey, that's actually great to hear we were talking about that yesterday. That is massively massively awesome for me to hear you have to tell me about that.
3715.38s:  A big a says he's used to explain it to crayon eaters. So he's build up an ability to break things down Barney style. Yeah, well, because for both of us, that's the only way that I can understand as well as Barney style. I need to broken down as simple as humanly possible.
3732.38s:  Craig says green is Eric's favorite. That's actually funny because I feel like Craig has been wrong nonstop and it's good to see it continue because red is actually my favorite color.
3742.38s:  I love me some red crayons. Those are the only ones I buy after the red crayons.
3749.38s:  Big A says sell in extrinsic and buy intrinsic says the book. I was caught up buying out of the money being cheap.
3758.38s:  I don't know if that's the exact way that I would break that down, but I think that that is fair to start with.
3767.38s:  The problem is yeah, I think that that's fair. I think that's okay. The problem is it starts to lose a little bit of nuance in kind of different positions like covered calls and stuff like that where you actually might want to sell intrinsic, which is slightly different style, but you can use that for like a dividend capture strategy.
3785.38s:  But yeah, I think in general that's a that's a completely fair place to start.
3790.38s:  Ian says do you use options and core allocation or speculative I use it across the entire portfolio.
3796.38s:  My trading portfolio is all options like my primary margin account is all options positions. Now I do have equity that comes in and out as part of my options strategies.
3808.38s:  But in general it's options positions and then I'll hold equities as part of a broader strategy that I'm running.
3819.38s:  Cool. So now we should be able to identify if an option is in the money or out of the money. And if we know if it's in the money or out of the money, we also know what the premium of that option includes.
3833.38s:  Now the reason why this matters so much is when we think about the impacts of various market forces on the premium of an option, you'll see how important this becomes and we actually get a first glimpse of that through the Greeks.
3849.38s:  Now for those that are interested, I have a video that goes super deep in depth on the Greeks.
3856.38s:  And for those that are curious, you can grab a screenshot from this, which essentially is just a reference guide for the various Greeks that we have.
3868.38s:  Craig says dividend capture strategies with someone that doesn't know what they're talking about what suggests selling ball is a bet on ball not trying to capture some made up dividend.
3879.38s:  Yeah, I mean, honestly, the more I hear you talk, the more I understand that you're one of those people that really think you know what you're talking about, but you actually don't it's fascinating because that's like the most unique psyche to come across.
3893.38s:  But dividend, I again didn't say that selling the call in a different capture strategy is predicated on ball or talking about extrinsic value.
3905.38s:  I feel like maybe you struggle to like maintain pace with like base conversation, so just general tip is to we have two, two ears and one mouth, I guess, two hands so that might be why you're typing so much, but use the proverbial mouth, right?
3919.38s:  So spend more time listening and trying to digest is compared to thinking about what you're going to say, because a lot of what you're saying is just nonsense, which is quite entertaining to me actually as I look at it, but.
3932.38s:  Great, great ad, I guess.
3935.38s:  So going back to the Greeks to get us back on track after a little bit of comedic relief, we can take a look at what the primary Greeks are, which actually consist of first order Greeks and one second order Greek.
3953.38s:  If you look at this graph, it actually shows that there's even more and there are more Greeks beyond this, but from a retail trading perspective, you can care about things like charm, Vanna, Volga, like those will come up, but the vast majority of cases, you really don't have to worry so much about this because the vast majority of what you'll derive the benefit from is delta theta, Vega, gamma and row.
3982.38s:  Notice how gamma is a second order Greek. So how can you tell if it's first order a second order? Well, let's take a look. So if we take a look at delta, it's the premium rate of change.
3995.38s:  Beta premium rate of change.
3999.38s:  Vega premium rate of change.
4002.38s:  So premium rate of change. What do you notice about all of these? What these four are measuring are how premium changes with respect to another variable.
4016.38s:  So delta measures premium rate of change per one point move in the underlying price.
4024.38s:  Beta gives us rate of change for the passage of time. Vega for movements in volatility and then row per movement in the risk free rate, which is kind of variable depending on the duration of the option that you're trading.
4042.38s:  However, when let me see we're looking at the Greeks, let me grab that video.
4052.38s:  Alex says you have a copy of page six. Yeah, I do. Let me grab that video for you.
4060.38s:  Here you go.
4063.38s:  So that video there goes super far in depth.
4071.38s:  Yep. And big Ace available in discord's Patreon. Yeah, definitely. So if you can also grab it there, but you can grab a screenshot for free.
4082.38s:  Craig says there's a shell. It's so fascinating to me to see somebody refer to that as chilling, but I mean, it's got to be interesting living.
4094.38s:  I know you says, yes, Craig, a free video is a shell. That's the problem with people like Greg man is again, you could tell the kind of just imagine where you're at in life where all you have to do on a Friday night is hop on a stream to try to troll somebody.
4108.38s:  It's one of the most miraculous things I've come across since I joined the internet is that there are people in such a low state of existence that that's their move.
4120.38s:  My favorite.
4123.38s:  Joe says he's literally giving it away. Yeah, that's exactly it.
4129.38s:  And then he says, you need to share the arts of trolling with Craig. Yeah, because I mean, honestly, Joe has a really hilarious way of trolling that's actually good.
4139.38s:  But Craig says, is it to shield 20 people about a subject that you don't know anything about again, the problem just so you know another fun fact Craig before we just kind of have to put you in time out again.
4150.38s:  Apparently, you're a child and you don't learn, but the cool part is is you lose validity when you speak and miss truths, right?
4158.38s:  So even if you think what I'm saying is inaccurate or wrong or you don't like how the way I phrase some of it to say that I don't know anything about a subject, but again, like it's I can show you objective truths that aren't up for debate whether or not you are I agree on how I phrased it.
4175.38s:  Better accurate, right? So the problem is is when you say things that you don't know anything about, but it's objectively wrong. You really lose credibility as a troll.
4185.38s:  So I think something that would be really useful to you is to kind of work on your skill set a little bit, but he says there's a lot of skills in this space.
4195.38s:  I don't blame anyone expecting that I expect it. Yeah, definitely. That's absolutely true. I cannot I cannot agree more.
4203.38s:  That's really reason why I started doing this stuff.
4206.38s:  All right. So now that we got our next.
4211.38s:  All right, I guess our last variance of just going back and forth.
4217.38s:  Let's go over what time we got 610. Yeah, let's pop over and we'll take a look at some of the specific questions that you guys have.
4226.38s:  And then if you have any questions on what we covered in here, then we can absolutely dive into them. But let me get this over out of the way.
4241.38s:  And.
4245.38s:  Let's take a look so we can get rid of this.
4250.38s:  All right, let me help you out Joe back in time out you go for five minutes. We'll see in a few homey.
4257.38s:  All right, so let's go over some of your specific questions.
4263.38s:  All right, the very first ones that I see.
4269.38s:  Move this down here.
4272.38s:  Are up here. Let me see.
4277.38s:  J says I'm reading the paper betting against the crowd. I was wondering if aggregate call order imbalance can be used as a contrarian signal to set up trades.
4284.38s:  I'm new. So I don't know if that's even a good. It's a completely great question. There's nothing wrong with that question at all.
4289.38s:  And so I think the easiest way to objectively answer that question, which I do not have the data set right now.
4296.38s:  But I can absolutely look at that. I have a massive data set that I query against for kind of different thesis like that.
4305.38s:  You can use order imbalances to speculate on where things may or may not go.
4311.38s:  And you can use it to attempt to front run trades. But I don't know what the efficacy is in a large data sample is what that boils down to.
4320.38s:  So I don't have a discreet answer for you because I don't know the objective answer to it.
4325.38s:  But I also would say that when you look at order imbalances, I think the idea of contrarian signals is interesting.
4333.38s:  So I have to take a look at that paper myself, which I'll actually pull it up so that we can.
4339.38s:  See what there. It's a book. I see.
4348.38s:  So it's essentially all about contrarian. Yeah. So I don't know the specific section that you're reading.
4355.38s:  So again, I wouldn't want to give you guys bomb scoop. But the general approach that I take to trading is less so of a contrarian.
4364.38s:  Contrarian nature. Contrarian trading, I think, sounds really, really appealing.
4369.38s:  And it's something that I think people like the sound of. It sounds really cool, right?
4375.38s:  It would be smarter than everybody and to catch a pivot point. But I tend to find it to be a lower efficacy system.
4383.38s:  So more often than not, I'm going to try to follow the trend as best as I can.
4388.38s:  So I think that using call order imbalance as a contrarian signal could be.
4395.38s:  SAUCE. But we'd have to take a look at it more closely. I don't have a discreet answer for you. It's a good question.
4400.38s:  That's one that actually has me interested.
4405.38s:  Let's take a look at some of the simple ones here. So this one says if you trade volatility and how you do it, I absolutely do trade volatility.
4414.38s:  So here I'm going to share a video with you guys that outlines kind of the primary approach that I take, which is attempting to trade variance risk premium.
4424.38s:  So risk premium in options is the tendency for implied volatility to remain higher and overstated relative to realized volatility. That's all.
4438.38s:  So if we go out super, super far, notice these yellow lines, which represent implied volatility and these white lines, which represent historic volatility.
4448.38s:  Notice how in general the yellow line trends above the white line. That means in general implied volatility is pricing in larger moves than we actually see.
4461.38s:  Now you'll notice every once in a while short term moves will absolutely exceed the implied volatility.
4469.38s:  So that's why we tend to have overstated implied volatility to a degree is because of the distribution of stock prices, which is not log normal.
4480.38s:  So one of the traits is in option pricing that we tend to see implied volatility priced more richly than the realized moves with otherwise necessitate a perfect system.
4492.38s:  Now there's a bunch of reasons why this exists, but it comes down to supply and demand. That's what leads to the ultimate pricing of options is there need to be people willing to transact at an agreeable price, both seller and buyer perspective.
4506.38s:  So when we're looking at trends in volatility, that's one of the easiest ways to trade it.
4516.38s:  Now the other ways that I like to trade volatility are through things like trading earnings. That's a great one.
4524.38s:  FOMC rate statements is another really effective. Now this is all from a short volatility perspective.
4531.38s:  The reason why my personal approach to trading volatility by itself more often than not is predicated from the short perspective is another trait of volatility is that it tends to be mean reverting.
4545.38s:  It also tends to cluster one of those two terms mean well mean reverting means that over time it goes back to some sort of long term average to a reference period.
4557.38s:  Clustering means that it tends to hover around where it's recently been until it goes through a transitory phase at which it will then cluster again.
4570.38s:  Craig says sounds like all of you and strategies. I mean they're just really basic volatility strategies, but yeah absolutely.
4578.38s:  I think one of the best things that you and talks about is like the risk reversal his structure to a risk reversal is fantastic and the way that he employs the delta bands that's I think fantastic.
4590.38s:  The risk reversal I think from a retail perspective is really difficult to put on in a cost efficient way, but yeah I mean the way to think about at least most of my trading is it's exceedingly basic that's by design.
4603.38s:  So if I think about my strategies, they're really designed to be less intensive and something that I can reliably execute over time and it's why I've spent so much time kind of studying because I do agree with I think it was Leonardo da Vinci that said simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication and I think again going to another analogy in the Marine Corps.
4628.38s:  We talk about brilliance at the basics. So if you can set things up simply that take advantage or that do what you want as simple as possible, there's less margin for error and I very, very rarely will trade kind of you know multi leg dragon spreads, which is a joke that might be a name for something who knows at this point there are tons of weird names like Jade lizards and names that pop up.
4652.38s:  But I avoid tons of legs because more often than not they don't actually help and by taking the simplest form of a position you gain exposure to the actual thing you're trying to trade.
4663.38s:  And also I think retail traders don't fully appreciate.
4669.38s:  I don't think they fully appreciate how much friction is involved with trading.
4676.38s:  Paul says what are the white pink and yellow curves the white you mean in here so this is essentially a plot of oh yeah, Shredger thank you very much that's exactly correct.
4691.38s:  Much appreciated.
4693.38s:  Rex says how do you find the time to record so many videos and study well as you can tell I have a smaller YouTube channel so I don't actually spend a bunch of time doing things with the videos right so my goal with the videos I think about a topic typically something related to what I'm working on in some capacity and then I literally just shoot a video on it and then that's that's it.
4715.38s:  So if I think about where I'm at in my trading career I've spent thousands of hours studying and I still I literally read every single day about this stuff it's what I do it's it's my profession is a trader.
4730.38s:  So that is the overwhelming majority of what I spend my time looking at and for me like video production is pretty off like hands off there's not that much to it's actually why I'm so appreciative for the people that do sign up on patreon is because I'm not going to do that.
4745.38s:  Because I'm now able to edit videos and I use the proceeds from that essentially to try to make better content so yeah.
4755.38s:  Polic says what is VRP variance risk premium so VRP or risk premium there's different kinds of risk premium variance risk premium specifically relates to this phenomenon that I was just telling you about where implied volatility trends over historic volatility.
4774.38s:  Good question.
4779.38s:  Cool.
4781.38s:  Greg says only reason I've been kicked out because of 3% of your audience it does not show that you read into it.
4787.38s:  But it's because I don't care right if you were actually bothering me I have I take you out in a heartbeat I don't really care but I also think it's important to at least try to show people like you love because it's very clear that you don't get it in your life if this is how you behave and again if this is your agenda for Friday night.
4809.38s:  So we try to be nice to people like you against your best wishes.
4814.38s:  Polic says you have IVs for different periods how you use this is another great question.
4818.38s:  So depending on how you're structuring trades you can look at implied volatility in different perspectives when you think about implied volatility as compared to a theoretical model like the black shul's martin model.
4836.38s:  Volatility is not uniform there's actually what we call a volatility surface and it's a three dimensional view of volatility because as you go across different expressions at different strike prices they all will have different
4850.38s:  volatility so you can trade these different relationships between volatility.
4855.38s:  It's actually really really cool when you get a deeper relationship with volatility because it's one of the more tradable asset classes and it's because it has more predictive qualities than price can have again depending on the time frame that you're looking at.
4874.38s:  So that's essentially how you can use the various IVs looks like we got time out Craig again there we go we're going to have to expand your time out this time little buddy off you go.
4890.38s:  So that's essentially how I use it it allows me to trade the relationship of different volatility's.
4898.38s:  That's the punch line.
4901.38s:  So those that's kind of like in a nutshell of the way that I trade volatility now a couple notes is trading volatility is kind of tricky because it's very path dependent and if you really want to gain direct exposure the volatility you have to do things like gamma hedge which is time intensive.
4921.38s:  Or you can kind of have a looser relationship with volatility trade the overall themes which is more so what I do and that's kind of my general approach to it I also trade volatility on zero DTEs that's the primary source of profitability for that trade and that still exists to a pretty significant degree.
4941.38s:  So going over actually is a great segue to know you how to trade options around events such as earnings or economic data releases.
4948.38s:  Great question so actually that video that I just dropped in will talk about that more in depth but let's take a look at some examples if we look at something like Tesla.
4958.38s:  And we take a look at how it behaves around earnings this might be a slightly overwhelming chart but if you take a look you'll notice up here we have the underlying price pre and post earnings then we have the implied versus historic volatility pre and post release.
4981.38s:  So essentially there are a couple really common traits with respect to option prices around earnings starting about two weeks out there will be an expansion in volatility although it can be masked by underlying price movements other market factors it's not as simple as two weeks out follows up but that is the general trade starting two weeks out into an earnings release.
5008.38s:  So you can trade that volatility expansion via something like a long straddle is completely reasonable then as you get closer to the release there tends to be a rapid contraction of volatility post release.
5023.38s:  So to capture the contraction post release we would sell volatility via short straddles sort strangles before the release and then we would look to close it after the release after the volatility contracts and this is a great example of that movement.
5037.38s:  So if we look at imply volatility before the release in this case it is 72.55% and then after the release it drops to 66.43% so in this example selling volatility would make money.
5053.38s:  There are examples however where selling volatility doesn't make money and the movement post earnings is bigger than the implied move this is an example of that so notice how before this earnings release implied volatility was 62.91% and historical volatility here was 58% leading into the release and then post release they literally flip and historical volatility jumps up to 57.77%
5081.38s:  then the market is coming up to 53% this is where short volatility strategies with lose money it's not free money you're taking a risk but in general you'll notice that in most of these instances implied volatility trends over historical volatility through the earnings release.
5101.38s:  So the punchline is if you're trading earnings releases and trying to trade volatility around it it's very very much predicated on it being a numbers game you have to get enough cycles in because you'll have instances where you lose like this right here you would have lost as well.
5115.38s:  So we can take a look at this in different time frames to see essentially how it behaved leading directly into the release and post release.
5134.38s:  Paul says are those candles daily yep that's what the previous one was and then this would be intraday post the release.
5143.38s:  That's kind of the nutshell about trading earnings with volatility plays you can trade things thinking about the difference between straddles and strangles strangles are less of a pure volatility play and they are more of a they have a directional component to it because the thing is if we take a look let's use on demand let's take a look at one of these examples.
5171.38s:  Let's look at first.
5176.38s:  The last earnings release would have been a good example of a losing position and then the one before that would have been a slight win the one before that a better win so go back to last earnings and then two earnings ago I just have to grab the dates.
5191.38s:  So the last earnings was 23 April after the close I'm just going to throw it in the chat so I can find it 23 April PM.
5200.38s:  And then over here this would have been a losing position this one is well.
5207.38s:  Let's take a look this one was 18.
5215.38s:  I think in paper trading you can start with the absolute basics long calls long puts short calls short puts those are all very very
5244.38s:  reasonable initial strategies actually just shot a new video on like introduction to options because the other one I have is is kind of old but it's not out yet so I can give you the old one that I have here and that goes through a lot of the basic structures that you can trade now for me personally the things I would look at would be the coverage
5272.38s:  of the trade triangle which is very similar to what you would hear as the wheel and some slight nuances and then the others would be ratio diagonals I think those are probably the primary strategies that I would trade and they're mostly directional in nature trading volatility is completely doable but especially if you're trading a smaller account there's a lot of nuance to it that becomes difficult to manage.
5298.38s:  So what that means is in order to trade volatility from a pure perspective you don't want to trade it via iron condors or via defined risk strategies because then you're buying the exact thing you're saying is overpriced that's why we would be selling volatility so you start to sacrifice a lot of your edge perspective there because of that.
5319.38s:  So I think that's essentially where I would start now the other thing that I think would make sense if you're even interested in something simpler still you can literally do something like ratio covered calls I would try those as well and we can talk about a couple of those in just a second.
5344.38s:  I just realized we're ready at 630 so I'm going to skip going through the rest of the earnings thing it's in that video mostly that I shared up above and then I want to make sure we get to this last question so Scott says can you cover your analysis for entry and then sizing strike liquidity and scaling for option scalping opportunities I was curious is your approach for I for scalping utilizing optimize premium pricing for launch positions so unfortunately and I kind of put this in the middle of the market.
5374.38s:  I don't really scalp options that much the reason being is again options are really nefarious in that even if you have no upfront commissions they're extremely misleading because you can think it's way cheaper than it actually is and it kind of starts to eat away at your profits massively.
5394.38s:  So even when I'm trading zero DTE options I'm not considering that scalping because I'm establishing a position looking to manage it Delta hedging slightly but I carry the position all the way through I think if I were to look to scalp options liquidity would be probably the hands down most important factor because without effective liquidity you have your giving up any potential as you have the friction.
5421.38s:  So when it comes to strike prices that kind of goes into this bigger question on selecting a strike which is completely relative to the strategy that you're trading so sizing for scalping would have to be relative to the way that I'm expecting the price to move because you have to be positively expectant so if we come into something like Tesla.
5448.38s:  And you're trying to trade this thing intraday and let's say you're using options well your options are decaying as you're holding them let's say that you're buying those options you need the price movement to be big enough to cover the cost of slippage which is the bit ask spread you need to cover your theta decay depending on if it's just today it may not be too much but you still have to cover that cost and you also need to overwhelm commissions so the minimum movements required have to account for all of those fees.
5476.38s:  Then if you have losing positions let's say that you're trying to go for a you know plus one win and a minus two loss well now you're winning position wouldn't make sense right depending on the probability because you need to be able to overwhelm the losing positions so it's very much a math in a game of math and you just have to use something like expected returns which I have a video on I'll grab that for you.
5507.38s:  So this video goes up or goes through expected returns and essentially how to think about them.
5521.38s:  The the point being is you can't just essentially try to scalp on the system of if I'm up I'm going to get out if I'm down I'm going to get out or if I'm up by a percent I'm going to get out because you have to make sure that it makes sense against your fees and whatever your loss management protocols are so it's a bit of a vague answer because it's not something that I typically do but again I think the heart and soul of that response is focusing very much so unexpected for sure.
5546.38s:  All right that about wraps us up so if you have any other questions that you want to dive into let me know in the meantime I do want to talk about this one just a little bit this idea of buying calls that expire worthless because this happens literally all of the time so when we look at.
5563.38s:  What retail traders tend to do is they want to be cheap because they tend to have smaller accounts so if we take a look at options in something like Tesla if we're closer in time let's use like a week out and we look at something like a 30 delta which is here.
5593.38s:  They these calls are trading for you know 233 if we go further out in time to 70 days expiration again to a 30 delta these are trading for seven 47 something like that.
5609.38s:  So the point is the further out in time you go the more time your contract has to work in your favor but the more expensive it is so traders tend to really run on the short term of the spectrum which is problem out.
5623.38s:  So the more you go the more expensive it is so you can go to the market for a bunch of different reasons the answer however on how to think about overcoming this is by going further out in time and by going deeper in the money you don't have to go super deep in the money you can go essentially right at the money or slightly in the money.
5643.38s:  So there's a much better probability of the underlying.
5647.38s:  Moving in your required direction and actually increasing the overall profitability in the position because your gamma would ramp pretty quick but there's a higher outlay upfront.
5661.38s:  So why not says better to scalp with shares I think that's fair I think the only downside to that is you lose the leverage but if you wanted to scalp I think with shares is probably a better approach I agree with you.
5671.38s:  Rudy says if I check on Robinhood and click on options it gives me a break even amount does that mean that all of those that all of those got covered all those extra costs that you're talking about.
5682.38s:  I don't know if Robinhood includes fees but what that is talking about in terms of the break even price is for different basic structures you can calculate where the break even price is at expiration which is another really commonly misunderstood concept so for example if we go out here to 16 August and we look at buying one of these at the money calls just for an example and we analyze this trade.
5709.38s:  Get rid of this.
5712.38s:  So notice how there's two lines in this risk profile the x axis here represents the strike price and the underlying prices right now in the center so the x axis here I'm sorry I said strike price I didn't mean that the underlying or the x axis here represents the underlying price.
5730.38s:  And you can look at different strike prices further out in time but the center point right here is the current price and then the y axis is a PNL graph as you go up makes money go down lose money so you'll notice there's these two different lines there's purple and then there's blue purple represents today right now blue represents at expiration so notice on this 180 call your break even price will be the strike price plus
5759.38s:  the debit you paid to open the position and you can see that represented right here it's at 195 and change 195 90 so that's where the break even prices at expiration so a lot of people confuse that and they think that in order to make money on this trade you have the underlying has to be above that you actually start making money way earlier notice how this purple line shows us making money as soon as it moves in our
5789.34s:  favor remember the break even prices that we typically refer to when we're looking at structures is relative to expiration but you can make money before expiration and that reminds me we didn't talk about settlement which is really really important I want to highlight that quickly there are different ways you can close in options contract the most
5812.10s:  efficacious in general is simply trading the contract so if you buy a call it would be to sell the call if you sell a put it would be to buy the put back you can also exercise options if you're a buyer but there are a lot of caveats to that because you give up all the
5831.46s:  extrinsic value left in the option that you're holding that you otherwise could capture by selling the option or trading the option so that's kind of just a
5842.78s:  really short fused ad I didn't want to forget that because I realized I forgot to add that earlier and I don't want to
5848.98s:  I don't want you guys to not at least have a rudimentary understanding of settlement which reminds me I need to add a placeholder for that little presentation that I give on settlement.
5861.86s:  And we'll add that here.
5865.10s:  But yeah, just definitely take note that we want options settlement we typically want to trade the options that's going to be a simpler way to manage the transaction that is lower friction for you.
5883.50s:  And the other thing I'm actually surprised nobody asked maybe you guys already know but is the multiplier so you'll notice that when we're looking at these different contracts that we're quoting this as you know $15 and 70 cents.
5901.86s:  But you notice here says 100 that's because the multiplier for options contracts we would call a one lot per one lot is 100 shares so each one of these contracts represents up to 100 shares of the underlying so when we're looking at the prices you'll see that this is quoted as 15 dollars and 80 cents the midpoint.
5928.42s:  However, you have to multiply that by 100 to get the actual price because this is per share these moving 100 share lots an important admin know on the prices that you see here.
5944.78s:  Alex says just to make sure I understood your short vol on zero DTE and delta hedge and cash secure the difference.
5952.74s:  I don't follow your question on the cash securing the difference the way that I delta hedge because typically when I'm trading zero DTE options I am trading the prevalence of variance risk premium and the way that I delta hedge is by moving the options.
5970.98s:  You can delta hedge more purely via gamma scalping however once you neutralize your gamma then you have to neutralize your delta's and the easiest way to do that is through the underlying market but spx is typically what I trade zero DTE's in it's index itself it doesn't trade in any shares so if you grab spx notice how there's there's no size there's no volume so you would have to delta hedge with spy which is kind of a dirty hedge we would call it's not.
6000.98s:  A pure hedge so the vast majority of the time when it comes to zero DTE's and something like spx i'm going to size the position very carefully but the way that I delta hedges by rebalancing my delta's on the long around the short call and short put side so slightly different the there's no real cash secure on the position it's just a margin required product because the way that spx options are settled is via cash.
6028.70s:  There are two different kinds of standard options contracts there's American and European.
6035.38s:  For American options they can be settled or they can be exercised at any point and European options can only be exercised at expiration but then we can also have if something is cash settled or settled with the underlying so spx is an example of a European style option where it can only be exercised at expiration.
6057.54s:  And it's cash settled there's no shares that move so if for example I sell an option and it's in the money and it's exercised it just settles to cash there's no underlying that moves around.
6069.90s:  Good question though.
6071.54s:  All right gang i got us a hot minute into this thing but I hope the session was good for you guys if it is please like the video it does help the content emerged through the algorithm and i'm looking to do kind of two of these beginner oriented sessions on Fridays.
6090.82s:  per month so the first and third Friday is what i'm tracking right now so i'll look forward to connecting with you guys at the next one and in the meantime if you have questions or anything like that feel free to reach out at any point.
6103.02s:  I aim to try to help people as best I can so.
6106.22s:  Have an awesome weekend and i'll see you guys later.
