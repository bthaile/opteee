0.00s: What's up everyone? Welcome back to
2.86s: OutLayer's Happy Friday. We had a
5.22s: really interesting day,
6.90s: specifically from GME, if we're
8.98s: being completely honest, but well,
10.98s: we got feedback. Luke got to kill
13.02s: that. But so we have a different
16.42s: session in line for today.
18.54s: This is specifically a options
20.82s: trading workshop geared towards
23.42s: beginners. So we have a few things
25.62s: we're going to talk about. I have
27.22s: a couple topics that I've selected
29.26s: from conversations that I've seen
31.26s: that I actually want to work
33.26s: through with you. So you can
35.26s: chat in specific elements or
37.26s: questions about these topics that
39.26s: you have or concepts that you
41.26s: want to explore more deeply. And
43.26s: we can do that. And then I also
45.26s: have some questions that folks
47.26s: dropped on the YouTube post that
49.26s: I made about the event. So we'll
51.26s: hit those, but feel free to chat
53.26s: in at any point if there's
55.26s: something I'm talking about that
57.26s: you want to dive into. If there's
59.26s: an unrelated topic that you have
61.26s: in the back of your mind that you've
63.26s: been wanting to understand or
65.26s: explore, that is all fair game.
67.26s: My entire goal for you walking
69.26s: away from this, especially from
71.26s: a beginner's perspective is I
73.26s: would love if there are maybe
75.26s: three takeaways that you definitively
77.26s: can point at at the end of the
79.26s: session. So that's what I'm aiming
81.26s: to give you. The other thing is
83.26s: based on where we go during the
85.26s: session at the end of the session, I'll
87.26s: give you some follow up stuff to take a
89.26s: look at and that I think might be a
91.26s: reasonable progression for you.
93.26s: Now in order to help me if you can
95.26s: in the chat just throw in what your
97.26s: options trading experience is,
99.26s: meaning how long you've been trading
101.26s: options and what your general style
103.26s: is, that will be super, super helpful
105.26s: for me as I move through the rest of
107.26s: the session to kind of paint what I'm
109.26s: talking about in light of your
113.26s: individual experience.
115.26s: All right. So to kick us off,
117.26s: let's start with talking a little
121.26s: bit about the traps of trading
123.26s: options. The reason why I want to start
125.26s: with this is because it is really,
127.26s: really important to understand the
129.26s: landscape that we're interacting
131.26s: with. So there's a few things I want
135.26s: to highlight here. The main thing is
139.26s: fully comprehending how important
141.26s: it is, what system can look like
145.26s: in the long run. So we'll get into
147.26s: that in just a second. So no use
149.26s: says no experience. Okay.
151.26s: And then some notice says actual
153.26s: experience or what we told our
155.26s: brokers to get ungated. That's a great
157.26s: question. But we'll probably go
159.26s: actual experience. The brokers we
161.26s: all know, you know, you might not
163.26s: give them the straight up truth.
165.26s: But you do what you got to do in
167.26s: here. Let's keep it a buck.
169.26s: So that I can kind of tailor what
171.26s: we're talking about for you.
173.26s: J Kim has no experience either
175.26s: Metal Zone. I bought calls once
177.26s: expired worthless. That sounds
179.26s: exactly about right. Actually,
181.26s: we can talk about that exact thing.
183.26s: I will grab that and throw it
185.26s: into our agenda.
187.26s: Specifically, we'll talk about how
189.26s: to buy calls without them
191.26s: expiring worthless. I think
193.26s: that would be really useful.
195.26s: All right, throw this in here.
197.26s: One of our other questions to hit
199.26s: in a little bit. We've all been
201.26s: there, by the way. The fact that they
203.26s: expire worthless.
205.26s: Cool.
207.26s: And then.
209.26s: Oh, that's a tough.
211.26s: That's a tough name. Looks like
213.26s: Patricia. That's actually my mom's
215.26s: name. But the the why and the J.
217.26s: I'm going to say that I'm going to
219.26s: get a little bit of a little bit of
221.26s: a little bit of a little bit of a
223.26s: little bit of a small margin of
225.26s: its.
245.26s: But that's the reason that.
247.26s: That I hear that say,
249.26s: I'm going to log in on in the
251.26s: to kind of these other things.
252.74s: Cause I think if you guys have no experience,
255.10s: the process of selecting a strike
257.20s: or selecting an expiration that might be actually
260.06s: a little too deep and a little too confusing,
263.46s: which I do not want.
265.30s: So what I'm going to do is grab a different presentation
269.38s: really quick.
270.54s: And we will flip through this super fast.
274.86s: And then I think that'll get us in the right spot.
280.38s: Okay.
281.38s: So let's talk about options.
285.98s: What they are, how they fit into our portfolio.
289.18s: I'll skip through all this.
290.18s: None of this stuff matters.
291.26s: Although fun fact, I was stabbed in the hand
294.06s: in high school, which is kind of cool.
295.62s: And then this is the dude that got me into trading
297.62s: back in high school right there.
299.46s: But all that stuff aside,
300.78s: that's what I do.
301.58s: None of that matters to you.
303.42s: This, I guess we can start here.
305.70s: So here's the deal with trading.
308.34s: In general, it's completely misunderstood by most people
311.46s: because we think it's access to fast easy money.
314.78s: And it's not.
315.62s: It genuinely is not.
316.90s: Now, the cool part is because it is not
320.22s: that is where the opportunity lies.
323.26s: Imagine if we had a system that was just
326.26s: access to fast easy money, who wouldn't do that, right?
329.74s: AKA that would price the system out.
332.26s: It wouldn't exist anymore.
334.30s: So the fact that it's not like that is a massive opportunity.
339.18s: I've made a lot of money trading options
342.18s: from my start in 2007, millions of dollars, literally.
345.82s: However, that should not be misconstrued to me.
350.18s: And it's easy because it genuinely is not.
353.86s: So the important part here, in my opinion,
356.66s: is to understand what we're trying to do
358.94s: so that we can be more successful at doing it.
361.86s: Because if you come into this under the guise that this is easy money,
365.94s: you're probably going to apply the correct methodology
368.78s: for something that would be easy, meaning we're not putting
370.98s: a ton of effort.
371.78s: We're not actually trying that hard, because we think it's easy.
374.54s: And then it doesn't work.
375.50s: We don't want that.
376.78s: So all of this is to say, trading is difficult.
380.38s: But in my opinion, if you take it seriously,
383.74s: it is entirely worth the time and effort.
386.34s: That's what it boils down to here.
388.50s: All right.
389.94s: When we're trading, it's super important to be organized.
392.78s: That's all this means.
393.78s: There are a couple of resources here to give you some ideas.
396.06s: You can take a screenshot of this and to get an idea
399.22s: of what these documents are, how we integrate them.
402.06s: All of this boils down to here that just like in high school,
406.42s: in college, whatever your education is,
408.34s: at some point you would have been handed a syllabus.
411.02s: That syllabus outlines what you're doing,
413.30s: what how you grade and assess your proficiency,
416.58s: those kinds of details are captured in there.
418.98s: That's what this series of documents
421.34s: are designed to do to provide that kind of structure for you.
424.10s: That's all.
425.22s: Okay. Now, let's talk about where kind of derivatives fit
428.42s: into this landscape and how they behave.
430.30s: So we have this broad bucket of things called securities.
433.14s: These are just tradable elements of the markets.
435.42s: They're broken down into a few different sub-buckets.
437.94s: We have equities, derivatives and debt.
440.06s: Debt is kind of something most of you might be familiar with,
443.66s: but it's access to things like bonds, notes, products
446.78s: that have a completely different structure
449.18s: than kind of the other two products we're going to talk about.
451.86s: But you should know that this bucket exists.
454.30s: Then we have equities, which you all probably are familiar with.
458.62s: Those are things like stocks, ETFs, exchange traded funds,
463.50s: those kinds of products.
464.94s: And then we have derivatives.
466.46s: Derivatives are really, really interesting
469.18s: because as you'll find out in a second,
471.22s: these are products whose value actually derives
475.14s: from other things.
477.02s: So things like equities and things like debt.
479.54s: So these are contracts that pertain to other things,
483.42s: which I'll explain more in a few moments.
486.26s: In derivatives, we have a couple big buckets
489.10s: like options futures.
490.30s: There's way more than options and futures.
493.62s: But for most people, this is a great starting point
496.98s: and there's no need to add a ton of unnecessary noise
499.94s: in the beginning.
500.78s: Just know that there's more to all of these buckets
503.22s: than what I have listed here.
505.14s: These are just a couple examples.
507.82s: OK, so what I want to talk about quickly
510.78s: is why options are interesting to trade.
513.78s: And then I'm going to get into kind of what they are
516.18s: in a nutshell.
517.58s: So options inherently add complexity to whatever we're doing.
521.78s: If you are buying or selling stock,
524.14s: it's actually quite straightforward.
527.10s: So if we take a look at something like spy,
532.18s: and you buy shares of stock,
534.78s: you just buy shares of spy.
536.50s: A couple of things can happen.
537.70s: It can go up or it can go down pretty much it.
542.10s: And the way you make money or lose money
544.18s: is depending on if it goes up or if it goes down.
547.22s: Again, pretty simple.
548.94s: If you introduce options to this equation,
552.10s: there are other profit factors that now matter quite a lot.
556.70s: And let me grab this back so I can show you some of them.
560.90s: So we still care about direction a lot
563.90s: as options traders.
565.10s: It's kind of the most important thing
566.66s: that we have available to us.
568.30s: But there are these other inputs that impact our positions,
572.78s: things like volatility, how much something moves,
575.58s: that impacts the pricing of options.
578.62s: The time frame, things that have longer duration contracts,
583.18s: typically more expensive than shorter duration contracts,
586.42s: as time passes the value of the contract slowly decays.
591.90s: Interest rates can even impact options.
594.86s: This is less important upfront for you guys,
597.62s: just being completely transparent,
599.02s: but you should know it exists.
600.58s: And we'll talk more about this a little bit later.
603.18s: So if we're talking about trading options,
605.74s: and I say that I like trading options,
607.26s: but I just gave you a bunch of issues
609.70s: that options, prospectively add to our trading process
615.02s: than why?
615.62s: Why would we do this?
616.94s: Well, it's for a few specific payoff reasons.
621.10s: They are leveraged products, which means you control
624.66s: more money with a little bit amount of money.
627.34s: They have completely customizable risk
631.86s: and reward payoff structures.
634.66s: That hands down is what makes options what they are.
639.46s: It's why we call them strategic investments.
642.78s: So what does that mean?
643.78s: Well, if we pop over here, let's say
646.02s: that you bought shares of Spy.
647.54s: If Spy goes up by $1, you make $1 on your share.
652.90s: There are a completely different set of rules
656.46s: that apply to options.
658.14s: And on that $1 movement, you can make more than $1.
662.54s: You can also make movement, even you can also make money
665.98s: if it makes a movement that's slightly
667.70s: against your position, but not too heavily.
670.34s: You can also trade markets that are going up like this,
673.54s: that are going down like this,
674.94s: that are going sideways like this.
676.86s: It also gives you the ability to trade
678.98s: a completely different asset class called volatility,
682.54s: which we'll touch on that a little bit later.
684.46s: This gets very, very deep pretty quickly.
687.78s: So we'll talk about some elements of this,
690.78s: however, just know that there's literally
693.26s: an entire different asset class that you have direct exposure to
696.82s: when you trade options.
698.46s: So I keep clicking the wrong thing coming back to this.
701.82s: So that in a nutshell is why options become
706.82s: really fascinating products to trade,
709.78s: because they give you the ability
711.50s: to completely customize what you're trying to do.
713.66s: If you want to decrease risk, you can use options for that.
717.14s: If you want to increase leverage, options can do that.
720.58s: If you want to trade for income options can do that.
723.78s: But again, it adds complexity.
726.06s: So it's really important to know that there is a give
729.78s: and take relationship to using these products
732.50s: that require some level of understanding,
734.74s: which hopefully will achieve by the end of this video.
738.46s: So I'll take a pause there up front,
740.90s: and I want to ask you guys if there's any questions
743.46s: on what we've covered so far.
745.34s: The other thing I would love to ask you here
746.94s: is if there's any preconceived notions
749.50s: that you have about options.
750.54s: So when you think about options, what comes to mind?
753.82s: Do you think that they're super risky?
756.30s: Do you think that you shouldn't trade them at all?
758.46s: Do you think that you need a ton of money
760.10s: to trade them, those kinds of things?
762.18s: And as you guys are kind of sharing some of that with me here,
766.38s: we will move on to the next slide.
768.42s: I'm going to leave this up for a second
770.14s: without even talking just yet.
772.10s: And we'll dive into it a bit more.
774.74s: We'll stretch us as stocks on steroids.
777.14s: They could be, I get your point there,
779.78s: and I know that you're familiar with options to a degree.
783.42s: But I think the thing with options
786.22s: is that they can be stocks on steroids
788.34s: or they could be stocks, not on steroids.
791.30s: I think that's actually fair inversion.
793.38s: They literally can decrease your risk,
796.38s: which is important to understand with derivatives.
801.54s: Metal Zone says like straddles will limit your downside.
804.66s: They can, that's a great point.
806.54s: So trading things like, yeah, that's a joke.
809.66s: That's perfect.
810.50s: It could be stocks on steroids or stocks on wheat.
812.38s: That's, there we go.
814.74s: Back to Metal Zone straddles, depending on if you buy or sell them.
819.26s: So I think it's important to understand
822.54s: how the buy-sell relationship works
825.18s: and what that results in in terms of a risk profile,
829.22s: which we'll talk about.
831.14s: Rudy says losing thousands and thousands of dollars
834.66s: on one contract, is there such a thing
836.66s: like that that can happen?
837.70s: Absolutely, there is.
838.70s: There absolutely is.
839.82s: Now, is it easy to avoid?
841.74s: Absolutely.
842.58s: There's no reason for that to happen.
844.46s: It's kind of like the idea of,
847.74s: if you are trying to think of a good analogy.
850.90s: If there's two buildings and your job is to walk across
854.46s: the two buildings and you have a few choices,
857.02s: you can either take the tight rope or you can take the bridge.
860.94s: They have different profiles about them.
864.06s: And let's say at the end, at the other side of the bridge
867.22s: is there's different payoffs.
869.02s: So the one that has the tight rope,
870.78s: let's say there's a bunch of money there
872.26s: and the one with the bridge, there's less money there.
874.66s: That's essentially options trading.
876.14s: You can take the tight rope,
877.58s: the lower probability that you're going to make it,
879.46s: higher probability that you are going to fall
881.50s: and plummet to your death and not see that money.
884.54s: But if you do make it, there's a ton of money
886.46s: on the other side.
887.38s: Or you can take the much more sure bet
890.54s: and walk across the bridge.
892.22s: There's going to be less money there,
893.50s: but it's still there for you to grab.
895.74s: So I think that that is an important way
898.86s: to kind of think about the risk profiles
900.90s: available to you guys.
902.94s: Jay says, I've definitely thought that you need a decent bit
908.42s: of starting capital to trade options,
910.34s: also a little scary about the leverage.
912.66s: Yeah, so that's another great point.
914.94s: And there's kind of a two-sided answer to this.
919.54s: The first side is yes, you don't actually need
925.74s: a bunch of money to start,
927.74s: but if I were to give like a genuine answer
930.98s: on reasonable starting capital,
933.30s: the more money you have,
934.90s: the better off you are provided
937.70s: that you have good risk controls.
939.06s: So what I mean by that is this,
941.14s: if you have a ton of money
943.54s: and you're a terrible trader with terrible risk controls,
946.46s: then there's a probability that you lose all of your money.
950.42s: Right?
951.26s: So that would be a bad scenario
952.42s: where more money actually is a bigger risk
955.10s: because you're not disciplined and you lose the money.
957.98s: However, trading a small amount of money is very difficult
962.22s: because as soon as you put on any single position,
964.86s: you tend to be oversized in terms of waiting
967.30s: within your portfolio,
968.78s: you can't accept as much natural movement
972.54s: in the underlying volatility
974.90s: and you essentially have really low margin for error.
979.18s: The other thing is you really can't trade optimize strategies.
983.42s: You're forced into trading things like vertical spreads
986.26s: and we'll talk about those a little bit later.
988.34s: Vertical spreads aren't the worst thing on planet earth
990.94s: and there are people that can trade them successfully.
993.54s: That I think is really important to note
995.34s: because my opinion of them is one thing
998.46s: and my experience with them is one thing,
1000.98s: but you should know that everything that I'm talking about
1003.26s: is literally just from my personal experience.
1005.50s: There's a lot of ways to do this thing.
1007.74s: So as you hear what I'm talking about,
1009.70s: I'm gonna do my best to offer some different offshoots.
1014.62s: So let's see.
1019.54s: Metal Zones says I've always been interested
1022.22s: in using them to trade sideways markets.
1025.26s: Yeah, you can absolutely use straddles
1027.46s: and strangles for that.
1029.30s: Craig says this man loves to talk about options
1031.02s: without understanding volatility.
1033.22s: Potentially, I think I understand volatility pretty well,
1035.70s: but maybe not.
1038.10s: Joe says I've lost thousands of dollars on options
1040.78s: that actually has happened to all of us.
1044.50s: All of this says far too many options
1046.58s: are glorified lottery tickets,
1047.74s: which is actually one of the things we'll talk about
1049.30s: in a little bit because you're absolutely right.
1050.82s: A lot of people look to trade the cheapest option possible
1055.30s: and that's a giant problem
1057.34s: because just like we saw from MetalZone earlier,
1061.58s: I bought calls once expired worthless,
1064.10s: that's super, super common
1065.86s: because if we're looking at a product again like spy
1069.22s: and we take a look at the short term options
1072.94s: that are super far out of the money,
1074.38s: they're very, very cheap,
1075.98s: but there's a reason why they're so cheap
1078.06s: because the probability of them returning
1080.90s: a positive yield is relatively low.
1083.78s: And we'll talk a little bit more about how to read things
1086.90s: like the gamma and theta on the options
1089.94s: so that you get a sense of how they'll behave as time moves
1092.58s: or as the underlying moves,
1094.38s: but the point being is a lot of times the cheaper
1097.30s: the options are the bigger movement required
1100.42s: from a buying perspective in order for them
1102.66s: to actually return anything.
1104.02s: So yeah, it's a really, really important point.
1111.50s: Oh, let's see.
1112.78s: No, you says I've always had the impression
1115.14s: that the barrier to entry is high.
1117.46s: Yeah, that's absolutely true.
1119.02s: That's not wrong at all.
1120.98s: So again, it's high in the sense that options
1125.10s: add more complexity for sure, like we talked about before,
1128.62s: but it's like anything else.
1130.22s: Once you understand the rules set,
1131.94s: it's not that, it's really not that bad.
1134.74s: And the cool part is is that the rules
1136.82s: will carry over over time.
1138.94s: So the way that I think about it is imagine
1141.70s: if you're playing a sport,
1143.66s: the first time you play that sport,
1145.42s: the barrier to entry is pretty high.
1146.98s: You have to learn all the rules.
1148.26s: You have to make sure that you're playing
1151.58s: as best as you can within a certain rules set.
1154.42s: And that can take a little time to get used to
1157.30s: before you even can get to a point
1158.82s: where you can optimize what you're doing
1160.74s: to essentially leverage the rules set,
1163.30s: to move even better in the correct direction,
1166.86s: meaning there are some sports like you jitsu.
1169.34s: There are certain rules that you can bend
1171.42s: to benefit your playstyle.
1173.50s: So with options, it's the same thing.
1176.46s: You have to understand the rules
1178.22s: and there are a lot of them up front.
1180.34s: And there are a lot of small details in options
1183.34s: that are tricky to pick up.
1184.90s: But once you understand them, they're universal.
1188.50s: They're there, they don't change.
1190.22s: And that gives you the ability
1192.82s: to benefit from the rules set.
1194.50s: So there is a relatively high barrier to entry,
1198.10s: but like learning any other skill set,
1200.02s: once you learn the skill set,
1201.94s: it's very, very manageable, I think.
1206.38s: Craig says, I love talking about structures
1208.74s: like it's strategy.
1210.46s: Use the coverage strangle because it's the best.
1213.14s: Not so much.
1214.22s: So when we talk about structures and strategy,
1217.34s: again, to be clear, right,
1219.06s: I think it's a pedantic point in the framing there,
1221.62s: but it's fine to highlight it.
1223.54s: So if we think about structure,
1225.10s: it's literally just a combination of options.
1227.58s: But most of the time when we're referring to structures,
1230.34s: we're discussing them in the context strategy
1233.42s: because very infrequently,
1236.30s: are we talking about option structures
1238.14s: just to talk about them?
1239.26s: We're typically talking about them in the context
1241.42s: of trading them, which would be strategy.
1243.90s: So it's a fair point, but something to highlight.
1247.62s: When somebody says the term option structure,
1249.98s: they literally just mean the combination
1252.50s: of whatever legs of the option that we're talking about.
1257.30s: Strategy is the deployment of that structure,
1260.26s: how you use that structure.
1262.46s: So yeah, it's a fair point to bring up.
1264.86s: And you'll hear people colloquially,
1268.10s: typically refer to it as strategy
1269.86s: because again, the vast majority of the time,
1272.22s: we're not talking about the structures in a vacuum
1274.78s: to just talk about structures.
1276.46s: We're talking about them in the context
1278.38s: of using them in trading, which would be strategy.
1282.78s: Shrejie says, barriers not as high as you'd think,
1286.18s: but it gets steep fast.
1287.14s: That's a great way to phrase it.
1288.50s: That's a great way to phrase it.
1290.18s: And then John says, many blind spots
1291.74s: and learning to trade options.
1292.86s: Now, that's a good point,
1294.34s: but I think as we go through this,
1296.74s: you'll probably find that there are some general rules
1299.38s: that you can apply so that you stay safe.
1303.22s: And then as you gain competence,
1305.66s: you can scope out a little bit more,
1307.74s: a little bit more, a little bit more
1309.54s: without putting yourself in danger.
1311.70s: When I think about probably one of the primary issues
1316.42s: with new traders is that they tend to get in
1320.90s: over their skis too fast,
1322.50s: and then they struggle massively
1324.38s: because they're exposing themselves to risk
1327.38s: that they don't even identify.
1329.66s: Shrejie says, strategy is longer short-vol,
1332.26s: thanks for confirmation that your clue is.
1334.66s: Yeah, I mean,
1336.70s: Jason's Craig has no chill.
1337.82s: Yeah, well, that's kind of some internet people will be like that.
1340.74s: But again, like saying strategy is longer short-vol,
1343.18s: that can be a structure, right?
1344.82s: So I can have a short straddle that is short-vol.
1350.18s: That's still just a structure.
1352.10s: So to be completely honest,
1355.02s: your point is actually completely incorrect
1357.86s: because being longer short-vol can be just a structure.
1361.62s: But the bigger point here is like I was mentioning earlier,
1364.54s: it's just pedantic, right?
1366.10s: Like to try and draw the demarcation between structure and strategy,
1370.78s: like you are, it is literally just to try to pick a word fight.
1374.18s: It's not really productive for anybody.
1377.34s: So back over to introduction to derivatives.
1382.10s: So as we talked about before,
1384.58s: a derivative is a product whose value is derived from something else.
1389.58s: That's what makes it a derivative.
1391.66s: So sometimes I like to use the deed to the to a house as an analogy.
1396.74s: So if you think about the D to a house,
1398.98s: it's just a piece of paper.
1400.30s: This is an iPad, but pretend it's paper and it's not worth anything.
1404.54s: However, that deed gives you rights to real property, a real asset.
1410.34s: So this piece of paper starts to take on a slightly different value perspective
1415.86s: because whoever holds the deed has rights to the property.
1420.26s: So it's kind of a loose analogy, but the overall point behind that
1426.02s: is that you can use options as a tool to grant yourself access
1431.74s: or different relationships with the underlying product,
1434.06s: which you'll see in this chart below.
1436.42s: Options are contracts between two people.
1440.34s: There's always a buyer and seller and this is actually one of the cool parts about them
1443.78s: because they differ than things like stock where stock there is a limit and amount.
1448.54s: There is only the number of shares that exist.
1450.46s: Options are very different.
1451.54s: Options can be created at will.
1453.98s: There's no rules around them provided that there's a counterparty to create the contract.
1460.18s: Whenever that contract is started, there's two sides to every options position.
1466.62s: There's a buyer and a seller.
1468.42s: The vast majority of the time you as the market participant are going to be paired
1473.94s: with a market maker.
1476.06s: However, over time, that market maker is looking to offload their risk.
1481.18s: So eventually, the other side of your contract can be another trader,
1485.42s: but the vast majority of the time, it's going to be a market maker at least to open your position.
1490.54s: Whoever buys the option, they have a right to do something.
1496.50s: So if you buy calls or sell puts, I'm sorry, or buy puts, I got to fix this.
1507.62s: Jay says, is this recorded by any chance?
1509.82s: Yeah, so it'll be available on YouTube live.
1512.86s: So, oh, I see what I was writing here.
1515.46s: So if you buy calls, you essentially have the right to buy shares at a set price.
1523.34s: If you buy puts, you have the right to sell shares at a set price by a specific date.
1530.14s: And we'll talk about the details and what those actually look like.
1533.42s: Sellers, then we receive money to fulfill the other side of this trade.
1541.34s: So if I sell a call, then I now have the obligation to then take the other side of that trade.
1551.34s: So we'll talk about settlement in a little bit, which is a really important element here.
1556.98s: The main takeaway from this point is that the buyer of an option has the right to do something with that option.
1565.50s: The seller of an option, whether it's a call or a put, is obligated to do something.
1573.30s: So notice how I just use those terms, calls and puts.
1576.86s: There are two kinds of options.
1578.54s: Those are the two.
1580.22s: Now, universally, they have some traits about them that are really useful to note.
1586.70s: And you can take a look at that here.
1589.30s: So calls grant the buyer the right to buy shares.
1596.78s: Calls grant, I'm sorry, long puts grant the buyer the right to sell shares, which is what we talked about up here.
1605.62s: And then on the short side, which is another term that we use for selling options.
1611.78s: I purposely use these different terms in here because you'll hear traders refer to all of them,
1617.62s: but they do have different meanings, kind of like what Craig was talking about before, like structures and strategy.
1623.74s: They get colloquially mashed up.
1625.86s: And it's the same thing with buying, being long, or having a debit to open a position.
1633.22s: So in that sense, you'll find a lot of terminology has tons of different meanings.
1642.10s: Craig says it's productive to have a baseline understanding of trading options and not mistake in an option structure.
1647.58s: Is having an edge.
1649.30s: Again, I think you're kind of taking something multiple steps beyond what I said.
1654.14s: And it's actually a great point because a structure has no edge.
1656.94s: And there's no point in the video that I said a structure has an edge.
1660.54s: But it's kind of clear that you're just looking to talk just to talk.
1665.54s: So you're doing great, though, by the way.
1668.74s: Anyways, back to actual learning about options.
1673.82s: So when we look at the term short, when it pertains to the transaction to open a position,
1681.98s: that absolutely means that you sold to open.
1687.58s: So if you're short in option, that's synonymous with sold to open.
1693.26s: If you're long in option, it means that you bought to open.
1698.54s: The case says, who hurt you, Craig? Leave, man.
1701.42s: Yeah, it's all good, dude.
1702.54s: It's honestly, we can kick Craig out whenever we want.
1705.50s: I try not to do that, right?
1706.90s: Like the overall goal is to give people an opportunity to interact like people.
1711.66s: But you can tell from the chat so far that he just wants to argue a little bit,
1715.70s: which is you could tell I like arguing.
1717.10s: So I'm okay with it.
1720.26s: Provided that he can stay respectful.
1721.86s: I don't really care.
1724.74s: J Kim says, if you're selling to open, who did you borrow the option from?
1728.62s: Great question.
1730.86s: So if you're selling to open, you don't have to borrow anything.
1735.34s: And that is a fantastic point.
1737.74s: You simply are starting a new contract.
1740.62s: So remember when we were talking about the correlation between options and shares of stock,
1747.74s: shares have a finite number and they have to be borrowed if you sell to open.
1752.46s: With options, it's completely different.
1754.26s: You literally enter a agreement with somebody else and you can create those agreements at will.
1760.78s: So technically speaking, there's no borrowing at the point of selling an option.
1766.34s: You're creating a new contract taking the short side of it.
1769.94s: Let me know if that makes sense.
1773.98s: Craig says selling a course on options, which he doesn't understand.
1777.58s: Let's also again, could you show me the course that I have?
1780.66s: Because I don't, but.
1783.34s: Actually, I think we're.
1786.06s: Think we're about here.
1787.18s: We'll put you on time out, actually.
1788.70s: We'll just give you like a couple minutes.
1790.46s: We'll give you like a five minutes to see if you're able to.
1794.78s: Get yourself together.
1797.30s: It's actually hilarious that you can time out somebody on a YouTube live.
1801.94s: And it literally feels like I'm doing that to a child.
1804.42s: It's my favorite thing.
1805.70s: The fact that there's a grown human being that just got put in time out.
1809.58s: That's hilarious.
1812.50s: Okay, cool.
1813.02s: So Jay's following along.
1814.22s: That's perfect.
1814.98s: Yeah, that's one of the fascinating points about options actually is they maintain that capability.
1820.26s: That they can be created at will.
1822.70s: All right, so look, let's look at the common traits between calls and puts and how they react to some of those different conditions that we talked about before.
1832.86s: So if the underlying, which is another term for stock, I use stock here because most people know what a stock is, but I'll use underlying interchangeably because it's not always a stock.
1845.06s: Again, it's another pedantic point like our friend Craig probably would want to argue about.
1850.14s: But materially, it doesn't make a absolute difference at all other than knowing the difference, which is important.
1856.06s: But for a beginner perspective, you can insert stock underlying.
1859.54s: It's all the same context here.
1862.06s: The reason why we differentiate between them, those because again, if we go back here, you realize that stock is a type of equity.
1868.78s: However, you can trade options on ETFs.
1871.18s: You can trade them on bonds notes, other kinds of products.
1873.94s: So that's the difference here.
1876.74s: So when we take a look at when the underlying price moves, so just saying that the underlying goes up or the underlying goes down, the underlying goes up calls will always appreciate and value across the board.
1891.70s: All of them will.
1893.34s: And if the underlying goes down calls across the board will depreciate.
1899.46s: They'll go down and value.
1901.58s: The puts you'll notice there are the inverse as the underlying goes up puts become less expensive. They depreciate.
1910.78s: And as the underlying goes down puts become more expensive. They appreciate.
1917.50s: An interesting part with options that kind of makes them a little easier on the volatility side of things is that volatility impacts the premium of options generally is the same.
1927.90s: Again, there's always slight nuances.
1929.74s: Once you get into the practical applications of things, but if volatility goes up both call and put premium goes up.
1939.46s: If volatility goes down both call and put premium goes down.
1945.02s: So when I'm referring to premium in this sense, you'll notice that options contracts have a handful of very specific components.
1953.86s: And in this case, one of those components is premium that's simply the value of the option.
1961.66s: So when we look at the price of a stock that share price, that's the value of the stock options have their own value.
1971.18s: And the reason being is because that contract gives people the right to do something or the obligation to do something.
1979.02s: And there's a price associated with that.
1981.54s: Now the way to think about this using the real estate example before again, it's not a pure one to one, but it's pretty close where if you think about whole sailing a house.
1993.22s: So there's somebody that can essentially trade the right to purchase a property and there's a premium associated with that right. It's kind of the same thing here.
2003.14s: So the other components of a contract or whatever underlying we're referring to.
2009.70s: So a example of this is this all of these options in here listed in this chain, which will become more familiar with in a little bit.
2021.22s: All of them only pertain to spy, which is the underlying. This is an ETF in this case. All of these pertain only to spy.
2031.42s: So that's the underlying component.
2034.70s: Days to expiration is how long is this agreement good for the reason why this matters is imagine you and I were to make a bet.
2044.74s: And the bet was that the weather tomorrow, I live in San Diego and today it was kind of cloudy. Maybe I forgot what the high was maybe like high 60s.
2053.82s: And if I were to make a bet that in the future, the weather is going to be also 68 degrees.
2062.10s: If I were to make that bet in the short term, we kind of know what the probability of it being 60 degrees pretty high.
2070.14s: But if that bet was for a really long time and the wager was if at some point we need to be higher than 68 degrees.
2081.58s: Where is it more probable that the temperature will be higher than 68 degrees within one day or within 360 days over the course of the year.
2092.62s: Probably over the course of the year.
2095.50s: So when we're looking at stuff like this, it's important to understand that the time component to options increase the premium.
2103.66s: The longer the days to expiration, the DTE, the more expensive options will be.
2110.70s: The strike price, this is super important because when we talk about the right to buy shares or the this the right to sell shares or the obligation to buy or the obligation to sell.
2124.18s: In this case, this is what price are we talking about? Where do we buy the shares at? What price you do it at the strike price.
2133.70s: So again, it's kind of like using the D to the house and on the D to the house or probably not on the sale contract technically.
2142.50s: There will be a agreed price.
2145.46s: That is the strike price of an option. Whatever you the seller and the counterparty, the buyer or vice versa are agreeing to look at.
2154.82s: So let's take a look at some of these traits in this section.
2158.30s: So if we look across all these different explorations, that's what these are.
2163.98s: And if we look into one of them, you'll notice on the left hand side here, it's kind of small, but you should be able to see it.
2170.14s: This is calls and then this over here says puts.
2173.50s: Then down the center, we have just a reminder of the expiration.
2177.22s: It's just a repeat of what's up here.
2179.30s: And in this case, this represents 42 DTE days to expiration.
2185.38s: Then you'll notice we have the strike price down the center.
2188.90s: So all of this is relative to whether it's a call or put.
2194.50s: That's why the strike is in the center.
2198.10s: Craig says D to the house is not a good analogy.
2200.26s: It'd be like saying that physical stock certificate is an option.
2202.82s: Yeah, I agree with you.
2203.46s: Again, I said it's a loose analogy just to give people a little more familiarity with some sort of contract.
2208.26s: Because I think giving them something like swaps is slightly less useful.
2213.86s: But yeah, I agree with you.
2214.90s: It's not a one-to-one analogy, which again, if you're listening, I said that.
2218.98s: It's just an example of some other piece of a transaction that has a relationship to an asset.
2224.82s: But bigger concepts like that might be hard to grasp if you're too focused on, you know, pedantically arguing moot points.
2234.02s: All right, let's get caught up on the question.
2235.82s: So, notice this, have you ever had an in the money call with no liquidity?
2241.14s: What do you mean by liquidity?
2243.22s: Because just about any single position will have liquidity, it's just a matter at what cost.
2251.38s: So, when we're trading options, we care about having more liquidity.
2255.14s: A smotus says no buyer.
2257.14s: Very infrequent.
2258.34s: It could happen, technically speaking.
2260.18s: But sooner or later, the mandate for a market maker is to provide markets.
2265.86s: The only thing is they can create whatever price is desirable to them.
2270.90s: So, you can have examples where something, let's see if we can find one.
2274.58s: Maybe not in spy, it might not be the greatest example, but
2280.10s: these all have OI.
2282.66s: Yeah, so maybe if we look in something, this is way less liquid.
2285.54s: We could look at like QLD.
2290.66s: So, this is a really good example.
2294.18s: So, looking at the 69 giga-d strike price in QLD out in 16 Jan, which is 588 days to
2303.46s: expiration, really long term, that's called a leaps option.
2308.18s: You can see that right here, the OI is zero and it has no volume.
2312.82s: Nobody's transacted here.
2314.58s: However, you can still see there's a market, super wide, but there's still a market.
2319.86s: So, the point being is the mandate for a market maker is to provide a market.
2324.18s: However, again, they can quote something that's 69 strike, that's super far out in time,
2329.78s: which will widen the bit-ask spread.
2331.78s: But nonetheless, it's $4 wide, there's still a market here.
2336.18s: So, the vast majority of instances, you will have liquidity.
2340.42s: It's just not always good liquidity.
2342.58s: So, Samota, that's the kind of long, more exploratory answer to your question.
2350.18s: Let's see.
2354.66s: Jay says, do calls and puts appreciate with higher volatility because there's more demand for
2359.38s: options for hedging? That's definitely part of it.
2362.10s: But the main reason why higher volatility impacts the premium for options is because when we're
2368.90s: talking about volatility in the context of the underlying, all that is an expectation of movement.
2375.94s: That's all volatility means it's literally movement and it's variance.
2381.38s: So, if we take a look at something that has a higher expected movement,
2386.66s: as compared to something that has a smaller expected movement,
2390.50s: from both the buying and selling perspective of that trade,
2394.98s: when there's more volatility, more expected movement, there's higher risk potential,
2400.34s: but also higher reward potential.
2403.54s: So, if you buy a call that has massive expected movement like GameStop right now,
2409.46s: if you look at something like GameStop compared to something else of a relative price,
2414.26s: the volatility right now in GameStop is very, very high on a relative basis.
2418.66s: And that's because it's moving so much.
2421.30s: So, if you buy a call, your potential benefit is very high if it moves in your favor.
2427.62s: If you sold that call, your potential risk is massive because if it does get one of these
2434.10s: giant moves and you sold a call that's going to hurt your position a lot.
2438.34s: So, that's why volatility has that kind of unilateral impact in general for premium of options.
2444.74s: It's a good question.
2446.98s: Craig says, use rent to own that actually is a strike price for the home.
2450.74s: I agree with you. I think that's a good one provided that there's an existing contract for it.
2454.58s: But yeah, I think that's a good example.
2457.06s: Rudy says, would you say that it's best for a beginner to day trade options or trade options
2463.78s: that will take days in the long run, not sure if I'm making sense? No, that's making a ton of
2467.54s: sense. That's okay. So, I think the real answer to that question, which is really unsexy,
2473.94s: but it's the genuine. I think the best way for new options traders to trade options is to paper trade
2480.18s: them. The reason why I say that, and that's using fake money essentially, the reason why I say
2485.46s: that is because we talked about this idea of complexity. And the first time I played rugby,
2491.06s: I didn't know that you can't run behind somebody, right? You have to run forward.
2496.74s: That messed me up. So, the first time I got the ball in my very first real rugby game,
2500.98s: I ran behind somebody. And obviously, you were to give the ball up because I committed a penalty.
2507.06s: I didn't know all of the rules. And I made a giant mistake on the first one. And to be honest,
2513.14s: I actually knew that rule, but my instincts kicked in. And I just made the wrong decision
2517.62s: in terms of where I was running. So, it's similar to options where there's a lot of little rules
2524.50s: that can be very tricky. And the fact of the matter is the probability of a brand new
2530.34s: option trader taking a tiny amount of money and then turning it into a giant sum of money
2536.90s: is so low. It's so low. So, I bring that up because there's really little benefit for an
2543.86s: options trader to immediately start trading options with real money as compared to the all likelihood
2550.02s: of them drastically scaling down their account, drawing down their account, which is way more
2555.14s: difficult for them to build up over time. Because as you guys know, as the percent decline builds,
2560.34s: the percent required to get back to break even expands. That's volatility decay.
2565.46s: So, it's why sometimes you can actually have a slightly underperforming strategy that outperforms
2572.66s: something that has better high years, but worse low years. That volatility variance in their
2579.22s: P&L actually serves as drag on the returns. There's a lot of really good research on that exact
2586.42s: principle that I think is kind of worth for people to be aware of. It's called Shannon's Demon.
2592.82s: And it talks about how minimizing variance can actually increase returns without increasing
2600.26s: top line returns. It's one of the primary approaches that I've taken to trading.
2606.26s: All right. So, I want to take a pause on this slide and see if you guys have any question.
2613.06s: Okay, Rudy has one. Can you give me a quick example of paper trading or word? Yeah, of course.
2617.54s: So, if we use a platform like think or swim, you can go into this, I don't know if this pops up
2622.50s: on your guys' screen or not, but in the top right here, you'll see it says on demand. If I click
2627.22s: on demand, this is now allowing me to go back in time to some other period. And this is fake money.
2634.10s: So, I can enter an exit trade you see where it says these are simulated trades. You can essentially
2639.70s: place trades in here and see how they do. Now, this is back in time. So, if you want to actually
2645.94s: paper trade today right now with something like think or swim, they have that ability. You
2651.14s: essentially tick it when you're logging into the platform. And it's just a fake account. Now,
2655.94s: that's what TD, well, I guess not TD Ameritrade anymore. Schwab. It's what Schwab offers.
2660.74s: Other brokers will have paper trading available. I think one of the best things you could do to paper
2665.38s: trade though is literally do it in a Google Sheet or Excel. And the reason why that's really
2670.10s: useful is because you maintain the data set. You keep the data. And that's a giant mistake.
2675.86s: I made as a new trader when I was paper trading here and there. And I didn't do a great job at it.
2680.74s: I would approach that very differently if I were to do it again. But one of the main things is
2687.14s: every time you reset the account, all the data is gone. And that's kind of just a waste of time
2692.90s: and effort beyond what you can remember. So doing your best to paper trade upfront,
2700.34s: track what you're doing so that you can revisit how things behave is super, super useful.
2707.22s: Alex says ES is correct. I jumped into options years ago and lost money without even realizing why.
2712.66s: And more importantly, I didn't know what questions to ask. For example, stock goes up,
2715.94s: option goes down exactly. That's such a great point. And I'm glad that you shared that experience
2719.70s: because we've literally all been there before where the underlying goes in your favor,
2724.82s: but you're not making money and you don't know why it's a giant problem. And doing that with real
2730.42s: money, it just doesn't help you out that much. Now, I want to be really clear. This concept of
2736.90s: paper trading is really useful. However, paper trading will never fully replicate live trading.
2744.98s: So you can't only paper trade, but I think it's great to paper trade upfront,
2749.46s: get all those mistakes out of the way and then move on.
2753.78s: Yes, still doesn't know why. Yeah, maybe sometimes the markets do really screwy things. But since
2758.82s: you're being a child, I got to be, you know, the parent here, I'll put you back in time out for
2763.22s: five minutes there. Craig, let us know when you are ready to behave like a grown adult. If not,
2770.58s: I mean, we can just kick you off. We'll give you a chance, though. We'll see. We'll see if you
2773.78s: could pull it together there, buddy. So any other questions on the introduction to derivatives,
2780.50s: kind of what calls are, what puts are, what the prospect of opening a position looks like.
2786.90s: Another thing I didn't mention before that's worth mentioning in case it's not semi-intuitive
2791.78s: is the inverse of this. This is how you close the positions. So if we bought to open a position,
2799.70s: the way you close that position is you sell to close. And if you sold to open, the inverse to
2809.06s: that position is by close, just the inverse. Cool. So I think we're good here so far. This is just
2819.38s: an option chain, which we talked a little bit about before. Paul says, how do you keep track of
2825.38s: vol can you charge for that? Yeah, definitely. So there's volatility that exists in a lot of
2830.10s: different states. So if we come, let's use like a normal ticker like spy and you can go into the
2838.26s: options chain. First thing you can do is take a look at the volatility relative to all these
2846.50s: different explorations. So when we think about volatility in trading, there are a few different
2855.94s: levels that apply. So we can have the volatility for an individual expiration cycle. We can have
2865.54s: the volatility for individual options. So in this case, if we come in here, that's what this column
2870.50s: is. I have a lot of stuff. So it's kind of difficult to see. But this percentage is implied volatility.
2876.10s: Then if we go down to the underlying itself, it will also have volatility.
2885.30s: So the way that you can track it is a few different methods. The easiest one is if your broker
2894.34s: has a tool to show you volatility. So you can essentially see how it behaves over time like this.
2900.74s: Or you can create plots like this. But this is at the equity level. This is at the stock level.
2907.54s: This is what the volatility looks like. And there are different kinds of volatility, which we actually
2912.42s: have a section on that in a little bit. But when we're talking about options, more often than not
2917.22s: we're using implied volatility. But then there's also historic volatility. There's different kinds
2923.86s: of realized volatility. There's future realized. There's realized that's historic. So there's
2930.34s: bunches of volatility, technically speaking, but from a beginner perspective, the important ones
2936.10s: are implied and historic. Or cast matters, which we'll touch on. But it doesn't matter as much
2943.54s: in the short term timeframe. Polo says, what is the mathematical definition of volatility? Yeah.
2951.14s: So the way to think about volatility in a nutshell, it literally is just variance. It's how much
2955.78s: something moves. So if something is very volatile. So again, if we look at the volatility of spy,
2963.06s: the implied volatility of it is 12.83%. And you can see how much it moves. I have a couple different
2968.82s: metrics for that. We'll use the 12 day average true range in this case. The 12 day ATR is 1%. You
2975.94s: don't have to know exactly what all those details mean. Just know that spy, which the implied
2981.54s: volatility is 12.83%. Its ATR is 1%. Then if we go to GameStop,
2989.14s: its volatility is 253%. And its 12 day ATR is 25%. So what this is highlighting is the higher the
2998.74s: implied volatility is for something, literally the more it's expected to move. That's all. That's why
3004.58s: when we're talking about volatility and trading, we have forward looking volatility, which is
3009.94s: implied and forecast. And then we have backwards looking volatility, which is historic.
3014.98s: So historic volatility is literally just the stock price. How much it moves? You can track it
3020.18s: in different time frames. That's what these white lines here are. Our historic volatility.
3026.66s: So implied volatility is looking forward. Historic volatility is what happened in the past.
3033.70s: Middle zone is, okay, that's what I was missing and just let them expire. It was confusing me that
3041.86s: when I tried to close them, it was wanting me to sell the calls. Yeah, exactly. So when you want to
3047.06s: close an options position, you essentially have to inverse whatever you did to open it.
3052.42s: Alex says, volatility math is dispersion of data around the mean or over a period of time,
3057.06s: variance is the difference from the mean. Yeah, it's obviously even better than I can
3061.62s: colloquially explain it. That's really good grab from investor media.
3066.74s: So and that's actually why you'll notice before when I was talking about volatility that you
3071.54s: essentially can use variance in the same context, right? Volatility is dispersion around the
3076.26s: mean. Variance is the difference from the mean. That's also dispersion.
3080.58s: Jay says, would it be accurate to say volatility is a measurement of sentiment? Yeah, definitely.
3085.30s: Volatility primarily is a measurement of movement and you can use volatility then to infer what we
3093.14s: expect the movement of something to be. So if we come in here, which is actually pretty cool,
3099.14s: you can look at this tool and actually let me get something that's not squarely something
3103.30s: that's normal. We'll use spy. So notice this is called a probability cone and this essentially
3110.26s: is taking the volatility for the underlying itself across the various explorations and it's
3116.74s: giving you the probability in this case of a one standard deviation move plus or minus.
3123.78s: You can change this. It can be two standard deviation moves. So this will capture 95.6 95.5%
3130.82s: of data and then you can even have three standard deviation moves, which captures 99.7% of data.
3139.30s: So when we're talking about volatility in the context of options, it's quite literally just
3145.30s: how much do we expect the underlying to move and that then would impact the premium that we
3152.18s: price into options. Jay says, so it's kind of like standard deviation with time. Yeah, so you can
3160.34s: annualize volatility. That's typically what we would do. So when we're talking about volatility
3165.86s: in this context down here, the implied volatility for the underlying itself, that's the annualized
3171.30s: standard deviations of volatility of movement. And when you're looking at volatility, however,
3177.70s: you can break it down into smaller time frames that doesn't have to be annualized. So in this
3183.38s: case, you can see that the, let's call it the 10 June expiration is 6.83% implied volatility.
3191.06s: So this is relative to this time frame. That's one of the cool parts about options is you can use it
3196.18s: to come up with inferences on where price movements might be based on how the market is pricing
3202.34s: options. So that is a great, a great point. All right, let's get back to this.
3212.58s: So let's take a look now at the mononess and the premium of an option. I want to break this down
3222.50s: a little bit more. The reason why is because the premium of an option has kind of two big components.
3231.30s: It has intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic reflects how far in the money it is.
3237.78s: Extrinsic value represents how much time is left in the options, which includes a volatility input.
3246.82s: The reason why it's important to understand the difference between these two is because of the
3251.62s: way that they behave. So first, let's start with mononess. And this is kind of one of those rules
3258.50s: that you just have to accept. And then over time, it'll be more natural. So we'll start with the
3265.78s: call side of the equation. Notice kind of this shaded area. And then there's this black area.
3274.10s: The shaded area represents in the money. The black area represents out of the money. That's on
3279.46s: the call side. And then if you look at the put side, notice how it's essentially inverted.
3283.62s: They're catty-quartered to one another. So the black side on the put side represents out of the
3288.58s: money. And then the shaded area represents in the money. Okay, so what does that actually mean?
3293.22s: Is there any brave souls that want to take a guess at how you determine if an option is in the
3301.46s: money or not based on what you see here? And I can even close back into this. As a hint, I want you
3309.22s: to look at where the underlying the last price was. So the underlying the last price in spy was
3316.26s: 534. So what do you notice?
3327.22s: Joe says price. Yep. There you go. That's exactly right. So what about price? How do we use price
3336.90s: to infer if we are in the money or not? Well, no, you says where the underlying is relative to
3346.90s: the strike price. That's exactly right. And then Pat says price is higher. Exactly. Correct.
3351.14s: Jay says in the money when the underlying is greater than the strike, exactly. Correct. Nice
3355.78s: shop. Literally all you got it 100% correct. That's for the call side. So whenever you have an
3361.06s: option that the strike price is less than the current price that's in the money. That means
3366.90s: it has intrinsic value. If it's out of the money, it means it has no intrinsic value. And this
3374.66s: is all extrinsic value, which is composed of time and volatility. So as we add more time, the more
3385.54s: extrinsic value we have, as we add more volatility or expected movement, premiums will also go up
3393.38s: for out of the money options and in the money options. So when we look at the put side,
3400.34s: it's the inverse. So if your strike price is above the current price, you're in the money.
3407.06s: And if your strike price is below, you're out of the money. So one of the cool parts is
3413.46s: and what Joe is doing there is actually a really common mistake that I want to highlight
3418.26s: because it's it's really important to know. He says a long call strike lower than current.
3425.14s: It's really, really important to break away from whether you're long or short. It doesn't matter.
3432.74s: The call doesn't care if it was sold or if it was bought to open, the call doesn't care which
3438.02s: way you want it to go. The way to think about it is purely in relation strike to underlying.
3445.38s: Not whether it was bought, not whether it was sold. That's a really common error that new traders make
3450.90s: and it becomes kind of confusing because then our brains start wanting to make it
3456.82s: related too much to whether or not we bought or sold and what we want to happen. And that can be
3462.58s: confusing. We'll stretch those as I mean I'm not wrong. You're not at all. And yet that's completely
3468.10s: okay. The the point I'm highlighting though is that long doesn't matter. And that's a really
3474.10s: confusing point for people when that gets included into the equation. But you're absolutely correct.
3479.94s: The important part of that statement is call strike lower than current price. That's exactly correct.
3487.54s: Oops, wrong one. Let's go back over here.
3493.30s: Any questions on this part down here? Any questions on an option premium?
3503.78s: And how that's broken down. Hey Craig's back from time out. It's good to see you. Craig says
3508.26s: just pedantics and well that's not the correct way to use that term which is pedantic. But yeah,
3514.34s: it's in that case and as I said it's exactly as Joe said he's not wrong at all. But from my experience
3521.78s: with people with options that if we start including the long or short aspect of moneyness it
3528.74s: just unnecessarily can found things right because at the simplest form it doesn't matter if the
3534.82s: option was long short doesn't matter at all it has everything to do with strike relative to
3541.46s: underlying. So yeah. So it looks like we're good on premium. Now let's talk a little bit about
3551.14s: the Greeks and then I want to walk through some of your guys' specific questions that we can
3558.10s: dive into. Craig says you explain things really well. Well done. Thank you very much. Yeah, I actually
3563.14s: try to help people which I know is kind of a different form than popping in a live on Friday which
3569.14s: is actually hilarious that your goal there was just to kind of try to troll. But yeah, I appreciate
3575.30s: that compliment because I do try to help people. It's an important thing to me. I had a lot of help
3580.50s: along my path. So I think finding people and working with people and trying to share that with
3586.42s: others is actually super, super important. Jay says for extrinsic value, are you saying that
3592.26s: volatility is part of the calculation for time value? Yeah. So volatility is part of the calculation
3598.50s: for extrinsic value. So it's we want to make sure that we differentiate those two values from one
3607.22s: another because you can discreetly isolate time value. It's quite literally just the duration
3612.82s: until expiration. So if you look at something like the Black Sholes Merton model, there is a way
3620.58s: to discreetly derive the specific time value of a premium. And again, it's based on how far out in time.
3629.70s: We know that at all given points. Volatility in order to figure out what volatility is
3637.38s: sophisticated traders and investors, typically market makers, institutions, they have volatility
3642.90s: forecasts. So this typically is done via a surface model that they maintain. They use different pricing
3649.46s: rules. They use recent price data to then project what they think volatility is going to be going
3655.94s: forward. Then price discovery occurs where different people essentially puts in put in their
3661.22s: bids on what they think volatility is going to be, which eventually normalizes and stabilizes price.
3667.06s: Then we would take implied volatility out of that. And that's how we can see what the volatility
3672.66s: input is. Now it is entirely possible for a retail trader to maintain a forecast, but it's very
3679.54s: likely not going to be better than what you're going to get from implied because essentially what
3683.14s: the insinuation is there, that we are able to more accurately predict volatility than the broad
3689.30s: market consensus, which again, it can happen, but it's just not entirely likely.
3702.74s: Let's see. So Joe says, I appreciate your help. He got me to take action towards a gig I want
3708.10s: today. Hey, that's actually great to hear. We were talking about that yesterday. That is massively,
3712.02s: massively awesome for me to hear. You have to tell me about that. A big A says he's used to explain
3717.54s: it to crayon eaters. So he's build up an ability to break things down. Barney style. Yeah, well,
3721.54s: because for both of us, that's the only way that I can understand as well as Barney style. I
3727.54s: need to broken down as simple as humanly possible. Craig says green is Eric's favorite. That's
3734.82s: actually funny because I feel like Craig has been wrong nonstop and it's good to see it continue
3739.94s: because red is actually my favorite color. I love me some red crayons. Those are the only ones I
3745.86s: buy after the red crayons. Big A says sell in extrancyc and buy intrinsic says the book. I was caught
3755.46s: up buying out of the money being cheap. I don't know if that's the exact way that I would break that
3762.50s: down, but I think that that is fair to start with. The problem is, yeah, I think that that's fair.
3771.70s: I think that's okay. The problem is it starts to lose a little bit of nuance in different
3776.98s: positions like covered calls and stuff like that where you actually might want to sell intrinsic,
3781.06s: which is slightly different style, but you can use that for like a dividend capture strategy.
3785.46s: But yeah, I think in general, that's a completely fair place to start. Ian says do you use options
3792.42s: in core allocation or speculative? I use it across the entire portfolio. So my trading portfolio is
3798.26s: all options like my primary margin account is all options positions. Now I do have equity that
3804.34s: comes in and out as part of my options strategies, but in general, it's options positions and then
3813.78s: a hold equities as part of a broader strategy that I'm running.
3818.50s: Cool. So now we should be able to identify if an option is in the money or out of the money,
3825.38s: and if we know if it's in the money or out of the money, we also know what the premium of that
3831.38s: option includes. Now the reason why this matters so much is when we think about the impacts of various
3840.34s: market forces on the premium of an option, you'll see how important this becomes. And we actually
3847.14s: get a first glimpse of that through the Greeks. Now for those that are interested, I have a video that
3853.22s: goes super deep in depth on the Greeks. And for those that are curious, you can grab a screenshot
3859.86s: from this, which essentially is just a reference guide for the various Greeks that we have.
3869.22s: Craig says dividend capture strategies with someone that doesn't know what they're talking about
3872.50s: what suggests selling vol is a bet on vol not trying to capture some made up dividend.
3879.70s: Yeah, I mean, honestly, the more I hear you talk, the more I understand that you're one of those
3884.02s: people that really think you know what you're talking about, but you actually don't. It's fascinating
3888.18s: because that's like the most unique psyche to come across. But dividend, I again, didn't say that
3896.66s: selling the call in a different capture strategy is predicated on vol or talking about extrinsic value.
3905.14s: I feel like maybe you struggle to like maintain pace with like base conversation. So just
3910.58s: general tip is to we have two two ears in one mouth, I guess two hands. So that might be why you're
3916.10s: typing so much, but use the proverbial mouth, right? So spend more time listening and trying to digest
3921.62s: this compared to thinking about what you're going to say because a lot of what you're saying is,
3926.66s: it's just nonsense, which is quite entertaining to me actually as I look at it. But
3932.10s: great great ad, I guess. So going back to the Greeks to get us back on track after a little bit of
3939.62s: comedic relief, we can take a look at what the primary Greeks are, which actually consist of first
3950.02s: order Greeks and one second order Greek. And if you look at this graph, it actually shows that
3956.50s: there's even more and there are more Greeks beyond this. But from a retail trading perspective,
3961.94s: you can care about things like charm, vanna, vulgar, like those will come up. But the vast
3968.98s: majority of cases, you really don't have to worry so much about this because the vast majority
3976.82s: of what you'll derive the benefit from is delta theta, Vega, gamma and row. Notice how gamma is
3985.38s: a second order Greek. So how can you tell if it's first order or second order? Well, let's take a look.
3990.82s: So if we take a look at delta, it's the premium rate of change, beta, premium rate of change,
3999.22s: Vega premium rate of change, row premium rate of change. What do you notice about all of these?
4005.38s: What these four are measuring are how premium changes with respect to another variable.
4014.82s: So delta measures premium rate of change per one point move in the underlying price.
4022.02s: Something like theta gives us rate of change for the passage of time. Vega for movements in volatility.
4033.22s: And then row per movement in the risk free rate, which is kind of variable depending on the
4039.46s: duration of the option that you're trading. However, when let me see, we're looking at the Greeks.
4046.66s: Let me grab that video. Alex says you have a copy of page six. Yeah, I do. Let me grab that video for you.
4057.94s: There you go. So that video there goes super far in depth.
4071.78s: Yep. And big Ace available in discord's Patreon. Yeah, definitely. So if you can also grab it
4078.98s: there, but you can grab a screenshot for free. Craig says there's a shell. It's so fascinating to
4086.50s: see somebody refer to that as chilling, but I mean, it's got to be interesting living.
4094.58s: No, you says yes, Craig, a free video is a shell. That's the problem with people like Greg, man.
4099.14s: Is again, you could tell the kind of just imagine where you're at in life where all you have to do
4104.34s: on a Friday night is hop on a stream to try to troll somebody. It's one of the most miraculous
4112.02s: things I've come across since I joined the internet is that there are people in such a low state of
4117.54s: existence that that's their move. My favorite. Joe says he's literally giving it away. Yeah,
4126.26s: that's exactly it. StrayG says you need to share the arts of trolling with Craig. Yeah, because I
4133.22s: mean, honestly, Joe has a really hilarious way of trolling that's actually good. But Craig says
4140.34s: is it to shield 20 people about a subject that you don't know anything about again, the problem
4145.30s: just so you know another fun fact Craig before we just kind of have to put you in time out again
4149.54s: because again, apparently your child and you don't learn. But the cool part is you lose validity
4156.10s: when you speak and miss truths, right? So even if you think what I'm saying is inaccurate or wrong
4161.22s: or you don't like how the way I phrase some of it to say that I don't know anything about a subject,
4166.66s: but again, like it's I can show you objective truths that aren't up for debate whether or not
4172.82s: you or I agree on how I phrased it. Better accurate, right? So the problem is is when you say things
4178.82s: that you don't know anything about, but it's objectively wrong. You really lose credibility as a
4184.10s: troll. So I think something that would be really useful to you is to kind of work on your skill set
4190.26s: a little bit. But he says there's a lot of skills in this base. I don't blame anyone
4196.26s: expecting that. I expect it. Yeah, definitely. That's absolutely true. I cannot I cannot agree more.
4203.46s: That's actually reason why I started doing this stuff. All right. So now that we got our next
4211.22s: or I guess our last variance of just going back and forth, let's go over what time we got six,
4220.66s: 10. Yeah, let's pop over and we'll take a look at some of the specific questions that you guys
4225.86s: have. And then if you have any questions on what we covered in here, then we can absolutely dive
4232.82s: into them. But let me get this over out of the way. And let's take a look. So we can get rid of this.
4248.74s: All right, let me help you out, Joe. Back in time out you go for five minutes. We'll see in a few
4256.10s: homey. All right. So let's go over some of your specific questions. All right. The very first ones that I
4267.46s: see. I'll move this down here are up here. Let me see. Jay says I'm reading the paper betting
4278.34s: against the crowd. I was wondering if aggregate call order imbalance can be used as a
4282.34s: contrarian signal to set up trades. I'm new. So I don't know if that's even a good. It's a
4286.02s: completely great question. There's nothing wrong with that question at all. And so I think the
4291.38s: easiest way to objectively answer that question, which I do not have the data set right now.
4296.50s: But I can absolutely look at that. I have a massive data set that I query against for kind of
4302.66s: different thesis like that. You can use order imbalances to speculate on where things may or may not
4310.74s: go. And you can use it to attempt to front run trades. But I don't know what the efficacy is in a
4317.70s: large data sample is what that boils down to. So I don't have a discreet answer for you because I
4323.38s: don't know the objective answer to it. But I also would say that when you look at order imbalances,
4329.70s: I think the idea of contrarian signals is interesting. So I have to take a look at that paper myself,
4336.58s: which I'll actually pull it up so that we can see what they're. Oh, it's a book. I see.
4343.70s: So it's essentially all about contrarian. Yeah. So I don't know the specific section that you're
4355.30s: reading. So again, I wouldn't want to give you guys bomb scoop. But the general approach that I
4361.70s: take to trading is less so of a contrarian, contrarian nature. Contrarian trading, I think, sounds
4368.82s: really, really appealing. And it's something that I think people like the sound of. It sounds
4374.42s: really cool, right? To be smarter than everybody and to catch a pivot point. But I tend to find it to
4380.18s: be a lower efficacy system. So more often than not, I'm going to try to follow the trend as best as
4386.90s: I can. So I think that using call order imbalances as a contrarian signal could be
4394.58s: the
4395.38s: sus, but we'd have to take a look at it more closely. I don't have a discrete answer for you. It's a good question,
4400.50s: though. It's one that actually has me interested.
4405.46s: Let's take a look at some of the simple ones here. So this one says if you trade volatility and how
4411.78s: you do it, I absolutely do trade volatility. So here, I'm going to share a video with you guys
4418.18s: that outlines kind of the primary approach that I take, which is attempting to trade variance
4423.30s: risk premium. So risk premium in options is the tendency for implied volatility to remain
4433.14s: higher and overstated relative to realized volatility. That's all. So if we go out super, super far,
4441.30s: notice these yellow lines which represent implied volatility and these white lines which
4446.34s: represent historic volatility. Notice how in general, the yellow line trends above the white line.
4454.74s: That means in general, implied volatility is pricing in larger moves than we actually see.
4462.42s: Now you'll notice every once in a while short term moves will absolutely exceed the implied volatility.
4469.54s: So that's why we tend to have overstated implied volatility to a degree is because of the
4475.70s: distribution of stock prices, which is not log normal. So one of the traits is in option pricing that
4484.34s: we tend to see implied volatility priced more richly than the realized moves would otherwise
4490.82s: necessitate a perfect system. Now there's a bunch of reasons why this exists, but it comes down to
4496.82s: supply and demand. That's what leads to the ultimate pricing of options is there need to be people
4501.62s: willing to transact at an agreeable price, both seller and buyer perspective. So when we're looking
4509.54s: at trends in volatility, that's one of the easiest ways to trade it. Now the other ways that I
4518.18s: like to trade volatility are through things like trading earnings. That's a great one. FOMC rate
4525.22s: statements is another really effective. Now this is all from a short volatility perspective.
4531.14s: The reason why my personal approach to trading volatility by itself more often than not is
4538.18s: predicated from the short perspective is another trait of volatility is that it tends to be mean
4544.66s: reverting. It also tends to cluster. One of those two terms mean well, mean reverting means that
4552.02s: over time it goes back to some sort of long term average to a reference period. Clustering
4558.82s: means that it tends to hover around where it's recently been until it goes through a transitory phase
4567.62s: which it will then cluster again. Craig says sounds like all of you in strategies. I mean,
4573.78s: they're just really basic volatility strategies, but yeah, absolutely. I think one of the best things
4579.62s: that you and talks about is like the risk reversal. His structure to a risk reversal is fantastic.
4584.98s: And the way that he employs the delta bands, that's I think fantastic. The risk reversal, I think
4591.54s: from a retail perspective, is really difficult to put on in a cost efficient way. But yeah, I mean,
4596.82s: the way to think about at least most of my trading is it's exceedingly basic. That's by design.
4603.06s: Right. So if I think about my strategies, they're really designed to be less intensive in something
4611.22s: that I can reliably execute over time. And it's why I've spent so much time kind of studying
4616.58s: because I do agree with, I think it was Leonardo da Vinci that said, simplicity is the ultimate
4622.98s: form of sophistication. And I think again, going to another analogy in the Marine Corps,
4628.02s: we talk about brilliance at the basics. So if you can set things up simply that take advantage
4633.22s: or that do what you want as simple as possible, there's less margin for error. And I very, very rarely
4640.98s: will trade kind of, you know, multi leg dragon spreads, which is a joke. That might be a name for
4646.82s: something who knows at this point. There are tons of weird names like Jade lizards and names
4650.90s: that pop up. But I avoid tons of legs because more often than not, they don't actually help. And by
4657.22s: taking the simplest form of a position, you gain exposure to the actual thing you're trying to trade.
4663.70s: And also, I think retail traders don't fully appreciate, I don't think they fully appreciate
4670.90s: how much friction is involved with trading. So.
4677.70s: Paul says, what are the white pink and yellow curves? The white, you mean in here? So this
4686.02s: is essentially a plot of, oh yeah, Shredje, thank you very much. That's exactly correct.
4692.02s: Much appreciated. Greg says, how do you find the time to record so many videos and study?
4696.74s: Well, as you could tell, I have a smaller YouTube channel. So I don't actually spend a bunch of
4703.06s: time doing things with the videos. Right. So my goal with the videos, I think about a topic,
4708.74s: typically something related to what I'm working on and some capacity. And then I literally just
4712.74s: shoot a video on it. And then that's it. So if I think about where I'm at in my trading career,
4720.82s: I've spent thousands of hours studying. And I still, I literally read every single day about
4726.58s: this stuff. It's what I do. It's my profession is I'm a trader. So that is the overwhelming majority
4733.78s: of what I spend my time looking at. And for me, like video production is pretty off like hands off.
4740.18s: There's not that much to it. It's actually why I'm so appreciative for the people that do sign up
4744.18s: on Patreon is because I'm now able to edit videos. And I use the proceeds from that essentially
4750.82s: to try to make better content. So yeah, Paul says, what is VRP variance risk premium? So VRP or
4761.46s: risk premium, there's different kinds of risk premium, variance risk premium specifically relates
4765.78s: to this phenomenon that I was just telling you about where implied volatility trends over historic
4771.86s: volatility. Good question. Cool. Greg says, only reason I've been kicked out because I've
4783.46s: 3% of your audience, it does not show that you read into it. No, it's because I don't care, right?
4789.86s: If you were actually bothering me, I take you out in a heartbeat. I don't really care. But
4796.26s: I also think it's important to at least try to show people like you love because it's very clear
4801.14s: that you don't get it in your life. If this is how you behave. And again, if this is your agenda for
4806.82s: a Friday night. So we try to be nice to people like you against your best wishes. Paul says,
4814.98s: you have IVs for different periods. How do you use this? It's another great question. So depending
4819.54s: on how you're structuring trades, you can look at implied volatility in different perspectives.
4827.78s: When you think about implied volatility as compared to a theoretical model like the Black
4833.86s: Shoals Martin model, volatility is not uniform. There's actually what we call a volatility surface.
4840.26s: And it's a three-dimensional view of volatility because as you go across different
4846.34s: explorations at different strike prices, they all will have different volatilities. So you can
4852.02s: trade these different relationships between volatility. It's actually really, really cool when you get
4860.50s: a deeper relationship with volatility because it's one of the more tradable asset classes. And it's
4866.90s: because it has more predictive qualities than price can have, again, depending on the time
4871.86s: frame that you're looking at. So that's essentially how you can use the various IVs. It looks like we
4882.34s: got a timeout. Craig, again, there we go. We're going to have to expand your time out this time,
4888.10s: little buddy. Off you go. So that's essentially how I use it. It allows me to trade the relationship
4895.86s: of different volatilities. That's the punchline. So that's kind of like in a nutshell of the way that I
4905.54s: trade volatility. Now a couple notes is trading volatility is kind of tricky because it's very path
4912.50s: dependent. And if you really want to gain direct exposure to volatility, you have to do things like
4918.26s: gamma hedge, which is time intensive, or you can kind of have a looser relationship with volatility
4925.46s: trade the overall themes, which is more so what I do. And that's kind of my general approach to it.
4931.62s: I also trade volatility on zero DTEs. That's the primary source of profitability for that trade.
4937.38s: And that still exists to a pretty significant degree. So going over actually this is a great
4942.58s: segue to know you how to trade options around events such as earnings or economic data releases.
4947.94s: Great question. So actually that video that I just dropped in will talk about that more in depth.
4953.46s: But let's take a look at some examples. If we look at something like Tesla.
4958.42s: And we take a look at how it behaves around earnings. This might be a slightly
4965.78s: overwhelming chart. But if you take a look, you'll notice up here, we have the underlying price
4974.42s: pre and post earnings. Then we have the implied versus historic volatility pre and post release.
4981.70s: So essentially, there are a couple really common traits with respect to option prices around
4989.22s: earnings. Starting about two weeks out, there will be an expansion in volatility, although it can
4996.26s: be masked by underlying price movements, other market factors. It's not as simple as two weeks out
5001.62s: while those up. But that is the general trait starting two weeks out into an earnings release.
5008.26s: So you can trade that volatility expansion via something like a long straddle is completely reasonable.
5016.02s: Then as you get closer to the release, there tends to be a rapid contraction of volatility post
5022.58s: release. So to capture the contraction post release, we would sell volatility via short
5028.74s: straddles, short strangles before the release. And then we would look to close it after the release,
5034.10s: after the volatility contracts. And this is a great example of that movement. So if we look at
5039.06s: implied volatility before the release, in this case, it is 72.55%. And then after the release, it drops
5046.10s: to 66.43%. So in this example, selling volatility would make money. There are examples, however,
5055.38s: where selling volatility doesn't make money. And the movement post earnings is bigger than the
5062.50s: implied move. This is an example of that. So notice how before this earnings release,
5067.14s: implied volatility was 62.91%. And historical volatility here was 58% leading into the release.
5074.82s: And then post release, they literally flip. And historical volatility jumps up to 57.77%.
5081.78s: implied down to 53%. This is where short volatility strategies would lose money.
5088.98s: It's not free money. You're taking a risk. But in general, you'll notice that in most of these
5094.02s: instances, implied volatility trends over historical volatility through the earnings release.
5101.06s: So the punchline is if you're trading earnings releases and trying to trade volatility around it,
5106.82s: it's very, very much predicated on it being a numbers game. You have to get enough cycles in
5111.30s: because you'll have instances where you lose like this right here. You would have lost as well.
5115.62s: implied volatility contracted, but realized volatility expanded more. And in this case,
5121.38s: you lose your capital. So we can take a look at this in different time frames to see essentially
5129.62s: how it behaved leading directly into the release and post release. Paul says, are those candles daily?
5136.42s: That's what the previous one was. And then this would be intraday post the release.
5142.82s: So that's kind of the nutshell about trading earnings with
5150.10s: volatility plays. You can trade things thinking about the difference between
5155.62s: straddles and strangles. Strangles are less of a pure volatility play. And they are more of
5163.22s: they have a directional component to it because the thing is if we take a look, let's use on demand.
5168.90s: Let's take a look at one of these examples. Let's look at first.
5176.50s: The last earnings release would have been a good example of a losing position. And then the one
5180.58s: before that would have been a slight win. The one before that a better win. So go back to last
5186.42s: earnings and then two earnings ago. I just have to grab the dates. So the last earnings was 23
5194.98s: April after the close. I'm just going to throw it on the chat so I can find it 23 April PM.
5201.14s: And then over here, this would have been a losing position. This one is well. Let's take a look. This
5208.98s: one was 18 oct. PM. Oops. In the wrong spot. 18 oct PM.
5225.78s: Jay says, is there such thing as good strategies for beginners to practice in paper trading?
5230.18s: Absolutely. I think in paper trading, you can start with the absolute basics. Long calls, long
5240.10s: puts, short calls, short puts. Those are all very, very reasonable initial strategies.
5248.90s: I actually just shot a new video on like introduction to options because the other one I have is
5254.82s: is kind of old, but it's not out yet. So I can give you the old one that I have here. And that goes
5262.74s: through a lot of the basic structures that you can trade. Now for me personally, the things I would
5270.18s: look at would be the coverage strangle, which is very similar to what you would hear as the wheel
5276.10s: and as some slight nuances. And then the others would be ratio diagonals. I think those are probably
5282.42s: the primary strategies that I would trade and they're mostly directional in nature. Trading
5287.54s: volatility is completely doable, but especially if you're trading a smaller account, there's a lot
5294.26s: of nuance to it that becomes difficult to manage. So what that means is in order to trade volatility
5301.06s: from a pure perspective, you don't want to trade it via iron condors or via defined risk strategies
5306.98s: because then you're buying the exact thing you're saying is overpriced. That's why we would be
5311.86s: selling volatility. So you start to sacrifice a lot of your edge perspective there because of that.
5319.62s: So I think that's essentially where I would start. Now the other thing that I think would make sense
5331.22s: if you're even interested in something simpler still, you can literally do something like ratio
5336.02s: covered calls. I would try those as well. And we can talk about a couple of those in just a second.
5344.98s: I just realized we're already at 630. So I'm going to skip going through the rest of the earnings
5349.78s: thing. It's in that video mostly that I shared up above and then I want to make sure we can get to
5354.02s: this last question. So Scott says, can you cover your analysis for entry and then sizing, strike
5359.78s: liquidity and scaling for option scalping opportunities? I was curious is your approach for I
5367.22s: for scalping utilizing optimized premium pricing for launch positions? So unfortunately, and I kind
5373.78s: of put this in the reply, I don't really scalp options that much. The reason being is again options are
5379.22s: really nefarious in that even if you have no upfront commissions, they're extremely misleading
5385.78s: because you can think it's way cheaper than it actually is. And it kind of starts to eat away
5392.58s: at your profits massively. So even when I'm trading zero DTE options, I'm not considering that
5398.50s: scalping because I'm establishing a position looking to manage it delta hedging slightly,
5403.30s: but I carry the position all the way through. I think if I were to look to scalp options, liquidity
5410.34s: would be probably the hands down most important factor because without effective liquidity, you have
5417.22s: you're you're giving up any potential as you have via friction. So when it comes to strike prices,
5424.66s: that kind of goes into this bigger question on selecting a strike, which is completely relative
5431.46s: to the strategy that you're trading. So sizing for scalping would have to be relative to the way
5439.94s: that I'm expecting the price to move because you have to be positively expectant. So if we come
5446.42s: into something like Tesla and you're trying to trade this thing intraday and let's say you're
5452.10s: using options. Well, your options are decaying as you're holding them. Let's say that you're buying
5457.22s: those options. You need the price movement to be big enough to cover the cost of slippage, which
5463.14s: is the bid-ask spread. You need to cover your theta decay depending on if it's just a day. It may
5467.94s: not be too much, but you still have to cover that cost. And you also need to overwhelm commissions.
5472.90s: So the minimum movements required have to account for all of those fees. Then if you have losing
5478.42s: positions, let's say that you're trying to go for a plus one win and a minus two loss. Well, now
5484.82s: your winning position wouldn't make sense, right? Depending on the probability because you need to be
5489.54s: able to overwhelm the losing positions. So it's very much a math in a game of math. And you just have
5497.22s: to use something like expected returns, which I have a video on. I'll grab that for you.
5512.02s: Here you go. So this video goes up or goes through expected returns and essentially how to think
5519.78s: about them. The the point being is you can't just essentially try to scalp on the system of if
5525.78s: I'm up. I'm going to get out. If I'm down, I'm going to get out or if I'm up by a percent,
5529.38s: I'm going to get out because you have to make sure that it makes sense against your fees and
5533.46s: whatever your loss management protocols are. So it's a bit of a vague answer because it's not
5538.02s: something that I typically do. But again, I think the heart and soul of that response is focusing
5543.46s: very much so on expected return. All right. That about wraps us up. So if you have any other questions
5551.06s: that you want to dive into, let me know. In the meantime, I do want to talk about this one,
5555.14s: just a little bit. This idea of buying calls that expire worthless because this happens literally
5560.02s: all of the time. So when we look at what retail traders tend to do is they want to be cheap
5571.54s: because they tend to have smaller accounts. So if we take a look at
5577.22s: options in something like Tesla, if we're closer in time, let's use like a week out,
5587.06s: and we look at something like a 30 delta, which is here, these calls are trading for
5596.58s: 233. If we go further out in time to 70 days to expiration, again, to a 30 delta,
5603.38s: these are trading for 747, something like that. So the point is the further out in time you go,
5612.82s: the more time your contract has to work in your favor, but the more expensive it is. So traders tend
5619.06s: to really run on the short term of the spectrum, which is problematic for a bunch of different
5624.50s: reasons. The answer, however, on how to think about overcoming this is by going further out in time,
5633.38s: and by going deeper in the money. You don't have to go super deep in the money. You can go
5637.94s: essentially right at the money or slightly in the money. Extrinsic value will be very high.
5642.82s: However, there's a much better probability of the underlying
5647.46s: moving in your required direction and actually increasing the overall profitability in the position
5653.30s: because your gamma would ramp pretty quick, but there's a higher outlay upfront.
5658.90s: Why not says better to scalp with shares? I think that's fair. I think the only downside to
5665.46s: that is you lose the leverage, but if you wanted to scalp, I think with shares is probably a better
5670.02s: approach. I agree with you. Rudy says, if I check on Robinhood and click on options, it gives me a
5674.58s: break even amount. Does that mean that all of those that all of those got covered, all those extra
5680.50s: costs that you were talking about? I don't know if Robinhood includes fees, but what that is
5686.98s: talking about in terms of the break even price is for different basic structures. You can calculate
5693.14s: where the break even price is at expiration, which is another really commonly misunderstood concept.
5698.82s: So for example, if we go out here to 16 August and we look at buying one of these at the money calls,
5704.50s: just for an example, and we analyze this trade.
5711.30s: Get rid of this. So notice how there's two lines in this risk profile.
5716.90s: The X-axis here represents the strike price and the underlying price is right now in the center.
5723.46s: So the X-axis here, I'm sorry, I said strike price. I didn't mean that. The underlying or the X-axis
5728.74s: here represents the underlying price. And you can look at different strike prices further out
5733.70s: in time, but the center point right here is the current price. And then the Y-axis is a PNL graph.
5738.58s: As you go up, makes money, go down, lose money. So you'll notice there's these two different lines.
5743.78s: There's purple and then there's blue. Purple represents today right now. Blue represents at
5750.66s: expiration. So notice on this 180 call, your break even price will be the strike price
5759.30s: loss. The debit you paid to open the position. And you can see that represented right here. It's at
5766.66s: 195 and change, 195 90. So that's where the break even price is at expiration. So a lot of people
5774.90s: confuse that and they think that in order to make money on this trade, the underlying has to be
5781.06s: above that. You actually start making money way earlier. Notice how this purple line shows us
5787.86s: making money as soon as it moves in our favor. Remember, the break even price is that we typically
5792.42s: refer to when we're looking at structures is relative to expiration. But you can make money
5798.98s: before expiration. And that reminds me, we didn't talk about settlement, which is really,
5804.66s: really important. I want to highlight that quickly. There are different ways you can close
5809.62s: in options contract. The most efficacious in general is simply trading the contract. So if you buy
5816.74s: call, it would be to sell the call. If you sell a put, it would be to buy the put back. You can also
5823.70s: exercise options if you're a buyer. But there are a lot of caveats to that because you give up all
5831.22s: of the extrinsic value left in the option that you're holding that you otherwise could capture by
5837.14s: selling the option or trading the option. So that's kind of just a really short fused ad. I didn't
5844.42s: want to forget that because I realized I forgot to add that earlier and I don't want to,
5848.82s: I don't want you guys to not at least have a rudimentary understanding of settlement, which
5854.10s: reminds me I need to add a placeholder for that little presentation that I give on settlement.
5861.78s: And we'll add that here. But yeah, just definitely take note that we want
5870.74s: options settlement. We typically want to trade the options. That's going to be a simpler way to
5877.78s: manage the transaction that is lower friction for you. And the other thing I'm actually surprised
5890.98s: nobody asked, maybe you guys already know, but is the multiplier. So you'll notice that when we're
5896.02s: looking at these different contracts that we're quoting this as, you know, $15.70. But you
5901.94s: notice here, it says 100. That's because the multiplier for options contracts, we would call a one lot per
5909.78s: one lot is 100 shares. So each one of these contracts represents up to 100 shares of the underlying.
5920.42s: So when we're looking at the prices, you'll see that this is quoted as $15.80 at the midpoint.
5928.26s: However, you have to multiply that by 100 to get the actual price because this is per share.
5936.10s: These move in 100 share lots. It's an important admin note on the prices that you see here.
5942.58s: Alex says just to make sure I understood, you are short,
5947.62s: vol on zero DTE and delta hedge and cash secure the difference.
5955.46s: I don't follow your question on the cash securing the difference. The way that I delta hedge,
5960.66s: because typically when I'm trading zero DTE options, I am trading the prevalence of variance
5967.06s: risk premium. And the way that I delta hedge is by moving the options, you can delta hedge more
5973.22s: purely via gamma scalping. However, once you neutralize your gamma, then you have to neutralize
5979.62s: your delta's and the easiest way to do that is through the underlying market. But SPX is typically
5985.06s: what I trade zero DTE's in. It's in index itself. It doesn't trade in any shares. So if you grab SPX,
5991.46s: notice how there's no size, there's no volume. So you would have to delta hedge with SPI,
5998.58s: which is kind of a dirty hedge, we would call it. It's not a pure hedge. So the vast majority of
6003.70s: the time when it comes to zero DTE's and something like SPX, I'm going to size the position very
6008.66s: carefully. But the way that I delta hedge is by rebalancing my delta's on the long or on the
6014.10s: short call and short put side. So slightly different. There's no real cash secure on the position.
6020.34s: It's just a margin required product because the way that SPX options are settled is via cash.
6028.58s: There are two different kinds of standard options contracts. There is American and European.
6035.22s: For American options, they can be settled or they can be exercised at any point. And European
6042.26s: options can only be exercised at expiration. But then we can also have if something is cash
6047.54s: settled or settled with the underlying. So SPX is an example of a European style option
6053.62s: where it can only be exercised at expiration and it's cash settled. There's no shares that move.
6060.90s: So if, for example, I sell an option and it's in the money and it's exercised, it just settles
6066.42s: to cash. There's no underlying that moves around. Good question though.
6071.46s: All right, gang. I got us a hot minute into this thing, but I hope this session was good for you guys.
6079.54s: If it is, please like the video. It does help the content emerge through the algorithm.
6084.90s: And I'm looking to do kind of two of these beginner oriented sessions on Fridays per month.
6091.46s: So the first and third Friday is what I'm tracking right now. So I'll look forward to
6096.66s: connecting with you guys at the next one. And in the meantime, if you have questions or anything
6100.26s: like that, feel free to reach out at any point. I aim to try to help people as best I can. So
6106.18s: have an awesome weekend. And I'll see you guys later.
