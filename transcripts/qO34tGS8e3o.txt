362.00s: you
390.00s: let
398.00s: me graph
402.00s: the tear of so far because there's a lot happening underneath the surface. So let's, I don't
409.84s: know about this stuff about musk. Ah, I see. So this looks like it just happened a little while ago.
421.36s: Yeah, so this is essentially musk saying that he hopes the US and EU will have no tears. And
427.52s: so let's take a giant step back. What's happening right now is Trump is clearly using the tariffs
436.88s: as a way to start dialogue. And it's super important to understand this. Now the way that we arrived
446.32s: at these various relationships, and if you haven't read this, you should because this document
453.28s: is really interesting because a lot of what it talks about raises a lot of questions on how are
459.60s: we even calculating what the total tariffs are because it's not just the direct tariffs. It's
464.24s: also fiscal policy that gets involved in that which starts to get kind of weird. But
469.04s: but beyond that, it seems like the broader intent here is to use tariffs as a method to start
483.20s: gaining attention. And let me show you why I have a, oh yeah, I posted it on X. Oh no, in the
492.72s: discord these. Oops, open this one.
505.20s: Open this one.
512.08s: Open this one.
513.68s: So what I'm showing you is a stream of different different tariffs as they sit right now. And the reason
532.24s: why this matters is because if we take a step back and we try to actually understand what's going
541.36s: on. It's important to try as I remind you all it's the same thing when we look at stuff like
548.72s: GameStop. It's really important to try and strip away your bias, your preference, the things that
554.88s: you want to see, the things that you would prefer to see. And we look at this in the context of what
561.04s: it is. And so far, Trump has done several things seemingly in an attempt to gain more traction
573.04s: quicker on different issues, different things that he's taken issue with in campaign done.
579.20s: Okay, I'm not going into pro or con whether the stuff is good or bad. What I'm trying to do is set
584.88s: a baseline for what the current context is and what this can look like going forward. This is
590.56s: to answer the questions that I was getting. So we have to start by understanding the context,
596.08s: though. The reason why this matters is because there are people right now that are freaking out,
604.16s: crying, all sorts of things. And they're saying, well, tariffs are terrible, tariffs are bad.
610.32s: We shouldn't do tariffs. And again, I'm not weighing on that one way or the other. But the fact
615.12s: of the matter is in a lot of these other countries, there are tariffs. So whether they're good or
620.48s: bad, we like them or we don't, there are absolutely our instances where there are not only trade
626.80s: differentials that are massive, surplus and deficits, typically slightly disadvantages to the US.
633.68s: But there's also existing tariffs in these other places and duties, not straight tariffs.
640.24s: The reason why all of this matters is because I think it partially gives some insight as to why
648.32s: we would come out with a sludge hammer where everybody thought it was going to be a scalpel.
656.64s: I was duped too to be clear. The entire stock market was duped because the way that it was
662.64s: messaged coming into this was that it was going to be way more scalpel. But coming out with a blank
668.40s: Latin 10% tariff on everything, that immediately shook everybody because that becomes like,
674.64s: whoa, shit, this is completely different than what we thought it was going to be. That matters.
679.84s: Now there's this side of the argument that is completely hinging on the trade agreements
689.68s: between countries. And that's more so how Trump looks at it. It's not so much as individual items.
695.60s: I noticed that he'll use different items for examples. But you could tell he's talking about it
700.48s: at the country level, whatever the trade disparity is there. Then there's the reshoring element of
708.32s: this, which is also a thing. And the reason why this is so important is because we have a couple
714.08s: of questions again as traders to ask ourselves now to figure out what we think may or may not
721.84s: happen because again, this is how we position ourselves. And I'll show you what I mean.
728.96s: If we have this issue, let's this issue here, we call it tariffs.
739.28s: The issue was split into two pieces. There's trade, which is our relationship with different
748.48s: countries. And then there's reshoring. These issues do not behave the same. Example,
760.32s: if one of our reshoring priorities is domestic chip production,
771.12s: if this is one of the key things that we're trying to accomplish, which has been said multiple times,
777.68s: well, what does that tell us? It tells us that even if Taiwan says, yo,
786.56s: and to be clear, I don't even know if Taiwan has current tariffs or duties on us. That
790.88s: is one country I don't know. I just know that a lot of chips are made there using it as an example.
795.12s: I am very against spreading bum scoop on shit that I don't know. So this one I don't know,
800.24s: easy to find out, but it doesn't really matter right now for this example.
804.00s: So let's say Taiwan does have duties on the US, whatever they are. And let's say Taiwan says,
810.00s: yo, we're going to take hours down to zero, right? If we, and let's just say, again, I don't know
817.28s: what the US tariff on Taiwan is, but let's say the US currently is at 10%. There's now a competing
823.52s: interest because if the US then chooses to say, well, thank you, Taiwan. I'm stoked that you guys
832.16s: will take years down to zero. But if the US takes theirs down to zero, then what happens? Then
839.20s: this incentive starts to fall away because Trump has also said he doesn't like the chips act.
845.12s: So he's also, he's using tariffs to do two things at once, which is super important to pay
851.68s: attention to. There's another element here because when we hear things like tariff revenue,
862.72s: this is a thing. This is absolutely a thing. But when we think about something like GDP,
869.12s: this isn't talked about enough, GDP, gross domestic production, gross domestic production,
880.96s: he, the D matters as I like to tell my wife. Okay, so the tariff revenue side of things in the
892.08s: beginning with all of these tariffs is going to be high at a high level, right? So if we have this
899.28s: level, this is zero tariffs, this is 100%. This is the revenue generated. It's going to be
906.80s: build up. So the amount of revenue that we're going to get from tariffs will be higher in the
913.92s: beginning. And then a lot of people are saying, well, how does this make sense then? Because Trump
921.28s: is talking about all of this tariff revenue. But if the tariffs then get negotiated down,
927.68s: then what happens to that tariff revenue? This hope, this opens a really important point that
935.60s: hopefully you're following at this point. And it's that there's a handoff. As more reshoring occurs,
945.20s: as from the original tariffs, there's a handoff. You have tariff revenue over here. And then
952.32s: this is an accurate, but we'll call it reshoring revenue.
959.84s: What happens here is as the tariff revenue starts to slow down because more stuff is built in the
968.72s: US, that means the amount of revenue we're generating from tariffs naturally decreases. But there's
975.20s: a compensatory element, which is the amount of revenue that's generated now from reshoring,
982.72s: which maybe it starts here, actually starts to increase. So you start making more money from this
991.04s: side of the equation. I am in no way suggesting it is as simple as this because it isn't. But at a high
1000.56s: level, this is a big piece of what's going on here. And the reason why this matters so much to you
1007.20s: is because the entire market right now is in a wildly dangerous place, a wildly dangerous place.
1020.48s: And because of this danger,
1022.40s: the way that this new news and any developments comes from this is going to directly affect the
1035.44s: market in a pretty big way as you've seen the last couple days. That's things like if other
1042.24s: countries start increasing their tariffs and this turns into a tariff war, that's destructive.
1047.28s: That's literally going to hurt literally everybody. And if you take a look, one of the interesting
1052.64s: things I've found so far just kind of poking through this is if we hide this so you can see,
1060.32s: you can see Israel, who funny enough is supposed to be one of our really big partners,
1067.68s: but somehow there are tariffs there for whatever duration. But then all of a sudden,
1074.80s: there's now movement. When did this happen on the 1st of April? Interesting.
1082.40s: So this is obviously people looking to make a change. So this is Israel. Next, there's Argentina.
1091.44s: Argentina is now in talks with, I don't know how you couldn't have a successful talk with sideburns
1098.00s: like this, but they're having talks right now again to attempt to get rid of this tariff picture.
1106.64s: This came out on the 1st of April. Next is Vietnam. Vietnam is trying to figure out how to decrease
1115.52s: the tariff picture. What I'm trying to highlight is right now, whether you like it or not,
1123.92s: doesn't matter. Again, try to look at it objectively because to be clear, there are plenty of
1130.16s: instances right now where I don't like the way that we're treating some of our friends, like my
1135.44s: opinion. I wish that it was more collaborative, but what I wish doesn't matter, what matters is
1143.76s: what is. So right now, as these tariffs are being launched, you can see that there are a lot of
1149.76s: instances where there are countries saying, oh, shit, this is actually happening, need to do
1156.00s: something about it. And this is why for a lot of people that were very, very curious what was going
1164.48s: on in Nike is this. A lot of shoes are built in Vietnam. So countries, I'm sorry, for companies
1176.16s: that do business in countries that are looking to reduce their tariffs and there is a
1181.12s: probability that it might happen. The shares are appreciating pretty significantly.
1186.48s: So this here is really interesting to see. And you can see that it's happening in a lot of
1195.28s: different places. It's not just happening in primary trade partners or countries that were close
1202.40s: with like Israel. It's starting to occur in other countries. So now we have a really, really
1211.28s: delicate problem in front of us. How long do the tariffs stay in place at what rate? Because if
1218.80s: the tariffs stay in place for a long time at this rate, when I say a long time, I literally mean
1223.36s: a couple months, there's going to be massive, massive damage done, massive damage done.
1229.92s: But right now it's essentially trying to negotiate through strength. Again, whether you like it or
1235.92s: not, just look at it objectively. That's what this is. The only reason why you slap on tariffs like
1240.40s: this rather than trying to come to an agreement before you put the tariffs on. This is essentially
1246.08s: showing the bite before the bark and then trying to have some sort of dialogue afterwards.
1254.56s: We do not know if this will promulgate because again, this issue that I showed you earlier,
1263.36s: I don't have a sense of this yet. I don't know.
1268.96s: But this becomes if this is weighted by Trump 51% on the scale versus trade,
1284.72s: that means that the negotiations and the discussions that you see around trade are not
1290.64s: inherently going to move the needle if we're trying to use tariffs to drive reshoring.
1297.36s: So at this point, from my lens as a trader, what I'm doing is paying hyper close attention.
1306.24s: I've been listening to stuff all day today because I, this is the kind of thing that can move
1312.48s: very quickly. So I'm trying to at least understand what's going on and to stay as close as I can
1319.84s: possibly because like you saw in the last couple days, as new information is priced in and
1328.72s: price was dislocated previously, you'll see huge opportunities, huge trading opportunities.
1336.32s: So that's effectively what I'm seeing right now with this whole
1344.96s: tariff conversation.
1349.36s: Dark Mark says any good listens. Yeah, give me one second. So
1353.84s: the anything with Scott Besent has been good. I've listened to a few. He's been on a few things
1361.20s: pretty recently. I think listening to Lutnik has been on Forbes. I try to avoid listening to
1370.00s: the commentary on either CNN or Fox, just because it's like it's too polar. But as you all know,
1379.28s: all of these new stations, every single one of them has a tilt of some sort. The only reason
1384.48s: I'm mentioning that here is it is something you should be aware of as you're listening because
1389.52s: it's going to change the kind of questions that are asked and then the answers that you get
1394.40s: and then the narrative that you walk away from. So what I do is try to listen to this information
1402.40s: through financial media because typically financial media cares a lot more about the financial
1407.44s: impact. But then I will literally go back and listen to it on CNN, Fox, just other style interviews
1416.64s: about this stuff because it's important to get some different ideas. Like for example,
1420.48s: one of the one of the things that I did not know is that and this has not been covered on the
1426.80s: right side of the equation is that there are some things from China that are essentially going to
1434.64s: have over a 70% tariff, not the whole kit, not everything from China, but some things because
1440.96s: there are some items that had a prior classification that now additive with all the rest of this stuff
1446.80s: there's more. So that was an interesting thing that I didn't catch elsewhere. And from the other
1453.28s: side of the equation, there are different elements that you can capture like some of these pieces of
1459.28s: news, these conversations that are happening. I'm not seeing a lot of that from other places.
1464.00s: I'm also not seeing a lot of the left side of the news so far talking about this relationship
1473.12s: between revenue because we're essentially just saying tariff revenues, the cost to the consumer.
1478.16s: And this is effectively all bad, which again, there are absolutely as an argument there,
1483.92s: but it's important to note that as this happened, there is there is no tariff on domestic
1488.40s: production. He's made that clear. Even with automotive's, if a car has parts from other countries,
1495.36s: but then is assembled in the US, there's no tariff on it. So like piecing together all of these
1502.72s: little details takes a lot of time and effort because you have to go to all these different
1506.72s: news sources because everybody's a fucking agenda and you can't just hear information. It's
1512.08s: super annoying. I would love to just see a list of information, but alas, we do not have that.
1519.76s: Anyways, this relationship super important to pay attention to.
1524.24s: Okay, so before we pivot away from the whole whole tariff thing, the first thing is I want to see
1530.32s: if what I just talked about connected, it doesn't make sense. Do you have follow-on questions
1535.44s: about what we just looked at? Yeah, the main things to look for going forward from here is any news
1544.56s: about tariff negotiations or tariff retaliations. If you see any of these things,
1552.08s: then you can start trading it literally. So the move that you saw in
1557.44s: Nike, easily traded, easily traded because everything right now is in a wildly, wildly
1570.00s: jacked up level. So what I mean by that is if you think of
1576.88s: maybe we'll do a pendulum. So here's the pendulum. Let's say,
1582.96s: oh, geez, I can't draw a straight line with this thing for my life. Oh, it's because I have
1589.36s: it at an angle. Hold on. That's better. So here's our pendulum. Maybe as like spikes and shit
1597.44s: on it to be cool. And let's say that our pendulum angle normally is like this.
1606.56s: What I mean by this is as we get new news, new information, the pendulum swings one way,
1612.24s: and then it swings back this other way. But maybe it stays within this general range to find here.
1619.28s: Well, right now, what you see in Nike is this. The pendulum is now going way out here
1631.60s: and way out here. And imagine this being the price of the stock.
1636.16s: So Nike obviously got smashed and sent this way on news of the tariffs. Then there is a
1647.60s: monochrome of hope. Notice that these aren't, they're not even saying the tariffs are gone.
1652.16s: They're not saying that they're in good conversation right now. They literally just said
1658.40s: we are trying to reduce the tariffs. That's effectively what they said.
1663.76s: And if you look at the movement in Nike, it's like, oh, yeah, we are back. We are back bit to
1672.96s: him, baby. And you had better belief that if these conversations don't go well or if Trump decides
1680.08s: at that point, now, you know, I understand, but I still want to reshore. Guess where Nike goes
1685.44s: back this way. So this is one of the environments where typically when I'm trading this kind of
1691.52s: this kind of stuff, it's like day trades. It's very short term durations. The overwhelming
1695.84s: majority of what I do as a trader is much longer term, not much longer than a day, much longer.
1701.12s: But typically like two to eight weeks, something like that. But right now with how wild everything is
1710.80s: and how much this pendulum is swinging, everything is really shortened up a lot for me.
1716.56s: So if you pay attention to those things, there can be really cool trade ideas, which is
1723.84s: really easy to do. All right. There was a couple of things I saw pop in.
1729.68s: Dark Jen says, but how long does it take for companies to reshore? How much reshore
1733.76s: does a company have to do before they are exempt? How long is reshoreing take if it's going to
1737.76s: take four years, wouldn't it? Where's the rest of your thing? Make more sense just to wait for
1742.40s: the next administration. It's a great question. And that's actually something we talked about the
1746.64s: past week is we don't know how different organizations and different companies are thinking about it
1751.20s: yet. Because the reality is that's exactly correct. However, there's likely going to be different
1756.88s: incentives for different places to reshore. There's a there's again, the ability to look at stuff
1765.20s: objectively is super important. And let me ask you a question. When you think about COVID,
1771.92s: what kind of what kind of thought do you have about COVID? Like do you think that it was a good
1776.32s: thing? Do you think it was a bad thing? What's the general sentiment you have towards COVID?
1782.00s: Because the vast majority of people will say COVID was bad. COVID sucked. A lot of people died.
1790.40s: Both my grandparents on my mom's side died of COVID. So from that lens sucked. Not ideal.
1798.96s: There's still good stuff that came out of COVID. COVID was useful. One of the things COVID identified
1806.48s: is that right now America is overly dependent on people that we don't necessarily have the best
1813.76s: total relationship with some of which are our direct competitors. And if there is some sort of
1818.72s: conflict escalation, having really important things like medicine, chips, technology, built,
1825.68s: or largely built by these competitors is fucking dangerous. That's the reality. And that's something
1833.84s: that we got too comfortable with with respect to just globalization and trying to become overly
1843.44s: efficient because there's a relationship. There's a relationship between robustness again back to our
1855.20s: teeter totter that's apparently not connected. There we go. I got like a little ball on there.
1861.52s: So we have robustness
1867.52s: efficient.
1869.12s: When we talk about globalization, this is what we are focusing on efficiency. We're essentially
1878.72s: saying Taiwan for an example, they've built the infrastructure. They have the expertise. They have
1885.68s: the facilities. It is so much more efficient for Taiwan to build chips in Taiwan. But guess what?
1892.80s: During COVID, what happened? We noticed a egregious lack of robustness because so much stuff that
1903.76s: we use now depends on chips and we couldn't get them. So from COVID, we learned that for something like
1914.64s: chips, we need to sacrifice some of this efficiency in order to prioritize a little bit more robustness.
1925.68s: Now, like most things, this is not binary. This does not mean that you can't be purely robust or
1933.68s: you have to be purely robust or purely efficient. It's not that at all. But what it does mean is
1939.36s: that there has to be some production changes in order to strike a balance here. So this is
1944.96s: relative to chips. This will happen across the board. So going back to dark Jen's point is how long
1952.56s: does it take? It depends entirely on the company. There are a lot of like think of auto manufacturing.
1959.20s: Auto manufacturing, they literally need to come back in dust off a bunch of these plants,
1963.84s: rehab them a bit and they can easily get back online. If we're talking about chips, where you have
1973.84s: to build literally state-of-the-art facilities within sane tolerances in order to produce what you're
1981.84s: supposed to produce, that's going to take longer. But that's also why the incentive structure will
1986.24s: probably be different for them. So that's it really is industry and company dependent. And it's
1993.28s: a really important thing to pay attention to because again, going back to the trader's lens.
1998.40s: You'll notice I do this all the time. When we're talking about broader concepts like this,
2002.56s: my brain always goes back, where's the tradable part of this? Is there a tradable part of this?
2007.20s: How can this inform trading? And there is an informative function here. Because what would you think
2013.52s: about the probable performance of chip companies in the near term, even if they do agree to reshore?
2022.48s: We already know it's going to take a long time for them to do it. So unless the incentives are
2027.92s: maintained, which I imagine they would be, literally from a global security perspective,
2032.64s: they're probably going to struggle. So you can come up with different ideas like this. Again,
2037.12s: automotive manufacturers. Right now, you can start doing pairs trades and think about long,
2042.32s: domestic producers, short, non-domestic producers. There's even non-domestic producers that are
2048.24s: looking to build plants here or to begin manufacturing here, piggybacking off of existing plants
2053.44s: to avoid the tariffs. So all of that means it really takes taking the time to do a pretty thorough
2061.44s: analysis of the exact industry you're looking at to see how long does it take and what is the existing
2068.00s: incentive structure there and doesn't make sense for them to reshore. But I think for a lot of
2072.80s: these places, there's actually probably going to be pretty steady pressure on reshoring. And the
2079.44s: other thing is how much reshoring does a company have to do before they are exempt? It's really about
2083.44s: domestic production. So like again, for automotive, for example, they can use parts from other countries.
2090.64s: But if the car is put together and actually built and produced here, then that would be exempt.
2096.96s: So it's also industry specific. Like most things, unfortunately, there's not a simple blanket answer
2102.88s: for all of it. Bull says, anyone who know of a community working to track details like China,
2112.64s: Band, Rare, Metals, Export to USA read on that, but want to dig in and confirm hard to know it's
2117.12s: accurate. I mean, I don't know a ton of that myself. I guess it would depend on, I mean, I would
2126.00s: just do general research personally. I mean, we could take a look at it if you want.
2133.12s: We'll such as narrator. This is when Eric started his objective news channel. That's the last
2137.84s: fucking thing I want to do. In order to find objective information, it takes such an obnoxious
2144.48s: amount of effort. You just want to like punch everybody in the face and be like, just say what it is,
2150.96s: leave everything else out. I don't give a flying fuck about your opinion. I don't care about you.
2157.12s: I just want to know the information that you have access to that I don't, but maybe that could be
2163.04s: a cool media company name like Fuck Me Media or we'll think on it.
2174.08s: Bull says supply chain disruption on tariff events and how they impacted local manufacturing
2178.48s: ability to redesign, redressource, combat drop in sales volume due to price impact and
2182.32s: current buyers seems to be misprice in the short term. Again, it's really hard. I think to call it
2190.48s: misprice. Oh, I like that one. Lauren. That's way better. Shut the fuck up media. It's kind of
2195.36s: like shut the fuck up Fridays. But I mean, that would be so sick if there was just
2200.80s: just straight information. Trump did blank. Leave everything else out. Pelosi did blank. Leave
2207.28s: everything else out. Just say whatever it is because I mean, the sensational side piece will always be
2212.72s: there. But again, anytime I see stuff like this, I don't blame the media. I really don't. I blame us.
2219.92s: Us on the consumer side is exactly what causes all of this. If we as consumers stopped watching Fox,
2228.48s: stopped watching CNN, guess what? They would have no views. They would have no ad revenue. They
2233.84s: would have no business. They would fucking die. They would weather and die slow deaths. But no.
2239.52s: Because apparently, especially if you are a older, slightly older, the middle-aged white man,
2245.84s: apparently Fox has some sort of kinetic force on you and all of a sudden you can't not watch it,
2253.36s: then it continues the cycle. So yeah, it's and I think it just requires such an amount of effort
2263.60s: from the consumer standpoint. And that's the quote, that's one of my favorite things about
2268.64s: financial markets. I've said that a few times, but it is the absolute truth. The fact that markets
2273.68s: care about money, what's moving and what's the impact? That's always pretty nice.
2280.88s: But yeah, back to bulls, I think that's also going to be really industry-specific what you're
2290.08s: highlighting. But yeah, I think the misprice in common is difficult. I don't know how you,
2294.72s: I don't know how you price it. How do you price it? I definitely would be open to learning about it.
2300.96s: I mean, I can think of obviously a bunch of conceptual ways to price it, but my broader point is
2306.08s: to accurately price it is a straight crapshoot.
2313.52s: Is that Benian or Benian? That's a hell of a name. Benian, what do you think of the VIX
2318.80s: closing at 45? Did not see that happens since 2020. Should we expect way more downside?
2324.40s: Not inherently. So the cool part when VIX is here is that there's a ton of trades that you can do
2331.68s: with VIX at these levels. The VIX, again, doesn't tell us downside or upside. The VIX tells us one key
2342.24s: thing, uncertainty. That's what VIX is, uncertainty. And right now,
2351.84s: this is the funniest thing is last week, everybody was saying, oh, we just need the tariffs to come
2360.08s: out so that we know what's going on. And the argument that I made last week during multiple
2366.48s: live streams is that when this shit comes out, everybody's going to lose their fucking minds.
2370.96s: And then there might be a little bit of known in terms of the tariffs are turned on.
2375.52s: But now everybody's questioning a million other things. How long are they on? How
2380.40s: receptive to negotiations are we like all of these other things? It's hilarious to me.
2385.52s: So what you're seeing here is exactly that. You're seeing the market being hyper uncertain. Now
2390.08s: there is one thing I'm pretty confident here. If Trump came out with the tariffs and the tariffs
2394.64s: came in more in line with general expectations across the board, not a 10% tariff across everybody.
2400.40s: You wouldn't likely have seen this move. It would have been very unlikely to see that move.
2404.96s: But the reason why you see this kind of massive run is because the tariffs came out heavier,
2412.24s: way heavier than expected. So that led to the near term price dislocation that we talked about
2417.52s: last week. As that near term price dislocation is rapidly being priced in during a volatile
2422.56s: environment, you're going to see things expand, right? It's the rubber band thing. And when things
2427.28s: start to get super far out of whack like they were, expectations positioning versus what happened,
2432.32s: that move gets magnified. So I don't inherently think that there's going to be, you know,
2440.40s: plummeting downside just because of this. Now again, to give you Eric's opinion,
2445.60s: I do think there's likely more downside because the positioning for larger entities takes time,
2452.00s: as I've mentioned. And the overall move has been pretty quick and severe, but it would not surprise
2459.84s: me if it's not done. It's probably going to take a little bit more time. Take a look at the move
2465.52s: on Friday. It was a 3.6 standard deviation move. Huge, absolutely huge standard deviation.
2476.56s: Joseph says, I heard from a financial professional impossible to price uncertainty.
2483.92s: Yeah, I actually think that's a really dumb statement, to be honest with you.
2487.44s: Like the stock market is really good, typically at pricing uncertainty, right? Like a lot of what
2494.00s: the stock market does is price uncertainty. And that's through things like volatility. In volatility,
2500.08s: we know a lot of the standard behaviors of volatility. So yeah, I actually don't agree with that
2506.00s: at all. I think it's difficult to price uncertainty. And I think you're not always going to get it
2510.96s: right. That's for sure. But I think that the sentiment of not being able to price uncertainty,
2519.76s: honestly, is just kind of silly. The market does it all the time. That's what the market,
2523.84s: that's one of the primary things that the market does do. It's just that when there's a lot of
2527.76s: uncertainty and then there's a dislocation, it gets a ton of press. It's like the same thing you
2532.32s: saw with all the airplane crashes, which you don't pray for me because I'm flying soon. So hopefully,
2538.56s: we have a successful series of flights. But the main thing is we become hyper focused on these
2549.04s: plane crashes. And it leads everybody to believe that there's plane crashes happening all over
2552.88s: the place all the time. Everybody's dying in these plane crashes. And then if you actually look
2555.92s: at the statistics, it's really not that bad. Still sucks. And every single one of them really is
2561.28s: terrible, right? You don't want to see it. But it's still not really that severe given the number
2566.32s: of flight hours that's occurring. So it's kind of like the same thing as that. Yeah, I don't
2570.96s: I don't really buy the I don't really buy not being able to price uncertainty. I think the market
2577.28s: does actually a really good job at it. I just think when it's wrong is often during really high
2583.12s: impact environments like we're seeing now, probably a big part of it.
2586.88s: Dark Gents is another point of discussion is that even if reshoring happens, assuming other
2593.68s: the costs are fixed by virtue, having more expensive labor in the US versus a third country,
2598.88s: then wouldn't margins just by default increase in earnings go down not inherently. No, not inherently.
2604.72s: It depends on the company and it depends on how they're structured. It depends on what they do.
2608.80s: I absolutely would expect cost in general to go up. But it doesn't inherently mean that
2616.00s: margins have to contract and that revenue is going to go to shit. The reason for that is because
2621.68s: there are massive efficiencies gained when, for example, components are near production.
2628.56s: There are efficiencies there. And if the infrastructure is built successfully, especially with
2634.32s: all of the automation and what not that's coming, that's one of the coolest things actually
2639.12s: is that the amount of automation that's coming and how it can be powered by artificial intelligence
2646.16s: it's likely going to lead into a mini industrial revolution. And it's because, yeah, labor in China
2653.28s: is cheap. Labor in China is so cheap that they have to put fucking nets around the buildings to
2660.16s: prevent people from committing fucking suicide. That's crazy. So because of shit like that,
2668.80s: it's super cheap. But even with it that cheap there, with the just wild advancement of technology
2679.44s: and production, it'll be even cheaper than that, even for stuff that's produced domestically.
2684.96s: It just takes a little time to come online. So yeah, I think one of the things that you know
2691.20s: with certainty is any sort of short term theme that's going on is there's definitely going to be
2698.64s: a negative short term impact. There's no avoiding that. That is for sure. But beyond the short term
2703.60s: impact, how it bears out in the moderate term, that's a little more open ended, I think.
2712.64s: I have no idea how to say that name. Joshua? Jay? No, it's because there's no H.
2718.64s: Rodríguez, so Hispanic.
2724.16s: Hozui, how the fuck do you say that? Somebody phonetically hook me up here. How do you say that?
2731.84s: John? Oh,
2736.32s: Hozui? Wait, is it Jose or Hozui?
2744.48s: Hey, H hooked it up with the phonetics.
2754.16s: Yeah, you just said your name again that didn't help me.
2759.68s: Dark Jens says, yeah, that's true of production shifts towards more efficient
2762.48s: centric focus, more automation. Yeah, and that's exactly what's going to happen.
2766.08s: The other thing is I have to be honest with you. The fact that people are sitting here freaking out
2770.72s: about trying to and the disruption that it causes to move companies like Apple, more to domestic
2777.84s: production, I really lament the fact that Americans are so coddled. They're so entitled and so
2788.56s: sheltered that we prioritize being able to buy an iPhone for $2,000, I don't even know what
2796.32s: to cost. $2,000 versus $3,500 bucks. And because we care so much about that,
2803.92s: we really fail to appreciate the human side of this. And what again, like the human element of
2812.16s: what's going on there with the actual people building these fucking phones. So that's a complete
2821.60s: opinion piece. Anyways, I'm just clearing out some of these tabs so I can see what the hell we're
2831.84s: doing. Um, James says, I get that tariffs are causing big big spike, but how much is powel
2841.60s: driving this? Isn't that a big big spike in August his? One of the things to remember is that
2847.84s: again, just just to remind everybody like discrete attachments is a fool's errand. I really would
2855.36s: get out of the habit of doing that immediately because like saying that this big spike is from
2864.16s: tariffs and saying that the August spike is from powel. I don't think you can attribute it that way.
2870.72s: Now I understand your point fully by the way that we're trying to assign at least a dominant
2877.92s: cause. And I think it's okay to do that. But I just think it's very common for people to then
2884.48s: habitually try and come up with the, you know, news article headline on why this happened.
2891.84s: Even what you're seeing now, again, like if it was the tariffs and it was just the tariffs,
2897.04s: then I would have expected to see more of the big spike on the third.
2901.92s: Why did it happen on the fourth? The tariffs were generally launched on the third. We knew all
2907.12s: the second. So we knew on the third what it was. So there's a little more to it than that.
2914.16s: So it's just important to always remember that. Now again, tariffs, primary driver here completely
2918.56s: agree. Now in terms of powel, I don't really see how powel I would be interested in your
2925.04s: perspective on how you tie powel to this in what way. Cause I mean realistically, powel doesn't
2932.40s: have a dog in this current fight with respect to what tariffs are and the immediate fiscal
2941.44s: response from the Fed on tariffs. I guess I should say policy response, not fiscal response out,
2947.28s: right? So yeah, I'm curious what the, what the perspective is there because I think powel is
2957.12s: done so far, literally exactly what I would expect them to. I think when we look at the market
2965.84s: movement right now, it's not just the impact of tariffs, I don't think. I think that you're also
2974.48s: seeing a lot of people trying to discount into the future, what this can turn into, which we don't
2982.72s: know. And I think that's a big part of what's going on here. If you'll recall last week during
2990.32s: a couple of the live streams, I mentioned actually pretty carefully that we could see record amounts
3000.64s: of money coming out of the market and moving into different money funds, so for funds,
3009.04s: just really short term cash. And I told you exactly why that was happening. That's one of those
3013.92s: instances that there is a pretty clear reason is to what's happening. And the reason was there was
3020.32s: a lot of people that were unsure what was going to happen to what magnitude. So then they moved cash.
3027.68s: They moved to cash to wait and see because they, there's no sense in being a hero there and taking
3034.72s: on the risk and hoping shit works out. So because of that kind of behavior, I think a lot of what
3041.76s: you're seeing here is also defensive positioning. And the tariff side of stuff isn't, I mean, that's
3050.88s: part of this equation. We haven't even mentioned the word recession. Haven't even mentioned it yet.
3058.64s: But that is another thing that is looming. The current rate environment is still a thing.
3064.72s: The current inflation coming into this is still a thing. So there is a lot going on in addition to
3071.52s: just the tariffs that really exacerbates and compounds a lot of the broader dialogue that we're
3078.96s: looking at here. It becomes really, really difficult to successfully price this and then to position
3089.84s: appropriately. Now, a lot of people have been talking about like, is this the next loss decade and
3095.52s: stuff like that? To which, on my, my opinion on that is I, I just don't see it. And it's because
3105.28s: the amount of technology that's going to be launching and especially if there's a really strong
3111.60s: driver for faster adoption, I think that starts to become incredibly powerful. So
3123.28s: so yeah, anyways, James, the synopsis of all that is I don't think that you can directly
3129.20s: attribute any of this to any one thing, especially Powell. I think Powell is part of this.
3136.32s: But Powell has been one of, if not the most consistent in messaging that I could think of,
3145.20s: to be honest, it has been, he's been so consistent in his messaging, which is absolutely worth
3151.60s: noting because that helps the market tremendously because again, the market does struggle when things
3158.72s: are uncertain. But right now, we can see elements of what we call certainty, but we can absolutely see
3167.52s: elements of just consistency and his policy coming through. So I got to pop the door for Thor and grab
3173.36s: another cell to repair back.
3248.64s: I had to grab a couple apples slices.
3271.68s: Defence instinct says you think it's possible to get a black Monday. I wouldn't call that
3281.28s: probable. Could it happen? Yeah. But is like what I consider that probable not so much?
3289.28s: I think when we look at like that kind of broad move and like what the driver was for it,
3295.28s: I think so much of the information is already being baked in. A lot of the positioning is done.
3305.44s: Not all of it. And there's going to be like this, right? Take a look at consumer discretionary.
3315.76s: Let's take a look at DHI, for example.
3325.04s: Why? Why were they up Friday? The rest of the market was down like 6%.
3335.28s: Yet here, these guys are up four and a half. Why happen? Well, let's take a look.
3347.76s: I'm actually curious what these guys say.
3355.12s: The airlines definitely are going to struggle. The thing to remember about airlines is that they're
3367.20s: pretty narrow margins, naturally. I don't even see where DHI was mentioned.
3385.44s: Hmm. Here we go.
3396.80s: I'm actually kind of interesting here. What is going on here? Give me a second.
3415.04s: The interesting thing here is I don't know. It's got to be something with their supply chain.
3424.32s: I'm just not sure what element throws out the door.
3436.96s: It's close to his dinner time, so he thought I was feeding him, but I wasn't.
3439.84s: Ah. So, terrific exemptions on Canadian and Mexican lumber. That's it.
3447.04s: Makes sense. And then obviously the yield side of the equation. But again, you could
3452.16s: typically tell that there's generally a reason, right? So in this case, the reason is actually
3456.16s: pretty easy to see. It obviously has to do with the not additional tariffs going on lumber and whatnot.
3464.00s: I don't know.
3468.00s: Dark Jen says, with the rapid increase of VIX suggests that the market was not sufficiently
3472.24s: hedged, the rapid downside perhaps could lead to margin calls coming Monday, but I don't have
3476.64s: sufficient knowledge. Well, I think I think a few things related to that. It's really difficult
3485.44s: to say like what is sufficiently hedged, right? But because there was so much lead in coming to
3492.48s: this, again, I already talked about the ETF flows and the massive outflows that we saw just
3500.40s: across the board. So I mean, could we argue that there was some sort of change in terms of total
3511.12s: investment picture? Yeah, definitely. I think that that's pretty fair to at least costulate. But
3518.96s: one of the things that causes really broad market friction is when, like for example,
3524.96s: margin calls might happen, but if they're occurring across the board and there's a lot of them,
3531.28s: and they're all coalescing together, right? Like that's where it becomes really difficult. But
3536.88s: there wasn't really a massive surprise here in the sense of like the market knew something was
3541.36s: coming up. The market knew. And they we obviously didn't know what it was going to look like and how
3547.52s: bad it was going to be in that kind of stuff. But it's not like everybody went into that just,
3552.48s: hoping everything was okay. I mean, if you did, that's just probably a retail trader mistake.
3557.60s: Because going into the event, I had long straddles just playing the volatility. And then I also,
3564.72s: you all have seen the coverage strangle allocations that I've had coming into this. It's been
3569.44s: 30% or less of an equity position in them. And it's again for this exact kind of shit.
3576.08s: So I think a lot of the market probably had an idea that something was going on. Now,
3582.56s: this does lead to an interesting question though that we can speculate, which is if we take a look,
3589.36s: let's take a look at options, behavior leading into the second. And we can answer this actually a
3595.36s: little bit. So here's the second. Let's look at the prior week. So we'll do March 24th.
3606.00s: And we'll go into, no, I don't want to go into the second. So why would I click it again? You
3611.20s: idiot. I was about to click it a third time. And let's see. So this is looking at the VIX. And then
3619.12s: we'll take a look at SP or spy probably after this versus SP. Let's see.
3627.68s: But that's like dead center. Don't know. Also like dead center. Don't know.
3635.44s: This is closer to the offer. So this is probably buying.
3638.40s: Pretty close to the center. Tough to tell. But this is probably buying. Interesting. Let's take a look
3657.92s: first, I guess at a broad angle.
3668.96s: So here's the second. Yeah, I mean, the options activity, you can definitely see
3681.04s: an element of call buying, but it's really not that strong. You can definitely see the call buying
3686.40s: pickup here leading into the second. So the market definitely was picking up on elements of that.
3693.20s: Because that's a pretty big change. But this is just looking at an individual company.
3699.44s: So let's take a look at VIX now. And let's see what VIX was seeing.
3708.64s: Yeah. The market had an idea. Sneaky suspicion.
3716.40s: Take a look at that. Huge. Absolutely huge.
3727.84s: The let's go back further. I'm actually curious when even the closest reference day might have been.
3735.12s: Yeah, man. Literally for the last month, there is nothing even close. Take a look at the VIX
3743.12s: activity. These are just buying calls. These are people expecting a spike with certainty.
3747.76s: So I actually would think that the market seemed to be pretty well positioned for it. I would say that.
3758.24s: Manscapes says is black money even possible with circuit breakers? Well, no, not the same move at all.
3766.24s: But I mean, the what is it? 20% down that's still pretty significant. And when the market is
3776.00s: lock limit like that, a lot of times the future is still trade. So you'll actually see a lot of
3782.00s: a lot of that. So yeah, I mean, I wouldn't look the same. That's for sure. But again, the other
3789.44s: thing I remember is just the conditions of black Monday. They were obviously just anonymously unique
3795.20s: compared to what we've seen. Now I always remind you that the worst days are ahead of us.
3800.48s: It's just important to have that mindset. You don't have the mindset of the worst days are ahead of
3804.16s: you. Then you step into a pretty precarious position worth avoiding, I would say.
3815.12s: I'm making sure I'm all caught up on the chat. It is. Rudebegis says VIX should drop relatively
3820.80s: quickly, right? Puts are crazy expensive, not inherently. So VIX can cluster. And that's one of
3827.12s: the key properties of VIX is that it does cluster. Now how long it clusters is another question.
3834.64s: But for example, let's go back. I have to open this up a bit more. Let's do this be enough.
3846.24s: Just enough. Let's go a little further.
3851.28s: So let's just do some eyeball in here. So periods where VIX touched above 25 here. That was nine days,
3876.00s: two days, two, six days.
3892.32s: And then we need to go back. Back in time. Where's the year mark? That would be really nice to see.
3905.76s: I mean, I guess I can deduce. Pretty sure this is 2020.
3912.88s: So let's see. Look at 25.
3917.68s: Across above 25 here.
3923.20s: And it didn't go below it until and here really. Let's call it here.
3929.52s: So that's 163 days. So the point is VIX can remain elevated. It is entirely dependent on the
3946.56s: actual market condition and what's going on. But one of the things to remember is that volatility
3954.48s: does cluster. And when it clusters, that means it can stay in a specific range again,
3960.96s: typically for a list of reasons. A lot of it has to do with expanding uncertainty. So yeah.
3978.00s: Lauren says, what do you think about Jimmy going up 11? Yeah, stick a look at GameStop now.
3982.56s: I want to make sure we have a little time to talk about what's popping here.
3987.60s: So for GameStop, it had obviously a really interesting move and it looked to be for a few reasons.
3999.52s: So first thing. And again, you guys probably know some of these reasons better than me, to be honest.
4007.28s: But we know that Owen, I'm trying to find the thing. We know that Cohen bot shares.
4022.72s: Ryan Cohen, which is important by the way. Here.
4036.48s: Oh, interesting. There's new news on this.
4045.76s: So it looks like he moved 22.3 million shares into a Schwab account.
4055.28s: Interesting. This is also a really funny comment that I've seen people saying in different ways.
4062.16s: Because Buffy sitting on 300 million is like as a percentage of really small amount.
4070.48s: People are making it like, oh, this is why it all makes sense. Buffy is so prescient
4075.92s: because he's been sitting on so much cash because you knew something bad was going to happen.
4079.76s: This is not smirching Buffy at all. He's super smart. But the reason why he's sitting on so much
4084.32s: fucking cash is that he has a hard time using it. He's talked about that. And if you look at like,
4089.52s: it's not like Buffy was sitting in 40% cash in Berkshire. This is still a small amount of cash
4096.96s: relative to the total size of Berkshire. So people, this is an artifact of people's simple brain.
4106.72s: And it's that they see a big number. And I'm not saying Ryan Cohen is simple. He's doing this
4112.24s: just kind of, you know, doing his standard bit. But I've seen other people saying this. That's why I'm
4116.00s: talking about it. We see 300 billion and everybody thinks like, oh, my God, like that's just an
4122.16s: insane amount of money to be holding in cash. But as soon as you put it into context, I've like the
4125.68s: size of the portfolio really isn't much. So and let me not leave you without at least an answer
4132.48s: there. So Berkshire,
4138.08s: Pathaway current value.
4150.16s: Well, I guess I'll just do the math. I just got three different answers, which made me mad.
4163.12s: Wait, what are his current holdings actually? All right, holdings because I know he unwound some
4170.32s: of his apple, apple position. Let's see.
4183.20s: So first things first, this is saying that he's sitting on 267 trillion dollars.
4189.28s: And we're saying he has 300 billion.
4196.08s: So let's see.
4202.88s: Let's see where we're at. So that's 300 million.
4210.40s: 1000.
4212.08s: What's your guess? What's the percentage of cash that he has right now?
4219.12s: And he guesses big numbers. Big numbers are kind of fun to guess in this way. This is saying 267 trillion dollars.
4234.00s: Well, I'm sorry, 267 billion. What am I saying? Hold on, I am super confused. I just got
4258.48s: myself all in a tizzy because this now doesn't make sense.
4265.20s: Is he in way more cash than I thought?
4279.12s: Hold up.
4280.96s: So this is saying 260. Hold on.
4290.16s: Yeah, let's now we do it to fact check this because this got me fucked up.
4298.08s: So the holdings is of 31 ds 24, which I think is a little too late.
4303.76s: Okay, so the Berkshire market capitalization is 1.064 trillion.
4320.24s: This seemed way too small.
4327.28s: What is this portfolio currently worth? I'm using another website to...
4330.72s: This says 267 billion as well.
4341.44s: I'm so confused.
4342.96s: This says 255 billion.
4365.68s: 255 billion on 334 billion.
4369.20s: And then 1 trillion is the market cap?
4376.08s: Is this just his basis?
4387.12s: What is this?
4388.48s: How much money does this fucking guy have?
4391.92s: How much money you got?
4395.68s: Let's see what this says.
4398.64s: Although Berkshire's stockway, half the way stock portfolio, 288 billion.
4406.56s: So what's the total market cap?
4412.24s: Total value.
4414.96s: 1.07 trillion. Yo, I'm getting fucking grumpy with these.
4419.92s: Because I definitely think it's over trillion dollars.
4423.68s: I know it's not just hundreds of billions.
4425.60s: That's fucking peanuts for him.
4430.56s: And this is 334, 2.
4439.44s: So let's just do it on this really quick out of curiosity.
4443.04s: Yeah, 31, 31% cash.
4446.56s: So using the 1.06 trillion from here,
4452.56s: that shows him 30% cash.
4455.68s: So if you think about that even in context,
4460.00s: like 30% cash is heavy for a fund,
4463.60s: but it's not like he's sitting again, like I said,
4466.24s: like 40% plus and cash.
4468.48s: 40% is when you're really guarding money,
4471.84s: that objectively,
4476.00s: when you're looking at a fund this size,
4479.52s: that's trying to put on positions.
4480.80s: Because again, take a look at the size of the positions.
4482.80s: This is the difficulty and I've mentioned this before.
4485.52s: Here, we literally have a 5.2 billion dollar position in DVA.
4492.40s: And it's 2.1%.
4495.44s: It's difficult enough to find the liquidity to put on a 5.2 billion dollar position.
4500.32s: And it's only making up 2.1% of the portfolio.
4503.04s: That's a bit challenging.
4505.12s: So that's one of the main reasons why you'll see
4508.96s: Berkshire sitting on a lot of cash.
4511.20s: It's literally hard to use the cash.
4514.72s: Now, going back to the behavior, though, in GameStop,
4518.80s: I think a big thing that you see here is the fact that Cohen had bought in.
4524.80s: The other thing that was going on here is that there was more news
4530.00s: about Trump's discussing of Bitcoin and his use of it.
4537.92s: This is going back a little ways.
4539.92s: And Friday was actually one of the first periods that we saw Bitcoin serving as an alternative asset
4547.04s: for the broader market.
4548.24s: So if we take a look at Bitcoin, which now GameStop is discussed,
4552.16s: building a position.
4552.96s: And so now that's relevant.
4555.52s: So you can see Bitcoin actually had a little bit of a positive day on Friday when the rest of
4561.20s: the stuff was going down pretty heavy.
4562.72s: And again, it's showing a slightly different behavior and relationship.
4566.32s: So when I look at GameStop, it's still in this really, really, really
4574.08s: broad decline.
4575.52s: And this is the first sign that we've really gotten
4580.80s: about approaching a potential bottom, the fact that we had a low posted here, a low posted here.
4586.32s: And then it's kind of still rallying sideways against this 20 and a half handle.
4591.04s: So the pricing of GameStop right now is actually not too bad, I don't think.
4595.84s: Now, funny enough, this is another ticker that I might do the thing that I was explaining to you all
4606.24s: on yesterday.
4608.80s: I think it was yesterday we're talking about it, which is moving between equity and option position
4615.52s: because right now I have 41% invested for the coverage triangle in GameStop at a basis of 2575.
4625.36s: So the open P&L on that is not bad.
4628.88s: What is that $900 loss with GameStop at $23.49?
4633.44s: So it's about a $900 loss that's sitting on the open stock.
4637.36s: Let me show you the existing position so that you can follow along with me.
4645.12s: Here.
4667.36s: Maybe it's easier if I just look at this one.
4676.08s: There we go.
4678.24s: So right now, this is what the GameStop position looks like.
4683.60s: We're short three of the 26 strikes in 16 May.
4687.20s: We have two short calls at the 29 in 16 May.
4690.88s: And we have this 400 shares at 2575.
4694.56s: So right now, there's a thing that I'm looking at doing, which allows me to take the shares off
4700.40s: and move back into a short put position.
4703.20s: And again, to recap what that looks like, I will show you here because it's actually kind of an
4708.56s: important maneuver for me. It's one of the primary ways that I can navigate changing markets like this.
4724.24s: And then we have the current price here.
4744.32s: And then we can reflect the current P&L here.
4748.88s: $905.
4760.88s: And the other thing that we care about
4766.24s: is what the current value of the position is.
4778.64s: Which is now 93.
4785.04s: 96.
4786.00s: So here's likely what I will end up doing.
4788.32s: It kind of depends again.
4789.44s: I'm the reason why I haven't done it yet is because again, I'll be moving around a little bit.
4794.16s: So I'm not going to be on top of the market quite as much.
4802.48s: But what I will do is I'm going to move this out of the way for now.
4805.76s: And I'm going to look for opportunities to probably move it back into an options position.
4812.48s: So using around 93.
4814.72s: 96.
4816.08s: So here it will look something like this.
4818.72s: So we have expiration.
4820.16s: We have strike.
4821.36s: We have premium.
4823.52s: We have lot size.
4828.72s: So let's take a look at the 16 May.
4831.44s: Strike will start with something like the 22.
4835.60s: Maybe the 23.
4837.12s: So the 23, the premium on those is 240.
4845.04s: Five-ish.
4847.84s: And let's take a look at like a four lot.
4850.72s: And I'll show you what's going on here.
4855.68s: This will be cost.
4859.36s: And then cash secured amount.
4867.12s: This will be premium.
4870.56s: All right.
4872.88s: So what we do is we have this premium times the lot size times one Hyundai.
4883.52s: So we're going to make 980 bucks here.
4886.80s: And the total to cash secure this position equals.
4893.04s: Strike price times lots.
4902.08s: Times 100.
4904.08s: 92 hundred bucks.
4905.92s: So this becomes a bit of a no-brainer for me.
4909.60s: So effectively what I would do is this.
4913.04s: If I sell to close these shares.
4916.24s: At a loss.
4917.04s: I would take it down and I would book a $905 losing position.
4921.76s: And then if I move out to the 16 May 23 strike,
4924.96s: I get $2.45.
4926.64s: I do a four lot.
4928.32s: The total premium utilized here now is 900.
4932.24s: I'm going to get 980 bucks, which covers the cost of this loss.
4937.28s: And then the overall position is now going to be an improved basis of 23.
4941.60s: That's if I'm assigned.
4943.76s: If I'm not assigned, then I just keep this premium.
4946.80s: If the underlying starts going up and I'm concerned about missing out,
4950.72s: I have two different courses of action I can follow.
4953.20s: The first one is either just simply rebuy the stock.
4955.60s: I generally will set an alert to do that.
4958.80s: The second thing is just by calls.
4961.12s: Now the whole purpose for this maneuver is because when you buy shares,
4964.64s: your basis is fixed.
4965.84s: It is what it is.
4967.04s: But when you're in options, I can do things like roll the short puts.
4971.60s: So that if GameStop does unfortunately continue some sort of downward move,
4975.68s: I have places I can go.
4977.44s: I have things I can do.
4978.80s: Whereas if your basis is 25.75 and GameStop goes to 20,
4983.44s: well, your basis is just 25.75.
4985.60s: And keep up is at 20.
4986.80s: There's just nothing going on there.
4989.28s: So this here is actually a pretty useful maneuver.
4994.96s: The other thing that you'll notice is that it actually reduces my total risk.
4998.96s: Because even right now losing $905, the value of the position is $9400.
5004.40s: I'm only going to use $9200.
5005.92s: So it's not that much, right?
5007.12s: But it's a $200 difference.
5008.96s: So I would have $200 less in this position than I would otherwise,
5013.20s: which again can be used to buy shares if I just want to get into it as it's starting to move.
5019.44s: So there's actually two tickers that I'm looking at doing this in right now.
5024.96s: One of them is this and one of them is Ibit.
5028.32s: And it's again, just for the broader moves that I've seen there as well.
5033.60s: So that's kind of the latest with GameStop.
5041.36s: At least with respect to the position.
5043.84s: With respect to the stock, I haven't seen a ton of movement.
5048.72s: It's obviously still digesting the Bitcoin news, which I think my honest opinion is I think
5057.60s: the Bitcoin news is more of, I don't want to call it like a visual act.
5071.52s: It seems a little bit more for branding and publicity, in my opinion,
5075.92s: than something that will meaningfully enhance the business.
5081.28s: So, yeah, I mean, it's not bad.
5089.04s: I don't think it's bad for it to hold some Bitcoin.
5090.88s: But the thing I will continue to remind people in general is it's a company.
5096.40s: It needs to have revenue.
5097.92s: Bitcoin is not revenue.
5099.36s: Bitcoin can appreciate.
5100.88s: Bitcoin can also depreciate.
5103.20s: So I'm bullish in Bitcoin, by the way.
5106.08s: So I don't think it's a bad ad to the balance sheet.
5108.64s: But I do think that we still need to see the company pivot.
5112.48s: And it's actually starting not to concern me, but I am starting to look at this as
5121.60s: when are we going to do this pivot?
5123.12s: Because right now, they're showing small things along the way.
5127.36s: But nothing that I would consider too massive.
5131.12s: Let's see what we got.
5139.36s: I tend to agree about Bitcoin.
5141.44s: We'd love to see investments in based on their filings.
5143.60s: I thought RC wanted to function as holding.
5145.20s: What do you make of volumes in GameStop?
5147.36s: Well, I think the volumes in GameStop
5150.00s: have to do with first earnings.
5153.20s: And then I think the announcement
5155.76s: about the debt offering impacts it.
5160.48s: I also think Cohen's purchase obviously impacts it.
5165.44s: So I think it's a few things that you'll see
5169.92s: driving the movement in GameStop broadly and then also the volume.
5177.04s: So I think the problem with GameStop is a holding company.
5183.52s: I struggle to see that angle.
5187.36s: Because if GameStop, again, like in my opinion,
5191.92s: if GameStop was going to be a holding company, I don't know why they would
5198.24s: not just unwind the physical locations then, just close them.
5202.56s: They're closing the unprofitable ones.
5204.56s: But if that's the ultimate angle that they're going to go and do a spin off,
5209.92s: the other thing is I don't know why you would do it with GameStop outright.
5213.52s: Maybe it's easier for a logistical reason.
5216.32s: But to me, there would be nothing wrong with, again, Google and Alphabet,
5221.44s: right, building a parent company that holds GameStop.
5224.64s: Let GameStop continue to be what GameStop is.
5226.96s: It has good branding, good brand loyalty, good consumer side.
5230.88s: And then if you want it to be a broader holding company that sits over it,
5234.80s: that's borne essentially out of it, then you could do that.
5238.88s: But I don't see the actual benefit here in like
5243.28s: turning GameStop into a holding company because it still is a brick and mortar institution.
5251.60s: And while it is that, and it does have obviously an online presence,
5256.40s: but being a brick and mortar institution has its own whole list of things.
5260.56s: This is the same thing with Berkshire.
5262.00s: Berkshire is a great example.
5263.92s: Berkshire owns a bunch of companies, and it has controlling stakes in a lot of companies.
5270.32s: But the individual companies are still the companies, not like progressive,
5274.88s: or one of the other insurance companies that Berkshire owns turned into Berkshire.
5281.28s: So I think that path is a little interesting.
5284.56s: Although admittedly, there are very clear hints of it.
5287.84s: People have sent comparisons between what is it?
5290.56s: The investor relations website between Berkshire and GameStop, and there's a change there.
5295.36s: So I do think that they're hinting towards.
5297.44s: There could be some version of that.
5299.36s: But in my mind, that would look more as launching a parent company that then GameStop
5306.08s: would be a component of versus turning GameStop into the holding company itself.
5317.84s: It's my broader guess.
5321.36s: Darchon, what are your thoughts on Soxel?
5323.12s: Do you mind taking a quick look?
5324.64s: Seems like once in a lifetime dip.
5329.04s: I don't think it's a once in a lifetime dip.
5332.48s: And stuff like this can go down, and it can continue going down.
5336.88s: And I actually think this is probably in one of the more,
5341.44s: like really one of the more difficult areas, meaning industries.
5347.36s: Because if you think about, again, reshoring, cost, building chips is super expensive.
5355.68s: And it requires super tight tolerances, yada, yada, yada.
5359.44s: So I actually think this is a harder industry to make that move more quickly.
5365.52s: So I think that it's very likely that you'll see these struggle for longer.
5370.08s: That doesn't mean that it's going to stay down at eight.
5371.92s: And that doesn't mean that I can't triple quadruple, quintiple,
5375.44s: and go up into the 40s, 45s.
5377.52s: Like it definitely could do that in a moderate term, potentially.
5381.52s: But here's the broader problem.
5385.84s: It never even got back to all time highs,
5390.16s: following the massive spike from 2020.
5396.48s: It peaked out here, and it hasn't gotten back.
5402.00s: So this is the problem with three times leverage.
5404.16s: And this is also why when you see me trading things like T-Triple Q's,
5407.68s: I have a very specific approach that heavily relies on the ability,
5412.56s: again, to move in and out of the equity position.
5417.84s: And it's because you can get moves like this, where it just recently recaptured highs.
5424.40s: So for a comparison, just to give you some context,
5430.40s: if you look at QQQ, and you look at T-TUs, and let's zoom these out,
5442.96s: let's do five year weekly in both.
5447.04s: What do you notice?
5448.72s: Difference here.
5450.56s: Difference is QQQ smashed.
5454.48s: It absolutely smashed.
5457.28s: Now, the difference between these, and this is a common issue that a lot of traders make,
5464.32s: is they make the high-to-high comparison.
5467.04s: They'll say, oh, QQQ essentially posted new highs back here in January of 24.
5477.04s: If we take a look at January of 24 here, it's not even,
5486.48s: it's about halfway.
5487.84s: It made it about halfway back.
5490.56s: But the difference is, and this is why having a mobile basis is so important.
5495.52s: Because yeah, if you top-ticked it and just held, you are essentially getting chewed up here.
5500.88s: If you didn't top-ticket and hold, or if you did top-ticket and you have like I do,
5506.08s: a specific momentum following approach that naturally starts scaling you out in your highs like
5511.44s: this. And as it's rotating down, you start nibbling on the way down, you use short puts.
5516.00s: Then you start rolling the short puts to get as good of a basis as you can before
5519.68s: finally choosing to take assignment.
5521.52s: Then all of a sudden, rather than your basis being up here at 91,
5524.24s: your basis might be down here at like 38.
5527.12s: So then even when this makes the substandard recapture of the drop, you're still out essentially
5534.00s: at the same time. So the way you trade it matters a lot, that can be extended to something like
5539.04s: SOXL, but I think SOXL in general is going to be in a really challenging environment because of
5544.56s: the industry, writ large.
5548.48s: Just as so, I wonder GME time horizon for that type of visit, I guess that's the measure.
5552.96s: Well, and it's also whether or not that is the pivot, right? For GameStop, we actually don't know
5559.28s: if that's the angle we think it's going to go based on, you know, us generally guessing,
5564.88s: but we really don't ultimately know if that's the route that they're going to take.
5570.32s: It's just picking up little clues here and there and making educated guesses.
5575.36s: So it's very much TBD.
5577.60s: All right, Gang, I got to go pack, good hanging out. If you need anything, you can always drop
5586.24s: in the discord, even if I'm not going to be as around as I typically would be, there's plenty of
5591.28s: people in there that are happy to help however they can and plenty of folks that have been around
5595.84s: for a while. So they can pick it up. Be an outlier. Don't let the market get you. Pay attention out
5600.96s: there. See you guys later.
