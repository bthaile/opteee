0.00s: Paul Tudor Jones is betting big on DJT, winning the election. I actually got an email from
5.72s: somebody asking if I could take a look at DJT and I'm always happy to take a peek at whatever
10.48s: you want me to. That's kind of a fun game of analyzing what you're interested in. So
16.80s: I started looking through at a broad sense and there's a few things that I think we should
20.28s: talk about. But this piece of news, I actually think it's kind of a big component here.
25.08s: To be abundantly clear, I really couldn't possibly care less about anybody's political leanings.
30.60s: My entire premise of that is you should do whatever is right for you. Now, there's a reality,
36.44s: though, behind election impacts on the stock market. And that is the lens I aim to talk about
42.44s: this through. Right now, Kamala Harris doesn't really have an ETF or a ticker that's largely
49.32s: associated with her and her brand like DJT and Donald Trump has. So that's why this is part
55.08s: of the conversation here. If Kamala did, I would talk about that one as well, but she doesn't.
60.68s: As it sits, there are different ideas for whether or not a Republican wins or a Democrat wins in
66.04s: terms of what's likely to move in terms of sectors. But those are more just generalized,
72.60s: less precise tools. This is a really interesting scenario that quite literally there is a stock
78.76s: that is directly tied to one of the presidential candidates. And it gives us an opportunity to
83.80s: essentially price probabilities along with prediction markets, which we're going to take a look at as
89.32s: well. So as looking through the news to get myself started, I thought this was really fascinating.
96.28s: So from here, this is from 1108 today, Pacific time. And this is a conversation. This is from
103.64s: Market Watch. And it says another billionaire investor positions for a Trump when he's placing
110.20s: inflation trades. So let's read through this together. Legendary investor Paul Tutor Jones said
116.28s: Tuesday, he's moved his portfolio in the direction of a victory by Donald Trump in the five
121.96s: noved presidential election, but warned of a potential reckoning over a burgeoning US debt pile
128.60s: regardless of the victor. This has been in more and more conversations debt right now is
133.32s: exceedingly high. It's a little bit like we the US has debt through our ears and spending is
138.04s: still very high. Again, not looking to get political, simply just looking at numbers and those are
143.08s: the facts. We have a pile of debt. So Jones goes on to say, I have moved in that direction for sure.
151.08s: And he has a massive following in the markets. He's one of the brightest minds in the eyes of most
157.24s: people. And he says, if he had repositioned for a potential victory by Trump, the Republican nominee
165.16s: over vice president Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, it just means more inflation trades.
171.80s: So that I actually find really interesting. You can see that they're long,
176.76s: gold, long Bitcoin and still believes that they're very, very much undervalued here.
183.08s: Which if we take a look, gold is actually still hovering highs. So it's interesting to see
188.76s: this perspective here. So let's continue on reading. It says, the bigger question Joe said is whether
195.48s: there will be some point of recognition, particularly with all the tax cuts that are being promised
200.20s: by both sides and the spending plans. You noted that the US government debt has grown from 40%
206.20s: of GDP to nearly 100% in 25 years and appears to be on an unsustainable trajectory.
214.44s: So yeah, this positioning conversation by Paul Tutor Jones is really, really interesting. And
223.00s: here's another big thing again for anybody that's interested in the latest on this. I saw this
228.12s: going through, but it looks like Trump is going to go on Joe Rogan on Friday. And let's take a look now
236.12s: at what's been going on with the ticker itself. We can see that implied volatility percent. I was
240.84s: very high. So there's essentially 86%. So most days are lower than where it is today.
247.16s: Implied volatility, I am a complete buffoon in case we're wondering. This is really great metrics for
255.08s: for gold, but we actually don't care about gold, I don't think. I was wondering. As soon as I got
259.56s: to the implied volatility, I saw it at 17%. I was like, uh, something's wrong here. This is better.
265.24s: 300%. Uh, that's, yeah, this is, this isn't the stuff we're talking about. So implied volatility
271.72s: percentile, not in gold, but in DJT is actually 98% where 247 days are lower. So this is pretty
280.12s: elevated. We can see IV right now is over 300%. And five day average daily range is 9.3,
286.60s: five day average true range 8.47. So overall, pretty, pretty profound movements. And it's been on
294.52s: an absolute tear. It's gone from 17 and three quarters on the 24th of September and it's
301.80s: essentially cracking highs here. Term highs almost on this three month chart coming right up to
307.16s: 34 and change. So volume is being bit up heavily, although volume is starting to slow down.
313.96s: The five day average volume as it sits today is 42.3 mill. 20 day is 34.8 million. Today's volume
321.96s: is 55 mills. So still definitely exceeding all those averages. You can see volatility has just
327.16s: been climbing. This is always interesting when volatility is climbing as the stock is going up.
332.44s: That's not normal. Normally when the stock is going up appreciating value volatility will contract.
337.88s: But this just means that the market has no idea which way this thing can snap upside or downside.
344.36s: That's why we're seeing volatility move as it is in relation to it, which is also very interesting.
350.92s: Now to take a quick peek at Polly Market and to take a look at the presidential election,
356.84s: if we pop into here, we can see what the probability sit as it sits today. And it's showing
362.52s: probability of Trump winning is 64 percent against Kamala at 35.8. So call it 36 percent.
370.68s: Call she another market is showing 61 percent by 39 percent. So again, these kind of discrepancies
378.44s: actually are tradable for cross exchange arbitrage. But the bigger note here is that it's clear.
385.16s: At least as it sits today, that Trump is generally favored. This is looking at Nevada. But
390.44s: funny enough, it actually is the same here. This rotates by the way. That's why I started reading
398.52s: Nevada because it moved on me. But it's the same anyways, which is kind of interesting.
403.08s: So he definitely is favored. And then for anybody that's interested, this is a really cool
409.80s: Norse music band. This is called War Druna. I like them a lot. I just realized that that song is
415.00s: on that tab. I listen to music a lot while I work. But great song. So anyways, let's take a look at
420.44s: the options market here because DJT is been, I mean, literally flying off the shelf. And there's
427.72s: a lot of people that have been speculating here. Now you can see a lot of people are actually
431.48s: trading the downside. Now DJT is interesting. This actually offers an opportunity to trade a
436.92s: couple different ideas because if you think Trump is going to win, you might go long the stock market
442.68s: in short. DJT is a hedge. One of the ways that you can play a pretty large position, but
449.24s: had your risk so that you don't get blown out. Now I also think that there's got to be an expectation
454.04s: of a pullback at some point because again, if we take a look at this, this is a absolutely massive
459.64s: massive run. And sooner or later, the music stops. So it doesn't wouldn't surprise me at all
465.64s: to see if that's part of what's being priced in here. So we're seeing 388,000 calls against 468,000
474.04s: puts. And a good bit of them are 15 know. I don't think that's a big surprise. These are literally
479.96s: to play the election. So 156,000 calls against 160 on the put side. And again, so you can tell most
487.16s: of the ally is centered around the election period itself. So a couple other things of note is if
495.32s: we take a look at the implied vol for the out of the monies, you can see that this thing is all
501.24s: over the place. Let's clean it up. Look at 15 know and eight know specifically. And spot price
507.48s: as it sits right now, it was up what 9.87% today, it's sitting at 3440. And I mean, right now,
515.80s: vol is a little bit rich on the put side compared to the call side. So the put sides being priced
521.24s: a little more heavily than the call side. So yeah, really, really interesting spot here. Now in
526.44s: terms of expectations, as always, really, really hard to say, this is going to be a very news driven
531.64s: thing. So it's not like you can value DJT as a company is a stock and try to think about what
539.40s: it's earnings are going to be or stuff like that is literally being served as a proxy for Trump.
543.72s: Winning the election is it sits now, which is kind of crazy. So if you're thinking about trying to
548.20s: value this or play this, just know that you're really just playing those expectations. And as
553.24s: those expectations oscillate leading into the election, this is going to continue moving. So
559.00s: but right now it looks like people are positioning definitely for an election play here. We'll see
564.76s: how it goes. Let me know which way you think that this is going to go because I don't know,
569.00s: it's a coin flip to me. Always interesting though lots, lots of IV. Let me know if you need
574.60s: want me to look at anything. If you need anything, hit me up in the discord, be an outlier. I'll see you
578.20s: all later.
