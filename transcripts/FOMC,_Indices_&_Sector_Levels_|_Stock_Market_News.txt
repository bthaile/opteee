0.68s: what's up outliers happy Sunday today's
2.96s: video is just a quick Market Outlook for
6.12s: what's coming up for the week ahead and
9.28s: we'll get right Off to the Races so last
11.76s: week we saw a pretty significant
14.00s: rotation you can see across the primary
16.72s: Futures The e- Minis here had a really
19.48s: strong rally as did NASDAQ as did
21.64s: Russell now when I look across the
23.68s: different indices I still see the S&P
25.88s: 500 kind of being the top performer here
28.28s: as it's very very reason closing in on
31.76s: near-term highs these are all 3-month
33.60s: daily charts we can see that NASDAQ
37.00s: still has a way to go right now it's at
40.00s: 19872 and it needs to get essentially to
42.56s: 2100 is and the Russell is still behind
46.84s: by a moderate amount as well with the
49.32s: term hike here at 2320 and right now
52.16s: it's running at 2209 so what does that
54.48s: tell me it tells me that the S&P 500
56.56s: obviously is leading in terms of overall
59.16s: strength but then it also gives me some
60.68s: glimpses as to where the strength is
63.24s: coming from so if we take a look within
65.64s: the individual
67.56s: um exchanges in sectors we'll see two
71.08s: things that are really important the
72.84s: first thing is you'll see that for the
75.60s: NASDAQ it's still starting to show Highs
79.00s: but just very recently and then if we
81.64s: took at the New York Stock Exchange it
83.80s: is really really running green now
87.40s: here's the interesting thing is even as
91.32s: iwm was collapsing and again NASDAQ and
94.36s: iwm they're not like a Ono one in terms
97.28s: of what's on the U New York Stock
100.00s: Exchange just an important admin note
102.12s: but they're decent
104.00s: proxies for kind of broad Market
106.88s: Behavior so when we look across the New
108.72s: York Stock Exchange we can see that
109.92s: there was pretty significant strength
112.64s: even as iwm is rolling over even as the
116.00s: q's were running over and even as the
118.36s: S&P 500 were rolling over we can see
120.60s: that gross lows were definitely opening
122.80s: up but that tells me that this down move
125.64s: was being precipitated by a handful of
128.16s: larger names not the bread of names
131.24s: bread mean how many are there definitely
133.64s: not the most of them right because it
135.36s: maintained net highs even during this
138.96s: across the board across all the
140.92s: individual indices so what this means to
144.84s: me at a high level is pocketed strength
148.48s: it means that when we're looking to
150.56s: stack strength like I talk about
152.48s: frequently when coming up with
153.96s: directional dispositions I want to have
157.12s: as many factors in my favor as possible
160.44s: well I can tell you one of those factors
162.64s: that's not here right now is all of the
165.24s: indices moving up uniformly we can see
168.92s: that even now the cu's it's still for a
172.60s: 3mon standard deviation channel is
175.12s: negative sloping now as I've mentioned
177.76s: before it's getting near what I would
179.84s: considered to be a couple really
181.44s: important levels we can see that the
183.56s: point of control on a volume profile for
185.60s: the q's is at 480 481 and we can see
189.04s: that there's a lot of congestion just
190.44s: below that as well so what that tells me
192.92s: is for Tech I want to know how it
196.00s: behaves in this region here massively
199.80s: because if it starts breaking above then
202.88s: I start thinking okay looks like bullish
205.80s: resumption if it gets stuck here and
209.12s: starts to reach eject down notice what
211.96s: that would build we have a high we have
214.40s: a lower high right now this is a lower
217.04s: high so if this stays down here as a
219.52s: lower high then we are literally
221.44s: assuming a downtrend where the next
224.32s: expectation would be a lower low below
227.04s: this but right now when you see these
229.08s: kinds of configurations the chart it
231.00s: literally Can it can go either way for
232.84s: any reason now there's some economic
235.04s: events coming up this coming week that I
237.40s: think will actually help this a little
238.92s: bit in terms to the upside but we never
241.76s: know and we have to wait and see our job
243.80s: as Traders is to come up with ideas
247.16s: probabilistic assessments about what we
248.80s: think may or may not happen but I'm
251.04s: going to wait until I can see some level
253.48s: of confirmation before I start
256.28s: committing large sums of capital again
258.88s: I've said this a few times I have
260.20s: exposure to all three indices right now
262.44s: through Futures but I'm still not
265.60s: heavily committed so I'm in a holding
268.84s: pattern here
270.28s: so that's what I'm really eager to see
272.64s: in the cues
274.76s: specifically now let's take a quick look
277.44s: at what we have coming up the week ahead
281.16s: and there's some meaningful releases not
284.96s: as quite of a busy week but obviously
288.24s: there's a really important release
290.44s: coming up that will go over in a second
292.24s: being the the Fed rate statement but I
294.24s: mean in terms of other inflation
295.48s: indicators it's a little quiet so we
297.48s: have retail sales coming out on on the
300.36s: 17th the 16th is super quiet it's just
303.44s: the Manufacturing
305.12s: Index I read this for context but I
307.92s: don't really read too far into it so we
310.44s: have retail sales industrial production
313.32s: the housing market index I always like
314.96s: reading because I'm also a real estate
316.44s: investor so I kind of like understanding
319.04s: how overall housing market is performing
321.84s: really just for that context so that's
323.28s: the same reason why I care about things
325.12s: like housing starts and building permits
328.04s: but here's where it starts to become
330.48s: really important you can see on the 18th
333.72s: we have the fomc rate statement and
338.20s: economic projections along with the rate
341.16s: decision so this is going to be
344.20s: massively important because if we take a
346.68s: look at the current market expectations
348.84s: they're very very specific so if we pop
351.84s: over here to the FED watch tool get rid
354.24s: of their popup but maybe not oh look at
357.56s: that it's not even lined up if I hit my
359.40s: cross right on there it's no good it's
360.84s: lined up down here Tricky Tricky Tricky
363.80s: so if you look at the comparison
365.36s: probabilities this is actually new so we
368.40s: now see a higher probability of a 50
372.80s: basis point cut that's new that's brand
376.08s: new because just yesterday and the day
378.80s: before it was 50/50 and then even tilted
381.20s: a little heavier for a 25 basis point
383.12s: cut so fascinating the only thing that I
386.68s: find interesting about this is in my
388.64s: opinion it seems like largely the market
390.64s: has a 25 basis point cut already priced
392.76s: in I think that if we see the cut it's
396.04s: insanely likely that we see some sort of
398.60s: follow through from the broad Market
400.16s: kind of just seeing that we're moving
401.52s: down that path of rate Cuts if it's a 50
404.52s: basis point cut I would imagine a little
406.88s: bit more of a movement or the market
410.20s: could start getting a little concerned
411.84s: actually and and it wouldn't surprise me
414.44s: because I still think the market would
416.28s: be bid up but I think overall
418.80s: cautiousness and nervousness would start
420.48s: to come out more because if you think
422.20s: about the the campaign that Powell has
424.16s: maintained it's been very communicative
426.36s: very steady and it's been very slow and
428.84s: methodical like very slow we even been
431.88s: waiting so long to cut rates where a lot
433.92s: of people have been arguing this should
435.08s: have started like six months ago at at
437.36s: the at the late end so it would be
439.92s: actually kind of surprising to me to see
441.88s: Powell go through his real real focus on
446.04s: controlling inflation his fear of
447.68s: inflation spiking back up once we start
449.52s: cutting rates cuz that's a whole other
450.76s: problem set and to start with a 50 basis
453.40s: point cut actually to me would start to
455.84s: indicate that they don't feel like they
457.88s: have the same Runway that they've been
459.88s: communicating because that's one of the
461.76s: luxuries they've had about the rate
464.12s: they've been able to move so slowly and
465.88s: methodically because things aren't
467.64s: breaking all over the place yet we've
470.84s: been very economically resilient we've
473.64s: seen some spikes some drops in things
475.60s: like employment productivity metrics
477.96s: stuff like that but we're not seeing
479.68s: like depression level signals or
481.28s: anything like that so I am now really
485.52s: really eager actually to see if this
488.52s: materializes because I could see this
491.04s: going either way again I would imagine
493.24s: in terms of price we would see near-term
495.16s: positive price movement but I imagine we
497.72s: would see sentiment change a little bit
500.36s: and people starting to get a little bit
502.56s: kind of curious about we've had this
504.96s: really really cautious cycle so far
507.36s: we've waited so long to start cutting
510.52s: to start with the 50 basis point cut to
513.20s: me would indicate something else in
515.16s: their messaging that we would have to
516.40s: pay really close attention to because by
518.68s: all accounts I think most across the
521.32s: market would presume a 25 basis point
523.64s: cut and kind of see what happens it
525.68s: wouldn't even surprise me to see a cut a
527.32s: pause than a cut
529.44s: because again they face a really really
532.76s: delicate challenge here and if the
535.88s: scenario comes where inflation starts to
537.64s: spike back up after they start cutting
539.96s: that's really difficult to get back
541.88s: under control
543.48s: meaningfully so very interesting so
546.76s: that's going to be on the 18th though
548.16s: that's going to be a really really
549.80s: volatile day on a relative basis again
552.12s: not looking to be hyperbolic or anything
554.40s: but if we take a look at we'll grab SPX
557.00s: for this
558.04s: example and we take a look at the
560.32s: volatility you can see 15 16 19
563.72s: 199 so we're really really interested
567.00s: about this time period where we're going
568.44s: to see the the statement come out again
570.76s: totally as expected so the other thing
574.84s: that we have coming up jobless claims
577.00s: sorry that's just a little alert um
579.96s: jobless claims on the 19th which again
582.84s: that's going to be another really
584.00s: important metric believe it or not and
585.88s: the reason why that's becoming important
587.76s: is because there was a couple revisions
589.24s: that we had and now everybody's kind of
591.44s: looking at this metric a little more
593.36s: closely I think so we have again not a
596.84s: ton of data coming out this week but we
599.52s: have a few things that are much higher
601.88s: impact specifically rate statements um
605.28s: and things like that so I'm interested
607.16s: to see essentially how that goes now
609.92s: from a broader Market perspective I've
611.96s: already talked about a few of these
613.72s: trades I really been rotating through a
617.04s: bunch of different stuff right now my
619.24s: portfolio is still heavily positioned to
621.92s: be in my core allocation with
624.36s: speculative allocations running so
626.60s: things like H was a ratio put diagonal
630.28s: that I had on that I took off because it
632.68s: essentially did what I wanted and it
634.48s: started bottoming out so I actually
637.52s: still think this looks good to the
638.92s: downside to be clear but you can see
640.64s: where my alert sits and essentially
643.72s: where we hit as a high on the 13th was
649.00s: 2844 so I was 6 cents shy of that so at
652.96s: that point the trade had generally run
654.64s: its course it wasn't a really long-term
656.44s: trade it was a just general short in
659.56s: energy and for those that are curious
661.08s: what the ratio put diagonals look like
663.32s: it's really really simple all I'm doing
666.16s: is something like going out into 15 nove
669.08s: I'll buy a in the money put so something
672.84s: like
674.12s: this get rid of that and I realized I
676.52s: accidentally did the opposite trade so
677.92s: we'll do buy and then what I do is I
680.68s: sell typically
682.84s: closer to today really it was the 20
686.12s: steps that I had on but it would be
687.84s: something around here and I would sell
690.28s: out of the money puts against it and the
693.12s: way that this would work is typically I
695.72s: maintain a very specific ratio that I
698.44s: like to run so for example I might have
701.40s: in this example like maybe 10 Longs
704.68s: against three shorts this is smaller
707.24s: than I would put on but that's kind of
708.60s: like where it starts to become
710.44s: representative of the disposition I have
712.40s: and it's really just designed to play to
714.44s: the downside the short puts can be
716.60s: rolled if I want to try to salvage
719.24s: profit out of them but it gives me two
720.64s: different profit mechanisms that's the
722.60s: point of the trade this was a just
724.76s: really simple really simple trade now in
727.76s: terms of finding good shorts now it
730.44s: becomes a little more interesting to me
732.72s: because if we look at energy it's
734.08s: starting to bid up this is what I was
735.52s: shorting before so as I look for things
738.52s: that look kind of ugly that are rotating
740.84s: over the best still is energy but not
743.84s: right now cuz it's being bit up I need
745.44s: to see how that rolls I see XLV which is
748.52s: kind of trending sideways what I'm
750.52s: highlighting is from a high level I'm
753.24s: actually not seeing a whole lot jumping
754.64s: out at me that I want to go short XLE
757.00s: would still be towards the top of the
758.32s: list XLF is getting there I actually had
760.84s: some short puts in Bank of America that
763.00s: I took down at a loss because it was a
766.48s: essentially a bullish trade they weren't
768.28s: in the money yet but it started not
770.28s: doing what I wanted it to do so I
772.28s: managed those pretty
773.72s: quickly and yeah so to find short Deltas
777.88s: becomes a little more interest thing
779.48s: when I look across all of the indices
782.28s: and I'm not seeing significant weakness
784.96s: except for XLE which again is now
786.88s: starting to get bit up before it was
788.72s: easy right you just go to XLE it was
790.56s: falling off a cliff you ride that to the
792.56s: downside I don't like going short Tech
794.92s: so now it's just a matter of finding
796.72s: other opportunities to capture some
798.88s: short Deltas the last thing I want to
801.28s: take a look at is the calendar and it's
805.00s: because for those that don't know we
807.20s: still have some earnings on the docket
810.92s: that I like to see so things like Riley
814.12s: GIS FDX those are all well within play
817.72s: mu ACN CCL so for this month it's kind
821.20s: of like the stragglers but then as soon
823.60s: as you click to the next month guess
825.84s: what we start with the banks so we're
828.56s: coming into the next earning season
830.12s: that's kind of the cool part about being
831.80s: an options Trader is that as soon as you
833.48s: wrap up one options trading season the
836.16s: next one's kicking off right away and
838.28s: we're going to start with the thanks so
839.80s: I'm already prepping the portfolio to
842.32s: essentially take positions in earnings
844.72s: plays making sure I have Capital ready
846.92s: to move there but just putting that on
848.76s: everybody else's radar because it is on
851.72s: mine now for the outlier Pro live stream
855.24s: later today I'm going to go through a
856.88s: bunch of my positions talk about some of
859.04s: the updates I've made recently and then
861.24s: we got a bunch of scanning to do to look
863.24s: for opportunities but for everybody else
865.48s: you know happy to connect more on that
867.00s: stuff tomorrow during the YouTube live
868.44s: stream as always if there's anything
870.84s: that you want to cover any questions you
872.32s: have let me know be an outlier I'll see
874.20s: you all later
