0.00s:  What's up outliers?
3.56s:  Couple of seconds late, how to finish doing a little stretch routine.
8.26s:  Try to recharge the old sciatica.
10.84s:  Every once in a while I have to lay down for a little bit and try to reset the clock
15.20s:  on it before it starts hurting like a mother.
19.04s:  What's up everybody?
20.72s:  I hope we are off to a great week.
25.28s:  The, I don't know, last trading week was pretty interesting.
28.28s:  I got to say.
29.68s:  So I'm excited to talk a little bit about that.
32.88s:  And we have a couple of questions that were sent in that I want to make sure we hit also.
39.88s:  There it is.
41.68s:  Like I couldn't see my stuff for a second.
44.64s:  Looks like we are up and running.
47.16s:  Perfect.
48.88s:  Sweet.
49.88s:  So let me grab.
51.04s:  There is actually a comment.
54.04s:  There was a comment on the post that I want to hit.
61.40s:  It was a great question.
64.00s:  So for those that don't know when we use the YouTube studio for some reason, it doesn't
68.20s:  let me see community comments.
69.76s:  I can only see it on my phone.
71.76s:  I'll just read it from the phone.
73.80s:  So agenda for today, pretty simple.
76.88s:  What I want to cover first is we do have a quiz that I want to work through with you all.
82.68s:  Then I want to take a look at, well, I guess we'll start with some of the questions.
86.68s:  Then we'll do the quiz.
87.92s:  And then we'll kind of navigate around depending on what conversations come up and what capacity.
92.84s:  So this session is kind of like the last few.
96.00s:  We're pivoting away from the really structured learning components.
99.96s:  If you've missed any of those, go back to the first episode in this whole playlist.
104.60s:  And we have literally like a comprehensive rundown of what we've learned so far, which
112.24s:  was in the beginning very, very structured.
114.04s:  You know about like the basics.
116.16s:  So let me grab this chat so I can say hello to everybody.
127.52s:  And it looks like Reese's here, Shrej is here, Dr. Zayas Joey Pollo, H Jonathan and Mary
139.36s:  Shell.
140.36s:  Beautiful.
141.84s:  We got the gang in town.
143.48s:  Mary Shell, where's the quiz?
144.72s:  I will post it into the chat.
146.32s:  So we will look at the quiz together.
148.72s:  It's designed that most of the questions are going to be open.
151.60s:  I like open-ended questions.
152.92s:  I don't like multiple choice.
154.60s:  I know that they're easier for like a teacher to grade.
157.56s:  But in order to evaluate a thought process, it's much harder to navigate the nuance of
161.72s:  things.
163.08s:  So yeah, that's why it's a little bit different.
166.60s:  And so here's the first question that I do want to hit.
169.44s:  I'll throw it out to the chat again.
170.92s:  I have to pull it up on the phone because I can't get it from the studio.
175.52s:  And it says, this is from Lord Slothable, which is a fantastic name.
182.68s:  We have to give a shout out to Lord Slothable.
185.52s:  And they say, I'm having trouble figuring out the difference between a covered option
192.28s:  and a single option where there is only one leg in the strike.
196.96s:  Now the last part of that only one leg in the strike, that doesn't make sense, which
200.80s:  we'll talk about.
202.48s:  But we can definitely grasp onto the meat of this question, which is a covered option
208.28s:  versus a single option.
210.80s:  So first thing for you, Mr. Lord Slothable, is a covered option and a single option actually
221.44s:  are not disparate things.
223.68s:  And we'll take a look at an example together.
228.24s:  So if we're trading TLT, just because that happens to be what I have up right now.
233.56s:  And if we look at a single option, we can do essentially four things for a single option.
240.08s:  We can come in here and we can buy a call.
244.44s:  We can sell a call.
246.88s:  We can buy a put.
249.44s:  Or we can sell a put.
250.84s:  Those are all single options.
253.96s:  Now all of those single options can have different risk profiles that make them covered or uncovered,
263.92s:  which for uncovered, we've referred to that as naked.
269.20s:  Those are really the two buckets.
270.72s:  So you can have a single option that's either covered or naked in its context dependent.
278.80s:  So an example of a covered option is if I go in here to sell this put and I have the
285.40s:  cash set aside to buy 100 shares at my strike price.
291.88s:  That would be covered.
293.88s:  Another example of a covered option, you wouldn't really refer to it as a covered option,
298.48s:  but it inherently is so is if you buy that put.
302.48s:  It's covered because as soon as you pay your debit, that's your max risk on the trade.
309.60s:  It can't lose more than that.
310.96s:  That's all there is to it.
312.92s:  Now you can have another scenario where if we sell this put and we have a stock position
323.04s:  that actually covers us technically or you can do the same thing on the call side.
329.04s:  So if I sell a call and it's just a short call, we would call that a naked short call.
338.36s:  And that means that we don't have any underlying to cover it.
341.92s:  It means that it's just a naked short call.
344.16s:  It's an option that's out alone and unafraid.
348.04s:  Normally when we refer to naked options, we would refer to that in the context of selling
353.28s:  them.
354.60s:  And when we're buying them colloquially, we would refer to them as singles, a long option
361.24s:  whatever.
362.64s:  But the nuances when we're talking about a covered option is normally that's going to be
369.80s:  a short option that's paired with something.
373.36s:  So for example, if we have a short call and we look at the risk profile on this short
381.12s:  call, you'll see that it has unlimited risk because the underlying can go up into perpetuity
391.48s:  and there's nothing that stops it.
394.00s:  Now we can have a covered call and the context of a covered call would be if we have shares
405.04s:  that then cap our risk.
408.44s:  That's what a covered call would be.
412.00s:  So the way to think about the difference between covered options and single options is covered
418.20s:  options typically are going to be short options colloquially like when we're talking about
422.56s:  them.
423.56s:  There will be short options that have some sort of other trade associated with it that
431.20s:  decreases the total risk profile from an unlimited potential risk.
436.84s:  Now this idea of like unlimited risk versus defined risk, I actually think it's important
446.00s:  to talk about that because this one is actually really confusing to people.
450.48s:  So and these are actually some of our quiz questions.
452.64s:  So we'll start with your first quiz question here, which is if I sell a put, does this
464.56s:  is this undefined risk or is this defined risk?
468.68s:  If I sell a put is this undefined risk or defined risk?
472.20s:  And the reason I asked this question is you'll you'll get a sense in a second, but I want
475.96s:  to root out the difference between how we colloquially talk about options and then what the
483.04s:  actual reality is.
486.36s:  So naked short put is that risk defined or risk undefined.
496.76s:  And he guesses and there's two different answers to this one.
505.60s:  Joey says undefined but technically defined since as a floor.
509.68s:  Yep, that's correct.
510.68s:  So for Cedar Savage is also correct, Robo is also correct.
514.68s:  Joey is definitely the most correct out of these.
518.24s:  So for Elon songs also correct.
524.16s:  So for Cedar Savage, Robo and Elon songs, are you familiar with the second part that
528.88s:  Joey is talking about that we refer to it is undefined, but it actually is defined.
537.84s:  You guys know why that's the case.
543.80s:  And again, this is why I want to talk about this because there's nuance in the language.
550.84s:  Robo says no, Elon songs says limited risk, that's it.
554.04s:  So a stock can go to zero.
557.72s:  Where does it go pass zero?
560.32s:  Right?
561.32s:  It gets buried.
562.72s:  It's not a commodity, something like oil crude oil futures that have a commodity component.
569.24s:  They can go negative because there's storage costs, there's transportation costs, there's
573.84s:  insurance on the barrels of oil themselves.
578.48s:  That is not case here.
580.28s:  So this stock can only go to zero.
583.48s:  So we call it undefined risk, but it's not undefined risk, it's completely defined.
589.72s:  Sooner or later, this will you go to zero.
593.40s:  You can't go below zero with these equities.
596.70s:  So does that part make sense?
598.92s:  With respect to the slight nuance between defined and undefined risk, when we're talking
605.68s:  about something like a naked short put, that we would call it colloquially is undefined
612.08s:  risk, but it actually is defined.
616.16s:  Vladimir Putin says the strike is the floor, not the strike, but it would be the
619.68s:  stock going to zero.
621.96s:  That's the floor.
623.20s:  Okay, cool.
624.20s:  So we're good there.
625.60s:  Now what about an inverse scenario?
630.08s:  What if we sell a call?
636.72s:  Is this defined or undefined?
645.36s:  All of the same thought processes before.
653.20s:  Joey says unlimited.
655.20s:  Seater says true undefined.
656.68s:  Robo says totally undefined.
658.28s:  Policies undefined.
659.68s:  Okay, great questions or kind of great inputs.
664.92s:  Is there, Lord's Lothable, we hit your, I don't know if you caught the answer, we actually
669.80s:  hit your question like right at the beginning.
671.36s:  So if you want to rewind, if you missed it, you can go back, check it out.
675.80s:  Vladimir Putin says again, covered call, nope, this is just a short call.
679.04s:  We're talking about a short call.
680.80s:  And so far, Joey, Seater, Robo, Polo, H all say undefined.
689.28s:  So here's the follow on question.
694.44s:  And again, this is pedantic, but I want the point to be made, because I think it's an
699.40s:  important consideration.
702.76s:  Are there unlimited resources on planet earth?
708.48s:  So if we think about the value of everything that exists, is it unlimited or is there
717.04s:  a limited amount of value that exists?
730.40s:  Elon Song says yes.
733.40s:  Technically limited.
737.40s:  Yeah.
738.40s:  Seater says the spaceship earth, okay.
745.76s:  Limited resource, but we make a value.
748.32s:  Joey says sure, but what is the limit?
750.24s:  It's actually undefined, but limited.
752.08s:  Exactly.
753.08s:  Joey has the exact nuance I'm hunting for there.
756.36s:  So Polo says if you consider IP, there's no upper bound.
760.60s:  Again, when we talk about value, it's not the value that I place on something.
767.60s:  I could say my value is Eric is $10 billion.
774.00s:  If there's not a counterparty that agrees that my value is $10 billion, there's no market.
783.60s:  So to your point, I can value myself at whatever I want, but what makes undefined value
790.68s:  is the counterparty that confirms that value, otherwise it's just a number.
797.00s:  So all I'm highlighting in this instance, and I use all of the resources in the world
802.80s:  as a obviously a really, really far removed example, but the example I'm making is even
810.56s:  something like this.
812.64s:  At some point becomes defined.
816.48s:  We just have no idea where we have no idea where I've never seen a stock go to infinity,
822.80s:  obviously, because you can't.
825.04s:  So all I'm highlighting is that when we're looking at this idea of defined undefined
832.72s:  risk, we use the terms undefined colloquially.
837.88s:  We use them as a shortcut, a bypass.
841.76s:  It's just a little faster than to say that there's a bunch of value and we don't know where
846.44s:  it is.
847.44s:  We just say undefined, even to the downside that clearly has a zero, it's the same thing
852.28s:  to the upside.
853.28s:  Sooner or later, value that you run out of how high a company can achieve a market cap,
859.32s:  again, we don't currently have unlimited market cap companies and we never will, because
864.08s:  sooner or later they will hit some sort of pinnacle of value that they can provide before
869.44s:  they erode.
871.16s:  So that's a really extreme example, not super applicable here.
876.60s:  The main point I'm trying to highlight with this example though is the nuance of when
881.12s:  we talk about things like defined versus undefined risk.
885.32s:  That's all.
886.72s:  Each says so then whatever counterparty is willing to pay above your strike is the upper
892.12s:  bound limit willing forced.
894.12s:  Yeah, I mean realistically speaking, this is when I take this into a more realistic example,
901.48s:  do you know what your risk is defined to the upside?
904.28s:  Because it is defined.
905.44s:  It's absolutely defined.
906.80s:  I use that first example as an extreme theoretical conversation, but there's a practical answer
911.92s:  to this that's very easy.
913.92s:  So what's the defined risk to the upside?
917.80s:  Because it is defined 100%.
926.20s:  Any guesses?
928.04s:  It depends on the plan.
935.24s:  Nope, it's not wrong, but that's not the example I'm using.
940.96s:  Your broker.
942.40s:  Your broker will liquidate your account.
945.00s:  That's where it's defined.
946.32s:  Now where that point is, we'll depend on the broker.
948.72s:  We'll depend on the size of the account.
950.16s:  It'll depend on the collateral account.
952.40s:  Your broker will not let you hold something to infinity, right?
956.44s:  Like your risk is still defined.
958.64s:  It's not unlimited risk.
960.68s:  Because sooner or later your broker is going to be like margin requirement is up.
965.28s:  Marge requirement is up.
966.84s:  Marge requirement exceeds your account value.
969.12s:  You are now in a margin call.
971.00s:  You have X period of time to add capital before I start liquidating your shit for you.
976.08s:  You didn't meet the requirement to plus up your capital.
978.84s:  I'm liquidating your account.
980.44s:  You're now in a debit to me for X number of dollars.
985.16s:  That's where it's defined.
986.48s:  So you absolutely can exceed your total account value, but it's not going to go to infinity.
991.04s:  Sooner or later your broker is responsible for the risk.
994.16s:  They're literally not going to let it go to infinity.
997.12s:  So even when we're looking at something like a covered call, it in no way is undefined
1001.60s:  in a practical sense.
1003.52s:  Because your broker will not let that happen again.
1007.16s:  That's the nuance of these things.
1009.48s:  There's a completely theoretical component to learning options, which again, you guys,
1014.24s:  the theoretical answer is literally on point.
1016.48s:  Everybody saying totally undefined.
1018.08s:  It is on point because it can go to infinity where that is and where finite resources on
1023.56s:  planet earth run out.
1024.76s:  I don't know, but short of that technically, it can go there.
1029.92s:  That would define it at some point again and undefined points.
1032.44s:  You don't know where it is.
1033.44s:  It's not infinite, but way before we get anywhere near that, your broker is going to close
1039.08s:  your account done.
1041.36s:  So that's the nuance when we're talking about define undefined.
1046.12s:  The reason why we care about discussing defined undefined risk profiles is simply because
1051.32s:  it helps us understand the behavior of options in a quicker way to synthesize it.
1057.44s:  Like that's pretty much it.
1058.44s:  It's just a slightly faster way to think about and to discuss options positions.
1064.56s:  So G36 is here.
1069.40s:  They're getting clapped on spy options.
1071.12s:  That happens.
1072.12s:  H says God selling naked calls on Burke A and rolling thinking he could get out, which
1079.20s:  would be a bastard and a half.
1080.52s:  Yeah.
1081.52s:  Well, I mean, sooner or later, God just throws tsunami or some shit and then he'll take
1084.56s:  care of it.
1085.56s:  But yeah.
1087.36s:  Elon Seng says these are kind of tricky questions.
1089.44s:  Yeah, they are.
1090.44s:  They're nuanced questions.
1091.64s:  We're not at the easy questions.
1092.72s:  I have plenty of easy questions.
1094.04s:  I'll throw some of those in so that we can get our confidence up.
1098.04s:  Here's your first easy question.
1100.76s:  So you want to place a bullish trade.
1103.56s:  What options structures make sense?
1106.72s:  It's about a softball as you can get.
1111.12s:  Paul says is the broker liable and if the count is deep, oh, of course.
1114.12s:  Yeah.
1115.12s:  The broker is reliable is completely, completely accountable for your risk.
1120.16s:  They obviously will pursue you to clear their risk, but they are the, they are the counter
1126.32s:  party.
1127.32s:  They are responsible for covering the risk.
1129.32s:  That's why you see things like bank runs, slightly different example, but in the example
1134.16s:  of a run on a bank, even Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley had the capital, but they weren't
1139.44s:  liquid enough to provide the capital fast enough.
1142.48s:  And that's what literally caused that bank to go under.
1144.84s:  They were completely liable to produce what they needed to produce and they couldn't
1149.96s:  produce it.
1150.96s:  Although they had the means to do so.
1153.84s:  So your broker is 100% on the hook for your risk as a trader.
1160.52s:  That's why they're very conservative with their margin requirements because they're not
1165.44s:  just going to take your risk for you.
1168.36s:  Right?
1169.36s:  So when we look at something like this and we have this, what is this?
1172.44s:  This is a short call in TLT.
1174.64s:  Right now the broker says, again, this is a pass through IRA account.
1178.48s:  So this is regulation team margin, a little more strict because it's for an IRA account.
1183.04s:  They were saying, I need 1700 bucks for this position for me to call this good.
1189.14s:  So yeah, the broker is responsible and they're not going to take the risk for you.
1195.36s:  G36 says long call short puts bingo.
1199.12s:  Vladimir off Putin says selling put by Nicole.
1201.52s:  That's good.
1202.52s:  Joey says ratio called diagonal long call short put by the stock.
1205.92s:  Yep, yep, yep.
1206.92s:  That's good.
1207.92s:  H says long call short puts ratio diagonals.
1213.60s:  Yep.
1214.60s:  Iron condors called debit spreads.
1216.96s:  Yep, put credit spreads also bullish.
1219.12s:  Yep, all correct.
1220.56s:  We also have things like covered calls, ratio covered calls, covered strangle long futures.
1228.52s:  All of those are on the docket.
1230.08s:  Paul says, I see, which I assume is iron condor, I would argue that that is not necessarily
1236.04s:  what I would consider bullish.
1238.12s:  G36 says callers.
1239.72s:  Yeah, I'd give it to give it to that too.
1244.32s:  Synthetic longs tons of ways.
1246.28s:  Those are all correct.
1249.48s:  Good job.
1250.48s:  All right, so that was kind of boring to do like that easy of a question.
1255.36s:  So let's get into something more fun.
1257.32s:  Should we?
1258.48s:  So this one is still very easy, but we will hopefully zoom in from here and make it a
1270.00s:  little more interesting.
1272.44s:  So when we're thinking about an options premium, there's two components to it.
1275.56s:  What are those two components?
1285.56s:  So for Joey and Vladimir off Putin, I would call you both out for the time value component
1297.52s:  because if you're going to break it down that way, it's a lit like you open yourself
1304.36s:  up for a little more scrutiny, which funny enough, it is my next question, which is this.
1315.52s:  Two inputs yield extrinsic value.
1321.36s:  So Joey and off Putin have one of them, right?
1327.00s:  They both already hit time value.
1330.08s:  So exactly.
1331.84s:  So Joey's got it.
1333.32s:  I'm in volatility bingo.
1335.36s:  Good.
1340.40s:  For everybody else, does that make sense?
1344.88s:  So when we're talking about the premium of an option, does the premium breakdown make
1350.96s:  sense?
1352.96s:  Okay.
1355.96s:  So we're talking about intrinsic value and follow on question.
1362.48s:  How do we, how do we figure out an intrinsic value?
1366.40s:  How do we calculate that?
1368.16s:  What's the path?
1374.88s:  It is a pretty straightforward difference between strike and the underlying.
1391.08s:  Whether it's in the end of money or not.
1392.52s:  So Dr. Zayis is about right.
1396.84s:  Fair price minus strike times 100 is incorrect.
1406.36s:  Joey says amount in the money.
1407.80s:  That's good.
1409.80s:  Age says stock price difference for delta value of shares.
1412.92s:  That's not correct.
1414.96s:  So this is good example.
1416.20s:  Let's take a look here.
1418.96s:  So if I follow G36's formula and I take the share price, which is 100 and I say,
1426.80s:  subtract a strike price of 105.
1429.68s:  What do I get?
1433.56s:  Get negative five times 100.
1438.72s:  So it's not that.
1444.68s:  The way that we calculate, Cedar Savage is directly on fleek.
1452.00s:  Joey says absolute value.
1453.48s:  No, because this isn't five dollars in the money.
1459.48s:  G36 says, I guess it was assumed in the money.
1462.68s:  Aha.
1463.68s:  Well, there's no assumption here.
1466.12s:  We're at the basics level.
1468.32s:  So this is exactly where we clarify assumptions.
1472.36s:  It's it's literally based on how far an option is in the money.
1478.72s:  So for calls, the way we calculated is different than puts.
1485.20s:  So for what Cedar Savage put above is exactly correct.
1491.20s:  Depending on if you have a call or if you get a put, we'll determine if you take strike
1501.72s:  price less stock or stock less strike.
1506.32s:  So the easier way to think about it is just simply how far in the money are you?
1510.32s:  How far in the money is in the option is your option?
1514.48s:  That's your intrinsic value.
1516.32s:  So if we have a 95 call and the stock is at 100, we would take the stock price of 100,
1525.60s:  subtract our strike of 95 for the call, you get five dollars.
1531.32s:  That's how far in the money you are over here.
1534.36s:  And on the put side, it's just the inverse.
1537.80s:  So it's not the same calculation for both.
1540.96s:  It's dependent on if it's a call or a put.
1544.08s:  Easy is way to think about it is simply how far in the money are you?
1548.80s:  That's all.
1551.60s:  Cool.
1554.20s:  Next question.
1558.24s:  This one should be easy.
1565.72s:  The question is what option will make more money on a 1% move in a stock?
1572.56s:  A 10 delta call or 50 delta call?
1584.20s:  John says it depends on if it's up or down.
1586.56s:  It doesn't because you'll notice that that's defined in the question with a plus 1%.
1595.08s:  So I see 50s across the board.
1597.28s:  Good.
1598.28s:  Good, good, good.
1602.76s:  So now at what point does that reverse?
1612.12s:  But what point does the 10 delta make more than the 50 delta?
1630.08s:  After it becomes in the money, incorrect.
1634.48s:  And a large, quick move to the upside, also incorrect.
1645.04s:  Read between the lines.
1648.20s:  Think about delta.
1649.44s:  What's the highest delta can get?
1655.32s:  1.
1659.72s:  Each of those options is going to hit a delta of 1 faster.
1666.72s:  50 delta.
1671.04s:  Good.
1673.56s:  Jonathan is reading between the lines.
1678.32s:  So if I take a look at this 101 call, which is a 50 delta, let's go to the 110 just
1685.68s:  for an example.
1687.76s:  And right around, I'll throw it down here just to make it easier.
1692.96s:  So if I go to 110, my 50 delta is going to make 769.
1698.44s:  My 10 delta is going to make 372.
1702.84s:  So let's say TLT goes to 200 now.
1706.40s:  My 10 delta makes 92.79.
1711.56s:  My 50 delta makes 97.54.
1718.04s:  So Jonathan is 100% correct.
1720.40s:  At no point in time, will the 10 delta overwhelm the 50 delta for a one on one basis?
1731.80s:  And it's because our deltas are limited.
1734.68s:  The examples that you guys are thinking of when we're considering a large move is when
1740.84s:  there are more of the further out of the money options because a lot of times when we compare
1749.04s:  these will compare the same cost.
1751.28s:  Right?
1752.28s:  So this cost a dollar 46.
1753.76s:  This costs 21 cents.
1756.16s:  So in this case, if I size them to be the same dollar value, then the story is different.
1765.64s:  So if we do like seven, age says, but the premium paid, it's only a larger percentage
1775.28s:  move on the option.
1776.28s:  That's exactly correct.
1777.28s:  So your option will show a much, much, much higher percent return on a one for one
1783.52s:  basis.
1785.16s:  If you do the out of the money option, the further out the 10 delta versus the 50 delta,
1790.28s:  the 10 delta as I just showed you was going to give you like $9,300 a red average.
1795.52s:  You only put 21 bucks in to get $9,300 in the scenario with the 50 delta, you put up
1800.64s:  $146 and you got $97.54.
1803.80s:  So on a gross dollar amount, you still made more with the at the money, but the percent
1812.12s:  return for the out of the money will be much higher.
1816.96s:  The reason why this is so important to understand is because as a trader, you have to be ready
1823.76s:  to flow in and out in between percent returns, gross returns, how much you're laying out,
1831.28s:  the behavior of what you're laying out, all of that matters a lot.
1836.52s:  And traders get too unilaterally minded with their perception of what may or may not
1842.20s:  perform better for X, Y or Z reason.
1846.16s:  And it's all about structuring things the way that you want them to behave.
1853.08s:  This is why when I talk about things like the ratio called the Agnal Strategy that I run
1857.84s:  or the ratio put diagonal strategy that I run that the base position is typically in
1864.28s:  the money.
1865.28s:  And the reason for that is I will get a lower percent return on my money, but I get a
1870.16s:  better dollar for dollar move with the underlying.
1872.92s:  I will add kicker options if I'm highly convicted that will compound quickly, but those
1878.76s:  only work if things move in my favor quickly enough.
1882.96s:  And if they don't, then as long as I get a moderate move, then my position still will
1887.84s:  probably work out with the higher delta, but it's all a series of trade-offs.
1893.72s:  So when we look at this, it's important to understand the way that these two different
1901.56s:  things behave around one another.
1908.56s:  We're going to be doing a lot of switching between sit and stand and because my prednisone
1913.84s:  dosage is coming down today.
1915.52s:  So the old, the old herniated disc is playing games with your boy.
1921.76s:  Age says definitely guilty of honing in on one metric percent versus capital outlay.
1927.52s:  This is good food for thought.
1928.72s:  Yeah, exactly.
1929.72s:  And it's super normal.
1930.72s:  Everybody, literally everybody does it.
1933.00s:  It is as common as you can imagine.
1935.52s:  So that's exactly why we do these exercises.
1938.00s:  Okay, cool.
1939.30s:  So I think we have that one down.
1941.36s:  Let's talk about this next one.
1942.72s:  We start to get into slightly more nuanced topics.
1946.52s:  What is a stock market inefficiency?
1949.32s:  Now this, I'm not going with the textbook definition because there are like some really,
1954.28s:  really rigid definitions of it.
1956.04s:  I don't care so much about that.
1957.84s:  I want to understand the way that we think about inefficiency.
1968.04s:  And then I think I have a video I can share on this.
1981.84s:  An opportunity.
1982.84s:  Okay, I'll take that.
1991.84s:  Mispricing capitalized until it's armed out potentially.
1998.40s:  Define efficiency please.
1999.48s:  I'm asking you.
2000.48s:  That's my question to you.
2010.20s:  And the value doesn't match up across platforms.
2012.20s:  That could be an example of it.
2020.12s:  The adverse ass not it.
2023.24s:  Tom Saudon of the say doesn't exist.
2025.08s:  That's objectively false.
2026.92s:  We know that's not true.
2030.32s:  Follow says a mispricing preferably a tradable one.
2033.52s:  It could be.
2039.40s:  Any other guesses.
2050.84s:  When the market has impressed the news events could be.
2056.68s:  Dr. Zayn's market price does not equal intrinsic value of the stock.
2060.00s:  That's an interesting one.
2061.00s:  So I'm actually not sure if that would be considered inefficiency personally because
2066.16s:  the markets are discounting mechanisms.
2068.88s:  So I literally don't know the answer to that one personally.
2071.56s:  I'm not sure that I would consider something not trading at or above intrinsic value in
2076.92s:  inefficiency though because I think that markets are designed to be discounting.
2084.00s:  So it's a good point.
2085.64s:  But so think of it this way.
2090.12s:  When we think about like okay so from inefficient market hypothesis.
2096.52s:  And inefficiency is when essentially information is failed to be baked into price.
2103.32s:  That's from inefficient market hypothesis the theoretical definition.
2106.40s:  I don't care about that.
2107.40s:  That doesn't really matter to me.
2108.96s:  I actually much prefer more of the practical definitions for something like inefficiencies
2115.12s:  versus mispricings.
2117.00s:  So inefficiency for my lens and this isn't just based on me.
2122.28s:  This is like from work of most volatility traders and stuff like that.
2125.72s:  Like you can read you and some clairs books and he'll talk about the difference between
2129.80s:  inefficiencies and mispricings.
2132.04s:  And inefficiencies are things that we know are there.
2137.52s:  We can see them.
2139.72s:  And it's there for a reason.
2141.84s:  So you and some clear has one of the best examples of this that you can think of.
2146.36s:  So think of a $20 bill and this is his example.
2150.24s:  I want to be super clear.
2151.24s:  This is you and this example.
2152.24s:  You can check this out from some of the podcasts that I did with him.
2154.56s:  But it's a great example.
2155.56s:  If you have a $20 bill and you're walking down the side of the sidewalk and you see the
2162.92s:  $20 bill outside of a bar and it's like 11 o'clock at night.
2168.88s:  That is a mispricing relative to the market.
2173.88s:  There's probably a reason why that happened.
2176.24s:  There was probably a drunk dude coming out of the bar, fumbling to grab his shit.
2181.00s:  He dropped the $20 bill.
2182.82s:  You pick it up and then you walk on.
2185.92s:  Then if you walk past that bar every single day, is that $20 still going to be there each
2192.60s:  time?
2194.60s:  Probably not.
2197.16s:  That's a mispricing.
2198.68s:  Mispricings are things that pop up for some reason or another, but they're typically
2202.64s:  short-lived.
2205.00s:  Then there's inefficiencies.
2207.72s:  And efficiency is like the volatility risk premium.
2211.72s:  We know definitively, quantifiably, over a long duration.
2217.44s:  We know we mispriced volatility relative to realize volatility.
2223.60s:  We know we do it.
2226.40s:  That's no secret.
2227.68s:  It's been there for literally as long as the stock market's been around.
2231.80s:  As efficient as the stock market is, it's still there today.
2236.48s:  So the example for that is like if that $20 bill, instead of being on the sidewalk,
2242.32s:  it's in the middle of a five lane California highway.
2245.72s:  And that $20 bill is out in the middle of the road, flopping around.
2249.08s:  You can go grab it.
2250.08s:  It's there.
2251.24s:  If you're fast enough, you can go grab it, get back to the sidewalk, take your $20,
2255.88s:  but there's a risk involved you could get hit by a fucking car.
2260.12s:  So we can see the $20 bill.
2261.84s:  We know the $20 bill is there, but a lot of people are like, man, it's not worth
2266.04s:  $20.
2267.04s:  I'd rather not get hit by some 18 year old chick cruising down the highway, texting,
2273.68s:  sending snapchats, then running me over as I'm trying to grab my $20 bill.
2277.96s:  I already have a herniated disk.
2279.28s:  The last thing I need is like a vehicle accident to pile onto that.
2283.28s:  Maybe I don't know.
2284.28s:  Maybe it would write the back or something, but you know, you get the point.
2287.60s:  There's a reason why it's there.
2290.36s:  So that's the exact difference between something like an inefficiency in a mispricing.
2299.16s:  An inefficiency is there for some sort of reason, and we know it's there.
2304.76s:  Post-earnings announcement drift is an example of an inefficiency.
2311.40s:  There are inefficiencies in momentum, triggers, information, indiscreteness is another inefficiency.
2320.48s:  There's lots of market inefficiencies, and they have varying levels of efficacy,
2326.88s:  tradable, window dressing is another known inefficiency.
2331.72s:  So inefficiencies are these things that we know are there that we can capitalize on them.
2337.04s:  We're typically not going to make a ton of money to grab them because they're going to
2341.36s:  be fairly competitive because a lot of people know they're there, but they continue to perpetuate.
2347.60s:  One of them says, Roryn Kitty tweets are inefficiency.
2350.84s:  That's a good question.
2354.44s:  I don't, I would call it a mispricing, but I also can absolutely see it being an inefficiency.
2364.28s:  The only reason why I would consider it a mispricing is because it gets priced away so fast,
2370.72s:  but to your point, it happens, well, not frequently, but semi-frequently.
2379.40s:  The way I view that is when Roryn Kitty tweets, that's when the drunk guy walks out of the
2385.16s:  bar.
2387.96s:  So it's not perpetual, but it is not also a one-time thing, which mispricings don't have
2396.24s:  to be a one-time thing.
2398.04s:  I like that example.
2399.20s:  That's a great example.
2400.56s:  I like thinking about that.
2404.20s:  I appreciate you giving me something to noodle on.
2409.20s:  That's a fun one.
2412.00s:  Cool.
2413.76s:  Off-Poon says, or biotech stocks, that skyrocket between because phase one results are mildly
2422.64s:  positive.
2423.64s:  That's, I wouldn't call that inefficiency.
2427.40s:  The reason why I wouldn't call that inefficiency is because there's a clear compensatory risk.
2434.72s:  If you get those phase one results and they're not good or they're not well received for
2438.00s:  any reason, that same biotech stock is going to crater.
2441.64s:  Now, again, the inefficiency that applies to biotech is volatility risk premiums.
2450.32s:  Volatility risk premiums, because I trade them in biotech all the time.
2453.12s:  It's one of the best places to find them.
2455.56s:  They still generally in the aggregate will overcompensate for the periods that it doesn't
2461.72s:  work, but that's more an volatility perspective versus a price movement perspective.
2468.60s:  Lordopcans says, we both define covered options differently where there's more than one leg.
2473.84s:  Yeah, that's okay.
2474.84s:  Well, it's not, again, it's not more than one leg.
2477.68s:  For that example, Lord's Lothable, you're referring to like verticals so like an offsetting
2482.88s:  leg.
2483.88s:  For example, if I sell this put and then buy the further out of the money put, right?
2490.16s:  So it's not as simple as more than one leg because here's an example of two legs.
2495.56s:  If I sell that put and I sell this call, I now have two legs.
2501.96s:  This is not covered.
2503.36s:  This is a short strangle.
2506.44s:  So I can lose both sides.
2511.40s:  Lord's Lothable says single can be covered or naked, but the covered option has a strike
2515.60s:  and a hundred shares.
2516.60s:  Yep.
2517.60s:  So in that example, it's automatically for the covered call side of the things.
2521.28s:  It's automatically pulling in a share equivalent, right?
2525.44s:  Which is what we talked about in the example earlier for what would define a covered call.
2530.20s:  Right?
2531.20s:  So we'd have a short call long shares.
2532.44s:  So yep, that makes sense.
2535.16s:  But I would just say it's definitely not defined as more than one leg.
2538.72s:  That's incorrect.
2539.72s:  I can have multiple legs, right?
2542.08s:  I can sell this 34-delted put, 26-delted put, 18-delted put, 13-delted put, 9-delted put.
2550.28s:  Okay.
2551.28s:  Well, I ran out of legs, but I have four legs in this one.
2556.68s:  This doesn't cover anything.
2559.44s:  I just have four naked short puts at different strikes.
2563.68s:  So I have multiple legs.
2566.40s:  So yeah, I just wouldn't look at it as the legs.
2568.52s:  I would look at it like we were talking about in the example earlier in the video, the
2572.52s:  context of the position.
2574.64s:  That's what determines if something is covered or not.
2578.88s:  All right.
2587.44s:  Next question.
2590.44s:  Joey says, is sector rotation periodic and considered it inefficiency?
2597.04s:  Yeah, I wouldn't consider it inefficiency because there's beta risk with it.
2601.04s:  Sector rotation strategies don't always win, right?
2604.76s:  So the way to capitalize that would be more of a momentum style thing as compared to
2609.44s:  sector rotations, I think.
2612.80s:  So the next question is, how is implied volatility calculated?
2619.12s:  G36 says black shoals style or voodoo magic.
2623.68s:  I think both of those are applicable.
2627.28s:  Any other guesses?
2631.64s:  Joey says implied volatility is the last unknown from BSM.
2646.12s:  So it's implied from actual price.
2652.48s:  Sort of Vladimir says by algos indirectly.
2664.08s:  Jonathan says is it the probability of movement?
2666.08s:  It's not.
2670.28s:  Policies says it's the volatility we need for a given option price under BSM.
2674.80s:  That's the closest.
2679.76s:  So Joey, the reason why your answer was discounted is because the first part.
2686.20s:  The second part of your answer is completely fine.
2690.68s:  So where we have an implied move from the current or the implied volatility from the current
2699.24s:  price.
2700.48s:  Now it's the reason why I say it's not really the last unknown from BSM.
2705.48s:  It's kind of what we solve for.
2707.36s:  I get your point there.
2708.56s:  I'm just clarifying a small component to it.
2711.52s:  So when we're calculating implied volatility, literally all we're doing is taking the current
2719.00s:  markets pricing of options.
2723.72s:  And we're breaking down the price into its different components.
2728.20s:  And we can use something like the Black Sholes Merton model to isolate the different variables
2733.48s:  because it's a differential equation.
2735.16s:  We can grab the pieces that we need.
2737.80s:  So when we're talking about implied volatility, we're just using option prices from the market.
2745.00s:  That's all.
2746.00s:  And we're backing out.
2747.08s:  You can use Black Sholes Merton completely fine.
2749.16s:  You can find it in other ways as well.
2750.76s:  But I think Black Sholes Merton is probably the most well known.
2754.36s:  So then the next question here is what is forecast volatility?
2765.20s:  And in the meantime, I have a video that goes all into volatility.
2775.00s:  So I just dropped that in there for you.
2784.36s:  Forward looking volatility.
2790.68s:  So as implied, those are both.
2798.04s:  Those are both implied or forward looking.
2800.60s:  So I wouldn't say that personally.
2805.48s:  Any other guesses?
2812.40s:  Analyzed, autoregressive, heteroscedastic conditional.
2817.40s:  Nope, it's not a garsh model.
2820.00s:  G36 says expected move based on historic volatility could be.
2824.92s:  Apollo is the closest prediction.
2827.60s:  So that's the difference.
2829.56s:  So when we're looking at volatility, there are different kinds.
2837.28s:  And one of the kinds of volatility that's really important for us to understand is forecast.
2842.56s:  Now how we get to the forecast, we can use things like garsh models.
2847.88s:  We can use EJ garsh.
2850.16s:  We can use jump diffusion models.
2852.28s:  We can use anything.
2853.52s:  We can flip a coin and forecast volatility.
2857.32s:  The cliff notes though, is that forecasting volatility is literally the act of determining
2864.44s:  for yourself what implied volatility should be for an option.
2870.88s:  Retail traders normally don't do this.
2873.00s:  I do this more out of a scholastic sense.
2877.04s:  You can essentially take the markets pricing as volatility as it's probably much better
2881.80s:  than yours.
2883.60s:  But there's a difference.
2885.32s:  When we're looking at implied volatility, we're just looking at prices and we're pulling
2888.40s:  down what the market is implying.
2891.56s:  forecast volatility is literally when we make our own estimate of what volatility should
2897.64s:  be based on some sort of set model and circumstances.
2903.92s:  So that's the primary difference here.
2908.76s:  Does that make sense?
2909.76s:  The difference between like implied volatility and forecast volatility?
2915.60s:  Does they mean different things?
2929.40s:  What's the next question we do?
2936.28s:  Joey says you can compare the current expiration to the vol smile.
2941.56s:  Well, that's actually kind of a great preamble.
2945.64s:  So we'll see if that's correct, Joey.
2949.60s:  The next question for you is describe the volatility term structure, smile and surface.
2971.56s:  And in the meantime, we can talk about why volatility is important.
2976.44s:  So when we think about the importance of volatility, it's that it is the only unknown component
2987.24s:  that we piece together for an options price.
2993.56s:  Everything else that feeds into an options price is known.
2997.60s:  We know the underlying price.
2999.08s:  We know the strike price.
3000.24s:  We know if it's a caller input.
3001.96s:  We know what the risk free rate is.
3003.44s:  We know if there's a dividend.
3006.04s:  We know the days to expiration.
3007.84s:  I don't know if I said that one already or not, but all of the inputs that go into an
3013.24s:  option price, we know all of them except for one, which is volatility.
3019.36s:  So most retail traders will use the implied volatility based on the market consensus.
3024.96s:  We can forecast our own, but then we have different views that we can take on volatility,
3032.44s:  which is exactly the question I have here.
3035.00s:  So the difference between a volatility term structure, smile and surface, they look at
3041.40s:  slightly different things.
3044.08s:  So Paul says surface, Joey looks like it has the most comprehensive of C. So volatility
3050.56s:  term structure is IV for an expiration.
3055.48s:  Smile would be IV for all in a certain expiration.
3060.00s:  Surface would be extra dimension.
3062.32s:  Okay, close.
3064.00s:  TradeJ says term is across expiration.
3068.44s:  Smile is volacross strikes.
3071.88s:  Surface is combo close.
3074.32s:  I like where we're at with these.
3079.56s:  Many other guesses.
3085.60s:  So if we take a look at vol and we take a look at this, nope.
3094.96s:  That's fine.
3096.20s:  Trying to find one that looks somewhat normal.
3099.12s:  All these are kind of janky.
3100.80s:  That's kind of normal.
3101.80s:  That was the most normal one I found.
3104.24s:  This one.
3105.24s:  Okay.
3107.24s:  So what am I looking at here?
3110.08s:  Am I looking at smile?
3115.00s:  Am I looking at term structure?
3116.52s:  Am I looking at surface?
3119.28s:  What am I seeing here?
3123.60s:  TradeJ might have the answer.
3136.24s:  I think Joey, I think your answer looks correct as well.
3145.44s:  Rees welcome in.
3149.80s:  So what is this?
3152.20s:  Joey says smile.
3153.76s:  TradeJ says smile.
3155.04s:  G36 says smile is correct.
3158.72s:  So when we're talking about a volatility smile, we're going to isolate within an expiration.
3165.80s:  And we're going to look at the volatility across strikes.
3169.92s:  That's all.
3171.52s:  Now if I take a look at, I'm going to try to find something that looks somewhat normal
3178.88s:  here.
3179.96s:  If I take a look at these two points, what is this?
3189.76s:  So we already know what smile is.
3192.92s:  We have two left.
3193.92s:  We have a surface in term structure.
3202.92s:  Term structure.
3203.92s:  Correct.
3204.92s:  An easy way to think about term structure is if we look at a futures contract.
3210.44s:  This is probably one of the simplest ways.
3217.00s:  This is term structure.
3222.48s:  So this is using spot futures prices.
3225.08s:  But you can do this with volatility.
3228.08s:  So this is showing you actually a kink in the term structure.
3231.84s:  This is tradable for the e-many futures.
3236.76s:  But the same exact thing applies when we look at options.
3241.32s:  So now going back to our example in TLT, in this specific scenario, I think it was this
3249.40s:  one that was sort of normal and that one, that's fine.
3252.44s:  So in this scenario, let's do out of the monies.
3256.72s:  Looking at just these two is looking at term structure.
3261.40s:  So we're just looking at volatility at a set point across different time frames.
3267.28s:  So this here, if you plotted the implied volatilities for all of these, this is term structure.
3274.68s:  You can literally visualize this.
3276.92s:  So if you have a y-axis and an x-axis, and on the y-axis, we put a dot here to represent
3283.92s:  18.
3284.92s:  So there's your first dot.
3286.20s:  Then we have another dot down here at 9.
3288.56s:  Then we have another dot up over here at 16.
3291.52s:  Then it goes up to 19.
3293.52s:  I'm drawing you, if you can follow along with the cursor, that is a term structure.
3300.24s:  And then to Joey's point, we can visualize a surface.
3305.68s:  Surface doesn't have to be 3D.
3307.24s:  This is 2D, but this is still a surface.
3309.68s:  I can visualize a volatility surface literally just by using these lines.
3314.56s:  I can look across strike prices.
3317.72s:  I can look across expressions.
3320.92s:  That's what volatility surfaces.
3323.20s:  Now the purpose of turning it into a 3D model is because it's a little easier to consume
3327.44s:  if you're not used to looking at things.
3329.12s:  It's a little higher fidelity.
3330.40s:  It's easier to find things that really stick out.
3333.60s:  But for example, there's a lot of interesting anomalies even in with this, with respect
3338.80s:  to a volatility surface.
3344.72s:  So if we get rid of some of these, let's do this one, do this one, get rid of that one.
3356.36s:  Let's do that one.
3358.56s:  So in example, these two inverting here is strange.
3363.88s:  You normally don't see that.
3364.88s:  There's normally a reason why that happens.
3367.88s:  And it can be for a bunch of different reasons, but stuff like that is tradable.
3372.76s:  So even though this isn't a surface, you can still very easily spot anomalies.
3379.32s:  Once you kind of have a sense of what you're looking for.
3383.00s:  Joey says, how do you feel about this being a line versus plot since we only have discrete
3387.96s:  values at strikes?
3390.20s:  How do I feel about it in terms of what?
3394.68s:  The line itself helps you identify overall shape, even a volatility surface is still connected.
3403.00s:  So it's still going to show you some of these.
3408.68s:  Part of the issue that you will find because these are lines is it can be a little confusing,
3415.00s:  like when you see kinks like these, but again, like the kinks are going to be relative to
3420.44s:  anchor points.
3421.48s:  Right?
3422.24s:  So I can tell you that this is the 81 strike relative to the 80 to the 82.
3427.08s:  Right?
3428.08s:  It's pretty visual in that way.
3431.20s:  So yeah, for me, I don't think there's anything at all wrong with it being a line.
3437.32s:  I actually think it makes it kind of easy to see things.
3439.88s:  Because if you look at a volatility surface, it's actually kind of difficult sometimes
3443.96s:  because it can be very, very noisy.
3448.04s:  Joey says, I see there are strikes between those.
3450.04s:  Yeah, absolutely.
3450.84s:  That's what causes the kinks.
3452.68s:  So in this case, I can tell you that the 81s are priced more expensively than the 80s and the 82s.
3459.96s:  Whether it should or shouldn't be, that's another scenario.
3462.36s:  But I can tell you that it's not following the shape of the price that you see for everything else.
3468.12s:  So it draws my eye.
3471.56s:  All right.
3474.68s:  This one should be fun.
3479.64s:  What function do market makers perform in the stock market?
3487.00s:  I think they're very misunderstood.
3488.84s:  And I'm not like a defender of them to be clear.
3492.04s:  But I think they're very, very misunderstood.
3494.84s:  So that's why I'm asking this.
3497.00s:  Facilitating trades is good.
3498.76s:  Setting the price sort of, not quite.
3501.48s:  And we'll explain why it's not quite.
3503.56s:  But it's not wrong.
3508.52s:  Elon Song says provide liquidity in pricing.
3511.88s:  Ricky says the, the function of robbing him blind.
3514.44s:  Okay, I'll take that.
3516.36s:  Paul says liquidity.
3517.72s:  Reese says liquidity.
3520.28s:  Off-poon says liquidity.
3522.20s:  These are correct.
3523.72s:  The primary function.
3526.92s:  The primary function is to provide liquidity.
3529.24s:  It's actually not to provide prices.
3531.56s:  They inherently provide prices because if they price poorly, they'll get destroyed.
3537.32s:  But if I'm saying their primary job is providing liquidity and not necessarily providing
3544.04s:  prices, how does that work?
3545.32s:  Why would that be the case?
3546.76s:  Why would I differentiate between their job of providing liquidity versus providing prices?
3553.24s:  What provides prices in the stock market?
3561.72s:  Bires and sellers.
3565.08s:  G36 is on it.
3568.12s:  Not just buyers.
3571.08s:  Elon Song says buyers.
3572.28s:  It's not just buyers.
3573.32s:  Joey says actual orders closer.
3576.52s:  Speedrunner says investor psychology provides prices.
3579.00s:  It does not.
3582.36s:  Bires and sellers.
3584.52s:  That's all it is.
3586.68s:  Pricing in our exactly.
3589.48s:  So, Paul Owen Swayte are talking about the function of buyers and sellers.
3595.56s:  Supply and demand.
3597.08s:  It's a consensus driven stock market.
3601.16s:  So, that's how pricing is done.
3602.68s:  So, say for example, let's use this.
3607.48s:  And let's say right now on these puts,
3611.32s:  their bid 136 offered at 140.
3614.76s:  Let's just say for whatever reason,
3618.36s:  let's just say that the market maker is currently pricing these at 145 and 130.
3625.80s:  Are they setting the price in this example?
3628.60s:  If they had these at 130 and these at 145, would they be setting the price here?
3636.28s:  With the idea that these prices are still here, by the way.
3645.16s:  Any guesses?
3648.52s:  They would not be setting the price.
3653.40s:  They would be outside the market.
3656.36s:  So, whoever is currently resting a bid here at 136,
3661.88s:  whether that's a market maker or another retail trader, or whoever's on this side doing the same thing at 140.
3669.48s:  If they had this gem in the market,
3670.84s:  when they changed it, they would have set it for they were getting settled and they decided
3677.16s:  when the future bear their faults.
3678.60s:  Do you agree that if you have a prime margin,
3686.04s:  they are currently really coming from the shop,
3687.88s:  and if they are having fiscal f served run,
3690.84s:  and the your...
3692.38s:  If they are, they are thinking.
3695.78s:  Clare has encountered a su Coin 1 and whether they are going to want the turner.
3699.18s:  order for a market maker to provide liquidity,
3702.86s:  they have to set good prices.
3704.70s:  Otherwise, they're not providing liquidity.
3707.70s:  But the way that they're forced to set good prices
3712.46s:  is by the market forcing their hand.
3715.10s:  Because if I'm in competition with another market maker,
3719.26s:  so if there's another market maker over there,
3722.18s:  and I'm over here, right, two different market makers.
3725.66s:  And I'm trying to make this market
3727.18s:  on these 100 puts in TLT expiring 35 days expiration.
3731.94s:  If I am setting my prices at 36 and 40,
3736.78s:  and the other market maker is at 30, 45,
3742.46s:  they're not collecting any bit ask spread.
3744.26s:  They're not getting any volume, which is one,
3747.58s:  how they maintain their status,
3749.34s:  two, how they maintain preferred status,
3751.46s:  three, how they make a living.
3754.06s:  So there's a natural competition
3756.82s:  among different market making entities
3759.54s:  to price things competitively.
3761.74s:  And again, that's by supply and demand.
3763.38s:  It's not because the goodness of my heart is a market maker.
3766.50s:  I want to make sure these are as fair for everybody.
3768.86s:  If I was the only market maker in town,
3772.18s:  I would set them as wide as I possibly could.
3775.54s:  Why wouldn't I?
3776.74s:  Right, so a great example for this
3778.66s:  is when you're walking through the airport,
3780.22s:  going to another country,
3782.06s:  and you want to exchange money, they're a market maker.
3785.98s:  They're moving two different currencies.
3788.94s:  They decide what they're going to buy the currency at
3791.14s:  and sell the other currency at,
3792.42s:  and they're going to capture the spread.
3794.26s:  But guess what?
3795.26s:  When you're walking through the airport,
3797.26s:  how many alternatives are in there?
3799.30s:  About fucking zero.
3801.06s:  So that's why the transaction rates
3803.74s:  and the conversion rates at places like that
3805.62s:  are straight up abysmal,
3808.02s:  excuse me no competition.
3809.54s:  Now what happens when you walk out of the airport
3812.34s:  and there's three banks on the corner?
3815.18s:  All of a sudden,
3816.70s:  all of a sudden things are way more competitive.
3818.94s:  Those spreads come way down because they need the volume.
3822.34s:  That's how they make their money.
3823.46s:  It's the same exact thing in the markets.
3825.46s:  So the forcing function for market makers
3827.50s:  to price things competitively are other participants
3831.18s:  that will out price them and take the volume
3833.54s:  if they don't do that.
3835.54s:  But their job is to provide liquidity.
3837.58s:  That's how they make a living.
3838.74s:  They're literally scavengers.
3840.78s:  They're not, it's really not like
3842.54s:  this really sexy thing that they get to do.
3844.54s:  It's they can make good money,
3847.66s:  but it is not super fun
3849.90s:  because they are completely relegated to order flow.
3855.18s:  So market makers provide liquidity.
3857.98s:  They are forced, if they're doing a job well,
3860.78s:  to set decent prices.
3862.54s:  But there's no imperative otherwise
3865.26s:  other than the natural supply and demand functions
3868.50s:  of the market.
3869.74s:  That's why when you look at less liquid stocks
3872.66s:  that aren't traded as much,
3874.10s:  the bid S spreads are super wide
3876.18s:  because nobody's in there.
3877.78s:  As competition and as liquidity is floods in,
3881.74s:  it forces more competitive pricing.
3885.78s:  Age says so if the market makers provide extra liquidity
3888.74s:  at a given price point,
3889.70s:  doesn't that affect the ability for people
3891.34s:  to transact beyond the bid S spread
3893.10s:  until the market maker runs out
3894.62s:  and determines the stopgiven liquidity exactly correct?
3896.86s:  That's 100% correct.
3898.66s:  And there are there are reasons why they do that.
3902.22s:  So for example,
3904.66s:  if you take a look at this 104 put,
3907.90s:  if we take a look at the current offered size,
3913.30s:  maybe,
3915.98s:  well, it looks like one by 39 or 390 something,
3919.34s:  I can't tell.
3921.26s:  I wish it would just pop up normally it does.
3923.78s:  Maybe this one, there we go.
3925.46s:  We just got to unclick it.
3927.50s:  Okay, it just doesn't like the 103's.
3929.18s:  I guess we'll do these.
3930.62s:  So or the 104's, take a look at the 103's.
3933.46s:  I have them highlighted right now.
3935.34s:  So you'll see right now,
3936.46s:  they're bid at 71 offered at 74.
3939.58s:  They're bid 71 size 138.
3942.74s:  They're offered 74 size 35.
3946.06s:  They're not size one to one.
3948.30s:  And that's exactly what H is talking about.
3950.78s:  The market maker can try to control their directional risk
3956.42s:  by offering things at different sizes.
3959.90s:  Right?
3960.74s:  So they're saying,
3961.58s:  I'm happy in this case to come in at 71.
3965.54s:  If you want to sell to me there.
3967.62s:  However, I'll take 138 of those.
3970.70s:  But for me selling,
3973.70s:  I only want to let 35 go at that 74.
3976.98s:  And that can be because of what the rest of their book looks like.
3979.38s:  It could be for a million different reasons,
3981.66s:  but that's exactly what that is.
3982.98s:  They get to set not just whatever price they
3985.62s:  think is spare based on volatility,
3988.06s:  but they also get to set what size they can sustain.
3991.90s:  And it's because again,
3994.06s:  market makers are relegated to order flow.
3997.22s:  So one of the things to think about is market makers.
4002.18s:  Their ideal scenario is to be able to buy from somebody
4006.98s:  and sell to somebody essentially at the same time, right?
4010.94s:  That would be absolutely great.
4013.86s:  If I could buy at 71 sell at 74,
4016.14s:  I would do that all day.
4017.74s:  But the problem is is market moves, markets move.
4021.10s:  So if I buy at 71 and then all of a sudden things
4024.66s:  start to plummet for whatever reason,
4026.86s:  well, I just bought at 71,
4028.02s:  but now they're worth 65.
4030.26s:  I don't want to unwind there
4031.78s:  because now I've just locked in a loss on that position.
4034.78s:  So they have to manage their inventory very carefully.
4037.82s:  That's really the most difficult part
4040.18s:  of being a market maker is an effective methodology
4043.54s:  for managing inventory.
4046.34s:  Joey says, I wonder if there's some inefficiency
4048.06s:  between spread and liquidity,
4049.58s:  such as typical spread amount usually equates
4052.26s:  to certain liquidity, maybe if they decrease the spread
4054.54s:  for the same volume.
4058.02s:  Inefficiency between spread and liquidity.
4063.86s:  I don't follow.
4065.94s:  I think you'd have to explain the thought a little bit more.
4069.10s:  Such as typical spread amount usually equates
4071.50s:  to certain liquidity.
4072.34s:  Do you mean in terms of the size they offer?
4074.86s:  It's not based on the spread amount typically.
4077.66s:  Again, that's going to be a much larger function
4080.02s:  of what their book looks like at a given point in time.
4083.10s:  And it also matters if there's other people inside the market.
4085.54s:  Again, like this is a great example.
4086.98s:  It's not just market makers that make markets.
4089.54s:  If there's probably a retail trader
4093.82s:  that is resting a 36 bid and they just want one
4098.58s:  of these 105s.
4100.66s:  That could be a retail trader that's inside the market maker.
4104.30s:  So in this case, you'll notice that these are three
4107.08s:  cents wide, these are only two cents wide.
4109.62s:  So if this is a market maker on the other side of this,
4112.90s:  the market maker could be bidding or offering at 52.
4117.38s:  And they might prefer to be at 48 or 49 down here.
4122.98s:  But there could be another market participant
4125.42s:  that's like, no, I'm good for 50 here.
4128.46s:  So that's, again, that's making markets
4132.46s:  and providing liquidity is not relegated to market makers.
4136.34s:  If you operate inside their bid ask spread
4139.18s:  and rest in order, you're providing liquidity.
4142.90s:  So there's two sides of an options trade
4146.02s:  and there's liquidity consumption and liquidity provision.
4151.10s:  As a retail trader, we typically consume liquidity.
4154.98s:  That's when we come in and we want to sell
4157.30s:  one of these puts, we decide to, we're okay taking it
4160.54s:  at the bid and we lift the bid.
4163.74s:  In that case, you just took somebody's trade, right?
4167.42s:  That was offering their trade.
4168.38s:  You took it and removed that from the book
4170.74s:  that now somebody else can't get at.
4172.82s:  So you consume liquidity.
4175.06s:  But if I'm a trader that's currently resting in offer
4179.74s:  for these 95 puts for 21 cents and I have my order
4183.58s:  out there resting for somebody else to come take,
4187.58s:  I'm providing liquidity.
4190.50s:  It's a difference.
4196.18s:  Lot of me says I was filled on five contracts today
4198.86s:  below the bid, the last price changed,
4202.10s:  but not the bid ask.
4203.30s:  Yeah, that can happen in an instant.
4206.74s:  Something could have moved super fast
4209.26s:  that made somebody want your trade.
4211.38s:  It could have been, I assume you mean for, wait,
4218.54s:  filled on what trade was it, by the way.
4228.34s:  Did you buy or sell?
4232.66s:  Because that will change the response
4235.22s:  I'm thinking of for you.
4241.66s:  I would assume bought.
4247.66s:  Because that would make it interesting.
4251.90s:  Bought puts, yeah.
4253.70s:  So yeah, that could mean something moved at just the right time
4257.42s:  and you happen to catch it in the middle there.
4259.42s:  It could be that your trade as it came across offset
4262.70s:  somebody else's in a way that they liked and they scooped it.
4265.94s:  So I'm going to say,
4267.86s:  there's a bunch of different reasons why it can happen.
4269.90s:  It's obviously not common and generally speaking,
4272.58s:  there's a specific reason why it would occur.
4274.74s:  But I had the inverse example today,
4276.94s:  actually posted about this in the Patreon,
4281.14s:  where there was two things I was trying to fill today.
4284.38s:  I'll tell you what they were.
4289.38s:  WBA and BYND,
4290.98s:  and I'm going to say,
4292.38s:  I'm going to say,
4293.62s:  I'm going to say,
4295.54s:  WBA and BYND,
4298.18s:  and I could identify that the trades
4300.42s:  they were trying to fill today
4301.66s:  were because they were essentially,
4304.10s:  I don't want to call them spoof orders
4306.62s:  because that's kind of a different sort of thing,
4309.50s:  but they were mispriced resting orders.
4313.06s:  And the marketing makers will do that
4315.02s:  so that they're not always showing everybody
4316.58s:  what they're pricing that volns that.
4318.34s:  And the reason why I know it was the cases
4319.90s:  because I came inside their offers
4322.34s:  and I still wasn't filled.
4323.86s:  So it tells me that there was a mispricing there.
4327.42s:  There were resting things at a mispricing.
4329.02s:  That's what led me to them because they looked attractive.
4331.22s:  But then I didn't get a fill because there were a mispricing.
4333.70s:  Nobody wanted to transact at that point.
4335.46s:  And at that, I rested.
4336.86s:  My order's there for a little bit to see if anybody would come scoop them and nobody did.
4340.30s:  So that's an example where, I mean, at that point, I was attempting to provide liquidity.
4346.74s:  But I was looking at something that was like very, very clear that didn't look priced correctly.
4352.54s:  And it was confirmed because I moved inside the bit asked spread closer to their side.
4359.34s:  And I still didn't get a fill.
4361.06s:  So you can learn a lot from the way that fills happen.
4370.54s:  All right, next question.
4375.10s:  For non-delta hedged or gamma hedged options positions.
4381.26s:  What is the most dominant input on the performance of the trade most commonly?
4389.98s:  If we're looking at the option in a vacuum.
4395.58s:  Delta, I take it.
4398.94s:  I would take that answer.
4405.38s:  There's a slightly more precise way that I would frame it personally, but I still would take delta.
4411.06s:  Back down.
4418.06s:  Rory, Teddy, welcome in.
4425.62s:  The question's posted up above.
4428.18s:  It says for non-delta hedged options positions.
4431.46s:  What is the most common dominant input on the performance of the position?
4439.42s:  Move it underlying.
4441.38s:  So G36 has it.
4442.78s:  The reason why I don't say delta, again, it's I understand what you guys mean when you say delta.
4448.98s:  But when we're in this kind of setting, I try to be as accurate as possible.
4454.22s:  And delta is not fully accurate because delta tells us the rate of change of an options premium.
4460.86s:  If you use something like beta, I could go along with it.
4465.18s:  Now in this context, though, it's just the price of the underlying, the directional movement.
4470.74s:  And I know again, that's what you mean by delta.
4472.86s:  But again, in a non-clogical setting, it delta means something else.
4478.26s:  So movement of the underlying would be the primary input.
4486.34s:  Thomas says, could you please say, if you trade zero DTEs and how?
4492.10s:  I do.
4493.46s:  I have a playlist you can check out.
4495.58s:  I'm not going to go into that here because that's not the purpose of this live stream.
4500.34s:  But I'm happy to direct you to this entire playlist that I have on zero DTE option.
4511.22s:  So Thomas, that one is real.
4514.34s:  But yes, I trade zero DTEs essentially every single day, big part of what I do.
4519.42s:  A small amount of the portfolio that goes into it, but a big part of the frequency.
4525.18s:  Cool.
4526.78s:  All right, let's take a look at a couple more.
4530.02s:  And then we'll see if there's any specific questions that you guys want to get into.
4538.26s:  This one.
4542.86s:  Describe the disposition effect.
4545.74s:  Why do you care about it?
4547.86s:  Because believe it or not, you do care.
4549.38s:  Whether you know you care or not is another, that's another question.
4553.10s:  But you do care.
4557.58s:  And I want to know why you care.
4561.98s:  Describe the disposition effect.
4571.82s:  Now for those that don't know, this is a psychology question.
4578.14s:  G36 says willing to not cut losses and take profits too early, impacting returns heavily.
4583.46s:  Yep.
4584.46s:  That's exactly it.
4586.98s:  Vladimir says, I don't even know what it is.
4588.82s:  Yeah, okay, that's why I'm asking the question because it's an important one to know.
4592.62s:  Reese says overconfidence.
4595.18s:  It's not overconfidence.
4596.50s:  That's a little bit different.
4598.30s:  But holding onto losing trades is correct.
4602.54s:  Paulo also has spot on the tendency to cash in, to take profitable trades down too quickly.
4610.50s:  And to let losing trades run.
4613.34s:  So it is a massive psychological function of traders that's very, very well documented and studied.
4622.94s:  And again, this is where a lot of the stuff I try to share with you guys comes from.
4629.90s:  So if you come in here and you go to this my website and if you go to trader decision making cognitive biases,
4636.70s:  this goes through essentially what we're all riddled with.
4642.10s:  And this is one of them.
4645.02s:  So and there's a reason why this is number one at the top.
4649.34s:  And it's because it's something that we all innately want to do.
4654.02s:  But we don't always have a solid mechanism in place to limit the impact.
4660.34s:  So it's the tendency to cut winners too short and let losing trades run.
4666.50s:  So why does this happen?
4668.94s:  Why do we do this?
4670.94s:  Well, walk me through what would lead us to want to cut a winner too fast?
4676.90s:  What's the idea?
4679.98s:  Because there's a very clear thought pattern that goes into that and why it happens.
4686.14s:  It's observable.
4688.58s:  Reese says lock in a win.
4690.22s:  Joey says I don't want to be greedy.
4691.66s:  That's a big one feels good to take profit.
4693.62s:  That's exactly it.
4694.94s:  Lost on another trade and massive.
4697.62s:  Feels bad to lose money.
4698.98s:  Fear of returning into a loser.
4700.66s:  Like literally you guys are hitting all of these individual like and look, look how varied they are.
4705.62s:  Right?
4706.38s:  This is what?
4709.14s:  Ten different comments over the course of a few seconds of all these different emotions
4713.38s:  that we have that lead to us doing this.
4715.90s:  Literally, that's exactly correct.
4718.02s:  It's the fact that there's this cocktail of reasons why taking winning trades down is so
4724.74s:  alluring.
4726.38s:  The other thing to think about is how many times have you heard nobody's ever gone
4732.02s:  broke taking profits?
4735.26s:  It sounds smart, doesn't it?
4737.50s:  It sounds real, real smart.
4739.34s:  Nobody's ever gone broke taking profits.
4741.14s:  It's like, well, yeah, I mean, I guess if you're only taking profits, how would you functionally
4746.22s:  go broke?
4747.22s:  That makes total sense.
4748.86s:  But here's the problem.
4751.06s:  If you're in the process of taking profits, I guarantee you you're in the process of booking
4755.46s:  losses as well.
4757.10s:  You just might not want to look at them.
4759.62s:  So we need to strike a balance here.
4764.30s:  And this is why I emphasize so heavily the concept of expected returns because I show
4772.42s:  examples all the time on how you can have systems with these massive high win rates that still
4780.06s:  don't matter.
4781.30s:  That still lose money in the aggregate.
4785.22s:  So this video here is about probability of profit and expected returns and why expected
4798.10s:  returns are so important.
4799.54s:  This one is about managing options, positions, and expected returns.
4815.54s:  So the process of managing expected returns is literally essential.
4825.86s:  So what I would offer to everybody is that when you're trading, stop worrying about the
4835.10s:  outcome of every one single trade and start thinking way more about the outcome of a
4841.98s:  process.
4843.98s:  Because that's where expected return lies, not in the outcome of an individual trade.
4850.86s:  When we are too concerned about the outcome of an individual trade, this is exactly why
4856.02s:  we walk into the disposition effect.
4860.46s:  Roing Titty says, are there stock therapists?
4863.18s:  That's hilarious.
4864.18s:  There's tons of them.
4865.18s:  This is, believe it or not, like with a lot of the people in the, like my mentoring program,
4871.50s:  we spend so much time going through this stuff.
4874.26s:  And the reason why we spend a lot of time going through this stuff is it sounds weird.
4878.70s:  But like the process of making money trading is, it's literally easy.
4884.90s:  Once you understand how it works, the thing that most of us spend most of our time fighting
4891.26s:  against literally is ourselves.
4896.10s:  Stocks go up, stocks go down.
4899.26s:  Volatility goes up.
4900.94s:  Everybody goes down.
4902.34s:  It's not difficult to measure the probability of those things happening.
4907.06s:  It's literally not difficult.
4909.30s:  What's difficult though is making sure that we're measuring things objectively.
4914.78s:  What's difficult though is that we're not just focusing on the outcomes when we're analyzing
4918.66s:  stuff that we like and we're looking at the overall breadth of data.
4924.06s:  This not difficult is weighing other reference points from other exercises or ideas that
4931.46s:  don't actually matter in this circumstance.
4936.34s:  So literally the process of making money is, is what it is.
4941.14s:  It's not that hard.
4943.02s:  The process of being a successful trader is a completely different prospect.
4947.02s:  And it's because we are straight up overloaded with biases.
4952.38s:  And none of us like looking through these because you start realizing that we're all
4956.14s:  fucked up like football bats.
4957.98s:  And you're like, damn.
4962.06s:  How do I even go about getting over all of this shit?
4966.50s:  And for me, the first part is becoming aware of its existence.
4969.94s:  This is exactly why when you guys hear me talk about trading and markets, I talk about
4974.54s:  them in the way that I do.
4977.10s:  And it's to try and constantly remind myself of my biases and to try to remain as objective
4983.86s:  as possible in my analysis.
4987.66s:  And it's because I know I'm riddled with these kinds of things.
4992.94s:  So also, Roryntitty, the other funny part about your comment is there's a dude that I like
4998.34s:  a lot, his name's Richard Friesen.
5001.50s:  He comes on my podcast periodically.
5003.74s:  We have another, we have another podcast episode coming up.
5011.22s:  So we're going to, and that's exactly what he does.
5013.86s:  He opened up a prop room for a while.
5015.90s:  He trained traders and then essentially he coached them.
5019.70s:  So yeah.
5022.94s:  That is the pitch on cognitive biases.
5030.26s:  Let's take a look at a couple other things.
5037.14s:  And then for those that otherwise, if you have any questions or any specific topics, theories,
5044.50s:  anything like that that you want to take a look at now is the correct time to start
5048.06s:  throwing those in before we wrap up.
5051.62s:  Here's the next question.
5053.78s:  Explain what Bayesian statistical model is or what Bayesian statistics are.
5057.94s:  And the reason I'm asking you this is because if you're a trader, I think this is probably
5063.70s:  the only way to think.
5068.46s:  That's a little lopsided, but that's what I personally think, but I can understand
5073.74s:  how people might not.
5078.30s:  Vladimir says over time, did you move to trade a higher percentage of indices and ETFs
5086.66s:  than single stocks, not a higher percentage, but definitely a higher weighting of the portfolio.
5093.70s:  And that's just because it becomes easier as the portfolio grows to scale, it becomes
5099.38s:  really difficult to find enough things to put individual trades on in like it's doable,
5105.74s:  but it's really, really arduous.
5107.82s:  And then you still have to fight with liquidity on a lot of them.
5112.10s:  It's funny because when you look at options, there's a lot of things that offer options,
5120.54s:  but the number of things that offer liquid options, there's less than a thousand of them.
5125.10s:  And even that is like really generous.
5127.98s:  So your world gets collapsed down really fast as your account grows.
5134.42s:  So one of the issues that you'll find is finding things that you might have an idea on,
5140.70s:  but it becomes untradable because you can't really put on a position that makes sense even
5145.34s:  for what you want.
5148.22s:  So there's nothing at all wrong with trading individual equities or securities.
5155.14s:  It's completely okay.
5157.14s:  But I think it has to be really centered around what makes sense for the trader in their
5163.54s:  book.
5164.54s:  Because even right now, I don't have a ton of trades on.
5167.46s:  I took a bunch down this week.
5168.54s:  I have less than a hundred trades on right now.
5171.26s:  But the overwhelming majority of my exposure is in indices.
5177.34s:  It's in futures.
5179.26s:  And then the residual, I have tons of individual trades on an individual product, but they're
5184.86s:  much, much smaller.
5186.74s:  And it's just because so I can get in at a reasonable price and trades the effects that
5190.18s:  I want to.
5194.54s:  Let's see.
5195.86s:  So for Bayesian modeling is resets updating info when given new updates.
5204.18s:  That's about right.
5206.18s:  Roaring Titty says no idea.
5210.50s:  Never learned statistics or probabilities.
5212.90s:  So I was actually thinking about, do I have, I don't know if I ever made that video.
5216.82s:  I think I have that on my to do list.
5219.14s:  Let me see.
5220.14s:  I got like a basic statistics for traders.
5225.70s:  I don't yet.
5226.70s:  Let me make sure I add that to my to do list.
5230.70s:  Yeah, I have it in here, but I'll move it up.
5236.38s:  So basic statistics for option traders.
5242.70s:  And I mean, you guys already know like I'm very statistics minded.
5246.54s:  So it's like a, it's a massive part.
5249.46s:  How I view the world, how I go about analyzing things.
5253.58s:  It's not even from trading necessarily.
5255.54s:  It's just the way that my brain works in terms of analyzing the world.
5259.58s:  This comes from like the military you frame things in a statistical analysis.
5265.86s:  So the main thing to consider when we talk about something like Bayesian statistical modeling,
5273.66s:  this is the technical component to one of the concepts I highlight hopefully all the
5279.70s:  time for you, which is a phrase I use called strong convictions loosely held.
5286.30s:  All this means is I'm going to go is hard as possible to develop a thesis.
5292.58s:  I'm going to do research.
5294.02s:  I'm going to test ideas.
5295.70s:  I'm going to exhaust the resources available to me at a given point in time to understand
5301.06s:  something.
5302.06s:  Whether that's creating a strategy, whether that's modeling a trade, whatever it is.
5307.10s:  The idea behind Bayesian statistics is once there's new information, you update your prior
5315.06s:  conclusions.
5316.98s:  And this is a giant trap for a lot of traders because as a person, your taught or socially
5324.66s:  influenced that if you change your opinion, then you're wrong.
5329.30s:  You're proving that you're wrong and that's bad.
5332.42s:  People will look at you and be like, oh, they were wrong about that.
5335.42s:  Ha, ha, ha.
5337.42s:  And meanwhile, it's like it's literally the dumbest thing I can think of because one of
5344.14s:  them, like the highest forms of intellect is to be able to have a really well formed idea
5350.86s:  and then pivot as soon as there's something that contradicts the idea.
5355.94s:  The problem is that our ideas and bias becomes part of our identity.
5363.86s:  It becomes part of who you are.
5367.06s:  And if you allow that attachment to happen, it's a fucking disease.
5371.66s:  And you get so stuck in these different things that you've heard that you've researched
5379.74s:  and you believe a lot in and then you're unwilling to update the analysis because it's
5386.18s:  now a representation of all the work you put in, all those people you told about X, Y,
5391.22s:  or Z. And the idea of switching now becomes intolerable.
5397.50s:  That is straight disease.
5400.86s:  In trading, I think you have absolutely have got to adopt the ability to be wrong all
5408.66s:  the fucking time and not care.
5412.38s:  Not care in the least.
5414.46s:  If you're wrong for stupid mistakes, of course, that's care about that a lot, right?
5419.34s:  The things you can control.
5420.94s:  But the things that if you're receiving new data and you're hesitant to update a thesis
5425.46s:  or an idea because you're too attached to your prior despite good evidence to the contrary,
5431.34s:  that's a problem.
5433.14s:  So when I think about stuff like that, I think that traders get wrapped up in yet another
5440.94s:  psychological shortfall like that, which is kind of a problem.
5447.98s:  I'm getting caught up on the chat.
5452.82s:  Wigglywarm says, serious question, I find myself looking at the options chain as a beginner
5456.42s:  selling cash to your puts or covered calls on the next day.
5458.78s:  Price jumps a ton.
5459.78s:  I feel like I'm selling contracts a week early.
5464.06s:  You will you're exhibiting a bunch of different biases, believe it or not.
5469.70s:  So when you're thinking about what you're doing is you're honing in on very specific
5477.66s:  data points for whatever reason.
5485.70s:  So you're using this, you're using this and essentially what's happening in this.
5500.30s:  These are like the, I don't know, the three I would highlight that you're committing
5505.50s:  most readily when I see that.
5508.54s:  Wigglywarm is essentially you have a grossly incomplete data sample that you're drawing
5514.46s:  broad conclusions from.
5516.78s:  And you're using my guess is if you have a trade log, I would guess again, this isn't
5521.90s:  to like throw shade, but my guess is you don't have a trade log that we could look through
5526.62s:  and actually quantify the number of times that that happens.
5531.62s:  And my guess is if we did, the sample would be very small.
5535.90s:  What we would call completely insignificant.
5537.94s:  And again, that's not like throwing shade.
5539.94s:  It's just a statistical term.
5541.26s:  If a sample doesn't have enough occurrences, we would call it statistically insignificant.
5546.54s:  So I think in your scenario, you probably need to paper trade more.
5552.58s:  Again, nobody, I have a video hopefully coming out tomorrow.
5555.54s:  I'm waiting to see if my editor can wrap it up super quick.
5559.58s:  But I don't know if it'll be done.
5565.94s:  Wigglywarm says I've been thinking I need something, but I guess I don't even know
5568.26s:  what to log.
5569.26s:  It's really cool because I have a video about this exact thing.
5574.34s:  Here you go.
5577.90s:  So that video there, it's a little bit old, it's from last year, but it talks about essentially
5583.54s:  creating trading plans, trading logs and literally how to create your own trading documentation
5590.82s:  so that we can track things more effectively as what it boils down to.
5595.86s:  But yeah, I think that's all that's happening with you.
5599.26s:  Roryntitty says you should become a professor at UCSD.
5606.50s:  I think I would hate that.
5608.50s:  Absolutely hate that.
5609.50s:  It's a hilarious idea.
5610.50s:  I do love teaching, but I would hate that.
5613.94s:  I think like collegiate, I don't really, I don't know, man, like I did undergrad and grad.
5619.98s:  I don't mind college, but I much rather do this stuff honestly on YouTube and make it
5624.82s:  way more accessible to people that don't necessarily have the resources to go to college.
5630.30s:  I also think college is price gouge, the living shit out of people which drives me crazy.
5637.34s:  So I mean, and the funniest part is I literally have no professional training at all in finance.
5643.02s:  I mean, I say that all the time, which is hilarious, isn't it?
5646.70s:  I think about that a lot.
5647.70s:  I have a couple people in the mentoring program, like at least three of them that I know that
5653.54s:  have some sort of advanced degree finance economics.
5659.26s:  I even have a ex professional trader from a large bank that's in there, which is just
5667.94s:  classic to me.
5668.94s:  The fact that like I am, I literally am the village idiot.
5671.78s:  I have no professional training in any of this stuff.
5674.58s:  I just have a lot of time and effort that I put into it.
5678.70s:  Like I tell you guys, at least if you look on like the website and stuff, it's well
5683.14s:  over 30,000 hours that I've put into studying and exploring markets.
5688.54s:  If you look at a lot of times in the discord, like if you look at what I, when I post stuff,
5695.46s:  I post stuff, you know, that I'm reading and I'll do it like at night and it's, it's
5700.10s:  hilarious because I'll look over at my wife and she'll be reading like a normal book about
5703.70s:  something and I'm literally reading white papers.
5706.98s:  So yeah, it's just, I am a really different kind of self-taught generally finance, but
5715.02s:  I do apply a lot of the skills that I learn in college specifically with respect to
5719.62s:  like statistics.
5720.94s:  That's probably the most useful thing that I learned in college is statistics.
5727.06s:  Lord Slothable says, learn Greeks.
5728.74s:  I have a playlist for you, my friend.
5731.14s:  That is options 101.
5733.78s:  So in this options 101 playlist, I think you should watch the options video, the intro
5740.78s:  to options video.
5742.30s:  And then I think you should look at there's a video on there specifically on the Greeks.
5746.26s:  Vladimir says, I've talked to an OG pit traders that have zero education beyond high school
5750.98s:  and were as, and were as blue collar as brick layers.
5755.26s:  Yeah, the problem is is like pit trading is completely different.
5759.18s:  And again, that's not to like shit on them.
5761.10s:  But they're edges built in as long as they can keep up with volume and pace, their
5769.06s:  edge is already built in being on the floor.
5771.80s:  So that's why it's so expensive to, well, it used to be so expensive to buy a seat on
5776.58s:  the trading floor is because it literally is giving somebody an edge.
5781.96s:  So yeah.
5785.32s:  I think, I think, yeah, the fact that pit traders are untrained typically, that's like actually
5793.28s:  very common.
5794.68s:  But it's for a specific reason.
5796.36s:  It's because they literally don't need the skill set for what they do.
5802.08s:  Weatley says, thanks so much for being approachable and coming out with a coach of mentality.
5805.28s:  Yeah, happy to.
5806.28s:  I literally love this stuff.
5808.40s:  One of the things the mentor that introduced me to investing back in high school is coming
5813.40s:  out this month to come spend a few days with us.
5816.24s:  And it's like, I look at essentially where my life has gone as a result of him introducing
5821.64s:  me to a couple concepts.
5823.52s:  Then I had an mentor that I kind of worked with online in, in directly, who isn't like
5829.00s:  a personal mentor that I would like call and talk to.
5831.84s:  But I would still extract a lot of information from him.
5835.40s:  And because of people like that, it's like literally has changed the direction of my life
5839.72s:  wholesale.
5841.00s:  So I am one of those people that I really enjoy helping people.
5844.92s:  It makes me feel good.
5846.24s:  And I think it's important to pay forward skills that we have.
5849.08s:  So I literally enjoyed doing this.
5850.80s:  It's super fun.
5852.52s:  Joey says, I met an old professional on the street and said he knew Frank Russell and
5857.84s:  said that I should only trade the spot.
5859.60s:  I mean, that's not a bad.
5861.76s:  It really for like most, if I didn't know somebody from a hole in the wall, I would tell
5867.44s:  them to trade spy too.
5868.92s:  Like if you read the blog post that I made for that one friend that I use is like my general
5873.88s:  introduction to trading for everybody that knows nothing, if you read through that, like
5878.72s:  that's what exactly what I would do is for somebody that doesn't know much about stuff
5883.08s:  and not looking to learn a whole bunch, I put them directly into spy for sure.
5890.08s:  But hopefully we know that that is not the only show on the block at all because it ain't.
5901.96s:  I think that's, I mean, I have way more quiz questions, but that's all I had planned
5906.04s:  for today.
5908.00s:  So if you guys have anything else that you want to hit on, let me know.
5912.08s:  We can tackle those, look through any of that stuff.
5916.44s:  And then otherwise we'll get ready to wrap up in a few minutes.
5920.20s:  Vladimir says retail stock trading has been around a lot longer than the internet.
5925.08s:  My grandfather traded and just checked in nightly news, newspaper.
5927.60s:  Yeah, that's so cool.
5928.60s:  I literally think that that's like such an OG way to trade.
5932.84s:  It's like, yeah, I love that so much.
5935.92s:  I think it's so sick.
5939.48s:  Reese says who you got in the UFC tomorrow.
5941.40s:  That's a great question.
5942.40s:  I think I do think Sean O'Malley will, man, I know he, well, again, probabilistic, right?
5950.04s:  I know Sean O'Malley is the favorite over Marab, but I like Marab a lot.
5953.84s:  I think that he's a really good fighter.
5955.64s:  He's on like a 10 fight win streak.
5957.56s:  So I'm legitimately very curious how Marab will do because Sean is elusive, but if Marab
5969.44s:  can like grapple with him, I think that would be very difficult.
5976.40s:  So yeah, Vialobos says anytime to look at an options trade on GME could wait till Saturday,
5981.96s:  though, yeah, we can take a look.
5984.28s:  Yeah, Vialobo, let me know we want to take a look at happy to.
5988.40s:  Okay, baby.
6000.44s:  Yeah, we got to get the, we got to get the old boss of the outfit.
6007.88s:  He's here ready to go.
6010.76s:  Sorry.
6011.76s:  He does, he does that really cool thing when I asked, watch, watch this.
6016.48s:  If I, I get like a double paw.
6025.48s:  I don't think he's learned the difference between like single paw and multiple paws because
6031.40s:  whenever we go for a paw, you just get both.
6033.56s:  Which I guess is nice.
6035.12s:  It's kind of like, I don't know, it's like a bow go paw.
6040.72s:  Vialobos says, I want to sell a covered call and then buy a long call leap, make money
6048.88s:  on the short term with the sold calls long overall.
6051.56s:  Yeah, so it's kind of like, that's kind of like a ratio call diagonal.
6058.56s:  Yeah, I would consider that like a ratio call diagonal.
6067.08s:  So there's, yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.
6071.56s:  You can absolutely do something like that.
6074.36s:  And I think the volatility in there also looks good.
6077.52s:  So Paul says, what's this breed's temperament like?
6082.72s:  He's a straight homey.
6083.80s:  He just, he lives for the team.
6087.28s:  He's energetic when you are, he's chill when you are like he's, yeah, he's awesome.
6092.40s:  He's a multi-sputle.
6094.28s:  So don't let his, don't let his current hyena appearance because he has a mohawk, put
6101.24s:  a mohawk on him because I think it's sick.
6104.08s:  Don't let that confuse you.
6105.84s:  He's a straight homey.
6106.76s:  Um, so yeah, Vialo, I think that's fine.
6116.36s:  I, the way that I set those up, we can take a quick look.
6119.60s:  You mean, and then Vladimir off Putin says, if you started a series on options trading
6125.36s:  in meme stocks, your subs would hit 100K in a month, that's funny.
6129.32s:  I don't even, I don't look at meme stocks that much.
6132.64s:  That's the problem is like, I like looking at them.
6135.76s:  Especially stuff like GameStop because it's just so interesting to me.
6140.48s:  And I like being a part and trying to help the community learn about options.
6145.36s:  But like from a pragmatic standpoint, it's such a small part of what I do is an options
6150.00s:  trader, right?
6151.00s:  Like the way that I make my money is so, so different.
6154.16s:  And I think for a lot of options traders and meme stocks, I would be trying to convert
6162.08s:  all of them into what I would consider to be hopefully like a more, a higher probabilistic
6169.00s:  approach to like making something because that's the big fear I have for a lot of the
6173.16s:  meme stock traders.
6176.32s:  And that's me unfairly projecting like my hopes for people because who knows, man,
6181.84s:  like some people really might not care and they might just hope that they hit the
6185.04s:  fucking lotto.
6186.04s:  And that's okay.
6188.04s:  Vladimir says my point is that new traders flock to the Reddit meme.
6193.80s:  Yeah, which I think is, I think it's completely fair.
6197.32s:  Yeah.
6198.32s:  I think it's completely fair.
6200.28s:  Vialoba says, does the ratio work if you're using all your shares for covered calls?
6206.16s:  No, you have to maintain a ratio.
6209.44s:  So let's say for example, we have 500 shares of GameStop at Spot Price.
6216.68s:  And then let's say that we wanted to buy some further out of the money options or further
6222.36s:  out in time options.
6223.76s:  Let's say we buy these at the money's here.
6227.16s:  Let's say we get like two of those, maybe three.
6231.68s:  So here our maximum deltas that we have here, 800 deltas.
6237.32s:  So in this case, if I sell five calls against my shares, I maintain a positive ratio here.
6249.04s:  And the reason why I maintain a positive ratio here is because I still have uncapped
6255.72s:  long deltas that can max out to the upside.
6258.32s:  Right?
6259.32s:  So I have 500 deltas from these.
6260.80s:  I get 300 deltas from these.
6262.56s:  I have a maximum of negative 500 deltas from these.
6266.00s:  So then that would give me uncapped 300 deltas.
6268.92s:  But it's all about the ratio.
6271.16s:  Because if you sold eight, well now you have a problem.
6274.80s:  Now you have capped upside because you're at a one to one ratio between total max long
6280.64s:  deltas versus short deltas.
6283.24s:  So it's entirely dependent on the delta ratio that you're maintaining with the trade.
6289.52s:  I get open the door for the pup.
6296.00s:  So yeah.
6305.76s:  If as long as you're thoughtful about that, you can maintain kind of your desired upside
6312.12s:  potential.
6313.12s:  The main thing I would consider though is I would be very, very, very, very reluctant to
6319.20s:  try or to permit my upside being capped on something.
6323.32s:  And the reason why I would be so reluctant to do that is because the primary compensation
6328.52s:  you get for trading stuff like this is upside, unlimited upside.
6335.72s:  So if you start giving that up, that's kind of a problem.
6339.96s:  I got to get cut up on the chat.
6348.20s:  Rowan Titi says, do you show live trades?
6350.20s:  Do you think you could show you live paper trading?
6352.72s:  I don't think so.
6354.64s:  I think I've thought about that and I did it for a little while.
6359.28s:  And what ends up happening is the exact opposite of what my intention is behind that.
6366.60s:  My intention behind anything like that is to try to show people the application of the
6371.60s:  skill set, but showing people while I'm doing it live becomes problematic because I have
6377.96s:  people that just start trying to do what I do.
6381.24s:  And then I start getting hit up with a lot of different emails about asking how they
6387.00s:  should manage a position that they know that I put on.
6389.64s:  And it's like, I want to stay away from that with a not even a 10 foot pole, a fucking
6394.08s:  60 foot pole.
6395.68s:  So what I do now as a bit of a middle ground is for the, for the Patreon folks, what I tend
6402.72s:  to do is like, I'll post in the discord slightly delayed purposefully when I put on different
6410.60s:  trades, not all of them.
6412.96s:  And the other thing I'll do is I'll walk through my actual trades, how I'm managing them,
6419.44s:  how I'm finding them when I do the outlier pro live streams.
6423.64s:  Like that's exactly what I do in those.
6425.76s:  When I do the YouTube live streams, it's more meta talking about the markets trades,
6429.64s:  and questions stuff like that.
6431.32s:  And then the pro live streams are just way more like getting into the exact weeds of
6436.20s:  what I'm doing, but it's not live and it won't be live.
6440.28s:  It's slightly, it's slightly to, yeah.
6445.92s:  So that last one, roaring city for on demand, absolutely.
6450.32s:  Yeah.
6451.32s:  And we've done that before, even in this.
6453.68s:  So yeah, on demand is cool too, because we can do like a previous point in time, right?
6458.92s:  We can pick a random point in time that none of us know what happens and we can play the
6462.46s:  game from there.
6463.46s:  Absolutely.
6464.46s:  That's no problem at all, because that also completely takes away anybody's, you know,
6469.48s:  gumption to copy what I'm doing if we know we're back in 2012, right?
6475.12s:  There's literally no reason to copy anything I'm doing today based on that.
6479.36s:  So yeah, absolutely.
6480.36s:  Paper trading, entirely possible.
6482.12s:  Happy to do that for sure.
6485.84s:  And I've done that before because I think it's kind of fun.
6489.28s:  So yeah, that's a absolutely chill recommendation.
6498.20s:  Paul says, how many active trades do you have at a time?
6500.68s:  I would say on average, somewhere between five and 20, on average, like the overall bulk
6511.04s:  of my trading career, I think it's very common for me to land.
6515.76s:  Between like 20 and 100.
6519.00s:  And I would say like the majority, yeah, the majority is probably like 25 to 50.
6529.48s:  I say average because when the market is just kind of right, if I look across my trading
6534.40s:  career, there's pro long periods of time, because I started trading in 2007.
6539.72s:  There's pro long periods of time where the market was just upsloping to the right.
6543.44s:  So it's about as easy as it gets leveraged long products.
6549.68s:  You don't need that many of them.
6551.56s:  So in those instances, like if I think about the average holding across a trading career,
6555.92s:  it gets skewed by that.
6557.92s:  If I look over from like 2020 to present, it's probably closer to like the like I said,
6564.40s:  maybe 20, 20 to 50 trades at a time, something like that.
6568.96s:  So I don't like over diluting what I do.
6572.88s:  And if I'm putting on more trades, the vast majority of those are actually going to be
6578.08s:  variance risk premiums, volatility risk premiums plays, like just kind of turning things
6582.72s:  out.
6584.32s:  Most of my like capital is committed to a much smaller set of trades, less than 10 for
6589.52s:  sure.
6590.52s:  Absolutely less than 10.
6591.88s:  There will be periods where it's two, there will be periods where it may be five or
6595.40s:  six, but most of the capital is typically tried up in just a handful of core positions.
6600.76s:  And then all the speculative stuff is kind of done in the background as it fits.
6607.96s:  Roaring Titi says you have that many zero DTs simultaneously.
6610.48s:  No, not zero DTs.
6612.52s:  Those are just all different kinds of trades, definitely not limited to zero DTs.
6617.68s:  Zero DTs, I like them.
6621.36s:  I like them for a few things, but they're actually a pretty small part of the total portfolio
6629.76s:  for me.
6631.28s:  So yeah, I definitely run zero DTs like every day, but it's a high frequency trade, but
6637.28s:  it's a low risk allocation trade for me.
6640.96s:  Vladimir Offpun says Eric, I built a spreadsheet using TQs to start pricing.
6650.20s:  Off to beat the returns, even letting it ride through 2002.
6654.52s:  Yeah, I mean, whenever we do something in hindsight, it always looks so beautiful,
6659.60s:  doesn't it?
6660.60s:  But the problem is, again, if we take a look at the actual performance of it, it has a
6666.76s:  lot of problems.
6670.76s:  So if we do something like clear this, we go TQs, we just go 100%.
6680.16s:  And we want to go back, I'll go back as far as this lets me, the 2015.
6685.96s:  So anything you're doing, oh, you mean through 22?
6691.48s:  Yeah, so if you look at the performance of this from inception and you can go back further,
6698.56s:  but to go back further, you just have to create a surrogate, which is completely fine.
6705.48s:  That's what a lot of people do to try to test this over a longer term timeframe.
6709.80s:  But yeah, like it's completely doable.
6713.60s:  But the problem is, is you're going to go through periods that are like horrifically ugly,
6720.00s:  like terribly ugly, right?
6722.08s:  So the worst drawdown here, 79%, and this isn't even like an 0809 drawdown.
6729.92s:  There's some variations of this that you'll look at in an 0809 drawdown that go illiquid,
6738.28s:  that literally blow up.
6740.04s:  So the question then you have to ask yourself is, if you have $10,000 and you watch that
6745.08s:  decline by 80%, like who cares, right?
6748.52s:  It's 10 grand.
6749.88s:  But if you have your life wealth, let's say it's $5 million and you watch that contract
6755.92s:  by 80%.
6757.12s:  I don't think you're sitting in it.
6759.16s:  I don't think anybody's fucking sitting in that.
6760.84s:  I'm not sitting in that.
6761.84s:  There's no way.
6763.32s:  And it's because you are faced with now in uncertainty going forward, right?
6769.68s:  When we back test, it's so easy to find things that perform.
6773.80s:  I can show you back test that perform even better than this.
6776.44s:  That look great.
6777.68s:  But the problem is, is that when we're looking forward into the future, is AI going to
6783.72s:  become regulated?
6784.88s:  Is technology actually not going to be the bell of the ball like it was for the last
6788.84s:  15 years, which has been really the last 25 years almost now?
6792.16s:  It's been, tech has been everything, but does that continue into forever?
6796.76s:  I imagine tech would be highly productive, but I'm just talking about in this scenario,
6802.04s:  tech might not be.
6803.28s:  And especially again, if you have your $5 million that's now down 80% or as it's down
6808.48s:  40%, you're like, shit, I know this went down 80 before.
6811.92s:  And again, if I actually hold this through like an 0809 equivalent when it's not even
6815.80s:  specific to tech, but a broad market meltdown, then am I okay watching my $5 million declined
6822.32s:  by 98% and then my only hope at that point is to just sit and wait for it to recover.
6830.28s:  I don't know, man.
6831.68s:  And a lot of that's also going to depend on your time frame.
6834.44s:  I like leverage ETFs.
6835.76s:  I trade T triple cues, not seeing anything bad about it.
6840.16s:  I think people, I think what you're doing in that context is called, again, let's go
6846.72s:  to the old handy dandy website.
6848.72s:  I'll show you exactly what it's called.
6851.00s:  This one I made up by the way, I don't think this one is actually from anywhere, but this
6855.60s:  one, Goldilocks analysis.
6859.04s:  It's easy to look back and be like, yeah, man, 70% draw down that kind of sucks, but a 34%
6865.20s:  compound annual growth rate.
6866.56s:  Like that's pretty sick.
6868.72s:  So yeah, sure, I'll take a 70% draw down and 80% draw down for a 35% compound annual
6873.88s:  growth rate, but this is looking back in time.
6877.16s:  So like, for example, if I could make the decision today to go back to 2015 and put all of the
6884.36s:  money I had in time into T triple cues, you just let it go.
6887.28s:  Sure.
6888.28s:  Why not?
6889.28s:  No problem.
6890.28s:  Because I know the outcome.
6891.28s:  I know it's still pretty solid, but it's not quite as clear as that because if we take
6896.00s:  a look at something like T triple cues, once you get into three times leverage, you're
6900.32s:  outside of the Goldilocks zone.
6902.72s:  And I don't mean it in terms of Goldilocks analysis.
6904.68s:  I mean, in terms of performance, it still has not gotten back to all time highs.
6909.64s:  It still has not.
6911.24s:  If I look at something like spy, it has and it's posting new highs.
6917.96s:  If I look at a two times leveraged ETF, which is a better long term buy and hold leveraged
6922.28s:  ETF, it did hit new highs fell down.
6925.56s:  But it absolutely beat these previous highs.
6928.64s:  If I look at something like T triple cues, that is not what happened.
6933.52s:  It's the closest it got was within six points or so, but not quite.
6938.20s:  It still hasn't got back to break even from its all time high.
6943.28s:  So volatility drag is a thing.
6947.56s:  And this spreadsheet you have is totally cool.
6949.64s:  Again, I'm not trouncing on leverage ETFs.
6952.44s:  I use them.
6953.76s:  I use them in my retirement accounts for things that I trade less frequently, but I don't
6959.56s:  use three times leveraged because I know I can look at historic market data.
6965.64s:  And I can find that the optimal leverage is typically around like 2.3.
6969.60s:  Now you can create a surrogate 2.3 leverage with something like T triple cues by offsetting
6975.00s:  it with another product and just scaling the positions.
6978.00s:  But it doesn't change the behavior of the product itself, which is a daily leveraged
6981.60s:  product.
6983.12s:  So yeah, I don't hate them at all, but I just think it's so important to understand what
6987.24s:  they are, how they behave, how they fit into things and how we think we might actually
6993.20s:  behave.
6994.20s:  Again, as you watch, prospectively, if you put a bunch of money into it, like the bulk
7001.04s:  of your wealth climbing down, but even 30% is not super great, then you start getting
7008.12s:  into like 50%.
7009.92s:  If that takes you from, again, your $5 million, that takes you down to two and a half, clearly,
7016.44s:  right?
7017.44s:  That's just the math.
7018.44s:  But if you think of that from like a functional standpoint, a livelihood standpoint, that is
7023.60s:  a massive material change in your resources.
7029.12s:  The difference between a $2.5 million net worth and a $5 million net worth is significant,
7034.96s:  absolutely significant.
7036.88s:  So if you're planning on retiring, you have your $5 million, you have a conservative lifestyle
7041.32s:  so you don't need a bunch of money, you can live off of it, you can stand inflation,
7045.24s:  you can stand when costs pop up once in a while, you can do all that with your $5 million
7050.32s:  account if you choose to retire early.
7052.32s:  At a $2.5 million account?
7054.32s:  Probably not.
7055.32s:  Probably not.
7056.32s:  You're going to run out of money more likely than not.
7058.96s:  Unless you're super conservative and stuff like that, it doesn't give you the same playing
7064.12s:  field.
7065.12s:  So again, nothing wrong with leveraged funds, but I think it's so dangerous to look at
7069.60s:  their historic performance and then to over, like look at them with rosy colored glasses,
7077.36s:  rose colored glasses.
7078.36s:  What, where is that saying from?
7080.08s:  What does that even mean?
7081.88s:  Hold on one second, I have to look that up.
7085.36s:  I like to look up things like that.
7087.48s:  What is the origin of rose colored glasses?
7093.20s:  Let's see.
7094.20s:  Rose.
7096.20s:  Rose colored glasses or rose tinted glasses refers to the tenancy and overly optimistic early
7103.88s:  literary use.
7105.60s:  The phrase appeared in literary works during the 19th century.
7110.32s:  One of the earliest uses of the phrase is attributed to Thomas Corlyle, a Scottish philosopher
7116.92s:  and essayist who referred to people seeing the word through rose colored spectacles in
7122.32s:  his work.
7123.32s:  Love that.
7124.32s:  Suggest the metaphor was used in like the 30s and 40s.
7128.52s:  I got to be honest, that's actually like super, super cool.
7132.76s:  Did not know that.
7133.92s:  Vladimir says I'm not suggesting go all in, but so many are skeptical about T-Triple Q.
7140.24s:  Well, I think people are skeptical about leveraged funds because they misunderstand what leverage
7144.12s:  is and what things like volatility to K are.
7147.44s:  A lot of people believe when you're holding something like a volatility or a leveraged asset,
7152.28s:  that is just like falling apart in your hands on a daily basis.
7155.76s:  That's not the case at all.
7157.32s:  There's cost.
7158.72s:  Again, one of the frictions in something like T-Triple Q's is not small.
7162.92s:  It's like a 4% year penalty on your return.
7166.28s:  That's just general cost from the rebalancing.
7169.56s:  It's not like an insignificant hurdle to get over, but that's not the end of the world.
7173.80s:  If you're trading something, that's going up massively.
7177.32s:  This doesn't include volatility to K, which will chew you up to the downside.
7182.12s:  That's why when you're trading something like leveraged ETFs, it's so important to use
7185.56s:  some sort of system.
7187.96s:  Because again, if you go through a bad path, you can get absolutely mangled.
7193.60s:  If you look at this move here, this is no joke.
7195.80s:  This went from 85 down to 48.
7200.80s:  It did that in a month.
7204.04s:  That's a really nasty move.
7208.84s:  If you think about leveraged ETFs, again, they look really good because as of lately,
7214.84s:  they've performed really well.
7216.84s:  But they don't always do that.
7220.00s:  US equity leveraged ETFs, I like them a lot.
7222.64s:  I use things like SSO and QLD all the time myself.
7225.64s:  Like I said, those are my other accounts.
7227.84s:  Because I like two times leveraged for longer term holdings because the drag is less.
7234.84s:  The reward is less, but the standard deviation is different.
7238.48s:  When I look at the performance of something like Teachable Q's, it's fantastic.
7244.80s:  If I look at my compound annual growth rate, which right now is 26%.
7250.88s:  If we look at the compound annual growth rate for Teachable Q's over its lifespan, which
7255.96s:  is a shorter duration than mine to be clear.
7258.64s:  But let's take a quick look.
7260.52s:  Because I think it's what, like low 30s.
7264.36s:  But then if you look at its standard deviation, it's like over 50%.
7269.84s:  Which is essentially like the inverse of what mine is.
7275.72s:  Let me see.
7276.72s:  Clear these.
7277.72s:  I had Teachable Q's back.
7280.72s:  100%.
7282.72s:  Look.
7283.72s:  34% compound annual growth rate.
7290.24s:  Yeah.
7291.24s:  So it absolutely beats me.
7292.72s:  It beats me by 8%.
7294.24s:  Ish, a little under 8%.
7297.20s:  But this is nuts.
7300.20s:  A 58% and a half standard deviation of those returns is fucking crazy.
7307.36s:  So you have to be ready to hold through some really nasty periods.
7311.44s:  If this is the thing that you want to roll with.
7314.24s:  So yeah, I mean, the overall risk in that is there.
7317.72s:  It's there for a reason.
7319.20s:  But yeah, I like leverage ETFs.
7322.04s:  But traders have to figure out what's right for them.
7325.04s:  Right?
7326.04s:  That's what it's come that is literally what it comes down to.
7328.80s:  You got to figure out what's right for you.
7330.52s:  Because this beat my best year, my best year trading was last year.
7333.88s:  And I returned just over 100%.
7335.12s:  It was like 118%.
7336.12s:  That was my best year.
7338.48s:  This is almost double that.
7341.04s:  My worst year was down 4%.
7344.40s:  So I absolutely smash this one.
7348.88s:  So yeah, up to the trader to figure out what's right for them.
7356.76s:  Paul says, what do you use for scanning markets?
7360.12s:  A bunch of stuff.
7361.68s:  I have a video actually that's coming out soon that will go into exactly that for you.
7367.00s:  It's one is it come out.
7368.36s:  It's well right now.
7369.72s:  It's either going to come out tomorrow or it's going to come out next week.
7375.76s:  It really depends on if my editor finishes the paper trading video for tomorrow.
7380.08s:  If he does, paper trading will come out tomorrow.
7382.64s:  And then how I analyze the stock market will be the following week.
7386.28s:  But yeah, I use a ton of stuff.
7388.00s:  I use breath indicators.
7389.76s:  I use indices or relationships between the indices, volume, relative strength.
7396.20s:  I'll use economic cycles.
7397.96s:  I kind of take like a very top down approach.
7400.48s:  It helps me contextualize things pretty well.
7404.04s:  It's a good question though.
7407.96s:  All right, gang.
7412.36s:  That about wraps me up.
7413.60s:  Super fun.
7414.60s:  Love hanging out with you guys tomorrow is the GME live stream.
7417.20s:  We're going to go through the rest of roaring kiddie's trades and then talk about the
7421.08s:  new offerings and hopefully dive further and further into things.
7426.12s:  But as always, if there's anything you want me to take a look at, let me know.
7430.04s:  Be an outlier.
7431.04s:  I'll see you guys around.
7432.64s:  Take care.
