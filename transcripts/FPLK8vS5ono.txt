0.00s: What's up, outliers?
3.56s: Couple of seconds late, how to finish doing a little stretch routine.
8.26s: Try to recharge the old sciatica.
10.84s: Everyone's in a while.
11.84s: I have to lay down for a little bit and try to reset the clock on it before it starts
16.30s: hurting like a mother.
18.00s: What's up, everybody?
20.68s: I hope we are off to a great week.
25.24s: The, I don't know, last trading week was pretty interesting.
28.20s: I got to say.
29.60s: So I'm excited to talk a little bit about that.
32.80s: And we have a couple of questions that were sent in that I want to make sure we hit also.
39.80s: There it is.
40.80s: Like I couldn't see my stuff for a second.
44.44s: Looks like we are up and running.
46.84s: Perfect.
48.84s: Sweet.
49.84s: So let me grab.
59.84s: There was a comment on the post that I want to hit.
61.36s: It was a great question.
64.08s: So for those that don't know, when we use the YouTube studio for some reason, it doesn't
68.12s: let me see community comments.
69.76s: I can only see it on my phone.
71.76s: They'll just read it from the phone.
73.76s: So agenda for today.
75.40s: Pretty simple.
76.84s: What I want to cover first is we do have a quiz that I want to work through with you all.
82.64s: Then I want to take a look at, well, I guess we'll start with some of the questions.
86.64s: Then we'll do the quiz.
87.88s: And then we'll kind of navigate around depending on what conversations come up and what capacity.
92.80s: So this session is kind of like the last few.
95.96s: We're pivoting away from the really structured learning components.
99.92s: If you've missed any of those, go back to the first episode in this whole playlist.
104.60s: And we have literally like a comprehensive rundown of what we've learned so far, which
112.20s: was in the beginning very, very structured, you know about like the basics.
116.12s: So let me grab this chat so I can say hello to everybody.
127.48s: And it looks like Reese is here.
133.00s: Shrej is here.
134.84s: Dr. Zeya's Joey Pollo, H Jonathan and Mary Shell.
141.00s: Beautiful.
142.00s: We got the gang in town.
143.48s: Mary so where's the quiz?
144.68s: I will post it into the chat.
146.32s: So we will look at the quiz together.
148.68s: It's designed that the most of the questions are going to be open.
151.52s: I like open ended questions.
152.92s: I don't like multiple choice.
154.56s: I know that they're easier for like a teacher to grade.
157.56s: But in order to evaluate a thought process, it's much harder to navigate the nuance of
161.72s: things.
163.04s: So yeah, that's why it's a little bit different.
166.56s: And so here's the first question that I do want to hit.
169.40s: I'll throw it out to the chat again.
170.88s: I have to pull it up on the phone because I can't get it from the studio.
175.48s: And it says this is from Lord Slothable, which is a fantastic name.
182.64s: We have to give a shout out to Lord Slothable.
185.48s: And they say, I'm having trouble figuring out the difference between a covered option and
192.36s: a single option where there is only one leg in the strike.
196.92s: Now the last part of that only one leg in the strike, that doesn't make sense, which
200.76s: we'll talk about.
202.44s: But we can definitely grasp on to the meat of this question, which is a covered option
208.28s: versus a single option.
210.76s: So first thing for you, Mr. Lord Slothable, is a covered option and a single option actually
221.40s: are not disparate things.
223.64s: And we'll take a look at an example together.
228.20s: So if we're trading TLT, just because that happens to be what I have up right now.
233.52s: And if we look at a single option, we can do essentially four things for a single option.
240.04s: We can come in here and we can buy a call.
244.40s: We can sell a call.
246.84s: We can buy a put or we can sell a put.
250.80s: Those are all single options.
253.88s: Now all of those single options can have different risk profiles that make them covered or uncovered,
263.84s: which for uncovered, we refer to that as naked.
269.16s: Those are really the two buckets.
270.68s: So you can have a single option that's either covered or naked and it's context dependent.
278.76s: So an example of a covered option is if I go in here to sell this put and I have the
285.36s: cash set aside to buy 100 shares at my strike price.
291.84s: That would be covered.
293.84s: Another example of a covered option, you wouldn't really refer to it as a covered option,
298.48s: but it inherently is so is if you buy that put, it's covered because as soon as you pay
304.96s: your debit, that's your max risk on the trade.
309.56s: It can't lose more than that.
310.92s: That's all there is to it.
312.88s: Now you can have another scenario where if we sell this put and we have a stock position
323.00s: that actually covers us technically.
326.64s: You can do the same thing on the call side.
329.04s: So if I sell a call and it's just a short call, we would call that a naked short call.
338.32s: And that means that we don't have any underlying to cover it.
341.92s: It means that it's just a naked short call.
344.16s: It's an option that's out alone and unafraid.
348.00s: Normally when we refer to naked options, we would refer to that in the context of selling
353.24s: them.
354.56s: And when we're buying them colloquially, we would refer to them as singles, a long option
361.20s: whatever.
362.60s: But the nuances when we're talking about a covered option is normally that's going to
369.28s: be a short option that's paired with something.
373.32s: So for example, if we have a short call and we look at the risk profile on this short
381.08s: call, you'll see that it has unlimited risk because the underlying can go up into
389.88s: perpetuity and there's nothing that stops it.
393.96s: Now we can have a covered call and the context of a covered call would be if we have shares
405.00s: that then cap our risk.
408.40s: That's what a covered call would be.
412.00s: So the way to think about the difference between covered options and single options is covered
418.16s: options typically are going to be short options colloquially like when we're talking about
422.52s: them.
423.52s: There will be short options that have some sort of other trade associated with it that
431.20s: decreases the total risk profile from an unlimited potential risk.
436.80s: Now this idea of like unlimited risk versus defined risk, I actually think it's important
445.96s: to talk about that because this one is actually really confusing to people.
450.44s: So and these are actually some of our quiz questions.
452.64s: So we'll start with your first quiz question here, which is if I sell a put, does this
464.52s: is this undefined risk or is this defined risk?
468.64s: If I sell a put is this undefined risk or defined risk.
472.16s: And the reason I asked this question is you'll you'll get a sense in a second, but I want
475.92s: to root out the difference between how we colloquially talk about options and then what the
483.00s: actual reality is.
486.32s: So naked short put is that risk defined or risk undefined.
496.72s: And he guesses and there's two different answers to this one.
505.56s: Joey says undefined but technically defined since as a floor.
509.64s: Yep, that's correct.
510.64s: So for Cedar Savage is also correct, Robo is also correct.
514.64s: Joey is definitely the most correct out of these.
518.20s: So for Elon songs also correct.
524.12s: So for Cedar Savage, Robo and Elon songs, are you familiar with the second part that
528.84s: Joey is talking about that we refer to it is undefined, but it actually is defined.
537.80s: You guys know why that's the case.
543.76s: And again, this is why I want to talk about this because there's nuance in the language.
550.80s: Robo says no, Elon songs says limited risk, that's it.
554.00s: So a stock can go to zero.
557.68s: Where does it go pass zero?
560.28s: Right?
561.28s: It gets buried.
562.68s: It's not a commodity, something like oil crude oil futures that have a commodity component.
569.20s: They can go negative because there's storage costs.
571.96s: There's transportation costs.
573.68s: There's insurance on the barrels of oil themselves.
578.40s: That is not the case here.
580.24s: So this stock can only go to zero.
583.44s: So we call it undefined risk, but it's not undefined risk.
587.84s: It's completely defined.
589.52s: Sooner or later, this will you go to zero.
593.36s: You can't go below zero with these equities.
596.68s: So does that part make sense with respect to the slight nuance between defined and undefined
603.92s: risk when we're talking about something like a naked short put that we would call it
610.72s: colloquially is undefined risk, but it actually is defined.
616.16s: Vladimir Putin says the strike is the floor, not the strike, but it would be
619.48s: the stock going to zero.
621.92s: That's the floor.
623.16s: Okay, cool.
624.16s: So we're good there.
625.56s: Now what about an inverse scenario?
630.08s: What if we sell a call?
636.68s: Is this defined or undefined?
645.36s: So the same thought processes before.
653.20s: Joey says unlimited.
655.20s: Seater says true undefined.
656.68s: Robo says totally undefined.
658.28s: Policies undefined.
659.28s: Okay, great questions or kind of great inputs.
664.88s: Is there, Lord's Lothable, we hit your, I don't know if you caught the answer, we actually
669.76s: hit your question like right at the beginning.
671.32s: So if you want to rewind, if you missed it, you can go back, check it out.
675.76s: Vladimir Putin says again, covered call, nope, this is just a short call.
679.00s: We're talking about a short call.
680.76s: And so far, Joey, Seater, Robo, Polo, H all say undefined.
689.24s: So here's the follow on question.
694.40s: And again, this is pedantic, but I want the point to be made, because I think it's an
699.36s: important consideration.
702.72s: Are there unlimited resources on planet earth?
708.44s: So if we think about the value of everything that exists, is it unlimited or is there a
717.04s: limited amount of value that exists?
730.36s: Elon Song says yes.
733.36s: Technically limited.
737.36s: Yeah.
738.36s: Seater says the spaceship earth, okay.
745.72s: Limited resource, but we make a value.
748.28s: Joey says sure, but what is the limit?
750.20s: It's actually undefined, but limited.
752.04s: Exactly.
753.04s: Joey has the exact nuance I'm hunting for there.
756.32s: So Polo says if you consider IP, there's no upper bound.
760.56s: Again, when we talk about value, it's not the value that I place on something.
767.56s: I could say my value is Eric is $10 billion.
773.96s: If there's not a counter party that agrees that my value is $10 billion, there's no market.
783.56s: So to your point, I can value myself at whatever I want, but what makes undefined value
790.64s: is the counter party that confirms that value.
795.04s: Otherwise, it's just a number.
796.96s: So all I'm highlighting in this instance, and I use all of the resources in the world
802.76s: as a obviously a really, really far removed example, but the example I'm making is even
810.52s: something like this.
812.60s: At some point becomes defined.
816.44s: We just have no idea where we have no idea where I've never seen a stock go to infinity,
822.76s: obviously, because you can't.
825.00s: So all I'm highlighting is that when we're looking at this idea of defined undefined
832.68s: risk, we use the terms undefined colloquially.
837.84s: We use them as a shortcut, a bypass.
841.72s: It's just a little faster than to say that there's a bunch of value and we don't know where
846.40s: it is.
847.40s: We just say undefined, even to the downside that clearly has a zero, it's the same thing
852.24s: to the upside.
853.24s: Sooner or later, value that you run out of how high a company can achieve a market cap,
859.28s: again, we don't currently have unlimited market cap companies and we never will.
864.04s: Sooner or later, they will hit some sort of pinnacle of value that they can provide before
869.40s: they erode.
871.12s: So that's a really extreme example, not super applicable here.
876.56s: The main point I'm trying to highlight with this example though is the nuance of when
881.12s: we talk about things like defined versus undefined risk.
885.28s: That's all.
886.68s: Each says so then whatever a counterparty is willing to pay above your strike is the
891.88s: upper bound limit willing forced.
894.12s: Yeah, I mean, realistically speaking, this is when I take this into a more realistic
900.32s: example, do you know what your risk is defined to the upside?
904.28s: Because it is defined.
905.40s: It's absolutely defined.
906.76s: I use that first example as an extreme theoretical conversation, but there's a practical
911.64s: answer to this that's very easy.
913.88s: So what's the defined risk to the upside?
917.76s: Because it is defined 100%.
926.16s: And you guess this depends on the plan.
935.20s: Nope, it's not wrong, but that's not the example I'm using.
940.92s: Your broker, your broker will liquidate your account.
944.96s: That's where it's defined.
946.28s: Now where that point is, we'll depend on the broker.
948.68s: We'll depend on the size of the account.
950.12s: It'll depend on the collateral account.
952.36s: Your broker will not let you hold something to infinity, right?
956.40s: Like your risk is still defined.
958.60s: It's not unlimited risk because sooner or later, your broker is going to be like margin
963.96s: requirement is up.
965.20s: Marge requirement is up.
966.80s: Marge requirement exceeds your account value.
969.08s: You are now in a margin call.
970.96s: You have X period of time to add capital before I start liquidating your shit for you.
976.04s: You didn't meet the requirement to plus up your capital.
978.80s: I'm liquidating your account.
980.40s: You're now in a debit to me for X number of dollars.
985.12s: That's where it's defined.
986.44s: So you absolutely can exceed your total account value, but it's not going to go to infinity.
991.00s: Sooner or later, your broker is responsible for the risk.
994.16s: They're literally not going to let it go to infinity.
997.08s: So even when we're looking at something like a covered call, it in no way is undefined
1001.56s: in a practical sense because your broker will not let that happen.
1006.16s: Again, that's the nuance of these things.
1009.12s: There's a completely theoretical component to learning options, which again, you guys,
1014.12s: the theoretical answer is literally on point.
1016.16s: Everybody saying totally undefined.
1017.96s: It is on point because it can go to infinity where that is and where finite resources on
1023.52s: planet Earth run out.
1024.72s: I don't know, but short of that, technically, it can go there.
1029.84s: That would define it at some point.
1031.24s: Again, an undefined point.
1032.32s: So we don't know where it is.
1034.04s: It's not infinite.
1035.44s: But way before we get anywhere near that, your broker is going to close your account done.
1041.32s: So that's the nuance when we're talking about define undefined.
1046.08s: The reason why we care about discussing defined undefined risk profiles is simply because
1051.28s: it helps us understand the behavior of options in a quicker way to synthesize it.
1057.40s: Like that's pretty much it.
1058.40s: It's just a slightly faster way to think about and to discuss options positions.
1064.52s: So G36 is here.
1069.36s: They're getting clapped on spy options.
1071.08s: That happens.
1072.08s: H says God selling naked calls on Burke A and rolling thinking he could get out, which
1079.16s: would be a bastard and a half.
1080.52s: Yeah.
1081.52s: Well, I mean, sooner or later, God just throws tsunami or some shit and then he'll take
1084.52s: care of it.
1085.52s: But yeah.
1086.52s: So yeah, Elon Seng says these are kind of tricky questions.
1089.44s: Yeah, they are.
1090.44s: They're nuanced questions.
1091.64s: We're not at the easy questions.
1092.64s: I have plenty of easy questions.
1094.00s: I'll throw some of those in so that we can get our confidence up.
1098.04s: Here's your first easy question.
1100.76s: So you want to place a bullish trade.
1103.52s: What options structures make sense?
1106.72s: It's about a softball as you can get.
1111.08s: Paul says is the broker liable and if it count is deep, oh, of course.
1114.08s: Yeah.
1115.08s: So the broker is reliable is completely, completely accountable for your risk.
1120.12s: They obviously will pursue you to clear their risk, but they are the, they are the
1126.00s: counterparty.
1127.00s: They are responsible for covering the risk.
1129.28s: That's why you see things like bank runs, slightly different example, but in the example
1134.12s: of a run on a bank, even Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley had the capital, but they weren't
1139.40s: liquid enough to provide the capital fast enough.
1142.44s: And that's what literally caused that bank to go under.
1144.80s: They were completely liable to produce what they needed to produce and they couldn't
1149.92s: produce it.
1150.92s: Although they had the means to do so.
1153.80s: So your broker is 100% on the hook for your risk as a trader.
1160.48s: That's why they're very conservative with their margin requirements because they're not
1165.40s: just going to take your risk for you.
1168.36s: So when we look at something like this and we have this, what is this, a short call in
1173.16s: TLT, right now the broker says, again, this is a pass through IRA account.
1178.44s: So this is regulation team margin a little more strict because it's for an IRA account.
1183.04s: They were saying, I need 1700 bucks for this position for me to call this good.
1189.12s: So yeah, the broker is responsible and they're not going to take the risk for you.
1195.32s: G36 says long call short puts bingo.
1199.12s: Vladimir off Putin says selling put by Nicole.
1201.48s: That's good.
1202.48s: Joey says ratio called Agno long call short put by the stock.
1205.96s: That's good.
1206.96s: H says long call short puts ratio diagonals.
1213.56s: Yep, iron condors called debit spreads.
1216.92s: Yep, put credit spreads also bullish.
1219.08s: Yep, all correct.
1220.52s: We also have things like covered calls, ratio covered calls, covered strangle long futures.
1228.52s: All of those are on the docket.
1230.04s: It polices IC, which I assume is iron condor, I would argue that that is not necessarily
1236.04s: what I would consider bullish.
1238.08s: G36 says collars.
1239.68s: Yeah, I'd give it to give it to that too.
1244.28s: Synthetic longs tons of ways.
1246.24s: Those are all correct.
1249.48s: Good job.
1250.48s: All right.
1251.48s: So that was kind of boring to do like that easy of a question.
1255.36s: So let's get into something more fun, should we?
1258.52s: So this one is still very easy, but we will hopefully zoom in from here and make it a
1269.92s: little more interesting.
1272.40s: So when we're thinking about an options premium, there's two components to it.
1275.52s: What are those two components?
1285.72s: So for Joey and Vladimir off Putin, I would call you both out for the time value component
1297.52s: because if you're going to break it down that way, it's a lit like you open yourself
1304.32s: up for a little more scrutiny, which funny enough, it is my next question, which is this.
1315.48s: Two inputs yield extrinsic value.
1321.32s: So Joey and off Putin have one of them, right?
1326.96s: They both already hit time value.
1330.04s: So exactly.
1331.84s: So Joey's got it.
1333.20s: I'm in volatility bingo.
1335.32s: Good.
1340.36s: For everybody else, does that make sense?
1344.88s: But when we're talking about the premium of an option, does the premium breakdown make
1350.92s: sense?
1352.68s: Okay.
1355.92s: So we're talking about intrinsic value and follow on question.
1362.48s: How do we, how do we figure out an intrinsic value?
1366.36s: How do we calculate that?
1368.16s: What's the path?
1374.88s: It is a pretty straightforward difference between strike and the underlying.
1391.04s: Whether it's in the end of money or not.
1392.48s: So Dr. Zayis is about right.
1396.80s: Chair price minus strike times 100 is incorrect.
1406.36s: Joey says amount in the money.
1407.76s: That's good.
1409.76s: Age says stock price difference for delta value of shares.
1412.88s: That's not correct.
1414.92s: So this is good example.
1416.16s: Let's take a look here.
1418.96s: So if I follow G36's formula and I take the share price, which is 100 and I say,
1426.76s: subtract a strike price of 105.
1429.64s: What do I get?
1433.52s: Get negative five times 100.
1438.68s: So it's not that.
1444.64s: The way that we calculate, Cedar Savage is directly on fleek.
1451.96s: Joey says absolute value.
1453.48s: No, because this isn't five dollars in the money.
1459.48s: G36 says, I guess it was assumed in the money.
1462.60s: Aha.
1463.60s: Well, there's no assumption here.
1466.08s: We're at the basics level.
1468.28s: So this is exactly where we clarify assumptions.
1472.32s: It's it's literally based on how far an option is in the money.
1478.68s: So for calls, the way we calculated is different than puts.
1485.16s: So for what Cedar Savage put above is exactly correct.
1491.16s: Depending on if you have a call or if you get a put, we'll determine if you take strike
1501.68s: price less stock or stock less strike.
1506.28s: So the easier way to think about it is just simply how far in the money are you?
1510.28s: How far in the money is in the option is your option?
1514.44s: That's your intrinsic value.
1516.28s: So if we have a 95 call and the stock is at 100, we would take the stock price of 100,
1525.58s: subtract our strike of 95 for the call, you get five dollars.
1531.28s: That's how far in the money you are over here.
1534.32s: And on the put side, it's just the inverse.
1537.76s: So it's not the same calculation for both.
1540.92s: It's dependent on if it's a call or a put.
1544.04s: Easy is way to think about it is simply how far in the money are you?
1548.76s: That's all.
1551.56s: Cool.
1554.16s: Next question.
1558.20s: This one should be easy.
1565.68s: The question is what option will make more money on a 1% move in a stock?
1572.52s: A 10 delta call or 50 delta call?
1584.16s: And Jonathan says depends on if it's up or down.
1586.52s: It doesn't because you'll notice that that's defined in the question with a plus 1%.
1595.04s: So I see 50s across the board.
1597.24s: Good.
1598.24s: Good, good, good.
1602.72s: So now at what point does that reverse?
1612.08s: But what point does the 10 delta make more than the 50 delta?
1630.04s: After it becomes in the money, incorrect.
1634.44s: And a large, quick move to the upside also incorrect.
1645.04s: Read between the lines.
1648.16s: Think about delta.
1649.40s: What's the highest delta can get?
1655.36s: 1.
1659.68s: Which of those options is going to hit a delta of 1 faster?
1666.68s: 50 delta.
1671.00s: Good.
1673.52s: Jonathan is reading between the lines.
1678.28s: So if I take a look at this 101 call, which is a 50 delta, let's go to the 110 just
1685.64s: for an example.
1687.76s: And right around, I'll throw it down here just to make it easier.
1692.96s: So if I go to 110, my 50 delta is going to make 769.
1698.44s: My 10 delta is going to make 372.
1702.84s: So let's say TLT goes to 200 now.
1706.36s: My 10 delta makes 92.79.
1711.56s: My 50 delta makes 97.54.
1718.00s: So Jonathan is 100% correct.
1720.36s: At no point in time, will the 10 delta overwhelm the 50 delta for a one on one basis?
1731.76s: And it's because our deltas are limited.
1734.64s: The examples that you guys are thinking of when we're considering a large move is when
1740.80s: there are more of the further out of the money options because a lot of times when we compare
1749.04s: these, we'll compare the same cost.
1751.24s: Right?
1752.24s: So this cost a dollar 46.
1753.72s: This costs 21 cents.
1756.12s: So in this case, if I size them to be the same dollar value, then the story is different.
1765.60s: So if we do like seven, age says, but the premium paid, it's only a larger percentage
1775.24s: move on the option.
1776.24s: That's exactly correct.
1777.24s: So your option will show a much, much, much higher percent return on a one for one basis.
1785.12s: If you do the out of the money option, the further out the 10 delta versus the 50 delta,
1790.24s: the 10 delta as I just showed you was going to give you like 9300 bucks a red average.
1795.48s: You only put 21 bucks in to get 9300 bucks in the scenario with the 50 delta, you put
1800.48s: up 146 bucks and you got 97 54.
1803.76s: So on a gross dollar amount, you still made more with the at the money, but the percent
1812.08s: return for the out of the money will be much higher.
1816.96s: The reason why this is so important to understand is because as a trader, you have to be ready
1823.72s: to flow in and out in between percent returns, gross returns, how much you're laying out,
1831.24s: the behavior of what you're laying out, all of that matters a lot.
1836.48s: And traders get too unilaterally minded with their perception of what may or may not
1842.20s: perform better for X, Y or Z reason.
1846.12s: And it's all about structuring things the way that you want them to behave.
1853.04s: This is why when I talk about things like the ratio called the Agnal Strategy that I run
1857.80s: or the ratio put diagonal strategy that I run that the base position is typically in
1864.24s: the money.
1865.24s: And the reason for that is I will get a lower percent return on my money, but I get a better
1870.44s: dollar for dollar move with the underlying.
1872.88s: I will add kicker options if I'm highly convicted that will compound quickly, but those
1878.72s: only work if things move in my favor quickly enough.
1882.92s: And if they don't, then as long as I get a moderate move, then my position still will
1887.76s: probably work out with the higher delta, but it's all a series of trade-offs.
1893.68s: So when we look at this, it's important to understand the way that these two different
1901.52s: things behave around one another.
1908.52s: We're going to be doing a lot of switching between sit and stand and because my prednisone
1913.80s: dosage is coming down today.
1915.48s: So the old, the old herniated disc is playing games with your boy.
1923.40s: H says definitely guilty of honing in on one metric percent versus capital outlay.
1927.44s: This is good food for thought.
1928.68s: Yeah, exactly.
1929.68s: And it's super normal.
1930.68s: Everybody, literally everybody does it.
1932.96s: It is as common as you can imagine.
1935.48s: So that's exactly why we do these exercises.
1937.96s: Okay, cool.
1939.28s: So I think we have that one down.
1941.32s: Let's talk about this next one.
1942.68s: We start to get into slightly more nuanced topics.
1946.48s: What is a stock market inefficiency?
1949.28s: Now this, I'm not going with the textbook definition because there are like some really,
1954.24s: really rigid definitions of it.
1956.00s: I don't care so much about that.
1957.80s: I want to understand the way that we think about inefficiency.
1968.00s: And then I think I have a video I can share on this.
1981.80s: An opportunity.
1982.80s: Okay, I'll take that.
1991.80s: Mispricing capitalized until it's armed out potentially.
1998.40s: Define efficiency, please.
1999.40s: I'm asking, that's, I'm asking you.
2002.68s: That's my question to you.
2010.16s: And the value doesn't match up across platforms.
2012.16s: That could be an example of it.
2020.08s: The adverse ass, not it.
2023.20s: Tom Saudon of who say it doesn't exist.
2025.08s: That's objectively false.
2026.88s: We know that's not true.
2030.28s: Follow says a mispricing, preferably a tradable one.
2033.48s: It could be.
2039.36s: Any other guesses?
2050.80s: When the market has impressed in news events could be.
2056.68s: Dr. Zayn's market price does not equal intrinsic value of the stock.
2059.96s: That's an interesting one.
2060.96s: So I'm actually not sure if that would be considered inefficiency personally because
2066.12s: the markets are discounting mechanisms.
2068.84s: So I literally don't know the answer to that one personally.
2071.52s: I'm not sure that I would consider something not trading at or above intrinsic value in
2076.88s: inefficiency though because I think that markets are designed to be discounting.
2083.96s: So it's a good point.
2085.60s: But so think of it this way.
2090.08s: When we think about like, okay, so from inefficient market hypothesis, inefficiency is when
2098.32s: essentially information is failed to be baked into price.
2103.28s: That's from inefficient market hypothesis, the theoretical definition.
2106.36s: I don't care about that.
2107.36s: That doesn't really matter to me.
2108.92s: I actually much prefer more of the practical definitions for something like inefficiencies
2115.08s: versus mispricings.
2116.96s: So inefficiency for my lens, and this isn't just based on me.
2122.24s: This is like from work of most volatility traders and stuff like that.
2125.80s: You can read Ewan's and Claire's books and he'll talk about the difference between inefficiencies
2130.36s: and mispricings.
2132.00s: And inefficiencies are things that we know are there.
2137.48s: We can see them.
2139.68s: And it's there for a reason.
2141.80s: So Ewan's and Claire has one of the best examples of this that you can think of.
2146.32s: So think of a $20 bill.
2149.32s: And this is his example.
2150.32s: I want to be super clear.
2151.32s: This is Ewan's example.
2152.32s: You can check this out from some of the podcasts that I did with him.
2154.52s: That is a great example.
2155.52s: If you have a $20 bill and you're walking down the side of the sidewalk and you see the
2162.88s: $20 bill outside of a bar and it's like 11 o'clock at night.
2168.84s: That is a mispricing relative to the market.
2173.84s: There's probably a reason why that happened.
2176.20s: There was probably a drunk dude coming out of the bar, fumbling to grab his shit.
2180.96s: He dropped the $20 bill.
2182.78s: You pick it up and then you walk on.
2185.88s: Then if you walk past that bar every single day, is that $20 still going to be there each
2192.56s: time?
2194.56s: Probably not.
2197.12s: That's a mispricing.
2198.64s: Mispricings are things that pop up for some reason or another, but they're typically
2202.60s: short-lived.
2204.96s: Then there's inefficiencies.
2207.68s: And efficiency is like the volatility risk premium.
2211.68s: We know definitively, quantifiably, over a long duration.
2217.40s: We know we mispriced volatility relative to realize volatility.
2223.56s: We know we do it.
2226.36s: That's no secret.
2227.64s: It's been there for literally as long as the stock market's been around.
2231.76s: As efficient as the stock market is, it's still there today.
2236.44s: So the example for that is like if that $20 bill, instead of being on the sidewalk, it's
2242.28s: in the middle of a five lane California highway.
2245.68s: And that $20 bill is out in the middle of the road, flopping around.
2249.04s: You can go grab it.
2250.04s: It's there.
2251.20s: If you're fast enough, you can go grab it, get back to the sidewalk, take your $20,
2255.84s: but there's a risk involved you could get hit by a fucking car.
2260.08s: So we can see the $20 bill.
2261.80s: We know the $20 bill is there, but a lot of people are like, man, it's not worth
2266.00s: $20.
2267.00s: I'd rather not get hit by some 18 year old chick cruising down the highway, texting,
2273.64s: sending snapchats, then running me over as I'm trying to grab my $20 bill.
2277.92s: I already have a herniated disk.
2279.24s: The last thing I need is like a vehicle accident to pile onto that.
2283.24s: Maybe I don't know.
2284.24s: Maybe it would write the back or something, but you know, you get the point.
2287.56s: There's a reason why it's there.
2290.32s: So that's the exact difference between something like an inefficiency in a mispricing.
2299.12s: An inefficiency is there for some sort of reason, and we know it's there.
2304.72s: Post-earnings announcement drift is an example of an inefficiency.
2311.36s: There are inefficiencies in momentum, triggers, information, indiscreteness is another inefficiency.
2320.44s: There's lots of market inefficiencies, and they have varying levels of efficacy,
2326.84s: tradable, window dressing is another known inefficiency.
2331.72s: So inefficiencies are these things that we know are there that we can capitalize on them.
2337.04s: We're typically not going to make a ton of money to grab them because they're going to
2341.32s: be fairly competitive because a lot of people know they're there, but they continue to perpetuate.
2347.60s: Nothing says, Roryn Kitty tweets are inefficiency.
2350.80s: That's a good question.
2354.40s: I don't, I would call it a mispricing, but I also can absolutely see it being an inefficiency.
2364.24s: The only reason why I would consider it a mispricing is because it gets priced away so fast,
2370.68s: but to your point, it happens, well not frequently, but semi-frequently.
2379.40s: The way I view that is when Roryn Kitty tweets, that's when the drunk guy walks out of the
2385.12s: bar.
2387.92s: So it's not perpetual, but it is not also a one-time thing, which mispricings don't have
2396.24s: to be a one-time thing.
2398.00s: I like that example.
2399.20s: That's a great example.
2400.52s: I like thinking about that.
2404.16s: I appreciate you giving me something to noodle on.
2409.16s: That's a fun one.
2411.96s: Cool.
2413.72s: Off-poon says, or biotech stocks that skyrocket between because phase one results are mildly
2422.60s: positive.
2423.60s: That's, I wouldn't call that inefficiency.
2427.36s: The reason why I wouldn't call that inefficiency is because there's a clear compensatory risk.
2434.68s: If you get those phase one results and they're not good or they're not well received for
2437.96s: any reason, that same biotech stock is going to crater.
2441.60s: Now, again, the inefficiency that applies to biotech is volatility risk premiums.
2450.28s: Volatility risk premiums, because I trade them in biotech all the time.
2453.08s: It's one of the best places to find them.
2455.52s: They still generally in the aggregate will overcompensate for the periods that it doesn't
2461.68s: work, but that's more an volatility perspective versus a price movement perspective.
2468.56s: Lordopcans says, we both define covered options differently where there's more than one leg.
2473.80s: Yeah, that's okay.
2474.80s: Well, it's not, again, it's not more than one leg.
2477.64s: For that example, Lord's Lothable, you're referring to like verticals so like an offsetting
2482.84s: leg.
2483.84s: For example, if I sell this put and then buy the further out of the money put, right?
2490.12s: So it's not as simple as more than one leg because here's an example of two legs.
2495.52s: If I sell that put and I sell this call, I now have two legs.
2501.92s: This is not covered.
2503.32s: This is a short strangle.
2506.44s: So I can lose both sides.
2511.36s: Lord's Lothable says single can be covered or naked, but the covered option has a strike
2515.56s: and a hundred shares.
2516.56s: Yep.
2517.56s: So in that example, it's automatically for the covered call side of the things.
2521.24s: It's automatically pulling in a share equivalent, right?
2525.40s: Which is what we talked about in the example earlier for what would define a covered call,
2529.96s: right?
2530.96s: So we'd have a short call long shares.
2532.40s: So yep, that makes sense.
2535.12s: But I would just say it's definitely not defined as more than one leg.
2538.68s: That's incorrect.
2539.68s: I can have multiple legs, right?
2542.04s: I can sell this 34-delted put, 26-delted put, 18-delted put, 13-delted put, 9-delted put.
2550.24s: Okay.
2551.24s: Well, I ran out of legs, but I have four legs in this one.
2556.64s: This doesn't cover anything.
2559.40s: I just have four naked short puts at different strikes.
2563.64s: So I have multiple legs.
2566.36s: So yeah, I just wouldn't look at it as the legs.
2568.48s: I would look at it like we were talking about in the example earlier in the video, the
2572.48s: context of the position.
2574.60s: That's what determines if something is covered or not.
2578.84s: All right.
2587.40s: Next question.
2590.40s: Joey says, is sector rotation periodic and considered it inefficiency?
2597.00s: Yeah, I wouldn't consider it inefficiency because there's beta risk with it.
2601.00s: Sector rotation strategies don't always win, right?
2604.72s: So the way to capitalize that would be more of a momentum style thing as compared to
2609.40s: sector rotations, I think.
2612.80s: So the next question is, how is implied volatility calculated?
2619.08s: G36 says black shoals style or voodoo magic.
2623.64s: I think both of those are applicable.
2627.24s: Any other guesses?
2631.60s: Joey says implied volatility is the last unknown from BSM.
2646.08s: So it's implied from actual price.
2652.44s: Sort of Vladimir says by algos indirectly.
2664.04s: Jonathan says is it the probability of movement?
2666.04s: It's not.
2670.24s: Policies says it's the volatility we'd need for a given option price under BSM.
2674.76s: That's the closest.
2679.72s: So Joey, the reason why your answer was discounted is because the first part.
2686.16s: The second part of your answer is completely fine.
2690.64s: So where we have an implied move from the current or the implied volatility from the current
2699.20s: price.
2700.44s: Now it's the reason why I say it's not really the last unknown from BSM.
2705.44s: It's kind of what we solve for.
2707.32s: I get your point there.
2708.52s: I'm just clarifying a small component to it.
2711.48s: So when we're calculating implied volatility, literally all we're doing is taking the current
2719.00s: markets pricing of options.
2723.68s: And we're breaking down the price into its different components.
2728.16s: And we can use something like the Black Sholes Merton model to isolate the different variables
2733.44s: because it's a differential equation.
2735.12s: We can grab the pieces that we need.
2737.76s: So when we're talking about implied volatility, we're just using option prices from the market.
2744.96s: That's all.
2745.96s: And we're backing out.
2747.04s: You can use Black Sholes Merton completely fine.
2749.12s: You can find it in other ways as well.
2750.72s: But I think Black Sholes Merton is probably the most well known.
2754.32s: So then the next question here is what is forecast volatility?
2765.16s: And in the meantime, I have a video that goes all into volatility.
2774.96s: So I just dropped that in there for you.
2784.32s: Forward looking volatility.
2790.64s: So as implied, those are both.
2798.00s: Those are both implied or forward looking.
2800.56s: So I wouldn't say that personally.
2805.44s: Any other guesses?
2812.36s: Analyzed, autoregressive, heteroskedastic conditional.
2817.36s: Nope, it's not a garsh model.
2819.96s: G36 says expected move based on historic volatility could be.
2824.92s: Hollow is the closest prediction.
2827.56s: So that's the difference.
2829.52s: So when we're looking at volatility, there are different kinds.
2837.24s: And one of the kinds of volatility that's really important for us to understand is forecast.
2842.52s: Now how we get to the forecast, we can use things like garsh models.
2847.88s: We can use EJ garsh.
2850.12s: We can use jump diffusion models.
2852.28s: We can use anything.
2853.48s: We can flip a coin and forecast volatility.
2857.32s: The cliff notes though, is that forecasting volatility is literally the act of determining
2864.40s: for yourself what implied volatility should be for an option.
2870.76s: Retail traders normally don't do this.
2873.04s: I do this more out of a scholastic sense.
2876.92s: You can essentially take the markets pricing as volatility as it's probably much better than yours.
2883.44s: But there's a difference.
2885.20s: When we're looking at implied volatility, we're just looking at prices
2887.92s: and we're pulling down what the market is implying.
2891.40s: Forecast volatility is literally when we make our own estimate of what volatility should
2897.60s: be based on some sort of set model and circumstances.
2903.88s: So that's the primary difference here.
2908.68s: Does that make sense?
2909.52s: The difference between like implied volatility and forecast volatility?
2915.48s: Is they mean different things?
2929.32s: What's the next question we do?
2936.16s: Joey says you can compare the current expiration to the vol smile.
2940.92s: Well, that's actually kind of a great preamble.
2945.60s: So we'll see if that's correct, Joey.
2949.56s: The next question for you is describe the volatility term structure, smile and surface.
2971.48s: And in the meantime, we can talk about why volatility is important.
2976.28s: So when we think about the importance of volatility, it's that it is the only unknown component
2987.08s: that we piece together for an options price.
2992.92s: Everything else that feeds into an options price is known.
2997.40s: We know the underlying price.
2998.96s: We know the strike price.
3000.28s: We know if it's a caller input.
3001.92s: We know what the risk free rate is.
3003.40s: We know if there's a dividend.
3006.00s: We know the days to expiration.
3007.84s: I don't know if I said that one already or not, but all of the inputs that go into an
3013.28s: option price, we know all of them, except for one, which is volatility.
3019.32s: So most retail traders will use the implied volatility based on the market consensus.
3024.92s: We can forecast our own, but then we have different views that we can take on volatility,
3032.40s: which is exactly the question I have here.
3034.96s: So the difference between a volatility term structure, smile and surface, they look at
3041.36s: slightly different things.
3044.04s: So Paul says surface, Joey looks like it has the most comprehensive of C. So volatility
3050.52s: term structure is IV for an expiration.
3055.24s: Smile would be IV for all in a certain expiration.
3059.96s: Surface would be extra dimension.
3062.32s: Okay, close.
3063.96s: TradeJ says term is across expiration.
3068.40s: Smile is all across strikes.
3071.84s: Surface is combo close.
3074.28s: I like where we're at with these.
3079.52s: Many other guesses.
3085.56s: So if we take a look at VAL, and we take a look at this, nope.
3094.84s: That's fine.
3096.16s: Trying to find one that looks somewhat normal.
3099.08s: All these are kind of janky.
3100.76s: That's kind of normal.
3101.76s: That was the most normal one I found, this one.
3105.68s: Okay.
3107.52s: So what am I looking at here?
3110.04s: Am I looking at smile?
3114.96s: Am I looking at term structure?
3116.52s: Am I looking at surface?
3119.24s: What am I seeing here?
3123.56s: TradeJ might have the answer.
3136.20s: I think Joey, I think your answer looks correct as well.
3145.52s: Rees welcome in.
3149.76s: So what is this?
3152.20s: Joey says smile.
3153.72s: TradeJ says smile.
3155.04s: G36 says smile is correct.
3158.72s: So when we're talking about a volatility smile, we're going to isolate within an expiration.
3165.72s: And we're going to look at the volatility across strikes.
3169.76s: That's all.
3171.36s: Now, if I take a look at, I'm going to try to find something that looks somewhat normal here.
3179.84s: If I take a look at these two points, what is this?
3189.64s: So we already know what smile is.
3192.80s: We have two left.
3193.80s: We have a surface in term structure.
3202.72s: Term structure.
3204.52s: Correct.
3205.96s: An easy way to think about term structure is if we look at a futures contract.
3210.36s: This is probably one of the simplest ways.
3216.88s: This is term structure.
3222.40s: So this is using spot futures prices.
3225.00s: But you can do this with volatility.
3228.00s: So this is showing you actually a kink in the term structure.
3231.76s: This is tradable for the e-many futures.
3236.60s: But the same exact thing applies when we look at options.
3241.20s: So now going back to our example in TLT.
3244.60s: In this specific scenario, I think it was this one that was sort of normal and that one.
3251.08s: That's fine.
3252.48s: So in this scenario, let's do out of the monies.
3256.68s: Looking at just these two is looking at term structure.
3261.36s: So we're just looking at volatility at a set point across different time frames.
3267.24s: So this here, if you plotted the implied volatilities for all of these, this is term structure.
3274.64s: You can literally visualize this.
3276.88s: So if you have a y-axis and an x-axis, and on the y-axis, we put a dot here to represent
3283.88s: 18.
3284.88s: So there's your first dot.
3286.20s: Then we have another dot down here at 9.
3288.52s: Then we have another dot up over here at 16.
3291.48s: Then it goes up to 19.
3293.48s: I'm drawing you, if you can follow along with the cursor, that is a term structure.
3300.20s: And then to Joey's point, we can visualize a surface.
3305.64s: Surface doesn't have to be 3D.
3307.20s: This is 2D, but this is still a surface.
3309.64s: I can visualize a volatility surface literally just by using these lines.
3314.52s: I can look across strike prices.
3317.68s: I can look across expressions.
3320.88s: That's what volatility surfaces.
3323.16s: Now the purpose of turning it into a 3D model is because it's a little easier to consume
3327.40s: if you're not used to looking at things.
3329.08s: It's a little higher fidelity.
3330.36s: It's easier to find things that really stick out.
3333.56s: But for example, there's a lot of interesting anomalies even in with this, with respect
3338.76s: to a volatility surface.
3344.68s: So if we get rid of some of these, let's do this one, do this one, get rid of that one.
3356.32s: Let's do that one.
3358.48s: So in example, these two inverting here is strange.
3363.80s: You normally don't see that.
3364.80s: There's normally a reason why that happens.
3367.80s: And it can be for a bunch of different reasons, but stuff like that is tradable.
3372.72s: So even though this isn't a surface, you can still very easily spot anomalies.
3379.28s: Once you kind of have a sense of what you're looking for.
3383.72s: Joey says, how do you feel about this being a line versus plot since we only have discrete
3387.88s: values at strikes?
3391.12s: How do I feel about it in terms of what?
3394.72s: The line itself helps you identify overall shape, even a volatility surface is still connected.
3403.08s: So it's still going to show you some of these.
3408.92s: Part of the issue that you will find because these are lines is it can be a little confusing
3414.88s: like when you see kinks like these, but again, like the kinks are going to be relative
3419.64s: to two anchor points.
3421.52s: Right.
3422.52s: So I can tell you that this is the 81 strike relative to the 80 to the 82, right?
3428.16s: It's pretty visual in that way.
3431.20s: So yeah, for me, I don't think there's anything at all wrong with it being a line.
3437.32s: I actually think it makes it kind of easy to see things.
3439.84s: Because if you look at a volatility surface, it's actually kind of difficult sometimes
3443.92s: because it can be very, very noisy.
3448.08s: Joey says, I see there are strikes between those.
3450.24s: Yeah, absolutely.
3451.24s: That's what causes the kinks.
3452.88s: So in this case, I can tell you that the 81s are priced more expensively than the 80s
3458.16s: and the 82s, whether it should or shouldn't be, that's another scenario.
3462.52s: But I can tell you that it's not following the shape of the price that you see for everything
3467.16s: else.
3468.32s: So it draws my eye.
3470.52s: All right.
3474.64s: This one should be fun.
3479.60s: What function do market makers perform in the stock market?
3487.04s: I think they're very misunderstood.
3489.04s: And I'm not like a defender of them to be clear, but I think they're very, very misunderstood.
3495.04s: So that's why I'm asking this.
3497.12s: Facilitating trades is good.
3499.04s: Getting the price sort of, not quite, and we'll explain why it's not quite, but it's
3504.08s: not wrong.
3505.48s: Elon Song says provide liquidity in pricing.
3512.04s: Ricky says the, the function of robbing him blind.
3514.48s: Okay, take that.
3516.48s: Paul says liquidity.
3517.84s: Reese says liquidity.
3520.52s: Off-poon says liquidity.
3522.36s: These are correct.
3523.92s: The primary function.
3527.04s: The primary function is to provide liquidity.
3529.36s: It's actually not to provide prices.
3531.76s: They inherently provide prices because if they price poorly, they'll get destroyed.
3537.56s: But if I'm saying their primary job is providing liquidity and not necessarily providing prices,
3544.60s: how does that work?
3545.60s: Why would that be the case?
3547.00s: Why would I differentiate between their job of providing liquidity versus providing prices?
3553.44s: What provides prices in the stock market?
3563.08s: Buyers and sellers.
3564.36s: D36 is on it.
3568.40s: Not just buyers.
3569.36s: Elon Song says buyers is not just buyers.
3573.48s: Joey says actual orders closer.
3576.88s: Speedrunner says investor psychology provides prices.
3579.20s: It does not.
3582.80s: Prices and sellers.
3585.12s: That's all it is.
3587.12s: Pricing in our exactly.
3589.64s: So Paul owns way, they are talking about the function of buyers and sellers, supply and
3596.08s: demand.
3597.08s: It's a consensus driven stock market.
3601.36s: So that's how pricing is done.
3602.84s: So say, for example, let's use this.
3607.88s: And let's say right now on these puts, they're bid 136 offered at 140.
3615.04s: Let's just say for whatever example or for whatever reason, let's just say that the market
3620.72s: maker is currently pricing these at 145 and 130.
3625.96s: Are they setting the price in this example?
3628.76s: If they had these at 130 and these at 145, would they be setting the price here?
3636.56s: With the idea that these prices are still here, by the way.
3645.36s: Any guesses?
3659.40s: They would not be setting the price.
3663.16s: They would be outside the market.
3665.96s: So whoever is currently resting a bid here at 136, whether that's a market maker or
3672.84s: another retail trader or whoever is on this side doing the same thing at 140, they're
3678.76s: setting the price.
3680.24s: It's not a market maker.
3682.56s: If for whatever reason, the market maker was wider than this, the market maker is not
3686.40s: set.
3687.40s: They're not currently setting the price.
3688.40s: They're not providing liquidity.
3690.32s: They're outside the market.
3692.64s: So the whole idea here is to understand the difference between liquidity provision and
3696.84s: setting price.
3698.20s: If in order for a market maker to provide liquidity, they have to set good prices.
3704.84s: Otherwise, they're not providing liquidity.
3707.92s: But the way that they're forced to set good prices is by the market forcing their hand.
3715.40s: Because if I'm in competition with another market maker, so if there's another market
3720.72s: maker over there, and I'm over here, right, two different market makers, and I'm trying
3726.04s: to make this market on these 100 puts in TLT expiring 35 days to expiration.
3732.08s: If I am setting my prices at 36 and 40 and the other market maker is at 30, 45, they're
3742.52s: not collecting any bid ask spread.
3744.28s: They're not getting any volume, which is one, how they maintain their status, two, how
3749.80s: they maintain preferred status, three, how they make a living.
3754.12s: So there's a natural competition among different market making entities to price things competitively.
3761.20s: And again, that's by supply and demand.
3763.40s: It's not because the goodness of my heart is a market maker.
3766.44s: I want to make sure these are as fair for everybody.
3768.88s: If I was the only market maker in town, I would set them as wide as I possibly could.
3775.60s: Why wouldn't I?
3776.60s: Right?
3777.60s: So a great example for this is when you're walking through the airport, going to another
3780.76s: country, and you want to exchange money, they're a market maker.
3786.08s: They're moving two different currencies.
3788.92s: They decide what they're going to buy the currency at and sell the other currency at
3792.32s: and they're going to capture the spread.
3794.28s: But guess what?
3795.28s: When you're walking through the airport, how many alternatives are in there about fucking
3799.92s: zero?
3801.08s: So that's why the transaction rates and the conversion rates at places like that are
3805.60s: straight up abysmal, because there's no competition.
3809.60s: Now what happens when you walk out of the airport and there's three banks on the corner.
3815.32s: All of a sudden, all of a sudden things are way more competitive.
3818.92s: Those spreads come way down because they need the volume.
3822.40s: That's how they make their money.
3823.40s: It's the same exact thing in the markets.
3825.48s: So the forcing function for market makers to price things competitively are other participants
3831.08s: that will out price them and take the volume if they don't do that.
3835.56s: But their job is to provide liquidity.
3837.68s: That's how they make a living.
3838.68s: They're literally scavengers.
3840.76s: They're not, it's really not like this really sexy thing that they get to do.
3844.84s: It's, they can make good money, but it is not super fun because they are completely
3851.62s: relegated to order flow.
3855.28s: So market makers provide liquidity.
3858.04s: They are forced, if they're doing their job well, to set decent prices.
3862.60s: But there's no imperative otherwise other than the natural supply and demand functions
3868.36s: of the market.
3869.84s: That's why when you look at less liquid stocks that aren't traded as much, the bid S spreads
3875.00s: are super wide because nobody's in there.
3877.84s: As competition and as liquidity is floods in, it forces more competitive pricing.
3885.88s: Each says so if the market makers provide extra liquidity at a given price point, doesn't
3889.96s: that affect the ability for people to transact beyond the bid S spread until the market maker
3893.84s: runs out and determines the stopgiven liquidity exactly correct.
3896.96s: That's 100% correct.
3898.92s: And there are, there are reasons why they do that.
3902.28s: So for example, if you take a look at this 104 put, if we take a look at the current
3909.08s: offered size, maybe.
3915.80s: Well, it looks like one by 39 or 390 something I can't tell.
3921.24s: I wish it would just pop up normally it does.
3923.88s: Maybe this one.
3924.88s: There we go.
3925.88s: You just got to unclick it.
3926.88s: Okay, just doesn't like the 103's.
3929.12s: I guess we'll do these.
3930.68s: So or the 104's take a look at the 103's.
3933.40s: I have them highlighted right now.
3935.36s: So you'll see right now, they're bid at 71 offered at 74.
3939.68s: They're bid 71 size 138.
3942.76s: They're offered 74 size 35.
3946.08s: They're not size one to one.
3948.32s: And that's exactly what H is talking about.
3950.80s: The market maker can try to control their directional risk by offering things at different
3958.52s: sizes.
3959.52s: Right?
3960.52s: So they're saying I'm happy in this case to come in at 71 if you want to sell to me
3966.40s: there.
3967.56s: However, I'll take 138 of those.
3970.76s: But for me selling, I only want to let 35 go at that 74.
3977.00s: And that can be because of what the rest of their book looks like.
3979.36s: It could be for a million different reasons.
3981.72s: But that's exactly what that is.
3983.00s: They get to set not just whatever price they think is spare based on volatility, but
3988.12s: they also get to set what size they can sustain.
3992.04s: And it's because again, market makers are relegated to order flow.
3997.28s: So one of the things to think about is market makers.
4002.28s: Their ideal scenario is to be able to buy from somebody and sell to somebody essentially
4009.16s: at the same time, right?
4011.32s: That would be absolutely great.
4013.88s: If I could buy at 71 sell at 74, I would do that all day.
4017.76s: But the problem is is market moves, markets move.
4021.20s: So if I buy at 71 and then all of a sudden things start to plummet for whatever reason,
4026.80s: well, I just bought at 71, but now they're worth 65.
4030.20s: I don't want to unwind there because now I've just locked in a loss on that position.
4034.76s: So they have to manage their inventory very carefully.
4037.76s: That's really the most difficult part of being a market maker is an effective methodology
4043.36s: for managing inventory.
4046.28s: Joey says I wonder if there's some inefficiency between spread and liquidity, such as typical
4050.40s: spread amount usually equates to certain liquidity.
4053.08s: You mean like in terms of the size they offer?
4056.88s: It's not based on the spread amount typically.
4058.72s: Again, that's going to be a much larger function of what their book looks like at a given
4064.36s: point in time.
4065.36s: And I think that's one of the most important things that I've ever seen.
4069.36s: I think that's one of the things that I've been saying about the market is that
4074.20s: it's not a lot of the things that I've been doing.
4077.42s: But I think that's the most important thing to do.
4079.88s: Again, of what their book looks like at a given point in time.
4082.58s: And it also matters if there's other people inside the market.
4085.54s: Again, like this is a great example.
4086.96s: It's not just market makers that make markets.
4090.40s: If there's probably a retail trader that is resting a 36 bid and they just want one of
4098.64s: these 105's that could be a retail trader that's inside the market maker.
4104.32s: So in this case, you'll notice that these are three cents wide.
4107.46s: These are only two cents wide.
4109.64s: So the mark, if this is a market maker on the other side of this, the market maker
4113.64s: could be bidding or offering at 52 and they might prefer to be at 48 or 49 down here,
4123.02s: but there could be another market participant that's like, no, I'm good for 50 here.
4128.56s: So that's again, that's mark making markets and providing liquidity is not relegated
4135.22s: to market makers.
4136.48s: If you operate inside their bid ask spread and rest in order, you're providing liquidity.
4142.20s: Right?
4143.20s: So there's two sides of an options trade and there's liquidity consumption and liquidity
4149.60s: provision.
4151.16s: As a retail trader, we typically consume liquidity.
4155.12s: That's when we come in and we want to sell one of these puts.
4158.60s: We decide to we're okay taking it at the bid and we lift the bid.
4163.80s: In that case, you just took somebody's trade, right?
4167.40s: That was offering their trade.
4168.36s: You took it and removed that from the book that now somebody else can't get at.
4172.84s: So you consume liquidity.
4175.16s: But if I'm a trader that's currently resting in offer for these 95 puts for 21 cents
4182.48s: and I have my order out there resting for somebody else to come take, I'm providing liquidity.
4190.32s: It's a difference.
4196.08s: Vladimir says I was filled on five contracts today below the bid.
4200.40s: The last price changed but not the bid ask.
4203.20s: Yeah, that can happen in an instant.
4206.60s: Something could have moved super fast that made somebody want your trade.
4211.28s: It could have been, I assume you mean for, wait, filled on five.
4219.00s: What trade was it, by the way?
4228.36s: Did you buy or sell?
4232.76s: Because that will change the response I'm thinking of for you.
4249.56s: I would assume bought.
4253.80s: Because that would make it interesting.
4257.68s: Bought puts, yeah.
4259.08s: So yeah, that could mean something moved at just the right time and you happen to catch it
4263.88s: in the middle there.
4265.08s: It could be that your trade as it came across offset somebody else's in a way that they
4269.68s: liked and they scooped it.
4271.52s: So yeah, there's a bunch of different reasons why it can happen.
4274.68s: And it's obviously not common and generally speaking, there's a specific reason why it
4279.16s: would occur.
4280.48s: But I had the inverse example today, actually posted about this in the Patreon where there
4288.16s: was two things I was trying to fill today.
4290.64s: I'll tell you what they were.
4295.04s: WBA and BYND.
4298.00s: And I could identify that the trades that I were trying to fill today were because they
4303.04s: were essentially, I don't want to call them spoof orders because that's kind of a different
4307.72s: sort of thing.
4309.12s: But they were mispriced resting orders and the market makers will do that so that they're
4315.00s: not always showing everybody what their pricing, their volsat.
4317.88s: And the reason why I know it was the case is because I came inside their offers and
4323.00s: I still wasn't filled.
4324.84s: So it tells me that there was a mispricing there.
4327.88s: They were resting things at a mispricing.
4329.52s: That's what led me to them because they looked attractive.
4331.88s: But then I didn't get a fill because there were mispriced, nobody wanted to transact
4334.88s: at that point.
4336.20s: And at that, I rested, my order is there for a little bit to see if anybody would come
4339.28s: scoop them and nobody did.
4341.32s: So that's an example where, I mean, at that point, I was attempting to provide liquidity,
4347.60s: but I was looking at something that was like very, very clear that didn't look priced
4352.12s: correctly.
4353.20s: And it was confirmed because I moved inside the bid-ask spread closer to their side and
4359.56s: I still didn't get a fill.
4361.36s: So you can learn a lot from the way that fills happen.
4369.20s: All right.
4371.28s: Next question.
4375.32s: For non-delta hedged or gamma hedged options positions, what is the most dominant input
4386.00s: on the performance of the trade, most commonly?
4390.12s: If we're looking at the option in a vacuum, delta, I'd take it.
4399.00s: I would take that answer.
4402.32s: There's a slightly more precise way that I would frame it personally, but I still would
4409.60s: take delta.
4416.60s: Back down.
4424.08s: Roaring Teddy, welcome in.
4425.56s: The question is posted up above.
4428.12s: It says for non-delta hedged options positions, what is the most common dominant input on
4435.88s: the performance of the position?
4439.36s: Go ahead and move it underline.
4440.36s: There you go.
4441.36s: So G36 has it.
4442.80s: The reason why I don't say delta, again, it's, I understand what you guys mean when you
4447.88s: say delta, but when we're in this kind of setting, I try to be as accurate as possible.
4454.40s: And delta is not fully accurate because delta tells us the rate of change of an options
4459.70s: premium.
4460.98s: If you use something like beta, I could go along with it.
4465.28s: Now in this context, though, it's just the price of the underline, the directional movement.
4470.80s: And I know again, that's what you mean by delta, but again, in a non-clogical setting,
4475.76s: delta means something else.
4478.40s: So movement of the underline would be the primary input.
4486.44s: Thomas says, could you please say, if you trade zero DTEs and how?
4492.08s: I do.
4493.40s: I have a playlist you can check out.
4495.52s: I'm not going to go into that here because that's not the purpose of this live stream, but
4500.48s: I'm happy to direct you to this entire playlist that I have on zero DTE option.
4511.24s: So Thomas, that one is real.
4514.40s: But yes, I trade zero DTEs essentially every single day, big part of what I do.
4519.76s: All amount of the portfolio that goes into it, but a big part of the frequency.
4524.24s: Cool.
4525.24s: All right.
4528.16s: Let's take a look at a couple more and then we'll see if there's any specific questions
4531.92s: that you guys want to get into.
4538.32s: This one.
4543.08s: Describe the disposition effect.
4545.80s: Why do you care about it?
4547.80s: Because believe it or not, you do care.
4549.32s: Whether you know you care or not is another, that's another question.
4553.04s: But you do care.
4557.56s: And I want to know why you care.
4561.96s: Describe the disposition effect.
4571.80s: Now for those that don't know, this is a psychology question.
4578.12s: G36 says willing to not cut losses and take profits too early, impacting returns heavily.
4583.52s: Yep.
4584.52s: That's exactly it.
4587.04s: Vladimir says, I don't even know what it is.
4588.84s: Yeah, okay, that's why I'm asking the question because it's an important one to know.
4592.68s: Reese says overconfidence.
4595.28s: It's not overconfidence.
4596.56s: That's a little bit different.
4598.44s: But holding onto losing trades is correct.
4602.60s: Hollow also is spot on the tendency to cash in, to take profitable trades down too quickly
4610.48s: and to let losing trades run.
4613.44s: So it is a massive psychological function of traders that's very, very well documented
4621.40s: and studied.
4623.00s: And again, this is where a lot of the stuff I try to share with you guys comes from.
4629.98s: So if you come in here and you go to this is my website and if you go to trader decision-making
4634.72s: cognitive biases, this goes through essentially what we're all riddled with.
4642.48s: And this is one of them.
4645.28s: So and there's a reason why this is number one at the top.
4649.44s: And it's because it's something that we all innately want to do.
4654.36s: But we don't always have a solid mechanism in place to limit the impact.
4660.48s: So it's the tendency to cut winners too short and let losing trades run.
4666.60s: So why does this happen?
4669.08s: Why do we do this?
4670.88s: Well, walk me through what would lead us to want to cut a winner too fast.
4677.08s: What's the idea?
4679.08s: Because there's a very clear thought pattern that goes into that and why it happens.
4686.24s: It's observable.
4688.64s: Reese says lock in a win.
4690.24s: Joey says I don't want to be greedy.
4691.80s: That's a big one feels good to take profit.
4693.72s: That's exactly it.
4695.24s: Lost on another trade and massive.
4697.76s: Feels bad to lose money.
4699.12s: Fear of returning into a loser.
4700.76s: Like literally you guys are hitting all of these individual like and look, look how varied
4705.12s: they are, right?
4706.52s: This is what?
4709.32s: Ten different comments over the course of a few seconds of all these different emotions
4713.36s: that we have that lead to us doing this.
4716.04s: Literally, that's exactly correct.
4718.16s: It's the fact that there's this cocktail of reasons why taking winning trades down is
4724.00s: so alluring.
4726.48s: The other thing to think about is how many times have you heard nobody's ever gone
4732.00s: broke taking profits?
4735.44s: It sounds smart, doesn't it?
4737.48s: It sounds real, real smart.
4739.28s: Nobody's ever gone broke taking profits.
4741.12s: It's like, well, yeah, I mean, I guess if you're only taking profits, how would you functionally
4746.16s: go broke?
4747.16s: That makes total sense.
4748.80s: But here's the problem.
4751.00s: If you're in the process of taking profits, I guarantee you you're in the process of booking
4755.40s: losses as well.
4757.08s: You just might not want to look at them.
4759.60s: So we need to strike a balance here.
4764.28s: And this is why I emphasize so heavily the concept of expected returns.
4771.16s: Because I show examples all the time on how you can have systems with these massive high
4778.20s: win rates that still don't matter.
4781.28s: That still lose money in the aggregate.
4785.20s: So this video here is about probability of profit and expected returns and why expected
4798.08s: returns are so important.
4799.52s: This one is about managing options positions and expected returns.
4815.52s: So the process of managing expected returns is literally essential.
4825.84s: So what I would offer to everybody is that when you're trading, stop worrying about the
4835.04s: outcome of every one single trade and start thinking way more about the outcome of a process.
4843.92s: Because that's where expected return lies, not in the outcome of an individual trade.
4850.80s: When we are too concerned about the outcome of an individual trade, this is exactly why
4856.00s: we walk into the disposition effect.
4860.40s: Roing Titty says, are there stock therapists?
4863.12s: That's hilarious.
4864.12s: There's tons of them.
4865.12s: This is, believe it or not, like with a lot of the people in the, like my mentoring program,
4871.48s: we spend so much time going through this stuff.
4874.20s: And the reason why we spend a lot of time going through this stuff is it sounds weird.
4878.64s: But like the process of making money trading is it's literally easy.
4884.88s: Once you understand how it works, the thing that most of us spend most of our time fighting
4891.20s: against literally is ourselves.
4896.04s: Stocks go up, stocks go down.
4899.00s: Volatility goes up.
4900.88s: Everybody goes down.
4902.32s: It's not difficult to measure the probability of those things happening.
4907.04s: It's literally not difficult.
4909.28s: What's difficult though is making sure that we're measuring things objectively.
4914.76s: What's difficult though is that we're not just focusing on the outcomes when we're analyzing
4918.60s: stuff that we like and we're looking at the overall breadth of data.
4924.04s: This not difficult is weighing other reference points from other exercises or ideas that
4931.44s: don't actually matter in this circumstance.
4936.28s: So literally the process of making money is is what it is.
4941.12s: It's not that hard.
4943.00s: The process of being a successful trader is a completely different prospect.
4947.00s: And it's because we are straight up overloaded with biases.
4952.36s: And none of us like looking through these because you start realizing that we're all
4956.12s: fucked up like football bats.
4957.92s: And you're like, damn.
4961.00s: Like how do I even go about getting over all of this shit?
4966.48s: And for me, the first part is becoming aware of its existence.
4969.92s: This is exactly why when you guys hear me talk about trading and markets, I talk about
4974.48s: them in the way that I do.
4977.08s: And it's to try and constantly remind myself of my biases and to try to remain as objective
4983.80s: as possible in my analysis.
4987.64s: And it's because I know I'm riddled with these kinds of things.
4992.92s: So also, Roryntitty, the other funny part about your comment is there's a dude that I like
4998.32s: a lot, his name's Richard Friesen.
5001.48s: He comes on my podcast periodically.
5003.68s: We have another, we have another podcast episode coming up.
5011.16s: So we're going to, and that's exactly what he does.
5013.84s: He opened up a prop room for a while.
5015.84s: He trained traders and then essentially he coached them.
5019.64s: So yeah.
5020.64s: That is the pitch on cognitive biases.
5033.56s: Let's take a look at a couple other things.
5037.08s: And then for those that otherwise, if you have any questions or any specific topics, theories,
5044.48s: anything like that that you want to take a look at now is the correct time to start throwing
5048.32s: those in before we wrap up.
5051.56s: Here's the next question.
5053.72s: Explain what Bayesian statistical model is or what Bayesian statistics are.
5057.92s: And the reason I'm asking you this is because if you're a trader, I think this is probably
5063.68s: the only way to think.
5068.40s: That's a little lopsided, but that's what I personally think, but I can understand
5073.72s: how people might not.
5078.24s: Vladimir says over time, did you move to trade a higher percentage of indices and ETFs
5086.64s: than single stocks, not a higher percentage, but definitely a higher weighting of the portfolio.
5093.68s: And that's just because it becomes easier as the portfolio grows to scale, it becomes
5099.36s: really difficult to find enough things to put individual trades on in like it's doable,
5105.72s: but it's really, really arduous.
5107.76s: And then you still have to fight with liquidity on a lot of them.
5112.08s: It's funny because when you look at options, there's a lot of things that offer options,
5120.52s: but the number of things that offer liquid options, there's less than a thousand of them.
5125.08s: And even that is like really generous.
5127.96s: So your world gets collapsed down really fast as your account grows.
5134.40s: So one of the issues that you'll find is finding things that you might have an idea on,
5140.68s: but it becomes untradable because you can't really put on a position that makes sense even
5145.28s: for what you want.
5148.16s: So there's nothing at all wrong with trading individual equities or securities.
5155.08s: It's completely okay.
5157.12s: But I think it has to be really centered around what makes sense for the trader in their
5163.52s: book.
5164.52s: Because even right now, I don't have a ton of trades on.
5167.40s: I took a bunch down this week.
5168.56s: I have less than a hundred trades on right now.
5171.24s: But the overwhelming majority of my exposure is in indices.
5177.28s: It's in futures.
5179.20s: And then the residual, I have tons of individual trades on individual products, but they're
5184.80s: much, much smaller.
5186.68s: And it's just because so I can get in at a reasonable price and trades the effects that
5190.16s: I want to.
5194.52s: Let's see.
5195.80s: So for Bayesian modeling is resets updating info when given new updates.
5204.12s: That's about right.
5206.12s: Rointit, he says no idea.
5210.48s: Never learned statistics or probabilities.
5212.84s: So I was actually thinking about, do I have, I don't know if I ever made that video.
5216.80s: I think I have that on my to do list.
5219.08s: Let me see.
5220.08s: Like a basic statistics for traders.
5225.68s: I don't yet.
5226.68s: Let me make sure I add that to my to do list.
5230.68s: Yeah, I have it in here, but I'll move it up.
5236.32s: So basic statistics for option traders.
5242.68s: And I mean, you guys already know like I'm very statistics minded.
5246.52s: So it's like a, it's a massive part.
5249.44s: How I view the world, how I go about analyzing things.
5253.56s: It's not even from trading necessarily.
5255.48s: It's just the way that my brain works in terms of analyzing the world.
5259.56s: This comes from like the military.
5261.84s: You frame things in a statistical analysis.
5265.84s: So the main thing to consider when we talk about something like Bayesian statistical
5272.24s: modeling, this is the technical component to one of the concepts I highlight.
5278.64s: Basically, all the time for you, which is a phrase I use called strong convictions loosely
5285.20s: held.
5286.20s: All this means is I'm going to go is hard as possible to develop a thesis.
5292.56s: I'm going to do research.
5293.96s: I'm going to test ideas.
5295.64s: I'm going to exhaust the resources available to me at a given point in time to understand
5301.00s: something, whether that's creating a strategy, whether that's modeling a trade, whatever
5305.40s: it is.
5307.04s: The idea behind Bayesian statistics is once there's new information, you update your prior
5315.28s: conclusions.
5316.92s: And this is a giant trap for a lot of traders because as a person, you're taught or socially
5324.64s: influenced that if you change your opinion, then you're wrong.
5329.28s: You're proving that you're wrong and that's bad.
5332.36s: People will look at you and be like, oh, they were wrong about that.
5335.60s: Aha.
5336.60s: And meanwhile, it's like it's literally the dumbest thing I can think of because one of
5344.10s: them, like the highest forms of intellect is to be able to have a really well formed
5349.44s: idea and then pivot as soon as there's something that contradicts the idea.
5355.88s: The problem is that our ideas and bias becomes part of our identity.
5363.84s: It becomes part of who you are.
5367.04s: And if you allow that attachment to happen, it's a fucking disease.
5371.88s: And you get so stuck in these different things that you've heard that you've researched
5379.72s: and you believe a lot in.
5381.44s: And then you're unwilling to update the analysis because it's now a representation of all the
5387.88s: work you put in, all those people you told about X, Y, or Z.
5392.68s: And the idea of switching now becomes intolerable.
5397.48s: That is straight disease.
5400.84s: In trading, I think you have absolutely have got to adopt the ability to be wrong all the
5408.72s: fucking time and not care.
5412.36s: Not care in the least.
5414.44s: If you're wrong for stupid mistakes, of course, that's care about that a lot, right?
5419.36s: The things you can control.
5420.92s: But the things that if you're receiving new data and you're hesitant to update a thesis
5425.44s: or an idea because you're too attached to your prior despite good evidence to the contrary,
5431.32s: that's a problem.
5433.08s: So when I think about stuff like that, I think that traders get wrapped up in yet another
5440.92s: psychological shortfall like that, which is kind of a problem.
5450.92s: I'm getting caught up on the chat.
5452.68s: Wigglywarm says, serious question, I find myself looking at the options chain as a beginner
5456.36s: selling cash to your puts or covered calls on the next day.
5458.72s: They price jumps a ton.
5459.72s: I feel like I'm selling contracts a week early.
5464.00s: You will, you're exhibiting a bunch of different biases, believe it or not.
5469.64s: So when you're thinking about what you're doing is you're honing in on very specific data
5477.92s: points for whatever reason.
5485.56s: Here.
5488.08s: So you're using this, you're using this and essentially what's happening in this.
5500.28s: These are like the, I don't know, the three I would highlight that you're committing
5505.44s: most readily when I see that.
5508.44s: Wigglywarm is essentially you have a grossly incomplete data sample that you're drawing
5514.40s: broad conclusions from.
5516.76s: That you're using my guess is if you have a trade log, I would guess again, this isn't
5521.88s: like throw shade, but my guess is you don't have a trade log that we could look through
5526.60s: and actually quantify the number of times that that happens.
5531.56s: And my guess is if we did, the sample would be very small, what we would call completely
5536.88s: insignificant.
5537.88s: And again, that's not like throwing shade.
5539.92s: It's just a statistical term.
5541.24s: If a sample doesn't have enough occurrences, we would call it statistically insignificant.
5546.48s: So I think in your scenario, you probably need to paper trade more.
5552.56s: Again, nobody, I have a video hopefully coming out tomorrow.
5555.72s: I'm waiting to see if my editor can wrap it up super quick.
5559.56s: But I don't know if it'll be done.
5565.84s: Wigglywarm says I've been thinking I need something, but I guess I don't even know
5568.24s: what to log.
5569.24s: Yes, totally cool because I have a video about this exact thing.
5573.24s: Here you go.
5577.48s: So that video there, it's a little bit old, it's from last year, but it talks about
5583.04s: essentially creating trading plans, trading logs, and literally how to create your own
5589.60s: trading documentation so that we can track things more effectively as what it boils down
5594.44s: to.
5595.44s: But yeah, I think that's all that's happening with you.
5603.80s: Rointit, he says you should become a professor at UCSD.
5606.44s: I think I would hate that.
5608.48s: Absolutely hate that.
5609.48s: It's a hilarious idea.
5610.48s: I do love teaching, but I would hate that.
5613.88s: I think like collegiate, I don't really, I don't know, man, like I did undergrad and grad.
5619.96s: I don't mind college, but I much rather do this stuff honestly on YouTube and make it
5624.76s: way more accessible to people that don't necessarily have the resources to go to college.
5630.24s: I also think college is price gouge, the living shit out of people which drives me crazy.
5637.32s: So I mean, and the funniest part is, is I literally have no professional training at all
5641.12s: in finance.
5642.12s: I mean, I say that all the time, which is hilarious, isn't it?
5646.64s: I think about that a lot.
5647.64s: I have a couple of people in the mentoring program, like at least three of them that I know
5653.28s: that have some sort of advanced degree finance economics.
5659.24s: I even have a ex professional trader from a large bank that's in there, which is just
5667.92s: classic to me.
5668.92s: The fact that like I am, I literally am the village idiot.
5671.72s: I have no professional training in any of this stuff.
5674.56s: I just have a lot of time and effort that I put into it.
5678.68s: Like I tell you guys, at least if you look on like the website and stuff, it's well over
5683.36s: 30,000 hours that I've put into studying and exploring markets.
5688.52s: If you look at a lot of times in the discord, like if you look at what I, when I post stuff,
5695.44s: I post stuff, you know, that I'm reading and I'll do it like at night and it's, it's
5700.08s: hilarious because I'll look over at my wife and she'll be reading like a normal book about
5703.60s: something and I'm literally reading white papers.
5706.92s: So yeah, it's just, I am a really different kind of self taught generally finance, but
5715.04s: I do apply a lot of the skills that I learn in college, specifically with respect to
5719.60s: like statistics.
5720.88s: That's probably the most useful thing that I learned in college is statistics.
5727.04s: Lord Slothable says, learn Greeks.
5728.68s: I have a playlist for you, my friend.
5731.12s: That is options 101.
5733.72s: So in this options 101 playlist, I think you should watch the options video, the intro
5740.80s: to options video.
5742.24s: And then I think you should look at there's a video on there specifically on the Greeks.
5747.24s: Vladimir says I've talked to an OG pit traders that have zero education beyond high school
5750.96s: and were as, and were as blue collar as brick layers.
5755.16s: Yeah, the problem is is like pit trading is completely different.
5759.12s: And again, that's not to like shit on them.
5760.96s: Pit trading is cool, but their edge is built in as long as they can keep up with volume
5767.40s: and pace.
5768.92s: Their edge is already built in being on the floor.
5771.76s: So that's why it's so expensive to, well, used to be so expensive to buy a seat on
5776.52s: the trading floor is because it literally is giving somebody an edge.
5781.92s: So yeah, I think, I think, yeah, the fact that pit traders are untrained typically, that's
5792.80s: like actually very common, but it's for a specific reason.
5796.32s: Because they literally don't need the skill set for what they do.
5802.04s: Wiggly says thanks so much for being approachable and coming out with a coach of mentality.
5805.24s: Yeah, happy to.
5806.24s: I literally love this stuff.
5808.36s: One of the things the mentor that introduced me to investing back in high school is coming
5813.36s: out this month to come spend a few days with us.
5816.20s: And it's like I look at essentially where my life is gone as a result of him introducing
5821.60s: me to a couple concepts.
5823.48s: Then I had an mentor that I kind of worked with online in, indirectly, it wasn't like
5828.96s: a personal mentor that I would like call and talk to, but I would still extract a lot
5833.64s: of information from him.
5835.40s: And because of people like that, it's like literally has changed the direction of my
5839.44s: life wholesale.
5840.96s: So I am one of those people that I really enjoy helping people.
5844.88s: It makes me feel good.
5846.20s: And I think it's important to pay forward skills that we have.
5849.04s: So I literally enjoy doing this.
5851.04s: It's super fun.
5852.04s: Joey says I met an old professional on the street and said he knew Frank Russell and
5857.80s: said that I should only trade the spot.
5859.56s: I mean, that's not a bad.
5861.72s: It really for like most, if I didn't know somebody from a hole in the wall, I would tell
5867.40s: him to trade spy too.
5868.84s: Like if you read the blog post that I made for that one friend that I use is like my
5872.76s: general introduction to trading for everybody that knows nothing.
5877.76s: If you read through that, like that's what exactly what I would do is for somebody that
5881.96s: doesn't know much about stuff and not looking to learn a whole bunch, I put them directly
5885.84s: into spy for sure.
5890.00s: But hopefully we know that that is not the only show on the block at all because it ain't.
5901.92s: I think that's, I mean, I have way more quiz questions, but that's all I had planned
5906.00s: for today.
5908.00s: So if you guys have anything else that you want to hit on, let me know.
5912.04s: We can tackle those, look through any of that stuff.
5916.40s: And then otherwise we'll get ready to wrap up in a few minutes.
5921.20s: Vladimir says retail stock trading has been around a lot longer than the internet.
5925.04s: My grandfather traded and just checked in nightly news, newspaper.
5927.48s: Yeah, that's so cool.
5928.48s: I literally think that that's like such an OG way to trade.
5932.80s: It's like, yeah, I love that so much.
5935.88s: I think it's so sick.
5939.40s: Reese says who you got in the UFC tomorrow.
5941.36s: That's a great question.
5942.36s: I think I do think Sean O'Malley will, man, I know he, well, again, probabilistic, right?
5949.96s: I know Sean O'Malley is the favorite over Marab, but I like Marab a lot.
5953.72s: I think that he's a really good fighter.
5955.60s: He's on like a 10 fight win streak.
5957.56s: So I'm legitimately very curious how Marab will do because Sean is elusive, but if Marab
5969.36s: can like grapple with him, I think that would be very difficult.
5976.40s: So yeah, Vialobo says anytime to look at an options trade on GME could wait till Saturday.
5981.96s: Though, yeah, we can take a look.
5984.64s: Yeah, Vialobo, let me know we want to take a look at happy to.
5987.48s: Okay, baby.
5988.48s: Yeah.
5989.48s: We're going to get the, we got to get the old boss of the outfit.
6007.84s: He's here ready to go.
6010.84s: Sorry.
6012.84s: He does, he does that really cool thing when I asked, watch, watch this.
6016.44s: If I, I get like a double paw.
6025.44s: I don't think he's learned the difference between like single paw and multiple paws because
6031.36s: whenever we go for a paw, you just get both, which I guess is nice.
6035.04s: It's kind of like, I don't know, it's like a bogeau paw.
6040.60s: Vialobo says, I want to sell a covered call and then buy a long call leap, make money
6048.84s: on the short term with the sold calls long overall.
6051.64s: Yeah.
6052.64s: So it's kind of like, that's kind of like a ratio called diagonal.
6058.64s: Yeah, I would consider that like a ratio called diagonal.
6067.04s: So there's, yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.
6071.52s: You can absolutely do something like that.
6074.36s: And I think the volatility in there also looks good.
6077.48s: So Paul says, what's this breed's temperament like?
6082.72s: He's a straight homie.
6083.72s: He just, he lives for the team.
6087.28s: He's energetic when you are, he's chill when you are like he's, yeah, he's awesome.
6092.40s: He's a multi-sputle.
6094.28s: So don't let his, don't let his current hyena appearance because he has a mohawk, put a
6101.24s: mohawk on him, because I think it's sick.
6104.00s: Don't let that confuse you.
6105.60s: He's a straight homie.
6114.56s: So yeah, Vialobo, I think that's fine.
6117.00s: The way that I set those up, we can take a quick look.
6120.56s: You mean?
6122.04s: Then Vladimir Alpouin says, if you started a series on options trading in meme stocks,
6126.32s: your subs would hit 100K in a month.
6128.56s: That's funny.
6129.56s: I don't even, I don't look at meme stocks that much.
6132.60s: That's the problem is like, I like looking at them, especially stuff like GameStop because
6137.56s: it's just so interesting to me.
6140.48s: And I like being a part and trying to help the community learn about options.
6145.32s: But like from a pragmatic standpoint, it's such a small part of what I do is an options
6149.96s: trader, right?
6151.24s: The way that I make my money is so, so different.
6153.92s: And I think for a lot of options traders in meme stocks, I would be trying to convert
6162.00s: all of them into what I would consider to be hopefully like a more higher probabilistic
6169.24s: approach to like making something because that's the big fear I have for a lot of the
6173.12s: meme stock traders.
6176.40s: And that's me unfairly projecting like my hopes for people because who knows, man, like
6181.92s: some people really might not care and they might just hope that they hit the fucking
6185.32s: lotto.
6186.44s: And that's okay.
6187.44s: Vladimir says, my point is that new traders flock to the Reddit meme, yeah, which I think
6194.60s: is, I think it's completely fair.
6197.32s: Yeah.
6198.32s: I think it's completely fair.
6201.24s: Vialova says, does the ratio work if you're using all your shares recovered calls?
6206.36s: No, you have to maintain a ratio.
6209.44s: So let's say for example, we have 500 shares of game stop at spot price.
6216.64s: And then let's say that we wanted to buy some further out of the money options or further
6222.36s: out in time options.
6223.36s: Let's say we buy these at the money's here.
6227.16s: Let's see, we get like two of those, maybe three.
6231.64s: So here, our maximum delta is that we have here 800 delta's.
6237.28s: So in this case, if I sell five calls against my shares, I maintain a positive ratio here.
6249.00s: And the reason why I maintain a positive ratio here is because I still have uncapped
6255.68s: long delta's that can max out to the upside, right?
6258.68s: So I have 500 delta's from these, get 300 delta's from these.
6262.52s: I have a maximum of negative 500 delta's from these.
6265.92s: So then that would give me uncapped 300 delta's, but it's all about the ratio because if
6271.52s: you, if you sold eight, well, now you have a problem.
6274.76s: Now you have capped upside because you're out of one to one ratio between total max long
6280.60s: delta's versus short delta's.
6283.20s: So it's entirely, entirely dependent on the delta ratio that you're maintaining with
6288.92s: the trade.
6289.92s: I got to open the door for the pup.
6302.48s: So yeah.
6305.72s: If as long as you're thoughtful about that, you can maintain kind of your desired upside
6312.08s: potential.
6313.08s: And I would consider though, is I would be very, very, very, very, very reluctant to try
6319.88s: or to permit my upside being capped on something.
6323.40s: And the reason why I would be so reluctant to do that is because the primary compensation
6328.48s: you get for trading stuff like this is upside, unlimited upside.
6335.68s: So if you start giving that up, that's kind of a problem.
6342.68s: I got to get caught up on the chat.
6348.16s: Rowan Titi says, do you show live trades?
6350.16s: Do you think you could show you live paper trading?
6352.24s: No, I don't think so.
6354.68s: I think I've thought about that and I did it for a little while.
6359.28s: And what ends up happening is the exact opposite of what my intention is behind that.
6366.60s: My intention behind anything like that is to try to show people the application of the
6371.60s: skill set, but showing people while I'm doing it live becomes problematic because I have
6377.96s: people that just start trying to do what I do.
6381.28s: And then I start getting hit up with a lot of different emails about asking how they
6387.04s: should manage a position that they know that I put on.
6389.68s: And it's like, I want to stay away from that with a not even a 10 foot pole, a fucking
6394.08s: 60 foot pole.
6395.68s: So what I do now as a bit of a middle ground is for the, for the Patreon folks, what I tend
6402.68s: to do is like I all post in the discord slightly delayed purposefully when I put on different
6410.60s: trades, not all of them.
6412.92s: And the other thing I'll do is I'll walk through my actual trades, how I'm managing
6418.96s: them, how I'm finding them.
6421.20s: When I do the outlier pro live streams, like that's exactly what I do in those.
6425.76s: When I do the YouTube live streams, it's more meta talking about the markets trades,
6429.64s: answering questions, stuff like that.
6431.28s: And then the pro live streams are just way more like getting into the exact weeds of
6436.20s: what I'm doing, but it's not live and it won't be live.
6440.28s: It's slightly to, yeah.
6445.88s: So that last one, roaring city for on demand, absolutely.
6450.32s: Yeah.
6451.32s: And we've done that before, even in this.
6453.68s: So yeah, on demand is cool too, because we can do like a previous point in time, right?
6458.88s: So we can pick a random point in time that none of us know what happens and we can play
6462.28s: the game from there.
6463.28s: Absolutely.
6464.28s: That's no problem at all, because that also completely takes away anybody's, you know,
6469.40s: gumshen to copy what I'm doing if we know we're back in 2012, right?
6475.08s: There's literally no reason to copy anything I'm doing today based on that.
6479.32s: So yeah, absolutely.
6480.32s: Paper trading, entirely possible.
6482.08s: Happy to do that for sure.
6485.84s: And I've done that before because I think it's kind of fun.
6489.24s: So yeah, that's a absolutely chill recommendation.
6498.20s: Follows says, how many active trades do you have at a time?
6500.68s: I would say on average somewhere between five and 20 on average, like the overall bulk
6511.04s: of my trading career, I think it's very common for me to land between like 20 and 100.
6518.96s: And I would say like the majority, yeah, the majority is probably like 25 to 50.
6529.44s: I say average because when the market is just kind of right, if I look across my trading
6534.36s: career, there's pro long periods of time, because I started trading in 2007.
6539.68s: There's pro long periods of time where the market was just upsloping to the right.
6543.40s: So it's about as easy as it gets leveraged long products.
6549.64s: You don't need that many of them.
6551.52s: So in those instances, like if I think about the average holding across a trading career,
6555.88s: it gets skewed by that.
6557.88s: If I look over from like 2020 to present, it's probably closer to like the like I said,
6564.36s: maybe 20, 20 to 50 trades at a time, something like that.
6568.92s: So I don't like over diluting what I do.
6572.84s: And if I'm putting on more trades, the vast majority of those are actually going to be
6578.04s: variance risk premiums, volatility risk premiums plays, like just kind of turning things
6582.68s: out.
6584.28s: Most of my like capital is committed to a much smaller set of trades, less than 10 for
6589.48s: sure, absolutely less than 10.
6591.84s: There will be periods where it's two, there will be periods where it may be five or six,
6596.40s: but most of the capital is typically tried up in just a handful of core positions.
6600.72s: And then all the speculative stuff is kind of done in the background as it fits.
6607.92s: Roaring Titi says you have that many zero DTs simultaneously.
6610.36s: No, not zero DTs.
6612.48s: Those are just all different kinds of trades, definitely not limited to zero DTs.
6617.60s: Zero DTs, I like them.
6621.32s: I like them for a few things, but they're actually a pretty small part of the total portfolio
6629.72s: for me.
6631.24s: So yeah, I definitely run zero DTs like every day, but it's a high frequency trade, but
6637.24s: it's a low risk allocation trade for me.
6640.92s: Vladimir Alpun says Eric, I built a spreadsheet using TQs to start pricing.
6650.16s: I have to beat the returns even letting it ride through 2002.
6654.48s: Yeah, I mean, whenever we do something in hindsight, it always looks so beautiful,
6659.56s: doesn't it?
6660.56s: But the problem is, again, if we take a look at the actual performance of it, it has a
6666.76s: lot of problems.
6670.72s: So if we do something like clear this, we go TQs, we just go 100%.
6680.12s: And we want to go back, I'll go back as far as this lets me to 2015.
6685.92s: So anything you're doing, oh, you mean through 22?
6691.44s: Yeah, so if you look at the performance of this from inception and you can go back further,
6698.52s: but to go back further, you just have to create a surrogate, which is completely fine.
6705.48s: That's what a lot of people do to try to test this over a longer term timeframe.
6709.76s: But yeah, like it's completely doable, but the problem is, is you're going to go through
6715.96s: periods that are like horrifically ugly, like terribly ugly.
6721.56s: Right?
6722.56s: So the worst drawdown here, 79%, and this isn't even like an OA-09 drawdown.
6729.84s: There's some variations of this that you'll look at in an OA-09 drawdown that go a liquid,
6738.28s: literally blow up.
6740.04s: So the question then you have to ask yourself is, if you have $10,000 and you watch that
6745.08s: decline by 80%, like who cares, right?
6748.48s: It's 10 grand.
6749.88s: But if you have your life wealth, let's say it's $5 million and you watch that contract
6755.92s: by 80%, I don't think you're sitting in it.
6759.08s: I don't think anybody's fucking sitting in that.
6760.76s: I'm not sitting in that.
6761.76s: There's no way.
6763.28s: And it's because you are faced with now an uncertainty going forward, right?
6769.64s: When we back test, it's so easy to find things that perform.
6773.76s: I can show you back test that perform even better than this.
6776.40s: That look great.
6777.64s: But the problem is, is that when we're looking forward into the future, is AI going to become
6783.92s: regulated?
6784.92s: Is technology actually not going to be the bell of the ball like it was for the last
6788.72s: 15 years, which has been really the last 25 years almost now?
6792.60s: It's been tech has been everything, but does that continue into forever?
6796.72s: I imagine tech would be highly productive, but I'm just talking about in this scenario,
6802.00s: tech might not be.
6803.24s: And especially again, if you have your $5 million that's now down 80% or as it's down 40%
6809.20s: you're like, shit, I know this went down 80 before.
6811.92s: And again, if I actually hold this through like an 0809 equivalent when it's not even
6815.76s: specific to tech, but a broad market meltdown, then am I okay watching my $5 million
6821.88s: decline by 98% and then my only hope at that point is to just sit and wait for it to
6828.64s: recover.
6829.64s: I don't know man.
6831.64s: And a lot of that's also going to depend on your time frame.
6834.40s: I like leverage ETFs.
6835.72s: I trade T triple cues, not seeing anything bad about it.
6839.72s: But I think people, I think what you're doing in that context is called again, let's go
6846.64s: to the old handy dandy website.
6848.80s: I'll show you exactly what it's called.
6850.96s: This one I made up by the way, I don't think this one is actually from anywhere, but this
6855.52s: one, goalie locks analysis.
6859.00s: It's easy to look back and be like, yeah man, 70% draw down that kind of sucks, but a 34%
6865.16s: compound annual growth rate, like that's pretty sick.
6868.68s: So yeah, sure, I'll take a 70% draw down and 80% draw down for a 35% compound annual
6873.88s: growth rate.
6875.00s: But this is looking back in time.
6877.16s: So like for example, if I could make the decision today to go back to 2015 and put all of the
6884.32s: money I had in time into T triple cues and just let it go, sure, why not?
6888.08s: No problem.
6889.08s: Because I know the outcome.
6890.08s: I know it's still pretty solid.
6892.08s: But it's not quite as clear as that because if we take a look at something like T triple
6897.68s: cues, once you get into three times leverage, you're outside of the goalie lock zone.
6902.68s: And I don't mean it in terms of goalie locks analysis.
6904.64s: I mean, in terms of performance.
6906.16s: It still has not gotten back to all time highs.
6909.60s: It still has not.
6911.20s: If I look at something like spy, it has and it's posting new highs.
6917.92s: If I look at a two times leveraged ETF, which is a better long term buy and hold leveraged
6922.20s: ETF, it did hit new highs fell down, but it absolutely beat these previous highs.
6928.60s: If I look at something like T triple cues, that is not what happened.
6933.64s: The closest it got was within six points or so, but not quite.
6938.16s: It still hasn't got back to break even from its all time high.
6943.20s: So volatility, volatility drag is a thing.
6947.44s: And this spreadsheet you have is totally cool.
6949.60s: Again, I'm not trouncing on leverage ETFs.
6952.40s: I use them.
6953.72s: I use them in my retirement accounts for things that I trade less frequently.
6959.12s: I don't use three times leveraged because I know I can look at historic market data.
6965.60s: And I can find that the optimal leverage is typically around like 2.3.
6969.56s: Now you can create a surrogate 2.3 leverage with something like T triple cues by offsetting
6974.96s: it with another product and just scaling the positions, but it doesn't change the behavior
6979.32s: of the product itself, which is a daily leveraged product.
6983.08s: So yeah, I don't hate them at all, but I just think it's so important to understand
6987.00s: what they are, how they behave, how they fit into things, and how we think we might
6992.76s: actually behave.
6993.76s: Again, as you watch, prospectively, if you put a bunch of money into it, like the bulk
7001.00s: of your wealth climbing down, but even 30% is not super great.
7007.56s: Then you start getting into like 50%.
7009.88s: If that takes you from again, you're $5 million, that takes you down to two and a half,
7015.88s: clearly, right?
7016.88s: That's just the math.
7017.88s: But if you think of that from like a functional standpoint, a livelihood standpoint, that is
7023.56s: a massive material change in your resources.
7029.08s: The difference between a $2.5 million net worth and a $5 million net worth is significant,
7034.72s: absolutely significant.
7036.84s: So if you're planning on retiring, you have your $5 million, you have a conservative lifestyle
7041.28s: so you don't need a bunch of money, you can live off of it, you can stand inflation,
7045.24s: you can stand when costs pop up once in a while, you can do all that with your $5 million
7050.28s: account if you choose to retire early.
7052.28s: At a $2.5 million account?
7054.08s: Probably not.
7056.08s: Probably not.
7057.08s: You're going to run out of money more likely than not.
7058.88s: Unless you're super conservative and stuff like that, it doesn't give you the same playing
7064.08s: field.
7065.08s: So again, nothing wrong with leveraged funds, but I think it's so dangerous to look at
7069.56s: their historic performance and then to over like look at them with rosy colored glasses,
7077.36s: rose colored glasses.
7078.36s: What where is that saying from?
7080.04s: What does that even mean?
7081.84s: Hold on one second, I have to look that up.
7085.32s: I like to look up things like that.
7087.44s: What is the origin of rose colored glasses?
7094.04s: Let's see.
7097.48s: Rose colored glasses or rose tinted glasses refers to the tendency and overly optimistic early
7103.84s: literary use.
7105.56s: The phrase appeared in literary works during the 19th century.
7110.28s: One of the earliest uses of the phrase is attributed to Thomas Carlisle, a Scottish
7115.20s: philosopher and essayist who referred to people seeing the word through rose colored spectacles
7122.16s: in his work.
7123.16s: Love that.
7125.40s: What's the metaphor was used in like the 30s and 40s.
7129.52s: I got to be honest, that's actually like super super cool.
7132.76s: Did not know that.
7134.00s: Vladimir says I'm not suggesting go all in, but so many are skeptical about T-Triple
7139.96s: Q.
7140.96s: Well, I think people are skeptical about leveraged funds because they misunderstand
7143.36s: what leverage is and what things like volatility to K are.
7147.20s: Like a lot of people believe when you're holding something like a volatility or a leveraged
7151.60s: asset that is just like falling apart in your hands on a daily basis.
7155.68s: And that's not the case at all.
7157.24s: There's cost.
7158.68s: And again, like one of the frictions in something like T-Triple Q's is not small.
7162.88s: It's like a 4% year penalty on your return.
7166.08s: And that's just like general cost from the rebalancing.
7168.92s: So that's not like an insignificant hurdle to get over, but that's not the end of the
7172.72s: world.
7173.72s: If you're trading something, that's going up massively.
7177.28s: This doesn't include volatility to K, which will chew you up to the downside.
7182.08s: That's why when you're trading something like leveraged ETFs, it's so important to use
7185.52s: some sort of system.
7187.92s: Because again, like if you go through a bad path, you can get absolutely mangled.
7193.56s: If you look at this move here, this is no joke.
7195.80s: This went from 85 down to 48.
7200.68s: And it did that in like a month.
7204.00s: That's a really nasty move.
7207.28s: So if you think about leveraged ETFs, again, like they look really good because as of lately,
7214.80s: they've performed really well.
7216.76s: But they don't always do that.
7219.84s: US equity leveraged ETFs, I like them a lot.
7222.60s: I use things like SSO and QLD all the time myself.
7225.60s: Like I said, those are my other accounts.
7227.72s: And it's because I like two times leveraged for longer term holdings because the drag
7233.80s: is less, the reward is less, but the standard deviation is different.
7238.24s: So when I look at the performance of something like Teachable Q's, it's fantastic.
7244.24s: But if I look at my compound annual growth rate, which right now is 26%.
7250.84s: If we look at the compound annual growth rate for Teachable Q's over its lifespan, which
7255.60s: is a shorter duration than mine to be clear, but let's take a quick look.
7260.48s: Because I think it's what like low 30s.
7264.32s: But then if you look at its standard deviation, it's like over 50%, which is essentially like
7271.04s: the inverse of what mine is.
7275.68s: Let me see clear these at Teachable Q's back 100%.
7281.88s: Take a look.
7286.36s: 34% compound annual growth rate.
7290.24s: So it absolutely beats me.
7292.68s: It beats me by 8%.
7294.68s: Ish, a little under 8%.
7297.16s: But this is nuts.
7300.92s: A 58% and a half standard deviation of those returns is fucking crazy.
7307.32s: So you have to be ready to hold through some really nasty periods if this is the thing
7312.04s: that you want to roll with.
7314.20s: So yeah, I mean, the overall risk in that is there.
7317.64s: It's there for a reason.
7319.16s: But yeah, I like leverage ETFs, but traders have to figure out what's right for them.
7325.00s: Right?
7326.00s: That's what it's come that is literally what it comes down to.
7328.80s: You got to figure out what's right for you.
7330.48s: Because this beat my best year, my best year trading was last year.
7333.84s: And I returned just over 100%.
7335.08s: It was like 118%.
7336.84s: That was my best year.
7338.44s: This is almost double that.
7341.00s: My worst year was down 4%.
7344.36s: So I absolutely smash this one.
7348.84s: So yeah, up to the trader to figure out what's right for them.
7356.68s: Polic says, what do you use for scanning markets?
7360.24s: A bunch of stuff.
7361.64s: I have a video actually that's coming out soon that will go into exactly that for you.
7366.96s: It's one is it come out.
7368.32s: It's well right now it's either going to come out tomorrow or it's going to come out
7373.16s: next week.
7375.72s: It really depends on if my editor finishes the paper trading video for tomorrow.
7380.04s: If he does, paper trading will come out tomorrow.
7382.60s: And then how I analyze the stock market will be the following week.
7386.24s: But yeah, I use a ton of stuff.
7387.96s: I use spread indicators.
7389.68s: I use indices or relationships between the indices volume relative strength.
7396.16s: I'll use economic cycles.
7397.92s: I kind of take like a very top down approach.
7400.44s: It helps me contextualize things pretty well.
7405.00s: That's a good question though.
7410.40s: All right gang, that about wraps me up.
7413.40s: Super fun.
7414.40s: Love hanging out with you guys tomorrow is the GME live stream.
7417.16s: We're going to go through the rest of roaring kiddie's trades and then talk about the new
7421.92s: offerings and hopefully dive further and further into things.
7426.08s: But as always, if there's anything you want me to take a look at, let me know.
7430.04s: Be an outlier.
7431.04s: I'll see you guys around.
7432.64s: Take care.
