0.20s: why am I so obsessed with the outlier
2.72s: concept and why you should be too the
5.84s: goal of this video is to walk you
7.20s: through exactly that I want to level set
9.40s: with some basics of the outlier concept
13.64s: some statistics to help elucidate the
15.40s: point and then at the end of the video
17.00s: I'm going to walk you through two things
18.88s: some of the exact steps I took to become
21.04s: one and then literally quite literally a
24.12s: near bulletproof plan to become one if
27.44s: you're able to follow it which spoiler
29.56s: alert most people aren't but that's the
31.68s: goal of this video is to change the way
34.44s: you look at your financial well-being
37.20s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
39.08s: back to all the outliers let's start
42.16s: with why I'm even talking about this
44.20s: well for those that don't know I grew up
46.52s: poor had a single mom she worked two
48.32s: jobs I grew up in a shitty area the same
50.32s: old story that's not really important
52.44s: because that's just a starting point
54.60s: however by my late 20s I was already a
57.64s: first generation self-made millionaire
60.28s: now in my early 30s I'm 32 now I'm a
62.44s: multi-millionaire not some big Flex it's
64.84s: to walk you through how changing your
67.88s: perspective can change your outcomes so
71.40s: let's get into that what's the
72.92s: probability of becoming a millionaire in
74.68s: the US it's
75.96s: 88.8% you might look at that and say wow
78.20s: that's pretty low not high so it's
80.20s: clearly not granted however if you look
82.40s: at that compared to something like
84.04s: becoming an NBA player 48 out of
87.60s: 155,156 high school players make it to
90.32s: the NBA for those that are not math
91.92s: inclined that is
93.72s: 0.03% that's your probability of
95.64s: becoming an NBA player not that great so
98.12s: when we think about this that's actually
100.52s: pretty achievable and we're going to
102.00s: talk about exactly how to land there so
104.96s: first let's level set on what an outlier
107.80s: is this is just a standard definition
110.16s: it's a person or thing differing from
112.68s: all other members of a particular group
115.40s: or set and in a graphical way this is
117.64s: kind of how you can visualize it we have
119.24s: the average data sample over here and
122.52s: then we have a positive skew outlier all
125.12s: the way out here to the right you can
126.60s: also have negative skew outliers all the
129.52s: way over here to the left but guess what
131.24s: none of our concerned we are focused on
133.24s: this Benchmark when I was going through
135.24s: school undergrad grad my time in the
137.80s: Marine Corps I never cared at all about
141.44s: what the minimum was that is not how my
143.92s: mind works I wanted to know what the
146.32s: maximum was for everything this one
149.16s: small change in the way that you view
151.48s: things can have a massive impact on how
155.12s: your life unfolds if you chase the
157.52s: minimum or if you chase the average you
160.28s: might get there that's not the goal so
162.88s: now let's talk about some other
165.56s: statistical phenomena what do you think
167.64s: the probability is of you starting a
169.48s: successful business you nailed it 17%
172.76s: now obviously this is a range this is
174.52s: just a specific example from LinkedIn
176.56s: but the point being it's not a slam dunk
179.84s: either and fun fact the probability of
182.60s: starting a successful business that then
184.44s: goes on to make you a millionaire is
186.12s: smaller than this so how do we do this
190.20s: let's talk about it the first thing is
193.48s: by understanding the landscape so what's
196.40s: the median earnings by age well for my
199.12s: reference period 32 years old it's
202.00s: $53,000 per year yeah not much to write
204.60s: home about what is the average in median
207.12s: household wealth by age for those that
209.80s: don't know they have to use median
212.52s: because the outliers skew the average so
217.04s: much so you have to pick the midpoint so
219.28s: in this case if you look at the average
222.00s: and median household wealth by age I'm
224.40s: 32 the average is
226.76s: $95,000 the median is
229.20s: $229,000 this is the reality for most
232.32s: people we can continue the example the
235.28s: average retirement age is 64 years old
237.80s: the average life expectancy is 7 7 years
240.24s: old looks like 13 years to me now to be
243.52s: clear the goal of retirement in my
245.88s: opinion is not to just stop working and
248.44s: become a succubus in the world around
250.36s: you it's to be able to Pivot your time
252.68s: and effort your resources onto the
255.28s: things that you really are passionate
257.24s: about because for those that don't know
259.28s: at least as far as we know you get one
261.36s: shot at this thing called life so doing
264.24s: things like this sharing this kind of
266.56s: information with people gives me purpose
268.96s: so my hope is that you'll follow along
271.88s: with me so now I want to talk to you
274.56s: about this idea on how to become an
277.36s: outlier the very first thing as I
279.88s: already mentioned is you have to
281.04s: completely change your standards the way
283.08s: that you think about things matters
285.60s: tremendously so so if you right now
288.76s: focus on things as what can I do to get
291.28s: by what is the minimum I can do in order
294.32s: to get the best possible outcome there's
297.00s: a little bit of optimization there and I
299.16s: don't hate that however if you do not
302.00s: have high standards you're going to land
304.32s: where average people land that's just
306.36s: how it works so next we need to think
308.84s: about our reference benchmarks I don't
311.44s: know if I said that right reference
313.40s: benchmarks and what I mean by this is
316.20s: this right here why do I use outlier as
318.68s: part of my brand why do I call us the
321.08s: outlier Community it's for this it's to
324.12s: start ingraining these concepts with you
327.56s: immediately because we are a product of
331.04s: who we surround ourselves by so if
333.16s: you're hanging out with people that are
334.56s: just balling out going to the club
336.72s: spending all their money that's probably
338.56s: what you're going to do too so by
340.40s: getting around the right people is
342.96s: absolutely essential now the kind of
346.20s: people you need to find yourself around
348.48s: and one of the key habits you must learn
351.68s: to embrace is delayed gratification this
354.16s: is where you willingly forgo near-term
358.12s: gratification by that thing you want and
361.76s: embracing delayed gratification instead
365.16s: saving that money for the future
367.64s: investing that money because in a little
370.64s: bit I'm going to show you how just this
373.16s: right here can make you a millionaire
375.52s: again essentially without fail as long
378.60s: as you can adhere to the plan so next up
381.28s: we have favoring the process over the
383.88s: outcome if you are overly outcome driven
387.00s: when that outcome doesn't happen quickly
389.00s: enough we tend to get disenfranchised so
391.48s: learning early on to favor the process
395.12s: is absolutely pivotal in our capacity to
398.76s: remain loyal to the process long term we
401.52s: need to take a proactive approach to our
403.80s: life if you do not accept ownership for
407.52s: everything around you as much as humanly
410.56s: possible this won't work for you if you
412.48s: are the kind of person that blames other
414.68s: things for things this isn't for you if
417.52s: you're late to work and you're excuses
420.08s: oh there was traffic that is I'm telling
422.68s: you the wrong mindset so the problem
425.08s: here is that a lot of people apply a
427.64s: reactive approach to life and you get a
430.48s: reactive outcome got two more for you
432.72s: here the next one is habits and
434.60s: discipline this is really what feeds
437.48s: this process and the way to think about
440.04s: discipline is pretty simple the way you
443.12s: do one thing is the way you're going to
445.52s: do most things and in order to pull all
448.68s: of this together together we have to
450.56s: plan you have to plan effectively so now
452.96s: let's do just a little bit of planning
454.96s: if we pop over to my website and we take
457.52s: a look at this resource section there's
459.48s: a section here that says do Traders make
461.24s: money and you'll see a few things the
463.48s: first one is 7% of Traders remain in the
466.48s: market after 5 years that's not super
469.20s: great here we are seeking to understand
471.80s: the landscape the average Trader
474.28s: underperforms the market by 6 and 1 12
477.12s: points on average so most TR Traders
479.76s: underperform the market 93% of Traders
482.96s: quit within 5 years just the inverse of
484.68s: that and then this one there are even
486.20s: traders that continue beyond the 5-year
488.04s: Mark that still are not profitable so
491.20s: how do we plan successfully simple you
493.96s: Embrace something like this so again if
496.44s: you go to my website and you go here to
498.12s: the compound interest calculator here is
500.00s: a scenario if you have $25,000 of
502.56s: principal and you save $500 per month
504.92s: for 27 years at a 10% return you are
507.80s: going to become a millionaire it is just
510.00s: math how do we accelerate this well we
513.40s: get better at trading and instead of 10%
515.84s: per year which is about the average for
518.16s: the S&P 500 depending on your reference
520.04s: period maybe we get this up to 15% per
522.32s: year then all of a sudden you're now
523.88s: almost 2.8 millionaire in that time
526.60s: frame so then maybe instead of 20 years
528.96s: you or 27 you could take it down to 20
531.00s: years and notice you're a millionaire in
532.64s: that time frame maybe you get better at
534.64s: saving and instead of $500 you're able
536.88s: to save $11,000 maybe we could take take
539.36s: this down now even further to 17 years
542.72s: still a millionaire so there are
545.00s: different levers you can pull on to
547.64s: accelerate this time frame for you the
550.00s: concept of becoming an outlier is well
552.92s: within your reach it comes down purely
556.24s: to your mindset we all have different
558.44s: starting points some people start more
560.28s: disadvantaged or advantaged that you
562.56s: cannot control but you can fully control
565.28s: how you react to your current scenario
567.48s: and change your outcome
569.68s: like subscribe share be an outlier see
572.32s: you guys later
