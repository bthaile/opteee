 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you parents actually came in heavier month of a month that came in light. So there's a bit of a mix in terms of expectations against what we actually ended up seeing. So if we take a look now, I want to specifically look at the Empire State Manufacturing Index. So New York Empire State Manufacturing. Let's grab this bad boy right there. And let's take a look together, shall we? Looks like we got unburdened croissants. It's great to get rid of the burden. So I love that. We have Tommy Josh Lauren. Why not? Tommy says it's a bug. It's in the software toss. Well, it's actually from Benzinga, but close enough. I want to say Joey and Paulo, great to see you guys. Joey, you and I were talking about your covered stranglestuff, which I still think the ball is in your court for the next response. Just saying, let's take a look at, what do I want to see? First, I want this to actually move. Here we go. Okay. So I'm going to zoom this in. And you can see that it really came in declining pretty heavily actually, which is kind of interesting. So general business conditions index fell 26 points to negative 20. New orders and shipments decline delivery times and supply availability held steady. So this is good. We're not seeing. Sometimes this can be inflationary in nature, depending on the way that this metric behaves, but this looks fine. The new orders and shipments, that actually surprises me a little bit because my expectation with the broader Trump tariffs and all that stuff is that we would see a surge in orders and shipments so that people can get as much as they possibly can get done before we see the tariffs come into place. And inventories continue to grow. Inventories growing is absolutely part of that. No no shock there. Employment levels hours continue to move slightly lower. We obviously expect that. And then input prices increase the fastest pace in more than two years. So we obviously also know a lot of what's going on there. And selling price increases also continue to pick up again, reflective of input prices. So optimism about the outlook waned considerably for a second consecutive month. So here again is a pretty significant impact from the overall tone and tenor of what the market is doing. So nothing in here I'd look at it and it's not like, yeah, that you know, it's like shocking that that would be the case. This all seems about par for the the course unfortunately to a degree. But this is very likely going to be much of what we're going to expect to see, especially as the the tariff situation continues to work its way through the through the broader system. So yeah, no real big shock here, I think. I think. Scott says, what's up with GME low volume? I think it's coming in on an earnings week during a pretty quiet period in general for the broader market. I think all eyes right now from a broader market lens are on tech for sure. Because if we take a look at aggregate volumes of today in terms of like what was trading the most, it's pretty much all tech. And tech is kind of like in a make or break make or break level, I think. So let's take a look really quick. I want to look at price and volume. Here we go. Price and volume leaders. Here. So you can see if we look across the board, this is bringing in price and volume, not just volume, right? So we can get like a weighted based on the total values exchanging. And you can see that this just lands super heavy tech. So tech right now is still a make or break segment of the broader market. And this is also really common, by the way, specifically for companies like GameStop, I've actually talked about this recently, but for companies in general, that as you come into earnings, typically the few days before, unless there's crazy stuff going on, they generally will mill out a little bit. Now one really important note that I don't know if you can tell by this really busy chart, but it's one of my favorites is if you take a look at comm services relative to technology, fascinating relationship here, because you can see that the lead in up here, right? Even if you just take a look at the moving averages, and if you take a look at the levels, like for the last three months, like the first portion of the last three months, leading into midfib. This is kind of tech was trailing sideways. And you can see comm services were actually gaining pretty heavily. And then around the same time frame, they both correlated, and in the snap of a finger simultaneously both dropped at a very similar rate, which is also super interesting for two things that were in a high level of correlation and then fell out of that high level of correlation. I thought that that was really, really interesting. So let's I'm going to just adjust these two really quick to show you the last six months instead of the three. Right, like take a look at the difference in performance over the last slightly longer term time frame of six months versus three months. And you can see like a very stark contrast between comm services and tech. So even though in the near term, it looks like comm services and tech have reengaged and are now generally moving correlated to one another. It's not in the same broader context. Com services is still way stronger on a comparative basis relative to broader tech, which again, I do think is generally worth your consideration. And if we take a look at the indices in the same context, I'll change these as well to six. And I want you to take a look at the lead in to where we sit today compared to the last essentially from midfab. That's one of the big turn started happening across the board. So as I flip these, you'll notice a big change in two things, but the correlation between them interestingly moves quite a lot. And this highlights how near term in short term correlations can change and how fickle they can be. Because if you take a look at spy and cues, spy had actually held on longer than cues did, meaning in terms of this move in here and the recapturing of near term highs, whereas the Russell, if we look back over the last six months, has effectively been in decline. The Russell has been out of the conversation for some time now. And it's because all of these broader market conditions that we're looking at, at least today, really do not favor the Russell in any significant fashion. It's just kind of how it is. Bitcoin is rolled over pretty massively as well. I think that's kind of worth general attention. But yeah, when I look at the general market as it sits now, I think the same thing that I've reiterated for a little while. But I do think we're in a really dangerous point. The reason why I think it's so dangerous is because you're looking at a market where just about everybody thinks they're wrong. And that leads to increase in total volatility. What I mean by that is this. If we take a look at spy, what's happening right now is as the market first starts rolling down, most people are like, this is all good, not worried about it. Everything's okay. Market pulls back. Then it starts taking out term lows like this stuff here. And by this point, the market has already moved a bit. If we measure from here to kind of where it first started taking out term lows, that represents a 5% decline. So halfway to a correction at this point. During this halfway to a correction, then you get people starting to say, eh, maybe I should start grabbing some puts here. Maybe I need to start grabbing some puts and hedging this downside risk. And you can see that represented in a bunch of different tools. The skew index is fantastic for this, which helps us understand the different pricing for things like out of the money puts versus calls. And you can see that they started getting the skew just started getting parabolic and has slowly been trailing down. You can see that there is these optics like here, really interesting points on like the 10th, right, going down, down, down, boom, jumps up and then jumps down. So what's happening there? Those are people that are like, they feel they've been caught off guard. And they're saying, oh shit, I need to actually hedge here. And I need to go find some puts, which at this point, the puts are wildly expensive. So then you get people scaling into puts as the market is continuing down, right? Everybody's kind of settling in for the potential that this market rolls over heavy. And then we finally get to the termination point of at least near term move in the correction down to here. And the termination point of the near term correction is literally just over 10%. Just nicked over the range that it needs to hit a defined correction. And with that, we start seeing a little bit of a rally. Now I've already told you all a bunch of times. It is very common even during bear markets. They're literally called bear market rallies where you will see the market rally anywhere from 8 to 10%. It can be a pretty strong rally. So the rally so far represents 3.4%. If we take this up to what 8% would take us to, it's about here. So it would almost start to look like recapturing. Tommy says dead cat bounce. It's similar to a dead cat bounce. The slight difference in my mind, this is a stylistic view. Is a dead cat bounce typically occurs when something has just been punished into oblivion. And then you see a really small relief rally. Slightly different scenario for something that's literally just taking a 10% correction. But yeah, similar context, slightly different times in the chart, at least as far as I'm concerned. So this rally right now is still really, really early stages. And the key areas to be here in my mind are here. If we can start taking out prior swing lows, then the market absolutely starts to look like it's starting to consolidate, establish a new trading range, that sort of thing. But this still is embryonic in nature in my opinion. I think that this is still so, so early. And the reason why I think that this is super dangerous is because there's lots of people that bought protection super late on the way down. And then they get concerned that they grab the protection to expensive. And then they start trying to figure out different things that they can do with their position to try and minimize some of that cost. And then you have the consequent difference of the people here that started scaling in as it's going down. And there's people that are like, shit, I wish I grabbed more because there's an idea that it might start rallying up and out hard from here. So the way that the market breaks from here, I think is still heavily TBD. I think that there will be some signs, right? Here's the nearest term low at this point that the market needs to firmly recapture. And what I mean by that, that's not like price crossing above and falling back below. It's like a closer to above, decisively above. And that starts to show a slight change in the overall tone and movement of the market. But if we zoom out, one of the things I've already drawn your attention to previously is how different the current market is. And that is the truth. The current market is so unique in that as we look at near term price movements, volatility has gone up on a comparative basis. And this is an artifact of a lot of leverage being produced into the system of high frequency trading, trading really short term time frames and extending price massively one way or the other before other systems step in to move price back down into levels. So the spike in volatility actually is quite welcomed, especially during the broader market declines here. I've been talking a little bit about, and I shared this some during my end of February performance summary. But a lot of the return sources that are available right now are not typically available during an extended duration bull market. And I actually much prefer trading markets like this than extended bull markets. And it's because when you're trading an extended bull market, you're just constantly sitting there waiting for the shoot to drop. You're just waiting for the period where it's no longer good and everything starts to crater and you're just kind of waiting for that. So that's kind of annoying. Whereas when you're trading markets like this, you get a look at trading a bunch of different things. I'm dusting off strategies that I haven't had the opportunity to use much in the last year plus we did see a bear market in 22, which offered a similar opportunity. But the other thing to keep in mind is that for selling strategies, you really are getting compensated more for the risk you're taking, especially if you use vertical spreads. The problem with vertical spreads, as you know, is that you're buying wings that are also overpriced, which again, costs to do in business if you need them. But then more importantly on top of that is the impact that you see to the movement that you experience. So if you're trading some sort of short-term volatility style or short premium, you're absolutely going to see broader movements because volatility is higher. It's what we expect to see. And you can see that expressed in the ADR and the ATR that track both daily range and true range, which are expressions of volatility. So when I look across the broad market, those are the main things that are sticking out to me is the alignment of downside pressure across all the indices. They've become correlated, which is very common during down moves. They've been, especially the Russell, who's been less correlated for quite a while. The VIX is coming down harder than I expected. I actually didn't finish scaling into my short VIX trade. And it's simply because I really did think that the VIX would either spike up a little bit more before it comes back down. I just didn't expect this severity to the downside, which it's welcome to see because it's still a really easy trade to make, but interesting to me. Then if we take a look at the sectors, calm and tech, the realignment and correlation of those two is topical to me because that becomes a pairs trade opportunity. We're still seeing lingering strength primarily from health care and utilities. I still think health care, interestingly enough, is actually really well positioned here. And I think the health care sector has been so disgustingly underperforming for so long that it's actually starting to hit some of my lower bans for total percent return performance for really long-term timeframes, like 10 years, 15 years, 20 years. And there's a decent reversion normalization of those relationships. We'll review some of those on the pro stream tomorrow because there's some specific trade ideas that come out of the normalization of those movements, but more broadly, you should at least be aware that that's something that's happening without a doubt. So all that said, let's take a quick look at the overall market. We can see that there's been a really big change in the percentage of companies that are posting highs and lows, specifically as it relates to as a percentage. I care about the percentage is quite a lot. And you can track the change in these percentages just like I do with the change week over week of sector performance. The reason for that is because it gives us a preliminary look is to things as they're starting to rotate in a way that your eyes can't see just from looking at a chart, but you can see it happening under the internals. It's the same exact reason why you see me run net highs lows. It's also why you see on the primary charts things like Tick and Tren. Those kinds of metrics really help me a lot understand where we're at in a current market cycle. And again, you can take a specifically at the net highs lows down here. This combines both the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange. It's just because I like to see both of them and it's easier for me to combine them into a single view, although to the regular viewer. I'm sure this is way noisier. But the thing I want you to pay attention to on the day is if you take a look at the net highs lows, New York Stock Exchange showed positive 37 NASDAQ showed negative 21. So you're seeing a break in correlation between NYC and NASDAQ. If you take a look at gross highs in NYC, you see 58 and then in NASDAQ, you see 90. So we're still seeing gross highs across the board grow, but they're growing faster in NYC. Versus NASDAQ. Now a couple other things that I want to show you really quick and then we can just open it up to whatever you guys want to take a look at. This down here, specifically the underperforming, the historically underperforming sectors, what I find interesting is I still believe that the fade opportunity and materials gets even more appealing now. And for those that can't see materials as kind of like the lighter purple, you can see they've really been declining heavily since mid-FAB and materials in the short term is on the receiving end a lot of a lot of the the tariff conversation and the expansion by the way of those tariffs soon enough. So I think using this bounce not just to play short term bullish ideas, but also reigniting short term fades is at least in my playbook. A couple other notes, defense contractors, not much movement. So I talked about this on the pro stream yesterday. I was highly interested to see how the defense contractors behave today. And the big reason why I'm so interested is because with the recognition of the US forces involvement in Yemen and the conduct of different kinds of strikes. And you can see there is a move today. It's not like there was no move, but I think a lot of the move that you see today is sympathetic with the broader market. I wouldn't really consider it to be idiosyncratic movement based on this news. All of the news that you see today and most of the stocks is up moderately, right? Lockheed Martin's up 0.3%. So I absolutely would not assign much of these movements. Now Raytheon is a slightly different story because Raytheon was up 1.6%, which is a little bit more aggressive compared to the others. And that did surprise me a little bit because you can see the spy was up 0.77% today. So about three quarters of a point. What I'm doing here is I'm saying, okay, so for the main defense contractors, how much of their move is likely due to the broader market move and how much is due to their own idiosyncratic. And for these, it mostly looks to be market related. But the exception to that is Raytheon because Raytheon is up 1.6%. So it's essentially two times what you saw in the S&P 500. So leads me to believe that there's a couple things going on here. Now this is not just related to the news that you're seeing related to Yemen and all that stuff. You can see that there is a new contract here. So the broader infrastructure is still continuing to be developed out. So this isn't anything. Again, that I would directly attribute to what we're seeing in Yemen. The last thing is I don't know if you guys saw, but I posted a link yesterday. But I thought that this was actually just super cool. I'm not talking about like the political landscape behind it. I don't care about all that. But I just thought watching the video is sweet because you can see you know, these people that literally flew from freaking earth into low orbit to connect to this tiny little station that flies around the earth that like 17,000 miles an hour. Is that correct? And let me fact check that. I don't know. I SS speed 4.76 miles a second. Yeah, the little fuck uses that. There you go. See, I was right. Wasn't confident, but 17,400. These are the random facts that my brain knows that is consuming important information space that should be used for actually important things. But instead, I can tell you what the speed of the International Space Station, also fun fact, the space station does need to use power to keep its distance away from earth. Otherwise, it kind of slowly drifts towards earth a little bit. So yeah, okay, another random. That's enough facts about ISS, I think, more than most people probably give a shit about. I think this stuff is so cool though. But yeah, if you haven't seen the docking itself, it's super cool. It's pretty fun. But yeah, that also went down. All right, so I'm going to pop the door open for Thor, and then we are going to turn the session open into whatever you guys want to take a look at. All right. What do we got? Lauren says it's going to go down again, I think. I mean, I think it's a fair, I do think it's a fair guess, like I genuinely do. And I think if I were playing this still from a general pod odds perspective, half to bet up or down, which again is a losing prospect, by the way. But if that had to happen, again, as always, we can use options to help us understand what the current probabilities are likely to be. So let's take a look. First thing that I always would look at for something like this is the volatility, surface and oil. There we go. So two things here. The first thing is you can see that in the near term, the 21 March, the put side is really high priced in terms of vol. The IV on the puts out of the money puts is really, really high. And then it flattens out when you get towards 17 April. The other thing is even the call side is still elevated. So this obviously still represents pretty high front implied volatility, which is not surprising. But we can also see that this indicates that the market is still actually planning a slightly higher probability of a smaller upside move and a lower probability of a significant downside move. So yeah, I think the the assumption that you have is probably, I mean, it's a reasonable starting point for sure. Lauren says, did you see the Mark Rober Tesla laser contribute controversy? I love market drama. No, literally no nothing about that. What is it? What happened? Mark Rober? Tesla? Tesla? Beaser? This former NASA engineer wanted to test how Tesla's camera camera only approached to self driving stacks up against LIDAR. What does the demonstrate differences between Tesla camera only? LIDAR equip vehicles break before crashing into the wall, Tesla powers right through it, okay? What's the what's the issue? So I'm claiming the video was the secret ploy by Tesla's enemies to honor mine Elon's must mission to advance self driving cars. Lauren says people are saying it was to drive Tesla down. What? This is exactly in line with the kind of shit that this dude does. He tests these ideas. If anything, I would consider this bullish or autonomous driving cars. Because it literally identifies a current gap in technology that if you rectify that gap in technology, then you have a safer system. That's such a fucking stupid opinion. It literally doesn't make sense. Because this is a common thing where people think way too short term and way too simplistic. Because if anything, this is a third party literally conducting research that Tesla is going to see and is going to use to make their shit better, right? So if Tesla is trying to go down the route of like fully autonomous self driving cars, they need this. And it's probably nothing new. My guess is they probably already know this. But yeah, I just I think that that's such a silly silly takeaway to think that this has been done to drive the price of Tesla down. That's nuts. I mean, let's also let's also keep it a G. Tesla doesn't need any fucking help going down right now. Tesla is doing that on its own just fine. No problem for Tesla to find its way lower. Tesla has literally been cut in half. This almost starts to look like I already have the coverage strangle on in T triple cues and in SSO. And I really don't need more exposure to Tesla. But it does start to look like such a disgusting potential value prop for a longer term idea that it's I've thought about it more than once at this point. Especially if you choose to get it via something like TSLL, which is a two times leverage ETF, the reason why I like a two times leveraged ETF for Tesla is not because of anything other than the fact that it's cheaper. I can buy more units per dollar. And if it goes bankrupt, it can't it doesn't have to go that far. It goes from eight to zero. So you can size a awesome trade in here. So this is actually something I was modeling today. I was going to talk about this tomorrow, but I'll talk about it now a little bit because it's really interesting. So if you take a look at TSLL, which I normally don't trade it, by the way, but if you take a look at it and from an equity perspective, let's say we use our standard account size. We use standard $100,000 account and we use our standard risk protocols for a $100,000 account, which is essentially us saying something like, we would like to keep things generally between like one and three percent max risk for something like this. Maybe we pick two percent max risk. So on a $100,000 account, it gives you two grand to play with. Well, if you buy 200 shares that immediately puts the total risk that you have sub-two grand, like you can even probably grab a little bit more if you're so inclined. But then if this starts to recapture anything even similar to what we've seen before, which I'll zoom this out, if this starts to capture, let's call it 3850. Let's add a thing here. Let's add 38.5. It's a $6,000 gain. I mean, in terms of a return on risk, I don't hate that play. Now, the reality is there's not an insignificant probability that TSL, it literally could go bankrupt. Now it would require a pretty significant sustained down move for Tesla, even with it trading as low as $8.34. But that's still not outside the entire realm of possibility. Like that could happen. But with respect to like a return on risk profile, I mean, you're taking a pretty low risk for a chance to double plus your money. Now, it becomes more dangerous, especially for small portfolios that see this kind of thing and then they just get jacked to the tits and try to run this all the way through. That's real dangerous, right? Like putting a massive percent of your portfolio in something like this. Because again, this can go bankrupt, to be clear, let's take a look at the TSL holdings. We're going to look at how it creates the leverage. Let's see. It's interesting that it combines them both. I would like to see what they're holding. I don't want to fucking PDF, bro. No, no, no. I mean, I know it's going to be through derivatives. I just don't know what specific derivatives and I would like to know. No, oh, here we go. Daily fund holdings. Yes, we. Here we go. Let's see. Grafist government cash. So they're actually massively in cash right now. More cash. So they have a ton of cash. And then see, look, this is the way that they're creating the leverage. Is they're using swaps. So I mean, they have a ton of cash. And absolute ton of cash. It's kind of the cool part, by the way, of trading leverage things is because you don't have to use as much money to trade them. I've already made that point a million times and I've showed you examples of this stuff like T-Triple Cues and SSO. This is the this is the reality behind like using leverage is you can use leverage logically, but this isn't like the fucking Michael sailor intelligent leverage Ponzi scheme shit. This is actually like legitimate use of leverage. Paul says the cash is collateral presumably. I don't know. It doesn't really matter what it is, but I don't know like what percentage of it would be collateral. Because the thing is is that well, let's see. So for T.S. I'm asking in Chattapetit. We'll see if it can do some analysis for us. I need to use my research guy. So for TSL, the fund holds large amounts of cash and creates the leverage via swaps. What kind of collateral is commonly used for leveraged ETFs that are using swaps for leverage? Good that says. Many many leverage ETFs hold large cash positions in T-bills or repo, provides stability and ensures meet daily margin requirements. So it looks like a little bit of everything. Money market repo collateralized. I don't know what the percentage is. Since the leverages synthetic via swaps, the fund doesn't need to fully invest in Tesla, which we know. The cash and T-bills serve as collateral. So let's see what the what the percentage typically is. What is the percentage of cash held typically as collateral? Yeah, so it looks like less than half would be for collateral. The funds often hold way more like 50 to 80%, but not really for a collateral perspective, which is because they don't need as much. Roderick says, could a leap on Tesla make sense instead of TSL when DTE is greater than one year for taxes? They're just very different traits. So you would have to figure out what the ideas and what the consideration is. The reason being is because if you take a look, it's something like Tesla, which is just wildly, wildly volatile. Even if you go super far out in time, let's say that you pick something that's 368 days. And let's say you get something that's like a synthetic stock equivalent. So let's go to like 85 delta's or something like that. The problem is is that like you're you're going to put up, call it 10,000, 10,700. And you're going to be chewing away $7 a day per contract in data decay. Even for an option that's as far out in time as this, and as deep in the money as this, there's nothing wrong with it. But you're paying a pretty penny for the leverage in something like this because of how volatile it is. So definitely could be done. There's nothing wrong with it. It's just a very different trade than something like TSL, at least in the way that I would run it. So yeah, definitely could do that though if you wanted. Scott says Tesla's a company is like that dude named Brock from high school. That's a complete tool and peaked at 17. I couldn't really disagree more. I think Tesla is at the cutting edge in terms of electric vehicle. If you think about it, Tesla is what caused all of the other automotive manufacturers to start taking this seriously, the electronic vehicle space. So I actually give Tesla a lot more respect than that personally. Roderick says 30% ETN to swap and balance safe typically. I think that's way too little, especially in something volatile like this. I would imagine the collateral that something like TSLL would possess right now would probably be north of 50%, probably 50 to 60% in terms of total collateralization of the cash. And I think in normal settings, based on what I read from GPT, which would align with my intuition would be something between like 40 and 50%. But the reality is, is most leveraged funds do hold tons of cash. And again, it's because they don't have to hold because they're using swaps. So if we take a look at T-Triple Q holding just for another example from another provider, right? So this is from ProShare's versus Direction. And let's take a look at what they have. Here. So we can see that it's primarily done via swaps and then they do hold the underlying. And then their cash position, right? So they're sitting on massive, massive, massive piles of cash. So yeah. So we'll see. But I do, I do like the TSLL idea. That would be like a massively highly speculative trade for me. That would be size very small. And it would be something that I would probably just trade the coverage triangle in because the volume here is just psychotic. Look at this. For something that's $7, you can collect 10% essentially to cash secure that. Like that's an insane return. So, but there is a absolute reality where TSLL could easily get cut in half. And lower probability, but TSLL could conceivably go and solve it. Like that is not outside the realm of possibility for something like this. And it's really important when you're trading things like this, even if it's something that's a lower probability, like we still have to acknowledge that this is something that can happen because it most certainly can happen like without a doubt. I wouldn't expect to see it personally because well, we could do the math. We can see like how many consecutive down days that we would need to have, but it would probably be enough that I would wager its fairly low probability, but not a zero probability, which is different. Cool. Anything else you guys want to hit? If not, I'm going to keep the stream on just because I'm going to look through the markets a little bit, but I'm not really going to be as talk to the camera necessarily, but you guys are free to hang out if you'd like. What I'm doing now is just poking through my portfolio really fast. I'm generally good with the exposure, but I need to check a couple things. So, what I'm looking at now is the ibit allocation, which might need to change. James says, do you have time to go over ive leading up to earnings? Yeah, definitely. Let's do that. That's way more fun. Wait, ive? Did I miss read that? ive? Ive? Oh, you mean like the broader effect? I see. So, did you watch the video? I have on trading earnings with options. This video? Because if you haven't, you should watch that first. If you haven't, you still have questions. I'm more than happy. And then Paul says, no, you don't have to watch it again. If you have specific questions on it, then 100% ask me. But if you watched it, then I imagine you know the basics of ive expansion leading into earnings. So it leads me to then assume that you have more specific questions than like the broad, than the broad effect. So I just want to answer the meaningful stuff for you. And then Paul says, how do you choose between various types of limit order? Does it matter much? It matters a ton. It matters a whole lot. I don't know if I still have that. Let me see, order type. Thought I had like a video that talked about order types. Yeah, it's probably because it's not that effective. Anyways, so for order types, the way to think about it, at least for me, is generally speaking on entry, I'm going to prefer some sort of limit order. So if I'm looking at TSLL. And let's say that I wanted to trade the options in here. So I would come into cell. And then I would, if I want to play the bid-ass spread, then I would run a limit order, right? Because I want to attempt to get filled at the price I'm denoting or better. And I can typically do this when I'm trying to enter trades because I have the luxury of time. It's not really a rush. When I'm looking to exit trades, I typically will try to use an exit order if I'm manually inputting them. Again, just to get a better, a better capture on the bid-ass spread. But if I'm setting things like stops, it's going to be a stop market, unless it's a profit. And then if it's a profit, it's typically an OCO, where I will have a stop limit, then a stop market. So it'll still include a stop market. And the reason is because specifically for stops, one of the big mistakes traders do is they try to get really cheap. They say like, oh, I want to get stopped out, but I want to get X number of dollars. And the problem with that is that you can then thus not get stopped out, which is straight trash. So I'll show you what that can look like. If we go into TSL, this is, let me find here, perfect example. Let's say here, you were like, I think it's going to go up from here. That's the trade idea. But I want to make sure that if I'm wrong, I'm not wrong a whole lot. I'm going to use the low of a day. And let's just, I can't really tell what it is. Let's call it like 2730. So 2730 was the low of the day. And I'm going to set a stop limit. At 2730. So normally, what would happen is you would set the stop, the trigger would be at like 27 35. So it means once price hits 2735, I want to try to route this order. And the order that would actually be routed would be buy to close, whatever it is at 2730. Well, here's the problem. If it opens down here at 25, this can't get filled. So the spot that you wanted to get out at because you were trying to be cheap, because you didn't want the scenario where, you know, you don't want to get a bad fill. Well, because you didn't want to get a bad fill, you're now going to get out at $2.30 cheaper. So you're not filled, but you're still in something you wanted to be out at a terrible price now. So that's the big thing that's like where it really does matter in my opinion is when it comes to stops because everybody will tell you that if you use like a stop market or just a market order in general, they kind of suck because you're going to get a bad fill. But again, it's always keeping first things first, right? Like what is the purpose of this stop? The purpose of the stop isn't necessarily to, you know, get the best possible price you humanly can. It's to get the fuck out of the trade when things are not going the way that they should be. So then if you reorder those and you say, well, I'm going to care more about getting a better fill than getting out of the trade, then you might not get out of the trade. So it's just getting confused and focusing on the wrong function. Alberto says, man, Eric does have a video for everything. I do have a video for a lot of stuff. And it's one of the reasons why the channel funny enough typically performs really poorly in terms of like when I launch a video and how many views that they'll get. And part of it is because I know the content that I cover. And I know that people will have questions about it. So I always title the videos, how I would think about the topic so that I could quickly search for them so that I could show them to people, which is absolutely hilarious. But I was thinking about it that actually goes back to the, you know, to the grassroots element of the channel and the original point of why I made this whole thing. But it's so funny because like, you're supposed to play a lot of games with titles, right? To like get people intrigued and you know, make them fearful and make them want to click something to help figure out the fear. And I'm literally just out here labeling shit something that I know I'll remember to, you know, type in the search bar so that I can find it for you guys is pretty comical. All right. That wraps me up. If you need anything, hit me up in the discord. You know, I'll see you later.
