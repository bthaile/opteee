330.00s: you
360.00s: you
390.00s: We're going to look at retail sales less autos, which we are also going to take a look at.
397.44s: If you take a look at the actual numbers versus consensus, it is actually really interesting.
404.84s: If we take a look at X autos, retail sales came in a little heavier than expected.
415.12s: And then if we take a look at year over year, they was expected to come in really light
419.84s: and it actually came in heavier month over month, it came in light.
423.28s: So there's a bit of a mix in terms of expectations against what we actually ended up seeing.
431.76s: So if we take a look now, I want to specifically look at the Empire State Manufacturing Index.
437.16s: So New York Empire State Manufacturing.
441.52s: Let's grab this bad boy right there.
447.36s: And let's take a look together, shall we?
450.20s: Looks like we got unburdened croissants.
453.00s: It's great to get rid of the burden.
454.56s: So I love that.
455.40s: We have Tommy Josh Lauren.
458.08s: Why not?
459.40s: Tommy says it's a bug.
460.84s: It's in the software toss.
463.36s: Well, it's actually from Benzinga, but close enough.
467.84s: I want to go to Joey and Paulo.
469.20s: Great to see you guys.
470.68s: Joey, you and I were talking about your coverage strangle stuff, which I still think the ball
474.80s: is in your court for the next response.
477.60s: Just saying, let's take a look at what do I want to see?
485.44s: First, I want this to actually move.
488.48s: Here we go.
490.24s: OK, so I'm going to zoom this in.
495.40s: And you can see that it really came in declining pretty heavily, actually, which is kind
502.92s: of interesting.
505.16s: So general business conditions index fell 26 points to negative 20 new orders and shipments
515.60s: decline delivery times and supply availability held steady.
519.20s: So this is good.
520.20s: We're not seeing sometimes this can be inflationary in nature, depending on the way that this metric
526.48s: behaves.
528.76s: But this looks fine.
530.44s: The new orders and shipments, that actually surprises me a little bit because my expectation
535.76s: with the broader Trump tariffs and all that stuff is that we would see a surge in orders
541.80s: and shipments so that people can get as much as they possibly can get done before we see
552.28s: the tariffs come into place.
554.56s: And inventories continue to grow.
557.08s: Inventories growing is absolutely part of that.
559.12s: No, no shock there.
561.68s: Employment levels hours continue to move slightly lower.
564.84s: We obviously expect that.
568.20s: And then input prices increase the fastest pace in more than two years.
573.28s: So we obviously also know a lot what's going on there.
576.60s: And selling price increases also continue to pick up again, reflective of input prices.
581.80s: So optimism about the outlook waned considerably for a second consecutive month.
588.56s: So here again is a pretty significant impact from the overall tone and tenor of what the
595.60s: market is doing.
596.60s: So nothing in here I'd look at it and it's not like, yeah, that's like shocking that
600.64s: that would be the case.
601.64s: This all seems about par for the course, unfortunately, to a degree.
606.56s: But this is very likely going to be much of what we're going to expect to see, especially
612.44s: as the the tariff situation continues to work its way through the through the broader
617.00s: system.
618.12s: So yeah, no real big shock here, I think.
625.36s: Scott says what's up with GME low volume?
627.28s: I think it's coming in on an earnings week during a pretty quiet period in general for
632.36s: the broader market.
633.36s: I think all eyes right now from a broader market lens are on tech for sure because if we
639.68s: take a look at aggregate volumes of today in terms of like what was trading the most,
646.12s: it's pretty much all tech.
648.68s: And tech is kind of like in a make or break make or break level, I think.
655.76s: So let's take a look really quick.
659.16s: I want to look at price and volume.
660.60s: Here we go.
661.60s: Price and volume leaders.
664.04s: Here.
666.04s: So you can see if we look across the board, this is bringing in price and volume, not just
671.84s: volume, right?
672.92s: So we can get like a weighted based on the total values exchanging.
676.72s: And you can see that this just laying super heavy tech.
679.28s: So tech right now is still a make or break segment of the broader market.
686.48s: And this is also really common, by the way, specifically for companies like GameStop, I've
690.60s: actually talked about this recently, but for companies in general that as you come into
694.68s: earnings, typically the few days before, unless there's crazy stuff going on, they generally
699.16s: will mill out a little bit.
701.40s: Now one really important note that I don't know if you can tell by this really busy chart,
706.92s: but it's one of my favorites is if you take a look at comm services relative to technology,
713.04s: fascinating relationship here, because you can see that the lead in up here, right, even
718.72s: if you just take a look at the moving averages, and if you take a look at the levels, like
722.76s: for the last three months, like the first portion of the last three months leading into mid
728.36s: Fed, this is kind of tech was trailing sideways.
732.80s: And you can see comm services were actually gaining pretty heavily.
737.48s: And then around the same time frame, they both correlated.
742.44s: And in the snap of a finger, simultaneously both dropped at a very similar rate, which
749.16s: is also super interesting for two things that were in a high level of correlation and then
755.64s: fell out of that high level of correlation.
759.16s: I thought that that was really, really interesting.
761.52s: So let's, I'm going to just adjust these two really quick to show you the last six months
765.60s: instead of the three.
767.28s: Right.
769.12s: Right.
770.12s: Like take a look at the difference in performance over the last slightly longer term timeframe
776.44s: of six months versus three months.
779.28s: And you can see like a very stark contrast between comm services and tech.
785.28s: So even though in the near term, it looks like comm services and tech have reengaged and
793.48s: are now generally moving correlated to one another, it's not in the same broader context.
800.40s: Com services is still way stronger on a comparative basis relative to broader tech, which again,
808.56s: I do think is generally worth your consideration.
812.96s: And if we take a look at the indices in the same context, I'll change these as well to
817.76s: six.
819.72s: And I want you to take a look at the lead in to where we sit today compared to the last
826.48s: essentially from midfib.
828.64s: That's when the big turn started happening across the board.
832.96s: So as I flip these, you'll notice a big change in two things, but the correlation between
842.52s: them interestingly moves quite a lot.
846.04s: And this highlights how near term and short term correlations can change and how fickle
855.08s: they can be.
856.92s: Because if you take a look at spy and cues, spy had actually held on longer than cues
865.28s: did, meaning in terms of this move in here and the recapturing of near term highs.
871.60s: There is the Russell, if we look back over the last six months, has effectively been
876.80s: in decline.
877.80s: The Russell has been out of the conversation for some time now.
881.64s: And it's because all of these broader market conditions that we're looking at at least
886.12s: today really do not favor the Russell in any significant fashion.
892.24s: It's just kind of how it is.
894.28s: Bitcoin is rolled over pretty massively as well.
897.24s: I think that's kind of worth general attention.
901.56s: But yeah, when I look at the general market as it sits now, I think the same thing that
907.68s: I've reiterated for a little while.
910.44s: But I do think we're in a really dangerous point.
914.20s: The reason why I think it's so dangerous is because you're looking at a market where
917.92s: just about everybody thinks they're wrong.
921.84s: And that leads to increase in total volatility.
925.92s: What I mean by that is this, if we take a look at spy, what's happening right now is
933.46s: as the market first starts rolling down, most people are like, this is all good, not
939.88s: worried about it.
941.20s: Everything's okay.
942.20s: Market pulls back.
943.20s: Then it starts taking out term lows like this stuff here.
948.00s: And by this point, the market has already moved a bit if we measure from here to kind of
954.20s: where it first started taking out term lows, that represents a 5% decline.
960.28s: So halfway to a correction at this point, during this halfway to a correction, then
966.84s: you get people starting to say, eh, maybe I should start grabbing some puts here.
974.64s: Maybe I need to start grabbing some puts and hedging this downside risk.
979.00s: And you can see that represented in a bunch of different tools, the skew index is fantastic
985.84s: for this, which helps us understand the different pricing for things like out of the money
991.60s: puts versus calls.
993.72s: And you can see that they started getting the skew, just started getting parabolic and
999.04s: has slowly been trailing down.
1001.52s: You can see that there is these upticks like here, really interesting points on like the
1005.88s: 10th, right, going down, down, down, boom, jumps up and then jumps down.
1010.16s: So what's happening there?
1011.16s: Those are people that are like, they feel they've been caught off guard and they're saying,
1015.36s: oh, shit, I need to actually hedge here.
1019.16s: And I need to go find some puts, which at this point the puts are wildly expensive.
1025.80s: So then you get people scaling into puts as the market is continuing down, right?
1031.16s: Everybody's kind of settling in for the potential that this market rolls over heavy.
1035.80s: And then we finally get to the termination point of at least near term, move in the correction
1043.64s: down to here.
1045.44s: And the termination point of the near term correction is literally just over 10%.
1049.68s: It just nicked over the range that it needs to hit a defined correction.
1056.12s: And with that, we start seeing a little bit of a rally.
1060.08s: Now I've already told you all a bunch of times.
1063.96s: It is very common even during bear markets, they're literally called bear market rallies,
1069.76s: where you will see the market rally anywhere from 8 to 10%.
1073.84s: It can be a pretty strong rally.
1075.96s: So the rally so far represents 3.4%.
1079.44s: If we take this up to what 8% would take us to, it's about here.
1085.24s: So it would almost start to look like recapturing.
1090.16s: Tommy says dead cat bounce.
1092.04s: Similar to a dead cat bounce, the slight difference in my mind, this is a stylistic view, is
1100.76s: a dead cat bounce typically occurs when something has just been punished into oblivion.
1108.64s: And then you see a really small relief rally, slightly different scenario for something
1114.44s: that's literally just taking a 10% correction.
1118.80s: But yeah, similar context, slightly different times in the chart, at least as far as I'm concerned.
1123.88s: So this rally right now is still really, really early stages.
1130.32s: And the key areas to beat here in my mind are here.
1135.64s: If we can start taking out prior swing lows, then the market absolutely starts to look like
1142.84s: it's starting to consolidate, establish a new trading range, that sort of thing.
1147.68s: But this still is embryonic in nature in my opinion.
1151.72s: I think that this is still so, so early.
1154.72s: And the reason why I think that this is super dangerous is because there's lots of people
1158.76s: that bought protection super late on the way down.
1162.76s: And then they get concerned that they grab the protection too expensive.
1166.44s: And then they start trying to figure out different things that they can do with their position
1171.04s: to try and minimize some of that cost.
1174.08s: And then you have the consequent difference of the people here that started scaling in
1180.64s: as it's going down.
1181.64s: And there's people that are like, shit, I wish I grabbed more because there's an idea
1186.40s: that it might start rallying up and out hard from here.
1190.80s: So the way that the market breaks from here, I think is still heavily TBD.
1197.64s: I think that there will be some signs, right?
1200.96s: There's the nearest term low at this point that the market needs to firmly recapture.
1207.28s: And what I mean by that, that's not like price crossing above and falling back below.
1211.04s: It's like a closer to above, decisively above.
1215.20s: And that starts to show a slight change in the overall tone and movement of the market.
1222.24s: But if we zoom out, one of the things I've already drawn your attention to previously
1226.36s: is how different the current market is.
1229.16s: And that is the truth.
1231.24s: The current market is so unique in that as we look at near term price movements, volatility
1238.32s: has gone up on a comparative basis.
1241.92s: And this is an artifact of a lot of leverage being produced into the system of high frequency
1247.60s: trading, trading really short term time frames and extending price massively one way or the
1252.40s: other before other systems step in to move price back down into levels.
1257.32s: So the spike in volatility actually is quite welcomed, especially during the broader market
1264.00s: declines here.
1265.00s: I've been talking a little bit about, and I shared this some during my end of February
1268.96s: performance summary, but a lot of the return sources that are available right now are not
1273.68s: typically available during an extended duration bull market.
1278.16s: And I actually much prefer trading markets like this than extended bull markets.
1283.56s: And it's because when you're trading an extended bull market, you're just constantly sitting
1287.12s: there waiting for the shoot to drop.
1289.40s: You're just waiting for the period where it's no longer good and everything starts to
1295.52s: crater and you're just kind of waiting for them.
1298.40s: So that's kind of annoying.
1300.40s: Whereas when you're trading markets like this, you get a look at trading a bunch of different
1305.68s: things.
1306.68s: I'm dusting off strategies that I haven't had the opportunity to use much in the last
1311.36s: year.
1312.36s: Plus, we did see a bear market in 22, which offered a similar opportunity.
1316.56s: But the other thing to keep in mind is that for selling strategies, you really are getting
1323.20s: compensated more for the risk you're taking, especially if you use like vertical spreads.
1328.12s: The problem with vertical spreads, as you know, is that you're buying wings that are
1334.36s: also overpriced, which again, costs of doing business if you need them.
1338.88s: But then more importantly on top of that is the impact that you see to the movement that
1345.84s: you experience.
1347.60s: So if you're trading some sort of short term volatility style or short premium, you're
1353.04s: absolutely going to see broader movements because volatility is higher.
1356.56s: It's what we expect to see.
1357.56s: And you can see that expressed in the ADR and the ATR that track both daily range and
1365.52s: true range, which are expressions of volatility.
1368.84s: So when I look across the broad market, those are the main things that are sticking out to
1374.08s: me is the alignment of downside pressure across all the indices.
1380.28s: They've become correlated, which is very common during down moves.
1383.16s: They've been, especially the Russell has been less correlated for quite a while.
1388.28s: The VIX is coming down harder than I expected.
1391.72s: I actually didn't finish scaling into my short VIX trade.
1396.76s: And it's simply because I really did think that the VIX would either spike up a little
1403.12s: bit more before it comes back down.
1404.88s: I like, I just didn't expect this severity to the downside, which it's welcome to see,
1410.32s: because it's still a really easy trade to make, but interesting to me.
1414.96s: Then if we take a look at the sectors, calm and tech, the realignment and correlation
1420.60s: of those two is topical to me because that becomes a pairs trade opportunity.
1425.80s: We're still seeing lingering strength primarily from healthcare and utilities.
1431.72s: I still think healthcare, interestingly enough, is actually really well positioned here.
1438.16s: And I think the healthcare sector has been so disgustingly underperforming for so long
1444.96s: that it's actually starting to hit some of my lower bands for total percent return
1449.76s: performance for really long-term timeframes, like 10 years, 15 years, 20 years.
1455.00s: And there's a decent reversion normalization of those relationships.
1459.44s: We'll review some of those on the pro stream tomorrow because there's some specific
1464.16s: trade ideas that come out of the normalization of those movements.
1468.88s: But more broadly, you should at least be aware that that's something that's happening
1472.72s: without a doubt.
1475.00s: So all that said, let's take a quick look at the overall market.
1482.08s: We can see that there's been a really big change in the percentage of companies that
1487.36s: are posting highs and lows specifically as it relates to as a percentage.
1494.36s: I care about the percentage is quite a lot.
1497.28s: And you can track the change in these percentages just like I do with the change week over
1501.40s: a week of sector performance.
1503.48s: The reason for that is because it gives us a preliminary look is to things as they're
1507.24s: starting to rotate in a way that your eyes can't see just from looking at a chart, but
1512.56s: you can see it happening under the internals.
1514.72s: That's the same exact reason why you see me run net highs lows.
1519.80s: It's also why you see on the primary charts things like tick and trend.
1524.20s: Those kinds of metrics really helped me a lot understand where we're at in a current
1529.72s: market cycle.
1531.36s: And again, you can take a look specifically at the net highs lows down here.
1535.48s: This combines both the NASDAQ and New York stock exchange.
1540.48s: It's just because I like to see both of them and it's easier for me to combine them into
1544.96s: a single view, although to the regular viewer, I'm sure this is way noisier.
1550.88s: But the thing I want you to pay attention to on the day is if you take a look at the net
1557.44s: highs lows, New York stock exchange showed positive 37 NASDAQ showed negative 21.
1565.68s: So you're seeing a break in correlation between NIC and NASDAQ.
1572.20s: If you take a look at gross highs in NIC, you see 58 and then in NASDAQ, you see 90.
1580.00s: So we're still seeing gross highs across the board grow, but they're growing faster
1587.40s: in NIC versus NASDAQ.
1591.48s: Now a couple other things that I want to show you really quick and then we can just open
1595.76s: it up to whatever you guys want to take a look at.
1600.48s: This down here, specifically the underperforming, the historically underperforming sectors,
1607.84s: what I find interesting is I still believe that the fade opportunity in materials gets
1616.88s: even more appealing now.
1620.52s: And for those that can't see materials is kind of like the lighter purple.
1625.28s: You can see they've really been declining heavily since mid-FAB and materials in the
1631.16s: short term is on the receiving end a lot of a lot of the the tariff conversation and
1638.72s: the expansion by the way of those tariffs soon enough.
1642.44s: So I think using this bounce not just to play short term bullish ideas, but also reigniting
1651.72s: short term fades is at least in my playbook.
1656.32s: Couple other notes.
1659.12s: Defense contractors, not much movement.
1662.52s: So I talked about this on the pro stream yesterday.
1666.16s: I was highly interested to see how the defense contractors behave today.
1672.68s: And the big reason why I'm so interested is because with the recognition of the US forces
1679.60s: involvement in Yemen and the conduct of different kinds of strikes.
1685.48s: And you can see there is a move today.
1686.88s: It's not like there was no move, but I think a lot of the move that you see today is sympathetic
1691.16s: with the broader market.
1692.16s: I wouldn't really consider it to be idiosyncratic movement based on this news.
1697.40s: All of the news that you see today and most of the stocks is up moderately, right?
1701.08s: Lockheed Martin's up 0.3%.
1703.48s: So I absolutely would not assign much of these movements.
1707.16s: Now Raytheon is a slightly different story because Raytheon was up 1.6%, which is a little
1712.72s: bit more aggressive compared to the others.
1715.64s: And that did surprise me a little bit because you can see the spy was up 0.77%.
1720.84s: So about 3.4% of a point.
1722.92s: What I'm doing here is I'm saying, okay, so for the main defense contractors, how much
1726.88s: of their move is likely due to the broader market move and how much is due to their own
1731.52s: idiosyncratic.
1732.52s: And for these, it mostly looks to be market related, but the exception to that is Raytheon.
1740.36s: Because Raytheon is up 1.6%.
1742.44s: So it's essentially two times what you saw in the S&P 500.
1746.28s: So leads me to believe that there's a couple things going on here.
1751.24s: Now this is not just related to the news that you're seeing related to Yemen and all
1758.56s: that stuff.
1759.76s: You can see that there is a new contract here.
1762.68s: So the broader infrastructure is still continuing to be developed out.
1768.76s: So this isn't anything.
1773.24s: Again, that I would directly attribute to what we're seeing in Yemen.
1778.64s: The last thing is I don't know if you guys saw, but I posted a link yesterday, but I thought
1789.44s: that this was actually just super cool.
1791.80s: I'm not talking about like the political landscape behind it.
1794.24s: I don't care about all that, but I just thought watching the video is sweet because you
1799.44s: can see these people that literally flew from freaking earth into low orbit to connect
1809.76s: to this tiny little station that flies around the earth at like 17,000 miles an hour.
1816.32s: Is that correct?
1817.32s: And let me fact check that.
1818.76s: I don't know.
1820.12s: ISS speed 4.76 miles a second.
1825.84s: Yeah, the little fuck uses that.
1829.00s: There you go.
1830.00s: See, I was right.
1831.76s: Wasn't confident, but 17,400.
1834.68s: These are the random facts that my brain knows that is consuming important information
1839.88s: space that should be used for actually important things.
1843.64s: But instead, I can tell you what the speed of the International Space Station, also fun
1848.32s: fact, the space station does need to use power to keep its distance away from earth.
1854.84s: Otherwise, it kind of slowly drifts towards earth a little bit.
1859.60s: So yeah, okay, another random, that's enough facts about ISS, I think more than most people
1866.92s: probably give a shit about.
1868.20s: I think this stuff is so cool though.
1872.72s: But yeah, if you haven't seen the docking itself, it's super cool.
1876.16s: It's pretty fun.
1877.64s: But yeah, that also went down.
1879.52s: All right, so I'm going to pop the door open for Thor.
1882.08s: And then we are going to turn the session open into whatever you guys want to take a look
1885.92s: at.
1886.92s: All right.
1890.92s: What do we got?
1910.04s: Lauren says it's going to go down again, I think, I mean, I think it's a fair, I do think
1915.80s: it's a fair guess, like I genuinely do.
1917.76s: And I think if I were playing this still from a general pod odds perspective, half the
1925.08s: bet up or down, which again is a losing prospect, by the way, but if that had to happen, again,
1930.80s: as always, we can use options to help us understand what the current probabilities are likely
1936.92s: to be.
1937.92s: So let's take a look.
1942.48s: First thing that I always would look at for something like this is the volatility,
1948.16s: surface and oil.
1955.08s: There we go.
1961.32s: So two things here.
1963.88s: The first thing is you can see that in the near term, the 21 March, the put side is
1971.44s: really high priced in terms of all the IV on the puts out of the money puts is really,
1977.00s: really high.
1978.00s: And then it flattens out when you get towards 17 April.
1981.36s: The other thing is even the call side is still elevated.
1985.04s: So this obviously still represents pretty high front implied volatility, which is not surprising.
1992.64s: But we can also see that this indicates that the market is still actually planning a slightly
1999.12s: higher probability of a smaller upside move and a lower probability of a significant downside
2004.48s: move.
2005.68s: So yeah, I think the assumption that you have is probably, I mean, it's a reasonable
2012.36s: starting point for sure.
2015.20s: Lauren says, did you see the Mark Rober Tesla laser contribute controversy?
2022.64s: I love market drama.
2024.24s: No, literally no nothing about that.
2026.84s: What is it?
2027.84s: What happened?
2029.84s: Mark Rober.
2031.84s: Tesla.
2032.84s: Is there?
2033.84s: This.
2034.84s: This.
2041.84s: Former NASA engineer wanted to test how Tesla's camera camera only approached to self driving
2054.36s: stacks up against LIDAR.
2056.36s: And what is.
2062.20s: Demonstrate differences between Tesla camera only, lighter equipment vehicles break before
2067.78s: crashing into the wall, Tesla powers right through it.
2072.44s: OK.
2073.44s: What's the.
2074.92s: What's the issue?
2086.36s: I'm claiming the video was the secret ploy by Tesla's enemies to honor mine.
2090.68s: Elon's must mission to advance self-driving cars.
2096.32s: Lauren says people are saying it was to drive Tesla stock down.
2102.20s: What?
2104.04s: This is exactly in line with the kind of shit that this dude does.
2107.64s: He tests these ideas.
2109.60s: If anything, I would consider this bullish or autonomous driving cars.
2116.24s: Because it literally identifies a current gap in technology that if you rectify that gap in technology,
2125.08s: then you have a safer system.
2127.72s: That's such a fucking stupid opinion.
2131.08s: Literally doesn't make sense because this is this is a common thing where people think way too short term and way too simplistic.
2145.00s: Because if anything, this is a third party literally conducting research that Tesla is going to see and is going to use to make their shit better.
2160.84s: Right?
2161.56s: So if Tesla is trying to go down the route of like fully autonomous self-driving cars, they need this.
2169.72s: And it's probably nothing new.
2171.32s: My guess is they probably already know this.
2173.88s: But yeah, I just I think that that's such a silly silly takeaway to think that this has been done to drive the price of Tesla down.
2186.92s: That's nuts.
2191.88s: I mean, let's also let's also keep it a G.
2195.36s: Tesla doesn't need any fucking help going down right now.
2198.96s: Tesla is doing that on its own just fine.
2204.96s: No problem for Tesla to find its way lower.
2209.60s: Tesla has literally been cut in half.
2213.28s: This almost starts to look like I already have the coverage strangle on in T triple cues and in SSO.
2222.80s: And I really don't need more exposure to Tesla.
2227.68s: But it does start to look like such a disgusting potential value prop for a longer term idea that it's I've thought about it more than once at this point.
2240.24s: Especially if you choose to get it via something like TSL, which is a two times leverage ETF.
2251.52s: The reason why I like a two times leveraged ETF for Tesla is not because of anything other than the fact that it's cheaper.
2260.08s: I can buy more units per dollar.
2262.64s: And if it goes bankrupt, it can't it doesn't have to go that far. It goes from eight to zero.
2268.56s: So you can size a awesome trade in here.
2273.28s: So this is actually something I was modeling today.
2275.68s: I was going to talk about this tomorrow, but I'll talk about it now a little bit.
2279.44s: Because it's really interesting.
2281.60s: So if you take a look at TSL, which I normally don't trade it, by the way.
2287.76s: But if you take a look at it and from an equity perspective, let's say we use our standard account size.
2296.80s: We use standard $100,000 account and we use our standard risk protocols for $100,000 account, which is essentially us saying something like,
2308.16s: we would like to keep things generally between like one and three percent max risk for something like this.
2315.04s: Maybe we pick two percent max risk.
2317.44s: So on a $100,000 account, it gives you two grand to play with.
2322.16s: Well, if you buy 200 shares that immediately puts the total risk that you have sub two grand,
2330.88s: like you can even probably grab a little bit more if you're so inclined.
2334.08s: But then if this starts to recapture anything even similar to what we've seen before,
2341.28s: which I'll zoom this out, if this starts to capture, let's call it 3850.
2346.72s: Let's add a thing here.
2349.52s: Let's add 38.5.
2352.96s: It's a $6,000 gain.
2355.68s: I mean, in terms of a return on risk, I don't hate that play.
2364.56s: Now, the reality is there's not an insignificant probability that TSL, it literally could go bankrupt.
2374.40s: Now, it would require a pretty significant sustained down move for Tesla, even with it trading as low as $8.34.
2382.24s: But that's still not outside the entire realm of possibility.
2386.56s: Like that could happen.
2388.72s: But with respect to a return on risk profile,
2393.68s: I mean, you're taking a pretty low risk for a chance to double plus your money.
2398.72s: Now, it becomes more dangerous, especially for small portfolios that see this kind of thing.
2405.92s: And then they just get jacked to the tits and try to run this all the way through.
2411.76s: That's real dangerous, right?
2413.76s: Like putting a massive percent of your portfolio in something like this.
2417.84s: Because again, this can go bankrupt to be clear.
2420.80s: Let's take a look at TS, LL, holdings.
2425.44s: We're going to look at how it creates the leverage.
2434.40s: Let's see.
2441.52s: It's interesting that it combines them both.
2443.84s: I would like to see what they're holding.
2452.48s: I don't want to fucking PDF, bro.
2466.08s: No.
2469.36s: No.
2472.40s: I mean, I know it's going to be through derivatives.
2474.32s: I just don't know what specific derivatives I would like to know.
2481.36s: No.
2483.36s: Oh, here we go.
2484.32s: Daily fund holdings.
2486.96s: Yes, we.
2488.40s: Here we go.
2489.52s: Let's see.
2492.72s: Grafist government cash.
2494.32s: So they're actually massively in cash right now.
2499.44s: More cash.
2502.32s: So they have a ton of cash.
2507.28s: And then see, look, this is the way that they're creating the leverage.
2512.16s: Is they're using swaps.
2518.64s: So I mean,
2522.32s: I mean, they have a ton of cash.
2527.04s: An absolute ton of cash.
2528.72s: It's kind of the cool part by the way.
2531.60s: Of trading leverage things is because you don't have to use as much money to trade them.
2535.92s: I've already made that point a million times and I've showed you examples of
2539.68s: these stuff like T-Triple Cues and SSO. This is the,
2545.28s: this is the reality behind like using leverage as you can use leverage logically.
2552.40s: But this isn't like the fucking Michael sailor,
2556.00s: intelligent leverage, Ponzi's scheme shit.
2558.24s: This is actually like legitimate use of leverage.
2561.52s: Paul says the cash is collateral presumably.
2566.56s: I don't know.
2570.32s: It doesn't really matter what it is, but I don't know like what percentage of it would be collateral.
2575.44s: Because the thing is is that, well, let's see.
2578.40s: So for T.S., I'm asking in Chattapetit.
2581.92s: We'll see if it can do some analysis for us.
2586.16s: I need to use my research guy.
2588.64s: So for TSL, the fund holds large amounts of cash and creates the leverage via swaps.
2601.12s: What kind of collateral is commonly used for leveraged ETFs that are using swaps for
2614.24s: look? Good that says.
2621.84s: Many, many leverage ETFs hold large cash positions in T-bills or repo,
2627.60s: provides stability and ensures meet daily margin requirements. So
2632.88s: it looks like a little bit of everything. Money market, repo, collateralized.
2638.40s: I don't know what the percentage is.
2641.84s: Since the leverages synthetic via swaps, the fund doesn't need to fully invest in TSL,
2645.76s: which we know. The cash and T-bills serve as collateral. So let's see what the
2653.12s: percentage typically is. What is the percentage of cash held typically as collateral?
2663.60s: So it looks like less than half would be for collateral. The funds often hold way more,
2676.40s: like 50 to 80%, but not really for a collateral perspective, which is because they don't need as much.
2686.48s: Roderick says, could a leap on Tesla make sense instead of TSL when DTE is greater than one
2691.92s: year for taxes? They're just very different traits. So you would have to figure out
2699.20s: what the idea is and what the consideration is. The reason being is because
2705.28s: if you take a look at something like Tesla, which is just wildly, wildly volatile,
2711.12s: even if you go super far out in time, let's say that you pick something that's 368 days.
2718.88s: And let's say you get something that's like a synthetic stock equivalent. So let's go to like
2723.84s: 85 delta's or something like that. The problem is that you're going to put up, call it 10,000,
2734.08s: 10,700. And you're going to be chewing away $7 a day per contract in day to decay. Even for
2744.80s: an option that's as far out in time as this, and as deep in the money as this, there's nothing
2750.88s: wrong with it, but you're paying a pretty penny for the leverage and something like this because
2757.20s: of how volatile it is. So definitely could be done. There's nothing wrong with it. It's just a
2763.76s: very different trade than something like TSL, at least in the way that I would run it.
2770.48s: So yeah, definitely could do that though if you wanted.
2773.68s: Scott says Tesla's a company is like that dude named Brock from high school. That's a complete
2779.20s: tool and peaked at 17. I couldn't really disagree more. I think Tesla is at the cutting edge
2789.92s: in terms of electric vehicle. If you think about it, Tesla is what caused all of the other
2798.88s: automotive manufacturers to start taking this seriously, the electronic vehicle space.
2807.04s: So I actually give Tesla a lot more respect than that personally.
2811.04s: Roderick says 30% ETN to swap and balance safe, typically, I think that's way too little,
2817.84s: especially in something volatile like this. I would imagine the collateral that
2824.64s: something like TSLL would possess right now would probably be north of 50%, probably 50% to 60%
2830.96s: in terms of total collateralization of the cash. And I think in normal settings, based on what I
2836.56s: read from GPT, which would align with my intuition would be something between like 40% and 50%.
2843.36s: But the reality is, is most leveraged funds do hold tons of cash. And again, it's because they
2852.24s: don't have to hold because they're using swaps. So if we take a look at T-Triple Q holding just for
2858.88s: another example from another provider, right? So this is from ProShare's versus Direction.
2863.76s: And let's take a look at what they have.
2869.52s: Here. So we can see that it's primarily done via swaps. And then they do hold the underlying.
2891.68s: And then their cash position, right? So they're sitting on massive, massive, massive piles of cash.
2900.48s: So yeah. So we'll see. But I do, I do like the TSLL idea. It's, that would be like a massively
2915.12s: highly speculative trade for me. That would be size very small. And it would be something that I
2921.92s: would probably just trade the coverage wrangling because the volume here is just psychotic.
2926.64s: Look at this. For something that's $7, you can collect 10% essentially to cash secure that.
2934.88s: Like that's an insane return. So, but there is a absolute reality where TSLL could easily get cut in
2943.44s: half and lower probability, but TSLL could conceivably go and solve it. Like that is not outside
2951.12s: the realm of possibility for something like this. And it's really important when you're trading
2954.40s: things like this, even if it's something that's a lower probability, like we still have to acknowledge
2960.48s: that this is something that can happen because it most certainly can happen like without a doubt.
2966.56s: I wouldn't expect to see it personally because well, we could do the math. We can see like how
2972.00s: many consecutive down days that we would need to have. But it would probably be enough that I would
2979.20s: wager its fairly low probability, but not a zero probability, which is different.
2989.84s: Cool. Anything else you guys want to hit? If not, I'm going to keep the stream on just because I'm
2995.44s: going to look through the markets a little bit, but I'm not really going to be as
3001.36s: talk to the camera necessarily, but you guys are free to hang out if you'd like.
3005.92s: What I'm doing now is just poking through my portfolio really fast.
3012.80s: I'm generally good with the exposure, but I need to pack a couple things.
3019.76s: So what I'm looking at now is the iBit allocation, which might need to change.
3026.16s: James says, do you have time to go over ive leading up to earnings? Yeah, definitely. Let's do that.
3031.52s: That's way more fun. Wait, ive.
3042.08s: Did I miss read that?
3047.84s: ive.
3052.00s: ive expansion.
3053.84s: Oh, you mean like the like the broader effect? I see.
3060.88s: So I have, did you watch the video? I have on trading earnings with options.
3071.28s: This video.
3073.36s: Because if you haven't, you should watch that first. And then if you haven't, you still have
3077.84s: questions, I'm more than happy. And then Paul says, no, you don't have to watch it again.
3083.60s: If you have specific questions on it, then 100% ask me. But if you watched it, then I imagine
3089.20s: you know the basics, right? Of ive expansion leading into earnings. So it leads me to then assume
3094.56s: that you have like more specific questions than like the broad, than the broad effect.
3099.76s: So I just want to answer the meaningful stuff for you. And then Paul says, how do you choose
3104.64s: between various types of limit order? Does it matter much? It matters a ton.
3108.32s: Matters a whole lot. I don't know if I still have that. Let me see. Order
3113.36s: type.
3115.84s: Thought I had like a video that talked about order types. Yeah, it's probably because it's not that
3121.36s: anyways. So for order types, the way to think about it, at least for me, is generally speaking
3131.60s: on entry, I'm going to prefer some sort of limit order, right? So if I'm looking at TSL
3139.60s: and let's say that I wanted to trade the options in here. So I would come into cell. And then I
3147.20s: would, if I want to play the bid-ass spread, then I would run a limit order, right? Because I want
3154.40s: to attempt to get filled at the price I'm denoting or better. And I can typically do this when I'm
3158.80s: trying to enter trades because I have the luxury of time. It's not really a rush. When I'm looking
3163.28s: to exit trades, I typically will try to use an exit order if I'm manually inputting them. Again,
3168.48s: just to get a better, a better capture on the bid-ass spread. But if I'm setting things like
3175.92s: stops, it's going to be a stop market unless it's a profit. And then if it's a profit, it's typically
3182.00s: an OCO where I will have a stop limit than a stop market. So it'll still include a stop market.
3190.08s: And the reason is because specifically for stops, one of the big mistakes traders do is they try
3196.16s: to get really cheap. They say like, oh, I want to get stopped out, but I want to get X number of
3202.32s: dollars. And the problem with that is that you can then thus not get stopped out, which, right,
3209.60s: is straight trash. So I'll show you what that can look like. If we go into TSL, this is,
3217.84s: let me find here, perfect example. Let's say here, you were like, I think it's going to go up
3227.76s: from here. That's the trade idea. But I want to make sure that if I'm wrong, I'm not wrong a
3232.96s: whole lot. I'm going to use the low of a day. And let's just, I can't really tell what it is. Let's
3238.00s: call it like 2730. So 2730 was the low of the day. And I'm going to set a stop limit
3252.88s: at 2730. So normally what would happen is you would set the stop, the trigger would be at like 27
3260.72s: 35. So it means once price hits 2735, I want to try to route this order. And the order that would
3270.56s: actually be routed would be buy to close, whatever it is at 2730. Well, here's the problem. If it
3281.36s: opens down here at 25, this can't get filled. So the spot that you wanted to get out at because
3294.72s: you were trying to be cheap, because you didn't want the scenario where, you know, you don't want to
3302.96s: get a bad fill. Well, because you didn't want to get a bad fill, you're now going to get out at $2.30
3310.24s: cheaper. So you're not filled, but you're still in something you wanted to be out at a terrible
3317.68s: price now. So that's the big thing that's like where it really does matter in my opinion is when
3323.44s: it comes to stops, because everybody will tell you that if you use like a stop market or just a
3328.88s: market order in general, you're, they kind of suck because you're going to get a bad fill. But again,
3335.12s: it's always keeping first things first, right? Like what is the purpose of this stop? The purpose of
3341.44s: the stop isn't necessarily to, you know, get the best possible price you humanly can. It's to get
3347.92s: the fuck out of the trade when things are not going the way that they should be. So then if you
3353.04s: reorder those and you say, well, I'm going to care more about getting a better fill than getting
3356.88s: out of the trade, then you might not get out of the trade. So it's just getting confused and
3360.32s: focusing on the wrong, on the wrong function. Alberto says, man, Eric does have a video for
3367.60s: everything. I do have a video for a lot of stuff. And it's one of the reasons why the channel
3373.52s: funny enough typically performs really poorly in terms of like when I launch a video and how many
3378.80s: views that they'll get. And part of it is because I know the content that I cover and I know that
3386.80s: people will have questions about it. So I always title the videos, how I would think about the
3393.04s: topic so that I could quickly search for them so that I could show them to people, which is
3398.80s: absolutely hilarious. But I was thinking about it that actually goes back to the, you know,
3405.84s: to the grassroots element of the channel and the original point of why I made this whole thing.
3411.84s: But it's so funny because like you're supposed to play a lot of games with titles, right? To like
3416.48s: get people intrigued and to, you know, make them fearful and make them want to click something to
3421.68s: help figure out the fear. And I'm literally just out here labeling shit something that I know I'll
3427.28s: remember to, you know, type in the search bar so that I can find it for you guys is pretty comical.
3433.36s: All right. That wraps me up. If you need anything, hit me up in the discord. You know, I'll
3437.44s: learn. See you later.
