330.00s:  you
360.00s:  you
390.00s:  you
420.00s:  actually came in heavier month of a month that came in light. So there's a bit of a mix
426.08s:  in terms of expectations against what we actually ended up seeing. So if we take a look now,
433.44s:  I want to specifically look at the Empire State Manufacturing Index. So New York Empire State
439.36s:  Manufacturing. Let's grab this bad boy right there. And let's take a look together, shall we?
450.08s:  Looks like we got unburdened croissants. It's great to get rid of the burden. So I love that.
455.28s:  We have Tommy Josh Lauren. Why not? Tommy says it's a bug. It's in the software toss.
463.20s:  Well, it's actually from Benzinga, but close enough. I want to say Joey and Paulo,
469.12s:  great to see you guys. Joey, you and I were talking about your coverage stranglestuff, which I
473.68s:  still think the ball is in your court for the next response. Just saying, let's take a look at
483.12s:  what do I want to see? First, I want this to actually move. Here we go. Okay. So I'm going to zoom
492.24s:  this in. And you can see that it really came in declining pretty heavily actually, which is kind
502.88s:  of interesting. So general business conditions index fell 26 points to negative 20.
514.32s:  New orders and shipments decline delivery times and supply availability held steady. So this is
519.60s:  good. We're not seeing. Sometimes this can be inflationary in nature, depending on the way that
525.60s:  this metric behaves, but this looks fine. The new orders and shipments, that actually surprises me
533.60s:  a little bit because my expectation with the broader Trump tariffs and all that stuff is that
538.56s:  we would see a surge in orders and shipments so that people can get as much as they possibly can
547.28s:  get done before we see the tariffs come into place. And inventories continue to grow.
556.48s:  Inventories growing is absolutely part of that. No no shock there.
561.52s:  Employment levels hours continue to move slightly lower. We obviously expect that.
567.92s:  And then input prices increase the fastest pace in more than two years. So we obviously also know a
574.72s:  lot of what's going on there. And selling price increases also continue to pick up again,
579.36s:  reflective of input prices. So optimism about the outlook waned considerably for a second
586.56s:  consecutive month. So here again is a pretty significant impact from the overall tone and tenor
594.72s:  of what the market is doing. So nothing in here I'd look at it and it's not like, yeah, that you
599.52s:  know, it's like shocking that that would be the case. This all seems about par for the course
604.64s:  unfortunately to a degree. But this is very likely going to be much of what we're going to expect to
611.20s:  see, especially as the the tariff situation continues to work its way through the through the broader
617.04s:  system. So yeah, no real big shock here, I think.
624.96s:  Scott says, what's up with GME low volume? I think it's coming in on an earnings week during
630.24s:  pretty quiet period in general for the broader market. I think all eyes right now from a broader
636.08s:  market lens are on tech for sure. Because if we take a look at aggregate volumes of today in terms
643.60s:  of like what was trading the most, it's pretty much all tech. And tech is kind of like in a maker
653.60s:  break, make a break level, I think. So let's take a look really quick. I want to look at price
660.00s:  and volume. Here we go, price and volume leaders. Here. So you can see if we look across the board,
668.56s:  this is bringing in price and volume, not just volume, right? So we can get like a weighted based
674.40s:  on the total values exchanging. And you can see that this just lands super heavy tech. So tech
680.16s:  right now is still a maker break segment of the broader market. And this is also really common
687.84s:  by the way, specifically for companies like GameStop, I've actually talked about this recently,
691.76s:  but for companies in general that as you come into earnings, typically the few days before,
696.56s:  unless there's crazy stuff going on, they generally will mellow out a little bit.
701.20s:  Now one really important note that I don't know if you can tell by this really busy chart,
706.64s:  but it's one of my favorites is if you take a look at comm services relative to technology,
712.56s:  fascinating relationship here, because you can see that the lead in up here, right? Even if you
718.72s:  just take a look at the moving averages, and if you take a look at the levels, like for the last
723.44s:  three months, like the first portion of the last three months leading into midfab, this is kind of
729.84s:  tech was trailing sideways. And you can see comm services were actually gaining pretty heavily.
737.20s:  And then around the same time frame, they both correlated. And in the snap of a finger,
743.92s:  simultaneously both dropped at a very similar rate, which is also super interesting for two things
751.52s:  that were in a high level of correlation and then fell out of that high level of correlation.
759.04s:  I thought that that was really, really interesting. So let's, I'm going to just adjust these two
763.76s:  really quick to show you the last six months instead of the three.
769.92s:  Right, like take a look at the difference in performance over the last slightly longer term
775.28s:  time frame of six months versus three months. And you can see like a very stark contrast between
783.36s:  comm services and tech. So even though in the near term, it looks like comm services and tech
791.28s:  have reengaged and are now generally moving correlated to one another, it's not in the same
798.56s:  broader context. Com services is still way stronger on a comparative basis relative to broader tech,
807.68s:  which again, I do think is generally worth your consideration. And if we take a look at the
814.08s:  indices in the same context, I'll change these as well to six. And I want you to take a look at
821.28s:  the lead in to where we sit today compared to the last essentially from midfab. That's one of the
828.96s:  big turn started happening across the board. So as I flip these, you'll notice a big change
837.52s:  in two things, but the correlation between them interestingly moves quite a lot. And
847.60s:  this highlights how near term in short term correlations can change and how fickle they can be.
856.48s:  Because if you take a look at spy and cues, spy had actually held on longer than cues did,
865.92s:  meaning in terms of this move in here and the recapturing of near term highs,
871.36s:  whereas the Russell, if we look back over the last six months, has effectively been in decline.
877.36s:  The Russell has been out of the conversation for some time now. And it's because all of these
883.36s:  broader market conditions that we're looking at, at least today, really do not favor the Russell
890.24s:  in any significant fashion. It's just kind of how it is. Bitcoin is rolled over pretty massively as
896.72s:  well. I think that's kind of worth general attention. But yeah, when I look at the general market as
904.48s:  it sits now, I think the same thing that I've reiterated for a little while. But I do think we're
911.84s:  in a really dangerous point. The reason why I think it's so dangerous is because you're looking at
917.12s:  a market where just about everybody thinks they're wrong. And that leads to increase in total
925.04s:  volatility. What I mean by that is this, if we take a look at spy, what's happening right now
932.72s:  is as the market first starts rolling down, most people are like, this is all good, not worried
940.16s:  about it. Everything's okay. Market pulls back. Then it starts taking out term lows,
946.24s:  like this stuff here. And by this point, the market has already moved a bit. If we measure from
952.56s:  here to kind of where it first started taking out term lows, that represents a 5% decline. So halfway
961.60s:  to a correction at this point, during this halfway to a correction, then you get people starting to
968.16s:  say, eh, maybe I should start grabbing some puts here. Maybe I need to start grabbing some puts
976.72s:  and hedging this downside risk. And you can see that represented in a bunch of different
982.96s:  tools, the SKU index is fantastic for this, which helps us understand the different pricing
989.92s:  for things like out of the money puts versus calls. And you can see that they started getting
996.08s:  the SKU just started getting parabolic and has slowly been trailing down. You can see that there's
1002.32s:  these upticks like here, really interesting points on like the 10th, right, going down, down, down,
1007.68s:  boom, jumps up and then jumps down. So what's happening there? Those are people that are like,
1012.56s:  they feel they've been caught off guard. And they're saying, oh, shit, I need to actually hedge here.
1018.72s:  And I need to go find some puts, which at this point, the puts are wildly expensive.
1025.60s:  So then you get people scaling into puts as the market is continuing down, right? Everybody's
1031.12s:  kind of settling in for the potential that this market rolls over heavy. And then we finally get to
1037.92s:  the termination point of at least near term move in the correction down to here. And the termination
1046.08s:  point of the near term correction is literally just over 10%. It just nicked over the range that it
1052.72s:  needs to hit a defined correction. And with that, we start seeing a little bit of a rally.
1059.92s:  Now I've already told you all a bunch of times. It is very common even during bear markets.
1067.20s:  They're literally called bear market rallies where you'll see the market rally anywhere from
1072.16s:  eight to 10%. It can be a pretty strong rally. So the rally so far represents 3.4%.
1079.20s:  If we take this up to what 8% would take us to, it's about here. So it would almost start to look
1088.00s:  like recapturing. Tommy says dead cat bounce. It's similar to a dead cat bounce. The slight
1096.40s:  difference in my mind, this is a stylistic view, is a dead cat bounce typically occurs when something
1104.00s:  has just been punished into oblivion. And then you see a really small relief rally.
1112.16s:  A slightly different scenario for something that's literally just taking a 10%
1117.92s:  correction. But yeah, similar context, slightly different times in the chart, at least as far as
1122.24s:  I'm concerned. So this rally right now is still really, really early stages. And the key areas to
1132.00s:  beat here in my mind are here. If we can start taking out prior swing lows, then the market
1141.12s:  absolutely starts to look like it's starting to consolidate, establish a new trading range,
1146.00s:  that sort of thing. But this still is embryonic in nature in my opinion. I think that this is
1152.48s:  still so, so early. And the reason why I think that this is super dangerous is because there's
1157.52s:  lots of people that bought protection super late on the way down. And then they get concerned that
1163.92s:  they grab the protection too expensive. And then they start trying to figure out different things
1168.88s:  that they can do with their position to try and minimize some of that cost. And then you have
1174.96s:  the consequent difference of the people here that started scaling in as it's going down. And
1181.68s:  there's people that are like, shit, I wish I grabbed more because there's an idea that it might
1186.96s:  start rallying up and out hard from here. So the way that the market breaks from here, I think
1194.80s:  is still heavily TBD. I think that there will be some signs, right? Here's the nearest term low
1202.80s:  at this point that the market needs to firmly recapture. And what I mean by that, that's not like
1208.80s:  price crossing above and falling back below. It's like a closer to above, decisively above.
1214.80s:  And that starts to show a slight change in the overall tone and movement of the market.
1222.00s:  But if we zoom out, one of the things I've already drawn your attention to previously is
1227.20s:  how different the current market is. And that is the truth. The current market is so unique in
1234.08s:  that as we look at near term price movements, volatility has gone up on a comparative basis.
1241.60s:  And this is an artifact of a lot of leverage being produced into the system of high frequency
1247.60s:  trading, trading really short term time frames and extending price massively one way or the other
1252.64s:  before other systems step in to move price back down into levels. So the spike in volatility
1260.32s:  actually is quite welcomed, especially during the broader market declines here. I've been talking
1265.28s:  a little bit about, and I shared this some during my end of February performance summary.
1270.56s:  But a lot of the return sources that are available right now are not typically available during an
1275.04s:  extended duration bull market. And I actually much prefer trading markets like this than extended
1282.16s:  bull markets. And it's because when you're trading an extended bull market, you're just constantly
1286.80s:  sitting there waiting for the shoot to drop. You're just waiting for the period where it's no
1292.80s:  longer good and everything starts to crater. And you're just kind of waiting for that. So that's
1299.36s:  kind of annoying. Whereas when you're trading markets like this, you get a look at trading a bunch
1305.20s:  of different things. I'm dusting off strategies that I haven't had the opportunity to use much
1310.32s:  in the last year plus we did see a bear market in 22, which offered a similar opportunity. But
1317.04s:  the other thing to keep in mind is that for selling strategies, you really are getting compensated
1323.84s:  more for the risk you're taking, especially if you use vertical spreads. The problem with vertical
1329.44s:  spreads, as you know, is that you're buying wings that are also overpriced, which again,
1336.32s:  costs to do in business if you need them. But then more importantly on top of that is the impact
1343.20s:  that you see to the movement that you experience. So if you're trading some sort of short-term
1350.32s:  volatility style or short premium, you're absolutely going to see broader movements because
1355.52s:  volatility is higher. It's what we expect to see. And you can see that expressed in the ADR and
1360.40s:  the ATR that track both daily range and true range, which are expressions of volatility.
1368.64s:  So when I look across the broad market, those are the main things that are sticking out to me is
1375.52s:  the alignment of downside pressure across all the indices. They've become correlated, which is
1381.52s:  very common during down moves. They've been, especially the Russell, who's been less correlated
1386.24s:  for quite a while. The VIX is coming down harder than I expected. I actually didn't finish
1393.20s:  scaling into my short VIX trade. And it's simply because I really did think that the VIX would
1401.52s:  either spike up a little bit more before it comes back down. I just didn't expect this
1406.96s:  severity to the downside, which it's welcome to see because it's still a really easy trade to make,
1412.24s:  but interesting to me. Then if we take a look at the sectors,
1417.12s:  calm and tech, the realignment and correlation of those two is topical to me because that becomes
1423.52s:  a pairs trade opportunity. We're still seeing lingering strength primarily from health care
1429.84s:  and utilities. I still think health care, interestingly enough, is actually really well positioned
1436.88s:  here. And I think the health care sector has been so disgustingly underperforming for so long
1444.80s:  that it's actually starting to hit some of my lower bands for total percent return performance
1450.64s:  for really long-term timeframes, like 10 years, 15 years, 20 years. And there's a decent
1456.40s:  reversion normalization of those relationships. We'll review some of those on the pro stream tomorrow
1462.24s:  because there's some specific trade ideas that come out of the normalization of those movements,
1468.64s:  but more broadly, you should at least be aware that that's something that's happening without a doubt.
1474.80s:  So all that said, let's take a quick look at the overall market. We can see that there's been a
1483.44s:  really big change in the percentage of companies that are posting highs and lows, specifically
1491.68s:  as it relates to as a percentage. I care about the percentage is quite a lot. And you can track
1498.00s:  the change in these percentages just like I do with the change week over week of sector performance.
1503.28s:  The reason for that is because it gives us a preliminary look is to things as they're starting
1507.84s:  to rotate in a way that your eyes can't see just from looking at a chart, but you can see it
1513.04s:  happening under the internals. It's the same exact reason why you see me run net highs lows.
1519.52s:  It's also why you see on the primary charts things like Tick and Tren. Those kinds of metrics
1525.28s:  really help me a lot understand where we're at in a current market cycle. And again, you can take a
1533.12s:  specifically at the net highs lows down here. This combines both the NASDAQ and New York Stock
1539.76s:  Exchange. It's just because I like to see both of them and it's easier for me to combine them into
1544.96s:  a single view, although to the regular viewer. I'm sure this is way noisier. But the thing I want
1552.32s:  you to pay attention to on the day is if you take a look at the net highs lows, New York Stock
1559.76s:  Exchange showed positive 37 NASDAQ showed negative 21. So you're seeing a break in correlation between
1570.32s:  NYC and NASDAQ. If you take a look at gross highs in NYC, you see 58 and then in NASDAQ, you see 90.
1579.76s:  So we're still seeing gross highs across the board grow, but they're growing faster in NYC.
1589.20s:  Versus NASDAQ. Now a couple other things that I want to show you really quick and then we can just
1595.44s:  open it up to whatever you guys want to take a look at. This down here, specifically the underperforming,
1603.76s:  the historically underperforming sectors, what I find interesting is I still believe that the
1613.20s:  fade opportunity and materials gets even more appealing now. And for those that can't see materials
1622.08s:  as kind of like the lighter purple, you can see they've really been declining heavily since mid-FAB
1630.08s:  and materials in the short term is on the receiving end a lot of a lot of the the tariff conversation
1638.64s:  and the expansion by the way of those tariffs soon enough. So I think using this bounce not just to play
1647.20s:  short term bullish ideas, but also reigniting short term fades is at least in my playbook. A couple
1656.32s:  other notes, defense contractors, not much movement. So I talked about this on the pro stream yesterday.
1666.08s:  I was highly interested to see how the defense contractors behave today. And the big reason why I'm
1674.08s:  so interested is because with the recognition of the US forces involvement in Yemen and the
1682.96s:  conduct of different kinds of strikes. And you can see there is a move today. It's not like there was
1687.52s:  no move, but I think a lot of the move that you see today is sympathetic with the broader market.
1691.92s:  I wouldn't really consider it to be idiosyncratic movement based on this news. All of the news that
1697.92s:  you see today and most of the stocks is up moderately, right? Lockheed Martin's up 0.3%. So I absolutely would
1704.96s:  not assign much of these movements. Now, Raytheon is a slightly different story because Raytheon was
1710.32s:  up 1.6%, which is a little bit more aggressive compared to the others. And that did surprise me a little
1717.20s:  bit because you can see the spy was up 0.77% today. So about three quarters of a point. What I'm doing
1723.28s:  here is I'm saying, okay, so for the main defense contractors, how much of their move is likely due
1727.92s:  to the broader market move and how much is due to their own idiosyncratic. And for these, it mostly
1734.00s:  looks to be market related, but the exception to that is Raytheon because Raytheon is up 1.6%.
1742.32s:  So it's essentially two times what you saw in the S&P 500. So leads me to believe that there's
1749.76s:  a couple things going on here. Now, this is not just related to the news that you're seeing
1757.44s:  related to Yemen and all that stuff. You can see that there is a new contract here. So the
1764.00s:  broader infrastructure is still continuing to be developed out. So this isn't anything
1773.20s:  again that I would directly attribute to what we're seeing in Yemen. The last thing is I don't
1781.92s:  know if you guys saw, but I posted a link yesterday, but I thought that this was actually just
1790.56s:  super cool. I'm not talking about like the political landscape behind it. I don't care about
1794.72s:  all that, but I just thought watching the video is sweet because you can see these people that
1802.08s:  literally flew from freaking earth into low orbit to connect to this tiny little station that
1812.40s:  flies around the earth that like 17,000 miles an hour. Is that correct? And let me fact check that.
1818.56s:  I don't know. I SS speed. 4.76 miles a second. Yeah, the little fuck uses that. There you go. See,
1829.52s:  I was right. Wasn't confident, but 17,400. These are the random facts that my brain knows that is
1838.00s:  consuming important information space that should be used for actually important things. But instead,
1843.92s:  I can tell you what the speed of the international space station also fun fact, the space station
1850.72s:  does need to use power to keep its distance away from earth. Otherwise, it kind of slowly drifts
1856.72s:  towards earth a little bit. So yeah, okay, another random. That's enough facts about ISS, I think,
1865.60s:  more than most people probably give a shit about. I think this stuff is so cool though.
1870.56s:  But yeah, if you haven't seen the docking itself, it's super cool. It's pretty fun. But yeah,
1878.00s:  that also went down. All right, so I'm going to pop the door open for Thor and then we are going
1882.80s:  to turn the session open into whatever you guys want to take a look at.
1899.68s:  All right. What do we got? Lauren says it's going to go down again, I think, I mean, I think it's a
1913.84s:  fair, I do think it's a fair guess like I genuinely do. And I think if I were playing this still
1922.08s:  from a general pod odds perspective, half to bet up or down, which again is a losing prospect,
1927.60s:  by the way. But if that had to happen, again, as always, we can use options to help us understand
1934.56s:  what the current probabilities are likely to be. So let's take a look.
1942.08s:  First thing that I always would look at for something like this is the volatility,
1947.92s:  surface and oil.
1957.68s:  There we go. So two things here. The first thing is you can see that in the near term,
1968.56s:  the 21 March, the put side is really high priced in terms of vol. The IV on the puts out of the
1975.92s:  money puts is really, really high. And then it flattens out when you get towards 17 April. The
1981.36s:  other thing is even the call side is still elevated. So this obviously still represents
1987.20s:  pretty high front implied volatility, which is not surprising. But we can also see that this
1994.88s:  indicates that the market is still actually planning a slightly higher probability of a smaller
2000.80s:  upside move and a lower probability of a significant downside move. So yeah, I think the
2008.00s:  the assumption that you have is probably, I mean, it's a reasonable starting point for sure.
2013.20s:  Lauren says, did you see the Mark Rober Tesla laser contribute controversy?
2022.88s:  I love market drama. No, literally no nothing about that. What is it?
2028.64s:  What happened? Mark Rober?
2034.64s:  Tesla?
2035.36s:  Tesla?
2036.56s:  Is there?
2047.68s:  This former NASA engineer wanted to test how Tesla's camera camera only approached to
2053.04s:  self driving stacks up against LIDAR. Oh, it does.
2056.72s:  Yes.
2061.68s:  Demonstrate differences between Tesla camera only.
2066.08s:  LIDAR equip vehicles break before crashing into the wall. Tesla powers right through it. Okay.
2073.36s:  What's the what's the issue?
2076.00s:  I don't know.
2086.24s:  Some claim the video was the secret ploy by Tesla's enemies to honor mine. Elon's
2091.20s:  must mission to advance self driving cars.
2096.24s:  Lauren says people are saying it was to drive Tesla stock down.
2100.16s:  What?
2103.92s:  This is exactly in line with the kind of shit that this dude does. He tests these ideas.
2109.52s:  If anything, I would consider this bullish for autonomous driving cars.
2116.16s:  Because it literally identifies a current gap in technology that if you rectify that gap in
2123.44s:  technology, then you have a safer system. That's such a fucking stupid opinion.
2130.72s:  It literally doesn't make sense. Because this is a common thing where people think way too short
2142.56s:  term and way too simplistic. Because if anything, this is a third party literally conducting
2153.12s:  research that Tesla is going to see and is going to use to make their shit better.
2161.68s:  If Tesla is trying to go down the route of fully autonomous self driving cars, they need this.
2170.08s:  It's probably nothing new. My guess is they probably already know this.
2173.76s:  But yeah, I just I think that that's such a silly, silly takeaway to think that this has been
2182.24s:  done to drive the price of Tesla down. That's nuts. I mean, let's also keep it a G.
2195.76s:  Tesla doesn't need any fucking help going down right now. Tesla is doing that on its own just fine.
2204.08s:  No problem for Tesla to find its way lower. Tesla has literally been cut in half.
2213.28s:  This almost starts to look like I already have the coverage strangle on in T triple cues and in SSO.
2223.36s:  And I really don't need more exposure to Tesla. But it does start to look like such a
2231.20s:  disgusting potential value prop for a longer term idea that it's I've thought about it more
2237.84s:  than once at this point, especially if you choose to get it via something like TSL,
2248.00s:  which is a two times leverage ETF. The reason why I like a two times leveraged ETF for Tesla is not
2256.48s:  because of anything other than the fact that it's cheaper. I can buy more units per dollar.
2262.64s:  And if it goes bankrupt, it doesn't have to go that far. It goes from eight to zero.
2268.56s:  So you can size a awesome trade in here. So this is actually something I was modeling today. I
2275.76s:  was going to talk about this tomorrow, but I'll talk about it now a little bit because it's really
2280.32s:  interesting. So if you take a look at TSL, which I normally don't trade it, by the way,
2287.68s:  but if you take a look at it and from an equity perspective, let's say we use our standard
2295.52s:  account size. We use standard $100,000 account and we use our standard risk protocols for $100,000
2305.36s:  account, which is essentially us saying something like, we would like to keep things generally
2311.52s:  between like one and three percent max risk for something like this. Maybe we pick two percent max risk.
2317.44s:  So on a $100,000 account, it gives you two grand to play with. Well, if you buy 200 shares
2325.20s:  that immediately puts the total risk that you have sub two grand, like you can even probably grab
2332.16s:  a little bit more if you're so inclined. But then if this starts to recapture anything even
2338.40s:  similar to what we've seen before, which I'll zoom this out, if this starts to capture, let's call
2345.04s:  it 3850. Let's add a thing here. Let's add 38.5. It's a $6,000 gain.
2355.68s:  I mean, in terms of a return on risk, I don't hate that play. Now, the reality is there's not
2368.00s:  an insignificant probability that Tsl, it literally could go bankrupt. Now it would require a pretty
2376.00s:  significant sustained down move for Tesla, even with it trading as low as $8.34. But that's still
2384.32s:  not outside the entire realm of possibility. That could happen. But with respect to a return on
2391.76s:  risk profile, you're taking a pretty low risk for a chance to double plus your money. Now, it becomes
2399.52s:  more dangerous, especially for small portfolios that see this kind of thing and then they just get
2407.28s:  jacked to the tits and try to run this all the way through. That's real dangerous,
2413.68s:  putting a massive percent of your portfolio in something like this. Because again, this can go
2419.76s:  bankrupt, be clear. Let's take a look at the S-L-L holdings. We're going to look at how it creates
2426.88s:  the leverage. Let's see. It's interesting that it combines them both. I would like to see what
2444.56s:  they're holding. I don't want to fucking PDF, bro.
2454.40s:  No. No. No. I mean, I know it's going to be through derivatives. I just don't know what
2475.68s:  specific derivatives. I would like to know. No. Oh, here we go. Daily fund holdings. Yes,
2487.28s:  we. Here we go. Let's see. Grafist government cash. They're actually massively in cash right now.
2498.40s:  Now, more cash. So they have a ton of cash. And then see, look, this is the way that they're creating
2510.24s:  the leverage is they're using swaps. So, I mean, they have a ton of cash.
2524.16s:  An absolute ton of cash. It's kind of the cool part, by the way, of trading leverage things is
2533.52s:  because you don't have to use as much money to trade them. I've already made that point a million
2537.92s:  times and I've showed you examples of this stuff like T-Triple Cues and SSO. This is the
2544.24s:  this is the reality behind like using leverage is you can use leverage logically, but this isn't like
2553.20s:  the fucking Michael sailor intelligent leverage Ponzi scheme shit. This is actually like legitimate
2560.16s:  use of leverage. Paul says the cash is collateral presumably. I don't know. It doesn't really matter
2571.28s:  what it is, but I don't know like what percentage of it would be collateral because the thing is is
2576.40s:  that well, let's see. So for T.S., I'm asking in chat you P.T. We'll see if it can do some analysis for
2585.28s:  us. I need to use my research guy. So for TSL, the fund holds large amounts of cash and creates
2597.44s:  the leverage via swaps. What kind of collateral is commonly used for leveraged ETFs that are using
2613.28s:  swaps for LEP. Good that says. Many many leverage ETFs hold large cash positions in T-bills or
2626.56s:  repo provides stability and ensures meet daily margin requirements. So it looks like a little bit of
2634.80s:  everything. Money market repo collateralized. I don't know what the percentage is. Since the leverages
2642.88s:  synthetic via swaps, the fund doesn't need to fully invest in Tesla, which we know. The cash and T-bills
2648.80s:  serve as collateral. So let's see what the percentage typically is. What is the percentage of cash
2659.44s:  held typically as collateral? Yeah, so it looks like less than half would be for collateral. The
2673.76s:  funds often hold way more, like 50 to 80%, but not really for a collateral perspective, which is
2681.04s:  because they don't need as much. Roderick says, could a leap on Tesla make sense instead of TSL when
2690.64s:  DTE is greater than one year for taxes? They're just very different traits. So you would have to figure
2698.88s:  out what the ideas and what the consideration is. The reason being is because
2705.20s:  if you take a look at something like Tesla, which is just wildly, wildly volatile, even if you go
2712.00s:  super far out in time, let's say that you pick something that's 368 days. And let's say you get
2720.24s:  something that's a synthetic stock equivalent. So let's go to 85 delta's or something like that.
2726.32s:  The problem is is that you're going to put up, call it 10,700. And you're going to be chewing
2738.56s:  away $7 a day per contract in data decay. Even for an option that's as far out in time as this,
2747.68s:  and as deep in the money as this, there's nothing wrong with it. But you're paying a pretty penny
2755.36s:  for the leverage in something like this because of how volatile it is.
2761.04s:  So definitely could be done. There's nothing wrong with it. It's just a very different trade
2765.36s:  than something like TSL, at least in the way that I would run it. So yeah, definitely could do that
2771.92s:  though if you wanted. Scott says Tesla's a company is like that dude named Brock from high school.
2778.48s:  That's a complete tool and peaked at 17. I couldn't really disagree more. I think Tesla is at the
2787.60s:  cutting edge in terms of electric vehicle. If you think about it, Tesla is what caused all of the
2798.16s:  other automotive manufacturers to start taking this seriously, the electronic vehicle space.
2806.96s:  So I actually give Tesla a lot more respect than that personally.
2811.04s:  Roderick says 30% ETN to swap and balance safe, typically, I think that's way too little,
2817.84s:  especially in something volatile like this. I would imagine the collateral that
2824.72s:  something like TSL L would possess right now would probably be north of 50%, probably 50 to 60%
2830.96s:  in terms of total collateralization of the cash. And I think in normal settings,
2835.92s:  based on what I read from GPT, which would align with my intuition would be something between like
2841.44s:  40 and 50%. But the reality is, is most leveraged funds do hold tons of cash. And again,
2851.52s:  it's because they don't have to hold because they're using swaps. So if we take a look at
2857.20s:  T-Triple Q holding just for another example from another provider, right? So this is from
2861.52s:  ProShare's versus Direction. And let's take a look at what they have.
2875.44s:  Here.
2875.68s:  So we can see that it's primarily done via swaps. And then they do hold the underlying.
2891.68s:  And then their cash position, right? So they're sitting on massive, massive, massive piles of cash.
2899.52s:  So yeah. So we'll see. But I do, I do like the TSLL idea. It's, that would be like a massively
2915.12s:  highly speculative trade for me. That would be size very small. And it would be something that I
2921.92s:  would probably just trade the coverage wrangling because the volume here is just psychotic. Look at
2926.96s:  this. For something that's $7, you can collect 10% essentially to cash secure that. Like that's
2935.28s:  an insane return. So, but there is a absolute reality where TSLL could easily get cut in half.
2944.64s:  And lower probability, but TSLL could conceivably go and solve it. Like that is not outside the
2951.28s:  realm of possibility for something like this. And it's really important when you're trading things
2954.72s:  like this, even if it's something that's a lower probability, like we still have to acknowledge that
2960.80s:  this is something that can happen because it most certainly can happen like without a doubt.
2966.64s:  I wouldn't expect to see it personally because well, we could do the math. We can see like how
2972.00s:  many consecutive down days that we would need to have. But it would probably be enough that I would
2979.20s:  wager its fairly low probability, but not a zero probability, which is different.
2989.84s:  Cool. Anything else you guys want to hit? If not, I'm going to keep the stream on just because I'm
2995.44s:  going to look through the markets a little bit, but I'm not really going to be as
3001.36s:  talk to the camera necessarily, but you guys are free to hang out if you'd like.
3005.92s:  What I'm doing now is just poking through my portfolio really fast.
3012.80s:  I'm generally good with the exposure, but I need to pack a couple things.
3019.76s:  So what I'm looking at now is the iBit allocation, which might need to change.
3026.16s:  James says, do you have time to go over IVE leading up to earnings? Yeah, definitely. Let's do that.
3031.52s:  That's way more fun. Wait, IVE.
3042.08s:  Did I miss read that?
3047.84s:  IVE.
3052.00s:  IV expansion.
3053.84s:  IVE.
3056.08s:  You mean like the broader effect, I see. So did you watch the video? I have on trading earnings with options.
3071.28s:  This video. If you haven't, you should watch that first. And then if you haven't, you still have
3077.84s:  questions, I'm more than happy. And then Paul says, no, you don't have to watch it again.
3083.60s:  If you have specific questions on it, then 100% ask me. But if you watched it, then I imagine you
3089.36s:  know the basics of IVE expansion leading into earnings. So it leads me to then assume that you
3094.64s:  have more specific questions than the broad effect. So I just want to answer the meaningful stuff
3102.24s:  for you. And then Paul says, how do you choose between various types of limit order? Does it matter
3106.64s:  much? It matters a ton. It matters a whole lot. I don't know if I still have that. Let me see. Order
3113.28s:  type. I thought I had like a video that talked about order types. Yeah, it's probably because it's
3119.92s:  not that effective. Anyways, so for order types, the way to think about it, at least for me, is
3130.48s:  generally speaking on entry, I'm going to prefer some sort of limit order. Right? So if I'm looking
3135.92s:  at TSL and let's say that I wanted to trade the options in here. So I would come into cell.
3146.80s:  And then I would, if I want to play the bid-ass spread, then I would run a limit order. Right? Because
3154.00s:  I want to attempt to get filled at the price I'm denoting or better. And I can typically do this
3158.48s:  when I'm trying to enter trades because I have the luxury of time. It's not really a rush.
3162.72s:  When I'm looking to exit trades, I typically will try to use an exit order if I'm manually
3167.28s:  inputting them. Again, just to get a better capture on the bid-ass spread. But if I'm setting things
3175.20s:  like stops, it's going to be a stop market unless it's a profit. And then if it's a profit,
3181.28s:  it's typically an OCO where I will have a stop limit than a stop market. So it'll still include
3189.20s:  stop market. And the reason is because specifically for stops, one of the big mistakes traders do
3195.60s:  is they try to get really cheap. They say like, oh, I want to get stopped out, but I want to get
3200.96s:  you know, X number of dollars. And the problem with that is that you can then thus not get stopped out,
3208.40s:  which right is straight trash. So I'll show you what that can look like. If we go into TSL,
3216.88s:  this is, let me find here, perfect example. Let's say here, you were like, I think it's going to go
3227.52s:  up from here. That's the trade idea. But I want to make sure that if I'm wrong, I'm not wrong a
3232.96s:  whole lot. I'm going to use the low of a day. And let's just, I can't really tell what it is. Let's
3238.00s:  call it like 2730. So 2730 was the low of the day. And I'm going to set a stop limit
3252.88s:  at 2730. So normally what would happen is you would set the stop, the trigger would be at like 27
3260.72s:  35. So it means once price hits 2735, I want to try to route this order. And the order that would
3270.56s:  actually be routed would be by to close, whatever it is at 2730. Well, here's the problem. If it
3281.36s:  opens down here at 25, this can't get filled. So the spot that you wanted to get out at because
3294.72s:  you were trying to be cheap, because you didn't want the scenario where, you know, you don't want to
3302.96s:  get a bad fill. Well, because you didn't want to get a bad fill, you're now going to get out at $2.30
3310.24s:  cheaper. So you're not filled, but you're still in something you wanted to be out at a terrible
3317.68s:  price now. So that's the big thing that's like where it really does matter in my opinion is when
3323.44s:  it comes to stops, because everybody will tell you that if you use like a stop market or just a
3328.88s:  market order in general, you're, they kind of suck because you're going to get a bad fill. But again,
3335.12s:  it's always keeping first things first, right? Like what is the purpose of this stop? The purpose of
3341.44s:  the stop isn't necessarily to, you know, get the best possible price you humanly can. It's to get
3347.92s:  the fuck out of the trade when things are not going the way that they should be. So then if you
3353.04s:  reorder those and you say, well, I'm going to care more about getting a better fill than getting
3356.88s:  out of the trade, then you might not get out of the trade. So it's just getting confused and
3360.32s:  focusing on the wrong, on the wrong function. Alberto says, man, Eric does have a video for
3367.60s:  everything. I do have a video for a lot of stuff. And it's one of the reasons why the channel
3373.52s:  funny enough typically performs really poorly in terms of like when I launch a video and how many
3378.80s:  views that they'll get. And part of it is because I know the content that I cover and I know that
3386.80s:  people will have questions about it. So I always title the videos, how I would think about the
3393.04s:  topic so that I could quickly search for them so that I could show them to people, which is
3398.80s:  absolutely hilarious. But I was thinking about it that actually goes back to the, you know,
3405.84s:  to the grassroots element of the channel and the original point of why I made this whole thing.
3411.84s:  But it's so funny because like you're supposed to play a lot of games with titles, right? To like
3416.48s:  get people intrigued and to, you know, make them fearful and make them want to click something to
3421.68s:  help figure out the fear. And I'm literally just out here labeling shit something that I know I'll
3427.28s:  remember to, you know, type in the search bar so that I can find it for you guys is pretty comical.
3433.36s:  All right. That wraps me up. If you need anything, hit me up in the discord. You know, I'll
3437.44s:  learn. See you later.
