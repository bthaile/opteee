0.00s: What's up outliers zero DTEs have absolutely exploded in popularity and people found a lot
8.04s: of success in it early on.
9.92s: And then they started seeing some issues.
12.08s: The goal of this video is to do two things.
14.44s: It's to show you some very important zero DTE trends from their daily launch of options
21.36s: in SPX specifically back in 2022, round May.
25.68s: And the second thing I want to show you is comparing zero DTE options against one DTE
32.56s: option.
33.56s: And you might as well, doesn't that defeat the purpose of zero DTE options where you're
37.36s: in and out in a day.
38.60s: And that's definitely the case.
40.76s: But there is an overnight volatility effect.
44.20s: And then at the end of the video, I'm actually going to show you an even more interesting
49.20s: strategy.
50.20s: So we'll see when we get there.
52.28s: So first, let's start with a quick recap of just the option space.
58.20s: Now I've shown you different variations of this.
61.08s: She previously I'll throw a couple links to other videos that really outline this way
66.84s: more in detail because I want to use it as a launch point for what we're going to talk
70.64s: about today.
71.64s: There's just not enough time in the video.
73.16s: And what I specifically want to walk you through is a quick reminder of what you're looking
76.92s: at.
77.92s: This again is showing us effectively from May 16th of 22 into March of 2025.
90.16s: That's the recent snapshot that I grabbed.
93.16s: And I specifically want to direct you to again, what the delta's.
98.80s: So these represent the delta for the short legs and then the long legs if there are long
104.80s: legs and then the entry time, the lot size, the days to expiration.
109.84s: We're not applying any profit or loss management to this.
113.20s: We're just letting them go into expiration and then we'll review the performance.
116.48s: Now one thing to note why 1500 Pacific time.
120.04s: Well, I'm sorry, 1500 Eastern time, which represents 1200 Pacific time.
125.48s: It's because this time frame in again, from the other videos held up better and more robust.
132.04s: It wasn't optimized 1400 actually works a little bit better, but the variance of year
137.80s: over year, month over month is less with this.
139.80s: So this is why and why 1015 20 30 50.
144.28s: These are popular single option.
146.80s: Why not five delta because we know those don't perform well from the prior videos.
151.24s: Why on these are we doing five delta's for all of them?
156.12s: This essentially to create a synthetic short option spread by capping the risk though.
165.76s: So we're really trying to keep these as wide as possible.
168.80s: Five delta effectively balances liquidity needs with the actual purpose of the trade.
175.96s: And then for the iron fly, we're using 50 delta and then 15 delta wings.
184.20s: And the reason for this is to actually have it offset enough of the risk.
188.60s: If you go super wide, then you're effectively just mirroring this.
193.08s: Now you'll notice that this is the entire time frame.
196.28s: Then this is segmented by 23 and then 24 and then down here, you'll notice we switch
202.56s: to a one DTE.
204.16s: So the context of the one DTE is essentially we would enter this towards the end of let's
209.88s: say Monday.
211.24s: And then we would leave this on overnight into Tuesday and then it would expire on Tuesday
217.36s: after the close.
218.56s: So let's first take a quick look at the total performance for the entire time frame.
223.96s: And you'll notice a couple things.
225.16s: This is all standard fare for what you've seen previously, which is the naked strategies
230.48s: drastically outperform the strategies that include wings.
234.68s: And again, this is pretty logical because these positions benefit from having capped risk.
240.80s: So they're not truly going to underperform.
243.44s: Now the benefit here is you can see their compound annual growth rate does lag pretty significantly.
249.92s: However, their max drawdown also outperforms significantly.
255.44s: So it's always a function of choose your own adventure.
259.92s: So I have used all different versions, both in paper trading and then also in live trading.
265.88s: The data set that you see here is a hybrid of data that I've purchased from SIBO.
271.56s: And that's what I used to query against.
274.00s: So next up, let's take a look at 22 and 20, I'm sorry, 23 and 24.
281.12s: And you'll notice a couple of things between these two different years.
284.48s: 23 showed positive performance across the board again with the benefit going to naked
291.52s: options.
292.92s: And then 24 actually starts lagging.
297.04s: And we're seeing negative numbers emerge.
299.52s: And this is representation for the entire year.
302.80s: So what's going on here?
304.28s: Well, if we take a look really quick at what volatility did in 23 and 24, you can see
311.08s: in 2023, volatility was in a broad downtrend.
316.80s: And then in 2024, you can actually see volatility started expanding quite a lot actually into
323.24s: the first half of the year with this trend.
325.84s: Then it spiked down and then it shot back up.
329.48s: So this movement that you see in 24 is really challenging for the strategy to work, which
336.88s: is really, this is an important note because if you're going to attempt to try and trade
341.36s: this kind of strategy from just a always do it perspective, you're going to underperform.
346.32s: There are periods where this works better than other periods.
348.84s: And this is one of the key trends that identify for you where if we're going through a regime
353.96s: where volatility is generally declining, these strategies perform well.
359.64s: And then if we're going through a period where that volatility is starting to expand the
364.24s: strategies struggle.
366.20s: And this is a really important function of using VIX and different VIX indicators to help
373.32s: us identify this trend.
374.76s: And I'll give you a few examples of those right now.
377.88s: So if we use something like the VIX one day, which is relatively new, you can see that
384.40s: obviously it's going to be just all over the map.
387.60s: But you can monitor the trend of the VIX one day compared to something like other term
394.88s: VIX provisions, which obviously standard VIX gives us one month.
399.32s: And then you can do something like VIX three month.
402.36s: And you can monitor the trend of VIX three month by keeping an eyeball on these different
408.36s: periods.
409.36s: You can start to detect when volatility is going through a transitory phase like we saw
415.92s: again through 2024 or it was steadily climbing, which is where these strategies start to hurt.
421.84s: And it's exactly why you saw a 2024 underperform.
424.92s: So now let's take a look at how these compare against one DTE and one DTE did.
432.32s: Very poorly across the board except for one region.
437.44s: And that was in 2024 in 2024 overnight volatility actually outperformed one day, vol for
448.04s: the naked strategies.
449.80s: And it's also worth noting that the spread strategies still underperform across the board.
456.72s: But this is the one period where it actually stuck out to me is pretty interesting.
461.40s: So what that means is overnight vol starts to look a little bit more attractive when the
466.16s: market is going through these expansion phases of steady growth.
470.68s: The other thing to take away from this is overnight vol in general is not priced well, especially
478.44s: from 2023.
479.84s: And then when you look across the entire sample, meaning not priced well to be advantage
483.68s: to sellers, this is fascinating to me because there is another period of time that is
490.60s: wildly profitable compared to all of these.
494.60s: That's actually why you see these colors kind of like this muted green because there's
498.44s: actually a third item in here that I would like to show you in another video if you're
504.32s: interested.
505.32s: It's a strategy that grossly outperforms all of these across the board.
509.68s: And it's something that I've been trading for a long time.
511.80s: So if you're interested in seeing that, let me know.
513.64s: We can do a follow up video.
515.32s: If you have any questions, let me know.
516.72s: Be an outlier.
517.72s: I'll see you all later.
