21.08s: that he's closing if not exited the
23.40s: entire chewy position and then the other

31.00s: what's happened today in the options
32.40s: Market I can show you that there is
35.16s: 1.12 million dollars that went into the
39.88s: 13 sep 22 and a half
42.68s: calls who knows who it is I don't but I
47.56s: do know some people that tend to move in

52.44s: and then if you take one look below that
55.64s: at uh 842 we see another 61900

85.88s: a catalyst the stock starts to move and
88.52s: right now it looks like the catalyst is

108.12s: gets out moves around people are going
110.12s: to be looking at GameStop pretty pretty
111.88s: hard because for a while people are
113.28s: starting to get a little disenfranchised
114.92s: thinking that you know maybe dfv moved
116.84s: on but I think most of the community was
119.12s: pretty resol
120.76s: that he was doing his thing probably
122.68s: going to come back I think that's what
124.20s: the vast majority of people probably
