0.64s: what's up everyone quick update on
2.96s: GameStop simply because we're at the end
5.08s: of the week we have earnings coming up
7.36s: and some interesting Behavior today so
10.04s: the last time we spoke we were talking
11.76s: about how I was really digging that it
14.72s: looks like it's consolidating up kind of
16.92s: in this mid to high 20 handle which is
19.40s: fantastic and what I found of interest
22.88s: is I'm keeping a really close eye on the
25.44s: volume and what I want to detect is how
29.28s: price behav as volume is moving around
32.48s: and one of the things I noticed even on
34.76s: today is that it had a very very low low
39.76s: um open close range right it opened at
41.48s: 2788 closed at 2742 so like a140 range
46.32s: really really small range but look at
48.76s: the volume it contracted quite a lot
51.20s: we've gone from a 5-day average volume
54.20s: of 112 mil 20-day average volume of
57.04s: about 12 mil down to 8 mil so volume is
60.68s: Contracting and what I like about this
64.04s: is that even though volume is
65.24s: Contracting it's still hanging up in the
68.52s: 20s now I know a lot of people were
70.44s: hopeful that we would crack above 30 it
72.04s: looked like it was genuinely a potential
74.48s: but it definitely seems like things slow
76.40s: down a little bit and today was a little
79.08s: bit of a lighter expiration we obviously
81.64s: had decent exposure here in 22 no but it
84.08s: wasn't crazy right so it was 93,000
86.60s: options against
88.60s: 15,879 we can see that the bulk of those
91.52s: options were at the 30 if I'm not
94.12s: mistaken let's see if this will pop up
97.12s: yeah so 30 on the call side there was uh
100.96s: 22,600 there so those you know didn't
105.20s: stand too much of a chance of uh of
107.68s: falling in the money we can see that the
109.92s: 28s we were just shy of that there was
113.16s: 7,000 there and then at the 27s I mean
116.48s: there was a ton that came in the money
118.32s: but yeah the 30s were pretty pretty
120.16s: heavy and the thing I found interesting
122.12s: is that these were people really bidding
123.56s: into the 30s because there was options
126.72s: added um over yesterday into today so
130.00s: there was a little bit of an expectation
131.40s: of a movement but it just didn't
132.80s: materialize it looks like so a couple
135.32s: other things that I want to discuss here
138.52s: is when I look at the overall movement
140.88s: lately in GameStop I can kind of tell
144.68s: that the overall disposition of Traders
147.80s: is moving because we generally will have
151.12s: really really heavy oi in the front
153.92s: expiration here it's 136k against 34
157.12s: this is oi before we were looking at
159.04s: volume and then if we go to the 29th
161.76s: that's 92 and 22 the 6th is 33 and 8 20D
165.96s: is 52 and
167.96s: 25k the 17th of Jan 25 look at that 291k
172.96s: against 114 so we're actually playing
176.36s: this a little bit longer term I want to
177.80s: reiterate that point and it hasn't
179.32s: changed
180.48s: it's still very much centralized in
182.60s: these near term expirations we can see
185.36s: that for today there were quite a few
188.04s: calls that were sold which makes sense
189.76s: expiration Friday a lot of the volume
192.60s: that we looked at for today in this
194.72s: front expiration would be trades that
197.40s: are being moved out in time so like
201.56s: again like these 30s here the the 23,000
204.84s: of those that rolled through today those
206.80s: are people that are closing out cuz the
208.40s: total oi was 24,00
210.56s: right so a lot of those people were
212.92s: closing positions some of them obviously
215.08s: opening some stuff but most of them were
216.64s: closing and moving out probably it well
220.36s: let's take a look let's see what the
221.68s: volume looks like for next week if they
224.04s: were just moving out a week yeah so
227.04s: 70,000 so that's a pretty significant
230.04s: change where if we look at the open
232.48s: interest is 92,000 for 29 noes so my
235.88s: guess is people are going to start
237.20s: getting ready to play some earnings here
238.80s: earnings is scheduled for for December
242.00s: so we'll probably continue to see people
244.40s: running the front month as they tend to
247.24s: and then as we get closer to earnings
249.60s: we'll see how active things get the
252.24s: market right now is pricing pretty
255.04s: significant Vol but not crazy right so
257.92s: 125% 136% for 6 and 13 D which is closer
263.12s: obviously to the earnings release itself
265.48s: and if we take a Peak at its prior
268.28s: earnings we can see a couple behaviors
271.92s: so if we look specifically at Q3 it
275.44s: tends to kind of float sideways right we
277.76s: can see that sideways activity here and
279.96s: we can see it look essentially the same
281.64s: back here so if we're looking at kind of
284.32s: quarterly seasonality for earnings it
287.00s: looks like Q3 tends to be a little bit
289.08s: more quiet but we can also see that on
291.96s: the gaps it's had two Gap downs and this
295.40s: one was about a 10% gap down this one
298.88s: was about the same and then this one was
302.76s: 26 down to 21 so a little bit more but
306.40s: not excessively more so overall it looks
310.44s: like the earnings have been tightening
312.68s: up a little bit uh Q2 was softer than I
316.00s: actually expected because they came in
318.76s: at a penny and they were expected at um
322.48s: negative a penny so I thought that there
325.16s: was going to be a little bit more of a
326.88s: positive continuation through there from
329.00s: a volatility perspective definitely very
331.36s: very volatile through earnings we can
333.68s: see it tends to have risk premiums but
336.28s: they're not really uh too reliable just
338.92s: because of how emphatically GameStop can
342.56s: move so let's take a quick look at the
345.00s: trades for the week and see what sticks
347.92s: out to us cuz again there is a couple
350.40s: things that I think are worth talking
352.36s: about first let's grab GameStop here and
356.92s: I want to look at specifically for the
358.80s: week
360.28s: so overall we can see call premiums they
364.80s: really jacked up on the 20th into the
369.60s: 21st and then they've really slowed down
373.20s: since and put premiums have been about
377.60s: steady so now let's take a quick look at
381.36s: any interesting options trades for this
384.12s: week so we'll look at the last seven
386.20s: days and active but not not excessively
391.28s: so so a lot of the bigger trades are
394.40s: actually sales and we can still see that
397.72s: most of the trades that are coming
399.12s: through are out in
402.16s: 2025 so this is again a little bit of
405.60s: that longer term positioning I would
407.20s: expect the options to get pretty active
410.04s: as we get closer into earnings it's just
412.32s: a little too early now for people that
414.04s: want to trade earnings specifically to
416.32s: to start putting positions on here so I
419.04s: also will take a quick look at the um
423.32s: dark poool and see if there's anything
425.48s: interesting from this week let's grab
428.28s: the last seven days and then let's sort
430.92s: these by premium so we get to see the
433.40s: bigger
434.48s: trades and this looks actually a little
438.32s: quieter than usual so there's typically
441.68s: over the course of a week I normally see
444.88s: a little bit more of mil plus size
448.60s: trades but I mean they're still here
450.92s: obviously and it looks like they're
455.32s: really spread across so the other thing
457.36s: I'm looking for here is in terms of the
459.20s: the dates that they occurred were there
461.28s: any centralization of the dates anything
463.84s: that sticks out in terms of uh like
465.80s: persistent hits or anything like that
468.00s: and I don't really see that so let's
470.60s: take a quick last look now through a
472.80s: little bit of
473.88s: news so here we'll grab this little tool
477.64s: down here
479.76s: and then I just want to flip through
481.28s: some of the recent news and see from a
483.64s: highlevel
485.32s: perspective um yeah so the as you guys
488.20s: know gendler is stepping down they're
489.60s: going to resign on Inauguration the 20th
491.80s: of January so that's uh you know awesome
494.96s: no love loss there and it looks like
499.40s: they're kind of linking just busy stocks
501.84s: right so micro strategy and stuff's in
503.52s: here on the 19th there was a bit of a
506.48s: highlight on some heavy call activity
510.00s: but nothing that I saw too specific and
513.96s: then on the 18th there was a little bit
516.08s: of news it says collection Holdings Nat
518.32s: Turner joined the board of video game
519.96s: retail and original meme stock GameStop
522.32s: I think everybody's you know Lighty
523.56s: years aware of this because I also think
525.12s: that he did it for no compensation right
527.40s: it says appointed to the board
529.00s: tightening video game retailer link to
531.28s: authentication management against uh
534.16s: management specialist collector's
536.32s: Holdings um and I'm if I'm not mistaken
539.64s: let me double check that really quick
542.24s: yeah so grabbing this here it looks like
546.00s: uh it looks like he's not which is great
549.44s: so now they have six board
551.84s: members
552.84s: [Music]
555.64s: um
557.40s: interesting I wonder how far they're
559.48s: going to go down this collectible path
561.16s: yeah because this is obviously happening
563.16s: where GameStop is moving beyond video
564.92s: games we knew that was going to happen
566.08s: they're sitting on a lot of money to do
567.52s: this I still think that there's a bigger
571.36s: play underneath the surface here I I
573.68s: don't know exactly where it is or when
575.24s: they're talking about it but like this
577.52s: feels like a safe close to home style
579.96s: move with grading and I wonder yeah I'm
584.12s: really eager for this next earnings to
585.76s: see if we hear anything that you know
588.24s: indicates what direction they might be
589.76s: taking stuff but yeah overall GameStop
593.20s: is most importantly impressing me with
596.80s: its ability to hang out in the high 20s
598.88s: I want to see that continue if there's
600.96s: anything that you think I should take a
602.20s: look at let me know in the comments be
603.80s: an outlier I'll see you later
