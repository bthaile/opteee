0.00s: What's up everybody Eric here I am super stoked I got Tom saws
4.16s: off from tasty trade. He's the guy that actually built or led the
9.80s: development of this software that's in the background here that I still use
13.32s: now which is think or swim. So first off Tom thank you so much for taking
17.56s: some time to come hang out and talk trading with us. We really appreciate your time.
21.80s: Sure. Looking forward to it. Yeah so like I was telling you right before we started
27.08s: trading options really young I was super fortunate to come across it and it was
33.04s: really like 2008 not a lot of great resources out there and then I came across
37.52s: you guys when I was in college and I reached out to you a few times to chat with
43.20s: you and something that always stuck out to me about your approach to trading
48.28s: and investing is you made it feel possible you made it feel approachable to me
52.76s: you would talk about very advanced concepts but you made it so that it felt like
57.52s: somebody like me who didn't really know anything that I could potentially dip
62.00s: my toe in. How did you develop that ability to translate really complex topics
68.28s: but make it approachable to such a large number of people it's a personal
72.64s: question but I'm very curious the answer. Well it's funny you put it that way
76.52s: because a lot of times I like to describe my own journey in this business and a
81.72s: lot of the like the crazy success that we've had at different points about you
87.96s: know and tie it back into our ability to make what we say is complex topics
93.08s: simple in fact I I just went on the road and did a couple of college PhD and
101.36s: undergrad lectures and the topic of the lecture was specifically for PhD
108.44s: students which were not necessarily finance PhD students was making complex
112.72s: topics simple and how to how to monetize that and turn it into you know some kind
117.72s: of business because because a lot of smart really smart people have a really
122.72s: difficult time you know and again it's not it's not about dumbing things down
128.56s: it's it's really about you know being able to tell a story yeah one of the
137.64s: keys to to to building a successful business is is being able to articulate
146.20s: what you're doing and being able to make it relatable to everybody so that
150.60s: you're not talking in some kind of language that nobody really understands
153.92s: you know we make a general assumption upfront hey everybody's smart but make it
159.00s: something that you know hey it's fun it's approachable it's it's easy to
162.80s: understand you know you can you can you can tie everything together it's logical
167.60s: that kind of stuff but it seems like you have found a really interesting balance
173.16s: between highlighting the stuff that really matters and not wasting as much time
178.00s: on those other more esoteric concepts I'm really wondering how did you start
184.28s: trying to teach people about options like how that doesn't seem like a huge
188.88s: potential marketplace so why options why not just stock trading why not
193.16s: something else well two things first thing is you're a little young to
199.52s: remember Arthur Ash but he's a great tennis player and I I saw him do an interview
205.12s: once and I'll never forget he he he said during the interview you know that
208.52s: somebody said to him because you know how do you you know you went five sets and
213.60s: you look so fresh at the end of five sets and you know you you kind of you
217.64s: kind of had more energy at the end than your opponent and he goes hey I don't
222.84s: go up to the balls I can't get and you know what that that always kind of stuck
228.68s: with me because in business I I kind of feel like I don't go after the balls I
234.32s: can't get you know you know I'm saying I'm right I kind of handled things that
240.84s: I I can that I know I can do so I think that's a that's a big part of it I got
246.12s: into options originally because when when I got out of college we were in the
255.88s: middle of a recession it was 1979 and it was pretty hard to get a job and I
264.80s: was a political science major and my the best interview I had was with a
272.40s: financial firm and they offered me a job somehow which back then was like
276.72s: almost unheard of on your first interview because it's hard to get you know
281.00s: good jobs and this was a job on Wall Street and I was living in New York
284.16s: and I was like done I'll take it you know and I think I would stay there for 40
289.24s: some odd years you know I mean in the industry but I I learned options because
294.80s: I hung around when I first got this job with a bunch of young options
298.76s: they were like everybody liked options and I didn't know anything about them was
302.04s: the first time I've ever seen them and I learned them pretty quick and you know I
307.32s: just decided that if I was gonna really do something in this space I had to
312.36s: quit the job that I wanted so bad and and go to Chicago where where I'd never
319.16s: been before and you know go to the exchange where the action was which leads to
325.00s: two questions you just answered one of them which is why have you stayed in Chicago
328.68s: because I've been there twice and I'm from New York originally I went to school in
333.32s: Rochester but I always felt like the the winner in and I went there to Chicago during the winner
339.40s: and I felt like your guys this winner just straight up disrespected me in my jacket
343.80s: because I was used to the cold but that was a different kind of cold.
348.36s: The I felt yeah
356.20s: was weird like I never see those you remember those New Yorker cartoons where like
363.08s: we're pretty much if you grew up in New York the end of the world was like at the end of the
366.60s: East River you know like once you crossed over you know George Washington Bridge or the Tapensee
371.48s: you know it was it was pretty much you know where the Tri-Berald you know that was the end
377.08s: that's where the United States stopped right so I always I never I really had never been west of
383.40s: anything like I you know I grew up on East Coast if if I went on vacation I went north and
388.20s: you know it's a ski in the East Coast or went to Cape you know I never went anywhere but
392.92s: where you could drive on the East Coast so I'd never been west and when the opportunity came up
398.44s: to go to Chicago you know I just fell in love with the city I to this day I think it's one of the
405.40s: best cities of the world I think it's the best city in America you know like it's it's crazy beautiful
409.72s: city and with amazing architecture with everything you have in like New York but but you can drive
417.08s: it's livable like the house in the city you know it's like I just fall in love with this city it's safe
422.68s: it's just you know it gets a bad rap sometimes because of the weather and because of some of the crime
426.92s: you know but I don't think you know I get used to it right yeah it's not necessarily representative
433.00s: of the whole place that I've been here now two-thirds of my life so you know it's it's just and
437.88s: this is where you know back when I started this was the last Chicago was the last frontier of
444.68s: of what I would call like kind of true capitalism in the sense that you know where else could you go
449.64s: with you know 20 or 25 grand and you know at least a seat and and hopefully you know make it in
454.68s: this business I mean there wasn't we didn't have entrepreneurship then and it wasn't like you know
460.36s: there was no there was no word like that and so we would you know this was to me the last frontier
466.52s: of real free market capitalism and I just happened to get lucky I stuck around.
472.76s: How did you develop this relationship with risk like you just said you know taking 25 G's
477.00s: going to Chicago and just let's see how it goes that seems insane to me but like you're
482.60s: obviously comfortable with risk how did that relationship build how did you create that you know
489.16s: it's it I know it's going to sound a little crazy but I mean I've obviously developed it
496.12s: over the years even a different appetite for risks and things like that but the reality is that
502.20s: I think some people are maybe it's maybe it's just part of their
507.24s: their DNA almost you know like like I was definitely somebody that was open to
514.36s: um I was open to unlimited risk I I marked over time to be a little bit more measured about
520.44s: risk I'm a risk freak and now I know there's not like there's a difference between like somebody
526.84s: that jumps out of an airplane without a parachute you know and and that kind of risk and the kind
533.24s: of risks that I'm talking about but I'm willing to roll the dice constantly like like you know I
540.92s: roll the dice when I was 20 I roll the dice when I'm 40 50 you know when we built Thinkerson we
545.80s: rolled the dice everything we had when we built Tasty we rolled the dice with everything we had
550.20s: you know I mean I don't I don't hold back and every opportunity to take risk and this is one
558.44s: of things I think that you know one of the things that your generation is you're right your generation
562.92s: has been relatively risk averse when both my kids are wrapped around your age 130 133 so I'm kind
569.88s: of in you know I'm familiar with and I work with both of them so I'm familiar with your your
573.88s: wheelhouse and I think that generation needed you know needed to needs to learn risk better um and
581.48s: it's challenging for them and um it's challenging for a lot of people but to me learning how to
589.64s: A appreciate risk B how to assess risk and C how to deal with risk when it is when it works and when
599.16s: it fails are the keys to long-term wealth creation and success do you think that there's something to
606.92s: be said about you know traders being able to mentally partition um the capital that they're
612.28s: trading with or how do you view that relationship with trading capital um I am able
619.16s: to partition it a bit but I'm in a situation where obviously I have the the
626.28s: ability to do that because I have the means to do that um but I started in this business where um so
632.20s: so I from the day I got to Chicago when I was 23 years old 24 years old till now so 40 years later um
642.60s: um I essentially have been eating what I kill like I've only had two jobs in my life that I've
652.04s: got a paycheck went both of them were when we were bought out so for the first 20 some odd years
659.32s: of my career you know I mean I worked for myself I was an independent market maker and um I
666.68s: had to learn how to you know of the capital we had when I say we I mean the capital I made you
675.40s: know I had to learn how to um you know protect the franchise so to speak and as I made money I had
682.04s: to put a little bit away because you know I wanted to do things like you know build a house have a
686.60s: family you know that kind of thing and on the other hand I needed capital to grow my business
692.52s: because as a market maker as a trader you know um those with more capital can do more things
698.52s: and I had to really learn how to do both those and then throughout the years you know when we made
703.56s: investments and you know like like in a story I'd love to tell is you know uh 20 years almost 20 years
710.68s: after I started so it was 1999 so it's 18 or 19 years um when we built thinkorsome
717.80s: Scott Sheridan and I who we did the you know we did we were partners um and we found a
723.16s: thingerson together we took all the money we had made over the past 19 years and didn't even tell
730.84s: our wives or anybody and we basically took every dime we made and built thinkorsome you know
739.32s: me millions of dollars but it was like it was all the money we had and we rolled every penny of it
744.76s: into thinkorsome so we didn't we didn't hold back one like we didn't we raised some capital
752.04s: after that but initially you know we we we put up a hundred percent of the capital ourselves and
756.84s: built the whole thing you know with our own money and then we raised capital and you know we at first
762.92s: it was hard to raise capital in the middle of a meltdown in 2000 you know when when the markets
767.88s: were crashing um but then when we turned around and we built tasty we did the exact same thing we
774.20s: this time we didn't roll you know we didn't take all our money but you know we we funded the
778.52s: whole thing and rolled the dice and blah blah blah and um I think it's really important to in life
786.52s: that every time you have an opportunity to take risks you should take it and those those
791.72s: that those people that tell other people hey you know what you shouldn't do that it's too risky
797.08s: or you shouldn't do that it's you know it's not smarter anything like that you know I don't I don't
802.44s: believe in that at all I mean obviously there's some things like you know you shouldn't go out and
806.36s: spend a million dollars on lottery tickets because that's stupid but if you have the ability to assess
811.80s: risk and bet on yourself and your confidence and you know um you have to do it I just don't I don't
818.76s: even like the alternative if there's no alternative for me I'm a hundred percent all in and that's
824.28s: even to this day like my wife will still say to me that she's just you know she'll be like what the
829.72s: fuck is wrong with you like why are you still doing this like why are you you know like you know
835.24s: why are you risking a million dollars in this or you know or too many like what are you thinking
839.72s: like what are you doing and I'm like what do you mean you know like you know this is this is who I am
844.92s: like don't you know she's like whatever you know she's like why are you still doing this I'm like
849.72s: that's that's what I do it's well it's really interesting and as you can tell my dog Thor is also
855.32s: very interested in your take on risk he's he's wearing a tuxedo um but I uh
863.96s: one of the one of the things that really drew me to what you talk about is I would watch some of
869.80s: your guys' live streams and you would have trades that weren't going in your favor and you never
875.24s: got wound up about it it was never a huge deal it was always like very emotionally regulated
880.68s: and that appealed to me because in the in the military in the Marine Corps specifically we teach a lot
885.96s: of that because the last thing you want is if shit is hitting the fan for the person who's supposed
890.60s: to be leading everybody to be losing their shit it's not a great example nothing good happens.
894.52s: Of course yeah so how for retail traders that are notoriously emotionally tied to their trades
904.84s: obviously you're wired differently they're also wired differently how do you think they could
910.44s: potentially think about those trades that are not going well to mentally keep them kind of
916.60s: regulated so that they're not going through this emotional roller coaster as a trades up they're
921.24s: elated as the trades down they're depressed. Well one of the things that we do I think really
928.20s: well here at Tasty is we hammer home the concept of there is no real defense mechanism in trading
937.48s: other than keeping your size you know in check and so one of the things that I think we've done
944.28s: probably better than anybody in the world is can is really convinced people that if you trade small
950.68s: there's a lot less that you have to worry about like when things when things go bad so we are
957.64s: we're proactive in the sense of getting people to trade reasonable trade size which I think
963.64s: protects them against kind of that really ugly you know that ugly sound now that doesn't mean
969.80s: that there's not tons of ugly scenarios we get that that's traded but we also try to bring a very
978.44s: logical approach to you know the way we adjust positions the way we reduce size or roll out I mean
984.76s: like I feel like living in the option world it's much more strategic and there are it's got a lot
992.04s: more flexibility or optionality when things go wrong as opposed to a very black and white position
999.88s: like a stock position or a futures position you know I feel like option positions have a lot more
1004.44s: choices when things go wrong so that's one of things we like about it's just more strategic
1009.24s: got it I think that makes a lot of sense and I think one of the things you brought up was the idea of
1015.72s: you know position management and I actually I still remember there was a series that you did for
1021.48s: a while I want to say it was with your your daughter but it was like it's teaching her to trade
1027.56s: yeah where do I start with my daughter case I did it for like two years love that and that was
1034.20s: actually one of the things and I purposely wanted to bring that up to again like I believe in
1039.24s: giving people like props when I can and that was a really interesting series because again
1046.12s: I saw you take something like options trading which essentially the the pool is as deep as you
1051.24s: want it to be you can go really really deep into volatility jump models and so on and so forth
1056.36s: if you're so inclined but you kept the information very pertinent to what you need to trade
1064.20s: and you slowly getting further into detail I'm very curious if you were to teach that same
1071.00s: series again with your daughter or with somebody else how would the way you teach that change since
1078.12s: that was about a decade ago really what I'm hinting at here is starting to dip my toe into picking
1084.28s: your brain on the evolution of options markets from essentially a decade ago to now um well you know
1093.56s: over the last I mean I basically I'm basically a junkie an option junkie and I've been in this
1101.64s: business now like I said over four decades I've probably made more trades than anybody else alive
1107.32s: I mean good and bad both you know I probably have more losers than anybody ever and I probably
1112.04s: have more winners um and I've probably made more trades I mean to this day I still average almost
1117.00s: 100 trades a day and so yeah so I don't like you know I'm true junkie and I use my own technology you
1124.36s: know like it's I mean I use the same technology our customers use same rates everything so so I'm
1129.72s: very I'm one of the few CEOs in this business or one of the few you know like like um people that run
1139.08s: they build this stuff and run that actually you know uses all the same markets trades all the same
1143.48s: stuff you know all over the place so I basically practice what a breach um I would do things
1149.40s: differently today than I did with case because we've learned a lot over the last you know I mean
1154.28s: you know six or seven years and she's still you know she's archived compliance officer she's
1158.44s: she's amazing she works her butt off at the for this business but um and I'm glad she learned it
1164.68s: but um uh I feel like I've gotten better at um being able to you know explain mechanical
1176.36s: optimization when it comes to trading I feel like I've gotten better at kind of you know I'm
1183.08s: better at articulating some of the things that I might have stumbled on you know 10 years ago
1187.80s: you know just trying to just trying to kind of explain what we do I've never looked at myself
1194.60s: as as a great teacher because I don't really I don't like to teach that much but I've looked at
1199.64s: myself as a good storyteller and as a good kind of um somebody that that has not necessarily a good
1208.04s: field for the markets but somebody that's fully engaged in the markets I can talk about it I mean
1212.28s: I've basically watched every single tick in the S&P's for 42 years like I like nobody has sat here
1223.40s: which is something that I should probably be like insanely scarier you know because because
1230.68s: it shows that I don't have much else to my existence you know like you know I haven't taken
1236.44s: a vacation in three years you know I I can't afford to I just haven't you know I'm I'm I'm crazy
1242.52s: that way it's interesting and you know one of the things that you said there that I thought
1248.84s: I definitely want to mention though that one of the things you did I think a killer job when
1254.12s: you were teaching case was um she embodied a lot of the hesitation that a lot of us had and I
1263.24s: still remember there was a couple episodes you're just like just put the trade on just just click
1266.44s: the button just you just she's she's she's not so um we have a lot of similar characteristics but
1275.96s: one of the things that she did did not get for me was an appetite for risk and so and she's very
1283.16s: detailed and very like she wants to make sure she's doing the right thing you know I like I'm I'm
1288.52s: okay with making a mistake she is not right really gets her frustrated and so she was very frustrated
1295.88s: by that just make the trade you know like that that was the worst thing you can tell somebody that's
1300.84s: this is detailed like she's one of these people that reads the instructions to any you know like
1306.12s: I don't even look at instructions so I'm like I don't even stick in instructions I can figure this out
1310.68s: and and I might sit there for two hours you know and butcher it and she might do it in 15 minutes
1315.64s: after reading all the instructions because but she's an instruction reader and I'm not you know so
1320.12s: that's kind of the difference how do you view the aptitude and the skill development of a retail
1327.32s: trader over a decade ago specifically on what skills do you think that they just are knocking
1333.88s: out of the park now compared to what you were seeing a while ago well the the difference is that
1342.60s: there is there is a um there's just you know and that again tastes is pretty unique in the sense that
1353.24s: we don't do things the way everybody else does things and we changed you know what we believe is
1358.20s: the importance we've changed content and the context of content so that we can
1365.32s: um give people a very different perspective like like you know when I first got in the retail
1370.60s: business when we built um costs you know 20-some years ago the first thing everybody wanted from us was
1376.92s: hey you know we we can't trade without this charting study or that charting study we can't
1381.24s: trade without this piece of you know information or news or whatever it is and I think that's
1387.08s: what's what's happened now is we don't get that at all now we get like crazy complex
1392.12s: questions you know about about implied volatility expected move you know duration you know rolling
1399.16s: like everything all of the
1411.56s: I think you might have muted I don't know if it's on Miria
1417.80s: yeah I can't hear you now can you hear me now yeah gotcha okay yeah it's weird sometimes my
1423.48s: system switches off um bagad so I I feel like I'm not sure where I left off but I what I was saying was
1431.80s: that that in the last 20 years the level the level of the change in content that we deliver
1445.16s: is went from subjective to quantitative and it has changed the way people look at strategic
1451.40s: finance we are now pure product indifferent you know 20 years ago people go I trade stocks
1459.32s: somebody else to go I trade futures somebody else to say I trade options you know now we are
1463.48s: completely product indifferent and we're strategically indifferent we don't care um I feel like
1470.20s: a lot of retail traders they learn options and then they start going down a very typical progression
1476.20s: of strategies if you were to think of a handful of strategies that you think retail traders should
1482.68s: prioritize like a new retail trader what kind of strategies do you think they should start looking at
1487.48s: well I don't think it's I don't think it's that easy I think it really depends on the the market
1495.24s: environment and you know like right now if you said hey what should people look at you know I think
1501.48s: it might be different if we're trading you know near let's say 52 week lows or things like you know
1507.08s: like that or high with high implied volatility then maybe if it was if the market was on the other
1512.04s: side and was near 52 week highs and and I thought the market was frothy but generally speaking you
1517.64s: know we tried to teach people to use any strategy that will improve basis and and that is you know
1528.60s: that's important to me improving basis so when you think about the evolution of your guys' homework
1540.04s: that you do because you come out with different statistical data points on all kinds of different
1545.56s: aspects of the market when you think for retail traders and they look at a market now and a lot of
1552.68s: retail very cash heavy a lot of them are very scared for the retail traders out there looking to
1557.40s: deploy capital now I think we're in the way that you view the current markets and how people might
1565.80s: choose to strategize off of that I think retail traders are scared right now in general across the
1572.04s: board because I think that the world of financial media and the world of financial media and the
1582.44s: whether that means cable or whether that means print whatever it is they have some inherent conflicts
1588.04s: in their message and their message is essentially to to get people scared because because fear sells
1597.80s: and I personally try to be crazy because I think that's complete bullshit I think that the fear is
1605.64s: actually fear equals opportunity to me and fear is generally almost always overpriced
1615.16s: complacency is under value and fear is over value and so I feel like the best time and the best
1622.04s: opportunities are when market is most fearful and I think that's where we are right now so my
1628.28s: I'm much right now at this point I'm much more into telling people hey you should be you know
1634.36s: taking risk and utilizing capital than anything else let's on brand for your typical approach to risk
1643.64s: so I'm very consistent what do you think about the way bonds have been behaving this year specifically
1652.44s: as it pertains to you know just the typical relationship with equities and bonds really are
1657.72s: in acting as a risk offset when the markets are obviously contracting it seems a bit interesting but
1665.64s: I've done a bit of homework on it myself to see how many times in history we've had these kind of
1671.00s: movements stuff like that but obviously you have way more qualitative information around that so
1676.20s: I would love your perspective on just the way the bond market is reacting right now what do you what
1681.16s: does that mean to you the bond market is reacting to me in it's it's over done I think it's over
1689.56s: done I think the bonds and I'm usually I mean I'm almost always a bond bear so it's really hard to
1697.72s: be to find me you know for 20 straight years I've been a bond bear and now all of a sudden I flip
1703.96s: to being long bonds I think they're the the second most oversold asset class I would argue the first
1714.28s: is global currencies versus the US dollar and second is bonds I don't think stocks are anywhere close
1722.92s: to as oversold as as bonds are at this point so bonds haven't had an uptick in you know whatever in
1731.96s: months and at this point you know where we are right now is bonds are reacting emotionally to the
1738.84s: Fed trying to play catch up and I think the Fed is basically irrelevant and so I I just feel like
1745.64s: the bonds are from a pot odds perspective the bonds are are one of the most well they're definitely
1753.00s: the most liquid interesting play in the world and they're probably the second best pot odds play
1760.04s: and there's a lot more to do in the bonds than there's to do in the currencies so yeah my answer
1764.12s: here is I actually for one of the rare times in my entire career I'm long bonds so you said
1772.44s: they're the second best pot odds obviously peak my interest is the number one pot odds in your
1779.24s: world the global currencies or is it something else that's global currencies I think the the number one
1786.84s: in my in my mind right at this point number one as far as you know just being purely overbought is
1795.48s: the US dollar I don't get the I don't get the I just can't believe people are still buying US
1804.12s: dollars at these levels relative to all the other currencies in the world I don't I don't for there's
1809.56s: no there's no way I understand it at all and I just don't like I just don't get the risk reward
1816.68s: it doesn't make a sense to me it just seems like we're we're at a problem here where the dollar
1822.12s: has become very very strong and a lot of debt is serviced in US dollars and I'm thinking a lot
1827.72s: of emerging markets might not be able to continue to service the debt frame I'm curious if you've
1831.40s: seen anything like this or what you think about what we're seeing now well I think the I don't know if I'm
1841.32s: I mean the public answer would be yes it is a credit it's going to be incredibly difficult
1847.16s: especially for emerging markets to continue to fight you know crashing currencies in the face of a
1853.16s: crazy strong dollar so the simple answer there is yes that that that presents a problem I I don't know
1864.12s: I think what the what the first of all this a couple of things most importantly is I think that
1871.64s: this sends a what's happened to the dollar this year sends a very important message to the rest
1876.76s: the world about the the need for having market structure that provides a a vehicle for across the
1887.80s: board liquidity and or you know derivatives of that liquidity because what you're seeing right now
1894.92s: is you know the dollar strength can also be tied to the fact that the dollar is
1902.28s: the economy where the dollar lives is the most liquid economy in the world so therefore it has
1907.08s: the most it has the most available dollars for investment which which continues to kind of
1912.76s: fuel the whole movement fuels the economy I think that if if people aren't watching this and they're
1919.96s: not understanding how important you know that deep pool of liquidity and efficiency is in order to
1926.52s: maintain a a consistent and sustainable economic cycle then I I don't know I don't know you can
1933.48s: ever teach a better class like I'm not sure where that message will come you know can come from
1940.20s: but because economic cycles are cyclical no matter what I mean they're not it's this is not it's
1946.04s: not necessarily I'm not taking this as a as a mean reverting thing I'm just thinking of this there's
1951.16s: there's a there's a reasonable amount of reciprocality that you can almost count on and I think for that reason
1959.00s: the dollar has to face some levels of disruption over the course of the next whether it's two months
1965.08s: three months six months a year whatever it is I just don't believe they can maintain this this level of
1972.04s: of you know hyperbolic moves one-dimensional I just don't I don't see this I'm a contrarian I'm a
1980.04s: true as a contrarian as a trader who's a contrarian with a expected move of almost double what it is
1987.56s: historically in currencies right now I just don't see how the dollar can maintain this level of
1992.68s: insanity speaking of levels of insanity something I noticed this year especially tracking like SPX
2000.36s: pretty closely there's been a couple periods of time like prolonged periods of time where
2005.48s: the variance risk premium or implied volatility projections actually came in lower than historic
2011.88s: volatility actually was and that surprises me given the current market I'm curious if that surprises you
2021.96s: you you are saying that the implied volatility understated what actually happened right
2028.20s: yeah there's periods of time that I've seen yeah that to be the case so that is a
2034.52s: this is very typical for a year that breaks a you know decade decade and a half long trend
2044.52s: implied volatility being being overstated with respect to realized volatility so this is actually
2053.16s: normalization and because volatility is a math model it is meme-roverting and so what you're seeing
2061.56s: here is a normalization in process you know you're seeing it happened in real time is that the
2067.96s: markets are normalizing and so we were due to have a year where realized volatility was greater
2075.48s: than implied which just means that what actually happened was greater than what was expected to happen
2082.76s: and and it's not that the market's actually mispriced anything but that it's that's what it looks
2088.28s: like but it's just hey this is normal it's it's just like everything is normalizing they're
2092.84s: averaging out that's all it is interesting and do you think that that function impacts your decision
2101.48s: on whether you choose to sell premium or buy premium well I don't ever buy premium so yes it but
2107.72s: it does impact my decision on when to sell premium leads me to a question for you because I've
2112.76s: actually done a couple studies myself on the typical duration where that has been the case for this
2118.68s: for at least this year because it's been popping up more where when realized it's higher than iV
2125.64s: on average in like spx how many days did that remain to be the case something like that before
2129.96s: it reverted again have you guys done any studies on that yet because I still have a little bit love
2134.36s: your guys is perspective on it i mean most of the time now this year has been a little bit weird
2139.56s: because this year we really haven't had very much contraction volatility but you know historically
2147.56s: volatility contracts at you know almost three times the pace that it expands and volatility also
2154.76s: tends to cluster at very low levels it does not cluster high levels so you know that we used
2161.32s: we used to say in a bull market it would be something like four to seven days but in a bear market
2167.32s: like we've seen now it's it's very different and all bets are off it's lasted some cases for months
2172.36s: I mean the longest that we've seen volatility expand you know over time is almost like 200 days
2178.84s: switching away from trading real quick and more to like a philosophical standpoint obviously you've
2183.72s: been building for a while you've building a lot you've created significant success in for people
2189.56s: that have worked with you what's the end goal like just as your wife said like why the fuck are you
2195.32s: doing this so well it's my it's my legacy I don't have it and you know like it's not I mean I'm
2205.00s: always in the business of trying to prove that I can make money and you know prove that I can be
2209.72s: successful in trade and things like that and but I'm past that point in my life now I have everything
2217.96s: I need I'm really just I've reached a point where where this is about my legacy I want to be known as
2228.68s: he hey he was a great entrepreneur and you know he built some really cool businesses and and I want
2236.36s: to I'm very competitive in the sense that you know I feel that what we do for finance is very
2244.84s: different and very important and I don't feel that anybody in this industry and I mean nobody in this
2253.16s: industry has shown themselves at this point willing to carry the torch forward and so I am very
2262.04s: protective of kind of the methodology and the approach that we take to finance and I'm not leaving
2272.52s: until I feel like we're in good hands like I don't feel like the other firms even the firms like you
2279.48s: know you say you say you think or something I mean it's a great platform but we've moved on and
2284.52s: now Schwab has it and I don't feel that they you know I mean although they protect the integrity of
2289.96s: the platform I don't feel they have the vision that I had at all and I don't feel that that you
2295.48s: know the future I don't like the future of finance in their hands even with technology that we built
2300.60s: there's more to it than that and I feel like you know like we're still on a mission here at Tasty and
2307.48s: um and I I have I have stuff left in the tank so I want to you know you know it's it's like
2316.12s: it's hard to explain because people go well well you could just go live on an island or buy a
2320.28s: freaking island who cares you know just you know just and do it I don't that's not even interesting to
2325.80s: you know that's interesting for for a long weekend but that's not interesting to me what's
2332.52s: interesting to me is like this conversation we're having right now like maybe this changes
2339.32s: somebody who listens to it maybe changes their life maybe changes your life I don't know you
2343.80s: know like but it's cool to me that you know that you have that we have an opportunity to tell our
2349.24s: story and that and that maybe other people can um I don't know you know take some of this stuff maybe
2355.96s: there's some takeaways and maybe they can say hey you know what if this if this fucker can do it I
2361.32s: can do it you know whatever it is I don't know but like it's just important that that they understand
2365.88s: kind of like where we're coming from and and you know why we're different um and you know our view
2373.72s: of finance the future of finance um it's very different than the traditional you know the traditional look
2381.64s: well I mean I I can say definitively that that you you actually have had a pretty profound
2387.96s: impact even on my life I think I've told you this already but I mean I I came from a single mom
2393.08s: who's working two jobs to just keep the lights on and I was trying to find anything I could do to
2397.96s: try to make some money and I started trading with a three thousand dollar account with what I could
2401.88s: scrape together and now I'm fortunate enough and I've grown it to seven figure account plus
2407.64s: and literally that is because of people like you that made me think that it's possible so I'm actually
2416.20s: really just taking a back by that response that you just gave because it's like very stoic I don't
2421.88s: know if you practice stoicism but that is like a big tenon of stoicism which is actually like a communal
2428.44s: obligation like the the if you have something to offer to continue delivering it to people which is
2434.92s: really inspiring to be completely honest it's really awesome to hear you say that you know it
2439.40s: I I thank you and I appreciate that but at the same time I I don't think of it that way like I
2445.48s: think of like that like this is what I do you know I mean like like like I don't even like it doesn't
2451.24s: even register with me you know it's like like I don't even there's nothing else I could do you know
2457.64s: right I don't I don't have it like I'm like people I love when people's one of my favorite questions is
2463.88s: when when I'm doing interview with somebody says hey like what are your hobbies and I go well I don't
2469.40s: really have a hobby like like they're like what do you mean everybody has a hobby and I'm like
2475.08s: everybody but me I mean I go I don't even know what you mean like I don't really have a hobby you know
2479.88s: like yeah you know I'm like hanging out with my friends and doing stuff and you know but but I don't
2485.16s: really I don't really have a hobby you know I'll do anything you know this is what I do I built I
2490.92s: build stuff like you know I work you know I love investing and building things and getting involved
2498.04s: and all that kind of stuff speaking of investing and you said before that you kind of have most of what
2504.44s: you want I actually wanted to push back on that because I'm not sure if it's created yet but I
2511.24s: saw an interview that you were talking about your newest venture in Chicago which is your iced tea shop
2519.00s: is that is that there yet or what's where are we at with that well actually I've invested in
2525.88s: it's a little bit bigger than that but the iced shop is my is is is kind of a front for it um
2535.64s: you know it's it's crazy I love iced tea so and I've always wanted a place in my neighborhood this
2540.60s: is not a this is not a like hey at times going to build 700 iced tea stores around the country
2547.24s: you know and he's gonna own he's gonna own iced tea franchise that's that's not it um this is just
2552.92s: been a um I've always wanted a place in my neighborhood where I could just walk to and hang out
2559.64s: instead of like you know I don't want to sit in my house I live in the city there's a lot of people
2564.20s: around you know I just wanted a fun place where we go just hang out and like you know talk crap and
2568.92s: you know meet you know meet friends I mean we always meet at different coffee shops you know
2574.84s: me and my buddies and I'm thinking hey you know let's take it our own place you know we can afford it
2579.08s: let's have some fun and um so that's it but it's actually part of a bigger project that I'm
2586.12s: that I'm invested in with with my son and um some of his buddies and it's it's a it's I'm not
2595.32s: getting the details but it's kind of like it's a it's an entertainment technology play kind of and
2600.60s: something you know I love helping those guys because they're young they're smart and I think I can
2608.04s: even though they don't think I know anything I think I know some stuff so I think I can help them
2612.20s: you know like with some ideas another thing that you've done that I'm actually very impressed by
2619.72s: and I've learned a lot from it is you do not shy away from new stuff like you're not
2627.16s: anti new technology some people get really entrenched in like what they use what they do what they
2633.80s: like what they don't like and I found that really and again inspiring and I don't use that term
2640.52s: lightly the fact that you purposely hire different generations from yourself to get different ideas
2647.00s: to challenge the status quo you're doing things like getting involved in cryptocurrency you talk
2653.16s: about that stuff even though a lot of older investors and traders say oh it's all bullshit you
2658.36s: know it's all fake how have you cultivated that receptiveness to new ideas new technology because
2664.92s: I think it's important and it's something that I'm trying to learn myself first of all I hang out
2669.48s: with a lot of young kids and I hire I try to hire crazy smart you know people from all different
2679.72s: generations but hopefully you know we get a lot of young people in here because I need that know how
2685.16s: we have some older people some younger people's everything and I'm actually building an app right
2691.32s: now for tasty which I think is going to compete head on with we bull robin hood M1 and everybody
2702.28s: else I'm building an app right now for gen zers that I think it's going to change the entire industry
2708.60s: and it'll be out next year and I think it's going to be one of the coolest trading apps ever but
2714.60s: the key to it is it is completely the opposite of every trading app ever built in that it
2723.88s: preaches basically and you're going to think I'm crazy but I can explain it preaches hey this is an
2731.24s: app for you to learn how to lose money yeah a lot of questions come up there I think I get it
2738.68s: actually because I like that angle and I like the antithesis because if you learn how to lose money
2744.28s: obviously you can learn to make money but yeah why are we focusing on how to lose money
2751.40s: there is I believe in life that the some of the most important things we can do to be successful is
2761.40s: learn from our mistakes and learn from our losses and learn from our you know you even started to
2768.92s: talk about it before like you know you like you can kind of tell the character of people and
2773.00s: ideas from from think when things go bad when things go good everything's easy but when things go
2777.96s: bad that's where you can tell hey this is this is the real champion you know this is and so I'm tired
2785.40s: of of handle I think we try to handle like an entire young generation with kid gloves and say hey
2791.40s: you know what when you're when you're 22 years old you're just graduating college or something like
2795.96s: that hey you know you should be putting all your money into a 401k and IRA account so that in 40
2800.92s: years if you're still alive and we get to take 30 or 40 percent out in fees you might have something
2806.28s: left you know and my my philosophy is hey fuck that we should be we should be in a situation where
2814.12s: if I'm 22 years old hey Tom teach me how to take risk teach me how to do like don't don't teach me
2821.32s: how to play blackjack you know or poker I don't care teach me how to take real risk and I'm willing
2826.68s: to lose and if I do lose I'm gonna gain something from it I'm gonna understand something and
2834.60s: I'm sick of all the crazy apps like you know like Acorn and Stash and some Robo advisor because
2842.52s: you know you invest in those when you're 22 and you wake up 40 years later and you're 62 and you
2848.20s: don't know anything right and and I don't think Robin Hood I don't think we bull I don't think I
2854.28s: don't think you know all these other apps for millennials public whatever they are all the different
2859.40s: ones they don't they don't do it either they don't understand nobody gets it this is about you know
2865.24s: somebody has to introduce risk and and I feel like that's where that's that's my that's my domain
2873.64s: crazy risk you know you be the person that teaches that teaches a generation how to take risk so
2880.12s: that's what I'm working on right now that's actually really really cool I you know whenever you guys
2885.96s: make some progress on it or you're ready to show some of that I would love to to look at that with
2890.12s: you all because that's that's one of the things that I try to talk to my audience about specifically
2894.76s: is having a trade log at least and you know I don't go super far with it and I know people like
2900.20s: you that are literally doing hundreds of trades of day or not gonna fill out a trade log but I do
2905.24s: think at least having a way to review what we're doing to learn from it is where we gain most of the
2911.56s: value so I literally love that you're creating something that's really predicated on a on achieving that
2917.40s: so that and you know next time I'm in Chicago to get straight up disrespected by your winner
2923.40s: I'll have to figure out where I see shop is and and try some I see because I do like an Arnold Palmer
2928.36s: that's one of my favorites don't think you're getting an R Palmer my I see shop there's no
2932.84s: eliminated there your own lemonade actually there's a couple because it wouldn't be my shop if
2938.76s: there wasn't a couple of gimmicks so there's a couple of gimmicks so so I can't tell you about the
2943.64s: gimmicks on air because there it's you're gonna have to go there fair enough well I'll also be ready
2949.56s: to smuggle in some of my own lemonade if I have to I know you won't have to well a lot of other
2954.44s: stuff don't you worry about it but Tom we're at time and like I said I really respect you
2960.04s: carving out an opportunity to chat with us so thank you so much for hanging out I'll drop all the
2964.20s: links to tctrade tcworks all the stuff that you guys are doing in the video description below
2968.20s: unless there's anywhere else that you want to specifically let people know where they can get a hold
2972.20s: you know this is great I'm just if anybody has any questions they want to write me I'm just
2976.28s: Tom at tctrade but you can just yeah just drop them all tell Brett we're good okay perfect that
2982.84s: that's awesome let me kill this off we'll catch everybody later
