0.00s:  What's up everybody Eric here I am super stoked I got Tom saws
4.16s:  off from tasty trade. He's the guy that actually built or led the
9.80s:  development of this software that's in the background here that I still use
13.32s:  now which is think or swim. So first off Tom thank you so much for taking
17.56s:  some time to come hang out and talk trading with us. We really appreciate your time.
21.80s:  Sure. Looking forward to it. Yeah so like I was telling you right before we
26.64s:  started I started trading options really young I was super fortunate to come
31.28s:  across it and it was really like 2008 not a lot of great resources out there.
36.60s:  And then I came across you guys when I was in college and I reached out to a
42.32s:  few times to chat with you and something that always stuck out to me about
47.08s:  your approach to trading and investing is you made it feel possible. You made
51.40s:  it feel approachable to me. You would talk about very advanced concepts but
55.96s:  you made it so that it felt like somebody like me who didn't really know
59.12s:  anything that I could potentially dip my toe in. How did you develop that
64.76s:  ability to translate really complex topics but make it approachable to such a
70.44s:  large number of people. It's a personal question but I'm very curious the answer.
75.44s:  Well it's funny you put it that way because a lot of times I like to describe my
79.04s:  own journey in this business and a lot of the like the crazy success that we've
84.96s:  had at different points about you know and tie it back into our ability to
90.12s:  make what we say is complex topics simple. In fact I just went on the road and
96.52s:  did a couple of college PhD and undergrad lectures and the topic of the
105.20s:  lecture was specifically for PhD students which were not necessarily finance
110.40s:  PhD students was making complex topics simple and how to how to monetize that
116.40s:  and turn it into you know some kind of business because because a lot of smart
120.24s:  really smart people have a really difficult time you know and again it's not
126.52s:  it's not about dumbing things down it's it's really about you know being able to
133.68s:  tell a story. Yeah one of the keys to to to building a successful business is
142.96s:  is being able to articulate what you're doing and being able to make it
148.52s:  relatable to everybody so that you're not talking in some kind of language that
152.48s:  nobody really understands you know we make a general assumption upfront hey
157.12s:  everybody's smart but make it something that you know hey it's fun it's
161.04s:  approachable it's it's easy to understand you know you can you can you can tie
166.08s:  everything together it's logical that kind of stuff but it seems like you have
170.96s:  found a really interesting balance between highlighting the stuff that really
175.00s:  matters and not wasting as much time on those other more esoteric concepts I'm
181.28s:  really wondering how did you start trying to teach people about options like how
187.24s:  that doesn't seem like a huge potential marketplace so why options why not
191.60s:  just stock trading why not something else well two things first thing is you're
198.80s:  a little young to remember Arthur Ash but he's a great tennis player and I I
204.28s:  saw him do an interview once and I'll never forget he he he said during the
207.88s:  interview you know that somebody said to him because you know how do you you
212.28s:  know you went five sets and you look so fresh at the end of five sets and you
216.16s:  know you kind of you kind of had more energy at the end than your opponent and he
221.40s:  goes hey I don't go up to the balls I can't get and you know what that that
227.92s:  always kind of stuck with me because in business I I kind of feel like I don't
233.60s:  go after the balls I can't get you know you know I'm saying I'm right I kind of
240.16s:  handled things that I I can that I know I can do so I think that's a that's a
245.36s:  big part of it I got into options originally because when when I got out of
251.60s:  college we were in the middle of a recession it was 1979 and it was pretty
262.88s:  hard to get a job and I was a political science major and my the best
271.24s:  interview I had was with a financial firm and they offered me a job some
275.32s:  how which back then was like almost unheard of on your first interview because
279.64s:  it's hard to get you know good jobs and this was a job on Wall Street and I was
283.60s:  living in New York because I was like done I'll take it you know and I didn't
287.12s:  think I would stay there for 40 some odd years you know I mean in the industry
291.16s:  but I I learned options because I hung around when I first got this job with
297.28s:  a bunch of young option they were like everybody liked options and I didn't
301.24s:  know anything about them was the first time I've ever seen them and I learned
304.76s:  them pretty quick and you know I just decided that if I was gonna really do
310.68s:  something in this space I had to quit the job that I wanted so bad and and go to
316.64s:  Chicago where where I'd never been before and you know go to the exchange where
321.92s:  the action was which leads to two questions you just answered one of them
326.80s:  which is why have you stayed in Chicago because I've been there twice and I'm from
331.40s:  New York originally I went to school in Rochester but I always felt like
334.64s:  the the winner in in I went there to Chicago during the winter and I felt like
340.00s:  your guys this winter just straight up disrespected me in my jacket because I
344.36s:  was used to the cold but that was a different kind of cold the I felt yeah was
356.44s:  weird like I never see those you remember those New Yorker cartoons were
360.72s:  like we're pretty much if you grew up in New York the end of the world was
366.08s:  like at the end of the East River you know like once you crossed over you know
369.32s:  George Washington Bridge or the tap and Z you know it was it was pretty much you
373.72s:  know where the tri-perl you know that was the end that that's where the United
377.84s:  States stopped so I always I never I really had never been west of anything
383.88s:  like I you know I grew up on East Coast if if I went on vacation I went north
387.68s:  and you know it's a ski in the East Coast or went to Cape you know I never went
392.08s:  anywhere but where you could drive on the East Coast so I'd never been west and
396.16s:  when the opportunity came up to go to Chicago you know I I just fell in love
401.32s:  with the city I to this day I think it's one of the best cities in the world I
406.48s:  think it's the best city in America you know like it's it's crazy beautiful
409.76s:  city and with amazing architecture with everything you have in like New
414.32s:  York but but you can drive it's livable like a house in the city you know it's
419.32s:  like I just fall in love with this city it's safe it's just you know it gets a
424.24s:  bad rap sometimes because of the weather and because of some of the crime you
427.12s:  know but I don't think you know I get used to it right yeah it's not necessarily
432.36s:  representative of the whole place I've been here now two-thirds of my life so
436.16s:  you know it's it's just and this is where you know back when I started this was
441.16s:  the last Chicago was the last frontier of of what I would call like kind of true
446.72s:  capitalism in the sense that you know where else could you go with you know 20 or
450.60s:  25 grand and you know Lisa Seat and and hopefully you know make it in this
454.88s:  business I mean there wasn't we didn't have entrepreneurship then and it wasn't
459.08s:  like you know there was no there was no word like that and so we would you
464.28s:  know this was to me the last frontier of of real free market capitalism and I
470.16s:  just happened to get lucky I stuck around how did you develop this relationship
474.64s:  with risk like you just said you know taking 25 Gs going to Chicago and just let's
478.92s:  see how it goes that seems insane to me but like you're obviously comfortable
483.64s:  with risk how did that relationship build how did you create that you know it's
489.40s:  it I know it's gonna sound a little crazy but I mean I've obviously developed
494.80s:  it over the years that even a different appetite for risks and things like
499.32s:  that but but the reality is that I think some people are maybe it's maybe it's
505.12s:  just part of their their DNA almost you know like like I was definitely somebody
511.84s:  that was open to I was open to unlimited risk I marked over time to be a little
519.56s:  bit more measured about risk I'm a risk freak and now I know there's not like
524.64s:  there's a difference between like somebody that jumps out of an airplane without a
528.24s:  parachute you know and and that kind of risk and the kind of risk that I'm
534.28s:  talking about but I'm willing to roll the dice constantly like like you know I
540.84s:  roll the dice when I was 20 I roll the dice when I'm 40 50 you know when we
544.88s:  built thinker some we rolled the dice everything we had when we built Tasty we
548.56s:  rolled the dice with everything we had you know I mean I don't I don't hold
553.96s:  back and every opportunity to take risk and this is one of things I think that
559.24s:  you know one of the things that your generation is you're right your generation
562.92s:  has been relatively risk averse when both my kids are wrapped around your age
567.00s:  once 30 once 33 so I'm kind of in you know I'm familiar with and I work with both
571.96s:  them so I'm familiar with your wheelhouse and I think that generation needed you
577.08s:  know needed to need to learn risk better and it's challenging for them and it's
583.84s:  challenging for a lot of people but to me learning how to a appreciate risk be
591.88s:  how to assess risk and see how to deal with risk when it is when it works and
599.20s:  when it fails are the keys to long-term wealth creation and success do you
605.98s:  think that there's something to be said about you know traders being able to
609.48s:  mentally partition the capital that they're trading with or how do you view that
613.48s:  relationship with trading capital I am able to partition it a bit but I'm in a
622.12s:  situation where obviously I have the the ability to do that because I have the
627.44s:  means to do that but I started in this business where so so I from the day I got
635.84s:  Chicago when I was 23 years old 24 years old till now so 40 years later I
644.00s:  essentially have been eating what I kill like I've only had two jobs in my life
651.52s:  that I've got a paycheck went both of them were when we were bought out so for
657.92s:  the first 20 some odd years of my career you know I mean I worked for myself I
662.24s:  was an independent market maker and I had to learn how to you know of the
671.12s:  capital we had when I say we I mean the capital I made you know I had to learn
676.20s:  how to you know protect the franchise so to speak and as I made money I had to
682.16s:  put a little bit away because you know I wanted to do things like you know build a
686.08s:  house have a family you know that kind of thing and on the other hand I needed
689.92s:  capital to grow my business because as a market maker as a trader you know those
696.20s:  with more capital can do more things and I had to really learn how to do both
700.76s:  those and then throughout the years you know when we made investments and you know
704.96s:  like like in a story I'd love to tell is you know 20 years almost 20 years after
710.96s:  I started so it's 1999 so it's 18 or 19 years when we built thinkorsome Scott
718.08s:  Sheridan I who did the you know we did we were partners and we founded
723.24s:  thinkorsome together we took all the money we had made over the past 19 years
727.76s:  and didn't even tell our wives or anybody and we basically took every dime we
736.60s:  made and built thinkorsome you know millions of dollars but it was like it was
741.72s:  all the money we had and we rolled every penny of it into thinkorsome so we
747.28s:  didn't we didn't hold back one like we didn't we raised some capital after
752.32s:  that but initially you know we we we put up a hundred percent of the capital
756.40s:  ourselves and built the whole thing you know with our own money and then we
760.40s:  raised capital and you know we at first it was hard to raise capital in the
764.20s:  middle of a meltdown in 2000 you know when when the markets were crashing but
769.72s:  then when we turned around and we built tasty we did the exact same thing we
774.00s:  at this time we didn't roll you know we didn't take all our money but you
777.56s:  know we we funded the whole thing and rolled the dice and blah blah blah and I
782.08s:  think it's really important to in life that every time you have an
788.00s:  opportunity to take risk you should take it and those those that those people
793.28s:  that tell other people hey you know what you shouldn't do that it's too risky
797.08s:  or you shouldn't do that it's you know it's not smarter anything like that you
801.04s:  know I don't I don't believe in that at all I mean obviously there's some
805.12s:  things like you know you shouldn't go out and spend a million dollars on lottery
807.76s:  tickets because that's stupid but if you have the ability to assess risk and
812.28s:  bet on yourself and your confidence and you know you have to do it I just
817.56s:  don't I don't even like the alternative if there's no alternative for me I'm
822.64s:  a hundred percent all in and that's even to this day like my wife will still
827.20s:  say to me that she's you know she'll be like what the fuck is wrong with you like
830.84s:  why are you still doing this like why are you you know like you know why are
835.60s:  you risking a million dollars in this or you know or to me like what are you
839.32s:  thinking like what are you doing and I'm like what do you mean you know like you
842.92s:  know this is this is who I am like don't you know she's like whatever you know
847.80s:  she's like why are you still doing this I'm like that's that's what I do it's
852.68s:  well it's really interesting and as you can tell my dog Thor is also very
855.56s:  interested in your take on risk he's he's wearing a tuxedo but I one of the one
865.32s:  of the things that really drew me to what you talk about is I would watch some
869.76s:  of your guys' live streams and you would have trades that weren't going in
872.68s:  your favor and you never got wound up about it it was never a huge deal it was
878.00s:  always like very emotionally regulated and that appealed to me because in the
883.28s:  military and the Marine Corps specifically we we teach a lot of that because the
886.76s:  last thing you want is if shit is hitting the fan for the person who's supposed
890.68s:  to be leading everybody to be losing their shit it's not a great example
893.64s:  nothing good happens of course yeah so how for retail traders that are notoriously
901.32s:  emotionally tied to their trades obviously you're wired differently they're
907.16s:  also wired differently how do you think they could potentially think about those
911.92s:  trades that are not going well to mentally keep them kind of regulated so that
917.56s:  they're not going through this emotional rollercoaster as a trades up they're
921.12s:  elated as the trades down they're depressed well one of the things that we do I
927.24s:  think really well here at Tasty is we hammer home the concept of there is no
935.12s:  real defense mechanism in trading other than keeping your size you know in check
941.36s:  and so one of the things that I think we've done probably better than anybody in
945.76s:  the world is can is really convinced people that if you trade small there's a lot
951.36s:  less that you have to worry about like when things when things go bad so we are
957.00s:  we're proactive in the sense of getting people to trade reasonable trade
962.16s:  size which I think protects them against kind of that really ugly you know that
968.28s:  a loose time now that doesn't mean that there's not tons of a loose scenarios we
971.76s:  get that that's traded but we also try to bring a very logical approach to
979.72s:  you know the way we adjust positions the way we reduce size or roll out I mean
984.36s:  like I feel like living in the option world it's much more strategic and
989.96s:  there are it's got a lot more flexibility or optionality when things go wrong as
996.88s:  opposed to a very black and white position like a stock position or a
1001.12s:  futures position you know I feel like option positions have a lot more choices
1004.96s:  when things go wrong so that's one of things we like about it's just more
1008.04s:  strategic got it I think that makes a lot of sense and I think one of the things
1013.92s:  you brought up was the idea of you know position management and I actually I
1018.48s:  still remember there was a series that you did for a while I want to say it was
1023.36s:  with your your daughter but it was like it's teaching her to trade yeah where do I
1029.00s:  start with my daughter case I did it for like two years love that and that was
1034.20s:  actually one of the things and I purposely wanted to bring that up to again like
1038.56s:  I believe in giving people like props when I can and that was a really
1043.68s:  interesting series because again I saw you take something like option is
1048.12s:  trading which essentially the the pool is as deep as you want it to be you can
1052.24s:  go really really deep into volatility jump models and so on and so forth if
1056.56s:  you're so inclined but you kept the information very pertinent to what you
1062.84s:  need to trade and slowly getting further into detail I'm very curious if you
1069.52s:  were to teach that same series again with your daughter with somebody else how
1075.16s:  would the way you teach that change since that was about a decade ago really
1080.20s:  what I'm hinting at here is starting to dip my toe into picking your brain on
1084.84s:  the evolution of options markets from essentially a decade ago to now well you
1092.64s:  know over the last I mean I basically I'm basically a junkie an option
1098.92s:  junkie and I've been in this business now like I said over four decades I've
1103.84s:  probably made more trades than anybody else alive I mean good and bad both you
1109.36s:  know I probably have more losers than anybody ever and I probably have more
1112.36s:  winners and I probably made more trades I mean to this day I still average
1116.76s:  almost a hundred trades a day and so yeah so I don't like you know I'm true junkie
1122.56s:  and I use my own technology you know like it's I mean I use the same technology
1126.40s:  our customers use same rates everything so so I'm very I'm one of the few CEOs
1133.12s:  in this business or one of the few you know like like people that run they build
1139.60s:  this stuff and run it actually you know uses all the same markets trades all
1143.24s:  the same stuff you know all over the place so I basically practice what I
1146.56s:  preach I would do things differently today than I did with case because we've
1151.80s:  learned a lot over the last you know I mean you know six or seven years and
1155.84s:  she's still you know she's our chief compliance officer she's she's amazing
1159.16s:  she works her butt off at the for this business but and I'm glad she learned it
1164.16s:  but I feel like I've gotten better at being able to you know explain mechanical
1176.36s:  optimization when it comes to trading I feel like I've gotten better at kind of
1180.92s:  you know I'm better at articulating some of the things that I might have stumbled
1185.76s:  on you know 10 years ago you know just trying to just trying to kind of explain
1191.20s:  what we do I've never looked at myself as as a great teacher because I don't
1196.48s:  really I don't like to teach that much but I've looked at myself as a good
1200.76s:  storyteller and as a good kind of somebody that that has not necessarily good
1208.08s:  field for the markets but somebody that's fully engaged in the markets I can
1211.20s:  talk about it I mean I've basically watched every single tick in the S&P's for
1217.84s:  42 years like I like nobody has sat here which is something that I should
1225.60s:  probably be like insanely scary you know because because it shows that I don't
1231.80s:  have much else to my existence you know like you know I haven't taken a vacation
1237.04s:  three years you know I can't afford to I just haven't you know I'm crazy that way
1242.92s:  it's interesting and you know one of the things that you said there that I
1248.12s:  thought I definitely want to mention though that one of the things you did I
1252.04s:  think a killer job when you were teaching case was she embodied a lot of the
1260.76s:  hesitation that a lot of us had and I still remember there was a couple episodes
1264.76s:  you're just like just put the trade on just just click the button just be just
1267.80s:  well she's she's she's not so we have a lot of similar characteristics but one
1276.20s:  of things that she did did not get for me was an appetite for risk and so and
1282.32s:  she's very detailed and very like she wants to make sure she's doing the right
1286.60s:  thing you know I'm okay with making a mistake she is not right really gets
1292.90s:  her frustrated and so she was very frustrated by that just make the trade you
1297.70s:  know like that that was the worst thing you can tell somebody that says detail
1301.70s:  like she's one of these people that reads the instructions to any you know
1305.82s:  like I don't even look at instructions you know I'm like I don't even
1308.70s:  stick in instructions I can figure this out and and I might sit there for two
1312.10s:  hours you know and butcher it and she might do it in 15 minutes after reading all
1316.22s:  the instructions but she's an instruction reader and I'm not you know so that's
1320.34s:  kind of a difference how do you view the aptitude and the skill development
1326.70s:  over retail trader over a decade ago specifically on what skills do you think
1331.78s:  that they just are knocking out of the park now compared to what you were seeing
1336.38s:  a while ago well the difference is that there is there is a
1347.42s:  there's just you know and again tastes is pretty unique in the sense that we
1353.46s:  don't do things the way everybody else does things and we changed you know what
1357.42s:  we believe is the important we changed content and the context of contents so
1363.62s:  that we can give people a very different perspective like like you know when
1369.74s:  I first got in the retail business when we built costs you know 20-some years
1374.18s:  ago the first thing everybody wanted from us was hey you know we can't trade
1378.90s:  without this charting study or that charting study we can't trade without this
1381.98s:  piece of you know information or news or whatever it is and I think that's what's
1387.38s:  what's happened now is we don't get that at all now we get like crazy complex
1391.86s:  questions you know about about implied volatility expected move you know
1396.90s:  duration you know rolling like everything all of the
1404.18s:  I think you might have muted I don't know if it's on Miria
1417.38s:  yeah I can't hear you now can you hear me now yeah gotcha okay yeah it's
1422.34s:  weird sometimes my system switches off so I feel like I'm not sure where I
1429.38s:  left off but I what I was saying was that that in the last 20 years the level the
1438.62s:  level of the change in content that we deliver is went from subjective to
1447.86s:  quantitative and it has changed the way people look at strategic finance we are
1452.90s:  now pure product indifferent you know 20 years ago people go I trade stocks
1459.30s:  somebody else to go I trade futures somebody else to say I trade options you
1462.38s:  know now we are completely product indifferent and we're strategically in
1466.66s:  different we don't care I feel like a lot of retail traders they learn
1472.54s:  options and then they start going down a very typical progression of strategies
1477.06s:  if you were to think of a handful of strategies that you think retail
1482.10s:  traders should prioritize like a new retail trader what kind of strategies do
1485.62s:  you think they should start looking at well I don't think it's I don't think it's
1491.18s:  that easy I think it really depends on the the market environment and you know
1497.46s:  like right now if you said hey what should people look at you know I think it
1501.66s:  might be different if we're trading you know near let's say 52 week lows or
1506.50s:  things like you know like that or high with high implied volatility then maybe if
1510.06s:  it was if the market's on the other side and was near 52 week highs and and I
1514.54s:  thought the market was frothy but generally speaking you know we tried to teach
1519.02s:  people to use any strategy that will improve basis and that is you know that's
1528.86s:  important to me improving basis so when you think about the evolution of your
1538.62s:  guys is homework that you do because you come out with different statistical
1543.10s:  data points on all kinds of different aspects of the market when you think for
1548.82s:  retail traders and they look at a market now and a lot of retail very cash heavy
1554.22s:  a lot of them are very scared for the retail traders out there looking to
1557.50s:  deploy capital now I think we're in the way that you view the current markets and
1563.82s:  how people might choose to strategize off of that I think retail traders are scared
1570.14s:  right now in general across the board because I think that the world of financial media and
1579.42s:  the world of financial media and the whether that means cable or whether that means print
1584.86s:  whatever it is they have some inherent conflicts in their message and their message is essentially
1593.34s:  to get people scared because because fear sells and I personally try to be crazy because I think
1600.86s:  that's complete bullshit I think that the fear is actually fear equals opportunity to me
1611.26s:  and fear is generally almost always overpriced complacency complacency is undervalued and fear is
1618.38s:  overvalued and so I feel like the best time and the best opportunities are when market is most
1623.50s:  fearful and I think that's where we are right now so my I'm much right now at this point I'm much
1630.78s:  more into telling people hey you should be you know taking risk and and utilizing capital than
1638.70s:  anything else let's arm brand for your typical approach to risk so I'm very consistent
1645.90s:  and what do you think about the way bonds have been behaving this year specifically as it pertains to
1653.34s:  you know just the typical relationship with equities and bonds really are enacting as a risk
1658.70s:  off asset when the markets are obviously contracting it seems a bit interesting but I've done
1666.22s:  a bit of homework on it myself to see how many times in history we've had these kind of movement
1671.34s:  stuff like that but obviously you have way more qualitative information around that so I would
1676.46s:  love your perspective on just the way the bond market is reacting right now what do you what does
1681.26s:  that mean to you the bond market is reacting to me in it's it's overdone I think it's overdone
1689.82s:  I think the bonds and I'm usually I mean I'm almost always a bond bear so it's really hard to
1697.90s:  to find me you know for 20 straight years I've been a bond bear and now all of a sudden I flip
1703.98s:  to being long bonds I think they're the the second most oversold asset class I would argue the first
1714.30s:  is global currencies versus the US dollar and second is bonds I don't think stocks are anywhere close
1722.94s:  to as oversold as as bonds are at this point so bonds haven't had an uptick in you know whatever in
1731.98s:  months and at this point you know where we are right now is bonds are reacting emotionally to the
1738.86s:  Fed trying to play catch up and I think the Fed is basically irrelevant and so I I just feel like
1745.66s:  the bonds are from a pot odds perspective the bonds are are one of the most well they're definitely
1753.02s:  the most liquid interesting play in the world and they're probably the second best pot odds play
1760.06s:  and there's a lot more to do in the bonds than there's to do in the currencies so yeah my answer here
1764.22s:  is I actually for one of the rare times in my entire career I'm long bonds so you said they're the
1772.94s:  second best pot odds obviously peak my interest is the number one pot odds in your world the global
1779.98s:  currencies or is it something else that's global currencies I think the the number one in my in my
1787.82s:  mind right at this point number one as far as you know just being purely over bought is the US dollar
1796.70s:  I don't get the I don't get the I just can't believe people are still buying US dollars at these
1804.70s:  levels relative to all the other currencies in the world I don't I don't for there's no there's no
1810.70s:  way I understand it at all and I just don't like I just don't get the risk reward doesn't make a sense
1818.86s:  to me it just seems like we're we're at a problem here where the dollars become very very strong
1823.58s:  and a lot of debt is serviced in US dollars and I'm thinking a lot of emerging markets might not be
1828.94s:  able to continue to service the debt frame I'm curious if you've seen anything like this or what
1832.30s:  you think about what we're seeing now well I think the I don't know if I'm I mean the public answer
1842.78s:  would be yes it is a credit it's going to be incredibly difficult especially for emerging markets
1849.10s:  to continue to fight you know crashing currencies in the face of a crazy strong dollar
1857.58s:  so the simple answer there is yes that that that that presents a problem I I don't know
1864.14s:  I think what the what the first of all this a couple things most importantly is I think that this
1871.90s:  sends a what's happened to the dollar this year sends a very important message to the rest of the
1876.94s:  world about the the need for having market structure that provides a a vehicle for across the
1887.82s:  board liquidity and or you know derivatives of that liquidity because what you're seeing right now
1894.94s:  is you know the dollar strength can also be tied to the fact that the dollar is the the economy
1903.02s:  where the dollar lives is the most liquid economy in the world so therefore it has the most it has
1908.38s:  the most available dollars for investment which which continues to kind of fuel the whole movement
1914.38s:  fuels the economy I think that if if people aren't watching this and they're not
1921.02s:  understanding how important you know that deep pool of liquidity and efficiency is in order to
1926.54s:  maintain a a consistent and sustainable economic cycle then I I don't know I don't know you can
1933.50s:  ever teach a better class like I'm not sure where that message will come you know can come from
1940.22s:  but because economic cycles are cyclical no matter what I mean they're not it's this is not it's
1946.06s:  not necessarily I'm not taking this as a mean reverting thing I'm just thinking of this there's a
1951.74s:  reasonable amount of reciprocality that you can almost count on and I think for that reason
1959.02s:  the dollar has to face some levels of disruption over the course of the next whether it's two
1964.78s:  months three months six months a year whatever it is I just don't believe they can maintain this this
1970.78s:  level of you know hyperbolic moves one-dimensional I just don't I don't see this I'm a
1979.18s:  contrarian I'm a true as a contrarian as a trader who's a contrarian with a expected move of almost
1986.78s:  double what it is historically in currencies right now I just don't see how the dollar can maintain
1991.66s:  this level of insanity speaking of levels of insanity something I noticed this year especially
1998.38s:  tracking like SPX pretty closely there's been a couple periods of time like prolonged periods of
2004.38s:  time where the variance risk premium or implied volatility projections actually came in lower than
2010.78s:  historic volatility actually was and that surprises me given the current market I'm curious if
2019.18s:  that surprises you you you you are saying that the implied volatility understated what actually
2026.94s:  happened right yeah there's periods of time that I've seen yeah that to be the case oh that is a
2034.54s:  this is very typical for a year that breaks a you know decade decade and a half long trend
2044.54s:  implied volatility being being overstated with respect to realized volatility so this is actually
2053.18s:  normalization and because volatility is a math model it is mean reverting and so what you're
2061.34s:  seeing here is a normalization in process you know you're seeing it happened in real time is that
2067.74s:  the markets are normalizing and so we were due to have a year where realized volatility was greater
2075.50s:  than implied which just means that what actually happened was greater than what was expected to happen
2082.70s:  and and it's not that the market's actually mispriced anything but that it's that's what it looks
2088.30s:  like but it's just hey this is normal it's it's just like everything is normalizing they're
2092.86s:  averaging out that's all it is interesting and do you think that that function impacts your decision
2101.50s:  on whether you choose to sell premium or buy premium well I don't ever buy premium so yes it
2107.58s:  but it does impact my decision on when to sell premium leads me to a question for you because I've
2112.86s:  actually done a couple studies myself on the typical duration where that has been the case for this
2118.70s:  for at least this year because it's been popping up more where when realized it's higher than
2125.10s:  IV on average in like SPX how many days did that remain to be the case something like that before
2129.98s:  it reverted again have you guys done any studies on that yet because I still have a love
2134.30s:  your guys is perspective on it I mean most of the time now this year has been a little bit weird
2139.58s:  because this year we really haven't had very much contraction volatility but you know historically
2147.50s:  volatility contracts at you know almost three times the pace that it expands and volatility
2154.22s:  also tends to cluster at very low levels it does not cluster high levels so you know that we used
2160.62s:  we we used to say in a bull market it would be something like four to seven days but in a bear
2167.10s:  market like we've seen now it's it's very different and all bets are off it's lasted some cases
2171.58s:  for months I mean the longest that we've seen volatility expand you know over time is almost like
2177.02s:  200 days switching away from trading real quick and more to like a philosophical standpoint obviously
2183.50s:  you've been building for a while you've building a lot you've created significant success in for
2189.26s:  people that have worked with you what's the end goal like just as your wife said like why the
2194.94s:  fuck are you doing this so well it's it's my it's my legacy I don't have it and you know like it's not
2204.06s:  I mean I'm always in the business of trying to prove that I can make money and you know prove
2209.26s:  that I can be successful in trade and things like that and and but I'm past that point in my life now
2217.10s:  I have everything I need I'm really just I've reached a point where where this is about my legacy
2224.14s:  I want to be known as he hey he was a great entrepreneur and you know he built some really cool
2233.42s:  businesses and and I want to I'm very competitive in the sense that you know I feel that what we do
2242.14s:  for finance is very different and very important and I don't feel that anybody in this industry
2251.58s:  and I mean nobody in this industry has shown themselves at this point willing to carry the torch forward
2259.90s:  and so I am very protective of kind of the methodology and the approach that we take to finance
2269.66s:  and I'm not leaving until I feel like we're in good hands like I don't feel like the other firms
2278.38s:  even the firms like you know you say you think or something I mean it's a great platform
2282.94s:  but we've moved on and now Schwab has it and I don't feel that they you know I mean although they
2288.70s:  protect the integrity of the platform I don't feel they have the vision that I had at all and I
2294.14s:  don't feel that that you know the future I don't like the future of finance in their hands even
2299.02s:  with technology that we built there's more to it than that and I feel like you know like we're still
2304.86s:  on a mission here at Tasty and and I I have I have stuff left in the tank so I want to you know
2313.90s:  you know it's it's like it's hard to explain because people go well well you can just go live
2319.42s:  on an island or buy a freaking island who cares you know just you know just and do it I don't that's
2324.30s:  not even interesting to me you know that's interesting for for a long weekend but that's not
2331.42s:  interesting to me what's interesting to me is like this conversation we're having right now like
2336.54s:  maybe this changes somebody who listens to it maybe changes their life maybe changes your life I
2342.62s:  don't know you know like but it's cool to me that you know that you have that we have an opportunity
2348.70s:  to tell our story and that and that maybe other people can I don't know you know take some of this
2355.50s:  stuff maybe there's some takeaways and maybe they can say hey you know what if this if this
2360.62s:  fucker can do it I can do it you know whatever it is I don't know but like it's just important
2364.86s:  that that they understand kind of like where we're coming from and and you know why we're different
2371.50s:  and you know our view of finance the future of finance it's very different than the traditional
2379.10s:  you know the traditional look well I mean I I can say definitively that you you actually have had
2387.10s:  a pretty profound impact even on my life I think I've told you this already but I mean I came
2392.22s:  from a single mom who's working two jobs to just keep the lights on and I was trying to find anything
2397.42s:  I could do to try to make some money and I started trading with a three thousand dollar account
2401.42s:  with what I could scrape together and now I'm fortunate enough and I've grown it to seven figure
2405.98s:  account plus and literally that is because of people like you that made me think that it's possible
2413.98s:  so I'm actually really just taking a back by that response that you just gave because it's like
2420.94s:  very stoic I don't know if you practice stoicism but that is like a big tenant of stoicism which
2426.54s:  is actually like a communal obligation like the the if you have something to offer to continue
2432.86s:  delivering it to people which is really inspiring to be completely honest it's really awesome to hear
2438.38s:  you say that you know it I thank you and I appreciate that but at the same time I don't think
2444.54s:  it at that way like I think of like that like this is what I do you know I mean like like I don't
2450.06s:  even like it doesn't even register with me you know it's like like I don't even there's
2456.06s:  something else I could do you know like I don't I don't have it like I'm like people I love when
2461.98s:  people's one of my favorite questions is when when I'm doing interview with somebody says hey like
2466.78s:  what are your hobbies and I go well I don't really have a hobby like like what do you mean everybody
2473.26s:  has a hobby and I'm like everybody but me I mean I go I don't even know what you mean like I don't
2478.70s:  really have a hobby you know like yeah you know I'm like hanging out with my friends and doing stuff
2483.34s:  and you know but but I don't really I don't really have a hobby you know I don't do anything you know
2489.02s:  this is what I do I built I build stuff like you know I work you know I love investing and building
2496.22s:  things and getting involved and all that kind of stuff speaking of investing and you said before
2502.86s:  that you kind of have most of what you want I actually wanted to push back on that because
2507.66s:  um I'm not sure if it's created yet but I saw an interview that you were talking about your
2513.42s:  newest venture in Chicago um which is your iced tea shop is that is that there yet or what's
2521.82s:  where are we at with that well actually I've invested in it's a little bit bigger than that
2527.66s:  um but the iced tea shop is my is is is kind of a front for it um you know it's it's crazy I love iced
2537.42s:  tea so and I've always wanted a place in my neighborhood this is not a this is not a like hey
2543.74s:  at Tom's gonna build 700 iced tea stores around the country you know and he's gonna own he's gonna
2549.26s:  own iced tea franchise that's that's not it um this has just been a um I've always wanted a place
2555.90s:  in my neighborhood where I could just walk to and hang out instead of like you know I don't want to
2561.58s:  sit in my house I live in the city there's a lot of people around you know I just want to a fun
2565.34s:  place where we go just hang out and like you know talk crap and you know meet you know meet friends I
2572.14s:  mean we always meet at different coffee shops you know me and my buddies and I'm thinking like hey
2576.86s:  you know let's take our own place you know we could afford it let's have some fun and uh um
2582.46s:  so that's it but it's actually part of a bigger project that um that I'm invested in with um
2588.62s:  with my son and um some of his buddies and it's it's a it's I'm not gonna get in the details but
2596.22s:  it's kind of like it's a it's an entertainment technology play kind of and um something you know
2601.98s:  I love helping those guys because they're young they're smart and I think I can even though they
2608.54s:  don't think I know anything I think I know some stuff so I think I can help them you know like with
2613.58s:  some ideas another thing that you've done that I'm actually very impressed by and I've learned a lot
2620.70s:  from it is you do not shy away from new stuff like you're not anti new technology some people get
2630.30s:  really entrenched in like what they use what they do what they like what they don't like and I found
2636.78s:  that really and again inspiring and I don't use that term lightly the fact that you purposely higher
2644.14s:  different generations from yourself to get different ideas to challenge the status quo you're
2649.10s:  doing things like getting involved in cryptocurrency you talk about that stuff even though a lot of
2655.10s:  older investors and traders say oh it's all bullshit you know it's all fake how have you cultivated
2661.10s:  that receptiveness to new ideas new technology because I think it's important and it's something
2666.78s:  that I'm trying to learn myself first of all I hang out with a lot of young kids um and I hire I
2674.30s:  try to hire crazy smart um you know people from all different generations but hopefully you know we
2681.66s:  get a lot of young people in here because I I need that that know how we have some older people some
2686.30s:  younger people's mill everything and I'm actually building an app right now for Tasty which I think
2695.02s:  is going to compete head on with we bull robin hood m1 and everybody else I'm building an app
2703.34s:  right now for Jen zeers that I think it's going to change the entire industry and it'll be out
2709.42s:  next year and I think it's going to be one of the coolest trading apps ever but the key to it is
2717.02s:  it is completely the opposite of every trading app ever built in that it preaches basically and
2725.18s:  you're going to think I'm crazy but I can explain it preaches hey this is an app for you to learn
2732.86s:  how to lose money yeah a lot of questions come up there I think I get it actually because
2739.42s:  I like that angle and I like the antithesis because if you learn how to lose money obviously you can
2745.02s:  learn to make money but um yeah why are we focusing on how to lose money there is I believe in life that
2755.02s:  the some of the most important things we can do to be successful is learn from our mistakes
2763.82s:  and learn from our losses and learn from our you know you even started to talk about it before like
2769.82s:  you know you like you can kind of tell the character of people and ideas from from think when things
2774.78s:  go bad when things go good everything's easy but when things go bad that's where you can tell hey
2780.94s:  this is this is the real champion you know this is and so I'm tired of of handle I think we try to
2787.98s:  handle like an entire young generation with kid gloves and say hey you know what when you're when
2793.02s:  you're 22 years old you're just graduating college or something like that hey you should be
2797.18s:  putting all your money into a 401k and IRA account so that in 40 years if you're still alive and we
2802.78s:  get to take 30 or 40 percent out in fees you might have something left you know and my my philosophy is
2809.18s:  hey fuck that we should be we should be in a situation where if I'm 22 years old hey Tom
2816.70s:  teach me to take risk teach me how to do like don't don't teach me how to play blackjack you know
2822.62s:  or poker I don't care teach me how to take real risk and I'm willing to lose and if I do lose
2829.58s:  I'm gonna gain something from it I'm gonna understand something and I'm sick of all the crazy
2836.38s:  apps like you know like acorn and stash and some robo advisor because you know you invest in those
2843.98s:  when you're 22 and you wake up 40 years later and you're 62 and you don't know anything right and
2850.70s:  and I don't think robin hood I don't think we bull I don't think I don't think you know all these
2856.06s:  other apps for millennials public whatever they are all the different ones they don't they don't do
2861.26s:  it either they don't understand nobody gets it this is about you know somebody has to introduce risk
2867.42s:  and and I feel like that's where that's that's my that's my domain crazy risk you know you'd be the
2876.06s:  person that teaches the teaches a generation how to take risk so that's what I'm working on right now
2882.62s:  that's actually really really cool I you know whenever you guys make some progress on it or you're
2887.18s:  ready to show some of that I would love to to look at that with you all because that's one of the
2891.90s:  things that I try to talk to my audience about specifically is having a trade log at least and
2897.82s:  you know I don't go super far with it and I know people like you that are literally doing hundreds
2901.74s:  of trades of day are not going to fill out a trade log but I do think at least having a way to
2907.26s:  review what we're doing to learn from it is where we gain most of the value so I literally love that
2913.18s:  you're creating something that's really predicated on it on achieving that so that and you know
2919.58s:  next time I'm in Chicago to get straight up disrespected by your winner I'll have to figure out
2924.14s:  where iced tea shop is and and try some iced tea because I do like an Arnold Palmer that's one of
2928.70s:  my favorites don't think you're getting an Arnold Palmer my iced tea shop there's no lemonade
2933.34s:  there when you're on lemonade actually there's a couple because it wouldn't be my shop if there
2938.94s:  wasn't a couple of gimmicks so there's a couple of gimmicks so so I can't tell you about the gimmicks
2944.06s:  on air because it's you're gonna have to go there fair enough well I'll also be ready to smuggle
2950.14s:  in some of my own lemonade if I have to I know you won't have to we'll have other stuff don't you
2955.02s:  worry about it but Tom we're at time and like I said I really respect you carving out an
2961.18s:  opportunity to chat with us so thank you so much for hanging out I'll drop all the links to
2964.86s:  TC trade TC works all the stuff that you guys are doing in the video description below unless
2968.54s:  there's anywhere else that you want to specifically let people know where they can get a hold of you
