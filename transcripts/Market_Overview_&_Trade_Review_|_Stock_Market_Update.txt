0.68s: what's up outliers happy Monday no
3.24s: trading today except for some Futures
5.32s: action and even that's been uh really
7.32s: really slow the goal for the video today
9.92s: is to do a little bit of a look ahead on
12.60s: the market what's coming up and just
14.64s: what the market looks like it's setting
15.96s: up as for the week how I'm thinking
17.68s: about it at least and then I want to
19.60s: walk you through four of my recent
21.80s: trades just to give you an idea of some
23.36s: of the things that I'm looking at why
25.40s: I'm looking at them and how I'm fitting
26.92s: them into the portfolio so that's the
29.32s: agenda I do want to start with this what
31.16s: you see in front of you here for those
33.12s: that are familiar with the channel you
34.24s: know that I have a stats background and
36.32s: I really enjoy conducting data analysis
39.36s: it's sounds kind of weird to say that
41.40s: out loud it makes me sad for myself to a
43.36s: degree but I genuinely do find this
45.24s: stuff interesting I actually couldn't
46.68s: tell you why and what I took a look at
50.52s: here is analyzing the average weekly
54.24s: return in spy for the past 15 years and
57.56s: I compared it versus a short and I
60.00s: labeled it long but that's a standard
61.80s: trading week so short is essentially if
64.08s: there's at least one day closed of the
66.80s: market so this week Monday closed if
68.88s: it's Monday Tuesday closed that would
70.28s: still fall into short and then long is
72.80s: just standard so Monday through Friday
74.44s: markets open and couple things jumped
77.56s: out of me here the first thing is I
78.96s: actually thought both of these would be
80.64s: a little bit larger in terms of severity
83.68s: and this highlighted a really
85.92s: interesting change in Paradigm that I'm
89.24s: not used to seeing
90.52s: and it's because if you think about it
92.36s: in the last 15 years rather than that
94.76s: 15year period essentially being kicked
97.08s: off by a bare Market 2007 2008 2009 kind
101.16s: of like that time frame that then just
103.04s: turned into a progressive non-stop bull
105.32s: market it's actually a different snap
107.52s: shot now when we look at this stuff and
108.96s: it's pretty cool because we've had two
111.92s: bare markets we've had one in 2020 when
115.96s: we saw that covid crash and even though
118.48s: that was a quick bare Market that ended
120.48s: up being a positive year it still was a
122.56s: bare market for like 3 days and then the
125.60s: second was in 2022 when the market was
128.04s: down like
129.48s: 19.4% that was a a really interesting
131.84s: year so that starts to change a little
134.32s: bit of the data that we'll pick up and
136.84s: it's actually kind of cool to see that
138.84s: because again this is looking at weekly
140.44s: snapshots so as we go through that covid
142.88s: crash this does have an impact and with
146.76s: two bare markets in those time frames we
148.80s: know markets tend to crash down and then
152.00s: take the stairs up elevator down stairs
153.72s: up is the common saying so this will
155.60s: impact data sets like this I highlight
157.72s: this for you because even if you don't
160.36s: choose to do this kind of data if it
162.04s: doesn't you know tickle or fancy like it
164.24s: does for me when you're receiving this
166.64s: information you should have that context
169.00s: because a lot of people do really
170.72s: terrible data analysis in my opinion
172.88s: where we're trying to essentially look
174.76s: for what we want to find not what's
176.80s: there and it can really skew our
179.04s: perception so anyway that's the first
180.52s: observation that both of these were
182.88s: smaller in terms of severity than I
184.88s: thought the second thing I thought was
186.84s: interesting is if we take a look again
189.48s: from a stats perspective you don't know
191.56s: what these uh black bars are it's kind
193.48s: of like a standard error bar it's almost
195.12s: like a candle right it's almost like
196.72s: high low it just shows you standard
198.68s: deviation how much deviation from this
200.92s: average is there based on the period
202.80s: that we look at and we can see that
204.80s: standard trading weeks definitely have
206.44s: longer tails to the downside and
208.20s: slightly shorter tails to the upside
210.36s: and we can also see that short trading
212.08s: weeks again where at least one day is
214.20s: closed if not more during the trading
216.08s: week that we have a a pretty significant
218.84s: multiple higher again still very small
221.80s: we're into three decimal points for this
224.16s: to even become relevant so technically
226.32s: speaking from a statistical perspective
228.48s: I would actually call this kind of thing
230.36s: insignificant it's just based on the
232.24s: scale it looks bigger than it is what
236.60s: what I tell my wife but when I look at
239.60s: this
240.80s: um it's I find it interesting because
243.00s: obviously I can see artifacts of
244.52s: positive drift I can see that being
246.28s: Amplified slightly during short trading
248.04s: weeks and for those that enjoy trading
250.16s: things like volatility and whatnot this
252.00s: is actually quite interesting because
254.00s: trading volatility over long weekends is
255.92s: quite lucrative and that's actually not
257.92s: one of the trades I'm going to talk
258.96s: about today but something to be aware of
261.44s: for my options trading people all right
264.48s: well that aside let's take a look at the
266.00s: market what's going on here so we still
268.36s: have this very interesting series of
271.04s: patterns and I'm specifically talking
272.72s: about the top three that you see here so
275.48s: spy QQQ iwm the reason why these are
278.40s: interesting is if we take a look at even
281.28s: these standard deviation channels
283.04s: they're completely different slopes for
284.56s: the same time frame the slope that you
286.80s: see for iwm is much steeper than what
289.08s: you see in spy although both are
290.96s: positive sloping and q's is actually
292.64s: negative sloping this does not look good
295.64s: for Tech in my opinion now what this
298.68s: turns into I also have no idea but one
301.72s: of the things that really surprised me
303.88s: is when we had Nvidia report earnings it
305.96s: was an insanely solid earnings but it
308.04s: wasn't Perfect by the market standards
310.20s: or expectations I should say and Nvidia
313.16s: sold off a bit so some of that could be
316.80s: short-term price extremes based on again
319.84s: these different perceptions that will
321.56s: take a little while to price in but I
324.12s: have to be honest as I look at this I am
327.28s: surprised to see Tech trailing down like
330.40s: this I really am now hopefully this is
332.80s: just a consolidation period I say
334.56s: hopefully because I want to trade Tech
336.08s: it can be so explosive to the upside and
338.48s: I'm also trying to rotate out of a tle
340.40s: q's position that I have that looks good
342.84s: but I still have to wait uh like two
344.32s: more weeks for these short calls to make
346.36s: up their mind where either I can take
347.52s: them down at a profit or not but they've
349.04s: been underwater for a while underwater
350.72s: meaning that the trade's profitable but
352.80s: the short calls have been in the money
354.64s: now they're like right at the money so
357.20s: I'm waiting for that so this actually
359.28s: bod well for that trade specifically but
361.72s: I would much rather Trade Tech to the
363.16s: upside because I've been using leveraged
365.08s: products whether it's t Q's or again my
367.04s: intent is to rotate into Futures at this
369.92s: point because I think these kind of like
371.80s: big severe moves seem to be slowing down
375.32s: in this case now I'm waiting now this is
379.92s: not where I would put on new trades in
381.60s: Tech if as a Trader right like is a
384.72s: investor this actually looks kind of
386.24s: good A little bit of a value area but
388.36s: from a trading perspective I would want
390.48s: it to be moving in my direction and in
392.36s: this case it is clearly not doing that
394.16s: it's just kind of you know trending
395.72s: sideways here which is fine but
397.92s: something to keep an eye on now this
400.20s: move in the Russell has been interesting
402.84s: because we can see that it's sort of
405.12s: starting to catch up with where spy is
407.84s: but it's still trailing so if we take a
410.04s: look at this the term highs on this
411.96s: three-month chart in spy are 565 against
414.12s: 563 we are essentially back at highs in
417.68s: the Spy not not so in iwm but we're not
422.44s: that far off so the term High here is
425.80s: 228 and we're at 220 so still not an
429.20s: insignificant Gap off of that high but
431.88s: we're moving closer into this general
433.76s: area of congestion before we hit that
435.56s: Peak so takeaway from my perspective
439.84s: here's what I'm seeing first thing spy
442.40s: Varian risk premiums do not look good
444.64s: they haven't looked good for a few weeks
447.04s: now which is again you can't trade off
449.76s: of this directly because on different
451.88s: time frames it can still look good so
453.72s: actually zero DTE have been running
456.28s: pretty healthy remember this is looking
458.76s: at 30-day VA now that's one observation
463.52s: spy starting to consolidate second
466.00s: observation I think that it's likely for
469.04s: us to continue trending sideways here
471.32s: until we see some sort of next news
474.44s: event whatever that looks like whether
477.00s: that's the FED reaffirming more the rate
480.04s: cut although I am starting to believe
482.52s: most of this initial cut is going to be
485.04s: priced in already and I think that's
486.76s: part of the reason why we saw iwm start
488.80s: to Rally but at this point I think we
491.68s: need a new Catalyst whatever that is but
495.00s: status quo will be not really held for
498.24s: very long because as you'll see in a
499.60s: little bit we have some events coming up
501.36s: this week QQQ this just looks honestly
505.68s: like I said ugly to me all of these
507.44s: moving averages are getting super super
509.48s: Ed Price is kind of rotating through
512.00s: some of the shorter term moving averages
513.72s: consolidating on the longer it's below
516.00s: the 3mon point of control which I don't
517.88s: love and if we look on a six-month we
519.88s: still have a giant Gap so on longer time
523.36s: frames this still looks really good but
525.00s: on a shorter term time frame it doesn't
526.76s: quite look as appealing to me so this to
530.20s: me is kind of in a holding pattern this
532.52s: is something I would trade either still
535.00s: slightly directionally bullish but
537.12s: expect to manage the downside quickly or
540.00s: trade it sideways and then I'm waiting
542.44s: for a breakout so as soon as we start
544.52s: seeing stuff cracking above 484 starts
547.80s: to look interesting to me 478 would be
550.72s: the first threshold we got to get above
552.72s: which is the point of control then
554.44s: near-term highs here so that we can
556.44s: continue this progression because there
557.76s: is a positive the positive is
560.88s: although we have not hit a higher high
565.08s: we have hit a higher low so far so
568.68s: that's still is a general consolidation
571.16s: pattern as far as I'm concerned right so
573.44s: we can see that higher higher here we're
575.96s: not there yet but you don't always have
578.08s: to run right up to this higher high it's
580.52s: common right so if you look at this we
582.36s: have this um higher high relative to the
585.40s: time frame before then we have a low
587.68s: higher high a low a higher this is a
590.44s: lower high than here that then came down
593.92s: and then rallied back up so this in and
596.44s: of itself doesn't necessarily B bearish
599.48s: in my opinion but it bodess watch versus
603.04s: super bearish or bullish either really I
606.24s: need to see what it does and then small
608.72s: caps I still feel bullish in I'm
611.40s: surprised that they're lagging as they
613.60s: are but they are I see net highs lows in
616.64s: the New York Stock Exchange still looks
618.60s: really really solid so yeah this one I
622.80s: can't help but find slightly curious
625.80s: that it's moving the way it is I I would
627.76s: expect this to be driving a little bit
630.04s: more now let's take a quick look across
633.20s: the
634.80s: sectors and take a look at this we see
639.44s: xlb crushing it we see XLF crushing it
643.20s: we see xli crushing it xlp is doing well
647.16s: starting to consolidate but still doing
649.00s: well same thing for xlre starting to
651.28s: consolidate but hanging right at highs
653.28s: xlu XLV what I find fascinating here is
656.44s: for so long for so long when we look at
660.36s: technology that was propping up the S&P
662.76s: 500 now we have the negative momentum in
666.36s: the uh in Tech being negated by all of
671.04s: these other sectors that are actually
673.52s: driving this performance within the S&P
675.68s: 500 so there's internal Divergence we're
678.08s: not seeing participation across all the
680.12s: sectors across the board which is again
681.84s: fairly normal but it means that I would
685.84s: be a little selective with where I'm
687.84s: putting my money as I am right now so I
690.64s: have long exposure in S&P futures but I
694.96s: don't have it right now in small caps
697.80s: and I even though I like that trade and
699.44s: I don't have it right now in the cues
703.16s: although again I'm waiting because I
704.76s: want to established there but I want to
706.48s: unwind this tle Q's position first so
710.36s: that's a quick look across the different
712.60s: sectors like I said during the live
714.12s: stream later today we'll go through some
715.48s: scans and see what kind of interesting
717.56s: trades and stuff like that we can find
719.08s: but wanted to take a look at this
720.48s: quickly with you now the other thing I
724.08s: want to run through is what we have
726.92s: coming up for the week ahead so I'm just
730.16s: going to update this to be this week and
733.04s: then we'll see what's on the docket so
736.88s: again we're starting with some important
740.36s: metrics that really pertain to inflation
743.72s: manufacturing prices PMI Global
746.76s: manufacturing PMI these as per usual ual
749.48s: will be interpreted in the lens of
751.72s: inflation and impact of inflation so
755.20s: this is something I keep an eye on
757.32s: because if there's some big uh news that
760.48s: breaks from these it has an overwhelming
763.08s: probability of moving the market then as
766.80s: I look across the fourth big things I
769.36s: see here job openings and then I like
772.48s: the beige book just to read through it
774.16s: but it's not anything that I think is
775.92s: going to be ultra Market moving as of
778.44s: right now now the two thing I do want to
781.20s: highlight though is the job openings
782.80s: here and non-farm employment change and
786.36s: jobless claims I think these actually
788.80s: are going to be really really emphasized
792.24s: this coming week because of the revision
794.32s: we recently saw so the market I think is
797.32s: very interested in these metrics and to
800.44s: see like how they're moving after the
802.48s: previous revision so two of those are on
805.64s: the fifth here then also on the fifth we
809.12s: we have Services PMI and then the
812.48s: composite which again inflation level
814.40s: metrics those are going to be
816.16s: interpreted in that lens the fifth has a
818.32s: ton of stuff coming out so it also is
820.20s: coming from ISM in addition to
823.04s: S&P then on the
827.20s: 6th we have unemployment rate same thing
830.48s: kind of what I was referencing before
832.52s: non-farm payroll so again just this
834.36s: employment stuff I think will be
835.52s: interpreted in the lens of the recent
837.84s: revision and that looks mostly it so if
841.88s: we take a look out of curiosity how the
845.04s: market feels about that this week let's
847.80s: take a peek we'll grab
850.44s: SPX and let's take a look at the
853.08s: volatility that we're seeing across this
855.52s: week so I'll open this one up the reason
858.08s: why I open this one up is because it
859.36s: helps me just clearly see where the vs
861.40s: are so we can see Tuesday a little bit
864.52s: higher Wednesday lower Thursday lower
867.36s: and then Friday is a bit of a peak so
871.24s: the stuff that we have coming out on 6p
873.40s: is actually being priced in a little
875.68s: heavier for the market based on what we
877.80s: can see up front this is one way I like
879.56s: to look at that which is just super fast
881.76s: the other way you can look at this exact
883.20s: thing is if you look at the implied
884.44s: volatility here I would want the out of
886.32s: the monies I would kill all these other
888.76s: series and I would just look at this
889.96s: week and I can see the same exact thing
891.80s: as I do up above but it's just a little
894.64s: bit of a a quicker quicker view in my
897.16s: opinion but this is another way you can
898.40s: look at that
899.60s: so yeah that's what the Market's looking
901.36s: like now I wanted to talk to you about a
902.92s: few trades that I have on and had on so
906.56s: one of them actually is in NM and this
909.36s: is on the 27th of Aug I opened an 18 o
913.84s: 50 put for $116 per lot I'm just quoting
917.68s: these in single Lots because the number
919.28s: of lots doesn't really change anything
921.16s: about the tradeit other than um the size
924.00s: right but the way I'm thinking about it
925.64s: the analysis all that stuff is the same
928.08s: so typically when quoting these trades
929.84s: unless I'm doing like a specific trade
931.44s: review where I'll go through the sizing
933.36s: and the methodology there for these I'm
935.24s: just quoting in one Lots but none of
936.88s: them are now for NM the reason for the
941.32s: short putut was when I saw the market
945.68s: kind of rallying up here it looked like
947.80s: it was starting to consolidate so I put
950.00s: it on in this period here and I just had
952.48s: a really tight stop now this
956.36s: is a little bit of a a two-prong trade
959.96s: because you'll actually notice that V is
961.72s: relatively low but even though V is low
965.28s: risk premiums are not risk premiums look
968.68s: pretty good here they're converging a
970.52s: little bit but you can see when I put
972.28s: the trade on risk premiums actually were
973.96s: quite healthy so this is a little bit of
976.96s: a putc style trade and it's also gaining
980.40s: me exposure to the energy sector which
983.60s: right now has been performing a little
985.40s: bit better than some of the other
986.76s: sectors so that's the idea behind behind
989.32s: this one and it's I think they're
992.04s: trading for like 80 cents or something
993.48s: like that right now so I'll give it a
994.84s: little bit longer but I'm essentially
996.88s: just slowly moving my stop up this was
999.32s: my original soft stop now this is my
1001.80s: soft stop and I just kind of Ratchet it
1003.96s: up slowly slowly slowly and we'll see
1006.84s: but this is just benefiting from the
1008.24s: passage of time this fits into the
1009.68s: portfolio for a million different
1011.16s: reasons it's giving me positive Theta
1013.92s: I'm not expecting necessarily rockar
1016.44s: movement from this at this point cuz
1017.92s: it's already had a mass massive massive
1019.52s: run I've traded this before you can see
1021.68s: these other little
1023.12s: highlights that I have from previous
1025.48s: positions that I've put on in here so
1027.40s: this is just kind of going back to the
1028.72s: well but I'm establishing a slightly
1030.80s: different position in here just to to
1032.60s: fit the portfolio well so that's pretty
1034.68s: much it there now the other trade I
1036.76s: wanted to talk about is ests because
1039.24s: this is an example where I did actually
1043.00s: sell a put spread and the reason why I
1046.92s: sold a put spread is because is rather
1049.64s: than worrying about stopping out on the
1051.60s: trade or setting some sort of stop for
1053.32s: something like this that has pretty high
1056.28s: movement right so if we look at the 5day
1058.24s: movement average 5 days is 12% then if
1061.48s: we look at the 20-day it's 177% so the
1064.24s: probability of getting stopped out in
1065.76s: something like this is really high for
1068.80s: the way that I would trade so here
1072.00s: essentially I was able to put on a 20
1074.64s: September 2928 put credit spread for 40
1078.08s: so it's a dollar w
1079.80s: and the reason why I stuck with the
1081.88s: dollar wide versus widening them out is
1085.20s: because of the edge I was able to derive
1088.00s: from this because for a dollar wide
1089.64s: credit spread neutral based on you know
1092.40s: standard 30 Delta short put would be 33
1095.96s: cents is what I would need for like a
1097.52s: for a neutrally expectant put credit
1100.84s: spread so here is was able to get 40
1102.56s: cents and when I Mo modeled the $2 wide
1106.28s: the $5 wide it didn't have the same Edge
1109.16s: that these did at the time that I put
1110.60s: the trade on on the 27th so just let
1113.32s: this baby ride these are underwater
1115.04s: right now so you can see that I put them
1118.12s: on
1119.96s: here and they still would be a profit if
1123.32s: we hang out here but if we continue
1124.88s: lower then that would be no good for
1127.84s: them but don't really care because again
1130.60s: the these are spreads so I just leave
1132.40s: them set them forget it they'll either
1134.04s: work or they don't work that's all there
1135.44s: is to it the other one I want to talk
1138.96s: about is GIS and this is just because
1141.92s: this thing has been popping up on a
1143.52s: million of my scanners it's showing a
1145.64s: ton of strength so here on the 27th I
1150.32s: ended up selling the 20 September 70
1153.32s: puts for 98 so that's right in here and
1158.44s: same thing you can see these I don't
1159.76s: even have a stop on because it
1161.92s: essentially has been popping up on my
1163.36s: alerts but as I look at that trade and
1166.04s: where we are now I essentially would
1168.92s: look at something below this level as my
1174.60s: soft stop so kind of when I would first
1176.52s: want to hear about it and then these
1180.68s: again just another way you'll notice
1183.48s: most of these are selling strategies
1185.16s: it's because the portfolio needed a
1187.36s: bunch of these to offset some of the
1188.84s: other positions and overall Theta and
1191.52s: then the last one here is already up and
1193.12s: down so this trade is down but it's nkla
1197.52s: you can see the same levels I've had on
1200.00s: I've traded this for Varian premiums now
1202.92s: essentially for three months I've been
1205.76s: trading them so these have been just
1208.56s: really really really solid and here I
1210.72s: had short strangles in 20 step it was
1213.24s: the nine and the six and yeah I mean
1216.48s: they're paying really healthy premiums
1219.20s: even though the implied volatility
1220.56s: percentile is low still this is another
1222.96s: example again where the varen premiums
1224.96s: are super solid so you can see how I've
1228.44s: been trading it all in here and V has
1231.20s: just been trending pretty consistently
1234.04s: right above what we're seeing for
1235.80s: implied so just a few things that I've
1237.56s: been doing these are all speculative
1239.40s: allocation of the portfolio smaller
1241.20s: trades and then the core allocation is
1244.20s: still kind of in what I was reviewing
1246.32s: earlier so yeah again I don't talk too
1248.92s: much about what I'm doing all the time
1250.48s: just because I don't necessarily think
1252.48s: it's really pertinent to people because
1254.72s: what I do is what I do but I also know
1256.88s: that sometimes people will reach out and
1258.32s: ask me me like what I'm doing how I'm
1259.80s: looking at the market so I totally get
1261.16s: that and I'm happy to accommodate and
1262.56s: you know wrap it up into stuff like this
1264.68s: so as always if you have any questions
1266.28s: let me know I hope we have an absolutely
1268.12s: awesome week ahead I'll see you all
1269.52s: during the live streams we got a bunch
1270.88s: of them be an outlier I'll see you guys
1273.00s: later
