0.00s:  Boom, we're alive, we're back, we got to figure it out.
3.84s:  I'm going to tell you, man, I got to get a little better at figuring out these stream
9.06s:  launches.
10.06s:  Every time it's kind of like just seeing if I can get us off the launch pad and so far,
15.68s:  I feel like we have a decent track record, I suppose.
19.92s:  But yeah, you know, what else am I supposed to do here?
24.92s:  I'm just out here doing my best.
28.92s:  This is an old video for you.
34.12s:  I have the swap video set up or if we need to reference that at all.
39.48s:  But yeah, man, first off, welcome back.
43.08s:  I'm actually really glad that we're kind of starting to do these regularly because one,
49.72s:  it gives me a chance to continue learning from the master, which I literally love doing.
55.04s:  And two, it gives everybody else a chance to kind of catch these periodic updates, right?
60.96s:  Like as we're going through and seeing things unfold.
64.56s:  So welcome back, stoked to have you.
67.12s:  Yeah, thanks, Eric.
68.12s:  Really appreciate it.
69.12s:  And I, I think you said it really well.
70.76s:  Like these updates are really good.
72.24s:  I realized, you know, I have a habit of just doing a video every day with like what's
75.88s:  on my mind.
76.88s:  It's almost like stream of consciousness.
79.08s:  But maybe by breaking it up every week with like, hey, we've gone through another week
82.36s:  now since huge events in May and June in kind of like this quiet period where the stocks
88.04s:  like kind of edging its way up.
90.32s:  Everyone's looking for options activity.
92.08s:  It's like, what's the story at right now?
95.56s:  You know, what can we look forward to?
97.20s:  What's the summary for the week?
98.48s:  So I think it's good to do videos like this or, you know, yeah, man, kind of seconds like
102.76s:  this.
103.76s:  I absolutely love it.
104.76s:  So right now for everybody's awareness, it looks like we have like 150 people on great
110.72s:  to see everybody.
111.72s:  They're coming to hang out and chat some game stop with us.
118.56s:  So far, I'm not able to log into my platform.
121.76s:  So we'll have to use some other tools when we want to start taking a look at some details.
127.52s:  But that future us problem, you know, there's only so many things you can worry about at a
131.84s:  given point in time.
132.84s:  This is not one of them.
133.84s:  So I figured a great starting point here is to lay a little more foundation on some of
141.36s:  the components that make this thing tick the way it does.
145.36s:  So last time we were talking about some of these different settlement rules, how they
150.00s:  apply and how they interact with one another.
152.80s:  Do you want to kind of provide a quick rundown of those to lay some of a foundation?
158.12s:  And the reason for everybody else's awareness that's kind of learning more about the story
163.24s:  or already aware of the story, but curious why this matters.
166.44s:  Because when we're trying to think about the way that the product moves, a lot of the
172.12s:  reason why it moves the way it does is because of these forces and these rule sets that
178.64s:  underpin things.
180.16s:  It's why whenever I'm doing videos and you know talking about game stop, I'm always
184.20s:  very careful to say like standard technical analysis in my opinion doesn't translate
189.04s:  well to something like game stop.
191.44s:  And a lot of that has to do with the fact that there are all these other injects that
196.80s:  absolutely have a dominating effect on price and volume.
201.28s:  So yeah, I'd love to start with an assessment slash just general overview of these settlement
207.60s:  rules.
208.60s:  Yeah, do you want me to go ahead and share my screen?
210.88s:  Is that cool?
211.88s:  I would love that.
212.88s:  Honestly, just because I hate seeing my big fat face.
214.96s:  So whenever we do that, yeah, it gets me, that's beautiful.
218.36s:  It just gets me right out of there.
220.08s:  Perfect.
221.08s:  Everybody.
222.08s:  Exactly.
223.08s:  Same here.
224.08s:  So I think you laid the groundwork pretty well.
226.00s:  I think that with other stocks, you probably wouldn't be ultra concerned about settlement
231.28s:  because liquidity is pretty robust.
233.60s:  You know, you're going to have lots of buying and selling on the stock.
236.48s:  I think with something like game stop, the fundamental problem here is liquidity.
240.32s:  With so many shares being dominated by household, especially in periods like right now, you
245.80s:  can see tremendous volume.
247.28s:  But where are the market makers and the broker dealers going to go to get shares?
251.52s:  You know, if they don't, if they don't have inventory, they're going to need to push all
254.80s:  the rules to the maximum.
256.00s:  So we need to know how the rules work to get an understanding of why we see volume happen
261.00s:  on particular days.
262.00s:  You know, days where we consider nothing's going on.
264.52s:  There's nothing going on the stock.
265.68s:  Why would it suddenly have 100 million volume?
268.92s:  Why would the price suddenly go up 5% here?
271.76s:  800% there.
273.28s:  You know, so that's where the rules become really important.
275.96s:  So I made a tab here on the sheet.
277.92s:  It's the third tab over.
278.92s:  I actually combined the two tabs before into one tab.
282.96s:  So I've got all the rules for settlement here.
285.40s:  I'll make this really big over here on the left.
287.96s:  So under regulation, SHO, this is the settlement rules.
292.00s:  We just recently moved into a T plus one settlement period.
294.56s:  That means that, you know, I buy a stock today.
297.16s:  It should be settled into my account by tomorrow, sending with cash.
300.04s:  If I move cash from my Bank of America account into my trading platform to take one data
305.74s:  seven ounce at a two, which is great.
308.64s:  Supposedly, my understanding is options contracts still take two days to settle.
312.48s:  Do you know if that's the case?
314.36s:  I think it is.
315.52s:  I think so too.
316.52s:  Yeah.
317.52s:  So right now, they're aligning off of the same settlement period.
321.44s:  So I think that that's, I think it's two T plus one now, no?
325.88s:  I think because it's a contract, not an actual equity.
329.12s:  I think it's still on T plus two, but I might be mistaken on this.
332.24s:  So that's a curiosity.
334.32s:  The chat, the chat might know.
336.56s:  And I also think I have a download of the actual release.
342.72s:  So let me dig that up in the meantime.
345.04s:  Sure.
346.04s:  But, you know, under regulation, SHO or Reg show for short, there's two particular rules
351.68s:  that are really of interest.
352.68s:  Rule 203 and Rule 204.
355.16s:  They allow market makers to fail to deliver trades after T plus three and T plus six.
360.56s:  And we can actually see that in action on the stock.
363.44s:  What's really hard here, and I think that there's a lot of people that get frustrated
366.64s:  on the forums because people are really caught up right now on roaring kiddies by a four
371.04s:  million shares.
372.20s:  But there's a reason to be caught up on that trade.
374.48s:  That's a huge trade, right?
376.44s:  And we get precious few moments in time where we get to see a huge trade and know when
380.76s:  it's going to be.
382.76s:  Ryan Cohen bought in in 2020.
388.20s:  So we actually have his trade dates from his disclosures.
392.88s:  And so we can actually see a rule happening here, which is he bought on December.
402.08s:  Right here, he bought on December 17th, quite a few shares across four days.
407.60s:  But you don't see gigantic price improvement until T plus three, especially like basically.
412.08s:  So you can actually see that happen in real time here.
414.88s:  That's why people are still curious about roaring kiddies purchases.
418.36s:  Not only do they match the size of Ryan Cohen's from back in 2020, but it gives us dates
423.64s:  through which to follow to see if the rules pan out the way we expect them to.
427.36s:  But the one of interest is Rule 204.
430.12s:  They grants calendar days plus 25.
432.72s:  And so down here, I basically mapped this out.
434.52s:  You can see like, let's say you've got a trading date like December 22nd.
438.80s:  The market maker should clear those trades by C plus three or two plus six.
443.00s:  So those are trading days, so in days, but the calendar days include the weekends, but
449.80s:  not market holidays.
451.52s:  So then you want to count those out 35 and they absolutely have to close out by C plus 35.
458.32s:  If you want to call it C plus 35.
460.20s:  So that's basically how all those rules work.
463.60s:  It's just what people are looking for now is, okay, so we know a big trade happened
469.04s:  probably.
470.12s:  You can tell me what you think about this.
471.28s:  I think he sold his options on the 12th and then bought the shares the following day
478.80s:  on the 13th or sold most of the options like 80,000 of them here and then 40,000 more
484.80s:  sold those there and then bought all the shares.
487.60s:  So what everyone wants to know is are we going to see?
491.32s:  Because we didn't really see T plus three or T plus six produce very much.
494.80s:  There is volume, but not a lot of price improvement.
497.92s:  So are we going to see something on 35 calendar days, which is basically going to be somewhere
503.44s:  out here in the days to come?
506.68s:  So does that give people a good enough idea on how settlement should work?
510.32s:  Is that pretty clear?
511.32s:  Yeah, yeah, that's super helpful.
513.48s:  And I think that it paints a really important picture on why it matters, right?
519.72s:  Because there's a lot of different perceptions of what it looks like and also, by the way,
524.76s:  for option, it is T plus one.
528.04s:  Yeah, so I grabbed, I threw a link in the chat for everybody.
534.40s:  It's from the SEC and the Bolton's from 27 March and starting, I think it's 28 May,
542.76s:  if I'm not mistaken.
544.08s:  Yeah, 28 May, they switched over to T plus one.
547.76s:  I'll try to remember to add a point to do list.
551.56s:  Grab that link and just, I ended up starting linking everything on the sheet so people
556.96s:  could just find us.
557.96s:  I'll just link.
558.96s:  That's sweet.
559.96s:  And I'll throw it in the chat here too.
562.28s:  All right, thanks.
564.28s:  Yeah, man.
565.52s:  So the hard part with calendar days is people forget about the market holidays.
571.40s:  So this is a really good example to give because there are market holidays on this one.
575.24s:  So let's say, Rory and Kitty did buy, and I think it's pretty obvious he bought on the
579.52s:  13th because that's when he was doing the Sanworm, Dune meme, right?
584.96s:  He posted the Dune meme on Twitter and then the stock start rising immediately.
590.68s:  It's like who just bought a whole bunch of shares pretty obvious.
594.08s:  So what we want to do is we want to look at what I do is I just actually pull up a calendar.
600.44s:  So if I look at June 13th, you guys could all do this right now if you're following
603.48s:  the one.
604.48s:  June 13th, that was a Thursday.
606.68s:  Then you go out five weeks.
608.00s:  So one, two, three, four, five should be the 11th, right?
613.44s:  Is that right?
615.24s:  Let me try this again.
617.40s:  June 13th.
618.80s:  There'd be the 27th, the 27th, oh, sorry.
623.04s:  And then we're going to go the 18th, right?
627.04s:  The 18th, yeah.
628.04s:  All right.
629.04s:  So yeah, that'll be, it should be 25 days though on here trading days.
634.52s:  So now the way to do it.
636.28s:  From here.
641.52s:  No, so that's not a good way to do it.
643.68s:  So you want to go for it?
645.64s:  We have to add another column in here for you, like between AMB that auto populates it for you.
651.28s:  I've always thought about doing that.
652.96s:  I'm just like, that's going to be such a nightmare to actually add onto the sheet though,
657.36s:  because you'd have to go back and do so much.
662.04s:  Oh, I see.
663.04s:  I was just like, it insert it and then have it calculate X number of trading days from
667.12s:  whatever your trigger date is.
668.88s:  Right.
669.88s:  But it's tricky because, like, if this is the day, right?
673.08s:  So I've got it highlighted now.
674.12s:  Here's the trade date.
676.08s:  Here's when calendar days plus 35 is, however, there were two holidays between there and
683.88s:  there, right?
685.08s:  And those don't count.
687.56s:  So you got to actually add two more days.
689.64s:  So like, yeah.
691.12s:  I would going to be tricky.
693.12s:  Yeah.
694.12s:  I'm almost, well, I don't know about Google Sheets, but I'm almost positive that you could
699.76s:  import like an actual trading day function.
702.92s:  Right.
703.92s:  Yeah.
704.92s:  So, so basically everyone's looking at a bunch of days in the time to come.
709.44s:  It really matters though, because maybe to get to one of the other topics you want to
713.36s:  talk about is we have incredible options interest on July 19th, right?
719.76s:  So if though, if this trade still needs to be settled and is possibly going to be occurring
728.08s:  sometime before the 22nd, then that means the 19th is a really interesting day, right?
732.64s:  We're seeing lots of options interest there.
734.56s:  So do you want to maybe talk about that a little bit?
736.76s:  Yeah.
737.76s:  I wish, I wish the platform was up and running so that I can like walk people through it.
744.28s:  I'm trying to think of the easiest way to show you guys this because there's a lot of
749.04s:  things that I would try to show you.
751.64s:  Maybe let me see if the platform comes up in a little bit and then we can pivot back
755.52s:  over to the options.
756.52s:  I'm hopeful that maybe they're just updating it and it'll come back up in a little bit.
762.24s:  This is like easy to look at just cursory, right?
765.40s:  This experience just happened.
766.76s:  Yeah.
767.76s:  A lot of calls expired in the money, which is wonderful for the stock.
771.24s:  If you're long on it, should produce lots of buying.
773.96s:  This is next week.
775.56s:  And this is like something like 40% of the OI going forward, all concentrated on the
781.80s:  third week, a third Friday of July.
784.28s:  Yeah.
785.28s:  And again, none of this is financial advice.
788.48s:  You know, that's a near-dated option that's extremely risky.
791.80s:  But there's a lot of people front-loading options into next week.
795.44s:  So I'm curious what you think about this because this seems unusual to me.
800.28s:  I think, well, which part seems unusual to you?
804.36s:  Just to have such a concentration here with such a near-term expiry.
813.16s:  That's essentially been the standard so far for GameStop hands down.
818.12s:  Okay.
819.12s:  Yeah.
820.12s:  So what you'll find in general in most products is the front standard explorations are almost
826.92s:  always the busiest.
829.04s:  And then there can be pockets further out of other things that are showing activity.
836.16s:  But the vast majority of instances, you'll see the overwhelming activity in the front
842.44s:  explorations.
843.44s:  Now, what I find so fascinating about GameStop's options in particular, though, is the variance.
852.00s:  That part is very interesting.
855.40s:  Where you can see the options chain.
858.20s:  Actually, if you go back to that other screen.
862.40s:  Well, I liked it background.
866.84s:  Yeah.
869.44s:  So you can eyeball this and you can see inherently where the standard explorations are.
875.84s:  Just look at the numbers that are much higher than the, exactly.
881.28s:  You can straight up eyeball it.
883.32s:  Now, one of the things that's so interesting about GameStop, though, is the variance between
890.96s:  further out explorations and closer ones.
893.92s:  Because to your point, your eyeball of seeing like heavy near-term volume or OI in the
901.20s:  option space, that's, it's not inherently anomalous.
904.84s:  That's pretty normal.
906.00s:  But what is fairly anomalous is how big it is comparatively front versus further out.
913.28s:  But, I've noticed that essentially being like a rolling trend with GameStop.
919.40s:  It's actually been one of the most interesting things about the product to me is like, I've
924.76s:  talked about the way that I buy options typically.
927.48s:  I've shared a video a million times.
930.72s:  I'll share it again.
931.72s:  And it's because I think a lot of people light money on fire with the way that they buy
937.20s:  options trying to trade something like GameStop.
940.12s:  And specifically here, what confounds me is going so short term perpetually.
945.20s:  Because those options are going to decay the fastest.
948.48s:  And they will experience more of a move if you do eventually get a move in your favor.
954.92s:  But if you don't, they decay pretty fast.
958.36s:  So yeah, the kind of a meandering answer.
962.88s:  The short one is seeing the active options being really focused in these near-term
968.80s:  explorations that doesn't surprise me.
971.36s:  Seeing it centralized in 19 July doesn't surprise me because that's a standard expiration.
977.72s:  And the thing that does interest me though is just how big of a variance there is between
985.16s:  the front explorations and then like the next month expiration.
989.24s:  Having a gap that's typically like 100,000, like several hundred thousand O.I.
994.60s:  Difference, that's interesting to me.
998.20s:  Cool.
999.68s:  Yeah.
1001.96s:  So I think what's also interesting is the community is largely avoided options because I think historically
1009.60s:  they got burned on out of the money options.
1012.68s:  I'm sort of curious what you're thinking about.
1015.04s:  It just seems like in this last couple of months, there's been far more in the money options
1020.40s:  than I remember there ever being because I could remember this maybe just like me
1024.72s:  misremembering or wanting to remember something.
1026.76s:  But it seemed like every week, you know, people would be bummed out because they would see
1032.28s:  all these out of the money options on a Friday.
1035.48s:  But these days it seems like there's more landing in the money.
1039.00s:  So maybe do you think maybe people are learning picking up on some stuff?
1043.56s:  Yeah, that's a great question.
1046.56s:  And I'm not exactly sure because I don't have a great understanding of the standard purchasing
1052.72s:  behavior before to like draw what I would consider to be a more direct comparison.
1058.68s:  But if I were to take a swag at it, I think a big part of that also comes down to people
1064.28s:  learning more about the products themselves.
1067.60s:  So for example, if there's a lot of folks from like the ape community that are trying
1073.36s:  to pitch into this idea of creating a gamma ramp, well, you need a mix of in the money
1078.72s:  and out of the money options to start that process.
1081.76s:  So I think there's something probably coming from that angle.
1086.72s:  I also think that there's another angle that just focuses on how much raw dollars you
1093.68s:  can make.
1095.08s:  So there's a lot of reasons to go in the money.
1098.08s:  Like typically when I'm buying options, the overwhelming majority of instances, they're
1102.92s:  greater than 60 days out.
1104.64s:  A smaller subset sometimes will be 30 days out that like I typically won't go same week
1110.08s:  unless I'm playing something very short term that I can look at decisively.
1115.08s:  But I most of this time will be a little bit further out in time and it's almost always
1120.84s:  for the base position at the money or slightly in the money.
1125.88s:  And it's because you get a better dollar for dollar move with the underlying at a higher
1131.60s:  delta.
1132.60s:  And again, if I can get my platform to wake up, I can walk you guys through kind of an
1137.08s:  example that will help you visualize that concept a little more in depth.
1142.28s:  But the thing, the way to think about it is out of the money options are cheaper.
1147.64s:  They will compound as a percentage return much better than in the money options.
1152.80s:  They require a bigger move in order for them to like really start printing for you.
1158.88s:  And they will have slightly different theta decay tendencies depending on what the delta
1165.00s:  is and stuff like that.
1167.20s:  So my general approach to most things in life is actually balance.
1172.60s:  So I don't inherently do just one.
1175.76s:  I typically will have a base position little further out in time, typically at least slightly
1181.32s:  in the money, if not deep in the money.
1183.88s:  And then I'll add what I call kicker options.
1187.00s:  And those are near term expiration further out of the money.
1191.52s:  And that's really to capture a magnitude of a move if I get it because those options
1197.32s:  can compound super fast.
1200.40s:  But they are fighting a steady steady headwind of theta decay.
1206.48s:  And unless you get a big move real quick, they become worth less super fast.
1211.96s:  So let me run because I haven't watched your I should have watched your video about
1215.52s:  game stop options.
1216.52s:  But let me see if I'm learning correctly from you.
1219.00s:  So you know, this is our standard expiry for July.
1223.16s:  Here's our standard expiry for August.
1225.28s:  And then we've got September on October.
1227.36s:  So this is about three months out.
1230.52s:  So I look for something in the money here as like my base position.
1236.68s:  So right now we're at $26.
1239.24s:  So we're going to choose something around one of these strikes here.
1242.68s:  And these are there.
1245.08s:  Go ahead.
1246.08s:  Does this have delta?
1248.36s:  This is just Yahoo finance.
1250.00s:  I may very adept trader that uses very powerful tools.
1254.64s:  Yeah.
1255.64s:  Yeah.
1256.64s:  Yeah, I think that that's okay to ballpark it there.
1262.16s:  Let me see real quick.
1263.16s:  I have another platform I can also look at what expiration are you in right now?
1266.60s:  I am in October.
1267.80s:  Got it.
1268.80s:  Yep.
1269.80s:  So those are 98 days out.
1272.08s:  That's a little far from where I would go for something like game stop specifically.
1276.28s:  I would probably favor like 20 September.
1278.52s:  Okay.
1279.52s:  The only reason for that is like again, game stop is I say it all the time.
1285.52s:  It's different.
1286.52s:  Like you have to do things very differently with this thing.
1289.96s:  And when I look at when I look at the options here, they're not they're not crazy priced.
1300.52s:  I would probably be looking at at least like a 65 delta, but then you have to find liquidity.
1306.20s:  So the most liquid choices I see look to be about either the 25s.
1312.40s:  That's a really, really heavy strike.
1315.64s:  There's 2600 rely there.
1317.96s:  So that tells me that there's transactions in there.
1320.64s:  What three there bid at 515 offered at 550.
1324.92s:  So that would be fine.
1327.16s:  I personally would probably want a slightly higher delta because those options are a lot
1332.96s:  of extrinsic value.
1334.36s:  So those are also going to decay a little quicker than I would prefer.
1337.60s:  And so we're waiting by that.
1338.60s:  Let me just slow down a second.
1341.44s:  So since the strike is 25 and the price is five, you're basically you got to value this
1347.56s:  at basically like 30 bucks and the stock isn't at 30 bucks yet.
1351.40s:  Your $4 short of that.
1352.48s:  So $4 worth of that is like extrinsic right now wrapped up in theta.
1357.56s:  Yeah.
1358.56s:  So the way to think about the calculating the amount of theta in the options, it's the
1363.64s:  difference between the current price and the strike price.
1367.16s:  So current price is 20604.
1369.44s:  That strike price is 25.
1373.08s:  So an option price has two components intrinsic and extrinsic value.
1379.72s:  Intrinsic value simply put is how far in the money it is.
1385.40s:  So in this case, it is $1 and $4 cents in the money.
1390.48s:  So if we take the midpoint between the bid and the ask to value the option, let's just
1395.60s:  call it a 525 just for ease.
1400.32s:  So you would take 525, that's the total value of the option.
1404.68s:  You would subtract out your intrinsic value, which is a dollar and four cents.
1410.80s:  And then the remainder of that is extrinsic value.
1414.08s:  So that would be $4 and.
1418.76s:  $221.
1419.76s:  $4 and $2 and $2.
1421.76s:  Yep.
1422.76s:  And that's all basically now subject to theta decay, right?
1425.88s:  Exactly.
1426.88s:  That's all going to slowly decay away.
1430.56s:  And the good part about being further out in time is you decrease the rate of theta decay,
1439.72s:  but you're paying more upfront.
1442.32s:  So more total theta can decay.
1446.32s:  Right.
1447.32s:  Because you paid 525 exactly to buy you that time.
1453.72s:  So yeah, perfect.
1456.48s:  And it decays exponentially, right?
1458.36s:  So like on the on the near term, you're only going to lose a little bit of that extrinsic
1464.08s:  value.
1465.08s:  But then like let's say six months, this is three months out.
1468.92s:  Let's say a month has gone by.
1470.16s:  Now it's going to accelerate.
1471.76s:  Two months go by.
1472.76s:  It's going to accelerate a lot.
1473.76s:  And then as you get closer and closer and closer, there you go.
1475.76s:  You got to right there on the screen.
1477.56s:  So yeah, I totally stole the screen share from you.
1482.60s:  But you actually do a great job explaining this exact graph.
1486.04s:  So what this in the top right is this is just showing you the behavior of the Greeks.
1491.04s:  But what you'll notice is theta decay starts to really accelerate once you start getting
1496.88s:  within 60 days to expiration.
1499.92s:  And then it becomes highly exponential within 30 days.
1504.64s:  So and this simply put is because options, they have to make a choice.
1510.76s:  All of these out of the money options, they are going to go to zero.
1516.56s:  They have no intrinsic value.
1519.28s:  So as you get closer and closer to expiration, these are going to move way, way faster.
1525.28s:  So that's why you see this accelerate to that degree.
1529.20s:  So when I'm using something, I'm just using ORETS.
1531.92s:  Because again, I don't know if I've mentioned but my platform is now, it's kind of like
1535.56s:  if I don't have my pants on, like not having the ability to open the platform is like literally
1540.60s:  you're wearing pants right now?
1542.28s:  Yeah, well actually I'm not wearing short shorts, but.
1547.20s:  But so if if I look at these, there's a bunch of things I'm trying to balance.
1551.64s:  The first thing is I want to be far enough out in time to give it time to work.
1556.96s:  However, I know the further out in time I go, the more expensive they get.
1563.48s:  The next thing is if I do not get a high delta being further out in time, I'm not going
1572.60s:  to experience as much of the move because.
1575.24s:  So experience delta for me.
1577.32s:  What's delta?
1579.08s:  Great question.
1580.28s:  So there are a handful of Greeks that we care a lot about.
1585.88s:  Delta is one of them.
1588.28s:  So delta does a few things for us.
1591.04s:  The high level view of what delta does is it tells us the rate of change of an options
1597.60s:  premium per one point move in the underlying price.
1601.24s:  So that means in this case, if game stop goes up by one dollar, these options, CETRUS
1609.52s:  Parabus, everything else remaining the same will go up by 64 cents.
1614.60s:  That's what game is.
1615.60s:  Or I'm sorry, delta.
1617.28s:  So delta tells us the rate of change of an options premium.
1621.88s:  You can use it for other things.
1623.32s:  It's kind of a back of the napkin tool for probability of in the money, probability of
1626.76s:  touch.
1627.76s:  So in like layman's terms, if game stop goes up 1% tomorrow, your option will go up 1%,
1635.24s:  it'll go up 0.6%, 4%.
1638.24s:  It's based on a dollar move.
1640.20s:  So it's not based on percentage moves, but yes, it would essentially move a fraction
1645.68s:  of the dollar move.
1647.16s:  Okay.
1648.16s:  A question.
1649.16s:  I have another question.
1650.16s:  Yeah.
1651.16s:  So that's algorithmic, right?
1652.64s:  That's controlled by options pricing, which is inherent within how their schema works.
1657.16s:  But what if demand comes in suddenly and like wipes out all the sell orders on that particular
1662.88s:  strike, who would you sell it for a higher amount because it's just in demand at that
1667.68s:  moment?
1669.08s:  So typically if an option comes in really high demand like that, the bid ask spread would
1676.08s:  tighten.
1677.16s:  So you would gain a little bit more liquidity actually.
1680.92s:  Now if there's a ton of demand, because one of the things to always remember with options
1685.08s:  is their derivatives, their entire existence is derived from an underlying asset.
1692.08s:  So if we're looking at it in a vacuum, just in a vacuum, and the options are moving
1698.84s:  a lot and we're just pretending for whatever reason the underlying cannot move, the underlying
1703.24s:  is frozen, then there would be observably little change in the value, the price of those
1709.44s:  options.
1710.92s:  This is in a vacuum, which is not reality.
1714.56s:  Because as that's happening, the underlying is probably moving for one reason or another,
1719.84s:  which then creates kind of this cycle that we can see where as people are piling into
1726.04s:  options, the market makers typically are the other side of the trade, they will start
1730.40s:  hedging their positions by using the underlying and other options, which can move the underlying
1735.88s:  itself.
1736.88s:  So there can't really be a buy supply in balance because if a lot of buy orders come
1744.72s:  in for a particular strike and expiry, the market makers will just write contracts for
1749.32s:  that.
1750.32s:  Yeah.
1751.32s:  And if it's in that scenario where it's very one-sided order pressure, they can widen
1760.80s:  their bid-ask spreads to manage their risk.
1765.32s:  And in that case, once I'm sorry to keep interrupting the questions.
1770.48s:  So in that case, like let's say, like Rory and Kitty came in and wiped out or bought all
1775.44s:  the 20 strikes for June 21st, I believe it was.
1780.92s:  If you had already held those particular contracts, would you have seen a sudden surge in the
1787.24s:  price of your options that have been able to move on that beating the market makers to
1790.80s:  it?
1791.80s:  Or do they basically beat you to the punch?
1794.40s:  It would be the market makers leading the change in the price based on their assessment
1800.08s:  of the order flow.
1802.08s:  So you wouldn't see the price move unless it was adjusted by the market makers.
1807.40s:  Again, looking at this in a vacuum, pretending that the underlying isn't moving, looking
1811.72s:  at just the options.
1813.52s:  Okay.
1814.52s:  Cool.
1815.52s:  It's one of the things to always keep in mind with something like options or really
1822.64s:  any other derivatives, the market makers are very much slaved to the order flow.
1827.84s:  So if there's persistent buying, they have to continue creating, providing a market,
1834.28s:  right?
1835.28s:  That's how they make their money.
1836.28s:  So they're providing a market, providing a market to this one-sided order flow.
1838.92s:  Well, they have to continue hedging all this risk.
1841.36s:  Their ideal scenario would be to have a bit in an offer and you want to buy options.
1847.92s:  I sell them to you and then I immediately turn around and neutralize and flatten them
1852.48s:  and buy them from somebody else that's selling them, right?
1855.00s:  And essentially collect a bit ask spread.
1857.16s:  And if we see really strong one-sided order flow, it actually puts them in a terrible
1861.64s:  spot because they now have to accumulate massive inventory and nobody's offloading their
1868.36s:  risk, which is what they would prefer to be able to do.
1871.52s:  So in those instances, they can absolutely widen the bit ask spread and they can say,
1878.56s:  the bit ask spread is an expression of what they're pricing volatility at.
1884.00s:  But then it's also an expression typically that it would be a size, right?
1887.76s:  So they would say, I'm bid at 515 for 100 lots.
1892.96s:  I'm offered at 550 for 500 lots.
1896.20s:  They can offer different sizes and that's to help them manage their book, right?
1901.12s:  So in that case, they're really trying to work on the offer side.
1905.76s:  That's why they're giving you more size there.
1907.88s:  And they're trying to be lighter on the bid side and that's typically a way for them to
1912.12s:  manage their book.
1913.96s:  So are you seeing this behavior now?
1915.60s:  Are you seeing an acceleration of options buying on GameStop and then therefore a widening
1922.68s:  of the spreads?
1924.68s:  It's not a universal widening of the spreads.
1927.12s:  But one of the things to always remember is on a relative basis, you can always come
1933.68s:  up with kind of like an assessment of what's something that's liquid, right?
1937.40s:  So let's check out just an example really quick in Spy.
1942.16s:  And we'll go to those that same expiration cycle, which I think is here.
1947.48s:  And we were looking at like a 64 delta option.
1951.00s:  The reason why I use 64 delta is or something like that is to normalize across the different
1956.20s:  products for the basis of a comparison.
1958.76s:  So right here.
1960.24s:  So these options, they're bid at 26 offered at 34.
1966.76s:  So the process to like assess liquidity of something, I would literally take 1734.
1972.88s:  I would subtract 1726.
1975.88s:  That gives you the bid ask spread, eight cents.
1978.36s:  You can now take that bid ask spread of eight cents divided by the strike price.
1983.52s:  Right.
1984.52s:  Multiply that by 100.
1986.16s:  Now you have a percentage and this is normalized to everything.
1989.24s:  So the percentage of the bid ask spread here of the strike price is 0.014%.
1996.36s:  So even though is that automatically calculated somewhere, do you see that showing up somewhere?
2001.68s:  No, I do it.
2002.68s:  Oh, okay.
2003.68s:  Yeah, they don't they don't normalize it for you.
2006.08s:  What I've learned in a lot of instances, they don't make this stuff easy for some striking
2012.84s:  reason.
2014.00s:  We also use lots of silly terms when we're talking about this stuff.
2018.44s:  So I'm finding it interesting that you target the 64 delta.
2022.92s:  Is that common because look how heavy the activity is there for the spy?
2027.32s:  It's not so much that it's a 64 delta.
2030.24s:  It's more that it's a round number.
2032.00s:  You'll notice that the 50s, right, big number.
2036.00s:  Humans are hilarious.
2037.16s:  We're so predictable.
2038.36s:  560s, bigger number, 565s, bigger number, right?
2042.16s:  So five dollar increments.
2044.08s:  It's just a very natural cognitive bias.
2047.60s:  And then the other thing is if there's the start of order flow to an option, it's typically
2052.56s:  followed by it.
2053.56s:  So like, let's say for example, I wanted to buy an option and for whatever reason I wanted
2057.00s:  something around a 60 delta, I'm going to gravitate to this one because there's more
2061.68s:  liquidity here than everything else.
2064.12s:  And everyone else is doing the same thing.
2065.88s:  So it becomes like a kind of like a ball rush or a like a crowd mentality.
2071.20s:  It can be.
2072.20s:  It's really more in pursuit of liquidity though.
2074.08s:  It's not that, oh, I think other informed traders are going here to 555.
2078.52s:  So I want to do what they're doing.
2080.24s:  It's more, I don't want to pay as wide of a bid-ask spread.
2084.92s:  So I'm going to do everything I can to keep this as small as possible.
2090.64s:  Now the market's closed.
2091.80s:  So I mean, realistically, this has a similar size market, right?
2095.80s:  So you can easily go here at the probability of you getting filled here versus here at
2100.32s:  the same bid-ask spread is actually very low.
2102.52s:  You'll probably get a better fill on the 555s.
2105.20s:  So just finishing the example quickly, going back to GameStop looking at these 64s.
2111.04s:  So right now and other people can try this, right?
2113.96s:  So you just take the 550, you subtract 515.
2117.56s:  That gives you 35 cents wide.
2119.76s:  You divide that by 25 multiplied by 100.
2124.32s:  Your bid-ask spread as a percentage is 1.4%.
2127.60s:  As compared to zero point zero, one 4%.
2132.64s:  Oh zero.
2133.64s:  So huge.
2134.64s:  Over some massive.
2135.64s:  Massive difference.
2137.28s:  That's because it's a volatile product.
2140.80s:  If things are more volatile, they will have wider bid-ask spreads.
2145.24s:  It serves as kind of like a natural breaking system for markets.
2149.80s:  So there's just another thing for people to be aware of.
2153.16s:  If you're trading small contracts and you're not trading a ton, it doesn't necessarily matter
2157.76s:  a bunch.
2158.76s:  But it will explain to some degree why you will find people central again, 25, 30.
2166.36s:  It's the same thing.
2168.76s:  It's the same mental tendency to look for these round numbers and then people will gravitate
2174.16s:  to where the rest of the volume is.
2176.76s:  So the significant difference though, like if you're looking at the delta of 64 versus
2180.36s:  the delta of 82, that's going to cause a big difference in the behavior of the options
2186.08s:  contract.
2187.08s:  Because if GameStop goes up a dollar, I'm netting way more of that move.
2193.52s:  So way more is intrinsic there.
2195.68s:  Right.
2196.68s:  Is what we're saying there at the.
2197.68s:  Exactly.
2198.68s:  What's strike are we seeing there at the 20s?
2200.68s:  That's a big difference.
2201.68s:  So you're buying.
2202.68s:  That's a big.
2203.68s:  You're buying way more of this stock and you're gambling way less.
2207.88s:  It's that's exactly the way to look at it.
2210.16s:  It's a way of gaining leverage.
2212.24s:  So every options contract holds up to 100 shares of the underlying, right?
2218.44s:  Each options contract is worth 100 shares.
2220.92s:  So the way you can look at the delta is that tells you how many shares the position is
2226.80s:  behaving as right now, right?
2229.40s:  So remember, delta tells us the dollar change in or it tells us the premium rate of change
2234.44s:  for every dollar move in the underlying.
2236.36s:  So essentially each one of these is behaving like one share.
2240.28s:  So that is exactly why you will see these move and give you a better gross dollar return.
2247.76s:  However, something like this can give you a slightly better compounding return where
2253.16s:  you're putting up less money, right?
2255.04s:  Because these are called 525 versus these where you're paying 760 something like that.
2262.44s:  So these are paying more, but you if you get a move, you'll make a bigger gross dollar
2267.68s:  amount.
2269.04s:  These you're paying slightly less, but you will see a slightly less dollar move for the
2275.68s:  underlying itself.
2277.40s:  So that's the cool part about options is that you really have the ability to construct
2282.08s:  positions that makes sense to you that really align with what you're trying to accomplish.
2289.76s:  So typically I'll have a base position that looks like this.
2294.04s:  So out here in the 25s and it's I literally have these right now.
2298.60s:  And then I'll put on shorter term positions, typically two weeks, three weeks, something
2303.80s:  like that.
2304.80s:  If I start seeing price movement and I'll do something that's a little closer to at
2309.68s:  the money or slightly out of the money.
2312.40s:  And it's because these can compound a lot.
2315.88s:  So the delta you're looking for on these is maybe somewhere around 0.5.
2320.04s:  I would less than that.
2321.20s:  So typically I would be looking like a 30 delta, 40 delta.
2324.92s:  A big thing is making sure that you're getting exposure to enough gamma, which this doesn't
2329.84s:  show me for some reason.
2331.12s:  But gamma in a nutshell is the rate of change of delta.
2337.64s:  So that's essentially an option's ability to compound.
2341.76s:  So options that are closer to expiration.
2345.12s:  That's what this is here.
2346.12s:  This yellow line represents closer to expiration.
2348.36s:  We'll have a higher gamma.
2350.08s:  And that just tells us that the delta is going to change faster, which is where your compounding
2354.96s:  return potential comes from.
2357.24s:  But it gives and takes.
2358.84s:  If it goes against you, it means that you're going the wrong way super fast.
2363.68s:  So it's a delicate dance.
2368.76s:  So I'm hearing a lot of talk about options crush recently, right?
2373.16s:  Because we just had a period where the stock cooled down a lot.
2377.12s:  So and I think that's what you just kind of like talks to a little bit, right?
2382.28s:  The idea of like it turning against you.
2384.88s:  You all of a sudden your options lose a ton of value very quickly.
2387.80s:  So that means options crush right there.
2390.92s:  It's kind of a perversion of the term.
2392.52s:  I get what they're trying to say.
2394.32s:  Typically, when you'll hear people talk about options, crests of some sort, we generally
2399.32s:  referring to volatility actually.
2401.88s:  We normally volatility crush.
2404.64s:  But what that framing sounds like to me are people that have short term options with really
2412.84s:  high theta.
2414.88s:  And then their options are decaying away super, super fast.
2419.28s:  So there's a lot of options.
2422.84s:  Let's say for example, if we go to this all strikes, I think these have a 125.
2428.08s:  So there's 56,180 of these options way out here at 125.
2434.20s:  And their bid at five cents offered at six.
2439.44s:  Now again, this is a not my platform.
2443.60s:  This is just not my boat.
2445.72s:  But typically I would have theta in here to show you how much this decays.
2450.76s:  But on a daily basis, a huge chunk of this will decay out.
2456.20s:  So you could probably ballpark it to about a penny, which would be a dollar.
2460.88s:  But that's a fifth of the position after one day goes.
2464.36s:  It's gone.
2465.36s:  Just gone.
2466.36s:  So they will decay very, very fast.
2470.12s:  And most of these options that have these tiny little deltas, they can compound incredibly
2477.52s:  if you get a big old move in your favor.
2480.60s:  So if you're just a question, I've always had.
2484.08s:  So like looking at the strikes, they're at 100, right?
2487.80s:  So stock starts moving.
2488.80s:  Let's say the stock moves up $20 tomorrow or on Monday.
2494.04s:  We see a settlement cycle.
2495.28s:  Not a financial base.
2497.40s:  Stock goes from 25 or 26 to 46, right?
2502.12s:  Roughly speaking, that strike, if I was holding one contract, because the underlying is now
2508.32s:  moved $20, I should get, because it's got a delta, what's the delta on that guy?
2514.80s:  It's zero, because it's so far out of the money.
2517.84s:  Right?
2518.84s:  So it won't move in value, right?
2521.00s:  It will.
2522.00s:  They just, because delta, it goes beyond two decimal points.
2525.24s:  So there's three, four, five decimal points to these really far out of the monies.
2529.12s:  Okay.
2530.12s:  And then it will only start changing in value as the strike approach is 100, right?
2536.56s:  Um, yes.
2538.52s:  So this either you would need to see the underlying move in the favor of the position.
2544.04s:  So in this case, if we're long these, you would need the underlying to go up or if volatility
2549.48s:  exploded for some reason, if volatility goes up a lot, the premium of all options goes
2555.84s:  up.
2556.84s:  Now, you would, who is quantifying or is it a static calculation for just vol, for volatility?
2562.60s:  So volatility, when you say who's, are you saying like who's determining it?
2567.88s:  Because it's, you know, it's a function of what the underlying is doing, right?
2572.28s:  So the stock is, it's a function of what the underlying is expected to do.
2577.88s:  So how, how is that derived?
2581.08s:  Great question.
2582.20s:  So volatility is a absolutely fascinating, fascinating component of options.
2590.44s:  And essentially, there are different types of volatility that we use.
2595.32s:  So on the trading side, more often than not, we, we use implied volatility.
2600.96s:  This is where we're taking whatever volatility has already been baked into the price and
2605.64s:  we're pulling it out and we can see what it is.
2608.72s:  That's implied volatility.
2610.16s:  Now what you're referring to is what's called forecast volatility.
2614.32s:  This is what market makers are doing.
2616.56s:  They're essentially maintaining a volatility surface model that postulates what volatility
2623.96s:  is going to be going forward.
2626.40s:  There are a lot of different ways to create these models.
2629.12s:  They're proprietary by nature.
2630.76s:  The reason why they're proprietary is because that's literally, if you can price,
2635.08s:  better than that person, you can make more money than them.
2638.52s:  So we'll not be able to actually see if you want to call it F, the forecast volatility,
2644.04s:  but we'll be able to see its effects by the pricing of the options as things are happening.
2649.40s:  Okay.
2650.56s:  Because they're at the, at the end of the day, they're the ones selling most of the options.
2656.92s:  So in theory, they could suddenly price options very, very cheaply crushing out all the
2664.48s:  options, but that's a risk for them because if the stock were to then move into those
2669.48s:  options, they would have potentially sold a bunch of them at that cheap price and they
2673.44s:  get blown out.
2674.44s:  So it's in their interest to do this and not cheat on pricing the options.
2679.96s:  They have some wiggle room, but not a ton because it's still a consensus driven supply and
2687.32s:  demand market.
2688.72s:  So if I see them price something too cheaply, I can immediately tell there's an opportunity
2694.36s:  so people like me that are even, you know, I'm still, I'm still really dumb, but I'm
2700.88s:  not super dumb.
2702.24s:  So like if I see an opportunity like that, I'm going to take a shot on it.
2706.12s:  So speculators like me that are looking for that stuff will then flood into those products.
2711.08s:  And they can do it to one another too.
2713.08s:  So if like one market maker messes up on their options pricing, another one could buy
2717.64s:  on all up and then sell them and immediately make some money.
2720.84s:  Exactly.
2721.84s:  Okay.
2723.72s:  Options, sorry to keep interrupting.
2725.60s:  How many options market makers would there be?
2728.72s:  Because people talk about Wolverine.
2730.60s:  People talk about Citadel.
2732.24s:  I don't know.
2732.68s:  Susqueilana does options, but how many on one stock would they typically be involved in
2737.60s:  making this market?
2739.44s:  It's a great question.
2740.60s:  Really difficult to know.
2742.08s:  Really difficult to know because technically speaking, I could even behave as a market maker.
2746.88s:  Okay.
2747.88s:  Yeah, it's in terms of like large market making firms, you hit a lot of them because
2755.16s:  the other component to this that adds and muddies the water even more is there are
2760.96s:  prop trading firms and high frequency trading firms that also essentially behave short
2767.80s:  term as market makers.
2769.80s:  They have a different game, right?
2770.92s:  That's not their primary modality, but they can interact with things that are mispriced.
2776.08s:  Essentially, either supply liquidity by taking the other sides of trades potentially.
2782.08s:  Or take advantage of some of its mispricing.
2784.80s:  The mispricing absolutely.
2786.12s:  And algorithms, algorithms are high frequency trades are literally hunting for that.
2793.20s:  They're so sophisticated to the point where they care about how close they are to the exchange.
2799.64s:  They're paying millions of dollars to be ex bit closer to the exchange to reduce
2805.24s:  latency.
2806.24s:  And so there was a clip on SuperSonic about just that today or yesterday, right?
2811.88s:  Famous clip from it was quite a while ago.
2815.08s:  It was like over 15 years ago, but talking about the latency and how much they're paying
2819.48s:  not just for speed, right?
2821.16s:  For internet speed, server location, but they're paying for particular levels of information
2826.44s:  and quality of information from the markets.
2828.52s:  And the markets are actually making the exchanges or making more money on that than they're
2832.60s:  making on offering those premium packages for information, quality and speed of information
2838.36s:  than they are on the actual trading.
2840.52s:  So, but what I'm curious about is when you're showing the volume on GameStop options as an example,
2846.68s:  it seems so low to me.
2848.28s:  Is that still going to be an efficient market where like a strike in that
2852.12s:  expiry only has volume on a day of maybe 50 or 100, like if you go to the daily volume on some
2859.48s:  of these or even lower in some cases.
2862.76s:  So is it still efficient?
2863.96s:  Yeah, it will always be relative to the size of the product, but yeah, like I still absolutely.
2872.68s:  Because relative to the size of this stock, there's actually a
2877.32s:  run of activity in here, like a crazy amount.
2881.32s:  So it's almost the inverse, right?
2883.64s:  So like if you look at other companies, well, GE is kind of big, but I don't know what this
2888.92s:  looks like. I'm literally seeing.
2891.56s:  Yeah, look, look at the OI here.
2893.24s:  14, 24, 183.
2897.08s:  And this is a $159 stock.
2899.24s:  This is GE. This is a big company.
2901.56s:  And you can see just how little activity there is here.
2905.48s:  There's, and this is big for this product, the 1500.
2909.96s:  So it's almost actually the inverse where GameStop is crazy active for the size.
2915.32s:  You should see it.
2916.84s:  We should see efficiently priced options.
2921.00s:  Moderately.
2922.92s:  The reason why I say moderately is because of the way that this moves, which is again,
2928.04s:  what makes it so fascinating is from a market-making perspective,
2933.08s:  you literally have to be ready to be ran over by a train whenever you're making a market in this.
2938.92s:  So I mean by that.
2940.76s:  The fact that GameStop does this, it goes from 17 to 48.
2947.64s:  That from a market-making perspective, being on the other side of those
2950.84s:  options traits, that's hell.
2953.16s:  Because they are having, again, this is kind of the entire concept of a gamma squeeze,
2958.68s:  right? It's driven by market makers.
2960.52s:  And it's because they're getting fucking destroyed.
2963.96s:  And they have to find a way to manage their risk in the positions.
2967.48s:  And how would they do that?
2969.00s:  So we know that market makers have come out and said they've made a ton of money on GameStop.
2977.56s:  So how should we do, Dan?
2979.48s:  All right, so they're making money on the spreads.
2981.64s:  How else would they be mitigating risk on the options front?
2986.04s:  For somebody that's not in the know here, because occasionally they are going to get run over,
2988.92s:  right? We saw options printed two or three times now, at least in the last two to three months.
2998.12s:  More, actually, probably, because May 3rd would be a big options printing in the whole week to follow.
3004.60s:  May 13th and 14th. But then multiple periods since then, there would be great opportunity to buy
3010.20s:  into some options and sell some options, make a ton of money. So what could they be doing to,
3017.08s:  because can they play them themselves, too?
3019.00s:  Absolutely. I was literally going to say that. That is one of the first things that they're
3022.84s:  going to do is hedging what the underlying is one tool that they will use provided that it's
3029.08s:  accessible. But they will use options tremendously, because the only thing that it's really important
3035.24s:  to remember is that option market makers, they have a book of a ton of things, right? It's not
3042.04s:  just individual strikes, you know, that counterparty to a person's single trade. They're on the other
3048.36s:  sides of thousands of trades. So they can use options that it's actually why they're so interested
3054.68s:  in all of the Greeks, because they can mitigate a lot of their risk by using options or even more
3061.80s:  interesting. Actually, I get my tinfoil hat. Do you like my tinfoil hat?
3068.92s:  Love the tinfoil hat. I need to make one.
3070.76s:  Yeah. I have to, I had to put my tinfoil hat on for this part. But the other thing that it can do
3076.12s:  is that if they think it's an informed order, like the counterparty to the order knows something,
3081.72s:  they can run with the order. So they can order. Okay, so that is something that I never knew about
3088.04s:  until very recently, the idea that orders are flagged, right? As informed versus uninformed.
3095.56s:  Absolutely. What does that mean? So you're telling me every option's order is that true for equity
3100.76s:  orders too, has a flag on it that says informed versus uninformed.
3104.84s:  I don't know if it's every single one. I couldn't speak intelligently to the to the actual process
3110.44s:  that they flag it. But what they can do is identify order flow that looks, it looks not like standard
3119.72s:  retail, right? Like the vast majority of retail trades, they're going to assume is uninformed to a
3124.60s:  degree. And they're not necessarily going to worry about it too much. But if they see somebody like
3130.52s:  roaring kitty, for example, I actually spoke to one of my buddies that's a market maker for this
3135.48s:  exact thing. So I was just curious. I was like, how would you even manage this position? And
3140.20s:  the first thing he said is that he would immediately hedge because he doesn't want to have
3145.32s:  open-sized risk with something that looks informed. So the way that it looks informed is that it's
3151.16s:  really big size. Somebody taking a big bet. And they're also willing to enter multiple times,
3158.84s:  right? Like they're building a position. So that starts to look like somebody knows something.
3164.36s:  And market makers, they're wildly, wildly educated in terms of what order flow is normal for a
3172.52s:  product. And then what order flow becomes anomalous. They're fantastic at that. So it's another way
3178.44s:  that they can identify opportunities in things like mergers and acquisitions. They can see crazy
3185.32s:  order flow for earnings. They can see inside or order flow and then try to frontrun it. So
3191.48s:  essentially, they're looking for certain kinds of behaviors and patterns that they identify as
3196.28s:  different for the underlying, the standard run of the mill transactions. And they're looking for
3201.56s:  things like size, persistence, the way that they're structuring the trades. And then they can make
3207.24s:  a assessment and think, okay, do I want to bet against this guy? If so, they would under hedge.
3213.64s:  If they don't want to bet against the guy, but they're not sure that they want to run with them,
3217.80s:  they'll just essentially hedge the position totally and just run a pure hedge and collect what
3222.68s:  they can off of that. Or you said earlier, running with them, would that be why we saw so many
3228.92s:  January 21st at the 20s? Because while he owned 120,000 of them, a ton of them came on top of this,
3235.96s:  right? Yeah, it's really, really hard to discreetly identify who was piling on, but there was a lot
3242.92s:  of people piling onto those. Right. So a lot of household and retail could have after the fact,
3248.28s:  but we saw, I believe, his position come in, got built during that week of the share offering,
3255.72s:  but then there were also, there were too many of these block orders of five to 10,000.
3262.36s:  There was more than just him doing that kind of a play. So that could be people just basically
3267.48s:  mirroring his trade. Kind of like I think you said, you do at times, right? A flag or a
3271.96s:  an order comes up and you're like, well, I better jump in on this because someone's building something.
3276.28s:  It's literally how I found his order. And that's the funny part. It's one of the funniest things
3282.12s:  about this whole story, at least from like my fox hole, my little view is the fact like, I had no
3287.64s:  idea it was him. Like, I don't know who it was. I'm just sitting here, just watching blinky lights
3292.76s:  and stuff. And I see something that starts looking interesting. And I'm like, wait a minute, what the
3297.56s:  fuck is going on? Yeah. So I start paying much closer attention. And I'm like, like this right here,
3304.36s:  if this is big of a red flag as you could possibly get, you have this persistent sizing, 5,000
3311.88s:  centralized at the 20s, 21 June. It's the same position, over three million dollar positions.
3319.16s:  And they're going on within moments of one another, right? So this one went on at 12 o' 3,
3324.04s:  1252, 1138. Like we were just pounding this position. And it happens 11, 32, 28, like, it's
3333.40s:  incessant. So that lights up on my alert system literally like a freaking Christmas tree. And the
3341.72s:  first thing I think of is this is an insane amount of conviction, right? Like because you can see
3349.32s:  what the standard premiums are for positions that are being built. And then you start seeing blocks
3354.44s:  come in in the two millions, five millions. And there's a bunch of them at the same time.
3360.92s:  It's so maybe a follow up question on that. Sorry. I'm just going to say for in that instance,
3367.40s:  for an options trader, that is like a big, blinky, flashy red light. It's so, so apparent.
3374.84s:  And the market makers are going to have even more tools to see that. Absolutely.
3378.84s:  They yes, by the time I see it, they probably have already built a position.
3383.56s:  So people are really excited about like these 30s for next week. You know, is that anything like this
3391.32s:  at all? Because I don't know and I haven't spoken to it at all. Yeah, definitely not like that at all.
3398.60s:  So for a comparison, if we look over the last 30 days, the biggest trade was 875.
3408.84s:  Which I'm not I'm not dumping on that, right? Like that's not that's not it.
3412.36s:  $1,000 trade. That's a billion dollar options trade for this.
3417.88s:  That's that's that's the other hilarious thing about like looking at this stuff is just how much it
3424.36s:  like skews the perception of reality. Let's take a look at the 19 expiration coming up. So the
3431.64s:  biggest trade for this upcoming 19 July expiration is 234K. It was the biggest trade. So again,
3437.80s:  not insignificant, but being in the world of game stop. What's the strike on where do you see the
3443.80s:  strike on that one? Those are 30s. Those are the 30s. Okay. Yep. And I think this was a 5,000
3450.04s:  lot. I think this came through with a couple others. Yeah, broken up. Yeah. Exactly. So I think this is
3455.72s:  the entire order. But I thought in it. So I think it amounted to 4810 here. And then my guess is
3464.52s:  there was probably obviously a little bit more that got tacked on probably to round it out. But
3471.32s:  the wild part here is because game stop is so freaking crazy when you see like, you know, quarter
3476.92s:  million dollar positions come through like you're numb to it. You're like, yeah, okay, bro, whatever.
3480.92s:  Like wait, wait, wait me up when this is $3 million. So it's it looks like something could be going
3488.36s:  on, but it doesn't look anything literally anything like what we saw going on back in the original
3497.64s:  squeeze. Right. So here's a here's a question. We know that he built that position. And he had
3505.64s:  to have had about $170 million to do it, right? Because he bought 120,000. That would have cost
3511.80s:  60 60 something million. 68 million was the options for the options. And then there was like a 100
3517.32s:  million for the shares, right? Yeah. Somewhere around there. All right. So was there an opportunity to
3523.08s:  make that amount of money into the run up to $80. Conceivably options only could could that have been
3529.24s:  accomplished off of like a small starting position? How much how much could you have made?
3535.24s:  Playing that from before, basically, this is like early May into May 13th and 14th. I don't even know
3543.08s:  like the magnitude of because I've never played options. I don't know how much you can make on them.
3549.00s:  Could that have been done? In terms of when you say could that have been done, you mean making
3555.72s:  how much? So making enough to buy that next position, you would have needed about 170 million to buy
3563.00s:  those shares and buy those one's others, those 20 calls, right? So he needs my theory is he needs 170
3571.32s:  million in cash on May 15th to start building his next position. If he started with say $5
3579.32s:  million in cash on May 1st, can you turn 5 million on May 1st into 170 million two weeks later?
3588.84s:  Is that possible? Could he I would have to look closer at the numbers? Again, if my platform worked,
3597.64s:  I could answer it actually for you immediately. But I'm trying to log in again now and it looks
3604.28s:  like it's still down. But it would be highly improbable is the way I would frame that. Like the
3611.40s:  probability of turning five into almost 200 million over the course of those two weeks, I don't
3619.48s:  I don't think that is a highly probable scenario. So theoretically it makes more sense. We're not
3627.96s:  trying to nail it down or we're just falling, but he probably came into there you go. He probably came
3633.88s:  into May 15th with like already a large cash position established and he probably had to have
3640.60s:  done something similar with Chewie because out of nowhere he shows up with nine million shares at Chewie,
3644.84s:  which I don't know how much those cost him. But it seems like. Yeah, that one's
3649.72s:  crazy to me too. The whole Chewie thing. And I think one of the most interesting parts about that one
3655.64s:  is I guess technically he could have used the options to gain that exposure, but that's still a
3661.32s:  big position. Right. We haven't seen his position exactly. We don't know if it shares. They would
3668.76s:  have to be to be reported as a 13 G though short dated options, right? Less than 60 days.
3676.20s:  Yeah, you would know that rule better than I would because I originally didn't even know on the 13 G
3681.32s:  if it could be shares and I had to look that up and I found out that it could be options. I mean,
3685.80s:  if it could be options and it could be options that I learned. And I also don't know if there's
3690.28s:  a difference between the the G and the D. I don't know. Yeah, that part I don't know either. Maybe
3696.92s:  maybe somebody in the chat knows I imagine. I think on a D you show the position on the G.
3702.28s:  The you don't have to show what the purchase. Well, no, the purchase date or the event date is
3709.32s:  noted on the G, but the price paid is not shown or anything like the positions are shown on the G.
3717.16s:  Just the like what the representation is in number of shares and what percent that is of the
3723.16s:  outstanding. So yeah, super curious. I just, you know, when is he going to come back? I don't
3729.72s:  think he's gone for good again. But are we going to see more details on that position? Because that's
3734.84s:  crazy. Did not expect that at all. I'm not going to lie. Part of me expected whenever
3742.44s:  the reason why I keep taking this off in case you don't know is that a solid aluminum foil hat
3747.64s:  vents as well as you think it would. So it's kind of like cooking your head. Literally. And
3753.64s:  I tell you my brain is already too close like a steamed vegetable. So I don't need to actually
3757.96s:  become a physical one. I think I think there's such a crazy potential for him to go so many routes
3770.44s:  after that. Gee, like I don't think it's any sort of happenstance that he hasn't shown a portfolio
3777.24s:  update for about a month now. I know that there was a lot of people that were really expected to
3781.32s:  see something like yesterday. That part I find just so intriguing, right? He was pretty rock study
3789.48s:  with these updates. And then he just stopped for some reason that I find I find very curious. I
3795.32s:  don't know what to make of that. Do you have any ideas? Well, we can look at the timing, right? So
3801.00s:  let me look at the timing. I'm going to pull up. He has only posted his yellow updates since
3807.32s:  cut returning on June 13th. June 2nd was the first one. That was a that was a Sunday.
3819.32s:  And then the stock surge like crazy on June 3rd. Then he posted another update after that,
3829.24s:  like that evening. And I think the key there, I think what he was trying to telegraph was,
3835.00s:  I'm not pumping this thing, right? I just showing my position because he could have taken action
3840.52s:  and he made no action, right? Because the media, like it was blaming him for the events for tweeting,
3847.32s:  right? On the rise up to 80, right? So by not taking any action during this Monday morning
3853.64s:  pump, he's basically saying like, I'm not actually causing this to happen. He did one more update on
3860.60s:  the sixth. And again, his position is completely unchanged on the sixth. Then he livestreams
3868.52s:  as it's pumping again on the 7th, 6th and 7th, doesn't do anything with this position. So you can
3873.56s:  count, you can count the 7th as a yellow update. Can we just pause there for a second and just
3879.72s:  soak in the fact that we're looking at a portfolio that has $250 million in gains on the day.
3891.08s:  Right? What is this? Like what is this? It's all game stuff. It's insane. I like, I find myself
3904.52s:  talking about this stuff. And I'm like, what the fuck am I even saying anymore? It's like,
3909.80s:  at least in time you kind of stop and you like realize how absurd this whole scenario is. I had
3917.24s:  a moment of that when I was just like working on the spreadsheet today. Like I'm working on the
3921.40s:  spreadsheet as I'm doing, just checking my way on it. And I just stop and I think to myself like,
3925.64s:  this is actually crazy. Like everything that's going on with the story is insane.
3931.80s:  Literally, literally, it's so wild to me that this is like the reality. And this is single
3941.48s:  dude. This is sitting in his house using Yahoo Finance for his chart. And he's just using
3948.20s:  what's his platform season here? You trade that? Yeah, that looks like whatever the, and that's not
3954.28s:  even like, that's not even like a platform that I can't open, right? Like I can't get in my damn
3959.24s:  platform. He's just logging into the web browser. And he's just using like the standard website.
3966.76s:  So yeah, he basically exposed his portfolio on Sunday, stock runs, he exposed it again,
3972.84s:  doesn't make any changes. Shows his position again as stock goes bonkers and then live streams
3979.40s:  and shows it live as it's then losing like three or four hundred million dollars in value.
3985.72s:  And he's laughing and drinking up beer, bro.
3990.44s:  Mad man. And then his final update. No, no, no, no, no. He still hasn't changed anything,
3998.36s:  right? Yeah. No, he's state static. No change. Company has now sold 75 million shares. And what does
4005.24s:  he do? Basically doubles down. Yep. Like if that's not because, you know, I see all these comments.
4012.04s:  I just saw a comment on my channel today, someone basically saying like,
4014.76s:  we're in kid he's going to leave. He's lost faith in the company. He just got hundreds of million
4019.48s:  dollars on stock. You know, like, there's, there's nothing, there's nothing about much of anything
4027.40s:  in here that indicates to me that like he's trying to leave even from even from that options position.
4033.72s:  Like, who puts on $68 million of options without the intention, like of doing something with, right?
4041.64s:  So yeah, I just, yeah, it's crazy. Absolutely crazy. And the fact that the,
4051.24s:  the my big angle on my channel is I talk about the media, right? The media should be like saying
4056.84s:  how amazing this is because like, this is an incredible, just an incredible play. Like you said,
4063.48s:  so much conviction, right? It was so, so, so much conviction that you could just write it and follow
4068.92s:  it and do well because you know that someone with this amount of strength and what they're doing
4073.24s:  has to know what they're doing, right? I think that that's a really fair assessment.
4078.44s:  There's a comment from Franz Zoo who says he 99% could turn a few millions into more than 100
4085.16s:  millions in two weeks. Look how he made four days on half a billion. I think though the one thing
4090.04s:  I would note for you, Frances, think about the difference in magnitude, right? Few millions
4096.36s:  into hundreds of millions versus starting from 200 million and then going to essentially 500
4104.20s:  and change. So at one point, he had almost a billion like on this on the sixth, right?
4110.60s:  Who's supposed to be? Yeah. So that's like a five five X, right? Yep. Over a couple weeks.
4116.44s:  I think the other thing to note is there's something to be said about like what's possible
4122.36s:  and then what's probable, right? So when he started going through that like almost becoming a
4127.96s:  bill, and I think he made a tweet about that too, which was hilarious. He said you were a billionaire,
4131.96s:  which is putting, you got a pretty tinfoil hat back on for us, but maybe he is a maybe he had a
4139.16s:  billion in cash going into this because if he played just 2020 into 2021 doing a thousand X or 2019
4147.96s:  into 2021, he did a thousand X on his position. There's been enough volatility in the meantime on
4153.80s:  just this one stock for him to create a very large position. The only thing I would say and a couple
4160.92s:  people have said similar things that I'm just not sure about is on the stream when the thing was
4168.68s:  plummeting, he made the explicit comment of like this is my only account and these are my only
4174.12s:  positions. So I have to go back and watch it. He said these are my only game stop positions.
4181.64s:  Did he say, oh, let's find out. I'll find it real quick while you're talking and then we can
4185.64s:  literally make the quip. Yeah. And he did say is cash a position. He did say that. So he did
4194.44s:  as he did it, he hovered the mouse inside the platform. Right. Give me one sec. I think I know where it's
4209.16s:  this is the argument of the century. Does roaring kitty. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, let's
4216.28s:  let's ask the chat. I'll throw a poll in there for them and see what they say. What do you get?
4219.80s:  The question is essentially, does he have a large cash or other stock position outside of what we
4227.00s:  saw in these yellow updates here? Is this so is this only is this is only position or does he have
4232.44s:  other positions than this other capital. So does RK have a large cash pile or other positions
4243.48s:  outside of the e-trade portfolio? He's shared with us. Because the thing that considers he
4255.72s:  poses or his 13G trade event is for the what the 24th. I believe it's a fidelity account. My bad,
4267.88s:  guys, whatever the account is. I don't know. No, no, no, I think what people are saying is he's got
4272.12s:  a tab open and fidelity. Oh, I see. Okay. You don't see what's in there. And then in his previous
4277.40s:  live streams, he's used fidelity tools. So he could have he could have an account on fidelity.
4283.16s:  I'm going to grab the screen share from you again, really quick. And then I'm going to share the
4287.72s:  sound as well. Yeah. So I think I think this is pretty close to where it is. Just one quick ad
4293.08s:  been note for you guys as I play this. If for whatever reason, YouTube flags makes they always do
4297.72s:  when I try to play shit. If it cuts the stream, they're it'll come back on. We just have to chill
4302.84s:  for a second is all that is. And I have to turn it off. So if we disappear for a moment, that is
4308.68s:  what cost it. All right. I'm guessing it's right around here because this is where like literally
4315.16s:  yeah, the most user. There is a session. There goes. All right. Here we go. And then let me know if
4319.72s:  you can hear it. There you go. All right. Cheers. Cheers. I got a lot there. So those, yeah,
4328.44s:  those are my only positions. You know, as you know, about me, I'll take. So you heard what he said.
4334.36s:  Only positions. Yep. It's a true yellow again. I suppose. I know there's some cash.
4343.64s:  Quick side note again. Sorry. Can we just salute this man? He's sitting here with fucking band-aids
4351.24s:  on his face. And how far down is he on the day right here? What's this?
4357.16s:  220 something new. You know, like lunatic. I love it. I love it. You just can't make this up, bro.
4370.92s:  All right. I got it. Actually, that's what I made. It depends on your positions, but
4377.64s:  uh, it's another yellow again. You know what I'm saying? It's how I roll. So that's that's
4381.80s:  that there. But I seen those headlines. E-trade. E-trade. I see those headlines. I gotta check. I'm
4390.28s:  checking in every day. A long end. I'm like, I'm right. Position's still there. Are they still there?
4395.00s:  Let me check. They're still there. Wait, they're still there. Okay. They're still there. Actually,
4398.52s:  I wasn't even like paying attention to the details. They're still there. But I'm each morning.
4403.16s:  I'm like, I don't know what's happening. So I go, all right. Well, don't make me. Don't make me. But
4407.72s:  E-trade, I'll do this with HTML. I'll do that. Don't make me. Don't make me remove it. I know how
4415.24s:  to do that. I'm just kidding. No, I'm going to put it back. We're good. We're good. We're good.
4418.36s:  No, we're those positions are there. Those positions are there. But I'll do it. I'll remove it. Don't
4423.08s:  make me. Don't don't make me do it. Don't make me. I'll delete that from the HTML. I will.
4433.16s:  All right. Mr. Robot Hacker here. You know, I learned a thing or two and I know how to delete that.
4438.44s:  I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. But I can. I can. I'm just messing. I'm just
4445.80s:  messing people. Okay. It's still I put it back. See, I'm like, what the? It's like all green. He's
4450.44s:  like, oh, he's squinting. He's squinting. He's like, oh, he's waking up looking. I feel like
4455.40s:  that's me in the morning. Some days I wake it up and I'm squinted. I'm seeing the stuff. I'm like,
4461.88s:  oh, my what the hell did I do? So that's where we're at right now. Oh, did it go down? Oh,
4466.04s:  is it halted again? It's halted. Well, that's where it was. Right word. That's where we're at the
4470.60s:  hole. See, I wait until the halt because if if it's halted, it doesn't show the stuff. So it's
4476.20s:  needs to be unh halted. I don't know why it does that. It just is. And so yeah, there you go.
4481.40s:  There you go. Did we miss the farmer? He said his cash position. I think it was like right
4486.04s:  after his first. Yeah, he says it right in the beginning. He goes, there's some cash in there
4490.92s:  is cash position. But we can go back to that because I think in the context there, I took it to
4495.80s:  mean like what's in there. Now, just to be clear, it's difficult, right? Because he's he's
4502.92s:  thinking in layers. So I don't think that he would ever purposefully like lie to like
4508.36s:  misrepresent what he has. I like, I think he's super transparent. But it also would not shock me
4516.36s:  if all of his wealth was not in this one account. Yeah, right. That seems that seems shocking is
4524.76s:  I think what he's implying there, though, is that like this is his only options and stocks at the
4530.28s:  moment, right? Yeah, I'll play the front part again to see the cash part specifically.
4535.80s:  I'm not sure it's. I'm doing it. But I think it's fine if I bring the don't hold it, don't hold it.
4542.84s:  There you go. All right. There you go. Is it on the chat there? There you go. All right. Cheers.
4551.48s:  Cheers. I got a lot there. So those, yeah, those are my only positions. You know, as you know,
4556.36s:  about me, I'll take it's a true yellow again. I suppose,
4562.84s:  I know there's some cash there. That's what I made it to. I know there's some cash there.
4567.48s:  So I think there's the rest. I think he says new positions. But I suppose,
4572.92s:  I know there's some cash there. That's what I made it to. Depends on your positions. But
4579.24s:  it's another yellow again. He does say his cash position. But I think
4586.52s:  just kind of riffing off the fact in trying to at least I took it as he's trying to reinforce
4591.64s:  the fact that he doesn't have any other positions. I think he was simply saying that because,
4596.44s:  you know, he has some cash, which I think in this case, I forget it's millions of dollars in cash.
4603.48s:  That's like 30 million bucks almost. Yeah. I got some cash in there.
4610.04s:  I got some cash. Oh, God. Well, anyways, yeah. So that's what I thought was really interesting.
4620.36s:  Because because I really do think he's very transparent. And I like, I believe that when he said
4627.16s:  that I really do, I take him at his word. But that, I mean, it still wouldn't be crazy to not have,
4635.56s:  you know, it would not be crazy for him to have some cash in something else. Like you still
4643.08s:  got to live. I don't know if he has a family. But he does. And I'm curious how he would have built his
4649.48s:  shoey position. Because I was this was on the, he's talking here on the seventh. And then his
4655.08s:  last update is on three days later on the 10th. He's converted now all those options into shares.
4661.32s:  And then there was one or no, 13th, 13th, sorry, 13th. This is the last one. So yeah, that's a
4666.60s:  week later. He now only has 11 days to build a position in shoey that six percent of the company,
4676.36s:  right? Yeah. So how can he possibly do that?
4680.28s:  The one thing I think about the one thing I think about is using options as compared to buying shares.
4699.32s:  Right. Some of it could be options for sure. Because if he, even if he used in the money options,
4707.00s:  in shoey, I mean, but like I also imagine we would see the position. We can, we could see the
4714.44s:  position. So let's go back to this. Let's go to Chewy. And then what was the date range we were
4722.12s:  talking about? So it needs to be, if this is only a count he's playing with here between June 13th.
4730.52s:  Okay. And I think June 24th.
4734.60s:  Okay. I'm adding one day on both sides just in case.
4739.40s:  Okay. I think let me look at just 13G.
4752.20s:  Because it doesn't show the, does it show the basis in there or no?
4756.44s:  Yeah. It should.
4761.40s:  Because there it is. I mean, what's the, how it says he's not a cat?
4766.60s:  June is dude. Like every time I look at this guy's stuff, there's something in there that like
4772.44s:  straight up, no no cost basis. Sorry. I didn't think so. I think it just said like 9,000,000
4778.04s:  year equivalent, right? Which is he keeps meaming on Ryan Cohen as he's doing all this too,
4782.68s:  which is just so funny to me. Right.
4790.20s:  And the date, the date of this, so it was filed on the first, but the date of his June 24th.
4798.52s:  So there's 10,000 contracts there. This is, that's a million shares.
4807.08s:  There's 10,000 contracts here at the 30. That's another million.
4812.84s:  Well, something won't, no, I don't know. If he did a yellow update on the 13th, the 13th.
4822.76s:  These were the, these are, and these are afterwards, these are 25th. So I have to use the actual window.
4830.28s:  Because those wouldn't apply that window. The price moved a lot.
4835.08s:  So there's, there's a 10,000 at the 27th, which was a 220,000 dollar trade, but this represents
4843.64s:  a million shares. So far cry for 9 million. But that's, there's, there's a possibility, right?
4854.84s:  Because here's another 10,000. So that's another million. So between these top two, just pretending
4860.92s:  that these were all him. Those are on the 21st.
4864.92s:  This, the first one's on the 21st, then this other 10,000 is on the 24th.
4871.40s:  So let me sort this by size, actually. Yeah. So I see 10,000, another 10,000.
4880.44s:  Call this 5,000. So it doesn't look like he would have done it discreetly with options. But,
4888.20s:  again, pretending that at least some portion of this could, could be this, then it looks like
4895.96s:  he would have been able to essentially gain exposure to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 shares for less
4903.96s:  than a million bucks total. Somehow he's got to get 6 million more shares, right? And they're
4908.84s:  expensive. Still, I mean, they're like 20 bucks each at the lowest. It wouldn't, I mean, it wouldn't
4916.04s:  necessarily surprise me if my hypothesis there is that he could have unwound some of his game stop
4921.80s:  position. And then my expectation there would be that he would be doing that to enter back in.
4927.56s:  Like, I don't think he's trying to leave it, but it looked like he was trying to move something
4931.24s:  in Shui. That was my guess. Maybe we can't know what he does with his positions in the interim.
4938.92s:  I've told you before, from our perspective, he's never decreased his number of shares.
4945.96s:  Yeah, and it's funny when I made the video looking at the Chui position, I actually cited you
4950.28s:  teaching me about that because I do think I think that that's important, right? In terms of his
4955.00s:  tendencies, but yeah, because yeah, cash, cash had to come from somewhere. And nine million shares
4963.96s:  of Chui, what was it trading at 2653? You said? Um, I hope right here. The low was 2180.
4975.96s:  Which he definitely wouldn't have gotten in at. What was the, what's the midpoint like between the
4980.04s:  low and the high, just to in here was like 25, 25. Yes. $225 million position. Right. The other
4990.20s:  thing too is that like his last meme is, you know, he or one of his last ones, besides the Chui one,
5000.52s:  right? You know, you got the hat on still, which is perfect. But you know, he's,
5005.80s:  I listen, I'm baking for both of us. My fucking brain is cooking, but it needs to happen.
5012.68s:  He's, he's posting this meme as he puts in the bi order. I think that's abundantly clear.
5018.44s:  Because then he immediately that afternoon, Yolo updates with his nine million shares, right?
5023.08s:  So he's very intentionally here telegraphing that like he's calling a Samworm.
5030.44s:  Um, so would he then immediately dump shares after buying them?
5035.48s:  Like that would undo his effort to do this. And he's meaning on Ryan Cohen,
5042.76s:  kind of undoes his meaning on Ryan Cohen too. I think potentially, but he had a very light
5051.08s:  cast, again, this is, I can't believe it. I think he had six million in cash, right? It's all
5056.04s:  light cash position, but not light, right? Six million fucking dollars, but he had a, he had
5063.64s:  relative to him, small cash. So six million dollars in cash, a 225 million dollar trade in Chui
5072.92s:  goes on. If it's all shares, you can knock off, again, giving the benefit of the doubt, assuming that
5079.88s:  all of this was him, which again, that that's probably not super likely for all of this volume
5086.52s:  to be him. But again, some combination of it could be. So that gives us three million shares here.
5094.36s:  So then he essentially would still have about six six million one thousand ish shares.
5102.52s:  You're looking at all strikes, all X-rays look there or you're only looking at certain strikes
5107.24s:  next race. You're just looking at any large traits. Yeah, so what I'm doing, I'm sorting it by
5112.12s:  size and I'm essentially just assigning this top block of order flow all to him. I see, yeah,
5119.64s:  you've got a mix of expertise there in strikes. Yeah, it's kind of everything exactly. So I'm just
5123.96s:  ballparking it. But so if that gives him a residual position of six million one thousand shares
5131.56s:  at 25 that gives us a hundred and fifty million dollar position. He had six million in cash. So
5137.16s:  again, you can knock that down to one forty four. But that's got to come from somewhere. And I know
5144.20s:  some people were talking about maybe he was trading options around it. In order to come up with that
5149.16s:  hundred million, we would have absolutely seen that volume come through and we didn't.
5154.68s:  So yeah, just curious. I think we got to wait and see. We can speculate. Yeah, till the end of time,
5159.32s:  right? It is still fascinating. The timing. Yeah, I think that's a lot of the fun part is
5169.40s:  you know the dude thinks in layers, right? So to your point and based on the breadth of evidence
5175.56s:  that we've seen, what was it in this? You showed me the. It's over to the right. Scroll to the right.
5183.32s:  I think you're showing my screen right now on the screen. If you want to show your screen now.
5192.92s:  This is it, right? Like his his share positions. It's the column L.
5200.52s:  Can you guys see this or is it not showing you this? You're showing my screen at the moment. I
5203.96s:  will actually. Yeah, this is in my window. Oh, okay. I bet. Yeah. Yep. So and this is what you
5211.08s:  taught me is that if we go back all the way through his share accumulation, it's always been more.
5218.20s:  So that part's also hard to read between because we know in this time frame, he had to do other stuff
5228.76s:  in order to build the money that he ended up sharing with us that position on what is it?
5235.00s:  The second of June or the third of June? It's first post was on the second. Yeah. And it wouldn't
5239.80s:  have come from just buying and holding all of this that entire time frame. Yeah, I'm thinking
5246.92s:  I'm just going to go with like the easiest explanation, which is this dude's super duper smart and
5251.56s:  has made other monies and other accounts doing other things over time and came in to this lock to
5257.56s:  mode it like ready to go. You know what I'm saying? And I think that's reasonable. Like I think
5263.24s:  I think based on because the other thing people point out pretty frequently is looking at his
5268.04s:  older streams, which I went back to take a look at. And I mean, he had a shit ton of positions on
5273.16s:  an autonomous stuff. So obviously he says at one point, I was watching the January 13th stream,
5278.36s:  he said he was monitoring over a thousand stocks to some degree, which is that this is mad man
5285.32s:  level right from the jump to even try to trade a thousand things, right? Like that's nuts.
5290.68s:  I struggle I struggle keeping an eyeball on like 150 names.
5294.52s:  Yeah, yeah, he's operating on a level that is completely unbelievable.
5305.32s:  I was going to point out I did want to point out really quick here at the timing on his
5309.00s:  because there's always all this timing going on between his yellow updates and his tweets.
5312.92s:  So his most recent tweets were when he's buying the shares.
5317.32s:  Then this one seems to be the macro, I think this is macro room or I don't know who this is,
5320.92s:  this a tennis player. This one's on the 17th, which is when GameStop's volume drops off a cliff,
5327.64s:  right? And then this one is like this one about this movie Bruno, right? Where he's talking about
5333.96s:  going away, he's a he's a prophet sort of and like people don't like his prophecies.
5339.56s:  And Bruno, I believe in the movie, people say it goes away for 10 years. So he goes away for exactly
5344.60s:  10 days, calls the chewy spike to the day. This is when Chewie hit $40.
5351.40s:  And he had built his position in Chewie, you know, leading up right into that spike,
5356.28s:  especially on the 24th. And then he filed a 13G a couple days later.
5361.24s:  And then we didn't know what this meant at the time. But then this is like his 13G gets and then
5365.56s:  we look back and we're like, oh, that's we've been chewy. So it's like quick quick question.
5370.20s:  Yeah. Do you think that there is any forewarning with the Chewie position between those two
5377.56s:  components between here and here? Yeah. Well, there's the 35 emojis in the Missy Elliott meme.
5387.00s:  And the the dog is in one of those, right? So I don't have those 35 emojis off like on hand. I
5393.72s:  should give me a tap on the screen. If you give me a second, I had them. Yeah, give me one second.
5403.16s:  Yeah, I should probably just put them down here. And can we also just shout out the fact that
5407.80s:  we're talking about emojis from a Missy Elliott video? Right. Where are you in R.A.? And the
5415.88s:  in the whole of the fact that I've got all these memes here. I mean, sooner or later, you and him
5422.04s:  are going to have to go out for a beer like a seltzer water or something. And something. I feel
5427.64s:  yeah, I feel like I feel like that's probably fair at this juncture. I don't even this guy is
5434.68s:  operating on levels. Well, here's the other thing to think about. You're you're probably aware of
5439.48s:  this. So he's he's clearly so he's got his three personalities, right? He's got his crazy
5445.40s:  yellow posting account, DFE. He's got his roaring kitty Twitter, right? Where he posts tweets. And
5455.08s:  then he's got his live stream personality and his Keith Kill personality. But what's crazy to me is
5462.28s:  this idea that you can go all the way back to his means who is making back four or five years ago,
5471.40s:  or how many years ago was it now three or four years ago? Lost you there. There you are.
5480.04s:  And he was telling the story even back then because if you look back at his memes like for example,
5485.08s:  let me pull one up for you just to give you an example here. I don't know if you've gone back and
5488.52s:  watched these. This is like this is where things get so crazy to me. Check this out. Go grab a water
5495.40s:  real quick, but you can keep going. Let me find this one back here.
5509.56s:  There we go. All right. So for the folks watching along, Eric's grabbing the
5525.56s:  selsa water because he's addicted to those things. But roaring kitty's memes from even back in the
5531.56s:  day have the same characters. I think we've even got let me find. So here's green.
5539.56s:  Green represents DFE. So John Candy is DFE. Yellow are all the long holders on GameStop.
5547.88s:  And then we've got let me try to find this spot where we get there we go. Here's Ryan Cohen
5554.92s:  right here in blue. So he's been telling this story the whole time with his characters.
5560.12s:  And he's still just picked it up right where he left off three and a half years later. And I think
5563.56s:  that's absolutely crazy. It blows my mind. You guys can tell me in chat what you guys think about that
5570.36s:  whole thing. Hold this up again.
5574.12s:  So let me see where's Eric. We lost. We lost him. I'm trying to play up the chat right now.
5590.52s:  Oh, there you are. I was just I was just grabbing a reload on selsa waters, man. You I told you.
5596.12s:  It's like the I go through so much liquid, especially because like I typically intermittent fast.
5604.04s:  But the choice liquid is selsa waters, bro. Oh, are we watching this? Do you have it sharing volume?
5610.52s:  I was just showing it the volume. I'm not going to show I'm just showing that the characters
5614.84s:  are already defined. He posted this. No, it's going to say you should play it.
5619.32s:  Let's see. Can you hear it?
5621.88s:  Negative. Okay. When you when you go into share screen, there's a specific tab like if you're
5627.32s:  sharing your window. So if you unshare your screen and then share it again, there will be a thing
5632.20s:  that'll say share audio. I just wanted to show that this was posted all the way back March 30th,
5638.52s:  three years ago, right? This was his last like big meme that he posted before doing his final
5643.08s:  yellow update, double down in this position. But his characters are already all defined. Yellow
5648.84s:  are Wall Street Bets long haulers. That's us saying what's going on here? He's got he shows up as
5655.40s:  John Candy basically saying, you know, I can help you out here. This is his green is DFE.
5663.16s:  And then he points to his crew. And his crew was Ryan Cohen in blue because that's always been
5670.36s:  his color coding that he uses here. It later refers to the blue character is chewy.
5675.80s:  Starting all about games down here. You got to kind of watch it to get a sense for it. But I just
5680.52s:  think it's crazy that he had already there. We got to see the same guy. So they're going to cruise
5686.44s:  along and pick him up. So you know, this is the Wall Street best people saying, you know, my
5692.60s:  GME positions down. I bought in January. Then I got a diamond hands forever. But now what am I going
5697.56s:  to do? He's got the crying Michael Jordan emoji right here. And then basically he says here at the end,
5707.00s:  those risks and I can't guarantee anything. But I expect GameStop will be able to drive you to
5712.92s:  your cost basis. It's on the way to what I feel could be fair value. It took three and a half years.
5719.64s:  This is crazy, right? Crazy that he dude. It's nuts. It's absolutely nuts.
5729.32s:  Quick admin note from the chat. Dunn Oak says that they want to do a poll to see if you are
5735.64s:  cooler or Darth Vader, which Dunn Oak, I'm happy to do that. Just provided that we revisit basic
5743.40s:  manners. And if you phrase that like a human being, I'm happy to run that poll for you. In the meantime,
5749.40s:  there's a poll that's going right now, which is do we think RC will extend an offer to RK to join
5758.20s:  the investment board. 36% say yes, 64% say no. What say you Richard?
5766.28s:  I would say no. Yeah, I don't think that that would be a wise decision at all.
5772.52s:  I agree. I think that the two of them don't have any communication. They really shouldn't
5779.24s:  for legal reasons. I think that Ryan Cohen's got to be extremely careful. Everyone in GameStop
5784.28s:  has got to be extremely careful. The whole thing's under incredible scrutiny. Same thing with
5789.48s:  Warren Katie. So like he said, he's very honest and he's trying to be very transparent. I think
5797.16s:  that's what he's telegraphing every step of the way. And I wouldn't expect anything like that to happen.
5803.40s:  Yeah, I think that's fair and I think people might slightly misconstrue like the intentions of
5811.40s:  accumulating a lot of shares, which is the idea of conviction as compared to trying to move into
5818.52s:  leadership or run the board or something like that that seems slightly different. He also says on
5825.32s:  his stream. I've mentioned this one a lot because I just rewatch it. His January 13th, 2021 stream.
5831.40s:  I recommend everyone just watch it. But he says on there, he doesn't know how to run a company.
5836.12s:  Like he says, these aren't my areas of specialty. So like you just said, picking up a huge stake in
5841.00s:  a company doesn't mean you want to run it necessarily. We're going to involve them its runnings.
5846.92s:  Right. Yeah, I agree with you. It looks like Dun Oak remembered his basic manners. And we are
5855.56s:  ready to launch a new poll to see is Richard Newton cooler than Darth Vader.
5865.96s:  I'm curious. Darth Vader is Darth Vader cool. I was literally going to ask. I thought maybe there
5870.92s:  was some background to why the Darth Vader selection. But I'm a man of the people provided that the
5876.92s:  people are respectful. So I'm going to ask the question. Anyways, the poll is open. Let us know if
5882.12s:  Newton is cooler than Darth Vader. That's tough, man. Like, Newton, I got to be honest, man. Like
5886.92s:  I genuinely think you're an incredible person. But Darth Vader, like the force, he nuked Luke
5897.16s:  Skywalker's arm. Like that's have you cut a dude's arm off with a lightsaber? I guess we could
5902.44s:  start there. Have not. No, I'm not done that. And then I guess the only other following question
5907.48s:  is have you survived being thrown into magma and then gone on to walk around in a crazy suit?
5915.32s:  No, but the last three and a half years of GameStop. Very similar. Okay. So maybe there it is.
5921.96s:  And then also here's the other question we have to ask ourselves. What kind of collector Pokemon
5928.92s:  cards does Darth Vader have? And did you show us yet the ones you're showing me? Because we're
5933.96s:  going to take a look at those really quick. So we did pull a glaci on so far. Check that one out,
5939.32s:  everybody. So that's a. I have different Pokemon's. So we got the glaci on one, which is over here,
5949.96s:  which is pretty exciting. So I thought that was pretty cool because we had talked last time and
5954.60s:  we talked about how EVs are favorite and your wife's favorite. And then we basically immediately
5959.72s:  pulled out of I don't know if it's a pack from the ones you got us because we've got kind of like a big
5963.40s:  old box of packs. I was going to ask what was well anyways, I'll ask you afterwards. I'm curious what
5968.44s:  was in those compared to the I don't know shit about Pokemon beyond when I played it on Gameboy
5973.72s:  advanced. So you're so far we got a glaci on. So that's exciting. We'll see what else we get.
5979.56s:  And is glaci on is that like a standalone critter or is no so a glaci on evolves from an EV.
5991.64s:  So first you got to play an EV and then you can evolve it into a glaci on guys quick no vamp laws
6001.48s:  you are my hero. The platform is finally back up. Oh, there you go. This is tremendous news. A
6009.80s:  giant win really for me not so much for you guys because for me it just means I get to talk about
6014.68s:  options which we all know your boy can do. But let's do that. Do you want to pull those up and show
6020.60s:  people I do have to go in like 15 minutes if that's cool. Totally cool. So let me grab this.
6029.96s:  I'm just curious what you can show us with with GameStop options on your platform because I just
6033.80s:  learned so much earlier I found that to be so valuable. Dude this yeah I think we'll be able to
6041.64s:  dive a little deeper hopefully. I'm just checking real quick to make sure that the
6048.04s:  information is accurate. Yep it all looks good. Cool. All right.
6053.32s:  Oh there it is. Doesn't it just nice like being home like if you get back from a trip and
6063.64s:  do you get back to your house and you're like man it's just good to be back. So let's
6072.20s:  let's dive in. Now of no if anybody has any questions on the options chain as we go through
6079.16s:  this let me know there are some pieces missing like this isn't here for some reason typically this
6084.84s:  would be here. This is all blank. So we're working with partial information it looks like it seems
6091.48s:  like there's still updating it but we have enough to work with I think. Oh okay sort of. So one of
6099.48s:  the things I was going to show you guys was the expiration volatility which is actually kind of
6106.92s:  important so for that I'm going to grab a recent video that I did give me one sec just to kill
6116.28s:  the sound. It's going to be kind of like me inception but in here this was after the market closes
6125.80s:  and we look at the options chain right there. So you can still kind of see what this should be
6132.04s:  even though it's not populating. So what I noticed first is the primary
6138.28s:  explorations continue to maintain much higher volatility. So that doesn't inherently surprise me
6147.24s:  but I do find it somewhat interesting where the volatility is centered. So in this case the 19 July
6155.88s:  expiration is 139.5% vault. The following expiration goes down to 127 then down again to 120. So
6167.16s:  right now the market is pricing in more activity here in this expiration cycle essentially compared
6175.08s:  to anything else in the options chains so far. So this is not highly novel based on what I've seen
6184.28s:  so far as I've been following game stop essentially from the end of April into May but nonetheless
6191.80s:  I think is noteworthy at least in terms of trying to track where things are happening.
6198.36s:  So that's the first note and a quick note on what this means in case anybody doesn't know
6205.56s:  the implied volatility here implied volatility like we talked about this is what the market is
6211.00s:  pricing fall at and we're just kind of pulling it out and it's just a projection of expected volatility
6219.64s:  which is just movement. How much do we think something's going to move? If it has a higher percentage
6225.64s:  it means that we're expecting it to move more than other things you will notice however that some of
6232.20s:  these with lower percentages like this one out here shows 121% vol but a bigger dollar move.
6240.68s:  $8 it's because it's relative to the amount of time that's all. So you're showing the
6247.00s:  screen right now Eric I can't I don't know if I'm seeing what you're pointing at right now.
6250.68s:  It looks like I'm not which is really fortunate that you told me that because
6257.72s:  there we go this one there is a sell order. Yep so this is just me inception. So what I'm in
6267.72s:  it's kind of blurry I don't know how easy it is for you guys to see but what I'm showing you is
6274.36s:  that the expiration volatility for 19 July is high on a relative basis to everything else around it.
6283.64s:  So that just means the market is expecting movement is the punchline and then the other thing I was
6288.84s:  explaining to people because I've seen a series of questions about well why is the expected move?
6295.16s:  That's what's within that's what's within the parentheses is the dollar move and then out here
6301.40s:  is the implied volatility. So the question I've seen is why is it that this has a lower
6307.48s:  IV but a higher expected dollar move and the reason for that is because this IV is relative
6315.80s:  to the amount of time remaining. So even though this has a higher implied volatility it's relative
6323.72s:  to a seven day period as compared to 30 whatever day period. So just to clear that up for some folks.
6332.28s:  So the first thing I do notice is interesting volatility. It's not sky high and again this is not
6339.56s:  what we saw back in May. Back in May this was like in the 200s 300s it was astronomically high.
6348.04s:  So I think it's worth pointing out differentiation there. Now going back to the platform.
6355.64s:  Could I have anything to do with the idea of leading into earnings because earnings was due
6360.12s:  for early June? It's a good question. The expiration cycle that would contain that earnings release
6370.92s:  would have relatively higher implied volatility but it would be the cycle that
6376.04s:  may that offers exposure to the earnings release. Yeah. So right now what I see for open interest
6386.44s:  is there definitely is still pretty heavy call skew in terms of OI more calls than puts. We've
6394.20s:  seen this pretty persistently now. This is a lower gap than we've seen. So I think that is
6402.44s:  interesting to me. Now in terms of concentration of where these options are we can see that 19 July
6412.04s:  is absolutely the bell of the ball. This is the busy one. And you can see the next cycle that is
6418.20s:  most active is this 16 August. And again this will line up very beautifully with the primary
6423.32s:  option. Explorations this is literally it's for liquidity. If you're going through and you're
6427.88s:  trying to trade options the standard explorations especially in something like GameStop are going to
6432.60s:  be more liquid. So people that are looking to put on bigger positions will go out into these
6438.20s:  expiration cycles. The other thing I'll show you quick is volume from a call perspective is much
6447.32s:  higher than call side than put side. So we are seeing still a lot of transactions and building
6454.52s:  however there are a pretty noteworthy amount of puts going on as well for 19 July. So all of this
6462.92s:  boils down to we are going through and building out very clearly this expiration cycle that's
6471.08s:  essentially what a boil is down to. So question. Yeah man of course. So a boil is
6476.76s:  trade. A boil is trade would be selling cash to cure puts right. So that would show up in the
6486.12s:  OI for puts right. It would now we can detect how the market is leaning as they're establishing
6494.84s:  their put positions and I can show you how very quickly we go back to this one.
6502.36s:  And let's go back to GameStop and then we'll look at like the last week.
6514.68s:  There. So what I can do is I can look at the put side and I can look for put transactions that occur
6523.96s:  at a specific spot. We can determine if the option was opened via buying the option or selling the
6532.04s:  option if it transacts at the bid or the offer. So in this case if I want to see if people are putting
6539.16s:  on a bullish variation of a put meaning selling puts I can see the transactions that occur at or
6548.12s:  below the bid. So this is how I can isolate if we're selling or buying puts now I want to be very
6557.80s:  clear. This is still a kind of swag. This is still an assessment. It doesn't mean definitively.
6565.00s:  It just means the overwhelming probability is that being the case. So that's why we classify
6571.16s:  them as this. I just I think it's important to decipher for people the things that we can
6576.12s:  conclusively say for sure versus the things that we're taking as good of an educated guess. But
6581.08s:  this one is as close as you can get to something that's probably affirmative without it being
6587.40s:  you know 100% affirmative. So most of the put activity that we see that occurs at the bid or
6595.72s:  below for the last week. Relatively small positions. The biggest ones we see are at the 125's
6603.32s:  and their $100,000 positions combined. This looks like the same trade to me because it occurred
6610.20s:  so close to one another. And what this looks like is they submitted this initial order and then
6616.12s:  they moved it. But this is all the way out in 2026. So hard to tell what this person is attempting to
6623.32s:  do. If we limit this to the 19 July op-ex something a little more current. We see some transactions
6631.56s:  coming through here. But none of them are even over 100,000 like the bulk of this is probably less
6637.64s:  than $500,000. Easy. So not a ton of put selling going on. Now the other thing we can do quickly
6646.20s:  is to take a look at this theory about using calls. Maybe roaring kitty is selling calls right as part
6654.44s:  of against the shares to try to generate some sort of profit. And when I look at the overall
6663.00s:  transaction volume for the call side specifically with those kinds of orders which would be
6668.68s:  calls that are happening at the bid or below that would tell us that we're selling.
6672.68s:  There's some positions coming through but they're not massive either. So the total premium being
6678.84s:  pulled in here is not it's not crazy large. Now the other thing I wanted to do before you have to
6686.92s:  jump while we have a couple minutes is actually go back to this and we can model roaring kitty's
6693.16s:  position and we can actually see what he could have made. I think that would be fun.
6696.92s:  Okay. Yep. So yeah. So we're postulating that this would have happened. I'm sorry,
6704.36s:  remind me again the date window that we think it would be. Well Jackie said large call buying occurred
6713.24s:  twice but specifically May 1st, 2nd and 3rd. No, is this is this the there was a ton of call volume
6721.64s:  there. I thought we were looking at the gap to try to build the chewy position or is this the idea
6726.60s:  that this occurred back in the beginning of May. Let's do the games stop position. Okay. And but
6733.40s:  did we was one of your ideas that he used he was trading game stop to create enough capital
6741.40s:  to then roll into something else. Was that the idea from before? I don't I have zero idea how
6747.32s:  he could have built the tree position. I really don't know because I thought that's a that's a
6752.28s:  mystery to me. Okay. Because I thought one of the things we wanted to look at is the probability
6757.40s:  of him being able to turn the one he only had like five million dollars or so or he because his
6766.28s:  last yellow update yet 3.6 million. So I'm just saying let's round it to five and give him the
6771.16s:  benefit of the doubt. So if he starts got it. If he's got five million five million bucks on
6778.68s:  April 24th. Could you have turned that in three weeks into the 170 million dollars or so that he
6788.04s:  needs to buy all those thousand shares. And what was the what was the date the 24th to when?
6794.52s:  So April 24th would be his start date with five million bucks and then May 15th is his end date.
6801.32s:  Yeah. So what we can do really quick is just kind of simulate this. So we can go back into
6809.88s:  on demand. I don't know how well this is going to work with the platform where it's at and it's
6814.36s:  life right now. But we will see. So I'm going back to the 24th of April of 2024. And we are going to
6824.76s:  take a peek a boo at these options. And I'm what I'm going to do is build a highly advantageous
6834.60s:  position for him to see if this how this falls within the realm of possibility essentially.
6841.24s:  So we know from 24 April to 15 May. What was the high? What day
6849.16s:  a occurred that posted the high end stock price? The high was the 14th, but he could have bought
6857.32s:  weekly's. He could have bought and made an enormous profit buying.
6861.16s:  Strung, um, X-ray for the third or X-ray for the 10th and done extremely well. Okay.
6870.44s:  Yeah. So what I'm doing is I'm just figuring out the days that we had big price movements and
6875.96s:  I'm going to build again, like the most advantageous position I could think of for him,
6880.36s:  which what was the high on 14 May? It was like, I don't remember 64,
6886.20s:  683. That's far. Okay. So let's say that he bought maybe these 15s. So these are a 13 delta.
6898.92s:  And they're trading for 18 cents. Again, like we kind of know he didn't do this because I can't,
6904.52s:  I would have seen the volume come through for this, especially to put on a position this far out,
6908.84s:  but just to see even what's within the realm of possibility. So we have
6913.64s:  $5 million divided by 18 that tells me he could put on 277,000 contracts. Seven,
6923.96s:  seven, seven. So that's the position we're looking at. Two, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven.
6932.60s:  The reason why I'm using these options as being most advantageous to him is because
6938.12s:  even though there are really low delta, we know there's a giant move that occurs in this time frame.
6942.84s:  So this would give you an idea of what the compounding could look like if essentially we built
6949.48s:  a again near perfect position relative to the period that we know. So this comes in as you could
6956.44s:  tell at like 4.99 million, right? We're using essentially the full $5 million here.
6962.60s:  So now what I'm going to do is fast forward us to 14 May.
6970.52s:  And then we can just see what these options traded at and then we can see what his P&L would have
6980.12s:  looked like. Okay. So this would give him essentially a billion dollars.
6992.12s:  If he if he ticked it that way. So yeah. So if in the like most optimal scenario was able to put
7004.04s:  on a position like this in some degree, then it is entirely possible that he could have scooped up
7009.32s:  the capital to do this. Now again, we can kind of steal man the argument to a degree by changing
7019.40s:  what we're looking at really quick going back to unusual whales. We can go back into GameStop
7025.40s:  and we can look at this time frame again 14 May. You'd want to you'd want to look specifically,
7033.08s:  I think, at two windows, the 24th, 25th and 26th for big purchases of calls.
7038.92s:  The 24th of April April. Yeah, yeah, sorry.
7044.20s:  Let's look real quick. Let's see if there were any good buys there.
7047.56s:  And then let's kill that. And then let's kill that.
7055.88s:  Okay. So we have the tens being pounded several times.
7061.48s:  Yep. That's what Jackie posted was the tens. Well, actually, this is on the next week.
7068.36s:  Yeah. See his the tens up. So this is earlier.
7071.56s:  And these would fall right into that. I see 17 May 17 May. So I see one, two, three, four, five,
7085.40s:  six, seven,
7094.76s:  24 May seven.
7099.48s:  Maybe just call it eight. So I see eight, essentially 8,000.
7107.56s:  What about the May 17th though? Because those may 17th salt print it.
7111.80s:  Yeah, I'm using the yeah. So I included both of those up here.
7117.72s:  Okay. Yeah. So if we use both of those expectations just to clean this up a little bit.
7123.72s:  Yeah, he would have targeted those for sure. The 17th and the 24th. I don't think he would have
7128.12s:  target. He could have targeted May 3rd. Are there is there much activity on May 3rd? That would
7132.52s:  have been highly risky or April, no May 3rd. Let me see. Let me just sort of super risky.
7139.88s:  Oh, no. No. Doesn't look like I typically for the third.
7147.96s:  Yeah. And I think him trying to build a position in that would be really, really difficult.
7153.80s:  Well, then what I think he could have done is sold them all on the third to raise a whole bunch of
7160.04s:  sold sold all of what? He could have sold a lot of those when it peaked on the third because it hit
7172.04s:  a high on the third. Okay. 1745. He would have made it kind of money. And then he could have moved
7182.52s:  you could have moved up to the 30 strike that day. Let's let's take a look then. So
7188.68s:  if I give him credit for essentially pounding all of the tens, let's just look at the tens.
7199.48s:  And then again, we can literally simulate what this position could have yielded for him.
7204.76s:  So we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and 11, 12, all this, and this 13.
7225.00s:  So probably 14,000 contracts, ish, total.
7230.44s:  So that's only going to cost him.
7234.52s:  The, it looks like the average price here. Well, there's a couple expensive. We can do the math
7239.56s:  really quick. So 14,000. And then, two, 60, 227, 225, 220, 205, 200, 181,
7259.48s:  165, 155, 146, 145, 146, 145, 147, 165, 155, 21, 20, 20, 19, 19 times.
7285.88s:  So this would be like a 20, 20, how much cash did he have?
7297.40s:  Like 3.6 million. So he would have been way over if he did all of this. So then let's just give him
7304.04s:  credit then for 3.6 million worth. And then if we look at the average price just kind of by eyeball,
7312.76s:  I see, let's call it probably close to two. So I was going to say it. Yeah, we'll call it two.
7327.24s:  So let's say 3.6 million dollars divided by two, Hyundai is 18,000. So essentially,
7340.68s:  we're not fully calculating correct based on the average price. I think we're low-balling it
7346.76s:  a little too much. So then we could just say maybe he picked up maybe 11,000 contracts,
7355.88s:  ish. And then let's call it that that came in at 3.6 million. So 3.6 million divided by 11,000,
7368.28s:  by 100. Yeah, that comes in at like 327 or something like that. That seems a little high, but we
7374.52s:  can see just have an idea. All right, up over to this. And then we're saying that we think this
7387.16s:  happened on May or April 24th, 25th, 26th. So we'll just pick the middle and just pretend that we
7399.00s:  built the whole position all at once. This is the quote, like I, you haven't known
7404.52s:  to do how much I love this. This is like detective work with trades. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah. So we can
7413.08s:  say we think the expiration use transacting was a 17 May, but we're going to go to 3 May and
7420.44s:  pretended that he unwound there. And we were looking at the tens. So let's say that he built his
7427.24s:  position of like 11,000. And then let's say that the average price for the whole thing,
7433.80s:  I'll kind of all round it down like through maybe like 2.75. I think that's probably a little
7439.80s:  closer to accurate. And then we'll analyze that that comes out to like a $2 million outlay that
7446.84s:  keeps them within his range reasonably. And then let's move this out to 3 May and let's see what
7453.72s:  these would be worth. Let's see. Oh, dude, I'm like, I'm waiting with a baited breath.
7468.04s:  I want to know what this number is. 825,000. They lock with a, that's it. That's how much it would
7479.16s:  make. Yeah, seems so small. Well, the price went up to $17 that day though. Yep. And it looks
7487.56s:  like those tens traded for 375. Okay. That's not, that's not a big game. It's not massive. No.
7501.72s:  So what is he, so what if he built his, so Jackie's other thing he looks at is I'm,
7506.52s:  I'm probably badly quoting Jackie, what if he built his position right into that cycle then?
7511.00s:  What if he built his position on May 1st, 2nd, 3rd? You want to look at, yeah, let's look at purchases there.
7519.72s:  Let's take a look. May 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
7529.16s:  May 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
7531.64s:  We'd be looking at strikes from 10 to 30s.
7538.52s:  And then let's look at the call side hitting the offer. Okay.
7547.96s:  And then it looks primarily like the 17 May expiration is where I see the size coming in.
7554.92s:  Do you think that he would have spread out between multiple expirations?
7563.64s:  No idea. Probably pretty short dated though. I don't know.
7567.80s:  If he's, if he's going super yellow on a cycle happening in the short term.
7572.68s:  I would imagine then probably the 17s would be my guess. So if we look at the total size there,
7585.48s:  just again, I ball it. I see 1637. I see 1067. I see 85.
7600.04s:  And I see 959. Find any other big 17s here.
7607.16s:  So it doesn't look like blocks here, right?
7609.80s:  During this period of time. No. But there were blocks in that earlier period of time.
7613.80s:  So he could have held those all the way up into the 14th I suppose, right?
7617.48s:  The ones we've built out before.
7618.76s:  Yeah. And we can see what those would have been worth there.
7622.68s:  Yeah, then maybe he didn't do two periods of buying.
7627.56s:  Because yeah, that other one it just, it doesn't really seem on brand.
7634.92s:  What would these be worth?
7637.08s:  My not team. Yeah. Take a peek a boo.
7642.76s:  11,000 of them. We can even guide this down. Let's just call it too. Give them the bigger benefit of
7648.44s:  the doubt. 19 mil 19.6. See, that's not nearly enough though. He needs to build hundreds of
7655.72s:  millions of dollars. Right. That's that's why I was saying like what the responses from before.
7660.60s:  It's why I'm fairly skeptical of turning the $3 million into that.
7666.12s:  Like even if we give them like in this case, I'm giving them a perfect deal to doubt. Yeah.
7671.24s:  So I mean, even if we size this up, let's say he scooped the 18,000 corresponding size,
7677.96s:  which that's more than what even traded there. But that would get him to just 32 mil.
7683.88s:  Yeah, it just seemed like so, you know, questions as we kind of wrap up the stream here.
7689.48s:  Where did he possibly come up with $170 million to pick up 4.2 million shares?
7701.08s:  We don't know when he picked up those 4.2 million shares at all, right?
7704.44s:  It was first 4.2 million on top of the $800,000 he had. We do know when he bought his 20s.
7710.84s:  So that's we know he had to have had 60 some odd millions, 65 million dollars
7715.24s:  during the share offering to buy all those 20s. Where did he get all this money?
7722.36s:  I think there are two solutions. I can think of that are the simplest ones. The first one
7729.56s:  is he has money in another account somewhere. I think the solution beyond that is that he unwound
7736.60s:  some of his game stop position to acquire. That's the second idea.
7745.64s:  Yeah. Yeah, because I like that that that was like my biggest question as well as I was trying to
7754.20s:  conceive of what like it's not it's not a small amount of money. That's not easy to generate that
7762.68s:  amount of capital. So because basically what is it Andrew Citroen capital, what's his name? Andrew
7771.08s:  left. Yeah. He keeps asking the same question. The media is asking the same question. Good question.
7777.16s:  It's a fantastic question. Because like do I think that maybe he has money in another account
7786.68s:  potentially sure that's that's possible but is it a $100 million on top of the $100 million
7795.88s:  60 or whatever he had in his primary account? Could be but like that's I don't know that seems
7802.36s:  like a ton to me. I was thinking more that he might be siphoning out like 20 million maybe something
7808.68s:  like that that I think could be conceivable for somebody like him that would set up his family
7814.04s:  for life. But yeah, it's to me that the the simplest would be unwinding some of the game stop
7822.92s:  position. But to your point, I would find it really hard to believe that he would go through the
7828.92s:  effort of accumulating 9 million 1000 shares to then unwind it. But then it's also again I go back
7836.36s:  off of the the same thing of like who we're dealing with. And would he potentially build that
7842.04s:  position to essentially you know send the message to Ryan Cohen high five of them and then do
7847.32s:  something else? Not impossible either. So if you think about it based on what we looked at,
7855.08s:  what is your best guess on where the capital came from? Well, there's the curiosity too that
7862.36s:  is my share is my screen sharing right now? It is. So a curiosity pointed out is right here
7871.08s:  which is between these two updates. This one on June 3rd. Look at this cash position here.
7878.84s:  29.29.29.29.2 mil. Yeah. And then it goes up it takes up. And this is going to be interest earned
7887.72s:  on the end of end of May. It's pretty obvious. But the the e-trade accounts for a high for
7897.40s:  over having over a million dollars in your account only earns you 0.15%.
7902.36s:  The disrespect. Right. It doesn't earn you 5.5% like your money market is going to yield you or
7908.68s:  something else going to yield. And thus you put it you have to specifically put it into that
7913.00s:  vehicle. It's in this right here. My understanding is it's going to earn 0.15%. So if we look at if we
7919.56s:  just do simple math here and do. There's my calculator. So if we take how much that represents as a yield,
7926.44s:  so I'm going to do 29.409. And then we take away 29.276.
7937.32s:  In the meantime, Brad says a guy who loves trading is quite good at it. For three years,
7942.12s:  wasn't trading. His large cash reserve built up for this. I I agree with Brad's idea there.
7947.08s:  Again, I think the only crux to that idea is if he was being honest during that livestream,
7953.88s:  which I would that's again, I take him at his word. He's saying that that's his account and
7960.36s:  that's his cash. So we're working under the assumption of that being the case. But to your point,
7965.40s:  the wild card is kind of what Newton and I were recently talking about the fact that this could
7970.52s:  be money from somewhere else, but we're just kind of working off of what we can cleanly see.
7976.20s:  Right. If if he's got is this going to work out correctly? I don't want to. The number here
7982.12s:  bothers me, but if he's got this amount chilling in the account at end of May and it's been in
7987.32s:  there all month and then he gets point. This will be right, right? 0.15%. That would be
7997.32s:  the difference there, right? That's all working out correctly. But that makes sense. He would have had
8003.80s:  to have a bunch of money in there. I know people are saying he would have had to have a billion.
8008.28s:  Am I doing the math here wrong? So here's a billion dollars. If he was earning a yield of point
8015.08s:  zero, zero, or this would be one percent yield, but each rate only pays 0.15% yield. He would have
8024.04s:  got a huge dividend at the end of the month. So I don't see evidence of him having a billion
8028.52s:  dollars in the account unless I'm doing something. Yep. I agree with you. So he had. I still think that
8035.08s:  you would have seen it in the cash anyways. But he would have had in May 90 million maybe
8042.20s:  to play with. Yeah. And that I that I think makes sense at the start of this, right? Like because
8050.92s:  he came into this whole may move with a big bankroll. We saw in his initial position. What was it?
8058.28s:  168 million total or something like that? Well, this is perfect sense. This actually makes perfect
8063.88s:  sense because look at the start interrupt you. But we got the cash here. How much to the options cost?
8068.36s:  Like 65. So that's like the perfect amount. He just probably just rolled right into this with the
8074.68s:  money to throw down on the options. So he probably came into this with the shares already.
8080.92s:  Yeah. I think that that's fair because also we can see well, I don't know if he had the shares
8086.28s:  because the price of 21274. Well, you could have bought those and actually his cost basis
8092.52s:  were going way over that 15 minutes. I said, but the cost basis on those guys should have been
8098.52s:  if he held his previous existing shares, these guys had a cost basis of 1379. His new ones had a
8107.00s:  cost basis of 2127. Yep. He could have got these at any point along the way, right? Lots of times
8115.64s:  when the stock was at $21 going back. Just a good chart here. Oh, you're saying over the past three
8122.28s:  years. Yeah, he could have bought these at any of these. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. Yeah,
8128.12s:  I follow you now. Yep. I think that he could have built up $90 million in his account,
8134.52s:  accumulated a big position over time, came into this ready to yellow update after buying a ridiculous
8142.12s:  amount of calls. I don't know. Well, I think to your point though, that seems more probable than
8151.80s:  that capital being generated and like right at the beginning of. Yeah, from here to here.
8158.20s:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That seems unlikely. All right. Yeah.
8164.68s:  Yeah. Cool. I think that was that was a great game stop. Sash. Fascinating.
8169.96s:  Absolutely fascinating. Have an absolute blast doing these with you, man.
8174.36s:  So well, first off, I don't even know how many people we have hanging out. Looks like there's about
8179.96s:  455 people in here. So shout out to you guys for hanging out and chat with us about this.
8186.44s:  I think the idea for Newton and I is to keep a cadence doing these because we both enjoy
8191.96s:  taking a look. So we'll probably take a look at doing another one next week. Obviously,
8195.72s:  I'll catch up with you to see if that works. But if we do, it'll be same time, same place. We'll
8202.60s:  announce it for everybody. Newton is always, man. Thank you for coming in and dropping
8207.64s:  times the entire time. Super, super fun session. That was cool. Super fun to learn options.
8214.28s:  Learn from someone that knows a ton of bottoms. So thank you very much for sharing all your
8217.96s:  your knowledge. Yeah, dude. Absolutely. I love this stuff. So everybody else, we will see you
8223.80s:  throughout the week. OMG says set an agenda next time. Please, Bullshit. As if we go with a
8231.64s:  winds blow us, man, that's how this flows. But thank you guys a ton for hanging out and then
8237.72s:  we'll see you guys next weekend. Peace out. Thanks everybody. Thanks.
8243.88s:  And I think we double check.
