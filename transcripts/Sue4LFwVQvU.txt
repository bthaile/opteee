0.00s: Boom, we're alive, we're back, we got to figure it out.
3.84s: I'm going to tell you, man, I got to get a little better at figuring out these stream
9.08s: launches.
10.08s: Every time it's kind of like just seeing if I can get us off the launch pad and so far,
15.68s: I feel like we have a decent track record, I suppose.
19.92s: But yeah, you know, what else am I supposed to do here?
24.92s: I'm just out here doing my best.
28.92s: This is an old video for you.
34.12s: I have the swap video set up or if we need to reference that at all.
39.48s: But yeah, man, first off, welcome back.
43.08s: I'm actually really glad that we're kind of starting to do these regularly because one,
49.72s: it gives me a chance to continue learning from the master, which I literally love doing.
55.04s: And two, it gives everybody else a chance to kind of catch these periodic updates, right?
60.96s: Like as we're going through and seeing things unfold.
64.56s: So welcome back, stoked to have you.
66.96s: Yeah, thanks, Eric.
67.96s: Really appreciate it.
68.96s: And I, I think you said it really well.
70.76s: Like these updates are really good.
72.24s: I realized, you know, I have a habit of just doing a video every day with like what's
75.88s: on my mind.
76.88s: It's almost like stream of consciousness.
79.08s: But maybe by breaking it up every week with like, hey, we've gone through another week
82.36s: now since huge events in May and June in kind of like this quiet period where the stocks
88.04s: like kind of edging its way up.
90.32s: Everyone's looking for options activity.
92.08s: It's like, what's the story at right now?
95.56s: You know, what can we look forward to?
97.20s: What's the summary for the week?
98.48s: So I think it's good to do videos like this or, you know, yeah, man, kind of seconds like
102.76s: this.
103.76s: I absolutely love it.
104.76s: So right now for everybody's awareness, it looks like we have like 150 people on great
110.72s: to see everybody.
111.72s: They're coming to hang out and chat some game stop with us.
118.56s: So far, I'm not able to log into my platform.
121.76s: So we'll have to use some other tools when we want to start taking a look at some details.
127.52s: But that future us problem, you know, there's only so many things you can worry about at a
131.84s: given point in time.
132.84s: This is not one of them.
133.84s: So I figured a great starting point here is to lay a little more foundation on some of
141.36s: the components that make this thing tick the way it does.
145.36s: So last time we were talking about some of these different settlement rules, how they
150.00s: apply and how they interact with one another.
152.80s: Do you want to kind of provide a quick rundown of those to lay some of a foundation?
158.12s: And the reason for everybody else's awareness that's kind of learning more about the story
163.24s: or already aware of the story, but curious why this matters.
166.44s: Because when we're trying to think about the way that the product moves, a lot of the
172.12s: reason why it moves the way it does is because of these forces and these rule sets that
178.64s: underpin things.
180.16s: It's why whenever I'm doing videos and you know talking about game stop, I'm always
184.20s: very careful to say like standard technical analysis in my opinion doesn't translate
189.04s: well to something like game stop.
191.44s: And a lot of that has to do with the fact that there are all these other injects that
196.80s: absolutely have a dominating effect on price and volume.
201.28s: So yeah, I'd love to start with an assessment slash just general overview of these settlement
207.60s: rules.
208.60s: Yeah, do you want me to go ahead and share my screen?
210.88s: Is that cool?
211.88s: I would love that.
212.88s: Honestly, just because I hate seeing my big fat face.
214.96s: So whenever we do that, yeah, it gets me, that's beautiful.
218.36s: It just gets me right out of there.
219.76s: Perfect.
220.84s: Everybody.
221.76s: Exactly.
222.76s: Same here.
223.76s: So I think you laid the groundwork pretty well.
226.00s: I think that with other stocks, you probably wouldn't be ultra concerned about settlement
231.28s: because liquidity is pretty robust.
233.76s: You know, you're going to have lots of buying and selling on the stock.
236.48s: I think with something like game stop, the fundamental problem here is liquidity.
240.28s: With so many shares being dominated by household, especially in periods like right now, you
245.80s: can see tremendous volume.
247.20s: But where are the market makers and the broker dealers going to go to get shares?
251.52s: You know, if they don't, if they don't have inventory, they're going to need to push all
254.80s: the rules to the maximum.
256.00s: So we need to know how the rules work to get an understanding of why we see volume happen
261.00s: on particular days.
262.00s: You know, days where we consider nothing's going on.
264.56s: There's nothing going on the stock.
265.72s: Why would it suddenly have 100 million volume?
268.92s: Why would the price suddenly go up 5% here?
271.72s: 800% there?
273.28s: You know, so that's where the rules become really important.
275.96s: So I made a tab here on the sheet.
277.92s: It's the third tab over actually combined the two tabs before into one tab.
282.96s: So I've got all the rules for settlement here.
285.40s: I'll make this really big over here on the left.
287.96s: So under regulation, SHO, this is the settlement rules.
292.00s: We just recently moved into a T plus one settlement period.
294.56s: That means that, you know, I buy a stock today.
297.16s: It should be settled into my account by tomorrow, sending with cash.
300.04s: If I move cash from my bank of America account into my trading platform to take one data
305.72s: to sell one out, set a two, which is great.
308.64s: Supposedly, my understanding is options contracts still take two days to settle.
312.44s: Do you know if that's the case?
314.36s: I think it is.
315.52s: I think so too.
316.52s: Yeah.
317.52s: So right now, they're aligning off of the same settlement period.
321.44s: So I think that that's, I think it's two T plus one now, no?
325.88s: I think because it's a contract, not an actual equity, I think it's still on T plus two,
331.12s: but I might be mistaken on this.
332.24s: So that's a curiosity.
334.36s: The chat, the chat might know and I also think I have a download of the actual release.
342.72s: So let me dig that up in the meantime.
345.16s: Sure.
346.16s: But, you know, under regulation, SHO or Reg show for short, there's two particular rules
351.68s: that are really of interest, rule 203 and rule 204.
355.16s: They allow market makers to fail to deliver trades after T plus three and T plus six.
360.52s: And we can actually see that in action on the stock.
363.40s: What's really hard here, and I think that there's a lot of people that get frustrated on
366.76s: the forums because people are really caught up right now on roaring kiddies by a four million
371.28s: in shares.
372.28s: But there's a reason to be caught up on that trade.
374.48s: That's a huge trade, right?
376.36s: And we get precious few moments in time where we get to see a huge trade and no one.
383.36s: Right.
385.64s: And Cohen bought in in 2020.
388.20s: So we actually have his trade dates from his disclosures.
392.88s: And so we can actually see a rule happening here, which is he bought on December, right
402.12s: here.
403.12s: He bought on December 17th, quite a few shares across four days.
407.60s: But you don't see gigantic price improvement until T plus three, especially like basically.
412.08s: So you can actually see that happen in real time here.
414.88s: That's why people are still curious about roaring kiddies purchases, not only do they match
419.20s: the size of Ryan Cohen's from back in 2020, but it gives us dates through which to follow
424.48s: to see if the rules can out the way we expect them to.
427.36s: But the one of interest is rule 204.
430.12s: They grants calendar days plus 25.
432.72s: And so down here, I basically mapped this out.
434.56s: You can see like, let's say you've got a trading date like December 22nd.
438.80s: The market maker should clear those trades by T plus three or T plus six.
443.00s: So those are trading days, so in days.
445.04s: But the calendar days include the weekends, but not market holidays.
451.52s: So then you want to count those out 35.
454.24s: And they absolutely have to close out by C plus 35 if you want to call it C plus 35.
460.24s: So that's basically how all those rules work.
463.60s: It's just what people are looking for now is, okay, so we know a big trade happened probably.
470.12s: You can tell me what you think about this.
471.28s: I think he sold his options on the 12th.
476.60s: And then bought the shares the following day on the 13th or sold most of the options like
481.96s: 80,000 of them here and then 40,000 more sold those there and then bought all the shares.
487.64s: So what everyone wants to know is are we going to see because we didn't really see T plus
492.36s: three or T plus six produce very much.
494.84s: There is volume, but not a lot of price improvement.
497.96s: So are we going to see something on 35 calendar days, which is basically going to be somewhere
503.48s: out here in the days to come.
506.72s: So does that give people a good enough idea on how settlement should work?
510.32s: Is that pretty clear?
511.32s: Yeah, yeah, that's super helpful.
513.52s: And I think that it paints a really important picture on why it matters, right?
519.72s: Because there's a lot of different perceptions of what it looks like.
523.72s: And also, by the way, for option, it is T plus one.
527.88s: Yeah.
528.88s: So I grabbed, I threw a link in the chat for everybody.
534.40s: It's from the SEC and the Bolton's from 27 March and starting.
541.68s: I think it's 28 May if I'm not mistaken.
544.04s: Yeah, 28 May.
545.44s: They switched over to T plus one.
547.52s: Perfect.
548.52s: I'll, I'll try to remember to, I'll just add a point to do this.
551.76s: Grab that link and just, I've been, I ended up starting.
553.68s: I started linking everything on the sheet so people could just find us.
557.60s: So I'll just link.
558.60s: That's, yes, we can.
560.60s: And I'll throw it in the chat here too.
562.60s: All right, thanks.
563.80s: Yeah, man.
565.52s: So the, the hard part with calendar days is people forget about the market holidays.
571.40s: So this is a really good example to give because there are market holidays on this one.
575.20s: So like, let's say, Rory and Kitty did buy.
577.88s: And I think it's pretty obvious he bought on the 13th because that's when he was doing
580.84s: the sandworm.
583.76s: Dune meme, right?
584.76s: He, he posted the, the dune meme on Twitter.
588.32s: And then the stock start, starts rising immediately.
590.68s: It's like who just bought a whole bunch of shares.
593.12s: Pretty obvious.
594.12s: So what we want to do is we want to look at what I do is I just actually pull up a calendar.
600.44s: So if I look at June 13th, you guys could all do this right now if you're following
603.52s: the one, look at June 13th.
605.28s: That was a Thursday.
606.68s: Then you go out five weeks.
608.00s: So one, two, three, four, five should be the 11th, right?
613.44s: Is that right?
615.44s: Let me try this again.
617.32s: June 13th.
618.80s: There'd be the 20th, 27th, fourth.
622.08s: Oh, sorry.
623.08s: And then we're going to go the 18th, right?
626.80s: The 18th.
627.80s: Yeah.
628.80s: All right.
629.80s: So yeah, that'll be, it should be 25 days though on here, trading days.
634.64s: So now the way to do it.
637.32s: From here.
641.32s: No, so that's not a good way to do it.
643.76s: So you want to go for it.
645.76s: We have to add another column in here for you, like between AMB that auto populates it for you.
651.40s: I always thought about doing that.
653.08s: I'm just like, that's going to be such a nightmare to actually add onto the sheet though, because
657.56s: you'd have to go back and do so much.
662.16s: Well, I see.
663.16s: I was just like, it insert it and then have it calculate X number of trading days from
667.12s: whatever your trigger date is.
668.92s: Right.
669.92s: But it's tricky because so like if this is the day, right?
673.08s: So I've got it highlighted now.
674.12s: Here's the trade date.
676.08s: Here's when calendar days plus 35 is, however, there were two holidays between there and
683.88s: there, right?
685.08s: And those don't count.
687.56s: So you got to actually add two more days.
689.64s: So like, yeah, I would going to be.
692.12s: Yeah, I'm almost pot well, I don't know about Google sheets, but I'm almost positive that
698.24s: you could import like an actual trading day function.
702.84s: Right.
703.84s: Yeah.
704.84s: So, so so basically everyone's looking at a bunch of days in the time to come.
709.44s: It really matters though, because maybe to get to one of the other topics you want to
713.36s: talk about is we have incredible options interest on July 19th, right?
719.76s: So if though if this trade still needs to be settled and is possibly going to be occurring
728.08s: sometime before the 22nd, then that means the 19th is a really interesting day, right?
732.64s: We're seeing lots of options interest there.
734.56s: So do you want to maybe talk about that a little bit?
736.76s: Yeah, I wish.
739.08s: I wish the platform was up and running so that I can like walk people through it.
744.28s: I'm trying to think of the easiest way to show you guys this because there's a lot of
749.04s: things that I would try to show you.
751.64s: Maybe let me see if the platform comes up in a little bit and then we can pivot back
755.52s: over to the options.
756.52s: I'm hopeful that maybe they're just updating it and it'll come back up in a little bit.
762.24s: This is like easy to look at just cursory, right?
765.40s: This experience just happened.
766.76s: Yeah.
767.76s: A lot of calls expired in the money, which is wonderful for the stock if you're long on
771.84s: it.
772.84s: Should produce lots of buying.
774.00s: This is next week.
775.56s: And this is like something like 40% of the OI going forward, all concentrated on the
781.80s: third week, a third Friday of July.
784.12s: Yeah.
785.12s: And again, none of this is financial advice.
788.44s: You know, that's a near-dated option that's extremely risky.
792.00s: But there's a lot of people front-loading options into next week.
795.44s: So I'm curious what you think about this because this seems unusual to me.
800.32s: I think, well, which part seems unusual to you?
804.28s: Just to have such a concentration here with such a near-term expiry.
813.16s: That's essentially been the standard so far for GameStop hands down.
818.12s: Okay.
819.12s: Yeah.
820.12s: So what you'll find in general in most products is the front standard explorations are almost
826.92s: always the busiest.
829.04s: And then there can be pockets further out of other things that are showing activity.
836.16s: But the vast majority of instances, you'll see the overwhelming activity in the front
842.44s: explorations.
843.44s: Now, what I find so fascinating about GameStop's options in particular, though, is the variance.
852.00s: That part is very interesting where you can see the options chain.
858.24s: Actually, if you go back to that other screen, well, I liked it background.
867.68s: Yeah.
869.44s: So you can eyeball this and you can see inherently where the standard explorations are.
876.08s: Like just look at the numbers that are much higher than the, exactly, like you can straight
882.04s: up eyeball it.
883.32s: Now one of the things that's so interesting about GameStop, though, is the variance between
891.00s: further out explorations and closer ones because to your point, your eyeball of seeing,
897.00s: like, heavy near-term volume or OI in the option space, that's, it's not inherently anomalous.
904.84s: That's pretty normal.
906.00s: But what is fairly anomalous is how big it is comparatively front versus further out.
913.28s: But I've noticed that essentially being like a rolling trend with GameStop.
919.40s: It's actually been one of the most interesting things about the product to me is like, I've
924.76s: talked about the way that I buy options typically.
927.48s: I've shared a video a million times.
930.72s: I'll share it again.
931.72s: And it's because I think a lot of people light money on fire with the way that they buy
937.20s: options trying to trade something like GameStop and specifically hear what confounds
941.84s: me as going so short term perpetually because those options are going to decay the fastest.
948.48s: And they will experience more of a move if you do eventually get a move in your favor.
954.88s: But if you don't, they decay pretty fast.
958.36s: So yeah, the kind of a meandering answer.
962.88s: The short one is seeing the active options being really focused in these near-term
968.84s: explorations that doesn't surprise me.
971.40s: Seeing it centralized in 19 July doesn't surprise me because that's a standard expiration.
977.72s: And the thing that does interest me though is just how big of a variance there is between
985.16s: the front explorations and then like the next month expiration.
989.28s: Having a gap that's typically like 100,000, like several hundred thousand O.I.
994.64s: Difference, that's interesting to me.
998.12s: Cool.
999.64s: Yeah.
1001.96s: So I think what's also interesting is the community is largely avoided options because I think historically
1009.64s: they got burned on out of the money options.
1012.60s: I'm sort of curious what you're thinking about.
1014.92s: It just seems like in this last couple of months, there's been far more in the money options
1020.44s: than I remember there ever being because I could remember this maybe just like me
1024.76s: misremembering or wanting to remember something.
1026.76s: But it seemed like every week, you know, people would be bummed out because they would see
1032.28s: all these out of the money options on a Friday.
1035.48s: But these days it seems like there's more landing in the money.
1039.00s: So maybe do you think maybe people are learning picking up on some stuff?
1043.56s: Yeah, that's a great question.
1046.56s: And I'm not exactly sure because I don't have a great understanding of the standard purchasing
1052.72s: behavior before to like draw what I would consider to be a more direct comparison.
1058.64s: But if I were to take a swag at it, I think a big part of that also comes down to people
1064.32s: learning more about the products themselves.
1067.60s: So for example, if there's a lot of folks from like the ape community that are trying
1073.36s: to pitch into this idea of creating a gamma ramp, well, you need a mix of in the money
1078.72s: and out of the money options to start that process.
1081.76s: So I think there's something probably coming from that angle.
1086.72s: I also think that there's another angle that just focuses on how much raw dollars you
1093.68s: can make.
1095.08s: So there's a lot of reasons to go in the money.
1098.12s: Like typically when I'm buying options, the overwhelming majority of instances, they're
1102.92s: greater than 60 days out.
1104.60s: A smaller subset sometimes will be 30 days out that like I typically won't go same week
1110.08s: unless I'm playing something very short term that I can look at decisively.
1115.08s: But I most of this time will be a little bit further out in time and it's almost always
1120.84s: for the base position at the money or slightly in the money.
1125.88s: And it's because you get a better dollar for dollar move with the underlying at a higher
1131.60s: delta.
1132.60s: And again, if I can get my platform to wake up, I can walk you guys through kind of an
1137.08s: example that will help you visualize that concept a little more in depth.
1142.28s: But the thing, the way to think about it is out of the money options are cheaper.
1147.64s: They will compound as a percentage return much better than in the money options.
1152.80s: They require a bigger move in order for them to like really start printing for you.
1158.88s: And they will have slightly different theta decay tendencies depending on what the delta
1165.00s: is and stuff like that.
1167.20s: So my general approach to most things in life is actually balance.
1172.60s: So I don't inherently do just one.
1175.76s: I typically will have a base position little further out in time, typically at least slightly
1181.32s: in the money, if not deep in the money.
1183.88s: And then I'll add what I call kicker options.
1187.00s: And those are near term expiration further out of the money.
1191.52s: And that's really to capture a magnitude of a move if I get it because those options
1197.32s: can compound super fast.
1200.40s: But they are fighting a steady steady headwind of theta decay.
1206.48s: And unless you get a big move real quick, they become worth less super fast.
1211.96s: So let me run because I haven't watched your I should have watched your video about
1215.52s: game stop options.
1216.52s: But let me see if I'm learning correctly from you.
1219.00s: So you know, this is our standard expiry for July.
1223.16s: Here's our standard expiry for August.
1225.28s: And then we've got September on October.
1227.36s: So this is about three months out.
1230.52s: So I look for something in the money here as like my base position.
1236.68s: So right now we're at $26.
1239.24s: So we're going to choose something around one of these strikes here.
1242.68s: And these are there.
1245.08s: Go ahead.
1246.08s: Does this have delta?
1248.36s: This is just Yahoo finance.
1250.00s: I may very adept trader that uses very powerful tools.
1254.64s: Yeah.
1255.64s: Yeah.
1256.64s: Yeah, I think that that's okay to ballpark it there.
1262.16s: Let me see real quick.
1263.16s: I have another platform I can also look at what expiration are you in right now?
1266.60s: I am in October.
1267.80s: Got it.
1268.80s: Yep.
1269.80s: So those are 98 days out.
1272.08s: That's a little far from where I would go for something like game stop specifically.
1276.28s: I would probably favor like 20 September.
1278.52s: Okay.
1279.52s: The only reason for that is like again, game stop is I say it all the time.
1285.52s: It's different.
1286.52s: Like you have to do things very differently with this thing.
1289.96s: And when I look at when I look at the options here, they're not they're not crazy priced.
1300.52s: I would probably be looking at at least like a 65 delta, but then you have to find liquidity.
1306.20s: So the most liquid choices I see look to be about either the 25s.
1312.40s: That's a really, really heavy strike.
1315.64s: There's 2600 rely there.
1317.96s: So that tells me that there's transactions in there.
1320.64s: What three there bid at 515 offered at 550.
1324.92s: So that would be fine.
1327.16s: I personally would probably want a slightly higher delta because those options are a lot
1332.96s: of extrinsic value.
1334.36s: So those are also going to decay a little quicker than I would prefer.
1337.60s: And so we're waiting by that.
1338.92s: Let me just slow down a second.
1341.44s: So since the strike is 25 and the price is five, you're basically you got to value this
1347.56s: at basically like 30 bucks and the stock isn't at 30 bucks yet.
1351.40s: Your $4 short of that.
1352.48s: So $4 worth of that is like extrinsic right now wrapped up in theta.
1357.56s: Yeah.
1358.56s: So the way to think about the calculating the amount of theta in the options, it's the
1363.64s: difference between the current price and the strike price.
1367.16s: So current price is 20604.
1369.44s: That strike price is 25.
1373.08s: So an option price has two components intrinsic and extrinsic value.
1379.72s: Intrinsic value simply put is how far in the money it is.
1385.40s: So in this case, it is $1 and $4 cents in the money.
1390.48s: So if we take the midpoint between the bid and the ask to value the option, let's just
1395.60s: call it a 525 just for ease.
1400.32s: So you would take 525, that's the total value of the option.
1404.68s: You would subtract out your intrinsic value, which is a dollar and four cents.
1410.80s: And then the remainder of that is extrinsic value.
1414.08s: So that would be $4 and.
1418.76s: $221.
1419.76s: $4 and $2 and $2.
1421.76s: Yep.
1422.76s: And that's all basically now subject to theta decay, right?
1425.88s: Exactly.
1426.88s: That's all going to slowly decay away.
1430.56s: And the good part about being further out in time is you decrease the rate of theta decay,
1439.72s: but you're paying more upfront.
1442.32s: So more total theta can decay.
1446.32s: Right.
1447.32s: Because you paid 525 exactly to buy you that time.
1453.72s: So yeah, perfect.
1456.48s: And it decays exponentially, right?
1458.36s: So like on the on the near term, you're only going to lose a little bit of that extrinsic
1464.08s: value.
1465.08s: But then like let's say six months, this is three months out.
1468.92s: Let's say a month has gone by.
1470.16s: Now it's going to accelerate.
1471.76s: Two months go by.
1472.76s: It's going to accelerate a lot.
1473.76s: And then as you get closer and closer and closer, there you go.
1475.76s: You got to write there on screen.
1477.56s: So yeah, I totally stole the screen share from you.
1482.60s: But you actually do a great job explaining this exact graph.
1486.04s: So what this in the top right is this is just showing you the behavior of the Greeks.
1491.04s: But what you'll notice is theta decay starts to really accelerate once you start getting
1496.88s: within 60 days to expiration.
1499.92s: And then it becomes highly exponential within 30 days.
1504.64s: So and this simply put is because options, they have to make a choice.
1510.76s: All of these out of the money options, they are going to go to zero.
1516.56s: They have no intrinsic value.
1519.28s: So as you get closer and closer to expiration, these are going to move way, way faster.
1525.28s: So that's why you see this accelerate to that degree.
1529.20s: So when I'm using something, I'm just using ORETS.
1531.92s: Because again, I don't know if I've mentioned but my platform is now, it's kind of like
1535.56s: if I don't have my pants on, like not having the ability to open the platform is like literally
1540.60s: you're wearing pants right now?
1542.28s: Yeah, well actually I'm not wearing short shorts, but.
1547.16s: But so if if I look at these, there's a bunch of things I'm trying to balance.
1551.64s: The first thing is I want to be far enough out in time to give it time to work.
1556.96s: However, I know the further out in time I go, the more expensive they get.
1563.48s: The next thing is if I do not get a high delta being further out in time, I'm not going
1572.60s: to experience as much of the move because.
1575.24s: So experience delta for me.
1577.32s: What's delta?
1579.08s: Great question.
1580.28s: So there are a handful of Greeks that we care a lot about.
1585.88s: Delta is one of them.
1588.28s: So delta does a few things for us.
1591.04s: The high level view of what delta does is it tells us the rate of change of an options
1597.60s: premium per one point move in the underlying price.
1601.24s: So that means in this case, if game stop goes up by one dollar, these options, CETRUS
1609.52s: Parabus, everything else remaining the same will go up by 64 cents.
1614.60s: That's what game is.
1615.60s: Or I'm sorry, delta.
1617.28s: So delta tells us the rate of change of an options premium.
1621.88s: You can use it for other things.
1623.32s: It's kind of a back of the napkin tool for probability of in the money, probability of
1626.76s: touch.
1627.76s: So in like layman's terms, if game stop goes up 1% tomorrow, your option will go up 1%,
1635.24s: it'll go up 0.6%, 4%.
1638.24s: It's based on a dollar move.
1640.20s: So it's not based on percentage moves, but yes, it would essentially move a fraction
1645.68s: of the dollar move.
1647.16s: Okay.
1648.16s: A question.
1649.16s: I have another question.
1650.16s: Yeah.
1651.16s: So that's algorithmic, right?
1652.64s: That's controlled by options pricing, which is inherent within how their schema works.
1657.16s: But what if demand comes in suddenly and like wipes out all the sell orders on that particular
1662.88s: strike, who would you sell it for a higher amount because it's just in demand at that
1667.68s: moment?
1669.08s: So typically if an option comes in really high demand like that, the bid ask spread would
1676.08s: tighten.
1677.16s: So you would gain a little bit more liquidity actually.
1680.92s: Now if there's a ton of demand, because one of the things to always remember with options
1685.08s: is their derivatives, their entire existence is derived from an underlying asset.
1692.08s: So if we're looking at it in a vacuum, just in a vacuum, and the options are moving
1698.84s: a lot and we're just pretending for whatever reason the underlying cannot move, the underlying
1703.24s: is frozen, then there would be observably little change in the value, the price of those
1709.44s: options.
1710.92s: This is an vacuum, which is not reality.
1714.56s: Because as that's happening, the underlying is probably moving for one reason or another,
1719.84s: which then creates kind of this cycle that we can see where as people are piling into
1726.04s: options, the market makers typically are the other side of the trade, they will start
1730.40s: hedging their positions by using the underlying and other options, which can move the underlying
1735.88s: itself.
1736.88s: So there can't really be a buy supply in balance because if a lot of buy orders come
1744.72s: in for a particular strike and expiry, the market makers will just write contracts for
1749.32s: that.
1750.32s: Yeah.
1751.32s: And if it's in that scenario where it's very one-sided order pressure, they can widen
1760.80s: their bid-ask spreads to manage their risk.
1765.32s: And in that case, once I'm sorry to keep interrupting the questions.
1770.48s: So in that case, like let's say, like Rory and Kitty came in and wiped out or bought all
1775.44s: the 20 strikes for June 21st, I believe it was.
1780.92s: If you had already held those particular contracts, would you have seen a sudden surge in the
1787.24s: price of your options that have been able to move on that beating the market makers to
1790.80s: it?
1791.80s: Or do they basically beat you to the punch?
1794.40s: It would be the market makers leading the change in the price based on their assessment
1800.08s: of the order flow.
1802.08s: So you wouldn't see the price move unless it was adjusted by the market makers.
1807.40s: Again, looking at this in a vacuum, pretending that the underlying isn't moving, looking
1811.72s: at just the options.
1813.52s: Okay.
1814.52s: Cool.
1815.52s: It's one of the things to always keep in mind with something like options or really
1822.64s: any other derivatives, the market makers are very much slaved to the order flow.
1827.84s: So if there's persistent buying, they have to continue creating, providing a market,
1834.28s: right?
1835.28s: That's how they make their money.
1836.28s: So they're providing a market, providing a market to this one-sided order flow.
1838.80s: Well, they have to continue hedging all this risk.
1841.36s: Their ideal scenario would be to have a bit in an offer and you want to buy options.
1847.92s: I sell them to you and then I immediately turn around and neutralize and flatten them
1852.48s: and buy them from somebody else that's selling them, right?
1855.00s: And essentially collect a bit ask spread.
1857.16s: And if we see really strong one-sided order flow, it actually puts them in a terrible
1861.64s: spot because they now have to accumulate massive inventory and nobody's offloading their
1868.36s: risk, which is what they would prefer to be able to do.
1871.52s: So in those instances, they can absolutely widen the bit ask spread and they can say,
1878.56s: the bit ask spread is an expression of what they're pricing volatility at.
1884.00s: But then it's also an expression typically that it would be a size, right?
1887.76s: So they would say, I'm bid at 515 for 100 lots.
1892.96s: I'm offered at 550 for 500 lots.
1896.20s: They can offer different sizes and that's to help them manage their book, right?
1901.12s: So in that case, they're really trying to work on the offer side.
1905.76s: That's why they're giving you more size there.
1907.88s: And they're trying to be lighter on the bid side and that's typically a way for them to
1912.12s: manage their book.
1913.96s: So are you seeing this behavior now?
1915.60s: Are you seeing an acceleration of options buying on GameStop and then therefore a widening
1922.68s: of the spreads?
1924.68s: It's not a universal widening of the spreads.
1927.12s: But one of the things to always remember is on a relative basis, you can always come
1933.68s: up with kind of like an assessment of what's something that's liquid, right?
1937.40s: So let's check out just an example really quick in Spy.
1942.16s: And we'll go to those that same expiration cycle, which I think is here.
1947.48s: And we were looking at like a 64 delta option.
1951.00s: The reason why I use 64 delta is or something like that is to normalize across the different
1956.20s: products for the basis of a comparison.
1959.00s: So right here.
1960.24s: So these options, they're bid at 26 offered at 34.
1966.76s: So the process to like assess liquidity of something, I would literally take 1734.
1972.88s: I would subtract 1726.
1975.88s: That gives you the bid ask spread, eight cents.
1978.36s: You can now take that bid ask spread of eight cents divided by the strike price.
1983.52s: Right.
1984.52s: Multiply that by 100.
1986.16s: Now you have a percentage and this is normalized to everything.
1989.24s: So the percentage of the bid ask spread here of the strike price is 0.014%.
1996.36s: So even though is that automatically calculated somewhere, do you see that showing up somewhere?
2001.68s: No, I do it.
2002.68s: Oh, okay.
2003.68s: Yeah, they don't they don't normalize it for you.
2006.08s: What I've learned in a lot of instances, they don't make this stuff easy for some striking
2012.84s: reason.
2014.00s: We also use lots of silly terms when we're talking about this stuff.
2018.44s: So I'm finding it interesting that you target the 64 delta.
2022.92s: Is that common because look how heavy the activity is there for the spy?
2027.32s: It's not so much that it's a 64 delta.
2030.24s: It's more that it's a round number.
2032.00s: You'll notice that the 50s, right, big number.
2036.00s: Humans are hilarious.
2037.16s: We're so predictable.
2038.36s: 560s, bigger number, 565s, bigger number, right?
2042.16s: So five dollar increments.
2044.08s: It's just a very natural cognitive bias.
2047.60s: And then the other thing is if there's the start of order flow to an option, it's typically
2052.56s: followed by it.
2053.56s: So like, let's say for example, I wanted to buy an option and for whatever reason I wanted
2057.00s: something around a 60 delta, I'm going to gravitate to this one because there's more
2061.68s: liquidity here than everything else.
2064.12s: And everyone else is doing the same thing.
2065.88s: So it becomes like a kind of like a ball rush or a like a crowd mentality.
2071.20s: It can be.
2072.20s: It's really more in pursuit of liquidity though.
2074.08s: It's not that, oh, I think other informed traders are going here to 555.
2078.52s: So I want to do what they're doing.
2080.24s: It's more, I don't want to pay as wide of a bid-ask spread.
2084.92s: So I'm going to do everything I can to keep this as small as possible.
2090.68s: Now the market's closed.
2091.80s: So I mean, realistically, this has a similar size market, right?
2095.84s: So you can easily go here at the probability of you getting filled here versus here at
2100.32s: the same bid-ask spread is actually very low.
2102.52s: You'll probably get a better fill on the 555s.
2105.20s: So just finishing the example quickly, going back to GameStop looking at these 64s.
2111.04s: So right now and other people can try this, right?
2113.96s: So you just take the 550, you subtract 515.
2117.56s: That gives you 35 cents wide.
2119.76s: You divide that by 25 multiplied by 100.
2124.32s: Your bid-ask spread as a percentage is 1.4%.
2127.60s: As compared to zero point zero, one 4%.
2132.64s: Oh zero.
2133.64s: So huge.
2134.64s: Over some massive.
2135.64s: Massive difference.
2137.28s: That's because it's a volatile product.
2140.76s: If things are more volatile, they will have wider bid-ask spreads.
2145.20s: It serves as kind of like a natural breaking system for markets.
2149.76s: So there's just another thing for people to be aware of.
2153.12s: If you're trading small contracts and you're not trading a ton,
2156.52s: it doesn't necessarily matter a bunch.
2158.84s: But it will explain to some degree why you will find people central again.
2163.92s: 25, 30.
2166.24s: It's the same thing.
2168.64s: It's the same mental tendency to look for these round numbers.
2172.28s: And then people will gravitate to where the rest of the volume is.
2176.68s: So a significant difference to like, if you're looking at the delta of 64 versus the delta of 82,
2182.20s: that's going to cause a big difference in the behavior of the options contract.
2186.56s: Because if GameStop goes up a dollar,
2190.64s: I'm netting way more of that move.
2193.48s: So way more is intrinsic there.
2195.72s: Right.
2196.56s: Is what we're saying there at the.
2197.88s: Exactly.
2198.72s: What's strike are we seeing there at the 20s?
2200.60s: That's a big difference.
2201.96s: So you're buying.
2203.28s: You're buying way more of this stock and you're gambling way less.
2207.96s: It's that's exactly the way to look at it.
2209.96s: It's a way of gaining leverage.
2212.08s: So every options contract holds up to 100 shares of the underlying,
2218.08s: right?
2219.08s: Each options contract is worth 100 shares.
2220.88s: The way you can look at the delta is that tells you how many shares the position is behaving as right now, right?
2229.32s: So remember, delta tells us the dollar change.
2232.72s: And or it tells us the premium rate of change for every dollar move in the underlying.
2236.28s: So essentially each one of these is behaving like one share.
2239.92s: That's so that is exactly why you will see these move and give you a better gross dollar return.
2247.72s: However, something like this can give you a slightly better compounding return,
2253.08s: where you're putting up less money, right?
2254.84s: Because these are called 525 versus these where you're paying 760 something like that.
2262.36s: So these are paying more, but if you get a move, you'll make a bigger gross dollar amount.
2268.76s: These you're paying slightly less, but you will see a slightly less dollar move.
2275.04s: For the underlying itself.
2277.32s: So that's the cool part about options is that you really have the ability to construct positions.
2283.56s: That makes sense to you that really align with what you're trying to accomplish.
2289.64s: So typically I'll have a base position that looks like this.
2293.92s: So out here in the 25s and it's I literally have these right now.
2298.44s: And then I'll put on shorter term positions, typically two weeks, three weeks, something like that.
2304.52s: If I start seeing price movement and I'll do something that's a little closer to at the money or slightly out of the money.
2312.28s: And it's because these can compound a lot.
2315.72s: So the delta you're looking for on these is maybe somewhere around 0.5.
2319.96s: I would less than that.
2321.04s: So typically I would be looking like a 30 delta, 40 delta.
2324.88s: A big thing is making sure that you're getting exposure to enough gamma, which this doesn't show me for some reason.
2330.96s: But gamma in a nutshell is the rate of change of delta.
2337.48s: So that's essentially an options ability to compound.
2341.64s: So options that are closer to expiration.
2344.92s: That's what this is here.
2345.92s: This yellow line represents closer to expiration.
2348.24s: We'll have a higher gamma.
2349.96s: And that just tells us that the delta is going to change faster, which is where your compounding return potential comes from.
2357.04s: But it gives and takes.
2358.96s: If it goes against you, it means that you're going the wrong way super fast.
2363.56s: So it's a delicate dance.
2368.12s: So I'm hearing a lot of talk about options crush recently, right?
2372.96s: Because we just had a period where the stock cooled down a lot.
2376.96s: So and I think that's what you just kind of like.
2380.88s: Talk to a little bit, right?
2382.24s: The idea of like it turning against you.
2384.44s: You all of a sudden your options lose a ton of value very quickly.
2387.68s: Would that be an options crush right there?
2390.52s: It's kind of a perversion of the term.
2392.52s: I get what they're trying to say.
2394.12s: Typically when you'll hear people talk about options,
2397.40s: crests of some sort, we generally referring to volatility actually.
2401.56s: We normally volatility crush.
2404.32s: But what that framing sounds like to me are people that have short term options with really high theta.
2414.64s: And then their options are decaying away super, super fast.
2419.16s: So there's a lot of options.
2422.64s: Let's say for example, if we go to this all strikes,
2425.80s: I think these have a 125.
2427.92s: So there's 56,180 of these options way out here at 125.
2433.76s: And their bid at five cents offered at six.
2439.32s: Now again, this is a not my platform.
2443.48s: This is just not my boat.
2445.44s: But typically I would have theta in here to show you how much this decays.
2450.60s: But on a daily basis, a huge chunk of this will decay out.
2456.04s: So you could probably ballpark it to about a penny, which would be a dollar.
2460.68s: But that's a fifth of the position after one day goes.
2464.20s: It's gone.
2465.08s: Just gone.
2466.20s: So they will decay very, very fast.
2469.84s: And most of these options that have these tiny little deltas,
2473.60s: they can compound incredibly if you get a big old move in your favor.
2480.68s: If you do a question,
2482.20s: here's a question I've always had.
2483.96s: So like looking at the strikes, they're at 100, right?
2487.72s: So stock starts moving.
2488.92s: Let's say the stock moves up $20 tomorrow or on Monday,
2493.92s: we see a settlement cycle hypothetically, not financial base.
2497.40s: Stock goes from 25 or 26 to 46, right?
2502.00s: Roughly speaking, that strike, if I was holding one contract,
2507.04s: because the underlying is now moved $20, I should get,
2511.64s: because it's got a delta, what's the delta on that guy?
2514.64s: It's zero, because it's so far out of the money.
2517.68s: Right.
2518.20s: So it won't move in value, right?
2520.96s: It will.
2521.64s: They just, because delta, it goes beyond two decimal points.
2525.16s: So there's three, four, five decimal points
2527.12s: to these really far out of the monies.
2528.92s: Okay.
2529.76s: And then it will only start changing in value
2532.56s: as the strike approach is 100, right?
2537.92s: Yes.
2538.92s: So this either you would need to see the underlying move
2542.64s: in the favor of the position.
2544.00s: So in this case, if we're long these,
2545.40s: you would need the underlying to go up,
2546.84s: or if volatility exploded for some reason,
2550.96s: if volatility goes up a lot,
2553.12s: the premium of all options goes up.
2556.76s: Now, who is quantifying, or is it a static calculation
2561.04s: for just volatility?
2562.60s: So volatility, when you say,
2565.04s: who's, are you saying like who's determining it?
2567.68s: Because it's, you know, it's a function of what the underlying
2571.00s: is doing, right?
2572.16s: So the stock is,
2573.96s: it's a function of what the underlying is expected to do.
2577.76s: So how, how is that derived?
2580.76s: Great question.
2582.08s: So volatility is a absolutely fascinating,
2587.16s: fascinating component of options.
2590.12s: And essentially, there are different types
2593.76s: of volatility that we use.
2595.20s: So on the trading side, more often than not,
2598.56s: we use implied volatility.
2600.88s: This is where we're taking whatever volatility
2603.76s: has already been baked into the price
2605.56s: and we're pulling it out and we can see what it is.
2608.64s: That's implied volatility.
2610.08s: Now, what you're referring to is what's called forecast volatility.
2614.08s: This is what market makers are doing.
2616.36s: They're essentially maintaining a volatility surface model
2621.48s: that postulates what volatility is going to be going forward.
2626.28s: There are a lot of different ways to create these models.
2629.12s: They're proprietary by nature.
2631.00s: The reason why they're proprietary is because that's literally,
2634.04s: if you can price evolve better than that person,
2636.56s: you can make more money than them.
2638.48s: So we'll not be able to actually see,
2641.08s: if you want to call it,
2641.92s: F the forecast volatility,
2643.80s: but we'll be able to see its effects
2645.64s: by the pricing of the options as things are happening.
2650.40s: Okay.
2651.60s: Because they're at the end of the day,
2653.60s: they're the ones selling most of the options.
2656.80s: So in theory, they could suddenly price options
2660.96s: very, very cheaply crushing out all the options,
2665.24s: but that's a risk for them
2666.92s: because if the stock were to then move into those options,
2670.28s: they would have potentially sold a bunch of them at that cheap price
2673.32s: and they get blown out.
2674.16s: So it's in their interest to do this
2676.16s: and not cheat on pricing the options.
2679.84s: They have some wiggle room, but not a ton,
2683.92s: because it's still a consensus driven supply and domain market.
2688.64s: So if I see them price something too cheaply,
2692.48s: I can immediately tell there's an opportunity.
2694.52s: So people like me that are even,
2697.60s: I'm still really dumb, but I'm not super dumb.
2702.16s: So like if I see an opportunity like that,
2704.48s: I'm gonna take a shot on it.
2706.00s: So speculators like me that are looking for that stuff
2709.12s: will then flood into those products.
2711.48s: And they can do it to one another too.
2713.04s: So if like one market maker messes up on their options pricing,
2717.04s: another one could buy on while up and then sell them
2719.44s: and immediately make some money.
2720.72s: Okay.
2721.72s: And how many options, sorry to keep interrupting.
2725.56s: How many options market makers would there be?
2728.84s: Because people talk about Wolverine.
2730.72s: People talk about Citadel.
2732.36s: I don't know, Susqueilana does options,
2734.12s: but how many on one stock would there typically be involved
2737.52s: in making this market?
2739.60s: To great question, really difficult to know,
2742.16s: really difficult to know, because technically speaking,
2744.52s: I could even behave as a market maker.
2747.00s: Okay.
2747.92s: Yeah, it's in terms of like large market making firms,
2752.56s: you hit a lot of them because the other component to this
2756.60s: that adds and muddies the water even more
2759.96s: is there are prop trading firms and high frequency
2763.76s: trading firms that can also essentially behave short term
2768.76s: as market makers.
2769.84s: They have a different game, right?
2770.88s: That's not their primary modality,
2772.16s: but they can interact with things that are mispriced.
2775.00s: And essentially either supply liquidity
2779.36s: by taking the other sides of trades potentially.
2782.16s: But-
2782.76s: Or take advantage of some of this mispricing.
2784.96s: The mispricing, absolutely.
2786.28s: And algorithms, algorithms are high frequency
2789.76s: trades are literally hunting for that.
2793.28s: They're so sophisticated to the point where they care about
2797.44s: how close they are to the exchange.
2799.76s: They're paying millions of dollars to be
2803.04s: a bit closer to the exchange to reduce latency.
2806.48s: And so-
2807.32s: And so there was a clip on SuperSonic about just that today
2810.48s: or yesterday, right?
2812.00s: Famous clip from, it was quite a while ago,
2815.24s: it was like over 15 years ago,
2816.60s: but talking about the latency and how much they're paying,
2819.68s: not just for speed, right?
2821.32s: For internet speed, server location,
2823.56s: but they're paying for particular levels of information
2826.56s: and quality of information from the markets.
2828.76s: And the markets are actually making the exchanges
2830.68s: or making more money on that.
2832.44s: And then they're making on offering those premium packages
2835.92s: for information, quality, and speed of information
2838.52s: than they are on the actual trading.
2840.68s: So, but what I'm curious about is when you're showing
2843.48s: the volume on GameStop options as an example,
2846.88s: it seems so low to me.
2848.48s: Is that still going to be an efficient market
2851.32s: where like a strike in that expiry only has volume on a day
2855.44s: of maybe 50 or 100, like if you go to the daily volume
2859.36s: on some of these, or even lower in some cases.
2862.80s: So is it still efficient?
2865.08s: Yeah, it is.
2866.60s: It'll always be relative to the size of the product,
2870.00s: but yeah, like I still absolutely,
2872.80s: because relative to the size of this stock,
2875.80s: like there's actually a,
2877.60s: a lot of activity in here, like a crazy amount.
2881.48s: So it's almost the inverse, right?
2883.80s: So like if you look at like other companies,
2886.16s: well GE's kind of big,
2887.72s: but I don't know what this look like.
2889.52s: I'm literally seeing, yeah, look, look at the OI here.
2893.64s: 14, 24, 183, and this is $159 stock.
2899.48s: This is GE, this is a big company.
2901.68s: And you can see just how little activity there is here.
2905.68s: There's, and this is big for this product, the 1,500.
2910.12s: So it's almost actually the inverse
2912.24s: where GameStop is crazy active for the size.
2915.44s: And it is.
2916.96s: We should see efficiently priced options.
2921.00s: Moderately.
2923.16s: The reason why I say moderately
2924.76s: is because of the way that this moves,
2927.56s: which is again, what makes it so fascinating,
2930.32s: is from a market-making perspective,
2933.16s: you literally have to be ready to be ran over by a train
2936.80s: whenever you're making a market in this.
2939.08s: So I mean by that.
2941.12s: The fact that GameStop does this.
2945.16s: It goes from 17 to 48.
2947.84s: That from a market-making perspective,
2949.64s: being on the other side of those options traits,
2951.72s: that's hell because they are having, again,
2955.48s: this is kind of the entire concept of a gamma squeeze,
2959.12s: it's driven by market makers.
2960.72s: And it's because they're getting fucking destroyed
2964.08s: and they have to find a way to manage
2966.44s: their risk in the positions.
2968.24s: And how do they do that?
2969.08s: So we know that,
2971.72s: we know that market makers have come out
2974.40s: and said they've made a ton of money on GameStop.
2976.36s: Okay.
2977.68s: So how do they do a damn wide?
2979.64s: All right, so they're making money on the spreads.
2981.84s: How else would they be mitigating risk
2983.84s: with on the options front?
2986.16s: For somebody that's not in the know here,
2987.40s: because occasionally they are gonna get run over, right?
2989.24s: We saw options printed two or three times now,
2994.84s: at least in the last two to three months.
2998.28s: More actually, probably,
2999.36s: because May 3rd would be a big option
3001.60s: sprinting in the whole week to follow.
3004.76s: May 13th and 14th,
3006.52s: but then multiple period system.
3008.68s: There would be great opportunity to buy into some options
3011.16s: and sell some options, make a ton of money.
3014.08s: So what could they be doing to,
3017.24s: because can they play them themselves too?
3019.72s: Absolutely.
3020.56s: I was literally gonna say that
3021.80s: that is one of the first things that they're going to do,
3024.04s: is hedging what the underlying is one tool
3027.68s: that they will use, provided that it's accessible.
3030.32s: But they will use options tremendously,
3033.88s: because the only thing that it's really important
3035.40s: to remember is that option market makers,
3038.32s: they have a book of a ton of things, right?
3041.40s: It's not just individual strikes,
3044.68s: that counterparty to a person's single trade.
3047.40s: They're on the other sides of thousands of trades.
3050.56s: So they can use options that,
3053.20s: it's actually why they're so interested in all of the Greeks,
3056.56s: because they can mitigate a lot of their risk
3059.48s: by using options or even more interesting, actually,
3064.32s: I gotta get my tinfoil hat.
3066.72s: Do you like my tinfoil hat?
3068.04s: Well, I love the tinfoil hat.
3070.20s: I need to make one.
3071.56s: I have to, I had to put my tinfoil hat on for this part.
3075.12s: But the other thing that it can do is that
3076.72s: if they think it's an informed order,
3079.68s: like the counterparty to the order knows something,
3081.92s: they can run with the order.
3083.88s: So they can order with the...
3086.00s: That is something that I never knew about
3088.16s: until very recently, the idea that orders are flagged, right,
3093.24s: as informed versus uninformed.
3095.68s: Absolutely.
3096.52s: What does that mean?
3097.60s: So you're telling me every option's order
3100.04s: is that true for equity orders too,
3101.92s: has a flag on it that says informed versus uninformed.
3105.00s: I don't know if it's every single one.
3106.68s: I couldn't speak intelligently
3108.96s: to the actual process that they flagged,
3112.08s: but what they can do is identify order flow
3116.48s: that looks, it looks not like standard retail, right?
3120.68s: Like the vast majority of retail trades,
3122.72s: they're gonna assume is uninformed to a degree
3125.72s: and they're not necessarily gonna worry about it too much.
3128.80s: But if they see somebody like Roy and Kitty, for example,
3132.08s: I actually spoke to one of my buddies
3134.04s: that's a market maker for this exact thing.
3136.68s: So I was just curious.
3137.56s: I was like, how would you even manage this position?
3139.64s: And the first thing he said is that he would immediately
3142.76s: hedge because he doesn't wanna have open-sized risk
3146.64s: with something that looks informed.
3148.32s: So the way that it looks informed is that it's really big size
3152.64s: somebody taking a big bet.
3154.68s: And they're also willing to enter multiple times, right?
3159.16s: Like they're building a position.
3160.80s: So that starts to look like somebody knows something.
3164.48s: And market makers, they're wildly, wildly educated.
3170.04s: In terms of what order flow is normal for a product
3173.16s: and then what order flow becomes anomalous.
3175.60s: They're fantastic at that.
3177.32s: So it's another way that they can identify opportunities
3180.64s: in things like mergers and acquisitions.
3183.68s: They can see crazy order flow for earnings.
3187.04s: They can see inside or order flow
3189.72s: and then try to front-run it.
3190.80s: So essentially they're looking for certain kinds
3193.56s: of behaviors and patterns that they identify
3196.32s: is different for the underlying, the standard,
3198.68s: run of the mill transactions.
3200.68s: And they're looking for things like size, persistence,
3203.68s: the way that they're structuring the trades.
3205.72s: And then they can make a assessment and think,
3209.28s: okay, do I wanna bet against this guy?
3211.68s: If so, they would under hedge.
3213.76s: If they don't wanna bet against the guy,
3216.08s: but they're not sure that they wanna run with them,
3217.92s: they'll just essentially hedge the position totally
3221.32s: and just run a pure hedge and collect
3222.72s: what they can off of that.
3224.36s: So you said earlier, running with them,
3227.16s: would that be why we saw so many January 21st at the 20s?
3231.52s: Because while he owned 120,000 of them,
3234.36s: a ton of them came on top of this, right?
3237.00s: Yeah, it's really, really hard to discreetly identify
3241.44s: who was piling on, but there was a lot of people piling
3243.84s: onto those.
3244.92s: Right, so a lot of household and retail could have
3247.00s: after the fact, but we saw, I believe,
3251.76s: his position come in, got built during that week
3254.56s: of the share offering.
3255.92s: But then there were also,
3258.16s: there were too many of these block orders of five to 10,000.
3262.52s: There was more than just him doing that kind of a play.
3265.88s: So that could be people just basically mirroring his trade.
3268.92s: Kind of like I think you said you do at times, right?
3270.92s: A flag or a, what comes up and you're like,
3273.52s: I better jump in on this,
3274.72s: because someone's building something.
3276.48s: It's literally how I found his order.
3279.32s: And that's the funny part.
3280.96s: It's one of the funniest things about this whole story,
3283.80s: at least from like my fox hole, my little view is the fact
3286.92s: like I had no idea it was him.
3288.60s: Like I don't know who it was.
3290.04s: I'm just sitting here, just watching blinky lights and stuff.
3293.40s: And I see something that starts looking interesting.
3295.80s: And I'm like, wait a minute, what the fuck is going on?
3298.88s: Yeah, so I start paying much closer attention.
3302.12s: And I'm like, like this right here,
3304.40s: if this is big of a red flag as you could possibly get,
3308.60s: you have this persistent sizing,
3310.88s: 5,000 centralized at the 20s, 21 June,
3315.40s: it's the same position,
3316.96s: over $3 million positions.
3319.32s: And they're going on within moments of one another, right?
3322.80s: So this one went on at 12 o' 3, 12 o' 3, 12 o' 2, 11 o' 38.
3325.44s: Like we are just pounding this position.
3329.80s: And it happens 11, 32, 28, like it's incessant.
3334.92s: So that lights up on my alert system,
3338.68s: literally like a freaking Christmas tree.
3341.56s: And the first thing I think of is this is an insane amount of conviction, right?
3348.28s: Like because you can see what the standard premiums are
3351.52s: for positions that are being built.
3353.08s: And then you start seeing blocks come in in the 2 millions,
3357.40s: 5 millions, and there's a bunch of them at the same time.
3361.00s: It's so...
3362.00s: Maybe a follow up question on that, sorry.
3365.16s: I was just going to say for, in that instance, for an options trader,
3369.08s: that is like a big, blinky, flashy red light.
3372.52s: It's so, so apparent.
3374.92s: And the market makers are going to have even more tools to see that.
3377.88s: Absolutely.
3378.88s: They, yes, by the time I see it,
3381.00s: they probably have already built a position.
3383.56s: So people are really excited about like these 30s for next week.
3388.52s: You know, is that anything like this at all?
3393.08s: Because I don't know, and I haven't spoken to it at all.
3395.96s: Yeah, definitely not like that at all.
3398.52s: So for a comparison, if we look over the last 30 days,
3405.80s: the biggest trade was 875, which I'm not dumping on that, right?
3411.16s: Like that's not an insignificant trade.
3413.72s: That's a billion dollar options trade for...
3416.28s: But that's the other hilarious thing
3421.48s: about like looking at this stuff is just how much it like skews the perception of reality.
3428.44s: Let's take a look at the 19 expiration coming up.
3431.40s: So the biggest trade for this upcoming 19 July expiration is 234K.
3435.32s: It was the biggest trade.
3437.00s: So again, not insignificant, but being in the world of GameStop...
3442.44s: What's the strike on, where do you see the strike on that one?
3444.52s: Those are 30s.
3445.48s: Those are the 30s, okay.
3446.76s: Yep.
3447.72s: And I think this was a 5,000-lion.
3450.20s: I think this came through with a couple others.
3453.08s: Yeah, broken up.
3454.20s: Yeah, exactly.
3455.00s: So I think this is the entire order.
3458.44s: But I thought in it...
3460.44s: So I think it amounted to 4810 here.
3463.16s: And then my guess is there was probably,
3465.56s: obviously, a little bit more that got
3468.28s: tacked on, probably to round it out.
3470.12s: But the wild part here is because GameStop is so freaking crazy.
3475.08s: When you see like, you know, quarter million dollar positions come through,
3478.52s: like you're numb to it.
3479.56s: You're like, yeah, okay, bro, whatever.
3480.92s: Like, wake me up when this is $3 million.
3484.44s: So it looks like something could be going on,
3489.00s: but it doesn't look anything, literally anything.
3492.68s: Like what we saw going on back in the original squeeze.
3499.00s: Right.
3499.48s: So here's a question.
3501.96s: We know that he built that position.
3504.92s: And he had to have had about $170 million to do it, right?
3508.68s: Because he bought 120,000.
3511.24s: That would have cost $60 something million.
3513.32s: $60,000,000 was the options.
3515.72s: For the options.
3516.36s: And then there was like 100 million for the shares, right?
3518.68s: Yeah.
3518.92s: Somewhere around there.
3519.96s: All right.
3520.28s: So was there an opportunity to make that amount of money into the run up to $80?
3526.12s: Conceivably, options only could that have been accomplished off of like a small starting position?
3532.28s: How much could he have made playing that from before?
3538.84s: Basically, this is like early May,
3540.84s: in May 13th and 14th.
3542.44s: I don't even know like the magnitude of,
3544.44s: because I've never played options.
3545.72s: I don't know how much you can make on them.
3549.00s: Could that have been done?
3552.12s: In terms of when you say could that have been done?
3554.20s: You mean making how much?
3556.68s: So making enough to buy that next position.
3560.44s: He would have needed about 170 million to buy those shares and buy all those,
3564.68s: one to put those, those 20 calls.
3567.56s: Right?
3568.28s: So he needs, my theory is he needs 170 million in cash on May 15th to start building his next position.
3576.92s: If he started with say $5 million in cash on May 1st,
3582.44s: can you turn $5 million on May 1st into 170 million two weeks later?
3589.16s: Is that possible?
3590.92s: Could he, I would have to look closer at the numbers.
3595.48s: Again, if my platform worked,
3597.64s: I could answer it actually for you immediately.
3601.88s: But I'm trying to log in again now and it looks like it's still down.
3605.96s: But it would be highly improbable is the way I would frame that.
3611.08s: Like the probability of turning five into almost 200 million over the course of those two weeks,
3617.96s: I don't think that is a highly probable scenario.
3624.92s: So theoretically it makes more sense.
3627.72s: We're not trying to nail it down or anything here at all or just spit falling.
3630.04s: But he probably came into, there you go, he probably came into
3635.64s: May 15th with like already a large cash position established.
3639.64s: And he probably had to have done something similar with Chewie because out of nowhere,
3642.84s: he shows up with nine million shares at Chewie, which I don't know how much those cost him.
3646.84s: But it seems like, yeah, that one's
3649.72s: crazy to me too. The whole Chewie thing.
3652.36s: And I think one of the most interesting parts about that one is, I guess technically he could
3657.56s: have used options to gain that exposure, but that's still a big position.
3663.00s: Right, we haven't seen his position exactly.
3666.68s: Right, we don't know if it shares, they would have to be to be reported as a 13G though,
3671.96s: short dated options, right?
3673.96s: Less than 60 days.
3675.88s: Yeah, you would know that rule better than I would.
3678.76s: Because I originally didn't even know on the 13G if it could be shares and I had to look that
3682.92s: up and I found out that it could be options. I mean, if it could be options and it could be options
3688.04s: that I learned. And I also don't know if there's a difference between the G and the D.
3693.72s: I don't know.
3694.76s: Yeah, that part I don't know either. Maybe maybe somebody in the chat knows.
3698.20s: I imagine the D you show the position on the G, you don't have to show what
3705.88s: the purchase, well, no, the purchase date or the event date is noted on the G,
3710.84s: but the price paid is not shown or anything like the positions are shown on the G.
3717.16s: Just the like what the representation is in number of shares and what percent that is of the
3723.16s: outstanding. So yeah, super curious. I just, you know, when is he going to come back? I don't
3729.80s: think he's gone for good again. But are we going to see more details on that position?
3734.52s: Because that's crazy. Did not expect that at all.
3738.04s: I'm not going to lie. Part of me expected whenever the reason I keep taking this off in case you
3744.04s: don't know is that a solid aluminum foil hat vents as well as you think it would.
3750.36s: So it's kind of like cooking your head.
3752.84s: Literally. And I tell you my brain is already too close like a steamed vegetable. So I don't
3757.32s: need to actually become a physical one. I think there's such a crazy potential for him to
3768.84s: go so many routes after that. Gee, like I don't think it's any sort of happenstance that he hasn't
3775.56s: shown a portfolio update for about a month now. I know that there was a lot of people that were
3780.52s: really expecting to see something like yesterday. That part I find just so intriguing, right?
3788.20s: He was pretty rock steady with these updates. And then he just stopped for some reason.
3792.44s: That I find I find very curious. I don't know what to make of that. Do you have any ideas?
3797.88s: Well, we can look at the timing, right? So let me, let me look at the timing. I'm going to pull up.
3803.16s: He has only posted his yellow updates since returning on June 13.
3811.88s: June, June 2nd was the first one. That was a, that was a Sunday.
3819.32s: And then the stock surge like crazy on June 3rd.
3823.16s: Then he posted another update after that, like that evening. And I think the key there, I think what he
3832.76s: was trying to telegraph was, I'm not pumping this thing, right? I just showing my position because
3839.40s: he could have taken action and he made no action, right? Because the media, like it was blaming him
3845.56s: for the events for tweeting, right? On the rise up to 80, right? So by not taking any action during
3852.52s: this Monday morning pump, he's basically saying like, I'm not actually causing this to happen.
3858.84s: He did one more update on the sixth. And again, his position is completely unchanged on the sixth.
3866.52s: Then he livestreams as it's pumping again on the 7th, 6th and 7th. It doesn't do anything with
3872.68s: this position. So you can count, you can count the 7th as a yellow update. Can we just pause there for
3878.20s: a second and just soak in the fact that we're looking at a portfolio that has $250 million in
3888.04s: gains on the day. Like, what is this? Like what is this? It's all game stuff. Just all game stuff.
3900.84s: It's insane. I like, I find myself talking about this stuff. And I'm like, what the fuck am I even
3907.56s: saying anymore? It's like, at least in time, you kind of stop and you like realize how absurd this
3913.72s: whole scenario is. I had a moment of that when I was just like working on the spreadsheet today.
3920.68s: Like I'm working on the spreadsheet as I'm doing, just chipping away on it. And I just stop and I
3924.52s: think to myself, like, this is actually crazy. Like everything that's going on with this story
3930.52s: is insane. Literally, literally, it's so wild to me that this is like the reality. This is
3941.08s: single dude. This is sitting in his house using Yahoo Finance for his chart.
3946.20s: And he's just using what's his platform season here?
3951.08s: Each rate? Yeah, that looks like whatever the, and that's not even like, that's not even like a
3956.04s: platform that I can't open, right? Like I can't get in my damn platform. He's just logging into
3961.40s: the web browser. And he's just using like the standard website. So yeah, he basically exposed
3969.00s: his portfolio on Sunday, stock runs, he exposed it again, doesn't make any changes.
3975.08s: Shows his position again as stock goes bonkers and then live streams and shows it live,
3980.60s: as it's then losing like three or four hundred million dollars in value. And he's laughing and
3987.32s: drinking up beer, bro. Mad man. And then his final update. No, no, no, no,
3995.08s: then he still hasn't changed anything, right? Yeah, he stayed static. No change.
4001.64s: Company has now sold 75 million shares. And what does he do? Basically doubles down.
4007.48s: Yep. Like if that's not because, you know, I see all these comments. I just saw a comment on
4013.00s: my channel today. Someone basically saying like, we're in kid. He's going to leave. He's lost faith
4016.44s: in the company. He just got hundreds of million dollars on stock. You know, like,
4023.48s: there's, there's nothing, there's nothing about much of anything in here that indicates to me that
4029.80s: he's trying to leave even from even from that options position. Like, who puts on 68 million
4036.76s: dollars of options without the intention of doing something with, right? So yeah, I just,
4045.24s: yeah, it's crazy. Absolutely crazy. And the fact that the,
4051.16s: the big angle on my channel is I talk about the media, right? The media should be like saying
4056.84s: how amazing this is because like, if this is an incredible, just an incredible play, like you said,
4063.48s: so much conviction, right? It was so, so, so much conviction that you could just ride it
4067.64s: and follow it and do well because you know that someone with this amount of strength and what
4072.52s: they're doing has to know what they're doing, right? I think that that's a really fair assessment.
4078.44s: There's a comment from Franz Zoo who says he 99% could turn a few millions into more than 100
4085.16s: millions in two weeks. Look how he made four days on half a billion. I think the one thing I would
4090.84s: note for you, Frances, think about the difference in magnitude, right? Few millions into hundreds
4097.72s: of millions versus starting from 200 million and then going to essentially 500 and change.
4105.32s: So at one point, he had almost a billion like on this on the 6th, right? Yeah, so that's like
4112.12s: a five five X, right? Yeah. Over a couple weeks. I think the other thing to note is there's
4119.96s: something to be said about like what's possible and then what's probable, right? So when he started
4126.12s: going through that like almost becoming a bill and I think he made a tweet about that too, which was
4129.88s: hilarious. He said you were a billionaire, which is putting, you got a pretty tinfoil hat back on
4134.84s: for us, but maybe he is a maybe he had a billion in cash going into this because if he
4142.04s: played just 2020 into 2021 doing a thousand X or 2019 into 2021, he did a thousand X on his position.
4151.72s: There's been enough volatility in the meantime on just this one stock for him to create a very large
4157.00s: position. The only thing I would say and a couple people have said similar things that I'm just not
4164.12s: sure about is on the stream when the thing was plummeting, he made the explicit comment of like this
4172.12s: is my only account and these are my only positions. So I have to go back and watch it. He said these
4178.60s: are my only game stop positions. Did he say, oh, let's find it. I'll find it real quick while you're
4184.28s: talking and then we can literally make the quip. He said, yeah, and he did say is cash a position.
4191.88s: He did say that. So as he did, he hovered the mouse inside the platform.
4200.68s: Right. Give me one sec. I think I know where it's at.
4209.24s: This is the argument of the century. Does roaring kitty. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean,
4215.80s: let's ask the chat. I'll throw a poll in there for them and see what they say.
4219.32s: What do you get the question is essentially, does he have a large cash or other stock position
4225.72s: outside of what we saw in these yellow updates here? Is this so is this only is this is only position
4231.88s: or does he have other positions than this other capital. So does RK have a large cash pile or other
4242.20s: positions outside of the E trade portfolio? He's shared with us. Because the thing that considers
4255.08s: he poses or his 13G trade event is for the what the 24th. I believe that's a fidelity account.
4267.48s: My bad guys, whatever the account is. I don't know. No, no, no, I think what people are saying is
4271.80s: he's got a tab open and fidelity. Oh, I see. Okay. You don't see what's in there. And then in
4276.84s: his previous live streams, he's used fidelity tools. So he can have he could have an account on
4282.04s: fidelity. I'm going to grab the screen share from you again, really quick. And then I'm going to
4287.32s: share the sound as well. Yeah. So I think I think this is pretty close to where it is. Just one quick
4292.84s: admon note for you guys. As I play this, if for whatever reason YouTube flags me, because they always
4297.72s: do when I try to play shit, if it cuts the stream, they're, it'll come back on. We just have to
4302.68s: chill for a second is all that is. And I have to turn it off. So if we disappear for a moment,
4307.88s: that is what cost it. All right. I'm guessing it's right around here, because this is where like
4312.36s: literally, um, yeah, the most user. There is a session. There goes. All right. Here we go.
4318.60s: And then let me know if you can hear it. There you go. All right. Cheers.
4325.48s: Cheers. I got a lot there. So those, yeah, those are my only positions. You know, as you know,
4330.52s: about me, I'll take a. So you heard what he said, only positions. Yep. Uh, it's, uh, it's, uh,
4338.68s: it's a true yellow again. I suppose. I know there's some cat. Quick side note again. Sorry.
4346.36s: Can we just salute this man? He's sitting here with fucking band dates on his base. And how far
4353.64s: down is he on the day right here? What's this? Uh, 220 something new. You know, like lunatic. I love it.
4365.16s: I love it. You just can't make this up, bro. All right. I got it. Actually, that's what I made. It
4373.80s: depends on your positions, but, uh, it's another yellow again. You know what I'm saying? It's how I
4380.60s: roll. So that's, that's that there. But I seen those headlines. E trade. E trade. I see those
4387.64s: headlines. I gotta check. I'm checking in every day. A long end. I'm like, I'm my position still
4393.24s: there. Are they still there? Let me check. They're still there. Wait, they're still there. Okay,
4397.64s: they're still there. Actually, I wasn't even like paying attention to the details. They're still
4401.16s: there. But I'm, each morning, I'm like, I don't know what's happening. So I go, all right. Well,
4405.88s: don't make me. Don't make me. But each trade, I'll do this with HTML. I'll do that. Don't make me,
4413.00s: don't make me remove it. I know how to do that. I'm just kidding. No, I'm going to put it back.
4417.48s: We're good. We're good. No, we're those positions are there. Those positions are there. But I'll do
4421.80s: it. I'll remove it. Don't make me. Don't don't make me do it. Don't make me. I'll delete that from the
4430.52s: HTML. I will. All right. Mr. Robot Hacker here. You know, I learned a thing or two and I know how
4437.80s: to delete that. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. But I can. I can. I'm just messing.
4445.24s: I'm just messing people. Okay. It's still I put it back. See, I'm well, I what the it's like all
4449.88s: green. He's like, oh, he's squinting. He's squinting. He's like, oh, he's waking up looking. I feel
4455.24s: like that's me in the morning. Somedays I waking it up and I'm squinted. I'm seeing the stuff. I'm like,
4458.76s: what? Oh, my what the hell did I do? So that's where we're at right now. Oh, did it go down?
4465.88s: Oh, is it halted again? Well, that's where it was. Right word. That's where we're at the hole. See,
4471.00s: I wait until the halt because if if it's halted, it doesn't show the stuff. So it needs to be unhaulted.
4477.08s: I don't know why it does that. It just is. And so yeah, there you go. There you go.
4483.24s: Did we miss the parmer? He said his cash position. I think it was like right after his first
4486.76s: statement. He says it right in the beginning. He goes, there's some cash in there is cash
4491.48s: position. But we can go back to that because I think in the context there, I took it to mean like
4496.12s: what's in there. Now, just to be clear, it's difficult, right? Because he's he's he's thinking in layers.
4504.60s: So I don't think that he would ever purposefully like lie to like misrepresent what he has. I like
4509.96s: I think he's super transparent, but it also would not shock me if all of his wealth was not in
4518.92s: this one account. Yeah, right. That seems the same shocking is I think what he's implying there
4526.52s: those that like this is his only options and stocks at the moment, right? Yeah, I'll play the
4533.08s: front part again to see the cash part specifically. I'm not sure it's. I'm doing it. But it's not
4539.72s: I'm going to take it. I think it's fine if I bring the don't hold it. Don't hold it. There you go.
4543.48s: All right. There you go. Is it on the chat there? There you go. All right. Cheers. Cheers. I got a lot
4552.36s: there. So those yeah, those are my only positions. You know, as you know about me, I'll take
4559.24s: it's a true yolo again. I suppose. I know there's some cash there. That's what I made it to
4565.32s: me. I know there's some cash there. So I think because there's the rest, I think he says
4569.96s: that new positions, but I suppose, I know there's some cash there. That's what I made it depends on
4575.64s: your positions, but that's another yolo again. He does. He does say his cash position, but I think
4586.04s: he's just kind of riffing off the fact in trying to at least I took it as he's trying to reinforce
4591.64s: the fact that he doesn't have any other positions. I think he was simply saying that because, you
4596.76s: know, he has some cash, which I think in this case, I forget it's millions of dollars in cash.
4604.04s: That's like 30 million bucks almost. Yeah. I got some cash in there.
4613.80s: I got some cash. Oh, God. Well, anyways, yeah. So that's what I thought was really interesting,
4620.36s: because because I really do think he's very transparent and I believe that when he said that,
4627.32s: I really do, I take him at his word, but that I mean, it still wouldn't be crazy to not have,
4636.52s: you know, it would not be crazy for him to have some cash in something else. Like you still
4643.08s: got to live. I don't know if he has a family, but he does. And I'm curious how he would have built
4648.76s: his chewy position because I was this was on the he's talking here on the seventh and then his
4655.08s: last update is on three days later on the 10th. He's converted now all those options into shares.
4661.32s: And then there was one on one. Oh, 13th. Sorry. So 13th is his last one. So yeah, that's a week later.
4667.48s: He now only has 11 days to build a position in chewy. That six percent of the company, right?
4677.48s: Yeah. So how can he possibly do that?
4685.24s: The one thing I think about
4691.32s: the one thing I think about is using options as compared to buying shares.
4697.32s: Right. Some of it could be options for sure. Because even if he used in the money options in
4708.20s: chewy, I mean, but like I also imagine we would see the position, we can we could see the position.
4714.92s: So let's go back to this. Let's go to chewy. And then what was the date range we were talking about?
4723.24s: So it needs to be if this is only a count he's playing with here between June 13th.
4730.52s: Okay. And I think June 24th.
4734.60s: Okay. I'm adding one day on both sides just in case.
4739.40s: Okay. I think let me look at just 13G.
4744.12s: Okay.
4752.12s: Because it doesn't show the, does it show the basis in there or no?
4757.00s: Yeah. It should.
4761.40s: Because there it is. I mean, what's the law? How it says he's not a cat?
4766.68s: Genius. Dude, like every time I look at this guy's stuff, there's something in there that like straight up.
4773.40s: No, no cost basis. Sorry. I didn't think so. I think it just said like 9,000,000 share equivalent.
4778.76s: Right. Which is he keeps meaming on Ryan Cohen as he's doing all this too, which is just so
4783.72s: funny to me. Right.
4790.20s: And the date, the date of this. So it was filed on the first, but the date
4795.80s: of his June 24th.
4798.52s: So there's 10,000 contracts there. This is,
4804.36s: that's a million shares. There's 10,000 contracts here at the 30. That's another million.
4812.84s: Well, something won't know. I don't know. If he did a yellow update on the 13th, the 13th.
4821.72s: Okay. These were the, these are, and these are afterwards. These are the 25th. So I have to use the actual window.
4830.20s: Because those wouldn't apply that window. The price moved a lot.
4835.16s: So there's, there's a 10,000 at the 27th, which was a 220,000 dollar trade, but this represents a million shares.
4844.76s: So far cry for 9 million. But that's, there's, there's a possibility, right? Because here's another 10,000. So
4856.84s: that's another million. So between these top two, just pretending that these were all him.
4862.92s: Those are on the 21st. This, the first one's on the 21st. Then this other 10,000 is on the 24th.
4870.36s: So let me sort this by size, actually. Yeah. So I see 10,000, another 10,000.
4880.36s: Call this 5,000. So it doesn't look like he would have done it discreetly with options. But
4888.20s: again, pretending that at least some portion of this could, could be this.
4893.24s: Then it looks like he would have been able to essentially gain exposure to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 shares for less than a million bucks total.
4906.20s: Somehow he's got to get 6 million more shares, right? And they're expensive. Still, I mean, they're like 20 bucks each at the lowest.
4913.00s: It wouldn't, I mean, it wouldn't necessarily surprise me. If my hypothesis there is that he could have unwound some of his game stop position.
4922.76s: And then my expectation there would be that he would be doing that to enter back in. Like I don't think he's trying to leave it.
4928.84s: But it looked like he was trying to move something in Chewy. That was my guess.
4934.28s: Maybe we can't know what he does with his positions in the interim. I've told you before,
4941.00s: it from our perspective, he's never decreased his number of shares.
4945.96s: Yeah, and it's funny when I made the video looking at the Chewy position, I actually cited you teaching me about that because I do think I think that that's important, right?
4954.44s: In terms of his tendencies, but yeah, because yeah, cash, cash had to come from somewhere and 9 million shares of Chewy. What was it trading at 2653?
4966.36s: You said.
4970.76s: Right here. The low was 2180, which he definitely wouldn't have gotten in at. What was the, what's the midpoint like between the low and the high, just to.
4981.36s: In here, it's like 25.
4983.56s: 25.
4985.44s: Yes.
4986.72s: 225 million dollar position.
4989.36s: Right. The other thing too is that like his last meme is.
4996.68s: You know, he or one of his last ones, besides the Chewy one, right?
5002.40s: You know, you got the hat on still, which is perfect, but you know, he's.
5005.80s: Exactly. Listen, I'm baking for both of us. My fucking brain is cooking, but it needs to happen.
5012.68s: He's, he's posting this meme as he puts in the by order. I think that's abundantly clear.
5018.52s: Because then he immediately that afternoon, Yolo updates with his 9 million shares, right?
5023.16s: So he's and they're very intentionally here telegraphing that like he's calling a Sam War.
5031.52s: So would he then immediately dump shares after buying them?
5035.52s: Like that would undo his effort to do this.
5040.40s: And he's meaning on Ryan Cohen kind of undoes his meaning on Ryan Cohen too.
5046.24s: I think potentially, but he had a very light cast.
5052.16s: Again, this is I can't believe him. I think he had 6 million in cash, right?
5055.76s: So a light cash position, but not light, right?
5060.08s: 6 million fucking dollars, but he had a he had relative to him, small cash.
5065.92s: So 6 million dollars in cash, a 225 million dollar trade in Chewy goes on.
5073.40s: If it's all shares, you can knock off again, giving the benefit of the doubt,
5078.68s: assuming that all of this was him, which again, that that's probably not super likely for all of
5085.64s: this volume to be him. But again, some combination of it could be.
5091.40s: So that gives us 3 million shares here. So then he essentially would still have about 6
5097.16s: 6 million 1000 ish shares.
5102.12s: You're looking at all strikes, all X-rays look there or you're only looking at certain strikes
5107.24s: next. You're just looking at any large traits.
5110.20s: Yeah. So what I'm doing, I'm sorting it by size and I'm essentially just assigning this top
5116.20s: block of order flow all to him. I see. Yeah. You've got to mix of X-rays there and strikes.
5121.56s: Yeah. It's kind of everything exactly. So I'm just ballparking it.
5125.08s: But so if that gives him a residual position of 6 million 1000 shares at 25,
5132.28s: that gives us 150 million dollar position. He had 6 million in cash. So again,
5137.48s: you can knock that down to 144. But that's got to come from somewhere. And I know some people
5144.60s: were talking about maybe he was trading options around it. In order to come up with that 100 million,
5150.04s: we would have absolutely seen that volume come through and we didn't.
5154.68s: So yeah, just curious. I think we got to wait and see. We can speculate
5157.88s: yeah, till the end of time, right?
5160.44s: It is still fascinating. The timing.
5162.92s: I think that yeah, I think that's a lot of the fun part is
5169.40s: you know the dude thinks in layers, right? So to your point and based on the breadth of evidence
5175.64s: that we've seen, what was it in this? You showed me the it's over to the right.
5186.28s: I think you're showing my screen right now on the screen. If you want to show your screen now.
5192.92s: This is it, right? Like his his share positions. It's the column L.
5200.52s: Can you guys see this or is it not showing you this? You're showing my screen at the moment.
5205.56s: You showing? Yeah, this is in my window. Oh, okay. I bet. Yeah. Yep. So and this is what you taught
5211.40s: me is that if we go back all the way through his share accumulation, it's always been more.
5218.20s: So that parts also hard to read between because we know in this time frame, he had to do other stuff
5228.76s: in order to build the money that he ended up sharing with us that position on what is it?
5235.00s: The second of June or the third of June? His first post was on the second. Yeah. And it wouldn't
5239.80s: have come from just buying and holding all of this that entire time frame. Yeah, I'm thinking,
5246.92s: I'm just going to go with like the easiest explanation, which is this dude's super duper smart and
5251.48s: has made other monies and other accounts doing other things over time and came in to this lock to
5257.56s: unload it like ready to go. You know what I'm saying? And I think that's reasonable. Like I think
5263.32s: I think based on because the other thing people point out pretty frequently is looking at his older
5268.36s: streams, which I went back to take a look at. And I mean, he had a shit ton of positions on
5273.16s: and a ton of stuff. So obviously he says at one point, I was watching the January 13th stream.
5278.36s: He said he was monitoring over a thousand stocks to some degree, which is that that's just
5284.60s: madman level right from the jump to even try to trade a thousand things, right? Like that's nuts.
5290.60s: I struggle, I struggle keeping an eyeball on like 150 names.
5296.28s: Yeah. Yeah. He's operating on a level that is completely unbelievable.
5305.16s: But I was going to point out, I did want to point out really quick here. The timing on his,
5309.08s: because there's always all this timing going on between his yellow updates and his tweets.
5312.92s: So his most recent tweets were when he's buying the shares. Then this one seems to be the macro,
5319.24s: I think this is macro room, or I don't know who this is, this a tennis player. This one's on
5324.12s: the 17th, which is when GameStop's volume drops off a cliff, right? And then this one is like this
5331.32s: one about this movie Bruno, right? Where he's talking about going away, he's a he's a profit sort
5336.20s: of, and like people don't like his prophecies. And Bruno, I believe in the movie, people say it goes
5342.04s: away for 10 years. So he goes away for exactly 10 days, calls the chewy spike to the day.
5348.60s: This is when Chewie hit $40. And he had built his position in Chewie, you know, leading up right
5355.00s: into that spike, especially on the 24th. And then he filed a 13G a couple days later.
5361.24s: And then we didn't know what this meant at the time. But then this is like his 13G gets,
5365.40s: and then we look back and we're like, oh, that's we've been chewing. So it's like, quick question.
5370.20s: Yeah. The do you think that there is any forewarning with the Chewie position between those two
5377.56s: components between here and here? Yeah. Well, there's the 35 emojis in the Missy Elliott meme.
5387.00s: And the the dog is in one of those, right? So I don't have those 35 emojis off like on hand. I
5393.72s: should give me a tap on the screen. If you give me a second, I had them. Yeah, give me one second.
5403.16s: Yeah, I should probably just put them down here. And can we also just shout out the fact that
5407.80s: we're talking about emojis from a Missy Elliott video? Right. Where are you in R.A.? And the
5415.88s: in the whole of the fact that I've got all these memes here. I mean, sooner or later, you and him
5422.04s: are going to have to go out for a beer like a seltzer water or something. And something dude. I
5427.40s: feel yeah, I feel like I feel like that's probably fair at this juncture. I don't even this guy
5434.52s: is operating on levels. Well, here's the other thing to think about. You're you're probably aware of
5439.48s: this. So he's he's clearly so he's got his three personalities, right? He's got his crazy
5445.40s: yellow posting account, DFE. He's got his roaring kitty Twitter, right? Where he posts tweets,
5454.92s: and then he's got his live stream personality and his Keith Kill personality. But what's crazy to
5461.80s: me is this idea that you can go all the way back to his means who is making back four or five years
5471.00s: ago or how many years ago was it now three or four years ago? Lost you there. There you are.
5480.04s: And he was telling the story even back then because if you look back at his memes like for example,
5485.08s: let me pull one up for you just to give you an example here. I don't know if you've gone back and
5488.52s: watched these. This is like this is where things get so crazy to me. Check this out. I'm going to
5494.84s: go grab a water real quick, but you can keep going. Let me find this one back here.
5507.48s: There we go. All right. So for the folks watching along, Eric's grabbing the
5525.56s: seltzer water because he's addicted to those things. But roaring kitty's memes from even back in
5531.48s: the day have the same characters. I think we've even got let me find. So here's green.
5539.56s: Green represents DFE. So John Candy is DFE. Yellow are all the long holders on GameStop.
5547.96s: And then we've got let me try to find this spot where we get there we go. Here's Ryan Cohen
5554.92s: right here in blue. So he's been telling this story the whole time with his characters.
5560.12s: And he's still just picked it up right where he left off three and a half years later. And I think
5563.56s: that's absolutely crazy. It blows my mind. You guys can tell me in chat what you guys think about that
5570.36s: whole thing. Hold this up again.
5574.12s: So let me see where's Eric. We lost. We lost him. I'm trying to play up the chat right now.
5590.52s: Oh, there you are. I was just I was just grabbing a reload on seltzer waters, man. You I told you.
5596.12s: It's like the I go through so much liquid, especially because like I typically intermittent fast.
5604.04s: But the choice liquid is seltzer waters, bro. Oh, are we watching this? Do you have it sharing volume?
5610.52s: I was just showing it the volume I'm not going to show. I'm just showing that the characters are
5614.92s: already defined. He posted this. No, it's going to say you should play it. Let's see. Can you hear it?
5621.88s: Negative. Okay. When you when you go into share screen, there's a specific tab like if you're
5627.32s: sharing your window. So if you unshare your screen and then share it again, there will be a thing
5632.20s: that'll say share audio. I just wanted to show that this was posted all the way back March 30th,
5638.52s: three years ago, right? This was his last like big meme that he posted before doing his final
5643.08s: yellow update, double down in this position. But his characters are already all defined. Yellow
5648.84s: are Wall Street Bets long haulers. That's us saying what's going on here? He's got he shows up as
5655.40s: John Candy basically saying, you know, I can help you out here. This is his green is DFE.
5663.16s: And then he points to his crew. And his crew was Ryan Cohen in blue because that's always been
5670.36s: his color coding that he uses here. It later refers to the blue character is chewy.
5675.80s: Starting all about games down here. You got to kind of watch it to get a sense for it. But I just
5680.52s: think it's crazy that he had already there. We got to see the same guy. So they're going to cruise
5686.44s: along and pick him up. So you know, this is the Wall Street best people saying, you know, my
5692.60s: GME positions down. I bought in January. Then I got a diamond hands forever. But now what am I going
5697.56s: to do? He's got the crying Michael Jordan emoji right here. And then basically he says here at the end,
5707.00s: those risks and I can't guarantee anything. But I expect GameStop will be able to drive you to
5712.92s: your cost basis. It's on the way to what I feel could be fair value. It took three and a half years.
5719.64s: This is crazy, right? Crazy that he dude. It's nuts. It's absolutely nuts.
5729.32s: Quick admin note from the chat. Dunn Oak says that they want to do a poll to see if you are
5735.64s: cooler or Darth Vader, which Dunn Oak, I'm happy to do that. Just provided that we revisit basic
5743.40s: manners. And if you phrase that like a human being, I'm happy to run that poll for you. In the meantime,
5749.40s: there's a poll that's going right now, which is do we think RC will extend an offer to RK to join
5758.20s: the investment board. 36% say yes, 64% say no. What say you Richard?
5766.28s: I would say no. Yeah, I don't think that that would be a wise decision at all.
5772.52s: I agree. I think that the two of them don't have any communication. They really shouldn't
5779.24s: for legal reasons. I think that Ryan Cohen's got to be extremely careful. Everyone in GameStop
5784.28s: has got to be extremely careful. The whole thing's under incredible scrutiny. Same thing with
5789.48s: Warren Katie. So like he said, he's very honest and he's trying to be very transparent. I think
5797.16s: that's what he's telegraphing every step of the way. And I wouldn't expect anything like that to happen.
5803.40s: Yeah, I think that's fair and I think people might slightly misconstrue like the intentions of
5811.40s: accumulating a lot of shares, which is the idea of conviction as compared to trying to move into
5818.52s: leadership or run the board or something like that that seems slightly different. He also says on
5825.32s: his stream. I've mentioned this one a lot because I just rewatch it. His January 13th, 2021 stream.
5831.40s: I recommend everyone just watch it. But he says on there, he doesn't know how to run a company.
5836.12s: Like he says, these aren't my areas of specialty. So like you just said, picking up a huge stake in
5841.00s: a company doesn't mean you want to run it necessarily. We're going to involve them in its runnings.
5846.92s: Right. Yeah, I agree with you. It looks like Dun Oak remembered his basic manners. And we are
5855.56s: ready to launch a new poll to see is Richard Newton cooler than Darth Vader.
5865.96s: I'm curious. Is Darth Vader cool? I was literally going to ask. I thought maybe there was some
5871.56s: background to why the Darth Vader selection. But I'm a man of the people provided that the people
5877.24s: are respectful. So I'm going to ask the question. Anyways, the poll is open. Let us know if Newton
5882.84s: is cooler than Darth Vader. That's tough, man. Like, Newton, I got to be honest, man. Like I
5887.56s: genuinely think you're an incredible person. But Darth Vader, you know, like the force, he
5895.72s: nuked Luke Skywalker's arm. Like that's, have you cut a dude's arm off with the lightsaber? I guess
5902.20s: we could start there. Have not. No, I'm not talking about that. And then I guess the only other
5906.68s: following question is have you survived being thrown into magma and then gone on to walk around
5912.84s: in a crazy suit? No, but the last three and a half years of GameStop. Very similar.
5920.12s: Okay. So maybe there it is. And then also here's the other question we have to ask ourselves.
5925.56s: What kind of collector Pokemon cards does Darth Vader have? And did you show us yet the ones
5933.16s: your show me? We're going to take a look at those really quick. So we did pull a glacion so far.
5938.36s: Check that one out, everybody. So that's a
5945.64s: high variety of different Pokemon's. So we got the glacion one, which is over here, which is
5950.28s: pretty exciting. So I thought that was pretty cool because we had talked last time and we talked
5954.92s: about how EVs are favorite and your wife favorite. And then we basically immediately pulled out of,
5960.84s: I don't know if it's a pack from the ones you got us because we've got kind of like a big old box of
5963.88s: packs. I was going to ask what was well anyways, I'll ask you afterwards. I'm curious what was in
5968.76s: those compared to the I don't know shit about Pokemon beyond when I played it on Game Boy advanced.
5974.36s: So you're so far we got a glacion. So that's exciting. We'll see what else we get.
5982.52s: And is glacion is that like a standalone critter or is no. So a glacion evolves from an EV.
5991.64s: So first you got to play an EV and then you can evolve it into a glacion.
5997.72s: Guys, quick note, vamp, lals, you are my hero. The platform is finally back up.
6005.48s: Oh, there you go. This is tremendous news. A giant win really for me, not so much for you guys,
6013.00s: because for me it just means I get to talk about options, which we all know your boy can do.
6017.72s: But let's do that. Do you want to pull those up and show people I do have to go in like 15 minutes
6023.48s: if that's cool? Totally cool. So let me grab this. I'm curious what you can show us with
6031.80s: GameStop options on your platform, because I just learned so much earlier. I found that to be so
6036.36s: valuable. I'll do this. Yeah, I think we'll be able to dive a little deeper. Hopefully.
6044.52s: I'm just checking real quick to make sure that the information is accurate. Yep, it all looks good.
6050.52s: Cool. All right.
6055.16s: Oh, there it is. Doesn't it just nice? It's like being home. Like if you get back from a trip
6063.24s: and you get back to your house and you're like, man, it's just good to be back.
6068.68s: So let's let's dive in. Now, of no, if anybody has any questions on the options chain as we go through
6079.16s: this, let me know there are some pieces missing like this isn't here for some reason. Typically,
6084.68s: this would be here. This is all blank. So we're working with partial information. It looks like it
6091.24s: seems like they're still updating it, but we have enough to work with, I think.
6098.28s: Okay, sort of. So one of the things I was going to show you guys was the expiration
6103.96s: volatility, which is actually kind of important. So for that, I'm going to grab a recent video that I did
6112.92s: give me one sec just to kill the sound. It's going to be kind of like me inception,
6122.44s: but in here, this was after the market closes and we look at the options chain right there.
6128.52s: So you can still kind of see what this should be even though it's not populating. So what I noticed
6135.64s: first is the primary explorations continue to maintain much higher volatility. So that doesn't
6145.40s: inherently surprise me, but I do find it somewhat interesting where the volatility is centered.
6152.76s: So in this case, the 19 July expiration is 139.5% vault. The following expiration goes down to 127
6163.48s: then down again to 120. So right now the market is pricing in more activity here in this expiration
6173.72s: cycle, essentially compared to anything else in the options chains so far. So this is not highly novel
6183.00s: based on what I've seen so far as I've been following GameStop essentially from the end of April
6189.00s: into May, but nonetheless, I think is noteworthy at least in terms of trying to track
6196.04s: where things are happening. So that's the first note. And a quick note on what this means in case
6203.72s: anybody doesn't know, the implied volatility here, implied volatility like we talked about,
6209.32s: this is what the market is pricing fall at and we're just kind of pulling it out. And it's just a
6216.12s: projection of expected volatility, which is just movement. How much do we think something's going to
6222.60s: move? If it has a higher percentage, it means that we're expecting it to move more than other things.
6229.48s: You will notice, however, that some of these with lower percentages like this one out here
6236.04s: shows 121% fall, but a bigger dollar move, eight dollars. It's because it's relative to the amount of
6244.12s: time. That's all. So you're showing the rest screen right now, Eric. I can't. I don't know if I'm seeing
6249.24s: what you're pointing at right now. It looks like I'm not, which is really fortunate that you told me
6254.84s: that because there we go. This one. There is a sellover. Yep. So this is just me inception. So what I'm
6267.64s: in it's kind of blurry. I don't know how easy it is for you guys to see. But what I'm showing you is
6274.36s: that the expiration volatility for 19 July is high on a relative basis to everything else around it.
6283.72s: So that just means the market is expecting movement is the punchline. And then the other thing I was
6288.84s: explaining to people because I've seen a series of questions about, well, why is the expected move?
6295.16s: That's what's within the parentheses is the dollar move. And then out here is the implied volatility.
6303.08s: So the question I've seen is why is it that this has a lower IV, but a higher expected dollar move.
6312.04s: And the reason for that is because this IV is relative to the amount of time remaining.
6318.44s: So even though this has a higher implied volatility, it's relative to a seven day period as compared to
6327.40s: 30 whatever day period. So just to clear that up for some folks. So the first thing I do notice is
6335.24s: interesting volatility. It's not sky high. And again, this is not what we saw back in May. Back in
6342.20s: this was like in the 200s, 300s, it was astronomically high. So I think it's worth pointing out
6350.76s: a differentiation there. Now going back to the platform. Could I have anything to do with the idea of
6357.40s: leading into earnings because earnings was due for early June? It's a good question. The
6366.12s: expiration cycle that would contain that earnings release would have relatively higher implied volatility,
6374.20s: but it would be the cycle that made that offers exposure to the earnings release.
6380.84s: Yeah. So right now, what I see for open interest is there definitely is still pretty heavy call
6391.08s: skew in terms of OI, more calls than puts. We've seen this pretty persistently now. This is a lower gap
6398.76s: than we've seen. So I think that is interesting to me. Now in terms of concentration of where these
6408.44s: options are, we can see that 19 July is absolutely the bell of the ball. This is the busy one.
6416.20s: And you can see the next cycle that is most active is this 16 August. And again, this will line up
6421.40s: very beautifully with the primary option, expiration. This is literally, it's for liquidity.
6426.76s: If you're going through and you're trying to trade options, the standard
6430.20s: expiration, especially in something like GameStop, are going to be more liquid. So people that are looking
6434.68s: to put on bigger positions will go out into these expiration cycles. The other thing I'll show you
6441.88s: quick is volume from a call perspective is much higher than call side than put side. So we are
6451.64s: seeing still a lot of transactions and building. However, there are a pretty noteworthy amount of
6458.68s: puts going on as well for 19 July. So all of this boils down to we are going through and building out
6467.16s: very clearly this expiration cycle. That's essentially what a bull is down to. So a question.
6474.36s: Yeah, man, of course. So a bullish trade, a bullish trade would be selling cash to your puts,
6482.52s: right? So that would show up in the oh, I for puts, right? It would. Now we can detect
6491.72s: how the market is leaning as they're establishing their put positions and I can show you how very quickly
6499.08s: we go back to this one and let's go back to GameStop and then we'll look at like the last week.
6510.76s: Yeah. So what I can do is I can look at the put side and I can look for put transactions that occur
6523.88s: at a specific spot. We can determine if the option was opened via buying the option or selling the
6532.04s: option if it transacts at the bid or the offer. So in this case, if I want to see if people are putting
6539.16s: on a bullish variation of a put meaning selling puts, I can see the transactions that occur at
6547.88s: or below the bid. So this is how I can isolate if we're selling or buying puts. Now I want to be
6557.48s: very clear, this is still a kind of swag. This is still an assessment. It doesn't mean definitively.
6565.00s: It just means the overwhelming probability is that being the case. So that's why we classify
6571.08s: them as this. I just, I think it's important to decipher for people the things that we can conclusively
6576.84s: say for sure versus the things that we're taking as good of an educated guest. But this one is
6582.36s: as close as you can get to something that's probably affirmative without it being 100% affirmative.
6589.80s: So most of the put activity that we see that occurs at the bid or below for the last week,
6598.28s: relatively small positions. The biggest ones we see are at the 125's and their $100,000
6605.48s: positions combined. This looks like the same trade to me because it occurred so close to one
6611.32s: another. And what this looks like is they submitted this initial order and then they moved it. But
6616.68s: this is all the way out in 2026. So hard to tell what this person is attempting to do.
6624.12s: If we limit this to the 19 July op-ex, something a little more current, we see some transactions
6631.56s: coming through here. But none of them are even over 100,000. Like the bulk of this is probably less
6637.56s: than $500,000. Easy. So not a ton of put selling going on. Now the other thing we can do quickly
6646.20s: is to take a look at this theory about using calls, maybe roaring kiddie is selling calls,
6653.40s: right, as part of against the shares to try to generate some sort of profit. And when I look at the
6662.36s: overall transaction volume for the call side, specifically with those kinds of orders, which would be
6668.68s: calls that are happening at the bid or below, that would tell us that we're selling.
6672.68s: There's some positions coming through, but they're not massive either. So the total premium
6678.52s: being pulled in here is not, it's not crazy large. Now the other thing I wanted to do before you
6686.52s: have to jump while we have a couple minutes is actually go back to this and we can model
6692.44s: roaring kiddie's position and we can actually see what he could have made. I think that would be
6696.76s: fun. Okay. Yep. So yeah. Yeah. So we're postulating that this would have happened. I'm sorry,
6704.28s: remind me again, the date window that we think it would be. Well, Jackie said large call buying
6711.16s: occurred twice, but specifically May 1st, 2nd and 3rd. No, is this, is this the, there is a ton of
6721.16s: call volume there. I thought we were looking at the gap to try to build the chewy position. Or is
6725.96s: this the idea that this occurred back in the beginning of May? Let's do the game stop position.
6731.96s: Okay. And, but did we, was one of your ideas that he used, he was trading game stop to create
6740.04s: enough capital to then roll into something else? Was that the idea from before? I don't, I have zero
6746.84s: idea how he could have built the chewy position. I really don't know. Because I thought that's a
6752.04s: mystery to me. Okay. Because I thought one of the things we wanted to look at is the probability
6757.32s: of him being able to turn the, yeah, he only had like five million dollars or so. Or he, because his
6766.28s: last yellow update yet 3.6 million. So I'm just saying let's round it to five and give him the benefit
6771.48s: of the doubt. So if he starts, if he's got five million five million bucks on April 24th,
6780.44s: and could he have turned that in three weeks into the 170 million dollars or so that he needs
6788.84s: to buy all those files and shares? And what was the, what was the date the 24th to when?
6794.44s: So April 24th would be his start date with five million bucks and then May 15th is his end date.
6803.08s: Okay. Yeah. So what we can do really quick is just kind of simulate this. We can go back
6809.64s: into on demand. I don't know how well this is going to work with the platform where it's at
6814.04s: and it's life right now, but we will see. So I'm going back to the 24th of April of 2024.
6823.80s: And we are going to take a peekaboo at these options. And I'm, what I'm going to do is build a
6832.92s: highly advantageous position for him to see if this, how this falls within the realm of
6839.72s: possibility essentially. So we know from 24 April to 15 May, what was the high, what day
6850.12s: occurred that posted the high end stock price? The high was the 14th, but he could have bought
6857.80s: weekly's. He could have bought and made an enormous profit buying
6862.76s: X-ray for the third or X-ray for the 10th and done extremely well. Okay.
6870.44s: Yeah. So what I'm doing is I'm just figuring out the days that we had big price movements and
6875.96s: I'm going to build again, like the most advantageous position I could think of for him,
6880.44s: which what was the high on 14 May? It was like, I don't remember 64,
6886.20s: 63. That's where it's. So let's say that he bought maybe these 15s. So these are a 13 delta
6898.92s: and they're trading for 18 cents. Again, like we kind of know he didn't do this because I can't,
6904.36s: I would have seen the volume come through for this, especially to put on a position this far out,
6908.84s: but just to see even what's within the realm of possibility. So we have $5 million divided
6915.00s: by 18 that tells me he could put on 277,000 contracts, seven, seven, seven. So that's the position we're
6928.84s: looking at. Two, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven. The reason why I'm using these options is
6934.68s: being most advantageous to him is because even though there were really low delta, we know there's
6940.04s: a giant move that occurs in this time frame. So this would give you an idea of what the compounding
6946.12s: could look like if essentially we built a, again, near perfect position relative to the period that we
6954.76s: know. So this comes in as you could tell at like 4.99 million, right? We're using essentially the full
6961.00s: $5 million here. So now what I'm going to do is fast forward us to 14 May.
6970.60s: And then we can just see what these options traded at and then we can see what his P&L would have
6980.28s: looked like. Okay. So this would give him essentially a billion dollars if he, if he ticked it that way.
6996.12s: So yeah. So if in the like most optimal scenario was able to put on a position like this in some
7005.48s: degree, then it is entirely possible that he could have scooped up the capital to do this.
7012.28s: Now again, we can kind of steal man the argument to a degree by changing what we're looking at
7020.12s: really quick, going back to unusual whales. We can go back into GameStop and we can look at this
7028.28s: time frame again, 14 May. You'd want to look specifically, I think, at two windows. The 24th
7035.32s: 25th and 26th for big purchases of calls. The 24th of April April. Yeah, yeah, sorry.
7043.96s: Yeah, let's look real quick. Let's see if there were any good buys there. And then let's kill that.
7050.60s: And then let's kill that.
7055.88s: Okay. So we have the tens being pounded several times. Yep. That's what, so that's what Jackie posted
7064.44s: was the tens. Well, actually, this is on the next week. Yeah. See it's the tens up. So this is
7070.12s: earlier. And these would fall right into that. I see 17 May 17 May. So I see one, two, three, four,
7084.76s: five, six, seven,
7094.76s: 24 May seven.
7099.48s: Maybe just call it eight. So I see eight, essentially 8,000.
7107.64s: What about the May 17th though? Because those may 17th salt print it.
7112.84s: Yeah, I'm using the, yeah, so I included both of those up here. Okay. Yeah, so if we use both
7120.04s: of those expressions just to clean this up a little bit. Yeah, he would have targeted those for sure.
7125.32s: The 17th and the 24th. I don't think he would have targeted. He could have targeted May 3rd.
7130.28s: Are there, is there much activity on May 3rd? That would have been highly risky or April, no May 3rd.
7136.36s: Well, let me see. Let me just sort of super, super risky. No, doesn't look like activity for the third.
7146.04s: Yeah. And I think him trying to build a position in that would be really, really difficult.
7153.80s: Well, then what I think he could have done is sold them all on the third to raise a whole bunch of
7162.04s: sold sold all of what? He could have sold a lot of those when it peaked on the third because it hit
7171.96s: a high on the third. Okay. 1745. He would have made it on a money. And then he could have moved,
7182.52s: he could have moved up to the 30 strike that day. Let's take a look then. So if I give him credit for
7191.00s: essentially pounding all of the tens, let's just look at the tens.
7194.68s: And then again, we can literally simulate what this position could have yielded for him.
7205.72s: So we have a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11, 12, all this and this 13.
7225.08s: So probably 14,000 contracts, ish total.
7231.56s: That's only going to cost him.
7235.24s: It looks like the average price here. Well, there's a couple expensive. We can do the math really quick.
7241.08s: So 14,000. And then,
7245.32s: 2267, 225,
7251.00s: 220, 205,
7254.44s: 200,
7257.64s: 181, 165,
7261.24s: 150, 146,
7265.24s: 140, 114,
7269.08s: 170,
7273.64s: 65,
7275.48s: 50, 35,
7277.24s: 21, 20,
7278.84s: 20,
7280.20s: 19,
7281.96s: 19,
7284.44s: times.
7288.76s: So this would be like a 20,
7293.08s: 20,
7293.80s: how much cash did he have?
7296.60s: Like 3.6 million.
7299.96s: So he would have been way over if he did all of this. So then let's just give him credit then for
7305.64s: 3.6 million worth. And then if we look at the average price just kind of by eyeball, I see
7317.96s: let's call it probably close to two.
7323.64s: So I was going to say, yeah, we'll call it two. So let's say
7330.12s: 3.6 million dollars
7332.76s: divided by two,
7334.28s: Hyundai is 18,000. So essentially,
7340.76s: we're not fully calculating correct based on the average price. I think we're low-balling it a little too much.
7349.32s: So then we could just say maybe he picked up
7353.00s: maybe 11,000 contracts,
7355.96s: ish, and then let's call it that that came in at 3.6 million.
7362.36s: So 3.6 million divided by 11,000
7368.36s: by 100. Yeah, that comes in at like 327 or something like that. That seems a little high, but
7374.28s: we can see. Just have an idea.
7377.72s: Yeah.
7379.72s: All right, up over to this. And then
7385.72s: we're saying that we think this happened on
7390.12s: May or April 24th, 25th, 26th.
7394.28s: So we'll just pick the middle and just pretend that we built the whole position all at once.
7402.68s: This is the quote, like I didn't know how much I love this. This is like detective work with
7407.88s: trades. Yeah, it's cool. Yeah. So we can say we think the
7415.88s: expiration he was transacting was a 17 May, but we're going to go to 3 May and pretend that he
7421.24s: unwound there. And we were looking at the tens. So let's say that he built his position of like 11,000.
7430.28s: And then let's say that the average price for the whole thing all kind of all round it down,
7435.96s: like through maybe like 2.75. I think that's probably a little closer to accurate.
7441.72s: And then we'll analyze that that comes out to like a $2 million outlay that keeps him within his
7447.72s: range reasonably. And then let's move us out to 3 May and let's see what these would be worth.
7454.44s: Let's see. Oh, dude, I'm like, I'm waiting with a baited breath. I want to know what this number is.
7471.40s: 825,000. They lock with a, that's it. That's how much you would make.
7479.72s: Yeah, seems so small. Well, the price went up to $17 that day though. Yep. And it looks like those
7488.04s: tens traded for 375. Okay. That's not a big game. It's not massive. No.
7501.80s: So what is he, so what if he built his, so Jackie's other thing he looks at is I'm probably badly
7507.64s: quoting Jackie, what if he built his position right into that cycle then? What if he built his
7511.80s: position on May 1st, 2nd and 3rd? You want to look at 3rd? Yeah, let's look at purchases there.
7519.72s: Let's take a look. May 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
7529.16s: May 1st, 2nd, 3rd.
7531.64s: We'd be looking at strikes from 10 to 30s.
7538.60s: And then let's look at the call side hitting the offer. Okay.
7548.04s: And then it looks primarily like the 17 May expiration is where I see the size coming in.
7554.92s: Do you think that he would have spread out between multiple expirations?
7563.64s: No idea. Probably pretty short dated though. I don't know.
7567.80s: If he's going super yellow on a cycle happening in the short term.
7572.68s: I would imagine then probably the 17s would be my guess. So if we look at the total size there,
7585.48s: just again, I ball it. I see 1637. I see 1067. I see 85.
7600.04s: And I see 959. Find any other big 17s here.
7607.16s: So it doesn't look like blocks here, right?
7609.80s: During this period of time. No. But there were blocks in that earlier period of time.
7613.80s: So he could have held those all the way up into the 14th I suppose, right?
7617.56s: The ones we've built out before.
7618.76s: Yeah. And we can see what those would have been worth there.
7622.68s: Yeah, then maybe he didn't do two periods of buying.
7627.56s: Because yeah, that other one it just, it doesn't really seem on brand.
7634.92s: What would these be worth?
7637.08s: My not team. Yeah. Take a peek a boo.
7642.76s: 11,000 of them. We can even guide this down. Let's just call it too. Give them the bigger benefit of
7648.44s: the doubt. 19 mil 19.6. See, that's not nearly enough though. He needs to build hundreds of
7655.72s: millions of dollars. Right. That's that's why I was saying like what the responses from before.
7660.60s: It's why I'm fairly skeptical of turning the $3 million into that.
7666.12s: Like even if we give them like in this case, I'm giving them a perfect deal to the doubt. Yeah.
7671.24s: So I mean, even if we size this up, let's say he scooped the 18,000 corresponding size,
7677.96s: which that's more than what even traded there. But that would get him to just 32 mil.
7683.88s: Yeah, it just seemed like so, you know, questions as we kind of wrap up the stream here.
7689.48s: Where did he possibly come up with $170 million to pick up 4.2 million shares?
7701.08s: We don't know when he picked up those 4.2 million shares at all, right?
7704.44s: It was first 4.2 million on top of the $800,000 he had. We do know when he bought his 20s.
7710.84s: So that's we know he had to have had 60 some odd millions, 65 million dollars
7715.24s: during the share offering to buy all those 20s. Where did he get all this money?
7722.36s: I think there are two solutions. I can think of that are the simplest ones. The first one
7729.56s: is he has money in another account somewhere. I think the solution beyond that is that he unwound
7736.60s: some of his game stop position to acquire. That's the second idea.
7745.64s: Yeah. Yeah, because I like that that that was like my biggest question as well as I was trying to
7754.20s: conceive of what like it's not it's not a small amount of money. That's not easy to generate that
7762.68s: amount of capital. So because basically what is it Andrew Citroen capital, what's his name? Andrew
7771.08s: left. Yeah. He keeps asking the same question. The media is asking the same question. Good question.
7777.16s: It's a fantastic question. Because like do I think that maybe he has money in another account
7786.68s: potentially sure that's that's possible but is it a $100 million on top of the $100 million
7795.88s: 60 or whatever he had in his primary account? Could be but like that's I don't know that seems
7802.36s: like a ton to me. I was thinking more that he might be siphoning out like 20 million maybe something
7808.68s: like that that I think could be conceivable for somebody like him that would set up his family
7814.04s: for life. But yeah, it's to me that the the simplest would be unwinding some of the game stop
7822.92s: position. But to your point, I would find it really hard to believe that he would go through the
7828.92s: effort of accumulating 9 million 1000 shares to then unwind it. But then it's also again I go back
7836.36s: off of the the same thing of like who we're dealing with. And would he potentially build that
7842.04s: position to essentially you know send the message to Ryan Cohen high five of them and then do
7847.32s: something else? Not impossible either. So if you think about it based on what we looked at,
7855.08s: what is your best guess on where the capital came from? Well, there's the curiosity too that
7862.36s: is my share is my screen sharing right now? It is. So a curiosity pointed out is right here
7871.08s: which is between these two updates. This one on June 3rd. Look at this cash position here.
7878.84s: 29.29.29.29.2 mil. Yeah. And then it goes up it takes up. And this is going to be interest earned
7887.72s: on the end of end of May. It's pretty obvious. But the the e-trade accounts for a high for
7897.40s: over having over a million dollars in your account only earns you 0.15%.
7902.36s: The disrespect. Right. It doesn't earn you 5.5% like your money market is going to yield you or
7908.68s: something else going to yield. And thus you put it you have to specifically put it into that
7913.00s: vehicle. It's in this right here. My understanding is it's going to earn 0.15%. So if we look at if we
7919.56s: just do simple math here and do. There's my calculator. So if we take how much that represents as a yield,
7926.44s: so I'm going to do 29.409. And then we take away 29.276.
7937.32s: In the meantime, Brad says a guy who loves trading is quite good at it. For three years,
7942.12s: wasn't trading. His large cash reserve built up for this. I I agree with Brad's idea there.
7947.08s: Again, I think the only crux to that idea is if he was being honest during that livestream,
7953.88s: which I would that's again, I take him at his word. He's saying that that's his account and
7960.36s: that's his cash. So we're working under the assumption of that being the case. But to your point,
7965.40s: the wild card is kind of what Newton and I were recently talking about the fact that this could
7970.52s: be money from somewhere else, but we're just kind of working off of what we can cleanly see.
7976.20s: Right. If if he's got is this going to work out correctly? I don't want to. The number here
7982.12s: bothers me, but if he's got this amount chilling in the account at end of May and it's been in
7987.32s: there all month and then he gets point. This will be right, right? 0.15%. That would be
7997.32s: the difference there, right? That's all working out correctly. But that makes sense. He would have had
8003.80s: to have a bunch of money in there. I know people are saying he would have had to have a billion.
8008.28s: Am I doing the math here wrong? So here's a billion dollars. If he was earning a yield of point
8015.08s: zero, zero, or this would be one percent yield, but each rate only pays 0.15% yield. He would have
8024.04s: got a huge dividend at the end of the month. So I don't see evidence of him having a billion
8028.52s: dollars in the account unless I'm doing something. Yep. I agree with you. So he had. I still think that
8035.08s: you would have seen it in the cash anyways. But he would have had in May 90 million maybe
8042.20s: to play with. Yeah. And that I that I think makes sense at the start of this, right? Like because
8050.92s: he came into this whole may move with a big bankroll. We saw in his initial position. What was it?
8058.28s: 168 million total or something like that? Well, this is perfect sense. This actually makes perfect
8063.88s: sense because look at the start interrupt you. But we got the cash here. How much to the options cost?
8068.36s: Like 65. So that's like the perfect amount. He just probably just rolled right into this with the
8074.68s: money to throw down on the options. So he probably came into this with the shares already.
8080.92s: Yeah. I think that that's fair because also we can see well, I don't know if he had the shares
8086.28s: because the price of 21274. Well, you could have bought those and actually his cost basis
8092.52s: were going way over that 15 minutes. I said, but the cost basis on those guys should have been
8098.52s: if he held his previous existing shares, these guys had a cost basis of 1379. His new ones had a
8107.00s: cost basis of 2127. Yep. He could have got these at any point along the way, right? Lots of times
8115.64s: when the stock was at $21 going back. I'm just going to chart here. Oh, you're saying over the past
8122.04s: three years. Yeah, he could have bought these at any of these. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see.
8127.80s: Yeah, I follow you now. Yep. I think that he could have built up $90 million in his account,
8134.52s: accumulated a big position over time, came into this ready to yellow update after buying a
8141.72s: ridiculous amount of calls. I don't know. Well, I think to your point, though, that seems more
8150.76s: probable than that capital being generated and like right at the beginning of. Yeah, from here to here.
8158.20s: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That seems unlikely. All right. Yeah.
8164.76s: Yeah. Cool. I think that was that was a great game stop. Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.
8171.08s: Have an absolute blast doing these with you, man. So well, first off, I don't even know how many
8176.52s: people we have hanging out looks like there's about 455 500 people in here. So shout out to you,
8182.76s: guys, heard hanging out and chat with us about this. I think the idea for Newton and I is to keep a
8189.32s: cadence doing these because we both enjoy taking a look. So we'll probably take a look at doing
8193.96s: another one next week. Obviously, I'll catch up with you to see if that works. But
8200.12s: if we do, it'll be same time same place. We'll announce it for everybody. Newton is always,
8205.08s: man. Thank you for coming in and dropping times the entire time. Super, super fun session.
8210.60s: Like I was cool. It was super fun to learn options, um, learn from someone that knows a ton
8215.64s: about them. So thank you very much for sharing all your your knowledge. Yeah, dude. Absolutely.
8220.60s: I love this stuff. So everybody else, we will see you throughout the week. OMG says,
8227.00s: set an agenda next time. Please, bullshit. As if we go where the winds blow us, man,
8232.76s: that's how this flows. But thank you guys a ton for hanging out and then we'll see you guys next
8238.52s: weekend. Peace out. Thanks everybody. Thanks. Thanks.
8243.88s: And I think we double check.
