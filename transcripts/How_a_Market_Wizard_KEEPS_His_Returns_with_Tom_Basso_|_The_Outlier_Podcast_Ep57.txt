1.28s: [Music]
2.56s: what's up everybody welcome back to
4.28s: another episode of the outlier podcast I
7.08s: have my friend Tom basso back hanging
10.36s: out with us really to ring out the Year
12.88s: this was the last full trading day of
14.92s: 2023 so stoked to finish the year off
18.28s: with you thanks for hanging out yeah I
20.40s: just uh finished up my afternoon run uh
23.80s: 10 minutes before we got on so uh yeah
26.72s: this is the end of the year I head into
29.32s: the long week now how was uh how was
32.00s: your run what' you do oh I just did uh I
35.24s: had a down day today but it was uh a
37.68s: pretty good year
39.88s: yeah that's absolutely awesome so when
44.44s: you look back at 20123 what stuck out to
47.84s: you what was anomalous and the reason
50.16s: why I asked that question is because
52.64s: you've seen a lot of markets right so I
55.40s: started trading in 20 2007 myself and I
59.64s: know that that you've seen much more
60.92s: than I have so I'm always curious to see
64.64s: what kind of things stuck out to
67.00s: different people with different
68.00s: reference ranges I think the I guess the
71.08s: two major things I noticed uh was that I
75.48s: completely would have never predicted
78.04s: that the stock market would be almost at
80.12s: new Highs at the end of the year I
82.56s: figured the economy was probably going
84.48s: to go into a more of a hard Landing uh
88.68s: not a soft Landing
90.72s: and I still don't know that we are going
92.32s: to have a soft Landing I think there
94.24s: that's the jury's out still a little bit
96.00s: on that so we'll see next year how that
98.28s: works out but the one thing that
101.20s: surprised me is the strength of the
103.20s: stock market because it seems to be
105.08s: running on fumes almost uh some
108.36s: indicators that are strange uh I have a
112.24s: stock index trading
114.04s: strategy and despite the fact that on
117.20s: the last five six days the market has
119.88s: made highs each
121.76s: day up to today so through yesterday I
126.12s: noticed that I couldn't get any of my
128.16s: overbought oversold indicators to
130.92s: overbought I thought that was
132.84s: interesting you know it's kind of like
134.52s: the strength isn't there to really Peg
137.48s: the indicators out but it keeps trying
140.28s: to hang on and go up more uh today of
143.40s: course it didn't and uh we'll see
145.48s: whether that spills over in the lot of
148.08s: tax selling for next year ear or what
151.36s: I that that was the one thing that was
154.12s: interesting and that really propelled
155.80s: some of my returns for the year I
158.60s: wouldn't have expected it uh the other
161.16s: thing that was I thought strange and
163.24s: quite profitable and very good for me
165.96s: was that you know the all weather
167.52s: strategy trades like 26 different
170.44s: Futures markets and I not noticed a
172.80s: number of them just went nuts like
175.80s: orange juice had this huge move earlier
178.12s: in the year that was blew my mind and
181.48s: then you know what goes up comes down so
183.60s: all of a sudden it turns around goes the
185.52s: other way and you make a bunch of money
186.96s: the other
188.00s: direction uh coffee had some big moves a
190.76s: lot of the the soft Commodities had some
193.64s: just really violent
196.04s: um just crazy stuff uh so that's been
200.00s: helpful for profits uh the rest of the
203.16s: stuff you know it's just isn't worth
206.24s: worrying about there you know some
208.12s: profitable trades some losers
210.68s: all came out in the wash I think the big
212.68s: highlights were the uh some of the soft
216.12s: Commodities moves that we saw and then
218.72s: some of the in the stock market through
220.76s: the year end when you look at your
223.24s: returns for the year what was the
226.20s: primary driver of the
229.20s: performance well I could Jun around and
231.52s: say
233.52s: Trends Trends were the driver uh if you
236.84s: have a trend you can make money if you
238.56s: don't have a trend you can't
241.04s: uh mostly I'd say the stocks at the end
243.88s: of the year were huge um the the move
247.80s: earlier in the year was profitable but
250.32s: it stopped me out about half of the
252.24s: positions so the ones that hung on were
255.00s: really really quite profitable for the
256.80s: year the ones that got stopped out I had
258.60s: to get back in they're mildly profitable
261.76s: but the through the year end that was
263.68s: one big area and the other area I
265.88s: believe was was the Futures the the
269.16s: commodity really had some strange stuff
273.16s: uh I mean you had wheat doing weird
275.52s: things with
276.88s: Ukraine uh you had uh orange juice Crazy
281.52s: Coffee had some crazy stuff
284.80s: um there's been some very interesting
287.60s: moves in the commodi so that's been very
289.80s: profitable because the trends are hang
292.24s: around long enough for you to really
294.28s: coin some money off of them those that's
297.44s: probably the the two major areas I
300.20s: thought there was quite a little driver
302.04s: of profits another question I had for
304.68s: you is what did you make of the move in
306.88s: the beginning of the year because I
309.32s: thought it was fascinating going from
312.36s: the open to the highs that we saw in
315.52s: early February essentially back to where
318.56s: we opened the year in March and then
321.20s: obviously it was Off to the Races from
322.60s: there but I I just thought that that
323.96s: movement followed by what we saw was
326.44s: very curious I I I don't know what to
328.08s: make of it I'm curious if you have any
329.20s: thoughts on
330.12s: I uh you know I I of course I just
332.04s: follow my indicators I don't predict a
333.96s: lot uh at all actually when I'm trading
337.40s: I I saw that as a feeble attempt to try
341.04s: to get a bull market going or bull move
343.44s: going and it failing and it stopped out
346.84s: about half of my positions the hedges
349.00s: actually went on uh so I was hedged for
352.16s: a little bit there and then then I got
354.04s: whipsawed out of the Hedge and all the
356.72s: Longs started coming back in and all of
358.68s: a sudden
360.04s: right now I'm 30 out of 30 sectors long
363.32s: everything is long it's uh clearly that
366.72s: early move was a fake out and a test and
369.92s: then U then we got back on the train and
373.76s: right through the end of the year it was
375.04s: been a just a crazy move up I think uh I
378.92s: have no idea whether it'll be able to
380.64s: hang on in the next year I I'm not going
383.64s: to even bother predicting because it
385.12s: doesn't make any difference for those
386.72s: who want to try to predict I'd say that
390.44s: all I would worry about is to be ready
393.20s: to react quickly uh expect potential for
397.76s: it moving very fast because there's so
400.20s: many people with so many profits built
402.20s: up so many nervous Nellies uh about what
406.00s: might happen if you get some tax selling
410.12s: causing it to be loose early going here
413.16s: and then any kind of incident just you
416.76s: know out of the blue something happen
419.44s: happens economically the fed the you
421.72s: know the wars that we seem to be in
426.08s: anything uh could touch uh touch off the
429.28s: flame you know the and then all of a
431.92s: sudden man everybody be trying to get
433.92s: out the door at the same time it could
435.56s: get ugly so I just be very careful here
439.52s: uh it just seems to me like there's so
441.12s: much volatility and so much potential
443.72s: for disaster I just enjoy the ride while
446.44s: you can to the upside and be prepared to
448.56s: do the other if you have
450.20s: to what do you make of Tech's overall
454.48s: strength and I want to open the question
457.20s: up a little deeper than that as compared
459.76s: to just
461.36s: 2023 from your studies of the markets
464.84s: what other references do you have where
468.28s: a single sector has single-handedly done
471.84s: what tech has essentially done over the
474.36s: last five years if anything well not
477.32s: over the last five but if you go back to
479.00s: 20 ,000 which would be getting ancient
481.72s: history for a guy your age probably uh
485.04s: Tech bubble uh in 1999
488.80s: 2000 that was early internet earlier
492.64s: internet and uh the tech stocks were
496.28s: just nuts they were all losing money
498.48s: they were IPOs were coming out and
502.12s: they'd rate a company hundreds of
504.72s: millions or billions of dollars and they
507.28s: hadn't even made a profit yet it was
509.40s: just insanity and you know you looked at
513.36s: that and everybody said well yeah this
516.52s: has never happened before and it is very
518.40s: overbought but it's a new it's a new
521.40s: market you know this is uh never
524.24s: happened to before because we've never
525.84s: had all this technology that's going to
528.60s: change our lives and all this stuff and
531.48s: eventually the profits will come and the
535.04s: lesson to be learned is the tech stocks
537.40s: ended up going down 80%
540.28s: shortly thereafter now if you fast
543.92s: forward all the way to now a few tech
546.48s: stocks like Amazon Facebook or meta and
550.12s: um Google and so on uh were able
555.12s: to you know figure that out survive that
559.12s: debacle and end up you know making a ton
562.00s: of money over the last couple decades
566.16s: but that kind of what's Happening Tech
570.00s: now almost seems to be a little well you
574.04s: know there's the AI spin
577.36s: which I don't know that anybody's making
579.76s: money off of it yet they're pouring a
581.68s: lot of money into
583.16s: it and then you've got the tech stocks
586.64s: in general uh you've got competitions
589.56s: you've got multi-billion dollar fines
591.72s: coming down from the EU for some of
593.72s: these people you've
596.24s: got I don't you know Amazon's not
600.64s: the PowerHouse it was I mean they're
603.56s: trying to now run ads uh on Amazon Prime
607.44s: to kind of make some more money
609.76s: there you
611.92s: know I think there's going to be
614.16s: competition if the economy goes
617.08s: south then a lot of advertising is going
620.08s: to dry up a lot of Amazon orders are
622.88s: going to still you know kind of dry up a
625.44s: little bit or at least people will spend
627.04s: a little less it get a little ugly if uh
631.96s: if everybody gets the momentum going the
633.88s: other way for a while because
637.08s: everything's sort of been overdone
639.08s: lately and there's those that will
642.16s: say you know it hasn't been overdone you
644.80s: know we we could with AI or with a
647.96s: booming economy all of this stuff could
650.12s: still make even more money and there's
653.12s: new tech stocks that are coming out all
655.08s: the time and they could make money and
656.96s: all that I just think the stock market
659.04s: Market is very uh just kind of a little
663.04s: nervous right now and uh there's just
666.32s: been it's been such a good run and I
669.96s: don't think the economy is going to do
672.44s: that great next year I I'm not seeing it
675.84s: I I still think soft Landing could be
678.88s: tricky fed has never been lately uh for
683.08s: the last few decades probably very good
686.40s: at at fine-tuning the economy I think
689.08s: they'd be better off to let the F
691.36s: economy fine-tune itself and sort of get
693.88s: out of the way uh but if if the economy
698.32s: doesn't really if they've gone overboard
700.48s: and the economy slows down and all the
702.40s: numbers start getting uh ugly and we
705.12s: have down interest rates coming down not
707.68s: because the FED is pivoting and going to
710.12s: be spurring on the economy but because
712.04s: the economy is just doesn't have the
715.00s: demand for money anymore it's people
717.48s: are people are can't afford a house they
720.48s: can't so you can't get a mortgage if you
723.16s: can't afford a house right I mean so
724.92s: there's not as much demand for mortgage
727.80s: uh I don't know there's a lot of things
729.80s: that could happen that just seems like
731.52s: the economy could go soft if that
733.64s: happens and it trips up the stock market
736.08s: then it goes soft and you got everything
738.16s: kind of caving in uh at the same time
741.48s: and then how do you hide from that you
744.08s: if you're just a stock Trader long
745.92s: you've got no place to hide uh you have
748.00s: to just patiently weit it out if you're
750.56s: an all weather Trader like me you start
752.60s: looking at other opportunities your
754.40s: short bonds maybe or your long bonds and
757.48s: and trying to uh get the the lower
760.16s: interest rate cycle you're maybe got
762.28s: gold going on silver maybe you've got
765.72s: Platinum uh you got things uh you know
768.80s: aluminum to the short side you got softs
771.40s: maybe if there's
772.72s: inflation you you got a lot of food
775.32s: stocks or food uh Futures that you can
777.68s: deal with so so there's profit
779.56s: opportunities out there but you got to
781.16s: be a little bit non-traditional to
783.00s: figure that out what do you make of
785.64s: crude oil
787.64s: here uh well crude oil's been kind of U
792.40s: the last few months sort of going on the
794.32s: sideways uh range it's getting a little
797.80s: soft just real recently and last week or
800.84s: so but uh it's been kind of sideways
803.16s: there hasn't been much major move
805.68s: earlier in the year there was some nice
807.28s: moves that were profitable but
809.40s: lately it's been kind of trying to
810.92s: figure itself out um I noticed gasoline
814.36s: or unlighted gas went to the
816.40s: downside uh crude oil's gone to the
818.68s: downside and natural gas actually broke
821.16s: out to the upside so whatever that
825.08s: means yeah well Nat gas it always feels
828.28s: like kind of the the crackhead of the
830.36s: bunch CU you never I feel like you never
832.52s: really know where n gas is going to pop
835.44s: up and what it's going to pop to yeah um
838.84s: looking at it from I guess an e well a
842.96s: macro
844.28s: perspective what do you think about the
848.00s: extended war in Ukraine and do you think
852.48s: what's going on over there I know we
854.40s: kind of got a bit of a pass so to speak
857.52s: because it was a bit more of a mild
859.00s: winter but if this engagement continues
862.32s: into the next year and we have a less
865.36s: accommodating winner like what do you
866.92s: make of something like that
869.28s: yeah I mean then all of a sudden we need
871.36s: energy and uh we've done our best to
874.96s: mess up our energy grids and with
878.08s: non-fossil fuels that are not reliable
881.28s: they aren't consistent uh we haven't
883.52s: built nuclear fast
885.60s: enough uh you know the it's it's ripe
889.04s: for having disruptions and it's people
892.00s: don't realize that I think uh you know
894.28s: the entire energy industry is on kind of
897.64s: like a couple week to 3 week uh
901.00s: turnaround I mean you got to get the
902.80s: stuff out of the ground you got to get
904.16s: it through the pipelines you got to
905.60s: refine it you got to get it out there to
907.36s: burn it and uh there's not a whole lot
910.96s: of you know long lead time to that uh
914.84s: you know there there's a lead time to
916.52s: Drilling and to finding new supplies and
919.24s: getting all that set up but once it's
921.80s: set up and producing it's from the time
924.84s: it comes out of the ground to the time
926.40s: it's going into your car it's pretty
928.16s: quick and uh so it doesn't take much to
931.16s: disrupt it and if you continue to have
934.40s: shortfalls and then you have something
936.00s: like a weather event or a war um it's
939.32s: pretty easy to disrupt the prices
942.72s: so I I like the market as a trading
945.88s: vehicle because again if markets move
948.40s: you have the potential for profit if
951.08s: markets don't move you can't make a
953.32s: whole lot of money in it so I trade
955.56s: crude oil I trade unle gas and I trade
958.44s: uh
959.32s: natural gas in the energy
962.92s: complex yeah and you brought up an
964.96s: interesting point as well on the the
967.24s: nuclear energy side of things which I
969.56s: find fascinating because I I was I I
973.40s: live in San Diego and there's some
975.08s: nuclear reactors like right on the coast
976.64s: and they're in the process of
977.60s: dismantling it they're taking them apart
980.08s: and I find that just so hard to
983.00s: understand if we're trying to create a
985.36s: more efficient energy source it seems
989.64s: really difficult to find something more
991.40s: efficient than nuclear reactors at least
993.80s: that we have that's scalable right now
996.28s: yet obviously there are disposal issues
999.56s: and that's almost like a a future us
1002.04s: problem which is always difficult you
1003.32s: don't want to kick the can down the road
1004.60s: too far CU then you have to reconcile it
1006.24s: at some point but it's interesting to me
1010.32s: to see the direction we're going with
1011.88s: that what do you sorry yeah go ahead in
1015.36s: uh in in California's case I think
1017.48s: they're nervous
1019.00s: about your nuclear reactors being uh
1021.68s: near earthquake zones that's the problem
1025.08s: there um we have Apollo Verity
1028.80s: here um over here in Phoenix is
1032.16s: generating lots of lots of cheap power
1035.60s: and U we're not in an earthquake zone
1038.28s: here so it's there's no discussions of
1041.00s: dismantling that or anything I would
1043.36s: imagine most people would want to have
1045.68s: more of Po Veri uh it's done a great job
1049.92s: of keeping our cost down on energy and
1051.92s: we sell some of that over to you
1054.52s: guys yeah and it's well it's interesting
1057.32s: too because I I could see the the idea
1060.16s: of earthquakes but down in San Diego we
1062.00s: really don't get them we're not near
1064.44s: much of those massive tectonic plates
1067.48s: but I was looking at the trend across
1069.04s: the us out of curiosity in 1990 there
1072.80s: was1 reactors and as of 2023 we're down
1077.00s: to 93 and it seems like we're continuing
1081.12s: that Direction one of my ideas though is
1084.32s: I feel like while we might think that's
1087.56s: a good environmental decision in the
1089.56s: short term I imagine we'll come to a
1092.04s: point where we realize like oh this
1094.64s: is actually not working we we're not
1096.56s: having a stable system anymore we need
1098.72s: to build more of these yeah is that some
1102.20s: like I don't know how closely you follow
1104.08s: power I know since you trade Futures you
1105.76s: probably have at least a peripheral
1107.40s: understanding of it if not
1108.84s: but I'm curious what you think of that I
1110.60s: I came really close to studying chem
1113.04s: nuclear Engineering in college and I
1114.96s: ended up in chemical engineering instead
1117.32s: it all came down to the scholarship
1120.68s: flows from different universities and
1122.92s: the my best deal was at Clarkson and
1125.28s: they didn't have nuclear engineering so
1127.04s: chemical was my pick and I I really
1129.84s: loved chemistry so it was great but and
1132.96s: it all worked out in the end I'm can't
1135.88s: kick too much about my life has been
1137.88s: pretty pretty blessed the I'd say the
1142.60s: the nuclear side of things is that I
1146.60s: think
1147.68s: you you got to ask yourself globally and
1151.20s: you if you do this in today's world and
1154.28s: you ask yourself with the demand that we
1156.72s: have for
1157.96s: energy how are you going to supply it
1161.60s: reliably nothing I'm seeing coming out
1164.20s: of say the current administration at
1167.24s: all at all makes any sense to provide
1171.36s: the amount of reliable energy that would
1174.04s: be necessary to do the things that they
1176.60s: seem to want to do like if they want
1179.40s: everybody to drive an EV you got to have
1182.84s: electricity we have all sorts of coal
1185.44s: fired plants wind energy and solar are
1190.12s: not reliable and are not cost effective
1193.16s: they will destroy our economy there's no
1196.60s: way you can come up with enough energy
1198.24s: energy to satisfy the needs of the
1200.36s: United States or the world without
1203.08s: fossil fuels so with all du respect to
1207.00s: anybody who wants to do something the
1209.28s: reality is you can't it won't work uh
1213.40s: nuclear is sort of
1216.24s: uh a kind of thing
1219.12s: where uh you know you do have some
1221.52s: problems with it on disposal but it does
1224.72s: generate inexpensive power part of the
1227.60s: reason it is so expensive to put one of
1230.44s: those in is all the regulations and
1233.60s: stuff that environmental impact
1236.00s: everything else it seems like the
1238.32s: anti-nuclear crowd has gotten involved
1241.08s: in making nuclear reactors very
1244.20s: difficult to for new ones to come on
1246.56s: stream but that would probably be the
1249.00s: most environmentally
1251.68s: friendly probably coste effective once
1254.12s: it's in type of way of producing energy
1257.60s: sadly
1258.76s: there doesn't be there doesn't seem to
1260.80s: be the amount of enthusiasm for it that
1264.12s: you and I might
1267.00s: have yeah and I'm curious if there's
1270.96s: going to come a point where we realize
1272.52s: we have to make some changes because I
1273.76s: know Elon Musk actually has talked a
1275.84s: couple times about this interesting
1277.88s: concept where it's I I don't know the
1279.80s: exact size but a relatively small solar
1284.08s: farm could be built and power much of
1286.52s: the US if it's put in the desert
1288.52s: actually I don't uh somewhere in the
1290.72s: southwest I don't remember exactly where
1291.96s: he was talking about maybe Nev a small
1294.20s: nuclear no so actual solar so I'm
1298.44s: curious he and he's and he's convinced
1301.92s: he says that and it's not a big actually
1304.40s: let me see if I can find it real quick
1305.84s: because it's really interesting because
1307.88s: part of me thinks if his position on
1311.80s: that influences stuff like this Market
1314.20s: where people might be thinking well if
1315.68s: this does work then I I mean to elon's
1319.20s: point this would definitely be better
1321.32s: than I would uh I would disagree in that
1324.40s: I've done some research on
1326.68s: solar the the amount of solar in the
1329.68s: middle part of the day and I live in
1331.40s: Arizona it's sunny three 330 days a year
1334.64s: here so we do have some solar but the
1338.32s: amount of solar power that actually
1341.00s: comes into a square
1343.24s: footage area of the Earth unobstructed
1346.60s: by clouds or anything else
1349.20s: is a certain fixed amount of energy you
1354.04s: can't even capture all that energy yes
1358.00s: it I admit it's free collecting it is
1360.52s: not free you got to buy the solar panels
1363.16s: and all that and current technology they
1365.60s: can only get a fraction of that very
1368.12s: limited energy per square foot if you
1371.20s: take that and look at what kind of
1374.24s: energy needs you have in the world
1376.68s: there's just no way that solar will
1378.60s: provide it it can't yeah his I I found
1381.80s: the line that he was talking about and
1383.40s: he says this is a a quote from musk
1386.16s: during a podcast with Joe Rogan and it
1388.48s: says uh this is from Elon Musk and he
1391.24s: said you could actually power the entire
1393.12s: United States with 100 miles by 100
1395.64s: miles of
1396.80s: solar which is an interesting idea
1401.48s: obviously you need batteries all that
1403.80s: kind of stuff to support it and I think
1406.40s: it's kind of like I think there's a
1408.68s: pretty fair probability of what we saw
1410.80s: with windmills that's another thing we
1412.80s: have out here is windmills and a bunch
1414.64s: of them just they don't windmill anymore
1416.92s: some of them areic and some of them
1418.20s: aren't and we found that there's very
1421.40s: little juice that's not worth the
1424.88s: squeeze for windmills so part of me is
1428.08s: curious if we would find something like
1429.76s: that but also who knows you know the the
1432.20s: advancement of Technology but I think to
1434.44s: your point anyways we have something now
1437.00s: that does work we know it works works
1438.96s: really well and we're kind of going the
1441.64s: other direction long term the energy
1444.12s: solution to all of this and it would
1446.04s: just completely disrupt the world and
1449.92s: and turn OPEC upside down and everything
1453.32s: else would be Fusion they've now run uh
1456.76s: Fusion Energy and created a net positive
1459.84s: and they've replicated it three times in
1463.44s: in uh three separate tests so it's not a
1466.84s: fluke it's not just a a measurement
1469.68s: problem or anything now that they've
1471.32s: replicated it three times now we got to
1473.92s: figure out how to make a uh Fusion uh
1477.36s: plant out of it and keep collecting that
1479.72s: energy because now you have all the fuel
1482.40s: in the world right off your Shore in San
1484.92s: Diego you just take water you get some
1487.52s: hydrogen away you go and now you've got
1490.56s: as much energy as the world would ever
1492.32s: need and there's zero
1494.56s: pollution that's Fusion Fusion Energy
1498.76s: ends up uh combining together the uh the
1503.56s: hydrogen molecules you end up with water
1505.52s: Vaper coming out of the other side of
1507.48s: the reactor so there's zero
1510.68s: radiation yeah I saw a really
1513.12s: interesting thing coming through from
1515.60s: Toyota that they had built a hydrogen
1519.16s: fueled car that essentially um Works off
1523.44s: of this thesis I I think no that's no
1527.08s: that no I know that one too that's a
1530.08s: hydrogen fuel cell right so that would
1533.28s: be a different wrinkle it would not be
1535.88s: Fusion Energy Fusion Energy you could do
1539.60s: in a power plant type setup just like
1542.88s: poo ver over here you could set up a
1544.88s: fusion part of the plant and it would
1547.52s: just generate a lot of heat and
1550.40s: therefore Steam and therefore Drive the
1553.48s: turbines and create the electricity and
1556.00s: you'd be able to power the grid
1558.32s: and if you had a supply of water you'd
1560.08s: have a just a infinite supply of water
1562.80s: you'd have an infinite supply of energy
1565.48s: and you would be able to power the Earth
1568.36s: really easily and once you got it set up
1570.92s: if it could be self- sustaining without
1572.64s: a whole lot of moving Parts you could
1574.92s: really create some very inexpensive
1577.08s: energy and OPEC would just be gone you
1579.80s: wouldn't they would lose it power then
1582.32s: now when you have zero or very low cost
1585.52s: for
1586.40s: energy now now you have different
1589.00s: options for trying to uh have grids that
1593.20s: allow say electric cars that aren't
1595.84s: running on batteries they might you
1597.64s: might be able to you know have commuting
1600.60s: with uh induced electricity into a like
1605.84s: a driver ra something you know it's hard
1608.72s: to imagine what you could do
1610.72s: but Fusion Energy could drive the cost
1613.80s: of energy down so much and make it so
1616.60s: abundant that would disrupt the world
1619.52s: huge and it for a positive way and it
1622.64s: would get rid of fossil fuels for all
1624.96s: those that think there is global warming
1628.76s: or cooling or climate change or anything
1631.64s: that should satisfy them because you're
1633.56s: getting no radiation you're getting no
1636.80s: byproducts and you got very inexpensive
1639.32s: energy so that would be uh you know a
1643.72s: good thing there and um Smog and those
1647.16s: types of things would be weigh down
1649.08s: because you wouldn't have any uh you not
1651.08s: burning
1652.40s: hydrocarbons um so all good but uh so
1656.28s: far that hasn't happened yet I
1659.24s: keep yeah it's I I'm always curious what
1662.00s: the what the motivation is behind those
1663.72s: things um and what I was referencing
1666.12s: earlier I actually do want your your
1667.56s: thoughts on this is so Toyota they're
1670.40s: looking at the hydrogen combustion
1672.24s: engine and really what I was tying it to
1674.04s: is the use of water and how we're trying
1676.56s: to use water for different energy
1678.52s: sources but what I was reading you
1680.84s: probably know this better than me is
1682.40s: that they're seeing that those kinds of
1684.32s: engines actually release a lot of
1686.12s: nitrogen which leads to other potential
1690.00s: issues which do you think that there is
1693.12s: a future for something like hydrogen
1696.44s: combustion engines specifically that you
1699.16s: know like the Toyota is trying to
1700.64s: develop it's still early they really get
1703.20s: terrible mileage they're underpowered
1705.04s: just like the beginning of any you know
1706.48s: combustion engine
1708.00s: I'm not sure it's combustion I think
1709.56s: it's hydrogen fuel cell um at least the
1713.76s: the article I'm looking at now calls it
1715.52s: hydrogen combustion engines and it says
1718.40s: be a possibility you could do that that
1720.36s: would be a little trickier because now
1721.88s: you're going to burn hydrogen which is
1725.04s: extremely burnable and you're going to U
1729.40s: you're going to have to have that engine
1731.52s: be able to withstand the forces of a
1733.88s: hydrogen
1735.00s: combustion uh so that yeah it's doable
1738.08s: but I wouldn't think it'd be easy as
1739.80s: burning gas so yeah good luck to Toyota
1743.36s: probably cost prohive still yeah because
1744.96s: the other thing I found in there that
1746.08s: was interesting is obviously you need
1747.80s: like these pressure tanks that then if
1751.00s: you get into a car crash doesn't lead to
1754.00s: mini atom bomb going off you know no
1757.24s: that wouldn't happen actually you have a
1759.52s: better chance of having an explosion
1761.44s: with gasoline than you do with
1763.08s: compressed hydrogen is if you crack that
1765.92s: with the hydrogen you would um you would
1770.00s: pretty much just have an escape of gas
1773.48s: uh and it would be a a very quick
1776.92s: violent little uh you know like puff and
1782.28s: then that would be pretty much it you
1784.52s: would not be able to create
1787.24s: um enough expion to create the explosion
1791.04s: I don't think interesting yeah so I
1793.92s: think you hydrogen actually I think as a
1797.64s: compressed gas could be less dangerous
1801.32s: than I
1802.24s: believe gasoline is if you have a rear-
1804.88s: end collision in a gas tank and there's
1807.16s: a spark you could blow up a
1810.00s: car
1811.72s: right interesting yeah it's I I'm
1815.20s: actually always fascinated by the
1818.64s: different advancements that we see in
1821.00s: Auto because to your point when I think
1823.00s: about something like OPEC I also think
1825.00s: about automotives that's obviously a
1827.32s: massive massive part of that equation um
1831.28s: a couple other questions I had for you
1833.88s: from a few things you touched on earlier
1835.76s: the first one is you're talking about
1838.00s: early in the year your Hedges coming on
1840.48s: and getting stopped out on some of those
1843.12s: yep I wanted to level down a little bit
1846.28s: from where you're at in the way that you
1848.68s: trade and to put it into the perspective
1852.04s: of a smaller newer retail Trader what
1855.96s: are some ways that you think that they
1858.68s: could apply a similar methodology where
1863.56s: based on current market circumstances
1866.04s: Hedges start to scale on by themselves
1870.28s: essentially well the way I think the
1873.84s: simplest form is to not be exposed to
1876.84s: the risk by getting out of the risk so
1878.52s: the very first thing I'd consider doing
1881.44s: is looking at your portfolio portfolio
1884.20s: and and asking yourself is there any way
1886.24s: I can just set up
1888.24s: some Trend fing models on the tickers
1891.68s: that I own and when the the indicators
1896.08s: go south um you just bail out of them
1899.08s: you just sell off those positions you're
1901.80s: never going to get the top when you do
1903.52s: that
1904.96s: uh but you'll be able to hopefully avoid
1908.28s: the 80 you know 50 to 80% down Market
1911.80s: that could happen real easily with how
1914.36s: extended we are right now um
1917.96s: the Hedge idea that I use gets a little
1921.96s: bit more one level up on the
1924.36s: sophistication because what you're doing
1926.36s: there is you have a portfolio long so
1929.20s: let's say you've got some names you know
1930.88s: if Amazon or something like that you
1932.80s: could sell that in a second I don't know
1934.56s: how many times a second Amazon trades
1937.60s: but I'm sure there's such a liquid
1939.04s: Market you can just bail out of it and
1941.16s: go to cash if you want but let's say
1943.48s: you're into some kind of XYZ high-tech
1946.60s: small
1948.36s: not so liquid uh type company but it's
1951.28s: done real well you want to preserve the
1954.32s: profits you like the thing for the long
1956.16s: run and you want to hedge it well then
1958.88s: you're going to be mostly affected by
1960.72s: the stock market itself so take the S&P
1963.24s: or the NASDAQ might be a good choice if
1966.28s: you were the tech stock and just set up
1969.48s: a tracking it could be a moving average
1971.96s: it could be a you know a a Kelner a
1975.60s: Ballinger band ION channel any one of
1978.68s: the above uh invent your own if you want
1982.24s: uh point and figure bar chart would work
1984.28s: there's lots of lots of trend falling
1986.04s: models out there and lots of parameters
1989.12s: associated with those models and what I
1991.96s: would encourage an investor to do is to
1994.60s: look at his own time frame that he's
1997.36s: concerned with like I tend to just be
1999.68s: sort of a one month time frame in a lot
2002.60s: of my indicators uh on the longer term
2005.16s: stuff so 21 business day or 21 trading
2008.16s: days is about a parameter where I see
2011.64s: I'm comfortable with measuring what the
2014.12s: Market's do anything inside of a month I
2017.76s: really don't want to take a lot of
2019.24s: actions I don't want to be long and
2020.76s: short three times inside the month so 21
2024.68s: days to me is my parameter set for a lot
2026.88s: of my longer term stuff and I've even
2030.24s: gone to one step further than that to 50
2033.04s: days for hedging to the downside so so
2037.16s: when that goes over though when I have a
2039.72s: 50-day parameter indicator set that says
2043.20s: the direction now is down you have your
2046.40s: choice do you want to get out of all
2048.16s: those stocks which it might be you know
2050.12s: you might have 10 or 15 or
2052.32s: 20 or do you want to just put on one
2055.08s: index trade to the downside and kind of
2059.52s: balance those two so on the one side
2061.80s: you've got your stock portfolio to the
2064.80s: upside and the other side you you put in
2067.08s: Place sort of a a negative position that
2069.92s: tries to make money this way and when so
2072.60s: no now no matter what happens in the
2074.56s: market or your stocks it sort of just
2076.48s: balances out so to me it's just easier
2080.16s: for me to do a calculation of my
2082.60s: portfolio and say hey if I put on x
2085.24s: amount of contracts of standard Forest
2088.76s: 500 futures I'm hedged it's like a
2091.96s: non-event now the market goes up I make
2094.16s: no money if the market goes down I make
2096.12s: very I don't lose a lot of money I'm
2099.36s: just basically flat and but to me it's
2102.72s: easier to take the one transaction on
2104.60s: and off than to try to deal with a whole
2106.40s: portfolio of like 30 sector
2109.32s: ETFs uh which each have to have their
2111.64s: own individual stop orders and you got
2113.84s: to maintain those and you gotta you got
2116.24s: to do all that uh I think the other key
2119.04s: wrinkle here for the average new
2121.56s: investor that wouldn't think this
2123.32s: through very well is if they enjoyed a
2127.48s: nice year in
2129.32s: 2023 and let's say they had 10 issues
2132.64s: and they nailed the bottom and they've
2134.16s: had a great run chances are one or two
2137.52s: or three of those are a lot bigger in
2141.36s: terms of their uh percentage of the
2144.12s: portfolio than they were at the
2145.84s: beginning of the year and something I'm
2149.60s: a big believer in is trying to keep the
2151.84s: portfolio as balanced as I can within
2154.48s: reason I you got to give the issues a
2157.92s: little room to move and make you money
2160.04s: you can't you can't be constantly taking
2162.92s: off profits
2165.68s: if the issues just barely moved so but
2169.28s: what I mean is let's say you've
2172.12s: got I don't know U say you did 20 stocks
2177.16s: and you ended up 5% in each of 20 stocks
2181.24s: and now your portfolio is nicely ahead
2183.60s: say 20
2185.08s: 30% but it turns out that you no longer
2189.28s: each have 5% anymore because three of
2192.08s: your positions are now 10% each of your
2196.64s: portfolio you should consider and I
2199.52s: wrote the book uh you know successful
2201.32s: Traders size their positions why and how
2204.56s: because I think not very many people do
2206.72s: a good job of managing their existing
2209.84s: positions so what you could consider
2212.20s: doing is rebalancing your entire
2214.92s: portfolio which will mean for forcing
2217.04s: yourself to take those three or four
2219.52s: stocks that ended up making a ton of
2221.56s: money and are now throwing your
2223.64s: portfolio out of balance you try to
2226.08s: bring it back into balance you maybe
2228.64s: stay with the issues you already have
2230.72s: you maybe peel off some of your profits
2233.08s: from the ones that are are doing great
2235.96s: things and I'm not saying to sell at all
2237.96s: I'm just saying to get the portfolio
2240.64s: back to balance somehow so that you
2243.28s: don't have that
2244.68s: exposure uh to the three names that have
2247.96s: done great great things and are a
2250.00s: significant part of your money and if
2251.64s: those three things go against you now
2254.16s: they're going to be a significant a part
2255.84s: of your draw down that's about to happen
2258.64s: by peeling things off you're modifying
2261.04s: the exposure so that you smooth out your
2263.48s: track record and you you'll uh reduce
2266.20s: that first part of that next draw down
2268.16s: you're going to suffer sooner or later
2270.64s: you know it might be 2026 but uh
2274.88s: whenever it happens you're prepared for
2277.56s: it and you've actually prepositioned
2279.44s: your portfolio to be
2281.84s: balanced which means you're going to
2283.72s: minimize the effect of the
2285.80s: downswing and so many Traders you know
2289.40s: have a struggle the reason they're not
2292.36s: Mr Serenity uh my nickname there uh you
2296.64s: know if you you properly manage your
2299.16s: positions and keep everything balanced
2301.28s: and you think ahead and you get prepared
2303.76s: to put Hedges on you get prepared to
2305.80s: time out of positions you get a market
2309.00s: that you know turns around goes down 50%
2311.60s: you take it and stride you no big deal
2313.56s: you're you're ready for it uh if you're
2316.40s: not prepared for it it's hard to be
2318.20s: Serene about it because you're watching
2321.36s: the market shred your portfolio uh so
2324.08s: that's the key to success long term and
2326.20s: I I've been through so many bare markets
2328.88s: I've lost track how many um but uh I
2332.84s: think it Seasons you and it gets you
2335.32s: preparing ahead of time to deal with it
2337.68s: so that you're not caught by
2341.04s: surprise now another thing that you
2343.92s: mentioned during that that I want to key
2346.76s: in on was the purpose of the Hedge and
2350.76s: how you tie it to a few different
2353.72s: factors one of which being if you're in
2356.28s: a product that's less liquid and you
2358.84s: know the target might be moving a bit as
2361.60s: you're trying to find the door I think
2363.56s: it's an important point to linger on
2365.48s: briefly just because is I feel like a
2367.88s: lot of retail Traders they come across
2370.92s: the idea of hedging and they think well
2373.72s: this is great now I make money in all
2375.72s: directions you know obviously this is
2377.64s: the coolest thing ever and I think a lot
2380.36s: of Traders forget the fact that a well-
2383.32s: deployed hedge is going to serve as drag
2386.08s: on your returns and you accept that you
2388.56s: accept the fact that you are not going
2391.44s: to achieve the other gains you
2393.04s: potentially could because you were
2394.44s: reducing volatility you are carrying
2396.20s: this hedge I call it fire Insurance you
2399.28s: really don't want to ever collect on
2401.48s: fire insurance but if you have to it's
2404.24s: sure nice to have it um I don't want a
2408.08s: stock market going down 80% I don't want
2410.52s: another depression and have to live
2412.72s: through that uh I don't want even 50%
2416.12s: down on the S&P like we did in 74 7
2420.84s: 7374 um however those things happen the
2425.36s: reality of what we do tells me that they
2428.36s: do happen and they occur from time to
2430.76s: time and a hedge means you're taking the
2434.72s: risk down near zero you're not if you're
2438.04s: making money on the
2440.32s: Hedge and you're making money on the
2442.60s: stock portfolio then you're not really
2445.20s: hedging you're speculating something's
2447.56s: going on there you're over hedging like
2450.20s: if you have
2451.80s: $100,000 worth of U
2454.64s: portfolio and you put in Place $200,000
2458.04s: short on your Hedges and you end up with
2460.56s: a big downside move and you make a bunch
2462.36s: of money off the Futures Hedges and then
2465.20s: you buy them back and then you let your
2466.80s: stocks go up again that's not hedging
2468.76s: you're speculating because you did too
2471.16s: much of the uh S&P
2473.48s: futures uh to hedge means to balance to
2477.32s: to take you to just out of the market
2481.16s: and I think that that's you know it's
2483.80s: appropriate to do sometimes in some
2485.64s: strategies depending on how you
2487.60s: structure your life and all that the
2490.00s: problem I got with just hedging is is
2492.76s: something that has to be thought about
2496.64s: even though it's been an awfully long
2498.32s: time since it happened uh nobody that's
2500.76s: trading now probably is firsthand
2503.12s: experienced it if you have a depression
2506.52s: like situation that where you have an
2509.04s: economic downturn that is really really
2511.80s: severe and lasts for a lot more than
2514.56s: just a year or two try five six seven 10
2518.76s: years a Whole Decade Japan's suffered
2522.68s: kind of a sideways period for the you
2525.04s: know the a few decades here uh our
2528.64s: depression back in the 20s 30s uh in the
2532.56s: US lasted a long time if you have a
2536.00s: situation like that and you're just
2537.76s: hedged you're not making any money
2539.92s: you're not losing any money but you that
2543.12s: would require a heck of a lot of
2545.16s: patience so one of the reasons I like to
2548.32s: dabble in things like Futures and even
2551.24s: crypto Futures and other markets that
2554.52s: potentially could move is there's
2557.12s: potential for profitable moves in places
2560.64s: where you know I'm I'm my stocks I'm
2563.28s: hedged and I'm just holding my own and
2566.40s: if that goes on for years that's not
2569.00s: going to be a great way to fund my
2571.04s: retirement so uh I'm I'm always looking
2574.16s: for other ways and other returns streams
2577.12s: why I'm so big in all weather investing
2580.28s: in trying to say look at look outside
2582.76s: just the stock and barn markets there's
2584.56s: lots of other things out there that can
2586.72s: produce
2587.76s: profits and another thing you mentioned
2589.92s: earlier that I also want to linger on
2593.60s: momentarily was when you're talking
2595.36s: about the trend following approach that
2598.64s: your first quote unquote hedge is simply
2601.72s: exiting when conditions start to change
2604.20s: which to me makes a of sense that's
2606.84s: actually primarily what I do and when I
2609.72s: think about the way that I trade a lot
2612.08s: of the times a hedge would pretty much
2614.48s: go on if I'm levered in some capacity if
2616.88s: I'm not levered I'm probably not hedging
2619.00s: and I'm simply going to manage the
2620.72s: positions that I have on when you're
2622.92s: looking at a small account let's say
2625.40s: less than
2626.76s: $10,000 and we have somebody that's you
2629.92s: know generally new to the market here
2632.76s: what do you think their disposition
2634.84s: towards hedging should be should they do
2637.20s: it should they not do it I would I
2639.80s: probably wouldn't do it i' would
2641.76s: probably uh with that size of account I
2644.36s: would stick to names that I can move
2646.16s: quickly in and out your size on your
2648.32s: positions is going to be extremely small
2650.28s: so nobody is going to you're not going
2652.28s: to move the market to sell your
2653.92s: positions you could easily afford to put
2656.48s: stops in on every position you have
2659.08s: according to some kind of an indicator
2661.24s: that measures the trend when the trend
2663.56s: goes to the negative side from the from
2665.76s: the positive then that's the time to
2668.16s: sell it out lock in your profits reduce
2670.48s: your potential for loss and write it out
2673.52s: in Money Market funds and keep trying to
2676.12s: put more money into your account because
2678.56s: $10,000 is hard to diversify it's hard
2681.36s: to get your cost structures down you're
2683.80s: going to be spending more for everything
2686.48s: with the portfolio so keep working the
2689.52s: day job keep you know pumbing money in
2692.12s: there as fast as you can and and get
2694.32s: your account up in size and then you can
2696.28s: consider doing other uh fancier
2698.72s: techniques in managing risk yeah I I
2702.64s: think that that makes a tremendous
2704.72s: amount of sense and I specifically
2706.20s: wanted to get your opinion on that
2707.68s: because I know that you right now have a
2711.32s: system that includes Hedges that come on
2714.00s: and I think retail Traders don't really
2717.68s: understand frequently enough the impact
2719.96s: that Hedges can have specifically
2721.88s: depending on what they're trading and I
2723.12s: think a lot of them prematurely start
2725.44s: trying to around those as compared to
2727.12s: focusing on things like position sizing
2729.12s: like you're talking about saving getting
2730.92s: out in time um those kinds of things now
2734.48s: one of the interesting things you
2736.64s: brought up before was the money market
2738.32s: fund and it made me think about what did
2740.52s: you think about the movement between
2743.96s: equities and bonds I thought that was
2746.96s: fascinating for a time because a lot of
2749.60s: people would use bonds as their risk-off
2751.84s: asset and then all of a sudden their
2753.28s: risk-off assets also crashing you're
2755.36s: like well what the hell hell is going on
2756.56s: here what did you think about that and
2759.20s: how do you adjust that kind scenario
2761.04s: being being an old gray-haired
2763.04s: guy is that uh I think uh people don't
2768.20s: do a good job of going back in history
2770.32s: and and analyzing some of the things
2772.08s: that have gone on we've had about a 40y
2775.44s: year until about a couple years ago when
2777.80s: interest rates were down around zero uh
2781.00s: for short-term money and money markets
2783.40s: were paying nothing uh we've had about a
2786.80s: four decade or so bull market in bonds
2790.72s: because interest rates did nothing from
2793.52s: 1980 and Reaganomics when the short-term
2796.60s: interest rates got up into the High
2798.56s: Teens it's turned around and spent the
2801.04s: entire for decades coming down and
2803.20s: that's going to fuel a bond market rally
2805.80s: so the 6040 crowd started working out
2808.72s: you know that magic formula to uh uh
2812.84s: supposedly smooth out performance and
2815.48s: you know
2816.72s: it's supposed to be you know good uh for
2819.28s: your long-term financial plan and you
2821.08s: can buy and hold bonds six you know 40%
2823.60s: and 60% in stocks everything's fine um
2827.88s: the problem with that mentality is that
2830.08s: when interest rates get to zero could
2832.48s: they go up from there yeah could they go
2835.56s: down from there kind of hard you're kind
2838.40s: of bumping up against a lot of uh a lot
2842.28s: of problems when you start getting in
2844.20s: the negative interest rates
2846.84s: so all of a
2848.32s: sudden uh a couple years ago when
2850.76s: interest rates started climbing the bond
2852.88s: market got shalacked so all of a sudden
2854.92s: the 6040 crowd takes a hit on their
2857.92s: stocks takes a hit on their bonds and
2861.36s: there's no place to hide and uh so so
2864.24s: much for that risk mitigation it's not
2868.16s: risk mitigation if it doesn't really
2870.68s: reduce risk and you're not taking you're
2873.40s: passively sitting by and saying I'm
2876.32s: Diversified between bonds and stocks but
2878.52s: you're not actively attacking the risk
2882.24s: of bonds or stocks you're just accepting
2885.52s: whatever risk they have and hoping
2888.00s: diversification reduces your risk but if
2891.12s: both go down at the same time you have
2892.92s: no place to
2894.20s: hide um in the stocks the thing that's
2898.80s: happening with stocks a lot and it may
2900.72s: have fueled a lot of this rally that we
2902.60s: see right now is where else you're going
2904.72s: to put your money
2906.92s: uh young kids can't buy real estate
2909.84s: anymore it's they can't even afford it
2911.84s: they can hardly afford their rent um the
2915.80s: interest rates being where they are it's
2917.52s: hard to afford the
2919.12s: mortgage uh even if you've got some
2921.36s: money then you gotta you got to make
2922.88s: these payments on the mortgage you've
2926.16s: got uh I
2928.28s: mean stocks are the
2931.16s: largest liquid Market in stocks in the
2934.72s: US particularly actually where you could
2939.08s: funnel billions and billions of
2942.44s: dollars and have a shot at least of
2947.52s: equaling or bettering inflation
2950.76s: rates right now if you look at like
2954.36s: commercial real estate I'm not so sure
2957.16s: that'd be a great bet I'm not sure that
2960.36s: um bonds I mean if interest rates at all
2966.40s: uh continue to to maintain a little bit
2968.84s: a higher level or go up from here bonds
2971.84s: are nowhere going to keep up in with
2974.64s: inflation stocks could Futures
2979.80s: could real estate prices right now if
2982.84s: you have a soft economy real estate may
2985.96s: have had it its run and it's going to
2987.80s: rest for a
2988.92s: while um I don't know where else you can
2992.36s: go try gold and silver you know there's
2994.72s: times when that moves mov there's a lot
2996.32s: of times when it doesn't it could be the
2999.28s: potential but if you take the silver
3001.00s: concept then why just limit yourself to
3002.88s: Silver why not look at Coffee why not
3004.96s: look at uh you know crude oil uh other
3009.00s: different markets out there that you can
3011.40s: potentially make money in so I think
3014.04s: Commodities and stocks are the only game
3015.80s: in town left lately where you can pile
3018.36s: in large sums of money and that's may be
3022.40s: why a lot of people put money in the
3024.16s: stock market have fueled the ra
3026.16s: late in the year here and whether that
3028.40s: can continue to go on will be another
3030.96s: old
3032.00s: question well you bring up a funny point
3034.52s: I didn't think it was uh too incidental
3038.92s: that when the Fed was talking about
3041.12s: pausing and they softened their tone
3044.28s: quite a bit we saw a lot of volume
3047.68s: coming out of Microsoft and flowing into
3050.48s: bonds and I think that that really
3052.52s: highlights your exact point that a lot
3054.52s: of people for a long time we're looking
3056.24s: at this and saying well I'm not going to
3058.64s: put it in bonds that's not doing
3060.08s: anything so I might as well just put it
3061.72s: in Tech big Tech specifically like
3064.56s: Microsoft yeah and hope for the
3067.20s: best you're basically hoping for the
3069.60s: best and it's like you don't know what
3071.76s: else to do with it and you can't just
3074.00s: leave it sitting there in a money market
3075.88s: fund or something so I mean you're
3078.04s: losing to inflation doing that lately
3081.88s: so yeah might as well take a shot got
3084.52s: nothing to lose that's kind of the
3086.52s: attitude a lot of people have speaking
3089.32s: of taking a shot for the last couple
3091.72s: questions I want to Pivot us now to 2024
3095.44s: in the way that you know you're thinking
3097.68s: about the year ahead obviously neither
3100.44s: you or I are kind of the the predictive
3102.92s: type I don't really try to do that
3104.52s: myself because I always think it's more
3106.32s: of an ego exercise than anything else
3109.16s: but I'm really curious how you are
3112.88s: positioning for the start of the year
3114.56s: you already talked about the way that
3116.92s: you feel we're kind of at a toppy level
3120.32s: here and markets are getting maybe a
3121.88s: little bit jittery but what do you
3123.44s: thinking about 2024 are there any major
3126.48s: themes that you're curious and seeing
3128.48s: how it plays out pretty much the same
3131.00s: themes I always do um I'm I'm always
3134.12s: looking to try to play the upside of the
3138.08s: uh exchange traded fund markets I've got
3140.56s: 30 out of 30 long stops behind every one
3144.04s: of them moving them up every day as I
3146.76s: can uh I've got the Hedge ready to go
3149.60s: and it's a lot closer than it used to be
3152.04s: uh the indicators I keep trying to move
3154.32s: it up every day so this hedge trade that
3157.56s: I took off and allowed the sectors to
3161.56s: run has turned out it to be a very
3164.32s: profitable Buy Signal uh obviously and
3168.20s: but sooner or later there'll be a sell
3169.92s: signal and I'll put the hedges back on
3172.84s: right now I'm just trying to keep moving
3174.52s: the stops up every day on that hedge so
3176.48s: that I can get it on as soon as I can
3179.52s: justify so that'll be another theme I
3182.04s: think the other theme that I wonder
3184.48s: whether wouldn't be a something to
3186.96s: consider in my portfolio I'm seeing a
3189.20s: lot of this and things strange things
3190.80s: like aluminum and um I don't know some
3194.96s: of the softs and and so on when you get
3198.76s: economic
3200.72s: disruptions and you get some things like
3203.12s: inflation or you get supply or demand
3205.92s: interruptions by things like the Red Sea
3208.92s: be shutting down to shipping and you're
3211.28s: you're logistically disrupting commodity
3214.32s: flows around the world and energy flows
3216.36s: around the world you can create
3218.44s: situations where Futures and commodity
3220.80s: prices will move so I'm hopeful I've
3224.00s: added a tenth strategy just in the last
3227.60s: week uh in my IRA that's going to be a
3230.56s: short-term future strategy it's going to
3233.12s: be based on three-day indicator
3236.20s: so it's going to do a lot more trades
3238.04s: but I'm trying to build the automation
3240.40s: I'm going to try to support that with
3242.36s: automation so that I don't have to do
3244.12s: too much work and it's going to trade
3247.00s: about 21 markets I think I figured out
3250.68s: and what I'm hoping happens is that if
3254.44s: we get and that's a big if I don't know
3256.68s: if the stock market's going to keep
3257.96s: rolling or not but if it turns over and
3260.32s: it heads to the
3261.64s: downside
3263.72s: then my I would say my sector ETF
3267.36s: programs are going to be sitting in cash
3269.00s: a lot and I'll be hedged on the part
3271.52s: that is still
3272.60s: long and uh generally speaking in a down
3276.60s: Market that strategy is going to be
3278.08s: swimming
3279.28s: Upstream have a tough time but I'm
3282.60s: hopeful that uh some of
3285.20s: the some of the economic disruption
3288.04s: could affect things like energy markets
3289.92s: and uh say the bond market maybe and
3292.80s: stuff like that and and I can exploit
3294.88s: that to try to produce profits there to
3297.68s: offset the struggling over in the sector
3300.92s: timing so that's kind of my theme early
3303.60s: on here is to kind of be very alert and
3306.36s: prepared to go the other way if this
3309.00s: thing runs its course and decides to
3311.32s: turn and if it doesn't to enjoy the ride
3314.00s: to the
3315.04s: upside that's pretty much the way I'm
3317.60s: going one other question I had for you
3320.48s: is this year when we saw some of the
3322.80s: weakness in the broad market like the
3324.48s: S&P 5 00 something like the cu's in Tech
3328.28s: just kept plugging away and when I see
3331.84s: how heavily anticipated the integration
3334.04s: of AI is and I I am a believer that it's
3338.00s: the kind of thing that is a massive
3340.40s: unlock for tons of things but it's
3344.24s: obviously very early and we still don't
3345.96s: really know how it's going to be
3346.84s: integrated and regulated da but I'm
3349.48s: curious if you think going into 2024 if
3353.88s: you start to see some of that weakness
3355.72s: that you're thinking of would that lead
3358.32s: you then to essentially rotate over
3361.08s: short equities r large or do you still
3363.56s: hold bastions that might still be
3366.04s: performing well like Tech that could be
3367.88s: fueled by AI on my NASDAQ trading I
3371.04s: would just go short that's I go long or
3373.40s: short all the time
3375.56s: so if it goes over to the downside and I
3378.96s: run that on a nday
3380.72s: indicator um it'll go short pretty
3384.52s: quickly and if the thing falls apart and
3386.56s: gets really ugly I will just coin money
3390.40s: uh with that
3391.68s: strategy in cryptos uh if the NASDAQ
3396.56s: type companies the tech companies start
3398.64s: going to the downside it seems like
3401.12s: overtime cryptos and Tech have been
3403.60s: related to each other except recently so
3406.88s: it's been interesting uh there's been
3409.08s: some different things happening in the
3412.40s: crypto world that I think have broken it
3414.96s: apart from just straight whatever the
3416.84s: techs are doing uh but we'll see maybe
3420.16s: it goes back to doing the same thing as
3422.36s: Tech and goes down too if it goes down
3424.72s: I'll short crypto
3426.48s: Futures no big deal there either uh
3430.36s: Hedges
3432.04s: beond I'd reduce my exposure in the long
3435.92s: u ETFs so that now is getting more and
3439.72s: more money market funds and then on the
3442.32s: rest of it I just try to be looking for
3445.68s: disruption in energy markets or
3447.52s: disruption in the cocoa markets or the
3449.52s: coffee markets or whatever soybeans corn
3453.12s: whatever there's lots of opportunities
3455.48s: out there you just got to look for them
3457.24s: and and get your indicator set up and
3459.72s: peel off a portion of your money to that
3462.08s: particular strategy so that's kind of
3463.76s: the way I think I try to protect myself
3466.84s: and try to look for profit opportunity
3468.68s: because I ideally speaking I'd like to
3470.60s: make money every month trading uh never
3473.76s: done that uh for a very very long period
3477.56s: of time there's always draw Downs that
3479.36s: I've had to live through and I've lived
3481.36s: through a lot of them uh but the I think
3486.24s: the goal is to try to keep squeezing
3488.36s: those draw Downs down in both magnitude
3492.04s: and in length of draw down length of
3494.32s: time in the draw down and I'm closer to
3497.16s: it today than I I was 20 30 years ago
3500.16s: for sure so I think I've done some
3503.32s: things in the right direction and I
3504.88s: think that allows me to approach a year
3507.48s: like 2024 and realize that hey things
3509.88s: could get really we could have more of
3511.96s: the same and uh break open the champagne
3515.00s: or this thing could fall apart right
3517.56s: after the New Year's Eve uh celebrations
3520.40s: are over and they're cleaning up and all
3522.52s: of a sudden We're Off to the Races to
3524.40s: the downside who knows and like like you
3528.00s: said earlier you don't predict you just
3530.16s: react and the key is to be prepared to
3532.92s: react if you're if you're sitting there
3535.64s: saying I'm loving this up market and you
3538.92s: decide to just leave your portfolio in
3541.04s: place and go take a two we vacation uh
3544.32s: to the Bahamas or something and enjoy
3546.76s: some of your uh the rewards that you've
3549.64s: made on your portfolio and you leave
3552.24s: your portfolio exposed and it decides to
3555.12s: go the other way it could happen so
3556.80s: quickly that by the time you get back
3558.76s: you might have a lot smaller
3561.36s: portfolio um you just got to you got to
3564.32s: put the things in place and you got to
3565.92s: run them and you got to be prepared to
3568.52s: pull the trigger you can't hesitate when
3572.28s: uh when the target is in your sights
3575.12s: pull the
3576.36s: trigger that resonates pretty well one
3580.48s: last question for you does an election
3583.80s: year factor in differently when you're
3586.72s: thinking about the year because that is
3588.20s: one thing I I consider quite a bit
3589.84s: especially the way that we're
3591.08s: positioning how the economy is doing and
3593.56s: how inflation is doing
3595.32s: I don't like being too tinh Hatty
3597.40s: thinking you know that there's a lot of
3599.00s: subversion going on but I do think of it
3601.36s: as there's probably a bit of window
3602.80s: dressing happening right now how do you
3605.60s: think about an election year yeah an
3607.72s: election
3608.76s: year you know to me it's all about say
3612.32s: news items and world events and all that
3615.28s: and an election year carries with it by
3618.76s: the very nature of it some news events
3622.44s: that could potentially affect Market
3624.60s: markets especially if the markets were
3627.72s: extremely overextended to the upside and
3630.12s: looking for an excuse to sell off all
3632.68s: that would require you know is something
3634.88s: that like a an
3637.76s: anti- economic growth candidate uh
3642.28s: coming up in the polls or something or
3644.92s: winning the election or something like
3647.04s: that and everybody panics it's just
3649.00s: becomes a catalyst for movement it may
3651.92s: not really when you think about it and
3654.52s: figure it all out really mean that much
3657.32s: to the economy but it becomes the
3659.88s: trigger it becomes just the Catalyst for
3662.48s: movement and once the movement starts
3664.84s: the trend takes over Panic or Euphoria
3667.92s: sets in and the markets are good at
3670.36s: perpetuating those things the Wall
3672.12s: Street journals of the world the daily
3676.00s: U uh what do you call it the investors
3680.12s: Daily Business Daily IBD yeah um all of
3684.72s: those types of Publications including
3687.16s: all the the cnbc's the Fox Business all
3690.60s: those they're all going to be catering
3693.24s: to whatever Direction the Market's going
3695.24s: if everybody is
3697.20s: depressed and the market makes new lows
3699.60s: every day then you're going to hear a
3700.80s: lot of stories about how rough things
3702.64s: are and the economy is still looking bad
3705.96s: and the fed's trying to prop it up and
3708.28s: doing this but so far it isn't working
3710.56s: and you're going to have very negative
3712.56s: attitudes and the trend down tends to
3715.36s: per perpetuate itself but the same is
3717.76s: true to the upside if if the Market's
3720.44s: making new highs then it's a bunch of
3722.72s: smiley faces and giggling and
3725.64s: everybody's happy and they're you know
3728.20s: every stock they're going over the
3729.76s: stocks that gapped open five and 10%
3732.40s: that morning and it's a different type
3735.04s: of mood that you're watching and I think
3737.08s: what that those Publications are just
3739.48s: feeding the
3741.32s: viewership what they want to hear and so
3744.68s: that's how Trends tend to perpetuate
3746.68s: themselves and I think election
3749.20s: years tend to provide some Catalyst for
3752.68s: movement so uh yeah you never know um
3756.60s: could
3757.68s: easily there's you know there's all
3760.04s: sorts the conspiracy that the FED tries
3763.36s: to keep interest rates low during an
3766.44s: election I I don't know I that just
3769.20s: might be the timing of the
3770.92s: economy um I don't know
3773.36s: if they can actually uh more accurately
3776.92s: do that and pull it off uh I think you
3780.68s: can
3781.68s: obviously they kept the interest rates
3784.00s: too low too long I think uh during covid
3786.96s: and after covid and now I'm worried that
3789.76s: they're going to do the opposite they're
3791.24s: going to keep it interest rates a little
3793.28s: too high for too long and we're going to
3795.16s: end up slipping into some sort of a a
3798.92s: maybe a a medium to hard landing and if
3802.36s: we get a bad economy going and and we're
3804.64s: at War at the same time that could get I
3807.44s: don't know kind of ugly I think out
3809.12s: there in the world so I uh I hate to be
3812.16s: a pessimist but I like to be
3814.32s: prepared I think it's the best way to
3816.48s: behave as a Trader and obviously you've
3818.64s: uh been at it for a while so it's been
3820.44s: working for you being being prepared but
3823.52s: um Tom I'm stoked to have connected with
3826.36s: you I love kind of distilling down some
3828.84s: of the information that you have and
3830.92s: drawing on your experience it's one of
3832.64s: the most beautiful things of doing this
3834.00s: so thank you so much for taking some
3835.68s: time to hang out with us I have links to
3839.32s: your Twitter page or X page whatever
3841.60s: you're supposed to call it now your
3842.84s: website both of those will be in the
3844.64s: show notes below but is there anywhere
3846.40s: else that you want people to get a hold
3847.84s: of you at no those would be Twitter's
3850.36s: the probably the the most uh
3854.56s: frequently found place i' I'd say I'm
3857.40s: most active there because I've got
3860.88s: 52,000 plus followers and so I'm
3863.56s: unavoidable I get a lot of comments and
3865.60s: a lot of if I post something I'm going
3867.88s: to get like I just wished everybody a
3870.44s: Happy New Year I think I got like 100
3872.48s: people commenting or uh reacting to it
3876.56s: um so that's probably where the action
3878.76s: is Facebook a lot less and Facebook is
3881.72s: starting to kind of perturb me a little
3884.40s: bit with all the Impostors we have a
3886.24s: known impostor that is actually
3889.68s: contacting people on crypto scams
3892.84s: Facebook doesn't seem to be able to uh
3896.36s: get rid of the guy just really kind of I
3900.36s: don't know pissing me off uh LinkedIn is
3903.80s: is pretty solid but is a little bit more
3905.76s: business oriented I'd say so I do have
3908.92s: followers there I've got probably a
3910.44s: thousand or 2,000 people there but
3912.12s: certainly isn't the size of Twitter so
3914.60s: that's the easy way and in Twitter I am
3916.88s: at boso BS
3919.68s: o uncore t m Tom no other spelling is
3926.72s: allowed it would be an
3929.00s: impostor and be careful out there I
3931.64s: don't sell you anything on Direct
3933.60s: messaging so if somebody's trying to
3935.36s: sell you something it's not
3938.36s: me well beautiful yeah I'll make sure I
3941.08s: get the right links in there so
3942.12s: everybody can find you but uh yeah Tom
3944.64s: absolute pleasure hanging out thanks for
3946.20s: chatting with us well and have a great
3948.52s: uh 2024 and uh hopefully a great Happy
3952.28s: New Year's Eve thank you sir I'm sure
