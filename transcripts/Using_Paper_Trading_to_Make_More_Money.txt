0.20s: what's up outliers today I want to talk
2.20s: to you about one of the most pivotal
5.00s: Tools in my trading career I started
7.56s: trading 2007 and I really wish I used
10.36s: this more early on but I had these ideas
12.48s: that I was going to trade make a bunch
14.08s: of money super fast super easy and
16.00s: shocker it didn't quite go that way so
18.40s: what I want to talk to you about today
20.32s: is one of the best tools you have at
23.12s: your disposal yet nobody really uses it
26.32s: and it's not sexy it's not cool but it's
29.28s: effective it's paper trading I want to
31.32s: walk you through a bunch of the
32.96s: misconceptions I hear about it I want to
34.76s: walk you through how I think it might
37.28s: make sense for people to think about it
39.00s: and then I want to walk you through how
40.76s: you can make it worth your while whether
43.96s: you are a brand new Trader or you're an
46.72s: experienced Trader there's still a use
48.92s: case for it and I want to make the
51.32s: argument on what that looks like so
53.80s: let's get right in what I hate hearing
56.48s: are these kinds of things it's fake
58.60s: money it's too time consuming I don't
61.16s: think it's worth the time we have this
63.64s: person that you know made a comment on
65.32s: my video that says you know I I don't
67.52s: find it that useful cuz I take huge
69.24s: positions just see how they work out cuz
70.96s: I don't care if they lose so can't take
73.16s: it seriously so here's the way I would
76.36s: try to frame it for somebody the first
78.80s: question I have is do you think making
80.68s: money trading is easy like do you think
82.92s: it's an easy task to make money and if
86.16s: you do I would encourage you hop over to
88.60s: my website go to Res sources go down
90.84s: here to this thing called do Traders
92.40s: make money and take a look at some of
94.28s: these studies that I have because I can
96.40s: quantifiably tell you it's not easy
98.44s: money because the overwhelming majority
100.88s: of traders that start trading do not
103.48s: continue beyond the 5-year Mark we can
105.36s: see all these issues that Traders have
108.40s: trading so I would argue then that it's
112.60s: it's not easy so then if it's not easy
115.88s: why do we take the approach that we all
117.72s: do and it's because this this is a solo
120.92s: Endeavor and nobody's forcing you to do
122.92s: the right things so if you think about a
125.32s: skill or a sport that you have a big
128.60s: skill set in something that you've
129.84s: developed over years you probably
131.64s: attained it through going through
133.24s: prolonged periods of working on and
135.64s: isolating small pieces of it in lower
138.04s: risk environments so if you play a sport
140.56s: that's through scrimmages that's through
142.44s: practice with your team if you think of
143.96s: something like playing guitar and you do
145.76s: it as a hobby you just do it for fun
147.40s: well you still take a lot of time to
149.40s: learn how to do it but there's no risk
151.60s: involved if you're terrible at it and
153.12s: you're just playing it in your house
154.96s: nobody cares so trading is a bit
158.32s: different there's risk involved
160.16s: literally your livelihood because as we
163.24s: know money cannot buy you happiness but
166.24s: what I like to remind people is poverty
168.76s: can't buy you anything and if you have
171.72s: money and you're already a happy person
174.04s: with money you're even happier you get
175.84s: to do all the things you like to do you
177.40s: don't have to worry about doing
179.04s: everything your boss asks you to do
181.28s: because you have something else you can
183.04s: rely on so you gain literally personal
186.44s: autonomy by being financially secure so
190.20s: taking this all the way back to trading
192.04s: there's risk involved if you take a
194.32s: shitty approach a lazy approach a
196.64s: laxidasical approach to trading you will
199.36s: probably end up in this bucket the group
201.20s: of people who start lose money and then
203.52s: stop that's probably what's going to
204.88s: happen more likely than not so paper
207.48s: trading is a really effect Ive tool that
211.16s: you have that allows you to do a few
213.12s: things now for context I kind of bucket
216.64s: back testing paper trading forward
218.88s: testing or paper trading is kind of
220.48s: synonymous with live testing in this
222.08s: case into one General bucket of testing
225.52s: now back testing is really efficient
228.32s: because we can take a really big broad
230.68s: bucket of information and see kind of
232.72s: what works what doesn't work and what I
234.52s: remind people is that if you have a back
236.44s: test that looks good it's not super
238.64s: indicative of what will look like in the
240.64s: future necessarily but if you have a
242.76s: back test that looks bad you can't make
244.64s: it look good then it's probably not a
245.92s: good idea cuz the probability of that
247.48s: magically turning into a good idea is
249.12s: not super high forward testing is just
251.00s: the process of simulating things Monte
253.44s: Carlo simulations whatever to project
255.28s: things out forward using uh surrogate or
258.04s: a synthetic data set and then paper
259.92s: trading is kind of synonymous in my
262.04s: world for live testing there's a lot of
264.56s: value in live testing because if I pull
267.16s: open this chart and I type in something
269.92s: like SPX and I want to you know test
274.12s: something over the Last 5 Years well I
276.64s: can see what happens I know it happens
279.36s: I've I've seen it so even down to a
282.00s: subconscious level I have a lot of small
284.56s: cues in my brain that really detract
287.80s: from the true legitimacy of a test live
291.16s: testing is just that it's putting on
293.68s: trades paper trades and we'll talk about
295.92s: some ways to make it really effective
298.16s: and I don't know what's going to happen
299.84s: tomorrow I don't know I have no
301.60s: historical reference I have nothing that
304.04s: convolutes my subconscious processing so
306.80s: it's the purest expression of an idea
310.36s: because I don't know what's going to
311.84s: happen there's nothing in my brain that
313.44s: tells me what's going to happen tomorrow
314.72s: so paper trading in my opinion is kind
316.84s: of like the last step of this process I
319.80s: start with back testing then I may or
322.64s: may not forward test that often is part
325.12s: of what I do and then paper trading is
327.48s: when I get really specific and I want
329.92s: test specific ideas and I want to do it
333.20s: in a pure environment that I have no
335.84s: context about what's going to happen
337.76s: because paper trading is timec consuming
339.48s: as compared to the others so there's two
342.04s: broad ways that I think about paper
344.16s: trading we have kind of like the
345.76s: beginner level of paper trading which is
348.52s: I'm brand new to the markets I don't
350.20s: know what I'm doing and I'm trying to
352.04s: figure things out for me if you're in
353.96s: that bucket brand new I would look to
356.32s: paper trade for at least 3 months before
359.64s: committing real capital and probably 6
361.80s: months would be like an ideal Target I
364.04s: tell people a year would be great but
366.48s: I'll be honest with you I know myself
367.92s: included I wouldn't paper trade for a
369.36s: full year I would feel like I'm wasting
370.72s: too much time even though you're not
372.08s: that's what I would feel so I think 3
374.24s: months is a minimum Fair Target for new
376.72s: traders to paper trade in this learning
379.28s: phase down here we're really just trying
381.40s: to weed out mistakes we're trying to
384.24s: weed out the instances where if I'm
386.40s: trading something like what you just saw
388.72s: up nkl
390.32s: and it's somewhere back here and I'm
392.00s: like oh wow the V is so high I want to
394.44s: trade strangles and I am not experienced
397.68s: enough to check to see why it's so high
399.84s: and it has earnings coming up and I
401.40s: don't know that and I don't know that I
402.88s: don't know that the only way I'm going
404.08s: to know that is by experiencing it and
405.96s: paper trading is a great way to go
407.60s: through that experience without losing a
409.28s: bunch of money on a really dumb mistake
411.64s: like that paper trading is also really
413.64s: effective for developing a trade
415.60s: checklist if I were to paper trade that
418.00s: would be to learn that would be my
419.96s: primary desired output from paper
422.68s: trading is a solid trading checklist and
426.36s: a solid trading plan and log template
430.28s: those would be my three objectives at
432.04s: the end of my paper trading time I want
434.48s: to have those three items and for the
436.68s: outlier Pro members you can download
438.68s: examples for those in the patreon shop
440.64s: and then for those that aren't on there
442.12s: I have videos that walk through them
444.08s: that you can create your own as well but
445.88s: that would be my target for paper
447.88s: trading to learn and then we have paper
449.52s: paper trading to sharpen the sword so
452.32s: right now I've been trading 17 years and
455.00s: I literally I was just counting I have
456.48s: over 2,000 paper trades on right now
459.00s: it's like 2,100 and change so why do I
461.32s: do that well it's because of this next
464.00s: bucket of things that we're going to
466.04s: talk about but the high level of it is
468.68s: it lets me test a lot of things in a
471.32s: pure environment I don't know what's
472.60s: going to happen so it lets me collect a
475.16s: really big data set of information that
478.08s: I can then use later and I'll show you
480.84s: how to do that so let's start here with
483.64s: how to make it worth your while Define
485.24s: your goals is about as simple as it gets
487.04s: but the objective behind this is as
489.00s: you're paper trading whether it's to
490.92s: learn or to sharpen we want to have
493.24s: clear objectives in mind so if it's to
495.56s: learn those are my objectives those
497.36s: three things I told you if it's to
498.88s: sharpen then I need to Define what I'm
501.52s: sharpening am I trying to make sure that
503.00s: I have really good control over my
504.88s: portfolio am I trying to make sure that
507.04s: the trades behave the way I think
508.80s: they're going to behave I would Define
510.32s: it it's super helpful after that track
513.08s: your work so going back to the example I
515.44s: was telling you about creating a data
516.92s: set well this is kind of just a a really
519.92s: quick example data set but you can
522.32s: create your own version of a trade log
524.92s: so here we have some highlevel portfolio
528.04s: information here I always include just
530.16s: some general calculators and stuff that
531.92s: I like to use this is actually P pieces
534.76s: from my version in Excel so none of
537.16s: these links or none of these formulas in
539.08s: here work they're you know all broken so
541.12s: I just dropped it in Google Sheets for
542.40s: you but this is kind of the general
543.96s: format that I use is I have a summary
546.52s: tab called C2C in the military that
548.28s: stands for command and control and this
549.60s: is where I have all the high Lev
550.88s: summation of information then I have
553.36s: specific tabs for specific strategies in
555.76s: this case I'm looking at uh this isn't a
557.76s: real trade it's just an example of a
559.28s: ratio called diagonal and crowd strike
561.00s: so in here I have the template for this
563.28s: specific strategy that I built out over
565.64s: time for a ratio called diagonal it's
567.56s: right here so in the process of paper
569.44s: trading either to learn or to sharpen
571.96s: you'll kind of walk through what Details
574.00s: Matter in these kind of sheets for you
575.40s: and what don't then if you own the data
578.32s: meaning I'm paper trading a bunch of
580.08s: different versions cuz I'm tracking well
581.88s: then I can create other tabs that let me
584.40s: analyze the performance of a specific
587.36s: strategy so in this case what I would do
588.92s: in the rcd analysis tab is I would
591.44s: essentially pull all of the details from
593.76s: every individual ratio called diagonal
596.24s: trade that I have into this tab and then
598.60s: learn see it performs now there's ways
600.88s: to automate all of this stuff all of
602.80s: this tracking can be automated but I
604.88s: personally think the process of manually
607.44s: inputting this data and manually
609.04s: manipulating it is super important so
611.36s: that's just my preference other people
612.76s: prefer to automate it and that's cool
614.12s: too if that works better for you I'm
615.52s: just explaining what tends to work well
617.24s: for me which is this so if you track
618.88s: your work if you're learning you'll have
620.68s: a chance to start building out a data
622.12s: set and if you're experienced you can
623.96s: amplify an entire data set so for
626.00s: example with the zero DTE I recently put
628.36s: out a video where I'm looking at
630.00s: different time frames for entries well I
632.56s: back test it but then on a daily basis
634.64s: as I'm trading Zer D to espx options I'm
637.00s: also putting on paper traits and all
638.68s: these other variations to see what time
640.80s: frames work well what Deltas work well
643.04s: again in a data set that I don't know
645.04s: how it's going to perform because then I
646.72s: can always go back and then analyze it
649.28s: myself with my own data because one of
652.08s: the problem is if you don't track your
654.04s: own work and let's say you come in here
655.84s: into thinker swim you go into on demand
658.28s: so like now this puts back in time the
660.40s: cool part about this is that you can
662.00s: really efficiently test ideas so if I
664.04s: wanted to go back in time let's go back
665.96s: to July of 20123 and I can fast forward
669.76s: or in this case reverse time back to
671.84s: there which is really cool but one of
673.68s: the downsides if I'm testing a ratio
675.88s: called diagonal or other option
677.48s: strategies and then I let's say I go to
680.32s: the monitor tab which is where your
681.60s: positions are and let's say I I run out
683.36s: of money or I have old options that I
685.52s: need to get rid of and I hit reset it's
687.76s: all gone as soon as I hit reset it's all
691.00s: gone all of that information is gone and
693.52s: it's completely dependent upon your
695.64s: memory which nobody's memory is that
698.40s: good to be able to get all of the
699.96s: relevant details from something like
701.68s: this purely off of memory so by tracking
705.12s: your work you give yourself a data set
707.28s: this also gives you a chance to work out
709.40s: all of those bad behaviors so those kind
711.36s: of things I showed you in the beginning
712.68s: of the video where it's like well I
713.80s: can't take it seriously well that's user
715.72s: error that's operator error that tells
717.60s: me that there's a problem with the way
719.28s: you think about trading because I
720.92s: personally think about this as the way
723.20s: for me to practice creating wealth and
726.20s: freedom for myself I can take that
728.08s: pretty seriously at this point in my
729.44s: life and because I started taking this
731.84s: more seriously a few years into my
733.64s: trading admittedly in the beginning I
735.04s: didn't like most other people I really
736.72s: thought I was going to make a bunch of
737.68s: money super easy super fast it's just
739.24s: not how this thing works so as I started
741.44s: taking it more seriously I realized that
743.56s: I could quantitatively analyze what I'm
745.56s: doing and I can set up different
747.20s: portfolios that allow me to meet miror
749.64s: my portfolio so I always split what I
752.60s: was doing I would have the portfolio
755.68s: paper trade where I'm literally trying
757.60s: to trade the portfolio is exactly as I
759.84s: think I should and then I have the data
761.92s: paper trades where I'm just collecting
763.52s: information so if I'm selling a 30 Delta
765.72s: put maybe I'll sell uh 25 Delta 20 Delta
768.72s: 15 Delta 10 Delta right so I'm just
770.64s: using that other part to collect data
772.32s: but if you're efficient about it you can
774.76s: collect a lot of information pretty
776.80s: effectively so what this means is let's
778.80s: say for example I'm practicing my
780.80s: directional strategies I want to
782.84s: practice if I can pick something going
785.20s: up right so if I'm directionally correct
788.44s: and whatever stock XYZ goes up I make
791.08s: money well you make money if you sell a
792.96s: put or buy a call but the way you make
794.72s: money is slightly different so I can
796.44s: test them both I can say okay the profit
798.72s: mechanism I'm looking to test right now
800.48s: is a directional thesis these are the
802.28s: indicators I'm using you can learn and
804.16s: track how efficacious they are I do and
806.48s: then because it's not just how good the
808.24s: indicators are in a vacuum if you back
810.32s: test them you also need to test your
812.04s: ability to interpret them which again a
814.24s: back test will never capture so live
816.16s: testing is a great way to test your
818.84s: ability to synthesize profit mechanisms
821.20s: to make money as a Trader whether it's
822.60s: directional hypothesis volatility
824.60s: hypothesis so on and so forth so in this
826.60s: case if it goes up whether I did either
828.84s: of those option strategies doesn't
830.28s: change but the quality of the movement
832.24s: and the way it moves in the path and the
834.12s: way that the trades behave is very
835.44s: different so I can just put them both on
837.40s: at once so this is the multitasking
840.12s: concept by paper trading multiple
842.28s: variations you get to learn much faster
844.84s: then this big to small component goes
847.60s: back to what I was talking about in
848.92s: terms of back testing forward testing if
851.00s: you're so inclined and then paper
852.84s: trading live testing so that you can
855.12s: have a comprehensive approach that
857.00s: you're not wasting a bunch of time
858.52s: trying to paper trate everything cuz it
860.04s: takes time even in something like on
861.76s: demand where I can fast forward time and
864.72s: I can change it I can pick this calendar
866.88s: and go where I want I still have to
868.40s: click the button and that's still timec
870.20s: consuming so I want to do that after
872.04s: I've gotten some repetitions in seeing
874.20s: and ironing out the broad ideas then
876.88s: seeing how it would perform then
878.56s: applying my ability to synthesize
881.56s: information and how I come up with my
884.44s: ideas live that's the idea here so paper
887.56s: trading is really slept on it's
889.60s: dismissed and I want to be really clear
891.56s: it will never ever replace live money it
895.20s: will never do that it will never fully
896.92s: simulate it and that's why I think it's
898.72s: important important to paper trade but
900.44s: then it's important to get those Kinks
902.08s: out of the way for a new Trader and then
903.60s: pivot to safely starting to trade with
906.32s: live money making sure that you have all
908.04s: these other stupid details ironed out so
910.32s: that you can learn with real money but
911.96s: just because it's not real money doesn't
914.24s: mean it's not worth your time I just
915.68s: gave you two great ways to use it
