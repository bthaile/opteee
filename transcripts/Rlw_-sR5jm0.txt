0.00s:  Hey everybody, Eric here with the super riveting topic of tax section 1256, which is also
7.56s:  known as kind of a 6040 tax treatment.
10.88s:  So what actually inspired me to do this video now, it's been on my to do list like literally
15.80s:  for months is I saw somebody posting on one of my posts on Reddit that essentially,
21.24s:  you know, that they're making quote unquote six figures on long term call options in the
26.72s:  spy, which you know, if it's true, good for them.
30.16s:  But I was really surprised to hear that just because that is just grossly inefficient.
35.32s:  One, in order to generate that capital from long term options, you would need to be trading
41.52s:  multiples of contracts on long dated options, which tend to be less liquid.
46.08s:  And then more over than all of that, they're missing this entire possibility, which is super
51.84s:  important, especially for, you know, folks with larger accounts, this starts to matter a
56.12s:  lot.
57.12s:  So not necessarily the funnest conversation on planet earth, but I'm going to do my best
61.08s:  to get through it quickly.
62.84s:  And efficiently so that everybody can move on with their lives and not worry about taxes
67.24s:  quite as much, but nonetheless, super freaking important.
70.12s:  So let us take a look.
72.36s:  So section 1256, there's actually a form from 2020.
78.12s:  It's formed 6781 from the IRS's web page.
82.40s:  I'm going to link to that in the description so that if you want to check it out,
86.00s:  essentially, it's the form that you would fill out with the 1256 information.
90.32s:  But if you scroll to the bottom, it has this section right here.
94.04s:  And it tells you exactly where to go to understand what they consider a section 1256 contract.
99.84s:  The punchline is there are certain products that are classified differently than other
105.16s:  products.
106.16s:  So options, securities, bonds, all of those different products have certain classifications
112.68s:  and a handful of those kind of roll up underneath the section 1256 contracts.
119.20s:  So what is the 6040 tax treatment?
124.96s:  Well, I'll tell you what it is.
127.24s:  It's this right here.
128.92s:  So essentially, 60% of that trade will be taxed at your brackets long term capital gains
138.24s:  tax.
139.56s:  And then 40% is going to be at the ordinary rate, whatever that is.
144.80s:  And this should be 37, not 27.
150.24s:  So that's just a little error.
152.28s:  Let's just real quick come in here and go, 37.
159.64s:  As if it was like that the whole time, except now, you know, it kind of like lines up here.
165.24s:  That's compared to everything else, which is just like really nice straight across, really
169.88s:  clean that up.
170.88s:  I bet.
173.20s:  But joking aside, there's really a pretty significant benefit to this.
177.72s:  So for those of us that trade shorter time frames, normally you are taxed at whatever
183.52s:  your ordinary rate is, whatever your tax bracket is.
186.56s:  So as you can see, I pulled the top three.
189.36s:  And this is whatever your ordinary tax rate would be.
192.44s:  So the top three tax brackets in 2020, 32, 35, 37.
196.28s:  There's obviously more tax brackets than that, but not to say they don't matter, but
200.80s:  for this conversation, they are slightly less pertinent.
204.76s:  And then this column right here, I can clear that out.
209.84s:  So it's easy.
212.92s:  Oops, made a mistake.
215.16s:  It should be this.
216.16s:  There we go.
217.16s:  So this is the long term capital gains brackets.
219.80s:  So this means essentially up until the 37% tax bracket, you're going to get charged
225.60s:  at a 15% long term capital gains tax for products that you hold over a year.
231.40s:  And if you're in this 37% bracket, it's 20%.
234.72s:  So what happens with these 60, 40 tax treatment is kind of magical for the higher tax brackets.
243.12s:  You can see that at this 37% tax rate, it gets reduced essentially to a 27% tax rate.
253.40s:  So that's only for section 1256 contracts.
257.00s:  So again, for the person that I read the post on Reddit, this would be massive for them.
262.76s:  Because essentially they have the chance to lower their tax rate around 10%.
267.52s:  That's a big deal, especially for bigger contracts.
270.76s:  That's why I was surprised to see if they're trading that size in the spy and they're only
275.62s:  trading long calls.
276.94s:  To me, it would be mindless not to trade something like this.
281.28s:  Really be an additional reason on top of the tax treatment is just the leverage of the product.
287.88s:  The spy is a tenth the size of the SPX.
290.28s:  So you have to trade 10 times the number of contracts equal one contract size on the
295.08s:  other.
296.08s:  So then you just run into the efficiency issues of getting a bit asked spread for 10 separate
298.88s:  lots.
299.88s:  So if you move to something like the SPX, you can essentially trade the same exact product
307.08s:  with less contracts, same size, and also receive preferential tax treatment.
312.52s:  Seems like a pretty straightforward answer to me.
314.72s:  So what are the products we can trade now this down here publication 550 and section
322.44s:  1256G to give you a list of what you can trade.
325.96s:  This is not a comprehensive list.
327.60s:  This is just what I imagine is applicable to most people.
330.60s:  So futures options on futures, those receive 6040 tax treatment.
335.96s:  It's mostly because a lot of them are are broad based commodities or indices as is.
343.12s:  Then this next section is kind of a really important differentiation.
346.56s:  Broad based index as compared to securities.
350.04s:  This is a really confusing point for a lot of people.
353.36s:  Broad based indices are things like the SPX, the NDX.
358.20s:  So the larger bigger brother of the smaller ETFs notice how ETFs is considered a security.
367.24s:  They are not part of this 1256 contract tax treatment bucket.
374.12s:  Really important to differentiate that because again, depending on what your strategy is,
378.32s:  a lot of people ask me why I trade so much I WM.
381.80s:  And the primary reason is because taking assignment and holding the underlying is a key part
389.56s:  of my strategy.
391.44s:  So these broad based indices are cash settled.
395.96s:  They don't have an underlying to them for any sort of position that I'm trading at size
402.88s:  that I'm not expecting to take assignment.
405.44s:  You would better believe I'm trading the bigger brother indices so that I can enjoy the
411.08s:  6040 tax treatment.
412.84s:  But the only reason why I spend so much time in I WM is because being able to take shares
417.64s:  in is an important part of the primary strategies that I employ.
422.92s:  So in summary, 6040 tax treatment is super dope for people that are in higher ordinary tax
431.32s:  brackets that are trading less than trading within a year.
436.24s:  So you're exposed to that ordinary tax rate for your trades.
440.84s:  It only applies to 1256 contract products, which this is a small list here, not comprehensive,
449.20s:  but this is the general bucket.
451.40s:  So 4X, not on here, things like that, securities, not on here.
456.12s:  If this is for most traders, the products that you're going to have to move into if you
460.84s:  want to have this sort of tax advantage.
466.08s:  The downside, like I mentioned, for some of the broad based indices is there, there's
470.88s:  their cash settled.
472.44s:  So it can be difficult if your strategy relies on taking the underlying in at some point
477.52s:  might be difficult for you to deploy that.
479.48s:  So might not be right for some of your strategies, as is the case for me.
484.20s:  But for the strategies that you don't need to touch the underlying, this is way more
489.60s:  efficient than trying to size up in a smaller ETF and get killed on taxes.
495.44s:  So all in all, I hope this session was helpful.
498.52s:  I do have a couple bonus points to share for those interested.
503.48s:  You can find out a lot more about the 6040 tax stream in in the section 1256.
508.08s:  But really one other thing to keep in mind that's kind of nice is their market to market daily.
513.44s:  So what that means is PNL is essentially reported daily and then you're unrealized PNL
518.08s:  settled at your end.
519.76s:  Wash sales don't apply here.
522.28s:  So for people that kind of have to hold products until the end of the year to taxed harvest
526.12s:  on products that they will otherwise are trying to avoid wash sales, it's not really the case
530.76s:  for these kind of products.
532.28s:  So another fun fact.
533.36s:  There's some more good information on the IRS's website for those interested and really
538.60s:  diving into the detail.
539.88s:  But for a nine minute video, as much as I could pack in, is efficiently as possible.
545.40s:  So if you can trade these, highly recommend it.
549.20s:  It's good to know that they exist, but I wouldn't necessarily try to trade these if it's
554.00s:  not part of your strategy.
556.32s:  And you know, just for that tax treatment because you only get taxed on profits.
560.92s:  And if you switch to a bunch of crazy strategies just to try to trade these things and you
565.32s:  start losing money, the taxes don't fucking matter anyways, you're losing money.
568.52s:  So folks, I'm making money first.
570.44s:  If you can be efficient, obviously it's the way to go.
573.24s:  All right, I hope this was helpful and I will talk to you all later.
