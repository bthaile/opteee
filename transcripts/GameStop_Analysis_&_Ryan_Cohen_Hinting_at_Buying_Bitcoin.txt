0.72s: what's up outliers bit of a day out
2.60s: there time for your weekly GameStop
5.72s: update now there was not a GameStop
8.80s: stream this past weekend cuz your boy
10.56s: was getting over some food poisoning
12.72s: from those haters over at Chipotle but
15.24s: we're feeling better now and ready to
18.48s: get back caught up with everything
20.00s: that's going on and there was some
21.04s: interesting news that broke today from
22.92s: Ryan Cohen I think it broke yesterday
25.32s: we'll talk about that a little bit later
27.20s: but I thought that we would start with
28.88s: just analyzing where at now today with
30.80s: the company and how things look because
34.32s: the broad market right now is going
36.64s: through a bit of a contraction so some
39.12s: of the movement that we're seeing in
40.44s: GameStop recently is unique to GameStop
43.88s: meaning the company itself and the
47.36s: overall movement of shares for the
49.20s: company itself then also some of this is
51.92s: literally broader across the entire
53.72s: Market because if we take a look at
56.84s: let's say the S&P 500 for example you
59.28s: can see the P 500 is down four
61.80s: consecutive days it's shedding so this
64.96s: is actually the the broader market
67.40s: closing in not quite there yet but
70.08s: closing in on a correction it's about a
73.96s: third of the way there defining it as a
76.20s: 10% pullback from term highs so it's
81.00s: moving in that direction but I think it
82.88s: still has a way to go from the broader
85.16s: market so some of this overall weakness
88.52s: is absolutely going to bleed over into
91.08s: individual names like this now a couple
93.76s: things that did surprise me I fully
96.52s: expected and based on this value area I
98.96s: think we drew this two streams ago
101.08s: together so this is a couple weeks old
103.12s: now but you can see that there was a
104.88s: volume node hanging out here lots of
106.64s: transactions at this price level and I
109.72s: genuinely didn't expect this move that
112.60s: we saw yesterday I really would have
115.16s: expected us to hang out in this volume
117.32s: node a little bit longer the fact that
119.96s: we didn't do that and that it's assuming
123.20s: this broader downtrend and now it's
125.52s: posting near term new lows so it posted
130.64s: a low here and now this is a lower low
134.64s: than this low so what that means is the
138.08s: broader downtrend obviously is intact
141.16s: and it's continuing it's kind of big and
143.48s: ugly I identify with that uh mostly
146.72s: because in terms of Trends they're
148.40s: normally a little more organiz than this
150.80s: kind of like this this is a less ugly
153.08s: uptrend right it's very organized this
155.16s: is kind of all over the place there's
156.60s: some levels of consolidation built into
159.44s: it before resumption of a downtrend so
161.52s: the market is definitely kind of you
164.64s: know mixed different ways with where it
168.24s: views GameStop right now and when I look
171.28s: at the the company itself a lot of this
173.88s: near-term movement in my opinion is now
176.76s: fully being driven by sentiment this is
179.28s: being driven by short-term positioning
181.72s: and a lot of people managing risk taking
184.80s: risk off not just in terms of individual
188.00s: positions within GameStop but then also
189.72s: individual positions within things like
191.76s: xrt that feed into GameStop we're seeing
194.52s: outflows and movements into defensive
197.24s: names so until the market starts to
201.60s: consolidate and chill out which right
204.00s: now I'm still generally bullish on I
206.16s: think that the impact AI is going to
208.80s: have is literally big as anything else
210.84s: we've ever seen bigger potentially than
213.48s: the internet so with that level of
216.28s: impact and prosperity ahead of us still
218.36s: like there's one of the most powerful
219.80s: catalysts I can think of for growth and
222.16s: advancement now that doesn't mean that
223.40s: there can't be bare Market in between
225.64s: there absolutely can be because we're
227.12s: trying to thread a needle with things
229.28s: like inflation and now tariffs and stuff
232.24s: like that that make the overall picture
234.32s: really difficult to manage through so
238.24s: the idea that have longer term is still
242.00s: always betting on prosperity and
243.92s: development and growth of business but
245.96s: near term it can look a lot of different
247.44s: ways so I wanted to give you all of that
249.76s: context for the movements that you're
251.28s: seeing here because the way that I trade
253.44s: things like this personally will talk
255.32s: about the coverage strangle position I
257.32s: still have that on that's not gone
258.64s: anywhere and I will walk you through
261.16s: what it looks like as of today and right
264.92s: now it's just kind of like a sit and
266.48s: wait and hold um normally what I will do
269.96s: is unwind shares as it's going down and
273.80s: a big purpose for unwinding those shares
276.84s: is so that I am what we would call Value
279.76s: averaging taking them down at a profit
282.56s: and then unwinding them before they turn
284.88s: into a loss right so securing a profit
287.36s: and then being able to purchase more of
289.64s: the underlying now unfortunately I had
293.20s: done some of that already and the
296.28s: position is about as trim as I would
298.20s: want it to be given the way that
299.88s: GameStop moves so it's holding a loss
303.08s: right now and I'll I'll walk you through
304.72s: all of that now I do want to talk a
307.28s: little bit before we get into that just
309.72s: kind of like the current state of
312.12s: GameStop as far as we can see and if we
315.08s: take a look we can see that volatility
317.28s: is creeping back up a little bit so
319.72s: we're seeing over 100% Vol here we're
322.32s: seeing 101% V in the front part of that
325.44s: is going to be from the broader market
326.84s: movement part of that is going to be
328.96s: probably from earnings right now which
330.76s: are expected on 25 March after the close
334.04s: so we have some ideas on volatility
338.08s: moving around but definitely entering
340.08s: the equation a little bit more heavily
342.64s: we can see that there were a ton of
344.04s: calls traded today relative to puts
346.08s: 113,000 against 25 but most of those
350.16s: came in below the bid so sales probably
352.48s: people selling calls against shares it's
354.96s: kind of late to do that in my opinion
356.52s: when you're selling them now you're kind
357.60s: of selling the calls when they're real
358.76s: low and cheap which is isn't my
360.00s: preferred methodology but if you're late
362.08s: to the punch you're late to the punch
364.00s: the options chain is quiet a f I've not
369.04s: seen it this quiet in some time now so
371.20s: it's 557 th000 calls against 184,000
374.64s: puts nothing in here jumping out at me
377.36s: this is just very very quiet we're
379.52s: across all different expiration Cycles
382.24s: but one of the things that is noteworthy
384.12s: from the open interest distribution is
386.80s: there is some localization in the front
390.48s: expirations but most of it is actually
393.52s: out here in 17
396.00s: April that's interesting because it's
398.84s: not in the next primary expiration it's
402.04s: in the second primary expiration out in
405.60s: time which is slightly abnormal normally
408.20s: we see almost all of the open interest
410.44s: concentrated in the front individual
413.24s: cycle but then the second largest
415.20s: concentration typically is found in the
417.64s: next occurring primary expiration and
420.96s: then we sometimes see stuff way further
423.88s: out in time in the 16 genan 15 genan out
426.92s: in 27 like super far out so the fact
430.08s: that it's not here but here is actually
431.72s: kind of
433.04s: interesting so let's take a quick look
437.40s: at the overall trend so this is looking
440.36s: at a 30-day flow of premium for puts and
444.96s: calls separately and I want you to take
447.72s: a note as to how this this is ebbed and
451.60s: Float if we look at where we had some of
454.40s: those really really busy periods you can
457.68s: see that it did start to get a little
459.84s: busy back in January then it got super
464.08s: quiet super quiet start to get a little
466.40s: more active in Feb kind of early Feb
470.20s: quiet it down and then it did Spike up
473.48s: again not that long ago but the spikes
477.12s: that you see now are just nothing in
480.72s: context so even though that there are
484.08s: some you know signs of life in terms of
486.44s: net overall premium traded it's still
488.72s: just not very much so the options Market
493.48s: has been quiet in gam stop for some time
497.32s: now and it's not a good thing bad thing
499.48s: it just kind of is what it is the
501.52s: company right now is starting to lean
504.00s: more and more on its fundamental
506.04s: positioning So speaking of fundamental
508.48s: positioning
510.00s: I saw this post okay so it was today so
512.84s: this I saw this post pop up this was
515.08s: from coindesk and coindesk had commented
519.56s: that strive Asset Management CEO Matt
522.52s: Cole urges Ryan Cohen chairman CEO of
525.88s: GameStop to adopt as a reserve asset to
530.20s: adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset using
532.40s: the 5 billion in cash that's sitting on
534.00s: the balance sheet and Cohen responded
536.68s: letter received this is purely designed
541.84s: to build hype that's the reality now it
545.28s: would be very interesting if this is to
547.56s: occur and to what degree but the only
551.40s: reason on planet Earth why Cohen would
554.16s: post like that is to build some sort of
556.56s: hype around that idea because he
558.60s: absolutely knows that this is something
561.20s: that a lot of GameStop holders have
563.56s: really requested for some time now is to
565.84s: add some Bitcoin and I will continue to
568.52s: reiterate the point
571.28s: GameStop is here because of the
572.76s: shareholders because of you because of
575.40s: the Apes without you the company
579.80s: overwhelmingly likely would have
581.80s: collapsed so I do believe that there's
585.00s: some element of him that fully
587.44s: understands and recognizes that and
590.36s: probably builds that into some of the
593.64s: choices he's likely to make so that's
597.56s: the main reason why he would comment on
599.96s: this because if he wanted to continue
601.80s: moving in the dark like he's been
603.60s: broadly then there would be the status
605.52s: quo right so the fact that he took the
607.72s: time to comment on this in a way that
610.12s: obviously is very public that tells us
612.84s: something about the expected positioning
615.12s: so it actually would not surprise me at
617.60s: all to see Gamestop start to scoop up
620.44s: some Bitcoin now I also have to be
622.64s: honest though I thought we would have
626.56s: seen a little bit of Life Believe into
629.76s: GameStop on even that tweet so if we
632.88s: Zoom this in a little bit further um to
635.60s: get some context on the volume I mean I
638.24s: I did expect to see a little bit more
640.68s: life but the average volume is still
644.04s: bleeding down and this is probably not
648.56s: lack in part to the fact that Bitcoin
652.40s: itself is performing poorly so the idea
656.16s: of moving into Bitcoin right now
658.12s: although is probably smarter for the
660.12s: longer term Horizon but in the shorter
662.36s: term it's kind of like you know
663.92s: depending on when they look at doing
665.12s: this you might just be buying something
666.36s: that's going down in the shortterm
667.68s: that's not super ideal so there's
671.16s: probably a little bit of an element of
673.16s: that being tied into the movement that
676.20s: you see here in
679.28s: GameStop so let's take a quick look at
682.48s: the coverage strangle as promised so
684.84s: right now I'm still sitting on 250
686.64s: shares you can see I'm all the way up at
688.44s: 20 8821 so super far underwater just
691.92s: kind of sitting there holding things and
695.96s: that is what it is so I do have two
699.20s: different tranches of short options out
701.08s: I'm short the 25 puts and 21 March these
703.80s: are probably going to have to be rolled
706.24s: and then I'm short the 35 calls in 21
709.20s: March these are down at like 40 cents or
711.32s: something like that these can come down
712.48s: at a profit at pretty much when whenever
714.64s: I want so the game plan here is really
717.60s: straightforward I'm not at adding any
719.84s: shares to the long Equity position yet
723.08s: because you can see we're already pretty
724.92s: well utilized at
726.48s: 78% one of the things that I might do is
730.08s: when I roll these short puts I might
733.12s: size these down by one contract by
736.64s: sizing this down by one contract I
739.56s: unlock another 100 shares that I have
742.64s: access to to do whatever I want and in
746.12s: this case what I would want is As game
749.36s: stop starts to consolidate and show
753.00s: strength slowly start nibbling on some
755.88s: shares to build up this position now
758.28s: this is the downside essentially of
760.84s: managing a smaller position like if I
762.72s: was managing you can see the other
764.24s: coverage strangles that I typically
765.68s: trade their larger positions because you
768.56s: need a decent bit of capital in order to
770.88s: employ the idea in its largest in purest
773.76s: form but even with a really small
776.88s: allocation of $225,000 it's still
778.80s: completely viable it just means we have
781.12s: to be a little more cautious with the
782.40s: silver bullets that we use and the
783.76s: Silver Bullets meaning the remaining
785.24s: money so the scenario here actually is
789.20s: pretty pretty simple to be honest we're
791.68s: not using a bunch of the total amount
796.52s: allocated to it in the shares we're
797.96s: literally using only $7,000 of this
800.16s: total 25 so the majority of what we see
804.16s: here is tied to the short puts which is
807.12s: exactly what I want I want it as a
808.76s: satellite position because right now the
812.72s: this would be something I just continue
814.64s: to hold there's nothing I need to do
816.48s: with this the basis is fine it's a
818.20s: little high but it's okay and it'll
819.80s: absolutely come down as I slowly start
822.08s: to scale in with more shares so that's
825.40s: all there is to be done here it's a
827.40s: little bit of taking a tactical pause
829.20s: letting things move as they do one of
830.68s: the cool things about trading the
832.68s: coverage trangle is even though this
834.28s: kind of stuff is going on we still have
836.64s: profits built from prior short options
840.36s: that we've sold and taken in so we have
842.04s: $692 in puts
844.92s: $353 in short calls none of this is St
847.84s: WR home about but if you think about it
850.00s: it's about a th000 bucks on something
853.04s: that that's realized profit and in the
855.68s: time span that I started trading this
857.48s: for you all it's up about
860.60s: 0.45% so it's not a bad return that's
863.20s: realized p&l That's not including what's
865.84s: up here the extra 142 bucks and this
868.40s: will probably come in at a loss because
870.68s: I'm going to have to roll it but the
872.12s: point is by trading these options around
873.84s: it even though it's not doing what we
875.60s: would like it to do we can still make
876.84s: some money so that's the game plan is
880.12s: now if you have any questions as always
882.12s: let me know be an outlier I'll see you
883.60s: later
