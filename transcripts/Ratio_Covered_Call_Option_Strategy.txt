0.60s: the ratio covered call option strategy
3.56s: how I trade it some important notes
5.80s: about it and why I think it is better
8.44s: than the covered call and I'm going to
10.40s: walk you through an example at the very
12.12s: end so with that let's get right to it
14.20s: for those that don't know this is
16.24s: essentially a part of my coverage
18.52s: strangle strategy we're just breaking
20.28s: out a specific segment and applying it
22.60s: to the people that like to trade covered
24.28s: calls cuz a lot of folks like to do that
26.04s: and that's totally cool we're going to
27.76s: start with looking at a covered call for
29.44s: context the Assumption here is that you
31.52s: already generally know what this is but
33.36s: if you don't I'll give you a quick recap
35.40s: a covered call typically means we're
37.16s: going to have the same overall Delta
40.04s: potential for long and short Deltas so
43.68s: in this case we have a 1: one or a 2 to2
46.88s: reduced down one to one so this is long
50.32s: 200 shares of Tesla and short two calls
55.00s: so what this means is we have a maximum
57.36s: of long 200 Deltas from our shares and
60.08s: then a maximum of -200 Deltas from the
63.28s: short calls and that leads to this right
65.60s: here you'll notice once we get to the
68.16s: max profit potential for the trade which
71.12s: is going to be our short call strike
74.68s: plus whatever premium we received from
77.36s: the trade and any incremental change
80.56s: over that going forward as in if the
82.76s: underlying continues to Rally it doesn't
84.92s: matter our profit potential is capped at
88.92s: that maximum profit Zone let's compare
92.04s: that to the ratio covered call and as
95.00s: you'll notice right out of the gate we
97.20s: have a slightly different risk profile
100.20s: where that same scenario that I was just
102.64s: showing you doesn't exist we have
104.88s: unlimited upside potential how does this
108.28s: happen well it means that we're going to
110.28s: have more long Deltas than short Deltas
114.72s: so in this same exact
116.60s: scenario I am long 200 sh of Tesla so
121.60s: that's our stock position down here but
124.00s: I'm only short one covered call or one
128.12s: call against those 200 shares so I have
131.80s: 200 maximum long Deltas
135.08s: And1 100 maximum short Deltas so it
138.80s: means I have 100 uncovered Deltas that
142.68s: is how we have unlimited upside
144.80s: potential so what's the tradeoff if
147.64s: you've traded for any period of time you
149.56s: know there's a tradeoff and here it is
152.44s: we are unlocking uncapped upside
155.08s: potential that's awesome and I value
157.48s: that very highly but the tradeoff we're
160.68s: receiving less money upfront so that
164.24s: means if for whatever reason we don't
166.92s: get the move we think we're supposed to
169.20s: get whoops sorry about that then if we
173.00s: don't get the move that we think we're
174.32s: supposed to get then we have less of a
176.52s: hedge to help us out that's kind of a
178.84s: problem so I I want to walk you through
180.64s: an example on how this actually plays
182.84s: out in just a minute but before that I
184.64s: want to talk to you about the management
186.36s: of this trade so my again underlying
189.84s: hypothesis here is that you already have
192.28s: something that you like to trade you
194.80s: already have a structure to go around
197.28s: pick the products that you like you
199.36s: already have money management strategy
201.56s: wrapped around how you like to scale
203.28s: into things if you don't I'm going to
204.96s: talk to you about some of that in just a
207.04s: second but I want to get into the flow
210.28s: so that you understand how this thing
211.68s: looks and then I'm going to bring you
212.96s: over to an example that we're actually
214.60s: going to walk through live using the on
216.64s: demand feature on thinker swim so we're
219.04s: going to start in this case rather than
220.56s: a cach secured put like we typically
222.56s: would in the coverage strangle we're
224.16s: just going to assume that we've already
225.44s: been assigned and we have long shares
227.36s: then we're going to offer the ratio
228.92s: covered call I'm going to talk to you
230.32s: about the thought process behind what
232.16s: ratios and what expirations and Deltas
234.24s: in just a second but we're going to
236.60s: offer whatever we are going to offer for
238.56s: the ratio covered call being short calls
241.64s: then we have a couple scenarios those
243.72s: short calls can be out of the money in
245.40s: which case we just go back and start
247.12s: over again or those short calls can be
249.20s: in the money then we have two choices we
251.28s: can either roll that position if we want
254.20s: to try and defend the in the money short
256.56s: calls and that kind of brings us back up
258.52s: to this scenario or we can allow
260.40s: assignment where our long Shares are
263.20s: going to be called away so that is
266.32s: essentially allowing the long shares
269.16s: that are tied up so in this scenario
271.24s: over here if we have long 200 shares but
274.64s: only short one covered call it means
276.72s: we're going to lose 100 of those shares
279.64s: and in that scenario you still have 100
281.24s: shares left so if you have a big enough
284.36s: position or if you choose to buy more
286.04s: shares you can go back to the ratio
287.52s: covered call you could turn it into a
289.24s: regular covered call at that time if you
290.88s: want or you could flatten the whole
292.72s: thing at that point in time which a lot
294.68s: of times is what I would do and it
296.64s: depends on the trade hypothesis because
299.16s: if we think the underlying is going to
301.88s: go up into perpetuity and we're still
304.36s: really bullish then I wouldn't flatten
306.44s: but if I made an original trade
308.48s: hypothesis the trade moved in that favor
311.76s: again in line with my hypothesis and
314.00s: then I reassess and I say okay it's made
315.96s: the move I think it was supposed to make
317.72s: so it's time for me to flatten out and
319.56s: move on to the next opportunity it
321.48s: really depends on your disposition
322.84s: towards the product okay now I want to
325.16s: Pivot us over to an example and like I
327.00s: said in order to do that I want to use
328.40s: on Demand right now I have this back in
331.12s: time it's the beginning of January so
333.88s: this is 6 Jan um 2023 so just the
338.28s: beginning of this year because I
339.84s: actually had some positions on in here
341.56s: so I thought it would be kind of fun to
344.00s: use the essential product that I did now
348.32s: you'll notice as I fast forward time
350.04s: there's going to be more of these dots
351.40s: and some of them aren't aligned on
352.96s: anything and it's because they're
354.92s: actually tied to the trade that I put on
357.36s: so I'm going to zoom this out to 10 Feb
359.12s: real quick so you can you can kind of
359.96s: see the flow of the trade and as you can
362.16s: tell I'm purposefully testing this in a
364.48s: bullish environment because that's
366.16s: really the main comparison I want to
368.28s: make between these products so I'm going
371.48s: to take us back out and we're going to
373.28s: go to Six Jan and then we're going to
377.16s: essentially establish a um ratio covered
380.84s: call so to do that I'm going to
384.00s: buy instead of sell I'm going to buy and
386.72s: let's say I'm going to do 500 shares and
389.24s: let's start with the covered call so I'm
391.32s: going to do 500 shares send those out
394.12s: the door and most people when they're
396.20s: selling a covered call they'll kind of
397.88s: offer all of their um all of their
401.28s: options at once so let's say we go out
403.36s: to like a 34 Delta something like that
407.00s: and let's say that we're going to sell
408.96s: five here so now what you'll notice and
412.64s: I'm getting instant fills because it's
414.28s: all fake this is paper um but if you'll
416.96s: notice we have 500 long deltas and we
419.92s: have -500 short Deltas so this is a
423.64s: covered call and our maximum profit
425.44s: potential is going to be realized at 130
428.72s: plus the premium received which is 540
431.36s: so
432.16s: 13540 and let's now fast forward and see
436.44s: what the result of this is I'm just
438.36s: going to take us right up to expiration
440.48s: to save us some time here and in this
443.56s: case you can see that we had obviously
445.40s: an insane rally during the life cycle of
448.84s: this trade so with that big old rally
452.64s: this trade would be walking out at a
455.28s: overall p&l of
457.56s: $10,950 give or take so this is showing
461.76s: us what this one instance would look
464.76s: like if we sold all five short calls at
467.24s: once now a quick admin note if you are
470.12s: trading the coverage strangle or I'm
471.72s: sorry I use that strategy so much I
473.80s: literally just say it um but if you are
476.08s: trading the covered call one of the
478.88s: simplest ways you can optimize your
480.88s: performance is instead of offering all
483.40s: five short calls at once in this
485.68s: scenario would be to sell one each week
488.72s: and it avoids this exact scenario where
491.12s: all of your short calls are out there
493.04s: and the underlying made this big move
495.16s: sometimes we can do that sometimes we
496.48s: can't but if you still prefer the um
500.36s: covered call that's what I would do to
502.20s: modify this now that part aside let's
505.76s: talk about the p&l of the trade so as we
508.40s: can see we made 4 won 825 on the
510.84s: underlying and we lost uh
513.84s: 3875 on the shorts obviously we'll keep
516.84s: the premium we collected and that
519.08s: premium we collected is an important
520.88s: note because that's going to be one of
522.04s: the big differences between this and the
523.92s: other version of this so in
526.80s: total we collected $2,700 in premium UPF
530.72s: front Okay cool so let's go ahead and
533.96s: reset this whole shebang we're going to
536.16s: go back in time to the same exact
538.80s: starting point 6 Jan and instead of the
544.60s: previous example where we had a covered
546.76s: call we're going to do an uncovered call
549.40s: now my typical preference for the
551.48s: uncovered call as I was just
553.08s: highlighting would be instead of just
555.24s: selling all of my short calls in this
558.84s: expiration it would be to Lad them out
562.16s: week over week so something I might do
564.64s: to that example would be sell two in the
567.64s: 13 genan two in the Jan 2 in the 27
570.80s: genan or 1 in the 27 genan or zero in
572.76s: the 27 genan it depends on how you want
574.80s: to spread them out but essentially I
576.60s: would want to make sure I have at least
578.48s: 100 shares uncovered so but to keep it
581.48s: closer to an Apples to Apples comparison
584.24s: I'm not going to do any of that I'm
585.92s: going to pick our very same short call
589.00s: here and instead of selling five we're
592.32s: literally just going to sell four maybe
594.68s: three if you're super bullish in this
596.88s: case I was but again to keep it to a
599.08s: close cler non preferential look back
602.32s: I'm going to say that we sold four so in
604.68s: this case I want to talk to you real
607.08s: quick about our selection process if I'm
610.08s: thinking about whether it's a covered
612.56s: call or a ratio covered call the closer
616.56s: I can trade typically the happier I am
619.28s: and it's because it allows me to get
620.64s: more Cycles in you're going to make
622.28s: aggregate more money that way than going
624.08s: further out in time the other thing I'm
626.56s: going to try to do is find a balance so
629.36s: let's say that I want to do this 35 days
632.36s: expiration I want it to be above my cost
635.36s: bases that's for sure so my cost base in
637.24s: this scenario is 11360 I want it above
639.80s: that okay I could sell this 114 what's
643.60s: the trade-off here if I sell the 114 I'm
646.92s: going to collect more money up front but
649.80s: I have less capital gains potential so
653.20s: what I mean by that is I can make let's
655.04s: just call it $1,100 by selling the 114
658.36s: but in terms of cap Capal gains I can
660.04s: only make 40 cents per share in this
663.52s: scenario I'm collecting much less
665.84s: upfront I'm only collecting $540 up
669.28s: front as compared to 11 but instead of
672.24s: only having 40 cents of profit potential
675.08s: I now am allowed to run up to $130 so
678.40s: it's like $15 $16 plus so you
681.44s: essentially are making a judgment call
684.28s: do you think something is going to run a
686.56s: lot and if so you might go further out
689.40s: of the money so that you are not getting
692.44s: um stuck on capped upside potential
695.56s: prematurely if you want to unwind the
698.40s: position you've had it for a long time
699.84s: it's already made the move you thought
701.12s: it should make it's time to rebalance
703.16s: the portfolio risk things like that
704.96s: maybe you sell closer at the money and
707.24s: accept that trade-off I'm going to make
708.88s: more money up front but if I do get a
710.84s: big run I'm going to miss out on it
712.48s: totally up to you you got to figure out
713.76s: what's right so in this case I'm just
715.68s: picking the same thing and we did four
718.04s: instead of five and I'm going to do the
719.72s: same exact things last time we're going
721.00s: to fast forward right to expiration last
723.48s: time we made about 10 grand something
725.24s: like
726.00s: that and in this case we're at
729.16s: 17125 so you can see it's a much greater
731.52s: return potential this is an extreme
733.08s: example to be abundantly clear because
734.92s: this is a huge move to have in a short
736.64s: period of time but if I'm trading
738.88s: something like a covered call or a ratio
741.92s: covered call this is what I want to see
743.96s: this is the scenario I'm attempting to
745.96s: expose myself to so that's why I
748.12s: selected this one the main tradeoff here
750.68s: is if the opposite happened and we moved
753.44s: down I just would have collected less
755.52s: money up front so that's the trade-off
758.28s: here you can either have much greater
760.08s: profit potential if you use uncovered or
762.92s: I don't use uncovered because that's
764.08s: kind of synonymous with naked short
766.36s: calls but in this case they're covered
767.76s: because you have the underlying but
768.96s: you're selling them at a ratio you're
770.28s: just uncovering your upside potential so
773.00s: the ratio covered call favors giving us
775.96s: upside potential but it finds a balance
778.52s: between upside potential but still
780.40s: collecting enough money UPF front
782.32s: because in this scenario you essentially
783.88s: just collected $500 less dollar because
786.28s: it's one lot less but you unlocked
788.84s: significantly more profit potential if
790.64s: you get the big move that you think
791.96s: might happen so it's all a judgment call
794.40s: based on your perceptions but this is
795.72s: one of my absolute favorite strategies
797.68s: and like I said this is baked into my
799.00s: coverage strangle strategy which I'll
800.36s: throw a link in the video description
802.52s: below if you haven't seen that yet if
804.12s: you made it to the end don't forget to
805.44s: like subscribe be an outlier and I'll
806.88s: see youall later
