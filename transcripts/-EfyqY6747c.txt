303.00s:  you
330.00s:  you
360.00s:  time creating content on. And that's been a unbelievably welcome ad to what I do. And I
368.64s:  know for some of that diehard fans, at least of the channel, they're like, yo, why are you
372.40s:  spending so much time on game stop? And I just try to remind them that I'm learning a lot.
379.12s:  And people that have been in markets for as long as I have, it's not as common to be able to
384.80s:  learn a lot of brand new things. And that's literally what's happening with game stop in general
390.88s:  is I have an opportunity to learn a lot of new things. And that's a massive part of what motivates
396.88s:  me is learning. So that's been super, super fun. The original goal I have in my whiteboard right
403.76s:  over here, over there, I'm holding a black pen so you can't see it. But over there pointing
408.64s:  with the black pen, the original goal was 25,000 YouTube subs. That was the original goal. And
415.20s:  we exceeded that a little while ago. And then we kind of resumed back with like the slow,
421.44s:  steady growth trajectory, which has been great. Actually, fun fact in case you guys didn't know.
427.12s:  But over the last week, I've gone through two different days where I've had massive amounts
434.40s:  of relative massive amounts of subscribers coming off the channel, which to me looks like
441.04s:  debt accounts being dropped. And I welcome this. The I had 78 drop off and then 83 drop off,
449.68s:  which is hands down by far the most I've ever had unsubscribed in a day. Typically it's if there's
455.92s:  a negative trend, it might be like three, right? Just a small channel. So seeing that actually,
463.52s:  I'm really happy with because I don't think that's individual people going in and unsubscribing
468.48s:  that just happened to all line up on this specific day. Right? That's not how those kinds of
473.36s:  data points work. That looks like debt accounts being killed by YouTube. And I think that's great
479.20s:  because one of the things that I try to do is make sure that the content that I'm making is
484.40s:  relevant, useful, but also authentic things that come from my heart, from my passion. And hopefully,
491.28s:  you all can feel that because if I'm spending time building stuff that I don't really care about
497.44s:  or if I'm just trying to spend time building content for the sake of trying to grow the channel,
503.04s:  you all know full well by now. It's just not what I'm here for. It's not what I do. I actively
508.56s:  essentially move against that goal. And a great example of that is in the discord. We literally
513.68s:  cut the discord by almost 80%. I want to say that doesn't help me grow, right? It's the opposite.
520.40s:  But I care so much more over the quality of our community, the quality of the information I
528.32s:  present. And that's one of the things I'm hoping to really dig down on in 2025. So my goal for 2025
536.48s:  is 40,000 total YouTube subs. So not like 40 additional, but 40,000 total. And that would
544.56s:  represent the highest run rate that's even including the surge that I got from
551.52s:  stumbling into the GameStop community, which probably is about tapped out now.
556.08s:  I would need to surpass that. So the overwhelming probability of me actually hitting that is
562.08s:  pretty low. I would say maybe a 40% chance. But when I'm setting goals like this,
568.64s:  that's I'm cool with that because it's going to force me to get really innovative and thoughtful
575.44s:  on how I can try to tap into that 40% success rate. And there's a lot of stuff that I have in the
584.56s:  works right now. I'm going through integrating a ton of the feedback. And for the folks that have
590.16s:  taken the time to submit feedback, you have no idea how helpful that is for me. The reason why I
595.36s:  ask you all for the feedback is because I still am a very much a one man band. So I have limited
602.16s:  time and effort that I can spend on things. So by understanding the things that are most useful to
609.44s:  you, that lets me build stuff and focus on stuff that's most useful to you. And it's a much better
616.48s:  use of all of our time. So thank you for those that have taken the time to fill that out both
621.20s:  from the general community, the broad outlier community, which will always be free. That will
627.04s:  that that's never going to change. That's always going to be free. But then there's also the
631.68s:  paid side of things that I'm always trying to innovate and make that really impactful from for
638.32s:  people and to provide value. That's more specific to that group. And I have a bunch of things in the
648.16s:  works for that. So for the pros side of things, we already have our weekly live streams
654.96s:  dialed in. We started a question form for those that are unable to make the live streams.
660.80s:  I'm reconfiguring the discord so that more of the conversation happens in the free section
666.88s:  for everybody. But then in the pros section, there still would be more focus on like research,
672.40s:  people at direct access to me stuff like that. And the downside is you all should be aware of
678.80s:  and I continue to remind you all of maintaining the free section of the discord is we're always
683.36s:  going to have these fucking spam and it's never going to go away. So I do my best to manage that.
689.92s:  But for those that don't know how it works, what people will do is they'll join the discord,
695.76s:  they'll get past the initial verification. And then there will be people that stay in the discord
702.48s:  that don't communicate too much that relay names because you can see everybody. There's no way
707.44s:  to turn that off. Unfortunately, they'll relay names to accounts that pretend to be me or other people
714.40s:  and to try to trick them. So you should be aware of how the game works so that you know one to just
721.52s:  stay out of the DMs. But to if you do choose to DM, just be super certain who you're choosing to
726.80s:  communicate with. But that is just you know, table stakes for offering a free community. And I hope
735.60s:  that it's not super annoying for people that you guys can manage it because it's more, it's
740.00s:  genuinely more important for me to maintain a free community in a free space because the thing is
746.08s:  is if we go through a place like Reddit, Reddit is great. And you can learn a lot from Reddit.
753.12s:  The problem with Reddit though is that most of the interaction you're going to get there is going
759.04s:  to be exactly the kind of interaction you would expect to see. So for example, if we grab Reddit
768.40s:  and let's just click this first one, got SMCI calls for June. Not my second purchase ever,
774.48s:  but the one that comes before the second, I'll either learn or succeed. Hope I succeed. I hope
779.44s:  it word it like that to avoid being auto-spammed. Right? So there will be some interactions here.
790.56s:  But if you think about the actual value of the discourse that's going on here, there's no value
797.68s:  taking place here. There's just very little value. This person saying you picked SMCI is your first
803.68s:  or this person says the come out is often opposite. Right? It's just like, it's just random words
809.68s:  being said by random people. This is not what I'm interested in for our community. Again, this is not
817.20s:  complaining or talking shit about Reddit. Reddit has its purpose. But the reason why most people go
823.52s:  to Reddit is for anonymity. And through anonymity, you see a completely different version of people
830.80s:  than if it's somebody that you actually know that you get to learn a little bit about, that you
835.92s:  actually have a bit of a relationship with. Right? Like a lot of the people that have been around in
840.32s:  the discord for a while, we actually kind of know each other for literally several years now.
847.12s:  And we have a sense of people. That goes a long way in conversations and things like that. So I am
854.88s:  so much more interested in fostering that kind of community because to me, that's where the gap
862.64s:  currently sits. There's a lot of this kind of stuff out there. There's a lot of the alert services
868.56s:  out there, which you know is my the bane of my existence. I hate that stuff. So that's what I'm
875.12s:  really focusing on is to try and continue growing our community, but not growth in terms of just
882.08s:  numbers, growth in terms of quality of the relationships. A big thing that I'm trying to work towards
889.28s:  is getting our community members to interact more regularly with one another without me needing to be
897.44s:  the the starter of the conversation or the leader of the conversation. I want more and more for
903.68s:  different of our community members to step up and to start fostering that dialogue. And I can see
909.12s:  and it's awesome to see because that's where the beauty of a community like ours will really take
917.92s:  hold because there's a reality of things. Again, I am one dude. I cannot spend the amount of time
924.72s:  that I would like to spend directly interacting with each person with the level of quality that I
930.80s:  would want because that's another thing that I refuse to let go. I refuse to give people
937.68s:  bullshit fast answers because it's easier for me. Meanwhile, the vast majority of what we talk about
944.32s:  has tremendous nuance. And again, that's another thing that's completely missing is the people that
949.68s:  are willing to take the time to explore the nuance. Things like buying isn't always bad. Selling premium
956.48s:  isn't always bad. Stuff like that. So I really appreciate the community members that have been stepping
964.40s:  up more and more, interacting and even asking questions, helping people answer questions. That stuff
971.04s:  is huge. And what you will notice is the more we do that is a community, the more it will take a life
976.64s:  of its own and the better of a resource it's going to turn into for all of you. Like that's just the
982.08s:  facts. So the interaction of the community to be completely honest, it doesn't really benefit me
989.76s:  as a person that much. I'm going to do whatever I'm going to do and I've always done it that way.
994.80s:  So what I mean by that is the way that I trade is completely self-sufficient. I don't look at
998.96s:  shit. I just do my own stuff. But for people that are figuring out what they're doing and people that
1004.80s:  are trying to build their approach or refine their approach, that communal aspect is something I always
1011.92s:  wish I had. And now I'm really excited to be able to continue furthering that with you all.
1017.12s:  2024 was a killer year. So I'm going to go over like my performance review and all that stuff.
1024.16s:  I'll probably do it on the main channel at a high level just so that everybody can see where I
1029.12s:  landed. It's no secret. I try to be as forthcoming as I can about what I do and my overall performance
1036.64s:  so that just people know that's not because I think it's something that serves as a top end
1043.52s:  for other people or a bottom end. It's just what I do and it's what I'm capable of.
1048.16s:  But the main thing is there's just such a gross lack of transparency in the trading space that
1054.16s:  that's the main reason why I give you guys those performance updates. And then for those that are
1058.88s:  in the pro section, obviously, we'll go through the annual deep dive together. That's slated in my
1063.36s:  mind for this Sunday is to actually go through and start, start sharing a lot of the lessons learned
1072.32s:  because this year is fascinating. This year, I changed a lot. And for anybody that started with
1078.24s:  the channel when I first began making videos back in 2020, you'll notice a lot of differences in what
1084.64s:  I talk about and how I do things even from then to now. One, again, that's four years of research
1090.32s:  later. But two more importantly, you will notice that I do my absolute best to adapt to the market.
1100.40s:  So what that means is I don't have the luxury of always doing the same thing every single year
1106.24s:  just because that's what I do the same thing or whatever this one thing is. That's just not how I
1111.44s:  trade. My ultimate objective as a trader is to do everything I can to see what the market is doing
1119.12s:  and then to try to fit with the market to take as much advantage of it as I possibly can.
1124.96s:  And when I say take as much advantage, that doesn't mean pure top line returns. That's not the most
1131.92s:  advantageous way to take advantage of the market. It's also on a risk adjusted basis.
1139.20s:  So that is the goal for 2025. So to recap 2024, absolutely great trading year for me. It was
1147.28s:  over 90% year, not triple digits. I thought about that for a little bit. And I actually posted about
1154.40s:  that in the discord because that's another thing I really want to continue trying to represent to
1161.84s:  you all is that I am not a dude that hasn't all figured out. I absolutely don't. I'm 33. Fortunately,
1168.80s:  I've done really well, but I'm still figuring this shit out. I have a long way to go before I can
1174.72s:  sit or things like dialed in. And I don't even know if they ever will be with a person that has a
1179.76s:  brain like mine. It's a continual optimization process. But I posted in the discord a while ago
1188.32s:  about a thought process I was having with myself. And I purposely share those things with you all
1194.88s:  to show you that I don't have it all figured out. And that I am still reasoning and thinking through
1201.36s:  things myself. And it's okay to do that. I'm not omnipotent. I am just a fucking internet dude.
1208.88s:  I am I try to remind you all of that pretty regularly because sometimes when I watch different
1214.40s:  videos and stuff, it feels like the people try to come off as omnipotent or they have an answer
1220.40s:  for everything. And again, I just find that so disingenuous. There's a lot of shit. All of us don't
1224.80s:  fucking know. And that's okay. It's okay to not know everything. You're never going to know anything.
1229.52s:  Everything. So I was thinking about there was a pointer in the year where I was just like,
1237.44s:  I actually could have another triple digit year. I absolutely could have. And I thought about it
1242.96s:  for a little bit. And I was just like, why do I want this? Like why do I want another triple
1248.08s:  digit year? What's the purpose behind it? The money obviously is good, right? Always want to make
1253.04s:  more money. Always helpful for sure. Right. But I'm not at a spot where the difference between a 90%
1259.92s:  return and 100% return is going to make a massive difference in the next year for me.
1264.48s:  So it's not for that. So then what was it? Why why did I even think about it? Well, it's because
1270.96s:  triple digit is a pretty strong return. And it's also something that it has a clear benchmark,
1277.68s:  right? Like 100. Our minds work in those number patterns. And we've looked at examples like this
1284.40s:  before. Even if I look at this stock that's up on the graph now, if we go into the options chain,
1290.08s:  if I go into increments of five, I already know I'm going to see more options in increments of five
1297.12s:  than other increments. That's just a natural presence for people in the way that they select
1303.92s:  things. So my brain was doing elements of that. When I saw that another triple digit year is definitely
1310.48s:  within possibility. So let me try and say, see, you know, what I could do, what I might be able to pull
1319.04s:  out here. And then I thought about it more. And I realized that it was just a completely
1324.48s:  superficial vanity metric for me. And it didn't necessarily add any significant value to what I was
1330.48s:  doing. It didn't add a lot of purpose to what I was doing. So then I decided that if I hit it,
1336.80s:  cool, if I didn't, okay, that's fine too. And I didn't. And I didn't go out of my way to hit it.
1342.80s:  And it was essentially half a trading month for me because I was traveling for half of it. And what
1347.84s:  that means is before I travel, I have to start pairing things down. So really I traded for like
1355.52s:  10 days this month. If that I did trade a little bit while I was traveling, but not enough,
1360.56s:  to make that kind of movement. So yeah, very, very interesting end of the year for me. A lot
1370.48s:  of a lot of changes in strategy specifically process didn't change that much. The way that I do
1376.16s:  things hasn't changed that much for a long time now. But the broader methodology definitely has.
1382.64s:  And that's what I want to spend a little time talking about once I finished consolidating
1387.12s:  all of those things. The other thing that we have to talk about quickly obviously is the
1392.16s:  paper trading challenge. So for the outlier pro members, we run, we started a paper trading
1398.00s:  challenge. I've ran these before. And we now have the 2024 results. This was just for the final
1408.48s:  quarter of 2024. And if we take a look and see where we landed, we have our C2C tab. And all
1418.56s:  of these should be completely updated. I don't know for these members where they landed because
1424.56s:  they didn't input their stuff here. So I'm not looking in the individual tabs. This is where I look
1429.60s:  and this looks like isra is our winner. Now I will go through and carefully check everything
1437.68s:  just to make sure that it all lines up. But when we take a look at the overall performance,
1444.48s:  it's about the distribution I would expect. We had members that were just trying, trying ideas.
1451.52s:  We had members that were working on specific areas of the skill set. So this overall is a very
1459.44s:  reasonable performance. We do have a couple that absolutely had runner runner negative year or
1466.48s:  quarter, I should say. And those always necessitate taking a closer look, right? And see what
1472.88s:  happened, what went wrong. The fact of the matter is is this paper trading challenge is the exact
1477.68s:  place to do that. This is the exact place to learn. That's the point of it. So we'll run through
1485.20s:  this. But so far it looks like this will be our winner. Isra. So I'll make a couple posts. And
1490.88s:  I'll talk to the Patreon folks because we did have optional pot open to for the winner. So we'll
1497.92s:  figure all that out. Now for this next year, we have a new structure and a new imperative.
1507.84s:  So for this coming year, rather than paper trading from the perspective of just trying to maybe
1517.52s:  test a new strategy, test a new approach, test a new idea, what I really want the participants to
1524.08s:  do this coming year is to trade this paper trading account exactly as they intend to trade their
1533.52s:  real account. And for those that have a real account that they're going to continue trading,
1538.72s:  cool, then you could just mirror your stuff between them. If you don't have a real account,
1544.08s:  you're still paper trading. Cool. Treat this as your actual account. The reason is because we
1551.44s:  now have a full year that we're going to run this on. We're going to take quarterly snapshots
1557.28s:  as like a milestone. But we have a full year of performance in front of us. And what I'm going
1564.40s:  to do is the same thing I've done previously, which is each week, I'm going to go through different
1570.48s:  people at random and take a look at what I can see and give you feedback. That's exactly what we
1578.08s:  did this year, where I can pop open one of these individual tabs. It'll take me directly to it.
1584.16s:  And I can look through what happened. I can look through what kind of trades went on how they were
1589.44s:  placed. The thought process behind it, I can look at things like trade sizing, all of those kinds
1595.28s:  of details I can look at and try to give coachable feedback. This is the best possible way,
1603.52s:  literally the best possible way to learn how to trade in my opinion. The idea of just learn by
1609.92s:  doing, this is how you learn by doing while you have a finite resource because that's the reality
1615.52s:  of trading. You have a finite resource called money. So if your approach to learn how to trade is
1622.32s:  baked around while just kind of play around with real money and see how it goes. The overwhelming
1627.68s:  probabilities, you're going to fucking lose it. The overwhelming probability. And it's just because
1631.44s:  the shit is complex, it takes a long time to figure out. So the probability that you're going to start
1636.72s:  even with a $50,000 account and just wiggle your way through and learn using real money on that
1643.12s:  $50,000 account without either entirely blowing it up or drawing it down by over 50% is about no.
1650.08s:  I'm very confident taking that position about no. So the issue with that is you only get so many
1659.92s:  repetitions then because you only have so much money you can use. So if you can apply a true
1667.52s:  traders methodology to paper trading and take it seriously like we are here, we're literally
1672.88s:  logging our trades every freaking day. That takes effort, but you can learn so much from this process
1682.48s:  without lighting your money on fire. This is I think one of the coolest things that you have
1692.24s:  available to you from a learning perspective. And I cannot encourage everybody even if you're not
1697.68s:  in the outlier pro patreon and you're not going to be in this challenge specifically,
1703.36s:  I genuinely believe everybody should be doing this. And it's for those exact reasons. It gives you
1709.28s:  a chance to learn refine your craft without lighting money on fire that you probably don't have
1714.40s:  just light on fire. Really excited because we're going to have a full year now. That is such a great
1723.04s:  data set, especially to capture in a really organized fashion like we're going to be doing,
1728.96s:  which is going to be awesome. So that is the paper trading challenge for 25. That is the winner for
1736.72s:  24. So congrats to Esra. And like I said, I'll validate it. Make sure everything looks good
1742.88s:  because I did see a couple open trades. Those all have to be closed out. And we have to make sure
1746.64s:  that the numbers settle where they should be. But overall looks looks pretty good. So that now
1755.44s:  leads us to the second part of the video today, which is actually to kick off 2025. We spend a
1762.48s:  little time thinking about 24, thinking both about personal growth, but also about trading. What we're
1770.00s:  trying to accomplish there, what we did accomplish there. And now it's time to take a look at 2025
1775.52s:  and see what's coming up. So one of the things I did earlier was I ran through, I think it was
1783.12s:  through chat GPT here. And I'll read it to you. I asked chat GPT. I'm using a one. And I asked GPT
1795.60s:  research all projections for the economy and stock market in 2025, summarize your findings.
1802.24s:  Well, let's do that. Moderate growth, IMF forecast, the International Monetary Fund's
1808.72s:  World Economic Outlook, which is the WEO, you definitely should read that has indicated global
1814.24s:  growth settling in the range of three to three and a half percent through 2025. The IMF's over
1821.36s:  arching view is that global global growth will remain moderate and gradually stabilize,
1827.84s:  though downside risk process, which we can see emerging markets, particularly Asia,
1832.56s:  expected to continue growing faster than developed economies. We continue to see that trend. So
1837.60s:  I, yeah, I can understand why they would have that perspective. And there's a lot of different
1842.40s:  ways you can trade that via various ADRs and stuff like that. But I do agree that there's an
1848.72s:  opportunity there. The US economy is slower, but steady growth. Many investment banks like
1854.48s:  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and economic think takes think forecast of the US will see slower growth
1862.32s:  compared to 2021 to 2022 with GDP expansion, possibly around 1.5 to 2%. So that is pretty slow.
1871.04s:  The pace is expected to remain below historic boom levels, but generally avoids a severe
1875.36s:  downturn barring any large external shocks. That's going to be one to keep a close eye on.
1881.28s:  The inflation and Fed policy projections suggest inflation will continue to be moderate,
1886.16s:  but may remain above the 2% target for a while. By 25, the forecasters anticipate the Fed will have
1893.04s:  eased off the rate cycle, likely stabilizing. However, there's no consensus on the exact timing.
1901.60s:  So let's go into the stock market projections specifically. And this is looking at earnings growth
1908.32s:  first.
1913.36s:  Analysts generally see moderate earnings growth returning by 24 to 25 inflationary pressures
1918.48s:  and supply chain issues normalized, which we see. Companies with strong, this is important.
1924.32s:  Companies with strong pricing power and robust balance sheets like technology, some consumer
1931.12s:  sectors are projected to fare better than those heavily reliant on discretionary spending.
1936.00s:  This makes a ton of sense. The reason why this is so important is because those with pricing
1941.20s:  power can withstand the higher inflationary periods longer without overreliance on
1947.60s:  near-term spending at unfavorable rates and conditions. So I think that this makes a ton of
1953.52s:  sense.
1958.16s:  If interest rates remain relatively high, equity valuations could be constrained,
1962.72s:  conversely, if the Fed furthers the cuts that may boost valuations, that's kind of, you know,
1969.04s:  uh, obvious.
1971.60s:  Investment houses off from project S&P 500 to post moderate single digit to low double digit
1977.20s:  returns if the economic soft landing scenario holds.
1982.72s:  Sector leadership technology still viewed vaguely. I think that's still been the bell of the
1988.96s:  energy and industrials benefiting from shifts in supply chains and infrastructure spending.
1993.20s:  I don't know fully about that one. Energy has been struggling hard body. So I don't know how
2000.00s:  strong I agree with that one just yet. Consumer discretionary more vulnerable to elevated inflation
2005.76s:  interest rates, but could bounce back if spending remains resilient. There's also interesting
2010.72s:  because discretionary has been outperforming staples. So I question both of those.
2015.12s:  Global I don't care so much about potential risks and certainties, geopolitical tensions,
2023.60s:  there's still a ton of shit going on. The stuff with Ukraine is going to be a big deal. Essentially
2027.52s:  all of that. The fall through its Syria, all that stuff. Energy, the new energy initiatives are
2034.88s:  going to be really interesting coming from Trump and the way that that flows through the rest of
2041.20s:  the market will be very interesting, I think. Central bank missteps if the Fed and other central
2049.36s:  banks tighten or loosen to aggressively could spark volatility or stock growth, that's one of the
2053.04s:  major concerns that we literally have right now. All right, soft landing versus a recession.
2061.92s:  Many projections hinge on the idea of a soft landing where inflation cools without a severe
2067.12s:  recession. However, a mild recession in late 2425 isn't off the table. Well,
2073.92s:  clearly it's off the table for 24 to already fucking pass that. Or 25 is an off the table if
2078.88s:  consumer demand falls quickly or credit conditions tighten. So here are two big things if you
2085.44s:  weren't aware that you need to pay attention to, specifically consumer demand and credit conditions,
2091.76s:  the availability of capital. So two things to keep an eyeball as we rotate and move through 25
2098.80s:  because if you start to see those indicators starting to fall off, again, this is literally giving
2103.68s:  you a pre-warning that things might not look great. Stabilizing inflation, which we already know,
2113.52s:  fiscal stimulus, we already know divergence, we already know. Yeah. Overall, I think that this
2119.20s:  is decent. I think that there's some stuff in there that I do challenge the accuracy of.
2125.20s:  But in general, I think that's a completely fine overview. And as a reminder, the reason why I
2129.92s:  read that to you from there and then walk you through it is because I cannot overemphasize
2136.00s:  enough how much you should be using AI in your day to day to do just about everything. You are
2142.72s:  smarter with AI, you should use it. So there's my TED Talk on using AI, I suppose.
2151.44s:  Joseph says, can the bird flu affect interest rates as currently destroying farms? I don't know
2157.68s:  how bad it is yet. So let's see. Bird flu. Verity.
2172.08s:  Now, this is number 18. Patient hospitalized severe case of H5N1, bird flu and Louisiana.
2188.16s:  Partial viral genome, abavian influenza virus that infected the patient in Louisiana,
2193.36s:  indicates the virus belongs to the D1.1 genotype related to other D1.1 viruses recently detected
2201.60s:  in wild birds and poultry in the US. It's different than B13 dot or B3 dot 13 detected in dairy cows.
2210.32s:  Determine that the patient has exposure had exposure to sick and dead birds in backyard flocks.
2219.60s:  Verity cases severe H5N1 bird flu illness is not unexpected.
2226.32s:  No person, a person spread of H5 bird flu has been detected. Does does not change from the CDC's
2232.80s:  overall assessment of immediate risk of public health, which remains low?
2237.76s:  Yeah, I'm not sure just how impactful this is just yet.
2247.20s:  So Joseph, could there be an interaction? Sure. But as it sits right now, it doesn't seem like
2256.88s:  there is a tremendous impact, at least as things sit today.
2264.56s:  So Joseph says there is no eggs in California's in a state of emergency. Yeah, well,
2274.32s:  a couple of things. Eggs. Well, first, let's see if that's actually true if there are no eggs.
2279.92s:  There are no eggs.
2284.64s:  Current egg availability in the US.
2289.36s:  Let's see. It has been experiencing an egg shortage that have decimated the supply of
2296.80s:  laying hens. In 22, we produce 92.6 billion.
2302.32s:  Even flu, this is all 22.
2313.04s:  Okay, so it looks like there are eggs. Like I don't see that there are no eggs. It looks like
2318.88s:  there's a constraint. So that's the first thing. The second thing is eggs are good, but like
2327.28s:  there are eggs. You're okay without eggs. Everybody's okay without eggs.
2331.44s:  So the main reason why I'm highlighting that is just taking this back to basic principles of
2337.20s:  assessing overall severity and impact. So it doesn't look like eggs are gone.
2343.12s:  And eggs in and of itself isn't going to necessarily cripple us in the near term. Now,
2348.16s:  if it goes on for too long, eggs are used in a lot of things. So it definitely would have a
2352.72s:  broader impact for sure. I'm not I want to be clear. I'm not saying that there's no impact that
2357.36s:  this is no big deal at all. I'm just saying it's not the end of the world kind of deal.
2364.08s:  The second thing is the use of a state of emergency is specifically, it's a tactical use.
2371.84s:  You can use it for a lot of different things. So let's look at California state of emergency.
2378.88s:  And let's see. So this is six days ago. He is better lighting than I do.
2394.56s:  Proclaimed state of emergency action comes as cases were detected in dairy cows on farms in
2401.20s:  Southern California, signaling the need to further expand monitoring into build on the coordinated
2406.56s:  state wide approach to contain and mitigate the spread of the virus.
2411.12s:  To date, no person to person spread of the bird flow has been detected and nearly all
2415.36s:  infected individuals had exposure to infected cattle. They already established the largest
2421.12s:  testing and monitoring system shocker and the nation in response to the outbreak.
2427.04s:  This emergency proclamation will provide state and local agencies with additional flexibility
2431.76s:  around staffing, contracting, and other rules to support the evolving response.
2437.44s:  So the point I'm highlighting here is that don't look at state of emergency and take it as,
2446.16s:  oh, shit's going terribly, we're all fucked. That's not what a state of emergency is.
2450.88s:  The way that state of emergency is used is for resource management. And exactly the piece here
2458.96s:  that I'm highlighting for you, it's to provide slightly better access to things and to remove
2467.28s:  some of the bureaucratic overhead to be able to access them. That's the point.
2475.84s:  I make that point because a lot of people will see state of emergency and they'll think like,
2480.72s:  oh, we're fucked. Everything's going terribly. It's an emergency. But it's just a little bit
2487.28s:  sensationalized is the main point. Jeffrey Jones, happy new year to you, my friend, welcome in.
2494.32s:  So yeah, the short is I don't think that this is a huge deal yet. That doesn't mean that it can't
2501.20s:  be a huge deal, it can be. But it's just early days and this doesn't look to be that big if it
2507.28s:  deals to me just yet. And we'll absolutely see. That's the game is we don't know yet. But we will
2514.80s:  obviously find out it'll just take a little time. Cool. So let's close all that down. Let's see what
2521.60s:  this is might as well. And gold edges higher likely to say, stay resilient in 25. Gold is done well.
2536.88s:  If we take a quick peak at gold for it's. Yeah, gold did did pretty well.
2548.64s:  And it's been basing for a while now. Notice how it had this lower low, but then it caught itself.
2554.96s:  Had this higher low, this new higher low. Gold still looks okay to me here. Now it's not doing
2562.96s:  anything impressive to the top end. But it's also.
2574.56s:  It's not doing anything poorly to the downside in terms of like falling and rolling over.
2580.96s:  20. No, we want to be at what 24 was that? 2598.
2592.16s:  Create alert.
2597.20s:  What I'm doing is I'm getting rid of the contract specific and I'm using the normalized chart.
2602.08s:  So 2598.
2605.36s:  98.
2607.84s:  For those that don't know when you drop it in alert, like I typically do on futures charts,
2617.44s:  it'll default to the front contract, which I don't really care about the contract. This is the
2622.88s:  consolidated graph that's going to give us all of the different contracts normalized to one
2628.00s:  another. So that's why we look at this. So yeah, overall gold still looks pretty good to me. Now,
2636.96s:  again, I'll run through a bigger run down, but I still have the coverage triangle running in
2647.44s:  TQs, you pro, I bet GME. And I'm actually going to reconfigure it a little bit this year so that
2655.20s:  it's not all in these leveraged tickers. The main reason for that is I want to start building
2661.92s:  part of the portfolio that I'm not cycling on as much. So I'll probably use spy
2668.40s:  for the other section of the coverage triangle. I WM has been my go-to for a long time. You all
2673.92s:  know that more volatile. So you tend to get a little bit more premium. The problem is the small caps
2679.68s:  are in a bad spot right now. So I will continue to monitor small caps if there's a decent entry
2686.24s:  and opportunity in there. I'm always here for it. But I try to remind you all of this as much as I
2693.60s:  can. At the end of the day, you have to do what's right for you. I owe I WM fucking nothing.
2702.40s:  So if it's not behaving as I would need it to behave here in order for a coverage
2708.64s:  triangle to make sense, then I need to do something else, which is okay. So if we look at it on the
2714.40s:  year, it's ran essentially started here at 199 to 220. Had a 20 point move all year. It's again,
2724.72s:  not an awful year, but that's not a great year either. That's a pretty inside year. I don't really
2730.48s:  love that. Now another interesting thing though is when we look at spy, spy on the year
2739.12s:  had a really solid year. It started off at 427 ish. So really, really solid. Now the problem though
2749.68s:  is if we take a look at equal weighted spy, which is RSP, it had a good year, but not as good
2760.24s:  of a year. So this started around like 160 ish, 157, and it ended at 175. So a really good year,
2769.84s:  but the equal weight is showing still a pretty heavy dependence on a handful of names, which again,
2778.56s:  that's nothing new. I don't think that well, it shouldn't be surprising to anybody. It's been
2783.76s:  the case for some time now, but it means there's a lot of different ways to position leading into
2790.80s:  2025, depending on what you're trying to do. Now for me, nothing changes. The fact that it's now 2025
2797.76s:  versus 2024 literally makes no difference. I trade the market off of what it's been doing. So I
2805.12s:  know some people really like the idea of like coming in with like an annual overview or like an
2810.56s:  annual what to expect in 2025. Here's the facts. I don't know, fucking idea what to expect. I have
2816.16s:  no idea what's going to happen over the next year. I have no clue. We could have a bird flu right now
2821.76s:  that's super mellow and doesn't really do anything, or we can have a bird flu that gets super
2826.40s:  aggressive and starts torching things, right? Like that's why I don't care to come up with really
2832.32s:  specific things. Now I do like to think through what general themes do I expect to exist? And
2840.32s:  there are a handful of those themes. One of those themes is inflation. We still are hypersensitive
2845.20s:  to inflation. inflation level data in the economy. If we see the economy slowing, that's going to
2850.88s:  scoop the market big time because people are trying to decide still between this hard landing
2856.00s:  slash recession versus a soft landing. And again, we don't know what's of those it's looking like
2860.80s:  yet. It's leaning a little more soft as it sits, but it's too early to tell. We just don't know.
2866.08s:  So that's one of the themes that I'm absolutely keeping in mind for 25. Another theme that I think
2872.80s:  is pertinent is technology. Where do we think technology sets in terms of market dominance? Do we
2879.76s:  think technology is going to be the next leader for the year? And I personally do. I don't see
2886.72s:  a reason why that would change in the near term until conditions start to meaningfully change.
2893.04s:  And I just haven't seen the condition for that changing yet. I just haven't seen it yet.
2900.24s:  So one of the things I try to think about with respect to technology is that it has the ability
2907.52s:  to have an outsized impact relative to its cost. And there's not a lot of other industries that
2914.16s:  can do that. So what I mean by that is let's say an oil and gas that you really wanted to
2920.48s:  start crushing it in oil and gas. What do you need to do in order to produce more cheaply or whatever
2926.96s:  the ultimate objective is? You have to leverage technology of some sort. Technology is the accelerator
2932.88s:  that just about every industry is leaning on in order to continue to evolve and accelerate. I just
2939.36s:  don't see that changing just yet. But again, even though I don't see that changing just yet,
2944.16s:  that doesn't mean it won't. This is the nature of Bayesian analysis. I conduct the analysis based
2951.92s:  on everything that's available to me today. And I come up with my best assumptions today.
2957.04s:  And then tomorrow, if some shit changes, it changes. And I update my mental models.
2962.96s:  Because one of the mistakes I think people say get into is they'll be like, okay,
2968.00s:  I think this is going to be the case for 2025. Let me position my whole portfolio. And again,
2972.96s:  if you're an investor, fine, you're playing longer term themes anyway. But as a trader,
2977.76s:  to try and position a portfolio off of an annual level expectation, I think is a fool's errand.
2986.80s:  Because we can look at a couple examples even now where that might not reward you that
2993.36s:  handsomely. And I'll show you. So if we take a look at Nvidia, take a look. It ran from 47
3004.48s:  up to 140. It did that in the first half of the year. If you got into Nvidia after this massive
3014.56s:  run up, you have just about nothing to show for it for the second half of the year. It didn't do much.
3022.64s:  So what I'm trying to highlight to you is that this is still a completely fine trade, no problem.
3027.84s:  But from a trader's perspective, my job is to try and capture this move. And then when this starts
3035.36s:  happening, to go to something else that is showing a move that I can monetize. Because you can
3043.84s:  monetize this for sure. You can trade your strangles. You can still trade this. I'm actually going to
3048.08s:  open up a new covered strangle in here. So I'm not saying Nvidia is bad. I like Nvidia long term.
3053.28s:  But if you try to over position on some ideas that you have at the beginning of the year,
3060.32s:  I just think it's difficult because unless you're omnipotent and you know what's coming down
3065.36s:  the pike, which I don't know anybody is yet, if you are, let me know because we can make a lot
3069.28s:  of fucking money in this market together. But you're just, I'm just trying to position
3078.08s:  off of what's moving and what continues to define trends. So tech, if we're looking at things like
3083.84s:  Nvidia has been rotating sideways for some time now. Meta has been doing a little bit better.
3090.40s:  And Meta is also starting to move into other things that I think will continue to give it a
3097.60s:  pretty solid position. And that's one of the beautiful things of finding your way into something
3102.56s:  like spy is if we take a look at what its holdings are, I was trying to figure out what this was
3111.60s:  telling me, you're essentially getting pretty decent exposure to some of these top companies.
3118.24s:  Now it's still just grossly over waited for the top three Apple and video Microsoft. I mean,
3124.48s:  just grossly overweight. But it still continues to do pretty well in that with the waiting on
3132.40s:  the list in terms of its performance. So tech, I still think is the the place to be. And
3141.92s:  there's a couple different ways to gain exposure to it depending on how active you want to be and
3146.56s:  all that kind of stuff. But that's where I'm primarily looking, especially for growth for things
3153.84s:  that are really starting to rapidly accelerate. I still think it'll be dominantly through tech.
3159.04s:  I'm very eager to see what the IPO world looks like in 2025 because it definitely slowed down quite a
3165.04s:  lot. So it would be nice to see IPOs pick up a little bit and just to see some new names
3171.92s:  entering onto the market and moving things through. Let me take a look really quick. I don't know
3177.84s:  what the total IPOs were for 2024. But let's see if Chachi Petinos.
3186.96s:  I have to log in on that.
3195.04s:  Perfect.
3206.24s:  What were the total number of IPOs in 2022?
3215.36s:  Let's see.
3216.48s:  In 2024, the global market witnessed the notable increase in IPOs in the US. There were
3227.84s:  224 raising approximately 29.6 billion of 50% increase over 23, which 23 was also really, really slow.
3239.68s:  Let's see if there's a chart. Let's do US IPO chart. Why chart probably has some?
3253.04s:  Yeah, there we go.
3260.16s:  So 225 here, pretty strong on a relative basis. 21 was crazy. Absolutely crazy.
3275.84s:  And then before that, probably averaged somewhere in the twos, 0809, nobody tried to go.
3285.20s:  But it's typically higher to lower threes.
3293.92s:  So very interested to see how 25. Do we continue on the growth phase? Or do we start to slow down?
3302.16s:  And I don't know the answer yet. We will soon find out. I presume.
3307.92s:  Tommy says, what about using XOK and CS get more exposure to the tech high flyers? Yeah, that could
3313.44s:  be done for sure. I mean, it's not what I'm doing. The reason why I'm not doing that is because
3319.52s:  I'm still going to maintain the leveraged components. So I'm still going to use T triple Qs and Upro.
3325.76s:  But the tech itself, the tech element of S&P is still the dominant force of it.
3336.48s:  So even though it has other stuff in it, the other stuff is at such low percentages that you're
3340.64s:  still primarily getting tech. Now, Qs is even stronger still as a distribution of the percentage
3348.88s:  of the fund, but it's still heavily, heavily tech for sure. Joseph says, I'm not sure if you
3356.32s:  answered this, but what do you think, but do you think Trump is serious about tariffs? And if you
3361.20s:  would do them, how will affect the market? I do think he's serious as far as I could tell.
3365.44s:  I think that he's not going to be interested in trying to like slap them on all at once because
3370.64s:  that would provide just such an insane shock to things. But I do think that he's serious about it
3376.88s:  because he's trying to use it as a bargaining chip. And the only way that he can use it as a
3380.96s:  bargaining chip is if he's willing to follow through on aspects of it. So I do think he's serious.
3386.88s:  And I think that you'll see a series of effects specifically depending on how they
3396.40s:  are implemented. That's the biggest component of this, how they're actually implemented.
3402.24s:  Because if, for example, like China, if we start really, really aggressive with China,
3410.64s:  that can stir up a pretty big pot of back and forth that will impact a lot of the market, a lot,
3420.24s:  the market. But beyond that, I don't think it's the kind of thing that would be
3429.04s:  slapped on right away. And it's because the amount of impact that that would have,
3435.04s:  I just think Trump is aware of that. And it wouldn't really benefit just about anybody.
3442.08s:  Even the companies, because you have to again, like always put first things first,
3446.40s:  what is Trump trying to do with some of these tariffs? Well, one of the big things he's trying
3450.00s:  to do with the tariffs is move more business to the United States. He's trying to get more of
3456.64s:  our companies to produce domestically. Well, if you throw on massive tariffs all at one super
3463.76s:  fast, you don't actually further that objective. You don't. Because they just start incurring massive
3471.92s:  losses, which I don't think really help to that objective. Now, if he comes in too light,
3480.88s:  meaning not serious enough, well, that's a problem because then they don't take it seriously,
3486.16s:  and they don't really care to move. So that's a separate issue. But I think that, I think that
3493.12s:  issue is a little more navigable personally. Because if you have the tariffs, they know that
3501.12s:  they're going to come, you roll them out slowly. I think it starts to move the behavior in the
3508.88s:  direction that we want. At least in terms of domestic production. And the reason why I say the
3514.72s:  direction that we want is because domestic production helps us quite a lot as a country,
3521.68s:  because we're not stuck in some of the nasty scenarios we found ourselves with
3528.72s:  in terms of external production. You're essentially at somebody else's mercy that you can't control,
3538.16s:  which again is difficult to manage, I think. So it works while things are working and things are
3546.24s:  nice. But if we have stuff that, let's say, for example, from a military perspective,
3554.00s:  and we have a bunch of stuff that we rely on that's produced in China, and then the engagements
3558.80s:  with China start to heat up that just becomes a massive weakness. So it'll be a bit of a balancing
3565.60s:  act. Dan says that's relative to you, CDJ. I didn't see. Okay. CJ says, is 500 shares considered
3576.40s:  a medium size position for when Moas comes? Well, what is that? Yeah. Actually, Dan, what a great
3583.28s:  what a great response. What is that CDJ? What do you mean? Like, what does that mean to you?
3589.44s:  Because exactly as Dan is highlighting, it is a entirely, entirely relevant
3600.96s:  or relative, sorry, not relevant. I'm placing my dinner order in an entirely relative perspective.
3612.56s:  So yeah, really only you can answer that, which actually is the maybe I'll do it on a separate
3618.64s:  live stream or something just to not cross the streams. How do I want to do that? I'll just do a video
3624.88s:  right after this. So I did start a coverage strangle in GameStop. I already had like the existing
3632.48s:  position. So what I did is I use some of my existing position and I ported over like a medium
3638.88s:  level cost basis because I have a much better basis than what I'm going to use. But I want to
3644.08s:  pick something that's more relevant to people. CDJ says, what would you consider a medium size
3649.12s:  position on GME for you? I would say a medium size position would be like 30% of an account,
3658.96s:  30 to 40% of an account. That would be like medium.
3666.32s:  So if you have a million bucks, like three, four hundred thousand dollars, don't like that.
3670.96s:  But yeah.
3676.64s:  The note though on that CDJ, at least my recommendation is don't worry about labels. Don't worry about
3682.40s:  like what medium is or isn't. Don't worry if it's called medium, venti or whatever the other
3688.48s:  term Starbucks uses. Just whatever it is, make it make sense for whatever you think is going to
3694.64s:  happen and whatever you are trying to gain exposure to. That's what matters. It doesn't matter what
3702.64s:  the name is. It matters the size relative to what you're trying to do always.
3709.44s:  So the other quick update for you all, the daily live streams we should be back on a normal schedule,
3716.56s:  we actually might be running out to the desert for a few days. So they might get a little
3720.96s:  screwy for the rest of this week, but next week we should be back on standard fare. And then
3727.36s:  for the Sunday and Wednesday streams, I will do two. The first one will be about a half hour on
3733.84s:  the regular YouTube channel, just updating the market broadly. And then we'll do the pro live streams
3738.96s:  for the second half hour after that to run through more specific stuff. Go through individual
3744.56s:  positions, answer individual questions for people kind of work through more more detailed scenarios.
3751.36s:  That's the idea. It's been a little time getting a bit deeper. And then the other thing I'm going to do
3755.76s:  is soon I'm going to open up a submission for people that are interested in participating for
3763.44s:  the outlier options trading bootcamp. Completely free. And it's a series that I do a couple times
3770.08s:  during the year. So what it is is I work with people on a weekly basis and we essentially make
3781.36s:  videos working through the trading skill set. Now the goal for this is for it to be more at an
3787.44s:  intermediate level. So it's not going to be straight for beginners. It's going to be an
3793.44s:  intermediate level of content. We're not going to go over our options basics. There's actually
3798.16s:  going to be a quiz in order to join the thing. And that's not to be mean or anything. It's so
3805.76s:  that I can just make sure I'm getting in the right level of person so that the content can be what I
3811.36s:  want it to be. So that'll be coming up. But those will be I don't know if they're going to be
3816.96s:  live stream or dropped is recording on Fridays. But until then Fridays will continue to be options
3823.68s:  trading basics. So the schedule is packed as usual. I've also stopped doing the daily market update
3831.44s:  videos because I'm doing them in the live stream. And it just kind of decreases the total number of
3835.92s:  videos that you guys are getting. So it's at least palatable. But I'm still targeting at least
3842.40s:  two podcasts per week. So I have a podcast. They generally drop around Wednesday, but it's kind
3851.52s:  of fluid. It depends on when I record with the person. And then the main channel videos will be out
3861.20s:  on Sundays now instead of Saturdays. So we'll run those on Sundays for a little bit. And then I
3867.20s:  might actually push them to Monday just so that the weekend's a little more open for stuff.
3872.40s:  So we have a ton of content. So you literally will have a live stream pretty much every single day.
3877.68s:  Saturday will still be game stop for now. Sunday's market prep Monday is market recap Tuesday.
3885.04s:  Just kicking it hanging out Wednesday will be like a market update Thursday, trader hanging out,
3890.16s:  kicking it Friday will be options trading for beginners Saturday, game stop. Those are all the
3896.96s:  live streams. And then we'll still have the weekly video come out on Sunday. And then I'll still
3903.20s:  probably drop one to two other videos throughout the week that are just kind of temporally related.
3907.92s:  About stuff. So that's what's coming up. As always, if you guys need anything, let me know.
3918.64s:  I'm here. I'm kicking it. I'm about to rotate over. I'm going to record the video about the game
3923.92s:  stop coverage triangle to introduce that to everybody. So I'm looking forward to running that
3928.08s:  throughout 2025. If you need anything, let your boy know being out there. See you guys later.
