0.80s: how to manage a portfolio do you have a
4.00s: specific process that you follow and if
6.08s: so what is it can you walk somebody
8.32s: through exactly how you manage a
11.36s: portfolio in less than 10 minutes if the
14.60s: answer is no it means that you're
16.32s: missing a lot of important details so
18.88s: the goal of this video is to walk you
20.44s: through how I think about managing a
22.76s: portfolio now right out of the gate my
25.44s: Approach has changed over the years that
27.68s: I've been trading I started trading over
29.96s: 16 years ago now so there are definitely
32.44s: some differences that I do now compared
34.68s: to where I start so the point is is it's
36.28s: an evolving process but I want to walk
38.64s: you through looking back at that
40.32s: experience what's worked well for me and
42.84s: then at the end of the video I want to
44.08s: walk you through exactly how I split out
46.52s: my portfolio and how I like to think
48.96s: about managing my risk what's up
50.36s: everybody Eric here welcome back to all
51.64s: the outliers shout out to the patreon
53.96s: family and the YouTube members with that
56.08s: let's talk about how to manage a
58.24s: portfolio so the very first thing is I
60.92s: really do believe this applies to
62.20s: everybody whether you are a passive
64.16s: investor an active investor there are
66.80s: points that you need to manage a
68.88s: portfolio you have to touch and adjust
71.24s: your portfolio and that's an important
72.88s: point because really the only thing that
75.08s: changes is the frequency and maybe what
77.72s: you track the depth of the information
79.72s: that you collect but overall even if
82.24s: you're a passive investor there's going
83.52s: to be periods of time where you need to
84.72s: rebalance things so regardless of how
89.20s: active you are I think it's important to
91.12s: think about a reasonable time frame for
94.00s: you to manage your portfolio so if
96.04s: you're active it's obviously as active
98.28s: as you like to trade if you're a passive
100.20s: investor once a quarter once every six
102.60s: months once a year something like that
104.52s: is probably completely fine so let's
107.44s: talk about what we should be thinking
109.96s: about to start I am a huge fan of Steven
112.96s: kovi and The Seven Habits of Highly
114.44s: Successful People and one of the things
115.72s: he talks about is begin with the end in
117.40s: mind the reason why I think that's so
119.16s: important is because as we think about
121.84s: how we're going to manage a portfolio
123.88s: what we're trying to accomplish needs to
126.16s: be integrated into those interactions
128.60s: when we're managing a portfolio so what
130.80s: do I mean by that what is the objective
133.80s: of your portfolio are you trying to
135.64s: aggressively grow your account or are
138.36s: you trying to manage income so that you
141.28s: can have a secondary source of income
143.44s: the reason why those two thing matters
144.88s: is depending on which one of those
146.32s: you're focused on the way that you
148.60s: deploy your portfolio is going to vary
150.92s: widely based on that so what I really
154.12s: think is important to do is think about
155.84s: your long-term and short-term objectives
158.00s: and then quantify quantify quantify that
161.36s: that that means if you say I want to
163.44s: grow my account that's not good enough
166.00s: you're missing a ton of fidelity that's
169.24s: going to impact the way that you do
171.00s: everything so if you're a if your goal
174.88s: is to grow your account by 1% per year
178.08s: versus 20% per year year the details
181.92s: that get you there are vastly different
184.84s: and we take a lot of these things for
186.28s: granted so when we're talking about what
188.60s: we're trying to do in the markets
189.88s: whether it's talking about portfolio
191.00s: management or strategies we have a lot
193.76s: of things baked into our thoughts if we
195.68s: say grow the account well really we're
198.24s: inferring all of these other things but
200.40s: you got to get into detail take the time
203.32s: and quantify what you're trying to do I
206.16s: cannot overemphasize how important that
209.00s: is so with those details
213.08s: Quantified here are the guiding
214.88s: principles I think about efficient and
217.32s: detailed the more active you are the
220.48s: more detailed this should be and it's
223.12s: because the Details Matter your number
226.24s: one job as a portfolio manager to lay it
230.40s: out front super simple is manage risk
234.08s: you have to manage risk that is your
235.88s: number one job you cannot make money if
238.44s: there's no money to make money on so
241.48s: whatever you are attempting to do your
244.24s: profits are secondary your return Target
247.56s: is secondary to risk management that has
250.56s: to come number one and it's got to be
252.44s: baked into what you're doing so think
255.08s: about how you want to manage risk and
258.00s: think about how you want to track your
260.12s: risk management throughout the life
262.20s: cycle of your strategies so with that
265.76s: let's think about risk what is your
269.04s: desired risk risk this is the very first
272.20s: stage that I am going to come across
275.00s: every time I engage in portfolio
276.88s: management so what does this actually
279.32s: mean well I'm thinking through based on
282.64s: my analysis of the current market
286.16s: conditions how much risk do I want to
288.40s: have out on my YouTube live session
290.20s: today today's the 13th of March and I am
294.28s: almost 100% utilized 98% utilized and
297.52s: it's because there's a ton of
298.80s: opportunity right now with all the svb
300.60s: bank failures I have a ton of positions
302.20s: expiring today long story short I had a
305.48s: high risk tolerance for today because I
308.04s: saw a tremendous amount of opportunity
310.92s: that might not always be the case and it
312.88s: very frequently isn't if you look at a
314.52s: lot of my live sessions back from um
317.88s: 2022 a lot of my things were 20%
321.92s: utilized 10% utilized I had very low
324.64s: risk tolerance and it's for different
326.56s: reasons sometimes it's because I was
328.20s: ahead of pace and I didn't need have a
330.00s: lot of risk sometimes it's because I
331.72s: didn't see a lot of opportunity and I
333.24s: wasn't looking to force trades the
335.24s: reasons are Limitless but you need to
337.24s: Define this and you can Define this in
340.12s: two ways the very first thing I think
342.20s: about is based on my current standing in
345.08s: terms of my progression towards my endof
347.32s: year goals which I've Quantified so I
350.04s: have an idea of what I need to be at do
353.48s: I need to have more risk on or less risk
356.36s: on and still be on pace so I think about
360.36s: how does my current tracking align with
363.32s: my overall long-term and short-term
365.56s: objectives from there I like to think
368.60s: about and more importantly what is my
371.16s: assessment of the market conditions the
372.92s: reason why this is so important is
374.52s: because let's say I'm trailing behind in
377.84s: terms of My overall portfolio objectives
380.32s: I'm not making enough money I need so
382.00s: far for the year but I really am kind of
386.20s: risk off I My overall market assessment
389.08s: is pretty bearish or negative meaning
391.40s: I'm not sure what I want to put out I
393.20s: don't want to run my short strategies
394.80s: for whatever reason so I might just
397.04s: accept the fact that I could have a
398.80s: period of time where I'm running behind
401.00s: pace and sometimes that is what it is
403.36s: you can't allow it to happen for too
405.00s: long though that's why going through the
406.80s: process of outlining your desired risk
408.92s: is so important because you can say okay
412.84s: maybe this month I'm going to be hands
415.08s: off but then next month if your overall
417.84s: Market disposition hasn't changed but
419.80s: now you're starting to fall behind in
421.56s: terms of your objectives you need to
423.48s: figure out how to interface with the
425.00s: markets meaning you might need to just
426.68s: add some more speculative trades out
428.92s: things like that and I'll walk through
430.12s: how I split out my portfolio in just a
431.76s: few minutes but this idea of
434.64s: understanding your current desired risk
436.16s: is absolutely important so now let's
439.76s: talk about how I break out portfolio
442.96s: management and there's two levels I look
445.96s: at we have the portfolio level and then
449.16s: we have individual trades and strategies
451.84s: so what I mean by this is when I'm
453.24s: looking at my overall portfolio I'm
455.36s: looking at things like beta weighted
457.40s: deltas and does my overall risk align
461.20s: with what I want for my Beta weighted
463.48s: Deltas I also think about things like
466.56s: are any of my current products too
468.92s: correlated so that means if I have a
471.24s: Bank of America trade on and a Wells
473.00s: Fargo trade on at the same time but I'm
475.48s: not super stoked about financials like I
477.60s: am not right now maybe
480.20s: having two of those positions on even if
482.20s: I like them isn't the right answer maybe
484.32s: I need to make a transition on one of
485.96s: those trades so I'm going to look at the
488.08s: overall risk in terms of size that I
490.68s: have out I'm going to look at the
492.40s: correlation between the products to make
494.28s: sure that I'm not becoming too
495.72s: centralized in terms of my risk profile
498.36s: and I'm going to juxtapose all of that
500.24s: against my market hypothesis this is the
502.88s: very first tier that I'm looking at from
505.68s: there I'm going to look at each
507.44s: individual trade so what is the risk in
510.80s: the trade and in terms of my risk
514.12s: metrics have I hit them meaning if I
517.20s: have a mental stop set or if I have a
520.28s: resistance level set for a directional
522.28s: trade that is now becoming violated I
525.96s: need to manage the risk in the trade
527.84s: that's the very first thing that's
529.12s: listed here for trades and it's the very
531.28s: first thing that's listed here for the
532.72s: portfolio and it's for a reason if you
534.60s: recall way back at the beginning of this
536.76s: video your number one job is to manage
539.60s: risk that's why it is front and center I
542.60s: prioritize it and I emphasize it because
545.88s: that is what I need to do first so when
548.52s: I'm looking at individual trades have I
550.96s: met my riskmanagement thresholds which
553.84s: need to be predefined before you enter a
555.72s: trade then I'm going to look at is it
557.56s: time to take profit this is the more fun
559.36s: scenario but maybe I need to just review
562.20s: and say Hey did I hit my Max profit on
564.68s: this short put or did my ratio diagonal
568.00s: hit my profit Target which is um
571.64s: validated by hitting X Point that's
574.08s: predefined before entering the trade
576.20s: those kind of Details Matter quite a bit
579.16s: time I trade options there's a Time
581.92s: component to what I do so is something
585.04s: expiring soon if so is it okay do I want
587.88s: to take it into expiration or do I need
589.56s: to manage it another aspect of time that
592.12s: doesn't just apply to options Traders
594.76s: but if you trade in equity but earnings
596.92s: is coming up and you don't want to be
598.76s: exposed to earnings well there you go
601.48s: you need to do something about it and
603.56s: it's because of an event that's coming
605.32s: up and then the last thing is the thesis
607.44s: review this really ties to time sort of
610.20s: but if I put on a trade with a certain
612.72s: thesis if for example if I wanted to
615.36s: trade XLF like I am right now and my
617.76s: thesis is bearish and I'm looking at my
621.20s: position in XLF and I look at XLF and
623.80s: it's not doing what I thought it was
625.20s: going to do I don't have to wait until
628.16s: my risk metric is hit or until my profit
630.68s: metric is hit if my general hypothesis
634.04s: if my thesis isn't happening that's
637.32s: grounds to manage that position in and
639.68s: of itself so there's a couple other
642.24s: things that I tend to layer into this
643.88s: but I think this is a good overview for
646.16s: most people on how I like to think about
648.88s: portfolio and individual trade
651.56s: management now I want to walk you
653.52s: through how I construct my portfolio and
655.80s: what the implications are I have a core
658.64s: allocation and I have a speculative
661.24s: allocation I purposefully split my
663.72s: portfolio into these two pieces because
666.36s: it gives me a ton of clarity over where
668.44s: I have my money what kind of Trades I'm
670.68s: putting on where and it allows me to you
674.00s: guessed it control my risk so the way I
677.40s: think about my core positions is this is
679.32s: kind of my main bid for Success this is
681.60s: my main effort as we would say in the
683.76s: Marine Corps so when I have my annual
686.88s: return targets which is now around 12%
689.32s: per year it used to be 15 but I'm
691.08s: guiding it down just because of my
692.56s: natural progression I don't have the
694.64s: same return requirements when I'm
697.56s: thinking about getting that 12% per year
699.56s: that 10% per year really 8% per year it
701.96s: could be whatever it is for you 20% per
704.12s: year this is the primary way I'm
706.32s: expecting to do it so I am going to wait
709.32s: the core allocation of my portfolio to
712.00s: give me the highest probability of
713.88s: success to hit that goal this
715.88s: speculative is when I have a hypothesis
718.64s: when there's some something that's
719.72s: playing out that I think there's an
722.04s: opportunity and I want to take advantage
723.84s: of it for example SBB the financial
726.92s: sector right now the overall Market
728.60s: volatility right now it's why I'm so
730.84s: invested as of today is because I am
733.52s: leveraging this speculative allocation
735.56s: of my portfolio significantly and it's
738.32s: because I see a lot of opportunity so
741.00s: how do I break these out well in terms
743.64s: of the overall allocation of the
745.36s: portfolio for the core I allow myself to
748.44s: use up to the entire portfolio on a core
751.68s: position so this is something like a
753.52s: coverage strangle in iwm if for whatever
756.52s: reason I want to have all of my
758.44s: portfolio in that position I'm fine with
760.28s: it that's no problem for me I'm okay
762.24s: with the variance is it exactly what I
763.96s: do probably not I would probably add
766.40s: some sort of inverse related product or
768.60s: something to hedge some of the risk
770.36s: whether it's adding bonds and it's just
771.96s: because there's not a huge reason for me
774.12s: to be 100% invested in my portfolio at
776.44s: this point but back in the day this was
778.56s: common for me speculative this is guided
781.20s: down significantly from what it used to
783.04s: be part of it is because as my accounts
784.84s: grown I have a larger dollar amount to
786.60s: play with so 40% is plenty however if I
789.96s: wasn't in that scenario speculative used
792.48s: to be allowed to be up to 80% of the
795.12s: portfolio and there's times where
797.28s: between core and speculative I was
799.36s: levered meaning over 100% utilized you
802.56s: have to figure out what's right for you
803.84s: based on your objectives but the name of
805.96s: the game here is figuring out what makes
808.16s: sense and what's right for you
810.00s: then what kind of strategies do I run in
812.40s: these different allocations so for the
814.64s: core allocation I typically run things
816.88s: like the coverage triangle ratio
818.96s: diagonals and when I say the coverage
820.56s: triangle it's all the individual
822.12s: components of that as well so it's
823.72s: things like cash secured puts it's
825.48s: things like ratio covered calls things
828.56s: like that and when I look at the
830.32s: speculative allocation it's essentially
832.92s: everything now I typically don't trade
835.40s: the coverage strangle in the speculative
837.84s: that's not a hard and fast rule it's
839.52s: just not my typical go-to and then I
841.88s: have things like straddles strangles
844.04s: long and short single options earnings
846.12s: plays like the event driven play today
849.20s: in svb fomc Meet meetings this is where
852.80s: there's events that I'm trading around
854.84s: and I'll pair it with a strategy So
857.28s: within this allocation that I have for
860.28s: the core and speculative allocation of
862.88s: my portfolios I then suballocate to the
865.72s: individual positions based on how I feel
868.68s: about them how much money I want tied up
870.84s: in each one of the positions and the way
872.88s: that I think about the individual
874.48s: positions is realistically speaking if
877.84s: it's a coverage strangle I allocate more
880.48s: of the portfolio like I said I would do
882.52s: 100% of my portfolio in iwm cover
885.88s: strangle no problem typically speaking
888.44s: though it would be guided down a bit
891.08s: based on where I want the rest of my
892.76s: positions on so for my core allocation
895.36s: let's say I currently have 60% of the
897.72s: portfolio utilized and I have 50% of
900.72s: that tied up in the coverage triangle of
902.96s: that 50% that's tied up it's not all out
905.88s: at a given point in time this is a big
907.68s: part of my scaling protocols which I
909.76s: talk about pretty regularly and it's an
911.20s: important part of what I do so as you
913.20s: can see there's different tiers to all
915.44s: of this Capital Management and scaling
917.40s: and it gives me an immense amount of
919.56s: control over things exactly how in 2022
922.80s: when the market was down
924.48s: 19% I was up 20% it's not because I'm a
928.40s: genius in learned what was going to
930.16s: happen before it was going to do and
931.24s: made some sort of great trades based on
932.88s: it I traded what the market showed me
934.92s: but I have plenty of capital that I can
936.96s: e and flow based on market conditions
940.00s: and another great example is same thing
941.76s: in last year 2022 my IRA account which I
945.36s: only had 32 trades in total was up about
948.84s: 5% didn't trade that much it's based on
951.84s: Capital Management it's based on the way
954.04s: that I think about the risk in the
955.44s: portfolio so that I can e and flow as I
958.00s: see opportunity come and as I see
960.28s: opportunity go so all in all if you do
962.80s: not have a systematic approach to
965.00s: managing your portfolio you're going to
966.96s: be a mess it's going to be impossible
968.60s: for you to track things in depth and
971.52s: then also most importantly validate what
974.44s: you're doing we're thinking about our
976.68s: portfolio management it needs to be a
978.64s: process exactly as I've outlined here
980.88s: I'm going to start with my objective
982.00s: that are Quantified figure out where I'm
983.68s: sitting against those what is my current
986.08s: desired risk based on my portfolio
989.08s: analysis which I've highlighted here
991.20s: pretty cleanly for you current risk
993.16s: desired out current risk that is out
995.44s: what is the correlation of the products
996.76s: is there anything that I need to adjust
998.12s: from a portfolio level and what is my
1000.56s: market hypothesis how does all of this
1002.56s: rack and stack together like subscribe
1004.40s: if there's anything that you want to see
