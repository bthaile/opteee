0.00s:  I believe we're up and well, sorry about that everybody.
4.28s:  I gotta say, the humor in this is so unbelievably massive because right before we started this,
14.32s:  I literally, I literally said the dastardly words to Newton.
18.68s:  I said, this one should be good.
20.96s:  I like, I like went through everything to make sure that this was seamless to get onto.
26.56s:  And now this was probably the latest livestream I've ever started.
30.04s:  So thanks everybody for hanging in there with us.
33.28s:  And Richard, great to see you again.
35.88s:  Thanks for hanging out.
37.56s:  Likewise, it's always fun to talk.
39.36s:  Let me mute this other video here.
41.28s:  I'm just pulling up the chat.
42.48s:  What's up?
43.48s:  What's going on, everybody?
44.48s:  It looks like we have the gang in the house.
49.60s:  And yeah, sorry about that, everybody.
51.20s:  I typically try to make this a little more smooth getting launched, but I, you know,
56.52s:  it got me, it got me good.
58.76s:  So we know what it is for next time.
61.32s:  That's what I'll leave it at.
62.72s:  All right, so a couple of things we have to talk about.
67.00s:  I figure we can start really quick with any new Pokemon cards that you want to share with us,
74.20s:  any new polls that we like.
76.28s:  Oh, you know what, I didn't come ready for that, but I, I did get this box here.
81.36s:  I'll show you guys.
87.52s:  Got a box of Paldae evolves from GameStop.
91.20s:  This is it.
93.40s:  It looked like emojis.
95.40s:  It kind of do.
97.12s:  So my idea was, you know, there's no way I'm going to collect all the Pokemon that's literally impossible.
101.92s:  That's why I limited it to Pikachu's and EV's.
104.40s:  How many are there now?
105.84s:  Like a thousand.
107.16s:  Oh, yeah.
109.12s:  And then, but I wanted to collect a elite trainer box from each box in the current life.
116.48s:  Like rotation, which is Scarlet and Violet.
120.28s:  So we're working on that kind of fun.
122.20s:  Yeah, that's awesome.
123.68s:  So when you're opening these with your daughter, does she have a preference for like all
129.92s:  graphics, non holographics, like what kind of stuff does she like to see in the cards?
132.84s:  I know that you said that you guys both like EV, but is there anything beyond that?
137.08s:  She's really looking for like a secret rare, a double secret rare.
140.72s:  I don't know all the rarities, you know, but like a V or a V star or something really exciting.
146.28s:  So she'll come running up to have we got a good one today because typically the thing is
150.40s:  is around six or seven we play and then post playing then we can open one pack.
157.04s:  Got it.
158.04s:  Okay.
159.04s:  So that's like, that's a big event.
160.04s:  Yeah.
161.04s:  So, you know, sometimes we get a hit.
163.08s:  Sometimes you get to Max Payne, you get a Charmander, you know?
167.40s:  That's perfect.
168.40s:  Yeah.
169.40s:  Well, a little bit of old Max Payne, eh?
173.00s:  Did you make of the glorious clothes on Friday?
178.08s:  You know, having experiences for so many years, this is why I said the May 3rd cycle was so important.
185.96s:  The cycle hit on a Friday that never happens, right?
189.56s:  So the eternity that goes from a Wednesday into a Friday or from even a Thursday into
195.56s:  a Friday is enough time for the stock to get back to Max Payne.
199.88s:  So I think that's why we saw everything we saw.
202.12s:  If you go back to May 3rd, stock ran up like crazy that day on 36 million volume and
207.48s:  that was a Friday that never happens.
209.48s:  So we saw action happen on a Wednesday and then the duration between Wednesday and Friday
214.64s:  all the way back to Max Payne.
216.44s:  So yeah.
217.44s:  Yeah.
218.44s:  Yeah.
219.44s:  I got to say, especially for also quick note, shout out to Roaring Titty.
223.72s:  I think it's like my favorite name that I ever see in the chat.
226.40s:  I always look for Roaring Titty because what a fantastic handle that is.
233.08s:  Yeah.
234.08s:  It's the movement this past week was really interesting and I actually made a standalone
240.08s:  video about Max Payne because as you know from our conversations, I approach most things
247.68s:  as a skeptic, right?
248.88s:  I want to make sure that there's data and I want to make sure that there's some sort
253.08s:  of support for the thesis and for especially for what we saw on Friday.
261.76s:  That is now there's one specific thing I'm looking for.
265.96s:  What I saw on Friday is very interesting to start with in terms of how price moved and
270.96s:  where it landed, very interesting.
272.76s:  And when I say interesting, that's me kindly saying I think there was very clear manipulation.
278.64s:  That's what I think.
279.64s:  It's in a complete opinion.
281.40s:  Actually.
286.40s:  There we go.
288.40s:  I had to go run and go grab my hat.
291.92s:  But I definitely think that there was manipulation on Friday.
295.88s:  Now that I got the hat on, I can speak plainly.
298.52s:  And one of the things that I think about is the overall instances that this occurs
308.00s:  into what degree.
310.00s:  So I'm in the process of running a study on that now.
314.04s:  And the video that I shared, it shared a couple of papers that I kind of referenced on
318.60s:  stuff like SSRN and whatnot.
321.00s:  Bell people become a little more familiar with the topic because it still stands for something
325.64s:  like Max Payne.
326.80s:  You can't move something super far.
328.96s:  It's like the market makers just they don't have that leeway with their book.
335.04s:  But something where Max Payne's at 25 and it ends at 24.97.
338.44s:  Can they move it three cents?
340.44s:  Yeah, bully.
341.44s:  Absolutely.
342.44s:  You don't believe they can move it three dollars.
346.04s:  It's 10s, three dollars.
347.96s:  If it's at 30 bucks for them to move, it's a 10% move.
353.00s:  Now I wouldn't put it outside the realm of possibility, especially if it lines up really
359.52s:  well.
360.52s:  But I also don't personally think it's quite as simple as people maybe think it is because
368.08s:  they're fighting order flow.
369.92s:  So for example, if Max Payne is down at 25 or whatever and it's up at 30.
375.72s:  For them to move it down the, you know, in that case, five bucks.
378.56s:  So maybe we'll do 27.
380.20s:  In that case for them to move it down three bucks, they need specific market conditions
384.88s:  to allow them to be able to do that.
387.36s:  Because for example, if there's a lot of people buying options, there's not an opportunity
392.32s:  for them to essentially move things south.
395.72s:  They would have to be buying shares in order to hedge the positions that are coming in.
400.48s:  So it creates a natural conflict for their ability to move price down that far.
404.76s:  Now if we're talking about a scenario kind of like this past week where there's broad
409.94s:  weakness, there's a lot of selling.
412.20s:  The options, chains are slowing down a lot towards the end of the week.
416.52s:  Could they move it more than three cents?
418.52s:  Yeah, I absolutely think so.
420.52s:  To what degree can they move it?
422.12s:  I genuinely don't know the answer to that.
424.72s:  It wouldn't put it, like I wouldn't put it past that 10% move in a lower flow product
428.48s:  like this.
429.48s:  That's not, that's not crazy.
430.72s:  Like if somebody said, I think they moved it three bucks, I wouldn't be like, there's
434.16s:  no way, not at all.
436.28s:  Now if somebody says, well, we were up at 35 and they put it down to 25, then I would
443.16s:  probably say in my opinion, there's probably more forces at play than just that.
448.28s:  Could it still be a contributing factor in that kind of scenario?
451.04s:  I think so.
452.28s:  But would it be the dominant move for something moving, you know, again, from 35 down to 25,
458.00s:  probably not?
459.00s:  I agree with what you're saying in a sense because we've seen historic Adobe days where
464.04s:  days or weeks where games stop just tracks the spine.
466.72s:  Right?
467.72s:  The spine moves up on a wave formation, 1%, 2%, GameStop does 3, 4, 5% in the exact same
474.52s:  wave formation or kind of downward as well.
477.52s:  So we've long seen that correlation.
479.32s:  So with a broad market sell off like we saw over the last three days, GameStop just like,
484.80s:  it was interesting though.
485.80s:  The first day GameStop didn't move it strongly.
488.12s:  I would say as buy or the VTI told market index, but then it was day two that like GameStop
497.12s:  went down with like 8%, broader market sold off and GameStop went down like hard, right?
503.20s:  So but I don't know.
504.20s:  I'm going to diverge from your opinion though.
507.00s:  I'm going to say I think they have much more control over overflow because they can
512.56s:  route off exchange.
513.56s:  Right away, if you're routing any buys off exchange and it's just all downward pressure,
518.04s:  then you could sink this thing really fast.
520.68s:  It's going to cost them right in the long term.
522.20s:  They're going to go to they're going to be internalizing and have to buy back later.
525.72s:  So could we see upwards move next week, right?
529.76s:  From them having to pick up shares like maybe they paid the piper, they paid the piper
533.12s:  next week to save some money on premium this week or make some money on premium I suppose.
539.12s:  And then they can use ETFs right?
540.44s:  So I know I think ETFs is huge behind all things.
542.92s:  So there was huge creation and redemption of ETFs going on all week.
547.32s:  And the last couple of weeks.
548.80s:  So I feel like that gives them a lot of capacity in the short term.
551.72s:  But I'm going to feel like the price.
554.16s:  Yeah, I agree with you.
557.08s:  I think this study is a must read for people on the concept of Max Payne.
562.84s:  It specifically looks at stuff like this and to your point, it's funny enough.
567.12s:  The exact thing that you're highlighting in terms of the movement the next week, the
574.12s:  following week is well documented.
577.48s:  It says we find these returns reverse after the options expiration week.
582.32s:  So that's that's one of the cool things I really love talking about you and with you
587.80s:  about because you're you pick up on a lot of these trends and sometimes like I don't
593.32s:  know if you've seen the study.
594.24s:  I might my guess is you might know.
595.96s:  So maybe naively kind of just but from one stock.
600.16s:  But from but from your observations, you're picking up like really interesting factors that
606.08s:  are absolutely there.
607.88s:  So I actually fully agree with that that sentiment.
612.28s:  I think the the part that we probably just diverge in is likely the impact of incoming
619.64s:  order flows impact on the ability to do so because even the scenario that you outline
625.00s:  there, I actually still fully agree with you provided that there's not some sort of counter
629.64s:  order flow that slows them down.
632.08s:  But yeah.
633.08s:  Well, I mean, and to mention there was huge sell off of calls, right?
637.40s:  On especially Wednesday.
640.12s:  So if you people holding options, I'm assuming I've never done it, but you could tell me,
646.48s:  you're probably going to be monitoring those positions, have stop losses in place.
650.56s:  You're going to be really, especially if you're holding into expiry, which I don't think
654.80s:  you typically do.
657.32s:  So we're going to see big movement on the stock into such a big expiry like this naturally
662.28s:  if things start to sell off.
664.40s:  And they did.
665.40s:  There was a big sell off on GameStop and Broadly.
667.24s:  So for people to not expect the price to go down with these conditions, I think, you
672.44s:  know, it's not all manipulation.
673.84s:  There's selling going on here.
676.52s:  Yeah.
677.52s:  And that curiosity to follow up on your comment regarding the correlation.
681.68s:  I grabbed this chart kind of messy, but it lets me look at the correlation of the product
687.68s:  across different time frames, just for conversations standpoint.
692.88s:  So right now I'm comparing it to the spy.
695.68s:  And a three day correlation is like 98% five day, 88% 10 day, 56% 30 day negative 32%
707.52s:  and so on.
708.52s:  So it's kind of a bit of a shock on blast.
709.52s:  The other one I wanted to compare it against that curiosity was IWM.
713.24s:  That's a good one.
714.24s:  Yeah.
715.24s:  Yeah.
716.24s:  I can see that.
717.24s:  Yeah.
718.24s:  No doubt.
719.24s:  It's interesting because GameStop's always had a negative beta.
722.88s:  I don't know if you know about that.
723.92s:  So it inverts the market pretty consistently, but there's a lot of days where people were
728.80s:  like, yeah, we're just tracking the spy.
730.88s:  I don't know if it's still interesting.
732.28s:  Yeah.
733.28s:  Can you get a beta?
734.28s:  This shows the fast beta to 11, but this is kind of like a moving average on the beta.
740.00s:  So this is saying what it's behaving recently.
742.56s:  So cheerfully.
743.56s:  That was two years ago.
744.56s:  I don't know if it still does on, I guess, to do like a slower beta longer form.
750.00s:  Yeah.
751.00s:  The other thing I want to show you, this doesn't really show us too much.
757.28s:  I'm in the process of building like a broader data set that's looking at the daily
762.52s:  percent returns.
764.12s:  And I'm taking it.
765.12s:  I'm going to take it back the kind of before we had the original squeeze, which is in
772.28s:  what 21?
774.88s:  And I'm kind of creating a data set that lets me look at when we start to have larger daily
781.60s:  returns, what are the corresponding conditions around it in terms of some other indicators
787.24s:  that I tend to look at?
789.44s:  But from a statistics perspective, which I'm always happy to share with people because
794.28s:  whenever I try to talk to my dog about it, he doesn't listen.
797.24s:  And there's massive clustering that happens at periods of times.
802.64s:  And that's interesting, the fact that it clusters like this.
806.08s:  So this is something that's very much in its infancy, but there are some really interesting
812.40s:  trends that I find here, even these random offshoots that are popping up like this.
819.20s:  So I don't know if that's something that you've spent a lot of time looking at.
822.84s:  I know that a big focus is on the big moves, obviously.
827.48s:  But part of me is curious about the frequency and the severity of the smaller, quote unquote,
835.68s:  big moves, because these are still big moves relative to the periods.
839.92s:  Do those are those like part of your tracking process?
842.16s:  Are you mostly looking for the really big?
844.56s:  Yeah, and I was thinking I was trying to think of even a better way to do it because
847.68s:  I've got the gaps or indicated on there.
850.20s:  But maybe looking at something like previous day, close to the next day's higher low,
857.20s:  something like that, because I want to, because you've seen with GameStop, it doesn't.
860.96s:  I wish I'd after hours extended market highs and lows too, because we've seen now how
865.52s:  much it could move in the extended market.
868.52s:  But tracking those big moves, like you said, I think it could tell you, I don't know,
874.16s:  just periods, periods where to look.
876.84s:  I'm curious, can you pull that chart up again?
878.28s:  I just want to look at something really cool.
879.80s:  I'm actually in the process of downloading the extended hours data for you, because I
883.48s:  have it.
884.48s:  Oh, that'd be great.
885.48s:  Yeah.
886.48s:  On that chart, it's kind of showing a lot of activity happening.
889.52s:  Do you want to pull that other one up again that when you had on, hang on.
894.12s:  Yeah, sorry.
895.12s:  You're good.
896.12s:  What was I showing you a different?
898.12s:  Oh, the price chart.
899.12s:  Like a volatility chart, essentially.
901.12s:  Yeah.
902.12s:  Sorry.
903.12s:  Because I think some of that's explainable.
906.60s:  Yeah, so that's like basically 2009, 2010, right?
911.56s:  Is when it's having kind of that blip up there in the middle, it looks like there's a
915.88s:  lot more activity in the other.
917.60s:  Yeah.
918.60s:  Yep.
919.60s:  Yep.
920.60s:  This section.
921.60s:  Yeah, that would have been coming off of the companies doing really well right there.
925.40s:  Like real, this is post console cycle with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
931.64s:  They were released in 2006.
934.00s:  And the company's just kind of going bang gangbusters has its best year in 2010.
940.00s:  So it's on like an uprun going into that.
943.44s:  So coming off of like a pretty decent low.
946.48s:  And then so really every console cycle is a big deal for GameStop.
951.04s:  So you can see like right in the middle there, like right in the middle there.
955.48s:  The next console cycle is 2013.
959.12s:  So you're going to probably see some pickup and volatility between 2013 to 2015 as they
965.56s:  realize those are next big batch of good years because their cash flow picks up so substantially
971.16s:  with the consoles.
973.36s:  And then it's just the next console cycle was 2020.
978.80s:  So cash flow again picks up again.
980.88s:  So it's very cyclical long, long.
982.60s:  How has it behaved with the console cycles moving forward?
986.44s:  Is it still just people are buying it through the store?
991.60s:  And then, um, and then like they go pick it up.
995.68s:  I'm curious if like with the people just buying consoles directly from wherever the manufacturer's
1000.68s:  and shipping it to them.
1001.88s:  Is that green them or is it still?
1004.80s:  We're seeing hardware is a growing portion of their cattle or their sales.
1011.00s:  It's up to 57%.
1012.00s:  Would you guess that?
1015.52s:  It just keeps going up hardware just keeps going up year after year after year.
1018.84s:  Let me go back historically so you can see just how low it really was back in the day.
1023.36s:  And hardware, hardware was only eight.
1026.56s:  Hardware was only 18% back in the day.
1031.44s:  So even as low as 15%.
1034.20s:  So to go all the way up to 57, um, they're selling the consoles themselves, but a lot of peripherals.
1041.80s:  I think there's like peripherals now for consoles in their ever worse.
1044.44s:  So controllers, sensors, um, cords, all kinds of stuff.
1053.48s:  And why what's the like what's the driving function there?
1057.88s:  Why do people procure it that way as compared to, you know, just going and grabbing it from Amazon or something else?
1067.96s:  I don't know what does chat think about that?
1069.76s:  Like, um, I don't own a console.
1072.76s:  So I can't say, but I mean, they did pick up what was it here?
1080.20s:  Um, by my trot.
1084.84s:  No, that was self unrefurbishing trying to figure out what it was that they picked up.
1090.16s:  But their whole thing where they're refurbishing because they do a lot of inhouse refurbishing.
1094.12s:  Like this mouse I'm using is a refurbished mouse from GameStop.
1097.40s:  So they never did that in the past.
1099.20s:  So you can go into GameStop and you can get a lot of stuff that's like cheap computer peripherals, um, and system peripherals.
1108.32s:  So I don't know what the draw is to go to GameStop.
1110.68s:  Maybe it's just close by so people just go, they need a controller.
1113.88s:  They don't want to wait.
1114.72s:  Just drive over to GameStop, pick it up.
1117.44s:  It's sick.
1118.44s:  I love this.
1118.96s:  I mean, it's way up though.
1120.00s:  15% for hardware and accessories.
1123.00s:  15% to 57% over a decade is crazy.
1128.56s:  Game sales are way down.
1129.64s:  Game sales were like 60% and they're down to 27.
1134.76s:  Interesting.
1139.60s:  So that was that was roaring kiddies.
1142.88s:  These are number one, by the way, it was with a console cycle approaching.
1147.28s:  What he typically saw in their balance sheets was cash flow positivity for several several years off of the
1152.96s:  console cycle.
1154.92s:  And then so he was like, yeah, it's in a real low right now, but they could pay off all their, their senior notes right away by getting all this cash from selling all this hardware, which is exactly what they did.
1164.68s:  They can repaid all the senior notes through the end of 2020 and early 21 really helped out their balance sheet.
1170.36s:  The share offerings obviously helped a lot too.
1172.68s:  So we've got another console cycle coming up here in probably, I think the next Nintendo switch is coming out next year.
1181.40s:  And then follow pieces.
1183.56s:  What's up?
1184.56s:  Are those like big releases?
1186.52s:  The Nintendo switch.
1187.96s:  So the we was not that great.
1189.72s:  We was not that great, but the switch did really well for I'd say for everybody, especially the game stuff.
1194.96s:  But because Nintendo is big on physical game sales as opposed to the other ones, they do digital downloads too.
1203.92s:  But I think the switch was just a long lasting, very successful system.
1210.12s:  I think switch to is going to be highly anticipated.
1213.84s:  The Wii U flopped because I think the name wasn't well understood, but it was a whole successor system.
1219.28s:  So people will be like, I love my switch.
1221.12s:  I want the switch to I think it could do really well.
1223.60s:  And it's coming mid phase.
1225.76s:  So rather than sinking up with the other side with the other consoles, the other consoles will be a while.
1231.16s:  So I think it could be a big release, honestly.
1233.88s:  And then the next PlayStation and Xbox will probably be 2027.
1238.88s:  So we're two or three years out, which is kind of like exactly where roaring kitty bot in like 18 months out from the console cycles.
1248.96s:  So we're early compared to when he bought in.
1252.48s:  Got it.
1253.32s:  So something to think about though with three upcoming over the next couple of years here consoles, that's the cash flow for game stop.
1263.24s:  Got it.
1263.80s:  And there's a question from recent chat.
1266.56s:  They're saying, do you think our case shares have been delivered yet?
1273.04s:  I think that they've been delivered by the market maker through ETFs.
1279.00s:  I think now the authorized participants are in a period where they're going to create some units of whatever their ETF is.
1286.00s:  I WM you mentioned maybe VTI.
1289.04s:  And they're going to look for an opportunity to pick up some shares.
1292.40s:  I think we might have seen a bit of that over the last with those sandworm kind of lips.
1297.40s:  Yeah, coming in early in the morning.
1299.76s:  But I think that they're going to run up against the time crunch.
1302.40s:  I think they do have a time limit on when the farthest they can push it out to it.
1306.40s:  So I think it's in a settlement cycle right now.
1309.96s:  It's just longer than people think because as soon as one participant passes it to another, they get a little bit more time.
1317.60s:  Got it.
1318.84s:  I think they could even push it again too.
1320.84s:  Like if they go out and put if APs go up in large demand by orders on the market, other APs could swoop it up.
1327.84s:  You know, take that order and then shuffle it into another creation cycle on another batch of ETFs.
1333.56s:  I think we've seen that with SRT where it bounces from XRT over to IWM back to XRT.
1339.44s:  So I think a shuffling of this size of position could take a while to settle out.
1343.84s:  Got it. That makes sense.
1346.84s:  I wanted to pivot to another question that I had for you.
1350.84s:  As you know, a big part of what I'm trying to do here is learn.
1354.84s:  I'm trying to learn more about the context.
1356.84s:  I'm trying to learn more about the company, the story and the community.
1360.84s:  And you're kind of like, I view you as like the historian.
1364.84s:  You're kind of like, who are the, I feel like there was a, there's an actual AP historian just so you know, so I want to take his title.
1372.84s:  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
1374.84s:  Maybe like a scribe then. Would that be a fair?
1377.84s:  There we go. The spread cheater is a game stop spread cheater.
1380.84s:  Yeah. Okay.
1381.84s:  So yeah, it's kind of like a scribe function or reminds me of like the,
1386.84s:  the priests way back in the day that used to like transcribe things.
1391.84s:  And then my descendants, mostly the Vikings would like come and you know, just pillage everything.
1397.84s:  That's, you know, I hope, I hope to redeem us.
1400.84s:  I hope to have a different interaction here.
1403.84s:  So with that though, I've been seeing a lot of people having,
1409.84s:  thank you very much.
1412.84s:  Got a filter water reload man.
1414.84s:  You know how to stay hydrated.
1417.84s:  It's, it's funny too, because this is like, this is the time of day that I consume the most food and liquid.
1426.84s:  So yeah, it goes like that.
1428.84s:  But I see a lot of people talking about Moas, right?
1432.84s:  Obviously, that's the, that's the big thing is Moas and where is it going?
1437.84s:  And like I try to understand how people think about it and how people frame it.
1446.84s:  Because for me, like, my, I'm a trader.
1449.84s:  My job is to try and identify perspective moves and then to trade them as best as I possibly can.
1457.84s:  And I've used recent examples, even of some of the things I've been doing in GameStop specifically with respect to like this recent price movement.
1466.84s:  I know for a lot of people, this has been like broadly unexciting.
1470.84s:  But for somebody like me, I'm looking at something that's moved 20%.
1475.84s:  Yeah.
1476.84s:  And that's a move that I played.
1478.84s:  I actually flattened a lot of my options here on the 17th.
1482.84s:  I still have the shares and I've already kind of told people my, my, what, the, I call them participation shares.
1489.84s:  I think I've told you this before.
1491.84s:  I have like a position on also in AMC.
1494.84s:  It's not that I know anything about it.
1496.84s:  It's because I made a bet with somebody on a live stream like two years ago that I would just always hold the position.
1503.84s:  So now I'm literally going to have AMC in my portfolio until I die.
1506.84s:  And it's kind of like what I'm doing with with GameStop, at least part of the shares.
1511.84s:  Is it's just to be involved and try to show some solidarity for the movement.
1516.84s:  But anyways, the options is completely different.
1519.84s:  I'm trading in and out of these things.
1520.84s:  I'm trying to make money here.
1521.84s:  So going all the way back to the MoAS concept.
1525.84s:  Where do people come up with their ideas of like what that number is?
1531.84s:  And how do people expect to behave around it?
1534.84s:  Because there's a lot of people that go through like these really big rides.
1537.84s:  And then they come back down, go through another ride, come back down, that kind of thing.
1541.84s:  Right.
1542.84s:  I would say maybe one of the biggest things that sticks out in people's mind is probably Thomas Petterfees interview when he was on CNBC.
1548.84s:  I believe.
1549.84s:  And he talked about what happened with GameStop.
1551.84s:  And I'm sure you've watched that clip.
1553.84s:  And he's basically saying there were more calls in the money that existed in the outstanding of GameStop and had those been exercised.
1560.84s:  And demand for shares that actually come in.
1563.84s:  The market makers would have had to deliver those shares by the by the nature of the rules.
1567.84s:  And would have broke the whole system because the market makers would have pushed that to the clearing corporation, the clearing corporation would have not been able to handle that trade.
1576.84s:  And basically everyone's margin accounts would have been blown up.
1580.84s:  Everything would have been liquidated.
1582.84s:  And it's right there.
1583.84s:  And yes, and it would have collapsed the whole system because they're, you know, just.
1589.84s:  The system was not designed for this kind of a trade imbalance essentially to occur.
1596.84s:  And the, what was the VIX effect?
1600.84s:  And the VIX went crazy.
1602.84s:  Brought or market really was shaky.
1605.84s:  I remember like kind of everything was was dipping.
1608.84s:  The theory was lots of collateral was being sold off.
1614.84s:  So when was 2021.
1617.84s:  So they move on the VIX.
1620.84s:  I think the overall indices kind of kind of tumbled a bit.
1625.84s:  And then this the events happen in March, right where we saw.
1629.84s:  GameStop shoot up to 350.
1631.84s:  Looked crazy as it did it was doing that fluttering thing that we talk about where it's just.
1636.84s:  Yeah, like crazy when well beyond gamma maximum right entire change in the money again.
1642.84s:  And everyone's like something's going on here.
1644.84s:  And I think that they're they're just like the story to them is incomplete because the buy button got turned off.
1649.84s:  They basically see all of this is like it was basically put on hold.
1654.84s:  So they could figure out how to handle this trade.
1656.84s:  And it's been kind of all kicked into derivatives.
1659.84s:  And you know, if the theory is true and credits was collapsed because of this trade.
1663.84s:  And UBS is attempting now to continue to manage it.
1666.84s:  Then they're like, well, what happens if UBS blows up, right?
1669.84s:  What if they can't contain the trade then who's who's next up above them?
1673.84s:  And it would be the Swiss Central Bank, right?
1677.84s:  And then the European Central Bank and then the DTC and the Fed.
1682.84s:  Right.
1683.84s:  I think what people got to understand is each of those is a much bigger enemy with a lot more capacity to manage a trade of the size.
1691.84s:  Deep way deeper, Martin margin.
1694.84s:  And I think that's what counts and facilities and the rules have changed.
1698.84s:  There's been a lot of rule making to go on to I'm not anti MOS.
1702.84s:  I just don't know how much liquidity can come through the system.
1707.84s:  And I know that they don't like to lose, you know.
1711.84s:  So.
1712.84s:  I don't know they kicked the can hard here for a year and a half.
1715.84s:  And then it's suddenly the can is shown up again really strongly.
1720.84s:  So, you know, they're not they're not impervious in the position can be held forever.
1727.84s:  So I think that's the history behind the most sense.
1730.84s:  Is that does that kind of make sense? I don't know if people agree.
1734.84s:  It does to a degree. So the other thing while I would say is from the chat perspective, what do you guys think?
1740.84s:  And then I got to let my pup in real fast.
1747.84s:  He does this thing where he literally just sits at the door and scratches it one one thing at a time.
1752.84s:  Super cadence slow, but just one at a time.
1757.84s:  Very patient.
1759.84s:  And now now he's happy.
1762.84s:  Oh, there he is.
1764.84s:  He's down to be he's down to be with the boys and girls talking about some game stop.
1768.84s:  He's like a big champion. He has a mohawk.
1772.84s:  Like it alone.
1774.84s:  So I think a big part of it is is going to be whatever people are in it for and what they want out of it.
1780.84s:  Right. So for some people, Thomas pedophysed he was going into the thousands.
1785.84s:  Right. So they're waiting for that four digit number. Like you can kind of see.
1789.84s:  Now that's free.
1792.84s:  Three ATM, right?
1794.84s:  Yeah. So that would have been in today's dollars.
1798.84s:  After a four to one split and some offerings, you know, like two three hundred dollars a share would make it to a thousand free split.
1808.84s:  Got it. We were on our way. I mean, it went to eight like in what three days.
1814.84s:  In early May, mid May.
1817.84s:  80s almost there.
1821.84s:  So, and I think a lot of people are basing about Volkswagen too. So Volkswagen became the highest market cap company briefly in the world in 2008 when Porsche did like essentially like a hostile take over via options actually is super interesting options and shares.
1836.84s:  And ended up controlling most of the company in shorts brand for the exits. The port's leadership actually made a deal with the shorts. I don't know if you know the history on all this.
1846.84s:  Like basically made a deal. Porsche made all like bandits on the whole thing.
1851.84s:  But it went up into the thousands. So I think people are basing it off of, you know, a combination of expectations from 2021.
1860.84s:  Seeing previous squeezes and what they can do.
1865.84s:  And then kind of frustration to I think a lot of it is like they deserve to pay. They cheated.
1872.84s:  So, looking at it realistically.
1878.84s:  In 21, they turned off the buy button because they said this is going to destroy potentially a significant part of the financial system.
1889.84s:  So where would they let.
1893.84s:  Where would they let it go before that kind of thing happen again? Would you guess?
1898.84s:  I think it seems like the probability of it getting up to a thousand based on what happened previously is low based on what they've done.
1906.84s:  Yeah. So that's I think they.
1909.84s:  They short up the rules so that all the market participants have to have much more margin. So that's that's one right. So it can actually go higher now.
1917.84s:  With the system.
1919.84s:  And it's because people have the capacity to pay. I think we've seen that over the last couple of weeks and months is it goes up to 80.
1926.84s:  The VIX didn't really seem to respond. I was surprised by that.
1929.84s:  Went up to 47 again and then 67.
1932.84s:  And overall the other market aside from the basket moving. Right. We saw cost move. We saw.
1938.84s:  Chewie and AMC move that behavior still happens. But the broader market. Well, Berkshire did its virtue.
1945.84s:  Had its weird glitch.
1947.84s:  Glitched out fell down to $185 and bounced up to almost 800,000.
1951.84s:  And then I don't know if you know the volume on Berkshire has been weird ever since.
1955.84s:  Artego's collapsed. So Artego's collapsed. Berkshire a volume went really crazy.
1960.84s:  And it's been crazy ever since.
1963.84s:  Roaring kiddies live stream. And then the.
1966.84s:  And then the other.
1969.84s:  And then the other.
1971.84s:  And then the other.
1972.84s:  Went back down. So outside of those anomalous things, the broader market doesn't seem to care about game stop this much anymore and have as much turbulence.
1978.84s:  So maybe they're rulemaking.
1980.84s:  And their expectations on participants that are involved in game stop.
1985.84s:  Has insulated.
1987.84s:  Maybe the NCC.
1989.84s:  And the bigger part of the system from.
1992.84s:  The troubles that some some of their subsidiaries are having.
1995.84s:  And maybe they need a time time to allow those people to build up a cushion.
1999.84s:  To handle a trade coming in.
2002.84s:  That's actually pretty cool though with some of the changes in the policy though that.
2008.84s:  Essentially it allows them to experience more pain as they should that's.
2013.84s:  That's one of the fun part about this whole thing that we were talking about is.
2016.84s:  It's kind of really nice to have a.
2020.84s:  Just really, really easy to hate common enemy.
2025.84s:  It's always fun to have that.
2027.84s:  And I think that this is a pretty good example of that.
2030.84s:  So that's really helpful.
2032.84s:  And it makes a lot of sense to me to be honest now hearing that context.
2036.84s:  So thank you very much.
2038.84s:  Or explaining some of that because.
2041.84s:  One of the things that I've thought about before is like I see people throw numbers out like you know a game stop to 10,000.
2049.84s:  And I think it you know it's just like, man, it just feels like.
2053.84s:  The probability of that happening in a way that somebody could capture profit on that would be low.
2059.84s:  But I understand at least better now how people might be thinking about it.
2062.84s:  So thank you.
2063.84s:  No problem.
2064.84s:  Something to think about my brother has this concept of like relative market cap.
2068.84s:  So what's the market cap of the biggest company right now in the world?
2071.84s:  It's like in video or.
2073.84s:  I think it is.
2074.84s:  So one of those two are Saudi or Amco right so it's like three it's like 3.5 trail right.
2080.84s:  I think that they're like at four.
2084.84s:  Let me see.
2086.84s:  I'm curious.
2089.84s:  So remember that.
2090.84s:  Yeah, yeah.
2091.84s:  When this whole thing started when game stopped started three years ago it was like 1.5 or two.
2097.84s:  So these companies are growing and getting huge.
2101.84s:  So let's say it's 3.5 trail right.
2103.84s:  Divide that out by a game stops outstanding shares.
2106.84s:  If games stop where to become the biggest company by market cap briefly in the market like like Volkswagen did with a squeeze.
2114.84s:  You're looking at 8,000 dollars a share 8,215 dollars a share.
2119.84s:  So that would be like the brief peak right where those top trades would come in because the idea is.
2126.84s:  Again, going to the petrify when the computer systems take over and they say these.
2131.84s:  These positions must be closed.
2134.84s:  Like we see with that fluttering that happens in the pre market of 80.
2137.84s:  It's completely price insensitive.
2139.84s:  It's just buying because the accounts been liquidated.
2143.84s:  So you know it's not to say that 8 trail or 3.5 trillion is going to change hands.
2148.84s:  It's just that if the shorts must be purchased.
2151.84s:  It's going to pay what they're going to pay.
2153.84s:  I think that's why people are saying maybe the 8 to 10,000 range.
2156.84s:  I see.
2158.84s:  It could be a peak.
2159.84s:  It couldn't sustain right it would immediately get hit with not just I think people need to understand to it wouldn't just get hit with people selling and out of their accounts it would get hit with short selling like crazy.
2171.84s:  You know people are going to enter puts shorts everything's going to pile in and that's something that people maybe need to think about now like.
2180.84s:  Going to going to Wednesday right.
2183.84s:  Imagine a lot of short interest probably piled in on game stop puts and shorts hitting it hard at 29 when they saw it start to falter and waiver.
2192.84s:  You know and then they just now they made a quick 16% on the trade trading it to the downside.
2197.84s:  So it doesn't have to be people paper handing or selling it could just be big sell action.
2203.84s:  Right right. Yeah kind of trading both sides.
2206.84s:  Yeah one of the one of the other questions that I saw come through.
2210.84s:  I think this is from someone esoteric was their name and they're saying do you think that roaring kitty is potentially trying to build like a like essentially a case like evidence.
2224.84s:  That there's some sort of corruption or collusion going on in the back end do you think he's working that angle at all or do you think he's kind of just focusing on trading what he can see.
2237.84s:  I think that I mean he was put under incredible scrutiny for yeah a household trader granted he was YouTube and he was meaming he was doing a lot I mean you really was he had a reddit account.
2249.84s:  Twitter account he was sitting it from three angles making the best trades ever and doing entertaining content.
2257.84s:  But to drag him into Congress and blame him when his YouTube channel his livestreams have less people on them we have on now right.
2264.84s:  Yeah his his early ones were were pretty light also shout out to you guys by the way.
2271.84s:  And so you know he got investigated and his previous employer got fine right mass mutual.
2279.84s:  And I think if he's building a case I don't know that the case is about market manipulation and games not specifically but definitely about protecting his his self himself right which is he revealed his position and then just held it through crazy volatility could have been work 900 million dollars did a livestream stock on hammer off of his lives.
2300.84s:  And he's proving that everything he's doing affects the stock negatively you know he's not doing a pump and dump and in fact I would you know if throughout it he just keeps increasing his share count he's not dumping on anybody.
2316.84s:  So I would say I don't know that he's building a case to go after manipulation the the SEC and finner and so forth have got to do something though because it just seems like there's too much going on here.
2331.84s:  I mean it's even getting the attention of people like John Stewart I think he did like a piece on it I think he's doing another one isn't he or something like that.
2339.84s:  I did one or two I think he might be doing a follow up. Yeah because I did a video basically touching on what I think are the key points I think he's right you're the one that I forgot I forgot anything that I know about GameStop I probably learned from you I was trying to think I was like where the hell did I hear this from but that must have been it.
2356.84s:  But that's the other things I feel like as it gets enough attention for stuff like that part of me again going super tin foil hat.
2365.84s:  It does make me curious though when I see like for example in Congress right now they're just getting to the point where they're all crooked look like I like ridiculous.
2378.84s:  They're just now getting to the point where they're trying to move a bill that stops them from trading individual stocks it's like the most common sense shit on earth.
2393.84s:  And that still hasn't been passed someone's like the daylight savings thing like stuff that's almost universally accepted by the people it's not moving through so it does make me curious if there are some other incentives that we may or may not be aware of that lead to this being slow rolled so heavily have you come across anything like that in your research.
2419.84s:  Well, I think your question that you're asking me just want to make sure you play around it is like.
2426.84s:  Would there be a reason for this to be taking as long as it is right because basically there's this steady build up of attention on it by the public by John Stewart people keep contacting their representatives contacting computer share the company could be you know pursuing litigation in the background we don't know.
2448.84s:  And I think that short selling in general is getting a lot of attention so I think that could be the case.
2456.84s:  I don't know Congress seems to move quickly sometimes like they move very quickly in 2021 that very much surprised me I said that a lot because they don't move quickly on anything right to get ahead of the story kind of shut it down get it off the public radar but then here we are it's it's happening again so.
2473.84s:  I don't know i'm i'm never very optimistic about politics because like you said it's such a.
2478.84s:  A common sense thing to do is political representatives that have access to committee information which is going to be incredibly impactful I think about like for example just a really easy one like solar policy right how much that could move markets in the solar industry in just a whim or anything dealing with like automobile manufacturing or.
2498.84s:  I don't know chip anything to do with chips right or health care or anything like that you have the access or energy policy anything going on in those committees is going to move markets and the fact that they don't have trading restrictions put on them is just completely absurd so.
2517.84s:  Because they're all becoming millionaires there are there the number of millionaires in congress on both sides of the aisle is way over the per capita number of percent of millionaires in the background in America and that's troubling right it's just i mean i say this in my to my friends all time it's just like what happened in Rome right so in Rome the senators all became these all the parks incredibly powerful families they were all extraordinarily wealthy legacy families.
2546.84s:  And I don't want to see that happen to the United States of America so we got to put restrictions on.
2554.84s:  I couldn't agree with you more than that oh we got somebody that chatted and I'd rather be seeing what a great name and they're happy with the tin fall hat i'm glad yeah i feel like you guys can't see it but there's actually pebbles in it too that make like the little thing around the the crown so.
2572.84s:  You know i would never equate myself to to Jesus the whole crown of Thor Thorne's doesn't seem come but this is not super comfortable either so but i have to give myself a shout out because this doesn't breathe at all i mean at least for the thorns you get to vent right vents that must feel a little bit a little bit of a break out here.
2594.84s:  Thank you very much i'd rather be skiing but to pivot to a couple other questions i notice that the community seems to really set itself up for a miserable experience because there's a lot of people that look at.
2613.84s:  That's you know these these dates right there's the the bloomberg terminal guy and we talked a little bit about that it's that stuff i.
2621.84s:  From a trading perspective i know that that's honestly silly like there's nothing that you can see on a bloomberg terminal that is magical that's not already disseminated into the market right so.
2631.84s:  They were apparently looking at swap data and maybe misinterpreted in the swap data because as you know from data the trades going to come in and then that swap can be modified repeatedly and right so that's the reason why i haven't dug into the swap data it's just painful styles of inventories and there's it's like the same traits modified modified modified so getting any eyes on what when those are due and then it could come to do day and they could they could probably roll it or do whatever with it.
2661.84s:  So it's like you don't even know what the impact is going to have on the stock either.
2666.84s:  That's interesting though if if that's like a manpower issue you and I can talk about that because if if you think that there's something interesting in there I think there's a few things we could do.
2677.84s:  To make it a little more digestible to speaking of breathable top.
2682.84s:  To make it more digestible to get through but yeah I agree the other problem with swap data too is that you can always make new ones like as long as you have somebody that's willing to be a counterparty you can only happen 24 hours a day to that market never sleeps so.
2700.84s:  We don't know and it's a little bit vague to in the in the data on on what the position actually may entail.
2708.84s:  It could be it could be a swap that's not based it cannot be a total return spot right it could be basket it could be a volatility swap so they're just betting on it staying in a channel breaking out of a channel moving up to some degree down to some degree it's just an enormous data set to dig into.
2725.84s:  It's seen sort of like I don't want to say a fool's errand but I just beyond my powers for sure but I think there's people digging and I would just encourage them to dig and maybe they could use tools to to get more insight on it I think the ETF flows are much more easy to digest at the moment so that's what I've been kind of digging into.
2748.84s:  Yeah I think that makes a lot of sense but going back to the origin of that thought is what did you make of the up acts the past week.
2761.84s:  Well I thought something you said was really interesting was you said the community sets itself for this date hope you think this is a three year story though we've been hyping dates forever and people get mad and then they want more dates and then so people start suggesting possible dates and but that date actually did some stuff like you said.
2777.84s:  The price moved up to Wednesday the date for unknown reasons hit a high of 29 90 or whatever that's a 20% mover whatever in two weeks that's that's a good date I would actually say it didn't move to whatever price target they had said but they were probably one of the better trust me bros we've had in recent times so but as far as the op X goes then you know hit that relative.
2806.84s:  Kick on the day and we saw the whole I mean the whole market sold so much right so how are you going to fight that and and keep moving upwards without some kind of like big big event happened and right and I wasn't really looking for something big so I think it's a perfectly fine move for unknown variables we don't know what to row it maybe settlement maybe T plus 35 maybe something to do with the mid months swap.
2835.84s:  Can't worry could be mean options could have just like charged it up and then people took profits and then it just ran it down with the whole market so you know I just feel like it's kind of like whatever blip on the radar keep looking forward fundamentally has that has the circumstances with game stop changed 16% in three days that's what I always ask myself no like nothing's changed in a month like company has you know 4.2 billion in cash no debt blah blah blah you know I'm not going to get a lot of money.
2865.84s:  You know company hasn't changed in all this time but the stock moves around like crazy so you got to kind of take it for what it is got it I would say to something that we talked about before this was you know moass is a is a topic of interest you know like how big could it be people is asking like what do you think it's going to go up to return it's like I really don't know there's so many it's a confluence of variables and time whites right if all of a company comes out and announces like some kind of crazy partnership with Nintendo.
2895.84s:  Where you can only get the switch to through game stop that's going to have enormous impact in the short term on the stock right with that cause moass who knows would some big player finally decide you know what we're just buying all the game step we can right now we're down 30 million shares in a by order for 30 million shares that's going to cause a lot of activity in the stock but like
2915.84s:  yeah I don't know what someone else then does someone else come in and say well we're willing to take the other side of that trade and keep going negative on game stop so it's like we never know with all the different forces of work when it's going to happen how big it could be or with the time limits but on these little cycles I think that they're fun to try to figure out because to me it's just a puzzle and I think that's the same how your mind goes to it as well we saw big 30 midweek like why you know and then do we see something on August 8th.
2944.84s:  If so that's amazing right if not why you know and we're just I'm just trying to approach the scientifically I say repeat we're not trying to get people excited but deep.
2954.84s:  Hi PM can be frustrating for sure.
2957.84s:  Yeah yeah it's well and it also looks like there's a lot of people trying to take a stab at it right because everybody wants to be the one that that cracks the the puzzle so it seems like that creates a cycle of people kind of throwing stuff and seeing what sticks now right I know that you
2973.84s:  have to bounce out of here in a few minutes.
2976.84s:  I thought that maybe we could spend the last couple minutes talking about exactly to your segue actually like forward looking so based on what you're seeing now what's interesting to you what are you looking at and then I thought I can run through the option chain at some point during it because there's some interesting stuff going on there but I want to hear what you're seeing.
2999.84s:  Yeah so I'll share my screen with you I can't prepare this time that's good it's honestly our faces have been centered on this too long anyways don't like that can you see.
3012.84s:  Sure can.
3015.84s:  So what I'm really looking forward to is June option settlement was right here on the 21st and it was a big one because not only is it a monthly standard option settlement right but
3032.84s:  Roar and kitty had purchased his 20s for that date and it just created a ton of interest more interest on GameStop in terms of options than we've seen in years.
3044.84s:  So and we did see the characteristic ETA fails to deliver around that time period that you want to see if you're hoping for a cycle to follow like the cycle that we saw on June 6 just two weeks prior.
3060.84s:  In case you didn't know the chat is enamored by your cross air.
3068.84s:  Yes they appreciate both its size and its girth.
3075.84s:  So so we had big options quarterly settlement and this is also going to because this is a quarterly this means that there was huge creation redemption this is obvious in the flow on ETFs on that same period not related to GameStop but just related to ETFs probably washing capital gains so huge
3097.84s:  and so we had a lot of money on the other stocks on the 21st so if you go six trading days forward that would take you to July 1st.
3106.84s:  So conceivably what happened was a market maker went to an authorized participant and said on July 1st or somewhere around here hey we need a lot of games stop they then failed the creation of a whole bunch of units of either XRT or other ETFs and then now they've got 35 days to settle.
3125.84s:  They lead us into August so I've got the 35 days indicated there in red. Those are calendar days and then the trading day happens because they go out and they're going to go buy those shares and then so that's what leads me to August 8th.
3137.84s:  So people might be like what how does that work but we can look back historic I'll give one other example April 19th was an was again a monthly option settlement.
3147.84s:  Big activity on the ETFs big fails to deliver on GameStop you go out six trading days and you go out 35 trading days I don't think I've counted me up here's one here's 32 we need 33 3435 and you go to three more settlement days.
3166.84s:  Boom here's our infamous day June 6th that I was personally looking forward to because we hadn't had one of these ETFs settlement cycles in a long time but we did see one on May 3rd which came off of March options in the same exact way back here.
3187.84s:  So we've now seen two of them we saw March the May we saw April lead just lead to June.
3195.84s:  Will we see June lead to August so that's what I'm that's what I'm looking at.
3201.84s:  And based on what you're seeing like the breadth of evidence what do you think.
3207.84s:  Well we saw the ETF fails happen here on the 21st as you would expect especially XRT.
3217.84s:  We saw the creation redemption activity go on so especially because it's a quarterly like I said every quarter they wash their capital gains i'm not looking at that very closely and August August is pretty consistent so June usually hits like 67% of the time.
3233.84s:  July like never hits but August hits pretty often like 50% of time so you know could be could be people will remember in 2022 August 8th was when GameStop and BBBY ultimate to like 50 bucks or GameStop into 50 I forget what BBBY went up to but they ran in tandem because they were in the basket together the basket tends to move in correspondence on these events so you can just look back at the basket.
3261.84s:  But basket so but we had a drought of these for a year for a year somehow they were able to defer and like after UBS took over credit Swiss we didn't see any of this stuff happen since June of 2023 and now we've had.
3277.84s:  May and June and just feels like a season for ETF settlement to me I don't know so that's that's what i'm really helpful for we didn't get our July well we'd say we saw something happened here right little baby cycle.
3290.84s:  Now yeah that's actually another question I had for you is how would you classify the move.
3296.84s:  What happened on July.
3298.84s:  Yeah because I know that that's that's part of your tracking is to kind of.
3303.84s:  There were some there were some things that tell me it was a forced settlement event because.
3308.84s:  The biggest part of the move was in the pre market.
3312.84s:  It went up to 29 98 or whatever in the pre market it was doing that fluttering characteristic like forced buying kind of like.
3321.84s:  I mean it was balanced on like a lot like 50 cents at a time boom boom boom boom it was like it didn't care it just needed the shares so this tells me that like some number of trading.
3333.84s:  So it was getting forced through CNS for some reason and then we just saw it.
3339.84s:  Characteristically just plummet like boom hard to climb right and to me it's always with these look like look at look at June 6.
3348.84s:  They did not care about the price after hours was going crazy and it just drops off a cliff into the morning especially with the 8k saying that there be a share offering same thing with May third actually.
3362.84s:  And I'm crazy didn't care the problem was there was a floor of options here they had been built up and notice how it landed on a Friday so uncharacteristic right.
3371.84s:  This one's happening on a 6th this one's potentially happening on a Thursday.
3375.84s:  Give some time to get it back closer to Max Payne they did not have that capacity here in the landed way above like $5 above Max Payne on May 3rd.
3386.84s:  So I think the reason that I think the reason that happened was because why did that happen this April's a 30 day month.
3395.84s:  It's a little bit shorter.
3398.84s:  I'm not sure why it ended up landing on a Friday that time just worked out that way super fortuitous I think I think that was very impactful.
3409.84s:  And when you look out into August.
3414.84s:  It seems like yeah how do you think about the date that you're specifically looking at against the op-x does that matter to you at all.
3426.84s:  Well I think that's it's better because like the fact that people are banking on a cycle happening during a week of a standard op-x.
3434.84s:  That's like never good to me because it's like okay they don't want to let a cycle come through into a huge options x-ray right that's that be terrible if you're you're managing this whole situation and you know when these some you're going to do everything you can to make sure
3449.84s:  a land somewhere other than here like on the 16th of August that be terrible right because like you know that this is going to be a hype date in the community you know that the 19th was going to be high right right so don't run a cycle into that do everything you can to delay a cycle like I think that's why people are saying something is going to be a lot of work.
3463.84s:  So why people are saying something that happened next week.
3466.84s:  I see because they're like all right we got it passed a pile of what 44% of the calls were all front dated all the way up to here now those are all gone some have enrolled like you know so the fact that this is not the third week is actually encouraging to me because I'm like all right even though lands pressed up against an op it's a weekly and I don't think there's hardly any interest.
3491.84s:  For August 9th right now right tiny the ninth is very small so the ninth has 15,000 calls against 5,000 puts the what I find actually kind of interesting those 16 aug has 171k calls against 97 puts that's not topical really what I find interesting about that though is that that's higher than the 26 July which is at 126,000 to 54,000.
3520.84s:  It doesn't surprise me in terms of a standard up x versus a weekly but just the front expiration cycle has been so heavy in game stop typically yeah we thought last time you said yeah the 19th was very heavy compared to August 16th yes and now but now the 16th is out weighing the 26th exactly exactly correct.
3545.84s:  Yep and I think people are maybe picking up on the idea of being way more discerning like we talked about last time right pushing it out to like build a base position out here.
3558.84s:  Because these cycles can be deferred right pretty obviously they deferred may in June for a long time and then they were very explosive so.
3570.84s:  Potentially people are spreading out their options more to further dates and quarter or monthly standards rather than going weekly's yeah I definitely see them in the standards that's kind of standard fair.
3583.84s:  And it looks like out in 16 aug the busy strikes are the 30s and as per usual the 125s and then the puts are are pretty active but yeah the.
3599.84s:  I mean i'm really really eager to see just in terms of how the market is positioning into this week especially with game stop like I'm very eager for Monday actually because.
3613.84s:  i'm just so curious how people are going to transact this week if it's going to be really light or and they're going to wait until it's closer to the aug expiration or if people are going to start positioning early.
3627.60s:  i'm curious to because earnings week will be over here right so.
3633.60s:  Game stop earnings should be.
3636.60s:  The fourth of the fifth we don't have a date yet.
3639.88s:  Right now it looks like it's going to be September fourth.
3644.84s:  Okay there we go and what's kind of cool about that is if there's a September cycle it would be coming in off of.
3655.12s:  Our op x we just had right so you go six trading days out you go 35 ever to go map on my sheet yourself just pull the sheet.
3664.72s:  It would be like the day of earnings.
3667.80s:  Did you say the I have it or so I have the cycle coming in the next day so that could be that could be exciting right we're doing cycles here and.
3679.80s:  Because typically they want to slam the price down part and so the earnings call occurs in the after hours on Wednesday they tank the price no matter what.
3690.80s:  It's like a very rarely moves positively on an art install for game stop but then if it's hook off like a rocket the next day.
3699.80s:  That would just be like kind of fun and September cycles aren't unheard of there when you pulled the noise said I have to go and then i'm just hanging out.
3709.80s:  I was literally I mean i'm here for it but yeah i was.
3714.08s:  See how often so August is like 42% and September is like 42% but you can see like July never happens you don't be so cool to add to this the severity for the month for sure.
3728.08s:  What the move was for sure exactly what the magnitude was I think that would be very very cool to see overlaid on this because then you almost I mean and.
3736.08s:  Like I said i'm really good at assigning people work via ideas I've got all sorts of ideas but the other thing I think would be cool to see here is like a well you can kind of visually see it but like a moving average to see yeah but.
3753.08s:  The definitely go in seasons though yeah seasonal that's in but i'm just so confused for the July that's that's one of the December makes sense I understand why that might have more seasonality based on holidays and deferrals that one I get July confuses me I still don't feel like I understand why this one is.
3775.08s:  Here's my other recent thought is you can see talk to me check this out so looking at the data this has been like my big.
3784.08s:  Thing for the last couple weeks on the channel and talking about ETF shares outstanding sorry this person but and then turning it into flows of creation and redemption so we can see xrt just had huge.
3796.08s:  I love that so xrt was going through like a bit of a creation cycle and then redemption just happened and price got tanked right so i'm building a model for this but.
3807.08s:  What stands out right away is every quarter on op x you can see huge creation and redemption happening across all the ETFs like it the magnitude way scans out so it's on March.
3821.08s:  And then it's on June op x as well.
3826.08s:  Right up here.
3829.08s:  And these are like huge huge creation and redemption events and they typically are the same amount created over a couple days and then redeemed over a couple days and what that would be is capital gains washing on the ETFs because they're basically trying to make us so someone does is sells an ETF.
3849.08s:  They get preferential capital gains treatment and especially the associated.
3854.08s:  What's it called what's mutual fund with that ETF that they share the same pool with so what i'm looking at now is on these cycles.
3866.08s:  So they do that in June right.
3870.08s:  So June op x sees lots of creation redemption across the whole market for the ETFs the cycle then would be for August off of June so that's why you would have something here.
3880.08s:  And then they're going to do it against September that's why November is pretty common.
3885.08s:  For having these cycles then they're going to do it again in.
3892.08s:  When would be the next time they do it just set September right other going to do it in December end of your wash so you go out two more months that's why February is pretty common.
3902.08s:  And then you're going to go out to march is going to be the last time they do it and that's why it may is pretty common for having some ways not that common but like July July is responsible op x is may and they're not washing in May.
3916.08s:  And how do we decipher when they're washing and why then.
3921.08s:  Well they do it quarterly.
3924.08s:  You can see it let me go back to.
3928.08s:  Right here here's op x.
3933.08s:  For September you can see they create this many shares of vxf and then they immediately redeem on two days later they do it on FMDA create and then redeem almost the exact same number of shares.
3944.08s:  And then they do this any other time.
3947.08s:  Well they do it.
3950.08s:  But yeah.
3952.08s:  But this is the this is so much bigger this is nine million shares.
3957.08s:  So ridiculous number of shares.
3959.08s:  But yes.
3960.08s:  Yeah.
3961.08s:  And I agree with you in terms of the magnitude but it the two things is I'm not sure that like PNL washing is the only I'm just trying to isolate the different reasons why they do this.
3972.08s:  And I'm not sure if it's going to be a signal because I see what you're seeing there and I.
3977.08s:  So this one was June what was the other one.
3980.08s:  September.
3982.08s:  So it's every quarter.
3984.08s:  Right here it is in March.
3989.08s:  And then it'd be in December.
3992.08s:  Okay.
3993.08s:  Yeah I mean that lines up about as good as you could expect it would.
3997.08s:  Right so everything's gone through earning seasons.
4001.08s:  Yeah.
4002.08s:  And I think that's the only way to get there.
4005.08s:  Profit.
4006.08s:  Price is kind of is this.
4009.08s:  Do you know if this corresponds with rebalancing at all.
4011.08s:  Because that's also they would be rebalancing then.
4015.08s:  Yeah so it's it could be rebalancing as well because now the pricing is all changed.
4017.08s:  Yeah.
4018.08s:  And some are some of different rebalancing windows.
4022.08s:  You know.
4023.08s:  So it's.
4024.08s:  It could just be something that has to do a van guard.
4026.08s:  These are my Vanguard ones.
4027.08s:  These are.
4028.08s:  States Street.
4029.08s:  And then they're in the Black Rock.
4031.08s:  Yep.
4032.08s:  So they might do it in a different cadence than one another.
4035.08s:  But I'm noticing that this grouping of small caps tends to kind of doing totally.
4040.08s:  Around the March, June, September, and December, up X's.
4044.08s:  Which makes sense.
4045.08s:  Like, you know.
4047.08s:  See right here.
4048.08s:  This is March.
4050.08s:  I don't have these color schemes like perfect or anything.
4055.08s:  Yeah, it kind of makes sense that like if they do a big shuffle around through all their mutual funds and ETFs in June.
4063.08s:  And then they have that six days and then 35 days.
4066.08s:  Then you get a cycle that pops off.
4069.08s:  And the cycle is going to land in August.
4072.08s:  Right now they're they got to go buy the shares.
4074.08s:  Fill up the ones that are that are short shares.
4077.08s:  And then if they do it again in September.
4080.08s:  So then you can November.
4081.08s:  Sorry.
4082.08s:  So I'm going to ask you a question on the lead and then to the August cycle based on.
4088.08s:  Based on them going through the creation process.
4092.08s:  Would you then postulate.
4095.08s:  Game stop would see an expansion in volume.
4100.08s:  And then if so, how does that correspond with the ETF volume?
4106.08s:  Yeah.
4107.08s:  So here's game stop.
4108.08s:  And I've got a little bit of a potential tailwind event.
4111.08s:  I've got to indicate it right on here.
4112.08s:  It's got the.
4113.08s:  I put green here.
4114.08s:  I think volume will be big.
4117.08s:  On that day, okay.
4118.08s:  On the 8th.
4119.08s:  And the next day, just like we saw on the 6th.
4121.08s:  Right.
4122.08s:  It be derived from the events here of June.
4126.08s:  We did see characteristics fails to deliver on xrt.
4131.08s:  Not a lot on the other ETFs.
4135.08s:  There's nothing really going on here except for OpEx.
4138.56s:  They're roaring kitty, it bought in six days prior.
4143.00s:  So it's T plus six office trade.
4145.44s:  That matters.
4148.52s:  Volume's not crazy, even though it's a very big OpEx,
4151.88s:  28 million, not the most exciting volume for that period.
4156.52s:  And then we go to the flows.
4157.84s:  So let's look at the flows on 621 per...
4161.84s:  So we can see on this day,
4165.32s:  there was huge creation on the day prior and the day of,
4170.96s:  and creation of ETFs is going to demand shares of games up.
4174.96s:  That's what I'm seeing.
4176.24s:  Makes perfect sense too.
4177.84s:  Even XRT, everything's being created in mass.
4181.36s:  And then you see them all hit like a peak over here on numbers shares.
4186.12s:  FNDAs at a peak.
4188.24s:  FNDAs at a peak.
4191.24s:  IWBs at a peak.
4194.08s:  Everything's literally peaked out
4195.44s:  because they've created a ridiculous number of units.
4198.52s:  But then they go into a redemption cycle right away.
4202.04s:  Lots of redeeming happening.
4206.36s:  Go ahead.
4207.36s:  No, I'm just...
4210.08s:  I'm trying to understand because I see what you're saying.
4213.08s:  I'm trying to understand like the mechanics of specifically
4217.16s:  what they're doing and why.
4219.32s:  I get the profit washing.
4221.32s:  That makes sense to a degree.
4222.64s:  Rebalancing makes sense to a degree.
4225.28s:  Well, you need to create...
4227.12s:  Like let's say you've got...
4229.00s:  There's a lot of these, like a billion shares of VTI right here.
4232.72s:  Yeah.
4233.72s:  But what the outstanding is, right?
4235.44s:  And they create six million shares.
4238.72s:  Well, they're going to actually a lot more over these days here.
4244.68s:  Yeah, eight million shares.
4246.56s:  So they create eight million shares.
4249.16s:  And then they're going to then redeem another eight million shares
4251.48s:  that are the old ones that are unbalanced.
4253.48s:  Does that make sense?
4254.48s:  Yeah.
4255.48s:  So you have to create the new ones with a new formula,
4257.52s:  the new balanced formula,
4258.92s:  and then redeem the old ones and get the shares back.
4262.20s:  I see.
4264.00s:  Now, how does this feed into then like the availability?
4269.24s:  Because to me, one of the things I would find curious about this
4272.60s:  is if the availability of something like GameStop is limited,
4276.80s:  it seems like going through this process
4278.76s:  would be really painful for them.
4281.16s:  Exactly.
4282.16s:  That speaks right to this paper by Evans,
4284.32s:  we were talking about earlier before we happened to call.
4287.28s:  And he's talking about when the ETFs are more liquid-weight
4290.88s:  than the underlying, which is happening with small caps a lot.
4294.72s:  And that's exactly the problem with GameStop.
4296.52s:  Look at the flows here, sorry,
4298.44s:  the back to the data.
4300.00s:  The flows on these things is crazy.
4302.20s:  You're talking about eight million shares of VTI.
4305.20s:  Well, how much GameStop do they need?
4307.64s:  Right?
4308.88s:  And so they're going to have to delay settlement
4311.16s:  is what his paper is talking about.
4312.44s:  And that's what they see.
4313.72s:  Because this was six years ago.
4318.32s:  Six years ago.
4319.32s:  And ETFs were only 10% of the market capitalization,
4322.52s:  but there were 20% of the short interest
4324.32s:  and 78% of the fails to deliver.
4326.56s:  So they're failing the underlying to create these units.
4331.72s:  Right.
4332.56s:  So what I'm going to talk about is, I love the paper.
4335.56s:  It's so good is they basically talk about,
4337.80s:  so if there's a big order imbalance,
4339.32s:  like someone comes in and buys a huge number of shares,
4342.08s:  well, then you go to an AP,
4344.12s:  you request the shares, the creation of the shares of the ETF,
4348.12s:  that's going to then dry up the volume that's hitting the market.
4352.28s:  That's going to suppress price in the short term.
4354.88s:  So the ETF makers could actually get a better deal
4358.00s:  on the underlying because all of a sudden the price dips.
4361.96s:  I think we could be seeing exactly that.
4364.40s:  If they created a ton of units of ETFs for the last week,
4367.56s:  and then now the delayed settlement gives them time,
4370.56s:  then there could be a dip and they could get a good deal,
4373.00s:  even though it costs them a lot of money to do all this,
4375.60s:  I think is kind of your question, right?
4377.40s:  Is that saying they're paying a fee to do this?
4380.76s:  They're tracking down all the underlines.
4382.68s:  But if everything goes through a cooling off period,
4386.52s:  then they could get the underlying for cheaper,
4388.72s:  and it's actually works out okay for them.
4391.40s:  I see.
4392.84s:  Yeah, I think it's...
4394.40s:  Where was that?
4396.00s:  I think it was.
4397.48s:  Also, fucking fascinating.
4400.88s:  Right, so I'm fascinated with this data.
4403.00s:  Someone provided it to me.
4404.72s:  They provided me all the historical outstanding shares
4408.92s:  for all these ETFs,
4410.48s:  and then I can just go through every day and update it now
4413.68s:  in real time.
4414.68s:  A little bit painful, but gives me perfect visibility
4422.00s:  on what the flows are, how much games
4423.80s:  out there you did a day.
4425.28s:  Right, yeah.
4426.48s:  I was gonna say for some like that,
4427.56s:  you just use like a web scraper and grab it
4429.48s:  from like Yahoo Finance and have it auto.
4431.80s:  Yeah, I'm terrible at stuff.
4436.84s:  Me too, my dog's the brain of the outfit,
4439.04s:  so I commiserate with you.
4444.28s:  Fucking fascinating.
4446.08s:  All right, homie, well, it's play time for you.
4448.80s:  You...
4449.76s:  Gotta go play some Pokemon.
4451.32s:  Yeah, it's time for you to get out of here.
4453.68s:  Thank you for hanging out and walking me through
4457.68s:  a bunch of this stuff.
4459.12s:  I would love to catch up with you again.
4463.36s:  Again, I'll shoot you a text, we can coordinate,
4465.56s:  but I'd love to catch up with you again next weekend
4467.32s:  or whatever.
4468.32s:  Yeah, let's play it by ear and see when a good day works out.
4470.92s:  I don't know if I'm available next weekend, but...
4473.16s:  Perfect.
4474.00s:  Yeah, very enjoyable.
4475.36s:  I always learn a ton.
4476.56s:  Thank you so much for having me.
4478.60s:  Yeah, man, it's always a good time.
4480.00s:  Thank you, everybody, for coming to hang out.
4482.08s:  And I think for a while, we're over 400 people, chilling.
4486.04s:  So thank you guys also for being a part of the whole story.
4489.64s:  I feel like a lot of the community is what makes
4492.64s:  a lot of this so interesting on top of everything else going on.
4496.88s:  So I'm super appreciative of everybody being a part of it
4499.68s:  and at least letting me observe and learn.
4503.60s:  So thank you, guys.
4505.28s:  Richard, you're the man.
4506.60s:  Thank you for chilling for a bit.
4508.20s:  Everybody else, thank you for hanging out.
4510.32s:  We will keep you up to speed on what we're doing.
4513.76s:  Our next one, we're kind of keeping up regular cadence
4515.88s:  on the updates.
4516.72s:  So we'll figure out a time that works for everybody
4519.24s:  and then we'll catch you all on the next one.
4522.88s:  You guys later.
4523.80s:  Thanks, everybody.
4524.64s:  Thanks, sir.
