0.00s:  What's up, apes today, we're going to take a look at GameStop.
4.20s:  So two things on the agenda, we have an expiration week coming up.
7.96s:  So we're obviously going to look through all of that.
11.00s:  And I want to start with a quick recap of the lessons learned from the live stream on
16.04s:  Saturday.
17.16s:  This is just where we've been diving into the story and the history of GameStop.
22.36s:  And typically after I have a chance to digest mentally, like what I was looking at, what
26.76s:  we were talking about, it's kind of fun to talk about from a high level what we discuss,
31.52s:  what we learned.
32.52s:  So the video on Saturday, we spent some time actually exploring through the recent conversation,
39.92s:  slash idea that Cohen met with sailor and then the potential that that could mean for GameStop
48.32s:  and involvement with cryptocurrency.
50.80s:  But there really was nothing we could find that either proved or disproved the idea.
56.52s:  So then after that, we just went through the stock.
59.40s:  We didn't really see a whole lot coming out that looked super interesting as of last week,
64.00s:  other than some of the price behavior based on that Bitcoin news.
67.24s:  And then we rolled into the good old DD library.
71.76s:  So the main thing I learned from the DD library last week is that it spent a little bit of
76.32s:  time talking about actually, I have funny, this is the exact thing I was going to mention.
80.84s:  It talked about the, it talked about the broader landscape where a lot of seemingly disparate
89.52s:  companies have shared interests or are even directly owned by some of the other companies,
95.48s:  specifically things like BlackRock, and how that can create an interesting lens when
100.28s:  you're looking at something like institutional ownership.
102.60s:  And if you're looking at a stocks institutional ownership and then you look at the list of
106.28s:  different institutions, a lot of those institutions either have ties or bubble up into the same
111.80s:  broader institution.
112.80s:  So then it kind of becomes the same institution potentially owning and exerting force over
118.96s:  that company.
120.04s:  I think it's a little more nuanced.
121.36s:  There's obviously more detail to it than that.
123.60s:  But that was one of the interesting pieces that we came across.
126.92s:  All right, let's get into what it looks like this week.
131.40s:  In general, this move here doesn't surprise me.
135.08s:  This largely came about when we did get the news, well news, when news coverage started
141.28s:  to pick up this idea that GameStop might be getting involved in Bitcoin.
147.56s:  One of the things to remember is that there are a lot of investors and less involved entities
153.84s:  in the markets that they don't really necessarily directly involve themselves until there's
159.12s:  some sort of news article written about it.
161.60s:  So that's why you see this news driven event because a lot of people are like, well, wait
165.76s:  a minute, we already saw this picture that picture is not new.
169.04s:  This is something that's kind of been talked about for a little while now.
172.12s:  So why now?
173.12s:  Why today and today being the 14th?
177.60s:  And that's simply because the news cycle started to pick it up and talk about it on the 13th
182.96s:  into the 14th.
185.28s:  That move itself did seem overdone and excessive to the upside based on everything else.
191.68s:  And I genuinely did think it was probably going to come back down into this range.
197.12s:  This is primarily because this broader move is likely from larger institutional positions
202.88s:  unwinding for one reason or another.
206.08s:  And in order for this to go through this kind of a magnitude of a significant rise and
211.12s:  maintain that pace would either be from institutional level accumulation or some sort of catalyst.
215.84s:  And obviously we had a catalyst from the Bitcoin picture coming out first with sailor.
223.92s:  But then also after that, again, the news cycle starting to pick up on the event and the potential.
230.64s:  And then today kind of, you know, gap down a little bit had an inside day.
235.04s:  We'll gap down below this area, not on the prior day.
238.64s:  And right now we're hovering right around 2697.
243.04s:  Nothing huge jumping out of me here.
245.60s:  Volatility is still very low.
247.84s:  74% volume.
249.28s:  You can see that places is literally at a 3% implied volatility percentile.
253.68s:  That means the overwhelming majority of days for the past year,
257.60s:  vol was higher than what it is right now.
259.76s:  So vol is siphoning out.
262.16s:  Volume is also drifting down, even though we're seeing these clear peaks
266.88s:  were volume clearly as spiking.
268.96s:  In general, if you take a look at the averages, they're trailing down very slowly.
274.48s:  So volume is starting to come out of the stock.
277.52s:  From a volatility perspective, we can see,
280.32s:  vol is essentially been on a steady decline for a while now.
283.92s:  This darker yellow line represents 30 day vol.
287.12s:  This brighter yellow line represents seven day vol.
290.96s:  So week and seven day vol has been coming down for literally two months.
296.56s:  We've been seeing this happening.
297.60s:  This has actually been a trade I've been running for some time now.
300.48s:  That's just because this has been very, very prevalent.
303.60s:  And now 30 day vol is actually contracted massively.
306.16s:  It's gone from 128% that you see here.
309.44s:  Now again, this is showing it at 86% ish.
314.56s:  So the vol that we're seeing is really,
319.20s:  really contracting, very significantly.
322.56s:  So let's take a look at the options chain.
325.04s:  I actually had somebody in the discord last week asking about the options transactions
330.56s:  that we were seeing specifically in the 21-feb expiration.
333.52s:  And I think to their dismay, unfortunately,
336.24s:  was saying that like I really wasn't seeing anything.
338.80s:  And I know that key was a little bit excited because there definitely is some life
345.92s:  in the options chain, but it's just not that much.
350.72s:  That's kind of the reality as it sits here.
354.40s:  So what I mean by that is when I look at the at the monies here,
358.72s:  you can see that the 27s have 5200 open interest.
362.88s:  And then there was 5800 traded today.
364.88s:  So definitely going to build out this front expiration a little bit.
368.80s:  So there's still always people playing the near term price movements.
372.72s:  But in terms of overall value, this option chain is not that deep.
376.80s:  There's just not that much in it.
378.48s:  So if we take a look at the total open interest for that option chain by itself,
382.40s:  the upcoming expiration, there's 166,000 calls and 40,000 puts.
387.04s:  So it definitely does and continues to maintain calls skew in favor of the upside.
391.76s:  That's not changed.
393.28s:  However, 166,000 calls and something like this really isn't that significant either,
399.52s:  based on what we typically see in here.
401.36s:  If I zoom this out, this is all the way down to sub 600,000.
404.72s:  Normally, this will be anywhere from 7800,000.
409.20s:  The high fives is a little bit low.
411.68s:  Now the good part here though is there's still massive callsque compared to putsque,
417.36s:  which that's great because we are actually at one of the largest call to put
424.08s:  OIscues that we've seen in a while.
426.08s:  So even though total OIs later, it's very heavy on the call side.
431.12s:  And a lot of people play this from a pot odds perspective because you never know what's
435.60s:  going to send game stop just flying, right?
439.44s:  And it could be the cat throws a tweet out.
441.84s:  It could be a million different things.
443.36s:  That's kind of how the stock moves.
444.56s:  That's one of the things that makes it so interesting.
447.12s:  But so it's cheaper to hold this now on a relative value.
452.16s:  These are very expensive.
453.36s:  The volatility on the call side, which I'll show you right now, tends to be very,
457.28s:  very expensive, which you can still see that here, right?
460.32s:  If we look in these front explorations, notice how high this call I've
466.00s:  shoots out.
466.72s:  That's the purple line and the blue line for your reference.
469.28s:  Purple lines 21 Feb, the 28 Feb is the blue line.
474.32s:  And you can see how high these IVs shoot out for these out of the money calls.
479.84s:  What that tells you is the market is essentially pricing in severity in that direction.
486.96s:  This is the market saying at this point, it can either crash or it can fly to the upside.
492.64s:  And because the levels are very similar, you don't really know which one.
497.76s:  And to give you a context of what this normally looks like, if we go over to Apple,
501.76s:  here's typically what you will see.
504.16s:  I'm going to limit this to just these front two series to give you the same example.
508.00s:  This is typically what you see.
510.08s:  Typically what you'll see is the front expiration will be slightly higher than the follow-on
515.92s:  explorations and in companies that just tend to grow and expand over time like Apple tends to do.
523.76s:  You often will see the call side much lower than the put side.
528.96s:  So what this is is the market pricing in severity to the downside,
532.40s:  bigger potential move, but a higher probability move to the upside.
537.20s:  Now if we compare this to what we were just looking at in GameStop,
541.12s:  it's a bit of a different story.
543.12s:  So market is essentially pricing in severity to both directions.
547.60s:  There's no way it's going to go.
549.28s:  It's scared and it's pricing in heavy vals to the upside because we all know GameStop can crack off
555.04s:  to the upside.
556.32s:  Big giant moves very quickly.
558.00s:  And again, based for a litany of different reasons.
560.48s:  And it could absolutely create her to the downside for the same thing.
564.00s:  So this is a really interesting play and it's also why I still really like the coverage strangle
569.68s:  in something like GameStop because of this kind of volatility profile.
573.04s:  It really is very, very beneficial for that style of trading.
578.96s:  Now the last thing I want to talk about though are the main exploration cycles.
584.80s:  So if we go out now to 21 March, you can see that there's only 51,000 calls, 16,000 puts.
591.84s:  So again, most of this volume is in these front two exploration cycles.
597.04s:  Now right now on the platform, it's showing earnings on the 25th after the close.
601.52s:  We will see if that holds.
603.36s:  If we take a look at the wall, it looks like the market might be buying it because this jumps up
609.92s:  to 89.7 from 75.
612.88s:  But then it also remains pretty elevated for these two.
615.44s:  So I think the market is probably saying it thinks it's going to land somewhere in this range.
619.52s:  That would be the expectation for the earnings release.
622.08s:  And just like the last one, I have to be honest, I'm very eager to see what
626.96s:  the earnings release has in store for us because the company is still sitting on enough cash.
632.80s:  It can do good things with that cash to reinvent the company.
637.60s:  I just really, really want to see how it positions out.
641.36s:  Now the last thing I do want to show you is this.
646.08s:  So I noticed that even though the volume, so if you go up here really quick,
650.80s:  you'll see that there's 130,000 calls against 23,000 puts.
654.40s:  But if you take a look at the volume of options today,
657.28s:  but then you take a look at the total premium between calls and puts.
661.60s:  So put premium 1.9 mill call premium 15.6 mill total 17.5.
668.72s:  There are still a lot of deep calls in terms of the skew overall value traded in the calls.
675.68s:  But a lot of these are short calls.
678.32s:  And there are people selling calls in these very regularly.
681.60s:  If you're holding this stock, it can make a lot of sense to do that because of how elevated
685.76s:  the volatility is. You're getting paid to hold something that you're holding anyways.
689.60s:  So this is interesting just because the total call value I tracked is pretty closely.
695.92s:  And a lot of times it'll maintain about this kind of spread between calls and puts.
700.48s:  But a lot of times we'll see a little heavier bullish skew on the premium as compared to the
707.44s:  bearer skew. And this is just guessing, by the way.
710.40s:  When it says bullish versus bearish, it's guessing based on where the call or put transacted at.
716.64s:  So if I sell a call, they view that as bearish.
719.68s:  It's not necessarily bearish because if I sell a call against long shares,
723.04s:  I still want the stock to go up. That's where my max profit is.
725.76s:  So just when you see this, always keep that context in mind.
728.24s:  It's not exactly as simple as that.
731.04s:  But the company itself still hanging in there.
735.12s:  I think we need to see how does it behave in this general now widening consolidation zone?
743.84s:  Because this is a pretty big consolidation area from 28 and a half, essentially,
747.92s:  down to 25 and a half. That's a little too big for a consolidation zone, actually.
751.92s:  I think that this will probably narrow out somewhere in here. I just don't know where.
756.32s:  So as always, anything I should take a look at, let me know.
759.60s:  I'll see you later.
