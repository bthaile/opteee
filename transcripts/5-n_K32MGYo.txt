0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.56s: Quick market update talking about the Trump tariffs, what happened, what the market is doing.
7.04s: We've been covering this pretty closely because obviously the market is very interested
10.84s: in this and we can see based on the futures reaction after hours, this didn't go as planned.
16.76s: We saw volatility leading into the event using things like term volatility in SPX, thinking
24.00s: to look at VIX term structure and it really didn't have a lot of all for this event.
30.68s: Then if we take a look right now at the eminies, they're down about three and a half percent,
36.68s: we have the Russell down about four, four point eight percent, almost five percent, NASDAQs
42.32s: down four and a quarter percent and VIX is up over six percent.
46.84s: Bitcoin is down almost five percent.
49.48s: We're down almost three.
51.40s: What this is telling us is this didn't go as planned.
54.08s: The market was generally expecting another outcome here and this is why trading volatility
62.20s: around events like this can be very interesting, but you got to make sure you get paid.
66.92s: In this context, trading volatility around the release didn't seem to make a lot of sense
71.52s: because the market wasn't pricing in the ball that otherwise we would have needed to
75.52s: see because of the potential for this exact kind of move.
79.40s: What's happening now?
80.40s: Let's take a look at what's been announced and what the implication of that is.
88.04s: Here you'll see if we just start at the top, there's a pretty big change in the broader
94.84s: policy than what is expected.
97.84s: The market and what Trump had been saying is that this was going to be a very scalpel
103.40s: approach where it's going to be primarily reciprocal, even nicer in some instances.
110.08s: This is a primetime example of the way that the market is trying to price risk and how
115.60s: interesting it is because the market is looking at all the information available to them.
119.80s: Statements being made, pricing of other instruments.
124.44s: Trump is saying things like I was listening to him talking last night and he was saying
129.56s: that he's actually being much nicer than some of the other countries have been with us.
135.36s: Things like that, right?
136.36s: So it brings this muted expectation, but then you also have to remember that this is Trump
141.56s: and it's kind of like WWE wrestling where Stone Cold Steve Austin can pop out at any time
146.92s: with a chair.
148.24s: That's kind of what's happening here because this I do not believe anybody expected.
154.32s: I didn't see this covered literally anywhere.
157.24s: You can see that it says there is a 10% baseline tariff that are across the board levies
163.20s: on all imports.
166.72s: Effective five April.
168.20s: This is what we would call the antithesis of scalpel approach, which I find very interesting.
176.44s: Now this next line talks about that piece that I was listening to last night and I think
183.68s: he was in the Oval Office just kind of taking general reporter questions.
188.00s: And he was saying that he's going to be much nicer, what I'm quote, then some of the
192.48s: other countries have been.
193.48s: So this is what I think he means by that.
196.28s: Where he's saying that there's going to be discounted reciprocal tariffs.
200.20s: So based on relationships and existing trade policy, we can see that duties 24% on Japan
208.52s: 20% on the EU in lieu of the universal 10% tariff.
214.44s: So he's being real nice here and instead of stacking these, he's just giving them the
219.40s: own special tariff without the additive effect, which is again significant.
226.56s: So the market right now is really doing its best to price this in because I think by
231.76s: all accounts, this came in heavier than expected.
234.80s: You can see that there's a 34% tariff on China and it's looking like it says like the
241.60s: 20% tariff Trump imposed over fentanyl.
244.96s: So it's adding to previous duties.
248.36s: The base tariff rate on Chinese imports will be 54% before adding tariffs imposed during
255.40s: Joe Biden's pregnancy and Trump's first term.
257.16s: So massive, massive tariffs.
259.28s: And you can see this being reflected across the market, right?
262.76s: So there's a lot of companies that rely pretty heavily on Chinese manufacturing.
267.80s: Some good examples of that are if we take a look at Apple, if you take a look at Apple
273.08s: after hours, they're literally down almost 10%.
277.08s: Right now they're trading they close that 22389 up about 0.3%.
281.52s: And right now they're trading at 208.
284.44s: So this is because there's a massive vulnerability.
287.40s: Now the beautiful part about all of this and this is one of the things I'm going to go
290.56s: into the pro livestream that I'm expecting to have later with the outlier pro members is
296.68s: talking about ways to capitalize on this because there's a lot of them.
300.08s: You can absolutely expect to see some behavior based on what we're looking at right now
304.64s: together over the next couple days.
307.00s: This is a beautiful opportunity.
309.08s: Anytime there's a dislocation between what the market expected to happen and what actually
313.52s: happened, there's a trading opportunity in the price movement between those two points.
318.84s: This is exactly what's going to happen tomorrow.
320.44s: It's going to be really interesting to watch.
322.64s: And for those that are able to move quickly and get trade ideas online, you can absolutely
328.68s: participate in your own way.
330.92s: Another great example here is Nike.
333.00s: We take a look at Nike Nike close that 65 now they're trading at 60 and a half.
338.52s: So not quite 10% but also showing a lot of weakness.
342.04s: And again, this is likely to be continued weakness because these tariffs don't just impact
348.08s: up front is where most of the pricing of the tariffs are going to be done and negotiated
351.80s: out between the open market, right?
353.80s: By and selling until we arrive at what we think the total impact will be.
358.00s: But the short term effect of that dislocation is highly tradable.
363.04s: And again, you can see it present in things like this.
366.80s: So you can effectively look through things and say, huh, what has exposure to some of these
374.32s: countries?
375.32s: As an example, and then use that as your barometer.
380.60s: So let's take a look through a couple other things, right?
383.68s: So auto tariffs that 25% tariffs on all foreign made autos as of midnight.
388.92s: Okay.
389.92s: So then let's take a look.
391.08s: There could be even a pairs idea here.
392.88s: Let's say look at Ford F and Ford is trading about the same.
397.88s: What does that tell you?
399.36s: Well, it tells you that what's happening here is generally expected.
404.04s: There's not a big surprise here.
405.60s: They knew this was coming.
407.40s: This isn't shocking anybody.
409.52s: Another thing that we uncovered during a stream yesterday that was very interesting was
412.76s: the wildly bullish positioning in Ford leading into today.
420.12s: And you can see that represented.
421.12s: It was up almost over 3% at one point during the day, just following along with the price
426.36s: activity from the day prior.
428.76s: So let's take a look at GM.
430.00s: Let's see how GM is varying here.
431.88s: 37, 98, close, 47, 25, 47, 10.
435.16s: What about the same, a little bit of a dip, but about the same.
438.96s: Let's take a look at something like Tesla.
440.72s: The reason why I like looking at Tesla is because Tesla typically is widely produced within
446.52s: the US.
447.52s: But notice how Tesla is down still here.
449.64s: Why would that be?
450.64s: Well, it's because of other integrations.
453.04s: It has beyond the auto motive side of things.
456.88s: So this is now the game.
459.16s: And it's a really fun game because there's a lot to look at.
461.72s: There's a lot to price in.
463.16s: And I imagine that you're going to see a lot of news coming out about this as everybody's
467.68s: digesting what's going on.
469.32s: Pay attention to the industries, pay attention to the countries, pay attention to expectation
473.96s: price dislocation.
475.72s: The other thing to pay attention to in my opinion is the use of these tariffs for follow-on
481.40s: conversations.
482.40s: And there's actually a really important line I saw from here.
487.56s: I would advise none of the countries to panic.
491.04s: I wouldn't try to retaliate because as long as you don't retaliate, this is the high
495.84s: end of the number.
497.00s: What does that tell us?
498.36s: It tells us that the broader intention here is to use this as a negotiating tool.
503.00s: It tells me that the intent behind this is to try and draw back some of the other tariffs
510.32s: that other countries have.
512.56s: And if we go that route, there's a chance that this abates relatively quickly, which I
518.68s: would be surprised if that were the case, but it could.
521.40s: And if that did happen, I would expect the market to love that, to respond very, very favorably
527.84s: to that news.
529.32s: If it goes the other route and we start to see more tariff reciprocity, look out below.
534.36s: That just adds massive inflationary pressure on top of the already tenuous spot that
538.68s: we're sitting in.
539.92s: So it can absolutely get ugly pretty quick.
542.80s: We have to wait and see.
544.40s: Now the question is, how do other countries respond?
547.24s: Two things on top of mind.
548.88s: First one, trading the near term ingestion of this information and price dislocation against
553.84s: expectations.
555.16s: The second thing is following how other countries respond, because that's absolutely going
559.48s: to drive what you see happening today in a pretty big way.
562.52s: If you have any questions, let me know.
563.52s: Be an outlier.
564.52s: See you later.
