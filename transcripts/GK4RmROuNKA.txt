0.00s:  What's up everyone, Eric here. Welcome back to the outlier podcast and I have my friend,
6.96s:  Dave Lauer. He's kind of a man of many hats, but right now he's the CEO of Irvin and
12.48s:  he's also the co-founder of We The Investors. He's super involved in markets. He's been
17.92s:  on the channel before, but it's been a minute because you've been a busy bee. What's up,
21.52s:  man? It's good to have you back.
22.56s:  Hey, thanks for having me, Eric. Always fun. Love what you're doing and love these conversations.
28.00s:  I have a blast. And I mean, honestly, before we even press record button, we talked for about
31.92s:  a half hour on all sorts of stuff. And we got into Peter Tia's work. You're talking about
37.28s:  Hugherman Labs, all the fun stuff. But for here, I figure we'll start with a little bit more of a
43.60s:  market-flavored tone. And really, I got to pick some beef with you literally. And obviously,
50.24s:  the market-flavored tone is a joke. So I'm going to talk about Wagyu steak because I've had Wagyu
56.00s:  steak a few times. And every single time I'm disappointed, I think it's an overpriced cut of me
62.08s:  that is sub-part just about everything else I've had. I would love for you to change my mind
66.96s:  because apparently you're the Wagyu man based on your Twitter comment. I'm so confused. All right,
72.64s:  so look, I really love my steak. I want to say that, earnestly, that what is better than steak?
80.56s:  I was, we were talking before we started recording about longevity and all of this. And I have
88.96s:  experimented with diets, not weight loss diets, like health diets, my whole life. And for quite a while,
96.16s:  I was carnivore. And it was the best one. That was my thing. I'm apparently genetically not
103.52s:  supposed to be a carnivore and the testing did not work for me. But it was fun. And I will say
110.64s:  this that my daughter, her favorite food is steak. She's 11 and-
114.88s:  Reason am right. Yeah, we take our steaks seriously in this house. So, you know, I think though,
122.48s:  when you were talking on Twitter, you were saying that you prefer a lean cut. You're like a filet guy.
127.84s:  So I do think that probably has something to do with it because my favorite cut is a ribeye.
133.68s:  And, you know, a ribeye juicy fat flavorful, right? And when you get, when you step it up to
142.08s:  wag you, and you cook it perfect, because it has to be cooked perfect, right? So I'll talk about this.
148.72s:  I like the reverse sear. I'm an actylate of Kenji Lopezalt. I think he is a genius in many
156.16s:  ways in the kitchen and versear super straight forward, right? Put it in the oven at 250, probably
162.08s:  for 40 minutes or so. Hit it once it hits like 105 or so. Get it into a rip-roar and hot pan.
169.84s:  Get it nice and brown on both sides. And it is the exact same color throughout with a nice crust
176.40s:  on on either side. And it just, I mean, if it- like a good ribeye, if you've salted it overnight,
182.72s:  right? And you treated it right. It's going to be really good. But like that, that wagyu,
188.00s:  you don't even have to salt it overnight. It helps, but you don't have to. It's just, I don't know,
192.48s:  it just melts in your mouth if it's cooked right. But if you don't, I guess if you don't like that
196.56s:  melt in your mouth, it's not- you know, and I'm not talking about that A5 crazy wagyu either.
206.32s:  I think that- I don't think- I'm not like a huge fan of going all the way to that level. I think
212.40s:  like a regular wagyu is the best. And I was in this- I was also in like this steak club.
223.52s:  You know what's the thing? It was- it was an invite only steak club, all right?
230.96s:  Dude, I can't. I can't.
235.36s:  And it was- In my only steak club, we would get this like New Zealand
242.80s:  grass fed wagyu. And it was like- I'm telling you it was like the best meat I ever had.
252.72s:  Dude, I wish I liked food a quarter of that amount. I have always been like- I like good food. Who
263.68s:  doesn't like good food? But like other than that, I really don't fucking care.
268.40s:  Yeah, see that news that-
269.60s:  The fresh old good I'm good.
271.76s:  Yeah, see you- you know, look, my wife were funny pair because, right? I am- she's an
276.80s:  eat to live and I'm a live to eat. And she's a vegetarian. I'm not. She couldn't give a shit.
281.04s:  She'll eat salad every night. She's perfectly happy with that.
283.68s:  Right.
284.48s:  I'm sous-veating up my pork loin and like air frying my broccoli and you know, doing everything.
290.16s:  And I like to cook. I like to eat. It's one of my great pleasures in life.
294.80s:  And you know, like what's the point otherwise, right?
297.52s:  Well, I definitely appreciate learning and the new thing already, which is about invite only-
302.80s:  I already have it pulled up in Google because I have to look at it. I can't- it just
307.20s:  blows my fucking mind.
308.32s:  It was, you know, when I moved to Canada, I contacted them like, will you ship here? And they're like,
313.52s:  no. I was like, oh, no. I didn't even realize it. Everything had been sent in emotion already.
320.96s:  I gave- I gave the membership to a good friend of mine and he was very happy.
327.44s:  Well, now the real question is, if you knew that they wouldn't ship before you set everything
335.44s:  into motion, would you have still moved?
339.44s:  It would have- it would have made it that much harder, but there was no choice.
343.44s:  My Canadian wife was coming back to Canada and that was that.
347.68s:  Got it. In-vite state club or not. Hell or high water. We got it.
351.52s:  Yeah, yeah. But we got a great picture. I'll say this. We got a great picture just right down the street
356.80s:  and we get anything we need there.
359.92s:  Well, like I said, I'm open to figuring it out, but every time I have Wagyu,
364.96s:  I'm always pissed off that there's not enough meat with the fat. I would rather a little bit more
369.60s:  meat with the fat. It's just too fat.
371.52s:  All right. I'm telling you, when we are finally in person,
375.60s:  I'm going to change your mind on Wagyu.
377.60s:  I'm open to it. I think Tomahawk are okay for a ribeye because you can get around the fat
385.36s:  and then it's not too bad. But with the lague, there's no getting around it. It's everywhere.
392.40s:  But they've got the butcher here. He's got first of all, he does an amazing age,
396.08s:  like 45-day age Tomahawk. That thing is just exceptional. But he also does have Wagyu
402.80s:  filet. It is much easier. I think that would be right up your alley. I do not like filet because
410.40s:  it's too lean for my tastes. But I did have a filet Wagyu for my mom who also likes lean cuts.
416.16s:  And she just thought it was exceptional.
418.80s:  Really? Okay. That's a secret for you.
421.28s:  It's promising. Speaking of promises, you promised me that inflation was transitory.
427.68s:  That was the last promise that we've had. So,
431.92s:  figure we got to poke that there just a little bit and see where we stand.
436.00s:  All right. I'm going to share this screen. I don't know if this is going to come through.
439.44s:  Well, it's a little of a low-res chart, but here, there. Can you see that?
444.56s:  Oh, it looks great. Yeah. It looks like super core inflation cools off. Nothing like good old super core
450.40s:  inflation. That looks transitory to me. Now, let's be clear. Right now, I'm talking
462.00s:  economic numbers and statistics. And I think that as you and I were kind of talking about a little
468.16s:  before, there are two, I think there are two sides to inflation. There's what economists are
474.00s:  measuring and looking at. And then there's what people are experiencing.
478.96s:  So when I talk about inflation, I feel bad because now I think people think I'm like
484.24s:  minimizing the real world impact. And I don't mean to do that at all. Like, inflation is horrible.
490.24s:  Right. And that's why the Fed is doing what it's doing. The Fed is saying, you know, and
496.00s:  maybe they're going to engineer soft landing, probably not, but I hope they will.
500.48s:  They are saying that, you know, a recession, even if it's a severe recession, is preferable to
509.20s:  inflation. And so that's how bad inflation is, right? And so this chart, let's just start with
516.08s:  the numbers here. Oh, okay, I can zoom in a little. Okay. This chart shows you, okay, here was
520.56s:  COVID, right? And, you know, here's the green is the GDP growth. And, you know, then there was
532.08s:  the bounce back. There was, you know, there were some flashes of it up and down, right? Like,
538.40s:  because, you know, when you're borrowing from the future and your the Fed is spending a lot,
541.84s:  but like, I think it was right around here, let's say, that you and I talked about
547.52s:  inflation being transitory. And a lot of economists are reading, we're saying, you know, this looks
552.80s:  like transitory. And it continued to go up, no doubt. And it stayed high and longer than we had hoped
558.64s:  it would. Now, economic growth did start to pick up, which helps to offset some of the effects of
565.12s:  inflation. But now, here we are coming back down to baseline. And, you know, look, this is
573.20s:  an almost two-year sort of, you know, period above baseline. And, and I think that, you know,
583.04s:  I don't know, is that transitory? Is it not? Are we like, quibbling over semantics? I'm not sure.
589.60s:  I think people feel it wasn't and they feel that it's not going away. And I think that's a
597.20s:  different conversation. Right? So from like an economics and statistics perspective, I still think
602.96s:  there's a good case to be made that this was transitory. The, you know, the war in Europe and
608.96s:  Ukraine made it worse. That was sort of an exogenous shock to the system and oil prices and such.
616.64s:  We're a big driver of inflation when people thought it was going to start coming down and it didn't.
623.12s:  But now, we're seeing oil prices back down to normal. You know, the fed is having an impact on
630.56s:  the housing market. Those are, you know, two of the largest, or were two of the largest
636.16s:  in drivers of inflation, food inflation, I think is the thing that people really feel.
642.08s:  And that has not cooled off in the same way that other measures have. And certainly, up here in
648.88s:  Canada, it's terrible. Like food inflation is just horrendous. And then you have this,
656.48s:  on top of what I'm showing at here, showing here, which is price inflation, you have
662.24s:  what's called greedflation. And greedflation is, you know, I don't like the term. It's kind of like
669.68s:  this progressive talking point, but it is a real thing. And when you have markets that are highly
675.20s:  concentrated, you have companies that can take advantage of inflationary periods to raise
682.32s:  prices more than they otherwise would, especially when they don't have the kind of competition you
687.52s:  would need to prevent that from happening, right? And the US economy in many places have become
692.72s:  highly concentrated, highly monopolistic. And so I think you saw and have continued to see a lot
699.68s:  of that as well. It doesn't, I know for a lot of people, it doesn't feel like it, but I think there's
705.44s:  a lot of good news economically coming out recently. GDP growth is strong. The consumer continues
712.72s:  to spend money and inflation is coming down and unemployment is staying low. It looks like a soft
720.32s:  landing. Now that might be just because we are right at the halfway point of the crash.
728.16s:  It's, I don't know. I'm not an economist. I didn't get a degree in it, but I don't really practice
734.48s:  it or anything. So, you know, I just, this is just from reading smart people and trying to understand
740.32s:  different perspectives. You know, I've been reading a lot of people that say we are about to enter
744.72s:  a recession and others who say, this is amazing. The Fed is hitting, is nailing this off landing.
750.32s:  I think I would not have thought a soft landing possible. And it actually seems possible now.
758.88s:  I don't know if that means it's going to happen. But honestly, like if you think about
762.72s:  historically what we're coming out of, which is the, you know, the post.com housing bubble,
770.80s:  the post, you know, that popping, then the great financial crisis with interest rates being
775.52s:  as low as possible for so long and the fed printing money and then COVID, it would be astonishing
784.00s:  if there was even the possibility of a soft landing coming out of that with normalized interest
790.32s:  rates. Nobody thought it possible. And the fact that it's even possible, I do, I do think it's
796.88s:  really impressive from an economic and policy perspective. You know, a lot of people hate the Fed.
803.36s:  And for good reason, I think the Fed has fucked up in what it's done over the years. But,
807.68s:  you know, that doesn't change the reality of its role in the economy and in our lives. And,
813.28s:  you know, this Fed is certainly pulling it off so far. I don't know, that's, that's, I guess that's
819.68s:  the way I see things right now. Well, and I think it's fair and not that I would ever say this to
824.48s:  your face, but I actually also agree that it's transitory, just based on the definition.
828.72s:  But that part of side, I also see your point on, you know, the realized inflation for people,
836.00s:  but there's also a lead in lag there, right? Like you're looking at growth. And yeah, so I think,
842.00s:  yeah, it's interesting that the soft landing I got to say we're probably two opposite sides of
846.88s:  that coin because as of right now, I'm like, to your point, maybe it happens, but man,
852.96s:  that would blow my fucking mind. I don't see it happening. Yeah, that would be insane. But
858.96s:  I mean, honestly, like you should get, if, if Powell pulls it off, like he should get a
862.80s:  fucking Nobel Prize or multiple, like this is just, it's an extraordinary, you know, situation
869.84s:  and history of events and nobody would ever have thought of even possible. So, honestly,
874.16s:  like just the fact that it's being debated right now is shocking and in and of itself.
879.84s:  Yeah, and it's interesting. Part of me is curious how much of just a general talking point that is
884.08s:  versus something that's like actually being considered. I know that you follow really
889.36s:  wise people on this stuff. So I have to maybe do a little bit more homework there because yeah,
893.20s:  it's, I was doing a bit of research just on how fascinating this entire tightening cycle was.
899.36s:  There was a lot of firsts that occurred during the technical, a lot of them. So to your point,
906.40s:  even if it's like seriously being debated, that is interesting in and of itself, I think.
910.88s:  Yeah, I mean, look, inflation got extremely high, right? Like 9% inflation is crazy. And that's
917.44s:  really horrific. It hurts people real bad. And it hurts retirees on fixed incomes. Really bad,
925.76s:  it hurts, you know, lower income people who are, you know, just eating out survival, you know,
932.88s:  subsistence and survival level who can't afford increased prices. And that's, you know, again,
938.24s:  like the pain of that inflation is enough that the fed says a recession is preferable to that,
943.76s:  as painful as a recession is. And, you know, I think that that's the risk they were willing to take on.
951.60s:  And that they expected would happen. And when you look at the numbers, the fact that consumer
958.00s:  spending continues to be elevated and that wage growth is starting to pick up and that,
965.92s:  you know, employment numbers. And, you know, look, I know I hear every time I post about these,
970.16s:  these numbers are all made up and all of that. And, you know, I, if someone has better numbers,
976.56s:  I'm willing to look at them. Like I do look at the, the, the, the internet, you know, the U6
981.76s:  unemployment versus, you know, the U3 and all of that, like, you know, I get it. But, you know,
987.36s:  and people get really upset that these numbers get revised. And so that's like, if you,
993.12s:  if you get upset at that, that's fine. Maybe don't look at the initial number releases because
998.40s:  you don't think there's much to them and wait for the revisions. But, you know, like, that's just,
1003.12s:  I don't know, I don't see any grand conspiracy in any of these numbers. I think that, you know,
1008.16s:  they're trying to measure them as best as possible. They're trying to get leading economic
1011.60s:  indicators out there. So people know what's going on as quickly as possible knowing that, you know,
1016.88s:  it's not, they're not fully baked. And they're going to have to be revised, you know, we're used
1021.12s:  to seeing revisions. This is all well understood. So, you know, I, I do think that, like,
1026.88s:  durable goods orders that last week were up like 4.7% of its expected to be 1% or something,
1032.32s:  you know, a little or 1% that at least these are, and, you know, unemployment is in the basement.
1037.92s:  It's really, it's, it's just a shocking set of economic numbers that I don't think anyone
1043.68s:  would have expected to see. Yeah, I agree. And a couple of metrics actually just came out today.
1048.88s:  There was the Joltz job openings and then ISM manufacturer PMI. It's, yeah, it's interesting
1055.92s:  to see the way that this is kind of at least trending. It's hard to say and winding at this point,
1062.80s:  but definitely. Right. And ISM is still pointing to expansion, right? Economic expansion. It's over,
1067.84s:  it's over 50, I think it's, it's expansionary. So, like, you know, it's so far, you know, and
1074.48s:  again, like, you know, I've seen the other chart, which is like, oh, here's consumer spending. And,
1078.88s:  yeah, we're right here, like just above zero, but it is clearly going straight down. I, you know,
1083.20s:  I don't know. I wish I could tell the future. I'd be a lot wealthier, but, you know,
1088.16s:  well, as soon as you want to pick that up, let me know because I get on board with you.
1092.16s:  Very. So you've been super, super involved in markets for a long time. And you've recently had
1100.96s:  a bunch of conversations with Gensler just about market structure and market functions and stuff
1106.40s:  like that for those that haven't caught all of those conversations, which I'll grab them from
1111.68s:  you so I can link to them in the show notes because they are really great dialogues. But if you
1116.16s:  could maybe bubble up maybe the top two or three themes that you're talking with him about and
1122.80s:  the way that you see us moving forward on those themes, I think that would be really informative
1128.40s:  for people to understand the broader landscape because a lot of retail traders, they're just worried
1132.48s:  about clicking the button and trying to tee their way on their zero DTE options before they
1137.68s:  decayed a nothing. And I think sometimes people forget to kind of zoom out a little bit.
1142.64s:  Yeah, I think it's an interesting question. I think the two main themes
1150.48s:  from our conversations are that the rules in markets are old.
1157.76s:  They're the governing structure, which is called Reagan and S. S. for National Market System,
1163.20s:  was these rules were passed in 2005. Like the iPhone didn't even exist, right? And
1168.96s:  now it's 2023 and things have moved far past the reality, the technological reality of 2005.
1179.60s:  And so one of the themes that the SEC is trying to modernize equity markets. And our conversations
1187.52s:  have been focused on equity markets. A lot of people are into him and crypto. And I frankly don't
1194.32s:  have much to add to that. I think others do have much more insight than I do. I've had a few people
1200.88s:  on my podcast to talk a bit about it. But I really focus on equity market structure. And so one
1206.40s:  of the themes I think is that the SEC needs to modernize market structure, which I totally agree with.
1210.56s:  And frankly, a lot of people in the industry agree with. So there are two new rule proposals that
1216.00s:  came out of the SEC of the four that were really focused on that. The first was Update Rule 605,
1222.24s:  which is just a quantitative disclosure of execution quality and a venue. And now it will be extended
1229.28s:  to some large brokers. So you'll get a lot more visibility and transparency into how your orders
1235.20s:  are being handled. Hard to argue against it. And there has not been much opposition to it. And then
1241.44s:  the updates to Reagan MS again are to modernize markets. They're addressing tick size,
1247.76s:  which is the quoting and trading increments in markets, which are set to a penny for most stocks.
1254.96s:  And it's sort of a one size fits all approach to markets that doesn't really work. So they recognize
1263.52s:  that they're looking to shrink the tick size. Our argument was don't shrink it as much as you are
1270.24s:  talking about. And also widen it on the other side for less liquid stocks. And that will improve
1277.20s:  liquidity and execution quality on the other side. And most of the industry I think agrees with that
1281.92s:  as well. And then there are a couple of other small things like some market data updates and all of
1288.40s:  that. So modernization is one theme. And then the other theme I would say, which is actually
1295.28s:  one of the main sort of governing philosophies of this administration. And this is the thing that
1304.40s:  I really like about what the Biden administration has done is about competition. And again, this is
1314.32s:  to me, especially the competition angle is one that should transcend politics. This is not something
1321.28s:  that I think is a partisan view. I think generally regardless of what side you're on, that competitive
1328.56s:  markets are a value that generally, especially Americans should hold quite dear. And what we see in
1338.48s:  our equity markets, much like we see in many other parts of our economy is corporate concentration
1344.88s:  of power. And in US equity markets, especially when you think about what happens to an order from
1352.08s:  a retailer individual investor, that order almost universally goes from your broker to Citadel or
1358.80s:  Virtue to one of two firms, maybe a third, there's a third that has a small market share, but it's
1363.68s:  really one of those two. And that's a big problem. That's not how markets are supposed to operate,
1369.68s:  right? That you want competition to get the best price for that order. And you want it for a
1375.68s:  couple of reasons. You want it for the benefit of the individual investor, because today your brokers
1381.60s:  are not getting the best execution. And that's what the SEC said. They said if your broker accepts
1385.60s:  payment for order flow, the execution quality is not as good as if they don't accept payment for order
1390.32s:  flow. And this is something we've known. We've known this for years. And there's been studies for
1394.96s:  years on these issues. And the other thing is that that concentration generally hurts markets.
1402.40s:  And what it does is it creates this dynamic where these orders stay off of exchange. And so on
1409.28s:  exchange, on the stock exchange, where the price, the MVBO, the National Investment and Offers
1413.60s:  actually determined, you have less competition there. And you have all of the orders that nobody
1420.32s:  wants to trade against. They're the ones that go to the exchange. And so because of that, the firms
1425.60s:  that are making markets and that are setting the MVBO, they set it wider because they have to
1431.68s:  compensate for that toxicity, the toxicity of the orders that get to the exchange. And so because
1437.84s:  of that, generally speaking, across markets, our spreads are too wide. And so that's a cost. Every
1444.32s:  transaction that happens in markets, people are paying more than they otherwise would. And that's retail
1449.84s:  investors, but that's also pension plans and institutional investors like mutual funds. So, you know,
1455.60s:  you as a retail investor generally get hit multiple times. You like to trade, you like to buy and sell
1460.24s:  your own stocks. That's great, but you're getting hit there. But you also hold some of your wealth
1464.16s:  in retirement funds and mutual funds, ETFs, you're paying higher transaction costs there too.
1470.80s:  And so I think that that's the SEC's approach is trying to identify where there's this concentration
1477.68s:  risk and come up with ways to introduce competition. Now, for retail traders a lot of times, I feel
1484.08s:  like they don't actually fully appreciate where they're getting hit, right? A lot of them see,
1488.56s:  they open up their Robinhood platform and it says zero commissions. So can you help us understand
1496.72s:  where those fees actually are being assessed? It kind of on the back end because this is one of
1502.48s:  the hardest things I think people don't understand what the idea of zero commissions is still
1508.24s:  fucking expensive. Yes, exactly. We've been on this, we've launched a campaign recently with
1516.80s:  the investors and we're basically the theme is free trading ain't free. You think it's free.
1524.00s:  It ain't, come on. You really think something on Wall Street is going to be free? Let's be honest
1531.84s:  with ourselves. You trust the financiers and bankers so much. They're out of the goodness of their
1539.44s:  heart. They're giving you free trading. They're just wonderful. They've never destroyed the economy or
1545.28s:  anything through their own greed. Now they would never do that. They never take unnecessary risks
1552.88s:  and try to concentrate power as much as possible to extract rents to buy a fifth,
1558.48s:  six, nine figure home. They would never do that. No way. It's not something they would do. So,
1564.80s:  yeah, so when you see free trading, you should be very skeptical. And I say that there are
1574.08s:  firms out there that offer free trading and they don't do these things. And those brokers are good
1580.16s:  brokers because they are trying to get best execution, get you the best price possible. But a lot of
1589.04s:  brokers basically just take your order and send it over to the middleman. And the middleman says,
1594.72s:  what price am I going to give to you? Okay, here's the NBBM. Here's the best bid. Here's the best
1600.72s:  offer. I'm going to fill you right there. I'm going to give you this. I mean,
1605.36s:  they didn't have improvement. But guess what? I beat the best offer. I gave you a price better than
1612.32s:  what was out there. That's best execution. But what it's not, it's not, it's good enough execution
1617.28s:  because you're like, oh, well, that's great. I just traded for free and got that in the NBBM. What
1621.60s:  could be wrong with that? But here's the problem, right? In doing what they've done and creating
1627.04s:  this entire system, which was mostly designed by Bernie Madoff. Okay, let's be straight. He's like
1632.16s:  the big... Preferable gentleman. Yeah, yeah, the big proponent payment for order flow, the big
1636.64s:  proponent internalization. Most of these rules were, you know, he's responsible for it because he was
1642.32s:  very influential. What we've gotten with this system, like I said, is all of these orders stay in
1648.88s:  these two firms. And so that means that spreads are wider on exchange. So they have destroyed
1657.12s:  spreads. They've widened spreads by 30%. That's the estimate. Spends are 30% wider than they otherwise
1664.08s:  would be. And then they price improve you like 5%. You know, here's a 10%. Here's a 2%. Right? It's
1669.20s:  like that's the cost. The cost is if the system didn't exist, spreads would be 30% tighter. You
1675.84s:  wouldn't need any price improvements. Those prices would be great. You'd be thrilled with them.
1680.72s:  So that's the cost. The cost is that markets are more volatile and fragile. That's another cost,
1687.12s:  right? So in the presence of high rates of internalization, high rates of off-exchange trading
1692.08s:  in these retail wholesalers, extreme price movements increase significantly. Okay, because there's
1698.80s:  less liquidity. So markets become more fragile, less liquid. You have a bigger price impact. And if
1705.20s:  you're a big swing in, you must be here. You're putting on size, forget about it. As soon as you
1712.56s:  hit the market, it's moving away from you. And that's the case for institutional investors as well.
1718.56s:  So like I said, it's not just costing you and getting inferior prices than you otherwise would
1722.88s:  be a retail investor. But if most of your retirement savings are in a pension plan or with
1728.48s:  in a mutual fund company that has to keep transacting, they're facing higher transaction costs.
1733.04s:  And that's why institutional investors broadly support a lot of these reforms as well. Because
1739.76s:  they want to see transaction costs come down. And what we see around the world is that in countries
1747.20s:  that don't have payment for order flow and don't have extreme fragmentation and don't have extreme
1751.68s:  levels of off-exchange trading, their market quality is actually higher than in the US. So a lot
1757.84s:  of people like to say, and if you look at the comment letters on these SEC rule proposals,
1761.76s:  every single middleman who is a proponent of the status quo put a comment letter in.
1768.80s:  And they're all say the same thing. US markets are the envy of the world or the best
1773.76s:  ever. Any time, anywhere, we can't touch them because everything's working perfectly. And then
1779.28s:  when you actually date, you have some data to support that? No, no, no, we just have to say it.
1785.92s:  That makes it true. We don't have to actually provide data. We can we can spout platitudes
1791.36s:  all we want. And so in our comment letter, one of the first points we made was actually the US
1796.40s:  markets aren't the best in the world. And that's a fucking problem, right? Like we should all be
1800.08s:  pissed about that. And the reason that are not the best in the world is because these guys have
1804.40s:  controlled the rule writing process for decades. And so they have created the system that is most
1810.64s:  beneficial to them and most profitable for middleman and not the one that you would create if you
1816.88s:  were designing markets over again and trying to create a system that was open and competitive.
1823.44s:  That's all we want. You know, that's all and all my advocacy work. All I ever do is say we just
1828.24s:  want open competition for order flow. And then we let markets work. This is not prescriptive regulation.
1833.68s:  This is not top down regulation. This is saying let's get an open competitive system. And that's
1839.12s:  where the best outcomes are going to be. And it's such a good game plan that they've executed though
1846.56s:  where for so long, they've even kept commissions. They've kept baseline fee.
1851.28s:  And that was the norm. And you know, the big disruption was now it's free. And to me,
1856.80s:  that always just felt like this highlights the margins they have. If they could just cut all these
1862.96s:  pieces out and still essentially be buying their fourth yacht for the year. That's right.
1869.28s:  I know that we're coming up on time here. I have two two last questions for you. One of which is
1873.60s:  the advent of zero DTE options, I know it's very niche. But I also know that you probably are
1880.24s:  at least peripherally familiar with most of this stuff. I'm curious from your background at Citadel
1887.44s:  and just understanding the way that markets work. What impact does that have on the fragility of
1894.24s:  markets, which is one of the terms you used just a little while ago. It's something that I've been
1898.88s:  tracking actually very carefully. A big part of my book is volatility trading. So I'm looking for
1903.68s:  stuff. But from your perspective, the just aerabolic increase, what does that do from the dealer side
1909.68s:  from the people who are making markets and whatnot, just this tonnage of volume in very short
1915.04s:  intraday options? So I mean, I think it looked, I have a limited understanding. I'll say that. My
1921.68s:  limited understanding is that most of the time those options expire worthless. And so most of the
1929.04s:  time they're losing bet, you could probably say it's much more kind of gambling than almost anything
1935.36s:  else in markets. And if you are an options market maker, so you're writing those those contracts
1944.56s:  and just collecting that premium is the greatest fucking thing that's ever happened to you. And you
1949.04s:  are thrilled. And yes, Citadel has long been the largest or one of the largest players in options
1956.08s:  market making. Susquejana is another big one. And those are two well placed political contributors
1964.96s:  as well and Ken Griffin and Jeff Yes. So you know, those guys are happy. Ken Griffin is buying
1974.40s:  more and more Florida land and building bigger and bigger houses. So I think that that's most of
1982.48s:  what you need to know about those. I, you know, it's not something I've played. I have bought
1988.64s:  one or two here there. We go. The general comes out. I have the degenerate streak in me. I got a bit
1995.28s:  of a gambler in me. I tried them out. Obviously, it didn't work. So, you know, as I'm sure most
2002.80s:  people's experience has been, but you know, look, you want to gamble with some money. I'm not going
2007.04s:  to judge you for like gambling's fun. I bought that. And you know, I bet on football mostly. And,
2012.48s:  you know, I play fantasy sports too. So, but I think if you're concerned about like wealth
2019.60s:  preservation, that's not what I would be doing. And you know, I think it's just important to recognize
2023.60s:  it for what it is. And also to know that, you know, most of the time, you're just kind of handing
2027.20s:  money over to the market maker. It's a great money. And I will say like your question about what
2032.80s:  are the impacts on markets? I think it's a very interesting question. And, you know, I'm not sure.
2038.56s:  I've read some interesting research. I think on a JP Morgan that talked about like, it was like
2045.20s:  some increase in convexity. But, you know, it's just not something I spent a ton of time on. But,
2052.16s:  yeah, it's weird. It's definitely a new thing. And, you know, I don't have a hard time believing
2057.84s:  that it's going to have weird effects on markets. And I've also read that it's actually, you think
2063.44s:  it's just a retail thing, but it's actually very much professional trader thing. You do have a
2068.80s:  lot of professional traders coming into that space now too. Yeah, definitely. And actually from,
2074.48s:  I think it was JP Morgan, they put out a study that also looked at order flow of different sizes,
2080.64s:  right? And then you can also use the smaller or price improvement programs to kind of delineate
2084.80s:  between professional and retail typically. And yeah, to your point, it is a joint party. And
2090.24s:  that's actually one of the cool things is if you trade volatility, if that's part of your book,
2094.16s:  there genuinely is opportunity there. Like if you're on the other side of the trade, right? And
2099.12s:  that's actually, yeah, that actually there's enough of an edge price then at this point and it's
2103.76s:  persistent. But, um, you'll have to be more about that. Oh, yeah. Well, the boring part, those,
2111.28s:  you know, you're already super good at quant shit. So it'll just be, you know, back to the napkin
2116.56s:  stuff for you. You don't really get to get that degenerate vibe going. Yeah. I'm thinking we need
2121.68s:  to find some yellow trades. Yeah. There you go. I'm down. But before we sign off, um, Irving's been
2128.96s:  making moves. I'm still obviously really involved with just working on content creation and, you know,
2135.04s:  the different pieces that are being put out, which I'm so, so stoked by I think it's incredible. But
2139.68s:  what's the latest and greatest from Irving that you want to share with folks? Yeah. So, um, we launched
2145.36s:  beta, um, I guess I don't know exact timing, but over a month ago, um, and it, it has just gone great.
2154.96s:  Honestly, like we had, it's, it's crazy. We had a beta wait list that was around 12,000 people
2160.72s:  when we launched. Um, and we ended up with some somewhere around, you know, 3000 users. And,
2169.28s:  at some point in the last two weeks, the word got out. Um, our beta wait list. I mean, I don't know
2175.52s:  what it's up to. It's over 120,000 now. Um, where we've got thousands and we, we announced it. We
2181.84s:  crossed 10,000 users last week. Um, I think we've crossed 14,000 actually today. Um, it's, it's
2189.52s:  awesome. It's really exciting. People are using the platform that posting in communities. They're
2194.40s:  doing some research. You know, it's, it's still early days. It's, you know, it is. It's a beta,
2198.56s:  they're bugs, but I think overall, um, we're pretty excited. We're, we're in a pretty, a pretty
2205.60s:  cool place where we've built something. We think it's pretty good. Uh, we think the data quality,
2211.20s:  especially is extremely high. Um, we're still working on integrating all the data sets we've got,
2217.52s:  but we've got a bunch in there. So if you're looking to do research on companies, it's good.
2222.08s:  We've got good stuff. If you're looking to follow news, our news feed is second and none.
2226.40s:  You're looking to track stocks, you know, connect your broker portfolio. That kind of thing. All
2230.88s:  that functionality is in there. Um, if you want to build a chart, you know, put a research thesis
2236.24s:  together and then embed that into a community post that can be done. Um, and, and so right now,
2243.20s:  you know, it's just we're, we're pretty happy with where we're at in beta and we're learning a lot
2248.08s:  from how people are using the platform. It's never what you think. Um, like you said, we're producing
2252.40s:  it. We're starting to produce a lot of educational content to help help people learn more about
2256.80s:  markets, which is, you know, sort of central part of our mission. Um, and I, I don't think I've
2262.56s:  ever been as optimistic on what we're building as I am today. I think that the rest of this year
2267.68s:  is just going to be fantastic. We're, you know, we're going to look to keep growing. We will start
2272.08s:  charging at some point for some parts of the site. Um, and again, I think that that's an important
2277.20s:  alignment of incentives, right? It makes it so that we are in, you know, you are a customer,
2281.68s:  the retail investors are a customer that's really important because then we're here to serve you
2286.08s:  versus other, you know, brokerjaps who don't make any money from, from directly from you,
2291.04s:  they make money off of you and they productize you. So that's, that's something that we don't want to do.
2295.84s:  Yeah. And one note on that for people, you know, I've been involved in the platform for a
2301.04s:  little while. I've had a chance to see the evolution of it. And it's really cool to me to see
2305.68s:  something that's turning into a generalized like one stop effective shop because there's so many
2312.96s:  pieces of bifurcated information across all these different websites and the way that like
2318.00s:  Irvin is able to consolidate these things and then to even cross pollinate with the communities.
2323.60s:  It's super cool. So if you guys aren't familiar with it, make sure you check it out. I'll have a
2327.36s:  link in the show notes below. But Mr. Lauer, I've kept you over. I broke my promise. But, you know,
2333.68s:  the conversation, why do you, that had to happen. Yeah, the conversation why it got to happen.
2338.80s:  So thank you so much for the time, man. It's been a pleasure. I'll grab some of the links,
2342.88s:  you know, that we talked about to throw in the notes below. But yeah, thank you so much for the time.
2346.32s:  Yeah. Anytime, you know, I love it and really appreciate your support for what we've been doing as
2351.28s:  well. And, you know, just look forward to coming back here and having you keep working with us too.
2356.24s:  So thanks and everyone listening. Yeah. Take care, everyone.
