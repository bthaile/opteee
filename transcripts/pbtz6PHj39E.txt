0.00s: All right, everybody, Eric here with part two of my favorite strategy, which is the cash
7.66s: secure strangle.
8.66s: I already introduced it in a previous video, talked about kind of how I like to set it up,
13.18s: what I look for, those kinds of things.
15.30s: Now what I want to jump into next is how do we manage the trade?
20.02s: So let's jump over to the main screen here and work through it.
24.10s: Question foremost, if you recall, we kind of did a little bit of a management tree on
30.86s: how the trade works out.
31.86s: So let's do that again real quick just to recap.
33.98s: First, I'm going to sell to open a put of some sort.
37.74s: And then one of two things is going to happen.
39.62s: The put is either going to remain out of the money, in which case I'll close for a profit
45.58s: and then sell another put and continue to do this circle here.
49.30s: Now, the other scenario is we can end up in the money.
53.62s: If we end up in the money, there again is a branch of two possibilities.
58.26s: The first one is we can roll the trade and based on how we choose to roll the trade,
65.62s: it'll either end up out of the money or it'll end up in the money, which we will continue
70.62s: this process here.
71.78s: We can roll for some time.
73.82s: I've rolled for over a year before, so you can roll for some time.
77.82s: Or you can choose to allow assignment.
82.94s: Now if we allow assignment, this essentially equals, we now have a long position.
88.90s: We own shares of whatever we sold to put on.
93.38s: So now there's another kind of two lane approach here.
98.18s: What will happen is we're going to create a covered call for the long shares.
104.62s: So this is where we're long shares and then we sell a call against the end.
112.86s: That's the shares.
115.18s: And then in this scenario, one of two things will happen.
118.54s: This will fall in, let's keep this side out of the money.
122.46s: Sorry, just to keep it the same.
124.14s: So this will fall out of the money.
126.14s: And if the calls remain out of the money, we just sell another one and then continue that
130.94s: loop here.
132.58s: Or the calls will fall in the money in which case will be assigned.
139.02s: And then we will lose the longs.
142.98s: So then what will happen is the call will fall off.
145.86s: We'll keep that profit.
147.50s: And then the long stock is sold.
149.02s: So we're going to sell the stock or sell the underlying at your strike price.
157.02s: Now let's go all the way back up here.
159.10s: We're also going to sell another put.
164.74s: And then this put here follows this put structure.
171.46s: These two is the same thing.
172.94s: So I'm just moving this one down here now in which case one of two things will happen
176.94s: out the money in the money and it just follows down this tree.
180.26s: So this is kind of our assignment tree or our management tree in an individual.
185.58s: So let's talk about the easy one.
187.94s: Let's first talk about this.
191.26s: I'm going to underline them so that they're kind of easier to see the different stages
194.58s: because I know the arrows might be a little confusing.
198.58s: So let's just break these out with those underlines.
203.78s: Great.
204.78s: Okay.
205.78s: So first, let's talk about this out of the money position here.
208.94s: This guy.
210.42s: If we are out of the money, the very first thing is if at any point in the trade, I have
217.30s: a 60% profit, I'm going to look to take it down.
219.82s: It doesn't mean I always will, but I'm going to look at it.
221.58s: I'm going to consider it very strongly.
224.18s: Now if I ever have a scenario where I've 80% of my max profit with greater than 50%
232.66s: days expiration on the original trade left, I will take that down.
237.82s: So let's say if I sell something with 40 days to expiration and then at 21 days to expiration,
245.42s: we have 80% or higher max profit, I'm going to take that trade down.
250.10s: The other scenario that can happen here is if I make 30 to 40% of the trade in less than
257.74s: two days, I potentially will take that trade off.
262.58s: Now the way that I approach the out of the money management depends a lot on the current
266.78s: market conditions, how I feel about the market at that point in time.
270.86s: If I feel that the market is stable, kind of continuing to climb, that sort of thing,
275.22s: like we've seen the last few years, very likely would just leave a position on longer.
279.94s: But if we're more in a market that we see now, I'm less inclined to do that.
284.14s: I manage positions a little more regularly so I can continue to realize profits in lower
289.66s: my outstanding risk.
292.14s: So that's kind of the out of the money that handles this leg right here.
297.50s: Now let's talk about in the money.
300.94s: So this is this leg right here.
305.50s: And then what I want to specifically talk about is this rolling portion, which is this
310.78s: side right here.
313.38s: So we already did this out of the money.
315.02s: Now we're assuming we're in the money and I'm not going to take assignment.
318.42s: I want to roll.
320.94s: I always know that the best role opportunity is going to take place when the strike price
327.62s: equals my short strike.
330.54s: So if I sell a put at a 10 strike, when the stock or when the underlying is trading around
337.58s: $10 is my best time to roll.
340.66s: The reason being is because you can still typically roll out of the money at that point.
346.98s: But I have some rules on how I approach this person foremost, I always, always, always
353.74s: make sure I get a credit for the rule always.
356.50s: If you don't get a credit, you're going to make this a very difficult trade to manage
361.34s: for the long term.
363.50s: The second thing is I monitor the size of my trade because when we roll, we know we're
370.66s: closing the front position and we're establishing a further out and time position that should
379.06s: cover the cost of closing this front position.
382.90s: So based on my assessment of the market, my current thoughts, I will look and adjust
390.04s: my size accordingly.
392.42s: For example, if I have a position that I put on with 40 days to expiration and with 35
400.26s: days left to go, it falls in the money, I'm not going to do anything.
404.74s: The reason being is I like to wait until about 20 days to expiration so that market is closed.
412.50s: So that I'm able to maximize my use of weekly contracts and not have to roll out an entire
420.94s: month.
421.94s: I try to roll out as little in distance as possible, typically.
426.94s: So if my strike is slightly in the money and there's 20 days left to go, something like
435.06s: that, I likely will roll that out to reestablish a new position, you know, 40, 45 days to expiration.
442.06s: However, instead of selling a five lot, I might only sell a four lot, but keep it at the
449.24s: same strike.
450.24s: I might take some of my position off, removing some risk from the trade.
456.06s: Let's say same scenario, I sold a 48 expiration option, we're at 22 days left to go and all
464.14s: of a sudden my option is far in the money.
468.50s: If I roll out in time, I'm collecting a very small credit.
473.10s: In that scenario, I might add some of the allocation I set aside for the trade so that I can add
480.90s: additional short puts and allow myself to roll closer to the money.
488.06s: So in that example, let's say if I sold five puts at a 10 strike and I might have, I'm
496.74s: the new position I established might have six puts at a nine strike or an eight strike.
504.10s: The goal is to move closer or out of the money.
507.86s: So size can be adjusted to add risk or reduce risk depending on what the objectives are at
514.02s: that point in time.
515.90s: Now the duration for the rules, I hit on a little bit to start.
520.86s: If I am wary of the market and concerned that it might come down or if I feel there's
526.30s: it's bottom heavy like I do right now, I try to let it get as close to expiration as I
531.74s: can so that I'm leaching all of the theta out.
535.50s: So I'm not buying back a whole bunch of theta when I roll the position.
539.78s: And once I get, you know, 14, 15 days to expiration in a market like this, I am going to
546.74s: try to roll out in time as little as I need to in order to roll down as well.
553.46s: So if I want to roll out and down, I might have to go two weeks or three weeks instead
559.24s: of just one.
561.74s: If I am thinking that the, you know, position is on the dance floor, I'm close, I might
567.80s: just roll out to the same strike a week later.
571.82s: And then the last kind of broad scenario is if I want to roll and I want to make sure
578.10s: I get out of the money, I might have to go further out in time.
581.26s: I might have to reestablish a new position in order to collect a new credit, you know,
586.02s: all the way up 40 to 45 days to expiration, something like that.
590.46s: And again, I'm going to do a scenario for most of these because I know I'm talking about
594.34s: a lot of hypotheticals and it might be confusing.
597.14s: So don't worry if what I'm talking about sounds a little abstract.
600.38s: We'll do an example, not on this video, but the next one.
603.10s: Okay, so let's jump over to kind of if we're going to allow assignment.
607.42s: This one's pretty quick.
608.94s: So once we get to the 20 day window, let's say again, we sold open five puts at the 10
614.78s: strike and we're at the 20 day to expiration window, we choose we want to allow assignment.
620.02s: Great.
621.02s: We're going to let the underlying continued to move towards its expiration.
626.18s: Now the week of expiration or whenever I see the extrinsic value of the option hit a
633.30s: nickel, I'm always going to reevaluate one more time.
637.14s: I'm going to say, okay, do I really want to let this go to expiration and be assigned
641.10s: or do I want to potentially roll this now?
644.18s: So that's kind of my last evaluation.
647.14s: Let's say if it hits that point, let me say, nope, I want to own the underlying pool.
652.02s: Once we own the stock, I like to sell a covered call.
655.58s: So what that means is I will take assignment.
658.34s: I'm now a long shares and I will sell a call above my basis always.
664.34s: So if I'm assigned at 10, I'm always going to sell at 10 or above.
669.22s: There may be times where I can't sell and collect a premium above my basis.
673.94s: That's fine.
674.94s: I will wait because if you go back all the way to the beginning, I already know I pick
679.06s: something I like to own, so I will wait.
682.30s: And then at the same time, I will always outlay an additional put below my strike.
689.06s: So if I'm at a short strike of 10, I might sell in 8 put or a 6 put or 5 or 7, whatever,
698.42s: something below my basis.
700.46s: So what this does is it allows me to scale into the trade, still collect a premium, and
706.56s: then if I'm assigned again, if I choose to allow assignment again, then in only then,
712.66s: my cost basis will reduce as my size increases.
717.58s: So if we sold that 5 lot and then now we're long 500 shares, and then if we sell a 3 lot
723.46s: cheaper, well, now we're going to be long 800 shares, but at a lower price.
728.66s: So that's why I like to sell the additional put.
731.78s: And then that's it.
733.38s: We're just going to repeat the put management until it's assigned again or more rolling
740.02s: or out of the money, just like the original diagram I shared, or we're going to keep
745.06s: going until that covered call is called away.
748.90s: Whenever the covered call expires worthless or is very close to expiring worthless, I might
753.50s: take it down and sell another one and just keep doing that over and over again.
758.30s: So this is my favorite strategy, the cash secure strangle.
760.30s: It's nothing to manage.
762.98s: There's a lot of management that goes into it, but it's not frequent.
766.94s: You know, I might put a trade on that has 40 days to expiration and adjust it once
771.50s: every two weeks.
773.02s: So there's a lot of thought that goes into the management, but it makes the execution
777.54s: very easy and systematic.
780.30s: So the next video I'm going to do are a few different examples of either historical
786.14s: trades I've done or I'll share some of the trades I have on now so that we can see
790.14s: what this looks like in practical application.
792.58s: So I hope this is helpful and I'm looking forward to exploring the strategy more with
796.22s: everybody.
797.22s: Talk to you guys later.
