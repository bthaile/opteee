0.00s: First off, my bad outliers, I realized that the video I did yesterday was like 20 minutes
4.96s: long.
5.96s: When I start talking about the markets, I kind of can do that.
8.96s: So my goal for today is to keep this a little more palatable for people.
14.28s: And I have two things I want to cover.
16.08s: Obviously, the tech leading sell-off will be the first thing.
19.40s: And then the second thing is we have some really, really interesting new data that's come
24.08s: out in GameStop specifically with this.
27.28s: And I want to talk about some of the homework that I started doing about this specific
31.40s: fund that supposedly holds a just tremendous number of shares.
36.00s: In this case, actually, technically speaking, it's more than the entire flow and then some.
40.60s: So there's some very specific things we can learn about that.
45.00s: And we'll get to that towards the end of the video.
47.04s: So let's start with the broad market, though, because there's important activity going
51.72s: on.
52.96s: Again, exactly what I've been talking about where I don't know which way the market
57.56s: is going to go.
58.88s: But for leading into this week and throughout last week, it just felt like we were in a bit
65.92s: of a rotational period where didn't have a sense where things were going to go, but
70.32s: it felt like we were going to break one way or the other.
73.84s: And one of the things that you've heard me note a few times as we take a look at the
78.20s: broad markets is that tech does not look good.
81.52s: And I've said that multiple times.
83.44s: So and I also in the context of wanting to unwind my teacher's position, which I finally
88.96s: got out of today.
90.64s: So this is looking across the S&P 500.
94.88s: We're looking across all of the individual sectors.
99.72s: And take a look.
101.04s: We see XLC communications going down hard.
105.36s: We see XLC technology going down hard.
110.28s: There's a couple others that are falling moderately so XLI would kind of be the next closest
116.16s: in the pack as well as XLB.
118.72s: But guess what?
120.32s: The same tickers I've been talking to you about are showing strength still hitting highs.
128.12s: XLP hit a new high XLR.
130.92s: Hit a new high XL you hit a new high XL V hit a new high XL F hit a new high.
138.44s: So this is the entire idea behind a sector rotation strategy.
145.56s: It's why I have exposure in real estate.
149.28s: It's why I have exposure in XLP products, individual tickers, not XLP itself.
154.92s: It's why I have exposure right now in XLF.
157.96s: And I also have exposure in XLE, which is not, you know, not really playing ball as much.
166.28s: You know, there's going to be one in the group.
168.00s: That's not doing what I wanted to do.
170.04s: But really, this is more of a individual strength play within the sector, even though XLE is
175.04s: not doing great.
176.04s: It's the NEM trade that I was reviewing earlier, which is doing still well.
180.72s: And realistically, even NEM, which is kind of funny because if we take a look at it,
185.40s: NEM is more related to gold, but it actually has a really high correlation to energy.
191.24s: So I will use this to kind of play both at the same time, the gold commodity in and of
197.20s: itself, but then also the energy sector because especially in short term correlations,
201.48s: this will tie very, very closely to energy.
203.88s: So it's a little bit of a duplicative play.
206.88s: So when I'm talking about it, tying to energy, it's not a direct play on energy.
210.92s: It's actually more of a direct play on materials, but it does carry over massively into energy.
216.72s: But right now, energy was down today and so was NEM, but materials also didn't fly
222.32s: off the shelf today.
223.32s: So kind of a little bit of both, I suppose.
225.96s: Now looking across the market, I continue to see the same thing I always do, opportunity.
231.04s: There are things we can trade to the upside.
232.44s: There are things we can trade to the downside.
233.84s: There are things we can trade sideways.
235.56s: X, L, Y, who's been trading sideways.
237.68s: So you can look in there for individual products that are just sideways trending.
241.28s: Same thing for XLE.
242.60s: Tons of things in there rotating sideways.
244.64s: Some things in there showing strength still.
246.44s: So I always try to remind people that whenever the market starts throwing some of these
252.16s: curve balls that we might feel some type of way about.
255.64s: Right.
256.64s: In videos down almost 10% today, 9.5%.
259.20s: That's literally a correction almost in a single day.
262.52s: That's not an insignificant move, especially on a gap down, especially following three preceding
268.84s: down days.
270.32s: This, I'm not going to lie, this looks uglier than I was expecting.
274.32s: I really am a bit surprised because after the earnings, I understood this move.
279.68s: I understood this move.
281.00s: These two to me looked like most people were getting shaken out of the position.
286.04s: And then the people that wanted to be in were going to be in.
288.80s: And then today there's just this big continuation.
291.40s: So one of the things to highlight here is that the markets, they do have momentum and drift.
297.96s: And that's kind of what you're seeing here.
299.60s: People, late comers to the party, people that were figuring out what they wanted to do with
303.48s: their portfolios and then submitting orders.
306.32s: It's just really interesting to me to see this starting to pair down so far.
310.24s: Now, really critical point here for me, if this does not start to base before we start
318.60s: getting down to kind of this level in here, I don't like that.
323.76s: And I don't like that specifically because even though we're starting to rotate down,
329.20s: if this begins basing here and creating a higher low, I'm still okay with it.
335.32s: We're still in an uptrend.
337.00s: It's obviously a correction from here at this point, but it's not egregious.
342.92s: This is still completely okay.
346.40s: What's not going to be okay is if this starts rotating down into this value area.
352.44s: And again, that doesn't mean immediately that we're falling out of bed, but that starts
357.12s: to, in my opinion, really, really call into question the strength of this trend.
361.72s: And all trends reverse at some point, at least temporarily.
365.70s: So we have this little bit of a double top almost, but we're starting lower highs, right?
370.98s: So there's our high, lower high, lower high.
374.06s: We have higher low than we come to lower lows, lower lows.
379.34s: So if this comes down to another lower low, that is, in my opinion, clear, clear sign that
386.98s: we're starting to rotate over on this trend.
390.06s: So for me, and I, I mean, I have no direct exposure to Nvidia.
394.94s: I don't care to.
395.94s: I'm typically trading things like T triple cues or NASDAQ futures, which both of those obviously
400.66s: have a ton of exposure to Nvidia inherently leveraged from the jump.
404.22s: But I'm seeing a lot of people getting really antsy to start buying into Nvidia.
408.14s: And I don't blame you, especially if you like the company long term, but as per usual,
412.58s: I always think wait for strength.
415.30s: There's no reason to buy it here at 108 if it's going to drop down to 91.
420.38s: We don't know where it's going to drop.
422.02s: But the way that I typically handle these is I'll literally just set an alert on both
426.22s: sides.
427.22s: So I'll be like, okay, if we get a break below here, that tells me we're continuing to
432.10s: the downside.
433.66s: If I get a break above here to the high of this candle, then I start liking it more to
438.58s: the upside and I can play it that way if I'm so inclined and still get it at a relative
442.42s: discount within that range.
444.50s: So it all depends on your trading style, your trading timeframes.
447.30s: But the one thing I try to remind people is when you buy things that a discount or
450.98s: typically a discount for a reason, Nvidia is a really interesting case here because I
455.14s: still think it's an incredibly strong performing stock, but it is rotating down like it's
461.34s: objectively the case.
463.06s: If you had bought up here or up here, you are currently down money.
466.62s: And again, if you're a long term investor, literally nobody cares.
469.94s: That's totally fine.
470.94s: And when I say nobody cares, it means this little down move.
472.86s: It's inconsequential if you're going to hold this for years.
476.18s: And I mean, if I had to bet, I absolutely would bet Nvidia will be worth more in a year
480.98s: or two years than it is today.
483.02s: But that's an investor's perspective where there's a giant opportunity cost for that capital
488.78s: being parked there that for me as a trader, I'm uninterested in.
493.18s: I want to trade things as they're doing things that I can tie along with.
497.50s: So for this, a little bit different approach.
500.70s: And again, you can see what I would do is just see, okay, which way do you want to
503.66s: break down or up?
504.86s: And then depending on that, if I want to get some sort of thematic reversal position
508.38s: to the upside, because that's what I would expect to see at some point, it just depends
512.10s: on where does the market decide that the floor starts to get priced in.
516.18s: And we don't know yet.
517.38s: So in video, very interesting case and very clearly just driving the tech sector down.
524.26s: And then when we look across the indices, there's still excessive weakness in IWM, down
529.54s: over 3% today, Hughes, tech heavy, down over 3% today.
534.74s: So these two really dragging.
536.34s: And the S&P 500 was only down 2%.
539.98s: So the S&P 500 continues to be propped up by all these other sectors.
543.86s: Now the question is, how long do they hang on?
546.42s: So for me, in the way that I trade, also I realize that the video is already nine minutes
550.06s: long.
551.06s: I'm doing the same thing I did yesterday, sorry.
553.86s: When I look at the S&P 500, it does look like it's maintaining at least some residual
560.26s: strength, but the question is for how long?
562.86s: And for me, with stuff like this, what I try to do now is keep a really sharp eye on
567.98s: everything that's propping up the S&P 500 right now.
570.90s: But again, are those same sectors that I was highlighting before?
574.74s: And if those start showing weakness or rotating over, and this continues to be the case,
579.50s: then I mean, that's essentially alignment to the downside, very difficult to slow down
584.38s: until people decide that there is value at that point and they want to buy back in.
589.22s: So that is what I am keeping a very close eye on.
592.58s: Now let's pivot over to GameStop because we did see some kind of interesting news today.
596.90s: From a trading perspective, we had a little bit of a gap up, which was nice to see that
600.58s: was kind of shunted pretty quickly, still continues this uptrend.
605.06s: So I'm digging that, no issues with it.
609.66s: And I don't, I think I still have my calls on.
613.06s: I haven't looked actually in a little bit to see what they're doing, but they're going
616.34s: to be coming up on soon that I have to do something with them.
618.86s: It's the short calls.
620.38s: Oh yeah, and for those that are wondering about the conversation before about Newmont
624.50s: and XLE, you can see in the shorter term timeframes, it correlates pretty heavily.
629.14s: So three days, 99% correlation, five days, 85% and then 10 days, 77%.
635.22s: So sometimes when I'm trying to trade the kind of both of those ideas in one ticker, Newmont
641.14s: is one that I will take a look at.
643.62s: Again, it's not like a pure energy play.
646.10s: So that's not what we were coming here to look at though.
648.22s: We were coming to look at GameStop.
650.38s: So if we take a look at the open interest, we have 560,000 calls against 269 on the put
656.86s: side.
657.86s: We're not quite two to one or maybe actually right about two to one, but it's still scattered
664.06s: all over the place.
665.30s: When I see what explorations are hot, it's actually not the six-sep.
669.10s: I'm seeing 13-sep starting to catch up a little bit here, but you'll notice like I'm
672.74s: seeing a lot of green, which is 18-Oct.
675.18s: I'm seeing a lot of 20-sep, which is this kind of salmon color.
680.86s: Then we have these gray boxes, which are further out in time, 17-GN 25.
685.10s: So we're just kind of all over the place, which just means that we don't have a clear
688.94s: chain that we're leaning on right now.
691.50s: When I look at volatility, this looks completely normal now.
694.46s: Short-term vol, 133%, 140% for earnings vol, right?
699.82s: Because we know earnings right now is still scheduled for the 10th after the market.
705.58s: So this is the interesting news that came out today though.
708.18s: This popped up, I think on Superstunk, and then a couple folks in the Discord brought
713.50s: it in there just because it's an interesting observation.
716.42s: And we see that we have this entity that essentially has what, $4 billion shares, which $4.7
726.30s: billion, which, you know, if you're, I'm not good at math, but there's not that many
730.16s: shares.
731.66s: So then what does this tell me?
732.94s: It tells me more likely than not.
735.34s: One, there could be some sort of reporting error.
738.42s: That can be the case.
739.98s: Now what I also would imagine to be the case here is this could just be use of derivatives.
747.10s: So when I took a closer look at the fund itself, this is the non-lending variation, which
753.14s: this one is the lending variation, just showing you that there's a difference between these
756.94s: funds.
758.06s: So there is a non-lending variant of this.
761.14s: That's not what this one is.
762.66s: This one that corresponds with this clearly says lending.
765.94s: So we can find the lending variation here and we can see this.
770.98s: The fund may make limited use of futures and or options for the purpose of maintaining
775.78s: equity exposure.
776.78s: This fund may participate in securities lending.
780.26s: A lot of questions.
783.62s: I don't have answers yet.
784.86s: So this is something I'm actually going to chat with Newton about a little bit because
788.86s: he might have a better sense on this particular topic than I do.
793.06s: I don't know if this is part of this kind of creation redemption cycle.
799.58s: I also don't know the way that these run because it's flagged as an index fund, which is
806.90s: fascinating because if you go to their website and we want to take a look at their funds,
812.74s: they have equity funds.
815.22s: And then if we break down these equity funds management style, there's actively managed
819.98s: funds.
821.70s: And then there's index style funds.
824.54s: The whole point of index style funds is they're supposed to represent an index.
831.54s: So it's very, very curious to me that we see this kind of structure.
837.46s: I don't fully understand what it is or why it is the way it is.
842.14s: The other thing that I can't find is just a ticker for this.
845.70s: If any of you all know what the ticker symbol is for this product, I would love to hear
850.34s: it.
851.34s: What the ticker is for this because as I go through their funds, I don't see anything
856.30s: labeled this.
857.30s: Right?
858.30s: So if I literally copy this directly, the terminology perfectly, I uncheck any filters,
864.38s: right?
865.38s: So that we're seeing everything that they have.
866.38s: I drop that in, nothing returns.
868.62s: So then I was like, okay, well, maybe somehow it's in something else.
873.10s: Maybe it's in this or the multi asset.
875.58s: So check out maybe the cash fund and see if there's anything in here.
879.86s: Obviously not.
880.86s: This is looking at typical security.
883.22s: So then let's go to multi asset and see if there's anything like this in here, which,
894.42s: again, this is, I just don't see it because this is talking about completely, like a completely
901.90s: different set of products, right?
903.26s: This is global tactical asset allocation.
905.98s: So this is using stuff from all over the place.
910.22s: So yeah, I'm confused.
914.22s: I don't know where this is on their website.
918.34s: So if anybody, maybe all funds, I didn't check in here yet.
923.70s: See, I don't get it.
928.74s: Maybe if I get rid of some of the extra tail in the words.
934.50s: Nothing.
935.50s: I guess I'm going through none of those are popping up.
940.54s: So I don't know where this is.
941.90s: I'm actually like, like, kind of, I'm kind of confused.
945.78s: So because I went to the website directly from here and I was trying to find the specific
952.34s: details for this, again, for this specific product so that I could try to look more closely.
958.42s: Because the other thing is, again, like if this is 1.56% of the fund and this is Uber
965.14s: technologies and we can figure out how much the fund is, 4.38 billion.
971.78s: So if we take handy dandy calculator, we go 438 billion, got to turn it sideways so we
976.86s: can get enough zeros that is million, there's billion, 4.38 billion.
983.50s: And then we just multiply that by 1.56 times 1.56.
989.58s: Oops, by 0156, my bad.
994.02s: Times point 0156.
998.10s: So it gives us 68 million, 68.3 million.
1002.10s: Why do I care about this?
1003.18s: Because I can figure out at least about what this is.
1011.54s: Right?
1012.38s: Because if this is telling me that in this fund, there's again, 68 billion dollars of
1020.02s: Uber, well then how does this other stuff fit into their fund?
1025.42s: Because this is telling me that they control 4.7 billion dollars of GameStop.
1031.34s: Which again, even if you're using derivatives, the notional exposure matters, which, I mean,
1037.14s: let's just do the math.
1038.14s: It's going to be significantly more than that.
1040.74s: So if we do 4.7 billion shares, I'm just going to round it.
1046.94s: So 4.7 billion times current market price, 23.
1052.98s: So 100 and 8 billion dollars, notional value.
1059.82s: So just something weird is happening here.
1062.62s: And again, I don't know what it is.
1064.98s: So this is something I intend to look more deeply into to try to sort this out.
1071.82s: And again, this is why for the people that are kind of like Eric, why do you spend time
1075.50s: looking at GameStop?
1077.18s: It is because of shit like this.
1079.22s: It's because this doesn't make sense.
1081.98s: I am not quite as far as like the full tin foil apes.
1086.38s: And I'm not jumping to the idea of like, it's all bullshit.
1089.94s: It's immediate manipulation.
1091.70s: So there's a solid part of me that looks at this and says, it kind of looks like manipulation
1097.06s: of some sort.
1098.06s: I don't know.
1099.14s: So then the objective part of my analysis wants to try to find an objective, an objective
1105.66s: output that I can prove, right?
1107.82s: Because I have my instincts, which says this looks weird.
1112.34s: But just because my instincts say that, I don't think those to the bank and just say,
1115.98s: yeah, it's all rigged.
1117.66s: Very well could be.
1118.82s: But I'm going to try and analyze it to see if I can find an answer, which right now
1122.62s: I don't have one.
1123.62s: I don't know what this is.
1124.86s: But I know just in terms of the notional size, it doesn't make sense relative to GameStop,
1129.22s: which leads me to believe based on again, this perspective that I cannot find this freaking
1133.62s: fund on their website.
1135.82s: But it tells me that they do use futures and options in that they might participate
1141.10s: in securities lending.
1142.10s: It's just weird, man.
1144.30s: It's just weird.
1145.30s: So yeah, just like I said at the beginning of the video, I'm so sorry.
1148.78s: Because here we are at 20 minutes again.
1151.22s: But these are just two really interesting topics to me right now that I want to understand
1155.02s: more deeply.
1156.02s: This one's going to take me some time because everything I look at with this, there's
1160.30s: no clear simple answers.
1161.78s: I actually just set up a call.
1163.62s: Well, I reached out to one of my friends who's a market maker because I'm literally going
1168.34s: to ask about this because I'm just curious how this kind of thing structures itself,
1173.26s: specifically with respect to the fund.
1175.10s: And he runs some different funds as well for white labeled clients.
1180.78s: And so I have a bunch of questions, not just about this, but also just about the creation
1185.38s: redemption cycle as far as he sees it from a market making perspective.
1189.06s: So this will be just another thing I'm adding to the list.
1192.50s: Last time I spoke with him, we literally spoke for like three and a half hours.
1195.22s: So it'll probably be a long conversation.
1197.18s: But hopefully I can learn a little bit more because again, this is why I'm fascinated with
1201.50s: GameStop is every time I look at it, there's some shit that's completely in the
1205.06s: anomalous to me that I don't understand and I want to learn.
1208.10s: And I'm learning a ton even with something like this.
1211.26s: It's a blast.
1212.26s: So as always, anything I should take a look at, let me know, be an outlier.
1215.74s: I will see you all later.
