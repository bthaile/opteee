0.00s: I want to talk to you about the ugly truth of growing a trading account to make you rich.
5.48s: 4,000 in 10 minutes, they traded NASDAQ. Let me show you how.
8.60s: So right here guys, we have resistance, right?
11.52s: So notice how it hit resistance.
14.20s: And this is actually when the market opened, right?
17.08s: I used to do a trade of market open. So it came back to resistance again with another rejection.
22.08s: When it had another rejection, that's when I got in.
24.76s: I mean, that's pretty much clear.
26.88s: Pretty much clear.
27.60s: I got in, and I just got in, I wrote it down for a quick one to one.
32.40s: And I was done for the day because it's Friday.
34.20s: I might done for the day because it's Friday.
36.72s: So what did we just see?
38.20s: We saw a masterful marketing exercise that is designed to gain your attention through a few things.
46.00s: Money fast, $4,000 in 10 minutes.
48.44s: That's a lot of money very quickly.
50.04s: You're also looking at this as something that's repeatable and easy, right?
54.48s: We just need a double rejection, apparently.
56.72s: And then it's going to go down, even if that happened 50% of the time, that would be great.
61.32s: The problem is it's not true.
62.40s: Everything about that is not true.
64.28s: And I want to talk to you about some of the aspects that are true.
68.40s: Most importantly, I want to talk to you about how to actually create a realistic plan
74.60s: to grow a trading account into your future wealth legitimately.
78.68s: So there's going to be some stuff in here that you're not going to like to hear
81.20s: because it's going to involve things like work.
83.16s: I don't like working.
85.68s: I don't want to work.
86.96s: Oh, who wants to do that?
88.60s: Problem is, is if you actually take some of this stuff to heart, you might stand a chance out there.
93.48s: If you attempt to apply, what that do just showed you,
97.28s: probably not going to work super great.
98.60s: And don't take my word for it.
100.56s: Let's actually look at some studies.
102.76s: So the very first thing we have a study called option trading and individual investor performance.
106.96s: This is not relegated to just options traders,
109.68s: but I talk to a lot of options traders.
111.64s: So I'm using this demographic, but at a price applies more broadly.
115.52s: So let's see what they found.
117.64s: It says our finding that single men with low income and little investment experience.
123.24s: That's kind of the target demographic of new traders here.
126.24s: And notice what they just said, single men, low income,
129.56s: that is a really important cognitive factor right out of the gate.
133.16s: There's desperation baked into this little investment experience.
137.64s: This means we're ignorant.
139.12s: We don't know what we're doing yet.
140.40s: We don't know what we don't know.
141.92s: Suggests that gambling and sensation seeking are important determinants of option trading.
147.72s: So what does this tell you that the people who are starting to try to trade options
151.84s: are looking to gamble and enjoy sensation seeking?
154.72s: What does this mean?
155.52s: This gambling, it means that we want to make a lot of money,
158.40s: asymmetric profit, potential in not a lot of time without a lot of effort.
163.12s: That is what gambling is.
164.88s: It doesn't take any effort to walk in and buy a lot of ticket
168.60s: or to sit down at a blackjack table if you're not actually attempting to create edge
172.44s: and count cards.
173.24s: It's not that difficult.
174.20s: So this is the demographic that we're talking to and guess what that video was geared directly towards.
181.80s: That this is the reality though.
183.84s: This person, this is the middle of June today.
186.20s: And this person is talking about that they were $8,000 away from reaching $100,000
191.28s: doubling their account, Chalker, sort of yo-load because I was bullish.
195.72s: And then let's take a look at the results and they're down $31,350.
200.36s: They almost doubled their account, but then they blew up.
202.60s: They're back essentially to their original principle if they chill out.
205.64s: But the problem is the revenge seeking side of their finance mine is going to start coming through.
209.72s: And my hypothesis here is if you give this a little more time,
212.68s: this will go down to just about $0.
214.68s: The point being, this is what that kind of behavior leads to in the long run.
220.52s: The problem is when you get these small snapshots of $4,000 in 10 minutes,
224.68s: you're like, oh shit, that looks pretty good.
226.60s: I'll tell you what, man, it looks good to me too.
228.36s: But the problem is as I was taught as a kid, if something seems too good to be true,
232.68s: it probably is.
233.88s: And we look a little deeper.
235.16s: Hence, from the study, a lack of knowledge about the risk and return characteristics
239.72s: in the use of options might be another explanation for the detrimental impact of
243.64s: option trading on investor performance.
245.40s: We don't know what we're doing.
246.28s: We're just winging it.
247.08s: And the problem is, since we're worried about the wrong thing,
249.56s: we're worried about gambling, we're worried about kind of these specific risk profiles
253.88s: that set us up for failure for most people they fail.
257.24s: But for you, for the outlier, this is beautiful.
260.60s: We want to see this, unfortunately, because this exists,
264.52s: this is precisely why there's opportunity for people that are actually willing
270.84s: to put in the work.
272.52s: That threshold of work is a safe haven for us.
276.76s: And again, the study's bare that out.
278.84s: Let me get myself out of your way so you can read as well.
281.16s: And it says, we identify a small group of sophisticated option traders who
285.40s: succeed in consistently outperforming other investors.
288.52s: That's possible.
289.08s: That's what this sums up to.
290.44s: It's hard.
291.16s: Most people approach it wrong and dork it up.
293.32s: But for the people who actually take this stuff seriously and apply themselves,
296.84s: it's possible.
297.72s: Fan, fantastic news.
299.56s: So now what I want to talk to you about is what's within the realm of possibility?
303.16s: How does this even all stack up?
305.08s: What's realistic to think of?
307.00s: And then most importantly, how do we accelerate our performance?
311.64s: I'm going to tell you exactly that.
312.68s: So in the bottom left, you see the spy, S&P 500 returns against my returns.
317.72s: We're looking from 2007 from when I started to the last full year, which is 2022.
321.88s: We're going to look at compound annual growth rate.
324.04s: Specifically, I also threw in an average there because people tend to ask that as well.
327.56s: I prefer compound annual growth rate because that tells us essentially on an annual basis,
332.52s: what is the average rate that our money is growing at as compared to just the average rate of
337.88s: return on capital year over year?
339.88s: And let's see what we have.
341.40s: The S&P 500 is returned to 8.5%.
343.72s: I have returned 20.4%.
346.20s: Context.
347.24s: I'm not a genius.
348.52s: I'm not stupid.
349.48s: I'm very middle of the road.
350.68s: I've worked incredibly hard at this skill set.
353.88s: While I was in high school, I started.
355.80s: While I was in college, I obsessed over this stuff.
359.32s: While most of my peers were chilling hanging out with friends, which is all good,
363.08s: I was in the lab working.
364.92s: The point being is over this time frame, I've spent over 30,000 hours trying to learn this skill set.
371.88s: So I'm trying to give you some sort of benchmark and to help with that benchmark,
375.96s: let's take a look at 2023 year to date.
378.60s: Again, this is the middle of June.
379.96s: The S&P 500 before today was up 13.6% and I was up 14.9%.
386.36s: For context about what the upper echelon looks like.
390.20s: If you look at the US investing championship, the top three people right now are at 122% return,
397.80s: 91 and 89% returns respectively.
401.00s: This is what the professionals rank at.
404.44s: This is what they're doing.
405.80s: This is what I'm doing.
407.16s: The average person doesn't outperform this even.
410.84s: They struggle to break even.
412.92s: So if we're looking at the levels to this game,
415.88s: you have pacing the S&P 500, which is already above average.
420.36s: Then there's me that outperforming the S&P 500,
423.72s: handedly, that's pretty far above average.
426.60s: And then there's the top desk tile.
428.60s: There are the people who are producing these kinds of returns and just blowing me out of the water.
433.40s: This is the professional athlete and I'm a semi pro in these results.
438.36s: But again, there's beauty in this because you don't have to be a professional athlete level
443.88s: to make a lot of money doing this.
445.80s: As a matter of fact, I'd never pursued these kinds of returns because for me,
450.44s: making money was never a choice.
452.36s: Figuring out how to create wealth was never a choice.
455.00s: I have people that depend on me.
456.84s: My single mother has no retirement.
459.40s: I need it to be in a place to make sure she would be taking care of as well as being able to take care of my family.
465.56s: So the point being is even without attempting to hit kind of this top line absolute best performance out there,
472.36s: you can still do really well if you apply yourself.
475.24s: Okay, so now that we have some ideas about what growth looks like,
479.64s: I want to talk to you about some of the return potentials here.
483.56s: And I want to start with a comparison.
485.88s: So on this right here, this is showing us at $2,500 initial principle,
491.32s: my account back in 2007, adding $0, not putting any more money in,
496.28s: getting that 20% return, which is essentially doubling the market again.
501.00s: Pretty proud of that.
501.88s: Over 15 years, we walk away with $38,500, not shit to talk about here.
510.20s: However, let's take a look at another scenario.
512.04s: Same thing, $2,500 bucks, 20% return for 15 years,
515.56s: except in this scenario, we are saving just $2,000 a month on average.
520.84s: Over that time frame, you walk away with $1.8 million at just $2,000 a month.
525.48s: To put this into context, my first job out of college was a marine officer.
530.20s: We got paid well, it didn't get paid great.
532.68s: The point being is the savings rate here is sliding scale,
536.76s: based on what you're able to produce.
538.36s: You might look at this if you're in your late teen saying,
541.08s: holy crap, that's more than I make an entire year in general.
544.20s: How can I possibly save that?
545.56s: Well, there's a few different things we could do to accelerate this,
548.04s: but just know this is on average, ideally,
550.92s: as your income grows, your savings rate should also grow exponentially with it.
556.84s: So in this case, if you can maintain a really good savings rate early,
561.08s: and then as your earnings potential grows, you start getting bonuses,
564.52s: you're not going out and getting bottle service, you're saving.
568.12s: And if you do that early on, you can walk away with a much better
571.96s: average monthly savings in this.
573.48s: I certainly have.
574.60s: But the point being is this is something that's attainable
576.92s: to most working professionals provided you make at least $50,000 a year,
581.24s: ideally a bit more, and you don't have any side hustles,
583.88s: which we're going to talk about because guess what?
586.04s: You should.
586.76s: So now let's kind of get into the details here.
590.04s: And I want to walk us through really what we've talked about so far.
593.24s: The first thing is trading a small amount of money,
596.20s: even with really good returns, is not going to become your future wealth most likely.
601.24s: We need to save.
602.60s: We need to save very aggressively.
604.44s: That's the ugly truth.
605.72s: The ugly truth is starting with the $10,000 account,
608.36s: and then watching that YouTube video about this double resistance bounce,
612.12s: and then making $4,000 every 10 minutes is utter bullshit.
616.04s: So then we need to make a decision speed and risk.
618.52s: The faster you want to try to make a bunch of money,
620.68s: the more risk you're going to have to take to get there.
622.68s: You have to figure out what's right for you,
624.12s: but that's a really important step in this process.
626.52s: But then we need to take a look at something like this.
630.28s: How can we accelerate this?
632.04s: It's simple.
632.76s: The first one is saving.
634.60s: The more aggressive you save early,
636.68s: the more your investible principle is,
638.84s: and provide it even if you get a median rate of return, you can do well.
643.40s: So if we save aggressively, we have a good savings rate, that's great.
646.68s: If we maintain that good savings rate,
649.48s: even as we increase our income,
652.36s: as we go from a young professional in our early 20s
655.72s: to a somewhat tenured professional mid to late 20s,
659.40s: and we maintain that aggressive savings rate
662.12s: as our income is increasing,
664.12s: you're talking about some serious money here.
665.88s: And this is just talking about a general job.
668.76s: If your only income is your W2 job,
672.28s: you are one bad season away from having no income and being poor.
676.44s: Bad approach.
677.64s: Think about your skill sets.
679.00s: Go do Uber.
680.12s: Go do Uber Eats.
682.28s: Think about different skill sets that you have
684.84s: that you can use to make money.
686.92s: That is probably one of the most important things
689.88s: you can do to really increase your savings overall
693.56s: is not to just rely on your day-to-day income,
696.20s: but find other ways to do this.
697.96s: For example, when I was in college,
699.48s: I used to buy broken cars,
701.48s: fix them because that's the skill set I have,
703.24s: and then sell them for a profit.
704.84s: That was a way for me to increase income
706.68s: while I was compounding the money I was saving.
708.84s: That's one example.
709.80s: But the point being is you have to get creative here.
711.64s: The more you want it, the more you willing to do.
714.12s: Problem is a lot of people talk about how much they want something,
717.24s: but when it comes time to put in that effort,
719.00s: all of a sudden you can kind of see how much they want it,
721.24s: which isn't very much.
722.36s: And then the last thing.
723.40s: Get good at trading.
724.52s: Really what I'm talking about when I say get good at trading
727.56s: is this part.
728.60s: Let me get this out of your way,
730.28s: so it's a little easier to see.
731.96s: And the stuff that I'm talking about here
734.20s: is your rate of return.
735.64s: I got good at trading.
737.48s: So 20% per year is fantastic.
739.80s: And it makes a massive difference
742.36s: in these different compound and growth scenarios.
744.44s: So if you figure out the skill set and you get good at trading,
747.48s: all of a sudden you can make pretty decent money
749.72s: and continue to accelerate that curve.
751.64s: But the punchline here,
753.64s: save.
754.12s: How to save.
754.92s: That is what is really going to get you
757.48s: from your small account to a million plus dollar account
760.68s: is saving.
761.48s: All of these other things belong there.
763.48s: Otherwise, you can't save your weight to wealth,
765.64s: but you've got to save in order to make this whole thing work.
768.68s: Do you have any questions?
769.56s: Throw them down in the comments.
770.68s: Don't forget, like, subscribe, share, be an outlier.
772.84s: See you guys later.
