 I want to talk to you about the ugly truth of growing a trading account to make you rich. 4,000 in 10 minutes, they traded NASDAQ. Let me show you how. So right here guys, we have resistance, right? So notice how it hit resistance. And this is actually when the market opened, right? I used to do a trade of market open. So it came back to resistance again with another rejection. When it had another rejection, that's when I got in. I mean, that's pretty much clear. Pretty much clear. I got in, and I just got in, I wrote it down for a quick one to one. And I was done for the day because it's Friday. I might done for the day because it's Friday. So what did we just see? We saw a masterful marketing exercise that is designed to gain your attention through a few things. Money fast, $4,000 in 10 minutes. That's a lot of money very quickly. You're also looking at this as something that's repeatable and easy, right? We just need a double rejection, apparently. And then it's going to go down, even if that happened 50% of the time, that would be great. The problem is it's not true. Everything about that is not true. And I want to talk to you about some of the aspects that are true. Most importantly, I want to talk to you about how to actually create a realistic plan to grow a trading account into your future wealth legitimately. So there's going to be some stuff in here that you're not going to like to hear because it's going to involve things like work. I don't like working. I don't want to work. Oh, who wants to do that? Problem is, is if you actually take some of this stuff to heart, you might stand a chance out there. If you attempt to apply, what that do just showed you, probably not going to work super great. And don't take my word for it. Let's actually look at some studies. So the very first thing we have a study called option trading and individual investor performance. This is not relegated to just options traders, but I talk to a lot of options traders. So I'm using this demographic, but at a price applies more broadly. So let's see what they found. It says our finding that single men with low income and little investment experience. That's kind of the target demographic of new traders here. And notice what they just said, single men, low income, that is a really important cognitive factor right out of the gate. There's desperation baked into this little investment experience. This means we're ignorant. We don't know what we're doing yet. We don't know what we don't know. Suggests that gambling and sensation seeking are important determinants of option trading. So what does this tell you that the people who are starting to try to trade options are looking to gamble and enjoy sensation seeking? What does this mean? This gambling, it means that we want to make a lot of money, asymmetric profit, potential in not a lot of time without a lot of effort. That is what gambling is. It doesn't take any effort to walk in and buy a lot of ticket or to sit down at a blackjack table if you're not actually attempting to create edge and count cards. It's not that difficult. So this is the demographic that we're talking to and guess what that video was geared directly towards. That this is the reality though. This person, this is the middle of June today. And this person is talking about that they were $8,000 away from reaching $100,000 doubling their account, Chalker, sort of yo-load because I was bullish. And then let's take a look at the results and they're down $31,350. They almost doubled their account, but then they blew up. They're back essentially to their original principle if they chill out. But the problem is the revenge seeking side of their finance mine is going to start coming through. And my hypothesis here is if you give this a little more time, this will go down to just about $0. The point being, this is what that kind of behavior leads to in the long run. The problem is when you get these small snapshots of $4,000 in 10 minutes, you're like, oh shit, that looks pretty good. I'll tell you what, man, it looks good to me too. But the problem is as I was taught as a kid, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. And we look a little deeper. Hence, from the study, a lack of knowledge about the risk and return characteristics in the use of options might be another explanation for the detrimental impact of option trading on investor performance. We don't know what we're doing. We're just winging it. And the problem is, since we're worried about the wrong thing, we're worried about gambling, we're worried about kind of these specific risk profiles that set us up for failure for most people they fail. But for you, for the outlier, this is beautiful. We want to see this, unfortunately, because this exists, this is precisely why there's opportunity for people that are actually willing to put in the work. That threshold of work is a safe haven for us. And again, the study's bare that out. Let me get myself out of your way so you can read as well. And it says, we identify a small group of sophisticated option traders who succeed in consistently outperforming other investors. That's possible. That's what this sums up to. It's hard. Most people approach it wrong and dork it up. But for the people who actually take this stuff seriously and apply themselves, it's possible. Fan, fantastic news. So now what I want to talk to you about is what's within the realm of possibility? How does this even all stack up? What's realistic to think of? And then most importantly, how do we accelerate our performance? I'm going to tell you exactly that. So in the bottom left, you see the spy, S&P 500 returns against my returns. We're looking from 2007 from when I started to the last full year, which is 2022. We're going to look at compound annual growth rate. Specifically, I also threw in an average there because people tend to ask that as well. I prefer compound annual growth rate because that tells us essentially on an annual basis, what is the average rate that our money is growing at as compared to just the average rate of return on capital year over year? And let's see what we have. The S&P 500 is returned to 8.5%. I have returned 20.4%. Context. I'm not a genius. I'm not stupid. I'm very middle of the road. I've worked incredibly hard at this skill set. While I was in high school, I started. While I was in college, I obsessed over this stuff. While most of my peers were chilling hanging out with friends, which is all good, I was in the lab working. The point being is over this time frame, I've spent over 30,000 hours trying to learn this skill set. So I'm trying to give you some sort of benchmark and to help with that benchmark, let's take a look at 2023 year to date. Again, this is the middle of June. The S&P 500 before today was up 13.6% and I was up 14.9%. For context about what the upper echelon looks like. If you look at the US investing championship, the top three people right now are at 122% return, 91 and 89% returns respectively. This is what the professionals rank at. This is what they're doing. This is what I'm doing. The average person doesn't outperform this even. They struggle to break even. So if we're looking at the levels to this game, you have pacing the S&P 500, which is already above average. Then there's me that outperforming the S&P 500, handedly, that's pretty far above average. And then there's the top desk tile. There are the people who are producing these kinds of returns and just blowing me out of the water. This is the professional athlete and I'm a semi pro in these results. But again, there's beauty in this because you don't have to be a professional athlete level to make a lot of money doing this. As a matter of fact, I'd never pursued these kinds of returns because for me, making money was never a choice. Figuring out how to create wealth was never a choice. I have people that depend on me. My single mother has no retirement. I need it to be in a place to make sure she would be taking care of as well as being able to take care of my family. So the point being is even without attempting to hit kind of this top line absolute best performance out there, you can still do really well if you apply yourself. Okay, so now that we have some ideas about what growth looks like, I want to talk to you about some of the return potentials here. And I want to start with a comparison. So on this right here, this is showing us at $2,500 initial principle, my account back in 2007, adding $0, not putting any more money in, getting that 20% return, which is essentially doubling the market again. Pretty proud of that. Over 15 years, we walk away with $38,500, not shit to talk about here. However, let's take a look at another scenario. Same thing, $2,500 bucks, 20% return for 15 years, except in this scenario, we are saving just $2,000 a month on average. Over that time frame, you walk away with $1.8 million at just $2,000 a month. To put this into context, my first job out of college was a marine officer. We got paid well, it didn't get paid great. The point being is the savings rate here is sliding scale, based on what you're able to produce. You might look at this if you're in your late teen saying, holy crap, that's more than I make an entire year in general. How can I possibly save that? Well, there's a few different things we could do to accelerate this, but just know this is on average, ideally, as your income grows, your savings rate should also grow exponentially with it. So in this case, if you can maintain a really good savings rate early, and then as your earnings potential grows, you start getting bonuses, you're not going out and getting bottle service, you're saving. And if you do that early on, you can walk away with a much better average monthly savings in this. I certainly have. But the point being is this is something that's attainable to most working professionals provided you make at least $50,000 a year, ideally a bit more, and you don't have any side hustles, which we're going to talk about because guess what? You should. So now let's kind of get into the details here. And I want to walk us through really what we've talked about so far. The first thing is trading a small amount of money, even with really good returns, is not going to become your future wealth most likely. We need to save. We need to save very aggressively. That's the ugly truth. The ugly truth is starting with the $10,000 account, and then watching that YouTube video about this double resistance bounce, and then making $4,000 every 10 minutes is utter bullshit. So then we need to make a decision speed and risk. The faster you want to try to make a bunch of money, the more risk you're going to have to take to get there. You have to figure out what's right for you, but that's a really important step in this process. But then we need to take a look at something like this. How can we accelerate this? It's simple. The first one is saving. The more aggressive you save early, the more your investible principle is, and provide it even if you get a median rate of return, you can do well. So if we save aggressively, we have a good savings rate, that's great. If we maintain that good savings rate, even as we increase our income, as we go from a young professional in our early 20s to a somewhat tenured professional mid to late 20s, and we maintain that aggressive savings rate as our income is increasing, you're talking about some serious money here. And this is just talking about a general job. If your only income is your W2 job, you are one bad season away from having no income and being poor. Bad approach. Think about your skill sets. Go do Uber. Go do Uber Eats. Think about different skill sets that you have that you can use to make money. That is probably one of the most important things you can do to really increase your savings overall is not to just rely on your day-to-day income, but find other ways to do this. For example, when I was in college, I used to buy broken cars, fix them because that's the skill set I have, and then sell them for a profit. That was a way for me to increase income while I was compounding the money I was saving. That's one example. But the point being is you have to get creative here. The more you want it, the more you willing to do. Problem is a lot of people talk about how much they want something, but when it comes time to put in that effort, all of a sudden you can kind of see how much they want it, which isn't very much. And then the last thing. Get good at trading. Really what I'm talking about when I say get good at trading is this part. Let me get this out of your way, so it's a little easier to see. And the stuff that I'm talking about here is your rate of return. I got good at trading. So 20% per year is fantastic. And it makes a massive difference in these different compound and growth scenarios. So if you figure out the skill set and you get good at trading, all of a sudden you can make pretty decent money and continue to accelerate that curve. But the punchline here, save. How to save. That is what is really going to get you from your small account to a million plus dollar account is saving. All of these other things belong there. Otherwise, you can't save your weight to wealth, but you've got to save in order to make this whole thing work. Do you have any questions? Throw them down in the comments.
