372.00s:  you
374.00s:  I
377.00s:  sick
380.00s: SA
382.00s:  and that jacked up the probability of a Fed rate cut
386.76s:  in the near term, it's about the same as what it was prior.
389.80s:  What this also tells you is how sensitive
395.48s:  the market is to this data.
397.64s:  The fact that the market had the update
400.12s:  that it did today on essentially no change is really telling.
406.04s:  And this also, if you're not reading in between the lines here,
409.72s:  if we do see an elevated print of inflation,
415.20s:  I fully expect the market to have a pretty nasty visceral reaction.
419.88s:  I actually had two different sets of trades primed for today,
424.64s:  depending on which way this thing went.
426.92s:  And it's simply because I thought whichever way it went,
431.44s:  it was likely to give us a pretty strong day up or down either way
436.32s:  and then probably into tomorrow,
437.80s:  I've taken about half the trade down,
439.60s:  but that's still my sentiment.
441.64s:  The other thing is I got the McLaren back today
445.64s:  and I was doing some things in the engine
448.28s:  after bringing it home, getting it reset back up.
451.64s:  And because I'm like disgustingly impatient,
454.28s:  rather than waiting for the engine to cool off,
457.52s:  I immediately start going into the car.
460.20s:  So now my hands have these burns all over them.
463.64s:  It's always funny to me how as a grown adult,
469.84s:  this, it did even like surprise me.
472.88s:  I knew what I was going into and I was just like,
474.80s:  yeah, I'm probably gonna burn my hands
476.76s:  and I was just like, still did it.
479.20s:  This is still a good idea.
481.00s:  Taking that back to the broader market,
484.28s:  it seems like the market is kind of willingly burning
488.40s:  its hand right now.
490.04s:  And I think until we get a material change
496.56s:  in terms of upside, it just seems like the downside
502.36s:  is so much more favored by the broad market
506.20s:  and broad market movements.
507.88s:  Even the move that we saw today,
510.52s:  I would feel pretty confident wagering
513.08s:  that if this had gone the other way,
516.76s:  that we wouldn't have seen this similar size down move,
521.44s:  I think it probably would have been exacerbated
524.04s:  to the downside.
524.88s:  Now maybe not in cues, tech would probably be
527.64s:  a little bit insulated from it,
529.60s:  but you probably would have seen
531.04s:  a little bit more of a continuation in it
533.16s:  is compared to something like, buy.
537.64s:  So what this tells me
541.04s:  and the way that I position going forward is good news,
545.92s:  is okay news, bad news is probably going to be terrible news.
551.52s:  That's my expectation.
554.08s:  So it's going to be playing a lot
557.20s:  of that kind of visceral short term reaction.
560.64s:  We actually talked a little bit about a recent trade.
564.24s:  We talked about this on the pro stream yesterday,
566.64s:  but to give you a quick insight into that conversation,
569.76s:  I discussed a trade in RGTI that's still on.
573.16s:  And we spent a while on the stream yesterday
576.32s:  discussing the approach of trading reversals.
582.16s:  And there's a lot of nuance that goes into it,
584.32s:  but it can be really, really lucrative.
585.84s:  And I think that the market condition
587.96s:  that we're in right now heavily favors that kind of trading.
593.64s:  And it's because we have this volatility injection,
596.16s:  we have people that are obviously overlavered,
599.44s:  we have a ton of emotional movements in markets
604.12s:  happening right now on short term positioning and sentiment.
606.88s:  That leads to huge opportunity on things like this.
610.76s:  Now again, like I was talking about yesterday on that stream,
614.72s:  I didn't know it was going to be RGTI.
616.00s:  I'm not like some clear, voient dude.
618.04s:  I literally looked at quantum computing.
620.64s:  I conducted an analysis based on the relative movement between them
624.24s:  and then I played the intraday move, right?
626.96s:  And we actually discussed another pro members recent trade
631.68s:  in RGTI where they had bought, well, now two days ago,
636.04s:  on this down day, which I did not do.
638.36s:  And there's a bunch of reasons why I don't do that.
640.84s:  My entry was specifically on this day,
643.80s:  but all that stuff aside,
645.48s:  I wanna just share the broader point from the Patreon stream,
649.80s:  which is shifting your approach to suit
654.72s:  current market conditions is one of the most effective ways
659.88s:  to maintain optimal risk to reward trades.
666.56s:  Back to what I was talking about a second ago.
669.24s:  I do not think we're in a market condition
672.32s:  where positive drift is going to be the story.
675.96s:  There still would be some elements of positive drift,
679.40s:  I would wager, but based on the movement that we saw today,
683.16s:  the market and market participants are kind of showing their hands.
687.12s:  And what they're showing is that this is visceral.
690.40s:  This is visceral reactions that you're seeing.
693.04s:  And that matters because the way that I,
696.52s:  and maybe other people might consider trading
699.48s:  in these different market conditions very greatly based on that.
704.32s:  And again, looking for opportunities and stuff like this.
707.60s:  So the broad market today, really, really interesting.
710.24s:  And I think it was, it told us a lot.
713.44s:  I really think it told us a lot.
715.36s:  Yo, I cut my nails earlier today.
722.84s:  I missed one.
724.92s:  What was going on in my brain that I missed a nail?
728.60s:  How do you cut nine out of 10 nails?
734.08s:  What the fuck?
738.48s:  Gonna have to punish myself for that because that's ridiculous.
741.32s:  How do you miss a fucking nail?
744.04s:  That's literally absurd.
748.44s:  Unbelievable.
749.80s:  All right.
751.20s:  That's hard aside.
756.24s:  S and P 500 solid day, cues solid day, small caps.
762.08s:  Me, small caps had a me day.
764.96s:  They did okay.
766.28s:  But there's still in this really ugly consolidation phase
770.88s:  down here from essentially the lows that they posted in mid-December.
775.88s:  Whereas again, if you take a look at S and P 500,
779.32s:  if you take a look at cues,
781.08s:  they're still trying to fight this recent trend reversal.
785.48s:  I am really sus that they're going to be able to successfully do it.
790.16s:  I really am.
791.28s:  I want them to.
792.12s:  I'm positioned for them to, but I'm super sus on the likelihood and probability
796.96s:  that they're going to genuinely.
798.76s:  And the reason why I'm so sus on this is,
802.92s:  I mean, it's just such a well-defined downtrend.
807.56s:  Take a look at the price movement as it started approaching this trend line.
811.72s:  And again, the trend lines, they're just fucking lines on charts.
814.96s:  Right.
815.96s:  It's not dictatorial, but I cannot help but find that interesting.
820.52s:  And when I'm conducting trend analysis like this,
825.60s:  my disposition is to favor the dominant trend
831.60s:  until there is a clear reversal.
834.96s:  This is not a clear reversal.
838.16s:  If we go back into spy,
842.84s:  this is not a clear reversal.
845.40s:  This looks like a bit of a recovery within this trend,
851.40s:  but until this actually breaks above,
854.16s:  you can see the level that I have drawn, 5.9748.
857.44s:  It's got to be above that.
858.80s:  That's when it actually starts breaking this prior local lower high.
865.36s:  It's not done that yet.
867.28s:  So that's also why at this point,
869.60s:  I still generally favor the downside because it's not given me a reason not to yet.
875.84s:  Still, I'm positioned bullish.
878.72s:  And the reason why I'm positioned bullish is because I have those
882.24s:  leveraged coverage strangles on both the actual portfolio
886.40s:  and then the subset that I've been sharing with you guys.
889.12s:  And I just made some adjustments to the Bitcoin trade,
893.60s:  which I can share.
895.28s:  I probably just do a video on it like at the end of the week recapping all that stuff.
898.72s:  Maybe tomorrow's some shit.
899.76s:  I don't know.
901.04s:  But I think it's too early to be like, yeah, okay,
908.72s:  market looks like it's starting to turn around rallies back on.
911.84s:  I genuinely don't think that yet.
913.04s:  I think it's way too early to tell.
914.48s:  I think we need to see how this plays out.
918.56s:  And then I think we need to see how we deal with this local high.
922.56s:  Depending on how we deal with this local high,
925.84s:  then we can have a conversation of if it's going to just continue a wider
930.80s:  consolidation, slash basing.
934.32s:  But this so far still is not super healthy.
937.44s:  Where did it start the year at?
939.76s:  This was the start of the year.
941.04s:  So it just finally ticked positive for the year.
943.76s:  What's the market up on the year right now?
948.00s:  Wapping 0.58% up on the year.
953.12s:  Not super solid.
955.28s:  So yeah, opportunity, tons of it have to be selective.
962.80s:  Lauren says, why is the energy sector doing so well?
965.44s:  First of all, really good observation.
967.60s:  Genuinely, the reason why that's a good observation is because
971.04s:  part of our jobs as traders is to look for themes within the market and to decide how we
977.28s:  can potentially trade them.
979.04s:  So what you've just identified is what's called a defensive sector.
982.88s:  More often than not, money will rotate into defensive sectors during broader market
988.40s:  downturns. It moves away from things with really high PE ratios, which require strong growth
995.28s:  in order to sustain the value.
997.44s:  And we move into lower PE ratio names, things like energy.
1002.88s:  So that's exactly what you're seeing.
1004.48s:  Defensive stocks like that tend to perform much better during broader market downturns.
1010.08s:  And it's not just energy.
1011.44s:  There's a couple of other sectors that can get bucketed into that.
1014.56s:  And you can see that if you conduct some basic trend analysis here, right?
1019.68s:  So you can see energy definitely is leading the leading the charge, so to speak.
1026.96s:  But you can also see health care on a relative basis is absolutely showing some strength as
1032.88s:  compared to some of the other sectors, which are not.
1035.44s:  Now the other thing that's going on today that's different than before.
1039.28s:  Also, I realize I don't have my notepad open to capture the timestamps for this.
1044.16s:  So my bad, you guys are just going to be SOL on timestamps on this one.
1049.04s:  Maybe I'll just do it going forward.
1052.00s:  But I think you can see financials here.
1059.12s:  And financials are doing super good.
1062.72s:  And they had a really great earnings release today, which I want to talk about.
1069.68s:  Dark Mark says the Coke nail.
1072.24s:  Honestly, this would be, I've never done cocaine.
1075.36s:  And this would probably be the right amount though on this nail because the nail,
1081.04s:  I can't have nails that protrude past the finger.
1083.28s:  Like that's craziness.
1085.04s:  So this nail is already light years too long.
1087.84s:  But yeah, this would be a interesting Coke nail.
1091.92s:  Also really big finger in terms of width.
1095.36s:  Are you supposed to put it like up your nose?
1097.04s:  You're do you just sniff it out of your nail?
1100.00s:  So I wouldn't want to put a middle finger up my nose.
1102.88s:  I'm already ugly enough.
1104.32s:  I don't need to start like fucking stretching holes out on my face.
1108.80s:  So yeah, I don't know about that, man.
1111.44s:  But we'll see what it can be.
1118.24s:  Dark Mark says, or if you play guitar and yeah, no need for Coke,
1121.20s:  I do not play guitar.
1122.24s:  My best friend does.
1123.12s:  He tried to get me into it.
1124.32s:  I am so not interested in music.
1126.96s:  It's not funny.
1128.00s:  I enjoy listening to it.
1129.36s:  Big fan of all different kinds of music.
1131.92s:  But I really, really, really just couldn't.
1136.16s:  There's not a fiber in my body that could care at all about playing music.
1139.52s:  Just don't care.
1140.64s:  Just don't care.
1142.48s:  Cool.
1143.12s:  I respect it.
1143.92s:  But yeah, I couldn't possibly care less about it.
1147.52s:  All right.
1147.92s:  So now we're at 19 minutes and 10 seconds.
1151.04s:  We already did kind of like a market recap.
1155.28s:  Let's talk about.
1159.44s:  We already kind of did.
1160.48s:  I guess we'll just do a quick sector analysis.
1163.04s:  I actually talk about the individual sectors because we already started talking a little bit about this.
1167.68s:  So within the individual sectors, as Lauren looks like
1174.72s:  pointed out, energy is still doing well.
1177.52s:  One of the notes about energy, though, is that it's still in a broader downtrend.
1182.16s:  The reason why that matters for something like XLE is because before we go starting like,
1187.68s:  oh, shit, this is where the new strength is.
1190.16s:  It's up strong.
1191.84s:  It's up 10 points.
1193.12s:  It's up 10%.
1194.64s:  But wait, just says Bitcoin ad, how'd you get a bit that literally the fucking ads are off?
1201.04s:  Or was it when you joined?
1203.60s:  I literally haven't completely turned off.
1205.76s:  There should be zero ads for anybody.
1211.60s:  I wonder if it still does pre-rolls.
1214.16s:  That's super annoying.
1215.44s:  Do you take us as yes, you put your finger as far into your nose as you can before you snore,
1221.60s:  helps get the helps get to the blood faster.
1224.96s:  Yeah, then I, yeah, then I fucked that up.
1228.56s:  I left the wrong nail entirely because yeah, this, I don't, like, I don't even think you can
1234.00s:  get knuckle deep on that without maybe tearing something.
1236.64s:  I'm not trying to tear a nostril.
1239.84s:  This is still a broader downtrend.
1242.96s:  So we have to wait and see when this challenges this.
1249.28s:  The time to get into defensive names is when the market starts to roll over.
1255.84s:  Joe says, what are we talking about?
1257.20s:  Dude, you gotta, you gotta keep up.
1260.32s:  If you guys don't know, I have the, I don't know if it's an ability or maybe a mental
1266.80s:  affliction, but my brain can decisively just swap between subjects with really very little,
1276.00s:  very little pause or need for transition.
1278.56s:  I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing to be honest.
1280.96s:  It might be a bad thing.
1282.40s:  But first we were talking about market recap, then we were talking about energy.
1287.60s:  Before then we were doing a callback to my surprise that I missed cutting a fucking nail,
1294.48s:  like an absolute imbecile.
1297.92s:  And then we started talking about doing different kinds of,
1302.80s:  I don't know if I could say the word on YouTube, I really don't.
1306.80s:  So then we talked about burning my hands.
1309.92s:  We've been all over the place.
1311.44s:  So we're going to get back to the market though because I don't really think anybody gives,
1316.32s:  I mean, if anybody wants to start to go fund me,
1319.92s:  to help me compensate for the burn wounds while I was working on the McLaren after I got it back
1326.16s:  today, I mean, that it sounds like I might need to go fund me.
1332.24s:  I'm going to try to get through it.
1334.24s:  But yeah, that would be good.
1337.84s:  I always find that kind of interesting.
1339.20s:  There's a bunch of people that are on the internet that are in like the finance space.
1345.44s:  And they start go funds, go fund me for stuff.
1351.28s:  And I always think like, bitch, aren't you supposed to don't you have money?
1357.84s:  Why are you asking people for money?
1360.96s:  You should have it.
1362.56s:  You're talking about it.
1364.00s:  I don't get that.
1365.44s:  So I just got to jump on that bandwagon, I think, because yeah, I have some slightly annoying
1373.36s:  minor trivial burns that bother me to literally the slightest degree, especially when I bend my hand like this.
1382.64s:  So I'll start to go fund me for that.
1386.24s:  All right.
1387.76s:  Back to the sectors.
1389.20s:  So let's actually take a quick peek within the sectors,
1391.52s:  though I had a sheer curiosity, because there were a couple names within energy that we've
1395.52s:  stumbled into before that have continued to show strength.
1403.92s:  Dark Mark says they're long nail habits got the best of them.
1407.76s:  You people really do it off a nail?
1410.08s:  I've heard that before, but like, is that actually a thing?
1414.32s:  I thought that you do like lines or something.
1423.36s:  Actually off a nail.
1427.36s:  That's crazy.
1428.32s:  I don't understand why.
1429.84s:  I'm like, why off a fucking nail, dude?
1437.84s:  Where am I going here?
1438.72s:  I was where I'm trying to go.
1443.36s:  Dan says so much curiosity about Coke.
1446.40s:  If you Dan, I don't know how many streams you've been on, but again, I don't know if this is
1452.72s:  another pro or con about Eric, but I am so curious about everything.
1459.20s:  I don't fucking know why.
1460.80s:  I am super curious about everything.
1465.68s:  It really doesn't matter what it is.
1468.80s:  I typically am curious about it.
1471.68s:  Yeah, even that, even when I was in college, and I was being, I did zero drugs in college,
1478.56s:  because I had a scholarship and I didn't want to lose it.
1482.24s:  I used to hang out with some friends in a quad next to me, and they were all into drugs.
1489.84s:  Not like terrible drugs.
1490.96s:  I don't think I think they mostly did just like pot and whatnot.
1498.40s:  I used to hang out with them and just learn all about it.
1501.44s:  It's fucking interesting.
1503.20s:  The fact that there's a plant that grows that does that, and then people have found a
1508.40s:  way to ingest the plant and experience different effects from the plant.
1513.28s:  It's just super interesting to me.
1515.44s:  Specific parts of the plant.
1517.12s:  You don't want all of the plant.
1518.88s:  Crazy.
1520.48s:  Travel says, how did curiosity work for being a marine?
1522.88s:  Really good.
1524.96s:  It works really good for being a marine officer.
1528.08s:  If you're in enlisted marine, it's not good.
1532.32s:  At least a junior enlisted marine.
1534.08s:  As a junior enlisted marine, your job seriously is just to shut the fuck up and do what you're told.
1540.88s:  A lot of that just, it's not that they have no ideas or anything like that, but in the broadest
1546.48s:  context, young Marines like that, they need to get that part dialed in first before we start
1554.64s:  turning to them for idea generation and for weighing in on things.
1558.24s:  As soon as you start picking up NCO and stuff like that, most of us have very open conversations
1569.04s:  with our NCOs.
1570.64s:  Even if it's a corporal, because Marine Corps, we treat our corporals with a lot of respect.
1575.68s:  I don't know now what the new Mar admin that came out that's automatically going to have people
1580.08s:  promoted to corporal.
1580.88s:  That might slow that down a little bit.
1583.44s:  But we treat our corporals as of right now.
1586.96s:  They're a fucking NCO.
1588.08s:  So there's expectations here.
1592.32s:  I think like anything though, curiosity does have to be controlled, especially for somebody
1598.32s:  like me. This is actually why a lot of people that are in the mentoring program or when we talk
1603.60s:  in the discord, you will hear me re-center you and ask, what are we trying to solve for right now?
1611.52s:  Because sometimes our natural curiosity can start to pull our attention in different
1619.20s:  directions that may or may not ultimately lead us towards completing our objective.
1625.52s:  And it's super important to know that because then you have to mentally bucket what you're
1629.60s:  doing in different ways. You'll have part of your mental bucket that says, I'm going to spend time
1636.16s:  learning this because I'm interested in it. And that's secondary.
1640.16s:  The primary is whatever you're researching and whatever moves the needle towards the actual
1646.24s:  outcome that you're attempting to get to. That's super, super important.
1652.32s:  Okay. Now let's take a look at the actual sector performance.
1660.24s:  And 27, 40 sector performance.
1669.12s:  What do you notice here? Before I tell you what you should notice, you tell me what do you
1673.20s:  notice here? There's a couple things that should jump out to you. They should jump out to you,
1680.24s:  kind of like that dude from the hangover that popped out of the trunk of that car.
1690.40s:  It's probably one of the greatest scenes ever.
1696.16s:  I think there's a gif of it.
1701.52s:  How do you play this?
1706.64s:  Yep, here you go. This should jump out like this.
1720.24s:  We'll stretch us as a naked man is one of Eric's favorite scenes ever.
1726.56s:  Yeah. Fucking duh.
1730.56s:  Like Joe, you've known me well enough by now to know that like everything that I do is
1739.44s:  dominated by dudes, the Marine Court dudes, martial arts dudes, djitsu dudes, car dudes, rugby,
1748.16s:  dudes, it's all fucking dudes. I think about that actually pretty regularly that I would be
1756.24s:  in such a better position if I was just straight up gay because I, everything I do puts me around
1764.32s:  super cool people that do shit that I like. Now I got really fortunate with my wife, very, very
1769.68s:  thankful, but that was through a dating app. Really thankful for a dating apps.
1774.16s:  Recess chess equals dudes. chess is also dudes. Great fucking point. That yeah, that's exactly it.
1783.36s:  That's exactly it. Rudy says, hey, everyone, Eric, do you want to see an indoor pro match in
1788.80s:  ocean side Friday? I'm honestly not well, well, let me, let me, let me keep it a bug. I don't give
1802.16s:  a flying fuck about, wait, are you playing like what I be hanging out with you or is it to watch
1809.76s:  you play? Because either of those have definitely interested, but if it's just for her and I to go,
1814.88s:  I could fuck, I don't give a fuck to watch sports. I have so much other shit to do.
1820.56s:  A F. Oh shit, that's a tough ass name. A Fio. Oh, hold on. Let me see if I can get this right.
1832.88s:  A. Oh fuck. A.O. in a phoenix. A. A. Jesus. This one is kicking my ass.
1859.20s:  Normally, I can at least a non-seate. Hold on. A. E. F. is a. F. O. I. N.
1871.44s:  O. N. A. F. O. N. A. F. O. N. A. F. O. N. A. F. O. N. That's my take. Just like that.
1883.60s:  That's my best possible guess. If anybody knows how to actually say that, I would love to know,
1889.68s:  again, general curiosity, because I don't fucking know.
1895.84s:  Lauren says, Jotato, I couldn't figure out if I was in or not. Apparently, I missed the questions
1899.28s:  of some shit. Dude, you're so lucky, Lauren, that I'm the one that caught you because I have a few
1904.00s:  mods that helped me that are awesome. But we have such a little load tolerance for like lazy entries
1912.24s:  that don't pay attention to simple instructions. Like if you can't follow simple instructions,
1916.24s:  that discord's not for you. That's just the facts. But I also know that discord is really weird
1921.60s:  to a lot of people. So anyways, I saw that you joined and I saved you because you did what most
1928.40s:  of the fucking bots do, which is just drop a random fucking thing, which is hilarious.
1937.20s:  Lauren says, there were no instructions that I saw. Are you kidding me right now? You would have
1944.48s:  had instructions DM to you. And then in this section here, in this section here, where it says
1956.64s:  start here, the idea behind start here is you start here. So then when Lauren decided to join,
1973.68s:  this is an adm. Lauren, I'm just saying you would have got double tapped.
1978.40s:  Yeah, definitely don't DM. Definitely don't DM on discord. Let take a look. Take a look at Lauren's
1984.00s:  intro. Look, the fucking bot. This is a straight, this is straight bot behavior. 100% bot behavior
1996.32s:  did, did not trust at all. Period. But I knew who it was. So you got to pass Lauren. Like I said,
2007.68s:  it's another weird, Tism thing about me. But I typically am way more lenient with females than males,
2016.56s:  don't know why I just them. Just kind of how it goes. And I realized we had somebody at the
2028.80s:  join. All right. Let's get back to business. There's actually something important that I do
2043.04s:  want to show you guys from here. Now I have to update this time again, because we still haven't done
2049.92s:  it because I'm fucking unhinged as fuck. And let me get caught up on the chat because I already asked
2061.60s:  you guys what you think or like what you saw. I don't actually see we might have been distracted.
2077.28s:  So what do you see here? There's two things. The first thing. If you look at the overwhelming majority
2086.96s:  of sectors, and you look at the percentage of them above relative moving averages, what do you see?
2094.64s:  There's some really, really tradable things going on right now. One of the things you see is staples.
2101.04s:  Staples is trying to turn, but it can't. It's still struggling so hard. The other thing that you see
2109.76s:  is energy is showing really strong short-term momentum. You're seeing financials now showing really
2115.36s:  strong short-term momentum. You're seeing industrials doing the same. The way that I'm identifying
2120.80s:  this is by looking at the difference between longer term moving averages and shorter term moving
2126.24s:  averages. Because if companies are below longer term moving averages and above, if they're below
2133.12s:  longer term moving averages and above shorter term moving averages, it means that they're starting
2136.64s:  to turn over. They're starting to rotate. This typically prevents a really short-term trading
2146.00s:  opportunity because I still don't think energy looks super good long-term because it's still in a
2153.04s:  broader downtrend. It's just an objective fact, but it does look good from a short-term trend
2159.84s:  following perspective. For sure. So let's take a look within energy and staples, specifically in
2174.56s:  staples. There are a few things we should look for in staples. The first thing we should look for in
2181.04s:  staples is what's dragging it down as an index. The second thing you should look for in staples
2188.80s:  is what is performing well despite the broader sector sucking wind.
2198.00s:  So between those two things, you can really clean up a lot of your exposure and find things that
2208.88s:  specifically hit what you want it to hit. That's one of the beautiful parts about building a
2215.04s:  diversified portfolio. Not only can you create diversification through things like strategies, time
2220.96s:  frames, long premium, short premium, but you can also start to find ways to diversify by finding
2228.80s:  strength within underperforming sectors, by finding weakness within underperforming sectors,
2232.96s:  or vice versa, finding weakness within outperforming sectors. I typically am less prone to fade those,
2239.36s:  simply because a rising tide does lift all boats and the way that the market moves to the
2244.16s:  downside is very different than the way it will behave to the upside. But this here is super
2251.28s:  telling. So let's take a quick peek within staples and let's see what we can find out.
2258.32s:  Let's go on a little investigation, shall we? So what's cool about this is it allows me to take a
2268.08s:  look at the price performance over various time frames and for all of the individual components
2276.00s:  of the sector. And the first thing I'm doing is I'm saying, okay, what's been up over the last year?
2283.28s:  And I can see things like Walmart. What is this? What's K? Is that Kmart? What is K?
2291.44s:  Helen, oh Kellogg's. I was like, Kellan Nova. Kellogg's ain't done shit.
2304.08s:  God, decent ball though.
2314.16s:  Not liquid enough. It looks interesting from a from a vault perspective, but not exactly it.
2322.16s:  Costco doing well. Proger doing well. Philip Morris doing well. Mozec doing well. That's
2329.28s:  interesting. I wouldn't have expected those two to be some of the stronger performers. But take a
2333.76s:  look at this, right? If we take a look at something like Philip Morris, take a look at their 52
2340.72s:  week performance up 24%. Now we know within staples, the sector itself is struggling. So what's
2350.32s:  leading us down the most over the last four weeks to like one to four weeks, depending on the
2357.20s:  trading time frame that you're looking at? Take a look. Philip Morris is down 6% over the last month
2364.00s:  and 2.3% over the last five days. So this could be something that's starting to show weakness
2370.48s:  and roll over within a broader week sector. Aha. Interesting. In it. So this becomes a short
2383.60s:  opportunity. The reason why this becomes a short opportunities because it's in an overall
2388.88s:  underperforming sector. It as itself is starting to rotate over autonomously. And there are other
2396.56s:  names that are still doing moderately okay within this sector. But this is not. This is how you
2403.12s:  find opportunities with in sectors based on broader market performance to look for strength, to look
2411.12s:  for weakness. Rudy says, Paulo, why is your fucking name Rudy on here? It's so confusing.
2426.64s:  Will you be doing any paper trading anytime soon? And no, I'm going to be joining a semi-proteam
2432.72s:  this year. So I'll keep you updated for those games. Yeah, I would much rather watch you play,
2436.32s:  to be honest. I can at least like heckle. I love heckling. I love talking shit. So I would love
2443.12s:  to heckle you. But yeah, to like just go heckle a bunch of random people, not interested in that,
2448.48s:  but really appreciate the offer. And when you say any paper trading, you mean for me or you mean
2454.56s:  for other people because right now the the Patreon, they already that we already started like an
2459.68s:  annual long paper trading challenge. We're not balls deep into it yet because it's early, but we are
2466.88s:  in it. So yeah, that's already going on. Um, Paul says Mo is Altria. No, oh yeah, you're right.
2480.64s:  Mosaic is MOS, my bad. Yeah, this is Altria, my bad. I was thinking of Mosaic, which is MOS.
2496.00s:  Let's keep going, Clorox.
2502.96s:  So what I'm doing now is I'm trying to figure out which of these are starting to show
2506.88s:  stronger short term price action like KO.
2513.28s:  TSN maybe, but I wouldn't trade it that way. WBA WBA is crushing it.
2521.44s:  So wow, that's super ugly. That is not good.
2529.60s:  But decent earnings, but came in at 51 cents is compared to 37 cents. That's crazy.
2539.52s:  This would be okay for short puts, I think. The main reason is just because it looks like it has a
2543.60s:  floor priced in right around nine and eight. So you can sell puts then if we're challenged,
2551.04s:  you can roll them, roll them until you get down to the proverbial floor. That's kind of the game
2556.16s:  plan. I am doing something similar in a volunteer. So in volunteer right now, I'm short
2571.68s:  options. Normally, I would trade something like this from a breakout perspective, trying to use
2575.92s:  some long options, gain some leverage, but I'm trading it a very different way right now. I'm
2579.84s:  trading it for short premium. The reason why I'm doing that is because it's already had a pretty
2584.00s:  big down move. I still think long term, the stock itself is probably super well positioned.
2590.40s:  The game plan for this is to start with some cash secured puts. Then if I need, I would
2599.28s:  turn into a coverage triangle. I would take shares on this happily.
2605.12s:  So even though I'm trading this as naked short puts, I'm sizing it as if it were cash secured
2613.92s:  puts because that might become an eventuality for it. We will see.
2620.80s:  Reece says, do you not trust Nvidia in other upmobes in this market?
2627.44s:  I think we talked about that a bit in the beginning. So I won't rehash that too much,
2632.24s:  but I think it's too early to tell. That's the cliff notes. I think even though the market has had
2638.24s:  an upmove, it's still in a downtrend. So until it clearly breaks this downtrend in as above here,
2645.84s:  it's still in a downtrend until it's not in a downtrend. And it's not in a downtrend until it breaks
2652.00s:  above here. That's kind of the in and out of it. So from a positioning perspective, I'm not like
2658.48s:  taking down coverage triangles that I have in the leverage ETFs and stuff. They're just still
2663.12s:  lightly offered. So the coverage triangle portfolio as it sits right now, I am 44, 45% utilized in
2674.08s:  TQs. I am 48% utilized in Upro. I am 64% utilized in IBIT. And I am 54% utilized in GameStop.
2688.16s:  These are for the coverage triangles that I'm essentially reporting out to you guys on.
2696.08s:  Most of these are subsets of larger positions that are in the rest of the portfolio. So the scale
2702.72s:  is about the same, but meeting in terms of the utilization. So most of them are really light.
2709.92s:  The only thing that has any sort of decent exposure right now is IBIT. And I actually think it
2716.32s:  might be time to add a little bit more here. I just took some short puts down today. And I
2722.64s:  probably need to add a couple more tomorrow. So that will be the game plan. And this is also
2728.56s:  another coverage triangle. But I mean, this thing has massive call open interest, especially for
2733.44s:  an index ETF like this. That's like really, really, really strong speculative upside positioning.
2739.44s:  That's exactly what that is. 39% of the transactions today were buck calls. So that's people
2746.64s:  prospecting upside. So right now the position as it sits, I will tell you, is still a thousand shares
2754.72s:  at 5455. So yeah, wouldn't buy out right here no reason to. And then I have two tranches of short
2762.88s:  puts. I have one tranche, which is a three lot of the 49s in 21 fed. Those were out for 216.
2772.80s:  I mean, those have to come down soon. Unfortunately, because I've only been in those trades,
2777.68s:  that trade for seven days. And there's already only a $1.18 left to go. So it already took
2784.00s:  essentially half the value out of it. So that will probably have to be rolled up
2789.44s:  to regain some sensitivity there, which is essentially what this next trade is,
2794.80s:  which is a two lot of the 52s. Those went on today. And those went on for $1.88.
2801.36s:  And you know, how that goes is soon as you put on any sort of short term or short premium,
2807.68s:  really as soon as you put on any trade in the near term, the market is immediately going to move
2811.60s:  against you. That's just something that always happens because fuck you. That's I think the,
2818.64s:  I think that's a cliff notes version of what that happens. I think the market has a way of being
2822.40s:  like, you know, fuck this guy or girl, it's equal opportunity. Everybody can get fucked here.
2828.56s:  So yeah, boy.
2834.32s:  Mateus. What up? What up? Mateus? Thank you Eric for the quality information you provide.
2841.20s:  What do you think about doing a coverage triangle with Palantir with IVR of more than 80%?
2847.20s:  Well, first thing is I don't know if that's following when I mentioned the position that I have,
2852.80s:  but I already talked about the position that I have and why I have that. The implied volatility
2858.40s:  rank is 51% the implied volatility percentiles 95%. So it's actually exceedingly volatile right now.
2866.56s:  Now, this is not the kind of thing I typically would base a position around right now. And it's
2873.36s:  because it's, it needs, it needs to chill out. What I mean by that is before we trade something like
2881.60s:  a coverage triangle, a coverage triangle requires something to be going up. That's the primary
2890.00s:  profit mechanism, bullish price movement. And right now, objectively speaking, this thing is not
2896.88s:  going up. So it's not displaying bullish price movement. So I wouldn't start entering via long
2903.36s:  shares here, just based on my approach. I would wait until it starts breaking above now near-term
2909.84s:  resistance stuff like this. And you can see, funny enough, that I've actually been following this
2915.76s:  down move down and trying to figure out where does it start to slow down? Where does it might
2922.48s:  look favorable for some sort of entry from a long equity perspective? Because I do think,
2930.64s:  again, longer term, Palantir. So a big part of that question, it's Matias, Matias would be dependent
2939.28s:  on your holding duration. If you're trying to trade something shorter term and you're trying to
2943.12s:  trade this to the upside, I call it catching a falling knife. I don't think this wouldn't be my
2947.52s:  game. And it's just because there's way better looking stuff out there, like there's no reason to
2951.84s:  settle for something that looks like this when there are things that are performing really well
2956.40s:  right now. If you want to trade something short term directionally to the upside. Now, the position
2961.68s:  that I have on obviously is completely different. It fits into the portfolio differently with a
2965.20s:  completely different thesis. So that may or may not apply to you. So yeah, that's the general idea.
2973.84s:  Wouldn't I wouldn't personally do a coverage triangle right now? I have cash secured puts out
2979.28s:  that I'm treating as naked puts will convert to cash if I need to. But I'm not really expecting
2987.12s:  to have to do that. But I'm also not expecting Palantir right now to show a whole lot. It's just
2994.40s:  in this weird no man's land right now. It's going to have to consolidate for a little bit. Find
2999.68s:  its feet under it. It's always important to remember markets can slide down much more effectively
3006.56s:  than they climb up in general, especially for bigger stocks. The bigger the stock gets the more
3013.28s:  difficult it becomes because more of its float ends up being locked up. So if we take a look at
3020.08s:  Palantir and we take a look at institutional ownership 48% so almost half of Palantir is owned by
3030.32s:  institutions. That's a significant amount when you compare that to some of the other names that we've
3035.92s:  been talking about. What the hell is the one with the RGTI? I think that's it. The one that I was
3044.08s:  just trading RGTI. This one 16.7% and 7 between institutional insider. You see the difference. Much
3055.52s:  much much more free float. That's not locked up by big institutions and whatnot. So for something
3062.16s:  like Palantir, there's not a whole lot of this float floating around right now because a lot of it
3067.36s:  gets locked up. I still think that longer term that's good. That means that institutions are super
3073.20s:  interested in this and they are in this for a fucking reason. They know how to make money. So I think
3079.36s:  in the broader perspective, it's good. But I think in terms of a just shorter term price movement
3084.72s:  perspective, it's not as good because it's probably going to have to consolidate a bit before
3088.72s:  you're going to get new money flowing into it. So not an entry right now for a covered string
3093.28s:  goal outright. This seems like, okay, the least of my perspective obviously because I have the
3098.24s:  position on for short puts. And that's what the expectation of rolling and managing if needed.
3104.88s:  And then ultimately taking on shares if needed. James Airston. That's a cool last last name.
3113.36s:  What's your total return in your trading career? My compound annual growth rate after the completion
3120.32s:  of last year is 31.63%. The reference compound annual growth rate,
3130.72s:  comparatively, is for the S&P 500 in that time frame is 11.4%. So about three times just shy
3142.96s:  of three times S&P return. Yeah.
3151.92s:  Now, one important note on that though is the last two years have skewed that a lot. That's
3159.12s:  to the upside. I've had a really, really, really good last two years. And I mentioned that because
3166.40s:  if I get rid of those two years, and I always mention this because I think it's important for
3171.04s:  people to know by just this really fast. And instead, we cut it at the end of 22. So we need to go
3181.52s:  to here. Nope, that's not right. That's not right. We need to go to here. And it's 20.4.
3193.92s:  So the last two years have been huge. The last two years literally have raised my 18-year
3200.40s:  compound annual growth rate by 11 fucking points. So I mentioned it because very, very skewed.
3208.72s:  It's a skewed metric. I think a fair assessment of like my performance as a trader, I would feel
3216.40s:  really, really comfortable saying something like like 22, 24% compound annual growth rate,
3225.20s:  like that, something like that. But the last two years have been super, super good.
3235.04s:  Fortunately, but super, super good.
3242.88s:  James says, do you primarily do the wheel? I do not. I do not primarily do the wheel. I actually
3248.32s:  just about never do the wheel. I have a series of different strategies that I tend to run
3255.68s:  comparatively. Let me find this video. This video goes through my general approach to my general
3269.76s:  strategies. But I essentially never trade the wheel. The wheel has a lot of issues that I think
3276.80s:  always sound good in theory until you experience them. And that doesn't mean the wheel is bad.
3282.40s:  It just means that there are better things out there in my opinion. And it's why I don't really
3286.72s:  trade it. The coverage strangle, for example, is just way, way better than something like the wheel
3295.12s:  almost, like, almost entirely. I can find very few instances where I would be like, ah, fuck,
3302.88s:  I wish I had the wheel on right now as compared to the coverage strangle. I just about never feel
3307.04s:  that way. So I think it says a lot about the difference in the strategies. But part of this also
3312.64s:  is just a personal preference, right? Like, what do you like? What do you trade? And that's finding
3319.36s:  things that match up well for that is really good. I have a request. This is like the easiest
3328.80s:  request for me to satisfy because this is probably one of the hottest videos that you can imagine
3336.48s:  in your life, which is why the gang is always so excited to take a look at it. This video right here,
3344.16s:  which is about paper trading. And so I launched this video on 21 September as 492 view.
3359.76s:  Oh, God. It is like the one of the worst performing videos on planet earth. It's unbelievable.
3370.56s:  James says I was also wondering, hold on, I missed the first part. James says, would we be able to go
3374.80s:  over BLK as a short earnings risk premium play? Let's take a look. Be okay.
3380.00s:  Okay.
3382.48s:  Okay.
3384.00s:  Had a slight beat.
3393.44s:  Look at what is this 5631.
3395.92s:  BLK earnings analysis.
3405.04s:  Let's see.
3410.72s:  It looks decent.
3415.76s:  Like, that's one that I wouldn't.
3419.12s:  It looks like it might not have worked, but it looks decent.
3425.20s:  I'm signing into O-Rats right now because it has a couple other tools that I like to look at for this.
3432.16s:  But as you guys know, we have to go through the whole verification process, get the
3435.60s:  fucking email, send in a DNA sample before they will let me, let me log in. Let's see.
3451.76s:  So let's take a look at things. You okay?
3461.92s:  Yeah. I mean, this looks fine.
3465.60s:  I entered a short earnings risk premium position on my paper challenge. Wait, PCT. What the
3473.04s:  fuck is PCT? Do you mean PTC? Do you mean the paper trading challenge? Do you mean something else?
3484.96s:  Anyways, yeah, this looks fine. In retrospect, the IV over HIV hasn't been that large. It's
3491.60s:  sufficient. 1.4%. Yeah. I think it's completely reasonable, James. The fact of the matter is,
3500.56s:  when you trade earnings, it is literally as a numbers game. We can't look at one instance and be like,
3506.88s:  ah, fuck this one didn't work out. Let me go through and see why I shouldn't have done this.
3512.08s:  Which is not how it works. This, in general, looks fine to me. I personally would have came into it
3517.92s:  for sure with a positive skew, meaning I would have either been lighter on the short calls,
3525.20s:  or I would have been skewed on the deltas, right, amount of ratio, whatever you want. But the reason
3531.20s:  for that is if we look across its past earnings profiles, it clearly, when it goes to the upside,
3539.52s:  that's where it's had its beats. I've seen zero beats to the downside. So it stays within bounds
3547.44s:  to the downside. So yeah. I mean, I think that this is completely reasonable. It's just a
3556.48s:  fucking numbers game. So I think the analysis in terms of tracking implied compared to realized
3564.40s:  is fine. I think the trade itself is probably fine. But yeah, I mean, it just had a bigger move
3572.32s:  than expected, which is going to happen. That's why that risk premium is there. Came in at, well,
3577.20s:  what did it open at? That's the important part. Opened here at 1020. So what had what? Like a five,
3588.72s:  a 5% move or something like that? 5% when it was expected at 3.6. So yeah, that's just a small loss.
3596.64s:  And then how we go on to the next.
3604.32s:  James says, thanks. This is my first loss from a short earnings risk premium perspective. So
3611.44s:  it's curious. Yeah, it literally is just a numbers game. It's straight up a numbers game.
3615.76s:  So on an average earnings series, you can typically get maybe one 200 trades on.
3624.96s:  And that's if you're trading at size, so you need to find things that are a little more liquid.
3629.52s:  If you're trading smaller, you can probably get more than that.
3633.12s:  Out of that, you would expect to win over 50% of the time, typically closer to like 65% plus.
3639.92s:  But you have to get a bunch of them on. Like that's just the way you have to get a bunch of them on.
3647.28s:  James Erison says, can the wheel make 50 or 80% in one year? Sure.
3654.88s:  Can it? Sure. Is it probable? No. But can it? Absolutely. The difference between like what's
3662.72s:  possible and what's probable? Very important differentiation. In the markets, there's
3669.68s:  the sky is the limit. There's so many possibilities joking aside. Realistically, the possibilities
3679.36s:  genuinely are just about limitless. It's kind of open-ended. But there's a difference between
3684.80s:  what is possible and what is probable. One of the biggest issues that the wheel might have
3693.44s:  is capped profit potential. So the ability to make 50 to 80% when the primary profit mechanism of
3704.00s:  the wheel is stock going up, that's a problem because we're capping the upside. So if you modify
3715.20s:  the wheel and at least trade the short premium at a ratio, that's your first step to make it more
3722.32s:  likely. And then the second step is you have to be really good at picking stocks. Like what that
3727.28s:  essentially says, James, when somebody says like, can the wheel make 50 or 80% in a year? Really,
3734.16s:  all that means is can I find a stock that returns greater than 50 or 80% like that's literally
3740.32s:  all it is. Can I find a stock that makes more than 50 or 80% a year? Yeah, that's the that's the
3747.92s:  basis. Joe says not making better than 50% due in the wheel unless you're investing in risky
3753.28s:  underlying or lucky. Yeah, I actually don't necessarily disagree.
3761.76s:  I don't necessarily disagree, but I also don't fully agree because it's entirely dependent on
3767.84s:  the skill, right? I can tell you by the way, James is looking at it, it's insanely improbable,
3772.80s:  right? Because James is looking at it from the prospect of trying to sell his way
3777.68s:  to hit that metric. The probability of selling your way, meaning selling puts and getting all
3786.08s:  the way through to the end of the year and achieving that is, I don't want to say it's zero, but it
3790.72s:  is super improbable. And it's because you have capped profit potential. So what's happening? That's
3798.32s:  the nature of selling puts. You are exchanging a higher probability outcome for a lower severity
3807.12s:  reward. So the fact that when you see something like at the money puts in Tesla being at 7%,
3814.40s:  that's what we call Goldilocks analysis. We're too focused on the puts being at 7%,
3821.60s:  also, fun fact, as earnings coming up. So there's probably a reason why we see puts trading so
3829.84s:  richly. But when they are trading so richly, that's the market telling you that it's expecting a move.
3839.60s:  So what ends up happening is eventually you get stuck because the move eventually will roll over,
3847.60s:  like it always has an everything. We don't know when it is, but people are like so stoked with Tesla
3854.24s:  with where it's sitting right now, rightfully so it's done well. But if we zoom out a much longer
3860.08s:  term timeframe, you can see it's now literally just now in the last two months recapturing the highs
3868.32s:  from late 21 early 22. It's just now recapturing these highs. So if you get caught during one of
3878.24s:  these bad paths, you're fucked. It's just not happening. So yeah, the probability of selling your
3883.84s:  way there like that is about zero. It's not impossible, but you would essentially have to not lose
3891.12s:  and have a really, really fortunate path in front of you.
3896.80s:  James says, I think it's also really important to consider the risks. The way you're phrasing Tesla
3900.88s:  puts, 7%, makes me wonder if you're looking at specifically for the absolute return instead of
3904.88s:  risk adjusted bingo. James is on it. This is I can tell in James also really good on you. That's
3910.40s:  the cool part about doing these, right? Is I can see the various viewers are starting to understand
3917.44s:  what Goldilocks analysis is in how to avoid it because James, what you're picking up on there is
3923.52s:  exactly what's happening. Correct. James says, is wheel on SPX a good retirement strategy for income?
3931.36s:  SPX? No, you can't wheel the SPX. Part of the wheel is taking the underlying on, taking the shares
3942.00s:  on from the underlying. Can't do it in SPX. There's no underlying. James says, spy. That could be,
3948.72s:  it depends on your goals, right? Depends on how much money you're trying to make and what you're
3952.08s:  trying to do. And it also depends on what income means to you. For a lot of people, they trade the
3959.84s:  wrong way when it comes to this concept of income. The way we think about income is kind of broken.
3969.52s:  And when people say income, we tend to think selling strategies that will pay us out on a
3975.44s:  consistent basis. Well, that's in my opinion, a broken way to look at income for trading. I think
3982.88s:  a more effective way of trading for income is looking more specifically at what you need and how
3994.64s:  you get there in terms of overall returns, not what strategies are being used. The reason for that
4002.48s:  is because, once I let me update this, analyzing the wheel and trading for income.
4013.84s:  The reason for that is a lot of times when we sell premium to try and make income,
4021.84s:  it works until it doesn't, then the income is gone. A great example of that is if we go back
4028.16s:  and we take a look at SPI. And if you take a look at attempting to sell premium through pretty much
4036.32s:  this entire time frame, if you're selling puts as part of your income strategy, you're getting torn
4042.48s:  up to the downside. So then your income is now being tied up in rolling your trade because again,
4050.56s:  we cannot realize the credit received from a short put because it's tied to an open trade.
4059.76s:  So let's take a quick look at what, damn, let's take a quick look at what this might look like.
4066.96s:  So let's just zoom in on this section here. Now, if I sold to open
4081.36s:  one put at a dollar during this time frame, my cash and sweep is going to go, I don't know,
4089.84s:  I did a five, that was really dumb. It's going to be plus $100. My net lick is
4097.68s:  an inch. My net lick hasn't changed because it's tied to an open trade. So I have $100 sitting
4104.96s:  in my cash and sweep. You could take that out if you want, but you're going to have a fucking problem
4110.32s:  because let's do this. Let's say your cash and sweep is just this $100 and you're like, oh great,
4114.56s:  I have $100. Let me take that out, go grab gas. So then I withdraw.
4120.40s:  $100.
4124.00s:  And as I'm withdrawing $100,
4129.36s:  this giant legged abomination from the Paleolithic era or the Pettedullic era,
4139.84s:  hard to say which one. That looks like this. And you guys already know
4147.20s:  that they're dripped out with diamonds. And then I think now we've actually even upgraded
4158.80s:  to a silver watch and maybe some platinum grills. So we need that $100 because we're going to go,
4172.80s:  we're going to go grab some gas. And so we take this $100 out. So CNS now
4186.96s:  is at zero. Net lick is still unch unchanged. Okay, so now let's fast forward time.
4194.88s:  Now during this movement, our put got challenged. Our one put, we have to close it for $3.
4203.28s:  So then where is this money? We have to produce $300 to close this trade.
4214.32s:  Your cash and sweep doesn't have it. So now you're either going to go on margin
4224.08s:  and borrow the money from your bank or from your broker for a daily yield or
4230.48s:  you're going to have to liquidate other holdings to create cash and sweep to then be able to pay
4240.08s:  this $300. That's got to come from somewhere. So this is the problem when people have this
4246.72s:  fairytale idea of trading for income. The way that I talk about trading for income is essentially
4258.16s:  trading, making a bunch of money and then saving so that you have at least one year. If not
4266.88s:  two full years of expected monthly expenses that are padded. And then all we do is trade in the
4276.40s:  near term and pay back our surplus that's two years of buffer. If you're trying to live off this
4287.52s:  spoon to mouth, it is almost destined to fail. And it's because you can't take the fucking money out
4295.44s:  because you need it because the trade. The way that we manage this trade is either by rolling it
4302.48s:  which you have to produce the money in order to be able to roll it or by taking assignment.
4307.36s:  And if you go to take assignment, you have to have the money somewhere to take assignment unless
4312.32s:  you're going to go on margin. So James says, couldn't you just wait until the cycle expires before
4320.48s:  taking money out? Yeah, that's exactly it. So then that's the longer term idea. But then that
4327.76s:  also means that there will be some periods where you don't get to take any money out. Because again,
4333.68s:  let's say this, let's say this exact scenario happens and you had $0 in your cash and sweep. Guess what?
4340.24s:  You still need $300. You have $100 of $300. You still need $200 more dollars. That's not here.
4356.56s:  So again, it goes back to this. Either we're going to go on margin, either we're going to liquidate,
4362.08s:  or we're going to add money into the account to make us whole to be able to make this transaction,
4367.92s:  to roll this put out, to close the put if you want, whatever it is you choose to do with the put
4372.40s:  rolling or closing it. The same thing. The only difference is if it's tied to an opening trade,
4378.16s:  but you need the fucking money. It's not here. So even if you wait to take your $100 out, it doesn't
4384.08s:  fix the problem. You have to have enough money sitting in the account. So the easiest way to circumnavigate
4393.60s:  that is to not need the credit that you're attempting to collect and give yourself a buffer.
4402.80s:  So that then, if you do need to roll this out, you already have your income because you saved it
4410.32s:  out for two years. It's still in the account. You're still using it. But then you can roll your
4417.84s:  trade a couple times. I still take my monthly income for four months because I need to live. I'm
4423.52s:  living off my expenses, but now my 24 month buffer is down to 20 month buffer. So now I need to start
4430.72s:  blessing that back up. When the trade eventually unwinds, then maybe you can start blessing it back
4439.20s:  up through other trading activities. But once the trade eventually unwinds typically when you're
4444.24s:  rolling like this, you're not collecting a bunch of credit even though you're tying money up
4448.80s:  for months at a time. So even in the scenario that you eventually get out of this unscathed,
4456.40s:  meaning your big loss that's been rolled a bunch of times is flattened out. You don't have a bunch
4461.36s:  of money after those three months. It's not like you made three months worth of income during those
4465.36s:  rolls. It doesn't work like that. So then you're behind and you have to find ways to accelerate.
4475.12s:  James says, I don't understand why we're going on margin if we have the cash sitting in our account
4482.96s:  to purchase the underlying. Yeah, you wouldn't go on margin in that case, provided that you do have
4488.64s:  the cash and it's sitting in your cash and sweep. It's not been taken out. Yeah, for sure. That's
4494.88s:  completely fine. What I'm explaining is the common understanding of trading for income and the
4501.12s:  common understanding is that we take this credit. We sell something for a dollar. We get the $100. I'm
4508.72s:  just using $100 for an example, obviously, but then we take the $100 and it creates a litany of
4514.96s:  different issues. Even now, if you have the position cash secured, let's clear all this out and let's
4522.64s:  talk about the problem with that. If the position is cash secured and you got in to S&P 500 here
4530.64s:  when it was at, let's call it 450. I'm drawing this with the mouse.
4537.52s:  Well, what happens until essentially here, your trade is negative and it's negative for this
4547.20s:  entire duration. Where's the income? You now have a period from May of April, May of 22
4558.96s:  until July of 23. It's about a year where this is producing about $0 in income.
4569.04s:  Cash secured. It's great. You have the shares. It's great. You have no fucking income from it.
4575.52s:  Then we might say, well, we could sell calls against it. How much are we going to get
4582.72s:  for those calls when our basis is 450 and the underlying is trading $100 below that? Let's see.
4593.68s:  We go out 37 days. We go $100 out of the money. We need to pretend our basis is $692. Let's add
4601.92s:  a bunch more of these. $695. You get one and a half pennies for your 21 Feb 37 days to expiration.
4621.68s:  $10.5. Pretty sick, eh? What are you going to do with all the money?
4631.60s:  Sometimes that's the hardest part about trading, to be honest, is figuring out what you're going
4637.44s:  to do with all the money you've made. In this case, you have a big decision to make because we have
4643.76s:  a $1.50. Don't forget we do have to pay commissions on that. Maybe you walk out with a dollar,
4650.48s:  but you've got to be like, damn, what the hell do I spend this entire dollar on? Obviously,
4657.28s:  fucking around here. This is the problem. This is the entire problem when people talk about things
4665.60s:  like trading options for income or rolling until you're right. This entire thing is based on a
4677.60s:  complete and utter mental fallacy. It's that thing we were talking about before that you probably
4685.04s:  heard us when we were saying Goldilocks analysis. That's exactly what this is. Goldilocks analysis.
4696.16s:  And I'll explain why. We focus on the elements of the trade of the position that we think we like.
4706.64s:  That sound good. That are preferable to us. The elements that we like because they're there.
4713.12s:  And we completely spend insufficient amount of time considering the elements that would be shitty.
4721.12s:  That would be unfortunate and a very, very realistic part of the trade. That's one of the big
4728.64s:  issues with the wheel is that you can have sustained periods of time where you're just fucking holding.
4735.76s:  You're just holding. That's all you're doing. That's all you got. That is a bit of a problem.
4744.64s:  So yeah, it's an unfortunate reality that anybody that trades eventually comes to the understanding of.
4754.16s:  And I cannot tell you how many times I have different versions of this conversation with people
4758.64s:  trying to help talk them off the edge of this thing being is good as we think it is.
4767.92s:  James says, wheel would have been pretty good for 10-year stretch post-09.
4772.64s:  Yeah, I mean, we can definitely cherry pick all kinds of scenarios where something would be good.
4776.80s:  The funny part about trading the wheel on that time frame is you still fucking underperform
4780.72s:  buying and holding. So yeah, it would have been good. But it doesn't it doesn't mean anything.
4786.48s:  It's not how trading works. We don't just get to say like this one specific period of time,
4791.60s:  this was good. Bitcoin was great over that time frame. Where's the Bitcoin at? Do we all have
4798.88s:  tons of Bitcoin? No, because conditions are what they are at a given point in time.
4806.16s:  Looking back historically at a favorable stretch and saying it would have worked good in this
4812.00s:  duration is again pure Goldilocks analysis. We can't say post crash. This looked good. What about
4821.28s:  pre crash? How would it have done leading into the crash? How long did it take before we got back
4826.88s:  to break even? Same thing with the most recent move. And I want to be clear, trading the wheel
4834.56s:  or any sort of long equity position in the S&P 500 index ETF, it's a solid choice. Like it generally
4840.72s:  is a solid choice. But we still have to acknowledge the realities of the position. What it behaves as,
4846.32s:  what it actually is, not just the spots that we like. If we have the propensity to just look at
4854.16s:  trading the elements or analyzing the elements of something that we like, we have a big problem. It's
4860.88s:  a big problem. We're on to water millen, which is sick. Really interesting conversation though,
4870.48s:  and as you can tell, like I absolutely will always spend the time talking about this stuff to try
4874.96s:  to help people learn this shit before they get into it. And they're like, wait a minute, this ain't
4881.36s:  working the way that I thought it would. What the hell's going on? And it's just because we had a
4885.44s:  lot of side of understanding of the way that this thing worked. That actually leads me the problem
4894.24s:  with trading the wheel for income. I'll make a video on that. Who's been a while since I made
4901.20s:  a video on the wheel specifically? I'll clear that out. Anything else that we should hit?
4912.72s:  Super fun, super fun combo. Tomorrow for the pro members, we're going to be doing a bunch of,
4921.84s:  we'll have some like quick trade updates. And then we'll go through the paper trading challenge,
4926.48s:  provide an update there, see how everybody's doing. And then we'll talk about the trading pairs
4930.00s:  program. And make sure that the conversations are happening that you guys are having good back
4934.96s:  and forth dialogue to talk about some of the learning so that we can cross share all that.
4939.12s:  And then on Friday, we have the outlier options trading basics. And we're actually doing
4949.12s:  buying versus selling options. And this is from a conversation I think we had yesterday. I typically
4956.96s:  expect this series to go about 15 episodes ish. So we have a handful of flex episodes. And that's
4966.88s:  by design. It's because if we go through this, and I noticed that there's some sort of knowledge
4972.24s:  gap or elements that are kind of missing from our understanding, then what I'll do is use one of
4978.00s:  these to find the elements we need to spend some more time on and slot them in. But this is the
4984.72s:  general general path we're going to take. So this Friday, we're going to talk about buying versus
4990.88s:  selling options. What that looks like, how to think about them, the differences between them,
4995.36s:  how they behave, the settlements, all that kind of stuff. So if there's anything as we go through
5001.04s:  this and you're like, damn, I wish I knew more about blank. Tell me because that is exactly why
5008.08s:  we have some space here to add some stuff in.
5016.40s:  Travel says, have you ever had a year where you made no significant profit? Yeah. Well, I had
5021.28s:  my first two years of trading, I was negative. My first year of trading, I was down 1.1%,
5028.00s:  the second year I was down 4.2%. But after that, I didn't have anything sub double digit year.
5038.00s:  I had low double digits, like low teens. But yeah, other than the first few years,
5047.68s:  I've not had like a year where I didn't, and again, I don't consider that significant profit.
5054.40s:  But consistent. Again, that's like the entire, the basis of my approach to trading is it's entirely
5061.84s:  wrapped around consistency, not severity. But I also had a completely different series of
5070.08s:  objectives with what I was trying to do as a trader and whatnot. James says, in your wheel video,
5076.48s:  can you, can you review invest with Henry, one hour course on YouTube? I cannot because I already
5083.52s:  did a video on invest with Henry. And I don't know him personally, but I think this stuff he talks
5089.44s:  about is complete shit. And I think that the stuff that like the way he presents himself
5097.60s:  is straight trash. He makes it sound like he was like an X investment banker. I think from like
5103.04s:  Goldman Sachs or something, and he was a fucking intern there. So it's like it, and then he talks
5108.64s:  about like retiring from there. It's just all bullshit. So yeah, I don't have anything good to say
5114.32s:  about him. So I wouldn't do like some video review of, of whatever that is. I don't look at his
5120.48s:  stuff. I did a segment for a little while where I was going through trading services with my buddy
5125.60s:  Kyle, because at that point, I didn't have a Patreon or anything like that. And I just
5131.28s:  wanted to try to help people find genuinely like something that looked good. And
5137.84s:  after I did, I forgot how many episodes we did of that. But like, I literally couldn't find
5142.96s:  stuff that I thought not even worked good. Then I thought we're like, okay, so I stopped. Yeah,
5150.16s:  I stopped doing, stopped doing that series. So it was like, this is fucking ultra-disenfranchising.
5158.32s:  Books are still the best. My hands down versus the courses and stuff is at least again,
5163.44s:  from what I saw. Books is seemingly the best. So yeah, sorry to pop the bubble games,
5173.68s:  but that's the honest opinion at least for me. Reese says, I find myself more emotionally attached
5181.36s:  to some positions than others trying to work on that. Oh, that's interesting.
5188.32s:  That's really interesting.
5199.28s:  As I think about that, my best guess, as at least a starting point, is to try to differentiate
5207.84s:  the origin of the trade. My guess is the reason why we might be more
5215.12s:  emotionally invested in something is if we believe in it, believe we know something about it,
5223.28s:  like something about it. And we allow that to cross over into the,
5231.76s:  into the like the business decision side of things. So I think I would clearly delineate
5243.28s:  between your thoughts about something and the way that you choose to trade it.
5258.24s:  Yeah.
5264.08s:  And I think what I are too bad in James are saying are really, really wise.
5269.44s:  If you choose to have some sort of fundamental approach as compared to a trading approach and
5278.16s:  you're looking to express different time frames, like you can create different structures.
5283.44s:  It's exactly what I do with my IRA account is, I told you guys this a million times,
5291.60s:  like my IRA account almost always outperforms the market and I barely touch it. I really do
5297.84s:  barely touch it. And I provide an update on it most years. And it's really funny actually.
5304.64s:  I always get a kick out of that because I spend so much time trading, analyzing, moving positions.
5310.24s:  And then sometimes I look at the performance of what I'm doing in the IRA. I'm like, what the
5314.00s:  fuck am I, why don't I just do this? It's so I do nothing essentially. So the point being is the
5321.84s:  Roth IRA account for me has a completely different approach, not completely different,
5325.52s:  that's dramatic, but a different level of involvement than the primary margin account.
5329.20s:  And that can be recreated, meaning you can set up a different account if you want to have an
5333.52s:  investing component versus a trading component. But a big part of that is a really, really big part
5345.20s:  of that is aligning what you're doing with your temperament is a human being. Because sometimes
5361.68s:  let me let the dog out so we can go get his dinner.
5375.28s:  That's funny. Normally he's kind of like ready to go grab his dinner, but he was just literally
5382.00s:  debt asleep, not doing shit. That's actually hilarious. But you have to align what you're doing
5391.12s:  with your temperament as a person, as a trader. Because sometimes people we say we will say
5396.40s:  were things or want to be something that were not. So a lot of times people will say for me like,
5404.32s:  what do you buy and hold? And the answer is just about nothing. I don't really buy and hold
5410.24s:  anything. I very rarely have long term stock holdings. And if I do as part of like a covered
5416.64s:  strangle, I'm still almost always trading options around them. And you guys can tell hopefully
5422.16s:  that there's that that's part of my just general temperament and personality. I'm impatient.
5429.52s:  And I want to accelerate things. And long term buy and hold is not that. Long term buy and hold is
5440.56s:  a really, really big, really big faith leap that the next 10 years is going to look like the last 10
5452.48s:  years. And we never really know if it's going to. Let me I have a couple more minutes. It looks
5466.00s:  like you guys have a few more things which I'm happy to cover. I'm just updating the thing.
5470.16s:  Our little tracker. Let's see. Reese says I went long so far at 650 on a fundamental basis.
5480.80s:  I've traded options around it, but I haven't but haven't sold the shares, but I think it's time to
5486.16s:  what I think is it's time to analyze that ship before you enter the trade. That's what I think.
5492.32s:  You can't wait until you're in the middle of a trade. And I hope most people that are a part of
5499.60s:  the outlier community are full will aware of this at this point. There's there's not a scenario where
5504.80s:  you're in the middle of the trade that you should be figuring out what you're going to do while you're
5508.80s:  in it. That's not to be confused with having a set plan before you get into a trade. But we
5515.28s:  should have considered what we're going to do essentially in the full ray of possibilities.
5523.12s:  It shouldn't be figuring it out as you go. There's adjustments we can change, but
5529.84s:  Reese says it was before I found this channel. Yeah. So now's the next time, right? The first time
5534.80s:  to do that is before you put the trade on the next best time is now and figure out what the
5541.92s:  position is, what you're trying to do with it, what your underlying assessment is. But when you do
5547.52s:  that, my advice to you would be don't do it from the context of the position that you have on.
5553.44s:  Essentially pretend you don't have the position on. Pretend the position is not even there.
5557.76s:  And think about what you would do with the stock is now when you would buy it. If so, that gives you
5566.72s:  part of your answer is now when you would not buy it, but settle alerts. That gives you part of your
5572.00s:  answer and so on and so forth. The other thing I would always, always, always mention is it is
5579.76s:  almost never a bad thing to scale down a little bit and then leave some on.
5588.32s:  That almost always satisfies a lot of those urges, at least for me. And I recently did that in
5594.72s:  RGTI. I talked about that yesterday where I put on the position and then I let it ride. And
5602.16s:  on the day it was up almost 50%. So then I took essentially enough of the trade down
5608.96s:  to then finance the remaining part of the trade and guess what? I'm very thankful that that
5615.04s:  remaining part of the trade is on. Since it's up another 24% percent today. So that's another
5620.48s:  really slick way to try and strike a balance between the urge to take something down because it's
5626.48s:  doing what you want and to then continue to let it go. So yeah, I think the main takeaway though,
5636.32s:  at least for everybody is always make sure that you're thinking through the full trade life cycle
5646.00s:  before entering. I are too bad says if it was mine, I would just sell enough to get my initial
5656.88s:  investment back and let the rest ride. I think that's okay. And I think to me, I think it's a
5663.60s:  little bit of an arbitrary thing and I think it's good that you flagged for what you would do.
5669.12s:  Because that makes total sense from your perspective. But I think the broader point that I fully
5674.80s:  agree with is to literally we were just talking about, scale some of it down. But I think the amount
5681.52s:  to scale down should be variable, not just to get the initial investment back. Because there's
5686.96s:  also an opportunity cost for the time. So let's say for example, we take a look at SoFi.
5694.56s:  And we say that we got in at 650. Let's just pretend that it was somewhere in here. It probably
5700.72s:  is somewhere in here. But let's pretend it was somewhere in here. Well, if we got in here in June
5709.68s:  of 23. And then we essentially take enough off to cover the cost of the initial investment and
5717.68s:  leave the rest on. And then say for whatever reason, the stock plummets and comes back down to our
5723.04s:  stop. And then we get stopped out. Or if it goes down, you know, to zero ish, not saying it would,
5727.44s:  but it goes all the way down. Then you kind of don't have anything to show for that time.
5732.80s:  There's not much to walk away with. So I think the part of the scaling protocols should be relative
5742.32s:  to the time in the trade. That's also why for our GTI, I did that exact approach where I took
5749.68s:  enough of the trade down so that I have a risk-free trade on. But it's also because it was literally
5756.88s:  the same day that it happened. There's not really an opportunity cost there. And then what ends up
5761.92s:  happening is I set alerts in it with the expectation of exiting as it eventually starts to make its
5768.80s:  way down versus just letting it go and seeing what happens. But to the point I was making earlier,
5775.04s:  that's my approach. Just like your approach might be whatever it is in terms of take it off so
5780.16s:  that there's no risk. That's smart. But I think the trader has to figure out what makes sense in the
5785.04s:  context of the broader approach that they're taking. Because it's the same thing with rolling puts.
5791.76s:  The idea of rolling puts that are being challenged is fine until you realize that you have to
5797.36s:  roll them for six months. And at the end of the six months, you don't really have a whole lot to
5803.68s:  show for it. And there's a really, really simple example actually. Let me
5811.28s:  kind of feel in froggy. So 136, 55, rolling, short puts. Let's take a look.
5823.60s:  So let's go into
5831.92s:  here. Let's go to here. January 10th of 22.
5844.16s:  22. And Jan, and then let's.
5860.88s:  I'm going to just grab this.
5866.80s:  This.
5873.12s:  Go over here.
5878.40s:  And I'm just going to track. Like the requisite details. I'm not going to track a bunch of
5884.24s:  shit just so that we can move through this fast. So I'm not going to bother with entry dates stock.
5888.96s:  I'm not going to bother with expiration. I'm not going to bother. We'll keep strike so that we
5894.16s:  can track the movements there. I don't care about the Delta wheel track essentially just lots.
5901.44s:  And lots premium strike these. So
5909.84s:  all of this doesn't matter.
5918.08s:  What am I doing with my life?
5920.24s:  Why is it? I can't want to do whatever. Oh, it's because it's already gone down.
5927.12s:  Okay, so let me brush this.
5934.32s:  I'm going to squish this down. And let's take a let's take it for a ride. I'm going to get rid of this.
5946.24s:  This.
5949.12s:  This don't care. Delta don't care.
5954.48s:  Socket exit is fine. These I don't care.
5962.40s:  Yeah. Cool. All right. So let's clear this out. And I'm going to keep this off to the side
5970.48s:  just so that I can go faster. But this is what I'm getting those are the inputs.
5975.52s:  I'm going to be using in case you want to be able to follow along and make your own version or
5979.44s:  whatever. All right. So let's go in here. We'll just do like a six-month daily deposit.
5985.12s:  And let's sell our puts 18 Feb. We'll do the 443s. So the strike is 443.
5993.92s:  Premium is going to be 712. Let's just do a one lot.
5998.64s:  So let's say we have a $50,000 account. This is now using $44,000. We're getting 712,
6006.40s:  1.6% return on invested capital for anybody that sells puts. You know that that is a insane,
6014.48s:  insane premium that you're getting. And I realized that we didn't go through two of the things I
6021.04s:  was going to go through today. So I'm just going to change this to analyzing the wheel and rolling
6031.84s:  options. Okay. And let's fast forward time. So I'm literally just going to bring us straight to
6042.32s:  expiration versus any management. We're just going to go and see what happened.
6051.92s:  Let's see.
6063.12s:  So it looks like our 443s. If it's at 457, we should be okay here. Except it's not. It's at
6070.00s:  like 436. Yep. Okay. There we go. So we're going to take this down for $8.6,
6075.52s:  which is actually really, really solid, by the way. The reason why that's so solid is because
6079.92s:  VAL was so damn high, which is one of the benefits actually of selling premium when VAL is so high.
6088.00s:  So 434.96 stock entry. I already forgot it was like 453.
6100.16s:  So here's what has happened so far. The stock has moved down 4%.
6109.28s:  We don't care about this gap. We can just get rid of that. We don't care about percent capture.
6115.12s:  We can get kill that. We're down negative for negative 94 bucks and we're what 37 days into the
6125.20s:  trade. So I'm just going to track days of the expiration over here manually. The reason why I'm
6131.20s:  doing this is just because it's faster than me having an input like this specific dates for
6140.64s:  expiration. So I'll literally just track the raw days there. So that's what we have so far.
6145.44s:  And I'm going to run through a couple of these. I'm going to show you. So here's there.
6149.76s:  That's your first trade is you sold a put. You wanted the what is it? The $712. But after that
6158.24s:  37 day period you actually had to give back 94. So let's try this again.
6164.72s:  Let's go out 28 days. That's the next generally closest. This is all skewed. So I just have to fix it.
6172.08s:  For those that don't know when you see it skewed like that in on-demand you just have to change the
6175.68s:  strikes and then it will rebalance you. So let's go here to the 418s. So now this stock is at 434.
6183.68s:  96. Our strike prices for 18. Our premium now is 729. Lots size one fast forward.
6195.60s:  Now we're going to go to 18 March. See what it is.
6204.96s:  438. So it looks like we would have made money on these. That's great.
6212.72s:  And this will be a good example. So these come down for two pennies.
6224.56s:  Stock is at 439. 97. And the original days for this was 28 days.
6232.96s:  So first thing to know. We are now
6247.28s:  65 days. We're two months into this. And after the 65 days we have $633.
6255.44s:  Not ideal. If we are expecting to make 712 on the first month, 729 on the second month,
6263.92s:  we only have 633 to show for it. This is the problem of trading short puts with the idea that
6273.52s:  you're just going to be able to make income off of them. So now let's, I think the market starts to
6279.28s:  roll over a little bit more. So we'll have even better example from a rolling option perspective.
6284.72s:  Because one thing that I don't know if you noticed, but I gave us a break here.
6289.12s:  I didn't make us collect the same amount of credit. It allowed us to pick a more advantageous strike.
6295.68s:  So I didn't even really consider that as a role since it was a $100 loss. I mentally write
6300.16s:  those off as like a scratch. It doesn't even matter. Okay. So we're at 439. 97.
6305.76s:  New strike price 425, which is a 30 delta, which I'm not tracking here. I have to update the
6315.52s:  thing there. Okay. Premium on these 5.56, a one lot. And this is 27 days fast forward. And we need
6327.76s:  to go to 14 April. Do what we got. And 440. So our 425s look okay. I don't know if this actually
6347.76s:  goes all the way back to 08. That would be really nice. Yes. So our 425s, those come down for a
6356.80s:  penny minus 0.01. Stock is currently trading at 441.75. 441.76. Okay. So now let's go again.
6371.84s:  36 days. 30 delta is the 428s. 428. Premium. We're going to get 605.
6381.44s:  Lot one days 36.
6387.28s:  Les go 20 May. We on the way.
6394.64s:  Ah, ugly one. So this looks like 386.
6401.52s:  Problem. We have a problem on our hands. And let's see what the problem looks like.
6405.84s:  And then I'll move this here for the example. So we now have to buy those back for 4046 minus 4046.
6420.24s:  Stock at exit now is 387.54. 387.54. So the first thing that's happened is shit. The first thing
6431.84s:  that's happened is we're now in the trade for a total duration of 128 days. In the course of
6438.48s:  that 128 days, our current realized PNL is negative $2,253. You literally have nothing to show
6447.36s:  for the past 100 and what was it? 28 plus 128 days. You have nothing. So now we have to look for
6454.24s:  a role. We have to figure out how can we roll these? So we need to find where we can get 40
6459.36s:  dollars and 46 cents. So let's see where we can find that. Let's go to the 17 June.
6466.00s:  $40.46 puts us at the 427s. So we can improve our bases by $1 and go here for a 28 day trade.
6476.80s:  It's actually not genuinely not the worst. That's good. And this is an artifact of really high
6483.52s:  volatility. So 427 will be our role. The premium we're going to get is 4110, a 1 lot. And this
6493.36s:  is going to put us back in the market for another 28 days. That's correct. Yeah, 28 days. So now
6500.48s:  fast forward. June. Let's go June. 427 or 362 new low. Damn. Damn, Daniel. All right, let's see what we have now.
6519.36s:  Closing price.
6530.16s:  6299. So minus 6299 stock is now at 360 405 360 4.05. Okay. So now we have a composite loss of
6547.84s:  $4400. We are now 156 days into the trade almost six months in. And you are down.
6560.80s:  $4400. So now let's find our next role. And then I'll pause it after this. I don't think we have
6564.96s:  to go through this exercise all the way through because I can I hope you can see what's happening.
6570.56s:  And then I'll show you the summary of what ends up happening. So 6299, where do we get 6299?
6577.84s:  60 Gs. Gs Louise. 62 Holy shit. 1.50. Okay, 6299 is here at the 426. So not that one actually.
6596.08s:  That's only 6236. So we have to go further. I'm not going to bother with the weeklies. I'm going to
6603.76s:  keep it in the main explorations. This will just give us a better basis adjustments. It's going to
6608.72s:  be further out in time here. 6290. So this still doesn't get us what we need. We need 6299 to roll
6617.36s:  for a credit. We're now out 63 days. And this still doesn't get you there. So we have to go out even
6625.20s:  more 91 days. Let's figure out where that 6299 is at 6216. 6307 right here at the 426. So you do
6637.84s:  get your dollar basis adjustment. So now we're going to be at the 426. The premium is going to be 63.07.
6646.40s:  And it's going to be a one lot. But now we're adding 91 days. Okay. So now let's fast forward that
6659.28s:  time frame to what 16 September. Does what I'm doing make sense? Like do you understand the
6668.72s:  implication of what I'm showing you right now? What I'm showing you is that even though you can
6675.84s:  adjust, defend and manage a in the money short put, there are still issues especially from an
6685.44s:  income generation perspective. But even more than that from a actual how much money you have to
6694.64s:  show for it at the end of this thing perspective. Okay. So this it's still in the money obviously. So
6699.20s:  these came down for 42 42. The stock is at 383 55. We are now 247 days in this trade and you are
6714.64s:  down 2377 dollars. So if we were to look at the averaged cash secure amount, it's essentially
6726.80s:  this divided by this is a percentage. So so far, being nearly a year in the trade, we are down
6739.36s:  5.6%. Now I want to be clear, that's not terrible. That's when I do stuff like this, I think sometimes
6746.08s:  people misconstrued what I'm doing and what I'm showing you. What I'm showing you is that it simply
6753.76s:  isn't as nice of a thing as people like to think it is. That's all. It's not bad because the market
6763.20s:  had a rough year. So this is not doing bad. All right. So now let's take a look. We need to make 42 42.
6768.96s:  Where do we get that 42 42? At 427 that sucks because our basis right now is 426. So if we want to get
6778.56s:  4242, we either need to go up a strike and worse in ourselves or go further out in time. So let's go
6787.76s:  further out in time. Let's find that 42 42, which is here at the 426. So now we don't get a
6792.72s:  basis adjustment. We're literally going to be at the same basis. So now we're going to be at 426.
6801.36s:  And we get 4309. One of those and we're adding 63 days was it 63.
6808.64s:  Okay. This will be the last one. We need to go to 18. And then I want to show you the example.
6820.64s:  James says better than buy and hold. It's a false comparison. Like that doesn't mean anything.
6827.76s:  And it's a concession to try to make us feel better because what is the comparison even mean?
6838.00s:  Better than buy and hold. Better than buy and hold and what? Depending on what I buy and hold in,
6845.84s:  I could have made money this year. I get your point and I don't disagree with you,
6851.28s:  right? Comparing it against the underlying itself. But that's just like a standard basis of an
6857.52s:  argument. It's not a trader's approach to markets. Those aren't your two choices. You don't get
6863.52s:  to just sell cash secured puts in spy or buy spy. There's other shit you can do and there's
6868.72s:  other shit you should do, right? Because of this exact thing. This is how I made money during this
6873.60s:  year as compared to what this is showing you that essentially over the course of this year,
6879.04s:  you don't have much to show for it. So this now came down for 3146 minus 3146.
6887.12s:  And the stock is at 39442.
6893.92s:  Okay. So now we are
6901.28s:  310 days into this trade and the portfolio at this point is down 2.8%.
6910.80s:  So now we're going to have a look at the current.
6915.92s:  So now, what I want to show you is let's say that we're able to actually get this down. Let's
6925.28s:  say that this eventually expires worthless. Let's say this next role expires worthless. So let's say
6931.92s:  that we just keep it at the 426 and let's say that we got 3150. We had one. Let's say it's another
6939.20s:  90 day trade. Let's say that it expires worthless. At the end of this whole thing,
6947.60s:  you would have made 3150, $3,150, tying up 42,600. You make $1900 total and now you're 400 days
6961.52s:  into the trade. So this is not bad, right? It's not bad. But it's not as pretty as people think
6973.68s:  it is when it goes this way. This is objectively problematic, especially if you're trying to do this
6980.64s:  for income. If the idea for doing this for income, guess what? You had one month where you had to
6986.56s:  add $3,441. You had another month that you had to add $2,200 in order to keep the trade going so
6995.04s:  that you can make the adjustments. So this process of rolling short puts and adjusting them, it's
7000.72s:  exactly what I do. There's nothing wrong with this. But I go into this with eyes wide open on what
7009.60s:  this does look like, the ugly parts of it. And it's why I make sure that I have other strategies that
7016.88s:  I can use to pick up the slack from the money that's tied in this now because it's not going to
7023.44s:  produce that much for a pretty long period of time. That's the whole point. So rolling short puts
7030.08s:  is fine. You can absolutely move around a basis. It's not as pretty as people think it is. You can go
7037.12s:  really, really, really long durations and have very little to show for it at the very end of it all.
7043.68s:  It's the reality of it. But this is still better than losing a bunch of money in the long run.
7049.84s:  But same vein, if we compare the entries and buy and hold comparison to this, this absolutely
7061.36s:  is beating by and hold at this point, not by a whole lot. Now the downside of beating by and hold
7069.52s:  in this scenario, a down market is that it will underperform by and hold in an up market.
7075.60s:  So then net net, it's about the same. It doesn't really help you that much, especially because
7081.20s:  the markets tend to exhibit positive. So rolling short puts, baby, it's fine, but you have to understand
7089.68s:  what it is. So that is that. All right, gang. That is enough for me. I've been running my fat mouth
7096.16s:  for almost two hours. That is more than enough. If you guys need anything, hit me up. I will catch
7101.28s:  the Patreon gang on the stream tomorrow. And then if you guys need anything, hit me up in the
7106.56s:  discord. It's completely free to join for everybody. And yeah, we'll see you in there. Be an outlier.
7112.32s:  Catch you later.
