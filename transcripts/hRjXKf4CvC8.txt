314.00s:  you
326.00s:  you
334.00s:  what is up to all the outliers I hope the week was awesome and I know
338.00s:  absolutely absurd. I think you should be nice to people throughout the entire year. But that aside,
344.00s:  there is no better Valentine than making the decision to stop lighting your money on fire trying
353.36s:  to learn how to trade options and to actually make some money so that maybe you could take your
358.96s:  partner out to a nice dinner or maybe take them on a trip somewhere as compared to the usual
366.64s:  light the money on fire and then go hang out in the Wendy's parking lot behind a dumpster. So
374.56s:  I argue by attending today, you really are a romantic. That's what that that's exactly what's
381.36s:  happening right now. So the agenda for today is pretty straightforward. We're going to take a look
388.64s:  first at a quiz. We're going to do a little bit of a recap from the last episode on volatility.
398.08s:  And then we're going to dive into the world of the Greeks. Now you can already see up behind me and
402.64s:  this has been up for like five minutes now during the the holding period. So hopefully everybody had
408.80s:  a chance to take a look through what's up here now. And then also to take a look through those
415.52s:  two videos that I've shared yesterday in the discord and then also on X. If not, I will throw both
423.84s:  of those videos in here now. This is actually reverse order by accident. So watch the second link
431.52s:  first and then the first link. So the goal for our conversation around the Greeks today is to
440.96s:  essentially be a hybrid, a blend between those two videos that I sent you. The second video goes
446.64s:  through literally all of the Greeks. Well, most of them that you would come into contact with.
451.68s:  And it gives you the fundamental understanding of what they are. That the first video,
458.48s:  which is the second one you should watch, gives you how to actually use the Greeks to fine tune
467.20s:  your trades. So the session today is going to do a little bit of both. We're going to do a run
474.08s:  through. I want to help you visualize how the Greeks behave in different time frames. And then I
480.40s:  want to help you think about actually using them to make trading decisions. So let's get started
491.44s:  with a quiz. Okay. So last time we spoke about volatility. So the first question here, what does
500.08s:  IV measure? What does implied volatility measure? Feel free to throw it in the chat. And if you're
507.28s:  watching the recording, you can write it down, throw it as a comment, whatever you want. But give
512.40s:  yourself an opportunity to actually see if you know it without looking it up first.
517.12s:  Now, the reason why we spend a lot of time talking about the ins and outs of
524.88s:  volatility is because volatility is essentially the heart and soul of options trading.
534.64s:  Kevin says future movement expected. Okay. James says market consensus of future price range.
542.00s:  Both of those are acceptable. Lauren says market expectations decent.
548.88s:  Fuzzy says perception of market gods. That's probably the most accurate.
554.40s:  Expected move. One standard deviation of expected move. Thank you, Shrej. So Shrej,
560.32s:  already read my mind for everybody that was mentioning expected move.
565.68s:  There's an amplifying data point that's really, really important. Really, really important.
571.20s:  The reason why it's really important to acknowledge the fact that this is a one standard deviation
577.12s:  move is because there's not an insignificant number of data points that will fall outside of that
583.92s:  distribution. So let's take a look at an Eric special, a terrible drawing that probably is
592.96s:  going to add more obscurity to what I'm trying to show you. But it's the effort that counts,
597.28s:  right? That's what they say. Fun fact is not the effort that counts. It's the fucking output
600.56s:  that counts always. But the output of this is I enjoy attempting to draw and confusing everybody.
607.36s:  So okay. So here we have a mean
610.56s:  standard deviation move now.
632.84s:  Please.
635.84s:  So, when we're talking about a one standard deviation expectation of forward price movement
644.80s:  that represents this range, inside this range is 68 percent of occurrences.
655.00s:  If we go to this second standard deviation, it expands 95.
662.16s:  The reason why this is important is because a non-trivial number of movements will fall
669.66s:  outside of this 68 percent probability.
673.96s:  So a lot of people will say, oh, the expected range is 10 points.
678.32s:  And then they're blown away when it moves outside of 10 points, for example.
684.92s:  You cannot be blown away in that instance, especially if you understand what we're talking
689.20s:  about now, the fact that it is a one standard deviation expectation.
693.36s:  Okay, next, what is variance?
698.44s:  What does variance measure?
705.24s:  Now the cool part is some of these things are actually also giving you an inherent introduction
711.80s:  to basic statistics, specifically as it applies to trading.
715.28s:  That will be something that we're going to take a look at.
720.36s:  Steve Shop, that's a fun name, is saying standard deviation squared.
728.08s:  Okay.
730.64s:  What do we got?
732.12s:  Anybody else?
737.12s:  James says spread of data over a time series.
741.48s:  I would take it.
745.48s:  Joe says difference between price and expected move.
748.24s:  That's a good guess, but that's incorrect in this context.
750.88s:  Now, what you're talking about is completely cracked, the variance, right?
754.16s:  The difference between it and expected and an observed outcome.
757.28s:  So full credit for the try there, but in this context, that's not what we're talking
761.68s:  about.
762.84s:  So when we're trying to understand the movement pattern of something, let's say that we have
771.04s:  a line of best fit.
773.04s:  And let's say we have data points that are plotted randomly around it.
785.84s:  What we can do is we can figure out what the difference is between all of these individual
793.32s:  data points.
795.20s:  And then we can assess how different they are from the total average.
801.16s:  So we can look at variance a bunch of different ways in the context of markets.
805.28s:  We have a very specific way of looking at it.
807.88s:  But the high level note that I want you to pay attention to when with respect to variance
813.28s:  is essentially the dispersion of something around a mean and the frequency of the dispersion.
823.56s:  So we can understand if something has very high variance, which will bleed over into standard
829.92s:  deviations and volatility, volatility is essentially just variance square root.
837.72s:  And the reason why we do things like we figure out the mean between each point and we square
846.52s:  it each one.
849.36s:  The reason why we do the squaring process is because it normalizes all of the signs.
853.48s:  The stuff above this is a plus sign.
855.76s:  The stuff below this is a negative sign.
857.92s:  You can't add those together cleanly.
860.96s:  They also allow us to exacerbate some of the movements to see them more clearly.
866.04s:  But most of the time when we're observing volatility, we're going to get back down to
870.20s:  the base level, which is why we then later take the square root of it.
875.76s:  So the important thing to remember with variance is it gives us an idea of how the data points
881.64s:  of something behave compared to the average.
884.64s:  And it's a really important use case with respect to trying to track volatility going forward
890.12s:  and measure what it is.
891.92s:  Okay.
892.92s:  Last one, what is the difference between historic volatility and realized volatility?
905.76s:  What you got?
907.72s:  Now for those that were in the session last week, you will remember that we spent a little
912.16s:  while talking about the different kinds of volatility that exist, what they mean,
917.84s:  why they matter.
919.56s:  And this one is actually a fairly important one.
924.12s:  So I'm actually eager to see what you guys say about this one.
930.40s:  And then I need to update our little timestamps that I can figure out when we got to the quiz,
937.08s:  which is like 840 while you're throwing your answers in.
941.56s:  840, please.
947.84s:  No guesses?
952.84s:  So you sell them and there's on it.
956.96s:  Yeah, very empty.
957.96s:  No guesses.
959.36s:  What's the difference?
961.24s:  So traces historic volatility would actually happen, realized can be future.
967.12s:  Yeah, exactly.
968.12s:  There we go.
969.12s:  There we go.
970.12s:  That's exactly correct.
971.12s:  So it's a nuanced question.
973.76s:  So historic volatility is always a measure of what happened.
977.84s:  And typically speaking, it's using longer term ranges, realize volatility can be backwards
984.06s:  looking or forwards looking.
986.44s:  You can have future realize ball or you can have realize ball looking at historic data
991.88s:  point.
992.88s:  Now the important note here is that the way realize volatility and historic volatility
997.36s:  when they're calculated, real words looking is slightly different.
1000.68s:  In general, we use them interchangeably, but there is a slight difference between.
1004.52s:  Nice job.
1008.16s:  Let's jump into our recap.
1010.56s:  I got a pop up in the door for a thought.
1015.52s:  All right.
1025.60s:  So last time we essentially did all things volatility.
1036.38s:  We learned why it matters, how it behaves, how to analyze it, how we can use volatility
1044.18s:  to give us tradable information in terms of expected ranges.
1049.02s:  We looked at things like the curvature of volatility through things like term structure,
1055.98s:  smile.
1057.08s:  We looked at the volatility surface.
1060.42s:  We looked at skew the difference between same term, volatilities.
1067.86s:  And we learned that volatility is one of the more predictable elements of markets.
1073.76s:  And it's one of the few examples of a true mean reverting assets.
1081.08s:  And you can break it out as its own asset class.
1083.40s:  Or you could just look at it as a true mean reverting effect depending on how you're visualizing
1089.04s:  volatility.
1090.04s:  This is very different than when we look at something like price.
1093.64s:  So not only does it inform the way that we build options trades, not only does it inform
1098.96s:  the way that we analyze and visualize the market, but it also gives us the opportunity
1104.84s:  to trade a very predictable effect, which is important for those traders out there.
1113.52s:  Sick.
1114.52s:  That is our recap on to today, which is about the Greeks.
1120.62s:  So your TLO, your terminal learning objective for today is to have an idea on how to use
1128.08s:  the Greeks to make better trades.
1131.92s:  That is the ultimate endpoint of the session.
1136.76s:  So notice how it's not to know the Greeks.
1140.16s:  Yes, you have to know the Greeks.
1142.60s:  But the main point here is that knowing the Greeks is not enough.
1148.08s:  So introduction to the Greeks.
1153.36s:  We need to always remember why we're learning this stuff.
1157.60s:  I refer to it as putting first things first.
1161.32s:  And it's like a lot of times traders, when they're trying to solve a problem, they accidentally
1166.90s:  start trying to optimize for the wrong thing.
1170.10s:  So in the example here, we need to understand how we use the Greeks not to know what they
1175.80s:  are, not because it's fun, but because we use them to literally make better trading
1182.20s:  decisions.
1184.00s:  I have a couple misconceptions up here.
1186.48s:  If you have others, I would absolutely love to capture those.
1190.88s:  The two primary ones that I have here are that the Greeks provide an edge and that there
1198.44s:  is a best Greek.
1201.80s:  And these aren't things that I'm kind of like just making up.
1204.60s:  These are things that I have literally come across in my conversations on places like
1212.56s:  Reddit.
1213.56s:  And I'll actually show you this, not in this post.
1216.16s:  This is somebody else's post I wanted to talk about in this post.
1220.40s:  Let me find.
1226.56s:  There is a specific person.
1230.40s:  No, no.
1242.56s:  There's a bunch of comments on this one, so we'll find it.
1254.48s:  So here's one.
1256.64s:  So this is from an actual post that I made.
1262.36s:  This is one comment.
1264.76s:  Okay.
1267.52s:  Try reading it now.
1269.36s:  It's kidding.
1272.84s:  So this is one.
1285.96s:  And then there's one more.
1287.20s:  Let me find.
1288.72s:  Here you go.
1292.80s:  The reason why I'm showing you these is like these are your peers.
1301.80s:  And they're my peers.
1303.00s:  These are other retail traders that these are people that think this stuff.
1317.76s:  And the reason why you have to know this is because one of the things we're trying to
1322.80s:  do is traders is avoid making the mistakes, common, common mistakes.
1329.20s:  So let's talk about these very quickly.
1332.52s:  And then we'll get into this one in the back that I had thrown up.
1336.08s:  So this top one says the post for those that are wondering the growth, the post is literally
1341.72s:  the Greeks do not provide you an edge.
1345.08s:  That's the gist of the post.
1347.56s:  And this person says Greeks can be mispriced in quotes based on market conditions.
1354.64s:  For instance, a 20 delta, option 30 DTE and it goes in the money in three days.
1358.20s:  It was priced at a 20 delta when the trade was open and now it's over 50 delta in the
1362.80s:  money.
1363.80s:  The probability is only so accurate.
1365.64s:  But in the bigger and more diverse picture, no one really knows.
1368.24s:  This is completely wrong.
1371.20s:  Like entirely wrong through and through.
1376.20s:  And this shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Greeks are.
1381.52s:  The Greeks provide us inputs relative to a snapshot in time.
1389.12s:  So when we're looking at these top level Greeks, the ones that you're going to be most familiar
1395.84s:  with, delta, theta, I normally like to put gamma up here.
1402.88s:  I like gamma better there.
1408.32s:  Delta theta, gamma, Vega and row.
1410.44s:  This is the more common group of Greeks for people.
1414.88s:  The way to think about the Greeks is that they essentially are the instrument cluster
1420.96s:  to your car.
1422.68s:  So when you're driving your car, understanding how to read your tacometer, understanding
1430.36s:  how to read your speedometer, understanding what oil temp is, what transmission fluid
1440.20s:  temp is or just trans temp depending on your car, what your coolant temp is.
1445.96s:  All of these different things are inputs to you.
1451.16s:  Understanding how to read the gauge cluster of your car doesn't inherently make you a good
1455.52s:  driver.
1456.72s:  And there are some people that can drive that don't really know that much about their
1460.36s:  car.
1461.36s:  Now, that's simply an artifact of cars have a lot of controls in place for you.
1468.84s:  An example of this is if there's something wrong with the car, check engine light will
1471.76s:  come on.
1472.96s:  That is literally the world creating structure for you to make it easier for you to know
1479.64s:  something's wrong.
1482.12s:  That doesn't exist in the markets.
1484.68s:  You have to be able to look at your coolant and see that your coolant is effectively boiling.
1490.72s:  And then you have to do something to change it.
1492.80s:  There's no check engine light that's going to tell you maybe the check engine lights like
1495.92s:  a margin call.
1497.24s:  That's when it's way too late.
1499.80s:  So the way to think about the Greeks is they give us a lens to measure different inputs
1507.64s:  that impact an option.
1511.36s:  Because if you'll recall, when we're talking about options, there's intrinsic and extrinsic
1525.48s:  value.
1529.52s:  We know that these contracts have an expiration.
1537.60s:  You know that these contracts care about volatility.
1544.56s:  So what I'm showing you is that looking through just at a surface level and you see like there's
1552.60s:  these different kinds of values that create the premium.
1558.28s:  We know that they expire at some point.
1560.40s:  So something that's going to expire in a day is inherently going to have different value
1564.84s:  than something that's going to expire in a year.
1568.80s:  So from an intuitive perspective, we can just postulate that there are other factors that
1575.32s:  impact the premium of an option versus just the underlying price movement.
1583.40s:  So the Greeks allow us to understand how all of these different factors impact premium.
1594.00s:  And then as we get into second order Greeks and third order Greeks, they help us understand
1601.20s:  how different factors impact other factors that ultimately impact your premium.
1611.84s:  So the way to think about it, and this isn't a perfect description by the way, but this
1615.76s:  is a way to think about it, a simplifying framework.
1619.32s:  First order Greeks pertain to the price or the premium, right?
1627.80s:  So delta rate of change of premium per one point movement spot price, theta rate of change
1634.44s:  of premium.
1635.44s:  I guess I'll clarify those in here.
1644.40s:  Delta change of rate of change of premium delta gamma note.
1653.60s:  We'll talk about that in a second.
1655.60s:  Oh, no, I already have premium in there.
1656.76s:  I'm an idiot.
1657.76s:  Sorry about that.
1659.56s:  I realize that it starts with premium.
1662.60s:  So notice how delta premium rate of change theta premium rate of change Vega premium
1668.32s:  rate of change row premium rate of change.
1671.16s:  All of these first order Greeks deal with premium rates of change.
1675.92s:  Then notice gamma.
1678.40s:  What's the difference in gamma?
1680.16s:  This is our first second order Greek.
1684.92s:  What do you notice?
1687.04s:  Gamma is telling us how delta works.
1693.12s:  So the second order Greek gamma is measuring a first order Greek.
1706.40s:  You see the point.
1707.84s:  So the way to think about first order, second order, third order Greeks is that they
1712.36s:  essentially tell you what they're measuring and they measure different things.
1718.60s:  So most traders will deal most commonly with the first order Greeks plus gamma.
1727.60s:  And we'll talk about the others in a little bit.
1730.68s:  But now going back to this question, back back to this, the Greeks are not mispriced.
1736.36s:  The Greeks are Bayesian.
1741.24s:  They provide a snapshot in time and then they update immediately based on new market
1750.60s:  movement.
1752.08s:  So to this person's point, it's not a mispricing at all.
1758.08s:  It is simply the different that markets move as the underlying moves as volatility moves
1766.84s:  as new news enters the system that forces repricing of things.
1773.00s:  So it's not mispriced at all.
1776.16s:  It's simply a Bayesian system that integrates new information.
1781.16s:  So now this was another comment on that post.
1784.32s:  And essentially again, a reminder, the post is that the Greeks don't provide you an
1789.68s:  edge.
1791.28s:  And this person says so yes and no, the no.
1793.68s:  I make an absolute dump truckload of money utilizing the Greeks in part of my SPX strategies
1800.24s:  and how I swing stock options.
1802.44s:  It's not the sole driver to my thesis, but it's a significant part of the evaluation.
1805.96s:  So you could tell like this clearly is just a person that wants to debate, right?
1811.56s:  Because they're literally saying no, but then they use the Greeks.
1815.72s:  So that that part of side, I don't even care.
1818.68s:  People are always quick to do that.
1821.80s:  It's actually funny to me.
1824.40s:  The broader point is I want to talk about this individual person and their experience
1831.88s:  because their capacity to make what they consider to be a dump truckload of money,
1837.32s:  which here's another bet.
1839.32s:  I would happily bet hundreds of thousands of dollars that if we actually conducted a
1846.04s:  genuine audit of their returns, this would not be the case.
1850.20s:  Just saying.
1851.56s:  But that aside and granting the point in taking it as something to think about, right?
1860.48s:  A cognitive exercise.
1863.16s:  Their ability to make money with or without using the Greeks has nothing to do with the
1870.84s:  post, which is that the Greeks do not provide an edge.
1874.48s:  The way that I think about the Greeks is that they provide table stakes.
1882.96s:  You are a artist of sorts and your medium is options.
1891.32s:  So you have to know when to use the chisel.
1895.28s:  You have to know when to use the sandpaper.
1897.96s:  You have to know when to use the polish, these different tools.
1902.52s:  So the Greeks are table stakes.
1906.84s:  The Greeks are what you need to understand in order to understand what the fuck is going
1913.20s:  on with your positions that are on.
1916.12s:  This is why so very frequently in the simplest of sense, people will say the underlying
1922.76s:  move in my favor, but my trade lost money.
1926.00s:  Why did this happen?
1927.44s:  It typically happens at a surface level of some sort of change in volatility and theta
1931.96s:  decay.
1932.96s:  That's generally the case.
1934.88s:  But it goes much deeper than that.
1937.80s:  So for example, sometimes people don't understand when they're in the markets selling tons
1945.76s:  of really far out of the money puts.
1948.60s:  And they think that their position is actually very safe because it's a low probability
1954.14s:  move.
1955.42s:  However, the position is way less safe than they think it is.
1961.34s:  And one of our Greeks help you understand that exact scenario.
1968.54s:  So if we're selling super far out of the money options, Vega can really hurt us.
1977.14s:  So if volatility starts to spike, Vega can lead to pretty significant expansion of a
1988.48s:  margin requirement.
1990.30s:  So if I'm selling super far out of the money options that are super cheap and because
1994.86s:  they're so far out of the money, they don't make much money.
1998.02s:  So then I have to sell a bunch of them.
1999.58s:  So then I sell a bunch of them.
2001.50s:  And as I'm doing this, I still have a pretty high probability trade.
2007.80s:  But if volatility starts to expand, that can hurt.
2013.86s:  Our Vega in that case would be slightly problematic.
2019.54s:  However, if we go down and we look at a second order Greek like Vama, and we can see that
2028.98s:  Vega actually has convexity.
2034.92s:  So the problem with that is the position that that person selling super far out of the
2039.72s:  money puts, for example, thinks is super safe.
2043.44s:  And then volatility starts to expand.
2045.78s:  And all of a sudden it's looking much worse than they thought, much faster than they thought.
2051.30s:  And it's because they have no concept of Vama.
2054.50s:  They're literally holding what I call a Vama bomb.
2058.74s:  And it's just ticking in their hands.
2061.42s:  And they don't even fucking know it's there.
2063.58s:  And it's because they don't know this.
2066.30s:  So the Greeks are what you need to know in order to play the game.
2072.18s:  Another example I use that might be useful for people is if I'm playing basketball and
2078.78s:  I know that if I shoot a free throw, it gives me a point.
2085.34s:  So I know the rule.
2087.78s:  And in order to be able to shoot a free throw, I need to know the rules, right?
2091.78s:  I need to stay behind the line.
2093.74s:  Those of the team has to stay behind their lines before they can go for a rebound.
2097.58s:  I have to know the rules because if I violate the rules, then I can't make the point because
2102.78s:  they won't count the shot.
2105.18s:  But simply knowing the rules doesn't give me the point.
2110.62s:  I still need to make the shot.
2113.90s:  That's essentially what the Greeks help us do.
2117.70s:  So now let's go back.
2121.22s:  Thor is getting really antsy grumbling.
2125.10s:  He literally had like this little sad whimper.
2136.82s:  I was ignoring him.
2139.70s:  So now let's go back and I actually want to hone you in on this one.
2144.22s:  Do I really need to understand the Greeks?
2147.22s:  And they say, I'm making money consistently without technical analysis of the trades.
2155.34s:  Convince me it's worth taking the time to learn.
2160.02s:  This is the complete backwards way to think of the markets.
2166.86s:  This is somebody that is trying to prioritize their convenience and their preference.
2173.70s:  They're saying it's going well so far.
2177.46s:  I would rather not do this because it's annoying or because it takes time and effort and I
2183.14s:  don't want to do it.
2184.54s:  So they're saying, do I actually have to do this?
2188.18s:  And the reality is for this person, I can definitely tell over the long run that this
2196.30s:  kind of person, I don't know how long they've been trading, I can tell you what's not
2200.10s:  long.
2201.10s:  And I can also tell you that the probability of them if they maintain this kind of course
2205.10s:  of them being around for a long time is very low.
2208.74s:  We have to get over the fact that the markets are not based on our convenience.
2213.82s:  What we want them to be, what we want to be easier difficult, none of that matters.
2218.42s:  It all is what it is.
2221.66s:  So this person's question of do I really need to understand the Greeks?
2225.06s:  You don't have to understand the Greeks.
2227.38s:  You absolutely can trade and you can even find short term success or you can even find
2232.46s:  moderately long term success by not knowing the Greeks.
2236.38s:  Certainly.
2237.70s:  But the thing is is that's finding success in spite of your lack of knowledge.
2244.90s:  There's nothing about this that actually helps you.
2250.14s:  The only outcome here that's positive is that you make money and you're making money
2255.90s:  in spite of your own lack of knowledge.
2260.82s:  So it's really important to understand the differentiation because trading is a very
2267.82s:  long term game as I commonly remind you all.
2271.66s:  And over time all of these little weaknesses are going to come out.
2276.90s:  You're going to find them all.
2278.34s:  You're going to find the market to do that because you have to do a lot of things in markets.
2282.58s:  So do you need to understand the Greeks?
2285.70s:  No, you can absolutely choose not to understand the Greeks.
2289.30s:  Is that negatively going to impact your ability to make money?
2292.58s:  Absolutely.
2293.58s:  Unequivically, yes.
2294.94s:  Without a doubt.
2297.86s:  So now I'm going to take a pause on some of these misconceptions that we went through.
2306.30s:  And the quick overview of what the Greeks are and what they do.
2312.98s:  And I want to see if there's any upfront questions you guys have as of right now.
2323.30s:  And I'm just updating our timestamps.
2327.14s:  Paul says, I guess successful trades went to his head.
2332.94s:  And the funny thing is, is you're exactly right.
2335.70s:  Those successful trades go to their head, but in the worst way possible.
2340.82s:  The reason why it's the worst way possible is because they don't realize their own problem.
2346.78s:  And their problem is that they're making money in spite of this, which means they're stacking
2352.82s:  the deck against themselves.
2354.78s:  And then it won't be that far further down the line when they actually lose money.
2359.38s:  And then they're like, oh, I wonder why I'm losing money.
2363.26s:  This, it'll start to unravel this fundamental misunderstanding of option, which is always
2369.82s:  interesting to me.
2371.90s:  I never understand that perspective.
2373.90s:  It doesn't make sense.
2374.90s:  Why would you not want to know the tools for the trade?
2378.10s:  Obviously, because it's more work, but this comes down to the people that still are
2382.98s:  just overwhelmingly mistaken that this is going to fast easy money.
2387.50s:  And as I will always remind you, you ain't going to find that here.
2391.46s:  You are not going to find fast easy money in markets.
2394.62s:  It's simply not the case.
2400.86s:  James says what exactly is convexity?
2404.06s:  It's a great question.
2405.46s:  So actually, I wonder, give me a sec.
2409.18s:  I bet you that there's going to be a cool graphic of it.
2421.46s:  I don't like any of these three.
2434.50s:  This one's OK.
2436.86s:  So a lot of the stuff that you're going to see is from bonds because the convexity of
2442.26s:  bonds is a hot topic.
2444.42s:  But I just want you to focus on this.
2451.14s:  So it's the same thing that you learned in, I actually don't know.
2455.22s:  It's like basic math.
2456.22s:  I don't know if it's algebra.
2457.90s:  I don't think it's algebra.
2458.90s:  I don't know where you learn it.
2460.38s:  But it's that concave convex wherever you learn that, right?
2464.94s:  So convexity, concavity.
2466.74s:  I don't remember where we learned that.
2469.50s:  But that's like middle school or probably middle school or something.
2474.06s:  So essentially, convexity is when something has this kind of shape.
2479.22s:  So it's when we have tails that rise up pretty significantly.
2486.54s:  And then we have a flatter midsection of some sort.
2491.74s:  Now there can be all sorts of skew with convexity.
2495.18s:  It's not going to be an even distribution or anything like this always.
2499.78s:  But the main thing to know about convexity is this general shape.
2504.86s:  So you can have things that are positively convex like this.
2508.14s:  You can have things that are negatively convex or concave like this.
2513.38s:  And it gives us a really important read into the behavior of things.
2518.62s:  So when you look at options, an example of option convexity is gamma.
2525.02s:  So if we look at, well, actually, I think I have it here.
2530.02s:  Give me a sec.
2539.14s:  Yeah.
2540.46s:  So it's not smooth, not smooth, but this is convexity.
2545.46s:  So what this is showing you is the steepness of gamma in two different instances.
2551.46s:  You can see that Vega has concavity.
2559.38s:  So convexity has things become more convex.
2562.30s:  They move faster.
2564.50s:  So in this case, with gamma, we can see that this yellow line is a 10 DTE option.
2573.22s:  The white line is a 30 DTE option.
2576.46s:  So notice how gamma's convexity increases as it goes up into 30 DTE from 30 DTE to 10 DTE.
2587.62s:  So that's what convexity is.
2589.74s:  In the theoretical sense, it's literally just this shape that we apply in different contexts.
2597.50s:  So you very, very frequently will hear about convexity in the bond market.
2602.06s:  Super, super common.
2603.98s:  Let me know if you have follow on questions on like what convexity is, but that's essentially
2610.70s:  what it is.
2612.30s:  Why not says who needs Greeks when you can guess my man?
2615.66s:  That's it.
2616.42s:  That's it.
2616.94s:  It's better off.
2618.14s:  We're better off just fucking straight up guessing.
2629.14s:  All right.
2631.30s:  So let's get a withdrawal here.
2637.74s:  So let's talk about how we can use the Greeks.
2649.14s:  As always, you will refer, well, you always hear me refer to the way that I plan things,
2661.06s:  which is always from the top down like this, like a funnel, right?
2666.82s:  So the top level of using the Greeks for me is actually the portfolio level, the way
2673.14s:  that we can use the composite Greek position or Greek standing of our portfolio is very
2682.22s:  useful.
2683.22s:  This goes back to that example I was telling you before.
2684.98s:  If I'm selling a ton of super far out of the money options, even though they're very
2690.50s:  high probability to work in my favor, and I'm selling a whole bunch of them because they're
2694.50s:  cheap and I have to and I'm using more and more of my margin requirement, I will see
2699.90s:  that represented in the Vega.
2702.90s:  And I can also calculate that with respect to something like we talked about earlier,
2707.54s:  Vama.
2708.86s:  So we can use the Greeks to help us manage the overall portfolio.
2714.66s:  You can use things like a beta weighted delta.
2720.18s:  You can use portfolio level theta, portfolio level gamma, Vega.
2729.14s:  All of these different Greeks can be zoomed out to the composite level.
2734.06s:  And it helps us understand the lean of our entire portfolio.
2739.26s:  If I have a bunch of trades on that are all short premium, I'm going to have a really
2745.94s:  healthy looking positive theta metric.
2749.82s:  But I am really going to be at the mercy of gamma across the board.
2756.58s:  So then if I notice that I have really high positive theta higher than I typically would
2762.66s:  expect it to be, and then I notice that my gamma risk is significantly elevated, that
2769.90s:  might inform me to go into my portfolio of individual trades and find things that might
2780.26s:  be really, really highly correlated in taking some of them down to reduce this correlation
2787.26s:  so that I can take down the overall portfolio level gamma and scrub off some of my overall
2794.26s:  beta weighted delta.
2796.66s:  So I might take some of these positions down like this.
2803.18s:  So that's the portfolio level.
2805.58s:  Did not mean to get rid of everything.
2815.06s:  The second is from an analysis perspective.
2823.26s:  And again, you can tell that this session we're not doing the basics of Greeks.
2828.38s:  The two videos that I shared are going to do all that for you.
2832.50s:  So I'm spending more time talking about this stuff.
2835.66s:  And there's actually a really good example of this that I came across recently.
2840.18s:  So if we take a look at, let me, this.
2849.06s:  So if we take a look at the actual effect of the various Greeks, and in terms of like
2855.30s:  how to actually conceptualize their behavior in our brain, we can figure out where we
2862.46s:  see heightened or lower delta, I enter lower gamma theta, Vega, all of these.
2868.66s:  All of them are different inputs that we can custom tailor to our exact idea.
2875.50s:  This is one of the most important points of the video that I want you to key into.
2881.58s:  One of the true benefits of options is you can gain purposeful exposure to the precise
2888.58s:  effects that you want.
2890.94s:  And you can minimize your exposure to other effects that you don't want is involved in
2897.38s:  your position.
2899.54s:  So the Greeks allow us to do this.
2904.90s:  So let's take a look at something like, what was I looking at last night?
2910.06s:  There is a ion cue.
2917.42s:  If I go to ion cue, and then if I go to something that's like 700 days out, what do you notice
2925.06s:  about the deltas for ion cue that are 700 days out?
2935.26s:  The deltas are this column right here.
2941.50s:  So this at the money, the deltas are 0.76 at the 40.
2952.58s:  0.74 for the next strike.
2955.18s:  That's out of the money.
2956.82s:  The following strike is 0.70.
2959.02s:  The following strike after that is 0.67.
2963.22s:  So what you might notice that's different than what you typically see is that the deltas
2969.02s:  are very, very high for options that are out of the money.
2973.10s:  We typically see if we come closer in time, we typically see like a 50 delta that's right
2980.26s:  about the money.
2982.66s:  So what can we take from that?
2986.26s:  There are important context clues that the market tells you if you know how to understand
2992.74s:  them.
2993.94s:  So what the market is telling you in this specific instance is this stock is not only expected
3001.46s:  to go up, but I also can tell you that this stock has significantly elevated volatility.
3012.06s:  That's what this tells me.
3015.46s:  So the Greeks give us a lot of these small little tiny clues that we can piece together.
3025.50s:  Another example are things like Gek's gamma exposure.
3034.90s:  So let's say we go into spy and let's take a look at the gamma exposure.
3045.58s:  We can look at gamma exposure in a bunch of different contexts.
3050.62s:  But this is looking at a specific expiration.
3053.74s:  You can either do a composite so that you can see pretty much everything at once if you
3058.74s:  are so inclined.
3060.06s:  It's really up to what you're wanting to analyze.
3065.62s:  But we can use things like Gek's to understand what dealer behavior might look like.
3074.62s:  We can figure out if Gek's is higher on the collar, the put side, which nets out to
3081.22s:  a total Gek's.
3083.10s:  We can look at things like volatility skew and use that to help us understand different
3091.70s:  pricing disparities and discrepancies between calls and puts are between different cycles.
3096.50s:  This can tell me in this instance that put call parity might be off.
3100.78s:  There's an arbitrage opportunity there.
3103.94s:  So the Greeks give you literally all of this and it starts from understanding what they
3112.06s:  are.
3113.06s:  Now, this series of stuff that I'm explaining really tied to a slightly higher level use
3120.14s:  of the Greeks that takes time.
3122.10s:  It genuinely does take time to piece together all of these things.
3126.22s:  So what I want to do is spend a little time talking about how you can use the Greeks
3131.78s:  in a day to day context, at least getting started with using them.
3137.62s:  So I need somebody to give me a strategy like it could be any sort of basic strategy.
3142.66s:  And then I will talk to you literally how you can use the Greeks in the context of that
3147.94s:  strategy.
3156.10s:  Any ideas, the straddle, cool.
3160.18s:  Followed you on shorter along.
3162.78s:  We'll do a straddle.
3171.42s:  Short straddle got it.
3173.86s:  So let's say that we're going to pick a short straddle and I'm going to just turn it into
3180.90s:  a rough strategy off the top of my head so that we have something to work off of.
3186.82s:  So this now goes into the third level, which is position, which is exactly what we're
3195.22s:  going to talk about now.
3196.34s:  So I'll clear those off and we're going to have a short straddle.
3204.90s:  Let's say I'm going to trade this for various risk premiums.
3209.74s:  So I'm going to look for stocks that have higher IV relative to HV.
3216.90s:  And let's just say that's the starting point.
3221.30s:  Now for those that are familiar with the outlier strategy process, you know that step
3226.94s:  four is to build a strategy.
3232.86s:  One of the inputs for building a strategy is when we get more specific.
3237.90s:  This is where we pick things like our deltas, our days to expiration and so on.
3246.06s:  So the good part is with a straddle.
3248.22s:  It's still you, but case you don't know, you still have to pick your deltas.
3251.82s:  You don't have to have a centered straddle.
3253.50s:  You can have straddles that are off center, but most people will default to an at the
3257.70s:  money straddle.
3259.30s:  And that really generally holds true in this case.
3263.30s:  So the first Greek I'm looking at for this specific strategy, which is based on trading
3267.78s:  risk premiums, is the delta input.
3271.30s:  And the delta input in this context is I'm really trying to trade primarily the volatility
3277.70s:  side of things.
3278.70s:  So I'm not really looking to take a big directional bet.
3281.58s:  So I'm actually going to start with something that's probably close to at the money.
3288.34s:  Now what happens?
3290.58s:  If this strategy, fair answer is premium, which is entirely based around the difference
3297.90s:  between implied volatility and historic volatility, what happens if the underlying moves?
3302.66s:  Who could tell me?
3306.26s:  In terms of the position.
3312.58s:  As the underlying starts to move, there's going to be a couple key changes in the position.
3317.62s:  And these key changes matter to me, actually quite a lot.
3320.38s:  And I want to see if you know why.
3330.18s:  There you go.
3331.18s:  Tommy's on it.
3332.18s:  The delta's of the leg move.
3334.66s:  So as the stock goes up and down, the delta's will move.
3340.02s:  And the movement of the delta's, which we know what's going to measure that.
3345.14s:  Emma.
3346.90s:  So that's another thing I know I have to take a look at with this strategy.
3351.78s:  And believe it or not, we know that there's a relationship between gamma and days to expiration.
3358.18s:  So this also will inform this decision.
3363.50s:  So let's think about it.
3365.98s:  Because we as retail traders, we don't have the luxury of essentially continually being
3371.26s:  able to hedge.
3373.02s:  It's expensive for us to hedge.
3375.18s:  And at the onset of this, we know that we want our delta risk to be about zero ideal world.
3386.90s:  We don't want any delta risk.
3388.22s:  We want no directional risk because this idea is based on volatility imply versus historic.
3396.46s:  So that means that I'm really trying to center on Vega.
3401.22s:  I want Vega to be a much larger part of my actual PNL.
3408.58s:  So what do we know about Vega?
3411.86s:  We know based on the way that the Greeks behave and based on those other videos that I
3420.66s:  paired with you.
3422.06s:  But we know that Vega is DTE sensitive.
3427.06s:  And we know that Vega is higher as there's more extrinsic value.
3431.70s:  Where's more extrinsic value the further out in time you go.
3435.70s:  So if I'm trying to isolate my impact to Vega, do I want to trade super short term?
3441.78s:  Maybe it's not a no, but these are inputs to the decision cycle.
3447.10s:  So then let's say, well, maybe I do want to trade this shorter term.
3450.54s:  I think it might be better for X, Y and Z reason.
3453.34s:  I'm going to go into SPX.
3457.02s:  And let's just do like a 4 DTE obviously because the market's closed.
3462.46s:  And let's take a look at this at the money straddle the 61 15.
3467.50s:  And we can see that we're getting 53 delta on the call side.
3472.10s:  So let's take a look at this actual position.
3477.46s:  So I'm going to have I'm going to sell to open.
3482.26s:  One call.
3483.90s:  And then one put.
3485.54s:  And let's take a look at the Greek profile for this actually.
3491.02s:  It's probably easier to see.
3496.42s:  If I put it in a workbook.
3511.62s:  So let's take a look at these different positions.
3517.02s:  We're going to have Delta, gamma, data, Vega.
3522.62s:  I'm not going to worry about row row.
3524.98s:  We're always kind of like the bastard child that most people don't care about most of
3528.58s:  the time.
3529.58s:  That's kind of the reality.
3530.58s:  Row really impacts longer term options a lot more.
3533.42s:  And let's take a first look at the short call.
3537.58s:  So we said that we are going to be short.
3540.10s:  I'm going to move this off to the side.
3541.38s:  Now I just wanted you to see what I was in putting.
3543.02s:  I'll bring it back over.
3544.54s:  But I want to move it off to the side of that we can look through this little faster.
3549.46s:  So the short 61 15 call.
3553.78s:  What's going to happen there?
3554.78s:  What we're going to get negative 53 delta's.
3558.26s:  Our gamma is going to be negative 0.01.
3565.82s:  Our theta is going to be positive to 21.
3570.82s:  Our Vega is going to be negative 248.
3576.22s:  And then if we're short, the 61 15 puts our delta, we're going to get long 47 delta's
3588.22s:  for gamma.
3590.74s:  We're going to be short 0.01.
3595.02s:  For theta, we're going to get $1.79.
3604.66s:  And for Vega, we're going to be short 248.
3610.26s:  So let's take a look at this position so far.
3622.14s:  If I net these out, here's what I can expect to see on a daily basis.
3634.10s:  I can expect to make about $4.00 in theta.
3636.94s:  I have about negative 5 Vega.
3641.34s:  I'm negative 0.02 gamma and negative 0.06 delta.
3645.14s:  So you notice right from the onset, I'm not even delta neutral.
3649.46s:  So the entire origin of this position, if you'll remember, is I don't want any directional
3654.54s:  risk.
3655.62s:  I want to be able to just trade Vega.
3658.18s:  I care about the volatility side of this equation.
3660.30s:  I don't give a crap.
3661.30s:  I don't have an opinion on the direction side of things.
3665.50s:  So now I have some choices.
3668.98s:  I understand the Greeks.
3672.62s:  I can figure out this is going to be a theoretical exercise.
3676.78s:  In reality, we use what's called delta bands.
3681.70s:  And that means that we don't hedge the delta as it moves every single time.
3687.38s:  It's just unrealistic.
3690.14s:  So the way we use delta bands is we say if delta gets to this point or this point, I will
3697.38s:  recenter the delta's.
3699.26s:  That's a suboptimal approach, but it's a realistic approach.
3703.10s:  And it's because there's a cost associated with the hedge.
3708.74s:  So important general context.
3712.22s:  So that's the facade from a theoretical perspective.
3716.42s:  Let's say that we want to keep our delta's zero.
3718.46s:  We want to be flat.
3719.46s:  Okay.
3720.46s:  So what do we have to do?
3721.46s:  We're going to buy six shares.
3722.46s:  That's easy.
3723.46s:  So then we're going to buy to open six shares.
3727.38s:  That's going to give us six delta's.
3729.94s:  I should do.
3732.34s:  Just to keep it the same.
3737.22s:  So it's essentially going to flatten out these delta's.
3739.54s:  I don't want to confuse you.
3741.50s:  I'm just going to multiply all these by 100.
3754.38s:  So then if I grab six shares, my new net position in terms of delta is flat.
3762.30s:  Great.
3763.30s:  Mission accomplished.
3764.30s:  There is a problem.
3768.70s:  Locking gamma.
3771.30s:  As soon as this moves, my delta's are going to move.
3782.10s:  So my transacting in the shares does precisely jack shit for the gamma.
3792.58s:  So how do I clear off this gamma?
3810.22s:  I got to use options.
3814.14s:  That's the way that I can actually get rid of some of this gamma.
3821.70s:  So one of the ways that I can get rid of gamma is I can find something and I can trade
3830.02s:  an unrelated option that essentially offset some of this.
3835.90s:  What is soon as I do that, all of these other things are going to change.
3840.54s:  So the way that we actually maintain delta neutrality for something like a short straddle,
3846.82s:  if we're actually trying to trade a specific effect like variance risk premium is I use
3854.54s:  the Greeks to understand the overall position that I have.
3859.18s:  And then I can make adjustments.
3860.46s:  So the way that I would do this is actually not by buying shares upfront to flatten the
3864.78s:  deltas.
3866.10s:  This is kind of like putting a bandaid over a gaping wound.
3870.74s:  It doesn't actually fix the problem.
3872.70s:  The problem is going to come from my gamma.
3875.74s:  So I can flatten the gamma by buying options that offset this.
3883.02s:  Then I can delta hedge the remaining deltas off based on whatever that residual is.
3890.18s:  Now that becomes more complex because if I'm trying to sell straddles, I'm essentially
3895.54s:  saying I think there's variance risk premium, but then I'm coming in here and I'm buying
3898.82s:  options to offset the gamma.
3900.62s:  So it's a choice.
3901.62s:  It's a business decision.
3902.62s:  Do you want to truly isolate gamma?
3904.42s:  How long is your position going to be open?
3906.06s:  How impactful is the gamma going to be?
3909.22s:  You can decide how you want to deal with gamma or you can just set more aggressive delta
3914.10s:  bands entirely up to you.
3917.54s:  But for me, a lot of times, I will try to find positions that are easier to manage for
3924.34s:  something like this, but going back to the original point of how to use the Greeks in
3931.82s:  something like a straddle is we define as always the profit mechanism that we're trying
3937.18s:  to trade.
3938.18s:  In this case, I use variance risk premiums for the example.
3941.06s:  And then I started listing out the specific effects that I'm trying to isolate.
3947.42s:  And based on those effects, I can literally quantify the impacts of these different positions,
3962.06s:  net them out, and then attain the actual risk that I want.
3969.34s:  Let's do unomas.
3971.42s:  And then we'll have plenty of time for like Q&A and stuff.
3975.18s:  I want to pick another example.
3978.22s:  I'm thinking something like buying calls or selling puts, something like that.
3985.54s:  But you guys can pick if we want to do either of those.
3993.34s:  That's what I'm thinking.
3994.66s:  And really the main reason why I want to do that is because I think there's a little
4000.98s:  bit we can probably pull out of it.
4004.98s:  One calls good.
4005.98s:  I love it.
4008.54s:  And you read my mind, by the way, Tommy, thank you very much for giving me the scenario
4017.10s:  of trying to play a big move because that's going to be one of the first questions.
4021.68s:  But before we do that, I need to finish my dinner order really fast.
4026.98s:  And for Valentine's Day, my wife oddly wants to jack in the box, which I have to be honest
4034.22s:  we essentially never eat that shit.
4037.22s:  But I'm a romantic at heart.
4043.14s:  So jack in the box we go.
4048.06s:  And I'm not like afraid of jack in the box.
4053.30s:  I just think this stuff is fucking awful for you.
4057.94s:  It's like just straight disease food.
4067.30s:  But every once in a while, I feel like you got to put some trash in your body to remind
4071.82s:  it to not be you delicate.
4079.10s:  Here we go.
4081.10s:  Okay.
4082.10s:  So this was in a straddle.
4091.62s:  And then now we are at 108.5.
4097.86s:  And then this will be how to use the Greeks in a long call.
4103.94s:  Okay.
4106.94s:  So along this is another just really, really common scenario.
4113.78s:  And I actually have a video that goes through this in detail.
4119.02s:  Let me find it for you.
4126.90s:  Here.
4136.86s:  So this video will talk about buying call options.
4145.02s:  And let's take a look at a practical example.
4149.46s:  So in Tommy's scenario, he was talking about wanting to trade something for a much more
4162.42s:  pronounced directional move.
4165.74s:  So let's say that we're looking at Ion Cueks.
4168.50s:  I was looking at this earlier.
4170.30s:  Actually, I think another probably better example like Nvidia.
4176.26s:  So a lot of people have been trying to figure out how to play this move in Nvidia.
4178.94s:  I think this is fairly topical.
4180.50s:  Now one of the notes that has earnings coming up, that's important to know because with
4184.82s:  earnings coming up, you have to either acknowledge that you're going to hold through earnings
4189.38s:  or not hold through earnings.
4190.70s:  And it's entirely your choice.
4192.26s:  But this is a binary move.
4195.10s:  Now when we're trading long options, there are effectively for specifically long calls,
4202.62s:  there are two things that we are trying to gain exposure to.
4207.14s:  The primary top line item though is gamma.
4212.62s:  We are trying to find something that is likely to move and it's likely to move a lot.
4220.90s:  But that really comes down to leverage.
4225.46s:  That's the only reason why you trade something like a long call versus buying the stock.
4235.10s:  That's just for leverage.
4237.26s:  So if we take a look at buying 100 shares of Nvidia, but I wanted to buy 100 shares of
4242.26s:  Nvidia, I need to call up 13,885 bucks, which I may or may not want to call up, right?
4253.14s:  The other thing I can do is go super far out in time and I can buy an option that's super
4260.50s:  deep in the money, like an 80 delta.
4264.06s:  And I can essentially control 80 shares of Nvidia at this point, 80 shares of Nvidia, and
4271.82s:  I can pay 45, 100 bucks, call it.
4277.38s:  So for a fraction of the price, I can essentially control the same size position.
4281.86s:  This is an example of using options essentially as a stock replacement.
4287.58s:  Now, the way that we can structure our options trade based on our idea changes and we use
4295.46s:  the Greeks to do it.
4297.38s:  So let's say that we think there's going to be a big up move in Nvidia, big parabolic
4302.30s:  up move for whatever reason.
4303.86s:  Maybe we see the CEO sign another titty or who knows, he might pull another chip out of
4309.94s:  another oven that people really like.
4313.22s:  Sky's the limit here.
4315.98s:  So let's say that scenario happens, we think it's going to happen, there's going to be a big
4321.14s:  move.
4322.82s:  There are a handful of choices that we have to move through in order to arrive at the
4329.82s:  actual position that we're going to put on.
4332.10s:  So one of those choices is days to expiration.
4336.22s:  Another one of those choices is delta.
4338.42s:  Another one of those choices is gamma.
4340.18s:  Another one of those choices is theta.
4342.78s:  So let's see how we can actually build a position that truly reflects our idea.
4349.50s:  If we think Nvidia is going to move a lot, let's take a look at a couple examples.
4354.66s:  Let's do a seven day and we'll do something that's like at the money.
4360.66s:  So this option has 50 delta and it's only $290, right?
4367.42s:  So it's pretty cheap.
4369.30s:  And so before I was telling you that you have to cough up like 4500 bucks to control 80
4374.06s:  shares.
4375.06s:  This is putting up 290 bucks to control 50 shares.
4377.38s:  You just do two of them, pay five, $600 and control even more shares.
4383.10s:  So from that perspective, it seems way better, right?
4386.34s:  Doesn't it?
4387.34s:  It does to me.
4388.34s:  Here's the problem.
4389.34s:  If you take a look at the theta, theta on these options is losing 24 cents a day.
4396.90s:  So if we look at that in relation to the overall premium, call it 290, losing 24 cents,
4406.94s:  essentially 10% of the options premium is going to go away per day.
4413.06s:  The reason why that matters is because it then moves the goal post against you to get
4419.42s:  the move in your favor.
4420.42s:  And I'll show you what I mean by this.
4422.70s:  So let's say we get in at that 290 handle again, just for the example.
4427.78s:  And let's zoom this out.
4429.82s:  So let's pretend that a day passes right now.
4435.94s:  Our P&L is negative $2.50.
4437.74s:  It's just using the midpoint.
4439.18s:  So don't pay any mind to that.
4441.74s:  Let me get rid of one of these extra slices and probably this one.
4446.74s:  So it's about unchanged, right?
4449.42s:  On the day.
4450.42s:  Great.
4451.42s:  One day.
4454.38s:  What starts to happen here?
4456.74s:  Well, what will start to happen is you'll notice that this purple line is actually going
4461.50s:  to move down towards that blue line.
4464.38s:  So if I fast forward another day, another day, all of a sudden the stock hasn't moved
4470.06s:  against me.
4471.26s:  It hasn't moved for me, but I'm starting to lose money.
4475.54s:  That sucks.
4476.54s:  Why am I losing money?
4477.54s:  Well, I'm losing money because of theta decay.
4480.54s:  So one of the inputs to your decision cycle here, understanding the Greeks, is that the
4485.62s:  cost for the leverage you get through a long call is theta decay.
4491.62s:  The downside to this is let's say that you were expecting originally, maybe in video,
4501.54s:  what's the current price?
4503.14s:  In video is at 138.
4505.22s:  So let's say that you were expecting it to go to 140, 142, something like that.
4515.14s:  The issue here is if I continue to fast forward time, what ends up happening is I need a bigger
4522.22s:  and bigger move in order for this thing to get even back to break even, let alone to make
4528.98s:  money.
4530.90s:  That's the issue that you face.
4533.26s:  So that's the downside to using the cheaper at the money options that expire soon.
4540.50s:  And again, this is using a smaller position.
4542.22s:  Really, we would have a too lot on right now to simulate the same size.
4546.54s:  And if it doesn't move quickly enough in your favor, you bleed out through theta decay.
4552.02s:  Okay, cool.
4554.06s:  What's the other benefit of this?
4555.86s:  Well, I just showed you that I can buy more of them.
4559.30s:  And we also know that the effect of gamma is the closer we get to expiration, gamma is
4564.90s:  going to go up.
4566.54s:  So I also get the effect of my delta rapidly compounding, which is awesome.
4574.94s:  What's the charge for that?
4576.86s:  The charge for that is theta decay is literally the highest at this point.
4585.02s:  So then if we use the other example of going further out in time, what happens?
4591.46s:  Well, if I use this 80 delta option, let's take a look at what my gamma is, how fast
4597.66s:  I'm going to compound.
4599.98s:  Fucking zero.
4600.98s:  It's not actually zero.
4601.98s:  It's just further decimal points in.
4603.62s:  This is only going to two decimal points.
4605.34s:  So it's like three, four decimal points in the broader point here is that you're actually
4612.34s:  not going to compound that much.
4614.82s:  You're so far out in time that your gamma is about flat.
4618.02s:  That kind of sucks.
4619.58s:  Why would I want that?
4621.10s:  Well, because if we take a look at our theta decay, our theta decay is just four cents.
4627.46s:  So if we look at that four cents relative to the total premium that we're buying into,
4632.14s:  it's very, very small.
4635.02s:  So what's the trade off here?
4636.90s:  The trade off by going further out in time is I'm buying something that's way more expensive.
4642.42s:  I can lose more money in total, but it's a little bit of a down payment style situation.
4649.14s:  Because as long as this thing doesn't move super far against me and I'm directionally
4652.30s:  wrong entirely on a per day basis, I'm going to pay less theta even as a gross dollar
4659.10s:  amount, but definitely as a percentage, I'm going to give up the gamma.
4664.10s:  I'm not going to have anywhere near as much gamma unless I get a really big move in my
4667.90s:  favor.
4669.46s:  So this is how we can use the Greeks in something like a long call to decide what position
4676.46s:  makes the most sense for our idea.
4680.30s:  So going back to Nvidia, if our idea is Jensen's about to sign another titty and Nvidia's
4687.50s:  going to go skyrocket, I can make more money by not going as far out in time, by being
4693.62s:  closer in time and buying more of the options and allowing them to compound.
4698.86s:  If I don't know that that's going to happen, and my idea is more so that Nvidia got beaten
4704.30s:  down because of deep sea coming out and then the market having this crazy, giant reaction,
4709.86s:  but Nvidia is still exceedingly well positioned to take advantage of this long term, and this
4715.18s:  is likely short term sentiment.
4717.66s:  So I think it's going to rally back up at some point.
4720.34s:  Let's pretend that that was back in this time frame somewhere down here.
4724.18s:  Then I go further out in time.
4726.10s:  I accept the fact that it's going to be slightly more expensive, but I have a position that
4731.54s:  can be maintained for longer durations.
4735.86s:  So these are some literally basic examples of how we can use the Greeks to inform our
4742.72s:  decision making.
4744.30s:  And I'll give you one more example that's fairly recent for me, which is Palantir, I put
4752.14s:  this trade on, and in Palantir, it's a ratio called diagonal.
4757.66s:  So this is something that's designed to be a longer term trade.
4761.02s:  So the way that I built this trade is I went further out in time.
4765.86s:  I'll tell you where I went.
4768.62s:  I went out to the 16 Jan 26 and I had bought the 110s.
4777.18s:  So they were essentially right at the money.
4779.46s:  When I first got them, they were 64 delta.
4781.38s:  Now there are 69 delta.
4785.30s:  So I've gotten 0.05 delta's added to it in the price movement since I've been in it.
4791.86s:  So what have I done here?
4794.78s:  I've found a very delicate balance for the idea that I'm trying to trade.
4799.90s:  I wanted something that I can hold on to for maybe three, six months.
4805.10s:  So I go this far out in time so that I accept much lighter overall theta decay.
4811.18s:  But because I know that they're stated to K, what I can do is I can sell near term options
4816.50s:  against it, not to make a bunch of money off the short options, but because I understand
4822.30s:  the Greeks.
4823.54s:  So I'm losing theta in that long option position.
4827.50s:  So if I come in here and I sell premium, I'm now long theta.
4832.54s:  And in this case, I can see how much theta I'm gaining per day, 10 cents per day, just
4837.90s:  using this option as an example of the 140s.
4841.30s:  So I make 10 cents per day in theta on this trade.
4844.54s:  But then if I go out to this trade here and I analyze how much I'm losing per day, I'm
4849.78s:  losing five cents.
4851.78s:  Sick.
4852.78s:  So I can offset the daily theta decay via the shorter term position to subsidize the holding
4859.38s:  cost of the long option so that I can still enjoy the benefit of a leveraged directional
4866.62s:  position, but I can reduce the total cost I'm paying to do this.
4871.78s:  So this is another way to use the Greeks.
4875.90s:  I am going to pause here, open the door for Thor so we can go get his dinner.
4879.74s:  And then I would love to talk about any specific questions you guys have.
4884.50s:  And then I want to talk about these two misconceptions.
4887.82s:  We already covered the first one, but then we'll hit the second one.
4905.78s:  So the context here, mexi says so a calendar spread.
4909.42s:  What about a calendar spread?
4915.06s:  Talk to me.
4916.54s:  Talk to me, send your mexi.
4921.26s:  Talk to me about this calendar spread.
4925.18s:  Oh, he's asking about the position that I had on.
4932.78s:  Wait, is that right?
4935.30s:  See, are you asking about the position that I had on?
4942.30s:  No, I mean technically, technically it is a spread.
4950.66s:  It's not wrong.
4951.90s:  Most people will take the term spread and they'll automatically apply it to verticals, right?
4961.58s:  So the point of verticals is obviously very different.
4965.70s:  But for example, to mexi's, I'm not exactly sure what mexi, if you were referring to the
4972.26s:  position, but technically you could call it horizontal.
4975.94s:  It's not, I wouldn't exactly call it a calendar spread.
4979.22s:  So horizontal spread calendar spread, it's about the same thing.
4982.02s:  The way to think about spreads is you can go vertical or horizontal.
4985.66s:  vertical is in the same term, but higher or lower from whatever the base leg is.
4992.62s:  And then horizontal is using the time series component going out and time or in and time.
4998.22s:  Now technically speaking, if I were to look at a true calendar spread, it would be the
5004.66s:  same option that I'm looking at.
5006.98s:  And a calendar spread is designed to do a specific thing.
5009.78s:  This technically speaking is called a is a diagonal spread.
5015.10s:  The reason why it's called a diagonal spread is because I'm combining two things.
5020.58s:  I'm combining a change in strike going vertical.
5025.22s:  And then I'm also going horizontal.
5027.74s:  So what happens if I combined vertical and horizontal, fucking diagonal?
5032.82s:  It's one of the easy things about options, no mink nature.
5037.02s:  Really, the very little soak it up because there's very few instances of anything in this
5043.18s:  stuff that make any fucking sense whatsoever.
5045.78s:  But that is one of them.
5047.26s:  So technically it's called a diagonal spread.
5049.70s:  Now the more important element is the different directions we can go, but then also the relationship
5060.46s:  between the legs and the ratio of legs.
5064.50s:  This is the stuff that I will trade will be a ratio in some capacity.
5069.30s:  So back to this, this idea that there is a best Greek, what is the Greek I should get,
5077.06s:  what Greeks should I use?
5080.42s:  The reality is there is no best Greek.
5084.50s:  What you should do is use the Greeks, guide the position that you want.
5092.82s:  They inform via all of the different inputs how your position is going to behave.
5099.50s:  And then you run that through the filter of is this what I want?
5104.34s:  Another really simple example going back to the straddles.
5109.58s:  Let's say that I was trading the straddles from the context of an earnings release.
5117.38s:  And we'll literally let's fucking do an example.
5121.54s:  Let's go to last after the market.
5128.38s:  I'm going to find something that's like reasonable.
5134.94s:  Now let's do Mondalees.
5139.74s:  Let's go back to the fourth of Feb.
5142.62s:  We're going to go back in time.
5143.62s:  And I'm literally going to give you two different traits so that you can see exactly what this
5146.94s:  is.
5151.94s:  I learned best personally through seeing shit, practical application.
5158.42s:  So we're going to take a look at what did I say Mondalees?
5169.66s:  Right now it's loading.
5173.66s:  Damn boy.
5177.06s:  Look at that.
5181.22s:  Let's say that we want to trade this for earnings.
5183.90s:  So I think in this scenario earnings is after the close on this day.
5189.38s:  So technically speaking for an actual earnings play, I would get in much later.
5194.94s:  We'll just do that really quick so that it's at least somewhat accurate.
5200.18s:  And then I want to take a look at two different things.
5203.78s:  I want to take a look at selling the straddle in 7 Feb and then selling the straddle on 21
5208.82s:  March.
5209.82s:  I actually don't fully remember what happened with this one if it worked or didn't work.
5213.78s:  But that doesn't actually matter.
5217.10s:  All right, where's the best choice looks like this one?
5223.06s:  So we'll throw this in there.
5224.38s:  It's going to look all fucked up because the days are fucked up in here.
5226.94s:  Don't pay attention to the risk profile.
5230.30s:  And then let's take a look at this one.
5234.54s:  Okay.
5237.62s:  We have our two straddles.
5238.74s:  They're locked in 232 and 420.
5241.42s:  Diginy.
5242.42s:  Let's fast forward time.
5244.26s:  So we're literally just going to take it one day forward because the hypothesis that
5249.18s:  I'm trying to trade is various risk premiums.
5253.46s:  So I'm trying to trade various risk premiums through earnings.
5257.46s:  I'm not trying to trade the straddle in this long term.
5261.26s:  I'm simply taking it through earnings.
5263.86s:  The other thing I'm doing is I'm taking it closer to the morning so that we can observe
5270.10s:  what this looks like.
5274.98s:  So first things first, our first straddle that we put on for 420 is now trading at $3.75.
5287.34s:  So when from 420 to 375, this is the 44-day to expiration straddle.
5292.66s:  If I go to the 7th, we put this straddle on for wrong one for 232.
5303.86s:  This one is now trading at $1.25, actually $5.00.
5311.18s:  Somewhere in here, let's call it $0.80, $0.90, something like that.
5316.78s:  So what happened here?
5319.30s:  The Greeks happened here because I'm trying to trade the earnings release itself.
5327.74s:  Valtility is going to be centered in the term that has the actual earnings release.
5337.94s:  That's what's happening here.
5340.02s:  So this moved way more, not because it has higher theta decay, that's part of it, but
5345.06s:  that's not why it moved so much more.
5348.46s:  Because we can literally do the math on the theta that should have came out.
5352.18s:  It should have been like $0.10, $0.14 on this side and $0.9 on this side, right?
5358.42s:  But over $1 came out, so it's not theta.
5361.70s:  What happened was a contraction in volatility.
5366.86s:  And because that volatility was primarily in this term versus this term, that's why it
5374.70s:  made so much more money.
5376.86s:  So in this context, based on my thesis and my trade idea, I know it makes more sense
5385.02s:  to trade this expiration cycle versus this expiration cycle.
5389.78s:  It's because this one actually grants me exposure to the effect I'm trying to capitalize
5394.82s:  on.
5395.82s:  This one does not.
5397.30s:  This one still made money, but it made way less money.
5401.14s:  And it's for those reasons.
5404.02s:  The Greeks literally tell you all of this, all of it.
5409.34s:  You just have to pay attention.
5411.34s:  They're there.
5415.38s:  Any other questions?
5417.10s:  I hope that the general concepts that we're talking about and the approach that we're
5421.62s:  talking about makes sense to you.
5424.34s:  This is something that's built over time.
5426.54s:  So don't let it overwhelm you.
5428.06s:  You don't have to know all of this at once.
5429.66s:  And one of my most important piece of advice to you is that you don't have to remember
5434.62s:  all this shit.
5435.86s:  What I used to do is I had a cheat sheet that I would reference that would help me understand
5442.34s:  how the premium of my option would behave based on all of these different conditions.
5447.78s:  That's exactly what I would use.
5449.98s:  So you can make your own cheat sheet.
5452.90s:  And I think it's important to make your own cheat sheet because the process of making
5457.62s:  it is part of the learning process.
5460.18s:  So it's valuable to do so.
5463.22s:  But if you go through those steps, you literally will make much better trade decisions that
5474.66s:  help you isolate what you're actually trying to trade.
5479.46s:  That's the broad idea.
5481.26s:  So that is a practical application of using the Greeks as an options trader.
5491.38s:  So if we take a look at what we have next for our series, next on our hit list is navigating
5502.66s:  the options chain.
5504.58s:  So the next video that we're going to do, we're going to talk about how to look through
5509.22s:  and identify opportunities, how to analyze things like liquidity, how to see if the options
5518.46s:  chain is telling you anything because very frequently it does simply if you pay the
5524.14s:  pocket tension.
5525.86s:  And then after that, we will have technical analysis, fundamental analysis, how to build
5532.58s:  a trade strategy process portfolio management, and then the actual trading process itself.
5538.34s:  And then we still have a handful of flex sessions.
5541.70s:  So this is still designed to be about 15 episodes.
5544.98s:  We are now obviously wrapping up episode six.
5549.50s:  And my intention is to fill these flex sessions with really whatever you want.
5557.78s:  So one of my ideas, the reason I'm talking to you about this is to get your input is
5563.86s:  I definitely think it makes sense to slot in a general Q and A. I don't know where
5569.82s:  you prefer to do that.
5571.50s:  I think it actually would make sense before the options chain or before building a trade
5580.50s:  itself.
5581.50s:  I think those are the two logical places for the like general overarching Q and A. And then
5591.46s:  I was planning on doing a second one at the very end.
5594.62s:  So then if there's a specific options trading topic that you really want to spend more
5599.70s:  time drilling in as we go through these, that's what the remaining flex session will be
5604.02s:  used for.
5605.26s:  But if you have a preference on when the Q and A is, let me know the reason why I'm asking
5609.70s:  if you have a preference is because it really depends on if you feel like you're at a point
5613.38s:  that you have questions that are like burning in your brain that you're trying to get an
5618.46s:  answer for that you're not able to find on your own.
5621.58s:  But that happens when you get to a critical mass of kind of knowing enough to then have
5626.18s:  questions, right?
5627.42s:  If you're so new, then you kind of don't know what you don't know.
5630.58s:  And then it might make sense to hold off for a little bit.
5633.78s:  So if you have a preference, let me know.
5637.86s:  Reese says before building a trade, cool.
5640.30s:  I will earmark that and then everybody else, you can just let me know as we work through
5646.50s:  the rest of the content.
5650.18s:  As always, if you need anything, let me know.
5655.26s:  Be an outlier.
5656.26s:  I'll see you all later.
