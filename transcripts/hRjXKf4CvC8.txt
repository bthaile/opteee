0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: you
120.00s: you
150.00s: you
180.00s: you
210.00s: you
240.00s: you
270.00s: you
300.00s: you
302.00s: you
310.00s: you
312.00s: you
320.00s: you
326.00s: you
328.00s: What is up to all the outliers?
331.14s: I hope the week was awesome.
332.70s: And I know today's Valentine's Day,
336.00s: a day that I think is absolutely absurd.
339.52s: I think you should be nice to people
340.90s: throughout the entire year.
342.58s: But that aside, there is no better Valentine
347.68s: than making the decision to stop lighting your money on fire,
353.20s: trying to learn how to trade options
355.48s: and to actually make some money.
358.08s: So that maybe you could take your partner out
360.40s: to a nice dinner or maybe take them on a trip somewhere
364.84s: as compared to the usual light the money on fire
368.44s: and then go hang out in the Wendy's parking lot
372.68s: behind a dumpster.
373.76s: So I argue by attending today,
377.20s: you really are a romantic.
379.68s: That's what that, that's exactly what's happening right now.
383.04s: So the agenda for today is pretty straightforward.
387.40s: We're gonna take a look first at a quiz.
392.12s: We're gonna do a little bit of a recap
394.90s: from the last episode on volatility.
398.30s: And then we're gonna dive into the world of the Greeks.
401.10s: Now you can already see up behind me
402.76s: and this has been up for like five minutes now
405.20s: during the holding period.
406.64s: So hopefully everybody had a chance to take a look
412.12s: through what's up here now.
413.76s: And then also to take a look through those two videos
416.92s: that I've shared yesterday in the discord
420.24s: and then also on X, if not, I will throw both of those videos
424.80s: in here now.
425.76s: This is actually reverse order by accident.
429.00s: So watch the second link first and then the first link.
436.32s: So the goal for our conversation around the Greeks today
441.04s: is to essentially be a hybrid, a blend
443.36s: between those two videos that I sent you.
445.52s: The second video goes through literally all of the Greeks,
448.60s: well, most of them that you would come into contact with.
451.76s: And it gives you the fundamental understanding of what they are.
455.88s: That the first video, which is the second one you should watch,
461.36s: gives you how to actually use the Greeks
466.04s: to fine tune your trades.
468.76s: So the session today is going to do a little bit of both.
472.88s: We're going to do a run through.
474.52s: I want to help you visualize how the Greeks behave
477.92s: in different time frames.
479.72s: And then I want to help you think about actually using them
484.16s: to make trading decisions.
487.04s: So let's get started with a quiz.
493.84s: So last time we spoke about volatility.
496.92s: So the first question here,
498.52s: what does IV measure?
502.40s: What does implied volatility measure?
505.12s: Feel free, just throw it in the chat.
506.92s: And if you're watching the recording,
509.00s: you can write it down, throw it as a comment, whatever you want.
512.12s: But give yourself an opportunity to actually see
514.76s: if you know it without looking it up first.
519.24s: Now, the reason why we spend a lot of time
523.20s: talking about the ins and outs of volatility is because volatility
527.52s: is essentially the heart and soul of options trading.
534.76s: Kevin says future movement expected.
538.64s: James says market consensus a future price range.
542.16s: Both of those are acceptable.
544.52s: Lauren says market expectations decent.
549.08s: Pause, he says perception of market gods.
551.16s: That's probably the most accurate.
553.92s: Expected move.
555.68s: One standard deviation of expected move.
557.64s: Thank you, Shrej.
558.52s: So Shrej already read my mind for everybody
562.76s: that was mentioning expected move.
565.60s: There's an amplifying data point.
567.52s: That's really, really important.
569.28s: Really, really important.
571.16s: The reason why it's really important to acknowledge the fact
574.68s: that this is a one standard deviation move
578.00s: is because there's not an insignificant number of data points
582.32s: that will fall outside of that distribution.
585.20s: So let's take a look at an Eric special terrible drawing
592.20s: that probably is going to add more obscurity
594.40s: to what I'm trying to show you.
595.56s: But it's the effort that counts, right?
597.52s: That's what they say.
598.36s: Fun fact is not the effort that counts.
599.80s: It's the fucking output that counts always.
601.60s: But the output of this is I enjoy attempting to draw
605.80s: and confusing everybody.
607.40s: So okay, so here we have a mean.
612.20s: So what we're talking about a one standard deviation
622.20s: who know who knows.
632.20s: Please.
637.40s: So when we're talking about a one standard deviation,
642.20s: expectation of forward price movement
644.84s: that represents this range.
648.00s: Inside this range is 68% of occurrences.
654.92s: If we go to this second standard deviation,
658.52s: it expands 95.
662.12s: The reason why this is important is because a non-trivial
667.00s: number of movements will fall outside
670.88s: of this 68% probability.
673.84s: So a lot of people will say,
675.48s: oh, the expected range is 10 points.
678.24s: And then they're blown away when it moves outside
682.84s: of 10 points, for example.
684.84s: You cannot be blown away in that instance,
687.20s: especially if you understand what we're talking about.
689.44s: Now the fact that it is a one standard deviation expectation.
693.28s: Okay, next, what is variance?
698.28s: What does variance measure?
705.20s: Now the cool part is some of these things are actually
707.28s: also giving you an inherent introduction
711.84s: to basic statistics, specifically as it applies to trading.
715.28s: That'll be something that we're gonna take a look at.
719.96s: Steve Shop, that's a fun name, is saying
723.76s: standard deviation squared, okay?
729.28s: What do we got?
731.88s: Anybody else?
737.08s: James says spread of data over a time series.
741.52s: I would take it.
745.48s: Joe says difference between price and expected move.
748.12s: That's a good guess, but that's incorrect in this context.
751.04s: Now what you're talking about is completely cracked,
753.28s: the variance, right?
754.20s: The difference between unexpected and observed outcome.
757.24s: So full credit for the try there,
759.56s: but in this context, that's not what we're talking about.
762.76s: So when we're trying to understand
766.04s: the movement pattern of something,
768.48s: let's say that we have a line of best fit.
772.92s: And let's say we have data points
775.20s: that are plotted randomly around it.
780.72s: What we can do is we can figure out
787.20s: what the difference is between all of these individual data points
792.20s: and then we can assess how different they are
796.20s: from the total average.
798.20s: So we can look at variance a bunch of different ways
801.20s: in the context of markets.
802.20s: We have a very specific way of looking at it.
805.20s: But the high level note that I want you to pay attention
808.20s: to when with respect to variance is essentially
813.20s: the dispersion of something around a mean
817.20s: and the frequency of the dispersion.
820.20s: So we can understand if something has very high variance,
825.20s: which will bleed over into standard deviations and volatility,
829.20s: volatility is essentially just variance square root.
834.20s: And the real difference between the two
837.48s: and the reason why we do things like we figure out the mean
843.48s: between each point and we square it each one.
849.32s: The reason why we do the squaring process
851.16s: is because it normalizes all of the signs.
853.44s: The stuff above this is a plus sign.
855.72s: The stuff below this is a negative sign.
857.84s: You can't add those together cleanly.
860.92s: They also allow us to exacerbate some of the movements
864.56s: to see them more clearly.
865.72s: But most of the time when we're observing volatility,
868.52s: we're going to get back down to the base level,
871.04s: which is why we then later take the square root of it.
875.64s: So the important thing to remember with variance
878.24s: is it gives us an idea of how the data points
881.72s: of something behave compared to the average.
884.40s: And it's a really important use case with respect
887.64s: to trying to track volatility going forward
890.20s: and measure what it is.
892.28s: Okay, last one, what is the difference
895.20s: between historic volatility and realized volatility?
905.68s: What you got?
907.60s: Now, for those that were in the session last week,
910.56s: you will remember that we spent a little while talking about
914.04s: the different kinds of volatility that exist,
916.84s: what they mean, why they matter.
919.28s: And this one is actually a fairly important one.
924.00s: So I'm actually eager to see what you guys say about this one.
930.32s: And then I need to update our little timestamps
934.80s: that I can figure out when we got to the quiz,
937.04s: which is like 840 while you're throwing your answers in.
942.12s: 840, please.
950.00s: No guesses?
955.44s: So you salamanders on it.
956.96s: Yeah, very empty.
957.80s: No guesses.
959.24s: What's the difference?
961.16s: So,
963.08s: traces historic volatility would actually happen
965.52s: realized can be future.
967.12s: Yeah, exactly.
967.96s: There we go.
968.80s: That's exactly correct.
970.32s: So it's a nuanced question.
973.64s: So historic volatility is always a measure of what happened.
977.64s: And typically speaking, it's using longer term ranges.
981.60s: Realized volatility can be backwards looking
984.56s: or forwards looking.
986.40s: You can have future realized ball
988.68s: or you can have realized ball looking at historic data point.
992.84s: Now, the important note here is that the way realize volatility
996.28s: and historic volatility when they're calculated
998.40s: rearwards looking is slightly different.
1000.56s: In general, we use them interchangeably,
1002.52s: but there is a slight difference between this job.
1007.88s: Let's jump into our recap.
1010.60s: I got a pop up in the door for a thought.
1021.44s: All right.
1025.52s: So last time, we essentially did all things volatility.
1031.32s: We learned why it matters how it behaves,
1037.52s: how to analyze it,
1039.52s: how we can use volatility to give us
1042.52s: tradable information in terms of expected ranges.
1045.52s: We looked at things like the curvature
1048.52s: of volatility through things like term structure, smile.
1053.52s: We looked at the volatility surface.
1058.52s: The volatility surface, we looked at skew
1062.52s: the difference between same term,
1065.68s: volatilities.
1067.44s: And we learned that volatility is one of the more predictable
1072.44s: elements of markets.
1073.64s: And it's one of the few examples of a true mean
1078.24s: reverting assets.
1080.84s: And you can break it out as its own asset class
1083.24s: or you could just look at it as a true mean reverting effect
1087.00s: depending on how you're visualizing volatility.
1090.16s: This is very different than when we look at something
1092.16s: like price.
1093.56s: So not only does it inform the way that we build
1097.08s: options trades, not only does it inform the way
1099.32s: that we analyze and visualize the market,
1102.08s: but it also gives us the opportunity to trade
1106.48s: a very predictable effect, which is important
1111.32s: for those traders out there.
1113.32s: Sick.
1114.32s: That is our recap.
1116.60s: Onto today, which is about the Greeks.
1120.52s: So your TLO, your terminal learning objective for today
1124.32s: is to have an idea on how to use the Greeks
1129.56s: to make better trades.
1131.72s: That is the ultimate endpoint of the session.
1136.72s: So notice how it's not to know the Greeks.
1140.36s: Yes, you have to know the Greeks.
1142.44s: But the main point here is that knowing the Greeks
1145.84s: is not enough.
1148.00s: So introduction to the Greeks.
1153.32s: We need to always remember why we're learning this stuff.
1157.36s: I refer to it as putting first things first.
1161.08s: And it's like a lot of times traders,
1164.52s: when they're trying to solve a problem,
1165.96s: they accidentally start trying to optimize for the wrong thing.
1170.04s: So in the example here, we need to understand how we use the Greeks,
1175.12s: not to know what they are, not because it's fun,
1178.04s: but because we use them to literally make better trading decisions.
1183.48s: So I have a couple misconceptions up here.
1186.40s: If you have others, I would absolutely
1189.08s: love to capture those.
1190.76s: The two primary ones that I have here
1193.08s: are that the Greeks provide an edge,
1197.44s: and that there is a best Greek.
1201.64s: And these aren't things that I'm kind of like just making up.
1204.48s: These are things that I have literally come across
1209.68s: in my conversations on places like Reddit.
1213.16s: And I'll actually show you this, not in this post.
1216.08s: This is somebody else's post I wanted to talk about in this post.
1220.32s: Let me find...
1226.40s: There is a specific person...
1229.12s: No, no...
1248.76s: There's a bunch of comments on this one, so we'll find it.
1253.96s: Aha, so here's one.
1256.60s: So this is from an actual post that I made.
1262.28s: This is one comment.
1266.96s: Okay, try reading it now, just kidding.
1272.80s: So this is one...
1274.80s: And then there's one more, let me find...
1281.20s: Here you go.
1288.64s: The reason why I'm showing you these is like,
1291.24s: these are your peers, and they're my peers.
1293.80s: These are other retail traders.
1295.80s: And they're my peers.
1297.80s: They're my peers.
1299.80s: They're my peers.
1302.80s: These are other retail traders that these are people
1313.92s: that think this stuff.
1317.72s: And the reason why you have to know this
1320.44s: is because one of the things we're trying to do is traders
1324.60s: is avoid making the mistakes, common, common mistakes.
1329.12s: So let's talk about these very quickly.
1332.40s: And then we'll get into this one in the back
1334.16s: that I had thrown up.
1336.00s: So this top one says the post for those that are wondering,
1339.92s: the post is literally the Greeks do not provide you an edge.
1344.92s: That's the gist of the post.
1347.52s: And this person says Greeks can be mispriced in quotes
1352.92s: based on market conditions.
1354.60s: For instance, a 20-delted option, 30-DTE,
1356.72s: and it goes in the money in three days.
1358.20s: It was priced at a 20-delted when the trade was open.
1361.40s: And now it's over 50-delted in the money.
1363.60s: The probability is only so accurate.
1365.60s: But in the bigger and more diverse picture,
1367.12s: no one really knows.
1368.12s: This is completely wrong, like entirely wrong through and
1372.60s: through.
1376.00s: And this shows a fundamental misunderstanding
1379.20s: of what the Greeks are.
1381.48s: The Greeks provide us inputs relative to a snapshot
1387.60s: in time.
1389.08s: So when we're looking at these top level Greeks,
1393.52s: the ones that you're going to be most familiar with,
1397.08s: Delta, Theta, I normally like to put gamma up here.
1405.80s: I like gamma better there.
1408.16s: Delta Theta, Gamma, Vega, and Ro.
1410.24s: This is the more common group of Greeks for people.
1414.84s: The way to think about the Greeks is that they essentially
1419.20s: are the instrument cluster to your car.
1422.60s: So when you're driving your car, understanding how to read
1427.52s: your tacometer, understanding how to read your speedometer,
1433.72s: understanding what's oil temp is, what transmission fluid
1440.28s: temp is, or just trans temp, depending on your car,
1443.36s: what your coolant temp is, all of these different things
1448.40s: are inputs to you.
1450.44s: Understanding how to read the gauge cluster of your car
1454.08s: doesn't inherently make you a good driver.
1456.64s: And there are some people that can drive that don't really know
1459.76s: that much about their car.
1460.80s: Now, that's simply an artifact of cars have a lot of controls
1466.12s: in place for you.
1468.84s: An example of this is if there's something wrong with the car,
1471.00s: a check engine light will come on.
1472.84s: That is literally the world creating structure for you
1478.16s: to make it easier for you to know something's wrong.
1482.00s: That doesn't exist in the markets.
1484.64s: You have to be able to look at your coolant and see
1487.64s: that your coolant is effectively boiling.
1490.64s: And then you have to do something to change it.
1492.76s: There's no check engine light that's going to tell you,
1494.96s: maybe the check engine light's like a margin call.
1497.12s: That's when it's way too late.
1499.72s: So the way to think about the Greeks
1502.44s: is they give us a lens to measure
1505.96s: different inputs that impact an option.
1511.08s: Because if you'll recall, when we're talking about options,
1520.12s: there's intrinsic and extrinsic value.
1529.48s: We know that these contracts have an expiration.
1537.56s: We know that these contracts care about volatility.
1544.52s: So what I'm showing you is that looking through just
1549.20s: at a surface level, and you see like there's
1552.72s: these different kinds of values that create the premium,
1558.24s: we know that they expire at some point.
1560.36s: So something that's going to expire in a day
1563.12s: is inherently going to have different value
1564.92s: than something that's going to expire in a year.
1568.72s: So from an intuitive perspective,
1570.68s: we can just postulate that there are other factors
1575.04s: that impact the premium of an option
1578.44s: versus just the underlying price movement.
1583.32s: So the Greeks allow us to understand
1587.92s: how all of these different factors impact premium.
1593.92s: And then as we get into second order Greeks
1596.52s: and third order Greeks, they help us understand
1601.24s: how different factors impact other factors
1607.72s: that ultimately impact your premium.
1611.80s: So the way to think about it, and this isn't
1613.68s: a perfect description by the way, but this is a way
1616.60s: to think about it, a simplifying framework.
1619.12s: First order Greeks pertain to the price or the premium.
1627.12s: Right?
1627.72s: So delta rate of change of premium per one point move
1631.84s: in spot price, theta rate of change of premium.
1635.36s: I guess I'll clarify those in here.
1642.80s: Rate of change of rate of change of premium.
1650.80s: Delta gamma note, we'll talk about that in a second.
1654.80s: Oh, no, I already have premium in there.
1656.64s: I'm an idiot.
1657.80s: Sorry about that.
1659.80s: I realize that it starts with premium.
1661.80s: So notice how delta premium rate of change theta,
1665.80s: premium rate of change, Vega premium rate of change,
1668.80s: row premium rate of change.
1671.08s: All of these first order Greeks deal with premium rates
1674.56s: of change.
1675.80s: Then notice gamma.
1678.28s: What's the difference in gamma?
1680.08s: This is our first second order Greek.
1684.84s: What do you notice?
1686.68s: Gamma is telling us how delta works.
1692.96s: So the second order Greek gamma is measuring
1697.32s: a first order Greek.
1701.32s: You see the point.
1702.80s: So the way to think about first order, second order,
1705.80s: third order Greeks is that they essentially tell you
1709.80s: what they're measuring and they measure different things.
1713.80s: So most traders will deal most commonly
1718.80s: with the first order Greeks plus gamma.
1722.80s: And we'll talk about the others in a little bit.
1725.80s: But we're going to talk about the first order Greeks
1730.64s: that look now going back to this question, back, back to this.
1734.20s: The Greeks are not mispriced, the Greeks are Bayesian.
1741.20s: They provide a snapshot in time and then the update
1747.84s: immediately based on new market movement.
1752.00s: So to this person's point it's not a mispricing at all.
1757.00s: It is simply the different that markets move as the underlying moves, as volatility moves,
1767.00s: as new news enters the system that forces repricing of things.
1773.00s: So it's not mispriced at all.
1776.16s: It's simply a Bayesian system that integrates new information.
1781.16s: So now this was another comment on that post.
1784.32s: And essentially again, a reminder, the post is that the Greeks don't provide you an edge.
1791.28s: And this person says, so yes and no, the no.
1793.68s: I make an absolute dump truckload of money utilizing the Greeks in part of my SPX strategies
1800.24s: and how I swing stock options.
1802.48s: It's not the sole driver to my thesis, but it's a significant part of the evaluation.
1806.00s: So you could tell like this clearly is just a person that wants to debate, right?
1811.84s: They're literally saying no, but then they use the Greeks.
1815.68s: So that that part of side, I don't even care.
1818.64s: People are always quick to do that.
1821.56s: It's actually funny to me.
1823.40s: But the broader point is I want to talk about this individual person and their experience,
1832.20s: because their capacity to make what they consider to be a dump truckload of money, which here's
1838.68s: another bet.
1839.68s: I had happily bet hundreds of thousands of dollars that if we actually conducted a genuine
1846.76s: audit of their returns, this would not be the case.
1850.48s: Just saying.
1851.80s: But that aside and granting the point and taking it as something to think about, right,
1860.56s: a cognitive exercise.
1863.40s: Your ability to make money with or without using the Greeks has nothing to do with the
1870.84s: post, which is that the Greeks do not provide an edge.
1874.48s: The way that I think about the Greeks is that they provide table stakes.
1882.96s: You are a artist of sorts and your medium is options.
1891.28s: So you have to know when to use the chisel.
1895.24s: You have to know when to use the sandpaper.
1897.88s: You have to know when to use the polish, these different tools.
1902.48s: So the Greeks are table stakes.
1906.84s: The Greeks are what you need to understand in order to understand what the fuck is going
1913.16s: on with your positions that are on.
1915.96s: And this is why so very frequently in the simplest of sense, people will say the underlying
1922.76s: move in my favor, but my trade lost money.
1925.96s: Why did this happen?
1927.40s: And it typically happens at a surface level of some sort of change in volatility and
1931.72s: theta decay.
1933.00s: That's generally the case.
1934.88s: But it goes much deeper than that.
1937.80s: So for example, sometimes people don't understand when they're in the markets selling tons
1945.76s: of really far out of the money puts and they think that their position is actually very
1951.72s: safe because it's a low probability move.
1955.36s: However, the position is way less safe than they think it is.
1961.36s: And one of our Greeks help you understand that exact scenario.
1968.52s: So if we're selling super far out of the money options, Vega can really hurt us.
1977.12s: So if volatility starts to spike, Vega can lead to pretty significant expansion of a margin
1988.84s: requirement.
1990.28s: So if I'm selling super far out of the money options that are super cheap and because
1994.80s: they're so far out of the money, they don't make much money.
1998.00s: So then I have to sell a bunch of them.
1999.56s: So then I sell a bunch of them.
2001.52s: And as I'm doing this, I still have a pretty high probability trade.
2007.80s: But if volatility starts to expand, that can hurt, right?
2013.84s: Our Vega in that case would be slightly problematic.
2020.16s: However, if we go down and we look at a second order Greek like Vama, and we can see that
2029.00s: Vega actually has convexity.
2034.92s: So the problem with that is the position that that person selling super far out of the
2039.76s: money puts, for example, thinks is super safe.
2043.44s: And then volatility starts to expand.
2045.80s: And all of a sudden it's looking much worse than they thought, much faster than they thought.
2051.32s: And it's because they have no concept of Vama.
2054.52s: They're literally holding what I call a Vama bomb.
2058.76s: And it's just ticking in their hands and they don't even fucking know it's there.
2063.60s: And it's because they don't know this.
2066.32s: So the Greeks are what you need to know in order to play the game.
2072.20s: Another example I use that might be useful for people is if I'm playing basketball and
2078.76s: I know that if I shoot a free throw, it gives me a point.
2085.36s: So I know the rule.
2087.76s: And in order to be able to shoot a free throw, I need to know the rules, right?
2091.76s: I need to stay behind the line.
2093.76s: Most of the team has to stay behind their lines before they can go for a rebound.
2097.84s: I have to know the rules because if I violate the rules, then I can't make the point.
2102.16s: Because they won't count the shot.
2105.04s: But simply knowing the rules doesn't give me the point.
2110.68s: I still need to make the shot.
2113.68s: That's essentially what the Greeks help us do.
2117.68s: So now let's go back.
2121.00s: Thor is getting really antsy grumbling.
2133.16s: He literally had like this little sad whimper.
2136.80s: I was ignoring him.
2139.68s: So now let's go back and I actually want to hone you in on this one.
2144.20s: Do I really need to understand the Greeks?
2147.20s: And they say I'm making money consistently without technical analysis of the trades.
2155.32s: Convince me it's worth taking the time to learn.
2160.00s: This is the complete backwards way to think of the markets.
2166.84s: This is somebody that is trying to prioritize their convenience and their preference.
2173.72s: They're saying it's going well so far.
2177.44s: I would rather not do this because it's annoying or because it takes time and effort and
2183.12s: I don't want to do it.
2184.56s: So they're saying do I actually have to do this?
2189.16s: The reality is for this person I can definitely tell over the long run that this kind of person.
2197.40s: I don't know how long they've been trading.
2199.00s: I can tell you it's not long and I can also tell you that the probability of them if they
2203.72s: maintain this kind of course of them being around for a long time is very low.
2208.76s: We have to get over the fact that the markets are not based on our convenience.
2213.80s: But we want them to be what we want to be easier difficult.
2217.44s: None of that matters.
2218.44s: It all is what it is.
2221.64s: So this person's question of do I really need to understand the Greeks?
2225.04s: You don't have to understand the Greeks.
2227.36s: You absolutely can trade and you can even find short term success or you can even find
2232.44s: moderately long term success by not knowing the Greeks.
2236.44s: Certainly.
2237.60s: But the thing is is that's finding success in spite of your lack of knowledge.
2244.80s: There's nothing about this that actually helps you.
2250.04s: The only outcome here that's positive is that you make money and you're making money
2255.88s: in spite of your own lack of knowledge.
2260.68s: So it's really important to understand the differentiation because.
2265.44s: Trading is a very long term game as I commonly remind you all.
2271.64s: And over time all of these little weaknesses are going to come out.
2276.88s: You're going to find them all markets do that because you have to do a lot of things
2281.24s: in markets.
2282.60s: So do you need to understand the Greeks?
2285.68s: No, you can absolutely choose not to understand the Greeks.
2289.28s: Is that negatively going to impact your ability to make money?
2292.56s: Absolutely.
2293.56s: Specifically, yes, without the doubt.
2297.84s: So now I'm going to take a pause on some of these misconceptions that we went through.
2306.32s: And the quick overview of what the Greeks are and what they do.
2313.00s: And I want to see if there's any upfront questions you guys have as of right now.
2323.32s: And I'm just updating our timestamps.
2330.12s: Paul says I guess successful trades went to his head.
2332.92s: And the funny thing is is you're exactly right.
2335.72s: Those successful trades go to their head, but in the worst way possible.
2340.84s: The reason why it's the worst way possible is because they don't realize their own problem
2346.60s: and their problem is that they're making money in spite of this, which means they're
2352.36s: stacking the deck against themselves.
2354.80s: And then it won't be that far further down the line when they actually lose money.
2359.40s: And then they're like, oh, I wonder why I'm losing money.
2363.24s: And it'll start to unravel this fundamental misunderstanding of option, which is always
2369.80s: interesting to me.
2371.92s: I never understand that perspective.
2373.92s: It doesn't make sense.
2374.92s: Why would you not want to know the tools for the trade?
2378.20s: Obviously, because it's more work, but this comes down to the people that still are just
2383.68s: overwhelmingly mistaken that this is going to fast easy money.
2387.52s: And as I will always remind you, you ain't going to find that here.
2391.48s: You are not going to find fast easy money in markets.
2394.60s: It's simply not the case.
2400.88s: James says what exactly is convexity?
2404.04s: It's a great question.
2405.44s: So actually, I wonder, give me a sec.
2409.68s: I bet you that there's going to be a cool graphic of it.
2416.04s: I don't like any of these three.
2434.52s: This one's OK.
2436.88s: So a lot of the stuff that you're going to see is from bonds because the convexity of
2442.28s: bonds is a hot topic.
2444.44s: But I just want you to focus on this.
2451.12s: So it's the same thing that you learned in, I actually don't know.
2455.20s: It's like basic math.
2456.20s: I don't know if it's like algebra.
2457.92s: I don't think it's algebra.
2458.92s: I don't know where you learn it.
2460.36s: But it's that concave convex wherever you learn that, right?
2464.92s: So convexity, concavity.
2466.72s: I don't remember where we learn that.
2469.48s: But that's like middle school or probably middle school or something.
2474.08s: So essentially, convexity is when something has this kind of shape.
2479.20s: So it's when we have tails that rise up pretty significantly.
2486.52s: And then we have a flatter midsection of some sort.
2491.76s: Now there can be all sorts of skew with convexity.
2495.16s: It's not going to be an even distribution or anything like this always.
2499.76s: But the main thing to know about convexity is this general shape.
2504.84s: So you can have things that are positively convex like this.
2508.12s: You can have things that are negatively convex or concave like this.
2513.36s: And it gives us a really important read into the behavior of things.
2518.60s: So when you look at options, an example of option convexity is gamma.
2525.00s: So if we look at, well, actually, I think I have it here.
2530.04s: Give me a sec.
2534.04s: Yeah.
2540.60s: So it's not smooth, not smooth, but this is convexity.
2545.64s: So what this is showing you is the steepness of gamma in two different instances.
2551.60s: You can see that Vega has concavity.
2559.60s: So convexity has things become more convex.
2562.44s: They move faster.
2564.60s: So in this case with gamma, we can see that this yellow line is a 10 DTE option.
2573.28s: The white line is a 30 DTE option.
2576.52s: So notice how gamma's convexity increases as it goes up into 30 DTE from 30 DTE to 10
2586.24s: DTE.
2587.72s: So that's what convexity is.
2589.88s: In the theoretical sense, it's literally just this shape that we apply in different contexts.
2597.60s: So you very, very frequently will hear about convexity in the bond market.
2602.08s: Super, super common.
2604.04s: Let me know if you have follow on questions on like what convexity is, but that's essentially
2610.64s: what it is.
2611.64s: Why not says who needs Greeks when you can guess my man?
2615.80s: That's it.
2616.80s: That's it.
2617.80s: It's better off.
2618.80s: Just fucking straight up guessing.
2625.80s: All right.
2631.36s: So let's get a withdrawal here.
2637.68s: So let's talk about how we can use the Greeks.
2648.80s: As always, you will refer, well, you always hear me refer to the way that I plan things,
2661.08s: which is always from the top down like this, like a funnel, right?
2666.84s: So the top level of using the Greeks for me is actually the portfolio level, the way
2673.16s: that we can use the composite Greek position or Greek standing of our portfolio is very
2682.24s: useful.
2683.24s: This goes back to that example I was telling you before.
2684.96s: If I'm selling a ton of super far out of the money options, even though they're very
2690.48s: high probability to work in my favor, and I'm selling a whole bunch of them because they're
2694.48s: cheap and I have to and I'm using more and more of my margin requirement, I will see that
2700.44s: represented in the Vega.
2702.92s: And I can also calculate that with respect to something like we talked about earlier,
2707.68s: Vama.
2708.88s: So we can use the Greeks to help us manage the overall portfolio.
2714.64s: You can use things like a beta weighted delta.
2720.20s: You can use portfolio level theta, portfolio level gamma, Vega, all of these different
2729.84s: Greeks can be zoomed out to the composite level.
2734.08s: And it helps us understand the lean of our entire portfolio.
2739.28s: If I have a bunch of trades on that are all short premium, I'm going to have a really
2746.12s: healthy looking positive theta metric.
2749.80s: But I am really going to be at the mercy of gamma across the board.
2756.60s: So then if I notice that I have really high positive theta higher than I typically would
2762.64s: expect it to be, and then I notice that my gamma risk is significantly elevated, that
2769.88s: might inform me to go into my portfolio of individual trades and find things that might
2780.28s: be really, really highly correlated in taking some of them down to reduce this correlation
2787.24s: so that I can take down the overall portfolio level gamma and scrub off some of my overall
2794.28s: beta weighted delta.
2796.68s: So I might take some of these positions down like this.
2803.20s: So that's the portfolio level.
2805.52s: Did not mean to get rid of everything.
2808.80s: Too bad.
2815.08s: The second is from an analysis perspective.
2823.08s: And again, you can tell that this session we're not doing the basics of Greeks.
2828.40s: The two videos that I shared are going to do all that for you.
2832.52s: So I'm spending more time talking about this stuff.
2835.68s: And there's actually a really good example of this that I came across recently.
2840.20s: So if we take a look at, let me, this.
2849.08s: So if we take a look at the actual effect of the various Greeks, and in terms of like
2855.28s: how to actually conceptualize their behavior in our brain, we can figure out where we
2862.48s: see heightened or lower delta, I enter lower gamma theta, Vega, all of these.
2868.64s: All of them are different inputs that we can custom tailor to our exact idea.
2875.48s: This is one of the most important points of the video that I want you to key into.
2881.56s: One of the true benefits of options is you can gain purposeful exposure to the precise
2888.56s: effects that you want.
2890.92s: And you can minimize your exposure to other effects that you don't want is involved in
2897.32s: your position.
2899.52s: So the Greeks allow us to do this.
2904.88s: So let's take a look at something like, what was I looking at last night?
2910.04s: There is a ion cue.
2917.40s: If I go to ion cue, and then if I go to something that's like 700 days out, what do you notice
2925.08s: about the deltas for ion cue that are 700 days out?
2935.28s: The deltas are this column right here.
2941.52s: So this at the money, the deltas are 0.76 at the 40.
2952.60s: 0.74 for the next strike.
2955.20s: That's out of the money.
2956.80s: The following strike is 0.70.
2959.04s: The following strike after that is 0.67.
2963.24s: So what you might notice that's different than what you typically see is that the deltas
2969.04s: are very, very high for options that are out of the money.
2973.08s: We typically see if we come closer in time, we typically see like a 50 delta that's
2980.12s: right about the money.
2982.68s: So what can we take from that?
2986.28s: There are important context clues that the market tells you if you know how to understand
2992.76s: them.
2993.96s: Now what the market is telling you in this specific instance is this stock is not only
3000.84s: expected to go up, but I also can tell you that this stock has significantly elevated
3009.20s: volatility.
3012.08s: That's what this tells me.
3015.48s: So the Greeks give us a lot of these small little tiny clues that we can piece together.
3025.48s: Another example are things like Gax, gamma exposure.
3034.92s: So let's say we go into spy and let's take a look at the gamma exposure.
3045.56s: We can look at gamma exposure in a bunch of different contexts.
3050.60s: But this is looking at a specific expiration.
3053.72s: You can either do a composite so that you can see pretty much everything at once if you
3058.72s: are so inclined.
3060.04s: It's really up to what you're wanting to analyze.
3065.60s: But we can use things like Gax to understand what dealer behavior might look like.
3074.60s: We can figure out if Gax is higher on the collar, the put side, which nets out to a total
3081.64s: Gax.
3083.12s: We can look at things like volatility skew and use that to help us understand different
3091.68s: pricing disparities and discrepancies between calls and puts are between different cycles.
3096.52s: This can tell me in this instance that put call parity might be off.
3100.76s: There's an arbitrage opportunity there.
3103.92s: So the Greeks give you literally all of this and it starts from understanding what they
3112.08s: are.
3113.08s: Now, this series of stuff that I'm explaining really tie to a slightly higher level use
3120.16s: of the Greeks that takes time.
3122.08s: It genuinely does take time to piece together all of these things.
3126.24s: So what I want to do is spend a little time talking about how you can use the Greeks
3131.84s: in a day to day context, at least getting started with using them.
3137.60s: So I need somebody to give me a strategy like it could be any sort of basic strategy.
3142.64s: And then I will talk to you literally how you can use the Greeks in the context of that
3148.16s: strategy.
3156.12s: Any ideas?
3157.12s: The straddle?
3158.12s: Cool.
3160.12s: Paula, do you want shorter along?
3164.76s: We'll do a straddle.
3171.44s: Short straddle got it.
3173.88s: So let's say that we're going to pick a short straddle and I'm going to just turn it into
3180.92s: a rough strategy off the top of my head so that we have something to work off of.
3186.80s: So this now goes into the third level, which is position, which is exactly what we're
3195.20s: going to talk about now.
3196.32s: So I'll clear those off and we're going to have a short straddle.
3204.88s: Let's say I'm going to trade this for variance risk premiums.
3209.72s: So I'm going to look for stocks that have higher IV relative to HV.
3216.88s: And let's just say that's the starting point.
3221.32s: Now for those that are familiar with the outlier strategy process, you know that step
3226.92s: four is to build a strategy.
3232.84s: One of the inputs for building a strategy is when we get more specific.
3237.88s: This is where we pick things like our deltas, our days to expiration and so on.
3246.04s: So the good part is with a straddle.
3248.20s: It's still you, but case you don't know, you still have to pick your deltas.
3251.80s: You don't have to have a centered straddle.
3253.48s: You can have straddles that are off center, but most people will default to an at the
3257.68s: money straddle.
3259.28s: And that really generally holds true in this case.
3263.28s: So the first Greek I'm looking at for this specific strategy, which is based on trading
3267.76s: risk premiums, is the delta input.
3271.28s: And the delta input in this context is I'm really trying to trade primarily the volatility
3277.72s: side of things.
3278.72s: So I'm not really looking to take a big directional bet.
3281.60s: So I'm actually going to start with something that's probably close to at the money.
3288.32s: Now what happens?
3290.60s: If this strategy, fair and so is premium, which is entirely based around the difference
3297.88s: between implied volatility and historic volatility, what happens if the underlying moves?
3302.68s: Who could tell me?
3306.28s: In terms of the position.
3312.56s: As the underlying starts to move, there's going to be a couple key changes in the position.
3317.64s: And these key changes matter to me, actually quite a lot.
3320.40s: And I want to see if you know why.
3330.20s: There you go.
3331.20s: Tommy's on it.
3332.20s: The delta's of the leg move.
3334.64s: So as the stock goes up and down, the delta's will move.
3340.00s: And the movement of the delta's, which we know what's going to measure that.
3344.72s: Emma.
3346.88s: So that's another thing I know I have to take a look at with this strategy.
3351.76s: And believe it or not, we know that there's a relationship between gamma and days to expiration.
3359.16s: So this also will inform this decision.
3363.52s: So let's think about it.
3365.80s: Because we as retail traders, we don't have the luxury of essentially continually being
3371.28s: able to hedge.
3373.00s: It's expensive for us to hedge.
3375.16s: And at the onset of this, we know that we want our delta risk to be about zero ideal world.
3386.88s: We don't want any delta risk.
3388.20s: We want no directional risk.
3391.20s: Because this idea is based on volatility in ply versus historic.
3396.48s: So that means that I'm really trying to center on Vega.
3401.20s: I want Vega to be a much larger part of my actual PNL.
3408.56s: So what do we know about Vega?
3411.84s: We know based on the way that the Greeks behave and based on those other videos that I
3420.64s: paired with you.
3422.04s: But we know that Vega is DTE sensitive.
3427.04s: And we know that Vega is higher as there's more extrinsic value.
3431.68s: Where's more extrinsic value the further out in time you go.
3435.72s: So if I'm trying to isolate my impact to Vega, do I want to trade super short term?
3441.80s: Maybe it's not a no, but these are inputs to the decision cycle.
3447.08s: So then let's say, well, maybe I do want to trade this shorter term.
3450.56s: I think it might be better for X, Y and Z reason.
3453.36s: I'm going to go into SPX.
3457.00s: And let's just do like a 4 DTE obviously because the market's closed.
3462.44s: And let's take a look at this at the money straddle the 61 15.
3467.48s: And we can see that we're getting 53 delta on the call side.
3472.08s: So let's take a look at this actual position.
3477.44s: So I'm going to have I'm going to sell to open.
3482.24s: One call.
3483.88s: And then one put.
3485.52s: And let's take a look at the Greek profile for this actually.
3491.00s: It's probably easier to see.
3496.40s: If I put it in a workbook.
3511.64s: So let's take a look at these different positions.
3517.04s: We're going to have delta, gamma, data, Vega.
3522.64s: I'm not going to worry about row row.
3525.00s: We're always kind of like the bastard child that most people don't care about most of
3528.60s: the time.
3529.60s: That's kind of the reality.
3530.60s: Row really impacts longer term options a lot more.
3533.44s: And let's take a first look at the short call.
3537.60s: So we said that we're going to be short.
3540.12s: I'm going to move this off to the side.
3541.40s: Now I just wanted you to see what I was in putting.
3543.04s: I'll bring it back over.
3544.52s: But I want to move it off to the side of that we can look through this little faster.
3549.48s: So the short 61 15 call.
3553.80s: What's going to happen there?
3554.80s: What we're going to get negative 53 delta's.
3558.28s: Our gamma is going to be negative 0.01.
3565.84s: Our theta is going to be positive to 21.
3570.84s: Our Vega is going to be negative 248.
3576.24s: And then if we're short, the 61 15 puts our delta, we're going to get long 47 delta's.
3588.24s: For gamma, we're going to be short 0.01.
3597.16s: For theta, we're going to get $1.79.
3604.68s: And for Vega, we're going to be short 248.
3616.48s: So let's take a look at this position so far.
3622.16s: I can't find out if I net these out.
3630.32s: Here's what I can expect to see on a daily basis.
3634.08s: I can expect to make about four bucks in theta.
3636.96s: I have about negative five Vega.
3641.36s: I'm negative 0.02 gamma and negative 0.06 delta.
3645.12s: So you notice right from the onset, I'm not even delta neutral.
3649.48s: So the entire origin of this position, if you'll remember, is I don't want any directional
3654.52s: risk.
3655.64s: I want to be able to just trade Vega.
3658.20s: I care about the volatility side of this equation.
3660.28s: I don't give a crap.
3661.28s: I don't have an opinion on the direction side of things.
3665.52s: So now I have some choices.
3668.96s: I understand the Greeks.
3672.64s: I can figure out this is going to be a theoretical exercise.
3676.80s: In reality, we use what's called delta bands.
3681.72s: And that means that we don't hedge the delta as it moves every single time.
3687.40s: It's just unrealistic.
3690.12s: So the way we use delta bands is we say if delta gets to this point or this point, I will
3697.36s: recenter the delta's.
3699.28s: That's a suboptimal approach, but it's a realistic approach.
3703.12s: And it's because there's a cost associated with the hedge.
3708.76s: So important general context.
3712.20s: So that's the facade from a theoretical perspective.
3716.44s: Let's say that we want to keep our delta's zero.
3718.44s: We want to be flat.
3719.44s: Okay.
3720.44s: So what do we have to do?
3721.44s: We got to buy six shares.
3722.44s: That's easy.
3723.44s: So then we're going to buy to open six shares.
3727.36s: That's going to give us six delta's.
3729.96s: I should do.
3732.36s: I'm going to keep it the same.
3737.20s: So it's essentially going to flatten out these delta's.
3739.56s: I don't want to confuse you.
3741.20s: I'm just going to multiply all these by 100.
3754.40s: So then if I grab six shares, my new net position in terms of delta is flat.
3762.32s: Great.
3763.32s: Mission accomplished.
3766.32s: There is a problem.
3768.72s: Locking gamma.
3771.32s: As soon as this moves, my delta's are going to move.
3782.08s: So my transacting in the shares does precisely jack shit for the gamma.
3792.56s: So how do I clear off this gamma?
3810.20s: I got to use options.
3814.12s: That's the way that I can actually get rid of some of this gamma.
3821.72s: So one of the ways that I can get rid of gamma is I can find something and I can trade
3830.00s: an unrelated option that essentially offset some of this.
3835.92s: What is soon as I do that, all of these other things are going to change.
3840.56s: So the way that we actually maintain delta neutrality for something like a short straddle,
3846.80s: if we're actually trying to trade a specific effect like variance risk premium is I use the
3854.74s: Greeks to understand the overall position that I have.
3859.20s: And then I can make adjustments.
3860.48s: So the way that I would do this is actually not by buying shares upfront to flatten the
3864.80s: deltas.
3866.08s: This is kind of like putting a bandaid over a gaping wound.
3870.72s: It doesn't actually fix the problem.
3872.68s: The problem is going to come from my gamma.
3875.76s: So I can flatten the gamma by buying options that offset this.
3883.00s: Then I can delta hedge the remaining deltas off based on whatever that residual is.
3890.16s: Now that becomes more complex because if I'm trying to sell straddles, I'm essentially
3895.56s: saying I think there's variance risk premium, but then I'm coming in here and I'm buying
3898.82s: options to offset the gamma.
3900.64s: So it's a choice.
3901.64s: It's a business decision.
3902.88s: Do you want to truly isolate gamma?
3904.44s: How long is your position going to be open?
3906.08s: How impactful is the gamma going to be?
3909.24s: You can decide how you want to deal with gamma or you can just set more aggressive delta
3914.08s: bands entirely up to you.
3917.80s: For me, a lot of times, I will try to find positions that are easier to manage for something
3924.72s: like this, but going back to the original point of how to use the Greeks in something
3932.32s: like a straddle is we define as always the profit mechanism that we're trying to trade
3937.60s: in this case.
3938.60s: I use variance risk premiums for the example.
3941.04s: And then I started listing out the specific effects that I'm trying to isolate.
3947.40s: And based on those effects, I can literally quantify the impacts of these different positions,
3962.04s: net them out, and then attain the actual risk that I want.
3969.36s: Let's do unomas.
3971.40s: And then we'll have plenty of time for like Q&A and stuff.
3975.20s: But I want to pick another example.
3978.24s: I'm thinking something like buying calls or selling puts something like that, but you
3985.68s: guys can pick if we want to do either of those.
3993.36s: That's what I'm thinking.
3994.68s: And really the main reason why I want to do that is because I think there's a little
4000.96s: bit we can probably pull out of it.
4005.00s: Some calls good.
4006.00s: I love it.
4008.52s: And you read my mind, by the way, Tommy, thank you very much for giving me the scenario
4017.08s: of trying to play a big move because that's going to be one of the first questions.
4021.68s: But before we do that, I need to finish my dinner order really fast.
4026.96s: And for Valentine's Day, my wife oddly wants to jack in the box, which I have to be honest
4034.24s: we essentially never eat that shit.
4037.20s: But I'm a romantic at heart.
4043.16s: So jack in the box we go.
4048.08s: And I'm not like afraid of jack in the box.
4053.32s: I just think this stuff is fucking awful for you.
4057.96s: It's like just straight disease food.
4067.28s: But every once in a while, I feel like you got to put some trash in your body to remind
4071.84s: it to not be you delicate.
4079.08s: Here we go.
4081.08s: Okay.
4082.08s: So this was in a straddle.
4091.64s: And then now we are at 108.5.
4097.88s: And then this will be how to use the Greeks in a long call.
4104.20s: Okay.
4106.96s: So along this is another just really, really common scenario.
4113.76s: And I actually have a video that goes through this in detail.
4119.04s: Let me find it for you.
4126.92s: Here.
4136.84s: So this video will talk about buying call options.
4145.04s: And let's take a look at a practical example.
4149.44s: So in Tommy's scenario, he was talking about wanting to trade something for a much more
4162.40s: pronounced directional move.
4165.72s: So let's say that we're looking at Ion Cueks.
4168.52s: I was looking at this earlier.
4170.28s: Actually, I think another probably better example like Nvidia.
4176.24s: So a lot of people have been trying to figure out how to play this move in Nvidia.
4178.92s: I think this is fairly topical.
4180.48s: Now one of the notes that has earnings coming up, that's important to know because with
4184.80s: earnings coming up, you have to either acknowledge that you're going to hold through earnings
4189.36s: or not hold through earnings.
4190.72s: And it's entirely your choice.
4192.28s: But this is a binary move.
4195.08s: Now when we're trading long options, there are effectively for specifically long calls,
4202.60s: there are two things that we are trying to gain exposure to.
4207.12s: The primary top line item though is gamma.
4212.64s: We are trying to find something that is likely to move and it's likely to move a lot.
4220.88s: But that really comes down to leverage.
4225.48s: That's the only reason why you trade something like a long call versus buying the stock.
4235.08s: It's just for leverage.
4237.24s: So if we take a look at buying 100 shares of Nvidia, but I wanted to buy 100 shares of
4242.28s: Nvidia, I need to call up 13,885 bucks, which I may or may not want to call up, right?
4253.16s: The other thing I can do is go super far out in time and I can buy an option that's super
4260.48s: deep in the money, like an 80 delta.
4264.04s: And I can essentially control 80 shares of Nvidia at this point, 80 shares of Nvidia, and
4271.80s: I can pay 45, 100 bucks, call it.
4277.36s: So for a fraction of the price, I can essentially control the same size position.
4281.84s: This is an example of using options essentially as a stock replacement.
4287.56s: Now, the way that we can structure our options trade based on our idea changes and we use
4295.44s: the Greeks to do it.
4297.36s: So let's say that we think there's going to be a big up move in Nvidia, big parabolic
4302.32s: up move for whatever reason.
4303.88s: Maybe we see the CEO sign another titty or who knows, he might pull another chip out of
4309.92s: another oven that people really like.
4314.20s: And that's the limit here.
4315.96s: So let's say that scenario happens, we think it's going to happen, there's going to be a big
4321.20s: move.
4322.84s: There are a handful of choices that we have to move through in order to arrive at the
4329.80s: actual position that we're going to put on.
4332.08s: So one of those choices is days to expiration.
4336.24s: Another one of those choices is delta.
4338.44s: Another one of those choices is gamma.
4340.16s: Another one of those choices is theta.
4342.72s: So let's see how we can actually build a position that truly reflects our idea.
4349.48s: If we think Nvidia is going to move a lot, let's take a look at a couple examples.
4354.64s: Let's do a seven day and we'll do something that's like at the money.
4360.64s: So this option has 50 delta and it's only $290, right?
4367.40s: So it's pretty cheap.
4369.48s: Before I was telling you that you have to cough up like $4,500 to control 80 shares.
4374.36s: This is putting up $290 to control 50 shares.
4377.36s: You just do two of them, pay $500, $600 and control even more shares.
4383.04s: So from that perspective, it seems way better, right?
4386.12s: Doesn't it?
4386.92s: Does to me?
4388.16s: Here's the problem.
4389.76s: If you take a look at the theta, theta on these options is losing 24 cents a day.
4396.84s: So if we look at that in relation to the overall premium, call it $290, losing 24 cents,
4406.88s: it's essentially 10% of the options premium is going to go away per day.
4413.04s: The reason why that matters is because it then moves the goal post against you to get
4419.40s: the move in your favor.
4420.40s: And I'll show you what I mean by this.
4422.68s: So let's say we get in at that $290 handle, again, just for the example.
4427.76s: And let's zoom this out.
4429.80s: So let's pretend that a day passes.
4435.20s: Right now our P&L is negative $2.50.
4437.72s: It's just using the midpoint.
4439.16s: So don't pay any mind to that.
4441.68s: Let me get rid of one of these extra slices and probably this one.
4446.72s: So it's about unchanged, right?
4449.40s: On the day.
4450.40s: Great.
4451.40s: One day.
4454.40s: What starts to happen here?
4456.76s: Well, what will start to happen is you'll notice that this purple line is actually going
4461.52s: to move down towards that blue line.
4464.40s: So if I fast forward another day, another day, all of a sudden the stock hasn't moved against
4470.56s: me.
4471.56s: It hasn't moved for me, but I'm starting to lose money.
4475.52s: That sucks.
4476.52s: Why am I losing money?
4477.52s: Well, I'm losing money because of theta decay.
4480.52s: So one of the inputs to your decision cycle here, understanding the Greeks, is that the
4485.60s: cost for the leverage you get through a long call is theta decay.
4491.60s: The downside to this is let's say that you were expecting originally, maybe Nvidia, what's
4501.56s: the current price?
4503.12s: Nvidia is at 138.
4505.20s: So let's say that you were expecting it to go to 140, 142, something like that.
4515.12s: The issue here is if I continue to fast forward time, what ends up happening is I need a bigger
4522.20s: and bigger move in order for this thing to get even back to break even, let alone to make
4528.96s: money.
4530.88s: That's the issue that you face.
4533.28s: So that's the downside to using the cheaper at the money options that expire soon.
4540.52s: And again, this is using a smaller position.
4542.44s: Really we would have a too lot on right now to simulate the same size.
4546.56s: And if it doesn't move quickly enough in your favor, you bleed out through theta decay.
4551.80s: Okay, cool.
4554.08s: What's the other benefit of this?
4555.88s: Well, I just showed you that I can buy more of them.
4559.32s: And we also know that the effect of gamma is the closer we get to expiration, gamma is
4564.92s: going to go up.
4566.56s: So I also get the effect of my delta rapidly compounding, which is awesome.
4574.96s: What's the charge for that?
4576.88s: The charge for that is theta decay is literally the highest at this point.
4585.04s: So then if we use the other example of going further out in time, what happens?
4591.40s: Well, if I use this 80 delta option, let's take a look at what my gamma is, how fast
4597.64s: I'm going to compound.
4600.00s: Fucking zero.
4601.00s: It's not actually zero.
4602.00s: It's just further decimal points in.
4603.64s: This is only going to two decimal points.
4605.36s: So it's like three, four decimal points in the broader point here is that you're actually
4612.32s: not going to compound that much.
4614.84s: So far out in time that your gamma is about flat.
4618.00s: That kind of sucks.
4619.60s: Why would I want that?
4621.20s: Well, because if we take a look at our theta decay, our theta decay is just four cents.
4627.44s: So if we look at that four cents relative to the total premium that we're buying into,
4632.16s: it's very, very small.
4635.00s: So what's the trade off here?
4636.92s: The trade off by going further out in time is I'm buying something that's way more expensive.
4642.40s: I can lose more money in total, but it's a little bit of a down payment style situation.
4649.12s: Because as long as this thing doesn't move super far against me and I'm directionally
4652.32s: wrong entirely on a per day basis, I'm going to pay less theta even as a gross dollar
4659.08s: amount, but definitely as a percentage, I'm going to give up the gamma.
4664.08s: I'm not going to have anywhere near as much gamma unless I get a really big move in my
4667.88s: favor.
4669.48s: So this is how we can use the Greeks in something like a long call to decide what position
4676.48s: makes the most sense for our idea.
4680.32s: So going back to Nvidia, if our idea is Jensen's about to sign another titty and Nvidia's
4687.52s: going to go skyrocket, I can make more money by not going as far out in time, by being
4693.64s: closer in time and buying more of the options and allowing them to compound.
4698.88s: If I don't know that that's going to happen, and my idea is more so that Nvidia got beaten
4704.32s: down because of deep sea coming out and then the market having this crazy, giant reaction,
4709.88s: but Nvidia is still exceedingly well positioned to take advantage of this long term, and this
4715.20s: is likely short term sentiment.
4717.64s: So I think it's going to rally back up at some point.
4720.32s: Let's pretend that that was back in this time frame somewhere down here.
4724.20s: Then I go further out in time.
4726.08s: I accept the fact that it's going to be slightly more expensive, but I have a position that
4731.52s: can be maintained for longer durations.
4735.84s: So these are some literally basic examples of how we can use the Greeks to inform our
4742.70s: decision making.
4744.28s: And I'll give you one more example that's fairly recent for me, which is Palantir, I put
4752.12s: this trade on.
4754.00s: And in Palantir, it's a ratio called diagonal.
4757.68s: So this is something that's designed to be a longer term trade.
4761.04s: So the way that I built this trade is I went further out in time.
4765.80s: I'll tell you where I went.
4768.60s: I went out to the 16 Jan 26 and I had bought the 110s.
4777.20s: So they were essentially right at the money.
4779.48s: My first Gotham, they were 64 Delta.
4781.40s: Now there are 69 Delta.
4785.28s: So I've gotten 0.05 Delta's added to it in the price movement since I've been in it.
4791.88s: So what have I done here?
4794.76s: I've found a very delicate balance for the idea that I'm trying to trade.
4799.92s: I wanted something that I can hold on to for maybe three, six months.
4805.12s: So I go this far out in time so that I accept much lighter overall Theta decay.
4811.20s: But because I know that they're stated to K, what I can do is I can sell near term options
4816.48s: against it, not to make a bunch of money off the short options, but because I understand
4822.28s: the Greeks.
4823.56s: So I'm losing Theta in that long option position.
4827.52s: So if I come in here and I sell premium, I'm now long Theta.
4832.52s: And in this case, I can see how much Theta I'm gaining per day, 10 cents per day, just
4837.92s: using this option as an example of the 140s.
4841.28s: So I make 10 cents per day in Theta on this trade.
4844.52s: But then if I go out to this trade here and I analyze how much I'm losing per day, I'm
4849.76s: losing five cents.
4851.76s: Sick.
4853.48s: So I can offset the daily Theta decay via the shorter term position to subsidize the holding
4859.36s: cost of the long option so that I can still enjoy the benefit of a leveraged directional
4866.64s: position, but I can reduce the total cost I'm paying to do this.
4871.76s: So this is another way to use the Greeks.
4875.88s: I am going to pause here, open the door for Thor so we can go get his dinner.
4879.76s: And then I would love to talk about any specific questions you guys have.
4884.52s: And then I want to talk about these two misconceptions.
4887.80s: We already covered the first one, but then we'll hit the second one.
4905.76s: So the context here, mexi says so a calendar spread.
4909.44s: What about a calendar spread?
4915.04s: Talk to me.
4916.52s: Talk to me, send your mexi.
4921.28s: Talk to me about this calendar spread.
4925.12s: Oh, he's asking about the position that I had on.
4932.88s: Wait, is that right?
4935.28s: Yes, you're asking about the position that I had on.
4942.28s: No, I mean technically, technically it is a spread.
4950.68s: It's not wrong.
4951.88s: Most people will take the term spread and they'll automatically apply it to verticals, right?
4961.56s: So the point of verticals is obviously very different.
4965.68s: But for example, to mexi's, I'm not exactly sure what mexi, if you were referring to the
4972.24s: position, but technically you could call it horizontal.
4975.96s: It's not, I wouldn't exactly call it a calendar spread.
4979.20s: So horizontal spread calendar spread, it's about the same thing.
4982.00s: The way to think about spreads is you can go vertical or horizontal.
4985.64s: vertical is in the same term, but higher or lower from whatever the base leg is.
4992.64s: And then horizontal is using the time series component going out and time or in and time.
4998.24s: Now technically speaking, if I were to look at a true calendar spread, it would be the
5004.68s: same option that I'm looking at.
5007.00s: And a calendar spread is designed to do a specific thing.
5009.80s: This technically speaking is called a is a diagonal spread.
5015.08s: The reason why it's called a diagonal spread is because I'm combining two things.
5020.52s: I'm combining a change in strike going vertical.
5025.20s: And then I'm also going horizontal.
5027.72s: So what happens if I combined vertical and horizontal, fucking diagonal?
5032.80s: It's one of the easy things about options, no mink nature.
5037.04s: Basically, the very little soak it up because there's very few instances of anything in
5043.04s: this stuff that make any fucking sense whatsoever, but that is one of them.
5047.28s: So technically it's called a diagonal spread.
5049.68s: Now the more important element is the different directions we can go, but then also the relationship
5060.44s: between the legs and the ratio of legs.
5064.52s: This is the stuff that I will trade will be a ratio in some capacity.
5069.28s: So back to this, this idea that there is a best Greek, what is the Greek I should get,
5077.04s: what Greeks should I use?
5080.40s: The reality is there is no best Greek.
5084.52s: What you should do is use the Greeks, guide the position that you want.
5092.84s: The inform via all of the different inputs, how your position is going to behave.
5099.48s: And then you run that through the filter of is this what I want?
5104.36s: Another really simple example going back to the straddles.
5109.56s: Let's say that I was trading the straddles from the context of an earnings release.
5117.36s: And we'll literally let's fucking do an example.
5121.56s: Let's go to last after the market.
5128.40s: I'm going to find something that's like reasonable.
5134.96s: Now let's do Mondalees.
5139.76s: Let's go back to the fourth of Feb.
5142.64s: We're going to go back in time.
5143.64s: And I'm literally going to give you two different traits so that you can see exactly what this
5146.96s: is.
5151.96s: I learn best personally through seeing shit, practical application.
5158.40s: So we're going to take a look at what did I say Mondalees?
5169.64s: Right now it's loading.
5173.44s: Damn boy.
5177.08s: Look at that.
5181.20s: Let's say that we want to trade this for earnings.
5183.88s: So I think in this scenario earnings is after the close on this day.
5189.40s: So technically speaking for an actual earnings play, I would get in much later.
5194.92s: We'll just do that really quick so that it's at least somewhat accurate.
5200.20s: And then I want to take a look at two different things.
5203.80s: I want to take a look at selling the straddle in 7 Feb and then selling the straddle on 21
5208.84s: March.
5209.84s: I actually don't fully remember what happened with this one if it worked or didn't work.
5213.80s: But that doesn't actually matter.
5217.04s: All right, where's the best choice looks like this one?
5223.04s: So we'll throw this in there.
5224.40s: It's going to look all fucked up because the days are fucked up in here.
5226.96s: Don't pay attention to the risk profile.
5230.32s: And then let's take a look at this one.
5233.36s: Okay.
5237.64s: We have our two straddles.
5238.76s: They're locked in 232 and 420.
5241.44s: Diginy.
5242.44s: Let's fast forward time.
5244.24s: So we're literally just going to take it one day forward because the hypothesis that I'm
5249.28s: trying to trade is various risk premiums.
5253.48s: So I'm trying to trade various risk premiums through earnings.
5257.48s: I'm not trying to trade the straddle in this long term.
5261.28s: I'm simply taking it through earnings.
5263.88s: The other thing I'm doing is I'm taking it closer to the morning so that we can observe
5270.12s: what this looks like.
5275.00s: So first things first, our first straddle that we put on for 420 is now trading at $3.75.
5287.32s: So when from 420 to 375, this is the 44-day to expiration straddle.
5292.68s: If I go to the 7th, we put this straddle on for wrong one for 232.
5303.84s: This one is now trading at $1.25.
5307.84s: Actually $5.5.
5308.92s: Sorry.
5310.92s: Somewhere in here.
5311.92s: Let's call it $0.80, $0.90.
5313.92s: Call it $0.90, something like that.
5316.80s: So what happened here?
5319.28s: The Greeks happened here because I'm trying to trade the earnings release itself.
5327.72s: Valtility is going to be centered in the term that has the actual earnings release.
5337.92s: That's what's happening here.
5340.04s: So this moved way more, not because it has higher theta decay.
5344.12s: That's part of it, but that's not why it moved so much more.
5348.48s: Because we can literally do the math on the theta that should have came out.
5352.20s: It should have been like $0.10, $0.14 on this side and $0.9 on this side.
5358.40s: But over $1 came out.
5360.12s: It's not theta.
5361.72s: What happened was a contraction in volatility.
5366.88s: And because that volatility was primarily in this term versus this term, that's why it
5374.68s: made so much more money.
5376.84s: So in this context, based on my thesis and my trade idea, I know it makes more sense
5385.04s: to trade this expiration cycle versus this expiration cycle.
5389.80s: It's because this one actually grants me exposure to the effect I'm trying to capitalize
5394.80s: on.
5395.80s: This one does not.
5397.32s: This one still made money, but it made way less money.
5401.12s: And it's for those reasons.
5404.04s: The Greeks literally tell you all of this, all of it.
5409.36s: You just have to pay attention.
5411.36s: They're there.
5415.40s: Any other questions?
5417.08s: I hope that the general concepts that we're talking about and the approach that we're
5421.64s: talking about makes sense to you.
5424.36s: This is something that's built over time.
5426.56s: So don't let it overwhelm you.
5428.08s: You don't have to know all of this at once.
5429.76s: One of my most important piece of advice to you is that you don't have to remember all
5434.76s: this shit.
5435.84s: What I used to do is I had a cheat sheet that I would reference that would help me understand
5442.36s: how the premium of my option would behave based on all of these different conditions.
5447.76s: That's exactly what I would use.
5449.96s: So you can make your own cheat sheet.
5452.92s: And I think it's important to make your own cheat sheet because the process of making
5457.60s: it is part of the learning process.
5460.20s: So it's valuable to do so.
5463.24s: But if you go through those steps, you literally will make much better trade decisions that
5474.68s: help you isolate what you're actually trying to trade.
5479.48s: That's the broad idea.
5481.28s: So that is a practical application of using the Greeks as an options trader.
5491.40s: So if we take a look at what we have next for our series, next on our hit list is navigating
5502.68s: the options chain.
5504.60s: So the next video that we're going to do, we're going to talk about how to look through
5509.20s: and identify opportunities, how to analyze things like liquidity, how to see if the options
5518.48s: chain is telling you anything because very frequently it does simply if you pay the
5524.12s: pocket tension.
5525.84s: And then after that, we will have technical analysis, fundamental analysis, how to build
5532.60s: a trade strategy process portfolio management, and then the actual trading process itself.
5538.32s: And then we still have a handful of flex sessions.
5541.72s: So this is still designed to be about 15 episodes.
5545.00s: We are now obviously wrapping up episode six.
5549.48s: And my intention is to fill these flex sessions with really whatever you want.
5557.76s: So one of my ideas, the reason I'm talking to you about this is to get your input is
5563.80s: I definitely think it makes sense to slot in a general Q and A. I don't know where
5569.80s: you prefer to do that.
5571.52s: I think it actually would make sense before the options chain or before building a trade
5580.48s: itself.
5581.48s: I think those are the two logical places for the like general overarching Q and A. And then
5591.44s: I was planning on doing a second one at the very end.
5594.64s: So then if there's a specific options trading topic that you really want to spend more
5599.68s: time drilling in as we go through these, that's what the remaining flex session will be
5604.04s: used for.
5605.28s: But if you have a preference on when the Q and A is, let me know the reason why I'm asking
5609.72s: if you have a preference is because it really depends on if you feel like you're at a point
5613.40s: that you have questions that are like burning in your brain that you're trying to get an
5618.44s: answer for that you're not able to find on your own.
5621.56s: But that happens when you get to a critical mass of kind of knowing enough to then have
5626.16s: questions, right?
5627.44s: If you're so new, then you kind of don't know what you don't know.
5630.56s: And then it might make sense to hold off for a little bit.
5633.76s: So if you have a preference, let me know.
5637.88s: Reese says before building a trade, cool.
5640.28s: I will earmark that and then everybody else, you can just let me know as we work through
5646.44s: the rest of the content.
5650.20s: As always, if you need anything, let me know.
5655.28s: Be an outlier.
5656.28s: I'll see you all later.
