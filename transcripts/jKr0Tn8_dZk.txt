456.00s:  you
458.00s:  Let me know if you guys can hear me.
464.60s:  It looks like it's back now.
466.40s:  I don't know why it dropped, but I got a thing from Discord.
470.40s:  Okay, cool.
470.90s:  Thanks, guys.
471.90s:  So the 23rd, pretty quiet, jobless claims.
476.00s:  24th will be the bigger one, specifically with PMI and then also the consumer sentiment.
480.60s:  I am excited to see that and super quiet week from event perspective.
486.70s:  Now we do have earnings underway right now and earnings look to be pretty well priced.
496.00s:  I'm watching the futures and my mind is getting blown.
498.40s:  Let me pull you guys over here because this is now up.
503.90s:  This is crazy.
504.70s:  So to see this level of movement in futures right now, I think this is a big case of the
512.10s:  market really doesn't have a firm handle on what we're pricing things out right now.
520.10s:  And I find that interesting because what's happening right now is, and this is this is
524.10s:  why I watch futures open in the evenings, it's not highly informative of what it looks
529.22s:  like the next day unless there are more extreme moves.
533.06s:  But for people like me, it's one of the easiest ways to put on a cheap hedge if something
540.02s:  looks like it's going really, really poorly.
542.70s:  And the broader portfolio might take a whack across the face on the next open.
547.54s:  You literally can use futures the night before to put on a, you know, posing position
552.14s:  a hedge just to make sure that you don't get blown up.
554.86s:  It's not something I use too frequently because as you all know, my relationship with hedging
560.34s:  is very, very different than what a lot of retail traders tell a lot of retail traders
564.74s:  try to talk about it from the perspective of I just don't like taking risk.
568.42s:  So I'm going to put on a hedge, so I don't have to experience risk, which is literally
571.86s:  a disease.
572.86s:  The reason why I say it's a disease is because you get comfortable with that.
576.38s:  And then you get uncomfortable with taking risk.
578.74s:  And if you get uncomfortable taking risk, this is a really difficult business to be in.
583.06s:  You have to accept the risk.
584.46s:  You have to control unnecessary risk.
586.98s:  And you have to have a overall comfortable relationship with risk, not extreme, but also
595.42s:  not overly risk averse.
597.02s:  And as a trader, you are literally in the business of taking risk.
601.38s:  So yeah, that's mostly what it's looking like from economics perspective.
606.26s:  Let's take a quick look at this.
610.46s:  So this is the last, I'm going to be guys back over here.
614.74s:  This is the last sentiment reading, just 73.2.
619.82s:  It's been on the climb.
621.06s:  It contracted a little bit here.
624.06s:  So I think this next one won't be this was the pre-limb.
630.98s:  I don't think this will be a huge deal provided that there's not a massive contraction.
634.86s:  But I think a lot of this will already be priced in provided that it lands pretty close
639.34s:  to where it's been.
641.58s:  And then let's take a look at the composite PMI.
647.34s:  Yeah, so composite PMI expanding quite a lot.
656.86s:  It hit, it's low in April of 24.
659.70s:  Let's get this on the three year.
664.22s:  Yeah, so it's just been like a slow nonlinear recovery for PMI.
671.98s:  The key takeaways from the economic overview is quiet economic release so far as I can
678.10s:  see for this week.
679.38s:  It doesn't look like there's a ton of data that's coming out that's likely to move the
683.50s:  markets.
684.50s:  Some smaller things here and there.
686.26s:  I think the dominant market force right now is going to be Trump and what kind of shit
690.54s:  he says.
692.30s:  Everybody is waiting to understand what the game plan is.
694.38s:  He went through and he signed a bunch of executive orders earlier today, but those are all
697.82s:  like the softball bullshit executive orders like confirming the fucking cabinet and shit
702.54s:  like that.
703.54s:  So we need to see what actually what actual policy implications.
709.58s:  And another thing that you should be paying attention to is the conflict between Ukraine
716.26s:  and Russia.
717.26s:  The reason why you should pay attention to that one is because I'm just an interested
720.74s:  in it.
721.74s:  So selfishly, I think you should pay attention to it for non-trading reasons.
725.34s:  It's just a fascinating geopolitical thing.
728.46s:  But from a trading perspective, if Trump executes as he's been talking about, which is trying
734.02s:  to find a resolution to this thing, the way that that resolution pans out is going to
739.94s:  be really important.
740.94s:  It's going to affect the market.
742.62s:  It would not surprise me at all to see if Trump and Putin and Zelensky all get together
751.06s:  and they watch frozen and they realize that maybe they don't want to keep doing this.
758.90s:  The short-term market reaction to that is probably very bullish.
763.50s:  So that's an example of a news-driven thing that depending on when the news comes out
769.10s:  provides you an opportunity in order to position.
772.70s:  The reason why it provides you an opportunity to position is because if that news comes
776.50s:  out during non-market hours, you can find some sort of long futures position.
780.74s:  That's exactly what I will do.
782.70s:  And I will trade the long futures position into the news the next day, which we'll probably
786.26s:  have fairly strong follow-through.
790.10s:  At least for a day would be my expectation if not a little bit longer.
794.58s:  Now there's also going to be some implications of that in things like Nat gas price, especially
800.74s:  if the resolution looks like Russian natural gas will then flow again unless somebody decides
808.82s:  to blow up the Nord Stream pipeline again.
810.98s:  Who knows?
811.98s:  Might walk around and do Netflix and blow up Nord Stream pipeline.
819.82s:  Who knows?
820.82s:  But provided that this doesn't happen, the impact to things like Nat gas to wheat will
826.74s:  also be observable in things that we can trade.
831.18s:  So the defense sector will probably contract on that news directly.
836.58s:  However, Trump is also talked a lot about defense.
841.54s:  And I don't actually think defense would contract too much because still under more of a
848.30s:  Republican presidency and stuff like that, we tend to see stronger defense spending
852.58s:  writ large.
853.58s:  So all of our really great friends over in the defense contractors who, you know, they
864.38s:  just want peace.
865.38s:  Right.
866.38s:  All they're just people that really want peace and they have some side projects.
871.34s:  So they're not incentivized at all to stir anything up.
874.94s:  And the military industrial complex likes nothing more than peace.
878.74s:  So I expect that they will be happy at the conclusion, hopefully of that conflict and
884.66s:  there won't be anything else.
886.06s:  Now joking aside, there is very, very.
890.78s:  There is peace through strength and that matters and that positioning matters because the
898.70s:  way that we arrive at peace from a United States perspective, typically through strength.
903.94s:  And the way that you get to strength is right now we're in a new day and age where it's
910.10s:  not all about who has the most people.
913.78s:  It is very clearly becoming more and more and more about technology who is the best technology.
920.74s:  And China was just talking about their new, I think they call it a Gen 6.
926.26s:  Is that correct?
927.26s:  Gen 6 fighter jet.
930.98s:  I think China is talking about 5th gen.
944.46s:  Not yet.
951.14s:  Right now there's a big race into 6 Gen fighters.
956.58s:  And I know that they have something underway like in the works right now, which is always
964.66s:  funny because when you look at Chinese technology with respect to jets and stuff like that,
969.26s:  they're, I don't want to say like a generation behind, but they're, it's not on part.
973.46s:  Like 5th gen fighters, it's not the same.
975.94s:  And they recently just got their 5th gen fighters online.
979.06s:  Call this back to defense.
980.70s:  Okay.
982.06s:  So let's get over and take a look at the broad markets to see what's going on underneath
986.42s:  the surface and see if there's anything in here that sticks out to us that we think
991.38s:  might provide an opportunity.
994.90s:  We can see spy has broken out of this downward channel really important.
999.62s:  Now it's not out of the woods in my opinion.
1003.58s:  The reason why it's not out of the woods yet is because it still needs to get above
1007.50s:  here.
1008.50s:  It has these local highs that it still has yet to beat out that it needs to.
1013.90s:  Right now it's still a relief rally and it will maintain status as a relief rally until
1020.58s:  there's something new that happens, which simply hasn't happened yet in terms of price
1025.50s:  behavior and resumption of an uptrend.
1030.38s:  It's just not there yet.
1032.22s:  I would expect to see it, but I also have to say I'm genuinely kind of surprised that
1039.14s:  futures are rolling over quite as much as they are.
1041.74s:  And I'm also still shocked that the Russell is up a quarter point right now.
1047.14s:  The E-minis in NASDAQ are about flattening out, which also fucking weird.
1054.58s:  This is weird.
1056.54s:  Vix is down 1.4%.
1061.50s:  That gas is down 3.8%.
1063.78s:  That gas will probably continue to have a move here.
1068.70s:  Just weird.
1069.70s:  Let me go look at some of these.
1079.18s:  Fruit oil starting to roll over.
1082.18s:  Fuckin' A. In bonds.
1085.58s:  What the fuck is happening right now?
1091.06s:  30 years are up.
1098.58s:  What do we have for the tenure?
1103.98s:  Up 0.33.
1106.38s:  0.5.
1108.38s:  So the longer end of the curve, yeah, in near terms about flat.
1116.78s:  Weird.
1118.58s:  Really really weird.
1122.22s:  What else is going on?
1123.50s:  Cryptocurrency, out flat, comfortably hovering above 100,000.
1128.22s:  Think I'll look at commodities.
1130.26s:  Look at these.
1131.26s:  These are starting to run.
1132.26s:  Holy shit.
1133.58s:  Born hitting highs.
1140.14s:  Soy being up almost a percent.
1143.82s:  We up percent and a half, but still very, very channel locked.
1147.98s:  This is just weird.
1148.98s:  I know all the fucking futures are up at the time we get to the top.
1152.46s:  Fucking weird.
1153.78s:  Really really weird.
1155.02s:  So when I see futures behavior like this that is actually pretty dramatically opposing
1161.78s:  from where it was just a few moments ago, this starts to tell you that again, the underlying
1167.70s:  market, I'm surprised to see volatility going down.
1170.90s:  I would expect to see that going up right now.
1174.50s:  So we'll have to keep an eyeball on that.
1176.50s:  Let's get back though and take a look at the sectors.
1179.98s:  So Q's looks weaker than spy, which is interesting, very important.
1185.78s:  No.
1186.78s:  Now Pelosi just took a really big position in a bunch of different tech companies.
1191.22s:  I made a tweet about it or I made an X about it.
1194.14s:  Again, whatever the fuck I'm supposed to call it, but she is, you know, she don't miss
1200.76s:  much.
1203.14s:  And for those that don't know when I say she's joking because it's actually her husband
1207.42s:  who's been a professional trader before he met her, I think, but they as much as we
1213.30s:  like to joke and say that it's Pelosi sitting there slinging trades, which is way more fun,
1218.78s:  which is why I promulgate it.
1220.70s:  I have to clarify that it's not her.
1224.74s:  It's her husband still way more fun though to think of Nancy pulling up Robinhood and
1229.42s:  just fucking slinging, you know, $500,000 positions like it's nothing that it's just too funny
1236.30s:  to me to I won't deny myself that joy, even if it's not fully representative of reality.
1244.26s:  All right.
1245.94s:  Small caps, flats, vix, flat looks like down as what we're seeing right now, bonds are
1250.78s:  going to be up a little bits, Bitcoin surging a little bit, but then recovering back down.
1256.06s:  It looks like Bitcoin is now really starting to define its its level above 100,000.
1263.22s:  It's not fully there yet, but the moving averages are starting to catch up there.
1267.10s:  We're starting to see like more distinct positioning above that 100,000 handle, which the longer
1274.26s:  it stays up there, the more support it's going to build below it.
1279.66s:  Let's get over to materials.
1283.66s:  Still relief rally, Palm services, still declining channel energy, very, very clear recovery
1292.46s:  out of here.
1293.46s:  It's up to 93.
1294.46s:  It's approaching highs.
1296.74s:  My expectation is that it would continue on this trend, especially with Trump's policies
1303.30s:  favoring the dominant players in the energy sector.
1307.94s:  So if we grab the visualized tool here and we take a look at energy, you can see that
1313.46s:  oil, gas and consumable fuels is the vast majority of the sector.
1319.06s:  So with Trump's policies coming out, this sector is likely going to appreciate pretty
1324.86s:  handsomely.
1325.86s:  We've already started looking at where is the strength within the sector for bullish
1332.50s:  style place?
1334.10s:  Because to me, that's the angle that makes sense right now is to trade this to the upside
1339.14s:  with bullish drift.
1342.14s:  And the main reason for that is because from again, a pot odds perspective, it's just a
1347.10s:  better return on the risk.
1348.66s:  I already know I've seen a bunch of posts of, I don't want to call them fools.
1355.62s:  We got dropped again.
1357.02s:  I don't know why this keeps dropping.
1360.46s:  It keeps doing this.
1361.54s:  I might turn off OBS and restart it because it seems to be, it seems to be just randomly
1371.50s:  cutting out for some reason.
1372.98s:  I don't really know why it looks fine.
1375.82s:  Anyways, I think we're back.
1378.30s:  So this, I've already seen people talking about how energy has gone too far too fast.
1384.06s:  And there's people that are trying to fade this movement.
1386.74s:  You should know better by now, especially if you are around our community, our way of
1392.74s:  thinking, our way of doing that.
1395.62s:  It keeps dropping.
1396.62s:  Give me one sec.
1397.62s:  I'm going to kill OBS and restart it one sec.
1403.54s:  One sec.
1404.54s:  I'm going to restart OBS.
1406.54s:  I'm going to kill this real fast.
1410.54s:  And no, baby.
1418.62s:  I think we're back.
1420.14s:  Sorry about that.
1421.14s:  That was super weird.
1422.14s:  OBS just kept turning off and then when I closed it, it said it crashed.
1425.50s:  So hopefully this will fix it.
1428.42s:  Looks like Thor wants to come say hello.
1430.30s:  So we'll grab him.
1431.30s:  Oh no, he's trying to get out of here.
1433.30s:  Thor, come.
1434.30s:  Boy.
1441.54s:  He's very, very bullish on oil.
1447.42s:  He's currently not bullish on OBS and whatever this thing is doing.
1454.70s:  But I let you guys take a peek at Thor.
1458.90s:  And then I'm going to pop the door so we can go grab his dinner.
1463.70s:  Off he goes.
1470.70s:  All right.
1473.70s:  Hopefully this thing will get its active in super knowing right now.
1482.66s:  Connection looks good.
1483.66s:  FPS looks good.
1485.66s:  It looks like it's getting enough.
1490.06s:  Maybe I'll slow down the connection a little bit.
1493.26s:  We'll give it a minute and see if it goes.
1494.82s:  All right.
1495.82s:  Let's get back at it though.
1497.74s:  I don't think fading energy right now here makes sense.
1500.38s:  That's the circuitous summary of whatever long version of that was going on just because
1506.82s:  of technical difficulties.
1510.50s:  I think that it is very likely to see this approach near term highs, which still gives
1516.30s:  us about another three, four points to go.
1520.42s:  And it would not surprise me in the least to see this surpass those levels.
1524.46s:  The reason why I say that is because again, if we look at the movement in energy leading
1530.14s:  into the election, it really got buried towards the end of December.
1534.62s:  And if we get some context here, we can see that it's been in this pretty long term
1539.18s:  uptrend.
1540.50s:  And now energy has just gotten a very significant catalyst and that catalyst is Trump and his
1547.50s:  policies.
1548.50s:  The dominant portion of this is oil gas.
1553.94s:  So the game then becomes choose your fighter.
1557.98s:  What do you want to do for oil and gas?
1559.58s:  You can trade something like XLE, which is absolutely crushing it.
1563.82s:  Or you can get a little more specific than that and look for things within that are
1570.02s:  even stronger.
1571.82s:  So let's take a look and see what this might look like.
1577.94s:  And we specifically want to start with energy and let's see what's been running over
1585.90s:  the last month.
1587.62s:  So we've already talked about these names.
1589.46s:  These are not new names.
1590.50s:  You know these names.
1591.82s:  And there's even some people that have trades on in these names based on the stuff that
1596.30s:  we've talked about, which again, I'm always fully against
1599.98s:  anybody placing a trade simply because I talk about something.
1604.78s:  But I absolutely do recommend using what we talk about to inform and give ideas so
1612.42s:  that you can make the best possible trades for what your portfolio needs.
1617.86s:  But you can see CTRA and EQT are still leading the pack on a four week timeframe ish.
1627.26s:  If you take a look on a slightly longer term timeframe six months out, you can see names
1632.90s:  like TRGP, TPL, KMI are leading these longer term timeframes.
1640.38s:  So what I like to do is if I'm trying to trade this broader theme, the biggest opportunity
1649.30s:  generally has already happened.
1651.74s:  So what I was doing was buying calls and stuff like EQT, essentially as we had talked
1658.10s:  about because it's been showing leadership throughout this entire thing.
1663.30s:  You can see exactly where the entry occurred.
1665.70s:  You can see where the stops are.
1667.06s:  We actually need a new stop up here.
1673.74s:  So what I'm doing is trading the leadership.
1677.10s:  And the way that I gain exposure to the leadership is through this is less of a breakout style
1683.26s:  play and more of a momentum and drift style play.
1688.06s:  So I highlight that because I use a breakout entry that's kind of soft.
1695.18s:  The reason why it's soft.
1696.58s:  There's Joe.
1697.58s:  I'll hit him up later.
1698.58s:  Let him know that we're on a stream.
1704.82s:  He did a couple podcasts a long time ago.
1709.98s:  I'm still trying to get him to come back on because for those that don't know Joe's my best
1713.70s:  friend on planet earth.
1714.70s:  I love just talking with him and bullshit.
1716.34s:  I think he's a little shy so I don't think he loves the idea of a podcast.
1721.22s:  But there's just a lot of really interesting conversations.
1725.30s:  He's one of my primary thought partners.
1727.26s:  So anyways, back to this though.
1729.86s:  This is displaying pretty clear leadership.
1732.34s:  And we can see that it's breaking above this consolidation line here.
1737.66s:  So that was essentially the catalyst for the entry is just trading the upward movement
1742.98s:  and then the expected the expected continuation from here.
1746.42s:  And it's a it's a low risk trade.
1748.94s:  That's the thing.
1749.94s:  We've talked about this a couple times now.
1752.86s:  And this has been just easy, easy trade for the year.
1757.66s:  And it wouldn't surprise me at all to see this continuing as a leader in this broader
1763.06s:  sector.
1764.66s:  So that's one of the areas that I see a lot of potential is within energy, depending
1771.46s:  on how the policy rolls out.
1774.42s:  Dan says if we drill baby drill, then wouldn't that bring the price of oil lower?
1778.46s:  Sure.
1779.46s:  Also oil typically goes lower on ever publicans and goes higher under Dems.
1783.46s:  Yeah, the it will bring the price of oil lower.
1786.02s:  That's correct.
1787.34s:  The price of oil going lower doesn't equate to less profitability for the companies.
1794.26s:  It just equates to higher supply.
1797.58s:  So their margins might look different, but that doesn't equate to oil companies not doing
1807.78s:  well.
1808.78s:  That's going to be based on overall production.
1811.70s:  Now the cool part about cheaper oil is that that essentially bleeds into everything.
1817.62s:  You will see that across the entire market, which is another cool factor.
1823.38s:  I actually just connected with Duneberg again today.
1829.10s:  And Duneberg is going to come back on in the beginning of a February.
1836.38s:  Sorry.
1837.38s:  I think I have them coming on February 6th if I'm not mistaken.
1841.78s:  So we'll be able to talk with Duneberg a little bit about this stuff and get their
1845.94s:  perspective because they really focus on energy.
1849.02s:  But David says unless Canada turns off its oil due to tariffs, I'm actually really curious
1856.74s:  how impactful that would be.
1859.02s:  Let's see if we can find out.
1860.26s:  So let's look at US oil imports and exports by country.
1878.66s:  Let's see if it's any.
1890.26s:  All right.
1897.26s:  So let's see.
1905.70s:  So in 23 US exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported.
1912.22s:  It's been a net exporter since 21.
1918.26s:  It's produced crude oil in the world where does US import petroleum from Canada is 52% Mexico
1925.86s:  11 Saudi Arabia, five Iraq for Brazil, three.
1930.34s:  And then the remaining 25% comes from a mix of other countries.
1934.90s:  So absolutely Canada is a really big component.
1940.74s:  This is also interesting.
1943.18s:  This is also interesting.
1945.94s:  So we export petroleum to Mexico, China, Canada, Netherlands, South Korea.
1952.30s:  The interesting thing about that, it's like you send it to me and I'll send it back.
1959.42s:  I mean, obviously it's joking, right?
1960.90s:  Because there's going to be different kinds of oil and different stages being sent around.
1964.58s:  But it's just kind of a funny thought.
1972.22s:  Let's see a couple of other sources.
1977.14s:  So this is just looking per day.
1979.26s:  This only goes back to 23.
1986.54s:  Okay.
1992.62s:  And then petroleum consumption.
1996.26s:  Let's see.
1997.26s:  Consumption is, it's actually kind of level.
1999.90s:  That's interesting.
2000.90s:  Net imports is down pretty big.
2006.42s:  Yeah.
2007.42s:  Because here's the other reality.
2009.10s:  If we go through with this path, David says you have refineries.
2012.82s:  We supply, get gas back.
2015.38s:  And the interesting element though is like the US sits on a massive oil supply.
2023.78s:  So let's take a look at global oil supply by country.
2029.94s:  And I want to look at crude oil.
2035.94s:  Thanks to the oil, Shale Boom, the US is now sitting on more oil reserves than Russia,
2053.90s:  which is estimated as having 256 billion barrels of untapped oil.
2059.06s:  The next after that is Saudi Arabia to 12.
2062.26s:  So the reason why this matters is because the amount of recoverable oil reserves in the
2067.50s:  US has shift a lot.
2070.02s:  And that starts to paint the broader macro picture in terms of how we position ourselves.
2078.10s:  Because there is a long time where the US was like really, really, really hinged on gaining
2083.74s:  access to oil from other sources.
2086.70s:  But the more that the US becomes self-sufficient in this way, which is what it's seeking to do,
2091.94s:  it starts to have a much stronger bargaining position.
2096.70s:  And this is likely to be one of the major friction points between the US and Canada with
2101.54s:  the terror of conversation that's coming up.
2104.06s:  I'm so curious how that will actually play out.
2108.22s:  My expectation for somebody like Trump for those that don't know, you've probably heard
2113.34s:  that he's a good negotiator.
2114.94s:  And you can see artifacts of his negotiation skills in the way that he talks.
2120.02s:  One of the things that he does that's actually really effective for negotiations is you start
2125.22s:  from a point of hyperbole.
2126.98s:  You start with things that are really, really extreme so that as you have dialogue back
2131.94s:  and forth and you land closer to what is conceivably the middle, the middle is actually
2137.14s:  closer to where you want it to be from the jump.
2139.94s:  So we start from a point of hyperbole.
2143.22s:  So I wouldn't be surprised to see that utilized here.
2149.18s:  Tommy says what's going to happen to TikTok?
2151.26s:  So if for those that don't know, TikTok started off banned yesterday and then towards the
2157.10s:  middle slash towards the end of the middle of the day early afternoon, the ban was lifted.
2163.42s:  And so now it looks like Trump is talking about an extension on the law.
2171.06s:  Now the next piece of that is the final resolution.
2176.18s:  Got to be careful saying that I think is that the, yeah, I think that that's a bad one.
2181.78s:  I'm pretty sure.
2182.78s:  I think our boy Hitler used that one.
2184.54s:  Was that, is that what he called it?
2185.90s:  Is it the final?
2186.90s:  Or was it the ultimate?
2190.22s:  I forgot what he called it.
2194.18s:  Is it the final?
2195.42s:  Well, anyways, the final resolution that Trump arrives at with TikTok so far, Dylan says
2205.58s:  final solution.
2206.58s:  Ah, that's it.
2207.58s:  Thank you, Dylan.
2208.58s:  Yeah, that's it.
2209.58s:  Final solution, not resolution.
2211.10s:  So it looks like Trump is trying to set up joint ownership of TikTok between 50, 50%
2217.22s:  US government in China, which I actually think is kind of a good thing.
2220.22s:  If that, if that can be done, I actually think that would be a good thing because I also
2226.98s:  think that starts to strengthen the general relationship a little bit more.
2232.06s:  Oh, here we go.
2234.10s:  So Trump, I just got a thing from breaking news that says Trump released a executive order
2241.02s:  relating to gender, let's see.
2243.34s:  All right.
2244.82s:  So this says in a significant move towards reshaping federal policy on gender, Donald Trump
2249.26s:  is set to sign two executive orders on Monday to, to incoming White House officials.
2255.94s:  One of the orders will establish the recognition of only two immutable sexes, male and female,
2262.34s:  based on whether the individuals were born with eggs or sperm.
2265.30s:  This is, this change is pitched as a way to protect that.
2268.82s:  I don't want to get it all that stuff.
2271.38s:  So the second order will block requirements that government facilities and workplaces that
2277.06s:  transgender individuals be referred to using pronouns that align with their gender, citing
2281.58s:  violations of first amendments, freedom of speech, religion, that are interesting.
2289.10s:  The game continues.
2290.10s:  They got to open the door for the way.
2299.82s:  He's a picky little man.
2306.82s:  Joe says glad Trump is tackling the important issues.
2309.30s:  Yeah.
2310.30s:  Well, not to, I'm not going to get the railed on that, but the fact I can't help but just
2316.18s:  find it comical that those are some of the initial issues.
2319.78s:  The other thing I thought was really interesting.
2321.30s:  If I'm not mistaken, I think Biden hardened, Fauci in a handful of people, essentially
2328.38s:  right at midnight last night.
2332.78s:  Let's see.
2338.02s:  In some of them, I didn't know who they were.
2344.02s:  So this is from, he went to clemency, Sunday to five people, most of whom were convicted
2351.34s:  of non-violent drug offenses and community dissentances of two individuals who he said have
2356.14s:  demonstrated remorse rehabilitation of redemption among those was Marcus Mosaic Garvey, who was
2363.42s:  granted clemency post-humanistly.
2366.78s:  Pardon Ravi Ragbeer, advocate for immigrant rights and chemist Smith Bedea.
2377.86s:  Okay.
2385.18s:  We know that he pardon his son earlier in the month and all that stuff.
2391.86s:  All right.
2395.30s:  Let's get back and back in black.
2400.78s:  Great song by ACDC.
2402.02s:  Fucking futures are down now.
2404.74s:  Crazy.
2405.74s:  And it's like really anomalous movement to see it, to see it, ebbing and flowing as much
2411.46s:  as it is right now.
2414.70s:  This is pretty nuts.
2418.42s:  And the wrestle continues.
2421.14s:  Let's see if there's a trade here.
2425.06s:  I don't think so, man.
2428.14s:  Look at that.
2429.74s:  That candle is really not good.
2433.74s:  All right.
2437.98s:  Now let's take a look at the rest of the sectors really fast.
2445.94s:  Financials look good.
2446.94s:  They had really, really good earnings, really good earnings.
2449.70s:  We'll take a quick peek at those.
2452.06s:  Utilities are looking good, not as good as energy.
2456.38s:  Healthcare.
2457.38s:  I mean, slowly trending up, but not too heavily.
2464.42s:  And then discretionary, still outperforming staples by literally just a massive landslide,
2472.74s:  not even close.
2476.82s:  So from a long delta perspective, you literally have your pick of the litter.
2482.70s:  You have a stain power in comm services.
2487.98s:  You have stain power in not back.
2492.22s:  You have near-term recovery and velocity in energy in financials.
2499.70s:  You still have stain power in discretionary.
2505.34s:  It looks like if we're looking for some short delta, as we can find a few things.
2512.42s:  Now the Russell is flipped.
2513.70s:  Oh no, it's not flipped.
2516.26s:  The S&P is about to flip again, back positive.
2521.22s:  We'll see.
2523.10s:  And then real estate is still flat.
2526.14s:  So those are a couple of places to look for shorts for adding some short deltas.
2531.58s:  We'll go through a broader portfolio update and all that stuff on the pro stream tomorrow.
2537.06s:  So I'm not going to spend time going through too many of my positions right now.
2542.22s:  But I do think we need to add a little bit here, not a whole lot.
2548.42s:  But we definitely need to add a little bit here.
2551.62s:  So I am generally agnostic to longer short deltas, I think both are fine.
2559.50s:  Let's see what pops up here.
2564.78s:  I want to run two scans quickly.
2567.98s:  And then I'm going to get back to working on the homework that I started with earlier,
2572.66s:  which is that coverage strangle analysis.
2576.06s:  And then if there's any questions or anything that you guys want to take a look at now is
2579.38s:  a perfect time to start throwing those in.
2582.82s:  So let's take a look at this first.
2592.54s:  So this is looking at stuff that appears to be consolidating.
2596.06s:  This is often the idea to find setups free breakout.
2601.06s:  So before they break out, that's not it.
2610.38s:  No.
2613.58s:  Nope.
2620.58s:  Maybe.
2628.58s:  Nope.
2635.58s:  Nope.
2639.58s:  No.
2646.58s:  No.
2649.58s:  No.
2656.58s:  No.
2660.58s:  No.
2665.58s:  No.
2671.58s:  Also, no.
2674.58s:  Welcome to the fun part of trading where we just flip through tons of shit that doesn't look
2678.58s:  good until you eventually stumble across something that you actually like.
2682.46s:  This is, this is a day in the life.
2686.78s:  And this is also why my brain is a really fucked up repository of a bunch of different
2694.54s:  techers.
2695.54s:  Fucking markets turned around again.
2699.54s:  E-minis up.
2705.54s:  Nope.
2708.54s:  Nope.
2709.54s:  Okay.
2711.54s:  So let's find another.
2716.54s:  We want to look at this one.
2719.54s:  This is looking at some relative strength.
2724.54s:  And then we want to add one more filter.
2734.54s:  Or open interest just to make sure that we're getting.
2738.54s:  Something that's at least reasonably liquid.
2743.54s:  And we went from 193 to 169.
2746.54s:  So most of these will fall into that.
2750.54s:  And let's see.
2757.54s:  James says S&P dipped to retest the upper down trend channel after the Friday break.
2765.54s:  I mean, I don't.
2767.54s:  I don't think it dipped specifically to retest that personally.
2771.54s:  I think it's really dangerous to phrase market movements like that, to be honest, because
2776.54s:  the it's really important to remember that markets are consensus.
2781.54s:  So it didn't dip somewhere to retest anything.
2787.54s:  It just happens to be the place that buyers and sellers think something might be worth.
2793.14s:  Now, I understand your underlying point.
2794.94s:  And I agree with it to be clear, right?
2797.04s:  And I think that's what we actually mean by that is by saying there are a bunch of different reasons for short term selling to send price down to where we perceive to be a near term support level where buying will occur.
2814.04s:  But just for a lot of other people, it is a little too simplified, I think.
2823.04s:  And it starts to add our that doesn't really exist in like lines on charts.
2833.04s:  All right.
2835.04s:  Next one.
2838.04s:  Joe says what no mean. I see a couple of shorts that look bullish.
2842.04s:  I see.
2844.04s:  Well, no means for those. No means no.
2847.04s:  And when I'm saying no on these, I'm not the underlying structure that I'm scanning for here is not bullish in nature.
2857.04s:  Or I'm sorry, it's not bearish in nature.
2859.04s:  If I'm looking for bearish names, I look at things that specifically look bearish.
2867.04s:  So the thing with scanning for stuff is my underlying my underlying methodology is something you're all familiar with, but it's called looking for nose.
2882.04s:  And it's not looking for the thing at the end of your face.
2885.04s:  It's scanning through stuff and making sure that we're stacking strength.
2889.04s:  So even though some of these like this one, this doesn't look good.
2893.04s:  This is not a good entry for the specific kind of scan that I'm running right now, which is a consolidation pre breakout.
2900.04s:  And the reason is because the entire setup going into a breakout here is all fucked up.
2906.04s:  It's fucked up like a football bat.
2908.04s:  That being said, that doesn't mean that this to your point couldn't be seen as bearish play, right?
2916.04s:  Like if we think that this downside channel is going to continue and stuff like that, but I'm specifically going to look for things if I want to put on a bearish trade that look diseased that really are super are super bearish.
2931.04s:  And this is not super bearish on a six month timeframe.
2934.04s:  It's still upward sloping.
2936.04s:  It still has positive movement on a three month timeframe.
2940.04s:  So the game here when we're conducting technical analysis is to try and align what we're doing with the time frames that we're trying to do them in so that it makes sense.
2953.04s:  Even on a one month timeframe, it's still positive sloping.
2957.04s:  So when we look at all of those different things that doesn't mean that this one single opportunity couldn't be bullish or bearish.
2968.04s:  And single opportunity could work out just fine.
2971.04s:  But what ends up happening frequently with traders is we try so hard to make individual trades make sense or work according to our approach.
2982.04s:  And that comes at a significant cost.
2986.04s:  That cost is how we deploy something over the long run over a long term timeframe.
2995.04s:  So what that means is if we over time continue to take sub optimal setups for something like this, the performance is going to show that the performance won't look good.
3007.04s:  So yeah, that's the broader context behind as I'm going through these.
3012.04s:  There are very, very specific conditions that I'm looking for that look good or don't look good based on the specific setup that I'm trying to find.
3022.04s:  And if I don't see it there, then I don't really waste much time at all lingering on it and will quickly move on until something else, something else looks better.
3034.04s:  Travel says can you can you sometimes say a few few a few things why note for our learning. Yeah, absolutely.
3043.04s:  So going back to this one, why this doesn't fit well with the broader breakout approach is that it's below a point of control has too much overhead resistance.
3056.04s:  It also has all this price action up over here that I don't want to see. I want to see prior to break out near term highs.
3065.04s:  So local highs over here as compared to over here. That's a primary reason why this one doesn't look good.
3072.04s:  Now let's run through a couple other of these really fast and see I want to look for things on a shorter term time frames like a month, two weeks.
3082.04s:  And see if we can find things that are showing some strength like this.
3087.04s:  This is a completely different example because this is already broken out once it looks like it's in the process of consolidating here.
3097.04s:  So this one gets added to a couple different alerts so that I can monitor its price performance and see if it takes another leg up and chooses to break out again.
3110.04s:  Or if it doesn't and if it doesn't that's okay. I don't really care. But I'm going to try to play along with it if it does.
3117.04s:  And let's see if we can find a few more here. This is another decent example of that. So this would be a break below here.
3128.04s:  For a hard stop and then a break below here. This looks like it's down trending.
3133.04s:  So I don't love that. I would wait and see how it behaves in relation to this high.
3143.04s:  And let's take a look at our RC.
3151.04s:  This one's another strong breakout. What is this based on you can see we've already looked at this one before because we have alerts on it as is.
3159.04s:  But this alert is completely useless now though. We need an alert here.
3171.04s:  And then we need an alert here.
3177.04s:  And then a downside alert here. This looks good.
3181.04s:  So for something like this, I'll do like a quick model trade. And then I'm going to get back into my homework that I was doing before.
3189.04s:  I'm still going to stay on the stream so you guys can hang out if you want, but we're coming up on time here.
3193.04s:  So I figure we can at least model one trade just for a couple of repetitions.
3198.04s:  So from a breakout perspective, this thing is already broken out.
3202.04s:  The more times something breaks out and has these legs up, the more feeble they become.
3207.04s:  So you have to pay attention to how you're sizing your risk.
3211.04s:  And the idea is to try to catch them a little bit earlier in their stages.
3216.04s:  Now this one I remember distinctly popped up when I was getting ready to go traveling and stuff.
3221.04s:  So there was nothing that worked out for me in terms of a natural entrance.
3226.04s:  But that also worked out okay because I would have been entering somewhere in here.
3231.04s:  So it didn't really do anything in this whole phase.
3236.04s:  And it's not until it broke above here that it actually showed us anything above this 3640 handle.
3243.04s:  Now on earnings it had a good beat.
3246.04s:  So it came in at 0.48 against 0.31 expected.
3252.04s:  Having a strong catalyst is really, really important.
3257.04s:  And if we take a quick look at structuring something in here, we can see that it has big call skew about three to one calls to puts.
3265.04s:  And we can see that pretty significant number of them are in the 21 March expiration just by looking at the dots here.
3273.04s:  And then I can see a bunch of them are in 16 Jan.
3275.04s:  So let's take a quick look and see those expiration 21 March is 13 K 16 Jan 6.
3281.04s:  There's nothing in 19 set 20 June is light at five and 21 Feb is light at one.
3288.04s:  So there's 13 and 21 March 6700 and 17 Jan leads me to believe that something's going on in 21 March.
3296.04s:  What is this?
3298.04s:  Erning's it's not earnings because earnings is set for the 19th.
3303.04s:  Oh wait, the 29th or no, the 19th.
3306.04s:  So this actually would capture earnings.
3309.04s:  This is not people playing earnings with options. This is people playing likely something else.
3315.04s:  So let me see if I can find.
3319.04s:  I'm going to go into my market research GPT.
3323.04s:  And let's go to this one.
3327.04s:  And let's take a look at research.
3362.04s:  Spected around.
3367.04s:  It's expected between 21 Feb and 21 March.
3378.04s:  All right, let's see.
3385.04s:  Okay. So they're shocker independent natural gas natural liquid gas crude oil and condensate company operating in the Appalachian region of the US.
3398.04s:  They we already looked at their earnings data solid earnings revenue for the quarter was 615 mill 0.9% your over your increase slightly lower than consensus.
3409.04s:  Right now most analysts have it rated at a hold with the median price target of 36.
3419.04s:  Projection suggests that range resources could generate over 900 million of recast flow in 25 based on the commodity price trends.
3428.04s:  While specific events between 21 Feb and 21 March are not detailed.
3433.04s:  They release quarterly earnings in late April.
3437.04s:  Ah, maybe that's it. So maybe they have them slated for earnings.
3447.04s:  Well, that's too far though if it's actually April compared to here.
3451.04s:  No, no, it's weird. Let's take a look at a trade in here.
3455.04s:  So we have the 15 wide 20 wide 20 wide.
3467.04s:  It goes somewhere in here.
3469.04s:  And it looks like the depth of OIs in one of these two.
3474.04s:  These are a little more liquid at 15 wide.
3478.04s:  So you get in at 288.
3481.04s:  We'll take a look at all that stuff in a minute.
3484.04s:  We're just going to plot some stuff first to.
3487.04s:  Take a look at this trade together. Oh, yeah, we got to take a look at what is this like 55 minutes we started doing this.
3493.04s:  This will be sample.
3495.04s:  And RRC.
3501.04s:  And let's see. Yeah, IV is super low.
3505.04s:  So that's easy decision on the buy.
3511.04s:  And then 288. That's good.
3516.04s:  We do stop.
3520.04s:  I'm fine at stop sub 40.
3524.04s:  3987.
3530.04s:  So we're run it for 39.
3533.04s:  87.
3535.04s:  So then on a since this is a really, really high probability trade in terms of a loss.
3545.04s:  So what I do is I tend to size these a little bit smaller until we really start to get a stronger accommodating move.
3556.04s:  So on a hundred thousand dollar account that equals something like maybe 15.
3562.04s:  I'm sorry, half a percent or something like that.
3566.04s:  So a hundred thousand dollar account.
3569.04s:  We can risk something like this.
3574.04s:  So that's out at 489.
3577.04s:  I'd rather be skiing is the homey.
3580.04s:  Everybody give a shout out to I'd rather be skiing because he just hooked a bunch of people up with a.
3587.04s:  Outlier trading membership.
3589.04s:  Those are on the YouTube channel.
3591.04s:  It's just a really awesome way to help support the channel.
3594.04s:  I appreciate it very much.
3596.04s:  You guys get a little bit of a different swag in the chats.
3601.04s:  And it also funnels you guys up to the top during the chat so that I can see you better.
3606.04s:  So really, really appreciate that.
3608.04s:  Always awesome.
3610.04s:  And that will go to the video editor.
3613.04s:  Actually that I've been slowly trying to groom.
3616.04s:  I'm still working on my trying to maybe line up with my old video editor as well.
3622.04s:  Because I liked our style a lot.
3624.04s:  But yeah, thank you very much.
3625.04s:  It helps me hopefully make stuff that's better for you.
3629.04s:  So let's take a look at this trade.
3634.04s:  This would be.
3637.04s:  Getting stopped out at 3987.
3639.04s:  Would we want to sell any calls in here?
3642.04s:  Maybe.
3644.04s:  What's the scope of this move?
3653.04s:  25%.
3656.04s:  And then from the breakout itself.
3664.04s:  12%.
3668.04s:  And then from here.
3672.04s:  21%.
3674.04s:  And then from the breakout.
3679.04s:  14%.
3681.04s:  So what I look at is using these as models.
3686.04s:  So about a 25% move.
3693.04s:  And we're essentially near highs.
3696.04s:  So if we zoom this back in.
3699.04s:  And we surmise that we might get like a 25% move on 41.
3706.04s:  So what is that 10 points.
3709.04s:  10% is 410 20% 820.
3714.04s:  Yeah.
3715.04s:  So like 12.
3721.04s:  So that puts us.
3724.04s:  What is this?
3727.04s:  So let's take a look at our C.
3747.04s:  Yeah, I wouldn't have any problems on some calls in here.
3750.04s:  I would keep them further out.
3753.04s:  But the it's like really a liquid.
3755.04s:  So I would have to see if the liquidity tightens up.
3758.04s:  If the liquidity doesn't tighten up then no way.
3762.04s:  But if it does tighten up, then sure, I don't see anything wrong with offering a little bit of premium in here.
3768.04s:  On the short side.
3769.04s:  The reason why I say that is because these surges that it has are a little more orderly than some of the other stuff, some of the other stuff that we've looked at will have just insane, insane surges that then crumble.
3784.04s:  So once they finally slow down and you don't want to get stuck trying to unwind short calls that are in the money that you've rolled while it's slowing down, that's bad because then it kind of puts you in a bad spot where you're giving up profits to try to get out of those short calls for a profit.
3799.04s:  So we don't want that.
3801.04s:  So this doesn't look to behave quite like that.
3805.04s:  I would look to sell those short calls a little further out of the money, probably like a 20 delta something like that.
3811.04s:  And yeah, I mean, that's the that's the sample trade for today.
3818.04s:  Now it's time for me to get back into my study that I was doing. So I got 105.
3825.04s:  20, which is covered, triangle, 2022 study.
3832.04s:  So what I've been doing is I have a scratch, covered, strangled tracker up right now.
3841.04s:  And what I'm doing is incurring with a covered, strangled dumb management.
3852.04s:  And what I mean by that is I'm essentially trading the coverage, triangle, I'll grab it out of my actual log for you guys and then we can just take a look at it together.
3865.04s:  What I'm doing is trading it from the perspective of a simplified management approach, which means I'm not doing a bunch of fancy stuff or anything like that.
3881.04s:  And I'm just kind of running it. So actually we could just use my main.
3888.04s:  This log is fine.
3896.04s:  Let me grab my, it's not going to be up for most of it anyways, but I just want you to.
3909.04s:  And.
3922.04s:  Okay.
3927.04s:  Just run it over really quick with the eyeballs and make sure everything's good.
3931.04s:  Yeah, it looks like we are right. I got a zoom out a little.
3935.04s:  Probably zoom out some.
3941.04s:  All right.
3945.04s:  So here's the log that I'm filling in.
3950.04s:  And what I'm doing here is I'm manually clicking through and I'm manually going back in time and trading the coverage, triangle.
3960.04s:  And this is using spy.
3962.04s:  Essentially what I'm doing is just a lazy two times three times comparison where what I'll do is amplify the returns by two, three percent.
3972.04s:  It's that's not accurate, but it just gives a sense of scale.
3977.04s:  And there will be pretty significant deviations off of that.
3981.04s:  So while I'm clicking through on the platform over here, this is what I'm actually inputting.
3987.04s:  And the way that I'm managing it right now is is actually really, really simple. I need to move the chat.
3994.04s:  So that I can keep talking to you guys while I'm doing this.
3999.04s:  And if you guys have questions and stuff now is a perfect time while I'm working on this, because like I said, this is shit that I'm doing for myself.
4006.04s:  So I'm going to be just kind of popping along.
4010.04s:  If you're interested in just the market stuff, now is a perfect time to sign off.
4018.04s:  Let's get back into on demand.
4023.04s:  Does anyone actually buy cash secured puts on pounds are do you mean buy or sell because typically like we wouldn't use the terminology buy a cash secured put.
4036.04s:  When you buy an option, it's automatically cash secured to you have to buy it.
4043.04s:  So I think you might have meant sell.
4048.04s:  And it wouldn't surprise me.
4051.04s:  Because I want to is like pretty strong sponsorship.
4056.04s:  So yeah, I could totally see that.
4059.04s:  Definitely not in my book in that way, but just because it's not my book that way doesn't mean other people wouldn't do it.
4066.04s:  Alright, so right now where I had left off, I started at the first the first segment of the year, meaning the very first trading day, which in this case was three jam 22.
4079.04s:  And I'm literally just clicking through to two expiration day.
4083.04s:  I'm not clicking through and doing each day as if I would management and all that stuff.
4090.04s:  Like I said, I'm doing quite literally a dumb study.
4095.04s:  And for a quick update on where that sits right now, it's a series of managing in the money short puts.
4104.04s:  So you can see that there is a lot of puts that needed to be rolled in stuff.
4109.04s:  But again, I just applied a very, very basic approach here.
4114.04s:  And as the strategy sits right now, it is a realized profit of like $3,600 total PNL right now is 16221 in the negative.
4123.04s:  So total return on a vested capital is negative 10.1% whereas the market as it sits at the time of doing this based on entry time to current time.
4133.04s:  It would be a little bit less than that.
4138.04s:  So let's see what I need to update the price to whatever it is now. So 42360.
4143.04s:  So let's take a look at what it would be worth at 423.6.
4149.04s:  So right now,
4153.04s:  who is this?
4157.04s:  So right now,
4160.04s:  so right now,
4162.04s:  where we're at in the study based on entry at 47561 current spot at 423,
4168.04s:  it means that the trade itself would be down 10.9%.
4173.04s:  If you just did a buy and hold version,
4175.04s:  an hour version is down just 3.34%,
4179.04s:  which is about standard fair. That's what I would expect to see.
4183.04s:  This strategy, especially during down moves,
4186.04s:  I maintain a pretty distinct advantage over it.
4189.04s:  Now, I'm actually managing at this point the first version of in the money short call,
4195.04s:  we're at the 405, which is kind of brutal because
4200.04s:  if I were actually managing this,
4202.04s:  I would have already rolled that short call,
4205.04s:  but I didn't do that.
4207.04s:  And again, because I'm just applying expiration style management where we go to expiration.
4211.04s:  This is much more similar to what I trade in things like my IRA account.
4216.04s:  Where I'm not managing it anywhere near is actively is what I'm doing in the primary trading account.
4222.04s:  So let's take a look.
4225.04s:  We have the 405s, we just closed them for 1851.
4229.04s:  So now we have to see where we can get 1851,
4233.04s:  which is here at the 409.
4236.04s:  So I don't have to add any size and I can actually get a pretty decent basis adjustment.
4240.04s:  These are going to be a 73 delta.
4242.04s:  The premium I'm going to take is 18.8.
4244.04s:  I'm going to keep it out of one lot.
4246.04s:  I'm not going to size it up yet, although I could if I were so inclined.
4250.04s:  And let's take this over into the closed calls.
4255.04s:  And now we fast forward time.
4257.04s:  So right now the position is sitting on 264 shares at 453 18.
4267.04s:  And we have one short put out at 412.
4273.04s:  We have one short call out at 409.
4276.04s:  Total utilization right now is 80.42%.
4282.04s:  So we have most of the trade utilized.
4286.04s:  What I'm doing is I'm implementing like I was telling you before a slightly new approach.
4291.04s:  And I'm using two different factors to determine the allocation utilization and scaling protocols.
4299.04s:  The first factor is distance three factors.
4302.04s:  Sorry, three factors.
4303.04s:  The first factor is distance off of highs.
4305.04s:  The second factor is every 5% down move.
4309.04s:  Third factor is VIX.
4311.04s:  And I'm using VIX to manage the overall scaling approach where during VIX,
4321.04s:  periods that exceed a certain level, I stop scaling in.
4327.04s:  And the point of that is to try to minimize how much I'm stepping in front of really big down moves.
4334.04s:  But the scaling in that I'm referring to there is by buying shares outright.
4339.04s:  The scaling in still will be accomplished via short puts.
4344.04s:  Lauren says same strategy, different approach.
4347.04s:  Yeah, that's that's kind of it.
4349.04s:  So the coverage strangle or really any options trading strategy can have a million different slight variations, quirks and versions to it.
4357.04s:  So that's exactly correct. That's exactly what this is.
4360.04s:  What I'm doing is applying a study to it.
4367.04s:  I had just gone through and finished through broader data analysis, determining what I wanted to use for the scaling protocols.
4376.04s:  How much I wanted to use upfront.
4378.04s:  And the way that I answer that question is I download data from bar chart, just stock level data.
4386.04s:  And I say, I want to know how in this case, S&P 500 tends to move.
4392.04s:  So I'll download the data and then I'll run it through Python.
4395.04s:  And I want to ask myself some key questions.
4398.04s:  What I want to do is make sure that I'm using enough of the portfolio to make money.
4404.04s:  And the amount of money I need to make is more than buy and hold.
4408.04s:  Otherwise, I'm better off with buy and hold.
4411.04s:  So the first question is how much money should I be using upfront at the at the entrance of the strategy.
4420.04s:  Should it be 30% 40% 50% 60% so on and so forth.
4425.04s:  The way that we answer that question is we say based on different initial entrances, all those different percentages that I just listed out.
4433.04s:  We then test what the performance is over two different periods.
4441.04s:  The first period is historic price data.
4444.04s:  The second is through machine learning model and then running a money carlo simulation based off of inputs from the prior period.
4454.04s:  So that it's not completely random simulations.
4457.04s:  That doesn't really help anything.
4459.04s:  I say completely random meaning it's not forecasting S and P 500 going up 500%.
4464.04s:  What we're doing is we're using old data to then train a future simulation so that the future simulation will be absolutely novel.
4475.04s:  But it won't be crazy.
4477.04s:  It'll still be applicable.
4478.04s:  And then we run like 30,000 simulations, which is really fast.
4483.04s:  Based on that, I can figure out what is the optimal initial starting point.
4488.04s:  And then from there, I can take a closer look at what's the appropriate scaling protocols, how much money should go in at what points.
4497.04s:  And the way that I structure that is actually a bit of a mix.
4502.04s:  The reason I say it's a bit of a mix is because it's not based purely on what's fully optimal.
4508.04s:  It's based on what's robust, but what's also easy to replicate.
4513.04s:  Because what gets really confusing to replicate is if we overfit it and we say, well, based on a first 11% drop and then a subsequent 5.2% drop and then a subsequent 6.8.
4526.04s:  It's just like, it's too difficult to follow when it's kind of completely fucking random.
4531.04s:  So I use basic, basic adjustment points that are really robust.
4539.04s:  So it means that they're not fully optimized to get the best possible outcome.
4543.04s:  But it means that they're really replicable across all of those different tests series.
4549.04s:  So that I know that the rules that actually make sense is not just overfit to the data source.
4554.04s:  So we'll go over all of this stuff way more in detail during the Patreon stream tomorrow.
4560.04s:  Once I have this kind of finished and dialed in right now, I'm just going through the high level stuff.
4565.04s:  So given you guys the context of the study and then running through this is like an eyeball test.
4571.04s:  This doesn't, this isn't really for anything other than for me to see what the performance could look like based on the defined management protocols.
4581.04s:  See how it looks like on the chart see if I like it.
4584.04s:  See if there's things that I feel like I need to test differently and back on a stuff.
4588.04s:  So that is what we're doing right now.
4593.04s:  Alright, so we are in.
4598.04s:  19 on okay, we're good.
4600.04s:  We are ready to, are we ready to fast forward? We got to go through the chart.
4605.04s:  So the other scaling rules that I tinker with is the relationship between stuff like 200 day m a's 50 day m a's the relationship between the m a's amongst one another stuff like that.
4617.04s:  And what I want again is not to find the the scaling tool that's quote unquote best in terms of what gives me the best possible results.
4626.04s:  But I want the best tool in terms of there's less variance across all the different studies, which tells me that it's much more robust.
4635.04s:  Alright, so let's go to 16 step.
4637.04s:  And I am just fast forwarding to the actual explorations.
4641.04s:  So now we are very clearly rolling back over.
4646.04s:  So let's see where we're at.
4648.04s:  This will help these in the money calls, but it will hurt literally everything.
4656.04s:  So let's see, we had the 409's we sold them for 1880.
4662.04s:  Let's see what they come in.
4668.04s:  Any.
4670.04s:  So I never close them at like zero, like I don't take them in an expiration.
4678.04s:  The reason why I don't take them in an expiration is because I know I am going to sell the early.
4687.04s:  More on expiration day, meaning like I don't want to go through the weekend without the position on because then it doesn't right doesn't really help me.
4695.04s:  So we're at 383.
4698.04s:  That 383, S&P 500 is down 19.47% from our entry.
4704.04s:  Our position in total is down 8.8%.
4708.04s:  So it's absolutely crushing the S&P 500 like handedly.
4713.04s:  So let's take a look at.
4720.04s:  The short calls are easy because those came down for a full profit.
4724.04s:  We got to take a look at the puts, which are going to be struggling, which are the 412's here.
4729.04s:  We're going to have to close those for 2887.
4734.04s:  So now we have to roll these again.
4737.04s:  I had just gotten into a clean set of puts, but that is now gone.
4744.04s:  So let's go to 21 oct.
4748.04s:  Lauren says it will hurt literally everything.
4751.04s:  Yep, that's right.
4752.04s:  21 oct.
4753.04s:  22.
4754.04s:  So stock is at 383.
4756.04s:  Expiration is 21 oct.
4758.04s:  22 today's date is 16 sub 22.
4764.04s:  And strike price.
4769.04s:  Let's see.
4771.04s:  We can get the 412's.
4772.04s:  So we need to get at least 28 bucks.
4776.04s:  We can get that here at the 410's.
4778.04s:  And we don't have to add size.
4781.04s:  Now from my approach, this is not where I would add size anyways on these short puts.
4788.04s:  The reason why I wouldn't add size here is because from a technical perspective, it's below literally all of the moving averages.
4795.04s:  The moving averages are all essentially inverted at this point.
4799.04s:  And the price just fell out below this level.
4804.04s:  So it's not consolidating at all.
4806.04s:  So if I can get a decent role like I can right now without adding size, I'll take that because it's we don't know where the floor is.
4816.04s:  So that that's why.
4818.04s:  So point eight fourth.
4819.04s:  This is poking me.
4821.04s:  Feels like there's the end of a.
4837.04s:  Feels like the end of a tag.
4841.04s:  Having me.
4848.04s:  But I don't feel it on my thumb.
4853.04s:  Weird.
4856.04s:  Okay.
4858.04s:  So we have 84 delta.
4861.04s:  Premium is going to be 2839, which actually is no good.
4866.04s:  That won't do it.
4868.04s:  We need.
4870.04s:  411.
4872.04s:  So we're going to get a one point price change.
4875.04s:  25 delta.
4877.04s:  Premium is going to be 29.22.
4879.04s:  One lot.
4880.04s:  Lauren says tags are evil.
4882.04s:  I caught out all minutes at system.
4884.04s:  I do the same exact thing.
4886.04s:  The here's one that really bothers me.
4889.04s:  Why is it that dog toys.
4893.04s:  Have.
4895.04s:  So many damn tags on them.
4898.04s:  How does that make any sense whatsoever for a fucking dog toy?
4903.04s:  Okay.
4905.04s:  One other admin note is in this study.
4908.04s:  I am selling below my basis.
4911.04s:  I found certain deltas make the most sense based on where volatility is and stuff like that.
4917.04s:  So that is a slight difference than what you will see in other scenarios in this trade right here.
4924.04s:  The correct is.
4926.04s:  The 20 delta.
4927.04s:  But then I also keep the size smaller.
4930.04s:  So right now I have 264 shares.
4933.04s:  I'm only selling a one lot.
4935.04s:  So it's a way for me to take in something but not get myself in trouble.
4939.04s:  So now we go to 21 oct.
4942.04s:  And see where we're at.
4944.04s:  So now it's basing.
4946.04s:  So now we can see it hit a floor here.
4950.04s:  It's setting a lower a higher low.
4954.04s:  It's not yet challenged this local low here.
4957.04s:  So it would be a little early to scale in but I probably would do it.
4963.04s:  So let's see where we're at.
4968.04s:  This 407 call should still be unscathed.
4972.04s:  I think.
4974.04s:  Yep. So that'll come down.
4978.04s:  For a penny.
4980.04s:  Doc is at 371.
4983.04s:  So we make a few dollars.
4985.04s:  On the short call not much.
4987.04s:  But so far the short calls are helping us because we've made 3319.
4991.04s:  On the short calls which is again it's not a ton but that's that's.
4996.04s:  On the overall allocation.
4999.04s:  For the strategy is we're running it's $200,000.
5002.04s:  So it's over a percent.
5005.04s:  That you're getting just from the short call side of thing.
5008.04s:  And this is the way that we make this work.
5011.04s:  So we're going to be able to make this work.
5014.04s:  So we're going to be able to make this work.
5017.04s:  So we're going to be able to make this work.
5020.04s:  Is.
5023.04s:  Nickel and Dining hour way there.
5026.04s:  All right. So our 3803s will come down for a profit but still be in the money.
5030.04s:  So these are going to be at 1116.
5034.04s:  The stock at exit again is 372.
5037.04s:  We'll call it.
5040.04s:  Is going to be 18.
5043.04s:  Strike price.
5048.04s:  We need to get at least 11 but we're going to add some size.
5052.04s:  So I actually think we can go out here to like a 30 delta and normalize.
5057.04s:  So our strike price would be 358.
5060.04s:  Delta is three.
5062.04s:  Premium would be 613.
5064.04s:  Will that get us what we need.
5066.04s:  On a 2 lot.
5069.04s:  Yeah, we're good.
5072.04s:  So that'll be fine.
5075.04s:  Because between these.
5078.04s:  We needed.
5081.04s:  600 bucks and this is given us 12.
5083.04s:  So we're good.
5084.04s:  That'll clean up the role.
5091.04s:  And now we have to get our short calls back out.
5097.04s:  371.
5098.04s:  What's the 20 delta at 397, which is fine.
5102.04s:  Again, it's only going to be a one lot because we don't have the shares.
5107.04s:  We only have 200 shares.
5110.04s:  And I want to be able to add size if I have to if we start getting a rapid recovery.
5114.04s:  Premium would be 291.
5117.04s:  Lot size one.
5118.04s:  So quick update.
5119.04s:  We have 264 shares at 453.
5121.04s:  No change there.
5122.04s:  We're now sitting on two.
5125.04s:  Of the 18 know 358 puts at a 30 delta.
5130.04s:  And then we have one of the 18 know 397 calls out to 20 delta.
5135.04s:  So the stock price right now is 372.
5139.04s:  So from entry, the position would be down 21.
5143.04s:  So we have a 28% from a buy and hold perspective.
5148.04s:  And our trade is down 8.6%.
5154.04s:  And we are 95% utilize.
5156.04s:  So we essentially have all of the money out that we're going to have.
5160.04s:  We're not 100% utilize, but just about there.
5164.04s:  Now, one of the goals here is actually going to be to start unwinding some of the shares as we get a recovery.
5172.04s:  So that we can go back into just selling the puts.
5175.04s:  The reason why we're trying to sell the puts, especially with volus highs it is, is because we'll make more money.
5181.04s:  Then just holding it because we're not looking to sell the shares anyways.
5185.04s:  Lauren says when you say you need to find delta's for your portfolio, what does that mean?
5189.04s:  You're talking in a completely different context.
5191.04s:  Is that correct?
5192.04s:  Then what we're doing right now.
5194.04s:  I just want to make sure I'm understanding the frame that you're applying it from.
5198.04s:  And normally if we're talking about it in like the.
5203.04s:  Did I say that right now?
5209.04s:  I didn't say that right now. Did I learn?
5213.04s:  Maybe I did.
5215.04s:  I literally have to ask you guys.
5217.04s:  I'm fucking no.
5218.04s:  Well, anyways, normally when I say.
5223.04s:  Lauren says sorry, no, but you haven't I also wonder yeah, okay.
5226.04s:  So yeah, in a broader context, normally when I'll say it'll be attached to some kind of delta's.
5233.04s:  So normally I'll say something like I need long delta's.
5237.04s:  I need short delta's.
5238.04s:  I need some type of specific delta's.
5243.04s:  And the context behind that is I am looking for a specific kind of beta weighted delta's for the portfolio.
5253.04s:  So long delta short delta's.
5255.04s:  And it's to smooth out what I'm holding.
5258.04s:  All right, so stock is now at 394.
5261.04s:  We're going to close these short calls for 11 cents.
5264.04s:  So we made 280 bucks on those.
5266.04s:  It's about a 0.7% return on invested capital.
5271.04s:  Our total close call PNL at this point is 36.
5274.04s:  Hyundai so pretty good.
5279.04s:  Close that off.
5281.04s:  And now our puts should be fine.
5283.04s:  We're at the 358.
5284.04s:  So those will be essentially down for a penny.
5287.04s:  So minus 0.01.
5290.04s:  And again stock is at 394.
5294.04s:  Okay.
5295.04s:  And then we'll run a quick update and run a comparison of where these are at.
5302.04s:  This over here.
5305.04s:  So now it's going to be 18.22.
5308.04s:  Expiration we need to look at.
5311.04s:  Lauren, let me know if that answered your question is 16 Ds.
5314.04s:  You'll notice that I'm just defaulting to the nearest.
5320.04s:  Standard expiration.
5321.04s:  I'm actually not going out as far as I typically would.
5323.04s:  I would go out a little further than this.
5325.04s:  And we have pretty much a blank slate right now to work off of the current price again is 394.
5333.04s:  So by and hold perspective that position would be down 17.2%.
5338.04s:  Our position is currently down 8.86%.
5347.04s:  Total option PNL as it sits is 5,000.
5350.04s:  Total stock PNL right now is negative 15,000 625.
5357.04s:  And that's using again our total shares of 264 at a basis of 453.
5363.04s:  There's still zero change there and we'll look to to probably unwind some of those.
5369.04s:  Alright, so now let's get back in here 30 delta is 381.
5373.04s:  We're going to be at the 381.3 premium 5.29.
5379.04s:  We're going to keep this out of too lot because that's pretty lucrative.
5383.04s:  Short calls.
5386.04s:  We're still at 453.
5388.04s:  So we have to be much further out.
5390.04s:  We can use like these 413s.
5394.04s:  Break price 413 delta 0.21 premium 2.55.
5401.04s:  We'll do it one lot and let's get to expiration.
5409.04s:  So we're going to be able to get to the $1,500.
5414.04s:  Eventually just want to see how the year ends with this position.
5419.04s:  And it looks like it's ending with a bang.
5422.04s:  Oh, why does it say zero?
5426.04s:  What the fuck?
5428.04s:  Maybe go to the 15th.
5433.04s:  Why is it saying this?
5437.04s:  Sock is at 389.82.
5445.04s:  389.
5448.04s:  So what's around the money?
5452.04s:  Let's manage this.
5453.04s:  So 389.82.
5455.04s:  The calls will come off for a penny.
5460.04s:  Call it 389.
5464.04s:  We made another 254, which is about 0.6% on the short calls.
5472.04s:  And the puts are going to come down.
5474.04s:  381s.
5477.04s:  Oh, no, we're good.
5478.04s:  The puts will come down for 73 cents.
5484.04s:  And 389.
5488.04s:  So the stock while we were in it just went down like 1.3% not much.
5493.04s:  Okay.
5494.04s:  So now let's see where the position sits in total.
5502.04s:  We have 15 days.
5504.04s:  It's a day early just because it was being weird when I looked at it on the 16th.
5512.04s:  So stock at 384.
5516.04s:  No, I'm sorry, 389.
5518.04s:  But this point, the stock position is down 18.21%.
5524.04s:  And our position is down 9%.
5528.04s:  This is then probably struggling to find my house.
5534.04s:  Let me message them.
5548.04s:  Yeah, they're in the fucking wrong part of the neighborhood.
5556.04s:  We ended up doing, I'm going with some steak.
5576.04s:  Let's see if they're skills to get them through it.
5582.04s:  And so yeah, that's, I'll show you this form now because I think this is the cool part is with this strategy in executed in a completely dumb component.
5598.04s:  This strategy walks out down 9%.
5604.04s:  So definitely a down year.
5606.04s:  But it's literally down half of what a buy and hold equivalent would have been down.
5612.04s:  So that's the neat part about something like this.
5617.04s:  You can see that the total stock requirement out of this.
5623.04s:  Has secured amounts 119.
5627.04s:  So right now it's essentially all of it.
5629.04s:  But we have another 40% that we can put out via short puts, which is exactly what we'll do.
5637.04s:  So I'll make a video summarizing all of this because I think it's a really important topic for everybody.
5642.04s:  But yeah, just wanted to show you working through some of it together.
5646.04s:  I'm going to get ready to go grab my dinner.
5648.04s:  If you need anything, hit me up in the discord for the pro members.
5651.04s:  I'll see you on the patreon stream tomorrow for those that are not in there.
5655.04s:  Consider signing up.
5656.04s:  We'd like to get a little further into detail.
5659.04s:  And I really like to try to individual help people as much as I can.
5663.04s:  So that's the plan.
5665.04s:  All right, gang.
5666.04s:  I'll see you all be an outlier.
5667.04s:  Catch you later.
