0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market update.
2.80s: Got two things on the agenda for today.
4.36s: The first one is going to be Siri,
6.32s: and then the second one is going to be GameStop.
9.08s: So I got an email from Jacob,
14.04s: and they were essentially asking about
17.04s: some unusual options activity that they were hearing
21.84s: or coming across in Siri,
23.52s: and then their speculation, obviously,
25.40s: if it's roaring Kitty, that's one of the things I've definitely
27.72s: started to learn about the community is that as soon as anything even
31.60s: potentially related to something strange kind of immediately gets
36.44s: questioned whether or not it's roaring Kitty and rightfully so,
39.20s: because of the way that the dude operates.
41.96s: It doesn't surprise me whatsoever,
43.56s: and also because the way that the cat likes to kind of be mysterious, right?
50.04s: And that leads so much room for speculation.
53.56s: So I know some people get a little frustrated with other people when they're like,
56.84s: stop thinking it's roaring Kitty or whatever,
59.08s: but I would just say one, who knows,
63.00s: and two, it's kind of the way that the game goes,
67.08s: at least as far as I can tell.
68.20s: I still consider myself very new to the overall GME ape space.
73.52s: I'm learning more and more every day,
75.76s: but it doesn't surprise me,
77.56s: especially when you realize that most of
80.44s: roaring Kitty's communication modalities are super vague, right?
83.84s: It'll be a string of emojis from a missy Elliott video.
89.36s: I can't even say it seriously.
91.28s: It's so crazy.
93.12s: Meanwhile, this dude is like a billionaire.
95.44s: So hilarious, but anyways, it doesn't surprise me.
99.16s: So let's start with taking a quick look at Siri.
101.76s: There's a ton, a ton of focus on this for a bunch of different reasons.
105.84s: I think it's becoming tangentially related because of the emojis and people
109.84s: are interpreting them, some of them to mean Siri.
113.04s: And again, who knows?
114.32s: But the real big idea right now in Siri is
118.64s: the holding company Liberty is going through a giant, giant, giant
123.28s: reorg in terms of the way that it's holding its various assets.
127.92s: So there's kind of a quasi merger coming up.
131.44s: I wouldn't even really call it a merger because
134.16s: Sirius XM is already there,
136.00s: but it's just held in different kinds of share classes.
139.84s: And they're just looking to join them.
141.12s: But there's a discrepancy between those two values.
143.84s: So there is a little bit of a merger arbitrage opportunity,
146.80s: which I'm very careful to frame it as merger arbitrage,
149.92s: because standard arbitrage is when you have the opportunity to trade the same
154.80s: product on two different exchanges simultaneously
157.68s: to take advantage of a price discrepancy, which is not the case here.
161.76s: This is essentially taking advantage of a price discrepancy
165.28s: between two holding valuations of the same asset,
168.88s: but the risk profile is different because the deal essentially a
172.72s: structured could not go through.
173.92s: There could be changes.
174.96s: The timeline could change.
176.16s: One company could completely change the way it's doing business.
178.48s: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
179.44s: So it's just important to know that there's a slight difference
182.08s: in the way that those kinds of trades would flow through.
185.68s: So anyways, that's kind of what we're waiting to see.
188.64s: And Warren Buffett's even playing the move.
190.48s: So it is interesting.
191.84s: Now, when we take a look at the options flow in Siri,
195.84s: it is interesting in that there's a couple bigger trades, but the very first
200.00s: thing that comes to my mind is even though over the last couple days,
204.64s: there was a 10,000 block that went through for the eight 20s.
210.72s: Like there's a lot of activity at this three and a half call handle.
215.12s: And it's going to be very difficult to fully differentiate who is who,
220.16s: but all of this is small trades.
222.72s: So does that mean that the cat could be in here?
225.44s: He absolutely could be, especially because we know a bunch of his money is tied up right now
229.12s: in Chewie.
230.08s: So he doesn't necessarily have the same pile of cash that he typically does
233.84s: to play options like I've seen him before as I went through the rest of his profile on Reddit
239.20s: to get a sense of what kind of positions he puts on, what his preferences are.
242.48s: But when I look at this, the three and a halfs kind of do make sense.
246.64s: They would be close to at the money.
248.72s: The duration would make sense based on what I've seen him do before.
252.00s: It's about a month is it seems what he likes to get into.
254.40s: So yeah, overall this does look generally interesting to me for him, but I don't see any other
262.56s: like truly conclusive evidence that it would be him versus just somebody else playing something
268.32s: because again, like these aren't large sums of money.
271.36s: So yeah, it's as always it's hard to say.
275.12s: And unless we have somebody like Roy and Kitty that kind of comes forward and simply says,
278.96s: yeah, yeah, well, here's my next yolo update.
281.76s: It would make a lot of sense.
282.72s: But I think the other thing is a lot of people are kind of, I don't know,
285.84s: starting to feel like he's shifting around a lot because we all thought originally like
290.32s: super game stop focused.
291.36s: Then there is a slight pivot to Chewie, whether that's temporary permanent, nobody knows.
295.52s: I probably guess more towards temporary based on his background, but it does show movement
302.16s: between assets. So then it wouldn't be a far cry to see him start tinkering with other assets
306.56s: again, but don't know, do not know.
310.72s: So it's something that I'll keep an eye on for sure to see if, you know, I can come up with
314.88s: any ideas for it, but nothing nothing's jumping out at me just yet.
318.96s: So the other thing I wanted to talk about quickly is game stop.
322.96s: And it's really to maintain the cadence.
325.28s: I kind of committed to you guys that I was going to continue looking at this thing at least,
328.64s: I don't know until I actually didn't beg at the end date.
332.48s: So I'm just kind of doing it, but there's not a whole lot to report today as far as I can tell.
339.20s: So there's a lot of really interesting theories going around.
342.56s: And I think Newton's video is really good if you guys haven't seen that, I'm sure you have.
347.92s: But if you haven't, you should check it out because he's talking a little bit more about,
351.04s: you know, the qualitative background.
353.12s: And you know, like I typically say, I'm a trader.
356.08s: So I'm looking at the elements I can trade.
358.32s: I'm learning about the story from a curiosity perspective.
362.00s: But I can tell you from just an information digestion standpoint, I've seen enough people come
367.52s: up with what they think is going to happen.
369.04s: And I've honestly not seen a whole lot of them fully come to fruition, different elements of
373.76s: the theories I've seen come to fruition.
375.68s: So all of that is to say, I'm waiting until the one thing I know is going to happen before it
380.56s: moves, which is volume. Like I know that I know volume will move before it moves.
384.96s: So that's what I'm keeping an eyeball on.
387.52s: So right now volume is just very, very muted.
390.80s: The other thing I want to continue
392.96s: blaboring though is that we have earnings coming up on four September.
396.72s: Every time I look at this, I'm waiting for this earning cycle to start jacking up and
401.84s: implied volatility. And it is now just starting to tick up by one point, not moving.
408.72s: It's not moving much at all, which is fascinating to me.
412.08s: Now open interest is still continuing to expand both the call and the put side.
417.52s: And if we look at the volume today in exceedingly light day, 63,000 calls again,
423.60s: 17,000 puts. This is one of the quietest days.
427.12s: I think I've seen in GME. The activity is centralized in the front to expiration cycles for the volume
432.96s: today. So that is a quick update on what I'm seeing. As always, I would love taking a look at
439.20s: anything you guys want to take a look at. We will do a GME live stream specific on Saturday.
444.00s: Yet again, going to keep that cadence going so that we can dig in deeper and deeper,
447.76s: learn more about the product as you can tell. I'm very interested to do that.
451.36s: So whatever you guys want to look at during that, also let me know. Be an outlier. See you guys later.
