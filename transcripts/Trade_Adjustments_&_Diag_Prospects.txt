0.72s: hey everyone eric here uh want to do a
3.04s: small stacks update
4.40s: i made a couple trades in the current
6.32s: diagonals that i have on
7.84s: and then i am analyzing another
10.40s: potential call
11.44s: diagonal uh somebody was mentioning that
13.52s: they were you know essentially hoping
15.04s: that i could
16.32s: share real time like when i'm analyzing
18.72s: a trade so that's what i'm doing
20.40s: in the in the trade i'm gonna go through
22.00s: with you guys today walk through some of
23.52s: it i didn't put it on yet i'm gonna
25.12s: watch it
26.00s: um but i intend to put it on when i see
27.92s: that the conditions are right
29.52s: and then i have some hot air balloons
31.76s: that are going up right now so
33.76s: i'll show you that real quick well that
36.24s: was a big bummer
37.04s: uh the camera wouldn't focus so sorry
38.88s: you don't get to see the hot air
39.92s: balloons
40.72s: but trust me they're dope um so let's go
43.28s: over to the
44.32s: main screen real quick this is small
46.24s: stacks part 12.
47.76s: so i didn't write it in because i'm lazy
50.72s: and i just copy and pasted everything so
53.12s: this is what we're looking at in the
54.40s: portfolio right now uh utilization is
58.68s: 22.63 so we're still
60.80s: under 40 percent utilized total p l is
63.60s: now at 757
65.20s: so that represents just over 13 percent
67.92s: return
68.48s: since kicking this off on one september
71.60s: credit outstanding right now is 182
74.40s: which represents a
75.56s: 3.16 return on the portfolio
78.48s: everything's looking healthy we're not
79.92s: super utilized right now so we still
81.60s: have room to add positions on which is
83.52s: exactly what i want to talk about
85.44s: um okay so next up is some of the
88.72s: adjustments
90.32s: that i made first off
93.60s: in ford the
96.64s: 9 october obviously put that trade on
99.52s: today
100.56s: um but i sold one more of these seven
104.72s: calls expiring 30 october which is right
107.60s: after their earnings
109.04s: and i collected 58 cents on that the
111.04s: reason why i did that
112.08s: is i have three long call options right
115.12s: now
116.24s: and now i have three uh short calls
119.76s: against it
120.72s: and the reason why i did that is when i
123.12s: looked at the risk profile
125.60s: i generally like to keep the leap
128.24s: uncovered which i did for a while
130.48s: but now that i see ford kind of making a
132.56s: move up
134.00s: i perceive more room to the downside
137.44s: at this point so by adding that
140.48s: final short call to essentia
143.60s: to essentially collect that premium up
146.24s: front
147.12s: if ford stays essentially where it's
150.16s: at or if it goes up about 20 more cents
153.12s: i will make
154.24s: more money with the three short calls as
157.44s: compared to the just
158.56s: two short calls now where that will
161.76s: start to change is if it goes
163.28s: up over 20 cents additional from where
166.00s: it's at right now
167.84s: is when i would have made more money
170.48s: with the two short calls as compared to
172.56s: the three
173.12s: so right now based on my assumption i'm
175.68s: expecting a little more
176.88s: downside movement especially with
178.48s: earnings coming up
180.24s: that's why i put that additional call on
182.64s: collect that money up front because
184.40s: i think that there's a higher propensity
187.04s: for it to stay where it's at or maybe
188.48s: even go down a little bit as compared to
190.48s: increase greater than 20 cents so we'll
193.44s: see what happens
194.24s: but that is just why i made that
196.24s: adjustment
197.36s: the other adjustment i made was really
199.36s: easy it was actually the day after i did
201.12s: the last update
202.64s: and i think the last time we did was 6
205.04s: october so
206.00s: on the 7th of october in kroger
209.44s: i sold the six nov
212.80s: 35 um 35.5
217.28s: short call so that took this to a one to
219.60s: one ratio as well
221.84s: except um it was a really really simple
226.24s: trade
227.20s: i ended up taking it down very very
229.60s: shortly thereafter
231.60s: sorry i just realized i misspoke because
234.00s: i'm changing the dates down there for
235.20s: when i took it off so
236.80s: this was on last time we spoke that
238.56s: second call and this
240.00s: was taken down on the 7th of october
242.48s: which is the day after
243.92s: uh the last video and i took these down
246.56s: for
247.04s: 58 cents so that realized
251.04s: um 75 p l which is a five point five
254.16s: three percent return on invested capital
256.16s: essentially that was an easy decision
258.24s: for me because
259.76s: i was getting very very i was already
262.88s: over 50
263.68s: max profit pretty early into the trade
266.24s: and most importantly
267.68s: by doing this i uncovered
271.36s: the max potential gain on kroger again
274.40s: so
274.80s: i will continue to do this same exact
276.88s: system where
278.16s: i'll either allow it to move up until i
280.48s: perceive more downside risk then add
282.32s: that short call to collect
283.68s: more money um sometimes i move the
286.16s: strike a little further out it kind of
287.92s: just depends on the scenario but as of
289.76s: right now
290.88s: um we're gonna i left it with just the
294.24s: six no 355 call so it's uncovered and
297.36s: that's because that trade
298.96s: is still um not
302.32s: it's it's about at par as you could tell
304.48s: from the
305.44s: the other trade that i took down okay
308.64s: so now kind of the the more important
311.04s: part i want to talk to you
312.56s: about intel so i
316.08s: am eyeing a call diagonal in here
319.28s: i really want some tech exposure which
322.48s: in the small stacks right now i have
324.08s: very little and
326.24s: by very little it's essentially only if
328.00s: i i play smaller products like zynga
330.80s: so right now what i'm eager to do
334.64s: is keep an eye on intel i like them
338.08s: at large i've liked them for a long time
340.24s: i've been trading them in my margin
341.68s: portfolio very frequently
343.84s: and as of right now it's a little bit of
346.40s: a too far run up for me it's not a good
348.40s: entry just yet
349.76s: i want to see a little bit more of a
351.52s: pullback but
353.12s: seeing it already starting to cross
354.56s: above the 50-day approaching the
356.72s: 200 moving day average like those are
358.48s: very bullish symbols to me
360.88s: so i'm i'm actually hoping for a little
362.96s: bit of a pullback closer to the 48
365.04s: handle
365.76s: so that i can look at an entry what i
367.52s: was eyeing as of right now
370.00s: was taking a look at the 18 june 21
373.28s: 40s and this would only be a one lot
376.88s: i i wouldn't want to offer more than
379.92s: than one
380.64s: in this position just to avoid
382.72s: oversizing the account
384.88s: and that would tie up around
388.80s: 1400 bucks essentially you can call it
390.88s: 1400 bucks
392.32s: so that would be a little oversized
394.96s: compared to
396.24s: a couple of the others it would put it
398.32s: about on par with kroger
400.24s: and then ford would be the smallest of
402.00s: the pack but in general i would be okay
404.88s: with that with that risk profile so
408.24s: we're gonna see how it reacts especially
410.72s: as it moves closer to earnings
412.88s: um if i see an opportunity to get into
416.16s: these like i said when until it looks
417.92s: like it's a little closer to the 48
419.28s: handle i would be interested
420.96s: but until that point i will probably
423.76s: stay hands off
425.36s: because with the small stacks portfolio
428.24s: it's very
429.04s: intolerant of periodic moves where i
433.20s: would have to sit and wait
434.80s: and in comparison in my margin account
437.04s: if i wanted to put a trade on this
438.40s: because i liked it i would just put on a
440.00s: partial position right now
441.52s: maybe a third of the overall position
443.52s: and then continue to add into it as it
445.92s: goes
446.56s: because that allows me to capture upside
448.48s: if it occurs but then
450.88s: add and scale into the position as it
452.48s: goes down obviously
454.32s: in the small stacks portfolio that
456.32s: strategy doesn't work which is
457.92s: the reason why we have this segment to
460.48s: look at a different way of trading a
461.84s: portfolio
462.96s: so overall that wraps up where we're at
466.24s: on the small stacks portfolio still
468.80s: cruising right along
469.84s: happy primarily happy honestly with the
473.36s: utilization i'm really really stoked
475.84s: that
477.28s: were returning very well without
479.28s: redlining the account
480.72s: which is important to me so i'm going to
483.36s: continue
484.00s: eyeing other opportunities financials is
486.88s: also
487.60s: on the docket something like a bank of
489.76s: america i've traded them a lot it's a
491.92s: cheaper product for financials
494.08s: that's another that's another tool that
496.64s: i'll keep an
497.36s: eye on but right now i just don't feel
500.56s: super warm and fuzzy about banks with
502.24s: interest rates being held where they're
503.76s: at which is why i'm not prioritizing
505.68s: financials
506.40s: over tech right now i think tech is
509.76s: um definitely looking better as you
511.84s: could tell us the same reason why i
513.04s: picked kroger
514.16s: i think things like that in the middle
516.56s: of the pandemic
518.64s: um would perform well and then the other
522.16s: thing
522.80s: obviously is ford that's a longer term
526.08s: kind of coveted play because i do think
527.76s: that it's still a strong company
529.28s: it's had a significant pullback so
532.56s: we'll we'll see also where that winds up
534.88s: but so far
535.84s: um ford's also looking good for me in
539.28s: the meantime i will uh always cover
541.84s: whatever you guys want me to anything
543.20s: that you want me to talk about let me
544.24s: know
544.80s: and uh we'll catch everybody later
