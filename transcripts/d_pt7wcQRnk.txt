0.00s: What's up, outliers? We're on the mobile setup today and I open up the platform and
5.84s: GameStop rallies 6.34%. So a really, really big day and I want to talk about it for
12.76s: a few different reasons. The first thing I want to talk about is shout out to Benzenga
17.80s: here who's talking about some homies taking a bearish sentiment towards GameStop. We'll
24.40s: talk about that. I see what they're talking about. Really a series of larger transactions
29.64s: here, but I think that they're missing a lot of other pieces that are worth talking
35.56s: about. So the overall story narrative here is a little bit interesting. So take a look
42.32s: at the candle. It had very little down tick and then it almost cracked above. I mean,
48.76s: we are so close to cracking above 30. If I zoom this out to a one-year daily, you can
53.64s: see that we are just below that 30 handle, which is we talked about before. It's kind of
58.16s: like the next area of resistance, at least as far as I see it. These kinds of candles are
63.40s: interesting. And again, I'm not super big into candlestick analysis beyond trying to
67.52s: use it to infer what the market is doing on the back end. And what this means is take a
72.20s: look at the volume bar for today. It was essentially all by volume. So I'm looking at 12.9 million
80.76s: shares traded. And 6% of that was sale volume with 94% as buy volume. So this is actually
90.24s: way, way, way busier than I would have expected leading into earnings like this kind of move.
96.44s: I genuinely was expecting it definitely to be in the 30 like this range that I defined.
101.44s: I think we talked about this on the recent live stream, but I didn't expect it to be
105.04s: this sec of a move. I thought that it would be kind of more days like this, more days like
110.96s: this, more days like this, more kind of like inside days that are continuing to grind and
115.68s: follow this trend. But that's not what was in mind here. So the high we hit again, I mean,
121.96s: we're just a few pennies off, which is pretty impressive. The fact that this is also done
126.32s: on really big volume is important. Now, if we take a look, I think you can see it, yeah,
130.28s: you can see it down here on the oscillators. The oscillators aren't even tighter yet. So this
134.60s: is using a RSI that has a 7-day VWOP moving average. And they're hovering, I mean, just
142.48s: at really healthy levels, it is depending on whether you use 80, 20 setup or 70, 30. I kind
148.96s: of prefer 80, 20 just because it really emphasizes extremes a bit more, but some that are a little
155.88s: more conservative will use stuff like 70, 30, but you'll spend a lot of time above 70. So
161.92s: and that's, I mean, really case in point here. Now, the moving averages are expanding in
167.12s: terms of width, which means that we're seeing overall volume on the buy side expand. Now,
174.40s: what I am eager to see is this moving average here, which is a longer term moving average.
180.56s: This one is 120 day moving average. And it's not yet upward sloping. It's kind of taken
188.72s: its time, which is a little interesting to me because we have the 10, the 20, the 50 here,
194.24s: and then this one is like a six month of 120. You'd use 120, 150. Whatever it was you're
198.88s: about actually let's flip this real quick to a 150. I just want to see what it looks like. This is
202.80s: 150 is a little more widely used than 120. So I'm wondering what that's looking like. Let's see.
210.48s: Okay. So yeah, this kind of captures a little bit more of this move better because it's
215.44s: gathering a little bit more the longer term breadth. So really all we need is this last moving
219.76s: average to pop above that 150. And we have a little bit of like strong alignment and continuation
227.68s: of the moving averages, which is cool to see. We still are coming into earnings, which is on the
233.28s: fourth of December right now after the close. We'll see if it remains there. And I mean, the move
241.52s: here is nothing to scoff at. And I think what I'm looking for now is how does it behave around the
249.92s: 30 handle? And the reason why I care about that is because when I look for support and resistance
255.28s: between kind of 35 and 30, it's super light. So this area that it's building in now is hands down
263.04s: the breadth of trading volume for the last six month period. And then even if we move out to the
267.52s: last year, you can see. So the cool thing is we're seeing the bulk of trading volume sliding up
274.96s: and up and up. So that means that again, the value of the stock is being considered by more people.
283.04s: Now, the overall strength of the trend, I think, is at risk here. If we get another couple big
289.44s: continuation days, obviously, then it looks like a continuation. But this also looks like it can roll
296.00s: over in trend sideways into earnings, right? So we can see this upper trend. It hits kind of that
301.68s: 30-ish handle very close on the 20th. And then it's been rolling sideways a bit, big up day closing
308.24s: near the highs, which is good. So possibility for a continuation is not small. I think that it's
315.28s: pretty fair as I see it here. But it also tends again, we tend to see slightly more mellow movement
322.24s: coming into earnings, although we already talked about we looked at the probabilities. What was it?
326.96s: On the live stream two days ago, and the probabilities are really, really strong for a healthy move. So
333.36s: and it was up to like 35, I think, if I'm not mistaken. So let's take a look now at the options
338.24s: chain and see what happened today. So we had 210 closing calls trading in 29,000 puts and the
344.56s: overwhelming majority of those calls around the buy side. So this is people building to the
350.24s: long side. And that's why that benzenga thing I had it up in the beginning. I thought it was kind
353.84s: of cute. They they were talking about a couple, you know, different positions that people were
360.24s: building. But I could just tell from the underlying activity today and then the overall options
366.40s: volume that I took peak at that there's way more bullish position going on here, like light years
371.44s: more bullish positioning. And if you take a look at the majority of the puts, they're on the sell side.
375.76s: So there are definitely people buying puts. Why wouldn't there be? It's starting to get in your highs,
379.76s: but it's a really small subset of the overall volume that we see. Now let's take a look at where
384.72s: the volume was. This is interesting. This is really interesting because we broke out of all of
393.60s: the volume being in the front expirations. And now it looks like we're back in the front
399.04s: expirations. The majority of the volume here is in 29,000 in six days. And those are two non-standard
407.20s: expirations. Although 60s does capture earnings. So I would expect to see 60s to be
414.64s: a little more active just simply from the fact that it has earnings. So this is interesting to me.
420.16s: Now let's take a look at two more things. I want to look at the open interest. We're still bulk
425.20s: out in 17, Jan 25. So there's longer positions that we've talked about plenty of times now.
429.60s: The other thing I want to take a look at is changes in OI for these individual
436.72s: expirations cycles. So take a look at this. This is all build out. All of this green,
441.76s: I'm tracking. It's a custom thingscript that I've built. And I'm tracking the change in open
447.52s: interest from yesterday into today. And then today this is going to go up again because there's 31,000
456.32s: calls at the 30 handle expiring 29. And there was only 25,000 open interest. So that tells us that
464.72s: least 6,000 of these are going to be added onto this, which is again, people really, really
470.40s: bullishly positioning. It looks like people are expecting this move to heat up a little bit.
475.92s: I'm interested in that theory. Maybe you guys know a little bit more about it than I do. I would
480.56s: love to learn about it because with earnings coming up, normally companies will be a little more
486.08s: mellow into earnings. So if this were me, I wouldn't be yolowing into the 29, no expiration.
492.64s: Unless again, I'm like supremely convicted that there's something expected here. So I don't know
497.68s: if there's something from like the emoji timeline that you guys know about or if there's some other
501.60s: confidence that people are expecting to hit sometime this week. Again, I'm traveling. So I haven't
508.48s: been as close to the news. So you guys will have to keep me up to speed. So let's take a look at
514.56s: 6Ds. This is mostly build out much smaller though, right? Take a look at the OI change here at the 30s.
520.80s: It's 342. Take a look at the change at the 30s here. It's 2,522 with another 31,000 traded today.
528.88s: So these are people playing the front expiration hard, really, really hard. Same thing out here.
533.68s: We're not seeing anywhere near the same amount of build out further out in time. So it looks like
537.68s: we're back to the good old play the front move here, which is always interesting to see. Now,
543.12s: last thing I want to take a look at quick is I guess we'll just zoom this in all the way. And let's
548.72s: take a look and see if there's any interesting options transactions that have happened today in
554.72s: GameStop. So let's go today and we'll keep the mid as well. And I'm going to keep the puts off.
562.08s: Let's just eyeball this shall we? Okay. I don't see a lot that's like jumping out at me is crazy.
580.80s: There definitely are some decent sized trades, but these are like pretty small relative to what
584.96s: we typically see, right? 154,000, 155, 150, those are all relatively small trades. Let's take a look
591.60s: at the put side real quick, just see if there's any big put transactions. No, so relatively quiet
597.68s: on the options front. Now, what that tells me is that most of what we're seeing from the options
602.32s: trade side of things is that they're just a bunch of different people playing a bunch of
608.48s: different size positions. So there's not like these really big trade buildings. So really,
613.28s: really interesting to see this moving GameStop is always if you guys have any information as to
618.56s: why this week, why it looks like 29 noves piping up. I'd love to hear about it because yeah,
624.00s: normally days that have quiet market periods like Thanksgiving, these weeks generally tend to be
629.12s: a little bit more quiet, but is preusual GameStop tends to buck the trend. So let me know what you
634.72s: think's going on and then also how we're positioning into earnings because that's another thing that's
639.76s: coming up real soon. Let me know if you need anything. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
