0.20s: how I would start investing No Frills no
3.04s:  this is a video precipitated by
6.24s: one of my friends that I went to officer
8.60s: candidate school back in 2012 with he
10.72s: reached out with this exact question and
13.00s: I want to make a supplementation video
14.68s: for him and for other people because I
17.48s: know others have this question so let's
20.20s: get straight into this thing very first
22.88s: off we have what happened here well this
25.64s: is it and overall this is just my buddy
28.24s: reaching out saying Hey I'm curious at
31.16s: what to do with my money because he
33.16s: makes really great money now which is
34.84s: awesome but he acknowledges that his
37.52s: investment knowledge is not right and
39.80s: he's looking to get educated which is
42.00s: awesome it's exactly why I do this so I
44.80s: referred him to this blog post right
47.84s: here and it is a big post that runs
52.92s: through literally if you know nothing it
56.00s: teaches you why investing and a lot of
59.96s: mentation on how to go from nothing to
63.92s: actually opening up a brokerage account
65.92s: and being able to put on a Buy and Hold
67.72s: position but I wanted to color in some
70.96s: of the shaded areas for him and hence
74.72s: let's get straight to it so the very
76.80s: first thing I would advise myself if I
79.40s: were to start investing is to start with
81.12s: goals and I refer to this all the time
84.20s: it's from Steven K's Seven Habits of
86.96s: Highly Successful People and this is
88.92s: begin with the end of in mind this is
90.92s: super important because depending on
92.56s: what your objectives are you have to
95.48s: behave differently so what I would do is
99.16s: outline a 20-year 10year 5-year one-year
103.00s: goal that is specific measurable
106.32s: achievable in time bound so the idea
109.52s: here is right out of the gate we are
111.76s: outlining for ourselves what we want to
114.20s: accomplish so in 20 years I want to be
116.64s: fully retired in 10 years I want to see
120.28s: clear progress that within the next 10
122.76s: years I will be at my Benchmark over the
125.88s: next 5 years I want to create this
127.64s: supplementation skill set income streams
131.24s: those kinds of things and then over the
132.84s: course of this year I want to start
134.52s: investing I'm going to save X number of
136.48s: dollars per month that sort of thing so
139.76s: once we have our goals outlined we need
142.00s: to assess our savings and we need to
144.52s: save more aggressively than where you're
146.16s: at even right then and it's a guarantee
149.28s: because no no matter what the earlier
151.96s: you start saving and prioritizing that
155.36s: the earlier you get to this fabled early
158.20s: retirement that you then don't have to
160.20s: worry about money ever again and you can
162.56s: start buying things that you want
164.52s: without worrying about if it's on sale
166.44s: or using coupons you get to stop
169.12s: worrying about money the way you get
171.08s: there is by sacrificing near term
174.56s: outcomes so yes you might not be able to
177.56s: go to the club three nights a week and
179.36s: spend $1,000 a week trying to do that
182.80s: but if you give that up UPF front and
186.00s: embrace delayed gratification you can
188.60s: start achieving much more interesting
191.76s: outcomes so for here if you were just
194.92s: saving let's say you had $100 a month
197.52s: for 30 years that gives you
199.60s: $36,000 however if you have that same
201.72s: $100 you're saving that $100 per month
204.80s: over the course of 30 years if it was
206.80s: invested is
208.32s: $200,000 this is is exactly the point
211.80s: I'm trying to help Express to people
214.04s: that saving is a giant amplifier for
219.12s: investing so to recap these two outline
222.44s: what you want start saving and get
225.08s: religious about it it should be
227.28s: automatic every single month the worst
229.44s: thing you could do is say oh I only have
231.64s: $50 so it's not worth saving that I'll
234.72s: wait until I have more and then save
236.88s: that's probably the worst possible
238.64s: Behavior you could have because is then
240.48s: something always comes up there's never
242.20s: a great time to move a bunch of money
244.04s: away so you just put what you can and
248.20s: keep doing that automatically without
250.80s: fail that will get you much further than
253.12s: like waiting for an amount that you
255.40s: think is good now you're going to need a
257.60s: plan for the Traders which is one of the
261.56s: paths we're going to be talking about in
263.44s: a minute for the Traders this will be
265.60s: your trading plan if you are just an
268.36s: investor that you want to get into to
269.88s: buy and hold and not mess with any of
271.76s: this other stuff that's totally cool and
273.28s: for most people that's smarter because
275.88s: most Traders don't make it so if you're
278.16s: going to go down the passive route you
280.72s: still need what I would refer to as a
282.84s: wealth development plan and this is a
285.16s: place for you to outline your goals your
288.04s: savings protocols because writing these
290.60s: things out one makes them more powerful
293.04s: two allows you to test different things
296.24s: so that you can maybe try in your
299.68s: investing portfolio maybe you try
301.60s: rebalancing it every 6 months but then
304.08s: you test trying it every quarter and you
306.40s: can see the outcomes there so this gives
308.80s: you some structure on what you're
310.80s: looking to do and if you are part of the
314.20s: patreon you get this trading plan
316.36s: template for free you can go download it
318.28s: at any point if you're silver or above
320.56s: and if you're not you can check out this
322.68s: video in the notes below that walks
325.08s: through this exact Concept in detail so
328.08s: that you can just make your own as we
330.16s: move through the video together but you
333.04s: need the plan whether you're going to
334.76s: actively trade or not and again that
337.40s: leads us to kind of these two different
339.04s: paths and I just want to talk about the
340.52s: difference between them for most people
342.56s: passive investing Buy and Hold investing
344.76s: is going to be a better route because
347.08s: you really get to capture most of the
350.32s: benefit right that 8020 rule you could
352.60s: put in a very little amount of effort
354.52s: and capture the majority of the benefits
357.60s: of investing in the stock market you
359.80s: also get better tax treatment if you're
362.12s: holding products for longer than a year
364.36s: the whole idea of actively trading is
367.60s: really for two or three purposes as far
370.12s: as I can see it the first purpose is to
372.20s: outperform the stock market and the
374.20s: reason why that matters is I will show
376.52s: you this right here if we go to this
379.48s: compound interest calculator on my
381.12s: website which is totally free we can use
383.12s: the standard amounts here and let's just
385.32s: say you're saving that extra $100 a
386.92s: month let's just put this out to 20
388.32s: years okay so now let's say that the
390.48s: stock market is somewhere between 7 and
392.40s: 12% so we'll leave it at 10% this is
395.64s: your return if let's just say you're buy
398.20s: and holding at this rate with the
399.96s: savings however if you are able let's
403.20s: say to add 5% on top of that notice this
408.68s: kind of blue line with the triangles all
411.12s: of a sudden you would go from that
414.96s: $102,000 to $25,000
419.96s: that's if you are able to return 15%
422.64s: versus 10% so the whole idea here is if
425.80s: you are an active Trader the first goal
427.64s: is to outperform the market the second
429.76s: goal could be for income you can trade
433.00s: different styles to generate monthly
435.80s: quarterly income or you can trade to
439.24s: reduce portfolio variance but that's not
442.76s: really a great approach in my opinion if
445.04s: you're going to trade it should probably
446.64s: be at least if it were me for one of
448.72s: those two reasons that that I mentioned
449.96s: in the beginning so let's talk about the
451.76s: environment real quick we already know
453.44s: why we're investing we're going to take
455.00s: a risk for a return When you put money
457.36s: in the stock market you are committing
459.76s: Capital which is at risk it can decline
463.00s: in value or even go to zero but we're
465.48s: doing that for the sake of a return so
467.88s: when we think about the stock market if
469.84s: you are brand new this is really all you
472.60s: need to know is that there are different
475.52s: Securities that make up the stock market
477.80s: these are just the products you can
479.52s: trade and there are things called
481.24s: equities derivatives and debt debt is
484.76s: exactly what you're used to hearing
486.12s: these are your bonds that you can access
489.08s: derivatives are things like options and
490.68s: Futures I primarily trade options so I
493.00s: operate here a lot and then equities
495.36s: these are things like individual stocks
499.16s: so if we take a look at this this is the
501.44s: stock market these are all of the
503.48s: different kind of products that you can
505.00s: trade you might notice some of these
506.68s: names like this one AAPL that's Apple
509.52s: you probably have heard the term the S&P
511.68s: 500 that is this product here and these
514.80s: are all of the things that are within
516.76s: the S&P 500 like Microsoft Apple it's a
519.96s: bunch of different stocks that are put
521.64s: together that's called an index and
524.08s: there are things called exchange traded
526.36s: funds ETFs that essentially allow you to
529.84s: trade this index so if you buy something
533.48s: called spy Spy you gain exposure to all
539.20s: of of these different things in that one
541.52s: product which makes it very efficient
543.12s: which we'll get into a little bit later
544.96s: now how do you do all of this well you
547.12s: need a broker so if we take a look now
551.20s: and you just throw into Google online
553.88s: brokerage you can see all of these
556.36s: different Brokers that pop up if it were
558.60s: me I would direct myself towards
561.12s: interactive brokers TDM trade eade
564.48s: Schwab one of those I personally use TDM
568.16s: trade and part of that is because of
570.04s: luck it is what I happened to pick when
572.80s: I started trading back in 2007 and I
575.80s: like them so I stay with them but you
577.72s: can pick any of these major Brokers I
580.20s: would avoid places like Robin Hood
582.28s: they're not really a great broker
584.60s: specifically for active Traders for
586.72s: Passive Traders it doesn't really matter
588.20s: as much kind of pick whatever makes you
590.56s: happy but the broker is what gives you
593.48s: access to the stock market so that you
595.44s: can then start taking a look at these
597.08s: different things so now let's get into
600.08s: kind of the rest of this thing if you
602.24s: are going to invest which is kind of
604.44s: worth thinking about holding things long
606.24s: term longer than a year or trade which
608.92s: is when we're buying and selling within
611.40s: a year you're I would start with Buy and
613.96s: Hold it's the same thing for both the
616.24s: reason why I would start with Buy and
617.56s: Hold is because if you're going to be an
619.76s: investor well this is all you're going
622.24s: to do going forward and if you look at
625.20s: something like a Buy and Hold portfolio
627.72s: this is from portfolio visual visualizer
629.92s: decom if you are looking to invest this
632.28s: is a great place to check out I'm not
633.96s: affiliated with them at all they just
635.32s: have a great product so you can go to
636.92s: back test portfolio and you can change
639.24s: this time frame to whatever you want you
640.88s: can drop in all the different symbols
642.60s: that you want to take a look at and you
644.40s: can see how they perform so what I did
647.20s: here is give you a few different things
648.88s: to look at this blue line which is
652.04s: portfolio 2 is 50% iwm and 50% QQQ these
658.36s: are two index ETFs this is the Russell
662.32s: 2000 and this is the NASDAQ so if you
665.76s: take a look at this and we look at the
668.40s: NASDAQ 100 this is QQQ so you're getting
672.32s: exposure to all of these and when I'm
674.80s: talking about iwm this is 2,000 small
677.76s: cap stocks you are gaining exposure to
680.28s: all of these so that's one portfolio
682.88s: another idea here is 60% spy which you
686.96s: know what that is already and 40% % TLT
690.28s: which is 20year US government bonds and
692.96s: you can take a look at what the final
694.92s: balance is between these what the
696.84s: compound annual growth rate is and if
699.48s: you notice compared to the S&P 500 by
702.28s: itself if you do something as simple as
704.92s: iwm and QQQ you outperform it modestly
708.92s: now you can take a look at the worst
710.52s: year to see if you're comfortable with
712.80s: the draw down that you might have the
714.92s: Max draw down is the lowest it gets at a
716.88s: certain point in time but the cool part
718.68s: about this kind of product is you can
719.96s: get an idea of how different things work
722.56s: and if you are a Buy and Hold investor
724.76s: again if it were me I would literally
727.44s: just pick spy and every single month put
731.36s: more money into your brokerage account
733.92s: so that I could buy more shares of spy
737.68s: and just do that into perpetuity because
741.08s: if you take a look at this for the
743.56s: period that we're looking at which is
744.84s: 2010 all the way through current date
747.20s: 2023 if you have a
750.04s: 12.12% compound annual growth rate well
753.20s: let's come back to this let's say let's
755.80s: get rid of that and let's instead look
758.76s: at if we have that 12% compound annual
762.60s: growth rate and what that can do for you
764.92s: specifically if you get more serious
767.08s: about saving which is that thing I kind
768.88s: of reminded you in the beginning so
771.28s: instead of $100 let's say you could do
773.16s: $500 a month well now in 20 years you
775.76s: essentially have half a millionar that's
777.88s: starting with just 5 grand and let's say
780.52s: you get better at saving or let's say
782.72s: over the time span your average monthly
785.48s: contributions grows because your income
787.64s: is growing and let's say you could do
789.48s: $1,000 not in the beginning but over
791.88s: this 20-year period that becomes your
793.60s: average well now you're a millionaire
795.64s: done and done starting with $5,000 at
798.08s: the average stock market return that is
800.60s: the beauty of investing so in this case
803.84s: you can Tinker with different things
805.60s: find what you like but this is just to
807.64s: give you some ideas on where you can
808.76s: start now for the people that are
811.84s: trading it's a little bit different
813.32s: because investors from here they just
814.92s: have to monitor save buy more on a
817.80s: regular Cadence and rebalance if they
819.76s: want but again if you're just using one
821.72s: ticker spy then you're done and you
824.68s: might get to a point where you say ah I
826.52s: want to decrease a little bit of risk
828.20s: I'm getting closer to retirement well
830.36s: that's pretty simple all you do is
832.48s: modulate how much you're putting in
834.40s: bonds so let's say you're getting close
836.24s: to retirement you're not looking to grow
837.76s: your money anymore you just kind of want
839.28s: some income and to protect your Capital
841.64s: well maybe this goes to 20% S&P 500 and
844.68s: 80% TLT the point is this can be
847.28s: modulated to whatever you need based on
849.16s: your needs however for the Traders this
851.72s: is when things start getting serious you
854.36s: are going to have to create that trading
856.00s: plan that I was telling about you are
857.84s: going to have to start paper trading to
859.92s: figure out what works for you so if you
862.32s: are going down this trading route this
865.04s: is a whole other world that I will
867.88s: create a second video for you on that
870.48s: dives into that specifically but up
872.68s: until this point it's the same whether
874.96s: you're investing or trading so I hope
877.24s: that this helps everybody out if you
879.12s: have any questions comments concerns
880.80s: drop me a line let me know and don't
883.24s: forget a little bit of delayed
885.52s: gratification upfront can really change
888.56s: your life further down the line so get
891.40s: consistent embrace the process and watch
895.84s: you become an outlier catch youall later
