0.00s: What's up outliers launching one of the very few giveaways we do to celebrate hitting 30,000 subscribers when we get there?
10.36s: I am currently here the man with the plan.
13.00s: He just moved underneath me instead of his heated blanket, but we were talking about it and we think we have a pretty good plan for what we're gonna do.
21.52s: The idea here is I really do celebrations like this just because I know 30,000 isn't that many,
28.24s: but in the context of our audience and like what we do, that's actually pretty cool.
34.76s: So what I want to do is host a live stream and then also a giveaway.
40.40s: The live stream will be to tell some trading war stories, give you a bit of a behind-the-scenes look into what goes into building the YouTube channel and the community.
50.00s: I know I'm always interested in that when I see other channels, so figure it out and be kind of cool to give you all look into that.
55.56s: But then the giveaway will be for a one hour one-on-one strategy session with me.
62.12s: We're gonna take a comprehensive look at your entire trading approach and look for ways to optimize it and make it better.
70.76s: This is what I've done over the last 18 years of trading in my life and I hope and think it will be pretty useful for whoever wins.
80.20s: So to enter, it's pretty straightforward.
82.60s: All you have to do is hop in the comments.
85.48s: In drop, your biggest trading lesson that you've learned so far.
90.52s: This is so that we can share ideas with one another and subscribe.
94.12s: If you do those two things, you are entered.
96.60s: And then if you would like a second entry for yourself, all you need to do is share the video with one of your friends.
104.68s: And then add a comment with what trading topic your friend would find interesting.
112.44s: And then I'll use those to build videos in the future.
116.28s: So if you have any questions, let me know. We'll announce the winner during the live stream after we hit 30,000.
123.16s: So the sooner we get there, the sooner we kick all this off.
126.52s: Be an outlier. See you all later.
