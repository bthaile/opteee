0.00s: I made 84% return in NEM in less than 40 days.
5.80s: So this video is going to walk you through a ratio call diagonal position that I put
10.08s: on in NEM.
11.24s: And I want to walk you through essentially how I've managed the trade.
14.72s: It's been a while since I've done one of these trade deep dives.
18.12s: So this one's not going to be edited.
19.56s: We're just going to get straight into details and start working through the position.
23.08s: So here's in a nutshell, what played out on the 4th of March.
28.84s: The old birthday to myself, I guess I gave myself a gift.
32.32s: I saw NEM starting to break out in a pretty big way.
37.08s: And it popped up on one of my alerts.
39.48s: And this is where I entered the trade.
41.60s: Now what's the origin of all of this?
44.68s: It's kind of simple.
46.08s: And I've been talking about this stuff on my YouTube lives actually for quite a while.
51.64s: And it's the rotation that we're seeing still from capital tied up in things like if
61.44s: I zoom this out a little bit more like six months, you can see that on a longer term time
66.88s: frame, IT communication services, these have been killing it for the last year plus.
74.48s: And definitely within the last six months.
76.56s: But if you take a look at some of these shorter term time frames, like if we go here two,
80.16s: three months, you notice that.
81.60s: That energy materials, industrials starting to creep up towards the top a little bit.
87.08s: We go into one month.
88.60s: You'll also see that we still see energy running at the top materials still down towards the
93.64s: bottom.
94.64s: But it's important to click within materials because metals and mining has been doing a great
99.64s: job for some time.
100.64s: So you can see metals and mining is actually at 15% as compared to some of the other sub sectors
106.00s: of materials that are struggling.
107.88s: So because I've started catching some of this rotation of capital into these other products,
113.32s: especially against the broader inflationary environment that we're in, I became really
116.96s: interested.
117.96s: So NEM popped up on one of my scans and I decided to essentially just watch it.
126.20s: And I didn't like it here at all.
129.20s: So what I ended up doing was setting an alert right here at 3131.
135.24s: And it's just because this is kind of where I saw near term resistance if we started to
140.44s: get some sort of pullback.
142.96s: And we started to see a little bit of life come through.
146.16s: It's hard to see because it's kind of suppressed, but you can actually see that volume on these
151.12s: updates started to expand.
153.60s: So that was interesting to me.
155.48s: And I ended up getting the alert after it cracked above 3131 on the 29th.
162.04s: So then I was watching it on the first of March.
164.88s: I was keeping an eye on the volume as we're running into this.
168.36s: And then actually when the dividend was coming out, you know, you'd never know necessarily
173.20s: against broader market conditions.
174.80s: I didn't necessarily, you know, integrate too much into the decision cycle, but I was
179.48s: aware that there was a dividend coming up.
182.00s: And then on the fourth, I started seeing this really strong volume.
186.40s: So I entered into a pretty speculative.
189.44s: So this lived within my speculative allocation of the portfolio, but I entered into a ratio
194.88s: call diagonal.
196.64s: So the broader market hypothesis, kind of what we've been talking about, high inflation
201.56s: now, especially higher for longer is becoming a theme.
205.64s: Tech is still doing well, but starting to fall off a little bit.
208.68s: We're coming into an earning cycle.
210.80s: There are, you know, a handful of things coming to the forefront of my brain, but the main
215.40s: thing that I want to highlight here is the rotation of capital into things like metals,
220.92s: into things like energy.
221.92s: Actually, I have a couple energy trades on as well.
224.84s: Now the primary profit mechanism in here was a bullish thesis, meaning I wanted NEM
230.20s: to go up.
231.52s: My original targets when I entered the trade were 42 and 31, 42 simply because that is
239.40s: where the near term high was.
241.68s: And I would love to see us run up there.
244.52s: I didn't think that we would run straight up there, but that was the near term target.
249.24s: And then 31 because I was actually setting a really tight stop to the downside on this.
255.08s: And it's because it's in a broader downtrend.
257.52s: I viewed this as a really speculative entry.
261.04s: I typically don't like to enter things when they're running down like this.
264.64s: I look for strength, but because I saw strength in the broader subsector, it made me interested
269.84s: on this volume breakout.
271.64s: So once I saw it crack up above this kind of, you know, 32 handle, that's when I really
280.40s: thought we were seeing some strength.
283.08s: So the original trade that I put out was a 45 lot of the 30 calls expiring 21 June
292.04s: 24.
293.24s: And this was back on the 4th of March again.
296.48s: So this originally was allocated to be a $25,000 position in its entirety.
302.36s: And I wanted to use most of the capital upfront because I had such a tight stop loss on the
309.40s: product.
311.56s: The reason why I went with a ratio called Agnoles because I wanted to leverage to the upside.
317.40s: I also typically prefer the efficiency is compared to buying the shares, although either
323.68s: in this case is fine.
325.56s: And I went out to 21 June at the time of entry because that falls into kind of my standardized
331.08s: days to expiration target timeframe for ratio called Agnoles.
334.88s: I like the longs to be definitely longer than 60 DTE typically 90 plus.
341.00s: I've used to be over a year for almost all of them, but I've actually slowly have brought
345.44s: it in quite a bit.
346.92s: And normally it'll be somewhere around 90 now with any am specifically liquidity was a concern.
353.96s: So I had to find decent offerings that led me to an entry that wasn't overwhelmed by super
362.92s: wide bit ask spreads.
364.56s: And that's actually why I ended up at this.
367.48s: So when I first put this on, it was a little light on the deltas.
371.60s: It was like a 70 something delta typically prefer 80 plus, but again liquidity kind of drove
376.76s: me in that direction.
378.68s: Now when I first sold calls against the position that's actually this line item here, you notice
384.72s: that I only sold 10.
386.44s: Why did I only sell 10?
388.20s: Well, it's because I wanted to see more follow through and I started to see it, but then
395.20s: it kind of just started trading sideways for a while.
397.96s: And actually during a couple conversations with the pro community, I was talking about unwinding
402.72s: this position for a small profit because it hadn't yet done what I wanted.
407.40s: And it was getting a little bit long in the trade because I originally wanted to manage
413.68s: this position before we came into earnings on 25 April.
418.00s: Now I was okay to hold through earnings if we had a sustained move and it looks like
423.12s: we still are having a pretty decent move, but it's not quite enough.
426.92s: And I also have some travel coming up.
428.56s: So that leads into a little bit of the decision to unwind, but going back to the choice on
432.96s: the ratio.
433.96s: And that's why it was so light because I was sacrificing the money upfront because I
438.76s: really wanted to try to maximize my upside potential in the position.
444.08s: And I collected 60 cents on that.
446.68s: So 600 bucks and those were 32 delta.
450.84s: And obviously over the lifecycle of this trade, they actually fell in the money.
455.12s: So if we go to 20 March here, you'll see that's where the position was managed.
461.48s: And that is right here.
466.64s: And essentially what I wanted to do was roll out and up to give me some more upside potential
473.52s: to see if I could get the calls a little bit out of the money, but keep the ratio.
478.16s: I didn't want to add any size because I wanted the upside profit potential.
481.96s: So that's what I ended up doing.
483.48s: I was able to take the 34s to 35s.
486.04s: I had them out to 19 April.
489.24s: And I collected 88 cents.
490.84s: So a small credit on those of 20 cents, same size.
494.12s: And obviously those fell deep in the money.
496.68s: These came off today, the 11th of April for 435.
501.56s: So the total aggregate PNL on the short call side of the trade did nothing but serve as
505.68s: drag on my returns.
507.60s: It was a 35 50 loss in total.
512.40s: So fortunately, sometimes when you get these really big, powerful moves, the short calls
517.84s: as you would expect, they really decrease our return profile.
522.36s: Now what ended up happening in the position, I started with like I said, it's around
528.96s: like a 78% allocation.
531.76s: I was targeting around 75%.
534.64s: And then I saw this next breakout.
537.00s: So I had another alert set for anything above this 35 22 handle.
542.52s: And we saw it on the 28th of March.
545.72s: We saw a slight uptick in volume, not quite as much as we saw earlier, but still enough
551.08s: that it registered for me.
553.00s: So in this case, I chose to add a little bit to the position.
557.32s: And that's what you see down here.
558.96s: So I added five of this of the same exact contract for $6.32.
565.64s: So that took my aggregate basis to 455 total investment at this point is 22,735.
572.36s: I was actually saving a little bit more room to scale in again.
575.88s: If I just started seeing volume fly off the handle, this is a little bit of a mistake.
582.12s: And the reason why it's a little bit of a mistake is because based on the amount of time
585.64s: I had left in this trade against my original premise, if I were to scale in here again,
591.44s: I probably would have gone with the rest of the allocation because it was a no risk
596.12s: trade at that point.
597.56s: What I did was slide the stop up from 3170 and change.
602.56s: And all I did was bring it just below this really aggressive consolidation period that
609.32s: we had here.
610.48s: So it went to like 34 and change, which would have locked in a profit.
614.24s: And then I slid it up again to 3526 actually on this day, the very next day.
619.88s: And from there, I just start using the moving averages to follow the trend.
625.04s: So my game plan because of the constraint for timing, I was going to use this expression,
632.04s: this moving average as my exit, which is just a nine or a 10 day 10 day.
636.44s: So that led me to today where we fell off a bit.
641.92s: I see the candle today.
644.00s: It still looked pretty strong, really light volume though.
646.76s: I didn't love that.
648.28s: So as I saw the day unfolding, I ended up exiting today because it's at a good profit.
653.16s: My next stop, as you can see, was moved up here to 3777.
657.64s: And the probability of this channeling sideways for a little bit before it regained some
662.68s: steam is moderate in my opinion.
665.40s: And this realizes a pretty decent amount of profit right out of the gate.
669.52s: So what I ended up doing was offloading all 50 of the 30 calls.
675.36s: And again, I bought them for an average of 455.
679.24s: And I ended up selling them for 910 average today.
685.04s: So that takes the realized PNL on the long calls to 22,765 less the 3550 from the short
695.16s: calls.
696.36s: So that takes the total PNL of the trade to 19,000 to 15, which is an 84.5% return on invested
704.96s: capital.
705.96s: So a couple notes that I want to highlight here specifically is I still think this rotation
712.04s: is likely in play.
713.28s: However, it might slow down a little bit with the current rate environment dragging out
716.96s: as it is.
718.32s: And it wouldn't surprise me to see capital starting to rotate back into tech, which is something
722.88s: that I'm keeping an eye on.
724.16s: However, we're at a really interesting market position, especially whenever we end up
729.20s: getting closer to this rate cut actually happening.
732.28s: I think that you'll see things like this start to move even more still.
736.12s: But this was a way essentially for me to gain exposure to gold because this is one of
740.72s: the largest gold miners.
742.68s: And it came up on a couple of my alerts.
744.88s: So that was the trade.
745.96s: I have a few others that I've actually talked to the community about in different products.
751.76s: But this one I thought was interesting because of two things.
754.28s: One, the mistake I made here and two, because this is something that it was actually coming
758.64s: up on my time horizon to manage this trade because it wasn't performing.
763.64s: And I got a decent move.
764.96s: It was running a small profit, but it wasn't moving enough in order for it to make sense.
770.32s: But I gave it just enough time that it started to pop out for me, which is again, ideally
775.80s: what we wanted to see here.
777.28s: So that's the trade.
778.28s: If you have any questions or anything that you want me to dive into about it, just let
781.32s: me know.
782.32s: Happy to like, subscribe, share, be an outlier.
783.92s: See you guys later.
