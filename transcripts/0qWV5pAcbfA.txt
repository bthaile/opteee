522.00s:  do you
530.00s:  what
533.12s:  do you
535.92s:  what do you
537.20s:  Uh
537.92s:  we
538.16s:  Why do I break these apart?
544.16s:  The very important reason why I break these apart, why I would consider the system or
551.76s:  strategy, whether it's good or bad, different than whether it's a good or bad trade.
557.64s:  Also, in case you guys didn't know, one of my buddies who's in the real estate business,
562.52s:  he's out here in San Diego visiting some of his friends.
565.04s:  He actually invited me out.
567.04s:  He rented a yacht for his community to go float around in the bay.
572.08s:  And I told him, I was like, I can't bail on my people because I found out kind of late
576.28s:  and I don't like dropping last second.
578.56s:  So I thought you guys would like to know that the 23 of you that are here genuinely are
583.36s:  more important at this point in time than going to that, not bailing on you guys.
590.84s:  But Lauren says, I'm actually good at getting into a decent trade but have trouble with
596.04s:  the dismount every time.
597.36s:  Yeah, Lauren, I actually think we have, let's see, I'm actually curious.
603.76s:  Let's see.
608.36s:  So far.
611.32s:  Another high today.
612.32s:  Ain't that some shit, huh?
616.12s:  So yeah, Lauren speaking of completely messing up the dismount, I couldn't agree with you
623.80s:  more on that.
625.80s:  Man, just running away and even on a down day still hit highs and it's still closed higher
634.88s:  on the red day than it did on the day before.
638.56s:  This is after it gapped up previously.
643.44s:  So yeah, yeah, same page with you there, Lauren, we are completely in a grince.
652.76s:  Joey says for me, it would be the entry and exits were with intolerance would be part
657.48s:  of the system.
658.48s:  I would assume our good or bad trade is more of the thesis was correct or not.
661.64s:  It's actually not.
662.64s:  That's actually another great point, Joey.
666.00s:  But I have a hold on.
670.24s:  This was wedged underneath my chair.
673.52s:  So I gave Thor an elk antler that's actually quartered.
679.72s:  So it still has some bone marrow in it.
682.28s:  And he has been cracked out all afternoon, I think getting into his like inner predator.
687.84s:  So now this has been getting whipped around.
690.80s:  And now he's laying in his bed staring at me wondering what I'm going to do with his
694.56s:  elephant, which I'm just going to hand it to him for now.
696.92s:  Not looking to start any shit with Thor at the moment.
699.84s:  He's literally cracked out.
703.68s:  Zachary says in, in do just jump dumped me lots of casts Israel just bombed Iran.
710.16s:  Well, we'll take a look at that.
713.84s:  But anyways, for Joey's specific comment on good or bad trade if the thesis was correct
720.00s:  or not, that's actually not it.
724.16s:  So let's use an example to start here.
727.36s:  So first, let's differentiate between these.
732.36s:  This focuses on application of system.
744.20s:  That's what a good trade is.
746.40s:  A good strategy or system positively expectant return within risk tolerance.
762.76s:  That's a good system.
765.60s:  So notice how when we look at the idea of trade versus system or strategy, trade is built
773.96s:  on the individual occurrence of something.
776.96s:  A trade is an event of one.
780.24s:  A system is an event, hopefully, of very many, being something that we apply over a time
787.52s:  frame.
790.64s:  So trade individual occurrence strategy, multiple occurrence.
800.24s:  Good trade is the application of a good strategy.
805.28s:  A good strategy is something that's positively expectant that falls within your risk tolerance.
812.68s:  So those feed into one another.
816.28s:  Because another thing that a lot of people actually sometimes would say to something like
820.48s:  that is a good trade follows is where you follow the rules.
828.44s:  Maybe.
829.44s:  I don't follow my rules all the time.
831.12s:  I break them sometimes.
832.68s:  A lot of times when I break them, it's actually for a very specific reason because there's
836.36s:  some sort of circumstance.
837.96s:  A lot of times it's actually better for me.
840.84s:  That's the case for me.
842.72s:  Most traders have not built a healthy enough relationship with rules.
848.92s:  And a lot of times new traders will break the rules just because they don't like how
852.40s:  something's going.
853.40s:  They're uncomfortable.
854.40s:  Those are terrible reasons to break a rule.
857.16s:  But when we think about individual trades, one of the worst possible thing that you can
866.24s:  do, whether it's a good or bad trade is overemphasize the outcome of that individual trade.
874.00s:  That's bad.
875.00s:  And tell you what's bad, as long as you're managing risk effectively, if you do not overemphasize
880.80s:  the outcome of the individual trade, you're off to the right start.
886.72s:  Okay, so we should now have an idea of what a good and bad trade are or what a good and
893.60s:  a bad system or strategy is.
896.28s:  Good bad trade.
897.28s:  Again, not based on the outcome.
900.68s:  It's based on the application of something.
904.00s:  That Lauren says, what do you mean by overemphasize?
906.20s:  That's a great question.
907.60s:  So what I mean by that is let's say I am trading actually this beautiful segue.
916.28s:  But Lauren, I don't know if you meant to do this, but you served as literally the perfect
923.32s:  segue into a practical example, not in so far.
926.92s:  That's more just for you to look at and cry.
931.04s:  What was the trade?
932.04s:  I have to grab the ticker I forgot.
933.60s:  Give me one sec.
935.68s:  I want to look at CORZ.
943.88s:  CORZ.
946.72s:  So this is a trade that I took down today for a loss and I had entered this trade on
953.12s:  the breakout was it yesterday that day before.
960.20s:  I entered here on this breakout.
964.16s:  So it's actually a better entry than I thought I'm not even going to lie.
967.12s:  So I ended up entering here on a breakout following a specific strategy of mine.
976.20s:  And then we had a little bit of a week rally the next day.
979.44s:  I don't love that.
981.08s:  And then we had a weaker move the following day and then we had a bit of a red day today
985.60s:  closed it today and actually took it down for a loss.
989.80s:  What happened here?
991.68s:  This is still a good trade.
996.52s:  This is still a good trade based on what I was doing.
999.88s:  I was taking on really good risk reward relationships on something that followed a proven
1007.16s:  system that I've built and maintained over years now.
1012.08s:  Now there's a scenario that can happen where this didn't hit my risk control point technically
1019.84s:  speaking.
1020.84s:  The soft stop was actually down here at 1262 to start.
1025.84s:  It didn't get near the soft stop.
1028.08s:  So I still had plenty of room here in terms of where this thing may or may not have gone.
1035.08s:  However, normally with the strategy within this timeframe, the breakout would be realized,
1043.32s:  meaning that there would be continuation and a good alternate example of this is a P P.
1049.60s:  We've looked at this trade a bunch of times now because guess what?
1052.32s:  I'm still in this trade blow in my mind.
1056.52s:  But now we had another leg up here after another smaller leg up here after this March leg
1062.76s:  up here after this leg up over here.
1065.92s:  Okay.
1066.92s:  All of that aside, when I entered a P P here, significant breakout, continuation, rolling
1075.52s:  all the way up.
1076.52s:  Even when it starts to consolidate, it's hanging on the 10 day moving average.
1081.72s:  And the next breakout, significant breakout that then it's semi confirmed.
1088.44s:  It's rolling sideways, right?
1092.08s:  But if I look at pores, it's different because on this breakout, it wasn't unilateral
1101.80s:  and volume.
1102.80s:  So I already knew that this was a little more speculative in nature.
1105.48s:  It had a shorter consolidation period, which I prefer to see a longer consolidation period.
1111.40s:  Then it had these two days that were supposedly meaning they're green.
1116.36s:  Well, this one updates, but it didn't go anywhere.
1119.76s:  So long story short, this was still within my risk parameters and I took it down.
1125.28s:  The reason why I did it is because it wasn't behaving correctly against the profit mechanism
1131.00s:  and sub mechanism that I was looking to capture.
1136.32s:  If I was overemphasizing an individual trade, there's a million things I can do to this
1143.72s:  trade to fix it or to make it better for the circumstance.
1147.96s:  And that's gone on a truth.
1149.32s:  There's I could have made this trade profitable.
1151.40s:  I'm literally 100% certain of it, but it's not about whether or not I make an individual
1157.16s:  trade profitable.
1159.04s:  It's about what happens with the system over the long run.
1163.56s:  So when we overemphasize individual trades, we forget that even if we can make this one
1170.36s:  individual circumstance better, how does that lend when we go into the next 100, 200,
1178.24s:  500, 1000, 1000 plus iterations of this same fucking thing?
1187.04s:  You set yourself up literally for failure, literally for failure.
1192.84s:  So that's the idea of overemphasizing an individual trade.
1197.68s:  This trade fits in with a broader approach and it needs to be managed as that.
1207.52s:  We have to devalue the outcome of individual trades provided that we're trading a profitable
1214.12s:  system.
1216.16s:  One of the primary reasons why traders will really struggle to devalue the outcome of an individual
1222.08s:  trade is because each time that it happens, it feels like you're catching a bird out
1227.20s:  of the air and you're so happy to have gotten that bird out of the air and you're not sure
1231.80s:  if you're going to get another one.
1233.84s:  But if you're a profitable trader, I know there's other birds.
1237.44s:  I know I'm going to grab those motherfuckers out of the air.
1240.56s:  I know they're going to be there.
1242.28s:  So I'm less concerned about doing what I can try to do with this one individual trade
1248.36s:  to make it a positive outcome for me because it doesn't matter.
1252.60s:  It doesn't matter in the broad context if I'm trading a profitable strategy.
1258.88s:  So Lauren, let me know if that answers your question with respect to the concept of not
1267.48s:  overemphasizing the outcome of an individual trade.
1271.92s:  It's something we all do.
1273.48s:  It's literally natural.
1275.96s:  It's very, very difficult to like fully put out of your mind and put away.
1282.48s:  Very difficult, but it happens over time and it happens when you have a system that
1287.84s:  you're very happy with.
1288.84s:  Again, for example, the loss that I took in course today was a few thousand dollars.
1296.88s:  And I've already told you guys, we talked about this trade a while ago.
1300.12s:  This trade, when we talked about it over here, it was a six figure trade and then some.
1308.12s:  So I don't care.
1309.96s:  I don't care that course lost me a few thousand dollars.
1314.84s:  Literally doesn't matter because as long as I find my way into a handful of these,
1321.28s:  they will more than cover the cost of the course trade.
1327.12s:  And the funny thing is is that if I look through my trade log, it's funny enough, the
1331.84s:  topic for today.
1333.48s:  When I look at through my trade log for breakout trades, I tend to take the losing trades down
1339.24s:  very fast, very, very fast, which is actually pretty interesting to me.
1346.40s:  The reason why that's pretty interesting to me is because it tells me that I have no
1353.92s:  problem, absolutely no problem, trying to take down and get rid of positions that are
1361.56s:  not working in line with the portfolio.
1364.24s:  I don't even have to wait until I get to stops.
1366.88s:  Cores is a good example of not waiting until I got to a stop.
1371.84s:  I didn't even get to my soft stop before I got out of it.
1375.16s:  So that's an example where I broke the rule of the trade.
1378.76s:  Now, the fun part about this, and this is the other thing that is so simple, but it
1383.44s:  blows people's mind.
1385.76s:  Why do you think I have an alert set right here?
1390.32s:  This is one of those things that is so simple, but yet it is so overlooked.
1397.00s:  It's fascinating to me.
1400.88s:  Absolutely fascinating to me.
1403.08s:  Well, I'm not in it.
1405.84s:  I got out.
1406.84s:  I'm out for a loss.
1409.92s:  No, no, it's not that.
1411.92s:  There you go, Joey, get back in.
1416.96s:  So traders have this really weird thing where it feels like if you get out of a trade,
1422.72s:  if you get out of a ticker, then you're just out of the ticker, right?
1426.36s:  And then you can't go back in because you can't change your mind.
1429.32s:  You can't look at new information that disagrees with the original idea and then revert back
1435.40s:  to the original idea of things start panning out again.
1437.84s:  You can't do that because then you look stupid or because it doesn't make sense to do something
1442.88s:  undo it and then do it again.
1444.52s:  Well, guess what?
1445.52s:  In trading, the things that don't make sense tend to make perfect fucking sense.
1449.88s:  This is one of those things.
1452.16s:  It is completely cool to get out of something because it's not behaving right and you
1456.52s:  would better believe if this continues to behave as I think it might.
1461.72s:  And I see a breakout here again, depending on the quality of the breakout, how it behaves,
1465.92s:  but it looks like all those details, I'll get right back in.
1470.28s:  I will get right back into the thing that just lost me money.
1475.08s:  It's okay.
1476.60s:  So the idea is to be a thinking trader that can synthesize information.
1482.40s:  For me, it made way more sense to get out, wasn't behaving correctly.
1487.04s:  And then I can get back in if it starts behaving correctly again.
1490.88s:  There's no reason for me to wait until it got to my soft stop.
1494.52s:  It didn't matter.
1495.52s:  It didn't have to get down there.
1497.20s:  I don't like what it's doing now.
1498.40s:  It's not doing what I wanted to do after three days in the trade.
1502.20s:  It's all yours to it.
1504.72s:  Karim Al Oh shit.
1506.92s:  Hold on.
1508.40s:  Karim Al Mo Tar Mo Tar Karim Al Mo Tar.
1516.96s:  Let me know if I got that right.
1517.96s:  That's my best guess.
1519.48s:  Can you explain how to find an edge in the market is using different time frames than
1522.80s:  approach for an example?
1524.40s:  That's a big question.
1526.28s:  So this video is for you, Karim.
1530.00s:  And let me see.
1532.32s:  This is another video for you, Karim.
1536.56s:  Those two videos are for you.
1539.68s:  And the process of finding an edge, it's a really big question.
1542.96s:  That's why I'm sending you those videos.
1544.40s:  It's probably a little easier to tap into those.
1547.44s:  But your analysis here of, for example, using different time frames, that's more of
1553.08s:  just an analysis.
1555.72s:  And edge has a lot of different definitions, depending on who you ask and the context.
1562.52s:  A lot of people would define edge as returns above beta.
1570.00s:  So not using just standard 1.0 beta.
1576.00s:  And that just means the S&P 500.
1579.64s:  So for example, if you buy a stock and you get a positive return, and that stock essentially
1587.88s:  has the same return and risk profile as the S&P 500, most people wouldn't consider
1594.52s:  that alpha.
1595.72s:  They would just consider that a beta return.
1598.76s:  And when we actually talk about, I actually have to update the timestamp because I need
1603.88s:  to talk about the leveraged ETF covered stranglebook.
1610.44s:  Give me one second.
1611.76s:  So we'll talk about 25 or zero edge.
1615.24s:  And then 27 will be leveraged covered wrangle review.
1626.44s:  And so for example, if we take a look at this, I just copied this over from my portal
1633.84s:  portfolio.
1635.40s:  This is what the covered strangle right now looks like in TEE Triple Cues.
1640.28s:  And there's essentially no change from the last time we saw TEE Triple Cues and SSO
1644.00s:  are the same.
1645.36s:  Now one of the things to note here, however, is that these, if I had no options component
1654.24s:  to this, if there's no options at all, the way that these outperform the market is not
1662.16s:  necessarily through alpha, it's through more beta.
1668.32s:  So I'm taking additional risk to get the better return.
1674.00s:  So alpha is kind of this nebulous financial term that a lot of people have their own definitions
1680.24s:  for what it is.
1681.24s:  I'm actually curious like what the investor, PDA definition is.
1684.72s:  I'm going to look up investor, PDA specifically because I want to know theirs.
1688.48s:  I'm going to look up the plan V, E, PDA definition of alpha.
1701.12s:  Let's see what they say.
1702.64s:  Yeah, okay.
1703.64s:  I would agree with that.
1706.12s:  So they say access return of an investment compared to its expected return given a level
1710.28s:  of risk as the term of ice beta.
1711.76s:  Yeah, okay, cool.
1712.76s:  That makes it so in a sense.
1713.76s:  I think this is a great definition.
1715.60s:  I agree with this.
1717.60s:  So you can have a better return, but if you're taking a lot more risk to get that return,
1724.96s:  meaning you have larger standard deviation in your portfolio returns, then it's not alpha.
1733.68s:  It's just beta, just more beta.
1736.04s:  It's all you've taken.
1738.48s:  Wigglyworm says, I've literally never heard of anyone discuss alpha or beta in depth.
1743.56s:  Welcome to the fucking nerd corner of YouTube trading because yeah, we talk about all sorts
1751.80s:  of nerdy shit and this is one of them for sure.
1757.24s:  Now I think there's kind of an easier way to define alpha, but I like this.
1768.04s:  So yeah, anyways, the idea of using multiple time frames, and that's not really,
1773.96s:  it's not really alpha, that's just an analysis approach.
1777.64s:  So when you're talking about alpha in this concept or in this context, you're talking about
1785.24s:  the ability to outperform a benchmark of sorts, whatever that benchmark is.
1791.08s:  That's what you're trying to unearthly adjusted basis.
1794.84s:  So the reason why I say if I trade T triple cues with nothing else, that's just taking
1802.88s:  more beta.
1803.88s:  However, if I trade the covered strangle as I've defined in T triple cues, now there's
1809.24s:  a strategy behind it.
1811.48s:  So let's say for example, it's not going to be the case in this scenario, the way that
1815.28s:  I have this case study setup.
1818.36s:  But when I would trade three times leveraged ETFs and I really cared about trying to minimize
1824.20s:  draw downs and capitalize on the leverage to the upside, then I integrate momentum following
1831.08s:  components to it where you can actually pace the stock market standard deviation to the
1837.28s:  downside, the draw downs, where you can grossly outperform to the upside.
1842.68s:  That is a perfect example of alpha.
1846.36s:  So it's using something that is higher beta as the basis for the strategy.
1851.68s:  It's building a strategy around this specific product and then you can create alpha.
1859.04s:  So the cool part is you as the trader have an ability to generate alpha.
1864.00s:  Again, if you're a good trader, if you're not, then most people just take excess risk.
1870.44s:  And again, you can outperform the market that way.
1873.60s:  It's just not something I would technically classify as alpha.
1878.12s:  Michael says, I'm not set up to trade options and I just buy invest in common shares.
1881.96s:  Yeah, that's cool.
1883.44s:  So for example, if an investing in common shares, you're able to identify tickers.
1889.16s:  Let's say for example, that you trade the, let me take a step back.
1896.80s:  Options and equities are just different securities.
1902.84s:  Most of the stuff that I'm talking about here, like this in APP, I'm trading options in
1909.84s:  this.
1910.92s:  It doesn't matter if I'm trading options or not.
1913.68s:  What's happening?
1914.68s:  The profit mechanism is the exact same, the exact same.
1919.32s:  I'm just using a different security to capitalize on the profit mechanism.
1924.52s:  So the idea of alpha generation or if you want to reduce downside, standard deviation
1932.48s:  movements, those you can absolutely manufacture regardless of the security suite
1940.76s:  that you choose to use.
1942.64s:  So Wigglyworm says options are just leverage.
1946.48s:  Yeah, they're not just leverage, but they're largely leverage.
1950.04s:  It's one of the main reasons why people will trade options.
1952.96s:  The other thing that options offer us are exposure to different things that you cannot
1959.80s:  get directly with equities.
1963.96s:  So for example, let's say, let's say APP, this is a perfect example.
1970.12s:  APP, the open closed move today was 161.46 to 161.63.
1978.92s:  So essentially very little of a move didn't do a whole lot.
1983.32s:  Now, let's just say in this example, let me grab my handy dandy notepad.
1992.12s:  So let's say here Vladimir says leverage with a timer attached.
2007.52s:  That's sort of it.
2008.52s:  I mean, technically leverage would have a timer attached to it by its nature.
2012.04s:  That's what creates leverage.
2015.72s:  It's just like an infinite thing.
2018.28s:  But more importantly than the timer, it's that it has other components to it.
2025.08s:  That it gives you exposure to things that you do not have in equities.
2030.88s:  So say, for example, that in here, you wanted to make money in APP.
2039.28s:  Well, let's just say that you cut the highs and lows off just for this example.
2043.88s:  And I just want to highlight that it's kind of muted movement, right?
2047.00s:  It's not doing a whole lot.
2049.00s:  So unless you're literally able to perfectly time movements, buy it down here, sell it up
2053.52s:  here.
2054.52s:  You can't really make money from this with equities.
2057.64s:  Now with options, it's different.
2059.60s:  With options in this scenario up here, let's say for example, I sold a strangle.
2069.96s:  And I sold it whereas long as it stays inside this price range, I make money.
2074.08s:  I would make money as this does nothing.
2077.60s:  And let's say for example, another example, I'm trading this with long calls.
2086.52s:  So in this same example, those long calls are suffering time decay because time is passing
2093.32s:  except now they're in a practical sense.
2095.60s:  They're so far in the money, there's very little extrinsic value.
2099.04s:  But that part aside, let's say for example, this is, let me pull this up here because it
2108.08s:  will be a little more clear now.
2110.36s:  Do you notice how this yellow line here is upward sloping?
2118.00s:  That's volatility.
2119.52s:  Both of these.
2121.12s:  This is seven day, vol.
2124.20s:  And this is 30 day, vol.
2130.16s:  As these are upward sloping, the value of my long calls goes up.
2140.20s:  So even though price in this specific section that I'm talking about is not really going
2147.36s:  anywhere, the long calls will still appreciate slightly.
2153.56s:  Again, this is in a vacuum.
2154.96s:  There's other factors that play into this.
2157.80s:  The long calls would appreciate slightly from the changes in volatility.
2162.16s:  So all of this goes back to the original kind of point of options are way more than just
2167.56s:  leverage.
2168.56s:  That's a big component of options.
2170.68s:  It's why most of us trade options is for leverage.
2174.04s:  But there's a lot more to options than just leverage.
2176.80s:  It's what makes them such a strategic investment tool.
2182.12s:  It's from this book over here.
2192.60s:  So this book, I love the way that he uses the term strategic.
2199.20s:  And it's because they are very strategic.
2203.76s:  If you trade anything, most things can be made slightly better with options if you know
2210.48s:  how to trade options.
2212.56s:  So if somebody says that they're an equity trader, that's okay.
2216.96s:  You don't have to be an equity trader.
2219.48s:  You have a specific style and you choose to use equities and that's okay, but you can
2224.80s:  use other stuff.
2225.80s:  So that's the idea.
2226.80s:  All right.
2241.88s:  So now let's talk about.
2248.60s:  We already talked about this part.
2251.68s:  You guys already know the latest here.
2253.28s:  There's really very little change.
2255.88s:  And that's again, by design, what the way that I'm setting this up is purposely to keep
2260.48s:  it very, very light.
2263.04s:  So now we can move on to the focus topic, I think.
2267.80s:  So we'll talk about building a trade log.
2272.48s:  All right.
2278.20s:  Let's start.
2280.80s:  I don't think anybody specifically asked from the Patreon side about building a trade
2286.32s:  log.
2287.32s:  I think I kind of forced that one in there.
2289.92s:  But let's let's talk about it.
2294.44s:  First things first.
2299.00s:  Let's get a bit of an introduction.
2302.04s:  So the whole idea of building a trade log is based on the left hand side here.
2308.84s:  And I'm grabbing a video right now about the process of building trade logs, trading
2316.76s:  plans, those kinds of things.
2318.72s:  So you'll have that for a reference.
2321.16s:  So why do we build a trade log?
2323.24s:  Well, first, a trade log is exactly what it sounds like.
2327.08s:  It's a place to log your trades.
2329.68s:  Okay.
2330.68s:  Now we know what it is.
2331.68s:  Why do we do this?
2333.60s:  It's pretty simple.
2335.84s:  So the first thing is your memory is not that good.
2340.80s:  My memory is not that good, especially after seven concussions at least documented concussions.
2346.40s:  Yeah, your boy's memory is bad as you would expect something like that would be.
2353.00s:  That aside, we also have a litany of parable, parable biases.
2360.16s:  And again, this part's on the website.
2363.52s:  And I put this on the website because I think people should fucking know this stuff.
2369.16s:  So we have a, and this isn't even all of them.
2371.84s:  This is just a list of 24 and there's more than this different cognitive biases that you
2380.20s:  have right now today.
2384.20s:  And there's actually, I think, a really cool, let me see if I can find it real quick.
2393.52s:  I'm trying to see.
2404.12s:  I think it was from, I don't know if it was from SAG.
2414.08s:  Yeah, man.
2422.48s:  I'll see if I can find it later.
2423.76s:  Anyways, they have like a series.
2426.32s:  Oh, maybe a, damn it.
2430.40s:  Really want to find it.
2432.76s:  Okay, here we go.
2442.80s:  Here we go.
2444.64s:  I knew it.
2446.56s:  You just had to give me a second.
2453.48s:  Okay.
2454.96s:  So here's the question.
2457.56s:  And this is from, this is from SAG.
2460.76s:  So just to give them credit.
2463.08s:  But let's, let's read this together.
2464.68s:  What do you guys think?
2466.40s:  The, the table here says review the following table of data and answer this question.
2470.64s:  What is the relationship between pain and rainy days?
2478.76s:  Rain?
2481.24s:  No rain.
2482.24s:  That's your X axis on top.
2484.60s:  Why axis is pain?
2485.88s:  No pain.
2487.20s:  What do you guys think?
2490.72s:  That Lauren says Eric has the bad news bears of trading.
2494.76s:  Maybe I hope I also have the good news bears, but yeah.
2499.32s:  What do you guys think?
2500.32s:  I'll throw it in as a poll.
2511.24s:  Positive relation.
2518.24s:  All right, there's your poll.
2537.00s:  We just want to know based on what you see here, what is the relationship?
2544.40s:  And it doesn't tell you, but the context is going to be in terms of correlation.
2548.44s:  That's why you would look at these kinds of things from a statistical perspective.
2553.20s:  So let's see.
2554.20s:  Let's see how accurate we are.
2568.00s:  We're 40 60 split 50 50 split with eight votes.
2573.36s:  How many people are in here?
2575.08s:  There's 20 there's 30 people.
2576.92s:  So as per usual, I would love to get 15 votes.
2580.40s:  So if you're driving, feel free to break the law and swerve around.
2585.44s:  I mean, California, it's all the same, but in order to throw the old, throw the old
2592.36s:  poll answer in, you know, it's good, good to do that.
2595.48s:  Obviously, don't do that.
2597.32s:  But we have 11 votes were four away.
2600.64s:  Feel free to double vote double votes.
2602.36s:  Okay, you can't double vote.
2604.00s:  That's a joke.
2605.00s:  But we just love to get 15 words still were just four away from 15.
2613.76s:  That would be fantastic if we're at 15.
2622.88s:  Give it another couple seconds.
2626.12s:  I might have to settle with 12 breaks my heart because this is now a statistically insignificant.
2633.56s:  13.
2634.56s:  We're so close.
2636.36s:  Two more.
2638.36s:  We are we're right on the cusp here.
2642.60s:  I'll give another couple seconds and then we'll move on.
2647.60s:  Very close though.
2652.36s:  Okay, I'm going to end the poll 13.
2655.16s:  So what I would love is somebody that says positive correlation to explain why and then
2664.80s:  somebody that says non correlation to explain why.
2670.44s:  I would love to know from both perspectives here.
2674.00s:  Now for those that say there's not enough information that's inaccurate.
2679.12s:  So I saw somebody mentioned that above and that's not correct.
2686.12s:  So somebody that says positive why somebody that said negative why.
2702.08s:  Tommy says your thoughts on tuna melt tuna melts can hit the spot.
2705.36s:  You have to be like in a really specific set up for it.
2710.24s:  But that's yeah, tuna melts can be banger.
2714.48s:  That car eye changes from that's not enough to the sample sizes, not enough.
2719.12s:  No, that you can still you can still answer this question given this information.
2723.68s:  You absolutely can again, I already told you and equals 15.
2727.20s:  I actually use it for the poll.
2728.92s:  We can't use our sample technically, but this is a completely fine sample size.
2735.84s:  Vladimir says I'm biased when it rains, I have no pain.
2739.68s:  That Lawrence says pain in rain would be the same.
2743.44s:  Nope.
2746.28s:  So nobody has any ideas.
2749.28s:  There's not anybody that can explain either why they believe it's positively correlated or
2755.68s:  non.
2759.20s:  Gib says non correlation, my logic is that there doesn't seem to be an algorithm to it.
2763.96s:  An okay assumption, but that's still not really an explanation.
2768.60s:  Reese says no, I just felt bullied into voting.
2770.72s:  That's probably the most reasonable answer so far.
2773.28s:  I'm glad.
2775.84s:  Cedric says more people have pain on no rain.
2782.28s:  Okay.
2785.00s:  I think we're getting there.
2791.96s:  I think we're getting there.
2794.20s:  Tommy says pain slash rain is positively expected, not so much.
2801.48s:  So let's see how to answer this.
2804.60s:  I don't know.
2805.24s:  I'll see in a second if they have an answer on their website.
2810.36s:  I'm going to do it with you then because I actually don't know if they have an answer.
2814.36s:  But let's take a look at scenario together.
2817.88s:  That yellow is hard to see, I think.
2820.28s:  So let me grab.
2829.64s:  It doesn't feel like the number of people reporting on rainy days is significant.
2835.48s:  Well, rainy days, or do you mean non rainy days?
2838.84s:  Because rainy days is enough.
2845.64s:  So let's take a look.
2847.32s:  Now, a lot of people and you guys actually believe, oh, there is an answer here.
2853.56s:  This is perfect.
2855.08s:  I just realized that there's a community.
2858.28s:  Rather than me, they literally have an answer drop down.
2863.64s:  So let me copy this in.
2876.52s:  Here's your answer.
2880.04s:  So the answer says many people will answer that a positive correlation exists between pain
2885.88s:  and rainy days, which our sample actually confirms that.
2890.68s:  The majority of you felt that.
2894.84s:  And the rationale they explain why people do this is in judging the relationship,
2901.88s:  many people mistakenly overweight the positive cases relative to all other cases.
2908.44s:  As a result, they mistakenly conclude that the two events are positively correlated.
2912.68s:  In fact, in this example, it a slight negative correlation exists.
2917.80s:  Two-third of people feel pain on rainy days, whereas three-quarters of people feel pain on days with no rain.
2927.48s:  So what's happening here is where just and just for you guys that don't know,
2936.68s:  in both my undergrad and grad, I spent a lot of time doing different kinds of studies like this
2943.40s:  because there's a lot of statistical analysis that goes into this.
2946.68s:  Vladimir says, two to one pain with rain, three to one pain without rain, non-correlated.
2950.52s:  It's actually not correlated either.
2952.68s:  As this points out, it's slightly inverse correlated.
2956.36s:  And the reason for that is, again, it's not just based on the raw numbers.
2961.64s:  It's based on the relative numbers that you see here.
2965.48s:  So you can see the total number of instances where there's rain.
2969.64s:  Then you can see the total number of instances where there's no rain.
2973.08s:  Then you can see the total number of instances where there's pain and versus no pain.
2977.40s:  And you can then put it into a percentage term to then make a actual analysis of things.
2985.64s:  So I'm actually curious what this talks about more though. I haven't read this before.
2991.16s:  This says this thinking is an example of a lusinary correlation atop of confirmation bias
2995.96s:  and decision making. Searching for information or interpreting information in a way that
3000.04s:  supports our perceptions can lead to a biased outcome. Experiments designed to prove not
3005.08s:  to prove a theory can result in erroneous conclusions about the accuracy of the theory.
3010.20s:  In the example above, considering the situations where the relationship between pain and rain
3015.80s:  does not exist is equally relevant to determining the correlation between the events.
3020.20s:  In pricing securities, it's important to find information that supports our estimates of the
3024.36s:  fair price. But it is also important to search for information that dis confirms our estimates.
3029.88s:  Guess what? Anybody that is followed the outlier channel and way of thinking for a while,
3039.08s:  when we're searching and scanning for a trade, what's one of the main processes that I talk about?
3045.64s:  There's a very specific process that I talk about.
3050.76s:  And it's funny because it's this exact thing. I'm going to open the door for Thoroughquay.
3060.20s:  I'm going to open the door.
3074.68s:  Looking for nose. That's what I call it.
3080.28s:  The process of looking for nose is literally this here.
3088.36s:  Considering the situation here, important to search for information that dis confirms our estimates.
3100.12s:  That's the idea of looking for nose. So that's one of the examples of decision making.
3107.00s:  And all this goes back to the trade log because again, over 50% of us up here, we can see
3118.60s:  falsely analyze the data that's provided here. Extrapolate that out and think of our ability
3127.00s:  to accurately recollect the details of a trade and a strategy, the details that are important.
3135.00s:  How good do you think your memory is? And then once you layer on your biases on top of that,
3141.88s:  it makes no sense for somebody to think that they can remember these things.
3149.64s:  And hopefully just piece them together when they need it. It just doesn't make sense.
3154.68s:  Let's do another one.
3159.80s:  Oh, this one's cool.
3166.68s:  All right.
3167.72s:  Next question. Let's play a game. I sound like the dude. What is it? The little, the, the, the, the
3177.72s:  saw guy. That's right. Let's play. I want to play a game. Right down the last two digits of your
3184.12s:  social security number. You don't share it in the chat. Just keep it to yourself.
3188.20s:  Do you think that the average temperature in chug water, Wyoming is higher or lower than this
3195.56s:  number in degrees Fahrenheit? Now explain why you believe the average, what you believe,
3204.92s:  the average annual temperature is in chug water, Wyoming. So this is going to be one that you have
3212.76s:  to do on your own. But think about it for a second. And then I'll give you the answer.
3226.44s:  Okay. Let me grab the screenshot for the answer.
3239.32s:  And be honest.
3247.56s:  Reece says, is this to make options seem easier by comparison? It's not actually. This is
3252.84s:  to elucidate the point on why you need a trade log because you and everybody else myself included
3260.20s:  are riddled with so many different kind of mental biases when it comes to analyzing information
3268.52s:  that you need to have a system to objectively and quantifiably track and assess ideas because you
3278.60s:  cannot do it as an individual person nor can I nor can anybody else. It literally is not a thing.
3286.04s:  So this says, how does your answer to the second question relate to the first one? The two numbers
3292.60s:  are completely unrelated and the last two digits of your social security number should have no
3297.00s:  influence on your answer to the temperature in chug water. In tests, well, all right. Well, you
3304.04s:  guys already know what's next. In case you know, it's really cheap to get there. That's kind of cool.
3319.48s:  But we need to see what's going on in chug. Wow. Holy shit.
3323.80s:  All right. So there is seven streets in chug water. Let's go check out chug. Oh,
3336.44s:  damn, bro. These guys are. These guys are in it.
3343.96s:  All right. Let's make a little more progress here. Let's get into lovely chug water.
3361.48s:  Okay. Here it is, gang. Welcome to chug water.
3374.44s:  I thought they would have like a population sign population like four. All right. What do we have here?
3382.12s:  What is this?
3384.68s:  Chili. Hey, tug water. Chili. I like that.
3391.48s:  I can get down with some chili.
3395.56s:  Well tea. Wheel tea. Well tea service. A couple grain silos.
3404.36s:  All right. Let's get down main strip here.
3411.48s:  Look at the town hall.
3417.08s:  Yo, this is nuts. Is that the post office? There it is. Yo, this place is crazy.
3429.16s:  There it. Don't park here. Listen, don't park here. There's no parking here. If you
3438.84s:  you park here, there's going to be big trouble.
3444.04s:  The fact that there's even a no parking sign here is if there's like enough cars to park here.
3449.72s:  Is nuts. Okay. So now I know what chug water looks like. That makes me happy.
3455.72s:  Back to this though.
3460.04s:  Individuals with higher social security numbers submit higher estimates of the chug water
3463.64s:  temperature and example of anchoring. The error of assessing numbers or probabilities based
3467.88s:  on a reference point, which overly influences anchors the estimate. So just another bias.
3475.72s:  There's a couple others in there. We're not going to go through all of them.
3479.56s:  My main goal here is for you to take away the primary point that I'm sharing here is that
3489.64s:  the idea of not maintaining a log and expecting to have good outcomes going forward
3496.28s:  is not super great. It's not super great. And that's the whole goal of the session today
3504.60s:  is to spend a little time building a log. So let's talk about how to build a trade log.
3512.36s:  The first thing here is you'll notice that I talk about essentially the outlier strategy process.
3522.60s:  Profit mechanism, profit mechanism, subtype or sub profit mechanism or whatever version of that.
3528.36s:  Really, I like to think of PMS here. That's why I like putting subtype is because I get to say
3536.44s:  PMS for the abbreviation. And then we need to define the profit mechanism signals PMS again.
3545.64s:  So joking aside, I normally would just do subtype or the qualities of the profit mechanism.
3554.36s:  Like this. So the reason
3564.04s:  Vladimir says last two social synomities can be zero zero and I nine. Anything between
3568.28s:  Wyoming's average temperature is 42. So the changes that Wyoming temperature will be lower.
3575.16s:  You're going off on a complete tangent that's not relative to the question that.
3579.48s:  The because the data sample, you're using a sample of one in terms of the extremes.
3587.16s:  So as you have a larger data sample, the fact that there can be somebody with a zero zero or
3592.92s:  99 is very low or even people that have 90 or 10. Essentially, you can say anybody that has
3601.40s:  the ending numbers of like 30 and below or 70 and above probably don't really contribute much
3610.68s:  to the sample, but they're going to be overwhelmed by the rest of the sample. So it doesn't really matter.
3617.00s:  Anyways, back to this. So we start with these details. Why do we start these details?
3625.80s:  Joey says, wasn't the question just what do you think the average temperature is not if it's higher
3632.04s:  or not? That's correct. What do you think the average temperature is? That's correct.
3637.40s:  What they're doing is they're showing a relationship, a correlation between people that have higher
3645.40s:  or lower social security numbers as the number sets and what their guess is. So people that have a higher
3653.88s:  social security number tend to guess higher. People that have a lower social security number tend to
3659.88s:  guess lower. So they're showing the the process of anchoring. So back here, why do you guys think we
3671.32s:  start with this? With the trade log, why do we start here? When we talked about this yesterday,
3683.16s:  notice how we started making a trade log up here that was literally just based on profit mechanism
3689.80s:  tracking. Why do we do this? It's specifically because like we talk about with the building of a
3706.92s:  strategy, where's that at? Where's that old strategy process at? Here, if you think about the
3718.04s:  strategy process, if you don't have profit mechanisms and their qualities and signals,
3730.12s:  if you don't have that right, none of the rest of this matters. So that's the exact reason why we
3739.80s:  start with those because without this, none of this matters. It's keeping first things first.
3748.60s:  So the way that I think for new traders to build a trade log, ideally, depending on where you're
3756.76s:  at in your trading journey, but for new traders, I would literally start by listing the profit
3763.08s:  mechanisms that you think you're going to try to trade. And then I would create trackers for all of
3771.00s:  them. And what goes into the tracker, it can be something as simple as this. It can be the profit
3779.16s:  mechanism, whatever you think it is, the date that you're coming up with your estimate, the ticker
3784.44s:  that you're looking at, whatever your thesis is, what the timeframe is for your thesis, especially
3790.20s:  if you're an options trader, you have to have a timeframe. And what happened with the outcome?
3795.64s:  Was it positive or negative? Meaning did it match your thesis or not?
3802.28s:  That's it. Then over time, this can evolve. So we can have a thesis, then we can add something like
3811.40s:  a target, then we can add stuff like a probability, those kinds of things.
3823.16s:  But one of the things that you'll notice that I talk about with respect to
3831.64s:  building this, I got to find where we're at again. Oh, damn, un-lost.
3837.16s:  Here we go.
3843.80s:  Is we have to think about the details that matter and inform the strategy?
3851.08s:  Then we want to format for ability to conduct data analysis. And most importantly,
3860.12s:  we want to keep it consumable. So what that means is there's lots of people that when they first
3866.92s:  start thinking of a trading log of some sort, they're like, oh, I'm going to track everything.
3874.28s:  And then guess what happens if you try to track everything? You don't do it.
3880.92s:  Because it's too much work. Because you sit there and think to yourself, I don't want to have to
3885.32s:  put in 92 different inputs to track this one thing.
3898.76s:  So the purpose behind this is to focus on the things that matter to you. So I want to start with
3906.44s:  a profit mechanism tracking example. And I would like you guys to pick the profit mechanism that
3912.76s:  we're going to track. And then we will go through there. Vladimir says regarding
3920.04s:  comprehension is variable cross populations. Dog, we are way past that. If you want to enjoy
3928.92s:  chewing on that bone, go for it. But we're talking about logs now, homie. Okay, so
3935.16s:  Joey says breakouts that Lauren says volume changes. Okay, so we need a couple. We need a couple more
3946.52s:  just so that we can have a tie breaker, whatever the consensus is. So so far, I see breakouts in volume
3953.00s:  changes.
3953.72s:  So let's go up drift. Now we have a third one that's entered the equation.
3969.88s:  Any others, otherwise, I'm just going to have Siri pick a random one. I'm going to assign a,
3974.92s:  B and C to those. You see two for drift.
3982.84s:  All right, two for drift wins. We're going to do it for drift. Profit mechanism tracking.
3990.92s:  So we're literally going to build this together. First, the profit mechanism.
3997.88s:  And again, I'm just going to give you like a small example.
4009.80s:  And then we can build it out over. James says is drift only to the upside or is it also to the
4016.44s:  downside? It's downside for sure. Downsides totally okay. In this case, I'm assuming that they're
4021.96s:  talking about price go up drift. That's kind of natural, but you're 100% correct. So profit
4027.72s:  mechanism here is going to be price, direction, up, quality or in this case, I'll just use subtype.
4047.88s:  I think that's probably a little more relatable to people. Subtype here will be drift.
4058.52s:  So now we have to continue building this out. What other things matter to us? If we're trying
4065.08s:  to trade drift to the upside and we want to measure our ability to capture this profit mechanism,
4074.20s:  what details matter to us? So again, that's what this is. So just brainstorm throw random stuff
4080.92s:  out there to start. And then we will refine it down. So I'm going to move this over here. So it's
4087.00s:  out of our way and we'll start with the brainstorm. So timeframe, okay. That's one of them.
4093.08s:  Velocity. Okay. What other ideas? So again, what I'm asking you is what do you think would be useful
4106.76s:  for you to be able to look at to be able to better trade drift price direction up?
4114.36s:  What details would be useful to you?
4121.32s:  So far we have time frame velocity.
4127.00s:  Reasons behind exactly so catalyst. I love that.
4132.36s:  Float, sure, we can throw that in. Volume, another great one.
4138.92s:  Market events. Long term trends. So, Shrej goes with trends, so kind of more generalized. Okay.
4155.08s:  What other stuff would be helpful to us? Short interest? Sure, we can throw it in there.
4161.16s:  Stock events.
4169.32s:  Market capture. Again, I'm not going to use all these, but I just want to see and put you guys
4174.52s:  through the exercise of thinking of things that you think are useful. Put call skew, sure.
4181.32s:  Sector trend.
4187.88s:  Vladimir is talking about the personality of a ticker. That's good. I hope you can take your tickers
4193.72s:  on a date. Skew, sure. Sector trend we have. Average temp in chug water, Wyoming. I think
4204.36s:  that's probably the most important one that we could possibly list here if I were to categorize it.
4210.44s:  I literally don't know if it gets more important than chug water.
4214.60s:  Chug water.
4222.28s:  Zachary is talking about physical pleasure coming from numbers. I don't know if that's a kink.
4226.68s:  It's probably a kink, but I don't I'm unfamiliar with that as a specific kink. Red it would probably
4232.68s:  be the right place for you. Social media coverage, okay.
4241.16s:  Okay, I think you guys have done a good job building an initial list.
4248.44s:  Let me show you some of the things that I think matter. Joey says distance off highs. That's
4253.80s:  actually exactly one of them.
4270.52s:  Good old 50 day ma slop.
4286.60s:  I don't care about that for drift. I also care about
4292.76s:  okay. So now let's start building this thing. Let's find let's find something.
4308.60s:  And for our example, now again, the reason I'm starting with profit mechanism tracking is because
4315.08s:  if you can get down profit mechanism tracking, then the process of building a log
4322.36s:  for a specific strategy becomes really, really simple, right? So you can see here this is an
4329.08s:  example log for a covered strangle. And the things that I think matter to that in general.
4336.04s:  So this the reason why we're going to spend the majority of the time on the focus topic,
4341.08s:  looking at profit mechanism is I think for the overwhelming majority of you, this is what is
4346.68s:  going to matter the most. Then we can add different kinds of strategies and stuff.
4355.96s:  Reese says how are drift and trend different? Yeah, so trend kind of can apply to different time
4365.08s:  frames drift is a well documented profit mechanism. So the way to think about things that have
4374.44s:  drift trend momentum, there are three different ways to look at a different kind of behavior.
4385.08s:  Drift tends to be much longer term. So when we say the stock market as positive drift,
4390.76s:  we're thinking out generally in years trend tends to be longer term time frames, but not necessarily
4398.36s:  years. It can be sub time frames. It can be one month, six months. It can be years or years for sure.
4405.56s:  And then momentum is typically shorter term time frame. And there's also a difference in the
4412.04s:  velocity of the movement between them when we sub classify between drift and momentum. So drift
4421.24s:  tends to be slower style movements up momentum tends to be more aggressive style moves up
4428.92s:  stair step pattern. So just kind of different construction between them.
4436.44s:  Tommy says is momentum or trend as swing. So swing traders quote unquote, those are people that
4445.00s:  tend to have holding periods of a certain duration generally less than three months. That's like
4450.84s:  a swing trader could be out to six months maybe. But that's more talking about the holding duration
4458.84s:  of things. Yeah, a lot of these terms are really tricky because there's general definitions for them.
4469.24s:  But then there's the way that people generally use them. And there's absolutely a difference between
4475.40s:  those. So it can be a little yeah, it can be a little tricky to to align those. Oh yeah,
4481.72s:  I forgot. I got to get my dinner order going here. I was wondering. I was like, yo, my stomach
4485.88s:  is going. What's happening here? All right. What's for dinner tonight? Let's see if anything speaks to us.
4495.72s:  What do you guys think?
4496.60s:  That Lauren says I'm a swing trader by accident exit strategy. Sus you're not a swing trader.
4507.80s:  What you did in so far is like a two day trade. That's not swing trading.
4515.56s:  Don't come at us with the swing trading stuff. There ain't no way.
4520.04s:  So swing trading is a bit longer in duration than holding for like two days and then paper handing
4530.52s:  out of a trade that's moving in your favor massively. And just kind of exiting as soon as it does.
4539.16s:  Yeah. I'm just not kidding, but you know, I still love you Lauren.
4545.24s:  And we're going to do Carl Strauss, I think we're not going to do a meatball sandwich.
4556.92s:  I don't think we're meatball sandwiches. That's a hot take. That's a real hot take.
4564.20s:  Yeah. We're going. Oh, damn it. Yeah, I'm going to do, I think I'm going to go with a burger.
4578.44s:  Burger sounds right to me.
4585.64s:  Yeah, that all looks good. That looks good.
4588.52s:  Perfect. And then we need these. Perfect. We Gucci.
4609.56s:  Stake freets. I don't really understand the steak freets thing.
4613.48s:  Stake freets is kind of weird to me. I need to calm down so that she looks at the thing.
4630.28s:  But I don't call her if she won't look at it and then there's giant pain in the ass.
4634.60s:  Yeah. Stake freets, I just feel this kind of strange.
4645.64s:  It's like if I have a steak, I would much rather not have fries with that. I would much rather have
4653.08s:  what a terrible time, by the way, for Israel and I ran to start playing this game because I just put
4659.24s:  on an S&P position that's going to get smashed. Joey says, why not? Is she's steak some dipping sauce,
4670.36s:  fries and yeah, it's like I would much rather have like roasted potatoes or mashed potatoes or
4675.56s:  something like that. Some sort of potato. Less so on the French fry front.
4683.64s:  All right. Waiting for Mel to finish her order and then we'll keep running through here.
4690.20s:  I'm going to zoom in a little bit so you can see.
4695.48s:  Reese says the Middle East is all weekend to make up and be friends. Yeah, the problem is the
4699.80s:  market's still going to respond to that. I wish futures were open right now because I would have
4703.48s:  been stopped out already. I bet. But that's not our current state, unfortunately.
4714.04s:  All right. So we have like 40 minutes before dinner gets here plenty of time.
4724.68s:  All right. Oh, Spanish Ration chicken. I love that. My mom makes a super, super good
4729.40s:  Spanish Ration chicken. Big, big fan. Big, big fan. All right. So here's how I would build this
4739.64s:  profit mechanism tracking for price direction drift up. And this really would apply to just
4745.40s:  about anything, but I'm going to add a series of things in terms of the way that this is built.
4751.40s:  So it's kind of easier to track. So this would be entry date. This would be
4758.92s:  picker. Then I would add for drift. We can add a few things. I'm going to break this up into
4771.96s:  a couple different versions. I'm going to do a light version, which is what I would consider
4777.32s:  to be like bare bones minimal acceptable. So that because again, like I know a lot of people
4783.96s:  compliance is difficult in terms of doing this stuff. So I'm trying to make it so that
4790.04s:  there's different versions that you can use. And we can talk about why the details matter more
4797.48s:  than others and whatnot. So entry date ticker. I'm trying to think of like up to five inputs.
4807.56s:  Now in terms of like what we calculate, that's easy because once the calculations are made,
4813.48s:  the calculations are easy, right? And you'd like I think about inputs as the spot that I have to be
4819.64s:  really selective here. The reason why I think that is the case is inputs are what you manually are
4826.92s:  going to have to look at. What's calculated is automatically going to be calculated. So it's
4830.36s:  literally no skin off your back. So we're going to have entry date ticker. We'll have underlying price
4836.44s:  or stock prices. I typically would write it. And then I would have a target. I would have a time frame.
4845.64s:  I would have something to track signals. But again, I would track a bunch of these signals.
4855.24s:  I would boil this down to whatever the most pertinent signals are. So signal one, signal two,
4866.04s:  whatever those are, I would define those. And we can for the sake of drift, in this case,
4873.08s:  signal one could be percent off 52 week highs. Signal two can be
4884.28s:  three MA alignment. And then these would be defined obviously by the trader. The reason why
4893.08s:  I'm building this the way that I am is going back to this format for data analysis. A lot of people
4903.72s:  they would have a section here called like indicators. And then they would start writing. They would
4907.88s:  say 10 day MA is positive sloping with price above the keyboards off to the side to the typing
4918.84s:  terrible with price above 50 day MA is below the 20 day. Like this. You can't analyze this
4929.72s:  in a broad scale. You like it's a fucking nightmare. I'm not saying don't include that. But I would
4936.60s:  keep that to a minimum. And I would keep that relegated to a few spots. The majority of what
4943.08s:  I'm building here is specifically so that I can easily I can very, very easily I need to wrap the
4952.12s:  texture. I can easily see what I'm trying to filter by and I can look at it all at once. So
4961.00s:  in this case, and we'll look at it in example in a second. So then indicators. This is not that.
4968.44s:  MA alignment. Okay. And then the other thing I do is I actually pay pretty close attention
4980.20s:  to ordering of things so that it makes the most sense. So do you notice how I just reordered that?
4986.92s:  And it's because I have a feeling when I'm developing my price target.
4992.28s:  I'm trying to build a price target. I will have consulted the distance off of 52 week highs
5001.24s:  and the alignment of the three MAs that I'm going to use. The other thing that I would do here
5008.44s:  is I would post a comment and I would say MA one is 10 day MA two is 20 day MA three
5021.96s:  is 50 day again. If you are switching between indicators, you're testing in 11 day MA compared to a
5031.64s:  nine, those kinds of things. That's why this note is important. If you have a standard suite of tools,
5037.80s:  then you don't need to put the note, but the note's not going to hurt you. Okay. So this is the entry
5044.84s:  criteria. Then we have exit date, exit price. Again, this is the light version. This is what I
5058.28s:  would consider to be the minimal viable product. Now the way that I tend to build this
5067.56s:  would be like this. This would all start like that. This would be colored differently so that I
5081.08s:  know that these are exiting inputs. And then over here, I would color these differently
5087.40s:  so that I can track stuff like I can't tell if it's writing in there. There we go. Good old tit.
5102.76s:  So this would be time in trade. The next thing I would track would be
5123.56s:  before here actually. I forgot there's no cost. There's no strategy. So normally when I'm building
5136.20s:  this before this would be a cost thing, but that's going to be based on the individual strategy which
5141.08s:  we're not tracking for now. We're just tracking the profit mechanism. So we see exit date, exit price.
5149.48s:  Now what metrics would be useful for us to calculate to see how well we did.
5163.80s:  Time in trade is one of them.
5171.08s:  That law says do you always have an exit date and price? Yes. I always have an exit date and price.
5176.20s:  The reason why I care about exit date and prices because it allows me to track the movement
5181.24s:  of the underlying while I'm in the trade. P&L, that's good. So P&L,
5189.56s:  relic, that's fine. What other stuff would be useful here if anything?
5206.84s:  James says track when slash loss percent expected return if it exists. That would be at the strategy level.
5214.60s:  So I agree with you. This is looking at the individual profit mechanism in its occurrences.
5221.56s:  So then what I would build is an actual tab that lets me track the performance of the profit mechanism
5230.36s:  itself. So here we're just tracking all of these different profit mechanisms.
5240.84s:  Recess percent of portfolio, there's no position here so that's not a thing yet.
5248.28s:  Joey says thesis was correct. Sort of, right, because P&L would automatically do that for us.
5256.52s:  So we don't need to track that here.
5267.88s:  Vladimir says if anybody's interested, there are Excel trade log templates that can be downloaded
5271.80s:  or printed. If you track with pen and paper, I couldn't recommend against that enough.
5277.32s:  And the reason why I couldn't recommend against that enough is simply because you cannot do data
5283.08s:  analysis on pen and paper stuff. So for those that track on pen and paper, I would mega highly
5292.76s:  encourage you to not do that and to track it on Excel or Google sheets or something like that.
5302.68s:  Tommy says occurrences of the PM. That's at the strategy level. I would agree there.
5308.68s:  But that's not here. Vladimir says Lauren says she's pen and paper. Yeah, so Lauren,
5313.56s:  don't do that. Use Google sheets or Excel. Whoever, yeah, for sure. Don't, don't do.
5319.64s:  Pen and paper is it's doing the work of trading, of using a trade log. And it's not really giving
5326.52s:  you access to the benefit, which is the ability to analyze things in a large scale. So yeah, don't do
5334.12s:  that. Okay, so I would actually argue in the beginning, this is absolutely fine. Like I actually
5344.36s:  wouldn't start adding a bunch more here. There's one thing I would add over here. And again, normally,
5351.00s:  this would be in two different spots. This would be entry notes.
5363.16s:  Exit notes. So this is the place where if you want
5381.56s:  to be able to put your thoughts in, I would do those here. Like I said, there's no reason
5387.80s:  to not include them. The problem people have when they do trade notes like this is they put too
5395.08s:  many details that they would have wanted. Now, there's a couple other things from a calculation
5401.08s:  standpoint that I think make a lot of sense. So the first thing I would say that makes a lot of
5406.76s:  sense is percent to price target. That's a really important one. The other thing that we're missing
5424.36s:  here, return an avesi capital, that's more from like a trading perspective, which is okay, meaning
5432.84s:  if this was an actual position versus tracking the profit mechanism itself. So just essentially
5437.88s:  equate this to percent move, I think that's okay. The other thing, yeah, I think that this is fine
5449.96s:  to start from like a minimal viable perspective. I think this is fine.
5453.32s:  So then the whole point of this is you can turn this one template into something that tracks
5464.92s:  everything. So for example, I would change the three MA alignment and I would not make this yes or
5476.60s:  no. I would label this as bowl or bear. And then in here, I would update this note. I would say
5489.08s:  bowl equals 10 over 20 over 50. And then I would actually put price above all of them.
5500.36s:  Bear equals 50, 20 and price in terms of alignment. So that now, let's say I do later on, I want to
5515.40s:  start tracking price direction down, drift. I can literally use this same exact thing. And I can track
5530.76s:  all in one spot. And by doing this, I can then start summarizing like you guys are talking about.
5537.08s:  So for example, at the top of this, I could list out my profit mechanisms, each one. So this could be
5547.96s:  something like equals probably a little higher equals unique. And I can just list out the unique stuff
5559.48s:  that occurs. Right. So this is again, I'm using formulas. And then I can do count. So the number of
5568.36s:  times it happens, number of wins, number of losses, average win, average, oops.
5580.84s:  And then I can just list out the numbers.
5585.80s:  Average win size, average loss size, and so on and so forth.
5598.68s:  And the cool part about setting it up this way is I can start tracking using the inputs here
5608.12s:  and have a summary at the top. So the other one I can do is the average tip, an important one.
5617.96s:  That kind of stuff.
5624.92s:  Joey says if you use chips for data validation, it can be pretty formatted too. So you don't have to
5629.64s:  type either. It's just a drop down. Yeah, the drop downs are good. And depending on how much
5636.36s:  freedom you ultimately want to have, then that's totally cool. Because the other thing that I will
5642.12s:  always do is add a filter here. So that now I can filter by, let's say I just want price direction
5652.52s:  up. Let's say I had a bunch of them. I can just see the price direction ups. These are a little more
5659.00s:  like doing it this way is a little more friendly to formatting changes, right. Because if you
5664.04s:  start doing stuff like chips and drop downs, it can be a little more annoying as you ebb and flow
5670.92s:  with the details that you want to include. So your homework for this weekend is to build a
5681.08s:  profit mechanism tracking log. That's your homework. And again, this is the light version.
5691.48s:  This is designed to be minimal viable product so that it's not difficult or annoying to build and maintain.
5703.32s:  That's your homework here. Now, when we start building a specific structure and strategy,
5712.28s:  that's slightly different, which is what we'll talk about now. So this inherently is going to
5717.56s:  track the signals as well by looking at this. So this almost becomes like one of the things that I
5725.16s:  would absolutely want to track is the average return by percent off highs. So then you can start doing
5739.88s:  a little bit of correlation analysis to see if percent off of highs actually has some sort of
5746.52s:  correlation with the average return of the trade. And this is how you can use higher level summaries
5754.20s:  to then inform strategy choices. Zachary says, do you use RSS minimally? The reason is like, for
5763.64s:  example, you could easily codify something like this. So you could do equals,
5769.00s:  Google finance, and then you could do whatever the ticker is. And then there's a command. I forgot
5774.68s:  exactly how it goes, but it's like 52 week highs or some shit, 52 week, I, whatever the fuck it is,
5781.16s:  I don't remember. But there's a specific operator that you can do to have it pull it. I think it's
5788.20s:  better to look at it personally. So here's your profit mechanism tracking. And then this would be
5797.40s:  up there. And then this column would go away. Any questions on this is it sits. This is literally
5808.52s:  all you need to start like literally. If you have this, you can start making decisions that are
5815.32s:  based on actual information. Like this is like literally all you need to start.
5830.12s:  Any questions here.
5836.04s:  And then if not, we'll take a look at strategy.
5838.76s:  That Lauren says, I have to take a class in this Google Docs crap. I will but tracking with paper
5850.52s:  now and we'll input once I figured out. Yeah. So exactly like Tommy said, you can either use
5857.32s:  Google Docs or some like chat GPT to help you or like literally just follow along with what we're
5862.76s:  doing here. If you open up a Google sheet and do what I'm doing as I'm doing it, then you're not
5868.68s:  talking to birds out of the air with one stone because you're learning. But then you also literally
5874.60s:  have live support is as you're trying to do this stuff. You actually get three birds as I think
5882.60s:  about it because then it's also not something that's added to the do to the to do list. It's done.
5888.52s:  You're doing it as it's happening. So then you don't have it to do. It's fucking done. And then you
5893.64s:  just start filling it in. Okay. So now let's do the next version of this, which is strategy.
5905.72s:  So this is profit mechanism tracking. This will be strategy. Now this would be on another tab.
5914.12s:  So let's actually let's try to make this a little more how it would be specifically. So this
5923.64s:  would be here. This would be called PM tracking. And then this would be down here. I would start it
5936.84s:  at like n. Oops. And then this would be up here.
5954.60s:  And I would do the math for all this stuff up here.
5964.60s:  And then this would be a strategy, which again, like I'm actually going to delete this.
5987.80s:  We literally have a strategy right here. This is already done. And we've been looking at this one.
5992.92s:  So for the strategy, this is for coverage strangles. And notice how I have the little summary thing up top.
6003.56s:  I have multiple coverage strangles. I don't have anything on an hyg. I'm probably not going to put
6008.68s:  anything on in there for this. That Lauren says, Reese, can I do Google sheets on a MacBook?
6014.52s:  You absolutely can. Yeah. So Google sheets is through the through the browser itself.
6019.00s:  You can access Google sheets through Safari. You don't even have to use Chrome. Yeah.
6026.12s:  You 100% can. So here we have the coverage triangle. This is just an example.
6035.32s:  So let's build a simple version of something. What strategy do we want to try to build?
6042.20s:  I'm thinking something like, well, I don't know what you guys trade the most. Maybe long long options.
6058.36s:  Ratio call diagonal. I mean, I already have I've shown you guys examples of those to be honest.
6065.80s:  I'm trying to think of something that would be applicable to the to the largest number of people.
6069.48s:  So which would probably be my guess is. Yeah, my guess is single options.
6084.28s:  And this can be something that's like really, really simple.
6091.64s:  Or it can be something that's less simple.
6094.36s:  So let's think of stuff that matters for single options. We can do something like date. Oh, hold on.
6117.64s:  Looks like there's a fake person.
6124.60s:  Hold on. I try to take care of these people super quicks. I don't like them being on the discord.
6132.92s:  Were you a little bastard?
6140.36s:  No, it doesn't look like they're in the discord.
6154.68s:  Okay.
6165.96s:  Reese says long long or long with a short. I use the ratio, but most commonly people don't. Yeah, for sure.
6173.80s:  Okay, so let's let's think about the details that are important for long single options. So we'll have
6179.88s:  an entry date. We'll have a ticker. We'll have an expiration. I'm just kind of spitballing here
6185.24s:  and then we can refine it. And I'm trying to think of it in terms of the way that I would input the data.
6194.36s:  So the reason why expiration comes early is because well, I guess we can move this over a little bit
6200.04s:  ticker. So this would be target. Then this would be what do we want to do? We don't really need.
6217.08s:  I'm trying to keep it super light. So I guess for this, we could either do signal, one,
6230.44s:  two,
6238.68s:  target expiration. Then we can do lots, meaning trade size. And then we could do long call delta,
6250.84s:  long put delta so that we can do either long calls or long puts. I mean, realistically, we could
6256.44s:  also do short options. So we could do short put delta, long put delta, short call delta,
6266.04s:  long call delta. Now again, for me, I would actually organize these. So it would be whatever I think
6272.76s:  I would do the most. So for example, if I'm not selling a bunch of calls, that would go over there.
6278.60s:  If I'm not buying a bunch of puts, that would go over there. If I'm mostly selling puts and
6284.76s:  buying calls, it would be like this, which is kind of more accurate for what I typically do.
6290.20s:  At least for single options. Then we would need a premium. And then we would need some sort of
6302.36s:  margin requirement. We would need a loss target. We would need a loss amount.
6311.00s:  And then we would need a loss amount. I would just call this risk. Then we would need exit date.
6321.88s:  Then we would need a close price.
6328.84s:  These are the manual inputs.
6332.60s:  And again, there's a bit more that I think we can build this out to.
6342.76s:  But to keep it, what I would consider to be the most important things to start,
6350.20s:  it's something like this.
6351.32s:  Joey says underlying price. Sort of. Like you actually don't even really need that technically.
6363.48s:  I think it's good to have. So this would be ticker price. The only reason I say that is because
6371.88s:  you can come up with a lot of background ways to find things. But I think in the beginning,
6378.20s:  it's probably better to have it. So I'm saying pages you.
6387.72s:  And then like you could put strike price or something, but you don't need strike price. Delta covers that.
6397.00s:  This is again, just for like trading single options that I'm expecting to hold for a little bit.
6402.12s:  And then looking to get out. So I'm not looking to build this super robust thing like we have,
6408.04s:  not that this is super robust, but slightly more robust thing that we have here. Because these are
6413.56s:  literally really short term occurrences. Like either I'm going to be right or I'm going to be wrong.
6419.40s:  And that's about all that's going to go on here. So these are all manual inputs, manual inputs.
6426.76s:  And then these are at the exit. And then from here, you can calculate the first thing I would do is
6439.80s:  like cost or entry price. The reason I do entry price instead of cost because we have long
6448.76s:  and short options. So it's kind of agnostic to that. So it would be entry price.
6456.92s:  DTE. And again, these are things that are now going to be calculated. So we can be a little more.
6470.68s:  We can be a little more aggressive with what kind of stuff we track. As long as it's stuff that you're
6477.80s:  going to look at. So the other thing I would do here is I know those are going to be really small inputs
6483.56s:  because Delta is a small number. So I can squish those down to give me more room. Because another
6488.28s:  thing is I don't like having to scroll too much. So I wouldn't want to have a bunch of stuff over
6495.40s:  to the side that I have to scroll. I would try to format stuff so that it's small and insignificant
6503.00s:  enough so that I don't have to do that. So we have days in trade, time in trade,
6511.64s:  then we would have a return on risk.
6517.96s:  And this is at the beginning. So this is looking at the opportunity itself. Because the other
6524.04s:  thing that again, I would add on optionally would be here, which is probability of target
6544.60s:  and then probability of loss target. I'll either do PLT or P loss.
6552.44s:  And then sometimes instead of probability of target, we could do probability of profit.
6563.24s:  That Lauren says, how do you find a target? It's a ballpark. So we'll look at an example here
6568.84s:  together in a second actually so that we could do it together. So we'll have a return on risk,
6575.08s:  we'll have rowic, we'll have exit cost, we're exit value again to keep it neutral.
6587.00s:  Then we will have P and L.
6594.68s:  And then again, the way that I typically would do this is this would be down a little bit
6601.64s:  like this. And the reason why I do that is so that it's out of the way so that I can do
6608.76s:  portfolio level summaries at the top. So for example, here what I can do is
6621.80s:  I would do something like long call, long put, short call, short put,
6631.24s:  and then I can do that same thing I've shown.
