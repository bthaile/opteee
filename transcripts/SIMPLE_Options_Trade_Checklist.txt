0.04s: let's talk about a simple pre-trade
2.08s: checklist that I'm going to share with
4.60s: you all the goal of this video is to
6.92s: give you the framework for a checklist
10.00s: that is indepth enough to make sure that
13.04s: we're not making stupid errors but not
15.84s: so in depth that it won't be used I
18.88s: found that to be a big problem for me
20.48s: when I first started trading is I would
22.88s: have all these great ideas on what I
24.76s: wanted to look at and what I thought was
26.80s: important but then I'd run into the
28.60s: issue of it became so burdensome that I
31.76s: wouldn't use it so if something although
35.24s: might be super detailed and have
36.92s: everything that you could possibly need
38.20s: in it it's completely useless if it's
40.08s: not usable so this video is designed to
43.16s: strike a happy medium I encourage you to
46.04s: add or remove things as you find suits
50.04s: your needs the main thing I think about
52.40s: with pre-trade post-trade checklists is
55.40s: that in the beginning it should be a
57.48s: very manual process where we follow each
60.52s: step but then over time as you develop
63.44s: the skill set and the habits you don't
65.96s: really have to have an actual checklist
69.04s: that you are tick boox and filling out
71.96s: in that manner I don't do that anymore
73.92s: myself but I generally follow this
76.36s: process so what's up everybody welcome
78.96s: back to all the outliers and a shout out
80.32s: to the patreon family you guys make
82.36s: content like this possible so let's get
84.68s: straight to it up front broad screen so
87.64s: let me lay some context here the idea
89.64s: behind behind this video in the
92.04s: pre-trade checklist is that you've
94.36s: already found a trade that you're
96.08s: interested in so we found something that
98.96s: you want to put a position on and then
100.92s: this would be the next series of steps
103.52s: that go along with it now quick admin
106.24s: not if you are't sure how to find a
108.52s: trade that you want to put on I'll throw
110.88s: a video in the notes below that
113.04s: specifically dies into scanning for
114.96s: trades but we are just moving on past
117.48s: that phase so from a broad screening
120.72s: perspective the very first thing is is
123.32s: the product liquid this is kind of the
125.88s: easiest exonerating factor for a trade
128.88s: and the way that I think about these
130.76s: kind of pre-trade checklists is this now
134.64s: I'll give you a second to soak this in
136.24s: because I know that the artwork here
137.96s: might be overwhelming it might spur some
140.44s: sort of visceral emotional reaction as
142.68s: you Feast your eyes and gaze upon the
144.72s: greatness that is whatever this thing is
147.08s: it's a work of art but what I'm trying
149.04s: to show you is a fun
150.64s: so what I try to do is apply these big
153.48s: screening factors up front so that I get
156.20s: rid of a bunch of stuff without wasting
158.64s: time this is a really efficient way to
161.28s: go about looking at any sort of position
163.96s: so liquidity is kind of the biggest
166.72s: thing I can put up top that will get rid
169.40s: of a ton of things right out of the gate
171.96s: so if you find something that you really
173.52s: like but it's not liquid too bad time to
175.28s: move on now there are different ways you
177.36s: can gauge liquidity bid ask spread
179.60s: spefic specifically for the options
180.88s: Traders is an important concept here so
183.36s: if we take a look at something like TLT
185.48s: what you'll notice is on a standard
187.92s: expiration a weekly expiration it's a
190.28s: $98 product and the bid ask spread is
193.68s: essentially 3 cents very small and if
196.24s: you don't know what good liquidity looks
198.32s: like there's a few things to keep an
199.80s: eyeball for obviously the bidas spread
202.16s: the number of shares that trade in a
204.08s: given day open interest is another good
206.88s: indication whether or not it has weeklys
209.88s: because they won't offer weeklys unless
212.20s: there's demand for those expiration
214.24s: Cycles stuff like that and you have to
215.84s: figure out what makes sense for you the
217.20s: one thing I can make sure is important
220.32s: to share with you not really sure if I
222.76s: can make sure makes sense but one thing
225.00s: I can say unequivocally is that if
228.08s: something is not going through a
229.60s: volatile period this is as good as it
232.00s: gets and if volatility starts to spike
235.04s: markets widen considerably so if you're
237.64s: looking at something that's not going
238.96s: through a super vol period and you're
240.64s: like man this is kind of a liquid it
242.72s: gets insanely worse if volatility kicks
245.76s: up so you should be aware of that when
247.12s: you're thinking about liquidity now the
249.32s: next few things don't necessarily tell
252.28s: us whether or not the trade goes on or
254.00s: not but it informs our decision and our
257.12s: thoughts about the trade the first one
259.08s: is does the individual product have any
261.68s: upcoming announcements does it have
263.44s: earnings coming up and those are
265.56s: important details for example if you're
268.08s: like oh man I really want to put a to
269.84s: trade on in FedEx for whatever reason I
272.60s: love it here and you're not aware that
275.04s: it has earnings coming up you are
276.92s: stepping in front of pretty significant
279.32s: risk and you're none the wiser so when
281.32s: you're trading individual stocks looking
283.32s: for earnings is important notice how on
285.60s: the last earning cycle here it had this
287.88s: big gap you should be aware if something
290.60s: has earnings coming up the main time I
292.76s: see this hurting Traders is when they're
294.44s: looking for volatility you're looking
296.40s: for your running scans that are looking
298.84s: for things with high implied volatility
301.04s: and a lot of times that's going to be
302.64s: around an earnings event or an
304.08s: announcement of some sort maybe it's a
305.88s: biotech stock and you don't connect
308.96s: those dots and then all of a sudden now
310.72s: you're putting a trade on that's going
311.96s: to take you through a binary event
313.60s: that's kind of a problem the next thing
315.44s: is are there any broad Market events
317.24s: this will impact trades differently but
320.24s: you should be aware of what's coming up
322.88s: on the week ahead a great tool to use
325.68s: for this I really like them is called
328.12s: Financial juice and I am an affiliate
331.36s: for them there's a link to their
333.20s: platform in the notes below this isn't
334.84s: sponsored by them or anything it's just
336.04s: a good product and you don't have to
337.36s: sign up you can get it without signing
339.08s: in I like the sound of that but this
341.44s: will tell you what's coming up on the
342.92s: week ahead and the cool thing I really
345.04s: like about this website is that if you
346.60s: click so for example we have on 19th
348.80s: December the housing starts if we click
350.52s: that it'll take you to the corresponding
352.80s: website which I think is really slick I
355.12s: love that a lot that's why I actually
357.24s: started offering to be an affiliate for
358.84s: them cuz I use them for a long time
360.40s: before that and I was like I like
361.64s: sharing good tools but like I said the
363.24s: video is not sponsored by them it's just
364.40s: a solid product but things like fomc
367.16s: statements right now in the current
368.88s: market environment they're massive have
370.80s: huge impacts on things however in 2016
375.20s: the fomc rate statement didn't really
377.52s: have a whole lot going on it didn't
379.12s: impact the markets that much so you do
381.16s: have to be in tune with what's relevant
383.08s: at a given point in time and what the
384.60s: market cares about now the last thing
386.80s: here before we get into the rest of the
388.48s: checklist is what does my portfolio need
391.00s: now when we're scanning for trades I
392.68s: always have a big process that's driven
395.40s: by this and this belongs in your pre-
397.48s: trade checklist as well and the primary
399.36s: reason is this if you find the greatest
402.32s: trade that you've ever found but your
404.92s: portfolio doesn't need that risk it
408.08s: doesn't go on that's all there is to it
410.24s: so it's important to make sure that
411.96s: we're always keeping this portfolio
413.60s: Concept in mind when we're looking at
415.60s: these different trades Okay cool so the
417.88s: next step here is kind of hypothesis
420.44s: generation and confirmation for me at
423.24s: this stage I already know what the trade
425.12s: is that I'm thinking about putting On
426.68s: Loosely I haven't gone through the
427.88s: details of structuring it but a couple
430.04s: things I want to make sure I'm
431.84s: considering the first one is is this
433.48s: some sort of opportunistic trade or am I
435.64s: looking for specific exposure and to
438.16s: make sure that this trade fits this
440.72s: question and still fits within the BR
443.44s: portfolio this matters because the way
445.88s: that I size things the way I scan for
448.92s: correlation
450.08s: for things is really based on this The
452.64s: Next Step here in hypothesis generation
454.92s: is what is your hypothesis blanket and
459.04s: how does the trade work this is
461.00s: important because some Traders have a
463.64s: hard time getting specific with this
465.76s: kind of stuff and what I'm talking about
468.08s: is going back to this example maybe you
469.76s: want to trade FedEx for some reason and
471.24s: you think it's going to go up your
472.68s: hypothesis then would be I am bullish in
475.16s: FedEx I think it's going to go up
477.88s: potentially X number of points over the
480.76s: next X time frame those details are
483.80s: important specifically when you're
485.12s: trading options because every single
487.12s: option trade you put on is time bound so
489.96s: you have to get comfortable integrating
492.52s: a time element to your hypothesis and
495.92s: this leads down to the next point which
498.76s: is what is the breadth of analysis and
502.24s: does that line up with your hypothesis
505.04s: so when you start going through this
506.76s: trade again for example FedEx we think
509.16s: it's to go up as I start overlaying my
511.64s: technical analysis okay I have a
514.00s: ascending 9-day moving average the gap
516.24s: between the 9 the 50 and the 200 are
518.28s: widening they're all positively sloping
520.48s: it's near a plus two linear aggression
522.20s: Channel which I wouldn't love yada y y
524.40s: the whole point here is you might look
526.44s: at something and make a judgment call
528.32s: but it's super important to go much
530.84s: further into detail to see and make sure
534.68s: that the Confluence of evidence that
536.24s: you're looking up marries up beautifully
539.08s: with what whatever your hypothesis is
541.00s: and sometimes you might find out that
542.60s: what you originally thought actually
544.12s: doesn't look that great and if you need
545.80s: some ideas on how I go about technical
548.16s: analysis you could check out this video
549.68s: here and if you couldn't tell this
551.64s: beautiful handwriting is actually from a
554.48s: free download which I'll also throw that
556.60s: in the notes below for you to check out
558.00s: to get this exact pre-trade checklist if
560.96s: you don't know I have to say that slow
562.24s: because I dork it up if I say pre-trade
564.52s: too fast yeah pretty much a smooth brain
567.04s: so now we get through this initial
570.20s: hypothesis orientation and now we get
572.80s: into the details of fitting a strategy
575.16s: so we're bullish in FedEx over two
577.80s: months what structure makes the most
580.36s: sense for this and what of my
581.60s: corresponding strategies should I lean
584.04s: towards then from there I need to go
586.80s: through my typical trade setup protocols
589.92s: I need to allocate to the trade I then
592.20s: need to design my scaling protocols I
595.44s: need to determine how I'm going to
598.04s: clearly state if my hypothesis is
600.60s: correct or incorrect this is a really
602.56s: important part of this process so for me
606.08s: if I am bullish FedEx and I say okay I'm
610.16s: going to trade it via a ratio called
612.56s: diagonal and I am going to use let's say
617.08s: there's no near-term resistance so I'm
619.40s: going to give it a little bit of room to
621.16s: the downside and say if it drops below
623.96s: 270 near-term resistance at least as far
626.28s: as I could see then I know I'm wrong and
628.68s: I need to get out this is creating a
631.32s: clear Line in the Sand on when I'm wrong
633.44s: the other thing is time bound because
635.44s: again options are time bound so if I'm
637.80s: trading a ratio called diagonal and I
640.52s: buy something that's 120 days out I
642.64s: already know based on that strategy I'm
644.64s: going to manage it once it gets to the
646.20s: 60-day window on the long options so
649.00s: there's an inherent baked in time
651.32s: element as well that disproves the
653.48s: hypothesis cuz if this goes sideways for
656.08s: 60 days that's still wrong I'm wrong my
658.52s: hypothesis is not correct so if you
660.60s: don't have that baked into the strategy
662.32s: you should absolutely consider adding
664.48s: both a price and time element to this
667.04s: hypothesis concept and that's actually
669.24s: the next bullet point beautiful it's
670.56s: almost as if this is what I do you don't
673.44s: say and the last part here is kind of
675.88s: dovetailing off the scaling but it's
678.04s: preemptively thinking about how you
679.72s: intend to capture profits and manage
681.60s: your losses and for me it's going to be
684.80s: based on defining both of these
687.08s: generally before I enter the trade I'm
689.60s: very strict about the losses I'm a
691.72s: little less strict on the profits on
694.12s: some strategies like Trend following
696.32s: strategies but if it's a Varan Rous
698.08s: premium style strategy I'm going to be
699.60s: very strict on this as well because each
701.72s: of these individual trades really don't
703.72s: matter by themselves it's how they
705.36s: operate in the conglomerate of a system
707.72s: and it varies you have to know what your
709.96s: individual strategies need this gets its
711.96s: own section so we've already ideally
714.64s: defined our p&l management but in here
718.12s: is when you force yourself to outline
721.60s: them in detail that's it that's why it
724.36s: gets its own section because nobody
725.92s: likes doing this because this is when we
727.52s: have to face ourselves we have to accept
729.88s: the fact that we might be wrong and we
731.64s: have to plan for that scenario and the
733.44s: last thing here blind spot this is just
735.56s: a quick way for you to sanity check what
738.08s: you're doing and then before you click
740.12s: the button you review your trade there's
742.40s: no reason to fat finger a bunch of
744.20s: positions cuz you're in too much of a
745.48s: rush things like that lead to just
747.96s: sloppy Trading and the way that you do
750.08s: one thing is the way that you do most
752.16s: things so looking at this at the end of
754.88s: the checklist I'm just going to say did
757.16s: I miss anything is there something that
760.28s: I think is important to this individual
762.36s: position and did I not think of that so
764.88s: it's literally just a quick ask of what
767.04s: am I missing ideally once you get
769.08s: through this it's not much but as always
771.52s: if you have any comments questions
772.80s: concerns let me know in the comment
774.96s: section below be an outlier see yall
777.40s: later
