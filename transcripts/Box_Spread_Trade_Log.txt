1.12s: this video is going to walk you through
2.48s: how you can build your own long box
5.68s: spread tracker this spreadsheet will
8.64s: help you understand what the annualized
11.12s: return of the trade you're looking at is
13.84s: it will help you track your previous
15.68s: trades and it even has a tool built in
18.32s: that lets us see the current yield curve
21.16s: so that you can pick where you want to
24.72s: buy your box spreads meaning loan the
27.12s: market some money so what's up everybody
29.40s: Eric here shout out to the patreon
30.96s: family and specifically for you guys a
34.12s: copy of the spreadsheet will be
35.36s: available in the patreon shop so if you
37.20s: are silver or above you get it for free
39.72s: otherwise there's a free option you can
41.40s: follow along with me and build it for
43.80s: yourself to walk you through how to make
45.72s: for yourself and then most importantly I
48.92s: want to make sure though we have a
51.40s: rudimentary understanding so long box
54.20s: spreads is when we are buying them that
56.76s: means our cash and sweep is going to
59.04s: decrease by debit and then the profit at
62.64s: the end of the trade at expiration is
64.24s: going to be the width of the spreads so
66.00s: let's take a look at what that looks
67.60s: like if we take a look at this box
70.08s: spread in SPX we want to balance a
72.84s: couple things I typically try to go
75.48s: wider apart so that I don't have to put
78.12s: on so many but you go you don't want to
81.08s: go too wide where you run out of
83.28s: liquidity because notice how this strike
85.84s: here has
87.36s: 56,000 open interest that is is from a
90.52s: lot of people doing box spreads so when
93.40s: I'm looking for my strikes I
95.68s: specifically want strikes that strike
97.64s: that balance wow pun not intended so in
101.28s: this case I want to do a Million worth
104.52s: box spread so that means I'm going to do
107.12s: 1,000 points wide and 10 of those the
110.84s: way to think about the value of the Box
112.96s: spread is it's just going to be the
115.28s: width of the spread so in this case I'm
118.04s: going to look at the 4500s I would be
120.88s: buying this call I would be selling this
124.84s: put the 4500 then if we go all the way
128.00s: to the
129.68s: 5500 down here you'll notice that these
132.68s: are thinner in terms of open interest
135.08s: but not a nimic there's still something
137.36s: here so in this case we would be selling
141.40s: this call buying this put that gives you
144.00s: this position down here now if we take a
147.52s: look at the risk profile for this notice
151.20s: how at expiration it has a fixed profit
154.04s: in this case it's $5.95 that is what the
158.04s: amount of money you're going to get back
160.76s: at the end of the trade now quick admin
163.32s: note it is really important to use
166.24s: European style options that are cash
169.20s: settled both of those traits are
170.96s: important here because early assignment
173.36s: completely changes the risk profile you
175.16s: can have a big loss because of that and
177.24s: then if it's not cash settled and you
179.36s: can take the the underlying that also
181.48s: can lead you long shares short shares
184.40s: that kind of thing which we don't want
186.12s: so European cash settled okay what fits
190.56s: that bill SPX why I typically use SPX so
195.60s: now let's take a look at the tool itself
198.68s: this down here is just a yield curve and
202.28s: again the reason why I include this for
204.36s: you is so that you can get an idea of
206.64s: where you might choose to buy your box
210.04s: spread depending on what your goals are
213.16s: the other thing is if you're looking to
214.64s: sell a box spread receive a loan maybe
216.88s: you go further out where it's cheaper
218.68s: this is inverted right now compared to
220.88s: what it typically is normally you'll see
224.08s: the yield curve in Kango where deeper
226.96s: expirations are going to have or yeah
229.52s: deeper expirations are going to have a
231.24s: higher yield and then near-term inverse
234.56s: but notice how the near-term stuff is
236.08s: actually higher yielding than the future
239.12s: dated stuff that's because we're in
240.84s: backwardation in terms of yields and
243.04s: that's just a sign of the current
244.92s: environment which is quite anomalous so
248.40s: I wouldn't make any big decisions off of
251.52s: what you're seeing in this now because
253.36s: again it's different than what it will
255.36s: be kind of long term this is the current
257.92s: yield for all these different durations
259.88s: the reason why I picked this for you
261.64s: guys is because if you go to this
263.76s: website right here you can just copy and
266.16s: paste them and just drop them right in
268.76s: and then this will automattic atically
270.04s: update off of that okay so that's the
273.00s: little yield curve for you now notice
276.16s: how I have current risk free rate up
278.08s: here the reason why this is important is
280.60s: because if we use different duration box
284.32s: spreads with different days to
287.32s: expiration that means we need to use for
289.96s: a more accurate comparison the
292.28s: corresponding duration so in this case
294.84s: we're looking at a box spread that's 38
298.44s: DTE in this example then we're somewhere
302.08s: in here you could pick the midpoint
304.40s: between these two which would give you
306.40s: 5.42 so maybe we update this to be
310.88s: 5.42 and that's your number this is what
314.16s: we're going to compare the Box spread
315.68s: against over here to see net fees if
319.60s: we're doing better so what's the trade
323.24s: well on today sixpad we're looking at
325.96s: that 38 DTE notice how these are in
328.96s: light green
330.36s: that's how I tell myself these are cells
332.96s: I'm to fill in and then the stuff that
335.52s: is not like that you don't have to fill
337.88s: that in
339.72s: so 10 lot this gets me the size that I
343.20s: want the long call and the short call
345.40s: the reason why I have these two selected
348.64s: is because these are the two different
350.76s: strikes and the puts are just going to
352.52s: be the inverse so for example the long
355.12s: call notice how that's the same as the
357.36s: short put and then the short call the
360.00s: long put shares that strike so these can
362.24s: just be pulled directly from that the
364.16s: net premium this is how much am I buying
368.20s: the Box spread for how much my loaning
370.40s: out so then all of this is automatically
373.04s: calculated which you can follow along so
375.48s: we already went over those two days to
377.28s: expiration is just the difference
378.60s: between these two days in trade is how
380.68s: long we've been in the position the
382.48s: width of the strikes is this here the
384.04s: reason why I calculate that is so that I
386.72s: can see both the loan value which is
389.68s: down here and then the loan out so the
392.12s: difference between loan out and loan
393.96s: value is simple loan out is how much did
396.76s: I what was the debit what did I actually
398.64s: buy loan value is how much is this worth
401.80s: at expiration and then that gives you
404.72s: your p&l once we factor in the fees so
409.16s: it is really important to include the
410.96s: fees here I have it hardcoded right now
413.64s: to be it's four legs every time I have
416.36s: it set to 50 cents a leg which I think
418.88s: is common for people and I'm assuming
421.72s: we're taking it to expiration if you're
424.52s: planning on managing it before
426.00s: expiration you can either adjust your
427.96s: input so that it's variable but for me
431.12s: when I'm putting these on my assumption
432.64s: is that I'm going to expiration the
434.60s: reason why the fees matters so much in
436.20s: this case is because if we get rid of it
438.44s: take a look at the annual return right
441.44s: now it's
443.16s: 5681 it goes to 5701 that's a meaningful
447.04s: difference so especially if you're doing
450.40s: smaller box spreads these fees become
453.00s: really problematic if you're not paying
454.68s: attention so then we already did the p&l
457.12s: which is all of this notice how I
458.68s: aggregate the open trades up here so
461.92s: right now I have the spreadsheet set so
463.92s: that you can essentially build out
466.20s: having four box spreads on you can
467.76s: always add more if you want I typically
469.48s: don't have more on than two but the drag
474.16s: here is telling you how much the fees
477.68s: are relative to what you would be making
480.52s: sans's fees so you can see the math for
483.60s: that there I'm taking the fees and then
486.68s: I'm figuring out what I would have made
488.84s: without them that's your drag percentage
491.08s: of your p&l return on invested capital
493.48s: is how much you're actually going to
494.80s: earn on the money you're putting out so
496.72s: in this case if I'm putting out $994,000
500.24s: I'm going to get 5880 back that's my
503.76s: return on invested Capital now you can
506.08s: annualize the rate of return which is
508.36s: how you compare Apple to Apples against
510.36s: these so in this case you can see the
512.80s: current risk free rate is 542 the
515.04s: annualized return for this box spread is
517.28s: 5681 and you can see over the risk free
520.56s: rate you're getting about a quarter
521.52s: point and that's for your trouble so
522.88s: putting on this trade it is not as
525.88s: simple as just buying one of these so
527.64s: there's got to be some sort of
528.64s: compensation here now the closed p&l up
531.76s: here is actually just summarizing all of
533.88s: these closed positions over here so the
536.44s: way that this works is whenever this
538.40s: trade comes up and and it's done what I
541.04s: do is I justrl C you can drop it over
544.00s: here I paste it as
545.84s: values and you're Off to the Races so
549.00s: the reason why I do it this way is it
551.20s: keeps a clean view over here it lets me
553.48s: track all the previous positions it lets
555.92s: me see if I'm interested what time
558.68s: frames what strikes I'm able to gain
561.72s: entry at specifically that becomes
564.24s: important to me when I'm trying to
566.80s: minimize slippage because what you'll
569.04s: noce if we go back to this
571.68s: example take a look at the width for
575.00s: this spread the midpoint is 99420 the
578.56s: natural is over the width of the strikes
581.20s: which you would never do this for more
582.64s: the width of the strikes so in this case
586.36s: you you have to work this trade and you
588.76s: have to work all of the legs you can
590.88s: either choose to do them individually or
593.00s: you could work the spread as a whole I
595.60s: tend to find working the legs
597.64s: individually is the most effective you
600.52s: just have to be very careful about
601.84s: pricing that way so this is the tool it
605.72s: is available for download for all the
607.52s: patreon gang from the shop if you have
609.32s: any questions as always just let me know
611.24s: as you can tell there's no editing in
612.64s: this video I wanted to get it out today
614.16s: shout out to my boy Benjamin he was
616.24s: asking about this so I wanted to make
618.00s: him something and it's something I
619.60s: thought about for the broader Community
620.88s: anyways I think it's
622.24s: useful let me know what you think if you
625.16s: have any questions comments concerns
626.52s: don't forget like subscribe share be an
627.96s: outlier see you guys later
