0.28s: what's up outliers we're further along
2.00s: with the election and now it's time to
4.12s: start figuring out how to further the
6.52s: gains we have already stacked up from
9.28s: the original Surge and I want to talk
11.96s: about a couple different things
13.64s: specifically some of the primary
15.52s: policies that Trump has talked about
18.16s: their potential impacts and then some
20.12s: different time frames to keep in mind
21.80s: for creating positions because the first
24.16s: 90 days is going to be a specific window
26.12s: for us to look at in a certain way and
28.24s: then really once you start getting out
29.60s: Beyond that 6 months plus there will be
31.80s: other things that come into play more
33.28s: thematic style positions which we'll
34.80s: talk about so let's get right into
38.32s: things first things first this is old
41.68s: news we already know this Donald Trump
44.28s: already won the elector electoral votes
48.08s: required for presidency 295 versus 226
51.44s: not even close okay great next up we
55.40s: have the Senate so the Senate is
59.24s: definitely sitting firm in the
61.76s: Republican hands over
63.88s: 50 uh 50 is majority here so they have
66.84s: 53 and then last we have the house and
71.48s: it looks like the potential for a red
74.04s: sweep is very high and right now the
77.88s: Republicans are at 211 seats against the
80.36s: Dems 199 and today is the 7th of
83.28s: November so you can see that we're
86.04s: definitely looking at a specific
87.68s: circumstance here and the reason why
88.88s: this matters is because if Trump has all
92.84s: three branches here the first two years
95.40s: of his presidency are going to move like
98.04s: lightning fast and it's because he's
100.28s: going to try to maximize how much he can
102.48s: get through with Republican support in
105.24s: both the house and the Senate less so
108.72s: the case if there's Democrats on one
111.68s: side of the aisle that tends to slow
113.52s: things down in terms of what can get
114.84s: through and when so that's the landscape
117.64s: as it as we look at it let's talk about
119.92s: policies we'll start with some domestic
122.28s: policies and then we'll talk more about
125.44s: these International policies I'm going
126.80s: to fly through these but these are just
128.80s: a handful of them there's more and the
131.40s: main thing I want to note here is that
132.64s: we're still missing a ton of information
135.16s: we've just heard talking points about
137.16s: most of these but we haven't actually
138.76s: seen an outline planned yet we will soon
142.40s: and that will add a lot of clarity
143.88s: around this so from a domestic
146.12s: standpoint we're seeing things like
148.24s: deregulation coming into the
149.92s: conversation decrease spending from a
152.32s: governmental perspective trying to
154.24s: decrease the overall deficit that we're
157.64s: in Trump has talked about actually I
160.52s: find a pretty interesting corporate tax
162.60s: change so going from 21 to 20% but the
165.52s: cool part here is he's talking about
169.04s: 15% tax for domestic producers so you
172.84s: can see that they're really trying to
175.20s: incentivize domestic production of goods
177.84s: now I don't know the details here I
179.08s: don't know how much domestic production
182.32s: equals domestic production for the tax
184.80s: cut I doubt it'll be full 100% we'll
187.60s: have to see but those kinds of details
189.24s: will matter to a degree we know that
191.76s: renewable energy is definitely less of a
196.12s: focus for him same thing with climate
198.12s: change and that means that he's way more
201.04s: open to fossil fuel use in tapping into
204.12s: the oil he's very vocal about that
207.36s: deportation and immigration is another
209.88s: big issue that he discussed and there's
212.96s: very likely going to be large
214.52s: deportation the reason why this matters
216.24s: is because a lot of companies use
220.40s: illegal labor and it's cheaper for
223.68s: everybody so that's going to impact all
227.16s: different kinds of companies and all
228.76s: different kinds of industries that
230.20s: leverage illegal immigrants for cheaper
234.32s: labor now big Pharma is going to come
237.28s: over massive scrutiny and this is
240.28s: because Trump has talked about granting
245.12s: RFK his dream of being able to take a
248.88s: really hard look at the total health of
253.00s: America and big farm is a big part of
256.68s: rfk's focus so with RFK heading up the
261.76s: um Public Health agencies I think that
264.08s: we're going to see really clear impacts
266.68s: from that which we'll talk a little bit
267.92s: about on a heat map
270.56s: so if you take a look here this is just
272.36s: on the day and there's definitely still
276.72s: some lingering issues for
278.52s: pharmaceuticals so if we grab Johnson
280.28s: and Johnson on this little tiny chart
281.88s: above my head you'll see that they're
283.64s: falling off a cliff they're unhappy so
286.20s: Pharmaceuticals I believe are going to
287.84s: come Under Fire a little bit Healthcare
290.12s: Providers Services they are a little bit
293.04s: more resilient same thing with biotech
295.52s: and Life Sciences they were not quite as
298.32s: impacted but far tical was really the
301.20s: the main thing I highlighted after the
303.92s: election win so this is something to
305.96s: keep in mind defense spending and space
308.56s: force defense spending is kind of
310.40s: domestic and international in its nature
312.36s: but the way that this pans out is going
314.72s: to be also really heavily influenced by
317.40s: the international policy in Ukraine
319.44s: Russia and then with Israel and Hamas
322.32s: depending on how those conflicts go
324.08s: which we're spending tens of billions of
325.84s: dollars supporting right now that will
328.00s: likely impact defense spending but I
330.20s: don't see overall defense spending
332.12s: domestically actually slowing down I
334.76s: think that Trump is advocating for peace
338.96s: through strength so that means that he's
341.48s: also likely going to invest heavily into
343.52s: something like the space force which is
344.92s: still in its infancy one of my buddies
346.56s: actually just did an intraservice
347.76s: transfer from the Marine Corps over to
349.92s: the space force which is kind of cool
351.68s: it's wild that it's called the space
353.16s: force it sounds like something out of
354.84s: like a comedy movie but it is that um we
359.12s: also have have some conversation around
361.16s: Tech regulation which I find really
363.48s: interesting and you can see this is an
365.52s: article from wired and I'll just
367.60s: highlight this one section here it says
369.00s: Trump has shown disdain for big tech
370.52s: companies and he's been vocal about
372.12s: pursuing policies that increase the cost
374.44s: of doing business for them and subject
376.92s: them to more unfavorable regulations and
379.92s: it seems like this is something that
381.68s: he's talked about even going as far as
383.40s: discussing Google so there's a real
386.84s: potential impact here which we'll talk
388.40s: about then we also have the injection of
391.80s: crypto regulation kind of the furthering
394.56s: of bringing cryptocurrency into the fold
397.36s: there's even a movement now around the
401.92s: Central Bank digital currency and what
404.32s: that could look like so crypto markets
407.08s: have reacted very favorably to the Trump
411.44s: election so if we take a look really
413.36s: quick and we run over instead of Johnson
416.04s: and Johnson which I just showed you was
417.32s: falling off a cliff but if we actually
419.72s: take a look at
421.68s: cryptocurrency Bitcoin is hitting
424.00s: all-time highs here so very much in
426.88s: favor of the recent change and now from
430.16s: an international perspective we already
431.72s: touched on these two conflicts but then
433.20s: there's also the China tariff the way
436.44s: that this rolls out is going to be
438.16s: really important because this is
439.84s: actually quite inflationary and that's
442.00s: one of the big things that Trump is
443.16s: going to have to contest with as he goes
444.84s: through this is that a lot of the stuff
447.80s: that he wants to do is is wrapped around
450.28s: growth which is going to be inflationary
452.48s: by its nature but we're still in pretty
455.20s: high inflationary environment the FED
456.88s: just cut rates and their future rate
460.08s: cutting uh road map actually slowed down
462.96s: a lot after Trump won the election so it
465.92s: looks like the way that this might roll
469.04s: out would probably be phased over time
471.72s: because if this is like an overnight
473.92s: short-term thing that would cause
475.80s: absolutely catastrophic shock to the
478.32s: system and much lots of different
481.12s: entities from consumer staples and more
484.04s: specifically consumer discretionary are
486.36s: going to get crushed so think of things
488.40s: like Walmarts targets those kinds of
490.20s: places that essentially exist off of
492.72s: Chinese Goods that's going to be really
494.84s: difficult and then we also have the US
498.04s: Mexico Canada agreement so they're he's
501.16s: talking about renegotiating specifically
503.76s: the the automobile section of that
505.96s: agreement to be slightly more favorable
507.44s: to the us all right so that's a bunch of
509.56s: things this is not holistic but these
511.44s: are some of the primary things that I'm
513.08s: looking at so now if we take a look
516.84s: quickly at something else I want to show
520.36s: you how various sectors are doing right
523.20s: now so this is using a five 1 month and
527.36s: thre month chart and the way that these
530.32s: move is really important so let me show
532.76s: you for example if we take a look at
535.68s: what's not in favor utilities if you go
539.48s: Out 3 months utilities was up over 6% a
542.52s: month ago it was down two and now it's
544.16s: down 2.83 so definitely slowing down
547.04s: here then if you take a look at some of
550.16s: the other things that are likely to
551.56s: struggle a little bit Staples because if
554.56s: inflation remains High the cost of
556.36s: getting the things you need is going to
557.96s: be expensive so no no shock here real
561.20s: estate similar thing with rates and the
563.52s: 30-year moving up as far as it did it's
566.40s: up almost to 7% now again in
568.72s: anticipation of the rate environment
570.76s: remaining about the same and stuff like
574.36s: financials is about as happy as it could
576.96s: be and same thing with information
579.36s: technology this is a little bit of a
581.20s: mixed bag in my opinion because if we
584.12s: take a look at the tech sector so if we
587.20s: go in here and take a look at the heat
589.64s: map and specifically look at Information
593.16s: Technology you can see that across the
595.72s: board they're actually responding really
598.36s: really favorably so this to me indicates
601.36s: that some of the the conversation points
603.68s: around Trump discussing regulation of
606.96s: these larger entities seems to be a
609.16s: little bit more siloed now something
611.24s: like that Chinese tariff would be a
614.64s: massive influence for something like
616.84s: apple but Apple so far is still
619.92s: generally happy so I'm not so sure how
623.80s: serious to take the risk here because
626.32s: Apple isn't taking it that seriously but
628.00s: something to keep an eye on now the last
630.60s: thing I want to talk about are just ways
632.52s: to think about trading these different
635.24s: time frames and if we break out these
638.92s: different elements into 90day time
641.00s: frames which I would consider to be more
642.68s: appropriate for momentum Style Trading
644.88s: and then 6 months plus further than that
647.12s: even is more thematic so this is where
649.88s: we're trying to front run some of the
652.28s: policy statements so if we just
655.36s: essentially use the Yellow Boxes for
657.68s: momentum and then anything that's not
659.32s: would fall into the Thematic category we
661.48s: can see things like deregulation is
663.44s: already having a massive impact so if we
666.52s: go to something like XLF you can see it
669.64s: literally jumped it gapped up from 46
673.16s: and change and it opened up at 49 on the
676.24s: 6th so deregulation is absolutely going
678.84s: to massively impact the financial sector
681.48s: and it's going to drive their
682.40s: profitability R lar now the decreased
686.68s: renewal emphasis we can see that being
688.92s: rep presented in stuff like oil and gas
693.12s: starting to gain a little bit of
694.64s: strength here so if we go into this tab
697.84s: here and then we go into energy this is
701.60s: little bit of a Down tick on the day
703.52s: today but if we take a look at um some
705.96s: of the producers like KMI they're doing
709.28s: really well Exxon Mobile is interesting
712.16s: because a lot of oil producers have been
714.68s: struggling relatively recently but based
718.16s: on the the outcome from the election
722.20s: they seem to be doing a little bit
723.72s: better here right so again it's not
725.36s: doing well it's still in this downtrend
727.64s: but if we take a look at the response on
729.64s: the six it was a gap up from here so I
732.44s: think oil and gas are going to enjoy a
735.32s: bit of this momentum and stuff that's
737.12s: really wrapped more around renewable
739.56s: things that are in um solar wind
742.64s: probably not as invogue then we have big
745.68s: pharmer we already talked about that the
748.04s: defense spending and space Force this
749.60s: one's a little early to tell but this is
751.48s: where we can look at stuff like locked
753.32s: Martin and you can see that on the six
757.64s: they got a bit of a bounce but still
759.96s: they really fell off a cliff here post
761.72s: earnings so that's a little bit of an
763.16s: influence going on there if we take a
764.76s: look at Ron similar story bounce up on
768.16s: the six following the notification so
770.88s: what I'm highlighting is that defense in
772.60s: general prefers this outcome but they
775.36s: still look a little bit weak here on a
777.32s: shorter term time frame uh crypto
779.84s: regulation we already talked about
781.08s: Bitcoin so a lot of these things are
783.08s: going to be shorter term in nature and
785.56s: the way that I I talk especially for
787.52s: those in the patreon we spent some time
789.80s: looking through these different sectors
791.40s: to find what sectors are performing well
794.68s: and expanding and then looking for
796.60s: leaders within those sectors because
799.20s: right now there is so much money to be
801.32s: made as long as you're pragmatic in your
804.16s: approach you're careful with your risk
805.80s: long equities right now is such a tough
808.24s: trade to beat because if we look at
810.12s: something as simple as just forward e-
813.12s: minis I mean they're at nose beds they
815.36s: cracked above six and they're hanging
816.96s: out up there so I look at this as two
821.28s: different trading Windows there's the
823.48s: near-term follow-through of all this
825.48s: stuff about 90 days and then beyond that
828.52s: we start getting into more thematic
830.20s: positioning based on when we get a
832.48s: little more clarity around the policies
834.44s: so hope that was helpful if there's any
835.92s: questions throw them in the comments
838.36s: below and then if there anything you're
839.76s: specifically looking at I would love to
841.36s: hear about that as well be an outlier I
843.04s: will see you all later
