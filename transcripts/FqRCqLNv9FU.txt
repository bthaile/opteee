0.00s: What's up outliers? Quick update on GameStop and Chewy today. As I already told you last week,
6.68s: I'm going to start doing just one or two stocks during these because on the YouTube live
11.18s: sessions, I'm doing every day at 5 PM Pacific time, you can join in for the broader market
15.96s: update stuff. So taking a look at GameStop, however, this is going to be a short video,
21.58s: because there's not a ton going on here. We're still trending very much sideways, although
26.24s: we are seeing ever so slight positive drift. Like if I scale this up so that you can see
31.80s: it a little bit better, there is some element of positive drift going on, which is good.
36.72s: I want to be super clear about that because when I'm looking at something like GameStop,
40.84s: what I don't want to see is really light volume like we've had and it's still contracting
46.48s: day over day, but having the stock drifting down during that time frame, that becomes kind
51.76s: of ugly, which that's not what we're seeing right now, thankfully. So yeah, I think in
57.62s: terms of price action, we're still in a bit of a holding pattern. And then when I take
63.12s: a look over at Chewy, it's, I'm sorry, let's take a look at the options first. Take a
68.72s: look at the GME options chain. I was poking through out of curiosity just to see for
75.14s: things that were 10 lots or higher. If there was any kind of, you know, repeat stops. If
79.92s: any bigger positions were going on and it's just a mixed bag, this isn't anything that
85.08s: I would take away too heavily. But for example, I can see these 25s getting hit a little
91.80s: bit out in 23 August, but these are all still relatively small positions for, you know,
99.52s: what we've historically seen and what GameStop seems to start thriving on when we get movement.
105.16s: So just not seeing a whole lot there. As far as the options volume today, very light, 120,000
112.96s: calls against 21,000 puts. So big calls to you on the volume. But this isn't surprising
118.64s: because this looks like a ton of people that are just establishing positions for this week.
123.36s: Now this is one of my curiosities when we were getting towards expiration of last week,
127.56s: there was over 200,000 options that just, you know, came undone. So in this case, what
132.00s: I'm curious about is what's happening with these positions? Are we going to roll out to
136.48s: the next expiration to the next primary expiration? Are we going to let them expire? And what
141.28s: ended up happening is we took them in to expiration. And then it looks like broadly, there's
146.52s: reestablishing going on. So the 23 aug had 12,000 contracts traded. The 25s had 12,400. The
156.64s: 23s were 12,800. The 24s had 7,900. So you can see where everybody's trying to play this.
163.68s: It's all very near the money, which is actually better than hyper centralizing in these super
170.56s: far out of the monies. I'm glad to see more of the activity going on here. I honestly just don't
175.04s: know if there's going to be enough movement for these folks to make some money. I still am
180.88s: currently just holding shares with some short calls against the shares. And it's because we're
186.32s: trending sideways. So I'll start positioning using options when I start seeing movement. And it's
193.84s: just not happening to a big degree in here just yet. So it's a waiting game. We need to wait
199.84s: and see what the next primary catalyst is going to be. And there are definitely positioning
205.36s: positions being put on on the buy side. So if you take a look at the volume for today,
210.24s: 40% of it were at the ask or above. So people are buying and people are selling puts. So
216.24s: there's definitely a general bullish disposition in terms of single options being put on. But
221.60s: it's just generally light for what we tend to see right now. There's 482,000 total call
229.12s: li against 254,000 put li. And for this front expiration, let's take a quick look at what's in
237.44s: here so far, 63 K against 16. So very light. This should expand after today, after that new volume
244.72s: will be brought in from the transactions that we were just talking about. But still pretty light
250.40s: is what it boils down to. Now pivoting over to chewy quickly because I do have something on
257.36s: in here. And it's just because we started breaking out. So you can see where my stop is. I'm very,
262.40s: very hesitant with earnings coming up. I'm not expecting to hold this straight through earnings.
267.28s: But it looks like there's some general bullish disposition coming into earnings that again,
273.04s: whether or not it turns into anything big, I don't know. But there's a couple of things I see
276.96s: going on here. The first one is volume is actually expanding beyond both of five and 20 day average
286.00s: volume, which is important to me because this indicates increased participation. So today, it was
293.68s: 65% by volume at 3.7 mil transacted. And the five day volume average is 4.3 million. The 20 day
302.40s: volume average is 4.3 million. So you can see that the by volume alone today, essentially almost
309.28s: paced total daily volume for both previous 20 days and the previous five days. So it just tells me
316.48s: there's interest. And it doesn't surprise me. I'm not suggesting that that's interest driven from
321.68s: any crazy activity. But I do see one coming up, which is earnings. I see earnings coming up in
328.24s: people like playing earnings. So when I take a look at chewy options, if we take a look at the
335.36s: volume for today, it was 47,000 calls against 90, 700 puts. And open interest is 228K calls to
346.40s: 164K puts. Now for me, I'm out here. I'm in the my pass through account. That's why there's no
351.76s: position marked. But I'm out here 60 DTE is you guys know my standard way of buying options. If
357.36s: you're unfamiliar with that, I'll throw a link at the end of the video so that you can go learn
361.28s: about buying options a little bit smarter. So they're not not just lighting money on fire,
366.32s: every single expiration cycle. But when I look at open interest for this week, it's light 20,000
373.68s: calls to 7800 puts in 30 hog similar story, six set similar story, 13 set similar story, 20 set
382.24s: is 53 to 45. So there's a little bit more activity there. It has earnings coming up on the 28th.
390.88s: So normally I would expect to see the expiration cycle that contains earnings to be elevated like
396.72s: this right here. Notice how this front expiration is at 106% vol. Then we have 118. This is very high
404.16s: relative to what's ahead of it and after it. So that tells me something's going on there. In this
409.44s: case, it's earnings pretty clear. Obviously because we also know that. So this looks like a slightly
416.64s: more active play right now because I can also see some really big positions being built out. So in
422.24s: this case, you can see these 32s got hammered. They absolutely got hammered and they were kind of
429.76s: spread out throughout the day. So it looks like slightly different people potentially participating.
434.40s: But like this right here, I think this is the same person. And we can see 496 on this 1495 here,
441.12s: both at 75 cents. Those are not insignificant sized positions. So this is in 30 hog. So you can see
448.24s: that there's some play happening here with the 32s between 30 and 23 hog. That's my guess is that
453.92s: there's some calendars potentially going on. And again, this doesn't surprise me with earnings.
459.20s: So I'm not sure that these are direct, you know, just trying to play this to the upside long call
465.60s: style plays. These look like it could be a little bit of both going on is what I'm seeing. But
470.48s: there's just a little more activity going on here. So right now position on and chewy position on
476.96s: a game stop still technically, but I'm trading chewy a little more directionally with options at
480.96s: the moment because it's showing some activity and then game stops a little bit of a holding pattern.
485.44s: And then later today we will dive into the broader markets. So as always, if you need anything,
489.84s: let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
