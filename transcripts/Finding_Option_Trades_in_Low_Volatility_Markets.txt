0.08s: let's talk about trading options in low
2.72s: volatility periods the reason why this
4.72s: is important is because we're kind of in
6.48s: one right now but also kind of not and I
9.28s: think a lot of Traders get hung up on
11.36s: this exact concept because if you build
15.20s: two unilateral of a skill set meaning
17.36s: maybe you just sell premium only it can
20.28s: be kind of difficult to Pivot and find
23.08s: good opportunities when the market
26.00s: conditions shift so we're going to talk
28.72s: about two things how to identify the
31.60s: type of volatility environment so that
33.68s: you know where to look for opportunities
36.40s: which is the second part and then at the
38.16s: end of the video I'm going to show you
39.12s: some of my personal scans that I use to
42.12s: help me find where opportunities are
45.56s: either for longv short Vol opportunities
49.16s: in low volatility markets what's up
51.48s: everybody Eric here welcome back to the
53.12s: outliers shout out to the patreon family
56.52s: let's talk about it so here we are
58.80s: pretty low volum volatility so what this
61.52s: is showing you is a frequency chart of
65.32s: vix closing prices in essentially on the
68.84s: left hand side over here and $5
71.60s: increments and then on the right hand
73.32s: side we zoom in a little bit more which
75.32s: is kind of important and I'll explain to
77.88s: you why the reason being is right now if
82.28s: we take a look at where volatility is
85.08s: I'll grab a chart we'll go to vix and
89.56s: you'll see that right now we're at about
92.56s: 13 1292 is where we closed recently and
96.00s: if I zoom this all the way out let's go
98.36s: even further let's do like a 10year
100.32s: monthly you can see that we are kind of
103.28s: at these fairly suppressed levels we're
105.72s: definitely not what we were enjoying
108.24s: back in 21 22 and even the beginning of
111.76s: 23 so this begs the question well then
116.12s: what kind of volatility environment are
118.36s: we're in and let's take a look so over
121.92s: on the left-and side this shows us the
124.00s: frequency of closing prices just as a
126.88s: raw count and then percentage on top
129.44s: from 1990 to 2024 the 24th of May and
132.88s: you'll see that over 30% of the time
136.08s: volatility is essentially below 15 and
138.96s: within that breakdown if I slide myself
141.72s: slightly out of the way so you can see a
143.36s: little bit better we can see that the
145.72s: vast majority of this sub component of
150.16s: overall sample size is 12 to 14 is where
154.68s: we see essentially 17% of vixs closure
159.92s: sub 15 so what I'm highlighting is that
163.80s: while the current market environment
166.32s: definitely is lower volatility this is
168.28s: nothing novel this is nothing new and
169.92s: this is nothing extreme all of that
171.88s: matters because a couple things a lot of
174.12s: people think that volatility is mean
175.96s: reverting and it definitely is but we're
178.40s: not even really at an extreme if it was
181.16s: down you know below 11 sure that is
184.24s: definitely an extreme but volatility
186.84s: being between 12 and 14 it can stay
189.32s: there for some time so if you're going
190.92s: out loading up on Vick's calls thinking
194.20s: well Vol is really low and I'm going to
196.44s: load up because it's going to pop
197.60s: anytime soon maybe but probably not
200.92s: volatility clusters that can stay in a
203.32s: specific area for quite some time so
205.92s: what we're identifying here is that yes
208.56s: volatility is low
210.40s: not supremely low the other thing that I
212.52s: want to caution people against is that
214.24s: when we see the vix the volatility index
216.80s: people use that for the volatility
218.84s: across the entire stock market and I
221.40s: actually think that can be confusing to
223.12s: some people because when we're
225.24s: identifying the period of volatility
228.32s: that we're in it's first really
230.28s: important to identify whether it's
232.64s: systematic or unsystematic systematic
234.84s: meaning if it's kind of across the
237.12s: entire stock market and that's actually
239.12s: really useful
240.28s: to identify via vix because the
242.56s: volatility index obviously tied to the
244.84s: S&P 500 Index which encompasses all of
247.96s: the large cap stocks or over 500 of them
250.60s: within the US so it's useful but notice
253.08s: how I kind of tied that chain together
255.36s: for you vix SPX S&P 500 large cap
260.40s: companies because there's more than just
263.88s: large cap companies in the US so if we
267.28s: go over here and we go to visualize you
269.04s: can see that yes there are obviously a
271.16s: lot of large cap companies but if we go
272.68s: in here into the Russell oh there's a
275.84s: lot more companies so what I'm trying to
278.00s: highlight to you is that if you're using
279.76s: vix to then assume if all stocks across
283.32s: the entire stock market are now no
284.96s: longer volatile you're grossly mistaken
287.12s: and you're really cutting yourself off
288.68s: from finding a lot of great
289.84s: opportunities now unseminary
299.72s: out of volatility so the current Vol
302.48s: environment as I see it is large caps
305.68s: definitely lower volatility but there's
307.92s: still volatility to be found it's not
310.88s: across the entire stock market universe
313.80s: so let's talk about what we can do to
317.88s: clearly find what kind of volatility
320.96s: environment we're in well I just kind of
322.40s: showed you the start of scanning the
325.04s: indices so we can see if we look at the
328.20s: primary indices so SP X how volatile it
331.00s: is IV percentile is at 15% so very low
334.84s: and if you're unfamiliar with IV
336.80s: percentile and why that's a better
338.60s: measure than IV rank in this case I'll
341.44s: throw a video in the notes Below on that
343.24s: exact thing but IV percentile in this
345.08s: case matters so SPX is showing very low
348.36s: V now let's take a look at the rut 10%
350.92s: even lower V not great ndx also 12% so
355.72s: what we're seeing is kind of across the
357.56s: board low volatility we're not seeing
359.68s: pockets of elevated volatility across
361.88s: the various indices now the other thing
364.00s: we can do to see what kind of volatility
366.36s: environment we're in is look at highs
369.00s: and lows for different sectors in
372.00s: different exchanges so in this case we
374.32s: have the NASDAQ here and then the New
376.24s: York Stock Exchange down here the reason
378.08s: why I like using both of these is
379.52s: because they look at slightly different
381.20s: companies you'll see more kind of tech
383.88s: companies and larger companies in the
386.12s: NASDAQ and then the New York Stock
387.64s: Exchange encompasses a lot of small caps
389.80s: so looking across this while it's very
392.84s: very clear that we're going through kind
394.84s: of a a bit of a dampening period without
397.24s: much going on what I'm seeing here is
400.24s: kind of muted movement and that
402.80s: typically will translate to lower
404.28s: volatility if we have things that are
406.40s: also flying off the handle to the upside
408.44s: that also will translate typically to
410.80s: lower overall volatility now if we see
413.28s: things accelerating to the downside like
415.08s: this that tends to be higher volatility
417.88s: and for the outlier prop patreon members
420.92s: you have access to these think scripts
423.04s: in the patreon shop so you can go grab
424.96s: one of those if you're so inclined but
427.08s: if not there's different permutations of
429.16s: net highs lows accessible to everybody
430.92s: out there so the next thing we can take
433.96s: do is take a look at the individual
436.56s: sectors so all I'm doing here is taking
439.52s: a look at different time frames going
442.44s: kind of from further out in time 30-day
444.84s: change in sectors down to the 5day into
447.68s: the 1 day and I just want to see which
450.04s: one of these are moving all over the
451.92s: place so a decent example of this would
454.72s: be noticing energy down here at the
456.44s: bottom coming up towards the top in a
458.20s: 5-day period and then in a 1-day period
460.80s: That's not really that advantageous for
463.88s: what we're looking for here but we can
465.88s: take a look at energy I would suspect it
467.80s: would have slightly elevated volatility
470.36s: compared to something like financials
473.60s: which has been essentially towards the
475.36s: center of this group the entire time so
477.88s: let's take a quick peek at energy which
480.72s: we have up here and the implied
482.48s: volatility percentile for energy right
484.32s: now is
485.48s: 22% and then if we go to financials
488.32s: that's at 4% so you can kind of see the
490.72s: point this is the way that we can use
492.08s: the sectors just to eyeball where we
494.60s: might find Opportunities and now if I
496.72s: was so inclined I could go deeper into
498.92s: energy itself but there's a couple other
501.96s: things we can do here so let's take a
504.68s: look now at some really important
507.72s: Concepts the first one is even if it
509.84s: seems like from a broad Market
511.92s: perspective there's not volatility
513.84s: there's always volatility we just have
515.60s: to learn where to look for it so this
518.36s: list of things is kind of just a
520.28s: starting point for you things like
522.00s: upcoming earnings base trial releases
524.36s: from biotechnical companies or even news
526.96s: updates anything in biotech tends to be
530.08s: more volatile because it's often small
532.88s: companies that are completely predicated
534.80s: around a single product getting FDA
536.84s: approval or advancing towards that and
539.48s: and each one of those trial releases is
542.28s: kind of a big deal so you'll find
543.72s: volatility there quite a lot upcoming
545.76s: economic events things like fomc
548.36s: statements things like
550.68s: GDP um things like anything right now
554.24s: tied to inflation is quite topical so as
557.84s: we're looking at CPI PPI unemployment
560.60s: all of those kinds of things absolutely
563.60s: are tradable events sector events so
567.04s: right now kind of to the upside we're
568.88s: seeing AI which would be contracting
571.80s: volatility because most things are
573.08s: drifting up due to that but you can find
575.64s: other instances where entire sectors are
577.68s: being negatively impacted by something
579.68s: that's again another draw for some
581.24s: volatility m&a news large stock price
585.04s: movements so I'll show you a couple
587.12s: scans to identify that then even in
589.36s: Commodities sometimes if you're not
590.96s: finding in equities you can find
592.80s: volatility over in the commodity space
595.16s: now that's if you still just want to
597.12s: trade volatility and mostly to the short
599.36s: outside the contraction thereof you can
601.80s: also dust off your broader skill set as
604.56s: a Trader you can look into things like
607.04s: directional plays and run things like
609.80s: ratio diagonals I'll throw a link in the
612.48s: notes Below on how I like to go about
615.12s: that you can still trade pays trades
618.44s: variance risk premium plays even if
621.08s: volatility is low sometimes when
622.56s: volatility is low is the best time to
625.16s: extract vrp from the markets you can
628.12s: trade the monthly Bond Bond rebalancing
630.36s: dividend capture strategy the point
632.56s: being there are so many things to do out
634.60s: there that you have to broaden your your
637.28s: skill set just a little bit so that you
639.36s: don't feel like you get stuck if the
641.00s: market is not doing the one thing you
643.80s: want it to do so as I look across my own
646.96s: portfolio so far this year I notice a
649.48s: few things the vast majority of my
652.04s: returns are actually coming from
653.92s: speculative plays one of my larger
657.12s: speculative plays right now is using
659.28s: pple Q is a three times leverage ETF
661.32s: that's another place that you can find
663.20s: volatility now there's a lot of risk in
664.80s: that it's not quite as simple as you
666.76s: know just go in there and then you have
668.00s: great volatility and everything's
669.36s: flowery not so much but there's
671.56s: opportunity there zero DTE tons of
674.16s: opportunity and there are still earnings
675.80s: plays as I talked about directional
677.96s: plays via diagonals my core allocation
681.72s: is only performing at this rate so far
684.88s: because it's gotten most of the
685.96s: portfolios Capital but I've slowly
688.00s: started rotating that not too long ago
690.52s: so if you add up all of these numbers
693.04s: the speculative allocation is
695.56s: contributing
696.80s: 10.9% of My overall return so far the
699.60s: year where we're sitting not a great
701.20s: year but not a slow year it's kind of
702.80s: right in the middle it's exactly what
703.84s: I'm looking for so when I look across
706.08s: this there are lots of opportunities and
708.44s: now I want to share with you just a few
710.00s: scans to help get you started so we'll
712.36s: look first at being able to find
714.24s: earnings very very simple if you go to
717.12s: any sort of Stock Market calendar you
718.92s: can filter by earnings and one of the
721.32s: cool things about earnings is you'll
722.84s: notice it's kind of Perpetual and what
726.12s: that means is if I click through you'll
728.36s: notice that even though these are new
730.08s: months it's not really any completely
732.48s: dead months even this as a slower month
735.20s: still has some opportunities for
737.88s: earnings so there will be periods where
740.88s: it can be slower and also the reason why
742.84s: this starts to get really sparse is
744.28s: because it's so far out they haven't
745.56s: announced their dates but what I'm
747.40s: highlighting is that this is a great
749.52s: return Source now if you're an options
752.04s: Trader you probably will want to have
755.16s: some sort of filter to make sure that
757.00s: what you're trading is optionable I
759.84s: normally will look for something that
761.24s: has weeklys and you'll see that that
762.88s: naturally limits this a lot which is
765.76s: okay it's one return Source out of
767.80s: several but that's essentially you can
769.44s: find upcoming earnings and then you want
771.48s: to analyze how they're doing for
773.92s: upcoming earnings releases I have a
775.68s: video on trading earnings which is kind
777.64s: of a variance premum play and I'll throw
780.44s: that in the description below as well
782.16s: now economic events is pretty simple you
784.32s: can use any sort of website and see
786.52s: what's coming up this coming week now
788.20s: you have to get a little more attached
790.60s: to what is topical to the market but
793.40s: again right now interest rates anything
794.88s: to do with interest rates inflation it's
796.72s: going to have at least some sort of
798.40s: impact on the market now I want to show
800.64s: you just a couple scans some general
802.72s: scans that can work really well for this
804.76s: stuff first one about as basic as it
807.00s: gets I'm looking at all optionable
809.20s: stocks that have weekly expirations and
812.48s: I'm looking for things that have an
813.80s: implied volatility percentile quick
815.92s: admin note this is in thinker swim so
817.92s: this is actually implied volatility rank
820.68s: they have it messed up so just know that
822.68s: there's a difference here but anyways
824.76s: I'm looking for things that are at least
826.20s: 40 or higher and if we take a look at
830.28s: the output there's 206 names there's
833.64s: tons of names in here for you to comb
836.12s: through and find what looks interesting
839.08s: so if we grab just kind of a random one
841.32s: here this first one xlc and has a 73%
844.96s: imply volatility percentile okay so you
847.68s: can start taking a look in there and see
849.60s: if anything looks good to you the point
851.40s: being is again you now have over 200
854.00s: names to go take a look at a couple
856.00s: other things you can look for that I
857.52s: like to check out are a quick implied
860.88s: volatility expansion so in this case I'm
863.80s: looking for implied volatility that's
865.48s: blowing up by at least 15% over you
868.32s: could do whatever PR period today is a
870.36s: Sunday so that's why I'm using three
872.12s: bars ago to get me into the last trading
874.92s: week this only has 16 so we can open
877.96s: that up maybe to five bars and see what
880.68s: that pulls up 19 but again now you have
883.16s: another 19 names to go poke through and
885.68s: see if anything looks interesting to you
887.80s: in here now a big part of trading
891.36s: volatility to the short side is trading
893.36s: a lot of sloppy things that have really
896.20s: wide markets that are smaller float that
899.04s: there's just a lot of opportunity there
900.60s: so you have to be prepared if you're
902.40s: looking for crap to trade High
903.92s: volatility and you're going to find High
905.60s: volatility stuff now there's one other
908.08s: scan that I want to show you guys and
910.68s: it's a pretty simple one but we can use
913.36s: it to trade a couple different things so
915.72s: what I'm going to look for is something
918.20s: that has a kind of big price but I'm
921.92s: looking for a break down so it we can
924.80s: start in all stocks that doesn't matter
926.80s: so much but again we want
929.56s: optionable and let's say that we want to
932.04s: find stuff that's actually kind of
933.56s: falling off a cliff to the downside so
935.44s: let's look for stuff that's at least 10%
938.04s: less than when it was 10 days ago and
941.28s: see what we get as a return here now
944.08s: here we have another 65 names to go
946.12s: through now this one's kind of cool
947.84s: because you can trade things either
950.00s: continue to the downside so if we take a
951.96s: look at DK it's in a bit of a free flaw
955.28s: this might be a great short opportunity
957.20s: implied volatility percentiles only only
959.16s: 27% but it's still elevated enough at
961.60s: 46% Raw volatility that you can still
964.68s: trade volatility in here very reasonably
966.96s: well so a bunch a bunch of places to go
970.92s: find Opportunities they're there your
973.20s: job as a Trader is to identify what the
976.16s: market is doing and then to fit what
978.12s: you're doing to what the market is doing
979.96s: we don't just get to pick one specific
982.28s: thing that we want to see you can do
983.96s: that but you're going to spend a lot of
985.20s: time sitting on the sidelines
986.68s: unnecessarily if you have any questions
988.72s: let let me know in the comments if
990.32s: there's anything you want to add also
992.44s: throw it in the comments so other people
993.72s: can learn with you like subscribe share
995.44s: be an outlier I'll see you guys later
