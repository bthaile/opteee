0.56s: when good just is not good enough today
3.64s: I got three things on our agenda the
5.92s: first one is NVIDIA the second one is
8.48s: chewy because they both had earnings
9.92s: today and then the third one is the
12.16s: hometown favorite we'll take a quick
13.52s: look at uh GameStop although it's still
15.28s: pretty quiet in there so what's going on
17.72s: in Nvidia well it is all over the map
20.92s: and this is kind of a really good
23.32s: example for earnings if you've been
25.24s: watching my videos over the past couple
26.76s: days last two days specifically where
28.28s: I've been highlighting Nvidia one of the
30.32s: things I talked about was the importance
32.08s: of Nvidia to deliver near perfectly and
36.24s: what that meant is even though it had a
40.52s: great quarter if we take a look at its
43.36s: EPS it came in at 68 cents against 59
46.92s: cents expectation it beat on EPS if we
51.04s: take a look at its year-over-year
52.96s: Revenue gross margins operating income
56.04s: net income diluted earnings per share
57.68s: everything it's up it's up massively
60.32s: year over-year quarter over quarter it's
62.84s: up it's done exceedingly well gross
65.76s: margins came down a little bit but
67.24s: operating income came up net income came
69.28s: up so what's going on here well this is
73.56s: again a good case study in earnings and
75.40s: how they work because I think a lot of
77.80s: retail Traders mistakenly believe that
80.08s: if a company beats earnings it should go
82.56s: up and that's not at all the case this
84.68s: is a company that beat earnings that
86.52s: absolutely smashed it both on a quarter
88.52s: over quarter and year-over-year
89.92s: perspective and it's down it closed at
92.88s: 12561 and now it's trading just below
95.28s: 118 so what's happening here this is a
98.72s: couple things that are really important
100.16s: to understand and this is a good product
102.40s: to look at it through the lens of so
105.52s: first thing is when we're looking at
107.36s: earnings it's important to understand
108.88s: the ratings system and there are a ton
112.52s: of conflicts of interest baked into a
115.64s: stock or earnings rating system stock
117.88s: analysts that typically work for big
119.52s: Banks that often hold the stocks that
123.44s: they're rating are the ones that come up
126.20s: with these
127.56s: numbers they say Okay based on what it's
129.96s: doing and its history it should come in
132.04s: at
133.16s: 597 estimated EPS cool sick story bro so
138.76s: then why is it all the time that if we
140.88s: take a look at a density of S&P 500
143.96s: earnings releases and we take a look at
146.36s: the percentage of those releases over
148.32s: the last 10 years and we say what's the
150.76s: percentage of earnings releases in S&P
153.68s: 500 stocks over the last 10 years where
157.04s: we have either a beats expectation meets
160.16s: expectation or is less than expectation
162.72s: why is it that the overwhelming majority
165.04s: beat expectation I don't really think
168.48s: it's because we're that bad at guessing
171.52s: we're not not great but we also can
174.36s: figure out how to put a rocket ship on
176.92s: the moon when things are all moving
179.24s: together some magically and then also
181.00s: get it back we can do that but somehow
184.64s: if we look over the entire history of
186.32s: all these stocks we overwhelmingly see
190.00s: beats instead of meets expectations I
192.56s: think we could be a little bit more
193.60s: accurate if we wanted so why aren't we
196.16s: it's because we're not incentivized we
198.76s: being the analysts so two things go on
202.68s: the first thing is again that conflict
204.40s: of interest I highlighted from the
205.68s: beginning where they're straight up
207.56s: incentivized to make the stocks look
210.12s: better because a lot of them hold the
211.76s: very stocks that they're reporting on so
214.64s: they want it to look better so it goes
215.88s: up the second thing is there's no
219.40s: benefit to being the more accurate
221.68s: analyst they're actually incentivized to
223.96s: be around the herd to be around the pack
226.68s: otherwise you end up like Kathy Wood who
230.20s: is obviously somebody that got skylined
232.56s: for all of her great ideas and all these
234.64s: really cool things she's doing and then
237.00s: when whatever she's doing stops working
239.20s: she's now the laughing stock of the Town
241.04s: nobody can take her seriously you know
243.16s: who's not in that scenario the hedge
246.00s: fund manager that's been there
247.24s: underperforming the S&P 500 for 40 years
250.96s: but he's kind of just underperforming by
252.88s: 2% so he can take his cut go grab his
255.48s: yacht he's not incentivized to
257.44s: outperform it's the same thing when it
259.08s: comes to analyst accuracy they are not
261.64s: incentivized to be super accurate
263.92s: they're actually highly incentivized to
266.32s: group around one another so then if
269.20s: there's a big giant miss everybody got
271.84s: it wrong something crazy happened that
273.28s: nobody saw coming whereas in this if
275.44s: somebody tried to be super accurate and
277.16s: then that one person was wrong they've
278.72s: just skylined themselves and they've
280.60s: just put them in the scenario to be the
282.04s: laughing stock of the town instead of
283.72s: just being able to collect their money
285.32s: and move on what I guarantee you is that
287.76s: if they were paid based on their
289.64s: accuracy these numbers would be a lot
291.36s: better but this goes all the way back to
293.08s: the earning system it's kind of like a
294.40s: game of softball so when we're
296.84s: recounting the past quarter we already
300.08s: have a lot of ideas on how we've done we
303.04s: again being the business itself we have
305.80s: some ideas typically we can see the
307.84s: footprints of a well-performing business
310.48s: the way that it's impacting the way it's
312.08s: selling how prevalent it is yada yada y
314.24s: like there's a lot of cues that tell us
316.28s: how a company is doing and we have
319.16s: analysts that tend to continue providing
321.20s: update on the life cycle of the company
324.04s: throughout the quarter so when we're
325.88s: going through an earning cycle
327.64s: understanding the incentive structure
329.84s: really what we care about are two things
333.52s: big
334.92s: deviations from expectations so big
338.32s: surprises that somehow slip through
340.84s: forward guidance forward guidance is new
344.16s: information it's hot off the press and
347.28s: it's information that now helps us
349.84s: discount the future value of a stock so
353.32s: all of this coming back to Nvidia as
356.36s: I've talked about in the past two videos
358.60s: if we look over the last two years on an
360.60s: adjusted basis the stock has gone from
362.80s: 1081 to
364.36s: $140 and no it's not a penny stock this
367.28s: is a mega cap stock it's
371.56s: huge this kind of movement is very cool
374.28s: to see as you start getting into these
376.84s: more
377.76s: parabolic phases like this here there is
381.80s: now a new mandate you have to deliver
385.24s: near perfectly in order to consider in
389.28s: order to be considered still on track
392.72s: they have to be perfect and as we look
395.92s: through Nvidia earnings while they were
399.04s: damn good they're not perfect and
402.44s: there's a couple things in here that
404.92s: start to cause some concerns like this
407.92s: here so you can see that investors are
410.56s: concerned over how strong AI is going to
413.80s: persist and obviously nvidia's ability
417.08s: to continue delivering against that
420.84s: so it's small things like that like
423.16s: literally when you're looking at
424.32s: something like this company that has had
426.76s: the growth it's have that is if you look
428.52s: through all of this it looks so good
430.04s: it's got a $50 billion share buyback
432.80s: coming out like it's crushing it Market
436.04s: doesn't care the market had priced in
439.28s: this absolutely insane trajectory that
442.84s: was obviously sooner or later going to
445.36s: have to slow down in order for this
447.60s: stock to reasonably consolidate
450.08s: to deliver the value that we're now
452.00s: discounting out into the future so that
453.56s: it kind of like makes sense so again we
456.60s: closed at 12561 and now we're down in
458.84s: the 116s it's still not a big drop right
461.52s: it's $120 product and it's down about 10
464.28s: points so not even 10% yet however if I
469.04s: look at the overall story here it's a
473.12s: great lesson in earnings how to think
475.68s: about earnings and how to interpret
478.28s: earnings because I think so many people
481.04s: get it wrong and they look at this
482.64s: plainly and they say wait a minute uh 68
485.52s: is higher than 59 why would this crash
487.60s: for all of those reasons I just
488.92s: explained now during the live session
490.84s: later today we'll go way deeper into the
492.92s: earnings release itself I'm going to
494.20s: pull up the earnings uh presentation so
496.16s: that we can learn because this is a
498.00s: fascinating company at a fascinating
500.16s: point in time that I think is worth deep
502.20s: diving a little bit into now another
504.48s: company with another example is chewy
508.24s: and this is another fascina one because
510.84s: let's take a look at this its previous
513.16s: earnings came in at it was expected at 4
516.36s: cents and it came in at
519.76s: 31 huge beat that's way off not even
523.00s: close and in that scenario we saw this
526.20s: massive Gap up from 16 essentially to 19
530.72s: and then it ran all the way up to over
533.12s: 20 Big Move following this giant
536.48s: earnings beat then we have another very
539.84s: interesting scenario we were where we
541.84s: were expected at 3 cents and we came in
544.88s: at 24 cents another massive epsb massive
551.12s: yet we're up 11% today that's it to me I
556.76s: was entirely underwhelmed by the
558.96s: movement today for this that's a huge
562.44s: beat that's huge three cents versus 24
566.76s: again not even close this massive beat
569.48s: but again this shows you the incentive
571.48s: structure if you look at this past one
573.52s: you're like okay guys well we guessed it
575.16s: was going to be four and it came in at
576.48s: 31 we probably got to get that a little
578.20s: better next time okay boss well for this
581.12s: one I think it's going to be three cents
584.12s: right now I want to be clear you can't
587.68s: compare quarter over quarter directly
590.48s: there is a difference between the
592.24s: circumstances in a quarter over quarter
594.64s: versus a year over-year comparison it's
597.44s: why it's really important to look at
598.64s: both because the environment where we're
600.92s: at in an economic cycle all of that
603.72s: impacts the earnings which is exactly
606.12s: why you'll generally see both of those
608.20s: quarter over quarter and year over year
610.88s: so quarter over quarter we still did a
612.88s: great job here we came in at 24 cents I
615.04s: actually haven't gone back this far but
616.24s: let's see this was expected at Nega -6
618.44s: cents came in at
619.92s: 15 and this came in at negative3 cents
622.32s: and positive 15 right like how is an
625.16s: analyst that off that regularly imagine
629.84s: if this was anybody else's job and you
632.64s: whatever you did depended on being even
634.96s: marginally close to this and you were
637.28s: this far off a weatherman would get
639.44s: fired faster than this and a weatherman
641.32s: or person sorry is never right anyways
644.08s: they're always wrong too because they're
645.68s: trying to guess the weather so I this is
648.72s: just another really fascinating example
652.52s: of markets and all these small intricate
655.28s: nuances about how they behave how we
658.00s: frame things these conflict of interests
660.48s: and the way that underlyings move in
663.44s: response to what seems to be in this
665.56s: case a massive
668.00s: outperformance but the market just did
670.52s: not really care about it on this again
674.20s: 20 C outperformance even higher than
677.44s: that 20 cent plus outperformance the
679.80s: market gave us 11% move and of that 11%
683.56s: if we look at the volume today 43% of
686.72s: that volume was sale volume
689.40s: so it's like to me it's comical really
692.68s: is what it boils down to it's comical
694.64s: and it makes sense to me why so many
697.00s: investors would look at this and be
698.28s: confused because again to the
699.72s: uninitiated it makes no sense and I got
702.72s: to be honest with you even for the
704.60s: initiated I've been in markets this my
706.44s: 17th year it still doesn't make sense
708.48s: dog I don't know how we could be this
710.36s: off for this long but again it joking
713.00s: aside it goes back to the incentive
714.48s: structure and it goes back into why it's
717.16s: so important to have a keen eye and a
720.20s: Discerning interpretation of things you
723.00s: cannot take much of life let alone the
725.44s: stock market at face value and I noticed
728.48s: that as I continue to get older and
730.92s: older that there's so much Nuance that I
733.80s: used to miss as a younger dude that's
736.12s: kind of just taking things at face value
738.12s: and trying to process a lot of stuff
739.64s: super fast this is another great example
742.56s: of that so I thought the earnings in
744.96s: here was also interesting again on the
746.44s: live session later today we'll pull up
748.28s: the actual earnings report and go
749.48s: through it so the last thing I want to
751.20s: take a look at is GameStop and it's for
753.60s: two reasons one we broke down below this
755.68s: support which I don't love at all we did
758.24s: see volume tick up just a little bit 5.1
760.88s: mil against the 20-day average of 5.3
764.52s: which still slightly below but still a
766.32s: tick up but the vast majority was sale
767.84s: volume 98% so what this looks like to me
771.80s: is now we're entering a bit of a value
773.44s: area I would fully expect this to drift
776.24s: down towards this 18 handle unless again
779.36s: some sort of catalyst or news this looks
782.00s: like the likely direction for us to go
784.64s: because I'm just using where I'm seeing
786.40s: people wanting to buy the stock and
788.64s: there's a giant Gap here so when there
790.40s: aren't biders coming in to move the
792.40s: stock up that typically leads us to fall
794.56s: down and that's kind of what I'm
797.16s: expecting here and then the next volume
798.68s: node that's serious at all is down here
801.08s: at like 1525 1550 somewhere in there so
805.04s: we'll see how it goes as per usual I
807.20s: always say something like GameStop is
808.72s: fascinating because it doesn't abide by
812.04s: normal rules and as soon as there's some
813.84s: sort of meaningful Catalyst that we
817.64s: completely can undo every little bit of
820.24s: this down move and you can run up and
822.68s: literally start mooning just because of
825.40s: a change in circumstance which is again
829.20s: it's kind of what makes things like
830.48s: GameStops uh GameStop or other meme
833.48s: stocks so interesting is how fast these
837.40s: small to midcap companies can pivot
839.68s: which is more Akin sometimes to much
841.84s: smaller cap stocks but these things can
844.08s: start flying again we went from 9 to
847.08s: 65 so it's like yeah this thing can move
850.04s: as soon as it wants that's a month time
851.88s: frame that it made that move
854.32s: so keep an eyeball on it that's all I
856.72s: can say that's what I see here now the
858.52s: other thing I do want to highlight
860.40s: because I finally feel Vindicated is
863.20s: this here so earnings is now confirmed
865.72s: for the 10th after the market close and
868.36s: this is what I was talking about on
869.88s: Sunday
