1.12s: what's up everyone we're on the mobile
2.48s: setup figured expiration day time to
5.16s: take a look at GameStop and see what's
7.44s: going on and I think to everybody's the
10.44s: light we are above 30 and for those well
15.32s: I think everybody has to be aware of by
17.52s: now but we also did get a visit from the
21.80s: cat he popped out on 25 December what
26.04s: time did he post this at 07 a.m. so
29.40s: again that I don't know if that's a
30.60s: scheduled post or just like him being
33.12s: very very specific with his timing but
37.00s: he posted this and as per usual I have
40.60s: no idea what it means it seems like
42.80s: maybe just a Christmas post but lots of
45.08s: people are digging in I saw people
46.84s: posting um the the PO hex codes and then
52.00s: trying to figure out what that might
53.36s: mean so if you have a theory on what
56.72s: this is I actually would love to know
58.72s: cuz I don't know and actually let's poke
60.64s: through this really quick cuz it's
61.92s: trending and let's see what everybody
63.88s: says oh it's cuz it's above
65.84s: 32 which is
69.32s: great uh this person is talking about
72.16s: Black Rock
73.68s: adding so it looks like everybody stoked
76.12s: that we're above 30 which is absolutely
77.84s: great love that yep perfect and this is
83.12s: one of the things we talked about
84.88s: actually on one of our recent live
88.36s: streams because GameStop here is really
92.36s: interesting to me because I know a lot
94.40s: of people thought that the 30 handle was
97.20s: going to be a bit of a challenge for it
100.12s: and it blew right through it and it's
102.68s: been steady above 30 ever since 23
106.04s: December it's been steady steady steady
108.76s: then even on the down tick today
110.68s: although a really big candle meaning the
113.48s: the Wicks are big people are battling
115.40s: over price it's still a very small body
118.52s: inside move and we cracked 32 so it
122.44s: wasn't even pushed down below 32 which
125.88s: is pretty interesting and we expected
127.96s: some of this because the post roaring
131.56s: kitty pop from his post on Christmas
135.36s: which I genuinely do believe that's
137.92s: probably one of the larger catalysts
139.84s: here and the reason for this move both
143.00s: the mix of retail participants and then
145.16s: also probably alos getting involved and
148.40s: as we've seen before because we seen
150.24s: when he posted that stuff about chewy
152.16s: and whatnot I mean as soon as he posts
154.48s: there's millions of volumes in seconds
157.04s: so there's just that's not retail that's
159.08s: way too fast and today on the downtick
164.12s: post it really hung within the shadow of
167.56s: the prior candle which is pretty
169.04s: interesting to me because this means
170.80s: that even though this had a pop based on
173.16s: that as a catalist the market is still
175.44s: kind of respecting it and it's not being
177.32s: rejected all the way back down so if we
180.24s: take a look at a RSI so this is using
185.48s: RSI along with a 7day moving average we
190.12s: can see that RSI is at
193.04s: 6155 and it's still above the moving
195.52s: average and the moving average is a
196.92s: 7-Day vwap moving average so these are
200.32s: pretty effective for detecting downside
203.68s: momentum when it starts to build and the
206.24s: moving average is still upward sloping
208.36s: volatility is still very high
211.84s: 62% and if we Zoom this out to a year we
217.60s: can see a few things the main thing is
220.04s: there is a beast of a volume node now
223.12s: built at 28 37 that range there so this
228.96s: becomes like the new floor for GameStop
232.08s: provided that there's not some sort of
234.76s: massive new information that changes the
237.12s: fundamentals of the company this becomes
239.12s: like the except fundamental value floor
242.44s: of a company because it's been
243.80s: transacting at this level for at least a
247.24s: month now and it's not been pushed down
249.76s: even with its earnings it definitely had
251.60s: a bit of a Down tick but it performed
254.32s: okay during earnings because of interest
256.52s: earned on the cash hord it's sitting on
259.56s: so really really strong performance from
262.40s: Gamestop that's what I see here the fact
263.96s: that it rallied on this and it kept it
266.80s: and it's still hanging above 30 it does
269.76s: does look like 30 starts to become the
271.76s: next handle to beat we can see there's
274.28s: two volume profiles there's one here at
276.00s: 28 36 where I'm sorry volume nodes on
279.40s: the volume profile then there's another
281.20s: here at
282.08s: 2888 but this 30 handle looks to be
285.68s: pretty well respected now let's take a
287.80s: look at the
291.24s: options and really high near-term V uh
296.16s: shortterm V is dips a lot and then we
300.04s: see it picking way back up on 17 genan
303.16s: and a big reason that you see the 17
305.72s: genan volatility like that is because
308.88s: there are a lot of options there so
312.20s: right now there's
313.44s: 892,00 calls against 2 180,000 puts and
317.60s: if we take a look at that 17 Jan
319.36s: literally half 428,000
322.40s: calls are in the January expiration so
327.00s: January is going to be spicy as it comes
329.76s: up now if we take a look at today's
333.20s: expiration first off this is like the
335.08s: first time in a long time we didn't have
336.92s: to pour one out for the 30s that expired
339.72s: out of the money and they're they're in
341.04s: the money and actually happy here we can
343.32s: also see that the market had a cough up
345.44s: for the 31s because another 7,000 were
348.76s: added so that means there's another at
351.00s: least thousand added on top of this and
352.92s: then take a look at the volume on the
354.52s: 32s
357.32s: 24,700 against 79 960 so what that means
361.36s: is the overwhelming majority of this
363.32s: volume today was stacked onto these 32s
367.52s: and that kind of buying activity by the
370.76s: market makers likely is is a
372.44s: contributing factor as to why price held
374.36s: so strong that it did because with that
376.52s: amount of volume coming in at the money
378.24s: on expiration day that forces
380.80s: essentially direct hedging activity in
383.04s: the open market in order to to be able
386.00s: to cover these positions for those that
387.52s: are going to take assignment on the
388.80s: shares now again a lot of people will
391.44s: probably flatten out their positions to
393.60s: capture the
396.00s: profit but there's a lot of people that
398.88s: will be taking shares at 32 which looks
401.20s: really interesting to me so now let's go
403.76s: out to three Jan really
405.92s: quick and see what's going on here so
408.68s: it's 62k against 14 so 3 gen is also
411.64s: really really stacked on the call side
413.96s: 10 Jan 21k against 4700 less so and
418.56s: let's take a look at at
421.04s: volatility and see if we still have the
423.96s: standard uh let's look at the out of the
425.88s: money specifically and I want to look
428.32s: and see if we have call skue we don't on
430.40s: three Jan we don't on 10 Jan and we
434.40s: don't on 17 Gen so that's a little bit
436.56s: different that we have now puts
439.32s: dominating a little bit more there's the
441.28s: call finally 7 Feb pretty heavy call
444.36s: skew by the way and then same thing here
447.04s: and again a quick reminder why I look at
448.76s: this call skew
450.40s: because it lets me see where the market
452.28s: is pricing in movements so when I see
455.28s: Heavy call skew to the upside it means
458.20s: that the market is expecting larger
461.00s: upside moves which is why it prices
463.40s: those options more expensively because
465.84s: that's where the expectation is so it's
468.04s: not until a bit further out in time 17
470.76s: April and then it's so it's essentially
472.48s: from that period on that we see the call
474.80s: skew which was what 7 FB interesting so
478.36s: the market is definitely ing in further
481.04s: dated upside moves but just
484.72s: not super near term volume today 247,000
488.96s: calls against 56,000 puts massive call
493.48s: volume a lot of call sales which makes
495.96s: sense people closing their calls at a
498.12s: profit because there is pretty
499.76s: significant profit taking opportunities
502.20s: most of the volume as expected would be
504.16s: for today 27 December that's people
505.96s: either closing positions rolling them
507.36s: out or building new positions like we
509.64s: can see on those 32s that ended up
513.12s: expiring in the money so really really
515.32s: interesting now I also wanted to take a
517.36s: look at two other
519.48s: things thing is the general options flow
522.80s: that we saw for this past week so we can
526.76s: see a few things that kind of stuck out
530.00s: to me the first thing is there were a
533.48s: handful of way further out in time
538.12s: massive puts being traded coming in at
541.32s: the offer so these are people buying
543.72s: puts in the 120 expiration way out in
548.00s: 2026
550.28s: $98,000 $892 $450 this is probably the
554.68s: same entity that's building into this
556.80s: position that would be my guess but I
558.72s: mean this has gone on a little while now
561.00s: we've seen this these puts being tacked
563.88s: out here again you can see being
566.24s: transacted at so that's something I've
568.36s: been keeping an eye on there's a lot of
570.52s: different reasons why that can be a
575.00s: target for people it can be used for
578.28s: broader portfolio purposes depending on
581.20s: the entity and what they're holding it
583.20s: can be done for directional speculation
586.28s: so there's a lot of different ways that
588.56s: this can be used even to help with
590.48s: locates uh as part of synthetic
592.56s: positions we've seen now coming up a
594.60s: little bit more so the the size of these
597.68s: is interesting just because it doesn't
599.76s: represent a lot of shares and when
601.72s: you're trying to use stuff for like
603.52s: locates and stuff like that you wouldn't
604.72s: necessarily want to go out this far in
605.92s: time and this isn't that big of a
608.48s: position so if you're trying to acquire
611.28s: locates for a 50 lot it's just really
615.80s: really small number of shares in order
618.48s: to do that so it to me seems more of a
623.80s: speculative directional play as far as I
626.76s: can see and that those were like the
629.76s: biggest trades that I saw come through I
631.88s: always sort this by premium and there
634.28s: wasn't a ton on the call side except we
637.44s: did have the 15s also out in 2026 and
641.32s: you can see that this is still over half
643.12s: a million dollars between these two
645.08s: positions 2 minutes apart probably the
648.24s: same entity I would feel pretty
649.72s: confident guessing at that and then the
652.00s: other thing I wanted to take a quick
653.08s: look at is Max pain and you can see that
655.36s: max pain today was $
657.40s: 29.50 and we definitely closed deep
660.68s: within max pain again good reminder max
664.04s: pain does move throughout the day but my
667.32s: guess is a lot of hedging activity that
669.08s: was probably done by the market makers
671.20s: propped the stock up a little bit more
673.00s: today because they they had to acquire a
675.12s: lot with those
676.60s: 20,000 plus contracts coming through
679.56s: that's not an insignificant amount so
682.32s: really really strong day for GameStop
684.64s: even though the broader Market was down
687.36s: extensively GameStop had a generally
690.40s: inside day which on a relative basis
692.80s: indicates strength it was down just
694.60s: 2.39% which is pretty solid so as always
698.12s: anything you want me to take a look at
699.36s: let me know be an outlier I'll see you
701.00s: later
