0.72s: we have a gift from the vaal gods today
3.60s: the sibo launched the one day vix and
8.16s: for those that don't know the vix vix
10.56s: typically looks out 30 days so I want to
13.80s: talk to you about this product what it
15.36s: is how it works and then how you can use
17.58s: it what's up everybody Eric here welcome
19.68s: back to all the outliers a shout out to
21.84s: the patreon family thank you guys so
23.28s: much for the love I cannot tell you how
25.38s: awesome it is and let's get right into
27.00s: this video the very first thing why do
30.36s: we need or why do we now have a one-day
32.94s: volatility index and it's because of
34.92s: demand and I'm going to show you a chart
37.56s: in just a second that shows you the
39.96s: disposition of zero DTE SPX utilization
43.92s: by Traders and it's massive but this is
47.76s: what we have now this is kind of like
49.50s: the standard which is vix and as I
51.78s: mentioned this is a 30-day future
53.82s: volatility of SPX now it's important to
58.14s: note that because it looks out 30 days
60.30s: it loses a lot of sensitivity in super
63.72s: short-term time frames so there's two
65.64s: things that coalesce here we have a gap
67.68s: for that kind of product and we have a
69.48s: dramatic rise in the use of short-term
73.08s: options I want you to take a look this
74.64s: is from Goldman Sachs and this is from
77.10s: March or April and I want of last year I
80.22s: think and I want to show you guys
82.14s: actually of this year I lied to you
83.70s: because this shows us q1 2023 so yeah
86.28s: this is super recent and as you look at
89.34s: this dark blue this is less than 24
91.86s: hours of SPX volume notice what it was
94.74s: back in 2011. it was what like two three
98.64s: percent something like that notice where
100.68s: it is now and this is all kind of kicked
103.32s: off post covid when we first had kovid
106.56s: backyard you can see a dramatic increase
108.66s: and then it's just been parabolic since
111.06s: whereas now it's literally over 40
113.58s: percent of SPX volume this less than 24
117.60s: hour time frame so there's a giant
120.12s: demand for short-term offerings here but
123.54s: we don't have anything at least before
125.64s: today that gave us an intraday view to
129.30s: align with this increased demand so
132.48s: let's talk about how it works it's a
135.48s: non-tradable product it's just like the
138.48s: vix one year for those that have seen it
140.10s: so here today is the 24th of April the
143.10s: very first day this launched and we're
146.10s: going to talk about some of the
147.06s: qualities of how this moved because
148.92s: everybody's baffled with what happened
150.96s: today and how it behaved but that is a
154.02s: little bit later I want to show you the
156.54s: product itself so if we go over here to
158.16s: trade notice it has no options it has no
160.56s: bid no asks so this is merely a
162.78s: calculation and I'll show you the
164.10s: computation in a second and for those
165.96s: that don't know because I'm a lot of
167.46s: people think that this is like some sort
168.72s: of super novel thing it's not so if you
170.82s: look up vix one year it's the same exact
173.28s: thing but it just goes out for uh you
175.50s: guessed it full year so if we go in here
176.94s: to trade no bid no ass no options same
178.86s: exact thing it's not a tradable product
180.18s: it is literally just something for us to
182.34s: observe and to use as a tool now does
185.04s: this mean that the vix one day would
187.32s: never be tradable maybe maybe not who
190.32s: knows they could make it a tradable
192.00s: product but based on the press release
193.74s: from the sibo they're not currently
195.12s: planning on it and I will share the
196.92s: links to that in the video description
198.90s: below because
200.52s: um a couple of you in just about a
202.20s: second here are not gonna like your
203.40s: lives anymore because this is the
205.32s: calculation for the one day vix it's
207.72s: really not as crazy as it looks so
210.06s: essentially it's using an aggregate of
211.74s: weighted prices from zero in one day to
214.80s: expiration SPX options that expire in
217.20s: the afternoon calls and puts that's it
219.00s: that's what all of this means so you can
221.70s: you know go through the math I actually
223.20s: encourage you to take a look at it but
225.18s: nonetheless this is what I think you
228.12s: guys should definitely take a look at
230.10s: and this is from the sibo like I said
232.92s: I'll throw a link to this but if you go
234.42s: down here to the bottom you can see
236.40s: where it says the index methodology
238.20s: paper which is very well written and it
241.38s: walks you through exactly how this thing
244.02s: works so and it walks you through in
246.42s: steps so I'm not going to go through all
248.64s: of this in detail because you have
249.78s: access to it if you have any questions
251.16s: on it make sure you let me know but the
253.80s: cool part about this product and the way
255.96s: that we can use it is it gives you much
259.56s: better Fidelity on short-term volatility
262.74s: and it's because today we had nothing
265.38s: that really told us intraday unless you
267.36s: calculated it yourself which you can but
269.70s: now for most people that don't want to
272.52s: do that you have something that is going
275.16s: to give you the calculation by itself so
278.10s: if we take a look at the
280.80s: vix One Day by itself we can start to
285.42s: chart and create
287.12s: relationships this is one of the first
289.02s: ways I would use it between the vix one
291.12s: day and SPX the biggest products in the
293.28s: SPX so that you can understand when this
296.04s: thing moves how other things move
298.08s: because what I will tell you is the
300.96s: market movement that we saw today was a
304.80s: little bit tricky compared to what the
306.60s: vix one day showed us and what I mean by
309.00s: that is if I pull up SPX
311.46s: and let's zoom in from this to let's do
315.84s: it today one minute so you can see the
318.36s: intraday volatility here the percentage
321.06s: move today was 0.6 percent the five day
324.36s: daily range is 0.68 and then the 30-day
328.38s: average true range is smaller than that
330.24s: that calculation is wrong
331.92s: um I have to check the formula here
333.24s: don't look at that but this is correct
335.58s: the five day average Jailer range so as
339.00s: we look at the way it moved today we had
341.94s: an open at 4132 high of 41.42 a low of
345.84s: 41 17. so this was a pretty inside day
349.02s: there wasn't anything remarkable about
350.78s: remarkable about this especially if you
353.10s: we look back over a longer time frame
356.52s: where we can see definitely some larger
359.34s: movements intraday going back you know
362.10s: the last three days so the reason why
364.38s: this is important is because this tells
366.60s: me that the vix one day the computation
368.70s: the way it's getting the data it's still
370.92s: kind of figuring itself out and I think
372.54s: that's an important note I wouldn't use
374.82s: this for any sort of significant trading
377.22s: decisions just yet until we understand
379.98s: how it behaves how the market behaves
382.20s: around it what it correlates to how
385.20s: strong those correlations are one of the
387.30s: things that I think pretty much all
389.16s: Traders need to consider is how
393.54s: something works before you trade it you
396.84s: can figure it out pretty quick but today
399.50s: departs from what most of us would have
401.88s: expected this thing to do so that is an
404.04s: important note because most of us
405.66s: obviously need to observe a little bit
407.64s: more on how this product is going to
410.10s: behave longer term so it's a little too
411.96s: early we're an information gathering
413.58s: mode but what I would Ultra highly
415.38s: recommend is take a look look at how
417.18s: this behaves over the set time frame
419.40s: whatever you want to do the next week
420.54s: two weeks and then take a look at the
422.94s: SPX Definitely Maybe one of the other
425.34s: indices like the Russell but then pick a
427.50s: handful of individual stocks from within
429.78s: the S P 500 and then you can start
431.82s: creating pairs correlations between them
433.62s: which can be a really interesting trade
435.30s: idea so too early right now but
437.28s: something for the back pocket if you
438.60s: have any questions on it let me know
439.80s: I'll have all those links in the notes
441.30s: below be an outlier I'll see you guys
442.50s: later
