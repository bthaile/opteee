 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you After that war stories, I have two specific stories in mind that I want to talk to you about. And then before we wrap, I want to talk about three things looking back over my trading career, which I continually reflect on and the stuff that sticks out to me continues to change because my perspective changes. And I want to talk about three of those lessons to hopefully give you a takeaway for coming to hang out. So before we get started, gotta say hello and thank you to all of you guys because you are the ones that make that number move. Now, I do hope it's a symbiotic relationship because I do my absolute best to share my depth of experience and to provide a different kind of perspective in a space that's riddled with parasites. So for that, I'm actually really thankful on the way that the outlier community has evolved because there's a lot of places we were talking about this yesterday. And I think the day before where there are a lot of places where people are just so interested in what can they get out of being there that it ultimately misses the sense of community. If you think about some of the most important elements of a community, it's the willingness to do something for somebody else even if you get nothing in return. You're expecting nothing in return. But the most beautiful thing happens when you expect nothing in return. Other people pick up on that and then they want to try to do things for you because it's a good feeling. And it's because you're in a place where other people actually give a shit about other people. So I'm really proud of like what we're building. And I thank you for being a part of it because what we do here is really not for everybody. And the way that we do things here is different, which we'll talk a little bit more about later. So before we get in, gotta say hello to everybody. We got Lauren H. Reastark Mark Elizabeth Joey Alberto Sean Jordan. Trey J has made himself known on this one as he should. Trey J is in OG around from the beginner days. Actually, he's going to get a kick out of one of the things we're going to look at together. So let's move this over, put this in front of me so I can easily see. And let's just kind of talk a little bit. Now, the first thing I want to show you quickly is the giveaway. And really, all you need to do is go to this YouTube. It's a YouTube short and follow the instructions that are in that short. And you literally can do that while you're on this stream. If you want, it will enter you in. I'll share the link here. And this way, you might win. And essentially, what I'm giving away is a quick one-on-one conversation with me, hopefully to take a look through whatever it is you're doing to see if we can find some things to focus on to help you with your path. And the reason why I selected that for the giveaway is because when I look at the overall path that I followed from trading, it started with a couple people interceding in my life in a very positive way by essentially sharing information. And then it was me taking that information and continuing to grow rapidly. So I thought that sharing of information is essentially the exact way to kind of keep that theme. The big thing I continually think about is how can I continue paying forward the different things that people have done for me? Because I think it's not pay it forward in terms of like to repay a debt. I don't feel like it's a debt at all. But I do feel like somebody has set a really good example in my life on how to treat and think about other people. And I want to promulgate that because I think it's a good message. So you can head over to this. Check that out if you want. And this is the next one's the fun one. How things started. So this is not my very first YouTube video. This video is like from the 22nd of May 2020. And this is like a couple weeks after I started YouTube. And effectively the entire genesis for starting YouTube, it was during COVID. It was again May of 2020. I know the date really well, because it's the 4th of May. And I was having conversations with my military friends. I very, I'm like an evangelist for things that helped me. And one of them is investing. Now most of my military friends, they're not going to be traders. And I know that they, most of them, they are in a different spot. They have different priorities. But there's still always a really great conversation. And there's always a great way to try and instill some basics. So that's really what I was doing. I was having phone calls with my friends. And I was essentially saying like, hey, where are you guys at with your finances? Because another thing that's different about the military world compared to the civilian world is people are pretty open with one another. It's not this game of like you have to hide or you can't say what your net worth is or how you're doing with your money. Because then they might think like there's none of that. And so I was having conversations with my friends during this time, same where you at. And what are you doing? Because especially during COVID, we saw some really great opportunities for the market. And I'm actually having a lot of those conversations with my friends now, because I think the same on a long term dollar cost averaging lens. And I found myself repeating myself because I was having calls. I was like directly calling them, be like, yo, let's talk for a half hour, hour or whatever. And I was repeating myself a lot. So then I was just like, I will make a YouTube channel. And I will record some videos about like the basics of budget, emergency savings, those kinds of things. And then they'll watch the video before I talk to them on the phone so that when I talk to them on the phone, it's more efficient. That's exactly the genesis of it. Now, there is a really funny story leading into this that I do think is worth mentioning because it's just hilarious. It was probably six months to eight months before that. And before I started a YouTube channel, I have had perpetually less than zero interest in social media. I really don't care at all about social media. The only social media that I've ever maintained typically was a Facebook. And that's because when I was on active duty, I would move around a lot. I wasn't near my family. So it was a way for me actually to stay in touch with my family to just keep a pulse and so that they could see some of what I'm doing typically what you would get if you live close to your family to see people in person. So that's really the only social media I had. And that's an important background because literally a disdain for social media. Then I'm sitting in my office one day trading, just like this sitting right now where I'm at now. And I hear a bunch of things bouncing off my window. It's not raining. And I'm like, what the fuck is this bouncing off my window? I look out. It's like a literal cloud. It's dark. And I was like, what on earth is this? So I walk closer to the window. And it is thousands of bees, thousands. And these bees apparently thought that they wanted to set up their house. They wanted to go right by one of my little rain gutters that takes off this little mini roof that's outside my office. And they were funneling in there. I didn't know this, but fun fact, we live on top of a hill. We're in a really, really cool spot because we're next to a nature preserve, although we're in San Diego. So we really don't have neighbors on entire one side of the house. It's just open views. But one of the downsides of being on a hill, which I didn't know, is that when bee colonies split, they kick half the colony out. They bounce and they have to go find a place to live. Well, bees are a simple creature, which I fully identify with. And as these bees are cruising along, they essentially come up, pretend that this is a hill. They come up to elevation. And then they just slowly meander up the elevation. They're looking for elevation. Well, we're on top of a fucking hill elevation. So the other thing I didn't know is bees have a memory on where they've previously established hives. And so I have a relationship with the prior owners of the house. They built the house. And I was just like, yo, you guys have ever any issue with bees and they're like, yeah, every once in a while they go and they knew exactly where they were. And I was just like, ah, okay, call to beekeeper. Homeboy came out, took care of them, didn't kill them vacuum them up, tried to move them. And what they do is they put chicken wire in the same spot because they'll still come every once in a while to try to get in there. And it's only that one. That's another really funny thing because outside my office, it's like a flat roof that's foam. They did a lot of like commercial grade stuff for some reason. There's a drain on this side. And then maybe 15 feet, 20 feet, there's a drain on the other side. The other side is not chicken wired or anything. They could easily go into that one. They don't care. They like that one. So I'm just chicken wired off. They can't get in there anymore. So as the dude was leaving, he was the beekeeper was leaving. Never met him before, knew nothing about him. This is before I was on social media at all. And he says to me, he's just like, are you, are you a YouTuber or something? And Mel was there. She saw my response. It was like the most incredulous just I couldn't even believe somebody would say that about me. I got such a kick out of that. I thought it was the funniest thing this dude could have said. And I was just like, fuck no, I hate social media. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure as shit. About a year later, yes, then the less than a year, I don't remember the exact time frame. I actually might be able to find it. I started the YouTube channel. So one of the running jokes is that this fucking beekeeper is what started this whole thing like planted that subconscious thought in my mind because at no point in my entire life, what I otherwise have ever even thought of it remotely. But this dude somehow just knew what was up. All right, let's see if I can find these bees. Here they are. All right. So the story is even funnier. Yeah, that's classic. You guys won't be able to see. Yeah, it's too hard to see. Oh my god. I'm gonna upload this really quickly. You guys can see this video. It's actually kind of cool. But that part aside, when would you guess that the bees came to my house? Any guesses? Right now I'm uploading the bee video so you guys can see it. It's like literally crazy. I've not seen something like that before. It was super cool though. All right, uploaded. Let's grab that bad boy. Yeah. And we'll just put it in download. This is cool because I actually think you'll be able to hear it. Yep. So this is literally outside my office window. And there's really no sound to it. All these specs you see right now are freaking bees. And I'll just play it so that I've never seen this before. That's the spot I was telling you that they like to go. I've never seen anything like that in my life. Literally thousands and thousands of them. So that video, I took that on the 20th of April. So the dude would have came out on the 21st of April. The bees got really calm towards the evening. So that was the 21st of April that he would have came to the house in 2020. So then the YouTube channel started just what a couple weeks after that, which is actually even closer flash to bang than I thought. Kind of funny. So the beekeeper is the origin. But yeah, I mean, the beginning stuff that I really created was just answering questions. It was like answering direct questions. This video that you see here was me just talking about VXX versus VIX. And you can see what this is is I literally am just using my laptop camera, my laptop mic on a laptop stand because I still had a main screen that I use like I do now. Whereas a big difference compared to then is I still use a laptop for mobile stuff. But I ended up getting a desktop as well. But that was the original stuff. You can see random stuff behind me on the wall. This is pretty shortly after we ended up moving from our other place into this place. But that is the beginning. The beginning had everything to do with just making some videos to try to help a couple of my friends have better conversations than people started leaving comments and emailing me different questions. So I was just like, I'll make a video for this who cares. It literally takes me two seconds. And that's the literally the entire origin of the YouTube channel. Then I take a look at, comparatively, where we are today. And it's kind of crazy, right? Like you think it used to be just answering a couple of questions here and there. Now we literally have pretty much a stream every single day. There's a podcast part of this. There's a newsletter now. There's at least one week, one video up to three videos a week. And we have this really cool community. Like all this started out of that. And it continues to grow. But one of the main things that I remain committed to and I continually remind myself is I really like progress. And if I'm going to spend time doing something, I want to get better. But with something like social media, interesting challenge for me. And the reason why that it's so challenging is because the things that absolutely do well are things that I personally take issue with. I think it's a disingenuous. I think that it leads people literally to failure. Those kinds of things. So it puts me in a weird spot where the things that I know would work way better to continue growing are things I'm actively not willing to do. And then I kind of reconciled with myself. I was just like, well, I'll literally just focus on continuing to get better at the craft within the bounds that I think are reasonable with in things that I'm comfortable with. And that's effectively what it's been. So I really think a lot about the end user of the videos and the kind of people that are likely to come across things. I'm very, very thoughtful with how they're going to perceive things. And I remember when I was early on in my career and how indebted I was to like any healthy interaction I can find. So now we take a look at a couple of fun stories. So there's two stories that I wanted to talk to you about. The first one on the left hand side, you can see this nice pie graph. They have 66.7% on the right and then 33.3% on the left. This pie graph represents something specific. But if you think about the beginning stages of trading, you all are fairly familiar with the Dunning Kruger effect. I've talked about it before a lot because I think it's very important. The Dunning Kruger effect very often happens very early on in your trading career. For me, it happened in a slightly prolonged time frame. And a big part of that is it just took me longer to figure this stuff out. When I first started trading in 2007, I, like the resources available are nothing like what it is now at all. It's completely different. So a lot of it is this haphazard learning based on the stuff you can come across. So what this graph represents is actually the drawdown on my portfolio from a single very high probability trade that temporarily went against me. This literally was a several day trade where I eviscerated a third of the portfolio. And here's essentially what happened. I was trading really wide iron condors in the rut, though the Russell index itself. And it was a relatively quiet week. The market didn't have a whole lot going on. And I put on this sizeable relative to the account at the time. It was wide the iron, the wings on the iron condor. And it was a really low delta for the shorts. And the reason why I put this trade on, I remember it pretty clearly because this part's imprinted. It was like 500 and something dollars is what I was set to make. And I think I sold it. I don't remember the exact timing. This is a while ago. This happened maybe four or five years into my trading career. I could tell you exactly when it happened. When was it? Yeah, here. One, two, three, four, five years in. Five years into the trading career. And at this point, I'd been spending an insane amount of time because this is like post high school college. And if you went to college, even though I was doing ROTC and stuff, like there's a lot of time in college for extra activities. And I was really efficient at school. I've been obsessed with efficiency my entire life. So this was what I was spending the absolute bulk of my time on. Even more than I was spending in classes and stuff for sure. I would go to my classes, but I mean like the total composite time on like the time you spent for classes versus the time spent on trading is way more. And I put on this really wide R&K condor. It's a pretty short term trade like a week. Definitely less than two weeks. I don't think it was more than that. And I put this trade on and I was so focused on this idea of like, man, if I could make 500 dollars a week doing this, how incredible would that be? How big of a difference would that make? And for me, with where I was at that point in time, tremendous, literally massive difference in my life that would have made. Didn't spend a lot of time thinking about what the trade could look like over the lifespan. I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about what I might do throughout the life cycle of the trade. I was so focused on this 500 dollars that I was going to make. And I was sitting there saying it was like a 90% probability. It was like super high probability of being out of the money. Like I said, the shorts were super low delta, like maybe a 10 delta or something. And I just remember it was a couple days into the trade. And I was going to the gym in the morning. And I was linking up with my buddy that I played rugby with. And as before I went into the gym, took a look at the phone to see how the position was doing. And I saw that it was down big. It was down like 15, 20,000 dollars. Now, remember just sitting there looking at the position, thinking, that's not good. And I had that moment of I should do something, but I was completely frozen. I didn't want to realize that loss. I didn't want to do anything because then the trade's done. So I sat there for a moment and I thought about, well, how much could I lose? Because the trade still had some time left. So we were maybe I don't remember what path to max loss it was. And I remember saying, a look at it when I get in the gym and I'll just think about what I should do here. So I go in, I sit on the bench as we're changing and I look at it again. And it was down more. At this point, it was I don't I don't know if it was quite double that, but it like at one point, it was over a $50,000 loss. So then I was like, that's at this point again, remember, I'm in my this would have been like post undergrad starting of my grad while I was waiting to go to TBS for the Marine Corps because I started my masters then. So at this point in my life, it's a it's a serious amount of money. That's a lot of money at that point. And I remember sitting there thinking, well, I'll have to do something. And I committed to myself that I was going to make a decision before I did my workout. And I ended up waiting a little bit trying to understand the market, trying to understand the move coming up with what I thought may or may not make sense. And I ultimately arrived at the conclusion of this was such a poorly thought out idea that I just close it. Just close it. It could be a max loss. The max loss is much bigger than what I ultimately ended up taking it down at and just take the loss. It's a lot of money. I've made money up into that point. So I know how to trade at least a little bit. This was a really eye opening experience. So I close a trade. I realize the loss and then I go workout with my buddy. During the workout, I wasn't really in like shell shock or anything. I was just like doing the workout. And after the workout, I remember thinking to myself, you have got to make some big fucking changes. Otherwise, this is not going to work. I distinctly remember having that conversation with myself in the locker room. And that conversation persisted into the evening, the next day. And I made a commitment to myself at that point that I was going full pause, pause everything. All the other strategies that I had on, I had other trades on that we're doing okay, took all of them down. And I just full pause. And I said to myself, what what happened here? And what could I do differently? And as I'm doing that, I'm still because the trade itself otherwise would have still been on and passed forward. Fun fact, the trade would have been a full profit. I would have made the 500 bucks. It landed like almost smack dab in the middle of the short strikes. It was, it was just epic. And that resolution mattered a lot to me. The fact that it would have been, it would have been fine. Because I was also thinking man, like, what kind of terrible habits would that have spawned? But I started thinking about what I needed to do and doing a post mortem on what happened. And what I came across in the path of what happened was what I refer to now as Goldilocks analysis. I didn't call it that then. I didn't even really understand what that concept was. But something like that struck me. And what that means is, I was so focused on that $500. What that $500 could have done for me at that point. What it meant to me. The fact that it was a high probability trade, all of these things. And I realized that I completely, completely, or went thinking about what the trade might look like over the life cycle and how I might behave. So as I tell you this story, I'm sure you can think about what I would tell myself then because they're the things that I tell you. And it's because it's the things that after a lot of reflection that one experience literally changed everything. I started thinking about frameworks, how to think about like actually trading at a serious level. And I'd come across a mentor that I indirectly interacted with in the trading space online. And he mentioned this idea of having a trading plan. And I was sitting there thinking like, yeah, I don't have a trading plan. But it seems like a lot of work. I don't really want to do that. And I had heard that before this loss. And after the loss of sitting there thinking, I probably need to have a plan. So I started applying a lot of what I actually learned in the military from a planning process. And because that's one of the things that you primarily do as a marine officer is plan. So I start thinking about how to build a plan. And it's literally that this is like the straight up advice I give you guys. Open up a word doc and just start putting words down. And for me, I'm fortunate in that sense where I really didn't get caught up in like, oh, I don't know what to put. I don't know if this makes sense. I literally just started scribbling down all my ideas. And I start looking at the ideas. And I can start seeing a lot of just half baked things that there's subconscious stuff going on that's not really tracked well. And I'm just looking at what this looked like. And I was just saying like, man, I thought this was going to work. And then I'm looking at my ideas on paper. And I'm realizing that they're complete shit. And that whole experience, again, you have to remember, I had been trading for like five years at that point. I've spent hundreds of hours learning about trading, practicing, testing, all this kind of stuff. So that was such a massive blow to what I thought I had learned. So this loss taught me a couple really important things. The first thing that it taught me is how important it is to spend time thinking through things objectively and less so from the lens that's most appealing to us. And the reason why that's a specific callout is because it's something you have to actively guard against because your brain naturally doesn't want to do that. It doesn't want to deal with the ugly scenarios that are likely to occur at some point. The other thing that this thing is taught me is my visceral reaction as a human being to seeing numbers on the screen and what those numbers meant. It taught me the importance of a healthy detachment from my trading capital. This is another commonality that is born that you've regularly heard me talk about, which is needing to be even keeled, meaning I don't allow myself to get excited after winning trades. And then I don't allow myself to despair after losing trades. I focus on something entirely different. And by doing that, I give myself a much better chance to interface with one of the most challenging things literally in the world, the stock market. And if you don't believe that, think about any, absolutely any shred of people that have tried trading, even that have great jobs, the number of doctors, lawyers, those kinds of people that try trading that have very high paying jobs. And it's because there's a lot of benefits of trading, one of which is it literally is you eat what you kill, but there's no stakeholders at all up down sideways. It is all you. And most people fail. We know the statistics on it, the overwhelming majority of people will fail as traders. And that's what I thought at that time. I thought that I was having this like failure moment. But then I started realizing like all these things that I learned, how much time I had left at this time, I was working my ass off in all sorts of things, meaning I was doing a lot of some things that don't belong on stream. It's nothing like with drugs or anything like that. I'd never got into that stuff because of the military, but it had to do with like cars and the way you drive cars and maybe like wagering on the outcome of your car versus somebody else's car, those kinds of things. And I was flipping motor cycles. I was doing everything I could to make money buying cars fixing them selling them. And I was like, I can make the money back. And I was sitting there thinking how much the college was costing. And the Marine Corps paid for that. Otherwise, there was no chance I was going to go to college. I was actually originally going to enlist. So I was like, I'll be all right. And then that's when I decided to go full stop. And then that's when I decided to get deeply invested in paper trading and trying to figure out this process based approach. So this loss effectively shaped everything about my approach going forward from my expectation of internal analysis to my methodologies with respect to process, which have evolved a lot, by the way. But it introduced me, the importance of these things. It taught me a lot about the human psychology of things. So this one trade was one of my biggest teachers that I ever could have had. And some people are like, oh, wow, you only, you only drew down a third of the account. You didn't blow an account. That's that's incredible. Well, the fact is, at this point, I've been trading for a little while experiencing some luck while saving the amount that I lost on this is effectively the amalgamation of five to six to 10, depending on what the small account is that would have been blown. So the only reason why the account didn't blow is because at this point, I at least had a little bit of pocket change. The other thing is one of the main reasons why I started trading is to put myself in a position to be able to help my mom when she needed it. So I wasn't approaching this trading thing with the idea of like, oh, I'm going to yolo or I'm going to try to 1,000 x my returns, right? Go back to the trade that led to this loss. It was a defined risk trade with really high probability. That's not somebody going out there to yolo. That's me trying to do something conservative to earn the money to, for those other reasons. So it taught me literally to revamp all of that. So that's my first story for you about my most impactful loss by far and something that I use as one of my better teachers that I've been fortunate to have and kind of still escape on the other side. So if there's anything about that story that you're interested in or if there's any questions on it, let me know. If not, we will mosey onto our second story. And the purpose of the second story is to provide a little bit of balance, but also to provide a little bit of scope and scale. So I have some apples. These are so good. It's literally ridiculous. All right. Onto number two. Any guess what this is? You can see the x-axis. This shows you my returns for the past three years compared to the S&P 500. My last two years have been Joey's got it right on the ball. It's me versus S&P 500. And my last two years have been my best trading years ever. There's a couple things I highlight from this. These last two years are literally the two years where I've lowered my return target the most. I used to target at least 15% per year. And then I lowered it to 12, then to 10, then to 8. I didn't lower it because I couldn't hit it. I lowered it because I was at the amount of money I needed in order for the account to do what I wanted. But then these last two years, I effectively just needed to pace inflation. I think I set like a 5% or a 6% return target. And yet these years ended up being some of, well not even some of, literally the two best years I've ever had. What did that teach me? It taught me something really important about the idea of pursuing good opportunities. Now I want to be very clear. My return in both of these years included a healthy dose of luck. The market was very accommodating to me and what I was doing. And I happened to overlay well with those. It's kind of like if somebody is an athlete and they have like a good game. They're just in the zone. It's not necessarily representative of what they always do. But once in a while you like really show up. That's kind of what this was for me. The fun thing about the return in 2023 is that's actually a discounted return. The return is quite a bit larger than this actually. But I took that part of my return out because of how anomalous these couple trades were over just a couple days. And I told you guys a little bit about them. I'm not at a point where I'm ready to talk about them at all because it's stuff that I am still looking for. But in 2023 I had come across something that I had been looking for passively for a very long time. And as soon as I saw it, I understood what I saw. And I immediately put on what I knew to make sense. And it was hands down the largest two day gain of my life. And then some I mean, it was bigger than multiple years. So that event was really interesting. That specific event taught me that even though markets are really, really competitive, really competitive, that there can still be opportunities that seem unrealistic. That seem like you would think they never would exist. They do pop up periodically. The other thing that these two years specifically have taught me is how valuable it is to be able to pivot as a trader and to capitalize on opportunities as you see it. Funny enough, Joey is highlighting one of the trades that was a one of my my better trend following trades in APP. APP was a literal insane trade. That's a little too far I think. I think I got rid of the drawings and stuff. I'd have to look at the actual dates. I want to say that I started getting in on this breakout. I don't remember where the breakout was. It might be this one. The reason why I don't know is because the scale is completely off now because of this move. But I had done a really good job of following this breakout essentially through this entire path. I remember I scaled out a little bit somewhere in here and then I scaled back in on this one and I think this one. And this trade was an absolute insane return. And it was really based on momentum following. I just use options to capitalize on it. That one was a really, really, really solid trade. The other thing that this grouping of years highlights to me that I want to share with you. And it's a really powerful lesson that a lot of people I believe don't pay enough attention to, which is this. Most of my trading career is based on portfolio one. Portfolio one shows you something important. If we take a look at portfolio one, it shows you the different years of returns year, your 12345. And you can see the best return was 10. The worst was two. If you compare that to portfolio three, the best return was 30%. The worst was negative 25. But then the next three returns are 12, 14, 12. What do you notice? Well, this has a insanely good average return of 8.6 percent as compared to 7.4 percent. Way better return. However, what do you notice about the ending value in the compound annual growth rate? The ending value is greater than this. Other approach that has a 1.2 percent higher average return. And the compound annual growth rate is 7.35 compared to 6.87. What this is designed to show you is that there are different ways to beat the market. One of the ways that you can beat the market as a retail trader is not by always outperforming it to the upside. Literally the best year from portfolio one doesn't beat anything other than the worst year in portfolio three. Meaning all four other returns are better than the best year from portfolio one. The difference is this 25% drawdown versus this 10% year. So that is something I think that is grossly under discussed and underappreciated. Because one of the easiest ways for you to win as a trader in terms of outperforming the market is not by outperforming the market to the upside every single year. It's when the market has these big down years. And if this is admittedly a really good return comparative to this not using this as the benchmark. But if the market drops 19% and you're positive 5% that is a massive gap that you now have over the stock market. And it's something to keep in the back of your minds. Something that's really really important because you do not always need to outperform the market in order to outperform the market. This also finally to me represents the maturation of a skill set. The fact that 22 shows you the ability to generate a positive return during a down year. The fact that there's two really really solid years here. Now to bring this all back to Earth, my compound annual growth rate still it used to be in the mid 20s. But now with the last two years factored in it's 31.6% which is a crazy compound annual growth rate. And the main reason why it's that high is not because each year was this crack off of a year although these two were. But it's because I've only lost money two years. It's my first two years of trading in both of them were less than 5%. I've had several years where I've underperformed the market to the upside. But I've almost always no after those first two years I think I've always outperformed the market on down years. Because there weren't many that's why I know 2008 the market was down 37%. I was down 4.2%. 2018 the market was down 4.4%. I was up 13.8%. 22 market was down 19.4. I was up 21.2. So yeah. That's a really powerful thing to keep in the back your mind because it leads to this other thing that again most people who are go paying attention to. Let's say we start with a $25,000 account. You're a good saver. So you're saving $1500 a month on average. Let's say we look over this 20 year timeframe and let's use a 15% variance. What do you notice the difference? Here's what happens. If with this profile you return 10% per year you walk out with a really solid return of $1.2 million. If you outperformed that by average taking it from a 10% return to a 25% return over this 20 year timeframe you now have $6.7 million. The consistency in your returns can be one of the largest generators of your future wealth. Are none. Something to pay attention to. All right. Those are the two stories I have for you. I'm going to move forward into the three lessons. If you have any questions on the stories now's a great time to throw those in or any other questions about the broader trading career or the YouTube stuff if you'd like. Happy to talk about any of that stuff now. I got to pop the door for Thor because it's time for his dinner. I did a question on the Apple piece. I think I'm out now though. Reese says, did you ever dabble with investing or trader always? I started as a trader. I'm sorry I was an investor but I invested for a few months before I pivoted to trading effectively. So what happened was the way I first started in markets was after that teacher introduced me to the idea of investing. I went up to the library at school. I remember this because in ROTC that's the dude. He's a ROTC instructor. He introduced to me the idea of investing. Library was right above where the ROTC part of the school was. So I just walked up and I started combing through stuff. One of the things that he mentioned to me is a good starting point is to buy what you know. So at this point I remembered things like Netflix were really really exciting. The iPods were so cool. That was a really big thing. So I started buying little tiny pieces of these different companies and over the next few months they actually started making a ton of money in terms of a percent return. In terms of a gross dollar return the positions were so small it didn't matter. I didn't have much money. So I saw that momentum and I was thinking like damn if this is me just not doing anything else then maybe if I got better at trading I can make more money faster and that's effectively when I made the jump into trading was pretty much a few months into when I first opened up my account and started buying those first few names. So that's pretty much the only time I've ever been a quote-unquote investor in the stock market. Now outside the stock market I am a really heavy investor. I am still super active as an angel investor and I'm super active in real estate. Again more so the commercial side now used to be residential and then I've kind of scaled a little bit and I've moved dominantly into commercial real estate. I mean when I look at the the way that I've built money over my whole life I've never been one of those people that picked one thing and just did one thing. I've always been what we would refer to as not but I don't know if this will connect with you guys if you'll understand what I mean or not but I've always been a hustler and that's not hustling in the context of like trying to take advantage of people. It's hustling in terms of doing a lot of different things to try to make money. So first it was always about trying to generate greater gross returns so income and then I started getting into different kinds of investments once I had a little bit of money. I helped a buddy open up a media business DJing in Dubai. That was like one of my first angel investments and the that was a whole other experience when great in the beginning and then it went terrible. It ultimately reconciled but that was a massive learning experience. And then I've stayed in angel investing more so because I think it's super super interesting. It's not necessarily because it's the greatest returns on planet earth. It really isn't and the liquidity obviously is awful but there are decent returns but it's not I would like if I had to pick one I would pick trading for sure over angel. I just like it a lot. And then real estate it's a great fit for the broader portfolio. It's just like the way I talked to you about trading where I always start at the portfolio level then kind of click in and click in and try to build something based on this broader context of what my total portfolio looks like and what I think I need at the time like those kinds of things. It's the same thing with my financial footprint. The thing that I try to remind people that is I also think broadly underappreciated is people think like oh my god trading is so risky. You know it's crazy to do that but here's what I think about as a trader you're on your phone clicking buttons but here is one income stream then maybe as you're a trader you also get in your car and you door dash if you're a smaller trader there's your second income and then maybe you spend a little time figuring out how to fix things in between your door dashing and you proxy for jobs as a handyman there's your third income and so on and so forth then as your pile of money this is active income then as your pile of money grows these are stacks of money on a platter in case you were wondering, bags of money. What you do is you continue reinvesting some of this into the trading side of the business and then you break off a piece of it and then you start putting it into other assets that now allow you to generate other investment income. So you have your direct income then you have your investment income multiple sources from both of them. This is a highly robust individual. This is the kind of person where if there's a big market downturn or if your entire industry or job you become automated out of a job or technology moves away from whatever your industry is you're not fucked. You might not be happy your dominant income might still suffer massively but you're not destitute. One of the biggest issues that I see with regular people is they work a W2 and then they might have a 401k which doesn't really matter in the near term as far as income and they might have a buy and hold portfolio which also doesn't really help us in terms of income in the short term. This lacks all robustness. As soon as this W2 is cut this person is in a massively compromised situation. Either they need to find another job which is okay a lot of people can accurately do that but when you do that you have to play the game. You literally have to essentially say I need this W2 income so bad that I'm going to do whatever it takes and that comes with costs. It comes with costs on your time, your effort, where you're directing your energy. It comes comes out of cost of your morals. Things that you agree with doing things that you don't agree with doing but you do it for the sake of the job because you really need the job. It puts you in a total compromised situation regardless of all of the other factors. This is exactly the way that I thought about building money. The world of investing is still very important to me but just not in the stock market because I trade in the stock market but I absolutely invest in other things and it's to build that broader robustness. Ben says why did you choose this path instead of some of the other profitable traders who make higher returns? I've talked about this actually quite a lot. The main thing is when I first started trading I valued consistency a lot and it's because I didn't know how good I was going to be or how viable this thing was going to be but I thought being able to honestly outperform the market on most years would effectively serve my need and my need ultimately was to be in a position to take care of my mom. My mom was an occupational therapist for a public school district for mentally handicapped kids. She got paid nothing and she was a contractor so she had no retirement with them and she's single. She's by herself. She's not good with money. So what does that mean? Well, it means as a young man I can kind of see the writing on the wall that there's going to be a fucking problem at some point because she can't do that job forever. It's very physical. So that's exactly why I started with that as a target and then when I started realizing how much money you can make as long as you maintain that return profile it's like it comes to the question of like literally how many gold coupons do you need meaning money in kind of a condescending way because again let's just take a look at a couple scenarios. If we have this $25,000 account let's say that you're better at saving you have multiple jobs. You have $2,500 a month you have a 20 year timeframe and let's say again you earn this modest return excess over the stock market of 15% where does that put you in 20 years? Well in 20 years you'd be at $1.8 million outright in 20 years with this other return profile you're at $3.5 million. That to me this profile to me seemed very achievable and that still put me in a position to have plenty of money. Now it's been fortunate where again my compound annual growth rate is effectively double that so the returns become really really healthy but what I cared about most was hitting that base case of making sure that I was in a spot one to buy back my own autonomy meaning my ability I like working and I still consult with an industry like I like working it's good for me. However I like having choice and autonomy. That means that if I'm given a task that I don't agree with I'm able to say no I'm not going to do that or I'm able to advocate for what I think is better without the concern of oh what happens to me if I do this that's kind of really important to me to have that self-autonomic. Ben says I just want to at this point you have the skills and mindset to most likely do what they do maybe it's just you like where you are. I guess the what do you mean I don't know what the comparison is here because again like I would look at the returns on the last two years and I mean that's a demonstration of capability but like I'm not capable of unlimited returns there's a reality based on what I'm able to achieve based on my skillset and based on what I can do so I guess I'm not sure like what the reference benchmark is when you refer to like other traders quote-unquote but what I can tell you again is if you look at some of the the best returns of traders let's just take a look what are the best 25 year agger traders in the world let's see um I'm actually going to ask that to chat GPT because the Google search is let's see what this says because my guess is soros will be up there buffet will be up there yet obviously gym simons drunk miller so drunken miller so gym simons returned 39 percent stand drunken miller 30 percent George soros 30 percent warm buffet 19.8 percent lynch 29 percent David Tepper 30 percent Paul Tutor Jones 20 percent Ken Griffin 19 percent Dalio 14 percent the point that I'm making is like the fact that I'm even returning anything even close to what those kinds of people are is literally a miracle and it's because the game's easier for me absolutely when you're an institution at that size there's skills far outweigh mine they're literally just laden down with their the rules they have to follow so yeah I'm not sure like the quote-unquote path of other profitable traders and what it looks like but I've been in this game long enough to know what's realistic over a long term time frame so if the suggestion is like that there's long term traders that are returning 75 percent compound annual growth rates over 25 years literally call utter bullshit on it it's overwhelmingly not the case so yeah the the thing that I've really valued is consistency I think consistency really grants those core things that matter a lot to me which is first freedom combined with being able to take care of my mom but then after that's accomplished kind of just continuing to pad things because as I continue to build more wealth the reason why I'm focused on that is because it opens up more opportunities to do other things so that's the that's the way I look at it but I mean even at this point now we have way more than we need for sure and I enjoy a lot the the world of trading I am like I'm essentially obsessed with markets markets are something that I I cannot express like how deeply I enjoy it it's such a fascinating exercise everything from mastery of yourself ability to synthesize information how good your systems are I told you earlier in the stream that I'm obsessed with efficiency how efficient you are gets tested here and then your ability to self-regulate self-identify there's so much to do and it's incredibly fun so yeah that's kind of where I'm at why I do things now but with respect to you know the the other traders thing I honestly don't know who the other benchmarks you're using are but I already know that based on what I can do that I'm probably pretty close to like what the terminal rate is because to be clear I don't think I'm actually long-term capable of a 31% compound annual growth rate like I fully expect that to guide down and it's because I I don't think I'm as good as people like Dr. Kim Miller or Simon's like there's just a reality like those are really smart dudes that have built an empire around their skill set so I kind of I guess it's a a function of also like understanding the world as it is all right on to the next thing three lessons that effectively changed everything for me the first one is the hardest hands down the first one is that annoying advice you hear people say such as don't worry about the money and it will come whenever I heard that early on I was always like bitch I am worried about the money I want the money I'm so worried about the money and then as I start to understand what that means it's why I purport the same message to you now the world of trading is entirely about how robust how effective your process is how well can you ingest information how well can you adapt and how well can you employ your skill set if you become over focused on the output of an individual trade at any point in time it is to your own detriment no one trade matters provided that you have decent risk control measures if you have 100% drawdown on a trade than that trade matter a lot but it means you failed in other places I mean more so within the bounds of normal return profiles the reason why process so matter matter so much is because you literally have to learn to reward yourself for following the process effectively and you have to reward yourself for emphasizing the process over seeing what the P&L is from an individual trade because ultimately the process is what feeds your long-term performance it's not anyone individual trade as I look back over my trading career it's literally thousands and thousands of trades no one of them matter it's everything about how all of them come together in the long run so this one is really difficult to accept and I imagine most people won't be able to accept it because I wasn't but what I can tell you is that if you do focus on the process you will have a much much much much better chance to actually make the money that you're trying to make so food for thought next one moderated ego the reason why I mentioned this is because a lot of people will say like oh ego is bad you shouldn't have an ego like that's complete bullshit you need an ego an ego is what festers in your mind and you uncomfortable laying there in bed because you're shit like I could have done a little bit more today I could have done something else today to move this thing forward like ego does translate to drive and trying to accomplish different kinds of goals so I don't approach this comment from the concept of ego is bad it's not but it does need to be moderated because I do believe very frequently the ego can get out of control easily and you can start and this by the way this isn't something that's like relegated to men that's another thing that's complete bullshit where it's like men have big egos and women never do it's not even about the external manifestation of the ego I'm talking more so the internal manifestation of the ego in different ways and people can experience negative ego in a few key internal ways which I'll explain one of them is if you are uncomfortable with placing a trade let's say let's say you're timid you're uncomfortable placing a trade and it's easier for you to avoid the discomfort of placing a trade by simply not placing a trade that's an internal expression of ego that literally is led to a negative outcome if it's otherwise a trade that you should have placed based on your plan it's the same thing where if you in the analysis of your trades you just kind of like oh I lost this one because of this reason you kind of like mentally discounted oh I lost this one for this reason that was really unique in this one circumstance so that obviously wouldn't happen again that's also the ego not wanting to confront the reality of the performance so ego is not bad ego is good if it's controlled so it's something to consider and it's kind of anti what a lot of people say is like oh you can't have an ego trade like a robot like that's all bullshit doesn't mean anything all right last one think differently this is why we are the outlier community it's why I'm obsessed with outlier performance it's because in order to be successful in this you have to do things differently than the majority of people and those kinds of statements can be a little frustrating sometimes because people always do this thing of like everybody else is so dumb and I'm so smart or you know like those kinds of little games which is kind of annoying but I'll show you I'll show you what I mean if we go here you'll see that the majority of people don't don't do well in this so you if so facto have to do things differently than them so when we think about how to think differently from a starting point it's actually really simple we should literally just think about it from well how do other people do this that's a great starting point and then you can pivot off of that like for example a lot of traders think from the point of convenience what works for me what do I prefer to do that doesn't work well and so on and so forth so you have to challenge the way that you frame things with yourself because if you do things like everybody else you're gonna have the same results as everybody else which unfortunately is quite poor in trading decent for investing but quite poor in trading all right it is now time for our giveaway so what I'm gonna do is quickly go to that link and then I'm going to count the number of comments and then I'm literally just gonna tell chat you PT to pick a number so it looks like there's 37 I'm gonna cut well a bunch of them are gonna be me so let me there's not that many so let me scroll through this one nine 19 19 so you have a one and 19 chance of winning pretty good all right chat you PT pick pick a number between one and 19 that's random the number is 17 so that that looks like our boy wheel strat joe who would have picked that congratulations to send your wheel strat joe if you shoot me an email we'll find a time to talk a little bit about the stuff that you're doing in the portfolio and to hopefully see if we can find a way to help out you're an interesting case too honestly exactly have talked to you for a while now in the discord so I'm pretty excited from that lens because we'll have a pretty good starting point to work off of so hopefully we'll be able to help out a little bit I think so all right first off last off I guess I should say now I am so stoked like I'm it gives me so much purpose to have our community of people that are interested in this from the lens of somebody I really enjoy teaching and from the lens of somebody that enjoys teaching having people that are genuinely interested in the stuff that you teach and the stuff that you work on is so cool it's the ability to talk about this thing that I'm obsessed with with other people which is incredible it's so fun so I am extremely eager my goal for the end of the year is 40,000 subs I am so far behind that it's not even funny the probability of that happening is very low but it's the goal I started with so I will continue to reiterate that goal simply because if I don't hit it then you all should also see me miss a goal and I don't want to I'm gonna see what I can do to continue innovating and avoid that but the other thing is if I miss it I miss it the way I look at growing our community I care so much more about having people find their way into our community that are quality people over the number of people when there's why I care about subs on YouTube honestly it's two reasons the first one is because it does show it's a benchmark that I can measure that does show if more people are interested in staying around because then that obviously reflects that I'm doing stuff that they find valuable this second thing is when I'm reaching out for podcasts and stuff like that it's much easier to talk to people and to invite them on to collaborate on content or to record a podcast if you have a following because a lot of other people that's a big factor for how they choose to get their reputation out so that's just the reality of things so from those two lenses does matter to me but I am really really stoked to keep talking along with everybody as always if you need anything you can always find me around in the discord and be an outlier you guys later
