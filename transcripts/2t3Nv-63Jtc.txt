502.00s: you
504.00s: if you
506.00s: respect
508.00s: do here is really not for everybody. And the way that we do things here is different,
513.54s: which we'll talk a little bit more about later. So before we get in, gotta say hello to
518.56s: everybody. We got Lauren H. Reastark Mark Elizabeth Joey Alberto Sean Jordan. Trey J has
528.00s: made himself known on this one as he should. Trey J is in OG around from the beginner days.
536.76s: Actually, he's gonna get a kick out of one of the things we're gonna look at together. So let's
541.00s: move this over, put this in front of me so I can easily see. And let's just kind of talk a little bit.
549.64s: Now, the first thing I want to show you quickly is the giveaway. And really, all you need to do is go to
559.24s: this YouTube, it's a YouTube short and follow the instructions that are in that short. And you literally
566.12s: can do that while you're on this stream. If you want, it will enter you in. I'll share the link here.
572.76s: And this way, you might win. And essentially what I'm giving away is a quick one-on-one conversation
582.12s: with me, hopefully to take a look through whatever it is you're doing to see if we can find
589.24s: some things to focus on to help you with your path. And the reason why I selected that for the
594.44s: giveaway is because when I look at the overall path that I followed from trading, it started with
603.00s: a couple people, interceding in my life in a very positive way by essentially sharing information.
608.76s: And then it was me taking that information and continuing to grow rapidly. So I thought that
616.68s: sharing of information is essentially the exact way to kind of keep that theme. The big thing I
623.16s: continually think about is how can I continue paying forward the different things that people have
630.12s: done for me? Because I think it's not pay it forward in terms of like to repay a debt. I don't feel
634.68s: like it's a debt at all. But I do feel like somebody has set a really good example in my life on
643.56s: how to treat and think about other people. And I want to promulgate that because I think it's a good
649.88s: message. So you can head over to this. Check that out if you want. And this is the next one is the
656.12s: fun one. How things started. So this is not my very first YouTube video. This video is like from
666.20s: the 22nd of May 2020. And this is like a couple weeks after I started YouTube. And effectively the
675.24s: entire Genesis for starting YouTube. It was during COVID. It was again May of 2020. I know the
681.32s: date really well, because it's the 4th of May. And I was having conversations with my military
689.40s: friends. I very I'm like an evangelist for things that helped me. And one of them is investing.
695.48s: Now most of my military friends, they're not going to be traders. And I know that they most of them
700.36s: they are in a different spot. They have different priorities. But there's still always a really great
705.80s: conversation. And there's always a great way to try and instill some basics. So that's really what
713.64s: I was doing. I was having phone calls with my friends. And I was essentially saying like, hey,
718.76s: where are you guys at with your finances? Because another thing that's different about the
721.80s: military world compared to the civilian world is people are pretty open with one another. It's not
726.52s: this game of like you have to hide or you can't say what your net worth is or how you're doing
731.56s: with your money. Because then they might think like there's none of that. And so I was having
737.32s: conversations with my friends during this time, same where you at. And what are you doing? Because
744.04s: especially during COVID, we saw some really great opportunities for the market. And I'm actually
748.60s: having a lot of those conversations with my friends now, because I think the same. On a long
753.08s: term dollar cost averaging lens. And I found myself repeating myself because I was having calls.
759.48s: I was like directly calling them. Be like, yo, let's talk for a half hour hour or whatever.
763.72s: And I was repeating myself a lot. So then I was just like, I will make a YouTube channel.
768.68s: And I will record some videos about like the basics of budget, emergency savings, those kinds
775.08s: of things. And then they'll watch the video before I talk to them on the phone so that when I
779.88s: talk to them on the phone, it's more efficient. That's exactly the genesis of it. Now there is a
785.88s: really funny story leading into this that I do think is worth mentioning because it's just hilarious.
792.28s: It was probably six months to eight months before that. And before I started YouTube channel,
799.24s: I have had perpetually less than zero interest in social media. I really don't care at all about
805.00s: social media. The only social media that I've ever maintained typically was a Facebook. And
809.72s: that's because when I was on active duty, I would move around a lot. I wasn't near my family.
815.16s: So it was a way for me actually to stay in touch with my family to just keep a pulse and so that
821.24s: they could see some of what I'm doing. Typically what you would get if you live close to your family
825.64s: to see people in person. So that's really the only social media I had. And that's an important
832.68s: background because literally a disdain for social media. Then I'm sitting in my office one day
838.68s: trading just like this sitting right now where I'm at now. And I hear a bunch of things bouncing off
845.24s: my window. It's not raining. And I'm like, what the fuck is this bouncing off my window? I look out,
852.28s: it's like a literal cloud. It's dark. And I was like, what on earth is this? So I walk
861.80s: closer to the window and it is thousands of bees, thousands. And these bees,
872.52s: apparently, thought that they wanted to set up their house. They wanted to go right by one of my
878.84s: little rain gutters that takes off this little mini roof that's outside my office. And they were
884.28s: funneling in there. I didn't know this, but fun fact, we live on top of a hill. We're in a really,
891.08s: really cool spot because we're next to a nature preserve, although we're in San Diego. So we really
895.56s: don't have neighbors on an entire one side of the house. It's just open views. But one of the
900.44s: downsides of being on a hill, which I didn't know, is that when bee colonies split, they kick half
908.92s: the colony out. They bounce and they have to go find a place to live. Well, bees are a simple
915.08s: creature, which I fully identify with. And as these bees are cruising along, they essentially come
922.44s: up, pretend that this is a hill. They come up to elevation. And then they just slowly meander up
928.04s: the elevation. They're looking for elevation. Well, we're on top of a fucking hill elevation.
933.32s: So the other thing I didn't know is bees have a memory on where they've previously
940.76s: established hives. And so I have a relationship with the prior owners of the house. They built the
946.44s: house. And I was just like, yo, you guys have ever any issue with bees and they're like, yeah,
950.60s: every once in a while they go and they knew exactly where they were. And I was just like, ah, okay.
956.12s: Call to beekeeper. Homeboy came out, took care of them, didn't kill them, vacuum them up,
960.76s: tried to move them. And what they do is they put chicken wire in the same spot because they'll
965.24s: still come every once in a while to try to get in there. And it's only that one. That's another
969.88s: really funny thing because outside my office, it's like a flat roof that's foam. They did a lot of
975.64s: like commercial grade stuff for some reason. There's a drain on this side. And then maybe 15 feet,
981.96s: 20 feet, there's a drain on the other side. The other side is not chicken wired or anything. They
986.12s: could easily go into that one. They don't care. They like that one. So I'm just chicken wired off.
991.40s: They can't get in there anymore. So as the dude was leaving, he was the beekeeper was leaving.
997.64s: Never met him before or knew nothing about him. This is before I was on social media at all.
1002.28s: And he says to me, he's just like, are you, are you a YouTuber or something?
1007.72s: And Mel was there. She saw my response. It was like the most incredulous
1013.96s: just I couldn't even believe somebody would say that about me. I got such a kick out of that.
1019.08s: I thought it was the funniest thing this dude could have said. And I was just like,
1023.00s: fuck no, I hate social media. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure as shit.
1027.72s: About a year later, yes, the next less than a year, I don't remember the exact time frame.
1031.40s: I actually might be able to find it. I started the YouTube channel. So one of the running jokes
1036.92s: is that this fucking beekeeper is what started this whole thing like planted that subconscious thought
1042.76s: in my mind because at no point in my entire life, what I otherwise have ever even thought of it
1049.72s: remotely. But this dude somehow just knew what was up. All right, let's see if I can find
1056.92s: these bees. Here they are. All right. So the story is even funnier.
1064.84s: That's classic. You guys won't be able to see, yeah, it's too hard to see. Oh my god.
1073.24s: I'm gonna upload this really quickly. You guys can see this video. It's actually kind of cool.
1077.16s: But that part aside, when would you guess that the bees came to my house? Any guesses?
1089.80s: Right now I'm uploading the the bee video so you guys can see it. It's like literally crazy.
1094.44s: I've I've not seen something like that before. It was super cool though.
1106.68s: All right, stop loaded. Let's grab that bad boy.
1114.20s: All right.
1133.00s: And we'll just put it in download.
1136.92s: This is cool because I actually think you'll be able to hear it. Yep.
1144.68s: So this is literally outside my office window.
1152.52s: And there's really no sound to it. What all these specs you see right now are freaking bees.
1161.00s: And I'll just play it so that I've never seen this before.
1166.76s: That's the spot I was telling you that they like to go.
1169.16s: I don't I've never seen anything like that in my life.
1175.88s: Literally thousands and thousands of them. So that video, I took that on the 20th of April.
1185.80s: So the dude would have came out on the 21st of April. The bees got really calm towards the
1190.52s: towards the evening. So that was the 21st of April that he would have came to the house in 2020.
1198.44s: So then the YouTube channel started just what a couple weeks after that, which is actually even
1205.56s: closer flash to bang than I thought kind of funny. So the beekeeper is the origin.
1214.04s: But yeah, I mean, the beginning stuff that I really created was just answering questions.
1218.84s: It was like answering direct questions. This video that you see here was me just talking about
1223.40s: VXX versus VX. And you can see what this is is I literally am just using my laptop camera,
1231.00s: my laptop mic on a laptop stand because I still had a main screen that I use like I do now.
1238.04s: Whereas a big difference compared to then is I still use a laptop for mobile stuff, but I ended
1244.44s: up getting a desktop as well. But that was the original stuff. You can see like random stuff behind
1250.52s: me on the wall. This is pretty shortly after we ended up moving from our other place into this
1256.60s: place. But that is the beginning. The beginning had everything to do with just making some videos to
1262.84s: try to help a couple of my friends have better conversations than people started leaving comments.
1268.20s: And emailing me different questions. So I was just like, I'll make a video for this who cares. It
1272.60s: literally takes me two seconds. And that's the literally the entire origin of the YouTube channel.
1278.92s: Then I take a look at comparatively where we are today. And it's kind of crazy, right?
1285.48s: Like you think it used to be just answering a couple of questions here and there. Now we literally
1291.48s: have pretty much a stream every single day. There's a podcast part of this. There's a newsletter now.
1297.08s: There's at least one week one video up to three videos a week. And we have this really cool
1301.80s: community. Like all this started out of that. And it continues to grow. But one of the main things
1308.28s: that I remain committed to and I continually remind myself is I really like progress. And if I'm
1314.52s: going to spend time doing something I want to get better. But with something like social media,
1319.40s: it's an interesting challenge for me. And the reason why that it's so challenging is because
1328.04s: the things that absolutely do well are things that I personally take issue with. I think it's
1334.84s: a disingenuous. I think that it leads people literally to failure. Those kinds of things.
1340.84s: So it puts me in a weird spot where the things that I know would work way better to continue growing
1346.60s: are things I'm actively not willing to do. And then I kind of reconciled with myself. I was just like,
1352.60s: literally just focus on continuing to get better at the craft within the bounds that I think are
1358.60s: reasonable with within things that I'm comfortable with. And that's effectively what it's been. So I
1367.80s: really think a lot about the end user of the videos and the kind of people that are likely to
1373.16s: come across things. I'm very, very thoughtful with how they're going to perceive things. And I remember
1380.84s: when I was early on in my career and how indebted I was to like any healthy interaction I can find.
1391.24s: So now we take a look at a couple of fun stories. So there's two stories that I wanted to talk to you
1405.40s: about. The first one on the left hand side, you can see this nice pie graph. They have 66.7%
1414.12s: on the right and then 33.3% on the left. This pie graph represents something specific. But
1423.56s: if you think about the beginning stages of trading, you all are fairly familiar with the
1431.80s: Dunning Kruger effect. I've talked about it before a lot because I think it's very important.
1436.84s: The Dunning Kruger effect very often happens very early on in your trading career.
1443.40s: For me, it happened in a slightly prolonged time frame. And a big part of that is it just took me
1453.08s: longer to figure this stuff out. When I first started trading in 2007,
1457.80s: I like the resources available are nothing like what it is now at all. It's completely different.
1465.24s: So a lot of it is this haphazard learning based on the stuff you can come across.
1470.76s: So what this graph represents is actually the drawdown on my portfolio from a single very high
1481.32s: probability trade that temporarily went against me. This literally was a several day trade where
1490.36s: I eviscerated a third of the portfolio. And here's essentially what happened.
1498.36s: I was trading really wide iron condors in the rut, though the Russell index itself.
1506.92s: And it was a relatively quiet week. The market didn't have a whole lot going on.
1513.32s: And I put on this sizeable relative to the account at the time. It was wide, the wings on the iron
1523.08s: condor. And it was a really low delta for the shorts. And the reason I put this trade on,
1531.48s: I remember it pretty clearly because this part's imprinted. It was like 500 and something dollars
1538.68s: is what I was set to make. And I think I sold it. I don't remember the exact timing. This is a while
1544.52s: ago. This happened maybe four or five years into my trading career. I could tell you exactly
1551.00s: when it happened. When was it? Yeah, here. One, two, three, four, five years in.
1562.04s: Five years into the trading career. And at this point, I'd been spending an insane amount of time.
1572.28s: Because this is like post high school college. And if you went to college,
1577.80s: even though I was doing ROTC and stuff, like there's a lot of time in college for extra activities.
1584.04s: And I was really efficient at school. I've been obsessed with efficiency my entire life. So
1589.96s: this was what I was spending the absolute bulk of my time on. Even more than I was spending in
1595.96s: classes and stuff for sure, I would go to my classes. But I mean, like the total composite time on,
1600.76s: like the time you spent for classes versus the time spent on trading is way more. And I put on this
1608.76s: really wide iron condor. It's a pretty short term trade, like a week, definitely less than two
1613.56s: weeks. I don't think it was more than that. And I put this trade on and I was so focused on this
1619.56s: idea of like, man, if I could make $500 a week doing this, how incredible would that be?
1631.00s: How big of a difference would that make? And for me with where I was at that point in time,
1637.16s: tremendous, literally massive difference in my life that would have made.
1643.72s: Didn't spend a lot of time thinking about what the trade could look like over the lifespan.
1651.08s: I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about what I might do throughout the life cycle of the trade.
1657.72s: I was so focused on this $500 that I was going to make. And I was sitting there saying it was
1665.48s: like a 90% probability. It was like super high probability of being out of the money. Like I said,
1670.20s: the shorts were super low delta, like maybe a 10 delta or something. And I just remember it was
1677.32s: a couple days into the trade. And I was going to the gym in the morning. And I was linking up with
1684.52s: my buddy that I played rugby with. And as before I went into the gym, took a look at the phone to see
1691.56s: how the position was doing. And I saw that it was down big. It was down like $15,000, $20,000.
1699.16s: And I remember just sitting there looking at the position, thinking, that's not good.
1704.84s: And I had that moment of I should do something, but I was completely frozen. I didn't want to
1712.28s: realize that loss. I didn't want to do anything because then the trade's done. So I sat there for
1721.16s: a moment and I thought about, well, how much could I lose? Because the trade still had some time
1725.08s: left. So we were maybe I don't remember what path to max loss it was. And I remember saying,
1735.64s: I'll look at it when I get in the gym and I'll just think about what I should do here.
1742.28s: So I go in, I sit on the bench as we're changing and I look at it again. And it was down more.
1747.72s: At this point, it was, I don't I don't know if it was quite double that, but it like at one point,
1756.44s: it was over a $50,000 loss. So then I was like, that's at this point again, remember, I'm in my,
1766.36s: this would have been like post undergrad starting of my grad while I was waiting to go to
1775.56s: TBS for the Marine Corps because I started my masters then. So at this point in my life, it's
1781.72s: it's a serious amount of money. That's a lot of money at that point. And I remember sitting there
1787.24s: thinking, well, I'll have to do something. And I committed to myself that I was going to make a
1794.92s: decision before I did my workout. And I ended up waiting a little bit trying to understand the
1801.48s: market, trying to understand the move coming up with what I thought may or may not make sense.
1805.80s: And I ultimately arrived at the conclusion of this was such a poorly thought out idea that I
1816.12s: just close it. Just close it. It could be a max loss. The max loss is much bigger than what I
1822.12s: ultimately ended up taking it down at. And just take the loss. It's a lot of money. I've made
1829.96s: money up into that point. So I know how to trade at least a little bit. This was a really
1837.24s: eye opening experience. So I close the trade. I realize the loss. And then I go workout with my
1842.04s: buddy. During the workout, I wasn't really in like shell shock or anything. I was just like doing
1849.16s: the workout. And after the workout, I remember thinking to myself, you have got to make some big
1857.56s: fucking changes. Otherwise, this is not going to work. I distinctly remember having that
1863.72s: conversation with myself in the locker room. And that conversation persisted into the evening,
1870.28s: the next day. And I made a commitment to myself at that point that I was going full pause,
1875.72s: pause everything. All the other strategies that I had on I had other trades on that were doing
1881.56s: took all of them down. And I just full pause. And I said to myself, what happened here? And
1892.52s: what could I do differently? And as I'm doing that, I'm still because the trade itself otherwise
1898.92s: would have still been on and passed forward. Fun fact, the trade would have been a full profit.
1903.80s: I would have made the 500 bucks. It landed like almost smack dab in the middle of the short strikes.
1909.24s: It was, it was just epic. And that resolution mattered a lot to me. The fact that it would have
1916.92s: been, it would have been fine. Because I was also thinking, man, like, what kind of terrible habits
1921.16s: would that have spawned? But I started thinking about what I needed to do and doing a post mortem on
1930.36s: what happened. And what I came across in the path of what happened was what I refer to now
1940.20s: as Goldilocks analysis. I didn't call it that then. I didn't even really understand what that
1945.24s: concept was. But something like that struck me. And what that means is I was so focused on that
1957.00s: $500. What that $500 could have done for me at that point, what it meant to me. The fact that
1964.36s: it was a high probability trade, all of these things. And I realized that I completely,
1971.72s: completely, or went thinking about what the trade might look like over the life cycle and how I
1978.68s: might behave. So as I tell you this story, I'm sure you can think about what I would tell myself
1986.44s: then because they're the things that I tell you. And it's because it's the things that after a lot
1992.92s: of reflection that one experience literally changed everything. I started thinking about
2000.92s: frameworks, how to think about, like, actually trading at a serious level. And I'd come across a mentor
2012.28s: that I indirectly interacted with in the trading space online. And he mentioned this idea of
2019.00s: having a trading plan. And I was sitting there thinking like, yeah, I don't have a trading plan.
2023.56s: But it seems like a lot of work. I don't really want to do that. And I had heard that before this loss.
2031.24s: And after the loss, I was sitting there thinking, I'll need to have a plan.
2036.68s: So I started applying a lot of what I actually learned in the military from a planning process.
2044.60s: And because that's one of the things that you primarily do as a marine officer is plan.
2050.28s: So I start thinking about how to build a plan. And it's literally that this is like the straight-up
2057.32s: advice I give you guys. Open up a word doc and just start putting words down. And for me, I'm
2064.12s: fortunate in that sense where I really didn't get caught up in like, oh, I don't know what to put.
2068.20s: I don't know if this makes sense. I literally just started scribbling down all my ideas.
2073.00s: And I start looking at the ideas and I can start seeing a lot of just half-baked things that
2078.52s: there's subconscious stuff going on that's not really tracked well. And I'm just looking at
2085.56s: what this looked like. And I was just saying like, man, I thought this was going to work. And then
2092.76s: I'm looking at my ideas on paper and I'm realizing that they're complete shit. And that whole experience,
2099.56s: again, you have to remember, I had been trading for like five years at that point. I've spent hundreds
2106.04s: of hours learning about trading, practicing, testing, all this kind of stuff. So that was such a massive
2113.40s: blow to what I thought I had learned. So this loss taught me a couple really important things.
2123.56s: The first thing that it taught me is how important it is to spend time thinking through things
2132.52s: objectively and less so from the lens that's most appealing to us. And the reason why that's
2140.04s: a specific callout is because it's something you have to actively guard against. Because your brain
2144.84s: naturally doesn't want to do that. It doesn't want to deal with the ugly scenarios that are likely
2150.36s: to occur at some point. The other thing that this thing has taught me is my visceral reaction is
2158.44s: a human being to seeing numbers on the screen and what those numbers meant. It taught me the importance
2165.48s: of a healthy detachment from my trading capital. This is another commonality that is born that you've
2174.92s: regularly heard me talk about, which is needing to be even keeled. Meaning I don't allow myself to get
2181.72s: excited after winning trades. And then I don't allow myself to despair after losing trades. I focus
2187.24s: on something entirely different. And by doing that, I give myself a much better chance to interface
2195.48s: with one of the most challenging things literally in the world, the stock market. And if you don't
2200.28s: believe that, think about any absolutely any shred of people that have tried trading, even that
2209.32s: have great jobs, the number of doctors, lawyers, those kinds of people that try trading that have very
2215.80s: high paying jobs. And it's because there's a lot of benefits of trading, one of which is it literally
2221.08s: is you eat what you kill, but there's no stakeholders at all up down sideways. It is all you.
2226.76s: And most people fail. We know the statistics on it, the overwhelming majority of people will fail
2233.08s: as traders. And that's what I thought at that time. I thought that I was having this like failure
2237.48s: moment. But then I started realizing like all these things that I learned, how much time I had left,
2242.44s: at this time, I was working my ass off in all sorts of things, meaning I was doing a lot of
2250.20s: some things that don't belong on stream. It's nothing like with drugs or anything like that.
2257.32s: I'd never got into that stuff because of the military, but it had to do with like cars
2261.72s: and the way you drive cars and maybe like wagering on the outcome of your car versus somebody else's
2267.96s: car, those kinds of things. And I was flipping motorcycles. I was doing everything I could to make
2274.68s: money buying cars, fixing them, selling them. And I was like, I can make the money back.
2281.16s: And I was sitting there thinking how much the college was costing. And the Marine Corps paid for
2290.04s: that. Otherwise, there was no chance I was going to go to college. I was actually originally going to
2293.64s: end list. So I was like, I'll be all right. And then that's when I decided to go full stop. And
2301.24s: then that's when I decided to get deeply invested in paper trading and trying to figure out this
2306.36s: process-based approach. So this loss effectively shaped everything about my approach going forward
2316.36s: from my expectation of internal analysis to my methodologies with respect to process, which
2324.36s: have evolved a lot, by the way. But it introduced me the importance of these things.
2330.20s: It taught me a lot about the human psychology of things. So this one trade was one of my biggest
2339.88s: teachers that I ever could have had. And some people are like, oh, wow, you only drew down a third
2346.52s: of the account. You didn't blow an account. That's incredible. Well, the fact is, at this point,
2352.28s: I've been trading for a little while, experiencing some luck while saving. The amount that I lost on
2358.28s: this is effectively the amalgamation of five to six to 10, depending on what the small account is
2365.72s: that would have been blown. So the only reason why the account didn't blow is because at this point,
2371.88s: I at least had a little bit of pocket change. The other thing is one of the main reasons why I
2378.12s: started trading is to put myself in a position to be able to help my mom when she needed it.
2383.16s: So I wasn't approaching this trading thing with the idea of like, oh, I'm going to yolo or I'm
2387.80s: going to try to 1,000X my returns, right? Go back to the trade that led to this loss. It was a
2393.64s: defined risk trade with really high probability. That's not somebody going out there to yolo.
2398.92s: That's me trying to do something conservative to earn the money for those other reasons.
2404.68s: So it taught me literally to revamp all of that. So that's my first story for you about my
2414.12s: most impactful loss by far and something that I use as one of my better teachers that I've been
2422.92s: fortunate to have and kind of still escape on the other side. So if there's anything about that
2433.00s: story that you're interested in or if there's any questions on it, let me know.
2437.32s: If not, we will mosey onto our second story. And the purpose of the second story is to provide a
2447.56s: little bit of balance, but also to provide a little bit of scope and scale.
2454.84s: So I have some apples. These are so good. It's literally ridiculous.
2467.56s: All right. Onto number two.
2472.76s: Any guess what this is?
2486.36s: You can see the X axis.
2498.20s: This shows you my returns for the past three years compared to the S&P 500.
2511.88s: My last two years have been Joey's got it right on the ball. It's me versus the S&P 500.
2520.12s: And my last two years have been my best trading years ever.
2528.04s: So there's a couple things I highlight from this.
2540.28s: These last two years are literally the two years where I've lowered my return target the most.
2551.80s: I used to target at least 15% per year. And then I lowered it to 12, then to 10, then to 8.
2560.04s: I didn't lower it because I couldn't hit it. I lowered it because I was at the amount of money I needed
2567.88s: in order for the account to do what I wanted. But then these last two years,
2581.88s: I effectively just needed to pace inflation. I think I set like a 5% or a 6% return target.
2589.64s: And yet these years ended up being some of, well not even some of literally the two best years
2594.36s: I've ever had. What did that teach me? It taught me something really important about the idea
2603.00s: of pursuing good opportunities. Now I want to be very clear. My return in both of these years
2611.16s: included a healthy dose of luck. The market was very accommodating to me and what I was doing.
2617.16s: And I happened to overlay well with those. It's kind of like if somebody is an athlete and they
2624.12s: have like a good game, they're just in the zone. It's not necessarily representative of what they
2628.28s: always do. But once in a while you like really show up. That's kind of what this was for me.
2633.96s: The fun thing about the return in 2023 is that's actually a discounted return.
2639.40s: The return is quite a bit larger than this actually.
2647.16s: But I took that part of my return out because of how anomalous these couple trades were
2657.00s: over just a couple days. And I told you guys a little bit about them. I'm not at a point where
2663.88s: I'm ready to talk about them at all because it's stuff that I am still looking for.
2669.00s: But in 2023, I had come across something that I had been looking for passively for a very long time.
2677.56s: And as soon as I saw it, I understood what I saw. And I immediately put on what I knew to make sense.
2686.68s: And it was hands down the largest two day gain of my life. And then some, I mean, it was bigger
2693.80s: than multiple years. So that event was really interesting. That specific event taught me
2703.64s: that even though markets are really, really competitive, really competitive, that there can still be
2715.08s: opportunities that seem unrealistic, that seem like you would think they never would exist.
2721.72s: They do pop up periodically. The other thing that these two years specifically have taught me
2728.04s: is how valuable it is to be able to pivot as a trader and to capitalize on opportunities as you
2735.48s: see it. Funny enough, Joey is highlighting one of the trades that was a one of my better trend
2743.40s: following trades in APP. APP was a literal insane trade. That's a little too far, I think.
2755.40s: I think I got rid of the drawings and stuff. I'd have to look at the actual
2760.04s: dates. I want to say that I started getting in on this breakout. I don't remember where the breakout
2764.44s: was. It might be this one. The reason why I don't know is because the scale is completely off now
2768.76s: because of this move. But I had done a really good job of following this breakout essentially
2776.60s: through this entire path. I remember I scaled out a little bit somewhere in here and then I scaled
2780.92s: back in on this one and I think this one. This trade was an absolute insane return. It was really
2791.56s: based on momentum following. I just use options to capitalize on it. That one was a really,
2798.60s: really solid trade. The other thing that this grouping of years highlights to me that I want to
2805.16s: share with you. It's a really powerful lesson that a lot of people I believe don't pay enough
2812.20s: attention to, which is this. Most of my trading career is based on Portfolio 1. Portfolio 1
2825.64s: shows you something important. If we take a look at Portfolio 1, it shows you the different
2830.84s: years of returns year, year 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. You can see the best return was 10. The worst was 2.
2837.48s: If you compare that to Portfolio 3, the best return was 30%. The worst was negative 25,
2843.72s: but then the next three returns are 12, 14, 12. What do you notice? Well, this has a insanely good
2850.52s: average return of 8.6% as compared to 7.4%. Way better return. However, what do you notice about
2859.24s: the ending value in the compound annual growth rate? The ending value is greater than this
2867.56s: other approach that has a 1.2% higher average return and the compound annual growth rate is 7.35
2875.80s: compared to 6.87. What this is designed to show you is that there are different ways to beat the
2883.96s: market. One of the ways that you can beat the market as a retail trader is not by always outperforming
2891.40s: it to the upside. Literally, the best year from Portfolio 1 doesn't beat anything other than
2900.52s: the worst year in Portfolio 3, meaning all four other returns are better than the best year
2906.20s: from Portfolio 1. The difference is this 25% drawdown versus this 10% year.
2915.80s: That is something I think that is grossly under-disgust and under-appreciated because one of
2924.12s: the easiest ways for you to win as a trader in terms of outperforming the market is not by outperforming
2931.64s: the market to the upside every single year. It's when the market has these big down years.
2939.16s: And if this is admittedly a really good return, comparative to this, not using this as the benchmark,
2945.32s: but if the market drops 19% and you're positive 5%, that is a massive gap that you now have
2954.20s: over the stock market. And it's something to keep in the back of your mind, something that's
2958.44s: really, really important because you do not always need to outperform the market in order to outperform
2963.08s: the market. This also finally, to me, represents the maturation of a skill set. The fact that 22
2973.56s: shows you the ability to generate a positive return during a down year. The fact that there's
2978.60s: two really, really solid years here. Now, to bring this all back to earth, my compound annual growth
2986.28s: rate still, it used to be in the mid-20s. But now with the last two years factored in,
2996.20s: it's 31.6%, which is a crazy compound annual growth rate. And the main reason why it's that high
3004.60s: is not because each year was this crack off of a year, although these two were, but it's because
3012.20s: I've only lost money two years. It's my first two years of trading. In both of them, we're less than
3018.28s: 5%. I've had several years where I've underperformed the market to the upside. But I've almost always,
3026.36s: no, after those first two years, I think I've always outperformed the market on down years.
3031.24s: Because there weren't many. That's why I know. 2008, the market was down 37%. I was down 4.2%.
3038.44s: 2018, the market was down 4.4%. I was up 13.8%. 22, market was down 19.4. I was up 21.2.
3050.04s: So, yeah. That's a really powerful thing to keep in the back of your mind because it leads to
3057.32s: this other thing that, again, most people will go paying attention to. Let's say we start with a
3063.48s: $25,000 account. You're a good saver. So you're saving $1500 a month on average. Let's say we look
3070.20s: over this 20 year timeframe. And let's use a 15% variance. What do you notice the difference?
3078.68s: Here's what happens. If with this profile, you return 10% per year, you walk out with a really
3089.80s: solid return of $1.2 million. If you outperformed that by average, taking it from a 10% return to a
3098.92s: 25% return over this 20 year timeframe, you now have $6.7 million. The consistency in your
3111.48s: returns can be one of the largest generators of your future wealth. Far none. Something to pay
3118.92s: attention to. All right. Those are the two stories I have for you. I'm going to move forward
3124.84s: into the three lessons. If you have any questions on the stories, now's a great time to throw those
3131.16s: in or any other questions about the broader trading career or the YouTube stuff if you'd like.
3137.24s: Happy to talk about any of that stuff now. I got to pop the door for Thor because it's time for his dinner.
3155.56s: I did question other Apple pieces.
3168.12s: Think I'm out now, though.
3171.64s: Reese says, did you ever dabble with investing or trader always? I started as a trader.
3178.36s: I'm sorry, as an investor, but I invested for a few months before I pivoted to trading effectively.
3187.72s: So what happened was the way I first started in markets was after that teacher introduced me to
3196.92s: the idea of investing. I went up to the library at school. I remember this because in ROTC,
3201.96s: that's the dude. He's a ROTC instructor. He introduced me to the idea of investing.
3207.64s: Library was right above where the ROTC part of the school was. So I just walked up and I started
3214.68s: just combing through stuff. And one of the things that he mentioned to me is, you know, a good starting
3220.92s: point is to buy what you know. So at this point, I remembered things like Netflix were really,
3228.12s: really exciting. The iPods were so cool. That was a really big thing. So I started buying little
3237.00s: tiny pieces of these different companies. And over the next few months, they actually started
3241.48s: making a ton of money in terms of a percent return in terms of a gross dollar return. The positions
3247.00s: were so small, it didn't matter. I didn't have much money. So I saw that momentum and I was thinking
3254.60s: like, damn, if this is me just not doing anything else, then maybe if I got better at trading,
3262.36s: I can make more money faster. And that's effectively when I made the jump into trading was pretty much
3269.80s: a few months into when I first opened up my account and started buying those first few names.
3276.04s: So that's pretty much the only time I've ever been a quote-unquote investor in the stock market.
3281.40s: Now outside the stock market, I am a really heavy investor. I am still super active as an angel
3287.88s: investor. And I'm super active in real estate. Again, more so the commercial side now used to be
3295.40s: residential. And then I've kind of scaled a little bit and I've moved dominantly into commercial
3301.72s: real estate. I mean, when I look at the way that I've built money over my whole life,
3310.84s: I've never been one of those people that picked one thing and just did one thing.
3317.24s: I've always been what we would refer to as not, but I don't know if this will connect with you
3323.32s: guys if you'll understand what I mean or not, but I've always been a hustler. And that's not
3327.00s: hustling in the context of like trying to take advantage of people. It's hustling in terms of
3331.64s: doing a lot of different things to try to make money. So first, it was always about trying to
3339.32s: generate greater, gross returns. So income. And then I started getting into different kinds of
3345.88s: investments. Once I had a little bit of money, I helped a buddy open up a media business DJing
3352.60s: in Dubai. That was like one of my first angel investments. And that was a whole other experience.
3360.20s: Went great in the beginning and then it went terrible. It ultimately reconciled, but that was
3366.60s: a massive learning experience. And then I've stayed in angel investing more so because I think
3371.56s: it's super, super interesting. It's not necessarily because it's the greatest returns on planet
3376.20s: earth. It really isn't in the liquidity. Obviously, it's awful, but there are decent returns,
3381.48s: but it's not I would like if I had to pick one, I would pick trading for sure over angel, I just
3386.52s: like it a lot. And then real estate, it's a great fit for the broader portfolio. It's just like the way
3394.60s: I talked to you about trading where I always start at the portfolio level, then kind of click in
3399.16s: and click in and try to build something based on this broader context of what my total portfolio
3404.20s: looks like and what I think I need at the time, like those kinds of things. It's the same thing with
3408.60s: my financial footprint. The thing that I try to remind people that is I also think broadly
3416.92s: underappreciated is people think like, oh my god, trading is so risky. It's crazy to do that,
3426.60s: but here's what I think about as a trader, you're on your phone clicking buttons, but here is
3438.68s: one income stream. Then maybe as you're a trader, you also get in your car and you door dash.
3448.12s: If you're a smaller trader, there's your second income. And then maybe you spend a little time
3453.56s: figuring out how to fix things in between your door dashing and you proxy for jobs
3461.48s: as a handyman. There's your third income and so on and so forth. Then as your pile of money,
3468.28s: this is active income. Then as your pile of money grows, these are stacks of money on a platter,
3476.28s: in case you were wondering, bags of money. What you do is you continue reinvesting some of this
3483.72s: into the trading side of the business and then you break off a piece of it and then you start
3488.92s: putting it into other assets that now allow you to generate other investment income. So you have
3496.44s: your direct income. Then you have your investment income, multiple sources from both of them.
3503.48s: This is a highly robust individual. This is the kind of person where if there's a big market
3510.52s: downturn or if your entire industry or job, you become automated out of a job or technology moves
3517.24s: away from whatever your industry is, you're not fucked. You might not be happy, your dominant income
3523.16s: might still suffer massively, but you're not destitute. One of the biggest issues that I see
3529.56s: with regular people is they work a W2 and then they might have a 401k which doesn't really matter
3537.64s: in the near term as far as income and they might have a buy and hold portfolio which also doesn't
3542.84s: really help us in terms of income in the short term. This lacks all robustness. As soon as this W2
3551.00s: is cut, this person is in a massively compromised situation. Either they need to find another job
3559.56s: which is okay. A lot of people can accurately do that, but when you do that, you have to play
3565.48s: the game. You literally have to essentially say, I need this W2 income so bad that I'm going to do
3574.36s: whatever it takes and that comes with costs. It comes with costs on your time, your effort,
3581.32s: where you're directing your energy. It comes out of cost of your morals, things that you agree
3587.32s: with doing, things that you don't agree with doing, but you do it for the sake of the job because
3591.16s: you really need the job. It puts you in a total compromised situation regardless of all of the other
3597.16s: factors. This is exactly the way that I thought about building money. The world of investing is
3606.36s: still very important to me, but just not in the stock market because I trade in the stock market,
3611.80s: but I absolutely invest in other things and it's to build that broader robustness.
3618.04s: Ben says, why did you choose this path instead of some of the other profitable traders who make
3622.36s: higher returns? I've talked about this actually quite a lot. The main thing is when I first started
3628.52s: trading, I valued consistency a lot and it's because I didn't know how good I was going to be or
3636.92s: how viable this thing was going to be, but I thought being able to honestly outperform the market
3642.84s: on most years would effectively serve my need and my need ultimately was to be in a position
3649.32s: to take care of my mom. My mom was an occupational therapist for a public school district for
3654.84s: mentally handicapped kids. She got paid nothing and she was a contractor. So she had no retirement
3661.24s: with them and she's single. She's by herself. She's not good with money. So what does that mean?
3667.88s: Well, it means as a young man, I can kind of see the writing on the wall that there's going to be
3672.44s: a fucking problem at some point because she can't do that job forever. It's very physical.
3676.92s: So that's exactly why I started with that as a target. And then when I started realizing how much
3682.60s: money you can make as long as you maintain that return profile, it's like it comes to the question
3689.64s: of like literally how many gold coupons do you need, meaning money in kind of a condescending way?
3695.72s: Because again, let's just take a look at a couple scenarios.
3701.48s: If we have this $25,000 account, let's say that you're better at saving. You have multiple jobs.
3708.28s: You have $2,500 a month. You have a 20 year timeframe. And let's say again, you earn this modest return
3714.84s: excess over the stock market of 15%. Where does that put you in 20 years? Well, in 20 years,
3720.84s: you'd be at $1.8 million outright in 20 years with this other return profile. You're at $3.5 million.
3727.64s: That to me, this profile to me seemed very achievable. And that still put me in a position to have
3737.16s: plenty of money. Now, it's been fortunate where again, my compound annual growth rate is
3744.68s: effectively double that. So the returns become really, really healthy. But what I cared about most
3753.96s: was hitting that base case of making sure that I was in a spot. One, to buy back my own autonomy,
3762.20s: meaning my ability, I like working. And I still consult with an industry like I like working.
3769.96s: It's good for me. However, I like having choice and autonomy. That means that if I'm given a task
3780.92s: that I don't agree with, I'm able to say, no, I'm not going to do that. Or I'm able to advocate
3787.88s: for what I think is better without the concern of, oh, what happens to me if I do this? That's
3795.00s: kind of really important to me to have that self-autonomy. Ben says, I just want to at this point,
3802.76s: you have the skills and mindset to most likely do what they do. Maybe it's just you like where you are.
3807.40s: I guess the, what do you mean? I don't know what the comparison is here because again, like,
3813.16s: I would look at the returns on the last two years. And I mean, that's a demonstration of capability.
3820.04s: But like, I'm not capable of unlimited returns. There's a reality based on what I'm able to
3825.56s: achieve based on my skillset and based on what I can do. So I guess I'm not sure like what the
3831.48s: reference benchmark is when you refer to like other traders, quote unquote. But what I can tell
3837.40s: you again is if you look at some of the best returns of traders, let's just take a look.
3846.60s: What are the best 25 year agger traders in the world?
3853.56s: Let's see. I'm actually going to ask that to chat GPT because the Google search.
3871.96s: Let's see what this says.
3872.92s: Because my guess is soros will be up there. Buffett will be up there. Yeah.
3884.28s: Obviously Jim Simon's drunk Miller. So, drunken Miller. So Jim Simon's returned 39%. Stan,
3894.44s: drunken Miller 30%. George soros 30%. Warren Buffett 19.8%. Lynch 29%.
3905.32s: David Tepper 30%. Paul Tutor Jones 20%. Ken Griffin 19%. Dallio 14%. The point that I'm making is
3916.76s: like the fact that I'm even returning anything even close to what those kinds of people are is
3923.16s: literally a miracle. And it's because the game's easier for me. Absolutely. When you're an institution
3928.92s: at that size, there's skills far outweigh mine. They're literally just laden down with their
3936.28s: the rules they have to follow. So yeah, I'm not sure like the quote unquote path of other profitable
3942.68s: traders and what it looks like. But I've been in this game long enough to know what's realistic
3947.24s: over a long term timeframe. So if the suggestion is like that there's long term traders that are
3952.12s: returning 75% compound annual growth rates over 25 years literally call utter bullshit on it.
3958.84s: It's overwhelmingly not the case. So yeah, the thing that I've really valued is consistency.
3967.72s: I think consistency really grants those core things that matter a lot to me, which is first
3976.12s: freedom combined with being able to take care of my mom. But then after that's accomplished,
3982.92s: kind of just continuing to pad things because as I continue to build more wealth, the reason why I'm
3989.40s: focused on that is because it opens up more opportunities to do other things. So that's the
3997.00s: that's the way I look at it. But I mean, even at this point now, we have way more than we need for
4002.36s: sure. And I enjoy a lot the the world of trading. I am like, I'm essentially obsessed with
4014.60s: markets. Markets are something that I I cannot express like how deeply I enjoy it. It's such a
4021.80s: fascinating exercise, everything from mastery of yourself, ability to synthesize information,
4029.32s: how good your systems are. I told you earlier in the stream that I'm obsessed with efficiency,
4034.04s: how efficient you are gets tested here. And then your ability to self regulate, self identify,
4040.44s: there's so much to do and it's incredibly fun. So yeah, that's kind of where I'm at why I do
4047.16s: things now. But with respect to, you know, the other traders thing, I honestly don't know who the
4052.36s: other benchmarks you're using are. But I already know that based on what I can do that I'm probably
4059.72s: pretty close to like what the terminal rate is because to be clear, I don't think I'm actually
4065.40s: long term capable of a 31% compound annual growth rate. Like I fully expect that to guide down.
4071.96s: And it's because I don't think I'm as good as people like Dr. Kim Miller or Simon's like,
4081.08s: there's just a reality like those are really smart dudes that have built an empire around their
4088.36s: skill set. So I kind of, I guess it's a function of also like understanding the world as it is.
4099.08s: All right, onto the next thing, three lessons that effectively changed everything for me.
4106.52s: The first one is the hardest hands down. The first one is that annoying advice you hear people say
4114.20s: such as, don't worry about the money and it will come. Whenever I heard that early on, I was always like,
4124.44s: bitch, I am worried about the money. I want the money. I'm so worried about the money. And then
4131.48s: as I start to understand what that means, it's why I report the same message to you now.
4141.88s: The world of trading is entirely about how robust, how effective your process is, how well can you
4150.92s: ingest information, how well can you adapt and how well can you employ your skill set?
4157.24s: If you become over focused on the output of an individual trade at any point in time,
4164.52s: it is to your own detriment. No one trade matters provided that you have decent risk control measures.
4171.96s: If you have 100% drawdown on a trade, then that trade mattered a lot, but it means you failed in
4176.68s: other places. I mean, more so within the bounds of normal return profiles.
4183.16s: The reason why process so matter so much is because you literally have to learn to reward yourself
4191.96s: for following the process effectively and you have to reward yourself for emphasizing the process
4200.12s: over seeing what the P&L is from an individual trade because ultimately, the process is what
4207.08s: feeds your long-term performance. It's not anyone individual trade. As I look back over my
4213.96s: trading career, it's literally thousands and thousands of trades. No one of them matter.
4219.72s: It's everything about how all of them come together in the long run. So,
4226.28s: this one is really difficult to accept and I imagine most people won't be able to accept it because
4233.24s: I wasn't, but what I can tell you is that if you do focus on the process, you will have a
4242.60s: much, much, much better chance to actually make the money that you're trying to make.
4249.56s: So, food for thought. Next one, moderated ego. The reason why I mentioned this is because a lot
4256.20s: of people will say, like, oh, ego is bad. You shouldn't have an ego. That's complete bullshit.
4260.84s: You need an ego. In ego is what festers in your mind and you uncomfortable laying there in bed
4269.64s: because you're like, shit, like I could have done a little bit more today. I could have done
4272.76s: something else today to move this thing forward. Like, ego does translate to drive and trying to
4280.44s: accomplish different kinds of goals. So, I don't approach this comment from the concept of ego is
4285.40s: bad. It's not, but it does need to be moderated because I do believe very frequently the ego can
4290.76s: get out of control easily. And you can start, and this, by the way, this isn't something that's
4295.48s: like relegated to men. That's another thing that's like complete bullshit where it's like men
4299.96s: have big egos and women never do. It's not even about the external manifestation of the ego. I'm
4305.88s: talking more so the internal manifestation of the ego in different ways. And people can experience
4312.04s: negative e-mo, negative ego in a few key internal ways, which I'll explain quickly. One of them
4322.76s: is if you are uncomfortable with placing a trade, let's say, let's say you're timid.
4328.76s: You're uncomfortable placing a trade. And it's easier for you to avoid the discomfort of placing
4335.24s: a trade by simply not placing a trade. That's an internal expression of ego that literally
4341.08s: is led to a negative outcome if it's otherwise a trade that you should have placed based on your
4346.84s: plan. It's the same thing where if you, in the analysis of your trades, you just kind of like,
4354.52s: oh, I lost this one because of this reason. You kind of like mentally discount it. Oh, I lost
4359.16s: this one for this reason that was really unique in this one circumstance. So that obviously wouldn't
4363.56s: happen again. That's also the ego not wanting to confront the reality of the performance.
4369.40s: So ego is not bad. Ego is good if it's controlled. So it's something to consider and it's kind of
4378.12s: anti what a lot of people say is like, oh, you can't have an ego trade like a robot. That's all
4382.68s: bullshit. Doesn't mean anything. All right. Last one. I think differently. This is why we are
4389.16s: the outlier community. It's why I'm obsessed with outlier performance. It's because in order to
4397.64s: be successful in this, you have to do things differently than the majority of people.
4402.92s: Those kinds of statements can be a little frustrating sometimes because
4407.88s: people always do this thing of like, everybody else is so dumb and I'm so smart. Those kinds of
4413.96s: little games, which is kind of annoying. But I'll show you what I mean. If we go here,
4427.64s: you'll see that the majority of people don't do well in this. So you, if so, facto have to do
4436.04s: things differently than them. So when we think about how to think differently from a starting point,
4441.80s: it's actually really simple. We should literally just think about it from well, how do other people
4447.08s: do this? That's a great starting point. And then you can pivot off of that. Like for example,
4454.76s: a lot of traders think from the point of convenience, what works for me? What do I prefer to do?
4462.76s: That doesn't work well. And so on and so forth. So you have to challenge the way that you frame
4466.92s: things with yourself because if you do things like everybody else, you're going to have the same
4471.08s: results as everybody else, which unfortunately is quite poor in trading, decent for investing,
4476.76s: but quite poor in trading. All right. It is now time for our giveaway.
4484.76s: So what I'm going to do is quickly go to that link.
4492.28s: And then I'm going to count the number of comments. And then I'm literally just going to tell
4498.76s: chat you PT to pick a number. So it looks like there's 37. I'm going to call a bunch of them
4504.76s: are going to be me. So let me, there's not that many. So let me scroll through this one.
4507.80s: Two.
4512.36s: Nine.
4520.52s: 19. So you have a one in 19 chance of winning pretty good. All right.
4526.28s: Chat you be to pick a number between one and 19. That's random.
4541.56s: The number is 17. So that that looks like our boy, wheel, strat, Joe, who would have picked that?
4552.84s: Congratulations to send your wheel, strat, Joe. If you shoot me an email, we'll find a time to talk a
4563.40s: little bit about the stuff that you're doing on the portfolio. And to hopefully see if we can find
4570.52s: a way to help out, you're an interesting case too. Honestly, exactly have talked to you for a while
4576.76s: now in the discord. So I'm pretty excited from that lens because we'll have a pretty good starting
4583.24s: point to work off of. So hopefully we'll be able to help out a little bit. I think so.
4590.36s: All right. First off, last off, I guess I should say now, I am so stoked. Like I'm, it gives me so
4601.80s: much purpose to have our community of people that are interested in this from the lens of somebody,
4609.40s: I really enjoy teaching. And from the lens of somebody that enjoys teaching, having people that
4616.36s: are genuinely interested in the stuff that you teach and the stuff that you work on is so cool.
4622.84s: It's the ability to talk about this thing that I'm obsessed with with other people, which is
4629.64s: incredible. It's so fun. So I am extremely eager. My goal for the end of the year is 40,000 subs.
4637.88s: I am so far behind that it's not even funny. The probability of that happening is very low,
4643.48s: but it's the goal I started with. So I will continue to reiterate that goal simply because if I don't
4649.24s: hit it, then you all should also see me miss a goal. And I don't want to. I'm going to see what I can
4654.92s: do to continue innovating and avoid that. But the other thing is, if I miss it, I miss it. The way
4660.84s: I look at growing our community, I care so much more about having people find their way into our
4666.20s: community that are quality people over the number of people. And remember, is why I care about
4670.28s: subs on YouTube, honestly, it's two reasons. The first one is because it does show, it's a benchmark
4675.88s: that I can measure that does show if more people are interested in staying around because then
4681.72s: that obviously reflects that I'm doing stuff that they find valuable. This second thing is when
4686.76s: I'm reaching out for podcasts and stuff like that, it's much easier to talk to people and to
4692.04s: invite them on to collaborate on content or to record a podcast if you have a following.
4698.04s: There's a lot of other people that's a big factor for how they choose to get their reputation out.
4703.56s: So that's just the reality of things. So from those two lenses, it does matter to me.
4709.24s: But I am really, really stoked to keep talking along with everybody. As always, if you need anything,
4716.36s: you can always find me around in the discord and be an outlier. See you guys later.
