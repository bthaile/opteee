0.00s: What about liars? We have, uh, we have our mascot in the house. He was actually just like
14.16s: fully dead asleep. So he's, he's waking up. But he's, he's happy to be here and he is ready
25.56s: to start talking about some options. He likes the condensation from like the, the cans.
33.88s: But he's very, he's very sleepy right now getting a lot of face licking. Good boy. I thought
42.36s: I'd let you guys see the man, the man of the hour. All right. Let's definitely, let's get
49.72s: my face out of the way. Nobody needs that in their life. All right. Let's talk about the game
55.56s: plan for today. I had a few things that I want to cover with you. But my hope is for me to cover
62.44s: them in a bit of an interactive style session. So my objective here is I want to work through
73.72s: with you this process of analyzing trade opportunities and then building a trade off of that.
85.00s: Now for a quick reminder, I wanted to start with the idea of kind of how to build a trade. We
94.12s: talked about this actually at length, not too long ago. And I'll leave it up here just for a moment.
101.48s: And before we get too far down the line here, you know that we got to say hello to everybody.
107.56s: So I see we got Anthony, E long songs, grab a terrorist, Hater, Teddy,
117.24s: Reese, Anthony, Mick, Eric, it looks like Teddy. Teddy says, I really like your vids, but you should
125.40s: drop the GME crap that's bad for people's brains. Honestly, I don't blame it. It's okay if you
132.52s: don't like it, don't tune into those videos then. That's all I got to say to that. If you talk
137.80s: about GME, I'm outy. Yeah, that's totally cool. You should, you should bounce at any point that's
144.84s: no skin off my back. And I think that that's a completely fair, fair structure. So Teddy goes,
152.28s: this guy's my hero. I love this dude, but no more GME. Unfortunately, homie, there's going to be
157.88s: more GME. Now that's not really the focus of today's session, right? So the focus of today's session
163.16s: is outlier, option straight in for beginners. So I absolutely segment what I do. But yeah,
171.40s: that's totally okay. If that's not your bag. For me, I've talked about GME enough to, I think for
176.68s: most people to understand my interest in it and why I like exploring it. But yeah, that's totally
182.20s: cool. If that's not your bag, there's absolutely no problem. All right, let's see who else we got
189.88s: in here. I got distracted. We got Hader Reese Anthony Mick. Oh, I think I already said all you
196.28s: guys. Hounds trail Anthony. Anthony says, can we look at Carvana a little tonight? A little more
201.72s: importantly, how do the new breaks on the vet feel? We got Akschat. That's a fucking fascinating
209.40s: name. Gotta be honest with you. Wow. Akschat Rastogi. Big fan of that name shout out to you.
217.72s: They're roaring titties not here. Otherwise, I would honestly have to say I still prefer that
222.68s: over Akschat, but Akschat is not that far off. All right. Anthony saying, how do the breaks on
229.48s: the vet feel? The vet is still being worked on actually. I can show you the latest picture
236.28s: from right now. I'm installing a much larger catch can because it really needs it. I don't know
245.00s: how well this is going to come through. Let me change this really fast so that you could see.
249.80s: It might be difficult to see, but that's inside the passenger wheel well. And you can see the red
257.64s: is the caliper right there. And then this is the new catch can. So I'm actually running like a dual
266.20s: catch can system, but I have two 12 lines to vent the crankcase. So we are keeping that, keeping the
275.16s: vet happy, healthy, ready to rock and roll. We also got Shrejay. Great to see you. All right. So
283.96s: let's talk about this in a theoretical sense to start. I just want to talk about this idea of
288.20s: building a trade. What that approach looks like. And then we'll look through some roaring titties.
293.64s: What's up, roaring titties? Man, I'm stoked to see you. I always love seeing that name. It's the
297.64s: best name I think ever on planet earth. Also, the latency should be way better now because I have
304.60s: it updated so that it's a little more real time, which is my preference anyways, to be completely
311.24s: honest. All right. Building a trade. So one of the issues I see traders very, very regularly make
320.52s: when this trying to construct a trade is I think they start from a compromise position. And
327.88s: what I want to do is work through that in detail. So I want to start with
334.28s: getting into the idea and the psychology of building a trade. Then we'll jump in and out of
341.40s: questions. We can bounce around as much as we want. These sessions are designed to be interactive.
345.40s: So feel free. If there's specific stuff you want to look at, throw it in the chat. And then I'm
350.04s: going to base the conversation though around the idea of building trade. So my hope is a little
354.68s: bit later in the video. I want you guys to share tickers that you're looking at. And we literally
360.12s: can walk through analyzing them together because I think there's good experience to be gained there.
364.76s: But we have to start from the beginning, I think. And the beginning in my opinion is thinking through
372.68s: how a portfolio operates. There's a video coming out soon actually that goes through most of these
379.80s: in detail. Yes, I have to add that to my dictionary is dude, people not use skill set as one word.
387.24s: I thought that that was like pretty standard. Anyways, so I want to talk about the primary
393.88s: generation modality for a trade at least in my view. It starts with looking at the portfolio.
400.60s: So when I decide it's time for me to put on a trade, there's typically a few things that lead
408.04s: me to that conclusion. I look at the portfolio and the way it's behaving requires an adjustment
413.96s: in terms of how it aligns with my disposition. The portfolio needs adjustments because some of the
420.04s: trades in the portfolio need to be adjusted, whether it's due to hitting P and L targets, whether
426.60s: it's due to being in the trade long enough, whether it's due to an event is coming up that I don't
431.08s: want to be exposed to those kinds of things. I can also have just an opportunity that I come across.
440.04s: So the way to think about for me at least the origin of searching for a trade, it starts at the
446.60s: portfolio and the genesis of it is does the portfolio need something in particular or am I just going
454.92s: shopping for opportunity because I need to add some risk. But the reason why I start at the portfolios
461.00s: because it naturally sends me down different paths that naturally limits my scope of selection.
468.44s: So I'm not trying to solve this giant problem of there's thousands of things I can trade, how do I
474.04s: pick one. So we can work through in detail how that process flows. So let's start with the portfolio.
483.96s: If we have a portfolio or if I have a portfolio and let's say that there's no specific portfolio
490.84s: need, meaning I look at the portfolio and it's operating as I want, I don't necessarily need to
497.00s: take risk off or add more. It's right now what I'm highlighting is the ability to be very opportunistic
505.32s: in what I'm searching for. So if we're being opportunistic, we need to make sure that what we're
511.88s: looking for fits in the portfolio and that's all based on disposition. So let's literally look at the
518.52s: market as it sits now and come up with that. So as we come over here to the chart and we take a quick
526.12s: look at the market, my disposition is right now is we're coming into a bit of a consolidation.
534.20s: And I think that the market is still up heavy on the year. I think that the market ran very, very heavy.
542.28s: And I think the market was due for a pullback of some type and I think we're starting to see it.
549.88s: Now the quality of that pullback is different because I see the pullback is drastically impacting
556.76s: tech. We can see this move in tech is very pronounced. We can see the S&P 500 is holding up a little
563.00s: bit better and we can see that the Russell is actually selling off really, really hard comparatively.
569.64s: So this has been a fascinating move from the Russell, like one of the like the craziest things I
575.88s: think I've ever seen where over the course of two weeks, it was up almost 20% and now it's coming
581.24s: back down almost the same, not quite. This is a massive change. Now a lot of this dovetails off
586.60s: of what we talked about or what I talked about, I should say on the recap video earlier today.
592.28s: So my goal is not to go through and rehash all of that. If you have specific questions, happy to
597.00s: answer them, but I don't think we have to kind of rehash all of that. I'm just kind of giving you a
602.68s: general layout of how I'm viewing the market right now. So as I think about looking for opportunities,
610.28s: I then can say, do I have a disposition? Do I want to trade stuff that's going to add bullish
616.68s: delta to the portfolio, bearish delta to the portfolio? So you guys tell me, what are we looking for?
623.08s: Pick whatever you want. Are we trying to find trades that are going to add bullish delta or bearish
630.92s: delta? And if you don't know what that means, ask. In the meantime, we are indulging again with yet
639.08s: another crystal tonight, but this one, I realize I have to put my hand behind it. The crystal
646.36s: is this one is also from Iceland. I have a friend there that sends these to me. And this is nectarine
655.32s: and citrus. Big fan. The orange one I think might be my favorite.
661.24s: All right. So I got to be honest. This looks about unanimous that everybody's looking for
666.04s: bearish delta, which doesn't surprise me. I think what most of you are experiencing is what's
672.28s: very, very common. And what's common is people don't necessarily do a great job trading things
678.36s: to the downside. And it's actually one of my favorite trades because they tend to be fast.
683.88s: Right. You've heard the saying the market tends to take the stairs up in the elevator down.
690.04s: That's for a reason. And I think you can see that being generally expressed across the market so far.
697.40s: Right. So if we take a look at the S&P 500, Spy year to date, we'll see that we've ran all the way up,
705.16s: that it out ran all the way up. And this move from 466 to 565 has taken essentially until the 16th of July.
712.92s: And then from the 16th of July, we've gone from 565 down to 532. So still not necessarily in a
718.60s: correction, but kind of on the precipice. But what I'm highlighting is this is like a bigger
723.24s: percentage move in a shorter time frame than relative on this side. So for me, if I'm looking to
731.00s: trade things to the downside, there's a couple immediate triggers that I would look for. And this
737.48s: is a big one actually in terms of, you know, again, depending on what specifically you're trying to
742.52s: build, because even being short the market here writ large, to me, there's a bunch of really,
748.92s: really simple positions that can be built that would run into the downside. But I actually have a
755.80s: different approach. And when I'm looking for weakness, I want to find things that are really,
761.56s: really displaying weakness. So let's look for that. What I'm going to do is pull up a scan.
767.08s: And I'm going to grab a query that is going to look for a few things. This first one is going to
775.24s: look for general negative momentum. Ruta Begas says, put seem to always be more expensive than
780.76s: calls. That's very astute observation. Do you guys know what that's called? That is a very specific
785.56s: phenomenon that's well documented. We know it's there. But good eye, I'm glad that you saw that.
792.36s: That's completely correct. Put skew. That's exactly correct. That is called put skew. Now there
798.60s: are different kinds of skew in the market. But Oxchot calls it Valskew. I wouldn't call it that
806.28s: personally because Valskew can be skewed not necessarily just to the put side. So I think if you
811.64s: want to call it like put Valskew or something, I'm okay with that. But I think you'd have to be
816.52s: just a little more specific. Now, even something like put skew can be context dependent because if we
823.88s: take a look at something like spy and we look at these 49 day options and we look at the puts,
829.64s: same delta puts. Let's find these 30s. 30 delta put is 814 to 830. 30 delta call is 632, 649.
839.56s: Sorry, 595, 609 for the 30 delta call. So like literally a two point difference, big,
846.36s: big difference. Now that's put skew. And there's a very specific reason why put skew exists. Can you
854.92s: guys answer that for me in the chat? And while you're answering that, I will go through and show you
860.76s: another kind of put skew, which is again, it's all contextual. But I can take a look at the
868.04s: open interest or the volume transacted in a day. And the volume that transacted today also had
874.76s: put skew just from a volume perspective where we have 5.7 million puts trade against 4 million calls,
881.40s: more puts traded. That's also put skew from a volume perspective. You can look at it. Oh,
887.32s: not from a delta. You could look at it from a delta perspective, but not what I'm talking about.
891.08s: From an OI perspective, right? So right now, there's massive put skew in terms of OI.
897.16s: Elon Song says, hedging by institutional traders, it's a good guess.
900.92s: Tommy says market willing to pay higher premium to protect the downside. That's the correct answer.
905.56s: So Elon Song, you're not far off. I wouldn't restrict it to be that specific though, because it's not
910.68s: necessarily just hedging by institutional traders that leads to put skew. But it is the general
917.96s: willingness for people to overpay to protect the downside. And there's a reason why that has to happen.
926.28s: Because if you're on the other side of that trade, and you're selling those puts,
935.56s: you know that you are stepping in front of a train track. And sooner or later, it will show up.
944.36s: So in order for this to make sense for a put seller in the aggregate, they're going to demand
951.64s: a premium. So even though technically, these are overpriced on a relative basis, they essentially
959.32s: have to be. Otherwise, nobody would transact with them because it doesn't make sense to.
966.68s: I would much rather have a position if these were priced fairly. I would much rather have the
972.44s: downside position. Why wouldn't I? But the reason why I don't trade long puts just for general
979.08s: hedging is because they are so expensive on a relative basis. So good observation,
986.44s: specifically by who was that? Rudabega. Yeah, you'll typically find that. Now, it's not always the case,
993.72s: but generally you will find that as the case. Great eyeball. Back to the scan. Let's find where the
1000.44s: trash is. So if we're trying to trade stuff to the downside, there's a couple primary profit
1005.32s: mechanisms that I lean on. So for here, you can see that you guys already gave me the purpose.
1012.04s: The purpose here is we want something to be able to make money to the downside.
1016.60s: Then my job as the trader is to figure out what profit mechanism is going to make the most sense
1022.04s: for this kind of thesis. And there's two of them really. There's great volatility trading
1027.24s: opportunities that will exist right now. Harder to get short deltas on them, which we'll talk about.
1032.12s: Beta-weighted deltas to the S&P 500. By the way, that's what I'm referring to there.
1036.44s: The easier profit mechanism for downside plays in my opinion is to trade directionally.
1041.32s: Now, if we want to trade directionally via breakouts, break downs, momentum, drift,
1046.04s: we have to look a little bit for that, which is the game plan right now.
1051.56s: So what I need to do first is actually limit this. So we'll look at like 50 names.
1057.96s: The reason why I have to limit this is because a lot of these are custom scripts.
1062.76s: And in think or swim, if you have too many of them, it won't populate the data if there's too many
1069.88s: returns showing up.
1076.44s: So that's why we got to limit it. All right. Also, YouTube wants me to insert an ad,
1085.32s: would you guys already know the answer to that?
1089.16s: They say it's so nice too. They're like, give it a try. No, we shant. We shall close you.
1096.52s: So what I would do now is take a look on this list. And I want to see what sectors are really
1103.56s: showing up here. What is the common theme that I can find across the products? So I can see
1113.16s: consumer discretionary is struggling. It's coming up repeatedly. And I can see specifically
1120.28s: textiles is not doing well stuff like that. So this becomes interesting to me. I can also see that
1126.52s: IT is struggling a little bit in some sense. And then I can see comm services. Those are like the
1133.16s: main things that are jumping out to me, at least from this perspective here. And there's a couple
1137.40s: other things we'll want to look at. But what I'm doing is I'm painting a picture for this idea.
1142.60s: That I've talked to you about before. But don't know if it's in here.
1151.00s: It doesn't. Oh, this is more about building a trading approach. That's why. Well, the thing I was
1157.80s: looking for in the document is see if I had it is this idea of stacking strength. That's what I'm
1161.16s: trying to do. But in this case, I'm stacking strength to the downside. So it's kind of like
1164.84s: stacking weakness. So you could call it stacking weakness. But I want it to be strong weakness.
1170.92s: So you have to figure out what to call that for yourself. I don't know. So this is looking at
1177.08s: stuff with weekly options though. And we don't have to limit ourselves to this, but this is where I'll
1181.72s: start. So let's take a look now through consumer discretionary. That's of specific interest to me.
1189.08s: Now, another thing that I like to do is take a look at the performance for the sectors,
1199.24s: which I'm going to grab now. I have to log into the web platform. So it's sending me an alert.
1207.64s: Make sure that it's me logging in. It is me. Please trust this device. Thank you.
1215.80s: And then I'm going to go to research. US markets. I'm going to scroll down here.
1225.32s: Okay. So now what I'm doing is I'm looking at the sector performance for the last 35 and one day.
1236.44s: And I'm looking for what's been hanging out at the bottom most frequently. And guess what it is.
1243.64s: Any guesses you guys? You probably know.
1246.44s: If you don't know, you do know.
1252.60s: Tech Tommy is wrong. It is not tech.
1256.04s: Captain Chris says how we doing. Thank you for the live stream. Absolutely. Happy to do it.
1262.04s: Uh,
1265.00s: Well, Tommy already bit the bullet for you guys. There's kind of two things that showed up. There you
1269.88s: go. E long songs. That's what I'm talking about consumer discretionary. Literally,
1273.88s: it's that's what's been shown up at the bottom. This is very common. Again, like the way that I
1279.08s: scan the markets is not by happenstance. I generally know what I'm going to see after I see these
1285.16s: things. Right. So if I find products that have been showing weakness and I'm seeing centralization of
1291.72s: weakness across an individual sector when I'm trying to find stuff that's near lows, that's not a
1296.84s: mistake. So 30 days consumer discretionary was second from the bottom. Five days, it was second
1304.76s: from the bottom. One day, it's at the bottom. Now to Tommy's point, tech started slowing down.
1311.56s: Tech was at the bottom. 30 days. Then five days, it was third from the bottom. And then one day,
1319.64s: tech is like fifth from the bottom. So tech is also completely viable here for a downside play.
1327.00s: But again, I'm going to particularly look for weakness. Now I also have to be honest. In general,
1334.92s: I don't love fading tech. And it's just because it can be a bit of a bumpy road. It doesn't mean
1343.32s: that I won't, but it's not my general preference. So now what I would do is go into something like
1351.56s: market watch. I would pop up in the S&P 500 and I'll take a look and discuss consumer discretionary.
1357.08s: Let's just see what's in here. Amazon's getting killed, which is kind of tech. Tesla's getting
1361.40s: killed, which is kind of tech. So we can see those are not doing well. We can see booking holdings is
1366.44s: doing terribly Airbnb is not doing well. So we can see carmax is also not doing well. So a lot of
1372.52s: these things are not doing well. Now there's an important diversion that happens. I don't necessarily
1380.44s: want to pick the stuff that's at the bottom. The reason being is because sometimes things that are
1386.20s: at price extremes, the same reason why I would trade any other price extreme is that the propensity
1391.88s: for some sort of reversion is actually kind of high. So I don't want to trade the rubber bands that
1398.52s: are expanded all of the way. So that gives me some general ideas to start with. Now what I'll do
1407.48s: is come back into the scan and adjust these parameters. And I want to find stuff that's down
1415.56s: a little bit more, not just negative, but I want to find stuff that's down at least 5%
1425.72s: on the year. So this should clean up some of those results. So we just dropped a little bit more,
1432.36s: which is good. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to find stuff that over kind of the past six
1437.88s: months is negative. And I want to find stuff over the past six months that's negative that's also
1443.32s: negative on the past one month. So something like SPCE is been going down very clearly. Something
1449.24s: like T-Doc is also going down very clearly. S-Y-M is getting beat to the downside. So all of these
1457.24s: start to become viable for perspective downside place. Now today, something like S-Y-M, I noticed
1464.92s: that as it came down, you can see that this was a doji. I don't care so much about the doji. I care
1471.16s: about the expansion of buy volume. So this shows me that there are buyers that are starting to step
1477.40s: in. So it makes me slightly less interested in this to the downside, although it doesn't mean it's
1483.00s: not viable. It still is. SPCE looks like a great downside play via something like short calls.
1492.28s: So I don't necessarily see this accelerating massively to the downside. And also, do you guys
1497.88s: happen to notice what you see here? These are two alerts. And it's because I was trading
1506.04s: volatility risk premium in this. So I had a position on literally that I took off today.
1511.16s: The reason why I was flattening out the portfolio is because I'm going to be kind of stepping away
1516.76s: for about a week, just taking some time off. So I set the portfolio kind of for vacation mode.
1523.16s: But it's funny that this came up in this context because it's something I've already been trading
1527.72s: for this other context, which is very interesting premiums. But that's the way that I would want to
1533.08s: trade this one specifically. Now it has earnings. So at this point, I would either trade it for an
1538.36s: earnings player wait until post earnings or trade it up until earnings. You got another five days.
1543.40s: But that's the first access to good short deltas that I see. I would come in here and I would just
1549.00s: sell calls. Now there's different ways to structure that kind of trade. But that would be an easy one
1557.00s: to start with. And it's even on this list, just a little bit further down. Let me reorg this.
1565.56s: Now let's take a look at T dock. So T dock is another one that I like to the downside.
1573.72s: This one would be set something like here with a stop at like 827 at or above, really above 827
1583.56s: is where I'd want to be getting out. But this one is a little more open. I can either sell calls in here
1590.44s: because I can still see it has variance risk premiums. So that's mostly going to apply to the puts.
1595.72s: But you'll probably see it on the call side as well here. And or we could take a look at structuring
1602.44s: some sort of diagonal. Now it has a lot of calls, which is slightly bullish in tenor. But let's take a
1610.28s: look at what these puts look like. I don't love them. I don't love the liquidity here. But you
1618.36s: notice how these at the money calls, they're at a 23 delta. So the market is really pricing in the
1624.84s: downside. The market is heavily, heavily expecting this not to break up towards ten, but definitely
1629.88s: even down towards five. It kind of likes it. I don't want to say it likes it more, but it likes it
1636.92s: enough that that's an interesting move, right? So what I'm looking at here, these two columns,
1642.84s: this is probability of in the money, probability of a touch, the probability of touching 10 in this
1647.80s: product right now is 33% against a 44% probability of hitting five. So this looks absolutely right to
1655.64s: the downside. Now again, to trade it via short short calls, this would be fine. Something that's
1660.44s: like right at the money. You'd have to put on a million of them because it's only 10 bucks and
1664.68s: you're going to get like 23, 24 dollars, but you could put on a bunch of them or you could find
1671.40s: some puts to get into, but these aren't liquid enough. So this is just an example on why I would
1678.12s: probably also sell calls on this for the downside place. So let's two downside trades that we found
1685.16s: in just a matter of minutes, really. And depending on how many we would want for the portfolio,
1690.76s: this is exactly how the process would go, but I'm going to take a break and take a look at what
1695.16s: you guys are seeing. Anthony says consumer discretionary is middle class consumer spending higher
1700.44s: percent of income and rental insurance less discretionary funds to do things outside the essential.
1706.52s: Yeah, I completely agree with that. And I think that
1712.20s: in the kind of market that we have now, it doesn't surprise me literally whatsoever
1716.76s: to see discretionary struggling here, like literally at all, I think it completely checks out.
1725.64s: ActShot says 5% is applicable to ETS because 5% drops in stock is common.
1731.72s: It's not necessary. I'm not necessarily trying to bifurcate it like that when I was searching for
1736.12s: 5% downside in that context is because I specifically was just looking for things that have
1742.92s: clearly shown downside weakness on the year. So I wanted stuff that wasn't just negative
1748.76s: over the last 252 trading days, but I wanted stuff that was posting negative returns
1753.72s: because there's a propensity for momentum even to the downside. And again, that's why I don't
1758.92s: want to look for things that are at extremes because a reversal is very likely. I want to find
1764.36s: stuff that's just slowly grinding lower. That becomes a really attractive trade for me. So that's
1771.56s: the idea. We have Mango Orange in the house. I like the Mango Orange a lot. It's probably my
1787.32s: favorite spend drift. Ryan says, do you have any vid? I got a ton of vids. Let me be honest with you.
1795.08s: Do you have any vids going over how you use unusual whales specifically for options? Not yet.
1800.68s: That's something we could do at some point. But I don't have anything yet. Ryan says like when you
1808.04s: see bid and mids or structured plays, it can be hard to see they give real definitions, but it's hard
1815.72s: to read the possible play. Yeah. So a couple of things when you're using options in general like that
1822.04s: is regardless if it's unusual whales or just TNS time and sales. The first thing is if you have
1828.28s: stuff that's at the midpoint, you can make a guess. So for example, this 110 call 17 Jan got filled
1836.84s: at 89 cents. The market was 83 by 90. So do I think that this was likely bought or sold? I would
1845.88s: lean towards it being bought because it's one penny off the offer and it's several pennies off
1853.56s: six of them from the bid. So I would just innately assume that this was more likely
1862.68s: bought than sold. Now another really important thing for everybody to understand is that none of
1869.64s: this is concrete. Literally none of this. So when the market shows this green for buying and this
1877.72s: red for selling, they're still guessing. It's not certain. It's very close to certain, but it's
1884.52s: not certain. And I think it's important to understand that. So when this is showing the market at a
1890.68s: penny by 23 and we see the trade coming out of penny, you can be pretty certain that this happened
1898.60s: at the bid, but it's not a direct like we don't know that for certain. There's not like a print
1905.96s: that tells us that's what happened. We're making assumption based on where the market is and where
1911.72s: the trade was. I just think it's really important for people to understand that even when you see
1915.72s: the coloring here, that the platforms are still making an assumption. So that's that part. Now the
1923.88s: other component that I think for Ryan, it's important to understand is at least for me, I don't
1931.32s: care about spreads. So you'll notice that I essentially get rid of spreads almost always. They
1937.80s: don't mean enough to me in this context. Now you can lose some trades that would come through by
1944.44s: spreads that could still be informative if they're large enough. But in general, I simplify it.
1952.28s: I'm looking for things that are really displaying some specific strong conviction.
1959.40s: So I much much much prefer single options for that use case. So that's why I will filter out
1967.56s: essentially the spreads. So same thing in unusual whales. The mid you can essentially just drop it
1974.52s: off. Again, you can leave it on there if you want and kind of see where people are transacting
1979.48s: around to have an idea. So like this mid, let's see, this came in at 90 cents.
1985.64s: But see, like this is just another interesting example. This got flagged at the mid because there
1991.72s: was multiple trades that came in with this. But it came in at an average of 90 cents. The market
1996.44s: was 90 by 92. So even though this is flagging it as a mid because of the multiple transactions,
2003.08s: you could still probably make a guess that these came in at the bid, meaning that they were sales.
2008.44s: But again, we don't know for certain. And it's always important to remind yourself of that in
2013.24s: the beginning because we don't know yet. So yeah, I'm trying to see other interesting examples.
2020.52s: This one's super weird up here. Where was it? The wait, with no, nevermind. So this one,
2029.00s: right? So this is like dead set mid. You have no idea and you can't know. So something like this,
2035.08s: 495 by 515, if it's like dead set mid, you have no idea. And it's just not even worth your time
2042.60s: trying to guess unless there's other, unless this was like a massive trade up, this was like a
2047.56s: $2 million trade, which it wouldn't come in at the mid. That's kind of the cool point. The cool part,
2053.32s: that was a mix of point and part. The cool part is that larger trades, they don't come in at the
2059.88s: mid. They're too big. They push the market. So you can still, if it's a big enough trade,
2064.20s: it's naturally going to trend towards one direction or the other. So it kind of makes it a little
2069.64s: simpler actually to find. So this one's 475. And again, this one's dead set mid, nothing to
2076.84s: derive from that. So yeah, typically you can just kill the mids off. Because the other thing to
2082.84s: keep in mind is from a psychological perspective, if I'm trying to transact at the mid, I'm not in any
2089.24s: sort of big rush to put the trade on. It means I'm trying to get a good fill. I'm trying to play
2093.32s: the field a little bit. Whereas if you have people that are coming in at the bid or the ask,
2099.88s: it means one, again, they're probably moving size two, they're trying to get a fill. So you can,
2107.16s: again, come up with some reasonable estimations, but reiterate, we don't know for certain. It's
2115.40s: an estimation. So hopefully that answers your question.
2122.04s: Ruta Begas says, I read something about selling poor man covered calls. If you can't afford
2127.40s: that many shares, seem too good to be true. But what do I know? I don't know. I would need more
2134.28s: context. Happy to take a look at it and explore that with you. But and I assume when you say
2142.04s: selling poor man covered calls, you mean buying the options and then selling calls against it.
2148.52s: That's essentially the what I do, which is called a ratio diagonal. I don't like the colloquial
2156.36s: names for things. I really prefer the technical terms. It's just I guess me being annoying. But
2162.28s: that sounds like you're looking at ratio diagonals. So let me throw a link to that for you.
2168.76s: There. But yeah, the ratio diagonals are a good strategy. Poor man covered call,
2176.04s: whatever you want to call it. But it's probably not too good to be true. You probably just need
2182.92s: to understand the position more because there's drawbacks. There's a series of drawbacks when you're
2188.68s: trading something like a ratio diagonal. So especially the way that I trade them. Again,
2193.96s: when I'm saying ratio the diagonal, that's the same as what they're referring to, which is
2199.88s: the poor man's covered call. Now the cool part about a ratio called the agnol, I can put it on the
2203.48s: call or the put side. The poor man's covered call typically applies to the call side. But
2214.44s: long call diagonal debit spread. Yeah, exactly. Yep. I'm following you. So yeah, the the strategy
2221.08s: itself is pretty good. I mean, when you say seem too good to be true, what element of it
2227.72s: seem too good to be true to you? And then the meantime, gravitaris is when you say sell calls
2233.00s: would those be covered calls, not necessarily no. So in the context like here, like we're looking at
2240.44s: fading, what was it? T dock. So if we're talking about fading T dock, I would just be selling calls.
2247.64s: So I would go out, I don't like the 14 DTE that's a little too close to I probably do 49,
2252.60s: which is a little too far. But you know, it's like what is what is that fucking that little lady
2259.08s: and the in the porridge and she wrapped fucked all the bears food because she's selfish.
2265.16s: She's a teller. Who the hell was that? What's that story? There's that stupid girl that goes in
2272.44s: to the to the bears food and she fucks up all their food because she's selfish. She's trying
2277.00s: to find the perfect one, Goldilocks. Yeah, yo, she sucks hate her. But with like the I literally
2288.84s: forgot even how Goldilocks came into this equation. Why was I talking about Goldilocks? I literally
2295.40s: just got blinded by rage towards her. Anyways, for short calls, oh, yeah, I was looking for Goldilocks
2302.28s: scenario. That's what it was. So yeah, exactly. Gravitaris is too far too close. It's exactly
2308.52s: it. Thank you. I was thinking about Goldilocks. That's funny that I had the idea. All right, so
2313.56s: let me take a look at selling one of these. And then we can plot it. Now again, this is the
2324.04s: the the risk profile. And this is my pass through account. The reason why I mentioned that it's the
2329.72s: pass through account is because it has no money in it. But two, because it's regulation T margin,
2336.92s: whereas my typical trading account is portfolio margin. I think this is more applicable to people.
2343.40s: So the margin to put on these short calls is $123.50. And then if it's
2353.08s: starts going against us, it expands to like $350. Tree Fitty, like that lockness monster. So
2360.52s: it's a really good return. So in this case, what I would be doing is literally just selling the
2366.28s: calls. Zach says so is this buying a call on the same stock? Never understood what Porman cover
2372.04s: call ratio diagonal is. Check out that video up above. The video up above will get you
2377.08s: schooled up super fast on what the diagonals are. But it's typically same side. So a cliff notes
2384.60s: version, which is actually what I'm running right now on CrowdStrike. And I closed it out today.
2393.08s: But what I do is I like to go further out in time, typically greater than 60 days. And then
2398.84s: if I want to trade it to the downside, I'll look at the puts. I'll find puts that are reasonably
2404.84s: bit asked spread. So like these 77s look at me 4810 by 4935. So about 1.2 and a half. That's okay.
2415.08s: So I would come in here, look at snag in some of these. So let's say we start with buying five of those.
2423.56s: And then you can sell puts against it. So then I would go further out of the money. Maybe something
2430.20s: like these two hundies analyze this, maybe sell like two of those to really favor the downside.
2438.20s: And that is a ratio put diagonal. I have long I have long puts short puts more long puts than
2446.28s: short puts hence the ratio. And the idea here is to try and capitalize on the downside move
2455.08s: while still collecting some premium from these short calls against the long options that were
2462.20s: purchased. So that's that. All right, let's pivot back over now quickly. Actually, this is perfect.
2470.36s: This is talking about structuring trades. So what I would love now is if you guys have trades that
2477.80s: you're looking at anything that you have on that you want to have on or just stuff you're interested in,
2484.36s: we can take a look at some names and just come up with an analysis. We can
2489.32s: or go the portfolio fit component. And then we can just talk about structuring trades.
2495.08s: Spicy avocado says wouldn't it be better just to pick one and go with it?
2499.88s: Not necessarily. No, now it depends again on what we're looking at. Which is if it's something
2508.44s: that you really want to trade to the downside, you absolutely can just sell puts. But there's a
2513.40s: few things that come into play. It's that like if we know where something is going to go, then there's
2519.08s: a easy equation. But I don't know where shit's going to go. I'm actually wrong all the day. I'm
2526.12s: time on where I think things may or may not go. So the idea is to scrub off some directional risk.
2534.04s: It's some delta hedging. But more importantly, it's to help the position because here's the downside
2541.00s: to using options. If I take a look at this 18 oct trade and I go here, I'm losing eight dollars
2547.72s: a day from theta decay. Even though that these are far out in time and pretty far in the money,
2556.12s: they still suffer from theta decay. So by selling options against it, I'm also offsetting
2565.48s: some of the Greeks impact. And in this case, theta is a big one. So in the trade that I put on,
2573.16s: which was what short the 200s, I'm essentially collecting $300 per contract. So if we take a look
2581.64s: at this, these are giving me 24 cents of theta each day. So even though I have five long options
2593.08s: that are losing eight dollars a day, I now have two options that are gaining 24 dollars a day each.
2604.68s: So I'm able to offset my theta decay for the long options. So it's just another way to look at it.
2613.16s: But to your point, there's absolutely nothing wrong at all with just using one. Like if I have a really
2626.44s: strong directional conviction, either I'll sell it at a very light ratio or I just won't sell it
2635.08s: at all. Another thing I like to do is leg into them. So I'll put on the base position first. That's
2640.68s: exactly what I did in CrowdStrike is I put the base position on as we broke out here.
2646.92s: And then I chose to sell puts when it started slowing down. So here. And then I ended up having
2654.44s: to roll the puts because we had a pretty big move against. So I wanted to keep them out of the money.
2661.72s: But the short puts were literally it was that essentially for every 10 longs, I had one
2669.48s: short put against it. So there's a lot of different ways you can set it up.
2676.52s: All right, back up to you guys.
2684.68s: Arjun says poor man's covered call is usually one to one and not a ratio. Yeah, exactly. So that's
2689.56s: what makes it a quote unquote covered call. Now that's the downside, right? There's a reason there's
2695.96s: a very specific reason why I like the ratio diagonal much more than a standard diagonal. So let's
2702.28s: take a look at a standard diagonal, which is typically buying the at the money. Let's turn these off.
2712.28s: And then selling something that's further out of the money. Now we can modify it a little bit too.
2717.32s: We can slide that option a little bit further in the money. Let me take this a little further in.
2724.52s: Oh, I did the same expiration. Some an idiot. My bad.
2730.28s: I was wondering why that looks so squirrely.
2737.80s: So this is what a diagonal often will look like. And sometimes they'll even have risk to the other
2744.28s: side. The reason why it doesn't now is just because this has had such a crazy move. The options are
2749.48s: price pretty crazily. So looking at something like this, you can let me take a look at like a
2757.96s: standard diagonal. But anyways, this is what a normal diagonal. You see it's like very peaky.
2762.68s: And then it'll have either defined profit or it'll actually have risk eventually in the direction
2769.32s: that you want it to go, which is super, super annoying. It's a big problem with them. It's
2774.76s: actually why I set these trades up the way that I do. Let's take a look at Apple.
2780.76s: Apple's still looking pretty normal. And then let's build a quick trade in here. Same structure.
2786.92s: So let's do long these. And let's do like the 50 delta something that's like just slightly in the money.
2797.56s: And then let's sell something near term that's out of the money, kind of like right out of the
2802.92s: money like these 35s. So in this scenario, what I'm doing is I'm being very careful about the delta
2810.92s: selection to make sure that I don't have risk in the same direction. Now what it looks like for
2817.00s: a standard diagonal if you're using the same strike. So let's use instead of the long slightly in
2823.88s: the money. Let's do like these 220 something closer to add the money or even slightly out of the money.
2829.40s: Turn this off. You notice you actually have upside or in this case downside risk. So even if
2835.16s: you get a big price accommodation, it can move it literally can move too far in your favor.
2840.12s: And this is a big problem with diagonals as kind of they're traditionally structured. And this
2845.40s: is still giving it a five five point spread between them. So I don't like diagonals a ton. That's
2853.56s: specifically why I trade ratio diagonals and I set them up the way I do because one, I don't want
2860.12s: to have capped profit potential. And two, I don't want to be penalized if something moves massively in
2867.16s: my favor. I don't want to be too right. There's so many ways to be wrong in trading to be wrong because
2873.72s: your two right is literally just offensive. So that's why I set those up the way that I do.
2884.60s: Let me know if that answers. Well, I guess you didn't even ask a question. I kind of just talked
2887.80s: about the structure. Rika says, could you analyze and video? Yeah, see you look at Nvidia.
2894.28s: All right, what do we think? On a six month basis still trending up. One month basis still
2907.48s: trending up pretty strong. Three month basis trending up but flattening down.
2914.60s: One month basis and we are negative. We are downward sloping. Standard deviation channels are going
2928.60s: down. So when I look at this, this literally right here is actually kind of the initial eyeball spot I
2938.84s: see. And the way I look at it is I want to see what it does in that level. If it starts breaking up
2948.92s: above this, I'm still not necessarily massively bullish until it starts breaking above these here.
2956.44s: And then eventually this here. So if I wanted to trade it to the upside if I had a long thesis,
2964.20s: I would probably trade via short puts, something I can manage or something I can kind of be
2969.40s: slightly wrong and still make money. And then if it breaks down below this, again, I personally
2975.08s: wouldn't want a short Nvidia. But if I did, you can either run short calls or like a ratio put
2982.92s: diagonal, both of those are viable. And then the near term profit target for something like that or
2988.12s: near term price target would be something around like 91.5 down towards this point of control.
2993.88s: Something like this. That is generally what I see. Now from an options perspective,
3009.96s: I still see bullish drift priced in. So 14.9 million calls against 14.3 million puts.
3018.52s: So definitely more calls wanting to be traded here. And if I take a look at the implied
3027.00s: vol for the out of the monies. And then let's clear off those and take a look at these. So it's all
3036.84s: downside risk. Really, that's being priced in not much upside. So yeah, I mean, that's the cliff notes
3044.84s: version. I just essentially want to see how this works. All right.
3054.04s: Ramalama says, I think people on here myself included don't have the ability to sell naked options.
3058.28s: Some of the strategies don't make sense at first because we didn't even have access to the trade
3061.88s: mechanism. You still do. Again, like I don't play the victim. It's a bad mindset. If you can't trade
3069.16s: naked short calls because of permissions, just by the way, just go super far out of the money.
3075.16s: So if I'm trading something like, let's find what the hell are we just looking at that we like
3085.08s: to the downside. Some of the tea is from here. Where are you at? T dock. T dock. So if you want to
3094.92s: trade this to the downside and you can't literally just go in there by that and then buy a really far
3100.44s: out of the money wing by like a 20 delta wing. So you're not going to chew up a bunch of the
3106.20s: credit that you're going to receive. And you essentially still get the same exposure, which is
3112.60s: looking at a short call vertical. So yeah, that's we all start with smaller accounts and you have to
3121.64s: be thrifty and essentially structure stuff a little bit differently. But this is a completely
3127.64s: viable way to do it. The downside here is the margin requirement is much greater because it's now
3133.88s: just calculating based on the width of the wings. So you might have to slide this in a little bit more
3139.08s: and eat a little more of your lunch. So you go from 20 cents to 19 cents if you got a fill. So you're
3144.44s: losing a penny, but you cut your margin requirement in half. Ideally, again, we would just use
3149.72s: single options, but to your point, not everybody has access to them right away. And you just essentially
3155.40s: have to get a little more creative. But yeah, you can literally just do something like the
3161.96s: like by the wings. Ryan says, just want to shout out to you happy to be here. I'm happy to have you
3169.96s: here. That's awesome. I'm glad that it's useful. Reese says, why do we have upside risk if we have
3175.40s: the long call? It's a great question. And it has everything to do with the way that options behave
3182.68s: and the way that gamma behaves. So essentially in the scenario that we're looking at before,
3191.32s: which was I already forgot what that one was in. Was it a crotch drive? Maybe something like this.
3204.36s: No, that's my version. Let's see if we can structure one real fast. Let's do like the at the
3211.16s: monies. So the I mean, oh, I forgot you literally think you can do it with like one click with
3216.68s: this thing. Yeah, by the Agno, there it goes. So what is this doing? It's buying. No, I want to do
3226.84s: the other way. Sell. Agno. Literally never use this. It's 20 set. In the October. I don't like
3240.92s: that one. All right, I'm going to just build it myself. I don't like what they're doing. They're
3244.12s: the 20 there. Typically, they would be closer in explorations as well, but that's okay. And then
3250.28s: the 220 here. So it's more of a calendar spread. But this is like a very I think that's more what
3263.48s: we were kind of talking about. Not necessarily the standard diagonal.
3267.56s: The reason why is just because it's the same strike, by the way, so like if I do the instead of buying
3276.28s: the 220s. And instead I sell like the two 15s and grab the 220s. That's a diagonal. And notice how
3285.88s: it has upside risk. So the reason why this has upside risk is because what ends up happening
3292.92s: is as the underlying moves, the short deltas move fast enough to overwhelm the long deltas.
3305.56s: So it creates a scenario where the underlying itself literally can move too far in your favor.
3316.28s: Once your deltas essentially approximate to whatever their maximum variance is going to be.
3323.40s: And a lot of that is based on the gamma. So you'll notice that if you look at the 20 set,
3330.68s: the gamma here is a one gamma. Here, if you look at the 16 aug, it's a two gamma.
3338.92s: So that means that if this starts moving too fast or too much in your favor, the gamma is
3344.28s: going to pile on to these deltas. And sooner or later, you'll literally have more opposing deltas
3352.36s: than you would have started. Reese says that's been driving me nuts. Thank you. Yeah, you got it.
3357.24s: Easy one. No problem. Take guys all the time. I got to be honest. Like when we're talking about
3362.76s: the game stop stuff, as you could tell, I'm very much a student because I don't know a lot there.
3368.44s: And I'm learning a lot. But when it comes to options, I'm still a student, but I know a lot.
3373.16s: I've been doing options for so fucking long now that most of this stuff is kind of just back
3377.48s: of the napkin. So yeah, that's an easy one. No problem. You crane says, is it better to buy
3389.00s: options to close to them? Oh, that fucked me up. That's funny. I was reading as buy to close.
3397.00s: So you crane says, is it better to buy options close to the money or out of the money? It's a great
3401.32s: question. And I've actually made a video recently with GameStop as I think that somebody's
3408.28s: chagrin. I don't know if I'm allowed to say that because I think somebody said they don't want to
3411.32s: hear it, but you know, too fucking bad. But I have a video. This will be for you, you crane,
3419.00s: which is about buying call options smarter. Like I said, I use GameStop as the context for the video
3425.08s: because I know a lot of people that trade GameStop are buying options and the goal of that video
3431.24s: is to try to help them out a little bit instead of just lighting their money on fire perpetually.
3436.92s: But the video applies to anything. And the answer to that really, it depends on what you're trying
3444.52s: to accomplish with the position. So there's different ways you can structure it. So that video
3449.48s: will literally walk you through it in depth. It goes through how to pick expiration cycle, how to
3454.68s: pick Delta, all those kinds of things. So should be, should be good.
3463.88s: Oxhot says in a broken wing butterfly, how does PNL change when the underlying approaches the
3468.76s: strikes? Will the profit increase first and then decrease or loss increases all throughout?
3474.28s: If you model, if you let me know the exact trade that you want me to look at, we can look at it
3477.56s: together. But a lot of that PNL behavior is going to depend heavily on what you pick. So
3484.84s: if you outline the trade that you want me to look at, we can take a look at it together.
3490.68s: And then in the meantime, we still have a few minutes left. So if there's anything else that you
3497.72s: guys just want to generally talk about, let's let's dive in. In the meantime, I'm going to get my
3503.72s: dinner order ready and launched. Tonight is going to be Mexican food. We're going to hit a carne
3508.84s: asado burrito and then a pollo asado quesadilla. Although I have to be honest with you, I really like
3517.40s: saying quesadilla. I don't know if that's just me, but quesadilla is just a much more fun way to frame
3524.60s: it. So yeah, let me know what you guys want to talk about. In the meantime, I'm going to grab this
3533.72s: and I like going through this because I think this is like really, really useful to understand
3541.96s: what other people are doing and how other traders operate. There's a big reason for those that
3548.20s: don't know. I've always referred to us as the outlier community, even when like the branding
3553.80s: overall was ES invests, which ES is just my initials. It the way that this whole platform YouTube
3560.76s: channel that stuff started was just like I was sharing information with my friends that were
3564.92s: in the military during COVID. Long story short, the community grew, which is awesome, but I've
3571.72s: always referred to this as the outlier community because that's what I pursue as an individual's
3578.60s: outlier performance. Okay, so that ties to this because this is a great example of normal people
3585.88s: performance. This is a great example of how normal people look at markets and realistically,
3592.04s: how you probably should not look at markets. So I actually think it's fun to poke through this
3598.36s: from time to time to use as examples for us to talk through. Ukraine says, what are your thoughts
3608.68s: on spy in terms of what? It's an index. It's got options. It's pulling back. Those are the initial
3618.52s: thoughts. I mean, it fell right down through this volume gap, right? Like there's no volume here
3625.80s: to support it. And I mean, it just dropped right through it. And now it looks like it's entering
3630.20s: another volume node. The next volume node is literally right here. You can see it right there.
3634.84s: And that's where it's hanging out. So to me, if it starts breaking below that,
3640.04s: then it looks like it's going to want to go somewhere down here to like 523, something like that.
3645.96s: But I think the market right now is very, very, very driven by news, very driven by news. So if
3652.12s: we have some sort of advantageous market data come out, then I think it will be favorable. I think
3662.04s: the S&P 500 will shrug it right off. If that doesn't happen, then I think the S&P 500 probably
3668.04s: likes the downside here. And then let me grab the New York Stock Exchange really quick.
3673.72s: Yeah. So even the New York Stock Exchange is starting to rotate down, right? So gross lows is
3680.36s: expanding. Gross highs is contracting. And net highs lows is declining. So this is even in the New
3687.88s: York Stock Exchange starting to want to rotate down. So yeah, that looks pretty rough.
3699.16s: Colonel says, can you look at Intel had bad news all over leading to earnings? Let's see.
3706.44s: I mean, T.C. Yeah. It's terrible. Let me see. I had Intel on my watch list, but I don't think I
3714.92s: traded it. I didn't for earnings. Why did I not?
3729.24s: Let me look really quick.
3733.64s: I had it on my no go list. Oh, that's why. Just because the headway too many previous beats,
3740.04s: so one, two, three, four, five, six literally six out of the past eight had been negative beats,
3750.04s: meaning realize vol exceeded implied. So that's just no good from a vol selling perspective.
3756.28s: So that's why I didn't trade it. But I mean, from here, it's completely different though. You
3764.28s: can trade downside drift in something like Intel. I think that's okay, especially with how bad
3769.64s: the miss was. But I also think that it was really broadly supported by a lot of buy volume today,
3775.16s: a ton of buy volume, literally 68% buy volume. So I don't necessarily think that the market hates
3782.28s: it down here and it looks like people are kind of scooping it up and droves. So for me, this would
3788.36s: be nothing yet. I would want to see at least another day or two to see how it performs. The
3793.72s: thing that you'll notice about my approach to trading is very rarely am I trying to top tick or
3798.20s: bottom tick things. I don't care to catch things at like the perfect time. I want to put on stuff
3805.48s: that generally shows strength so that there's a higher probability of it doing what I want it to do.
3812.20s: That's the idea. So in this kind of scenario, like I just had a big down move, I would favor it to
3819.72s: the downside. I wouldn't be opposed to trading something like short puts because I know of all is
3823.72s: going to be really high. If it starts to base and show strength, like this kind of scenario is
3829.32s: great for selling short puts, right? So you can see drop down drifted south ever so slightly started
3837.48s: to look okay. And then it's just come off a cliff. So it wouldn't surprise me if essentially this
3843.40s: next quarter looked a lot like this past quarter. Like that, I don't think is too crazy. But in order
3848.92s: for me to do anything in it personally, I would need to see another couple days. I'm not trying to
3853.64s: catch it right at the turn. It's just a really tough way to trade. That's generally going to run
3860.12s: unsuccessful in my opinion. Oaklaus says what platform broker. This is thinker swim, which is through
3868.76s: Schwab. Rama Lama says, could you elaborate a little more on the wide wings for selling calls,
3878.76s: synthetic short strangle by doing an odd core? Yeah, what about it? When you say Mr. Lama,
3886.68s: let me know what you want to talk about specifically there. And I'm happy to. But yeah, that's
3891.16s: that's like a really common approach for smaller accounts is to just add the longer wings. The other
3898.36s: thing sometimes is I'll do it literally just for risk control. If I'm trading something that I have
3903.88s: some sort of fear that it might run to the upside and not come back also calls against or I'll buy
3910.84s: calls against short calls that are further out of the money. No problem. I just keep it to an
3915.24s: absolute minimum. It's very seldom that I'll do that because I'm typically going to lean more
3919.96s: heavily on just managing the trade. But that's definitely not outside something I would do. It's
3926.76s: completely reasonable actually in my opinion. And it's a smarter way, I think, to build positions
3933.32s: into trade. But yeah, Rama Lama, if you let me know specifically what you want me to elaborate on
3939.88s: with respect to that, I'm more than happy to. I see. Rama says, it seems like the golden egg being
3947.64s: able to manage an execute naked call put selling. Yeah. Okay. So you're asking more for the tradeoff.
3953.08s: And the tradeoff is very clear. Vertical spreads typically are negatively expectant by their
3959.32s: structure. I'll literally grab my calculator and I'll show you. Let's take a look at a vertical
3967.96s: spread in here. Let's do like 49 days. Rama, what do we want to do? Do we want to do a short or
3975.32s: long vertical spread? And we want to do a caller put dealers choice. You tell me I'm here to
3984.20s: accommodate you. Whatever makes you happy makes me happy. Also, fun fact, if any of you guys know
3991.64s: anything about Alaska, specifically like Anchorage, Seward area, anything like that, I would love
3999.64s: I would love to hear about it. I'm trying to turn off this freaking iPad, but Siri keeps listening
4005.16s: to me sketchy. Siri's a little sketchy short call got it. So first, let's take a look at a short
4011.80s: call spread. So what I need to do is grab where is my spread? Over here.
4026.12s: So what I'm doing is I'm dropping this in a calculator for me.
4029.72s: Let's see. So our strike width is going to be a dollar.
4042.04s: The probability of profit from the time of entry. So the probability of this being in the money
4049.56s: is 43%. So we have like a 57% probability of profit 57. The credit received here
4059.96s: is 39 cents.
4062.92s: Wait, 39. We're going to plan on keeping the whole profit. We're not going to have any sort of stop.
4070.20s: And we're not going to have a stop. So the neutral credit in order for this to be like a
4081.08s: neutrally expectant strategy is 43 cents based on these probabilities. So the moment you enter
4089.00s: this trade, you're coming in with negative edge. So that's just a $1 wide vertical spread. Now it
4096.92s: gets better if it's wider. So let's do a $5 wide. Let's do shit. Click the wrong thing. My bad.
4104.92s: There we go. So now let's look at a $5 wide. And then the probability
4115.56s: of making this $1.15 is
4124.52s: same there. This is getting $1.15.
4132.76s: So this is still woefully underpaid. Very, very underpaid. So that's the main problem when you add
4142.60s: verticals is you're overpaying for the thing that you're selling or over not getting enough
4151.72s: for what you're selling if you're buying. That's kind of the nature of options. So
4158.36s: the other problem with it is you give up a lot of your potential profit. Again, there's a positive.
4164.44s: Right? You're capturing and you're managing your risk, which that's the thing about trading
4169.32s: is that it's a series of trade-offs so that you can structure things exactly how you want it.
4176.04s: So in this case, when we have this kind of vertical,
4186.76s: you can see these are all messed up. That's weird. Let me just do plus or minus one steering deviation.
4197.32s: So you can see that says it's had like a really high probability of profit.
4201.48s: But the problem is you're trying to make $1.15 while risking $3.85.
4207.48s: So you need to win a lot of these in order to be able to handle a single loss.
4214.36s: Right? So in this case, you can see the initial problem if you're not correct directionally.
4223.08s: Okay, so Oxshot says broken wing butterfly. All right, let's take a look.
4228.12s: But let me know if that answers some of your question, Lama, on like why like the trade-off,
4234.44s: because that's all it is. That's not to say that verticals are terrible. I don't like them in
4237.56s: general, because I just think it's better to move past them as fast as you can. But like they're
4241.80s: not going to break anything. That's kind of the cool part about verticals is that they move slow.
4250.20s: So you're not necessarily going to break any records to the upside.
4255.56s: And it's not going to be terrible to the downside. I just realized really quick. I have like two
4262.04s: minutes left to double dash. And you boy needs, we need some milk, man.
4269.08s: Give me one second before this runs out. What kind of milk do you guys like? I am a whole milk kind of guy.
4279.40s: I feel like that's less common now though. I feel like people are like really, really.
4285.24s: Well, that's cool. They have like a, uh,
4288.12s: Strout family creamery ain't never heard of that. Let's grab that.
4294.36s: Whole milk, spicy avocado. I respect. I respect your game. I feel like that's the right.
4301.08s: I feel like that's the right go. Keto-minded. I see. I like it. Oxshot is going for the balance
4308.44s: 2% that's good. I think that's fair to want to balance it out a little bit.
4318.92s: I feel like I'm just a little bit more reckless than that. And I don't actually care.
4324.12s: All right. So I got what I need. Let me get this milk order off.
4339.16s: Yo, this fucking, this Strout family creamery organic whole milk. It's half a gallon for $7.
4346.04s: They are not playing no games.
4348.28s: All right. That's, uh, that was a must. Thanks for hanging in there because
4359.32s: milk is like my lifeblood. So if I was going to have Mexican food without milk, I don't know what
4363.48s: I was going to do. It was going to be a big problem. Big, big problem.
4370.60s: All right. So back up to this butterfly. Let's take a look. You're looking at five aug,
4376.84s: which I don't love because it's really short term. And you're looking at grabbing.
4387.08s: What, what options do you want to use? You have to tell me if you want to use calls or puts.
4391.96s: Because I want to put on like exactly what you're trying to have me put on.
4396.60s: So I see, okay. So you're doing call side. Got it. So we're going to buy the 5380.
4406.28s: A key. All right. I got to hand up. Oh, I tell you what the Ram Alama. Thank you very much for
4421.48s: that 99 that will cover my egregiously overpriced milk. So thank you very much. I very much appreciate
4429.48s: that. Very kind of you. But let me see. Oh, man, this is sore from sitting too long. So we're going
4440.44s: to buy that cell two of these grab one of these 95s. Okay. So this one, this is an interesting
4450.60s: structure, the way you're doing it. So you can see the PNL graph exactly how it would behave here.
4460.20s: So essentially, this will make 90 bucks. And it will continue to try to make 90 bucks up until
4469.00s: essentially it hits 53 78 and a half. And then peak profit is what like 543 at 53 85 or 53 84 and a half.
4484.28s: But it's essentially going to be right centered on that strike. So it should be 85 would be the best.
4489.08s: Yeah. So it's like 588 there. The graph just isn't perfect. So max profit obviously would be at
4494.52s: the center strike. And then we have max loss is 410 and you start to fall into a loss at.
4507.24s: Let me see. Let me assume this will be a little easier. And point it.
4513.56s: Let's call it 53 90 86. Something like that. 53 90 86.
4524.92s: So what's the probability of hitting 53 90 86.
4529.32s: Buy five aug.
4534.28s: 53 90.
4540.28s: 86 ish. So the probability of that being in the money above that that 53 90 86 is like 35 36 percent.
4551.00s: So 36 36 percent probability profit of expiring as of now. But let's see what the probability of a touch is.
4560.20s: 53 90.
4565.08s: 70 percent probability of a touch. The reason why I think it's so important to always remember I
4571.32s: much prefer using probability of a touch versus probability of things being in the money.
4576.20s: You have to remember the probability that you set is at the time of entry.
4581.64s: And the probability that's realized is going to change based on how the underlying moves.
4589.24s: So it's kind of a really, really important differentiation to make.
4594.60s: Because if you use probability of being in the money,
4599.24s: that will be whatever number it is at the beginning of the trade. But then as the trade starts
4603.40s: to move, that's going to change in the probability of touch in my opinion is a much more conservative metric.
4609.88s: Roryne Tittie says what's probability of a touch? Great question.
4613.16s: That simply means what is the probability of price getting to that level before expiration?
4618.28s: So probability of in the money is the probability of an option expiring in the money at the time of
4623.80s: entry, you know, using current vol. Then the probability of touch is what is the probability that the
4630.12s: price of the underlying touches a point gets to a certain point. That's probability of a touch,
4636.92s: which is a really important metric, especially if you're doing anything that includes managing a trade.
4643.88s: To another giant mistake people make.
4647.88s: Zach says so good touch, not a bad touch. It depends on what kind of touch you like, right? Maybe
4653.40s: you like a nice consensual light touch or nice consensual rough touch or hard or soft touch.
4662.68s: It depends on the touch. Who am I to say what kind of touch you as a person like, but it depends
4669.40s: on the kind of touch. Because this could be a bad touch or it could be a good touch.
4674.68s: Good or bad touch is as they say in the eye of the holder. That's what I say.
4683.24s: Ox shot says thanks for answering. Of course. Happy to. Absolutely happy to.
4690.12s: Anything else you guys want to hit. I still got like a few more minutes. We can kind of dance around
4696.20s: to whatever you'd like. Oakland says depends on the touch. I think that's also a fair cop.
4708.28s: Zach says, Mora, we could take a look at Mora. I don't really have an opinion on this.
4720.84s: I mean, it has a ball. That's what I see. Like, I would want to trade ball.
4727.24s: Right. It still has a lot of ball. It was down 5% today.
4736.36s: Earnings. It was estimated at losing 23 cents. It lost 72. So not good.
4742.60s: So this would also be a candidate for kind of a downside drift play for me.
4747.88s: But I would primarily do it through something like short calls.
4752.68s: Read this bad boy to the downside.
4755.56s: And what would that look like? Yeah, I mean, you get paid a ton right now.
4771.48s: But this is one that you would either have to manage very closely or I would
4777.08s: spread it off because this thing can grab legs. But it doesn't look like it looks like it's
4782.28s: been struggling. But again, like, this is a great example. This ran from 19 to a high of 27.
4788.04s: So like, you don't want to get you don't want to get ran over, fallen asleep, not expecting that
4792.84s: to happen. So 19 to 27, let's call it a 10 point move. If we analyze this and we look at a 10 point
4800.92s: move, I'm seeing if my dashers trying to hit me up. Okay, now we're good.
4831.08s: So yeah, back to this probability or like, what would this look at a 10 point move? So that would
4835.88s: take us from spot is 17 to 27. So you have to be ready to take this move, I think, to 27.
4845.88s: So what's the probability of touching 27 over the next expiration cycle, which is 27?
4853.16s: The probability of touching 27 is like 54%. It's a really good probability.
4859.40s: And that would be a really, really massive loss on a relative basis. So I actually wouldn't
4865.80s: love this trade personally. It's not collecting enough because you're collecting $106 for that
4871.88s: probability of getting up to 27, which would lose you 550. Right. So you're making one risking
4880.12s: five and a half. Not if I'm that in it. That's not what I would do. So in this kind of case,
4887.96s: if I wanted to trade vol, I probably would have to trade it via a strangle and go both sides
4894.76s: so that you can get the put skew because these are going to be way more right. Like on a 29
4899.72s: delta, you're getting a dollar or 30 something compared to a dollar eight for the same 30 delta
4905.72s: on the call side. So that will kind of even it out a little bit. It'll help you. Right. So now,
4911.64s: if you get up to that 27 handle, you're losing 400 bucks, but you're collecting 243.
4917.24s: If it hangs out here now, obviously you added risk to the other side now, but I would be less
4922.28s: concerned with the downside risk because it's, I mean, it's already only at 17 bucks. So even if
4927.96s: it goes down to seven, this lose 563 bucks, but what's the probability of it touching down to seven?
4935.40s: In this time frame, which is 27 probability of us getting to seven for a touch is 4.8%.
4944.20s: So you see how I kind of think about how I want to build the trade based on probabilities
4949.88s: so that I'm not just, I now this looks like a good trade before it looked like a problem. But by
4957.88s: collecting that put skew side of things, again, you do open up downside risk. So if you have a really
4963.72s: strong directional disposition, then there's nothing wrong with just trading the short calls and
4967.72s: accept the risk. But for me, when I'm trading something like this, personally, my mind drifts towards
4972.44s: like variance or premiums, but a slightly different structure. Oxchut says, what is your view on TLT?
4981.40s: Yeah, TLT has been interesting. I had a position in it for a while, took it down, built another
4986.76s: position, took it down. So right now, I don't have anything on in here. But I mean, essentially anything,
4992.44s: I first saw when I was breaking above here is one of my first alert went off. And I absolutely
4998.04s: think TLT will continue to rally. My guess is that it will start getting gummed up in like the
5003.32s: hundreds. And so it's getting really close. I think the overall profit potential on this will be
5009.80s: fairly limited because even if it gets above this 100 handle and it starts rallying into the one
5016.04s: of like, that's the thing, right? Like we're now talking about two point moves. It's just not
5019.64s: that exciting for me. So when I first traded TLT, it was really trading like this move from the high
5027.32s: 80s into the mid 90s. That's what I cared about. That was a much better move. And now even though it
5033.48s: looks like it's going off into the moon on a relative basis, it's just not moving a ton.
5039.32s: It's moving to be clear. Like this is a six point move. So it's absolutely moving. But now you have to
5044.44s: kind of think about where's the where's the top line on it? And if I use just longer term references,
5051.80s: like I think the the time it will take it to get back up towards like the mid ones is going to be
5057.48s: a hot minute. And it's got a lot to get through in order to get there. So I think there will be plenty
5063.72s: of buy opportunities that will show up in the interim. So like I'll set alerts like this so that I
5070.28s: can see them. Don't need this. I don't need that. So what I'll do is I'll set like different thresholds.
5078.52s: So as it's breaking above various levels, I'll track it. But it's I mean, it's got a lot. It's
5086.28s: got to get through before it really can in my opinion, like open up meaningfully. So that is the thought
5095.88s: on TLT. All right, gang, time for me to pack it up. Like I said, I'll be out of touch for about a
5107.56s: week. So you guys will be on your own to hold down the four if you're in the discord, make sure you're
5112.76s: playing nice in there doing the good things, paying attention to that risk. I hope you all have a
5118.84s: killer weekend. Do not forget to be an outlier. No live streams next week back on the week after that.
5124.68s: I'll see you guys later.
