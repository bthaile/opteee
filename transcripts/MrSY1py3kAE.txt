0.00s:  What about liars? We have, uh, we have our mascot in the house. He was actually just like
14.16s:  fully dead asleep. So he's, he's waking up. But he's, he's happy to be here and he is ready
25.56s:  to start talking about some options. He likes the condensation from like the, the cans.
33.88s:  But he's very, he's very sleepy right now getting a lot of face licking. Good boy. I thought
42.36s:  I'd let you guys see the man, the man of the hour. All right. Let's definitely, let's get
49.72s:  my face out of the way. Nobody needs that in their life. All right. Let's talk about the game
55.56s:  plan for today. I had a few things that I want to cover with you. But my hope is for me to cover
62.44s:  them in a bit of an interactive style session. So my objective here is I want to work through
73.72s:  with you this process of analyzing trade opportunities and then building a trade off of that.
85.00s:  Now for a quick reminder, I wanted to start with the idea of kind of how to build a trade. We talked
94.52s:  about this actually at length, not too long ago. And I'll leave it up here just for a moment. And
101.72s:  before we get too far down the line here, you know that we got to say hello to everybody.
107.56s:  So I see we got Anthony, E Long songs, grab a terrorist, Hater, Teddy,
117.32s:  Reese, Anthony, Mick, Eric, it looks like Teddy. Teddy says, I really like your Vids, but you should
125.40s:  drop the GME crap that's bad for people's brains. Honestly, I don't blame it. It's okay if you
132.52s:  don't like it, don't tune into those videos then. That's all I got to say to that. If you talk
137.80s:  about GME, I'm outy. Yeah, that's totally cool. You should, you should bounce at any point that's
144.84s:  no skin off my back. And I think that that's a completely fair, fair structure. So
150.20s:  Teddy goes, this guy's my hero. I love this dude, but no more GME. Unfortunately, homie, there's going
157.72s:  to be more GME. Now that's not really the focus of today's session, right? So the focus of today's
162.52s:  session is outlier, option straight in for beginners. So I absolutely segment what I do.
170.52s:  But yeah, that's totally okay. If that's not your bag. For me, I've talked about GME enough
175.72s:  to, I think for most people to understand my interest in it and why I like exploring it. But
181.48s:  yeah, that's totally cool. If that's not your bag, there's absolutely no problem.
187.16s:  All right, let's see who else we got in here. I got distracted. We got Hader, Reese, Anthony,
194.52s:  Mick. Oh, I think I already said all you guys. Hounds trail, Anthony. Anthony says, can we look
200.12s:  at Carvana a little tonight? A little more importantly, how do the new breaks on the vet feel?
205.72s:  We got AXHAT. That's a fucking fascinating name. Gotta be honest with you. Wow. AXHAT
213.32s:  Rastogi. Big fan of that name shout out to you. They're roaring titties not here. Otherwise,
220.04s:  I would honestly have to say I still prefer that over AXHAT, but AXHAT is not that far off.
226.36s:  All right. Anthony saying, how do the breaks on the vet feel? The vet is still being worked on,
232.28s:  actually, I can show you the latest picture from right now. I'm installing a much larger
241.48s:  catch can because it really needs it. I don't know how well this is going to come through. Let me
247.00s:  change this really fast so that you could see. It might be difficult to see, but that's inside the
254.28s:  passenger wheel well. You can see the red is the caliper right there. Then this is the new catch can.
264.12s:  So I'm actually running like a dual catch can system, but I have two 12 lines to vent the crankcase.
272.20s:  So we are keeping the vet happy, healthy, ready to rock and roll.
278.84s:  We also got Shrej a great to see you. All right. So let's talk about this in a theoretical sense to
286.68s:  start. I just want to talk about this idea of building a trade. What that approach looks like.
291.00s:  And then we'll look through some. Roing titty. What's up Roing titty man? I'm stoked to see you. I always
296.52s:  love seeing that name. It's the best name I think ever on planet earth. Also, the latency should
301.32s:  be way better now because I have it updated so that it's a more real time, which is my preference
309.00s:  anyways, to be completely honest. All right. Building a trade. So one of the issues I see traders
318.20s:  very, very regularly make when this trying to construct a trade is I think they start from a
325.80s:  compromised position. And what I want to do is work through that in detail. So I want to start with
335.24s:  getting into the idea and the psychology of building a trade. Then we'll jump in and out of
341.48s:  questions. We can bounce around as much as we want. These sessions are designed to be interactive.
345.48s:  So feel free. If there's specific stuff you want to look at throughout in the chat. And then
349.88s:  I'm going to base the conversation though around the idea of building trades. So my hope is a little
354.76s:  bit later in the video. I want you guys to share tickers that you're looking at. And we literally
360.04s:  can walk through analyzing them together. Because I think there's good experience to be gained there.
364.76s:  But we have to start from the beginning, I think. And the beginning in my opinion is thinking through
372.60s:  how a portfolio operates. There's a video coming out soon actually that goes through most of these
379.80s:  in detail. Yes, I have to add that to my dictionary is do people not use skill set as one word.
387.24s:  I thought that that was like pretty standard. Anyways, so I want to talk about the primary
393.88s:  generation modality for a trade at least in my view. It starts with looking at the portfolio.
400.60s:  So when I decide it's time for me to put on a trade, there's typically a few things that lead
408.04s:  me to that conclusion. I look at the portfolio and the way it's behaving requires an adjustment in
414.04s:  terms of how it aligns with my disposition. The portfolio needs adjustments because some of the
420.04s:  trades in the portfolio need to be adjusted, whether it's due to hitting P and L targets, whether
426.60s:  it's due to being in the trade long enough, whether it's due to an event is coming up that I don't
431.08s:  want to be exposed to those kinds of things. I can also have just an opportunity that I come across.
439.96s:  So the way to think about for me at least the origin of searching for a trade, it starts at the
446.60s:  portfolio. And the genesis of it is does the portfolio need something in particular? Or am I just
454.44s:  going shopping for opportunity because I need to add some risk? But the reason why I started the
460.28s:  portfolios is because it naturally sends me down different paths that naturally limits my scope of
467.48s:  selection. So I'm not trying to solve this giant problem of there's thousands of things I can trade.
473.64s:  How do I pick one? So we can work through in detail how that process flows. So let's start with the
482.68s:  portfolio. If we have a portfolio or if I have a portfolio and let's say that there's no specific
489.88s:  portfolio need, meaning I look at the portfolio and it's operating as I want. I don't necessarily need
496.68s:  to take risk off or add more. It's right now what I'm highlighting is the ability to be very opportunistic
505.24s:  in what I'm searching for. So if we're being opportunistic, we need to make sure that what we're
511.80s:  looking for fits in the portfolio. And that's all based on disposition. So let's literally look at
518.36s:  the market as it sits now and come up with that. So as we come over here to the chart and we take
525.80s:  a quick look at the market, my disposition is right now is we're coming into a bit of a consolidation.
534.20s:  And I think that the market is still up heavy on the year. I think that the market ran very,
540.84s:  very heavy. And I think the market was due for a pullback of some type. And I think we're starting
548.92s:  to see it. Now the quality of that pullback is different because I see the pullback is drastically
555.88s:  impacting tech. We can see this move in tech is very pronounced. We can see the S&P 500 is holding
562.60s:  up a little bit better. And we can see that the Russell is actually selling off really,
567.16s:  really hard comparatively. So this has been a fascinating move from the Russell. Like one of the
573.88s:  the like the craziest things I think I've ever seen where over the course of two weeks, it was
579.24s:  up almost 20% and now it's coming back down almost the same, not quite. This is a massive change.
584.44s:  Now a lot of this dovetails off of what we talked about or what I talked about, I should say,
589.72s:  on the recap video earlier today. So my goal is not to go through and rehash all of that. If you
595.08s:  have specific questions, happy to answer them. But I don't think we have to kind of rehash all of
600.28s:  that. I'm just kind of giving you a general layout of how I'm viewing the market right now.
607.24s:  So as I think about looking for opportunities, I then can say, do I have a disposition? Do I
613.16s:  want to trade stuff that's going to add bullish delta to the portfolio, bearish delta to the
619.16s:  portfolio. So you guys tell me, what are we looking for? Pick whatever you want. Are we trying to
624.68s:  find trades that are going to add bullish delta or bearish delta? And if you don't know what that
631.96s:  means, ask. In the meantime, we are indulging again with yet another crystal tonight. But this one,
641.96s:  I realize that to put my hand behind it, the crystal is this one is also from Iceland. I have a
650.52s:  friend there that sends these to me. And this is nectarine and citrus. Big fan, the orange one I think
657.96s:  is might be my favorite. All right. So I got to be honest, this looks about unanimous that everybody's
665.72s:  looking for bearish delta, which doesn't surprise me. I think what most of you are experiencing,
671.88s:  is what's very, very common. And what's common is people don't necessarily do a great job
677.72s:  trading things to the downside. And it's actually one of my favorite trades because they tend to be
683.00s:  fast. Right. You've heard the saying, the market tends to take the stairs up in the elevator down
690.12s:  that's for a reason. And I think you can see that being generally expressed across the market so far.
697.40s:  Right. So if we take a look at the S&P 500, it's spied here to date. We'll see that we've ran all
704.84s:  the way up, that it ran all the way up. And this move from 466 to 565 has taken essentially until
711.56s:  the 16th of July. And then from the 16th of July, we've gone from 565 down to 532. So still not
717.80s:  necessarily in a correction, but kind of on the precipice. But what I'm highlighting is this is like
722.68s:  a bigger percentage move in a shorter time frame than relative on this side. So for me, if I'm looking
730.84s:  to trade things to the downside, there's a couple immediate triggers that I would look for.
736.84s:  And this is a big one actually in terms of, you know, again, depending on what specifically you're
742.20s:  trying to build because even being short the market here writ large, to me, there's a bunch of
748.52s:  really, really simple positions that can be built that would run into the downside. But I actually
755.40s:  have a different approach. And when I'm looking for weakness, I want to find things that are
761.00s:  really, really displaying weakness. So let's look for that. What I'm going to do is pull up a scan.
767.08s:  And I'm going to grab a query that is going to look for a few things. This first one is going to
775.24s:  look for general negative momentum. Ruta Vegas says put seem to always be more expensive than
780.76s:  calls. That's very astute observation. Do you guys know what that's called? That is a very specific
785.56s:  phenomenon that's well documented. We know it's there. But good eye. I'm glad that you saw that.
792.36s:  That's completely correct. Put skew. That's exactly correct. That is called put skew. Now there are
798.68s:  different kinds of skew in the market. But Oxchot calls it Valskew. I wouldn't call it that
806.28s:  personally because Valskew can be skewed not necessarily just to the put side. So I think if you
811.64s:  want to call it like put Valskew or something, I'm okay with that. But I think you'd have to be
816.44s:  just a little more specific. Now even something like put skew can be context dependent because if we
823.88s:  take a look at something like spy and we look at these 49 day options and we look at the puts.
829.64s:  Same Delta puts. Let's find these 30s. 30 Delta put is 814 to 830. 30 Delta call is 632, 649.
839.56s:  Sorry. 595, 609 for the 30 Delta call. So like literally a two point difference. Big, big difference.
848.04s:  Now that's put skew. And there's a very specific reason why put skew exists. Can you guys
855.32s:  answer that for me in the chat? And while you're answering that, I will go through and show you
860.76s:  another kind of put skew, which is again, it's all contextual. But I can take a look at the open
868.36s:  interest or the volume transacted in a day. And the volume that transacted today also had put skew,
875.32s:  just from a volume perspective where we have 5.7 million puts trade against 4 million calls.
881.40s:  More puts traded. That's also put skew from a volume perspective. You can look at it. Oh,
887.32s:  not from a Delta. You could look at it from a Delta perspective, but not what I'm talking about.
891.08s:  From an OI perspective, right? So right now there's massive put skew in terms of OI.
897.16s:  Elon Song says, hedging by institutional traders, that's a good guess. Tommy says market
901.96s:  willing to pay higher premium to protect the downside. That's the correct answer. So Elon
906.20s:  songs, you're not far off. I wouldn't restrict it to be that specific though, because it's not
910.68s:  necessarily just hedging by institutional traders that leads to put skew. But it is the general
917.96s:  willingness for people to overpay to protect the downside. And there's a reason why that has to
924.76s:  happen. Because if you're on the other side of that trade and you're selling those puts,
935.56s:  you know that you are stepping in front of a train track. And sooner or later, it will show up.
944.36s:  So in order for this to make sense for a put seller in the aggregate, they're going to demand
951.64s:  a premium. So even though technically, these are overpriced on a relative basis, they essentially
959.32s:  have to be. Otherwise, nobody would transact with them because it doesn't make sense to. I would
967.08s:  much rather have a position. If these were priced fairly, I would much rather have the downside
973.00s:  position. Why wouldn't I? But the reason why I don't trade long puts just for general hedging
979.80s:  is because they are so expensive on a relative basis. So good observation, specifically by who was
989.16s:  that? Rudebega. Yeah, you'll typically find that. Now, it's not always the case, but generally,
994.68s:  you will find that as the case. Great eyeball. Back to the scan. Let's find where the trash is.
1001.64s:  So if we're trying to trade stuff to the downside, there's a couple primary profit mechanisms that
1006.36s:  I lean on. So for here, you can see that you guys already gave me the purpose. The purpose here
1013.00s:  is we want something to be able to make money to the downside. Then my job as the trader is to figure
1019.08s:  out what profit mechanism is going to make the most sense for this kind of thesis. And there's two of
1024.44s:  them really. There's great volatility trading opportunities that will exist right now.
1029.48s:  Harder to get short deltas on them, which we'll talk about. Beta weighted deltas to the S&P 500.
1034.04s:  By the way, that's what I'm referring to there. The easier profit mechanism for downside
1038.68s:  plays in my opinion is to trade directionally. Now, if we want to trade directionally via breakouts,
1044.04s:  break downs, momentum drift, we have to look a little bit for that, which is the game plan right now.
1051.56s:  So what I need to do first is actually limit this. So we'll look at like 50 names.
1058.04s:  The reason why I have to limit this is because a lot of these are custom scripts. And in think or
1063.48s:  swim, if you have too many of them, it won't populate the data if there's too many returns showing up.
1076.44s:  So that's why we got to limit it. All right. Also, YouTube wants me to insert an ad,
1085.32s:  would you guys already know the answer to that? They say it's so nice too. They're like, give it a try.
1092.44s:  No, we shant. We shall close you. So what I would do now is take a look on this list. And I want to see
1102.04s:  what sectors are really showing up here. What is the common theme that I can find across the products?
1111.40s:  So I can see consumer discretionary is struggling. It's coming up repeatedly. And I can see specifically
1120.20s:  textiles is not doing well stuff like that. So this becomes interesting to me. I can also see that
1126.44s:  IT is struggling a little bit in some sense. And then I can see comm services. Those are like the
1133.16s:  main things that are jumping out to me, at least from this perspective here. And there's a couple
1137.32s:  other things we'll want to look at. But what I'm doing is I'm painting a picture for this idea
1142.60s:  that I've talked to you about before. But don't know if it's in here.
1151.00s:  It doesn't. Oh, this is more about building a trading approach. That's why. Well, the thing I was
1157.80s:  looking for in the document is see if I had it is this idea of stacking strength. That's what I'm
1161.24s:  trying to do. But in this case, I'm stacking strength to the downside. So it's kind of like stacking
1165.32s:  weakness. So you could call it stacking weakness. But I want it to be strong weakness.
1171.00s:  So you have to figure out what to call that for yourself. I don't know. So this is looking at
1177.16s:  stuff with weekly options though. And we don't have to limit ourselves to this, but this is where I'll
1181.72s:  start. So let's take a look now through consumer discretionary. That's of specific interest to me.
1189.08s:  Now another thing that I like to do is take a look at the performance for the sectors,
1199.24s:  which I'm going to grab now. I have to log into the web platform. So it's sending me an alert.
1207.64s:  Make sure that it's me logging in. It is me. Please trust this device. Thank you.
1215.80s:  And then I'm going to go to research. US markets. I'm going to scroll down here.
1224.76s:  Okay. So now what I'm doing is I'm looking at the sector performance for the last 35 and one day.
1236.44s:  And I'm looking for what's been hanging out at the bottom most frequently. And guess what it is.
1243.64s:  Any guesses you guys? You probably know.
1246.44s:  If you don't know, you do know.
1252.60s:  Tech Tommy is wrong. It is not tech.
1256.04s:  Captain Chris says how we doing. Thank you for the live stream. Absolutely. Happy to do it.
1262.28s:  Uh,
1265.08s:  Well, Tommy already bit the bullet for you guys. There's kind of two things that showed up. There you
1269.88s:  go. We long songs. That's what I'm talking about consumer discretionary. Literally,
1273.88s:  it's that's what's been shown up at the bottom. This is very common. Again, like the way that I
1279.08s:  scan the markets is not by happenstance. I generally know what I'm going to see after I see these
1285.16s:  things. Right. So if I find products that have been showing weakness and I'm seeing centralization of
1291.72s:  weakness across an individual sector when I'm trying to find stuff that's near lows, that's not a
1296.84s:  mistake. So 30 days consumer discretionary was second from the bottom. Five days, it was second
1304.76s:  from the bottom. One day, it's at the bottom. Now to Tommy's point, tech started slowing down.
1311.56s:  Tech was at the bottom. 30 days. Then five days, it was third from the bottom. And then one day,
1319.64s:  tech is like fifth from the bottom. So tech is also completely viable here for a downside play.
1327.00s:  But again, I'm going to particularly look for weakness. Now, I also have to be honest.
1332.84s:  In general, I don't love fading tech. And it's just because it can be a bit of a bumpy road.
1342.84s:  It doesn't mean that I won't, but it's not my general preference. So now what I would do is go
1350.84s:  into something like market watch. I would pop up in the S&P 500 and I'll take a look and
1355.88s:  consumer discretionary. Let's just see what's in here. Amazon's getting killed, which is kind of
1360.36s:  tech. Tesla's getting killed, which is kind of tech. So we can see those are not doing well.
1364.92s:  We can see booking holdings is doing terribly Airbnb is not doing well. So we can see
1370.20s:  Carmax is also not doing well. So a lot of these things are not doing well. Now there's an important
1377.16s:  diversion that happens. I don't necessarily want to pick the stuff that's at the bottom.
1382.68s:  The reason being is because sometimes things that are at price extremes, the same reason why I would
1388.52s:  trade any other price extreme is that the propensity for some sort of reversion is actually kind of high.
1395.72s:  So I don't want to trade the rubber bands that are expanded all of the way. So that gives me
1402.28s:  some general ideas to start with. Now what I'll do is come back into the scan and adjust these
1409.96s:  parameters. And I want to find stuff that's down a little bit more, not just negative, but I want
1418.20s:  to find stuff that's down at least 5% on the year. So this should clean up some of those results.
1429.96s:  So we just dropped a little bit more, which is good. Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to find
1435.40s:  stuff that over kind of the past six months is negative. And I want to find stuff over the past
1441.56s:  six months that's negative that's also negative on the past one month. So something like SPCE
1447.24s:  has been going down very clearly. Something like T-Doc is also going down very clearly.
1452.68s:  S-Y-M is getting beat to the downside. So all of these start to become viable for perspective
1459.80s:  downside place. Now today something like S-Y-M, I noticed that as it came down, you can see that
1467.72s:  this was a doji. I don't care so much about the doji. I care about the expansion of buy volume.
1473.72s:  So this shows me that there are buyers that are starting to step in. So it makes me slightly
1479.24s:  less interested in this to the downside, although it doesn't mean it's not viable still is.
1484.92s:  S-P-C-E looks like a great downside play. V is something like short calls. So I don't necessarily see
1494.04s:  this accelerating massively to the downside. And also, do you guys happen to notice what you see here?
1501.16s:  These are two alerts. And it's because I was trading volatility risk premium in this. So I had a
1508.84s:  position on literally that I took off today. The reason why I was flattening out the portfolio is
1514.04s:  because I'm going to be kind of stepping away for about a week, just taking some time off.
1519.96s:  So I set the portfolio kind of for vacation mode. But it's funny that this came up in this context
1525.72s:  because it's something I've already been trading for this other context, which is very
1530.60s:  interesting premiums. But that's the way that I would want to trade this one specifically.
1534.44s:  Now it has earnings. So at this point, I would either trade it for an earnings player wait
1539.48s:  until post earnings or trade it up until earnings. You got another five days. But that's the first
1544.60s:  access to good short deltas that I see. I would come in here and I would just sell calls.
1550.44s:  Now there's different ways to structure that kind of trade. But that would be an easy one to start
1557.88s:  with. And it's even on this list, just a little bit further down. Let me re-ord this.
1565.40s:  Now let's take a look at T dock. So T dock is another one that I like to the downside.
1573.72s:  This one would be set something like here with a stop at like 827 or above, really above.
1582.68s:  827 is where I'd want to be getting out. But this one is a little more open. I can either sell calls
1589.56s:  in here because I can still see it has variance risk premiums. So that's mostly going to apply to
1595.32s:  the puts. But you'll probably see it on the call side as well here. And or we could take a look at
1601.32s:  structuring some sort of diagonal. Now it has a lot of calls, which is slightly bullish in tenor.
1609.56s:  But let's take a look at what these puts look like. I don't love them.
1614.04s:  I don't love the liquidity here. But you notice how these at the money calls, they're at a 23 delta.
1622.84s:  So the market is really pricing in the downside. The market is heavily, heavily expecting this not
1627.96s:  to break up towards ten, but definitely even down towards five. It kind of likes it. I don't want to
1634.60s:  say it likes it more, but it likes it enough that that's an interesting move, right? So what I'm
1640.84s:  looking at here, these two columns, this is probability of in the money, probability of a touch,
1645.40s:  the probability of touching ten in this product right now is 33% against a 44% probability of hitting five.
1652.84s:  So this looks absolutely right to the downside. Now again, to trade it via short calls, this
1659.08s:  would be fine. Something that's like right at the money. You'd have to put on a million of them
1663.72s:  because it's only ten bucks and you're going to get like 23, 24 dollars, but you could put on a
1667.24s:  bunch of them or you could find some puts to get into, but these aren't liquid enough. So this is
1675.08s:  just an example on why I would probably also sell calls on this for the downside place. So let's
1681.48s:  two downside trades that we found in just a matter of minutes, really. And depending on how many we
1689.64s:  would want for the portfolio, this is exactly how the process would go, but I'm going to take a break
1694.12s:  and take a look at what you guys are seeing. Anthony says consumer discretionary is middle class
1699.32s:  consumer spending, higher percent of income and rental insurance, less discretionary funds to do
1703.56s:  things outside the essential. Yeah, I completely agree with that. And I think that
1712.20s:  in the kind of market that we have now, it doesn't surprise me literally whatsoever to see
1718.92s:  discretionary struggling here, like literally at all, I think it completely checks out.
1724.68s:  ActShot says 5% is applicable to ETS because 5% drops in stock is common. It's not necessary. I'm
1732.76s:  not necessarily trying to bifurcate it like that when I was searching for 5% downside in that context
1738.28s:  is because I specifically was just looking for things that have clearly shown downside weakness
1745.24s:  on the year. So I wanted stuff that wasn't just negative over the last 252 trading days, but I
1751.24s:  wanted stuff that was posting negative returns because there's a propensity for momentum even to
1756.28s:  the downside. And again, that's why I don't want to look for things that are at extremes because
1761.64s:  a reversal is very likely. I want to find stuff that's just slowly grinding lower. That becomes a
1769.24s:  really attractive trade for me. So that's the idea.
1772.60s:  We have mango orange in the house. I like the mango orange lot. It's probably my favorite spin
1787.72s:  drift. Ryan says, do you have any vid? I got a ton of vids. Let me be honest with you. Do you
1795.32s:  have any vids going over how you use unusual whale specifically for options? Not yet. That's
1800.92s:  something we could do at some point. But I don't have anything yet. Ryan says like when you see
1808.92s:  bid and mids or structured plays, it can be hard to see they give real definitions, but it's hard
1815.72s:  to read the possible play. Yeah. So a couple of things when you're using options in general like that
1822.04s:  is regardless if it's unusual whales or just TNS time and sales. The first thing is if you have
1828.28s:  stuff that's at the midpoint, you can make a guess. So for example, this 110 call 17 Jan got filled
1836.84s:  at 89 cents. The market was 83 by 90. So do I think that this was likely bought or sold? I would lean
1846.28s:  towards it being bought because it's one penny off the offer and it's several pennies off six of
1854.68s:  them from the bid. So I would just innately assume that this was more likely
1862.68s:  bought than sold. Now another really important thing for everybody to understand is that none of
1869.56s:  this is concrete. Literally none of this. So when the market shows this green for buying and
1877.48s:  this red for selling, they're still guessing. It's not certain. It's very close to certain,
1884.20s:  but it's not certain. And I think it's important to understand that. So when this is showing the
1890.12s:  market at a penny by 23 and we see the trade coming out of penny, you can be pretty certain that
1897.56s:  this happened at the bid, but it's not a direct like we don't know that for certain. There's not
1904.84s:  like a print that tells us that's what happened. We're making assumption based on where the market
1911.24s:  is and where the trade was. I just think it's really important for people to understand that even
1915.32s:  when you see the coloring here, that the platforms are still making an assumption. So that's that part.
1923.40s:  Now the other component that I think for Ryan, it's important to understand is at least for me,
1931.00s:  I don't care about spreads. So you'll notice that I essentially get rid of spreads almost always.
1937.64s:  They don't mean enough to me in this context. Now you can lose some trades that would come through
1944.20s:  by spreads that could still be informative if they're large enough. But in general, I simplify it.
1952.28s:  I'm looking for things that are really displaying some specific strong conviction.
1959.40s:  So I much much much prefer single options for that use case. So that's why I will filter out
1967.56s:  essentially the spreads. So same thing in unusual whales. The mid you can essentially just drop it off.
1974.92s:  Again, you can leave it on there if you want and kind of see where people are transacting around
1980.20s:  to have an idea. So like this mid, let's see, this came in at 90 cents.
1985.64s:  But see, like this is just another interesting example. This got flagged at the mid because there
1991.72s:  was multiple trades that came in with this. But it came in at an average of 90 cents. The market was
1996.60s:  90 by 92. So even though this is flagging it as a mid because of the multiple transactions,
2003.08s:  you could still probably make a guess that these came in at the bid, meaning that they were sales.
2007.88s:  But again, we don't know for certain. And it's always important to remind yourself of that in the
2013.32s:  beginning because we don't know yet. So yeah, I'm trying to see other interesting examples.
2020.52s:  This one's super weird up here. Where was it? The wait, worth, no, nevermind. So this one,
2029.00s:  right? So this is like dead set mid. You have no idea and you can't know. So something like this
2035.00s:  495 by 515, if it's like dead set mid, you have no idea. And it's just not even worth your time
2042.60s:  trying to guess unless there's other, unless this was like a massive trade up, this was like a
2047.56s:  $2 million trade, which it wouldn't come in at the mid. That's kind of the cool point. The cool part,
2053.32s:  that was a mix of point and part. The cool part is that larger trades, they don't come in at the
2059.88s:  mid. They're too big. They push the market. So you can still, if it's a big enough trade,
2064.20s:  it's naturally going to trend towards one direction or the other. So it kind of makes it a little
2069.64s:  simpler actually to find. So this one's 475. And again, this one's dead set mid, nothing to
2076.84s:  derive from that. So yeah, typically you can just kill the mids off. Because the other thing to
2082.84s:  keep in mind is from a psychological perspective, if I'm trying to transact at the mid, I'm not in any
2089.24s:  sort of big rush to put the trade on. It means I'm trying to get a good fill. I'm trying to play
2093.32s:  the field a little bit. Whereas if you have people that are coming in at the bid or the ask,
2099.88s:  it means one, again, they're probably moving size two, they're trying to get a fill. So you can,
2107.16s:  again, come up with some reasonable estimations, but reiterate, we don't know for certain. It's
2115.40s:  an estimation. So hopefully that answers your question.
2122.04s:  Ruta Begas says, I read something about selling poor man covered calls. If you can't afford
2127.40s:  that many shares, seem too good to be true. But what do I know? I don't know. I would need more
2134.28s:  context. Happy to take a look at it and explore that with you. But and I assume when you say
2142.04s:  selling poor man covered calls, you mean buying the options and then selling calls against it.
2148.52s:  That's essentially the, what I do, which is called a ratio diagonal. I don't like the colloquial
2156.36s:  names for things. I really prefer the technical terms. It's just I guess me being annoying. But
2162.28s:  that sounds like you're looking at ratio diagonals. So let me throw a link to that for you.
2168.76s:  There. But yeah, the ratio diagonals are a good strategy. Poor man covered call,
2176.04s:  whatever you want to call it. But it's probably not too good to be true. You probably just need
2182.92s:  to understand the position more because there's drawbacks. There's a series of drawbacks when you're
2188.68s:  trading something like a ratio diagonal. So especially the way that I trade them. Again,
2193.96s:  when I'm saying ratio, the diagonal, that's the same as what they're referring to,
2199.24s:  which is the poor man's covered call. Now, the cool part about a ratio called the
2202.52s:  agnol, I can put it on the call or the put side. The poor man's covered call typically
2208.76s:  applies to the call side. But long call diagonal debit spread. Yeah, exactly. Yep. I'm following you.
2219.00s:  So yeah, the strategy itself is pretty good. I mean, when you say seem too good to be true,
2226.60s:  what element of it seemed too good to be true to you. And then the mean time gravitaris is when
2231.80s:  you say sell calls, would those be covered calls? Not necessarily no. So in the context like here,
2238.60s:  like we're looking at fading, what was it? T-dock. So if we're talking about fading T-dock,
2245.16s:  I would just be selling calls. So I would go out, I don't like the 14 DTE that's a little too
2251.32s:  close to I probably do 49, which is a little too far. But it's like, what is that fucking that little
2258.52s:  lady and the in the porridge and she rat fucked all the bears food because she's selfish. She's a
2265.56s:  tell report. Who the hell was that? What's that story? There's that stupid girl that goes in
2272.44s:  to the to the bears food and she fucks up all their food because she's selfish. She's trying
2277.00s:  to find the perfect one, Goldilocks. Yeah, yo, she sucks hate her. But with like the I literally
2288.84s:  forgot even how Goldilocks came into this equation. Why was I talking about Goldilocks? I literally
2295.40s:  just got blinded by rage towards her. Anyways, for short calls, oh, yeah, I was looking for Goldilocks
2302.28s:  scenario. That's what it was. So yeah, exactly. Gravitaris is too far too close. It's exactly,
2308.52s:  thank you. I was thinking about Goldilocks. That's funny that I had the idea. All right, so let me
2314.28s:  take a look at selling one of these and then we can plot it. Now again, this is the,
2324.04s:  the risk profile and this is my pass through account. The reason why I mentioned that it's the
2329.72s:  pass through account is because it has no money in it. But two, because it's regulation T margin,
2336.92s:  whereas my typical trading account is portfolio margin. I think this is more applicable to people.
2343.40s:  So the margin to put on these short calls is $123.50. And then if it's
2353.08s:  starts going against us, it expands to like $350. Tree Fitty, like that lockness monster. So
2360.52s:  it's a really good return. So in this case, what I would be doing is literally just selling the
2366.28s:  calls. Zach says so is this buying a call on the same stock? Never understood what Porman cover
2372.04s:  call ratio diagonal is. Check out that video up above. The video up above will get you
2377.08s:  schooled up super fast on what the diagonals are. But it's typically same side. So a Cliff
2384.28s:  Notes version, which is actually what I'm running right now on CrowdStrike.
2390.92s:  And I closed it out today. But what I do is I like to go further out in time, typically greater than
2397.24s:  60 days. And then if I want to trade it to the downside, I'll look at the puts, I'll find puts
2402.44s:  that are reasonably bit asked spread. So like these 77s, look at me 4810 by 4935. So about 1.2
2412.84s:  and a half. That's okay. So I would come in here, look at snag in some of these. So let's say we
2420.84s:  start with buying five of those. And then you can sell puts against it. So then I would go further
2428.28s:  out of the money, maybe something like these two hundies analyze this, maybe sell like two of
2435.24s:  those to really favor the downside. And that is a ratio put diagonal. I have long, I have long puts,
2443.64s:  short puts more long puts than short puts, hence the ratio. And the idea here is to try and capitalize
2452.92s:  on the downside move while still collecting some premium from these short calls against the long
2461.00s:  options that were purchased. So that's that. All right, let's pivot back over now quickly. Actually,
2469.72s:  this is perfect. This is talking about structuring trades. So what I would love now is if you guys
2476.84s:  have trades that you're looking at anything that you have on that you want to have on or just stuff
2483.08s:  you're interested in, we can take a look at some names and just come up with an analysis. We can
2489.32s:  or go the portfolio fit component. And then we can just talk about structuring trades.
2495.08s:  Spicy avocado says wouldn't it be better just to pick one and go with it?
2498.92s:  Not necessarily. No. Now it depends again on what we're looking at, which is if it's something
2508.44s:  that you really want to trade to the downside, you absolutely can just sell puts. But there's a
2513.40s:  few things that come into play. It's that like if we know where something is going to go, then there's
2519.08s:  a easy equation. But I don't know where shit's going to go. I'm actually wrong all the day I'm
2526.12s:  time on where I think things may or may not go. So the idea is to scrub off some directional risk.
2534.04s:  It's some delta hedging. But more importantly, it's to help the position because here's the downside
2541.00s:  to using options. If I take a look at this 18 oct trade and I go here, I'm losing eight dollars
2547.72s:  a day from theta decay, even though that these are far out in time and pretty far in the money,
2556.12s:  they still suffer from theta decay. So by selling options against it, I'm also offsetting
2565.48s:  some of the Greeks impact. And in this case, theta is a big one. So in the trade that I put on,
2573.16s:  which was what short the 200s, I'm essentially collecting $300 per contract. So if we take a look at
2582.36s:  this, these are giving me 24 cents of theta each day. So even though I have five long options
2593.08s:  that are losing eight dollars a day, I now have two options that are gaining $24 a day each.
2604.68s:  So I'm able to offset my theta decay for the long options. So it's just another way to look at it.
2613.16s:  But to your point, there's absolutely nothing wrong at all with just using one. Like if I have a really
2626.44s:  strong directional conviction, either I'll sell it at a very light ratio or I just won't sell it
2635.08s:  at all. Another thing I like to do is leg into them. So I'll put on the base position first. That's
2640.68s:  exactly what I did in CrowdStrike is I put the base position on as we broke out here.
2646.92s:  And then I chose to sell puts when it started slowing down. So here. And then I ended up having
2654.44s:  to roll the puts because we had a pretty big move against. So I wanted to keep them out of the money.
2661.72s:  But the short puts were literally, it was that essentially for every 10 longs, I had one
2669.48s:  short put against it. So there's a lot of different ways you can set it up.
2676.52s:  All right, back up to you guys.
2684.68s:  Arjun says poor man's covered call is usually one to one and not a ratio. Yeah, exactly. So that's
2689.56s:  what makes it a quote unquote covered call. Now that's the downside, right? There's a reason,
2695.72s:  there's a very specific reason why I like the ratio diagonal much more than a standard diagonal.
2701.96s:  So let's take a look at a standard diagonal, which is typically buying the at the money.
2708.68s:  Let's turn these off. And then selling something that's further out of the money. Now we can
2716.28s:  modify it a little bit too. We can slide that option a little bit further in the money.
2720.52s:  Let me take this a little further in. Oh, I did the same expiration. Some an idiot. My bad.
2730.20s:  I was wondering why that looks so squirrely.
2737.80s:  So this is what a diagonal often will look like. And sometimes they'll even have risk to the other
2744.28s:  side. The reason why it doesn't now is just because this has had such a crazy move. The options
2748.68s:  are priced pretty crazily. So looking at something like this, you can let me take a look at like a
2757.88s:  standard diagonal. But anyways, this is what a normal diagonal. You see it's like very peaky.
2762.68s:  And then it'll have either defined profit or it'll actually have risk eventually in the direction
2769.32s:  that you want it to go, which is super, super annoying. It's a big problem with them. It's
2774.76s:  actually why I set these trades up the way that I do. Let's take a look at Apple.
2780.76s:  Apple's still looking pretty normal. And then let's build a quick trade in here. Same structure.
2786.92s:  So let's do long these. And let's do like the 50 delta something that's like just slightly in the money.
2797.56s:  And then let's sell something near term that's out of the money, kind of like right out of the
2802.92s:  money like these 35s. So in this scenario, what I'm doing is I'm being very careful about the delta
2810.92s:  selection to make sure that I don't have risk in the same direction. Now what it looks like for a
2817.16s:  standard diagonal, if you're using the same strike. So let's use instead of the long slightly in
2823.88s:  the money. Let's do like these 220 something closer to add the money or even slightly out of the money.
2829.40s:  Turn this off. You notice you actually have upside or in this case, downside risk. So even if
2835.16s:  you get a big price accommodation, it can move it literally can move too far in your favor. And
2840.36s:  this is a big problem with diagonals as kind of they're traditionally structured. And this is
2845.56s:  still giving it a five five point spread between them. So I don't like diagonals a ton. That's
2853.56s:  specifically why I trade ratio diagonals. And I set them up the way I do because one, I don't want
2860.12s:  to have capped profit potential. And two, I don't want to be penalized if something moves massively in
2867.16s:  my favor. I don't want to be too right. There's so many ways to be wrong in trading to be wrong because
2873.72s:  your two right is literally just offensive. So that's why I set those up the way that I do.
2884.60s:  Let me know if that answers. Well, I guess you didn't even ask a question. I kind of just talked
2887.80s:  about the structure. Rika says, could you analyze and video? Yeah, see you look at Nvidia.
2894.28s:  All right, what do we think? On a six month basis still trending up. One month basis still
2907.48s:  trending up pretty strong. Three month basis trending up but flattening down.
2914.60s:  One month basis. And we are negative. We are downward sloping standard deviation channels are going
2928.60s:  down. So when I look at this, this literally right here is actually kind of the initial eyeball spot I
2938.84s:  see. And the way I look at it is I want to see what it does in that level. If it starts breaking up
2948.92s:  above this, I'm still not necessarily massively bullish until it starts breaking above these here.
2956.44s:  And then eventually this here. So if I wanted to trade it to the upside if I had a long thesis,
2964.20s:  I would probably trade via short puts, something I can manage or something I can kind of be
2969.40s:  slightly wrong and still make money. And then if it breaks down below this, again, I personally
2975.08s:  wouldn't want a short Nvidia. But if I did, you can either run short calls or like a ratio put
2982.92s:  diagonal, both of those are viable. And then the near term profit target for something like that or
2988.12s:  near term price target would be something around like 91.5 down towards this point of control.
2993.88s:  Something like this. That is generally what I see. Now from an options perspective,
3009.96s:  I still see bullish drift priced in. So 14.9 million calls against 14.3 million puts.
3018.52s:  So definitely more calls wanting to be traded here. And if I take a look at the implied
3026.92s:  vol for the out of the monies. And then let's clear off those and take a look at these. So it's
3036.76s:  all downside risk. Really, that's being priced in not much upside.
3040.76s:  So yeah, I mean, that's the cliff notes version. I essentially want to see how this works.
3049.72s:  All right.
3053.00s:  Rama, Rama Lama says, I think people on here myself included don't have the ability to sell naked
3057.88s:  options. Some of the strategies don't make sense at first because we didn't even have access
3061.40s:  to the trade mechanism. You still do. Again, like I don't play the victim. It's a bad mindset.
3068.12s:  If you can't trade naked short calls because of permissions, just by the way, just go super far
3073.96s:  out of the money. So if I'm trading something like, let's find, what the hell are we just looking
3084.28s:  at that we like to the downside? Some of the tea is from here. Where are you at? Teedock.
3092.76s:  Teedock. So if you want to trade this to the downside and you can't literally just
3098.04s:  go in there by that and then buy a really far out of the money wing by like a 20 delta wing.
3103.24s:  So you're not going to chew up a bunch of the credit that you're going to receive. And you
3108.36s:  essentially still get the same exposure, which is looking at a short call vertical.
3116.84s:  So yeah, that's we all start with smaller accounts and you have to be thrifty and you know,
3123.08s:  essentially structure stuff a little bit differently, but this is a completely viable way to do it.
3128.92s:  The downside here is the margin requirement is much greater because it's now just calculating
3134.68s:  based on the width of the wings. So you might have to slide this in a little bit more and eat a
3139.64s:  little more of your lunch. So you go from 20 cents to 19 cents if you got a fill. So you're losing
3144.68s:  a penny, but you cut your margin requirement in half. Ideally, again, we would just use single
3149.96s:  options, but to your point, not everybody has access to them right away. And you just essentially
3155.40s:  have to get a little more creative. But yeah, you can literally just do something like the like by the wings.
3166.44s:  Ryan says, just want to shout out to you. Happy to be here. I'm happy to have you here. That's
3170.36s:  awesome. I'm glad that it's useful. Reese says, why do we have upside risk if we have the long call?
3176.04s:  It's a great question. And it has everything to do with the way that options behave and the way
3183.96s:  that gamma behaves. So essentially in the scenario that we're looking at before, which was I already
3192.44s:  forgot what that one was in. Was it CrouchStrike? Maybe something like this.
3204.36s:  No, that's my version. Let's see if we can structure one real fast. Let's do like the at the
3211.16s:  monies. So the, oh, I forgot, you literally, I think you can do it with like one click with this
3217.40s:  yeah, buy the Agnol. There it goes. So what is this doing? It's buying, no, I want to do the other way.
3229.32s:  Sell Agnol. Literally never use this. It's 20 set. In the October, I don't like that one. All right,
3241.48s:  I'm going to just build it myself. I don't like what they're doing. The 20 there.
3245.24s:  Typically, they would be closer in explorations as well, but that's okay. And then the 220 here.
3255.08s:  So it's more of a calendar spread. But this is like a very, I think that's more what we were kind
3264.04s:  of talking about, not necessarily the standard diagonal. The reason why is just because it's the same
3271.88s:  strike, by the way. So like if I do the instead of buying the 220s, and instead I sell like the 215s
3280.92s:  and grab the 220s, that's a diagonal. And notice how it has upside risk. So the reason why this has
3289.00s:  upside risk is because what ends up happening is as the underlying moves, the short deltas move
3299.56s:  fast enough to overwhelm the long deltas. So it creates a scenario where the underlying itself
3311.88s:  literally can move too far in your favor. Once your deltas essentially approximate to whatever
3320.76s:  their maximum variance is going to be. And a lot of that is based on the gamma.
3326.12s:  So you'll notice that if you look at the 20 set, the gamma here is a one gamma.
3334.04s:  Here, if you look at the 16-og, it's a two gamma. So that means that if this starts moving too
3341.80s:  fast or too much in your favor, the gamma is going to pile on to these deltas. And sooner or later,
3347.72s:  you'll literally have more opposing deltas than you would have started. Reese says that's been driving
3355.80s:  me nuts. Thank you. Yeah, you got it. Easy one. No problem. Take guys all the time. I got to be
3361.08s:  honest. Like when we're talking about the game stop stuff, as you could tell, I'm very much a student
3366.12s:  because I don't know a lot there and I'm learning a lot. But when it comes to options, I'm still a
3371.16s:  student, but I know a lot. I've been doing options for so fucking long now that most of this stuff is
3376.92s:  kind of just back at the napkin. So yeah, that's an easy one. No problem.
3385.80s:  Ukraine says, is it better to buy options to close to them? Oh, that fucked me up. That's funny.
3394.68s:  I was reading as buy to close. So Ukraine says, is it better to buy options close to the money or
3400.52s:  out of the money? It's a great question. And I've actually made a video recently with GameStop,
3406.68s:  as I think that somebody's chagrin. I don't know if I'm allowed to say that because I think somebody
3410.76s:  said they don't want to hear it, but you know, too fucking bad. But I have a video. This will be for
3417.08s:  you, Ukraine, which is about buying call options smarter. Like I said, I use GameStop as the context
3424.52s:  for the video because I know a lot of people that trade GameStop are buying options. And the goal
3430.76s:  of that video is to try to help them out a little bit instead of just lighting their money on fire
3435.16s:  perpetually. But the video applies to anything. And the answer to that really, it depends on what
3444.20s:  you're trying to accomplish with the position. So there's different ways you can structure it. So
3449.00s:  that video will literally walk you through it in depth. It goes through how to pick expiration
3454.04s:  cycle, how to pick Delta, all those kinds of things. So should be, should be good.
3463.88s:  Oxhot says in a broken wing butterfly, how does penal change when the underlying approaches the
3468.76s:  strikes? Will the profit increase first and then decrease or loss increases all throughout?
3474.28s:  If you model, if you let me know the exact trade that you want me to look at, we can look at it
3477.56s:  together. But a lot of that P&L behavior is going to depend heavily on what you pick. So
3484.84s:  if you outline the trade that you want me to look at, we can take a look at it together.
3490.68s:  And then in the meantime, we still have a few minutes left. So if there's anything else that you
3497.72s:  guys just want to generally talk about, let's let's dive in. In the meantime, I'm going to get my
3503.72s:  dinner order ready and launched. Tonight is going to be Mexican food. We're going to hit a carne
3508.84s:  asado burrito and then a pollo asado quesadilla. Although I have to be honest with you, I really like
3517.40s:  saying quesadilla. I don't know if that's just me, but quesadilla is just a much more fun way to frame
3524.60s:  it. So yeah, let me know what you guys want to talk about. In the meantime, I'm going to grab this
3533.72s:  and I like going through this because I think this is like really, really useful to understand
3541.96s:  what other people are doing and how other traders operate. There's a big reason for those that
3548.20s:  don't know. I've always referred to us as the outlier community, even when like the branding
3553.80s:  overall was ES invests, which ES is just my initials. It the way that this whole platform YouTube
3560.76s:  channel that stuff started was just like I was sharing information with my friends that were
3564.92s:  in the military during COVID. Long story short, the community grew, which is awesome, but I've
3571.72s:  always referred to this as the outlier community because that's what I pursue as an individual's
3578.60s:  outlier performance. Okay, so that ties to this because this is a great example of normal people
3585.88s:  performance. This is a great example of how normal people look at markets and realistically,
3592.04s:  how you probably should not look at markets. So I actually think it's fun to poke through this
3598.36s:  from time to time to use as examples for us to talk through. Ukraine says, what are your thoughts
3608.68s:  on spy in terms of what? It's an index. It's got options. It's pulling back. Those are the initial
3618.52s:  thoughts. I mean, it fell right down through this volume gap, right? Like there's no volume here
3625.80s:  to support it. And I mean, it just dropped right through it. And now it looks like it's entering
3630.20s:  another volume node. The next volume node is literally right here. You can see it right there.
3634.84s:  And that's where it's hanging out. So to me, if it starts breaking below that,
3640.04s:  then it looks like it's going to want to go somewhere down here to like 523, something like that.
3645.96s:  But I think the market right now is very, very, very driven by news, very driven by news. So if
3652.12s:  we have some sort of advantageous market data come out, then I think it will be favorable. I think
3662.04s:  the S&P 500 will shrug it right off. If that doesn't happen, then I think the S&P 500 probably
3668.04s:  likes the downside here. And then let me grab the New York Stock Exchange really quick.
3673.72s:  Yeah. So even the New York Stock Exchange is starting to rotate down, right? So gross lows is
3680.36s:  expanding. Gross highs is contracting. And net highs lows is declining. So this is even in the New
3687.88s:  York Stock Exchange starting to want to rotate down. So yeah, that looks pretty rough.
3699.16s:  Colonel says, can you look at Intel had bad news all over leading to earnings? Let's see.
3706.44s:  I'm in TC. Yeah. It's terrible. Let me see. I had Intel on my watch list, but I don't think I
3714.92s:  traded it. I didn't for earnings. Why did I not?
3729.24s:  Let me look really quick.
3733.64s:  I had it on my no go list. Oh, that's why. Just because the head weight to many previous beats,
3740.04s:  so one, two, three, four, five, six literally six out of the past eight had been negative beats,
3750.04s:  meaning realize vol exceeded implied. So that's just no good from a vol selling perspective.
3756.28s:  So that's why I didn't trade it. But I mean, from here, it's completely different though. You can
3764.44s:  trade downside drift in something like Intel. I think that's okay, especially with how bad the
3769.80s:  miss was. But I also think that it was really broadly supported by a lot of buy volume today.
3775.16s:  A ton of buy volume literally 68% buy volume. So I don't necessarily think that the market hates
3782.28s:  it down here and it looks like people are kind of scooping it up and droves. So for me, this would
3788.36s:  be nothing yet. I would want to see at least another day or two to see how it performs. The thing
3793.96s:  that you'll notice about my approach to trading is very rarely am I trying to top tick or bottom tick
3798.76s:  things. I don't care to catch things at like the perfect time. I want to put on stuff that
3805.88s:  generally shows strength so that there's a higher probability of it doing what I want it to do.
3812.20s:  That's the idea. So in this kind of scenario, like I just had a big down move. I would favor it to
3819.56s:  the downside. I wouldn't be opposed to trading something like short puts because I know Voles
3823.72s:  can be really high. If it starts to base and show strength, like this kind of scenario is great
3829.88s:  for selling short puts, right? So you could see drop down drifted south. Ever so slightly started
3837.48s:  to look okay. And then it's just come off a cliff. So it wouldn't surprise me if essentially this
3843.40s:  next quarter looked a lot like this past quarter. Like that. I don't think is too crazy. But in order
3848.92s:  for me to do anything in it personally, I would need to see another couple days. I'm not trying to
3853.72s:  catch it right at the turn. It's just a really tough way to trade. That's generally going to run
3860.12s:  unsuccessful in my opinion. Oh, Cliffs says what platform broker. This is think or swim, which is
3868.60s:  through Schwab. Ram Alama says, could you elaborate a little more on the wide wings for selling calls,
3878.84s:  synthetic short strangle by doing an odd core? Yeah, what about it? When you say Mr. Lama,
3886.84s:  let me know what you want to talk about specifically there. And I'm happy to. But yeah, that's
3891.16s:  that's like a really common approach for smaller accounts is to just add the longer wings. The other
3898.36s:  thing sometimes is I'll do it literally just for risk control. If I'm trading something that I have
3903.88s:  some sort of fear that it might run to the upside and not come back also calls against or I'll buy
3910.84s:  calls again short calls that are further out of the money. No problem. I just keep it to an absolute
3915.80s:  minimum. It's very seldom that I'll do that because I'm typically going to lean more heavily on
3920.36s:  just managing the trade. But that's definitely not outside something I would do. It's completely
3927.24s:  reasonable actually in my opinion. And it's a smarter way, I think, to build positions into trade.
3935.00s:  But yeah, Ram Alama, if you let me know specifically what you want me to elaborate on with respect to
3940.52s:  that, I'm more than happy to. I see. Ramas says, it seems like the golden egg being able to manage
3948.28s:  an execute naked call put selling. Yeah. Okay. So you're asking more for the trade off. And the
3953.32s:  trade off is very clear. Vertical spreads typically are negatively expectant by their structure.
3959.96s:  I'll literally grab my calculator and I'll show you. Let's take a look at a vertical spread in here.
3969.00s:  Let's do like 49 days. Ram Alama, what do we want to do? Do we want to do a short or long vertical
3976.12s:  spread? And we want to do a call or put dealers choice. You tell me I'm here to accommodate you.
3986.12s:  Whatever makes you happy makes me happy. Also, fun fact, if any of you guys know anything about Alaska,
3993.96s:  specifically like Anchorage, Seward area, anything like that, I would love to hear about it.
4001.80s:  I'm trying to turn off this freaking iPad, but Siri keeps listening to me sketchy.
4007.32s:  Siri's a little sketchy. Short call. Got it. So first, let's take a look at a short call spread.
4013.24s:  So what I need to do is grab where is my spread over here.
4026.12s:  So what I'm doing is I'm dropping this in a calculator for me.
4031.72s:  And let's see. So our strike width is going to be $1.
4042.04s:  The probability of profit from the time of entry. So the probability of this being in the money
4049.56s:  is 43%. So we have like a 57% probability of profit, 57.
4056.04s:  The credit received here is 39 cents.
4062.84s:  Wait, 39. We're going to plan on keeping the whole profit. We're not going to have any sort of stop.
4070.20s:  And we're not going to have a stop. So the neutral credit in order for this to be like a
4081.00s:  neutrally expectant strategy is 43 cents based on these probabilities.
4087.24s:  So the moment you enter this trade, you're coming in with negative edge.
4093.56s:  So that's just a $1 wide vertical spread. Now it gets better if it's wider. So let's do a $5 wide.
4101.32s:  Let's do, oh, shit, click the wrong thing, my bad. There we go. So now let's look at a $5 wide.
4108.52s:  And then the probability of making this $1.15 is same there. This is getting $1.15.
4129.88s:  So this is still woefully underpaid. Very, very underpaid. So that's the main problem when you add
4142.60s:  verticals is you're overpaying for the thing that you're selling or over not getting enough for
4151.96s:  what you're selling if you're buying. That's that's kind of the nature of options. So the other problem
4159.24s:  with it is you give up a lot of your potential profit. Again, there's a positive, right? You're
4165.24s:  capturing and you're managing your risk, which that's the thing about trading is that it's a
4169.96s:  series of trade-offs so that you can structure things exactly how you want it. So in this case,
4177.64s:  when we have this kind of vertical,
4180.76s:  you can see these are all messed up. That's weird. Let me just do like plus or minus one
4194.84s:  steering deviation. So you can see that this has had like a really high probability of profit.
4201.48s:  But the problem is is you're trying to make $1.15 while risking $3.85. So you need to win a lot of
4209.48s:  these in order to be able to handle a single loss, right? So in this case, you can see the initial
4218.28s:  problem if you're not correct directionally. Okay, so Oxshot says broken wing butterfly. All right,
4226.52s:  let's take a look. But let me know if that answers some of your question Lama on like why like the
4233.96s:  trade-off because that's all it is. That's not to say that verticals are terrible. I don't like them
4237.48s:  in general because I just think it's better to move past them as fast as you can. But like they're
4241.80s:  not going to break anything. That's kind of the cool part about verticals is that they move slow.
4250.28s:  So you're not necessarily going to break any records to the upside. And it's not going to be
4256.92s:  terrible to the downside. I just realized really quick. I have like two minutes left to double dash.
4264.36s:  And you boy needs we need some milk, man. Give me one second before this runs out. What kind of milk
4271.88s:  do you guys like? I am a whole milk kind of guy. I feel like that's less common now though. I feel
4281.64s:  like people are like really, really. Well, that's cool. They have like a strapped family cream
4289.72s:  ain't never heard of that. Let's grab that. Whole milk spicy avocado. I respect your game.
4299.96s:  I feel like that's the right. I feel like that's the right go. Keto-minded. I see. I like it.
4306.44s:  Ox shot is going for the balance 2%. That's good. I think that's fair to want to balance it out
4315.40s:  a little bit. I feel like I'm just a little bit more reckless than that. And I don't actually care.
4326.12s:  All right. So I got what I need. Let me get this milk order off.
4339.16s:  Yo, this fucking the Strauss family creamery organic whole milk. It's half a gallon for $7.
4346.04s:  They are not playing no games.
4353.24s:  All right. That's that was a must. Thanks for hanging in there because
4359.24s:  milk is like my lifeblood. So if I was going to have Mexican food without milk, I don't know what
4363.40s:  I was going to do. It was going to be a big problem. Big, big problem.
4367.72s:  All right. So back up to this butterfly. Let's take a look. You're looking at five
4375.72s:  aug, which I don't love because it's really short term. And you're looking at grabbing.
4387.08s:  What what options do you want to use? You have to tell me if you want to use calls or puts.
4391.96s:  Because I want to put on like exactly what you're trying to have me put on.
4399.56s:  So I see. Okay. So you're doing call side. Got it. So we're going to buy the 5380.
4406.68s:  A key. All right. I got to hand up. Oh.
4411.96s:  Oh.
4416.92s:  I tell you what the Ram Alama. Thank you very much for that $9.99. That will cover my
4424.76s:  egregiously overpriced milk. So thank you very much. I very much appreciate that.
4430.68s:  Very kind of you. But let me see. Oh, man. That's
4436.68s:  a good thing. So we're going to buy that cell two of these grab one of these 95s.
4447.88s:  Okay. So this one, this is an interesting structure. The way you're doing it.
4454.44s:  So you can see the piano graph exactly how it would behave here. So essentially this will
4462.52s:  make 90 bucks. And it will continue to try to make 90 bucks up until essentially it hits
4471.32s:  53 78 and a half. And then peak profit is what like 543 at 53 85 or 53 84 and a half. But it's
4484.84s:  essentially going to be right centered on that strike. So it should be 85 would be the best. Yeah.
4489.40s:  So it's like 588 there. The graph just isn't perfect. So max profit obviously would be at the
4494.60s:  center strike. And then we have max loss is 410 and you start to fall into a loss at.
4507.64s:  Let me see. Let me assume this will be a little easier. And point it.
4511.48s:  Let's call it 53 90 86 something like that 53 90 86. So what's the probability of hitting 53 90 86
4528.28s:  535 535 535 535.
4535.88s:  So the probability of that being in the money above that that 53 90 86 is like 35 36%
4551.00s:  So 36 36% probability profit of expiring as of now. But let's see what the probability of a touch is
4560.20s:  53 90 70% probability of a touch. The reason why I think it's so important to always remember I
4571.32s:  much prefer using probability of a touch versus probability of things being in the money. Because
4576.36s:  you have to remember the probability that you set is at the time of entry. And the probability
4582.84s:  that's realized is going to change based on how the underlying moves. So it's kind of a really
4591.64s:  really important differentiation to make right because if you use probability of being in the money
4599.24s:  that will be whatever number it is at the beginning of the trade. But then as the trade starts to move
4604.04s:  that's going to change in the probability of touch in my opinion is a much more conservative metric.
4609.80s:  Rory Tittie says what's probability of a touch great question that simply means what is the
4614.36s:  probability of price getting to that level before expiration. So probability of in the money is the
4620.44s:  probability of an option expiring in the money at the time of entry, you know, using current vol.
4626.20s:  Then the probability of touch is what is the probability that the price of the underlying touches a point
4632.84s:  gets to a certain point. That's probability of a touch, which is a really important metric,
4638.68s:  especially if you're doing anything that includes managing a trade.
4643.88s:  To another giant mistake people make.
4647.88s:  Zach says so good touch not a bad touch. It depends on what kind of touch you like, right? Maybe you
4653.64s:  like a nice consensual light touch or nice consensual rough touch or hard or soft touch. It depends
4663.08s:  on the touch. Who am I who am I to say what kind of touch you as a person like, but it depends on
4669.48s:  the kind of touch because this could be a bad touch or it could be a good touch. Good or bad touch
4676.04s:  is as they say in the eye of the holder. That's what I say.
4683.32s:  Ox shot says thanks for answering of course. Happy to absolutely happy to
4690.12s:  anything else you guys want to hit. I still got like a few more minutes. We can kind of dance
4695.72s:  around to whatever whatever you'd like. Oculus is depends on the toucher. I think that's also a fair
4704.84s:  a fair a fair cop. Zach says Mara. We could take a look at Mara. I don't really have an opinion on this.
4720.84s:  I mean it has vol. That's what I see. Like I would want to trade vol.
4727.24s:  Right. It still has a lot of vol.
4733.88s:  It was down 5% today earnings. It was estimated at losing 23 cents. It lost 72 so not good.
4742.68s:  So this would also be a candidate for kind of a downside drift play for me. But I would
4748.52s:  primarily do it through something like short calls. Great. This bad boy to the downside.
4755.56s:  And what would that look like? Yeah. I mean you get paid a ton right now.
4771.48s:  But this is one that you would either have to manage very closely or I would
4777.08s:  spread it off because this thing can grab legs. But it doesn't look like it looks like it's
4782.28s:  been struggling. But again, like this is a great example. This ran from 19 to a high of 27.
4788.04s:  So like you don't want to get you don't want to get ran over, fallen asleep, not expecting that
4792.84s:  to happen. So 19 to 27 let's call it a 10 point move. If we analyze this and we look at a 10 point
4800.92s:  move, I'm seeing if my dashers trying to hit me up. Okay, now we're good.
4831.08s:  So yeah, back to this probability or like what would this look at a 10 point move? So that would
4835.88s:  take us from spot is 17 to 27. So you have to be ready to take this move. I think to 27. So what's
4846.28s:  the probability of touching 27 over the next expiration cycle, which is 27? The probability of
4854.04s:  touching 27 is like 54%. It's a really good probability. And that would be a really, really
4861.72s:  massive loss on a relative basis. So I actually wouldn't love this trade personally. It's not
4867.40s:  collecting enough because you're collecting $106 for that probability of getting up to 27,
4874.68s:  which would lose you 550. Right. So you're making one risking five and a half. Not a fam that
4882.68s:  in it. That's not what I would do. So in this kind of case, if I wanted to trade vol, I probably
4890.04s:  would have to trade it via a strangle and go both sides so that you can get the puts queue.
4896.68s:  Because these are going to be way more right like on a 29 delta, you're getting a dollar 30 something
4902.04s:  compared to a dollar eight for the same 30 delta on the call side. So that will kind of even it
4909.56s:  out a little bit. It'll help you. Right. So now if you get up to that 27, handle, you're losing 400
4914.28s:  bucks, but you're collecting 243. If it hangs out here now, obviously you added risk to the other
4920.44s:  side now, but I would be less concerned with the downside risk because it's, I mean, it's already
4926.12s:  only at 17 bucks. So even if it goes down to seven, this lose 563 bucks, but what's the probability
4932.60s:  of it touching down to seven in this time frame, which is 27 probability of us getting to seven
4940.44s:  for a touch is 4.8%. So you see how I kind of think about how I want to build the trade based on
4948.44s:  probabilities so that I'm not just, I now this looks like a good trade before it looked like a problem.
4957.16s:  But by collecting that puts skew side of things, again, you do open up downside risk. So if you have
4963.24s:  a really strong directional disposition, then there's nothing wrong with just trading the short
4967.32s:  calls and accept the risk. But for me, when I'm trading something like this, personally, my mind
4971.88s:  drifts towards like variance or premiums, but a slightly different structure.
4977.72s:  Oxchup says, what is your view on TLT? Yeah, TLT has been interesting. I had a position in it for a while,
4985.00s:  took it down, built another position, took it down. So right now, I don't have anything on in here.
4990.20s:  But I mean, essentially anything I first saw when I was breaking above here is one of my first
4995.48s:  alert went off. And I absolutely think TLT will continue to rally. My guess is that it'll start
5002.04s:  getting gummed up in like the hundreds. And so it's getting really close. I think the overall
5008.20s:  profit potential on this will be fairly limited because even if it gets above this 100 handle
5014.60s:  and it starts rallying into the one with like, that's the thing, right? Like we're now talking
5017.80s:  about two point moves. It's just not that exciting for me. So when I first traded TLT, it was really
5024.12s:  trading like this move from the high 80s into the mid 90s. That's what I cared about. That was a
5031.16s:  much better move. And now even though it looks like it's going off into the moon on a relative
5036.28s:  basis, it's just not moving a ton. It's moving to be clear. Like this is a six point move. So it's
5042.28s:  absolutely moving. But now you have to kind of think about where's the where's the top line on it.
5048.12s:  And if I use just longer term references, like I think the the time it will take it to get back
5055.00s:  up towards like the mid ones is going to be a hot minute. And it's got a lot to get through
5060.60s:  in order to get there. So I think there will be plenty of buy opportunities that will show up
5067.32s:  in the interim. So like I'll set alerts like this so that I can see them. Don't need this.
5074.36s:  I don't need that. So what I'll do is I'll set like different thresholds. So as it's breaking
5079.64s:  above various levels, I'll track it. But it's I mean, it's got a lot. It's got to get through
5087.24s:  before it really can in my opinion like open up meaningfully. So that is the thought on TLT.
5097.24s:  All right, gang. Time for me to pack it up. Like I said, I'll be out of touch for about a week.
5108.28s:  So you guys will be on your own to hold down the four if you're in the discord. Make sure you're
5112.76s:  playing nice in there doing the good things, paying attention to that risk. I hope you all have
5118.52s:  a killer weekend. Do not forget to be an outlier. No live streams next week back on the week after
5123.88s:  that. I'll see you guys later.
