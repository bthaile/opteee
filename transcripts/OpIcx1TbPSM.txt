0.00s: What's up, everyone?
1.60s: Quick market update, then I'm going to talk about some GME updates as well.
6.44s: We did have an expiration cycle today that we need to take a look at because we use some
11.28s: interesting options activity.
13.60s: Nothing and I'm really against being hyperbolic in what I talk about.
17.72s: It's nothing insane, but there are things that I kind of caught, which we have a handful
24.28s: of large transactions coming through.
26.72s: So we'll take a look at that in just one second, but I do want to show you some broader
31.48s: economic data really fast.
33.32s: I did this yesterday and it's mostly because I am a trader writ large.
37.96s: I'm very interested in what's going on with GameStop obviously.
41.64s: But I also think it's important to share some of the other market effects going on right
46.12s: now because there's just a lot going on and it's good to be aware whether you just want
51.28s: to trade GameStop or you want to learn about other things.
53.76s: I think it's worthwhile.
55.00s: So long story short, we're seeing a couple big things happen.
59.72s: Primarily, CPI came out yesterday and it came in a little bit hot.
66.08s: Then we have PPI come out today and it was forecasted at 2.3% came in at 2.6%.
72.96s: And we also had the Michigan sentiment come out.
75.64s: This is kind of like a macro economic assessment and that came in light.
79.84s: So it was expected at 68 and a half came in at 66.
82.96s: All of this matters because right now from a broad market perspective, we care so much
87.88s: about the rate environment and when we think we might be seeing a cut.
94.12s: So there's actually a really cool tool.
95.84s: You can use bond futures and bonds themselves if you're inclined to calculate the market's
101.84s: perception and probability of perspective cuts.
106.32s: But you can also use this tool here and it's called the FedWatch tool.
109.72s: It's very, very cool.
111.36s: And really, I just want to show you this really quick.
113.52s: If you compare the probabilities, it shows you different time frames.
118.36s: So this shows you the current probability that shows you from a day ago, a week ago, a
122.64s: month ago.
124.12s: And this is specifically what I want to show you.
128.40s: If you go to 18 September, the probability of a cut has skyrocketed.
135.24s: This is something to be aware of because if we do get a cut, the probability is for
141.24s: you to see things like small caps and bonds go up.
146.20s: And that's what we're already starting to see.
148.80s: So you can see that the Russell, which is the Russell 2000 index has gone off off the
155.08s: chain.
156.08s: This is a freaking index.
158.64s: And it's gone up essentially from 2036 to 2163 and three days.
165.72s: That is a massive move.
167.00s: You do not see things like this happen frequently.
169.92s: This is a huge money making opportunity.
172.52s: That's what it boils down to.
173.36s: And if we take a look at TLT, it's a similar story over the last three days.
177.40s: It's had relative to what it is a very big move.
181.12s: So I just want you guys to be aware of those things as you go throughout the rest of your
185.92s: weekend, planning trades and stuff like that.
188.28s: But let's get into the bell of the ball.
190.40s: What most people are interested in, which is GameStop.
193.64s: So let me zoom this in a little bit like six month daily.
196.60s: A couple of things.
198.64s: This positive drift continues.
200.64s: I talked about this not too long ago.
203.04s: If I go into like a 30 day for our chart, notice again, I keep talking about this term
209.68s: low that we saw on the first of July.
212.24s: And we've just kind of been slowly building up.
214.56s: Now there was a couple comments in my last video of people are like, don't look at the
218.24s: price.
219.24s: The prices fake.
220.24s: And I understand their perspective.
221.24s: I know why they think that.
223.16s: It's still important to look at the price.
225.68s: As I always say, I think attempting to apply standard technical analysis and something
230.28s: like GameStop is silly because that's not what makes it special.
234.12s: And I've said that a million times, I'm not going to belabor that point further.
237.56s: But I don't think it's good to get to binary in your assessment of information as a
244.68s: trader.
245.68s: So what that means is because some people think the price is so heavily manipulated that
250.16s: it's fake.
251.88s: But they miss is that while the manipulation of those things might be happening, it doesn't
256.28s: mean just throw the price out entirely, never look at it.
259.64s: I get their perspective, but like I try to remind people in general, kind of finding
264.64s: a balance is really useful.
266.84s: I find in trading.
268.24s: So I just encourage people to kind of consider that even with something like GameStop,
272.20s: which again, I'm on the same page as you guys with a lot of things.
275.56s: There are a lot of very squarely things going on.
278.64s: And it's actually something that Newton and I are going to talk about more tomorrow during
282.72s: our next live stream together, which will be at 5 p.m. Pacific time, same time, same
286.72s: place is last week.
289.04s: And this one will be probably like a two hour long session.
291.32s: So I'm excited to get further into detail because there is a lot going on here.
295.24s: I'm just encouraging people don't just throw out information because you think it's so
299.44s: heavily manipulated that it's completely fake.
301.92s: You miss some details, which are kind of useful to see, which another interesting detail.
307.04s: We saw volume die off today, yet price didn't crater yet again.
314.32s: So this floor still continues to be respected to some degree.
318.84s: And when I say floor, I'm not saying any sort of price or line on the chart.
322.36s: I just mean that again, if people really wanted to bury this thing and try shorting it into
326.76s: the dirt, they're not doing it because I'm not seeing any volume stepping up to a big
331.96s: degree here.
332.96s: And I'm not seeing massive sale volume.
334.68s: And today it was what, 39% sale volume, it's just not an overwhelming amount of sale
344.04s: volume coming in, which I still continue to find slightly intriguing.
347.36s: And we're coming into a really important exploration cycle way more important in my
351.28s: opinion than today.
352.80s: And the reason being is because these weekly explorations, as I've said a lot, tend to
356.60s: be quiet.
357.60s: And notice what happened here.
359.84s: The volatility for next week's exploration cycle is jacking way up, way up.
368.80s: It's now up to almost 140%.
370.96s: This was down not that long ago.
373.80s: So the market is starting to build a little bit of an anticipation for this coming exploration
379.16s: cycle.
380.88s: Not so much out here in the 16 aug just yet, that's still hovering around like 121.
386.04s: It's still much higher than the surrounding exploration cycles.
388.76s: Again, like this is telling information from a trading perspective from it is specifically
393.16s: an options trading perspective.
394.96s: You can pull out a lot of details of what the market is expecting to happen based on how
399.40s: it's pricing volatility.
401.00s: Volatility is an expectation of movement.
404.12s: So when we see volatility on a relative basis to this time frame being this much higher
408.08s: than these other two, that tells you market is saying, yeah, I'm expecting bigger movement
414.04s: in this exploration cycle as compared to nine auger 23 aug.
418.48s: Well, sometimes you might infer, well, maybe there's earnings in there.
421.36s: Well, we know that's not the case.
422.36s: It just had earnings so that tells you the market is seeing something here.
426.36s: What exactly?
427.36s: We don't know yet.
429.32s: Of not knowing, there was a big old trade that came through today.
433.84s: So the 16 aug 2430 calls, we saw 998 of those.
439.80s: And this was a sale that came in.
442.20s: They were picked up at 263.
445.24s: And that's where the bid was.
446.32s: So it came in right at the bid.
448.12s: Again, the expectation there is that this is a sale position, but the notional value of
454.28s: this trade is over $200,000, the $262,000.
460.28s: So this is somebody collecting a decent amount of money is what this is.
464.48s: And it could be part of covered calls.
467.20s: That's not a bad payday or essentially a month of perspective holding even up to 30.
474.64s: It's a quarter million dollars right there.
476.48s: So somebody is kind of picking up a decent chunk of change there.
479.92s: You can speculate who or what that might be.
483.68s: I genuinely don't know.
484.76s: That's not like some sort of hidden message.
486.16s: I know you guys are really good at looking for those.
488.32s: That's not to infer.
489.32s: I think that that's RK, although it absolutely could be.
492.24s: I genuinely have no clue who that is.
495.08s: This is also a fascinating trade.
498.44s: So we had 546 come in at the 20 calls 16ogs.
504.44s: So again, 546 times 675.
508.36s: It's a $368,000 trade.
511.72s: Same expiration, same sell side.
514.44s: So again, expectation of downside and then take a look at these.
518.56s: The 16 Jan 2620 calls 483 of those.
525.28s: And those came in at 1330.
528.68s: It's a $642,000 position.
530.76s: What I'm showing you is that there's money moving in here.
533.56s: Very clear.
534.32s: And look, there's even more down here at the 16 Jan 26 is.
539.56s: So there's activity.
541.36s: This is pretty lively in terms of total position sizing that we've seen lately.
546.52s: So I think that that's worth at least highlighting.
549.40s: Again, inferring what this precisely translates over into.
553.04s: It's a little bit early to tell in my opinion, but there's activity,
556.64s: which to me in and of itself is pretty good.
559.28s: So you can see from unusual whales here,
562.76s: they kind of a breakdown of the premium transactions.
566.00s: I'll get rid of the bids for now, which means transactions that we think
570.52s: occurred somewhere on the sell side and just take a look at the pickups.
576.28s: So we do have those 16 Jan 26 that one we were just talking about $642,000 at the 20s.
582.96s: We have the 17 Jan 25s, the 20s again, that's a $500,000 trade.
589.36s: We have the 20s again in 16 Jan 26.
593.12s: This is another $333,000 trade.
596.64s: You start looking at the numbers between these.
599.16s: They're not far apart at all in terms of when they were filled.
603.24s: $850, $850, $850, slightly different sizes, almost $1,000,000.
611.80s: Very nice to me, pretty far out though.
614.68s: So these are definitely long runway style trades,
618.68s: but the 20s are getting hit across a bunch of different expressions.
623.40s: There's a lot of expectation to the upside occurring here.
627.96s: So if we go down now to see our open interest,
631.64s: the call side is opening up a little bit compared to the put side.
634.44s: Again, the puts were about $500,000 yesterday.
636.68s: It's a little bit higher like $525 now, whatever.
639.24s: But these ticked up 914,000 is compared to the $800,000.
643.56s: So this is starting to widen out again into that kind of more persistent
647.72s: call leaning relationship that we've seen.
650.60s: And if we take a look at the volume today, we're back over $300,000.
653.96s: Yesterday was very quiet.
655.00s: It was under $200,000 contracts.
657.00s: I think I said $200,000.
658.28s: I didn't mean that.
658.84s: I meant contracts if I did.
660.52s: Who knows? Who knows what I'm saying anymore.
662.12s: It's so hard to keep track of reality when you're looking at something like this.
666.36s: Because so much of this is just so so crazy.
671.24s: Today, 99,000 puts went out and the overwhelming majority of volume you can see
679.40s: is centered on today and then 19 July.
682.20s: Take a look at these 19 July 30s.
683.88s: 30,469 of them going off.
687.08s: So there is this standard rotation that we've talked about before coming out into the next
692.44s: primary expiration cycle.
693.88s: This here is becoming interesting to me.
697.24s: The 30s now have 60,000 OI with an additional 30,000 volume today.
704.20s: Over yesterday it was 15,700 net positive ads to the contracts,
708.44s: meaning opening positions.
710.52s: So that's not an insignificant amount of activity.
714.92s: We also have some of these further in the monies.
717.64s: These 28,000 at the 25s with another eight coming in.
721.48s: And then we have our homey out here that we picked up a little while ago all the way down at
725.80s: the 10s and he's still hanging out.
727.72s: I can see his position right there.
730.04s: So he's been kind of riding solo.
731.96s: I just been keeping an eye on him because you know,
734.20s: trying to keep him some companies and all the way in there by himself.
737.40s: And let's open it this up all the way.
739.00s: Let's check the super far strikes and we see the same thing as usual.
743.56s: The 125s have 56,000 contracts on them with 5,600 traded today.
752.28s: Net positive over yesterday's 2700 so people still building a position here.
756.52s: So I hear myself talking about this.
757.72s: It almost sounds like I'm talking about the weather.
759.64s: It's kind of funny, but I'm literally talking about 10s and hundreds of thousands of dollars being
764.68s: thrown around with a week to go.
767.48s: And if they're out of the money, they're worth nothing, which is always pretty fun.
772.60s: About options if we think about it.
773.88s: That's what makes them the special little things that they are.
777.88s: So for me, I took a few of my positions down today.
782.28s: I had the 16 augs.
783.64s: Those came down because there was a decent price accommodation.
787.56s: And then I have exposure now still via shares.
791.24s: And then I'm out in 20 September and 18 October.
793.80s: I was where I'm looking.
795.64s: I didn't get a fill on the 18 October.
797.48s: It was a little too liquid, but that's where I'm looking to go next.
800.36s: So I'm playing along with it as it's continuing to move in this direction.
804.92s: Again, I'm a trader.
806.28s: I'm fascinated by the story, but there are two different parts of my brains.
809.32s: The trader part of me is here to make money, nothing more, nothing less.
812.28s: And then there's the just fascination with this whole saga and the interest in the story itself,
818.84s: which I don't see that dying off anytime soon.
821.40s: But that's kind of the way I think about this thing.
824.12s: The way I'm trading it is the way I trade anything,
826.12s: which is with the pure intention of making money on the product.
830.04s: So as always, there's any questions or anything you want me to take a look at.
833.96s: People have been sending me emails with all different kinds of interesting things.
836.68s: Some of them are pretty crazy, but I love them all the same.
840.44s: Like I tell anybody, I think it's important to be open to new information,
844.76s: but that doesn't mean that we fully believe everything we see.
848.04s: We're really good at looking for patterns.
850.20s: The brain is primed to do those kinds of things.
852.36s: That's actually why some people are really good at trading is because you can start to identify patterns.
856.84s: But we have to at least for me, I try to remain as objective as I possibly can in the
864.28s: evaluation of things. So I love taking a look at the stuff that you guys are sending me.
868.52s: I'm really, really appreciative. Thank you so much for sharing more of the story and
872.68s: information with me. If there's anything you want me to take a look at, as always, let me know.
876.28s: Being outlier, tune in tomorrow to the live stream with Newton.
879.64s: I'll see you guys later.
