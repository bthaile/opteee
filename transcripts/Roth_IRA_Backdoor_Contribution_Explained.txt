0.56s: what's up outliers today we're going to
2.20s: talk about making a backdoor Roth IRA
5.60s: contribution so you could trade options
7.68s: in your IRA account so let's talk first
12.00s: about why a Roth versus a traditional
15.56s: then we'll talk about why back door and
18.16s: I'm going to give you literally a
19.24s: step-by-step process I literally just
21.04s: completed mine for the year so sharing
23.20s: with you for years so the first thing
25.52s: why a Roth well a Roth allows for tax
29.64s: fre growth of your Capital very similar
32.00s: to a traditional in that sense however
34.88s: as compared to
36.28s: traditional where there's no tax on the
40.28s: contribution with a WTH You tax on the
44.60s: contribution but then you are not a on
47.80s: the withdrawal this is useful if you
50.44s: think your income in the future is
52.32s: likely to be higher than it is now and
55.12s: for a lot of traders that will be the
57.20s: case for people that are working in W2
59.24s: jobs and stuff like that probably less
61.36s: so obviously consult a tax professional
65.12s: not a dude on the internet Next Step why
68.60s: back door well it's actually pretty
70.60s: simple it's because if you fall into
73.56s: some of these various buckets you
76.04s: literally cannot contribute to a Roth
78.60s: IRA so for example if you're single and
82.12s: you make over 161,000 you cannot
85.32s: contribute if you're married filed
87.52s: jointly you cannot contribute if it's
89.92s: over 240,000 which is kind of a bummer
92.32s: because again for Traders and people who
94.56s: invest there's a good chance you're
95.96s: going to be worth more in the future
97.04s: than you are today
99.64s: so this is why we use the backd door
103.32s: contribution is because it is a legal
106.04s: method for high income earners to
109.12s: contribute to a Roth account so now
114.20s: let's talk about the steps to complete
116.00s: it's actually really easy so the first
118.48s: thing is you're going to make a
120.04s: non-deductible contribution to a
122.88s: traditional IRA why is it not deductible
127.72s: well it's for the same reasons that you
130.56s: kind of see over here if you have a
133.84s: certain amount of income in this case if
136.08s: you're single and you make over 89k you
138.84s: can no
140.16s: longer take the deduction on a
143.24s: traditional contribution so the majority
146.04s: of instances this is what's going to be
148.64s: the case for people that are doing a
150.36s: backdoor contribution so you're going to
152.44s: start with a non-deductible contribution
154.80s: which we'll talk about how to track that
156.76s: a little bit later it's again very
158.64s: simple there's essentially two forms
161.12s: that you need and that's it step two is
163.84s: an optional holding period I essentially
166.64s: don't really use this this is some
169.12s: people do it out of a bit of concern
173.08s: trying to reduce their potential
174.64s: footprint for being flagged but the
177.04s: reality is it's completely illegal to do
179.68s: and and if you acrew any gains while you
184.92s: hold that position then you run into the
188.40s: prata rule so once you have your
191.88s: traditional you make your contribution
194.36s: that's non-deductible then you once your
197.88s: funds settle which typically takes a
199.76s: couple days by itself we convert it to a
203.12s: WTH Ira if there are no gains on the
207.00s: traditional then there's no tax on the
209.40s: conversion
210.76s: if there is or are gains existing or you
214.84s: acre them in the meantime before you
217.72s: complete the conversion then you do pay
220.00s: taxes on the gains but there is no
223.28s: penalty to do so so it's essentially
226.00s: just going to increase your tax
227.20s: footprint a little bit
229.36s: unnecessarily now the last thing we
232.56s: report the conversion on our taxes and
235.12s: there's essentially two forms there's
237.04s: the IRS form 8606 which is for UND
239.88s: deductible contributions you literally
241.40s: can just type in IRS form 8606 and it'll
244.04s: pop up and then your broker will send
246.20s: you a form $199 R which is a conversion
249.56s: notice essentially a new distributions
251.28s: from retirement accounts that one comes
253.16s: from your broker now I do not do my own
256.56s: taxes I have them for a long time I have
257.96s: a tax professional that helps me with
260.16s: all this stuff but what you'll notice is
262.32s: even if you don't do your taxes yourself
263.96s: it's useful to know these documents to
267.28s: know the process so that you're aware so
269.36s: for those that are on Schwab that's who
272.20s: I use essentially what you're going to
274.12s: do is initiate a transfer and you can
276.68s: see when you start the transfer you're
280.12s: going to say that I want to cash
281.92s: whatever you have in there and then down
283.96s: here below my head one second let me
288.32s: slide me out of the way then down
290.84s: further below this there will be
293.36s: essentially a from account to account
297.96s: and when you click that it's going to
299.32s: detect
300.28s: that it is Ira or retirement accounts so
303.08s: this will pop up at the top so then all
305.20s: you do is click this here that says to
307.76s: complete the Roth
310.00s: conversion you click that and then this
312.44s: form pops up and then essentially you
315.16s: say I want to take it from the
316.52s: traditional I want to put it into the
319.68s: Roth I want to do a there's two
322.32s: different there's b or complete and then
324.68s: a partial so typically would be complete
326.92s: cuz you want to get everything out of
328.08s: the account and then move it into to the
329.88s: Roth and then once you complete that
332.68s: that's when you get your form 8606 to be
335.68s: able to file that and that's when you
337.72s: also wait until your broker gives you
340.64s: your 1099 R so the whole point behind
343.80s: doing this is to be able to move money
347.40s: into your Roth IRA once you get priced
350.44s: out of being able to directly contribute
352.64s: and this isn't specific for options
354.76s: trading I do trade options in my IRA
358.64s: accounts ever this is for anybody that's
361.88s: trying to get money into your Roth IRA
364.68s: this process is about the same so if
367.20s: there's any questions on how this works
369.64s: let me know be an outlier I'll see you
371.68s: later
