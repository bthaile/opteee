402.00s: friend
406.00s: uh, my instincts would do this, but YouTube would probably turn me off int
410.00s: hello
412.00s: text
414.00s: business and finance. Okay. What the fuck? This is crazy that this is still a thing.
430.88s: Like, this is, this is awful. It's like not easy to read. I cannot believe that people
439.48s: mostly use this thing. Interesting. So this says insider here, the reason why institutions
447.44s: keep loading up on GME despite all the supposed analyst warnings of the stock because they
452.36s: understand what's happening. The company is slowly and quietly becoming a holding company.
456.88s: RC is discreetly making moves while keeping the price very steady. We'll eventually explode
463.28s: and make many people rich. Go here isn't moass so people can sell and become rich. The
469.48s: goal is to share, is to get the share price so high holders don't need to sell. They can
473.38s: borrow against the stock as collateral. I don't think this is an insider to be honest.
479.12s: Buy as much as you can and just hold it. This is financial advice. I don't believe this
483.12s: is an insider. The reason why I say that is because there's this, there's this big thing
489.88s: where I see it on like different YouTube shorts and stuff like that where regular retail
498.88s: traders, they're introduced to this idea of like borrowing against their stock so that
505.08s: they don't have to sell it using it as collateral. And it's like, it's just, it's not the thing
510.68s: people think it is. People, like when people say this, they make it seem like you never
516.48s: have to sell your stock because you can borrow against it and then you just live off of
522.28s: what you borrow against. But anybody that is even loosely familiar with this knows that
529.48s: this is not the case. So this is the kind of thing where it like it seems like this big
534.88s: unlock for people that are not really in the know. And it's funny because when you learn
540.64s: about this, you then feel like you're in the know, but you're not. So here's the issue.
546.76s: If I am a rich person, my boy's name is Rich, because he's rich and rich person holds
559.24s: a portfolio of stocks. And let's say that this is worth 10 million. What? This person is
569.60s: saying and what the commonly cited poor person understanding is what they do is rather
576.56s: than selling, which realize this is a taxable event. Instead, what they do is they borrow
589.56s: against this collateral because there's value here. So then they borrow the one million
594.64s: dollars, whatever it is that they want. And then like somehow this cycle continues into
601.88s: perpetuity. You guys see the problem here? Doesn't fucking work like this. If you borrow
609.84s: money, you have to pay this back. You have to pay it back. It's not like this thing
616.08s: where the banks are just like, yo, take this, take this free money and then don't give
623.48s: us anything. Not only do you have to pay it back, it's with fucking interest. And depending
629.56s: on the size of the loan, just like in general, you get better interest rates, the larger the
634.00s: loan being the interest rate, how much you're going to yield. It's, it's just again, there's
640.48s: a, there's a case for this. Not saying that this isn't useful, but it's not what the
645.96s: people think it is. It's not what people like this make it out to be. This person is making
651.04s: it out so that if the price is so high, the shareholders don't need to sell. They'll
655.92s: just borrow against the stock as collateral. It doesn't make fucking sense. It's just,
661.00s: it's not how this works. There are instances where you might want to come up with some
667.76s: sort of longer term arrangement where you're not pulling your money out because you think
675.64s: that this might grow enough because where this can make sense is, let's say that your
681.80s: interest is 5%. And then if you think that this asset is going to grow at 15%, this in
693.16s: and of itself would net you positive 10%. Right? Like this makes sense. Where this doesn't
701.00s: make sense anymore. And what this person is saying that if the share price goes so high,
707.64s: and then eventually it will level off, if this growth stops and you take the loan out against
715.64s: this value and let's say that this is growing at 3% and you're paying 5%. You're now net negative.
722.44s: Now you do have to factor in the cost of the taxable event here and stuff like this to see what
727.32s: the overall cost structure is. But all the same, you're net negative and you still have to pay
733.32s: this. You need to pay this with something. So some people think that this borrowed money becomes
739.08s: the people spending money. But then you have payments. You have to be able to pay the payments on
745.24s: this thing with something. So anyways, that's why I don't think that this is some sort of like
752.76s: insider because like this just doesn't make sense. But anyways, I do agree with the broader
759.64s: point that they're making here that the company is transforming. Now whether or not GameStop turns
765.00s: into a holding company or something else, I do think that there's a little bit more that we would
770.28s: have to see. Because they're going that path, but they've not really gone that full direction yet.
781.96s: And if they were going the direction, here's here's my argument. And this isn't my argument in terms
789.72s: of I don't think they're going to do it. But this is my steel manning, meaning taking another point
796.20s: of view to try to explore the idea. If the company GameStop wanted to become a holding company,
803.00s: why wouldn't they do it faster? Like that's the part that I don't understand. Because they're in
809.80s: the process of divesting the unprofitable parts of the business makes a ton of sense.
814.92s: They're in the process of closing their unprofitable stores makes a ton of sense. But if you knew that
822.04s: this is the direction you wanted to go to become a holding company, why would it be at such a slow
828.12s: rate where we're doing these store closures over the course of years, that doesn't make sense to me.
835.96s: So that's not to say that it couldn't happen. But if the company wanted to be a holding company,
841.48s: they already have the capital to do so. So I don't see why it would roll out so slow, which is
850.12s: why I actually think they could have an element that might become a holding company or the
856.92s: broader or could become a holding company, whatever that is. But I do think they're trying to salvage
862.68s: the brick and mortar business. Why else do you get into a card like physical card grading that
869.00s: needs a physical location? Right? Like it just doesn't make a ton of sense to me. So I could see it
875.56s: potentially happening, but I'm not so sure that it goes this way. Banks are out here holding bags of
883.56s: K walked into GameStop. When I realized the $7 billion CAD errors and GameStop convertible note
892.12s: completion same day, that's actually really interesting. What is this? Take a step back and see the
903.16s: way I see things, no price rainbow moving averages on balance volume and RSI.
914.36s: I can only imagine how many charts you guys have looked at of people doing weird,
920.12s: funking LSD shit like this. I'm so bullish. I'm shaking. That's awesome. I love that. This says,
928.84s: you bullish on GameStop. I'm not here to cheerleader bet against any stock, but let's break down GameStop.
934.28s: Cash pile Bitcoin bet recent fundraising. Okay. Memes stock momentum. Okay. Strategic pivots. This
944.60s: is the big one. Like this, I think is the big one hands down is the strategic pivots. What do you
950.52s: guys think? Like if you were if you were to think about what like being bullish on GameStop, I imagine
956.76s: most people are to a degree if you're here, right? But like what do you think that like the true
962.44s: bulk case is? Is it the fact that they're investing in Bitcoin? Is it the fact that they're pivoting
969.32s: the business? Like what do you guys think? It's me says in my honest opinion GameStop will be back
976.60s: to the future arcade locations upgraded for current times. That's an interesting idea. That's a
981.96s: really interesting idea. Huh. Curious idea. But I still think they're clearly is an upside case
997.40s: here. And when I think about it, it's a mix of things. That's why I'm curious what you guys think.
1005.16s: Lauren says I think they're pivoting, but I have no idea where. I agree with that. And I think
1010.28s: the way that you frame it is also correct, right? And the fact that we can see signs that the pivot
1017.16s: is happening. We can see those signs. There's some big changes. The investment into Bitcoin is
1024.28s: a change. The card grading part of the business is a change. And if I'm not mistaken, I think that
1029.40s: there's a more recent piece of news. I have to catch up on GameStop that moves us further down
1037.08s: this path. But let's take a look at what Gemini says. I'm going to do this. I'm going to ask
1047.40s: Grock the same thing. And let's see what they say. So this is what Gemini says. This is what
1064.28s: Grock has for us. Gemini says, remained in headlines, significant restructuring,
1072.20s: foray in a crypto, which is correct, continued volatility, correct, actively raising capital,
1081.88s: and signaling a strategic shift in its treasury management, correct? Yeah.
1087.48s: Essential theme, aggressive capital raising efforts, definitely. So I'm going to ask Gemini what
1093.64s: it thinks of the capital raising. What do you make of the capital raising efforts?
1103.88s: I'm actually very curious how it would analyze that. Talks about the offering,
1111.56s: purchase a Bitcoin. Yes, this is all just standard stuff. Let's see what it says to that. And then
1116.20s: let's see what Grock says. Grock says, the note offering, obviously Bitcoin, yes, strong earnings.
1123.16s: It did have a really good earnings for sure. And again, when we reviewed earnings, this was the main
1130.36s: this was the main issue is revenue because revenue is still falling. But that will happen as the
1137.32s: company is going through shifts. So I think you have to expect that. Calm down, Jack says, I wonder
1142.52s: if it'll hit 19 by August. If what will hit 19 the price of GameStop? I would take the over on
1151.88s: that. And as you guys know, it's not because I'm sort of like GameStop permable. I really do my best
1157.80s: to just objectively evaluate what I'm looking at. But the reason why I would take the over on that
1165.48s: is because if you take a look at the 19 handle, it really hasn't been in the 19 handle until August.
1172.44s: Of last year. And I think it's objectively true that the company is more valuable today than
1179.48s: they were in August of last year. And I think you can see that also generated through their earnings.
1185.88s: Right? Like they came through at 17 cents on their earnings where they were expected at eight.
1192.04s: They doubled. So yeah, I don't really wonder if they'll hit 19 unless there's something there
1200.84s: that you guys are seeing why 19 might be a number of interest. But I just don't see that. Also,
1206.84s: as always, it's hot. The shirts coming off. That's just kind of we're in this time of year.
1213.16s: If you're new to the channel, I'm one of those dudes. I live in Southern California, but
1218.28s: I don't like running the air too much. So it's easier to take a shirt off.
1223.32s: But yeah, I don't I don't think 19 looks super probable to me.
1230.68s: Stax says as crypto saturates our lives, physical stores can sell crypto wallets. Yeah,
1235.88s: and I think there will still be a use case realistically for physical stores.
1241.24s: Like I don't think and I think in my opinion, that's why GameStop isn't unwinding all of the
1246.36s: stores super fast. Because if they wanted to, they absolutely could. But I don't I don't think so.
1257.56s: And I think that they like purposefully want to keep the stores. And they're just doing it in a
1266.12s: highly selective way. Which again, to me, it's like that makes complete sense. Why would they not do
1273.48s: that? Especially if they view some sort of future element of their business that has a physical
1283.24s: footprint for sure. So Daniel says I'm married and my wife is what? Oh, preman apostle. So the air
1294.68s: is cranked. That's rad. Yeah, I I'm weird, man, because it's like we run the air especially at
1301.64s: night when we're trying to sleep because you know, it's just kind of a much better sleeping
1307.32s: environment. But I don't know what it is about running the air. I feel like it's one of those
1312.92s: things where if you are a just a dude, there has to be some sort of change in your life that leads to
1325.24s: at some point turning a corner and being like, I don't want to run the air anymore. I don't know why.
1331.40s: It's like the thermostat thing, right? That whole thermostat joke is a reason for
1336.68s: it's their good joke for a reason, I think. Stax says they can also serve as physical
1343.24s: location for currency exchange, Kiosk for crypto transition, a cryptocurrency bank. That's really
1348.28s: interesting. I'm not so sure that they would want to go into banking now. That's a big pivot.
1355.72s: That's a really big pivot. I'm not sure how it's to see that.
1365.56s: Let's see. So the trading cards we already talked about that.
1370.60s: This was it. The collectibles. So integrating collectibles into the 3200 stores with
1375.48s: initials like Powerpacks and partnerships with PSA. The move aims to offset the clients. Let's see
1382.92s: what this is. This is what I was thinking of.
1393.00s: Oh, God. We need to get these people to run with TLDRs.
1401.96s: Something about burn and money. I don't know. I try to read this twice and I got bored. So I'm
1406.36s: just switching to this. Young Bill Lees of today sticking. What the fuck is this article man?
1415.56s: Here we go. The trading card market, whether it's sports, Pokemon collectibles is lined with
1419.08s: our heritage. It fits our trade and model. It appeals to our core customer base, which is deeply
1423.96s: embedded physical retail. I completely agree. And then like this is him signaling, right?
1427.80s: Physical retail. That's a very, very specific point that they're that he's highlighting.
1436.36s: Unlike software, it's tactile, unlike hardware, it's high margin potential. It's a logical
1440.44s: expansion. Yeah. Like I love that. It's a great way for him to frame it.
1446.36s: Hard to say greater emphasis to collectibles. Look like for GameStop. Cohen didn't take questions
1450.36s: that the annual meeting the company has held calls public calls in 18 months according to data from
1455.16s: S&P. It's less fall partner. Yeah. So we know all this stuff.
1460.68s: Which this I think is something that you have you have to pay close attention to. Right? Because
1467.00s: as we're trying to piece together what direction this might go, how and with what severity,
1472.20s: the fact that they're emphasizing physical retail, I think is really pertinent here.
1480.12s: All right. So let's take a look at where the stock sits today. What the latest is.
1487.00s: First, let me finish this real quick. See if anything pops out of here.
1493.48s: Colin says thoughts on leaps with this low IV. That's a really common mistake actually.
1500.60s: And I'll show you why. So Colin, are you are you in the discord by chance?
1508.84s: Because if so, I was going to tell you to hop in the voice chat real quick and then I can actually
1513.32s: like talk to you. And I could discuss it with you if not the chats fine too. But the first question
1521.72s: I would have for you, Colin is talk to me about the low IV environment. What do you mean by that?
1530.12s: Are you using imply volatility percentile? Is your benchmark? Are you using imply volatility rank?
1542.76s: Are you using raw IV? I want to be clear by all those metrics. You're completely correct.
1547.80s: By the way, but there's a really common mistake people make here. And that's what I want to
1552.84s: that's what I want to show you. Colin says not yet. That's totally cool. No problem. It's so
1558.60s: here's a quick lesson on options because it's really important. So when we look at IV here
1571.56s: or stock, right? So the current IV 68.74%. Yeah, okay. So Colin says 52 week low. So he's using
1580.92s: IV percentile, which is great. IVP implied volatility percentile is right now at 2% which is
1588.28s: exactly what he's saying that this is really low. For anybody in the chat that's more familiar with
1595.96s: options, why would I say that the concept of leaps here being used when IV is low is not necessarily
1609.16s: wrong, but it's just the incorrect attachment. I wouldn't connect those two to heavily. Like,
1615.00s: I still would acknowledge them for sure, but I wouldn't connect those two to heavily. Why is that?
1621.32s: Any more option savvy folks in the chat? Have an idea. Why that might be we're talking about
1634.84s: low IV environment. And then we're talking about capitalizing on this with leaps.
1645.80s: No guess. Let's walk you on to target as always. When I do stuff like this, I mean, this is my
1654.52s: standard preference. I prefer not to give people direct answers because I don't think people
1658.68s: learn as much that way. Even though it's a little slower to do it this way, I think it connects.
1664.36s: Way more synapses in the brain to help these concepts stick in.
1672.20s: Daniel says, wouldn't you have to sell current position at low IV? Not necessarily. It's a good guess.
1679.32s: But what does this measure? Talk to me about what IV, what does IV measure? Let's look at IV,
1686.84s: IV implied volatility. What does this measure?
1699.40s: This measures the specific time frame. So this is a forward expectation
1707.64s: of volatility. But not all volatility. 30 day. All. So what you're about to learn is what
1729.08s: a volatility surface is. And you'll see why. So leaps. Daniel is exactly correct. Good job, Daniel.
1741.24s: Daniel says how much the market is pricing in the forward expected moves for the next 30 days.
1749.32s: It's exactly correct. Good job. So when we look at leaps, what are leaps? Leaps
1758.04s: are long term equity anticipation.
1768.28s: Security.
1769.16s: This is another common thing that people fuck up. It's not L-E-A-P-S. The whole thing. It's
1780.60s: L-E-A-P-S leaps. The entire thing is an acronym. So like you you can buy one leaps.
1788.04s: Which sounds weird. So most of us don't do that. We would still say I bought one leap.
1793.32s: Just weird. To say it leaps. But anyways. So what's the issue here? No one says so then it would
1803.32s: be more efficient to you shorted dated calls and roll them. Great guess. So a couple things.
1810.68s: The first thing is if we're actually trying to isolate volatility, that's a whole other
1816.04s: conversation that we can talk about briefly. The more important point here is I want to get us
1821.96s: back to why the original point that who was at that set it? Sorry, I forgot. Where's it at?
1835.56s: Where the fuck is the leaps thing? I think it was Colin somewhere. Maybe I don't know. Anyways.
1843.40s: So, oh, there we go. Colin says thoughts on leaps with this low IV. Sorry about that. So
1850.92s: here's the issue. Leaps deal with greater than one year expiry. Long dated options.
1863.24s: IV as measured here is a 30 day measure. What do you notice as I frame it this way? What's the problem
1875.88s: with this in a nutshell? What do you guys see?
1886.92s: Help me out. I'm phone in a friend. I'm phone in 37 friends to be specific. Shout out to you guys.
1896.04s: 38 friends.
1897.88s: Colin says specifically Jan 2027. Lauren says 30 days does not equal a year.
1907.72s: Bam. Here's the problem. Colin, what you're doing here, exactly. ZXBorg spot on. Exactly
1919.48s: correct. So what you're doing is applying Colin a sound fundamental approach, but you're just missing
1928.68s: some of the nuance. So the vol for leaps is completely different than the 30 day vol. It's
1938.20s: completely different. The way that the vol in leaps is behaving is completely different than the
1944.92s: way that the vol for 30 days, what we would call the underlying vol is a different ballgame.
1953.96s: So what this means is we wouldn't want to inherently use implied volatility percentile,
1961.24s: which is looking at a 30 day metric to make an assumption about the vol for leaps.
1966.92s: So here's what this means. We can make it a guess. We might make a guess that if near term vol
1978.12s: 30 day vol is very low, we might guess that longer term vol is also low, but it's not inherently low
1987.72s: because 30 days low. And there's no reason not to get more precise. So that's the first,
1995.24s: that's the first part of that whole concept. And let me show you.
2002.36s: If I take a look at these different expiration cycles, what do you notice about the volatility
2009.32s: as you go further out in time?
2011.32s: Aki.
2021.08s: Front vol, let's just call everything in here like a weighted average like 30 day vol
2029.56s: is somewhere in the mid 60s. Let's call it 64 percent. Yet if we go further out,
2036.28s: your average is really like 77 percent. So there's a 13 point variance, I'm sorry, a 9 point
2045.96s: variance, 13 point variance. I don't know what the fuck just happened to me there might have
2050.60s: just had a stroke. My bad. 13 points between these. So then the question becomes, is this 77 percent
2062.84s: actually low? Because we can't use implied volatility percentile, it's a different vol.
2073.80s: So there's a few ways to do this. You can either use historic pricing and come up with your own
2083.32s: metric. I think if I'm not mistaken actually, let's see really quick. I don't know if this has
2090.84s: long term vol. Let's see.
2102.44s: Oh, it does. This is great. So what we can do is take, so this is literally beautiful.
2111.00s: So let's go back to the 20th of June. And let's take a look at the difference between this,
2118.92s: notice how low 30 day vol is here compared to again, leaps, which is out here all the way at the
2127.72s: other end of this graph. So notice the difference between these huge. So now let's go back. And
2135.72s: let's go back to the 20th of June, just that curiosity.
2138.44s: That got completely blown out because of the zero DTE. I don't know if there's a way to turn that off.
2155.80s: I'm trying to make this easier to see. There we go. This is fine. So this is, let's go back like a
2163.32s: month. There's a 28 June. We'll go back a couple months. It's perfect. So if we go back to 28 June,
2172.60s: what do you notice? If we go back to 28 June, long term vol about the same. So then if we go
2180.76s: back further, again, this is 28 April. I think that's as far back as it let's, let's let's go.
2189.16s: So let's go to 28 May and see what long term vol looks like. But notice the difference in
2194.52s: front vol. How much front vol moved? Now let's take a look at how much back and vol moves the
2201.24s: difference between May and now. What do you notice? All of this movement that you see in vol is
2212.52s: happening in the front. So again, using even this expiration, that's 233 days of expiration.
2223.08s: From 28 May, vol was 74%. I'm trying to see if I can click the other wine here.
2234.52s: Let me get rid of these. Oh cool. So for the current expiration,
2246.68s: vol there is 75%. If we add the other, it's still 75%.
2254.76s: So what I'm showing you here is that there is essentially no change happening with long term
2266.44s: vol. So if you bought leaps with an expectation that you would make money as vol increased,
2276.52s: what you would end up seeing is the vol and game stop here. Let's say if vol goes up from 68
2283.80s: to 100, you'd be saying, damn, that's a big move in vol. I should be up a bunch of money.
2289.40s: And then when you take a look at your leaps, you're going to be like, fuck, I didn't see any of it.
2294.36s: What happened? This is what happened. You're playing a completely different duration vol
2300.60s: than what you're looking at in the other example.
2303.72s: Let me know if you have any questions on that. Lauren says, in the front, do you mean short term?
2314.04s: Yeah. So whenever we refer to front and back, it's just talking about terms or
2320.68s: explorations relative to one another. The front is some sort of front term near.
2327.00s: The back is further out in time. Shahazad says, yesterday's stream is showing private
2334.12s: unable to access it, wanted to catch the rest. I'd have to look. I don't know why. It might have
2340.68s: gotten taken down for some reason. Sometimes YouTube does that, especially with the streams.
2345.16s: I don't honestly remember what we looked at. If there was anything that we looked at that
2350.28s: led to them not liking it. But yeah, yesterday was kind of a random stream anyways.
2358.68s: But yeah, back to this. So specifically for Colin, does what I just explain makes sense?
2366.04s: Because your instinct in your idea is it's good. You have a good idea.
2371.88s: The issue is if you executed that idea as you had designed, you probably would be like,
2380.84s: what the fuck happened? Because it wouldn't be in at least based on what I could see here. It really
2387.00s: wouldn't be what you were looking for. Because if you did get that move involved, you wouldn't
2393.64s: really have much to show for it.
2400.68s: Okay, cool. Glad that that makes sense. I like to, well, at least I do my best to try to make it
2408.28s: connect all the way. So beautiful. Glad that that's all good. Now let's talk a little bit about,
2416.28s: I think Lauren had a follow on question that I want to make sure we can get to.
2423.88s: Where was it? Oh, no, we already got it. It was just about the front. Okay, cool. Yeah, we
2434.84s: Gucci then. Sweet. So now let's talk a little bit about one other factor with respect to like
2443.88s: more volatile names like GameStop with respect to how volatility behaves. Because in that trade
2453.88s: idea that you had that you shared with us, you wouldn't actually be isolating volatility very well.
2462.76s: And it's because if you're using leaps of some sort, so let's say that you were trying to
2471.40s: gain exposure to a longer term idea or you're using leap calls, whatever the case is, you're using
2478.28s: some sort of longer term option. Now the issue that you're going to face with that is almost
2485.88s: all of the volatility in GameStop is going to occur in the front. And the other thing is if you do
2496.12s: if you do start to get hold on, if you do start to get those moves, your long term option,
2504.36s: specifically a long call is really going to be based on direction.
2509.08s: Kind of it. It's just going to be a directional play because you'll still have the delta of the
2514.76s: position. Delta doesn't go away. Delta is Delta. We learned this actually on the stream yesterday
2520.84s: that regardless of how far out in time you go, delta itself is delta. So what that means is if
2528.84s: you get a 50 delta that expires in a day or a 50 delta that expires in 500 days, it's still 50 delta.
2535.32s: Now the movement of delta itself will be different based on gamma, but delta itself is delta, no
2542.92s: matter what. GP says, so you don't benefit too much from low 30 day IV if you buy 90 days more
2551.48s: out. That's exactly correct. So what this is saying, and it's not inherently 90 days, 60 days,
2557.72s: 100 days, it depends on how that longer term vol is. So in this context, if we take a look at 90 days,
2565.80s: we can see 90 days is actually moving more. So if I were to just ballpark this, I don't know why
2574.28s: it doesn't let me use all points on the line. I think it's just because the expirations, yeah,
2580.12s: max, messed up, messed up, mixed up on the expirations. But you can see that at 60 days,
2589.48s: there's still a big variance. So this is 51 days, which is 90% IV. And then down here, it's 61.
2599.32s: So you can assume at the 60 would have been like 60 something. So there's still a pretty big gap
2605.00s: here. So in the 60 day time frame, there's still a move in the different terms. And then in the 90 day
2611.80s: time frame, there's still a move. It's just less. And then as you go further and further out in time,
2616.60s: the movements shrank down into effectively what you see here, which is pretty much flat,
2623.16s: which is again, this is one of the important nuances when you're doing stuff like trying to trade
2631.32s: vol. Oh, I'm an idiot. They literally have a tool up here. This is awesome. That shows us
2636.68s: of all for different terms. Let's take a look at, yeah, so like 30 day, you can see this is taking us
2645.48s: back to 30 December. So it's given us about six months. And you can see compared to like the time
2655.00s: frame here, front wall is super low, right? Because this is where it's at relative. Let's take a look at
2660.44s: 90 day vol. It's 90 day vol is also quite low. But if you take a look at the variance here,
2670.60s: it's a completely different scale because the variance here is from 113 down to 55. And if you go
2679.72s: to 90 days, this is 113 down to 70. So a 15 point gap between 30 day and 90 day front wall.
2692.04s: And then if we go to 365, you'll notice that it's actually kind of right in the middle of the
2697.64s: range. So this is at 76, whereas six months ago is at 93. So actually quite tight and funny enough,
2708.04s: the vol in those leaps based on your the original concept we were talking about with Colin,
2713.88s: this actually looks like the the vol Michael lower. So that would be the ultimate irony with
2720.20s: this kind of idea is that placing this trade based on 30 day vol, 30 day vol definitely looks
2727.16s: like it might revert up, but this looks like it might go down. So that I I'm chuckling about that
2734.12s: because options can be so fucking tricky where the idea that Colin had was good. Like that's a
2744.52s: it's a good idea. But it's a really good expression of how without a pretty good understanding of
2751.40s: options, how even a good idea can lead to losing money. It's that nuanced. Gary says got a couple
2762.52s: leaps only because I'm expecting price to go up to 60. Yeah. And that's a completely different
2766.44s: thing is the funny thing is depending on when the leaps were bought, they might have been bought
2773.40s: very expensive relative to what it was recently. But if you take a look, this is another thing when
2780.04s: we talk about something like Vega. Vega is an option sensitivity to changes involved. So even though
2787.00s: the gross changes here aren't as much, these options are way more sensitive to these changes.
2793.56s: It's like a scale. Does that make sense? What I just said, if not, let me know.
2800.60s: What I'm talking about there is Vega. So when you go further out in time, these will have
2808.76s: higher Vega, greater Vega, which is premium change per 1% change,
2822.76s: involve. So the Vega is going to be greater for longer term options. Vega here
2829.88s: is lower. So when you see a larger Vega range here, and this might have a smaller Vega range,
2844.68s: Vega can still impact the premium of this option more. And it's because the Vega on these longer
2854.68s: term options is so much higher. So let's look at an example together.
2864.68s: If we look at the Vega for 15 Jan 27, I'm just going to look at the calls. Vega here is 0.105
2873.88s: for 566 days expiration for these leaps, 1.105. And then if we take a look at 20 days
2881.24s: for the at the money, Vega is 0.022. So Vega is about 5 times higher for these.
2895.00s: So what that tells you is that even though the total range is smaller in terms of changes
2904.12s: in the user's involvement, it will have bigger impacts when they do happen out here.
2911.96s: So to make that example complete, actually I'll use Google Sheet real quick.
2927.40s: I think it'll be easier.
2934.84s: We'll find a spot right here. So we just said this is for the at the money we have two different
2942.28s: Vegas. So let's say under like let's say that we have two explorations, two different terms.
2950.44s: We will have the 20 day and then 566 day. And then let's say that we have IV
2962.12s: and input change in IV.
2973.40s: Vega. And then we'll have premium change.
2980.68s: And this is the assumption that we're going to use a similar delta. So I'm going to move this
2991.80s: off to the side really fast so we can solve for this. So let's do like 50 delta. The 49 delta is
2999.80s: the 40s way out here. And the Vega for these is 0.117. This is the 566 day. So 0.117.
3010.12s: And then the vol for I'm just going to use the expiration is 79.84%.
3018.68s: 79.84% and then for 20 days going to that 50 delta or the closest to 50 delta that we can find
3028.68s: which are these 24s or Vegas 0.022.
3036.60s: IV for the expiration itself 66.13.
3046.12s: So now what we can do
3048.20s: is we can simulate different changes in
3057.32s: vol to figure out how these two relate to one another. So let's say that we get a 10 point change
3068.20s: in front vol and a 2 point change in back vol. So if we want to calculate what the change in
3076.04s: premium is here we would simply take the total change that we're getting. Multiply that by
3083.48s: our Vega. Multiply that by 100. This is 401 lot. So you're getting $22 of Vega here.
3091.80s: And then if we replicate that here you're getting 2340. So what do you what do you notice here?
3098.76s: You notice that even though the IV change the actual change in 566 day vol is so much lower. The 5th
3111.16s: yet it has a greater resulting Vega impact and that's because it has a higher sensitivity to volatility.
3124.28s: A little bit heavy. So I'm going to take a pause there. What questions do you have?
3136.20s: This is obviously more so for the for the options folks out there.
3149.32s: What questions you guys have does that make sense? I explained that that well.
3153.24s: I would I would honestly be shocked. I tried to explain it well. Well, I always try to explain it well.
3159.16s: But this shit's a little tricky. So I feel for you guys.
3169.00s: Okay, so it looks like I'm not seeing anything. So you guys are good. So to summarize all of that
3177.72s: what I'm showing you is that there is a different volatility for different terms.
3185.32s: Okay. And we know that Vega increases the further out in time you go. So the sensitivity to changes
3195.80s: further out in time is greater. So that means even as the terms the vol changes differently
3203.96s: between them and on the tail end it doesn't change that much typically. That means even on a small
3211.96s: change you can absolutely find that you get a bigger change in your premium as a result of Vega
3222.76s: than a much larger move in the front. So Vega and really term structure this is this is what term
3233.80s: structure is. It's really, really, really important to understand term structure and option is trading.
3239.08s: I'm actually probably going to clip this section to make a standalone video on it because I think that
3244.28s: especially using something like GameStop is such a great example for this and it'll be a good reference
3249.80s: I think for people. Lauren says wait waiting Vega isn't always higher further out right.
3263.88s: It generally is. It's not always but it generally is. The reason why I say not always is because it
3273.88s: depends on what we are normalizing off of. So here's what I mean by that. If we pick a strike.
3285.32s: So let's say that we're going to pick the 20 let's say that we're going to pick the 40 strike.
3292.68s: For these front options the Vega is 0.006. We go all the way out here to the 40s the Vega here
3302.04s: is 0.117. Okay fine. So for stuff that's round about the money this is generally speaking what
3312.20s: you're going to find. The only instance where you might find some nuance to this is if you have an
3320.68s: option that is very little extrinsic value. So that can skew things if there is some sort of expected
3329.56s: event but those get into like very rare environments. In general if you normalize off of Delta or if
3338.36s: you normalize off of strike you're going to find a higher Vega the further out you go essentially always.
3344.92s: But there are there are nuances.
3355.96s: GP says why are far dated calls more sensitive to changes involved. It's a great question really great
3365.40s: so let's reason our way there. If we break down I'm so stoked by the way on this session because
3377.16s: this is this is like really useful option stuff I think. So I I'm really really glad that we're
3384.44s: talking about this. So if we think of VAL we have the premium of an option premium premium is
3396.52s: broken down into two buckets intrinsic extrinsic. Intrinsic is simply how far in the money.
3407.16s: Extrinsic is time and VAL. So we know that volatility plays inside time and we can reason through this.
3425.16s: If I were to try and guess what the weather is going to be tomorrow versus what the weather is
3432.92s: going to be a year from now. Which one of those guesses is probably going to be more accurate
3441.32s: naturally speaking.
3445.00s: Likely the guess for tomorrow right I can base it off of what's happening today I can reason my way
3452.12s: and it will probably be closer than what I'm guessing further out in time. So what I'm showing you
3458.84s: is that as time expands as we're trying to forecast moves over longer durations we expect greater variance.
3471.64s: Okay now if we think about where this variance impacts in terms of an option it impacts the
3483.96s: option in the extrinsic value. So if an option has more time it is a larger portion of its value
3493.48s: that can be impacted by this expected variance. So this is why you see options that are
3500.92s: further out in time have higher Vega in more sensitivity to their term implied volatility.
3506.92s: I'm emphasizing that comment of term volatility. It's not the IV that most of us
3514.84s: when we say IV most of us were talking about the underlying IV which is 30 days.
3524.44s: ZXBorg says intuitively seems like leaps there's more time for volatility to affect actual price
3531.64s: calling it Vega is just a way of measuring the effect.
3536.28s: More time for volatility to affect. Yeah I think that that's a really good intuitive way to
3541.88s: think of it ZXBorg I like that. Yeah. GPs says my understanding is leaps are still a good
3550.28s: buy at low 30 30 IV because of Vega. This is incorrect for literally what we just discussed.
3563.96s: The reason why the way you're framing that is incorrect is because again to give you this example
3574.84s: if we take a look at how much 30 day VAL has changed compared to 365 day VAL right which is
3590.28s: the furthest out this has. If I go back and I take a look at the total change in the last two days
3598.60s: VAL 30 day VAL went from 76 essentially 76 10 to 76 and then further out in time went from 56 to
3615.88s: 55.2 so a bigger change here day over day yet if we go further back and we take a look at the change
3625.16s: here 30 day VAL goes from 74 365 goes from 81 81 to 76 74 to 55 so basing a long duration
3641.88s: option trade based on 30 day VAL doesn't make sense.
3647.56s: Because what 30 day VAL does like this is actually an even better example because take a look at
3657.56s: this 30 day VAL if I plot and I do horizontal lines here if I plot a horizontal line here or
3666.20s: about what I can get for a horizontal line that's 30 day VAL if I plot a horizontal line here
3672.92s: that's 365 day VAL so if I get rid of this this spot is about literally the middle of this range
3686.04s: so if we were to IVP this we would call it about 50% maybe a little bit lower maybe 40%
3693.88s: but if we do this comparatively for 30 day VAL 30 day VAL right now is literally at 2%
3700.68s: and the reason why it's at 2% is because it's literally at the very bottom of in this case this
3706.60s: is looking at six months most of the time when we're using stuff like implied volatility percentile
3711.08s: and stuff like that we're using a longer term time frame we're typically using one year
3719.16s: so GP let me know if you have any follow-ons based on that so the summation for that is
3728.20s: leaps are not a good or are not a bad buy based on 30 day VAL leaps are completely indifferent
3737.80s: to not completely but generally indifferent kind of completely actually to 30 day VAL because
3744.60s: again this is a perfect example if you take a look at where these two are in their relative ranges
3752.28s: 365 day VAL is about halfway again maybe 40% to 50% 30 day VAL is at the very bottom that's
3761.80s: very different very very different in terms of volatility behavior
3767.80s: now based on that little calculator we just made we can see what the total premium change would be
3775.08s: at a curiosity GP says 30 IV percentile same same if you use 30 IV or 30 IV percentile it's
3785.88s: the same mistake again literally it's the same exact thing it's just the way to think about
3791.32s: implied volatility percentile is that it's this is implied volatility percentile this white line
3799.48s: that's effectively what implied volatility percentile is all we're doing is plotting what the
3804.76s: current VAL is relative to the past year that's all so being 30 if 30 implied volatility percentile
3817.80s: or 30 IV raw it's the same it's the same inaccuracy and the reason why it's in inaccuracy is again
3825.88s: because if we take a look at how long-term VAL is behaved it's gone a completely different direction
3832.68s: than 30 day VAL right take a look at this period here long-term VAL in this move it jacked
3840.36s: from 65.8 to 81.4 by take a look at 30 day VAL instead for that same effective move
3850.76s: it went from 83 down to 58 they literally went different directions so if you're basing a long-term
3860.44s: based on 30 day VAL you're literally basing it on the wrong thing
3868.52s: ZXBORK says if you buy deep a yo thank you brand-in for the dollar 99 that will go to my door
3876.76s: dash driver tonight really appreciate that ZXBORK says if you buy deep in the money leaps
3881.88s: calls as a stock replacement VAL slash X-Trenzic is only a small part of the cost so not as important
3890.84s: this discussion seems more relevant if you're buying out of the money right great instinct
3896.36s: so it's probably more relevant than you might think though unfortunately and I'll show you why
3903.16s: because if we take a look let's grab our handy-dady calculator and let's just literally create a plot
3916.92s: for intrinsic and extrinsic we can break it down very simply
3926.52s: and it's funny because I literally was expecting the stream tonight to be pretty quick but this
3935.88s: is such an awesome topic I'm stoked
3944.92s: so let's take a quick look at the premium here so if we take a look at 18 July and again we're
3953.00s: doing that same we were doing a 50 delta the premium for the 50 delta is 107
3966.60s: oh no let's do in in the money though let's do it in the money let's do a delta of 81 so an
3972.84s: 81 delta here and we'll update the rest of this stuff is 250 I'm gonna call it
3980.36s: woof itty the Vega on this option is .015 the implied volatility for the expiration is 66
3998.76s: we'll get rid of the IV changes and then now let's take a look at the 566 we'll do the same 80 delta
4007.72s: which is this one right here so that puts us at 1130 our Vega is .083
4027.64s: and the expiration vol is I'm just gonna call it 80 okay so what we can do is we can literally
4037.16s: calculate intrinsic and extrinsic values so 23.59 is current spot price so technically I need
4046.84s: the strikes for these
4048.68s: so the 566 strike that puts us at the 18s
4065.88s: and then the 20 day puts us at the 21 and a half
4078.28s: so our intrinsic value is literally just how far in the money we are so we take this minus this
4087.16s: I'm gonna lock this one so I can drag it so this is $2 in the money
4092.28s: oops this is $5.59 in the money and then we can figure out our extrinsic value which is our premium
4102.60s: less intrinsic which is 41 cents here and then our extrinsic value here is 571 so based on what we've
4113.08s: just used based on what we just discussed going back to zxborg do we think that a change in
4127.56s: vol will have a larger impact out here at 566 days expiration or do we think the larger impact
4139.88s: would happen here at 20 day well let's see if we take a look at oh I forgot it's on this one
4150.92s: if we take a look at their change in vol over a set period so let's do from this move so this is
4165.64s: 91.3 vol
4180.60s: and then as of the latest this turned into 55.2 vol
4192.12s: okay
4197.24s: and then for the long duration again this isn't accurate because this is using 365 versus 500 days
4205.96s: but we'll do it anyways so this is 81 and then this is 76.1
4217.96s: so in this specific move the premium change is greater for the 20 days while in this case it's 30 days
4243.56s: compared to the 566 days so the difference in the premium change here is 54 versus 40 and that's
4251.48s: because the vol for the front changed by 36.1 the vol for the back changed by 5 so this scenario where
4260.04s: this can be different is if vol in this case changed instead from 81 to 76 and it went to 73
4269.40s: well all of a sudden we see if vol there changed by 8 points the longer term option
4275.32s: absolutely would have moved more even though it's at an 80 delta and it's really far in the money
4280.12s: if this is at 75 it's close to being the same
4287.80s: if this is 74.5 I mean it's about the exact same so essentially if 20 day vol
4299.08s: moves by 36 points and deep vol moves by 6.5 points they're it's the same Vega impact
4312.12s: so ZX Borg the answer to yours is it does depend on the move on back end vol but you can
4323.08s: absolutely have a move on back end vol that will overwhelm the front move and it's because of
4329.40s: that heightened sensitivity even for a deep in the money option because when you're really far out
4334.12s: in time deep in the money options still have a lot of extrinsic value right so even if we go to
4340.76s: what 99 delta these will still have extrinsic value and this is obviously super high delta right so
4350.12s: if we look at this option here which is a 93 delta it'll have at least like 10 points or
4361.16s: it's 10 points in the money let's just do it really fast
4367.72s: so this one we're looking at a strike price of 10 and the premium on that is 15.5
4377.40s: so this yeah this still has $10 20 dollars 20 dollars of vol so I'm sorry of extrinsic value
4390.12s: which can be played with by vol and that's using again a greater than 90 delta option so if you go
4397.40s: further out in time even deep in the money options will have a lot of extrinsic value relative
4404.44s: to something that's in the front
4408.52s: a GP says I've been using market chameleon for IV percentile for estimating whether option premium
4413.48s: is a good price is an usual whales interpolated IV a better tool for that so so
4421.88s: yeah I wouldn't say it's necessarily a better tool if you're using implied volatility percentile
4427.40s: it's just it's you have to use the right tool right so if you're using something that's like
4434.28s: a really long dated option then it doesn't matter if you use implied volatility percentile
4442.28s: from unusual whales or if you use implied volatility percentile
4447.80s: market chameleon it's just using the wrong tool so I don't know what other tools market chameleon has
4454.84s: if market chameleon has a tool like this that shows you some expectation of volatility or
4464.76s: implied volatility percentile for these different durations then it's essentially the same thing
4471.08s: the way to think about it is that no matter what like software you want to use there
4477.40s: doesn't really matter as much as like you just using the correct tool
4485.72s: so let me know if that answers your question GP if chameleon has something that allows you to plot
4494.12s: implied volatility or implied volatility percentile for different durations
4499.00s: then it's the same thing but in this context it doesn't matter if you used
4503.88s: unusual whales or which I do have an affiliate link for being completely transparent I'm obviously
4510.52s: not pushing them here it's just a tool that I use but yeah I just don't know what market chameleon has
4520.68s: ZX says I also notice you talk a lot about trading certain deltas rather than a strike
4524.36s: is thinking of strikes immaterial and I should be thinking of deltas when I look at a strategy
4528.60s: 100 percent strikes do not matter essentially at all strikes don't matter in the least
4533.64s: a really common new trader mistake is they'll do something like this and let me know if this
4539.40s: is something you've done because it's something that I've done is I would say to myself I think
4544.28s: GameStop is going to 25 so let me go grab a 111 dates expiration I'm gonna grab a 25 strike
4552.76s: option because I think it's gonna go to 125 and it's the complete wrong way to do it that what price
4561.00s: you think it might go to does not matter relative to what strike you pick doesn't matter
4571.08s: the way to think about a strike is it's like just a name that's kind of it it doesn't matter at all
4577.72s: it gives you a value for intrinsic extra intrinsic value so it matters in that capacity
4582.84s: but what ultimately matters is the the Greeks for the option and that's because
4590.28s: that's how you determine how the underlying itself is going to or how the position itself is going to
4599.56s: behave um I still don't fully understand that with delta I mostly do but not 100 percent talk to me
4611.16s: Lauren also Lauren if I oh you're not in the discord anymore I was gonna say you should pop in the
4618.12s: chat so that you can explain explain yourself better but I don't think you're in there so what do you
4627.24s: mean when you say you don't understand that with delta you mean the process of like using delta I
4632.20s: wouldn't just use delta by the way there's no reason to just use delta it's just delta is kind of
4637.24s: like a normalizer once you understand options you kind of have a sense of what the rest of the Greeks
4643.48s: will look like based on what the delta is so for example I know that if I'm looking at if I'm looking
4651.00s: at this and somebody says I bought a 50 delta option that's 202 days out and I'm curious if I
4658.76s: should have gotten the 20 day there's a bunch of things I know out of the gate the first thing I know
4663.00s: is that theta is higher here I know that gamma is higher here I know that Vega is higher here for
4671.00s: that option for that 50 delta option and it's because I know where 50 delta is in relation to the
4677.80s: rest of the options chain and then I know how the rest of the Greeks behave around that point
4682.92s: same thing is if somebody says I'm trading a 111 day option and I'm comparing between a 50 delta
4690.12s: and a 20 delta there's a bunch of things we know about the 50 delta compared to the 20 delta out
4695.56s: in 111 days that we can extrapolate across the other Greeks so the way to think about
4707.96s: really trading options at all is the Greeks allow you to build the position that reflects your idea
4717.88s: it's funny I was on a coaching call earlier today but literally about this exact thing because
4722.60s: in this context somebody was looking to trade another stock except they're looking to trade a
4727.80s: higher velocity near term move that's actually what this calculator was for this one
4733.56s: so this was looking at the spot price of something and we're expecting a 20% move with an expected
4742.92s: holding duration of 20 bucks so what I was doing is calculating what the P&L would be at the
4750.04s: expected move and then saying what's the relevant holding cost between these and which one makes more
4757.56s: sense based on that right so in this case we can see this scenario here for whatever reason
4765.40s: the holding cost in terms of theta is higher for this near dated option however because of what you
4773.72s: get from delta and gamma specifically gamma which provides complexity if you get the move that you're
4779.16s: looking for you make way more money with this so even though it has a higher holding cost
4785.88s: it nets out way better than this so this is the process of using the Greeks to fine tune the idea
4793.64s: because in this context rather than going to 202 days expiration based on their idea
4800.28s: really what they should have done is gone to 83 days expiration and it's because it represents
4808.12s: their idea much better and it would make a lot more money based on their idea
4815.32s: Lauren says why would you pick a 20 delta over a 50 delta when buying a call that's the part I
4819.80s: don't understand great question so let's take a look at a scenario let's do a 48 day let's do a 50
4827.32s: delta and then let's grab a 20 delta now before I actually show what the impact is here
4834.92s: here somebody in the chat that's familiar with options what can you tell me what are we what are
4840.60s: we about to see if we take a look at these two things compared to one another I don't want to plug
4845.88s: it in yet I want you I want somebody to be able to explain it to me before we look at it
4855.40s: okay Lauren has the first point so the higher delta is going to be more expensive good what else
4864.84s: in this case of 50 delta is going to have a higher gamma
4872.04s: so let's take a look at the scenario and let's see what we see if we take a look at the PNL
4879.24s: this is the 50 delta option right here and let's say GameStop goes up 15 percent this option
4884.60s: makes 202 bucks if we take a look at this other one your option only makes a hundred dollars
4889.88s: that seems kind of shitty doesn't it it's like why would this make why would this make half the
4894.52s: amount of money well it's because if you take a look at the cost the cost here is 71 this is
4902.04s: 171 so what that means is I can literally buy two for the cost of one of these so if I choose to do
4910.84s: that then I'm gaining convexity so if we take a look at what delta is
4923.48s: here if we take a look at delta delta starts to gain this steepness this steepness is gamma
4938.76s: so what ends up happening with a 50 delta option is it will have the highest gamma and then as
4947.48s: an option goes further in the money or out of the money it will have a lower gamma gamma represents
4953.08s: the rate of change of delta so here's the scenario the scenario we were just looking at is don't
4961.24s: worry about the days to expiration we'll use the 30 days to expiration pretend this one doesn't
4966.12s: this is comparing expiration as well so the scenario that we were just looking at is the equivalent
4972.36s: is one person's buying here and then one person is buying here so what's the difference well the
4980.36s: difference is as this goes up the expansion of delta is actually going to slow down because this
4988.20s: option is going to go from being at the money of 50 delta and it's going to start being in the
4992.44s: money it's going to be 60 delta 70 delta so on so the rate of change of delta is actually going
4997.80s: to go down whereas this option as the underlying starts to go up this thing is going to gain a bunch of
5005.32s: gamma and delta and this one's cheaper so we can buy two we can buy three for the cost of one
5013.48s: so the reason why we use sometimes further out of the money options is for a concept we call convexity
5021.32s: and this is convexity it's just kind of flipped from the way that we typically think about it
5026.36s: Lauren says ah room to grow and cheaper can go that's exactly it so if I put on the same dollar
5033.16s: size position between these two I can put on a bigger position that's further out of the money
5038.52s: and then if I get the move that I want I can experience much larger return comparatively speaking
5045.32s: now there's always a trade-off so what's the trade-off here the trade-off is very simple
5051.40s: if we compare this scenario and let's say rather than a 15% move let's say we get a 5% move
5060.04s: a 5% move on the 50 delta option you make 55 bucks a 5% move with two of the 20 delta options
5069.16s: you get 49 you literally make less money on the same move even though you have two options
5076.04s: compared to the one so what this is showing you is in order for those further out of the money
5081.56s: options to pay out you need a bigger move you need more convexity otherwise or I'm sorry you need
5088.20s: a bigger move to tap into the convexity otherwise if you don't get a big enough move then you simply
5094.84s: don't make the money so 50 delta options will make you money faster in terms of how much move is
5103.16s: required whereas further out of the money options have the capacity to compound a lot more
5110.84s: great question
5113.72s: GP says what's the best tool if I buy calls slightly in the money and I buy them at 30 days
5122.68s: expiration 90 if price pumps up to 28 30 in the next two months will IV still pump my premium up
5131.48s: depends on how IV moves and when it comes to the best tool it really does depend on like
5140.84s: what you're using the tool for so I can't I genuinely can't intelligently speak to market
5148.84s: chameleon because I haven't really used it I can speak to the tools that I use which again as you
5156.20s: know one of them is unusual whales and I use it for a bunch of different things so market chameleon
5162.52s: if I'm not mistaken has a ton of capabilities that unusual whales won't have unusual whales is very
5169.40s: option-spocused so I think it really depends on how you use tools I wouldn't view their genuinely
5175.96s: like they're being a quote unquote best I think they're all relative so if you're applying a
5183.32s: certain trading approach I can absolutely see a world where market chameleon might be relatively
5189.16s: better so yeah a bit different Colin says this has been so great thank you that's awesome this I
5197.64s: really think this was actually a really really great session for a bunch of different reasons there's
5202.60s: really important stuff that we talked about here in terms of the nuance of trading options that
5209.40s: most most people miss and then they unfortunately have a superficial understanding and then when things
5217.56s: move differently than they expect then they're kind of sitting there left scratching their head
5223.00s: wondering like what the hell happened why why didn't this go the way that I thought it was going to
5227.32s: go so yeah I'm glad that it was useful for you guys but that wraps me up we are about to grab some
5235.00s: dinner and then we're going to the local fair to go blow a bunch of money and have some fun
5240.52s: so as always if you guys have any questions let me know for the outlier pro members we have a
5245.64s: stream set for tomorrow market prep to get us ready for the week ahead newsletters coming out
5251.88s: tomorrow and then also the weekly video is coming out tomorrow and then for a preamble on the weekly
5259.24s: video it's going to be zero dte options trading strategy we'll begin this so be an outlier
5267.88s: as you guys like
