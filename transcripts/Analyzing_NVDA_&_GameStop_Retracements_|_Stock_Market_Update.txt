0.48s: what's up outliers quick Market recap we
2.28s: got two things on the agenda first we're
3.88s: going to talk about well the market then
5.76s: we're going to talk about Nvidia and
6.92s: GameStop because GameStop just so close
10.24s: not quite and we'll talk about that in a
12.48s: minute but looking at the market really
14.32s: quick as a whole really interesting
16.48s: activity across the board spy closed at
19.04s: all-time high 603 Q's within Striking
22.08s: Distance but still lagging and small
24.56s: caps is now also at 3month highs which
27.60s: is really interesting that small caps
30.12s: are now picking up a lot of Steam on a
33.28s: 3mon time frame compared to Q's vix is
36.24s: down super low 13 and a half bonds up a
40.32s: bit Bitcoin also capturing highs it came
43.80s: in uh MBT it looks like it hit a high
47.24s: today of what
50.28s: 10,325 something like that so overall
53.60s: super super strong performance across
56.36s: the board so what's going on here well
59.52s: it looks like within the market there's
62.76s: a a bunch of undertones that we can see
65.48s: and as you look across the different
66.84s: sectors you can see this coming out in
68.92s: HD so we're seeing real estate really
73.20s: capturing a lot of trend strength here
76.68s: it's approaching 3-month highs it's
78.80s: still lagging a little bit but not all
81.12s: that long ago it was literally at 3mon
83.44s: lows so this is a super strong move that
85.76s: we're seeing in real estate and then
87.72s: Staples and discretionary that Rel
89.92s: relationship is still kind of
91.60s: interesting to me we have xlp is still
94.00s: quite a ways off of 3-month highs XL y
98.00s: is at three-month highs so kind of just
100.68s: interesting undertones from a tech
102.92s: perspective Comm Services is still the
105.12s: leader within Tech and you can see xlk
107.96s: is lagging a little bit so lots to do as
111.56s: per usual with the market there's a ton
113.32s: to take a look at we'll get to GameStop
115.00s: in just man that's ugly candle but we'll
116.64s: get to GameStop in just a second let's
118.08s: take a quick look at Nvidia first
120.36s: and nvidia's kind of been the Talk of
122.56s: the Town today and this week for a few
125.08s: different reasons it had okay earnings
127.76s: like there wasn't anything that stood
129.28s: out to me when it reported earnings that
131.36s: looked super soft anything like that it
133.92s: beat EPS it was expected at 0.7 came in
138.16s: at
138.80s: 0.81 and I know that this is a little
141.60s: lagged but you can see that the market
145.24s: definitely started reacting off of that
148.92s: and then we had some other highlights
151.40s: stuff like this where it was really
154.96s: starting to take shape as some of trump
157.44s: policies were being released and
159.00s: discussed and we're starting to
161.84s: understand and have an understanding of
164.20s: what these different tarff structures
166.84s: might look like and for a while there
169.56s: was a lot of concern about some of the
172.08s: Tariff conversations Trump was having
174.04s: around China and he actually came in a
176.72s: little bit softer I think than a lot of
178.72s: people expected to start now that
180.72s: doesn't mean that this doesn't ramp up
182.16s: in some sort of really big way but it
184.48s: does mean that the additional tariff on
187.64s: top of existing tariffs didn't come in
190.40s: as heavy as originally forecasted
193.00s: because Trump was throwing around some
194.92s: pretty big numbers for stuff like China
198.00s: so we can see here um it's this is from
201.60s: benzinga and it says stock is up Friday
204.32s: amid reports indicating the US
205.56s: government is set to announce further
207.28s: sanctions on exporting semiconductor
209.80s: equipment and AI memory chips to China
212.16s: which would be less stringent than the
214.36s: previous ones so we also have a little
217.48s: bit of easing across the board
220.60s: specifically any sort of sanctions that
223.08s: existed previously it you can see here
226.52s: it says us embargo will focus on Chinese
228.68s: companies that make semiconductor
229.92s: manufacturing equipment instead of the
231.84s: fabrication facilities following
233.84s: protests so the semiconductor sector in
237.68s: general has been under a lot of fire we
239.36s: also know that there's a big big push
240.88s: for domestication of semiconductor
243.36s: production there's government
245.88s: initiatives and incentives to drive that
249.24s: behavior but the problem with stuff like
251.12s: that is it takes time it's not going to
252.48s: be super fast in order to get a really
255.76s: well defined and refined system to
259.92s: produce really quality semiconductors it
263.48s: really the supply chain component it
265.52s: takes time to build that that's why
267.80s: places like Taiwan have such a strangle
270.44s: hold on it because they've built the
272.48s: infrastructure to get it down to an
274.36s: absolute science and interestingly
277.04s: enough even something like
278.00s: semiconductors there's a lot of pass
280.52s: down knowledge in terms of the
281.96s: production process that isn't
283.64s: necessarily able to just be lifted and
285.32s: shifted super easily getting the right
287.36s: experience around to do a good job on
290.16s: chips like that is not simple so let's
294.68s: check out a little bit here it says uh
296.96s: the fresh restrictions will follow
298.32s: months of negotiations between the US
300.36s: government allies Japan Netherlands and
302.24s: American chip equipment makers the US
303.80s: chip companies including Nvidia and
306.20s: Rivals had previously urg the government
308.40s: to relax its embargo against China a key
310.68s: semiconductor market and this just goes
312.72s: back to show how intertwined the
316.00s: different countries and it's interesting
318.44s: because obviously from a military
319.80s: background we spent a lot of time War
322.68s: gaming against places like China because
325.28s: they're a massive threat
327.36s: meanwhile we literally struggle to
330.00s: manufacture chips without them which is
333.60s: a little bit scary if you think about it
336.00s: so understanding the supply lines is
339.48s: really crucial because there's a lot of
341.88s: really great trade opportunities
343.68s: specifically in stuff like Nvidia that
345.88s: got beaten down pretty hard here it was
347.96s: at 152 and it fell down into the 130s
350.68s: that's not a small contraction and
353.16s: that's a decent correction I think and
355.68s: it's something that I really like to the
357.36s: upside long term still you can see where
359.76s: my downside original Target was just for
362.48s: a premature exit if needed and now this
365.56s: actually gets a chance to move up
367.96s: because I think that long term it still
370.64s: looks really strong to me it's
372.84s: just fighting a lot of unknowns which
376.04s: can provide some opportunities for the
378.04s: enterprising Traders okay now over to
381.72s: GameStop the reason why we got to talk
383.24s: about this is because GameStop had a
384.96s: banger of a week and I know a lot of
388.64s: people are pretty bummed to see that it
391.36s: wasn't able to hold
393.40s: 30 this doesn't concern me it really
396.40s: doesn't concern me yet because GameStop
399.52s: has had a insane Rally from down here
404.48s: remember just the end of last month it
408.12s: was in the 20s and now it's in the 30s
411.80s: and I know again for people that are
413.20s: used to playing Super volatile stocks
415.92s: that go all over the place that can
417.60s: double in a month and stuff like that I
421.00s: understand this might seem less
422.60s: impressive to you but this is great for
424.60s: me the reason why it's great for me is
426.60s: because it's good to see the company
428.52s: moving as a normal company this isn't
431.16s: being overly driven by structural forces
434.76s: there's a lot going on in here and you
436.80s: can see this is the same I haven't
438.52s: redrawn this range this is the exact
440.60s: range I expected it to trade in for some
443.56s: time and it's not because they're round
445.40s: numbers of 25 and 30 it's because I use
448.68s: reference ranges on previous places that
451.56s: it transacted heavily so what I think is
455.40s: going on here is profit taking and
457.20s: rightfully so that's what happens is as
460.16s: something starts to appreciate and it
462.28s: starts to look pretty strong people that
464.84s: got in all the way down here are happy
467.44s: to take their 10 plus dollar gain in a
471.00s: few months and then move on to something
473.16s: else so kind of those weak hands get
475.32s: shaken out a little bit and then the
477.32s: stronger hands will continue to persist
479.00s: and continue to scoop it up now the big
481.44s: thing for me is does it consolidate here
484.68s: and it's TBD big red candle today I
487.32s: don't like that candle today it's not
489.20s: crazy but a 6% down move in a day is
491.40s: nothing to scoff at so I would love to
494.32s: see these moving averages maintain this
496.16s: alignment you can literally see that we
498.08s: just got full ma alignment where it's a
500.64s: short term above a slightly shorter or
503.16s: longer term above a slightly longer term
505.16s: above the longest term all positive
506.92s: sloping that's all good A lot's going to
510.00s: depend on how Monday looks that's just
512.00s: how this is going to work because if it
514.88s: can consolidate in here that's great
516.92s: news if this starts a massive
519.44s: retracement that's less great news and
522.08s: it is too early to tell from my
524.56s: perspective as always in the GameStop
526.92s: Community everybody's interested in
529.08s: being the person that guesses what
531.36s: something is going to do before it
532.76s: happens which is always a fun game but
534.84s: for me it's not the way I approach
536.24s: markets it's not the way that I trade
537.68s: because I don't really care what random
540.64s: guesses are I care about creating
542.68s: probabilistic assumptions to try to
544.12s: trade off of those so there's lots of
546.28s: people I've seen throwing different kind
547.60s: of numbers around and you know you can
550.56s: believe what you want to believe there's
552.00s: nothing wrong with trying to forecast
553.60s: where things might go but just always
556.12s: remember right like Price is Right that
559.08s: means whatever price is at the time even
561.76s: if you don't like it even if you think
563.16s: it's manipulated it is what it is so
565.60s: from a trading perspective you have to
567.20s: roll with that from a market structure
569.56s: perspective that's different I
571.72s: understand a lot of the concerns people
573.44s: have with some of the pricing issues and
575.64s: we've been diving into that on the
577.36s: Saturday live streams where we're going
579.04s: through all of the old DD we have
580.56s: another live stream tomorrow going
582.24s: through GameStop and I can definitely
583.92s: see a lot of the concerns that people
586.08s: have rightfully so but I'm talking two
588.60s: different lenses there's a trading lens
590.84s: which is how do we interface with
593.16s: something to make money as it moves and
595.24s: then there's the structural lens which
596.92s: is where obviously we're taking a peek
598.80s: at some of the less upstanding activity
602.52s: going on on the back end which that we
604.24s: don't like to see so let's take a quick
606.84s: look now at the options chain because I
610.88s: saw this pop
613.12s: up interesting
615.44s: a so we had a few really big
620.24s: transactions today really big
622.48s: transactions today so if I get rid of
625.08s: this from the week and I just look at
626.52s: today take a look at the size of these
628.60s: top few trades trades this is a $1.8
631.12s: million trade and this is a
633.96s: $532,000 trade those are big trades now
638.44s: we can see that some of these are still
640.12s: further out in time though right so
642.32s: these are out in 2025 so these are
644.28s: people playing longer term price moves
646.88s: now I don't know I and I haven't done
648.92s: the research on those 40s to see where
652.04s: it's likely that they got in at but my
655.64s: guess is that's out of profit that's a
657.20s: pretty healthy profit that that person
659.32s: just pulled down and again rightfully so
662.84s: because if we can do a little bit more
665.76s: due diligence on this in the in maybe
667.64s: the live stream tomorrow to see
669.76s: exactly where we think these guys came
672.32s: in and at and what they're doing but
674.96s: this is looking like a really solid
677.04s: trade just straight profit taking but a
679.04s: $ 1.82 million trade that's one of the
681.48s: biggest we've seen in some time this is
684.32s: abnormal that popped up on a couple of
685.96s: my alerts and same thing with this 500k
687.80s: trade and
690.00s: this one also looks to be profit-taking
692.72s: that would be my guess but it's hard to
695.16s: say because it's closer to the ask right
698.92s: so if you look the the spread here is 20
701.52s: cents they came in you know right dead
704.64s: center it's I meant to say it's not
706.32s: closer to the ass sorry it came in dead
708.92s: center so that really means we we don't
712.84s: know where this trade hit in terms of if
716.12s: they're offloading or getting into my
718.72s: guess would be offloading and that's
721.00s: just because this is a standard place to
723.08s: take profit taking for positional
724.60s: Traders like myself so I can totally see
727.20s: the angle here so all eyes on Monday to
731.60s: see if we maintain this kind of range
735.20s: and I think the range is pretty broadly
736.92s: defined at this point we have a little
738.72s: bit of leeway to go around but I'd love
740.24s: to see it hang out in here and then we
742.28s: do know that
743.52s: earnings is now the 10th confirmed it
746.08s: moved out we could obviously see that in
747.68s: the options chain but they they
749.80s: confirmed it this time so we are coming
752.24s: into earnings soon enough but we have a
754.12s: little bit more of a standoff distance
756.24s: if we take a look
758.88s: at the what is this one the 6th of
762.76s: December is at
765.36s: 118% Vol 13 D is at 140 and then 20 D
770.28s: Drops to 128 so there's still pretty
772.80s: heavy all in the front definitely around
774.64s: earnings obviously and the transactions
777.40s: today were really really really C have
779.36s: you but take a look most of them are
781.44s: calls that are being sold standard
783.64s: profit taking there's nothing here that
785.04s: jumps out that I'm like super concerned
787.28s: thinking that GameStop's going to crash
788.56s: or anything it's likely GameStop is
790.68s: going to continue moving around as
791.88s: Traders continue to trade what what else
794.20s: would we expect but it does have super
796.60s: heavy call oi relative to put oi which
799.20s: you always love to see and keep an eye
802.60s: out for Monday if you guys want me to
803.96s: take a look at anything or if you have
805.20s: any questions let me know be an outlier
806.96s: I'll see youall later
