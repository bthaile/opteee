0.32s: hey everyone eric here up next is a
2.48s: pretty fun topic which is trading
4.32s: in your iras so let's jump over to the
7.28s: main screen
8.16s: and dig in so first off the very first
11.12s: thing i have on here
12.40s: is if you are interested in setting up a
16.24s: roth
16.80s: ira do yourself a favor and make sure
20.16s: you do it as soon as possible and max it
23.76s: out as frequently as possible and
27.04s: here's the reason why i'm gonna pull up
29.44s: a quick overview that
31.20s: reviews roth iras versus traditional
35.36s: so if you take a look traditional is on
37.92s: this side
38.64s: roth is on this side same thing
40.48s: traditional's here
42.16s: and then roth is over here and that's
45.12s: with the mouse so
46.00s: don't make fun of the handwriting any
47.44s: more than we already need to
49.76s: um most of it is going to look pretty
52.88s: similar
53.68s: but there is a very significant
56.88s: difference in income eligibility
60.08s: and that is right here so the reason why
63.36s: it's important to
64.48s: start in your roth as soon as possible
68.88s: is once you hit 124k
72.08s: if you file single
75.84s: or 196 if you file jointly
80.24s: once you hit those thresholds and you
81.92s: move over you
83.28s: cannot contribute to the account anymore
87.12s: so what happens is you can get
90.24s: stuck with a certain amount of money in
92.32s: that account
93.52s: and you're going to essentially
94.88s: completely rely on your ability to
96.64s: develop the account
97.76s: for the accumulation of wealth in there
100.32s: so
102.00s: big recommendation if you are going to
103.52s: trade roth iras
105.28s: start as soon as possible give yourself
107.36s: as much time to continue max it out
110.00s: before you hopefully hit these
111.84s: thresholds it's like i said once you hit
113.84s: there
114.24s: like i can't add any more to the account
116.72s: so it's stuck
117.84s: i can only trade what's in there and it
119.92s: is what it is
121.12s: now the good part is you can always have
123.04s: a traditional ira
124.64s: which is nice so once you finish your
127.12s: time in your roth or you can even have
128.96s: them both simultaneously
130.64s: you know you can still do the
132.88s: traditional now something to keep in
134.56s: mind is you're
135.92s: you're still going to be limited on the
138.64s: amount you can
140.00s: apply to roth i mean sorry not roth
143.36s: that you can apply to ira accounts so
146.56s: keep that in mind don't start maxing out
148.48s: both because you're going to find
149.60s: yourself in a bad spot
150.80s: you can you get up to that amount for
153.52s: iras
154.24s: in general not whether it's roth
157.28s: or traditional
162.08s: so moving on to a couple i don't know i
164.32s: guess just quick overview of what i like
165.92s: to do couple things
167.52s: first one is i typically trade cash
170.72s: secured positions in there
173.12s: but there is a loophole which is
176.00s: interesting enough
177.04s: that it exists because it's for futures
180.00s: which
180.80s: you know the idea of forcing people to
183.04s: not be able to trade on
184.00s: margin in a roth account is obviously
187.36s: for the security of the account to make
189.36s: sure that it's less volatile things like
191.12s: that
191.44s: kind of protect you against yourself
194.72s: forces people into less volatile trading
196.84s: styles but
198.56s: you can trade futures i can trade
200.64s: options on futures i can sell naked
203.12s: calls on futures just can't do it with
205.76s: options
207.04s: no idea why it exists but it is helpful
209.84s: to know that
210.72s: it is there in case you want to
212.16s: speculate in your ira
214.00s: you most certainly can you just need to
215.68s: use futures
217.28s: now something else to keep in mind is if
220.48s: slash when you do trade features in your
222.24s: ira
223.20s: it requires 125 of standard margin
227.68s: so they're gonna essentially force you
230.08s: to have
231.04s: more money that you would have to set
233.20s: aside for those trades than you would
235.52s: see in you know your standard margin
238.24s: account portfolio margin so on so forth
240.24s: so just keep that in mind
242.48s: my general focus is coverage strangles
245.44s: that's
246.16s: 99 of the trades that i'm gonna put on
248.88s: in my iras
250.64s: and with that i just looked at the
252.56s: accounts and
254.00s: i have averaged from 2007 19 15.2
257.36s: percent
258.24s: so it's not as high as my general margin
260.00s: account by a fair
262.32s: margin sorry for the pun but
265.52s: that part aside it's still slightly
267.36s: above the market
268.88s: and you know it just shows that using
271.20s: options kind of in a very conservative
272.88s: manner we can still
273.84s: enhance our returns modestly over the
275.68s: market but
277.52s: again kind of fall fall within the rules
280.96s: of the ira structure so
284.48s: that's pretty much all i have for this i
286.80s: don't
287.52s: really believe in actively trading the
289.12s: ira this is where i put a lot of my
290.96s: slower trading things and i focus on my
292.80s: margin accounts
294.40s: or more actively trading and like i said
297.84s: just keep in mind
298.96s: the amount that you can contribute to
301.52s: all
302.00s: iras is 6 000 a year as of right now
305.20s: so if you're interested in a roth i
308.16s: would focus on that
309.60s: get that thing going and continue to max
311.60s: that out until you hit that threshold
313.76s: then when you can't add to that anymore
315.76s: then you can rotate over to a
317.12s: traditional if you feel like it
319.04s: just keep that in mind if you do use
320.48s: roth once you hit that
322.24s: threshold you're stuck and then the
324.08s: other thing to keep in mind like i said
325.76s: is the future's trading
326.96s: if you do want to speculate you can use
328.80s: futures but other than that it's going
331.20s: to behave a lot like a regular account
333.04s: it's just going to force you to be cash
334.32s: secured
335.20s: so you're not going to be able to trade
336.56s: on margin for options
338.72s: so that is essentially my approach i
341.44s: keep it really simple in there nothing
342.96s: crazy
343.68s: if anybody has any questions or anything
345.28s: that they like to add on what they like
346.80s: to do
347.68s: in their iras feel free to chime in let
350.24s: me know
351.04s: and i'll catch everybody later
