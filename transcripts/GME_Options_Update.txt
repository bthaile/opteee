0.56s: what's up everyone happy Monday we're
2.08s: going to take a look at the GameStop
4.16s: options chain couple things going on
6.40s: nothing really jumping out of me just
8.20s: yet it seems we're vastly kind of in
10.40s: this consolidation phase but before we
12.96s: get too far into that just a couple
14.24s: announcements the first one is if you
16.80s: haven't seen this video with Ian on Jame
19.12s: Lee's channel it's very good and I
23.08s: really like the way that he breaks down
26.08s: a lot of the totality of the story it's
29.08s: a very simple concept ceps so if you
31.12s: haven't had a chance to listen to this I
34.40s: think it's worth worth to listen it's
36.24s: like 15 minutes the other one that I
38.56s: actually think you need to watch is
40.68s: Newton's new video and it's not just cuz
42.48s: he has some super sick hair that's on
44.72s: fleek with Snorlax behind them it's
47.36s: because he talks a little bit towards
49.32s: the end of this video about the swaps
51.64s: this is important and I actually think
54.00s: that this is something I've been doing
55.28s: more research on myself so it's funny
57.20s: timing that he was talking about it here
60.56s: because it talks about the positions
62.96s: that we think some of these different
65.00s: actors and entities might be in and then
67.96s: the way that they need to move about
70.28s: these positions with respect to GameStop
72.20s: price so absolutely worth checking this
75.12s: out all right that aside and the
78.08s: actually the last thing is this Saturday
80.12s: same time same place uh 1700 Pacific
83.12s: time he and I are going to do another
84.92s: live stream so that we can go even
86.24s: further into detail this past weekend
88.20s: was a really great introduction I had a
90.16s: hard stop so we didn't get to go super
92.32s: far into the Weeds on things so the goal
95.56s: for this next one is to spend a lot more
97.36s: time looking at the details and then
99.92s: also setting a little time to kind
102.56s: active analysis right like see how this
104.56s: story is actively playing out there's so
107.32s: much history that has to get gone
108.84s: through in order to level set everybody
110.60s: so we got a good bit of that done last
112.48s: weekend and yeah I'm looking forward to
114.96s: connecting with him again I learned
116.64s: literally a ton it is a great time being
119.64s: able to kind of be a part of this with
121.36s: you guys all right over to the GameStop
124.48s: as I've said consolidation that's really
126.44s: the the main thing I'm seeing here we
128.16s: hit a swing low on the 1st of July and
131.44s: the low here is
132.80s: 2231 and we've kind of just been in this
135.80s: 2227 A2 range and the one thing I do
139.36s: notice though is that we are uptrending
142.48s: slightly even more interestingly is this
145.92s: we have pretty light volume I'll get
148.32s: myself out of the way we have pretty
150.48s: light volume in here however even though
154.08s: the majority of this volume actually is
157.52s: sell volume for both of these days
160.72s: notice what price is doing not going
163.80s: down it's actually going up a little bit
166.16s: that's anomalous that's
168.56s: abnormal and there's a lot of reasons
171.08s: why that can happen but this could be um
176.92s: a kind of a the the start of a new cat
179.84s: catalyst is what I'm seeing here when
181.88s: you see volume dying off this much with
184.60s: something like GameStop that you know in
186.20s: general people try to short this into
188.88s: Oblivion the fact that even after we had
191.40s: that share offering and price didn't
193.28s: plummet the fact that now we still have
196.08s: really light relative volume that's
198.08s: mostly sell volume and price is still
200.36s: not going down very interesting to me so
204.04s: this is the kind of thing I would keep a
205.52s: really close eye on I actually have
208.24s: another Alert in scans set up
210.52s: specifically around a l a lot of
212.88s: different volume conditions and GameStop
214.92s: and this is one of them I'm paying very
216.32s: close attention to right now let's take
218.60s: a look at the options all right first
221.08s: things first the expiration volatility
224.80s: is very low this is some of the lowest
226.64s: that we've seen since I've started
227.92s: looking at this about a month ago kind
229.72s: of very regularly with you guys and I
233.16s: find that curious especially from where
235.44s: we ended last week with a little bit of
238.12s: an expansion of volatility leading into
240.12s: a holiday week which is also not normal
244.20s: lot of things not normal here um so yeah
247.80s: I thought that was interesting I'm going
249.64s: to skip the VA thing for now and I want
251.56s: to talk to you about the open interest
254.28s: first so after we had the last option
258.64s: expiration cycle Opex on last week we
262.76s: now have a residual call oi of 750,000
266.76s: calls versus 456k puts very heavy call
271.08s: volumes still and if we take a look at
274.12s: where they're centered most of them are
277.08s: actually in 19 July not 12 July which is
281.04s: again slightly anomalous because the
283.12s: vast majority of OI that I've seen so
285.20s: far has been in the near-term expiration
287.88s: even if that near-term expiration
290.44s: happens to be a weekly now again in
292.84s: normal options world you would expect
295.68s: the majority of OI and volume to happen
298.20s: in these month expiration Cycles because
300.96s: they're more
302.04s: liquid now if we take a look at the
304.00s: volume though notice what happens here
307.76s: there's way more of these blue dots
311.36s: which are I guess they're guess they're
313.00s: rectangles not so much dots I do know my
316.36s: shapes the 12 July cycle though is is
320.12s: much more prevalent here as compared to
323.28s: the 19 July cycle which again are the
326.00s: purple
326.92s: squares
328.64s: now what does that mean to me well it
331.12s: means that people are really speculating
333.72s: in these very shortterm time frames
336.56s: that's with the guys of trying to
339.40s: maximize exposure to some degree to a
341.80s: near-term event that's the only reason
344.40s: why you would come all the way in here
345.80s: and trade and stuff that's for DTE as
347.76s: compared to going a little further out
349.80s: is that you expect something imminently
352.40s: now when we look at the relative volume
356.00s: between those two series 12 July saw
358.64s: 88,000 calls versus 19 July which is
362.16s: 41,000 calls so still there's call skew
366.48s: on both of these relative to the put
368.08s: side but there's definitely more
369.24s: activity in these 12 July even though
371.44s: the majority of OI still Falls in this
375.08s: 19 July cycle with 270,000 calls versus
379.00s: 100,000 calls so people are playing the
382.28s: short-term but there is a building and
385.48s: growing position out in the next
387.92s: expiration cycle here in 19 July
390.44s: now a quick stroll through TNS shows a
394.08s: few things I have this limited to calls
397.04s: and I have this limited to things that
399.08s: are at least 50 contracts and above and
402.96s: right now I'm specifically looking at uh
405.80s: put my head here 12 July and 19 July
407.88s: these front two expirations I guess we
409.44s: could add 16 August if we want just for
411.16s: the next primary
412.60s: expiration and what do we see well
414.96s: there's a good bit of activity both in
417.60s: 12 and 19 July at the 25 and 30s I see
421.12s: that all the way through when I kind of
423.44s: scroll through this larger data set now
426.64s: the other thing a couple people have
428.12s: said that this is a little difficult to
429.68s: use which I get my eyes are kind of
432.20s: trained to it but I also have it pulled
435.24s: up here on unusual whales so this is
437.16s: looking at just for July now for unusual
439.60s: whales you have to be careful because
441.76s: what we don't want is stuff that's tied
444.24s: into a multiple like option strategies
446.12s: like spreads verticals stuff like that
447.72s: it doesn't really matter for us so let's
450.60s: limit this then to kind of these front
453.00s: expiration
454.20s: cycles and see what's going on coming up
457.84s: I have this limited to premium being at
459.44s: least $155,000 which I actually argue is
461.72s: still very very small but I'm using that
464.80s: to see if there's anybody building
466.60s: consistent positions over multiple time
469.32s: frames and there's some of that but not
471.72s: much so what I mean by that is like if
473.76s: you look at these blocks in
475.88s: here these 30 calls get hit a few times
480.00s: at similar sizes 24
482.24s: 25k and they're not necessarily you know
486.56s: spread across weeks it's kind of like a
488.76s: day overday sort of movement but yeah
492.12s: it's not
493.36s: necessarily uh like a massive position
495.68s: being built these big positions up here
497.44s: the 198k the 140k they're part of more
500.88s: legs which means it offset risks offsets
504.32s: risk I'm not as interested in those
506.68s: positions I'm interested in things that
509.56s: display conviction in a direction which
511.84s: is essentially buying calls near the
514.08s: offer or above that's what I care about
517.28s: so the
519.72s: 10 what there's 56 of the 10 so these
522.88s: are in the money for this coming week
525.08s: that's a $80,000 position that's not a
527.08s: small position and this is one that I'm
530.48s: keeping an eye on to see if there's any
532.48s: subsequent build out in it but so far
535.68s: it's relatively quiet beyond what we saw
539.16s: here
540.72s: so if we take a look at uh 0633 I think
544.52s: this is Pacific time it is Pacific time
547.00s: we had this first trunch go through then
549.96s: at 0630 I'm sorry this 0630 this was the
553.24s: first one this was the second one my
555.64s: expectation is that this is probably the
557.56s: same entity buying these and that's
560.20s: primarily because it's very specific
562.00s: very close to one another this is
563.48s: typically how you would phase into a
564.92s: position You' get a feel for what the
567.12s: market is and then you would try to
568.84s: scale in the rest of the way then we see
571.68s: it again down here at
574.32s: 064 uh 0633 there's 26 of them at the 10
580.56s: so again like if you just kind of add
583.16s: the numbers up on these they start to
586.12s: build a not insignificant position
589.24s: here's more here at the 10
593.52s: 0630 and I think that's mostly what I
597.40s: saw yeah so let's take a look I'm going
600.44s: to sort this by time really quick and we
603.36s: can take a look at those 10 this is
604.92s: exactly what I'm talking about see how
606.84s: there's a bunch of these blocks like
608.36s: right next to one another there's
611.36s: 06336 twice for 43 and 26 then there's
616.40s: these two 0 630s at 46 again like and
621.20s: these are all direct trades right
623.60s: they're not part of a spread these are
625.88s: very interesting to me because this is
628.36s: not a small small cumulative position so
632.96s: let's take a look really quick at the 12
635.48s: July
637.32s: 10s which are all the way in here super
640.04s: deep in the
641.28s: money
645.92s: and interestingly enough this accounts
648.96s: there's 160 volume in there today and if
652.52s: we go back to these
654.20s: transactions I think this is like
657.84s: 150 so this person whoever this is is
661.24s: building out the majority of that
662.60s: position and again this is not an
665.68s: insignificant position this is over
668.56s: $200,000 essentially in total so that's
672.56s: something to keep an eye on that is not
674.96s: being put on with anything other than
676.60s: the expectation of an up move is that
679.40s: somebody like roaring kitty it's hard to
681.64s: say it seems like a little bit of a
682.92s: smaller position to him but this is
684.36s: somebody with $200,000 so it's also
688.00s: probably somebody that I would imagine
689.36s: to be fairly informed also because they
692.12s: went so deep in the money they want
693.92s: leveraged Deltas that's what that is
696.64s: that's why they're using essentially one
698.84s: Delta options there's very little
700.32s: extrinsic value to bleed away and this
702.56s: is a directional play to the upside so
705.28s: this is a big position being built out
707.16s: here at the 10 to keep an eye on that is
711.36s: mostly what I see in here when I took a
713.60s: look at the
715.72s: volume and the volatility smile
719.84s: the volume is interesting the volatility
722.12s: smile is also fairly interesting because
724.28s: we have some of these Kinks but the put
726.72s: side is still trending way higher than
728.48s: the call side in both near-term series
730.72s: which is what we have seen as of late so
734.44s: this isn't messaging to me any excessive
737.32s: Vol pricing on the call side factoring
739.92s: and some sort of expectation of upside
741.48s: move this is standard putsu in terms of
745.00s: v on the volatility Smiles so as always
749.72s: if you have any questions let me know
751.32s: keep an eyeball on these 12 July 10s
754.52s: because there's somebody building a
756.48s: sneakingly pretty large position in
758.96s: there be an outlier see you guys later
