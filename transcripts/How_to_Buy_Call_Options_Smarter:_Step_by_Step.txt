0.92s: all of us Traders are degenerates at
3.16s: heart however the goal of this video is
6.04s: to help some of my GameStop people think
9.24s: about buying call options or really any
12.12s: option a little bit differently so that
14.84s: rather than putting on positions that
16.80s: magically vanish in a couple of days and
18.60s: all your money is gone we might actually
21.80s: stand a chance at making some money out
24.20s: here because what we don't want is to be
26.16s: in this scenario of our friend antique
29.04s: marketing who down
31.12s: 99.68% with $32 left to go super
35.04s: unfortunate but who knows they have some
38.28s: apple options expiring this week their
40.12s: payoff might be there my guess is
42.04s: they're probably making a bunch of the
43.68s: mistakes I'm about to walk through with
44.96s: you guys we're going to talk about kind
47.04s: of looking at options a little bit
48.72s: differently through the lens of these
51.24s: three things days to expiration how long
55.08s: the contract lasts the Delta of the
58.76s: option Delta simply measures the rate of
62.36s: change of an options premium for every
65.16s: one1 doll move in the underlying and
67.64s: then gamma which is simply the rate of
70.80s: change of Delta so I am not going to get
74.48s: super theoretical here my goal is to
76.16s: keep this as practical as possible so
78.48s: with that let's get straight over into
81.40s: the platform and we're going to grab
84.00s: GameStop and dig right in okay so the
88.08s: first thing to know is you notice the
89.48s: first thing on our list is picking DTE
91.76s: days to expiration what expiration makes
94.40s: the most sense here's the way to think
95.96s: about it the further out in time you go
100.00s: the more expensive extrinsic value gets
103.68s: for
104.52s: options also the slower gamma will move
110.36s: which matters specifically for outof the
112.24s: money options and I'll explain how so
115.16s: that's the first thing the further out
117.36s: in time you go the more expensive the
119.40s: options get because there's more
121.20s: extrinsic value gamma has a dampened
124.84s: effect what's the benefit your trade now
128.84s: has a longer time to work although your
132.72s: Theta Decay will be higher in a gross
136.24s: dollar amount your daily Theta Decay as
139.20s: a percent of the resulting premium will
142.40s: be less so let's take a look at exactly
144.04s: what that means if we go out here to 120
147.60s: days to expiration and we look at really
151.00s: anything let's find this 60 Delta call
154.16s: right now in GameStop so we can see this
157.60s: is gamma this is Theta and I'm
161.64s: specifically focusing on the call
162.92s: options because I imagine that's
164.28s: probably what most of you guys are
165.48s: playing but the same stuff generally
168.24s: applies to the put options as well so if
170.84s: we look at these 60 Delta calls right
174.64s: now they have a 0.02 gamma so that means
177.48s: for every onepoint move in the
179.16s: underlying
180.52s: Delta is going to move by
183.04s: 0.02 everything else remaining the same
186.00s: good old Latin saying cedis parabus now
189.68s: Theta notice what Theta is Nega
193.44s: 0.03 this means as each day that passes
197.28s: these options are going to lose three
199.92s: cents again everything else remaining
202.44s: the same a couple notes that are really
205.48s: important here options that are out of
209.20s: the money
210.28s: are all extrinsic value extrinsic value
213.92s: kind of is two components first
216.48s: component is how much time the second
219.68s: component is volatility how much
221.68s: volatility are we pricing in those
224.00s: options so as you go further out in time
227.40s: the more extrinsic value you will have
230.96s: as you go deeper in the money your
234.64s: options will have more intrinsic value
238.96s: and less
240.28s: extrinsic value they will be a higher
243.52s: Delta so what does all this mean the
246.36s: very first juncture we need to cross is
249.04s: what expiration to pick for me I
252.44s: typically try to go at least greater
254.88s: than 60 days to expiration the reason
257.36s: for that is option Theta Decay starts to
260.56s: really accelerate once we go within 60
263.28s: days so let's take a look at what this
264.56s: looks like again 60 Delta these have a
268.52s: 0.03
270.08s: Theta let's now go into 29 find a 60
273.68s: Delta this is a 62 that's pretty close
276.36s: Theta now is negative 0.07 what do you
279.60s: notice the daily Theta Decay just
283.04s: skyrocketed going from 120 which was 3
286.96s: cents into 29 days to expiration it's
289.88s: double in
290.92s: change 7 cents massive way higher and
295.36s: also what's most important is if you
296.92s: think about your Theta decay 7 cents on
300.72s: a percentage of the premium these are
303.48s: trading for 460 465 something like that
307.00s: they're losing 7 cents every single day
309.68s: that's a much larger percentage of the
312.00s: total premium that's eroding on a daily
314.36s: basis if we go again out here to the
316.64s: 120s not only is the Theta much lower
320.32s: for the 60s it's again three three cents
324.60s: but look at the price of the options
326.24s: they're much more expensive so as a
328.60s: percentage you're ALS Al losing way less
331.56s: of your total
332.68s: premium so that's the expiration
335.84s: decision to me in general it's kind of
338.60s: just easy if you go at the very least at
341.72s: the very least greater than 30 days out
344.16s: ideally 60 plus for me most of my trades
346.76s: are 90 plus but again I trade these a
349.96s: little bit differently than most people
351.60s: so it might not be a direct Cory I'm
353.84s: just giving you some ballpark to go off
356.40s: of because we need to now talk about G
360.00s: GMA when we're buying
362.56s: options a lot of times people will be
365.28s: lured into these really cheap really far
368.32s: out of the money options like these 21
370.80s: Junes that expire in one day and the
373.92s: 125s where there's
376.20s: 13,000 open interest that's not saying
378.64s: all those people entered today they
379.96s: didn't but a lot of people entered these
382.48s: these are very far out of the money so
385.56s: the reason why we care about Gamma is
388.04s: because gamma tell tells us how fast
391.60s: we're going to see profit if we start
395.04s: getting a big move in our favor because
398.20s: if you remember Delta tells us the rate
400.32s: of change of an options premium so in
402.48s: this case if GameStop moves $1 in our
405.04s: favor this literally is going to move
407.60s: less than a penny there's the Delta is
411.36s: so low in these options that it's going
412.92s: to be a third digit you're not even
415.00s: going to see it the other the other
417.48s: problem here is that as you get that
419.24s: first first dollar move in your favor
421.60s: gamma doesn't even start turning on and
423.96s: what does that mean well if we take a
425.60s: look here something at like a 15 Delta
429.12s: notice what the gamma is
431.08s: 0.06 so that means that if you get a $1
433.64s: move in your favor these options are
435.48s: going to give you 15 cents or $15
438.20s: because the multiplier for options is
441.16s: 100 so you get 15 bucks but something
444.00s: else happened along that this 15 Delta
448.08s: just gains six more Del Deltas so now if
451.24s: you get another dollar move in your
453.12s: favor instead of just seeing 15 cents
455.72s: you now see 21 cents and what do you
459.04s: notice options that are closer to at the
462.04s: money have much higher gamma the other
466.52s: thing you'll notice is options that are
468.56s: closer in time have a much higher gamma
471.84s: so this is 1 DTE the at the money here
474.92s: is a 16 gamma we go all the way out here
477.56s: to the 120s we go to the at the money
479.52s: the gamma is 0.02 why is that simple
483.96s: options have to make a choice as we get
485.68s: closer to expiration it's either going
487.80s: to be in the money and have a Delta of
489.60s: one or it's going to be out of the money
491.68s: and have a Delta of zero gamma tells us
494.52s: the rate of change of Delta so that's
497.12s: why it gets so jacked up as we get
500.76s: closer to expiration all of these
503.00s: options are in the process of making a
504.56s: big choice either in the money Delta of
506.88s: one out of the money Delta of zero
508.92s: that's also why gamma is highest for at
511.72s: the money options CU they're going to
513.16s: swing a ton this is going to go from a
515.84s: 46 Delta either to a one Delta or to a
518.64s: zero Delta that means it needs to be
520.64s: able to change a lot that's what gamma
522.28s: is measuring if you go to these super
524.20s: far out of the money options they're not
526.64s: going to change much at all because
527.92s: they're a zero Delta they're probably
530.04s: going to be a zero Delta meaning they're
531.52s: going to expire worthless that's what
533.08s: this is so taking this back to what we
536.48s: care about Delta is the next big
539.76s: selection and I just gave you kind of a
541.96s: preamble on the way to think about Delta
543.96s: to a
544.88s: degree Delta makes our options more
548.56s: expensive the higher the Delta is but
551.92s: you get a better dollar for dooll move
554.52s: with the underlying what that means is
557.20s: in this case if GameStop goes up a
559.36s: dollar in these 25s for example you
562.96s: would have paid a dollar six something
565.76s: like that so you pay your dollar here
569.48s: you get a dollar move in the underlying
571.52s: you get to see 54
573.72s: cents of profit added to these your
576.72s: premium is going to move by 54 whereas
579.44s: if you go super far out of the money you
581.20s: get that same $1 move you're only going
583.48s: to see a nickel as compared to 54 what's
586.88s: the trade-off here good question as your
589.72s: Deltas are higher the options are more
591.36s: expensive notice this one you have to
593.00s: buy for a doll this one you can buy for
597.40s: 11 now you might be thinking well what
599.80s: if I just buy a dollar's worth of these
602.28s: it's a great question however
604.20s: unfortunately it doesn't work out that
606.28s: well let's take a look at an example so
608.96s: these are a 64 Delta expiring in 28
614.16s: June these are a 49 Delta expiring 28
619.44s: June sorry let's take a look at creating
622.40s: the same siiz trade these are trading
624.04s: for 53 so to get them closer to that $3
627.72s: Mark we'll do six of them so now they're
629.72s: about the same let's take a look at some
631.92s: scenarios if we look at the 60
634.96s: Deltas the 24 calls that we paid $3 for
638.40s: and let's say we get a plus two standard
640.36s: deviation move you're going to make 326
642.64s: bucks if we compare that to the six of
646.60s: the 49 and we get that same move you're
649.44s: going to get 335 bucks so what do you
652.00s: notice right out of the
653.48s: gate at the same size you put on the
657.16s: same size position overall these make
660.00s: just a little bit more on a two standard
663.08s: deviation move which the vast majority
665.76s: of the time you're not going to see that
667.32s: that's a low probability move remember
670.52s: standard bell curve
672.96s: 68.7% of data Falls within one standard
676.12s: deviation 95% of data within two so
680.44s: that's both sides by the way so it's
682.44s: essentially a two and a half% chance of
684.68s: getting that move in your favor give or
686.32s: take so it's just important to know
690.08s: that even if you think about putting the
691.68s: same size total cost position on in a
694.12s: much lower Delta option you still need a
697.40s: really big move in order to even catch
699.56s: up to getting a higher Delta option
702.08s: right out of the gate so what is this
705.36s: mean well we know then that if we go
708.36s: further out of the money our options are
710.28s: going to move less due to both Delta and
712.64s: Gamma if they're further in the money
714.56s: your gamma will slow down because you're
716.84s: already near a one Delta and and once
719.48s: you're at a one Delta you get a $1 move
722.20s: for every $1 move in the underlying it's
724.12s: essentially just leveraged stock so you
727.84s: have to figure out the correct balance
729.40s: for you and I'll tell you what I
731.16s: typically look for when I'm going out
733.68s: again at least at least 30 days
736.56s: preferably 60 plus maybe these 57s are
738.76s: fine something like that I will look
741.88s: starting at the money the downside
745.24s: they're more expensive they're more
747.00s: expensive by going further out in time
748.60s: they're more expensive because they're a
749.84s: higher Delta so I will structure a
752.96s: position that has a base position using
756.96s: these kinds of options that are at least
759.24s: 60 Delta plus and have a little bit of
761.80s: time to work even if I'm not expecting
764.76s: to hold them for 57 days I'm typically
767.04s: not I just don't want to pay that much
769.76s: in Daily Theta Decay by coming in super
772.84s: close and time and having the majority
775.16s: of my position Decay away so if we go
778.12s: all the way out here again to these 120s
779.96s: I'm losing 3 cents a day by going
782.28s: slightly in the money here I'm going to
784.00s: pay more Upfront for that but I'm not
785.76s: expecting to lose all of it I'm actually
787.56s: expecting to recapture most of it so
790.76s: that's the way I think about it I'm
792.00s: going to go again a little further out
794.00s: in time slightly higher Delta now the
796.20s: last thing to add is you can add what I
798.36s: call kicker options to amplify the
800.80s: position so what that could look like is
803.80s: let's say in this scenario I pick that
806.24s: further out in time option that's deeper
808.48s: in the money this this is the base
810.68s: position and I say okay well I'm really
814.20s: bullish for some reason I think the
816.68s: stock I'm looking at is going to fly off
818.08s: the handle so let me add some closer in
823.00s: time further out of the money options
826.64s: that have the ability to appreciate a
829.00s: lot this is why gamma is so important
831.64s: because by going closer in time let's
833.88s: say 2 weeks out I can find things that
836.92s: have really high gamma on a relative
839.20s: basis so that means if I start getting
841.52s: an accommodating move in my favor the
844.04s: position can start to compound massively
847.08s: because when we compare low Delta to
849.24s: high Deltas High Delta trades they don't
851.96s: have the same percent returns meaning
854.44s: they don't compound as much but you can
856.60s: make more money on a gross dollar amount
859.52s: than the further out of the money
861.00s: options so again we're at another
864.20s: trade-off so to summarize all of that
867.08s: these are the three things you have to
868.40s: keep in mind when you're buying options
870.40s: Delta how far out in time are you
872.28s: willing to go how much time do you want
873.76s: the trade to have the more time you give
876.32s: it the more expensive it becomes Delta
878.84s: the higher the Delta the better dollar
880.60s: for dooll move you're going to get the
882.24s: more expensive the options are going to
883.84s: be the slower your Theta Decay is going
885.88s: to be the less your money will compound
890.04s: gamma the closer in time you are and the
893.32s: closer to at the money the higher your
895.96s: gamma is going to be you want to have
899.32s: some exposure to gamma but if you're
902.16s: super close in time and you're out of
904.12s: the money you are fighting so much Theta
906.64s: Decay as a percentage of your position
909.48s: that it's going to erode away to nothing
911.68s: and to drive that final Point home if we
913.72s: look at this one not even this one let's
915.32s: look at the 8 DTE and we look at
917.56s: something like this the
920.36s: 37s these are these are still a 20 Delta
923.32s: almost 17 Delta like pretty high but if
925.76s: you look at the Theta it's 14 cents
928.44s: these op options cost 70 cents something
931.56s: like that so of that 70 C position you
934.92s: put on you're losing 14 cents every
938.60s: single day that you don't get a move in
940.88s: your favor until they essentially run
943.20s: out of money until they Decay into
944.76s: nothing so you have to be really
947.04s: cognizant of theta Decay you can
948.68s: decrease that by going further out in
950.92s: time by gaining a little bit more Delta
953.56s: it's a little more expensive UPF front
955.36s: but something worth trying if you have
957.52s: any questions let me know be
959.44s: see you guys later
