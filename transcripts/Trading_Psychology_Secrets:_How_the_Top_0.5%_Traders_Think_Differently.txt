0.36s: what's up outliers this video is
2.12s: designed to be a crash course in trading
5.52s: psychology specifically as it pertains
7.48s: to options but this applies to active
10.28s: trading in general and to kick us off I
13.36s: want to share a video from one of the
16.56s: very best Ronnie Coleman everybody want
20.36s: to be a
21.76s: body so nobody
27.40s: heav a big squat if if you couldn't hear
30.52s: him super clearly cuz it's an old video
32.72s: he says everybody wants to be a
35.44s: bodybuilder don't nobody want to lift
37.44s: this heavy ass weight I'll do it though
41.44s: that is the exact mindset you are going
45.44s: to have to adopt in order to be
48.24s: successful at trading because literally
51.16s: everybody loves the idea of being a
53.72s: successful Trader being able to control
55.56s: your time is nice being able to fly
57.48s: first class everywhere you go is really
59.52s: nice having fun things to do on the
62.08s: weekends because you have resources to
64.40s: do them and you don't have to put your
65.56s: head down and save all the time being
66.88s: able to travel all those things are
68.64s: really nice we love that part of it but
72.80s: very few people embrace the work that
76.64s: has to come first so let's talk about
79.28s: this now the thing I want you to keep in
82.84s: mind as we go through literally this
84.80s: entire video is that normal thinking
88.40s: doesn't work in trading normal thinking
91.68s: Works terribly what's an example of that
94.36s: very simple bargain buying you're taught
97.00s: that if you go to the store you should
98.92s: look for things on sale because you're
100.96s: getting it cheaper than otherwise it
103.04s: would be well in trading that kind of
106.12s: mindset will lead you to buy things that
108.24s: are cheap because they're cheap but in
110.84s: markets there's very often a reason why
113.32s: things are cheap and they tend to get
116.00s: cheaper inversely some of the best
119.08s: possible trades to get into
121.24s: directionally speaking are trades that
123.32s: are going high and making higher highs
128.00s: that's really tricky because you're
130.04s: buying something that seems to be at a
133.32s: high nominal level but again there's a
135.64s: reason why it's high and a lot of times
138.20s: those things tend to go higher now
140.28s: obviously there's Nuance to this that's
142.32s: just a very simple example to Prim your
144.48s: brain on why normal thinking does not
147.96s: work in trading you have to embrace that
150.80s: concept so let's talk about why bunch of
154.88s: Traders fail there's different numbers
156.48s: that you'll see thrown around but the
158.88s: overwhelming majority of Traders do fail
161.48s: that start so if you pop over to my
163.76s: website I actually have a little table
166.12s: here that goes through some of the
167.48s: statistics and then some different
169.12s: studies that talks about the
171.80s: profitability of Traders I don't like
173.28s: throwing out numbers that you'll hear
174.92s: all the time 90% of Traders fail without
177.36s: giving you something to actually look at
179.24s: cuz most people are kind of lazy that'll
181.32s: actually be a theme of this and they'll
182.60s: just repeat stuff that they've heard
184.00s: without actually looking it up but it's
186.32s: actually uh little over 90% will fail so
190.84s: why do they fail well I just hit one of
192.60s: the points for you directly lazy lots of
195.52s: people that start trading are lazy they
198.68s: again like the idea of the output they
200.52s: don't like the idea of the input so
202.12s: they're going to try and apply a really
205.64s: subpar approach to start the process of
207.96s: trading and then chocker they're going
209.48s: to get subpart results there's no big
211.52s: surprise here if you look at the people
214.36s: that are successful in pretty much
217.04s: anything they are not lazy you cannot be
220.76s: lazy you have to put in work that's
222.84s: actually one of the trickiest parts
224.36s: because there's a lot of people that
225.12s: have a lot of talent but if you have a
227.60s: lot of talent but you're lazy the talent
230.28s: goes to waste in trading can't be lazy
233.16s: there's no short cuts here and you have
234.84s: to embrace that early on lack of rigor
237.52s: this is a really tricky one and a lot of
240.84s: times in our mind we're working harder
244.76s: than we actually are and that's really
248.20s: difficult and there's another component
250.76s: where it's kind of like in the Marine
252.88s: Corps we say that we train to a standard
255.80s: not to a time so it doesn't actually
258.44s: matter how hard you work what matters is
261.52s: what you get out of that work so working
264.60s: efficiently maybe not as grindy and as
267.04s: hard might actually have a better
268.72s: outcome so the point that I'm trying to
271.88s: really drive home in this case is that
274.48s: rigor comes in different shapes and
277.36s: forms but it's about having a very
279.64s: thorough approach which we'll talk about
281.64s: more in a little bit self Loof this is
284.48s: probably one of the biggest ones on this
286.20s: list this is where we really don't go
289.56s: through the process of critically self-
292.64s: analyzing ourselves it can be really
294.72s: uncomfortable we don't like making
296.52s: ourselves feel bad or uncomfortable so
298.48s: we avoid those things and again this is
300.40s: one of the beautiful things about the
301.52s: military is you're going to get over
303.20s: that real real fast because you're going
305.52s: to get put on blast in front of
307.92s: everybody whenever you mess up and you
310.32s: have to be okay with it otherwise you
311.84s: won't survive so one of the big things
314.04s: that I try to remind people in the
316.08s: prospect of trading is that this this
318.76s: series of really trying to understand
320.96s: yourself your Tendencies your traits is
324.68s: extremely important and if you lack the
327.80s: ability to deeply self analyze and
330.40s: identify both strengths and weaknesses
333.76s: and really acknowledge those weaknesses
336.32s: trading can be very difficult emotional
339.16s: processing this is where you see Traders
341.80s: say like oh I got greedy or oh this
345.68s: should have happened or I got
348.68s: scared emotions are natural and contrary
352.44s: to popular belief in trading you're not
354.64s: actually meant to be a robot you're
357.04s: still a human being and that's actually
359.28s: one of those sources of edge that's
360.72s: available is
362.28s: discretion however you have to develop a
365.24s: relationship with your emotions and
367.64s: understand how to regulate them and
370.16s: again this applies outside of trading it
372.92s: applies to life in general if you're the
374.60s: kind of person that you're in traffic
376.20s: somebody cuts you off and you get
378.36s: viscerally mad about that you have road
380.64s: rage like most people do but again
382.84s: remember we have to do things
384.40s: differently than most people here then
387.44s: that doesn't bode well in trading it
389.08s: means that you literally lack
390.92s: self-discipline and you can't control an
393.48s: emotional response to something that is
396.36s: going to be a common theme as we go
398.00s: through this and then goalie locks
399.52s: analysis this is where you just focus on
403.76s: the pieces of something that you like so
407.12s: for example if we're modeling a trade we
409.56s: really favor looking at the parts that
411.88s: we like what are we going to do with the
413.56s: money that we make what are we how are
415.20s: we going to manage the profit as we make
417.32s: profit meanwhile we spend exactly Z time
420.16s: thinking about what's going to happen if
421.60s: it goes against us and that lack of
424.24s: preparation sets us up for a series of
427.64s: psychological shortfalls because when
429.96s: the trade because they will eventually
432.44s: goes against you we haven't even
434.32s: considered that so then we're taken by
436.24s: surprise because we're not thinking
438.20s: through things ahead of time so you can
441.36s: overcome this so let's talk about some
444.04s: of the the key mindset components of
448.52s: outliers and as you already probably
451.40s: guessed if you want to be successful in
454.60s: trading by definition because the vast
457.32s: majority of Traders do fail you
459.40s: literally have to be an outlier that
461.52s: means that you literally have to do
463.16s: things differently than everybody else
465.40s: and you have to be willing to do the
467.20s: work that other people are not willing
468.72s: to do so you have to adopt that mindset
471.04s: right from the jump you got to be
472.16s: different and it's not that you have to
473.88s: be born different it's that you have to
476.08s: adopt in a different approach which is
478.88s: one of the cool things about trading is
480.40s: that this is genuinely accessible to all
482.68s: of us self-critical you have to be able
485.04s: to analyze yourself objectively so
487.96s: people struggle with this massively and
490.52s: it's because we have a really perverse
493.04s: relationship with our perception of
496.92s: ourselves a big part of this is
499.32s: understanding who you are and your
501.28s: Tendencies because the market is going
503.08s: to pull it out of you if you're
504.48s: impulsive you're going to find it
505.80s: because you're going to skip over a
506.72s: trade checklist you're going to get into
508.32s: something without doing the anal is and
509.84s: you're going to get run over by
510.92s: something you didn't see if you're too
512.84s: risk averse the Market's going to find
514.52s: that because you're going to have trades
516.16s: that eventually do go your way but
517.76s: you're going to not have enough risk on
519.52s: because you're scared to lose money and
521.20s: then the trades that would have offset
523.20s: your losing trades are now too small and
525.00s: they don't the market will find all of
526.92s: your weaknesses so you have to be
528.80s: prepared to identify them as the market
531.32s: shows them to you and as you see them
534.72s: course correct regularly and that's the
537.48s: cool part is you don't have to have all
538.96s: of this died in before you start but you
541.56s: have to be receptive to the information
545.24s: as it comes in because it will now
547.56s: organization is non-negotiable and if
550.40s: you're one of those people that you
552.04s: think that you're going to memorize
553.32s: everything and that you can just go off
555.08s: the cuff it'll be easier that way again
556.88s: this isn't for you period full stop you
558.72s: have to be organized you have to have
560.72s: some sort of approach to collect
562.84s: quantitative and qualitative feedback
565.32s: for your approach so that you can then
567.56s: make the the adjustments and changes
569.20s: that we just talked about emotional
571.48s: regulation this is again something that
573.52s: applies to people who maintain their
575.60s: composure in life in general again using
577.96s: a fighting example if you see mixed
580.72s: martial artists as they start a fight if
583.68s: they're well disciplined and trained
586.24s: they're very relaxed whereas if you look
588.04s: at the normal person if they're in a
589.84s: fight they're very tense everything's
591.36s: super tight they're not loose they're
593.28s: movements are very Jagged and it's
595.84s: because they haven't trained themselves
598.92s: to withstand that kind of stress so a
602.52s: big part of becoming successful in
604.68s: trading psychologically is slowly
607.52s: increasing your exposure the composure
610.72s: of a mixed martial artist doesn't happen
612.28s: overnight it happens by them going in
614.08s: the Ring sparring doing things like that
616.84s: you getting used to seeing punches come
618.76s: really close to their face but not
620.68s: overreacting opening up another
622.40s: opportunity that takes time it takes
625.24s: repetitions and having a pragmatic
627.80s: approach where you slowly build your
629.76s: tolerance over time is going to be
631.88s: exceedingly important and again you have
634.04s: to identify what your emotional
636.00s: Tendencies are do you act irrationally
639.04s: when you're scared do you get scared e
641.20s: easily are you like me where you're a
644.12s: little bit too risk averse so that when
645.88s: you see a trade start not going the way
647.72s: that you thought it should do you want
649.24s: to immediately intervene and do
650.80s: something that sabotages the outcome of
652.84s: the
653.96s: system understanding your Tendencies is
657.64s: unequivocally one of the most important
659.64s: things you can do in this process now
661.56s: the last thing I want to note on this
663.04s: side specifically is this idea of trade
665.84s: and confidence because a lot of people
668.48s: get a completely misunderstood concept
671.84s: of confidence confidence isn't something
673.60s: that you can manufacture you can't fake
675.44s: it confidence comes from the consistent
679.60s: demonstration of a skill set so for
682.48s: example if I was going to go out and
684.00s: shoot a basketball and if I've shot a
686.52s: basketball tens of thousands of times
688.60s: before I'm gonna be confident at least
691.64s: that I'm G to get off a decent shot and
693.68s: the probability that it's going to go in
695.12s: depending on how far away I am is
696.80s: probably pretty good so that's not
700.20s: because I walked out without ever
702.20s: touching a basketball and just thinking
703.84s: oh yeah this is going to go great you
705.72s: can't fake the funk and again the
707.80s: problem with trading is that it's going
708.96s: to show all these little cracks so the
711.60s: way that you build confidence is through
714.12s: demonstrating the skill set over time
716.64s: one of the best ways to do this is
718.08s: through paper trading which I'll throw a
720.04s: link in the notes below that talks about
721.64s: that a little bit more but this is a
725.04s: simple way to build confidence so that
727.76s: you're not out there unsure of what's
730.72s: going to happen you're not comfortable
732.52s: with your plan because you didn't take
733.84s: the time to build a good plan because
735.48s: you didn't apply any rigor to it you
737.60s: just slap something together and because
739.72s: you wanted to make a bunch of money
741.00s: because you don't understand the
742.16s: landscape and think this is going to be
743.48s: easy that's going to lead to losing
746.48s: buckets of money all right so let's fly
749.40s: through some of these other things that
751.00s: you have to be aware of specifically
752.88s: your cognitive biases and there are a
756.24s: lot of them if you go over to my website
758.68s: outlier trading. underneath resources
761.96s: there's a thing here called Trader
763.56s: decision-making cognitive biases I
765.24s: literally list out 24 I'm not going to
766.84s: go through them here the reason why you
768.64s: need to know these is because these
770.40s: plague literally all of us and the
773.52s: reason why cognitive biases exist is
775.84s: because they impact most people going
778.44s: back to this point over here to succeed
781.96s: you literally need to be an outlier it
783.48s: means you need to do things differently
784.88s: it means you need to understand what
786.64s: most people do so that therefore you can
789.04s: do it differently and more successfully
791.48s: so the cognitive biases really
793.80s: influences most of our decision making
795.52s: in different ways take time to get
797.72s: familiar with this the other thing that
799.48s: you have to be aware of from a biased
800.92s: perspective is called the Dunning
802.04s: Krueger effect I specifically give it a
803.84s: little Focus thing down here because
806.08s: this will destroy most people and the
809.16s: the cliffnotes version of this is that
811.44s: you go through a period in the beginning
813.08s: where you're learning a lot of basics in
814.96s: a relatively short period of time and
817.28s: it's drastically boosts your confidence
820.76s: you think you know more than you do at
823.04s: this point that's essentially what that
824.68s: means then you are introduced to the
827.72s: fact that you don't and you make a
830.56s: mistake and you end up losing a bunch of
832.12s: money for me this was about 5 years into
834.60s: my trading career where I had on a
836.48s: single trade over a 30% draw down on my
840.00s: account pretty dumb looking back but it
843.08s: makes complete sense because I had been
845.16s: trading for some time at that point I've
847.52s: put in hundreds and hundreds of hours
849.88s: into learning and studying and I thought
852.20s: I had it figured out I didn't but then
855.64s: over time if you stick with it over time
859.12s: it builds and builds and builds so for
862.52s: those that are curious about like this
864.04s: Mastery thing that's said there's a
865.68s: couple studies out there that 10,000
867.52s: hours of a skill set typically leads to
869.72s: Mastery quote unquote and for that in
872.36s: context that means that you need to
874.08s: spend at least 5 hours every single day
876.64s: for 5 and a half years non-stop not
878.80s: skipping a single day to hit that 10,000
881.20s: hour mark So I offer this for context so
884.28s: if you've been trading for 3 years but
885.80s: you're spending 10 hours on it a week
888.04s: you might have some good experience
889.84s: you're nowhere near Mastery yet it takes
892.08s: time to get there so let's talk now a
895.24s: little bit about decision making and one
897.64s: of the things that we do in trading is
899.08s: we try to justify what we want to do and
902.72s: it's a big problem we actually have to
904.64s: flip that script entirely and we have to
907.20s: look for I call noes we have to look for
909.40s: reasons not to do things we have to look
910.88s: to poke holes in our ideas not to
914.76s: blindly try to support them again you
917.40s: have to do things differently being
920.40s: wrong this is a tricky one we all have
922.40s: an ego the ego doesn't like to be
924.16s: challenged or bruised but we have to get
927.00s: really comfortable with being wrong all
929.12s: the time the way that we do that is we
932.20s: detach our self-worth from being wrong
937.24s: because in trading if you can get
939.12s: comfortable being wrong trading becomes
941.44s: much easier because each time I'm wrong
944.32s: it's not a oh what did I miss oh this is
946.60s: the worst thing I suck as a person that
949.48s: starts to go away and you think okay
951.28s: yeah probabilistically this one fell out
953.32s: a different way that'll happen sometimes
955.40s: not all trades are going to be winners
957.44s: so the easiest thing to do here is learn
960.40s: that being wrong is part of the process
962.16s: you don't have to stay slaved to your
965.08s: ideas your theories you need to apply
967.24s: this over here which is basian analysis
970.36s: this is what I call strong convictions
972.56s: loosely held it means that you try to
974.44s: form the best idea that you can but then
976.64s: as soon as there's new information that
978.32s: causes you to think about it differently
980.16s: or give you a different outcome you drop
983.32s: the other thing like a rock and you
985.24s: adopt the new thing that's based on new
987.24s: information but it has to be well
989.04s: Justified you can't just flip-flop
991.56s: unnecessarily you have to have a
994.40s: pragmatic approach to receiving new
996.56s: information baking it into the existing
998.80s: information and then coming up with a
1000.88s: new conclusion that either supports or
1003.60s: forces you down a different path
1005.96s: rigorous analysis summarized is you have
1008.56s: to do the hard work that's all there is
1010.28s: to it you have to take the time you
1012.52s: can't accept easy answers so for example
1015.24s: if a Trader has a trade that was a
1017.28s: winning position and then it turns into
1019.16s: a losing Trade A lot of times they'll
1021.44s: summarize that as oh I got
1023.60s: greedy well maybe that's a superficial
1026.24s: answer because if you know about
1028.16s: expected return you know that you
1030.28s: actually need to have trades that
1032.28s: overcome your losing trades so it might
1035.20s: not have been that you were greedy it
1037.24s: might be that you didn't actually take
1039.16s: the time to build an approach and follow
1041.80s: that so you're blaming it on something I
1044.28s: call it false attribution where you're
1046.60s: not even going to be able to look in the
1047.84s: right place because you have an
1049.08s: identified the correct spot to look okay
1052.12s: so now let's talk about three simple
1053.96s: steps to transform your trading
1056.24s: psychology this is something we already
1058.28s: talked about I have to reiterate the
1059.96s: point because it's one of the most
1060.92s: important ones here you have to do and
1063.76s: act differently than everybody else
1066.84s: that's trading because the vast majority
1068.72s: of them fail so if you see a lot of
1071.36s: Traders looking left you might want to
1073.24s: look right you have to understand that
1076.12s: this is a really challenging thing that
1078.36s: takes time time to build over time but
1080.72s: it's entirely doable but you cannot be
1083.84s: lazy about it this leads to the next
1086.52s: point which is if you are not willing to
1089.40s: challenge your own thoughts and quantify
1092.24s: what you're doing and analyze it this is
1094.80s: not for you so what that means is if
1096.76s: you've never looked through a trade log
1098.72s: because you haven't built one I don't
1101.12s: understand how you could possibly think
1102.60s: that trading is magically going to work
1104.24s: out for you this is like trying to start
1106.04s: a business and not tracking your Finance
1108.92s: is as a business that business probably
1112.04s: will not succeed same thing here last
1115.04s: thing build the skill
1117.92s: set the way everything else will slowly
1122.00s: start to fall into place is if you take
1124.44s: the time to build a skill set so for
1126.44s: example the way that you build or get
1128.92s: over the idea of Being Greedy is by
1132.00s: taking the time to test a strategy build
1135.68s: the approach track the results know what
1139.24s: to do so then when the trade's on it's
1141.76s: not a function of Being Greedy or not
1143.52s: it's a function of letting the trade do
1145.48s: what it's supposed to do the way that
1147.92s: you overcome the vast majority of the
1149.92s: psychological challenges of trading is
1152.12s: to build the skill set based on actual
1154.68s: work that you can actually look at and
1156.92s: analyze and feel confident in the
1159.96s: overwhelming majority of Traders
1161.68s: struggle building confidence or
1163.72s: executing a plan because they don't
1165.08s: believe it and why should they the
1167.08s: majority haven't taken the time to build
1170.24s: something that they can trust the last
1172.20s: thing I want to show you are a bunch of
1173.68s: different studies and I recommend
1175.08s: looking these up these are available for
1177.76s: all the outlier Pro members on patreon
1180.24s: you can download them for free and you
1182.96s: have access to all of them automatically
1184.56s: everybody else you can just look them up
1185.76s: it's none of this is paid you can get
1188.32s: access to all of this this simply talks
1191.00s: about a lot of the different qualities
1194.56s: of traders in terms of their emotional
1197.24s: processing and decision making and again
1200.12s: the reason why we study what most people
1202.20s: do is because we know we need to do
1205.24s: something different than all of them
1208.40s: overconfidence this has everything to do
1210.40s: with dun and Krueger and fun fact the
1212.72s: more overconfident somebody is the more
1214.52s: they tend to trade full of these kinds
1217.88s: of things so as always if you have any
1219.36s: questions let me know be an outlier see
1221.04s: youall later
