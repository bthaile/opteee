 Great success. Yeah. That was really weird. Earlier today I had a couple issues with this stuff too. Now, the one thing I am always supremely confident in though is that I'll be able to figure it out. I never fear not being able to figure it out, but sometimes it's a little convoluted. Awesome. So it looks like we have the whole gang in town. First things first, we have to update our app map. And we actually have, let me see, I think from the last video, we had a bunch of people. We had a bunch of people from all different spots. Let me grab, grab in the comments from the last video that I can update it for us. And then as always, if you are dialing in from somewhere, let me know where. And then I can add you to, okay, here we go. So we had Lithuania, that's kind of a fun one. That was not on our map before. That is from smile up drone. That's fun. We have cork Ireland. Which we had not had before. We have Cyprus. I also did not know that there was a Cyprus in London. Did you guys know that? And then we have Delaware beautiful. So we got, we're all updated on our spots. We are ready to rock and roll. A little bit of a bumpy start, but we're here ready to move it along. We have a Largo Florida. Let's find Largo Florida. Add that. And then specifically with this, let's take a second and go visit your hood. I like to do this. I don't really know why I like to do this, to be honest, but I do. And let's go to Largo Florida. Close this. And we're just going to cruise around your hood a little bit. And then we're going to do some of the due diligence. But actually the thing I want to start us off with is going to be peaking at Max Payne. I want to talk a little bit about Max Payne, especially with the club. I'm going to do a little bit of the time. And I want to start us off with is going to be peaking at Max Payne. I want to talk a little bit about Max Payne, especially with the clothes that we had on Friday. I think it's pertinent. No preferences for where we, where we creep around. Somewhere on the peninsula. Okay. Let's take a look at Bel Air. This is like very normal Florida vibes. Very, very normal Florida vibes. It's interesting because like the coast in Florida is so different than the coast in California. It's wildly different. Which I always find very interesting. The beach is always very flat. There's no waves. And another thing I always find in Florida is that there are like this greenery. I forgot what it's called, but that's. That breakdown space. It has a specific name. I literally just don't remember what it is. What is it called? And there's certain kinds of plants and stuff that. It's like a very, very normal life. Live here. But yeah, this looks like very standard Florida. I was there not too long ago visiting. Well, being. Oh, that's pretty. You can just see the humidity. Very cool. All right. So now we know what it's like around. I was looking at, when we were looking at moving, we were potentially looking at Saint Petersburg for a little while that I remember that popped up on the list. And then there was another one that popped up on the list. It wasn't Cape Crab. There's soda was another one. And then. There's another spot that was somewhere along this coast. I don't remember where. Naples. That was it. Naples. Naples. Naples. That's the other spot we were looking at. But. It's a little too flat for Mel. Rightfully so it's a little too humid for me. So. It looks like it's probably not going to be our bag. All right. So let's grab the DD. Library that we ran last time. And. And then we're going to do this. And I think I actually spoke about splitting this to be able to run the AI assistant. I'm going to see what the size this feature only supports files with less than 600 pages. So I think what I'm going to do while we're here for a second is. Edit this. This file. I'm going to split it into two. And then we can use. We'll be able to use the AI tool that's built in which I think will be really useful. Because the way that we're doing it now where we're copying and pasting it to chat you pts just a little bit slower. Then I think it should be. Extract pages as separate files. I don't want to. I guess that's. So let's split it up something around 400 pages will take off. Let's split it up to here. And then. Yeah, 409. That's perfect. Extract these. Perfect. So it did that super fast. That's awesome. This is great. So this will just take me a second to get it all set up. And then this way we'll be able to actually run it through the AI. I just think it'll be a little more efficient for us. This will work fine. This will be diamond handbook part one. And that took us to 409. So now we take 410 to the end. Extract. Literally beautiful. And this is where we have our stoppoint from the seventh, which is last week. This is great. So we have everything that we need. This is beautiful. We'll save it here with the other one. And this will be. Diamond handbook part two. Lovely. And now we should be able to run AI with it, which I think will be really useful for us. Cool. So that's all set up. What I want to do is talk to you all about Max Payne. And then we also should talk about whether or not we think Greg is wearing kitty or not. That's another thing that's popped up. Let me grab X. And I found this a couple places. I'm going to find it. I don't know the dude's name. It's like a really long name. Greg. I'm just going to see if I can search Greg. If it'll pop up. This. Okay. So I guess we can start with this because this is even faster. So if you guys haven't heard, there's a dude on the internet, Greg, this whole thing. And there's recent conjecture that's key and roaring kitty might be the same person. And it's stemmed from crack me if I'm wrong. You guys is always will know more about this stuff than I do. I am way more plugged into the trading side of things when it comes to the more folklore, whatever we want to call it, the inner workings and the qualitative stuff. I think I am grossly grossly under equipped. But this is popped up. I think this stemmed from somebody that tried to follow. I think Greg. And then the thing popped up saying that they followed roaring kitty. And then there was another thing about. I can't remember if it was like a picture of like where they were from. Let me see if I can own a search it for it specifically. Greg. Greg kitty. I think these posts will. Some reason I can't find them now. This is fascinating. I literally can't find them. I was trying to find the posts. That's really interesting. Let me see if I go through Greg stuff. I think there will be probably comments people will have made. And we can find it that way. No, no. Hey. This is hilarious. I don't know if you guys saw the Trump post of this. Just the fact that fucking. Whether you like them or not. The entertainment is about to start up again. Maybe it would be under replies. You guys know what I'm talking about. I don't think Greg is R. K. higher chance it's RC, but I don't think that one either. Man, I might be going crazy. Yeah, what up, Ryan, city, Ryan, city says, um, no. Okay. So quick recap. I think this is a series of posts on X by different people that were speculating that Greg is roaring kitty. And I'm trying to find those posts. Fortunately, my feed typically isn't that busy because I don't follow a lot of stuff. So I might be able to. Dig it up. The four you thing is always terrible. No. No. I mean, if you guys want to scroll through the feed, I mean, if you guys want to scroll through it with me or there's nothing in here, you're able to. But it was from some time today. I'm assuming it's from the four you. Okay. Reportations, can search Greg and ruin kitty. You just like that. I'll try that Greg. Greg and. We're in kitty. Okay. Thank you so much. Lauren, that's super, super helpful. This at least gets us on the right target here. So whoever this is, I don't know this person, but they say they're making a joke about the timing. Yeah. Here we go. Finally. I think this is the one that I saw. This is the one that I saw. Perfect. I don't know who this is, but. Let's see what the comment says this. Whoever this is aligns with whoever mentioned this in the chat. Somebody up above. Who was saying they think it might be RC. And confirm. Oh, whoa. This is like the perfect meme. Yeah. So anyways, I saw this is the exact one that I saw though, because I could tell this one moved a little more widely. Yeah. Anyways, it doesn't really look like there's much, much to it. Jotato says Chuck is super wholesome and funny. Good follow for anyone on the X. That's hey, let you heard it from Jotato. So follow the dude if you're so inclined. I'm really, really, really methodical about who and what I follow. I don't like the vast majority of social media and I don't really track what other people are doing. So most of the stuff that I tend to follow are information sites of some sort. But yeah, I think follow away if you guys like his stuff. So that's red. Ranty says, but where are the Greg posts? I'm only seeing Chuck Hodle. I don't think it's from Greg. I think this is this is Greg joking about it. Right. I am not a cat. And this is somebody saying you're the first person slash cat I've subscribed to. So he's obviously slightly involved in the joke. But it looks like he's not directly discussing it beyond this. See what this post has. Don't lie, Keith. If there's any responses. Somebody named roaring Murphy. Feel like growing Murphy would be the authority here. SP norwell says Greg is the only other account buck the bunny follows other than GameStop. I honestly don't know who that is. So I don't know what that what that connection means. But if that for other people. Ranty says, oh, so the tinfoils that Greg is RK and undercover talking to Cohen that way. I don't know if he's if they're inferring that he's talking to Cohen that way. I didn't see that part of it yet. I just think that people are joking that Greg is roaring kitty. I didn't see the implications beyond that. SP norwell says it's GameStop's mascot account. Oh, interesting. I didn't know that. Let's take a look at that really quick. You said it's called buck the bunny. Buck the bunny. Wait, this thing. Is this the right page? It's the GameStop. Why is nobody following it? Give you a taste. Okay, so this isn't the right one. Okay, thank you. I was going to say that just doesn't sound right to me at all. That's the problem when everybody tries to be like a fucking doppelganger for stuff. So frustrating. Buck the bunny. This makes more sense. And what's the history of buck the bunny? Was it a. Oh, so it was like a toy. I was like, what's the name of the mascot resurrected? So did it start as the mascot of GameStop or was it something that existed and then they decided to make it the the mascot of GameStop? What's the origin of you? Where do you? Oh, there's Greg. It's kind of funny. GameStop made a short video about it. Okay, so this is from 16. Interesting. Well, it looks like he's back. Well, the bunny's back. Well, that's kind of interesting. Well, anyways, for those that didn't know and this is just a thing I've noticed going around. I still don't really know what to what to make of it. It to me, it just seems like people kind of having some fun. But I have been noticing this is a conversation point. At Max Payne. And I need to grab a couple things here. This one. Hey, that's actually really cool. Oh, it might be because I'm on my browser. It's probably less less impressive. Well, anyways, for those that are wondering, I'm Google searching Max Payne. And the thing that I thought was really cool is when I scroll down. This is my video. But it's probably because I'm signed into my thing. You probably wouldn't catch this year. Because I don't think I'm front page of Google literally for anything. Living that peasant life. Let's take a look at this. So. Lauren is Lauren is laughing at my search result. I thought I've listened man, maybe one day, maybe one day. All right, let's read this. Max Payne theory popular among retail investors postulates that options expiration, the price, the underlying stock converge to the stock price at which the aggregate total payment obligations of store position is the lowest. This is under the assumption that the market maker is the counter party to the trades and that most trades are bought to open. That's the assumption. I have, as you saw in those Google results. I do have a video that talks about Max Payne. And it reviews a bunch of the research. I don't want to spend a ton of time on it. But I do think the close from Friday is at least worth a discussion point on it. So I'll slide this out of the way just for now. And we can see that we close that 2799. So here's the the world of Max Payne at a high level. It's very difficult to prove. There's a lot of research out there that points in different directions. And this isn't research that's done by market itself. It's typically done by different kinds of schools and educational institutions. And they see slightly different things. From a logical perspective, there is an incentive there. And anytime there is an incentive in financial markets. And for potentially somebody's benefit, you have to take it seriously, I think. Because the only reason why all of us are in markets is to make money. So all of that being said, there is a propensity for options to somehow draw the price of the underlying where Max Payne exists. Now there's a couple things to know about Max Payne. Let me see if I can grab it. I think it's from unusual wails. I think they have a tool for that. Let me see. No. I'm looking for the specific plots that I'm trying to find. No, no, no. No. No. Oh, I think it's on here, my bad. Here we go. Might be here. These are just the Greeks. You could do Delta exposure or something. I don't know if this thing does Max Payne does it. I thought it did. I think it does. I think it does. I think it will get used to the tool. This just looks like the chain itself. There's a website that does. That does Max Payne by itself. Max Payne. This website. And I think most of you guys are familiar with this one. There's an important point behind this though because one of the things that retail traders I find tend to do is they automatically think Max Payne is causing essentially all movement around expiration. And the problem with that is a few things. So first things first. If we take a look at these different strike prices. One of the things that's going to have to happen naturally in the options chain as time passes is we are going to ebb and flow where Max Payne is. Max Payne is not static. So Max Payne is almost always going to be near the money. Almost not always, but almost the reason is because that's where options are most liquid. And that tends to be where traders are transacting are front expiration near the money. So it creates a near self fulfilling prophecy where stock price tends to follow around move around where Max Payne seems to be. But the options market is moving in the background also trading around where stock price is. So the important element here is to know Max Payne is not static. If we take a look at Max Payne today and we track it against what it is at expiration, it will be different. That's an important note. Pretty much half to track it. So this would show Max Payne. It's kind of hard to tell it's so skewed. That's actually really interesting how skewed it is. Does this show. That's kind of a bummer. I thought they had a thing that showed it like day by day. That would I think be really, really helpful for people to see like how it moves. But Max Payne will move. Now that part aside, the other element to know for the market making perspective is market makers have the ability to move price. And much is difficult to say. It's very difficult to quantify. In order for them to move price. Options do not lead the market. Options are derivatives. The value of an option is derived from the underlying. So that's options positions depending on who holds them. Sometimes will include hedging activity. That includes the underlying itself. So that line becomes muddled a little bit. So. When we have a stock in a situation like GameStop. And we have the ability for the stock to either land at 28 or 27.99. Literally a one penny difference. A market maker or group of market makers might be able to force price down by selling a bunch of shares. Just to dip the price down a little bit. It's easier said than done. And it's more applicable to smaller price movements. One of the things I see people say is, oh, they didn't want it to land in 30. So they pushed it down from 30. I'm not saying whether they did or didn't. I couldn't prove it to you either way. That's why I wouldn't say whether they did or didn't. I don't know. But what I can tell you is the further away it is, the harder it becomes for an entity to try and manipulate price in that way. Because if market consensus is for whatever reason, market consensus thinks the stock should be 30. And then a group of market makers start trying to offload and sell shares or whatever they can get their hands on to try to drive price down. But the market is like, wait a minute, this is easily worth 30. I'm going to buy it here. I'm going to keep buying it here. That will add buy side pressure to counteract that push down. There's a limit to how far price can be manipulated in this way. When something is moved by a penny, that's not that fucking hard to do. It's very, very realistic. If the stock could have closed at 28 versus 27. 99. I absolutely would expect there to be a large group of interested participants, market makers, that would rather see this at 27. That is not as big of a move that they need to try to facilitate. And here's what I mean by this. If we take a look at the daily volume, the daily volume was 6.8 million shares. Let's grab our little, a little dude dad here. So 6.8. For 6.5. Sorry. 6.581. 6,5181. 586. And then let's just say that the mid price on this around would be 28 and a half. Something like that. We can calculate what the total value is that moved on the day. This is essentially just a V-wap. So 6.5. 81.5. 8.6. Times 28.5. 187,575,201. Now that's the total amount of volume on the day. With smaller stocks like this, moving this from 28, 27,99 is a pretty small move. So even though the total volume on the day, let's just call it was 188 million in terms of price and value, in order to move this by a penny, it still requires a subset of this and not an insignificant subset of this. We can actually do the math, but it doesn't matter quite that much. The point to be aware of is that market makers are incentivized to have more options expire worthless. If there's a way for them to collude together or with other entities to drive price down by a penny, which is the difference between several thousand options expiring in or out of the money, they're incentivized to do so. This also is not a big gap to cross. Very plausible. Again, we can't prove it and that's important to reiterate. I don't know. I can't prove it. I have my suspicions, but I can't prove it. So I don't know. That being said, there's a difference between this scenario and then the people that say, well, it should have been at 30, but market market makers manipulated it down to 27.99. This becomes a big gap to cross because still it's doing 200 million in volume on a day. I'm not saying that it couldn't be done, especially if it's broader spread collusion and stuff like that easier to detect. There's a lot of risk involved in doing that, especially if they're trying to short it and then there's some sort of meteoric rise for some reason or another. So this just becomes a taller task is all I'm saying. So when we have the conversation around, oh, obviously it's being manipulated for Max Payne, there's two things I always want you to remember. Closer prices are more accessible to manipulate. Max Payne moves. You should be aware of those two things. Then whether or not you think manipulation is happening and how to what degree and how far. Obviously that's all up to you to decide for yourself, but you should know those two data points when we look at this stuff. Brick and the wall says are there other stocks where this sticks out as much as GME. I would actually argue that there's stocks where it's much worse than GME. GME is still a pretty big stock. So it's doing 200 million total volume in a day. If we take a look at total shares, it's 446. I don't know what the current market cap is. 446 800 365 times 27 99. So it's a 12.5 billion dollar company. That is not that's not a small stock. Where Max Payne and stuff like that becomes really, really pronounced is in small stocks. Because it's much easier and more accessible for market makers to manipulate the price because they don't have to use as much total money to do so. Game stop, I think gets the focal point of it because people are looking at it a lot. And people are obviously highly, highly interested in the company and the stock. They know about market manipulation. So I think that this gets hyper analyzed to that extent. When we analyze studies like this, you'll actually notice that there are certain gaps in like market cap that are more susceptible to this versus not. And the way that they track, by the way, which is ingenious, the way that they track whether or not they think in this study is they use a reversal pattern. They say coming into expiration on expiration day, what happens to the stock price and then what happens on Monday after Friday? Does the stock price immediately rebound up? And then they're using that as a proxy for it being manipulated down and then value resumes to the upside. Completely reasonable proxy. It's still not perfect though. And I want to be abundantly clear. I am not saying it doesn't happen. I'm not saying it does happen. I'm just talking about the phenomenon in a vacuum so that people can come up with their own conclusions. That's all I'm doing here. Sometimes when I talk about these things objectively, sometimes people will. Sometimes people will think that I'm trying to argue or debate another side of something. So yeah, I can grab a well, the link to the study that I have won't take you to it because it's in open browser, but you can literally just type in SSR and. And dump in Max pain, it'll come up. For show. So that's the that's the game of Max pain. There's absolutely a reality. There's absolutely an incentive behind it. But that being said, even if we track something like dollar delta and whatnot, it'll have. It'll have a different view as price moves. Because as price moves, more options are going to be open and closed around different prices. That's also going to interact with. Max pain and whatever Max pain is. So you can see that where the total dollar amount of open interests are. And you can speculate then at those price levels. What might be. A better spot for a market maker to perspectively try to push price down and again, like the 30 strike is clear is 20. Well, 30 strike is going to be heavier than the 28s, but still the 28s will have something in them for sure. Here. So interesting stuff, but you should, I think, generally be aware of that. Samo says it's not it's not that they can hold on. It's not even. Look, I'm struggling reading this Samo. It's not even can they. It's likely not be worth it. Okay, the size of the position you would have to justify is ridiculous. Well, it's ridiculous to a degree, but again, they are highly incentivized. And if they're not expecting that they're actually taking a big risk, it's very possible. The problem like we're talking about those that when it's bigger, when it's a big gap, when we're talking about like five dollars, that's difficult to attach an assigned Max pain to. And then it looks like we have somebody from Bulgaria. Let's get Bulgaria on our map. We just we got Bulgaria rep in the set. That's kind of crazy. You all have fucking Z's and threes. Like it's normal. This top word looks normal. Stara's a gora. And then this version of it is real tricky to read. Real real tricky to read. So we got Bulgaria rep in the set. Rowan city says it's speculated that they do it to prevent gamma squeeze. That's not. Yeah, I would disconnect those. So them trying to execute something like Max pain doesn't actually. It's completely different than a gamma squeeze. So I would decouple those in that scenario because they're definitely different things. Okay. I'm getting caught up. Rowan city says it depends who the options chain is loaded up. Yeah, I would it depends how the option chain is loaded up exactly. So I would just decouple the concept of Max pain from a gamma squeeze. They're just different functions. They do different things from a Max pain perspective. The market makers are absolutely incentivized to have as many options expire out of the money worthless as possible. Assuming that they are the ones that sold the options to whoever bought them, which is a completely fair and safe assumption. That's objectively the case. They're incentivized to do something like that. So from from that function, the purpose of Max pain is to save them some hedging cost because they're not going to make the money or not based on Max pain. They still made their money. They make the money on the bid ask spread. It's just can they make a little bit more money, which they can, which is why they're incentivized to do so. But Max pain like the Max pain has a constraint because it requires quite literal collusion in order to push price. Because if you have a stock that's doing $200 million of volume in a day, in order for you as the participant, in this case, the market maker, to try and push the price down, you're going to have to put up a percentage of that total daily volume. In order to make a meaningful move in the price. So that's why smaller moves are entirely feasible because it's very expensive and it's a big risk for them to carry it. But if it's a smaller move, it's easier to carry that risk. But if we're talking like China's suppressed price, $5 as a market maker, that's much, much more difficult, much, much more difficult. Espionore Wall says I've seen price move aggressively in the last hour today to get to Max pain, assuming it was unhidged calls that expire at the close could also be self fulfilling of traders or watch your Max pain. Yeah, what you're seeing there is a is a few different things. So what you're seeing is typically in the last hour of the day, just like the first 90 minutes price moves a lot. The second thing that you're seeing is as the last hour of the day is going, you have to remember Max pain come towards the end of the day on expiration day is going to be close to at the money. It's going to be close more often than not. That's not to say that it's guaranteed, but it's going to be close. And at that point, you have options traders who have options that still have some value that they're saying, do I want to hold this in an expiration and see if it moves in my favor, do I want to scrap what value I can out of this and roll it into another trade. And it's a toss up, they probably want to do both. You're also seeing traders transacting and making decisions about their positioning. So it's not inherently a rush to get to Max pain. It's again, a very intricate system that has a lot of different inputs that are doing different things at once. Raintiddy says that's when brokers start auto exercising, isn't it the last hour of the two. No, no, no, no, I don't know. I can't say because I don't know most brokers, but do you options are settled based on the last closing price of the day. So you don't start exercising before the close because you don't know where it's going to close. So notice says not necessarily collusion many people doing the same thing, look in the same direction, synthesize to move in the same direction. But that's the thing is like the participants and the options buyers are not incentivized to look in the correct direction. The reason why I would wager its collusion more than anything for Max pain to work is because if you had one market maker on any, any style of frequency on Friday towards the end of the, because everything on their books is tracked. It's not hidden. So if you have one market maker that happens to be towards the very end of the day selling five million dollars worth of GameStop shares short to push the price down a penny, that's going to stick out like a sore fucking thumb. So in order to not get caught or to decrease risk of being caught, they have to spread it out between other entities. Otherwise, it is a big bright flashing sign that's super, super clear as day. So yeah, I think that I think that it's very likely that the market makers would be colluding to some degree can't prove it again can't prove any of this stuff. But. So then we're going to say, oh, okay, so I already answered that on cool. Alright, so let's grab our. Handbook. So this is the shrunk down version that we should be able to use AI for now. And let me see where we left off. I remember how to do this now. I thought I thought the little thing popped up. Oh, over here. I remember how to do this. Don't worry. Don't relax. There's no bookmarks. Here we go. Perfect. This one we can get rid of. And then let's see if we can use AI for this. I don't know actually how it works. Let's see. Alright, so we'll let that start processing and we'll start reading through this. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what time that happens. I would imagine that's a little late for a margin call. But I don't know. Yeah, I don't I don't know the answer to that one. We're in Titi enough. I don't want to give you a ballman sir. Oh, damn, you only get to ask it like two questions. This is terrible. Let's see if I can get it to work summarize this section. Let's see if we can do it. If not, we already have a proven way to do this. I was kind of hoping that this would work though. Not that this seems any faster as I'm sitting here waiting. I don't know what you got that from it. That's wrong. The times are wrong because 2 pm eastern time is 1400 not 1600. Those are 1600 would be 4 pm which would be end of day close, which would make sense. To ensure timely settlement and avoid potential issues is because options that are in the money at expiration will need to automatically be exercised and brokeers need to manage their clients accounts accordingly. Yeah, so and in that kind of instance, Roying Titi, I think that whatever the time actually is I'm assuming it'll be 2 pm. So it's a little bit earlier is that's looking at stuff that's like super deep in the money. Right stuff that definitively is overwhelmingly likely to end up in the money. I don't think it's in the case of something that's like at the money, which is an important differentiation. Okay, so the section that it provides a detailed analysis of the short interest percent based on various data points calculations. The analysis includes references to other users post data such as deep in the money call options and their impact on synthetic shares. The other estimates that the current short interest percentage for GME is significantly higher than publicly reported figures exceeding 200% of the float. Section emphasized the complexity and potential manipulation of the market highlighting challenges and accurately determining true short interest. I mean, that sounds right to me. I think that that's also something that we've taken a look at before. So yeah, I completely dig that. I think there's no no issue from my side with with any of that. I dig it. I am opening up a GPT thing though because we're going to run out I already used one request. So I only get I think like two requests or something, which is kind of lame. We need to change the tool. Let's try using GROC for this next round. I haven't done this one before. So I'm curious how GROC will do. Alright, so I think we know most of this. Let's skip through though a little bit and see what we come up with. I do not believe they're delaying. Oh, this is interesting. I do not believe they were delaying if these are hiding. They are satisfying them with fake shares and simply hiding their ever growing short interest. I mean, I get their point, but I can't help but find that a little pedantic because if they're not actually satisfying it, it meet like they're delaying it. Because then it's not satisfied. This is why we never see the FDD squeeze theory play out. When is this from this is this is interesting because this has been like really it. Oh, this is cool. I'm excited now. The reason why I'm excited about this is because this is. This is really interesting because this is something that's talked about now like very much current state, which I can't help but find interesting. Also, I wonder if there's like a chat GPT or perplexity plug in for Adobe. No, we continue. Is this a little bit. Okay, so we know this. We see large purchases of out of the money puts in the money puts out of the money calls and in the money calls. That's like all the options. Oh, I see they're trying to explain each. Out of the money puts used to hide short interest. This is no effect on price of GME because it's not being exercised and they maintain. I even until expiration shortage are using these to hide short interest from the world. The main counter argument to the molasses their short interest is 20% they covered. So if you're shorter and you hide your short interest, you can push that narrative. And hope people. Check out how short. Short interest percent drops when put. Oh, I rock it. I'm reading this slow because I'm trying to understand and think through. There's a lot of. There's a lot to this. Where's figure one. Little put. I. I don't. Hold on. What's their. What's their claim. I'm just struggling to understand the position. Because from what we read last week, we know that they can use options in different ways is locates. But I'm trying to understand the out of the money put. I'm trying to understand the out of the money put element of that because if you buy a put. I'm asking chat you be to a couple questions. Well, right now, rock. Talk borrowing programs. Yeah, okay. So let me see. Specifically for the options used. You satisfy. Look. Sell security short without having a rain. Yeah, we know all this. Hey, I know all this. Be more specific on what exact types of. Used. Yeah, covered calls we know. Here we go. What is. That's fine. Those shares at that price, thereby satisfying the low kick. This is confusing me. I'm going to. I'm going to text Newton. Question. I'm asking Newton based on his research. Essentially what he what he seen. For options trades as a satisfying function for locates. Because I can see. I can see different ways for it to play out, but I'm just trying to follow this person's train of thought. And I'm struggling a little bit. It's a little. It's a little tricky. And the reason why it's tricky is because there's a. There's a million things going on in this very simple example. So to. To draw the direct conclusion here. Of short interest percent dropping when put. Oh, I skyrockets. This does not equal causation. I'm not saying it doesn't equal causation. But we can't like based on this itself. We cannot make that causative statement. Because when short interest becomes super high, a billion other things are going on at the same exact time. Same thing when put open interest skyrockets. A lot of other things are going on at a spas at that point in time. So I'm just trying to see how they're making the direct connection here. And it just it's not immediately jumping out at me. So. Sp nor was says from what I remember was married calls puts not just puts. Yeah, well, there is a couple. A couple key ways that they were doing it. Perkins, the wall says a way to set their shares. To say they're shares are real or not synthetic. Yeah, no, so I'm familiar with what they're trying to do. The question I'm having here is the relationship that they're identifying here specifically of using out of the money puts to hide short. And functionally, how that. How that's happening. And the other like the other element of this that just isn't correct slightly nitpicky, but still I think worth mentioning at this point. Is that buying a lot of out of the money puts still has still has an effect. It's not. It's not a function of whether or not they're exercised exercising them isn't the only way for them to have an effect, which is just important to know it doesn't really impact this example that much I wasn't going to bother mention. But we got to get the general. Getting. Getting real poofy. I don't know if you guys can tell, but he's like a fluff master 3000. He's very ready for his dinner, I think that's where he's trying to go negotiate. I try to tell Mel that we don't negotiate with terrorists, but he always says that he's a cute terrorist. He ends up giving in. And now he's down. I'm for the count. I'm going to open the door so he can go grab some. And off he goes. All right, let me get back into the regular screen here. Okay, I'll see what Newton comes back with. In the money puts are used. Cedric says Thor is a God. Yeah, exactly. He that's this correct. That's his that's his history. He's a little baby. He can't be a terrorist. That's that's exactly what Mel says. So then he's able to run a muck and terrorize crazy. That's absolutely crazy. Lauren says he's going to have a ponytail soon like a boomer portfolio manager. I am going to I'm letting him grow out to give him the next most ridiculous haircut that I can think of, which is always very exciting to me. All right, so in the money puts use the flashcrush price. This is an expensive move by Boolean. It's happened once. This is the last to chefe where you mass exercise in the money. Money puts. To crash the price down. Oh, man, I just don't know, bro. I don't know. I don't understand this. I'll process. Wish I could ask this person questions. As soon as. Yeah, I'm struggling to understand the way that they're thinking about this. Use by shorters to filters and that shares the room and satisfy FTDs. Interesting. Yeah, see the problem is especially with citing these. When the market is going through an anomalous period like a lot of this stuff. It's I just I think it's. It's disingenuous to make very defined statements about correlation and causation. And like I I don't think that they've connected any dots as far as I'm concerned. They've connected and identified relationships potentially. But I don't see an explanation for the relationships, right? They're they're saying. That they're used by larger for out of the money calls. They're used by larger players who want a profit. The ones were purchased expire on 16 July 21 might be hoping for like it just. Not really to me it looks more so like they're just kind of explaining their version of things as they think they see it, which is okay. But when I'm reading especially due diligence, I'm trying to find like researched back connections to stuff, which a lot of these have a lot of. Which is why I'm applying that one. And I think a lot of this is actually a little bit moot now anyways. Because. Well, you guys tell me what is the what is the perception of the shorts like does the community still think that there's massive droves of shorts out still now. That have open shorts that haven't satisfied through like the different offerings because that's one of the things that I spoke with Newton about a while ago because I think that that's a really important. Consideration when we look at the idea of shorts continuing to hold massive short positions without taking some of the risk off in some degree because it's also there's a cost to carry the short positions. So I'm really. Yeah, okay, so it looks like a little bit of a mixed bag. Got it. Okay. We're assuming deep in the money calls are not used to hide fds but rather use to satisfy. Okay. Mel is paying me that is dinner time so I need to figure out what we're going to order. She wanted. I think she wanted barbecue. Which I can get down on. Let me get this barbecue order rolling. Funny enough you can't get it from door dash. So you got to do it through Uber Eats which is kind of kind of bullshit if you ask me. Right. Okay. Jay's. Mike's. Looks like we have to do Mike's. All right. What do you guys think try tip probably try tip right. I think that's the main thing you can do or a place like this. Brisk gets a little too fatty. I don't think that would be for me. Bacon. Bacon pickle spears. That's kind of fucking crazy don't you think. Damn. Oh, nuts. That's next level. Horned red burn ends. I think burnt ends are pretty good. I just. Texas toast. I don't think I want no Texas toast. Yeah. I think just try tip and pull pork. With. Bicybarbecue. Horse radish. You know, these guys are kind of fucking crazy. I might need these guys to chill the fuck out just a little bit. I think that's a little bit of a. Bit of a. Bit of a heavy look. All right. Well, we're good though. We got that ready. Jotato says bacon pickle spears sound like something I need more of him. I like, I don't know about that man. Like that just. I don't know. Sounds fucking weird to me. SP nor wall says theory is legacy shorts are still open and hidden was 230 in 2021. And run was due to game gamma option. But then what's the. What's the reason for carrying the cost. And where do we think that they got. Short. Because I don't fully understand the positioning then. If hold on let me grab treating you. That'll be dollar. All right. Looks like mills order is done. I'm the launch this bad boy. What she get. She got a fucking barbecue chicken case idea. Sometimes. I just have a lot of questions about my wife. Guess whatever floats her boat. That's a weird one. Okay. Weird. I think they're shorted again in 22. Expensive to close but why is it too expensive to close. And then sp nor wall says I don't believe FTDs would require will FTD. FTDs are different than shorts right. This is what it's like. The fact is it's like for me to do. Because if. Educate me when we say the shorts who are the shorts. Because I always took that to inherently mean hedge funds. And market makers. Like between those two entities. So then. trying to do. And I think that we could see that, that that was what was being done. So I agree with that. So then, but the reason why I asked the question is, because depending on what entities we think the shorts are, it was 64 cents March of 2020. Yeah, okay. So then, but they probably weren't getting short at 64 cents, right? They were probably shorting for some time, which is what would be pushing the price down. Let's take a look at that really quick. The reason I'm asking this, I'm trying to understand what the community expectation is of who the shorts are, how they're holding the shorts, because those lead to different things, even in the context of trying to understand this DD, and how they might be managing it, and then how they might be holding things still. Jotate says, I think they believe they'd do it bankrupt sooner rather than later in the four bill cash stockpile, so they had no motivation to close their massive losing positions. But they, that's like, they do have a motivation. Here's my theory, just to throw out there, and this is my opinion, I don't know. It would be very strange to me if there were people that shorted game stop leading into the low prices that you're citing of 64 cents in March of 2020, that have then just perpetuated their shorts the entire time frame without changing the shorts. My guess is they probably have had periods where they've taken pieces of their shorts down and then re-engage them if they were inclined to maintain the position. Now, I also think that there's a reality to your point, Roy and Titty, that there absolutely could have been entities that were starting to short the stock when it was a dollar, and they got ran over so hard that they'd rather just hold the position, but there is a cost to hold those open shorts. There's not, you can't find a free short, because even from, like, say, for example, if you try to short a stock on your brokerage platform, you obviously have to borrow the stock, and then you have to borrow the stock, and then you pay a rate because you're borrowing something that you don't own. Now, obviously, the relationship will be completely different with the way that institutions can short, they can set up swaps and things like that, but even a swap has a cost to carry, which would lead me to believe that the Constitution of the shorts probably looks different for hedge funds versus the idea of market makers having uncovered short position. I, like, my guess is that the constitutions of the shorts would be very different, and the way that the shorts are managed would be very different. And that's one of the things that confounds me a little bit when I read through the different DD because it always looks like we're looking at it from one perspective. That's actually what begged the question here, because as I'm reading this, it still looks like we're continuing to think of the shorts as universal all short, all in the same boat. And I actually don't think that's likely to be the case, because the way that different entities would short would look slightly different. And then I think the way that they would maintain the short would also look different because the game of satisfying FDDs from a market making perspective is really important, obviously, which is why a lot of them would likely find ways to satisfy FDDs so that they don't pop up on right-hand stuff like that. That becomes a problem in a threat to the business. But for hedge funds, they probably have different ways of maintaining and holding the position. And hedge funds are really the ones that would probably be more involved in the seller boxing side of things and actually trying to press price down to zero. So that I just think is a bit of a breakdown from some of what I've seen here. Rointit, he says, there's a difference between covering and closing. And I think a lot of I would agree with that. And I think a lot of retail doesn't understand that. I agree with that. As Pinar well says, anybody brought up Susan Trimbatty, you guys showed me two or a couple streams ago. I actually think we read some of her work for sure. She knows a lot about these things and the students used to work for the DTCC. Yeah, I think and I think we've looked at some of her work before. Let me see. I'm trying to see if she has a website or something. Maybe her blog looks like she's working for an advisory firm right now. Wait, is this the right naked short greedy? Yeah, okay, cool. I'm going to shoot her a message right now. I'm saying, hey, Susan, my name is Eric. I run a YouTube channel outlier trading and I've been digging in and I have been digging into the GameStop story for the past. What is this? This is 24 episodes. So at least the past six months. Would love to post you on a podcast episode sometime. Episode sometime to chat about your research on FTDs, naked shorting, and market microstructure. Cool. So email sent. I will keep you all up to date and see what we could find. Rointitie says Twitter. She's real active on Twitter. I can hit her up there too. I normally try to shoot them in email first just to because I don't like to put people in the spotlight. If she doesn't like to do podcasts or something or she doesn't want to do them anymore, know that she's been on other ones. But I try to give them an easy know. But yeah, if they don't respond, then I'll typically tap them somewhere like that. Pam says, have the UBS shorts ever been confirmed or is it just a good assumption? I've not seen any proof of it. It seems like it's likely to be the case. I don't know if anybody has a different experience. But yeah, I've not seen what I would consider to be like actual proof of it. We're getting our little grip strength thing going. This thing's kind of tough. It has like this little wheel that you can jack up the strength of it on. We're just trying not to have like little baby forearms, the nature of the game. Rintitie says, how's your back, by the way? Thank you very much for asking. It's completely fucked still. But it is ever so slowly getting slightly better. It's definitely less overall painful, but it's still, yeah, I'm still locked. Unfortunately, hopefully, hopefully at some point. All right, let's keep going through this. I think we can flip through most of this. 100% of the volumes. Yeah, so they're kind of attributing all of that to synthetic and stuff. Okay. Be clear, I'm not concerned about regular investors exercising their free speech online. I'm more concerned about bad actors potentially taking advantage of influential platforms. What was this with respect to? Was he talking about the cat here? Who is he talking about here? You guys know? I literally have no idea who this is. Well, obviously, no Gensers. I just don't know who he's talking about. Dark Mark says you've been able to change your Getsu at all. No, bro, I've been able to do shit. I can hardly sit down. As you guys notice, I have to get up and down pretty frequently. But yeah, I can't hinge at the hip at all. I can get maybe 15 degrees. So yeah, I've been able to do shit. I've been doing really lame, boring, home, and gym exercises, but it's like a fraction of what I typically would do. I'm just trying not to stagnate entirely. And you're always always going to keep fighting. So Runtidy says no, did he say that before after he made the shitty pie in the face, game show commercial aimed at retail investors? I remember that. That yeah, and we looked at that not too long ago as well. Fairifying share recall, okay? Seeing a lot of you talk about GameStop, potentially recalling shares. Okay, I think we can skip through this because they've not done it. Why we're still trading sideways? Interesting. We've made it through an exciting week with yet only another day of sideways trading. I like to examine why I think we're not launch based on the bits and pieces that we know. Well, what do you guys think? In April of 2021, why do you guys think it was trading sideways? Do a daily. He said it brings you back to the spot that you're at. Wish you would just let me stay where I wanted to be. So he's talking in here. So, Dredge says no catalyst. They can't push it down because of the cash pile on the buybacks. He says kitty cashed out in the sole of the GME revolution was crushed. My best guess. When you all look at these movements from 21, how much of this do you all attribute to retail traders versus other entities? Another question. Dredge says 5% retail. You boys getting a sick forearm pump right now. Moving this mouse is going to be real tricky. Any other guesses? The reason why I ask is because the idea of the cat cashing out and then GME as a movement slowing down is really curious because it then opens the question of how do we think about the interplay between other institutions and to Roy and Titties point, the GameStop revolution? Because I agree that the GameStop revolution is the absolute heart and soul is the retail trader like without it now. I guess I should say retail investor. But the retail investor, I don't think would be the only entity that would move the price. It would actually probably be a smaller subset of what ultimately moves the price as compared to larger institutions because even the volume on these days is still significant enough. This is 130 million. This is 254 million. Like the price movements coming up here, I would wager would be really difficult to tie directly to retail. I would still imagine that a significant portion of this would be institutions of some sort trading the general price movements. So it's interesting because when I look at the start of this, stocks go sideways. Like it's normal for stocks to go sideways. And that's typically when there's a bit of a disagreement between what expected price should be for something for whatever the market consensus is, the difference between buyers and sellers. Trying to find whatever price they think makes sense. All right. So let's see. Well, it's alleged at the moment it's clear that some law firms believe that there's a case against multiple entities, including DTCC for a conspiracy shutting down the January 28th squeeze. I agree with that. I think that makes a lot of sense. Lauren says, I don't understand why him taking profits at points would upset people so much he spoke about trimming positions. Yeah, that's really interesting. I think a lot of people view him as essentially the price generator, the like the person that moves the price. So I think people believe that if he gets out of it, then essentially their price generator has left. So at least from my best guess, I think that's mostly why you see that perspective taken by people. CDJ says won't RK have to pay taxes if he gets out of it. If he's in a standard margin account, if he's in some sort of tax advantage account, then no. But if he's in a standard margin account, then yes. What is this? Members of potential bidders and future auctions to spend clearing members remaining portfolio. There are Jenny three views on what is about to happen. The entire system and banks are going to go belly up because the scenario described everything short DD. I don't think so. They're reacting to increased liquidity requirements stemming from last year and the expiration of a cell. Oh man, I'm confused. Next is multiple. What it looks like they're talking about people positioning for some sort of like big drop or collapse. But for the market makers to provide liquidity, say you want a bunch of IGX. Yeah, okay. You might be thinking of the DD highlighting more above it dump any stocks over the last year. We keep in mind and jump to airline stocks. So they're talking about like the expectation of defaults. Interesting. Where on titty says he would be a really shitty trader to never take those profits. I agree with you. And the funny thing is is if he didn't take profits, he wouldn't have compounded anything. Because if you have a position on and you don't do anything with it, you don't manage it, you don't close it, you don't do anything with it, you can't make any money on it. So unless GameStop is a stock just went directly up into the right, which we know it didn't, there's no way for him to actually build the wealth that he built by just buying and holding it. And we can see that that wasn't his game plan from the beginning because we went through every single one of his trades and from the very onset he used options. So you don't use options unless you're trading. That's why Nancy Pelosi obviously is out there slaying an option. Okay. Johnny says he could build wealth by selling calls against the shares. No, he couldn't. Absolutely, he could not. One, because we can see all the way back through all of his original portfolio updates. There was never a short call in there. But more importantly, short calls at the scale that he hit absolutely could bring him money, but it's not going to build you wealth. Short calls, they're defined profit by their nature. So a lot of people are speculating and it's really interesting to me that people are so adverse to him selling his shares that we willingly take the leap into something that's a more convoluted explanation for what likely is to have happened because none of us can fully prove it one way or the other, which is very fascinating to me because the simplest explanation would be that he very effectively traded around his positions, buying low selling high, continuing to do that. But yeah, it goes back to Lauren's point from before, like people seem to get really, really upset at the conversation of him unwinding his shares, which is really, really interesting to me or unwinding options position. Because he's doing the right thing. He's trading. That's how you make money as a trader is by moving into and out of positions when it makes sense. This talks about other institutional longs choose not to recall. This is back on the share recall. We got a calendar. Something interesting. We need to find a liquidation of failing members. Okay, so I don't think that this actually came to pass. Interesting. This is also interesting. What did it interesting, quote? Because a lot of times people seem to get upset with RC for making what I would consider to be a series of like pretty solid businesses, like the better of the company. Even though it does absolutely come at the cost of near term price movements and whatnot. This is interesting because I think there's a great quote from. Jimmy is not a political debate. It's a class war. Runtidy says the root of the upset people is people who became bad holders. Yeah. And I can see that. I can even see that in the options, chains when I look through those and whatnot. That's why I spend actually a lot of time talking about how to trade in and out of options so that a trader doesn't necessarily find themselves in that scenario because it's always good to, especially as a trader to make money. Like when you make money as a trader, that's a good day. So I think for individual retail traders, they have to integrate that into their approach. The buy and hold thing is fine, right? If somebody thinks that that's the right approach for them, but that's also dangerous because if the primary profit mechanism that we're talking about is a short squeeze or a gamma squeeze or some sort of squeeze, a big price movement, but then there's no expectation to sell, you're unable to monetize the price movement. It's just an unrealized gain that sits there and that doesn't ultimately help you buy more shares or do whatever the ultimate objective is or take your money out and use that to change your family's life, whatever the ultimate objective is. So that's been a pretty consistent breakdown as far as I can see with the logic of people that are hoping for some sort of squeeze, but then they don't have at least some sort of exit plan in place to monetize it because otherwise you can go through the short squeeze, but then you might emerge at the other end, which is cool, but you might emerge at the underend with no more or less money than what you started with, which is, I don't know, I think that that would be the not not the objective. All right, so here's our leaveoff points for 14 Ds. And then I don't know if we're going to have one of these next weekend because I'm going to be traveling. I'm still going to stream intermittently next week, but I'm going to be popping around a little bit. Yeah, I don't get in. Oh, actually, I might get in in time. Maybe we'll see. I might get in a little bit too late for a first stream on next Saturday. I don't want to go through this one yet. I'm going to save this one. Cool. Anything else that we should hit before we bounce? This thing has been so volatile. There's just from, I mean, that's how I found my way into it with the options trading space. We really cherish volatility. And this thing has had so much of it. Ham says in the congressional hearing, he even mentioned how the money he made in on GS was going to go a long way. He didn't die in hand, obviously. Yeah, well, and I think that's the other thing that happened with the the game stop stuff is that that clearly went into what he rightfully labeled a yolo portfolio where he was just saying that somebody that took $100,000 at the onset and they said this $100,000. It's a lot of money, but I can make that again or I'm good without it. And I'm going to see what I can do with it. That's exactly what that was, which is very cool. Roryntady says, buy and hold came from the principle that the flow is being locked up in the shorts needed our shares and would be forced to buy it any price. New retail had no idea how any of this worked and behaved. That's what would happen. So the diamond forever not understanding the marketing mechanics. Yeah. And that's, I completely agree because especially for the people that are talking about like buy hold, D.R.S. That's that's fine too. But the the main thing is for those kinds of people, if you do that, you don't monetize the move. And that's why like the move here from 14, up to 64, you can make a lot of money on it. You can make a lot of money on it. But if you buy and hold and your shares are D.R.S. You've essentially made, which still isn't bad by the way, but like you essentially would have made that what nine and change and you're sitting at 28 now. But you had an exit point here to be jet from I mean, there's just so many potential exit points for somebody that was getting in pre squeeze here. So yeah, it's just that's a long holding period from here to here to go from five or nine and then to be sitting at 28 after four years or five years. When all of these individual spikes can be monetized. And I mean, you guys, I keep it really straight with you guys. I hold shares just as a play of solidarity with the apes. But it's a very small subset of my total capital. And what I do mostly with GameStop is I trade the movements because it moves really well. And there's a lot of ways to again, monetize the movements. But buying and holding, especially something like this, it will take a little bit of time. I think the company looks good. I think the prospects of the company turning around are really strong. But I do think that the company is positioned well. But that kind of stuff still takes time to eventually come to the surface, which that's what people will have to be willing to hold through. And even that, they need to have an exit here, an exit plan in order to eventually make the money because otherwise it just sits as an unrealized game, which is cool to have. But that doesn't pay bills. And that's not the thing that will ultimately change, you know, somebody's life that they'll want to find ways. Even if it's one of the easiest ways things can do is take partial profits. I'm in the process of making a couple different videos for GameStop on how to essentially trade a stock like GameStop with some different strategies to give people ideas. But even if you want to buy and hold in DRS, some of your shares, you can have some of it that you're, you know, actively moving in and out of to then slowly accumulate more shares in your base share position or something like that. There's different things folks can do. But I just want to see people be able to hit their objectives because I know a really big part of the GameStop community and the apes is people are looking for a change in their lives. They're literally looking for something to lead to a significant change in their current life scenario, their life perspective, the situation that they're in. And I want to see people be able to do that because trading is unequivocally done that for me. Like, it literally has done that exact thing for me. So I know it can be done. But I also know that you kind of have to think through what you're trying to do in order to get the outcome you're looking for. So I hope people can continue finding their way there. I really, really do. We'll see. But I'm, I'm bullish on people's ability to learn and grow especially with everything that's available now. I think the retail trader and the standard ape that exists now are continuing to get really fucking smart. And I think that that just bodes well for what they're what they will eventually be able to do. We will see time as always will tell. All right, gang. That wraps me up for today is always if you need anything, hit me up in the discord. And I will see you guys during one of the live sessions. I do one every single day at 5 p.m. Pacific time. So I'll catch you guys all throughout the week. Be an outlier. Be an ape. I'll see you all later.
