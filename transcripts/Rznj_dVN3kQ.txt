0.00s:  Great success.
4.16s:  Yeah.
5.16s:  That was really weird.
8.24s:  Earlier today I had a couple issues with this stuff too.
13.40s:  Now the one thing I am always supremely confident in though is that I'll be able to figure
19.00s:  it out.
20.00s:  I never fear not being able to figure it out, but sometimes it's a little convoluted.
31.00s:  Awesome.
32.00s:  So it looks like we have the whole gang in town.
41.00s:  First things first, we have to update our app map and we actually have, let me see.
55.00s:  I think from the last video, we had a bunch of people, we had a bunch of people from all
63.12s:  different spots.
69.32s:  Let me grab, grab in the comments from the last video that I can update it for us.
77.92s:  And then as always, if you are dialing in from somewhere, let me know where.
85.00s:  And then I can add you to, okay, here we go.
88.92s:  So we had Lithuania, that's kind of a fun one.
93.20s:  That was not on our map before.
95.88s:  That is from smile up drone, that's fun.
100.52s:  We have cork Ireland.
104.36s:  Which we had not had before.
107.32s:  We have Cyprus.
110.32s:  That's a.
115.24s:  I also did not know that there was a Cyprus in London.
118.48s:  Did you guys know that?
125.28s:  And then we have Delaware beautiful.
127.64s:  So we got, we're all updated on our spots.
131.56s:  We are ready to rock and roll.
133.36s:  A little bit of a bumpy start, but we're here ready to move it along.
137.20s:  We have a Largo Florida.
139.88s:  Let's find Largo Florida.
145.96s:  Add that.
146.96s:  And then specifically with this, let's take a second and go visit your hood.
157.00s:  I like to do this.
158.00s:  I don't really know why I like to do this, to be honest, but I do.
160.92s:  And let's go to Largo Florida.
171.56s:  Close this.
174.04s:  And we're just going to cruise around your hood a little bit.
179.00s:  Where do you guys want to go?
185.96s:  Do you guys want to go to Belier Beach?
188.48s:  Yankee Club?
190.48s:  Clear water I've been to?
193.40s:  Indian shores?
194.40s:  Where should we go?
196.92s:  Let me know what kind of creep and we're going to do around Largo to see where Trippie
202.40s:  Micah's from.
203.64s:  And then for the agenda today, we're going to work through some of the due diligence,
207.40s:  but actually the thing I want to start us off with is going to be peaking at Max Payne.
212.72s:  I want to talk a little bit about Max Payne, especially with the clothes that we had on
216.60s:  Friday.
217.68s:  I think it's pertinent.
222.44s:  No preferences for where we creep around.
227.52s:  Somewhere on the peninsula, okay?
229.00s:  Let's take a look at Belier.
232.92s:  This is like very normal Florida vibes.
242.48s:  Very very normal Florida vibes.
248.12s:  It's interesting because like the coast in Florida is so different than the coast in California.
255.84s:  It's wildly different, which I always find very interesting.
261.92s:  Yeah, the beach is always very flat.
266.32s:  There's no waves.
268.52s:  And another thing I always find in Florida is that there are like this greenery.
273.40s:  I forgot what it's called, but that's that breakdown space.
279.92s:  It has a specific name.
281.08s:  I literally just don't remember what it is.
283.96s:  What is it called?
286.60s:  And there's certain kinds of plants and stuff that live here.
295.00s:  Yeah, this looks like very standard Florida.
299.44s:  I was there not too long ago visiting, well, being, oh, that's pretty.
305.12s:  You can just see the humidity.
309.52s:  Very cool.
310.52s:  All right.
311.52s:  So now we know what it's like around.
316.40s:  Largo, Florida.
317.80s:  We were looking at Mel and I when we were looking at moving, we were potentially looking
321.60s:  at St. Petersburg for a little while.
323.72s:  I remember that popped up on the list.
326.28s:  And then there was another one that popped up on the list.
331.32s:  It wasn't Cape Crow.
334.32s:  Here, soda was another one.
340.28s:  And then there's another spot that was somewhere along this coast.
345.84s:  I don't remember where.
349.28s:  Naples.
350.28s:  That was it.
351.28s:  Naples, Naples.
352.28s:  That's the other spot.
354.28s:  But it's a little too flat for Mel, rightfully so it's a little too humid for me.
360.72s:  So it looks like it's probably not going to be our bag.
364.36s:  All right.
365.36s:  So let's grab the DD library that we ran last time.
373.32s:  And this.
376.36s:  And I think I actually spoke about splitting this to be able to run the AI assistant.
382.16s:  I'm going to see what the size this feature only supports files with less than 600 pages.
388.44s:  So I think what I'm going to do while we're here for a second is edit this file.
395.88s:  I'm going to split it into two.
398.84s:  And this way we can use.
402.08s:  We'll be able to use the AI tool that's built in, which I think will be really useful.
410.16s:  Because the way that we're doing it now where we're copying, pacing it to chat you,
413.08s:  PTs just a little bit slower than I think it should be.
418.36s:  Extract pages as separate files.
420.16s:  I don't want to.
426.60s:  You have to, I guess that's.
431.32s:  Let's split it up.
432.96s:  Something around 400 pages will take off.
437.36s:  Split it up to here.
441.56s:  And then.
443.56s:  Yeah, 409.
444.92s:  That's perfect.
448.56s:  Extract these.
452.80s:  Perfect.
453.80s:  So it did that super fast.
455.00s:  That's awesome.
456.00s:  This is great.
457.00s:  So this will just take me a second to get it all set up.
461.20s:  And then this way we'll be able to actually run it through the AI.
463.76s:  I just think it'll be a little more efficient for us.
468.20s:  This will work fine.
471.56s:  This will be diamond handbook part one.
479.68s:  And that took us to 409.
480.92s:  So now we take 410 to the end.
484.60s:  Extract.
489.24s:  Literally beautiful.
493.76s:  And this is where we have our stop point from the seventh, which is last week.
499.20s:  This is great.
500.20s:  So we have everything that we need.
501.20s:  This is beautiful.
503.20s:  We'll save it here with the other one.
508.60s:  This will be.
510.72s:  Diamond handbook part two.
516.08s:  Lovely.
520.44s:  And now we should be able to run AI with it, which I think will be really useful for us.
529.16s:  Cool.
533.00s:  So that's all set up.
534.88s:  What I want to do is talk to you all about Max Payne.
539.56s:  And then we also should talk about whether or not we think.
544.60s:  Greg is wearing kitty or not.
546.76s:  That's another thing that's popped up.
548.72s:  Let me grab X.
553.00s:  And I found this a couple places.
557.60s:  If I can find it.
563.12s:  I don't know the dude's name.
564.44s:  It's like a really long name.
566.40s:  I'm just going to see if I can search Greg.
567.92s:  If it'll pop up.
574.80s:  Okay.
576.80s:  So I guess we can start with this because this is even faster.
582.76s:  So if you guys haven't heard, there's a dude on the internet, Greg, this whole thing.
590.96s:  And there's recent conjecture that key and roaring kitty might be the same person.
601.84s:  And it's stemmed from, correct me if I'm wrong.
604.08s:  You guys as always will know more about this stuff than I do.
607.12s:  I am way more plugged into the trading side of things when it comes to the more folklore,
613.32s:  whatever we want to call it, the inner workings and the qualitative stuff.
618.40s:  I think I am grossly, grossly under equipped.
627.72s:  But this is popped up.
628.72s:  I think this stemmed from somebody that tried to follow, I think, Greg.
634.08s:  And then the thing popped up saying that they followed roaring kitty.
639.08s:  And then there was another thing about, I can't remember if it was like a picture of like
650.00s:  where they were from.
653.36s:  Let me see if I can own a search it for it specifically.
656.64s:  Greg, Brian kitty, I think these posts will.
681.88s:  Some reason I can't find them now.
683.76s:  This is fascinating.
685.24s:  I literally can't find them.
687.36s:  I was trying to find the posts.
691.24s:  That's really interesting.
692.64s:  Let me see if I go through Greg's stuff.
694.36s:  I think there will be probably comments people will have made.
698.60s:  And we can find it that way.
704.44s:  No, no.
708.64s:  This is hilarious.
718.64s:  I don't know if you guys saw but Trump posted this, just the fact that fucking, whether you
725.48s:  like them or not, the entertainment is about to start up again.
736.16s:  Maybe it would be under replies.
740.32s:  Do you guys know what I'm talking about?
746.80s:  DCM says I don't think Greg is RK higher chance.
750.04s:  It's RC but I don't think that one either.
754.00s:  Man, I might be going crazy.
760.84s:  Rointitty, yeah, what up, Rointitty?
762.24s:  Rointitty says, um, no.
763.68s:  Okay, so quick recap.
766.48s:  There was a series of posts on X by different people that were speculating that Greg is
776.16s:  Rointitty.
780.12s:  And I'm trying to find those posts.
784.16s:  Fortunately, my feed typically isn't that busy because I don't follow a lot of stuff.
790.96s:  So I might be able to dig it up.
797.00s:  The 4U thing is always terrible.
801.32s:  No, no.
817.72s:  I'm just scrolling through the feed.
819.36s:  I mean, if you guys want to scroll through it with me or there's nothing in here, you're
823.52s:  able to.
824.92s:  But it was from some time today.
834.68s:  I'm assuming it's from the 4U.
842.20s:  You're portation's cancel.
851.00s:  Search Greg and Rointitty.
854.08s:  Just like that, I'll try that Greg.
857.08s:  Greg and Rointitty.
861.68s:  Okay, thank you so much.
869.28s:  Lauren, that's super, super helpful.
870.76s:  This at least gets us on the right target here.
874.16s:  So whoever this is, I don't know this person, but they say they're making a joke about the
878.16s:  timing.
879.16s:  Yeah, here we go.
880.16s:  Finally.
882.40s:  I think this is the one that I saw.
885.56s:  This is the one that I saw.
886.64s:  Perfect.
887.64s:  I don't know who this is, but.
894.68s:  Let's see what the comment says this, whoever this is aligns with whoever mentioned this
899.80s:  in the chat, somebody up above was saying they think it might be RC.
923.76s:  I can confirm.
930.76s:  Oh, whoa, this is like the perfect meme.
935.20s:  Yeah.
936.20s:  So anyways, this is the exact one that I saw though, because I could tell this one moved
940.88s:  a little more widely.
943.84s:  But yeah, anyways, it doesn't really look like there's much, much to it.
952.24s:  And Tatus says Chuck is super wholesome and funny.
954.44s:  Good follow for anyone and ex that's hey, let you heard it from Joe Tatum.
959.08s:  So follow the dude if you're so inclined.
961.76s:  I'm really, really, really methodical about who and what I follow.
966.52s:  I don't, I don't like the vast majority of social media and I don't really track what
972.36s:  other people are doing.
973.48s:  So most of the stuff that I tend to follow are information sites of some sort.
981.24s:  But yeah, I think follow away if you guys like his stuff.
987.20s:  So that's red.
991.36s:  Raintid he says, but where are the Greg posts?
993.28s:  I'm only seeing Chuck Hodle.
994.72s:  I don't think it's from Greg.
996.44s:  I think this is this is Greg joking about it, right?
999.96s:  I am not a cat.
1001.92s:  And this is somebody saying you're the first person slash cat I've subscribed to.
1006.20s:  So he's obviously slightly involved in the joke, but it looks like he's not directly
1017.18s:  discussing it beyond this.
1019.04s:  Let's see what this post has.
1021.04s:  Don't lie, Keith.
1022.56s:  If there's any responses.
1036.20s:  Somebody named roaring Murphy.
1041.16s:  Feel like growing Murphy would be the authority here.
1049.16s:  SP Norwell says Greg is the only other account buck the bunny follows other than GameStop.
1055.00s:  I honestly don't know who that is.
1057.16s:  So I don't know what that what that connection means.
1059.52s:  But if that for other people.
1064.32s:  Raintid he says, oh, so the tinfoils that Greg is RK and undercover talking to Cohen that
1069.76s:  way.
1070.76s:  I don't know if he's if they're inferring that he's talking to Cohen that way.
1073.28s:  I didn't see that part of it yet.
1075.48s:  I just think that people are joking that Greg is roaring kitty.
1079.92s:  I didn't see the implications beyond that.
1084.64s:  SP Norwell says it's GameStop's mascot account.
1087.52s:  Oh, interesting.
1089.24s:  I didn't know that.
1091.04s:  Let's take a look at that really quick.
1094.00s:  You said it's called buck the bunny.
1096.44s:  Buck the bunny.
1104.84s:  Wait, this thing.
1109.32s:  Is this the right page?
1112.84s:  It's the GameStop.
1113.60s:  Why is nobody following it?
1118.52s:  Can you say this?
1120.12s:  Okay, so this isn't the right one.
1123.24s:  Okay, thank you.
1124.04s:  I was going to say that just doesn't sound right to me at all.
1127.24s:  That's the problem when everybody tries to be like a fucking doppelganger for stuff.
1131.84s:  So frustrating.
1132.84s:  Buck the bunny.
1137.92s:  This makes more sense.
1140.20s:  And what's the history of buck the bunny?
1153.32s:  Was it a, oh, so it was like a toy?
1166.64s:  Old mascot resurrected.
1168.56s:  So did it start as the mascot of GameStop or was it something that existed and then they
1175.24s:  decided to make it the mascot of GameStop?
1181.68s:  What's the origin of you?
1183.28s:  Where do you, oh, there's Greg.
1187.72s:  That's kind of funny.
1193.36s:  GameStop made a short video about it.
1195.16s:  Okay, so.
1199.32s:  This is from 16.
1207.72s:  Interesting.
1214.64s:  Well, it looks like he's back.
1219.96s:  Well, the bunny's back.
1220.92s:  Cool.
1221.92s:  Well, that's kind of interesting.
1222.96s:  Well, anyways, for those that didn't know, and this is just a thing I've,
1228.32s:  I've noticed going around, I still don't really know what to, what to make of it.
1232.80s:  It, to me, it just seems like people kind of having some fun, but I have been noticing this
1239.40s:  is a conversation point.
1241.04s:  So now let's take a look at Max Pan.
1248.68s:  And I need to grab a couple of things here.
1259.32s:  This one.
1270.00s:  Hey, that's actually really cool.
1274.00s:  It might be because I'm on my browser.
1281.60s:  It's probably less, less impressive.
1284.44s:  Well, anyways, for those that are wondering, I'm Google searching Max Pan.
1288.32s:  And the thing that I thought was really cool is when I scroll down, this is my video.
1296.00s:  But it's probably because I'm signed into my thing, you probably wouldn't catch this year.
1301.76s:  Cause I don't think I'm, I'm front page of Google literally for anything.
1307.44s:  Living that peasant life.
1313.16s:  Let's take a look at this.
1316.24s:  So.
1318.76s:  Lauren is Lauren is laughing at my search result.
1325.16s:  I thought I've listened man, maybe one day, maybe one day.
1331.72s:  All right, let's read this.
1332.96s:  Max Pan theory popular among retail investors postulates that options, expiration, the price,
1339.04s:  the underlying stock converge to the stock price at which the aggregate total payment
1343.80s:  obligations of store position is the lowest.
1346.40s:  This is under the assumption that the market maker is the counter party to the trades.
1353.60s:  And that most trades are bought to open.
1357.56s:  That's the assumption.
1360.48s:  I have, as you saw in those Google results, I do have a video that talks about Max Pan.
1371.12s:  And it reviews a bunch of the research.
1374.28s:  I don't want to spend a ton of time on it, but I do think the close from Friday is at
1380.52s:  least worth a discussion point on it.
1383.72s:  So I'll slide this out of the way just for now.
1387.24s:  And we can see that we closed that 2799.
1390.84s:  So here's the, the world of Max Pan at a high level.
1401.24s:  It's very difficult to prove there's a lot of research out there that points in different
1408.36s:  directions.
1410.00s:  This isn't research that's done by market itself.
1415.00s:  It's typically done by different kinds of schools and educational institutions.
1420.60s:  And they see slightly different things from a logical perspective.
1427.00s:  There is an incentive there.
1429.68s:  And any time there is an incentive in financial markets for potentially somebody's benefit,
1438.84s:  you have to take it seriously, I think, because the only reason why all of us are in markets is to make money.
1445.48s:  So all of that being said, there is a propensity for options to somehow
1456.40s:  draw the price of the underlying
1460.80s:  where Max Pan exists.
1463.88s:  Now there's a couple of things to know about Max Pan.
1468.84s:  Let me see if I can grab it.
1471.00s:  I think it's from unusual wails.
1474.08s:  I think they have a tool for that.
1481.64s:  Let me see.
1483.68s:  No.
1486.52s:  No.
1493.80s:  I'm looking for the specific plots that I'm trying to find.
1504.00s:  No, no, no.
1508.80s:  No.
1511.36s:  No, I think it's on here, my bed.
1516.76s:  Here we go.
1520.76s:  Might be here.
1523.36s:  No, these are just the Greeks.
1526.36s:  I mean, you could do Delta exposure or something.
1538.36s:  I don't know if this thing does Max Pan does it?
1541.36s:  I thought it did.
1546.60s:  But I'm still getting used to the tool.
1554.12s:  This just looks like the chain itself.
1557.76s:  There's a website that does.
1562.76s:  That does Max Pan by itself.
1565.08s:  Max Pan.
1566.76s:  This website.
1567.84s:  And I think most of you guys are familiar with this one.
1571.76s:  Of Rointit says we've been saying that for a while.
1574.24s:  Yeah, no,
1575.68s:  this isn't new ground.
1577.40s:  There's an important point behind this though,
1579.96s:  because one of the things that retail traders I find tend to do is they automatically
1587.20s:  think Max Pan is causing essentially all movement around expiration.
1594.76s:  And the problem with that is a few things.
1597.76s:  So first things first,
1600.08s:  if we take a look at these different strike prices,
1604.24s:  one of the things that's going to happen naturally in the options chain as time passes
1610.80s:  is we are going to ebb and flow where Max Pan is.
1618.20s:  Max Pan is not static.
1620.72s:  So Max Pan is almost always going to be near the money.
1625.40s:  Almost not always, but almost the reason is because that's where options are most liquid.
1631.84s:  And that tends to be where traders are transacting are front expiration near the money.
1640.20s:  So it creates a near self fulfilling prophecy where stock price tends to follow around,
1648.44s:  move around where Max Pan seems to be,
1652.32s:  but the options market is moving in the background also trading around where stock price is.
1661.24s:  So the important element here is to know Max Pan is not static.
1667.48s:  If we take a look at Max Pan today and we track it against what it is at expiration,
1675.36s:  it will be different.
1678.04s:  That's an important no.
1681.16s:  Pretty much half to track it.
1683.76s:  So this would show Max Pan.
1687.20s:  That's kind of hard to tell.
1688.72s:  It's so skewed. That's actually really interesting.
1690.80s:  How skewed it is.
1695.08s:  Does this show.
1699.40s:  That's kind of a bummer.
1700.76s:  It would have been, I thought they had a thing that showed it like day by day.
1703.68s:  That would, I think, be really, really helpful for people to see like how it moves.
1708.64s:  But Max Pan will move.
1711.00s:  Now that part aside, the other element to know for the market making perspective
1718.56s:  is market makers have the ability to move price.
1726.64s:  How much is difficult to say?
1730.16s:  It's very difficult to quantify.
1733.24s:  In order for them to move price,
1736.56s:  options do not lead the market.
1741.60s:  Options are derivatives.
1744.48s:  The value of an option is derived from the underlying.
1750.80s:  But options positions depending on who holds them,
1755.92s:  sometimes will include hedging activity that includes the underlying itself.
1762.32s:  So that line becomes muddled a little bit.
1766.52s:  So when we have a stock in a situation like GameStop,
1773.84s:  and we have the ability for the stock to either land at 28 or 27.99,
1780.92s:  literally a one penny difference.
1784.28s:  A market maker or group of market makers might be able to force price down
1793.96s:  by selling a bunch of shares just to dip the price down a little bit.
1801.36s:  It's easier said than done.
1803.80s:  And it's more applicable to smaller price movements.
1808.00s:  One of the things I see people say is, oh, they didn't want it to land in 30.
1812.88s:  So they pushed it down from 30.
1815.52s:  I'm not saying whether they did or didn't.
1816.92s:  I couldn't prove it to you either way.
1818.92s:  That's why I wouldn't say whether they did or didn't.
1821.44s:  I don't know.
1823.36s:  But what I can tell you is the further away it is,
1827.56s:  the harder it becomes for an entity to try and manipulate price in that way,
1834.64s:  because if market consensus is for whatever reason, market consensus thinks the stock
1839.44s:  should be 30.
1840.68s:  And then a group of market makers start trying to offload and sell shares or whatever they
1844.80s:  can get their hands on to try to drive price down.
1847.20s:  But the market's like, wait a minute, this is easily worth 30.
1850.32s:  I'm going to buy it here.
1851.36s:  I'm going to keep buying it here.
1852.40s:  That will add buy side pressure to counteract that push down.
1856.88s:  There's a limit to how far price can be manipulated in this way.
1861.72s:  When something is moved by a penny,
1866.36s:  that's not that fucking hard to do.
1868.92s:  It's very, very realistic.
1871.96s:  If the stock could have closed at 28 versus 27.
1875.96s:  99, I absolutely would expect there to be a large group of interested participants,
1884.84s:  market makers, that would rather see this at 27, 99 versus 28.
1890.60s:  That is not as big of a move that they need to try to facilitate.
1895.56s:  And here's what I mean by this.
1898.76s:  If we take a look at the daily volume, the daily volume was
1904.60s:  6.8 million shares.
1907.00s:  Let's grab our little,
1910.20s:  a little dude ad here.
1915.08s:  So 6.8
1921.64s:  or 6.5, sorry.
1924.44s:  6.581.
1926.28s:  6,5886.
1931.16s:  And then let's just say that the mid price on this around would be
1937.08s:  28 and a half, something like that.
1945.80s:  We can calculate what the total value is that moved on the day.
1950.36s:  This is essentially just a V-wap.
1953.08s:  So 6.5, 81, 586,
1957.80s:  times 28.5.
1961.32s:  187,577,201.
1965.80s:  Now, that's the total amount of volume on the day.
1970.60s:  With smaller stocks like this, moving this from
1977.88s:  28,
1981.40s:  27,99 is a pretty small move.
1985.32s:  So even though the total volume on the day, let's just call it,
1988.52s:  it was 188 million in terms of price and value.
1993.80s:  In order to move this by a penny,
1997.08s:  it still requires a subset of this and not an insignificant subset of this.
2003.64s:  We can actually do the math, but it doesn't matter quite that much.
2006.76s:  The point to be aware of is that market makers are incentivized to have more options
2012.44s:  expire worthless.
2014.36s:  If there's a way for them to collude together or with other entities to drive price down
2020.84s:  by a penny, which is the difference between several thousand
2025.32s:  options expiring in or out of the money, they're incentivized to do so.
2030.60s:  This also is not a big gap to cross.
2035.00s:  Very plausible.
2035.96s:  Again, we can't prove it and that's important to reiterate.
2039.32s:  I don't know.
2040.44s:  I can't prove it.
2041.48s:  I have my suspicions, but I can't prove it.
2045.32s:  So I don't know.
2046.92s:  That being said, there's a difference between this scenario and then the people that say,
2053.08s:  well, it should have been at 30, but market makers manipulated it down to 27.99.
2062.12s:  This becomes a big gap to cross because still it's doing 200 million in volume on a day.
2071.48s:  And again, I'm not saying that it couldn't be done, especially if it's broader spread
2075.56s:  collusion and stuff like that easier to detect.
2078.76s:  There's a lot of risk involved in doing that, especially if they're trying to short it,
2083.56s:  and then there's some sort of meteoric rise for some reason or another.
2088.52s:  So this just becomes a taller task is all I'm saying.
2094.20s:  So when we have the conversation around, oh, obviously it's being manipulated for Max Payne,
2101.40s:  there's two things I always want you to remember.
2104.44s:  Closer prices are more accessible to manipulate. Max Payne moves.
2113.96s:  You should be aware of those two things.
2116.12s:  Then whether or not you think manipulation is happening and how to what degree and how far,
2120.76s:  obviously that's all up to you to decide for yourself.
2125.24s:  But you should know those two data points when we look at this stuff.
2128.84s:  Brick and the wall says are there other stocks where this sticks out as much as GME?
2132.84s:  I would actually argue that there's stocks where it's much worse than GME.
2136.20s:  GME is still a pretty big stock.
2138.60s:  So it's doing 200 million total volume in a day.
2143.48s:  If we take a look at total shares, it's 446, I don't know what the current market cap is,
2150.68s:  446, 800, 365, times 27, 99.
2161.64s:  So it's a 12.5 billion dollar company.
2165.56s:  That is not a small stock.
2169.64s:  Where Max Payne and stuff like that becomes really, really pronounced is in small stocks
2176.76s:  because it's much easier and more accessible for market makers to manipulate the price because
2184.36s:  they don't have to use as much total money to do so. GameStop, I think, gets the
2192.44s:  focal point of it because people are looking at it a lot.
2196.60s:  And people are obviously highly, highly interested in the company and the stock. They know about
2202.52s:  market manipulation. So I think that this gets hyper analyzed to that extent.
2209.88s:  When we analyze studies like this, you'll actually notice that there are certain gaps
2217.80s:  in like market cap that are more susceptible to this versus not.
2224.52s:  And the way that they track, by the way, which is ingenious, the way that they track whether or
2230.04s:  not they think in this study is they use a reversal pattern. They say coming into exploration on
2236.52s:  expiration day, what happens to the stock price and then what happens on Monday after Friday?
2241.48s:  Does the stock price immediately rebound up? And then they're using that as a proxy for it being
2247.08s:  manipulated down and then value resumes to the upside. Completely reasonable proxy.
2253.88s:  It's still not perfect though. And I want to be abundantly clear. I am not
2261.72s:  saying it doesn't happen. I'm not saying it does happen. I'm just talking about the phenomenon
2266.52s:  in a vacuum so that people can come up with their own conclusions. That's all I'm doing here.
2272.36s:  Sometimes when I talk about these things objectively, sometimes people will
2277.80s:  sometimes people will think that I'm trying to argue or debate another side of something.
2283.00s:  So yeah, I can grab a, well, the link to the study that I have won't take you to it because it's in
2293.48s:  open browser, but you can literally just type in SSRN and dump in Max Payne. It'll come up.
2301.40s:  Fischau. So that's the, that's the game of Max Payne. There's absolutely a reality. There's
2312.92s:  absolutely an incentive behind it. But that being said, even if we track something like dollar
2319.32s:  delta and whatnot, it'll have, it'll have a different view as price moves. Because as price moves,
2327.96s:  more options are going to be open and closed around different prices. And that's also going to
2334.28s:  interact with Max Payne and whatever Max Payne is. So you can see that where the total dollar
2342.52s:  amount of open interests are. And you can speculate then at those price levels, what might be
2352.68s:  a better spot for a market maker to prospectively try to push price down. And again,
2357.80s:  like the 30 strike is clear as 20, well, 30 strike is going to be heavier than the 28s.
2363.64s:  But still the 28s will have something in them for sure. Here. So interesting stuff. But you should,
2372.20s:  I think, generally, be aware of that.
2377.08s:  Samota says it's not, it's not that they can hold on. It's not even,
2382.52s:  oh, look, I'm struggling reading this, Samota, it's not even can they, the cost would likely not
2389.40s:  be worth it. Okay, the size of the position you would have to justify is ridiculous. Well,
2395.24s:  it's ridiculous to a degree. But again, they are highly incentivized. And if they're not expecting
2401.72s:  that they're actually taking a big risk, it's very possible. The problem like we're talking about
2408.28s:  though is that when it's bigger, when it's a big gap, when we're talking about like five dollars,
2414.36s:  that's difficult to attach and assign Max Payne to. And then it looks like we have somebody from
2420.12s:  Bulgaria. Let's get Bulgaria on our map. We just, we got Bulgaria rep in the set.
2429.72s:  It's kind of crazy. Y'all guy, y'all have fucking ZZ's and threes. Like it's normal. This top
2436.84s:  word looks normal. Stara Zagora. And then this version of it is real tricky to read,
2444.44s:  real, real tricky to read. So we got Bulgaria rep in the set.
2452.60s:  Rowan Titty says it's speculated that they do it to prevent gamma squeeze. That's not, yeah,
2459.32s:  I would disconnect those. So them trying to execute something like Max Payne doesn't
2466.20s:  actually. It's completely different than a gamma squeeze. So I would decouple those in that scenario
2476.04s:  because they're definitely different things. Okay. I'm getting caught up.
2487.40s:  Rowan Titty says it depends who the options chain is loaded up.
2495.48s:  Yeah, I would, it depends how the option chain is loaded up. Exactly. That's exactly correct.
2500.60s:  So I would just decouple the concept of Max Payne from a gamma squeeze. They're just different
2505.80s:  functions. They do different things. From a Max Payne perspective, the market makers are absolutely
2512.04s:  incentivized to have as many options expire out of the money worthless as possible, assuming
2516.84s:  that they are the ones that sold the options to whoever bought them, which is a completely fair and
2522.04s:  safe assumption. That's objectively the case. They're incentivized to do something like that.
2528.20s:  So from that function, the purpose of Max Payne is to save them some hedging cost because
2537.16s:  they're not going to make the money or not based on Max Payne. They still made their money.
2543.08s:  They make the money on the bid-ask spread. It's just can they make a little bit more money,
2548.52s:  which they can, which is why they're incentivized to do so. But Max Payne, like the Max Payne has a
2556.36s:  constraint because it requires quite literal collusion in order to push price. Because if you have
2564.60s:  a stock that's doing $200 million of volume in a day, in order for you as the participant,
2572.84s:  in this case, the market maker, to try and push the price down, you're going to have to put up a
2579.08s:  percentage of that total daily volume in order to make a meaningful move in the price. So that's why
2585.96s:  smaller moves are entirely feasible. Because it's very expensive and it's a big risk for them to
2591.56s:  carry it. But if it's a smaller move, it's easier to carry that risk. But if we're talking like
2597.32s:  trying to suppress price five dollars as a market maker, that's much, much, much more difficult.
2604.36s:  Much, much more difficult.
2607.00s:  Espionore Wall says, I've seen price move aggressively in the last hour to day to get to Max Payne,
2611.32s:  assuming it was un-hege calls that expire at the close could also be self-fulfilling of traders
2615.24s:  or watch your Max Payne. Yeah, what you're seeing there is a few different things. So what you're
2621.08s:  seeing is typically in the last hour of the day, just like the first 90 minutes price moves a lot.
2626.68s:  The second thing that you're seeing is as the last hour of the day is going, you have to remember,
2633.00s:  Max Payne, come towards the end of the day on expiration day, is going to be close to at the money.
2640.92s:  It's going to be close, more often than not. That's not to say that it's guaranteed, but it's going
2644.52s:  to be close. So then at that point, you have options traders who have options that still have
2651.08s:  some value that they're saying, do I want to hold this in expiration and see if it moves
2656.04s:  in my favor? Do I want to scrap what value I can out of this and roll it into another trade?
2660.76s:  And it's a toss up. They probably want to do both. So you're also seeing traders
2665.72s:  transacting and making decisions about their positioning. So it's not inherently a rush to get
2673.48s:  to Max Payne. It's again, a very intricate system that has a lot of different inputs that are
2680.84s:  doing different things at once. Raintiddy says that's when brokers start auto exercising. Isn't it
2689.24s:  the last hour of the two? No, no, no, no, I don't know. I can't say because I don't know most
2695.96s:  brokers, but do options are settled based on the last closing price of the day. So you don't start
2702.04s:  exercising before the close because you don't know where it's going to close.
2709.72s:  And then Samota says not necessarily collusion. Many people do in the same thing look in the same
2713.32s:  direction, synthesize to move in the same direction. But that's the thing is like the participants
2717.24s:  in the options buyers are not incentivized to look in the correct direction. The reason why I would
2724.12s:  wage your it's collusion more than anything for Max Payne to work is because if you had one market
2730.28s:  maker on any any style of frequency on Friday towards the end of the because everything on
2737.88s:  their books is tracked. It's not hidden. So if you have one market maker that happens to be towards
2744.84s:  the very end of the day selling five million dollars worth of GameStop shares short to push the
2751.88s:  price down a penny, that's going to stick out like a sore fucking thumb. So in order to not get caught
2758.44s:  or to decrease risk of being caught, they have to spread it out between other entities.
2764.52s:  Otherwise, it is a big bright flashing sign that's super, super clear as day. So yeah, I think that
2775.88s:  I think that it's very likely that the market makers would be colluding to some degree. Can't
2780.84s:  prove it again. Can't prove any of this stuff. But
2788.28s:  so then Roy and Titi said, oh, okay, so I already answered that one. Cool. All right, so let's grab
2794.68s:  our handbook. So this is the shrunk down version that we should be able to use AI for now.
2804.60s:  And let me see where we left off. I remember how to do this now. I thought I thought the little thing popped up.
2819.80s:  Oh, over here. I remember how to do this. Don't worry. Don't worry. Relax.
2824.68s:  There's no bookmarks. Here we go. Perfect. So this one we can get rid of.
2834.36s:  And then let's see if we can use AI for this.
2841.24s:  I don't know actually how it works. Let's see.
2847.96s:  All right, so we'll let that start processing and we'll start reading through this.
2854.44s:  Roy and Titi says, margin calls is what I was talking about. I meant liquid
2858.76s:  dations and margin calls at 2 p.m. I honestly don't know. I've never had that done. I don't know what time
2866.28s:  that happens. I would imagine that's a little late for a margin call.
2877.00s:  But I don't know. Yeah, I don't know the answer to that one. We're in Titi and I don't want to give
2882.76s:  you a ballman's or oh, damn, you only get to ask it like two questions. This is terrible.
2890.12s:  Let's see if I can get it to work. Summarize this section.
2899.16s:  If you can do it.
2907.16s:  If not, we already have a proven way to do this. I was kind of hoping that this would work though.
2920.68s:  Not that this seems any faster as I'm sitting here waiting.
2929.64s:  Roy and Titi says option exploration and liquidation for options,
2932.76s:  expiring on the same day brokers may liquidate positions as early as 1,600 eastern time. Yep, that
2939.00s:  makes sense. Oh, 2 p.m. Wait, that's different. I don't know where you got that from, but that's wrong.
2948.36s:  The times are wrong because 2 p.m. eastern time is 1,400, not 1,600. Those are 1,600 would be 4 p.m.
2956.68s:  which would be end of day close, which would make sense. To ensure timely settlement and avoid
2962.84s:  potential issues is because options that are in the money at expiration will need to automatically
2967.64s:  be exercised and brokers need to manage their clients accordingly. Yeah, so and in that kind of
2973.32s:  instance, Roy and Titi, I think that whatever the time actually is, I'm assuming it'll be 2 p.m.
2979.32s:  So it's a little bit earlier is that's looking at stuff that's like super deep in the money,
2986.28s:  right? Stuff that definitively is overwhelmingly likely to end up in the money. I don't think it's
2992.20s:  in the case of something that's like at the money, which is an important differentiation.
2997.56s:  Okay, so the section that it provides a detailed analysis of the short interest percent based on
3011.64s:  various data points calculations, the analysis includes references to other users' post
3015.40s:  data such as deep in the money call options and their impact on synthetic shares. The other
3019.00s:  estimates that the current short interest percentage for GME is significantly higher than publicly
3022.68s:  reported figures exceeding 200% of the flow section emphasizes the complexity and potential
3027.32s:  manipulation of the market highlighting challenges and accurately determining true short interest.
3032.84s:  I mean, that sounds right to me. I think that that's also something that we've taken a look at before,
3037.16s:  so yeah, I completely dig that. I think there's no issue from my side with any of that. I dig it.
3045.48s:  Okay, I am opening up a GPT thing though, because we're going to run out. I already used one
3052.52s:  request, so I only get I think like two requests or something, which is kind of lame.
3060.52s:  I need to change the tool.
3063.00s:  Let's try using GROC for this next round. I haven't done this one before, so I'm curious
3078.76s:  how GROC will do. All right, so I think we know most of this. Let's skip through though a little bit
3089.24s:  and see what we come up with.
3093.00s:  I do not believe they're delaying. Oh, this is interesting.
3098.12s:  I do not believe they're delaying. If DDS are hiding, they are satisfying them with fake shares
3103.16s:  and simply hiding. They're ever growing short interest. I mean, I get their point, but I can't
3109.72s:  help but find that a little pedantic because if they're not actually satisfying it,
3116.52s:  it means they're delaying it because then it's not satisfied.
3123.32s:  This is why we never see the FDD squeeze theory play out. When is this from? This is interesting,
3128.92s:  because this has been like really, oh, this is cool. I'm excited now. The reason why I'm excited
3134.84s:  about this is because this is really interesting because this is something that's talked about
3143.48s:  now, like very much current state, which I can't help but find interesting. Also, I wonder if
3149.48s:  there's like a chat GPT or perplexity plug-in for Adobe.
3165.24s:  No, damn. Okay, we continue.
3169.64s:  I'm going to solve a little bit. Okay, so we know this. We see large purchases of out-of-the-money
3180.68s:  puts in the money puts out of the money calls in the money calls. That's like all the options.
3188.44s:  Oh, I see they're trying to explain each. Out-of-the-money puts used to hide short interest. This
3194.68s:  has no effect on price of GME because it's not being exercised and they maintain, oh, I even
3198.76s:  until expiration, shorters are using these to hide short interest from the world. The main
3204.84s:  counter argument to the MOAS is their short interest is 20%. They covered. So if you're shorter
3213.80s:  and you hide your short interest, you can push that narrative and hope people.
3224.68s:  Check out how short interest percent drops when put, oh, I rock it. I'm reading this
3236.76s:  slope. So I'm trying to understand and think through. There's a lot to this. That's a tough one.
3248.52s:  There's a lot to this. Where's figure one?
3258.44s:  Little put, oh, I, I don't want to hold on. What's their, what's their claim?
3289.08s:  Hide your short interest. Use out of the money puts.
3302.68s:  What's the argument here? Do you guys know what the, I'm just struggling to understand the
3312.76s:  position, because from what we read last week, we know that they can use options in different
3318.60s:  ways as locates. But I'm trying to understand the out of the money put.
3331.24s:  I'm trying to understand the out of the money put element of that because if you buy a put,
3336.04s:  let me see if I can figure this out.
3353.72s:  I'm asking chat you be to a couple questions. Well, right now, rock. But
3357.96s:  I'm talking about the stock borrowing programs.
3370.60s:  Yeah, okay. So let me see how specifically are the options used to satisfy local
3388.12s:  security.
3393.08s:  Sell security short without having to read. Yeah, we know all this. Hey, I know all this.
3399.96s:  Be more specific on what exact types of
3408.28s:  used.
3409.40s:  Yeah, covered calls we know. Here we go.
3422.84s:  What is
3429.00s:  that's fine. Those shares at that price thereby satisfying the low-cap.
3433.88s:  Yeah, this is confusing me. I'm going to text Newton question.
3464.68s:  I'm asking Newton based on his research. Essentially what he what he's seen
3485.08s:  for options trades as a satisfying function for locates.
3490.76s:  Because I can see I can see different ways for it to play out. But I'm just trying to follow
3496.84s:  this person's train of thought. And I'm struggling a little bit. It's a little it's a little tricky.
3503.72s:  And the reason why it's tricky is because there's a there's a million things going on in this very
3509.24s:  simple example. So to draw the direct conclusion here of short interest percent dropping when
3519.32s:  put oh I sky rockets. This does not equal causation. I'm not saying it doesn't equal causation.
3528.60s:  But we can't like based on this itself. We cannot make that causative statement. Because when
3535.32s:  short interest becomes super high, a billion other things are going on at the same exact time.
3541.56s:  Same thing when put open interest sky rockets. A lot of other things are going on at a
3548.60s:  point in time. So I'm just trying to see how they're making the direct connection here. And it's
3554.92s:  not immediately jumping out at me. So SPN nor wall says from what I remember was married calls
3565.48s:  puts not just puts. Yeah, well, there is a couple. A couple key ways that they were doing it.
3574.84s:  But Brookheathamall says a way to set their shares to say their shares are real and not synthetic.
3584.36s:  Yeah, no. So I'm familiar with what they're trying to do. The the question I'm having here is
3590.60s:  the relationship that they're identifying here specifically of using out of the money puts to
3595.16s:  hide short and functionally how that how that's happening.
3604.36s:  And the other like the other element of this that just isn't correct slightly nitpicky,
3609.72s:  but still I think worth mentioning at this point is that buying a lot of out of the money puts
3616.76s:  still has still has an effect. It's not it's not a function of whether or not they're
3625.32s:  exercised exercising them isn't the only way for them to have an effect, which is just important
3630.68s:  to know it doesn't really impact this example that much. I wasn't going to bother mention.
3634.92s:  But we got to get the general.
3647.00s:  Getting getting real poofy. I don't know if you guys can tell, but he's like a a fluff master 3000.
3657.40s:  He's very ready for his dinner, I think that's where he's trying to go negotiate. I try to tell
3663.48s:  Mel that we don't negotiate with terrorists, but he always says that he's acute terrorist. So
3670.20s:  he ends up giving in. And now he's down, down for the count.
3677.00s:  Spread it a roll. I'm going to open the door so he can go grab some of it.
3691.40s:  And off he goes. All right, let me get back into the regular screen here.
3699.88s:  Okay, I'll see what Newton comes back with.
3705.24s:  In the money puts are used.
3711.64s:  Cedric says Thor is a god. Yeah, exactly. He that's correct. That's his history.
3718.84s:  He's a little baby. He can't be a terrorist. That's exactly what Mel says.
3723.32s:  So then he's able to run a mock and terrorize crazy. That's absolutely crazy. Lauren says he's
3729.64s:  going to have a ponytail soon like a boomer portfolio manager. I am going to I'm letting him grow
3735.48s:  out to give him the next most ridiculous haircut that I can think of, which is always very
3739.96s:  exciting to me. All right, so in the money puts use the flashcrush price. This is an expensive move
3745.64s:  by Boolean. It's happened once. This is the last to chefe where you mass exercise in the money
3756.84s:  crash the price down.
3764.76s:  Oh, man, I just don't know, bro.
3767.48s:  I've purchased up many more so they might attempt to see.
3781.96s:  I don't understand this thought process.
3786.20s:  Wish I could ask this person questions.
3788.04s:  Yeah, I'm struggling to understand the way that they're thinking about this.
3808.28s:  Use by shorters to filter synthetic shares to rule and satisfy FTDs.
3818.76s:  Interesting.
3832.36s:  Yeah, see, the problem is especially with citing these when the market is going through an
3838.68s:  anomalous period like a lot of this stuff. It's I just I think it's it's disingenuous to make
3848.12s:  very defined statements about correlation and causation. And like I I don't think that they've
3856.92s:  connected any dots as far as I'm concerned. They've connected and identified relationships
3862.28s:  potentially. But I don't see an explanation for the relationships, right? They're they're saying
3870.20s:  that they're used by larger for out of the money calls. They're used by larger players who
3874.28s:  want a profit. The ones were purchased expire on 16 July 21 might be hoping for like it just
3881.72s:  not really to me, it looks more so like they're just kind of explaining their version of things
3886.28s:  as they think they see it, which is okay. But when I'm reading especially due diligence,
3891.96s:  I'm trying to find like researched back connections to stuff, which a lot of these have a lot of,
3899.80s:  which is why I'm applying that one. All right. And I think a lot of this is actually a little bit
3910.12s:  moot now anyways, because well, you guys tell me what is the what is the perception of the shorts?
3920.20s:  Like does the community still think that there's massive droves of shorts out still now that have
3927.08s:  open shorts that haven't satisfied through like the different offerings? Because that's one of
3934.04s:  the things that I spoke with Newton about a while ago, because I think that that's a really important
3942.60s:  consideration when we look at the idea of shorts continuing to hold massive short positions
3950.28s:  without taking some of the risk off in some degree, because it's also there's a cost to carry
3954.76s:  the short positions. So I'm really yeah, okay. So it looks like a little bit of a mixed bag.
3965.00s:  Got it. Okay. We're assuming deep in the money calls are not used to hide FDs, but rather use to
3977.80s:  satisfy. Okay. Mel is paying me that it's dinner time. So I need to figure out what we're going to order.
3997.96s:  I think she wanted barbecue, which I can get down on. Let me get this barbecue order rolling.
4013.24s:  Funny enough, you can't get it from DoorDash though. You got to do it through Uber Eats, which is
4016.92s:  kind of kind of bullshit if you ask me.
4018.84s:  Okay.
4025.00s:  Right.
4027.88s:  Mokin J's.
4031.48s:  Mike's. Looks like we have to do Mike's.
4039.32s:  All right.
4040.60s:  What do you guys think? Try tip? Probably try tip, right?
4056.68s:  Whole pork and try tip.
4060.76s:  I think that's the main thing you can do for a place like this.
4070.84s:  Brisk gets a little too fatty. I don't think that would be for me.
4079.88s:  Bacon bacon pickle spears. Yo, that's that's kind of fucking crazy, don't you think?
4090.68s:  That damn. Don't.
4094.36s:  No, not.
4100.20s:  That's next level.
4102.04s:  Horned red burn ends. I think burnt ends are pretty good.
4108.12s:  I just.
4110.76s:  Texas toast.
4114.76s:  I don't think I want no Texas toast.
4116.92s:  Yeah, I think just try tip and pull pork with.
4124.92s:  Spicy barbecue.
4127.56s:  Orce radish. Yo, these guys are kind of fucking crazy.
4131.80s:  I might need these guys to chill the fuck out just a little bit.
4139.72s:  Nuts.
4142.36s:  Bit of a.
4143.24s:  A bit of a heavy look.
4146.44s:  All right. Well, we're good though.
4148.44s:  We got that ready.
4151.16s:  Jotato says bacon pickle spears sound like something I need more of him.
4154.44s:  I like, I don't know about that man.
4156.12s:  Like that just sounds fucking weird to me.
4159.88s:  Espino or wall says theory is legacy shorts are still open and hidden.
4164.12s:  Was 230 in 2021 and the Jan run was due to game gamma option.
4170.76s:  But then what's the.
4180.68s:  What's the reason for carrying the cost?
4185.96s:  And where do we think that they got.
4189.40s:  Short.
4190.60s:  Because I don't fully understand the positioning then.
4201.80s:  If hold on let me grab treating you.
4207.08s:  That'll be dollar.
4207.88s:  All right.
4217.88s:  Looks like Mel's order is done.
4221.24s:  I'm gonna launch this bad boy.
4223.64s:  What she get.
4225.40s:  She got a fucking barbecue chicken case idea.
4231.48s:  Yo, sometimes I just have a lot of questions about my wife.
4238.28s:  I don't know.
4247.40s:  Guess whatever floats are about.
4250.60s:  That's a weird one.
4255.80s:  Okay.
4267.00s:  Weird.
4268.36s:  Feel.
4270.36s:  Feel.
4270.68s:  I was says I think they shorted again in 22.
4274.68s:  Too expensive to close but why is it too expensive to close.
4284.12s:  And then sp nor wall says I don't believe FTDs would require well FTD.
4288.84s:  FTDs are different than shorts right.
4291.80s:  Okay.
4296.76s:  Because if.
4299.48s:  What.
4301.56s:  Educate me when we say the shorts who are the shorts.
4307.16s:  Because I always took that to inherently mean hedge funds and market makers.
4315.56s:  Like between those two entities.
4317.88s:  So then.
4321.08s:  CDJ says if you accept that they were trying to sell their box to company.
4324.12s:  I think that's exactly what they were trying to do.
4325.32s:  And I think that we could see that.
4326.28s:  That that was what was being done.
4327.32s:  So I agree with that.
4331.32s:  So then.
4333.32s:  But it the reason why I asked the question is because depending on what entities we think the shorts are.
4343.32s:  It was 64 cents March of 2020.
4345.32s:  Yeah.
4346.96s:  Okay.
4347.92s:  So then.
4349.12s:  But they probably weren't getting short at 64 cents right.
4353.20s:  They were probably shorting for some time which is what would be pushing the price down.
4359.04s:  Let's take a look at that really quick.
4361.68s:  The reason I'm asking this I'm trying to understand what the community expectation is of who
4366.32s:  the shorts are.
4367.76s:  How they're holding the shorts because.
4370.08s:  Those lead to different things even in the context of trying to understand this D.D.
4375.68s:  And how they might be managing it and then how they might be holding things still.
4387.36s:  Jotate says I think they believe they'd do it bankrupt sooner rather than later in the four bill cash stockpile.
4391.68s:  So they had no motivation to close their massive losing positions.
4395.28s:  But they that's like they do have a motivation.
4399.20s:  Here's my theory just to just to throw it out there.
4402.72s:  And this is my opinion.
4404.16s:  I don't know.
4405.44s:  It would be very strange to me if there were people that shorted game stop leading into the
4411.92s:  low prices that you're citing of 64 cents in March of 2020.
4415.76s:  That have then just perpetuated their shorts the entire time frame without changing the shorts.
4421.04s:  My guess is they probably have had periods where they've taken pieces of their shorts down
4427.28s:  and then re-engage them if they were inclined to maintain the position.
4431.36s:  Now I also think that there's a reality to your point, Roy and Titty,
4436.08s:  that there absolutely could have been entities that were starting to short the stock
4441.52s:  when it was a dollar.
4443.68s:  And they got ran over so hard that they'd rather just hold the position.
4449.04s:  But there is a cost to hold those open shorts.
4452.64s:  So there's not you can't find a free short because even from like say for example,
4459.20s:  if you try to short a stock on your brokerage platform, you obviously have to borrow the stock.
4466.40s:  And then you have to borrow the stock.
4472.56s:  And then you pay a rate because you're borrowing something that you don't own.
4477.84s:  Now obviously the relationship will be completely different
4481.20s:  with the way that institutions can short they can set up swaps and things like that.
4485.76s:  But even a swap has a cost to carry, which would lead me to believe that
4492.64s:  the constitution of the shorts probably looks different for hedge funds versus the idea of market
4500.80s:  makers having uncovered short positions. My guess is that the constitutions of the shorts would
4506.64s:  be very different. And the way that the shorts are managed would be very different.
4511.04s:  And that's one of the things that confounds me a little bit when I read through the different
4514.24s:  DD because it always looks like we're looking at it from one perspective.
4517.76s:  That's actually what begged the question here because as I'm reading this,
4521.76s:  it still looks like we're continuing to think of the shorts as universal all short all in the
4529.76s:  same boat. And I actually don't think that's likely to be the case because the way that different
4538.32s:  entities would short would look slightly different. And then I think the way that they would maintain
4543.12s:  the short would also look different because the the game of satisfying FDDs from a market-making
4550.48s:  perspective is really important. Obviously, which is why a lot of them would likely find ways to
4555.28s:  satisfy FDDs so that they don't pop up on right-hand stuff like that. That becomes a problem in
4560.80s:  a threat to the business. But for hedge funds, they probably have different ways of maintaining and
4566.24s:  holding the position. And hedge funds are really the ones that would probably be more involved in
4570.48s:  the seller boxing side of things and actually trying to press price down to zero. So that I just think is
4578.80s:  a bit of a breakdown from some of what I've seen here.
4585.04s:  Roentitdy says there's there's a difference between covering and closing and I think a lot of
4590.48s:  I would agree with that and I think a lot of retail doesn't understand that. I agree with that.
4594.56s:  As Pinar well says, anybody brought up Susan Trimbath. Yeah, you guys showed me two or a
4598.48s:  couple streams ago. I actually think we read some of her work for sure. She knows a lot about these
4605.36s:  things and she used to work for the DTCC. Yeah, I think and I think we've looked at some of her work before.
4613.60s:  Let me see.
4635.76s:  Hmm.
4639.68s:  Trying to see if she has a website or something. Maybe her blog looks like she's working for an advisory
4647.60s:  firm right now. Wait, is this the right naked short greedy? Yeah, okay, cool. I'm going to shoot
4660.96s:  her a message right now.
4691.52s:  I'm saying, hey, Susan, my name is Eric. I run a YouTube channel outlier trading and I've been digging
4698.00s:  in and I have been digging into the game stop story for the past. What is this? This is 24
4706.56s:  episodes. So at least the past six months.
4710.72s:  I would love to post you on a podcast episode sometime.
4726.48s:  Episode sometime to chat about your research on FTDs, naked shorting,
4735.36s:  and market microstructure.
4743.60s:  Cool. So email sent.
4753.20s:  Email sent. I will keep you all up to date and see what we can find.
4766.32s:  Oh,
4768.40s:  Rointitie says Twitter. She's real active on Twitter. I can hit her up there too. I normally try to
4773.84s:  shoot them in email first just to because I don't like to put people on the spotlight. Like if she
4779.28s:  doesn't like to do podcasts or something or she doesn't want to do them anymore, I know that she's
4782.32s:  been on other ones, but I try to give them an easy know. But yeah, if they don't respond, then I'll
4788.40s:  typically tap them somewhere like that. Pam says, have the UBS shorts ever been confirmed or
4795.04s:  is it just a good assumption? I've not seen any proof of it. It seems like it's likely to be the
4803.60s:  case. I don't know if anybody has a different experience. But yeah, I've not seen what I would
4811.52s:  consider to be like actual proof of it. We're getting our little grip strength thing going.
4815.84s:  This thing's kind of tough. It has like this little wheel that you can jack up the strength of it
4824.56s:  on. We're just trying not to have like little baby forearms, the nature of the game.
4830.48s:  Rointitie says, how's your back, by the way? Thank you very much for asking. It's completely
4834.56s:  fucked still. But it is ever so slowly getting slightly better. It's definitely less overall
4841.52s:  painful, but it's still, yeah, I'm still locked. Unfortunately, hopefully, hopefully at some point.
4847.92s:  All right. Let's keep going through this. I think we can flip through most of this.
4864.80s:  100% of the volumes. Yeah, so they're kind of attributing all of that to synthetic and stuff.
4872.88s:  Okay.
4877.44s:  Be clear, I'm not concerned about regular investors exercising their free speech online. I'm more
4881.68s:  concerned about bad actors potentially taking advantage of influential platforms. What was this
4886.40s:  with respect to? Was he talking about the cat here?
4895.84s:  Who is he talking about here?
4897.12s:  Do you guys know? I literally have no idea who this is. Well, obviously, no Gensers. I just don't
4908.24s:  know he's talking about.
4915.60s:  Dark Mark says you've been able to change your Getsu at all. No, bro. I've been able to do shit.
4920.48s:  I can I can like hardly sit down. As you guys notice, I have to get up and down pretty
4927.20s:  pretty frequently. But yeah, like I can't hinge at the hip at all. I can get maybe 15 degrees.
4934.00s:  So yeah, I haven't been able to do shit. I've been doing really lame, boring, home,
4944.00s:  and gym exercises. But it's like a fraction of what I typically would do. I'm just trying not to
4950.88s:  stagnate entirely. And you're always always going to keep fighting. So
4957.76s:  Burntittie says no, did you say that before after he made the shitty pie in the face,
4962.00s:  game show commercial aimed at retail investors? I remember that. That yeah, and we looked at that
4967.12s:  not too long ago as well.
4970.88s:  Terrifying share recall. Okay. Seeing a lot of you talk about GameStop, potentially recalling shares.
4977.76s:  Okay, I think we can skip through this because they've not done it.
4983.20s:  Why we're still trading sideways? Interesting. We've made it through an exciting week
4991.68s:  with yet only another day sideways trading. I like to examine why I think we're not launch based
4996.40s:  on the bits and pieces that we know. What do you guys think? In April of 2021,
5003.20s:  why do you guys think it was trading sideways?
5012.96s:  Do a daily. He did it brings you back to the spot that you're at.
5031.04s:  Wish you would just let me stay where I wanted to be.
5034.72s:  So he's talking in here.
5045.44s:  So George says no catalyst. They can't push it down because of the cash pile on the buybacks.
5050.96s:  He says kitty cashed out in the soul of the GME revolution was crushed. My best guess.
5056.88s:  When you all look at these movements from 21, how much of this do you all attribute to retail
5067.60s:  traders versus other entities? Another question.
5073.36s:  Patrick says 5% retail.
5084.64s:  You boys get a sick forearm pump right now. Moving this mouse is going to be real tricky.
5093.36s:  Any other guesses? The reason why I ask is because like the idea of the cat
5101.36s:  caching out and then GME as a movement slowing down is really curious because it then opens
5111.44s:  the question of how do we think about the interplay between other institutions and to Roy and
5120.08s:  Titi's point, the GameStop revolution. Because I agree that the GameStop revolution is the absolute
5128.16s:  heart and soul is the retail trader like without it now. I guess I should say retail investor.
5133.68s:  But the retail investor, I don't think would be the only entity that would move the price.
5142.64s:  It would actually probably be a smaller subset of what ultimately moves the price as compared
5147.28s:  to larger institutions because even the volume on these days is still significant enough.
5153.52s:  This is 130 million. This is 254 million. Like the price movements coming up here, I would
5163.44s:  wager would be really difficult to tie directly to retail. And I would still imagine that a significant
5172.64s:  portion of this would be institutions of some sort trading the general price movements.
5178.80s:  So it's interesting because when I look at the start of this, stocks go sideways. Like it's normal
5190.16s:  for stocks to go sideways. And that's typically when there's a bit of a disagreement between what
5198.64s:  expected price should be for something for whatever the market consensus is, the difference
5205.28s:  between buyers and sellers, trying to find whatever price they think makes sense.
5213.84s:  All right, so let's see. Well, it's alleged at the moment it's clear that some law firms believe
5224.32s:  that there's a case against multiple entities, including DTCC for conspiracy shutting down the
5229.36s:  January 28th squeeze. I agree with that. I think that makes a lot of sense.
5238.24s:  Lauren says, I don't understand why him taking profits at points would upset people so much
5242.40s:  he spoke about trimming positions. Yeah, that's really interesting. I think a lot of people view him
5249.36s:  as essentially the price generator, like the person that moves the price. So I think people
5254.24s:  believe that if he gets out of it, then essentially their price generator has left. So at
5261.12s:  least from my best guess, I think that's mostly why you see that perspective taken by people.
5270.48s:  CDJ says, won't RK have to pay taxes if he gets out of it? If he's in a standard margin account,
5275.36s:  if he's in some sort of tax advantage to count then no. But if he's in a standard margin account,
5280.40s:  then yes. What is this? Members of potential bidders and future auctions to spend clearing
5292.24s:  members remaining portfolio. There are Jenny three views on what is about to happen. The entire
5301.36s:  system and banks are going to go belly up because the scenario described everything short DD.
5306.72s:  I don't think so. They're reacting to increased liquidity requirements stemming from last year
5312.48s:  and the expiration of a cellar. Oh man, I'm confused.
5326.48s:  Next is multiple lose.
5336.24s:  So it looks like they're talking about people positioning for some sort of like big drop or
5340.32s:  collapse. But for some market makers to provide liquidity, say you want a bunch of IGX. Yeah, okay.
5357.68s:  You might be thinking of the DD highlighting more and buff it dump any stocks over the last year.
5361.20s:  We keep in mind and dumps airline stocks. So they're talking about like the expectation of defaults.
5370.72s:  Interesting.
5384.08s:  We're on to he says he would be a really shitty trader to never take those profits. I agree with you.
5389.68s:  And the funny thing is is if he didn't take profits, he wouldn't have compounded anything.
5396.00s:  Because if you have a position on and you don't do anything with it, you don't manage it,
5401.60s:  you don't close it, you don't do anything with it, you can't make any money on it. So unless
5407.52s:  GameStop is a stock just went directly up into the right, which we know it didn't, there's
5412.88s:  no way for him to actually build the wealth that he built by just buying and holding it. And we
5418.56s:  can see that that wasn't his game plan from the beginning because we went through every single one
5424.00s:  of his trades and from the very onset, he used options. So you don't use options unless you're trading.
5430.00s:  That's why Nancy Pelosi obviously is out there slaying an option.
5439.44s:  Okay.
5440.00s:  Johnny says he could build wealth by selling calls against the shares. No, he couldn't.
5453.60s:  Absolutely, he could not. One, because we can see all the way back through all of his original
5462.40s:  portfolio updates, there was never a short call in there. But more importantly, short calls
5469.28s:  at the scale that he hit absolutely could bring him money, but it's not going to build you wealth.
5476.00s:  Short calls, they're defined profit by their nature. So a lot of people are speculating and it's
5484.72s:  it's really interesting to me that people are so adverse to him selling his shares that we willingly
5491.44s:  take the leap into something that's a more convoluted explanation for what likely is to have
5499.92s:  happened because none of us can fully prove it one way or the other, which is very fascinating to
5504.24s:  me because the simplest explanation would be that he very effectively traded around his positions,
5510.96s:  buying low selling high, continuing to do that. But yeah, it goes back to Lauren's point from before,
5519.04s:  people seem to get really, really upset at the conversation of him unwinding his shares,
5524.08s:  which is really, really interesting to me or unwinding options position. Because he's doing the
5531.04s:  right thing. He's trading. That's how you make money as a trader is by moving into and out of
5536.40s:  positions when it makes sense. This talks about other institutional longs choose not to recall.
5544.40s:  This is back on the share recall. We got a calendar.
5555.60s:  Something interesting.
5557.60s:  We need to find a liquidation of failing members. Okay, so I don't think that this actually
5577.12s:  came to pass.
5581.84s:  Interesting. This is also interesting. What did it interesting? Quote?
5588.56s:  Because a lot of times people seem to get upset with RC for making what I would consider
5595.60s:  to be a series of pretty solid businesses, like the better of the company.
5602.96s:  Even though it does absolutely come at the cost of near-term price movements and whatnot.
5610.56s:  So this is interesting because I think there's a great quote from him.
5619.12s:  Jimmy is not a political debate. It's a class war.
5627.20s:  Runtidy says the root of the upset people is people who became bag holders. Yeah.
5631.76s:  And I can see that. I can even see that in the options,
5634.80s:  chains when I look through those and whatnot. That's why I spend actually a lot of time talking about
5639.68s:  how to trade in and out of options so that a trader doesn't necessarily find themselves in that
5647.60s:  scenario because it's always good to, especially as a trader to make money. When you make money as
5653.60s:  a trader, that's a good day. So I think for individual retail traders, they have to integrate that
5662.16s:  into their approach. The buy and hold thing is fine. If somebody thinks that that's the right
5668.24s:  approach for them, but that's also dangerous because if the primary profit mechanism that we're
5673.36s:  talking about is a short squeeze or a gamma squeeze or some sort of squeeze, a big price movement,
5678.48s:  but then there's no expectation to sell, you're unable to monetize the price movement.
5685.20s:  It's just an unrealized gain that sits there and that doesn't ultimately help you buy more shares
5692.72s:  or do whatever the ultimate objective is or take your money out and use that to change your
5697.28s:  family's life, whatever the ultimate objective is. So that's been a pretty consistent breakdown as
5704.88s:  far as I can see with the logic of people that are hoping for some sort of squeeze, but then they
5710.32s:  don't have at least some sort of exit plan in place to monetize it because otherwise you can go
5717.60s:  through the short squeeze, but then you might emerge at the other end, which is cool, but you might
5723.60s:  emerge at the other end with no more or less money than what you started with, which is, I don't
5729.20s:  know, I think that that would be the not not the objective. All right, so here's our leaveoff points
5737.44s:  for 14 Ds. And then I don't know if we're going to have one of these next weekend because I'm going to
5748.80s:  be traveling. I'm still going to stream intermittently next week, but I'm going to be popping around
5755.60s:  a little bit. Yeah, I don't get in. Oh, actually, I might get in in time. Maybe we'll see.
5763.28s:  I might get in a little bit too late for a stream on next Saturday. I don't want to go through
5770.08s:  this one yet. I'm going to save this one. Cool. Anything else that we should hit before
5778.96s:  we bounce?
5789.60s:  This thing has been so volatile. There's just from, I mean, that's how I found my way into it with
5804.80s:  the options trading space. We really cherish volatility. And this thing has had so much of it.
5818.32s:  Pam says in the congressional hearing, he even mentioned how the money he made in on GS was
5825.20s:  going to go a long way. He didn't die in hand, obviously. Yeah, well, and I think that's the
5830.00s:  other thing that happened with the game stop stuff is that that clearly went into what he
5836.40s:  rightfully labeled a yolo portfolio where he was just saying that somebody that took $100,000
5844.00s:  at the onset. And they said, this $100,000, it's a lot of money, but I can make that again,
5848.72s:  or I'm good without it. And I'm going to see what I can do with it. That's exactly what that was,
5854.24s:  which is very cool. Roryntady says, buy and hold came from the principle that the flow was being
5859.28s:  locked up in the shorts needed our shares and would be forced to buy at any price. New retail
5863.92s:  had no idea how any of this worked and behaved. That's what would happen. So the diamond forever
5868.88s:  not understanding the marketing mechanics. Yeah. And that's, I completely agree because especially
5872.80s:  for the people that are talking about like buy hold, D.R.S., that's fine too. But the main thing is
5879.44s:  for those kinds of people, if you do that, you don't monetize the move. And that's why like the move
5885.04s:  here from 14 up to 64, you can make a lot of money on it. You can make a lot of money on it.
5894.64s:  But if you buy and hold and your shares are D.R.S., you've essentially made, which still isn't
5903.04s:  bad, by the way. But like you essentially would have made that what nine and change and you're
5908.88s:  sitting at 28 now. But you had an exit point here to be, shit. From, I mean, there's just so many
5924.00s:  potential exit points for somebody that was getting in pre squeeze here. So yeah, it's just,
5929.76s:  that's a long holding period from here to here to go from five or nine and then to be sitting at
5936.40s:  28 after four years or five years when all of these individual spikes can be monetized. And
5945.20s:  I mean, you guys, I keep it completely straight with you guys. I hold shares just as a play of
5953.52s:  solidarity with the apes. But it's a very small subset of my total capital. And what I do mostly with
5962.24s:  GameStop is I trade the movements because it moves really well. And there's a lot of ways to,
5967.52s:  again, monetize the movements. But buying and holding, especially something like this, it will,
5974.16s:  will take a little bit of time. I think the company looks good. I think the prospects of the company
5979.04s:  turning around are really strong. But I do think that the company is positioned well. But that kind of
5985.12s:  stuff still takes time to eventually come to the surface, which that's what people will have to
5991.04s:  be willing to hold through. And even that, they need to have an exit here, an exit plan in order
5997.60s:  to eventually make the money. Because otherwise it just sits as an unrealized game, which is cool to
6003.20s:  have. But you that doesn't pay bills. And that's not the the thing that will ultimately change,
6010.40s:  you know, somebody's life that they'll they'll want to find ways. Even if it's one of the easiest ways
6015.68s:  things can do is take partial profits. I'm in the process of making a couple different
6021.52s:  videos for GameStop on how to essentially trade a stock like GameStop with some different
6027.60s:  strategies to give people ideas. But even if you want to buy and hold in DRS, some of your shares,
6032.88s:  you can have some of it that you're, you know, actively moving in and out of to then slowly
6037.84s:  accumulate more shares in your base share position or something like that. There's different things
6042.80s:  folks can do. But I just want to see people be able to hit their objectives because I know a really
6049.12s:  big part of the GameStop community and the apes is people are looking for a change in their lives.
6055.60s:  They're literally looking for something to lead to a significant change in their current life,
6061.12s:  scenario, their life perspective, the situation that they're in. And I want to see people be able to
6067.92s:  do that because trading is unequivocally done that for me. Like it literally has done that
6072.08s:  exact thing for me. So I know it can be done. But I also know that you kind of have to think through
6077.84s:  what you're trying to do in order to get the outcome you're looking for. So I hope people can
6083.20s:  continue finding their way there. I really, really do. We'll see. But I'm bullish on people's
6093.12s:  ability to learn and grow, especially with everything that's available now. I think the retail
6098.48s:  trader and the standard ape that exists now are continuing to get really fucking smart. And I think
6106.88s:  that that just bodes well for what they're what they will eventually be able to do. We will see
6114.16s:  time as always will tell. All right, gang, that wraps me up for today. As always, if you need anything,
6121.12s:  hit me up in the discord. And I will see you guys during one of the live sessions. I do one
6126.24s:  every single day at 5 p.m. Pacific time. So I'll catch you guys all throughout the week. Be an
6130.96s:  outlier, be an ape. I'll see you all later.
