0.00s: Managing an options portfolio is completely different than pretty much any other portfolio
5.72s: you can think of because options behave very differently.
10.96s: So what I want to walk you through on the left hand side here is some core concepts.
15.72s: Then I want to walk you through the three levels that I manage my portfolio through.
22.40s: And then at the end of the video, I'm going to walk you through exactly how I split out
26.88s: my portfolio and think about deploying it.
30.20s: What's up everyone?
31.20s: Eric here.
32.20s: Welcome back to the outliers.
33.20s: Shout out to the Patreon family.
34.56s: Consider signing up for weekly workshops, all sorts of fun, extra content.
39.40s: But let's get right in.
40.80s: So what are the core concepts here for managing a portfolio?
44.64s: Well, it all starts with this.
48.00s: Begin with the end in mind.
50.56s: What does that mean?
51.56s: Well, you kind of have to define what you're trying to do in order to stand a good
56.86s: chance at completing it.
59.38s: So if you think about what most of our goals are in trading, it's things like achieve a
63.82s: certain percent return per year.
66.54s: It's be able to make a certain amount of monthly income.
69.90s: It's reduce portfolio draw down.
73.22s: Those are great goals.
74.42s: But you have to figure out what works for you and what makes the most sense.
78.34s: And you might be wondering how to do that.
79.94s: And it's really, really simple.
81.74s: You can navigate to my website.
83.58s: Come over here to the resources.
85.22s: Go to the compound interest calculator.
87.98s: And you can figure out what you need.
90.70s: This is it.
91.70s: This is beginning with the end in mind.
92.70s: So if you're starting with a $15,000 trading account, you want to have a million dollars
97.86s: in 25 years.
100.18s: Let's say, well, at this current run rate, 10% per year, your $15,000 is going to give
105.54s: you 162, 520.
106.54s: We have a long way to go.
108.86s: So now maybe we need to focus on saving some money.
111.74s: Maybe we can get $1,000 per month on average over the long run.
116.46s: And then boom, all of a sudden we're there.
118.54s: Maybe you don't want to do $1,000 per month because that's a little expensive.
122.14s: You want to do something like $750 a month.
126.98s: And then you think, okay, that gets you there too.
130.10s: Maybe you could do a little bit better.
131.86s: Maybe instead of 10%, you think you could do maybe 15%.
136.10s: And see where that lands you.
137.90s: So the point is, this shouldn't be completely random.
141.14s: You should figure out what your roadmap looks like.
144.98s: And then you have to ask yourself these two questions.
149.90s: Are your goals realistic?
152.14s: What makes you think they're realistic?
154.26s: So are they realistic means if a trader says to me, I want to make 25% per year.
158.66s: Totally cool.
159.66s: Is it doable?
160.66s: Of course.
161.66s: Is it doable for that trader?
162.66s: I have no idea.
164.06s: Does that trader know?
165.66s: Probably if they're asking the question, I imagine.
167.46s: They don't know either, which probably tells me that they're shooting way too aggressively.
172.34s: In my opinion, in the beginning, the best target is avoiding drawdowns.
177.82s: And that's simply because they set you too far back.
180.86s: And you don't gain that much from trying to have these crazy good returns early on if
187.18s: you're drawing your account down in pursuit of them.
191.18s: So once you have a bit of a track record, three months paper trading, six months paper
196.26s: trading, and you have some ideas of what you're able to do, then you can decide whether
201.26s: or not your 25% is realistic.
203.58s: But you can have whatever goal you want that doesn't mean that it's going to happen.
207.70s: It's up to you to make it happen.
210.30s: And man of fasting only gets you so far.
212.98s: So now as we move in closer, we have our objective.
217.38s: We need to approach this entire thing, understanding that options move.
223.02s: You might be thinking, no kidding, as you should.
225.62s: The problem is so many people, they think about the trade as they're putting it on.
229.62s: And they're not thinking through the life cycle of the trade.
232.78s: So that's going to be a core concept that you got to keep in mind as we go through this.
236.14s: The next couple, for me, I like to think about breaking my portfolio into different allocations,
241.02s: a core and speculative.
242.62s: We'll get into more detail on that later.
244.62s: You just have to come up with a general guiding feature for how you're going to use your money.
250.62s: The next thing here is making sure that as we're looking at our entire portfolio, we
254.94s: want to de-conflict positions.
258.34s: We want to use stuff that behaves differently, that we have different profit mechanisms that
262.46s: we're tapping into, that we have different durations that we're looking at, different
266.42s: correlations.
267.90s: That's my approach.
269.50s: Other people can have a fastball meeting, they have one specific style trade, and they
273.86s: like one specific duration, that's okay too.
276.46s: But the idea here is to make sure that whatever you're doing fits into the broader portfolio
281.46s: effectively.
283.46s: The trade returns is going to come up a million times during this.
286.62s: When you're looking at managing a portfolio, you're looking at the culmination of a bunch
291.02s: of different positions that interact with one another over time sustained.
295.74s: We need to really focus on how these different positions behave in relation to one another.
301.18s: The big takeaway from this concept section is that there's no right answer.
306.78s: It's dependent completely on you.
308.86s: If your goal is to aggressively grow your portfolio, you might have a different approach.
314.26s: If your goal is to defensively manage your portfolio, meaning avoid draw downs, you're
318.46s: going to have a different approach.
319.62s: You have to figure out what you're trying to do, and then start solving the problem from
324.46s: there, which we're going to get into on this side.
327.14s: The other thing is just avoid this idea of blanket rules.
330.58s: They're stupid.
331.58s: So things like, oh, nobody ever went broke taking profits.
335.34s: The problem is eventually you can.
336.86s: As soon as risk is eventually realized, it can be enough to wipe out all your profits,
341.22s: and you can lose money.
342.62s: All I'm highlighting here is make it make sense.
345.02s: Go back to this expected return.
346.66s: If you're putting on risk and managing a portfolio with expected return, then it makes
351.38s: sense.
352.38s: But trying to stick to general blanket rules like that, I think are too boxy, and they
357.38s: miss too many potential details for a trader.
360.18s: So as we move through the rest of this, these are the three questions you should be able
364.46s: to answer at any given point in time about your portfolio.
368.06s: Do you understand your portfolio's entire risk at a given point in time?
372.90s: And we'll take a look at how to do that well.
375.22s: Does your portfolio reflect your disposition to look at what that means?
379.90s: Do you need manage anything?
382.14s: Take a look at that.
383.58s: Let's start with the top level.
384.90s: This idea of disposition.
386.38s: What is this?
387.62s: This is where I look at these different market inputs.
391.30s: Like, what's the economy doing?
392.90s: Do we have an expanding or contracting GDP?
395.82s: We in a high inflation period or a deflationary period?
400.18s: Are jobs growing effectively or not?
403.66s: All those details matter.
405.82s: And as you'll notice, it moves from zoomed really far out economy.
409.78s: Then we're going to look at the stock market as a whole.
412.26s: The individual indices and the relationships to one another.
415.38s: The sectors, what sectors are outperforming underperforming.
419.02s: What are the primary themes of the current environment that you're investing in?
426.38s: And are there any events coming up?
428.38s: This is the first layer of developing a disposition.
431.50s: And it might sound like a lot.
433.14s: But once you get good at looking at things, this takes just a few moments.
437.18s: So you can say, well, right now some of the primary themes is AI has been coming out
441.26s: really hot and there's a lot of speculation around that.
444.98s: AI has been on an absolute tear and it's going to need to deliver extremely well in order
450.38s: to not have a pretty significant drawback.
453.74s: So those kinds of things can paint the way we think about the entire market and then
459.06s: how we choose to structure our portfolio.
463.54s: So our portfolio should align with the way that we think about our disposition.
469.18s: So for example, if I go through the disposition phase and I look at a contracting economy,
474.38s: the market looks really weak.
475.90s: We're seeing a lot of negative breadth.
478.26s: We're seeing the indices trending down.
480.82s: I'm going to have a generally bearish disposition.
483.74s: Do I want to have a really long bias portfolio if I have a bearish disposition?
489.54s: Probably not.
490.82s: So the idea here is to make sure that what you're doing in your portfolio aligns with what
495.06s: you think the market and the economy looks like it's doing.
499.14s: Now at the portfolio level, there's a bunch of things we need to look at.
502.38s: We need to look at how we're allocating our money.
506.02s: So what trades get what amount of money and on the next part of this, you'll get a look
509.86s: at how I think about that.
512.38s: Utilization, how much money you want to move at a given point in time.
515.42s: So if you're in a disposition where you think we're in kind of a transitory phase and you
521.86s: want to see what the market's going to do, well, maybe you lighten up your utilization
525.86s: at that point.
526.86s: Or if there's something that has you really convicted and you want to use way more
530.54s: money because you have strong conviction, well, maybe we jack up our utilization so
534.50s: that aligns with their disposition.
537.02s: Beta-weighted Delta's, this is a really great way to assess your portfolio risk.
542.70s: It takes all of the different positions that you have and it puts it into a common language.
546.38s: I'll drop a video in the description below that walks through beta-weighted Delta's
550.34s: in detail.
551.34s: This is a go-to for me.
552.78s: So in a nutshell, these first three are super important to me.
557.02s: This is going to tell me how much money am I ready to use in my portfolio?
560.50s: How much money am I currently using right now?
563.06s: And what is the directional disposition of the portfolio?
566.86s: So if I look at my beta-weighted Delta's and their 10 spy beta-weighted Delta's, all
572.90s: that means is that the entire portfolio is behaving like 10 shares of spy.
577.42s: Is that a lot?
578.42s: Is that a little?
579.42s: Does that align with my disposition?
580.94s: That's going to be a starting point for what I do here on out.
584.42s: I'm going to review the number of positions I have, what their sizing is because, again,
588.90s: remember, options move.
590.58s: So as they move around, the no-sional size of your positions can change as your Delta's
595.58s: change.
596.58s: So you have to make sure that the position is sized and operating as you want.
600.74s: I like to look at broad-level portfolio Greeks.
604.06s: What's my portfolio of theta?
605.74s: Am I taking in net money or am I paying net money?
608.74s: I prefer to be positive theta in the portfolio.
612.38s: What's my portfolio gamma?
614.10s: How fast is my portfolio Delta going to change?
617.94s: You can devise all of that from your portfolio Greeks, which are really useful tools.
622.26s: The correlations is really important as you're putting on new positions and adjusting
625.78s: old positions because let's say that you have 10 positions on, but nine of them behave
630.62s: like the same thing.
632.22s: You might have more risk than you think you do.
635.26s: Beta-weighted Delta's will help you see that, but so will monitoring the correlation between
639.18s: the different products that you have on because the relationships change.
643.34s: Great example of this is the way that bonds behaved against equities during 2020 to essentially
649.90s: 2024.
651.94s: That way now to a degree, kind of normalizing more recently.
655.42s: But that relationship changed.
657.30s: So you might have been banking on it behaving a certain way, but then it didn't.
660.94s: I like to diversify my strategies so that I'm using different kinds of strategies because
666.30s: I know that they will behave differently.
667.94s: That's more of a preference and then circuit breakers.
670.70s: Other breakers is saying at the portfolio level, if I experience a X percent portfolio
677.90s: level drawdown, I'm going to start closing positions.
681.38s: It's a tough decision and you have to figure out what that might look like for you.
684.82s: The reason why I like to use circuit breakers is because it keeps me from becoming paralyzed
689.22s: if things are not going well and I need to make some changes to what I'm doing.
693.74s: So thinking of those ahead of time and understanding that there's a possibility that you run through
698.46s: your circuit breakers, if it's 25%, your portfolio draws down 25%, you start cutting positions
703.58s: and then it rebounds back up.
705.78s: That might feel absolutely terrible.
708.42s: But if that's the way that you're perceiving the markets, you're at a disadvantage from
712.10s: the jump because just as you might be going through a 25% drawdown here, well, guess what?
718.22s: You might have gotten out at 25% when it drops another 25%.
722.94s: Or you could get out at 25% and then it rullies back up and you're like, damn, I didn't
726.58s: need to take that loss.
727.94s: You have to figure out what's right for you and your risk tolerance.
730.46s: You might not even really need to have big portfolio circuit breakers, but it's really
734.42s: to make sure that you're not missing anything that's going to hurt you.
737.86s: Last thing, position.
739.42s: So now we have our disposition towards the market, the economy.
742.54s: We now know how we want our portfolio to look and what we're looking at in the portfolio.
747.70s: Now we just need to make sure that each individual trade fits the puzzle of the portfolio.
753.74s: So the first thing I'm going to look at with every single position is, do I need to manage
756.90s: it from P&L or taste expiration, meaning am I at a profit management point, a loss management
762.38s: point, or have I been in the trade long enough that I need to manage it based on time?
766.70s: What are the Greeks of the individual position?
768.98s: Do all of those look aligned with my expectations based on when I entered it?
772.30s: And does it still make sense for the portfolio?
774.78s: Do I have any events coming up that I have to be aware of?
776.90s: Is earnings coming up soon?
778.74s: Based on all of those things, if I'm still in the clear, there's nothing has to be done
782.90s: with the position.
783.90s: I'm going to make sure that my thesis is still good.
786.42s: And once I'm done with the position, I'm going to update my trade log.
790.22s: I'm going to make sure that there were no events that I missed that popped up in the
794.34s: middle of this thing that I wasn't aware of.
796.62s: And always ensure that the trades that I'm putting on have a positive expected return.
802.86s: So that's just a general flow for what this can look like.
806.94s: So again, we have our disposition towards the market.
810.10s: We figure out how we want our portfolio to look and then we make sure each individual
813.78s: position fits into this.
815.62s: So if we're bullish, we want to have long spy beta-weighted deltas.
821.42s: We're going to look for positions that complement that.
824.10s: Now we start putting on a bunch of positions where long a bunch of calls and different things,
827.74s: but I said I like being long theta, meaning I'm collecting theta on a daily basis.
832.86s: So that means I'm going to have to put on some positions that bring in theta that may
836.46s: be tamper down some of my risk because after I put on all of those long calls, I'm actually
840.54s: a little bit too long for what I want.
844.18s: And I can use that as an opportunity to tie in two different things.
848.02s: I need a position that gains me theta.
850.18s: And I also need something to tamper down my risk a little bit so I'm not too long.
853.70s: It's exactly how all of these fit in with one another.
856.74s: So now quickly, I want to walk you through just how I split my portfolio between these
861.54s: two buckets core and speculative allocation across a few metrics.
866.94s: So what's the total allocation I'll give to my score, my score, my core and speculative
873.22s: trades?
874.22s: I guess that's the combination of both of those.
876.38s: For the core allocation, it gets up to 100%.
878.34s: I'm happy to use the entire portfolio on a core allocation.
881.38s: First speculative, I'm okay using up to 60% of my capital.
885.74s: This gives me a lot of room.
888.58s: Now I very, very would get anything close to that.
891.14s: And more importantly, this is going to be completely dependent on how speculative you
895.10s: like to be as a trader and how you like to set up your risk.
899.30s: For position sizing, I will use up to 100% on the core allocation.
905.58s: For an individual speculative trade, I will risk no more than 10% of the portfolio value.
912.38s: So while I might be using a lot of the portfolio, I'm not going to allow the risk that's
919.22s: in each trade to exceed 10%.
921.50s: So what's up with this?
922.66s: Why do I do this?
923.66s: Well, the core allocation for me is the primary way I'm looking to meet my annual return
929.94s: objectives.
931.26s: Now I can't always get it through the core allocation because in these next two you'll
936.66s: see the profit mechanisms that I'm using are things like positive drift, sector rotation
941.98s: and momentum.
943.14s: So I'm trading things like indices and ETFs.
948.82s: If we're in a bear market, this ain't going to work that well.
952.50s: So I need to lean more heavily and use more money in my speculative allocation in order
958.54s: to make up the difference using some of these other kinds of strategies.
962.82s: So you can see the strategies that I use in both the different kinds of profit mechanisms
967.02s: that I'm looking to take advantage of.
968.98s: What I'm looking to do is lean on the core allocation as much as I can.
973.14s: And then as soon as that's coming up short on my monthly targets, because I take my annual
977.26s: targets and break them down into smaller targets, monthly targets.
980.66s: If I'm coming up short or if there's a big change in market conditions, then I'll rotate
984.10s: over to the speculative allocation and try to leverage this a little bit more.
989.10s: Conversely, if I'm doing great and my core allocation is meeting expectations and exceeding
994.22s: them, then I'll still use my speculative allocation, but I just become very selective.
998.66s: I'm just looking for really great looking opportunities to complement the return performance
1004.66s: of the portfolio.
1006.38s: So that's it in a nutshell.
1008.02s: The way I think about managing a portfolio starts with these three levels, gotta be able
1012.82s: to answer all these questions.
1014.70s: And it's a big puzzle that has to fit together.
1017.14s: As always, if you have any questions, let me know.
1018.70s: Be an outlier.
1019.70s: See you guys later.
