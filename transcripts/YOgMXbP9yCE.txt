0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here with a few updates to the small stacks portfolio.
5.28s: So I wanted to give you a couple of updates on some trades that I made,
10.24s: and then just some new adjustments kind of to the overall approach.
13.92s: So let's take a look at the screen here.
17.92s: First off, I talk about most folks first year trading,
23.56s: and I always say that the main goal should be consistency and being profitable.
30.44s: Okay, so that part aside, what I wanted to do is set some goals now that this account's been trading for a couple of weeks,
41.48s: we kind of have an idea of what this looks like for us.
44.28s: So the first goal that I think is reasonable if I were to give myself a goal starting out again with the $5,000.
51.64s: I would probably target something like 8%, I think is fair, and then my stretch goal would be 15% for the year.
59.32s: And the reason why I like those, really that that 8% is smaller accounts have a hard time returning kind of meaningful amount of money.
71.48s: So that's why I want to focus on the percent, not so much the dollar amount.
75.32s: And the reason why I say that is because, you know, if you look at returning 8% on a $5,000 account, it's four-ner bucks, you know,
83.08s: who really cares, same thing at 15%.
85.96s: And then what I even did is broke that down to a monthly target.
89.24s: So if I wanted that 8%, it means I would need to make $34 a month and for 15% at $63 a month.
97.32s: All of those in and of themselves really don't mean that much.
102.68s: The reason why I continue to pound on this, you know, drum reiterating over and over and over again that this small account
114.60s: isn't the account we're trying to grow.
116.92s: You need more money if you want to really make money investing.
121.48s: You need more money than $5,000.
123.24s: You're not going to turn this into your nest egg.
125.64s: So what I'm truly focusing on is developing a consistent approach that I know I can apply.
133.08s: And the reason why that becomes powerful is as this slowly starts to more from a $5,000 to a $50,000 to a $250,000.
144.60s: To a $500,000 account, to a $1,000,000 account, to a $2,000,000 account.
150.60s: All of a sudden, these figures start to mean something.
156.20s: So for example, if you're using something like a $1.25 million account whenever you get to that space,
166.52s: if you can still return that same 8% that you're building the skill set for now,
173.24s: instead of that being $400 for the year, that's going to be $100,000 for the year.
178.04s: So you're going to make, again, if you can maintain consistency, you're going to make $8,300 a month.
187.56s: So my point is focus on the skill set. Let this account continue to grow.
193.80s: This will help you modestly move towards that goal. But if you're first starting out with
199.08s: pretty much anything less than $100,000, you really need to focus on saving money.
204.20s: Because once you start getting over $100,000, that's when the amount of money that you can make starts to
210.04s: really help compound your growth. But when you first start out, it's still going to compound,
216.12s: but it's relatively small. And it's important to understand the context of all this.
222.36s: And then if you sit there and you say, well, what the hell's the point? Just remember, right now,
226.92s: a CD account, I just looked them up, right today. The one year CD, the highest I could find is 0.9%.
234.76s: So if you take that $5,000, you put it in a CD account, you get $45 for the year.
239.88s: So for the younger folks that look at this and they scoff at the figures because it's a low amount,
246.60s: I totally understand and identify with you. You really got to focus on the bigger picture here.
252.60s: This isn't, you're not going to turn $5,000 into your next big sum of money.
256.52s: You're right now we're building a skill set that as your money slowly grows via investing,
262.52s: and most importantly, as you're saving, this is the skill set that's going to help you. It's not
268.20s: going to be too many folks want to make, too, I think, too much money on whatever they have. And it
276.84s: just leads to a completely untenable approach that doesn't really help us when it comes time to
284.68s: start delivering on a larger sum of money. So just keep that in mind. So here's what I wanted to
291.16s: talk about in the portfolio. This is what we're looking like these days. I closed out Pfizer yesterday,
298.68s: that was a $402 profit in total, which is a good trade for that.
304.36s: So if we take a look right now, total PNL in the account is 557, actually no, it should be a little bit
316.12s: more than that. Total PNL in the account should be $581. I forgot to add the covered
325.88s: strangle to the PNL. So that needs to get updated. So we made 402 in the Pfizer trade as a whole,
334.28s: we made 155 in Kruger right now, realized PNL. And then in XLF, we made 24 bucks. So all in all,
344.04s: we're at $581 profit, which is about 10% return, a little over, which is really good,
349.96s: starting on a 5K account, essentially two weeks in. That's something that I think is great performance.
356.20s: And I would love to maintain it, but I totally expect there to be a little bit of pain along with
364.36s: this. So right now, we're pending what is it's $109, that's out, which represents about a 2% return
377.32s: on the current account value of 5581. So overall, I am pleased with where the account looks.
385.72s: Utilization is just over 3,000, which is just shy of 54% utilized. And that is one of the
393.64s: beauties of trading the way that I trade is I'm continuing to make a really good return on the
398.04s: account. And as I'm starting to make money and fine opportunity, I don't have to utilize as much
402.92s: to get there. So what I did end up doing today is establishing a new call diagonal in Bank of
410.36s: America. So I am now long the 18 June 21 18 calls paid $8. That's an 81 delta. And then I sold
420.28s: this 16 October 26 calls at 82 cents. So that's going to be a little over 10% return on invested
426.12s: capital for that trade would be pleased to make that money. That's something that you know,
431.96s: completely reasonable for this account. Now of note, Kruger still has no short calls on it.
438.60s: I have not put any short calls on the trade because although I can still make a little money
443.88s: on the short calls, it's not enough for what I would want to make. I want to make sure I stay
449.56s: at the 35 strike to be above my critical strike on the shorts. So I'm essentially waiting until I
458.44s: can make more money. And I'm okay with that. There's no real pressure on me in that position
465.08s: right now. It's showing the leaps are showing obviously a loss. But just takes a little time for
471.56s: the trade to start working out. We already made $155 in the short call. So we have some time to
477.88s: go in here. And remember this Kruger trade, I allocated $1,500 for it. And we're about allocating
485.40s: because I scaled in a little bit. Whereas on the Bank of America trade, I'm also allocating $1500
491.48s: but we only have a one lot I'm expecting to scale into this trade as well once we have some time.
497.08s: So again, of note, for Bank of America, it's at a one-to-one ratio. I typically don't like to do that.
504.12s: But again, small account work constrained by capital. I'm starting with a one lot expecting to
509.48s: scale into at max a two lot on the calls, the long calls. So it is what it is. Once I am able to
518.52s: have two long calls, I likely will only sell one call against to unlock that upside. Now, Bank
525.48s: of America does have earnings coming up on the 16th of next month. And my expiration is for the 16th.
532.68s: So what I'll end up doing is taking those short calls down before earnings and probably laying
537.88s: out additional short calls on earnings or very close to earnings so that I can capitalize on the
544.44s: increase in pli volatility for that expiration cycle. And see if we can make a few extra dollars
551.48s: again on the smaller account because that's what the name of the game is. So right now, this is what
557.88s: our call diagonal looks like in Bank of America. Notice no upside risk to this diagonal
565.56s: test meant to the way that I structure them so that there is no upside risk focusing on delta management.
570.92s: And then once we're able to add another leap or these aren't leaps, once I'm able to add another
577.80s: long call, at some point, this is more what it will look like. But as of right now, we're going to stick
582.84s: with one long and then scale into the position in the future. So that about wraps up where I'm at
589.80s: in the small stack portfolio of few things that I want to make sure are taken into account as we
597.24s: get closer to the election, I am going to continue scaling out out of all of my accounts, including
602.76s: this one. And it's just because I view that as a very large binary event, the market has been
607.88s: extremely emotional. So I will continue to maintain exposure as I always do, but I will be mindful
615.00s: what I have out leading into it because I just don't want to expose myself to that risk. I don't see
621.96s: a good return on that risk. So I will be following through with that as we continue along.
629.08s: So if there are any questions or any trade ideas, anything like that, feel free, reach out,
635.16s: let me know. I still have $2,000 to use in this account a little over close to $2,500. So
641.64s: plenty of opportunity to be had once I see it, but I am not forcing any trades because I don't
647.64s: need to. Right now we're maintaining good progress. We're at a good return on the account. So
655.00s: I'm happy where things are right now. All right, until next time, I'll catch everybody later.
