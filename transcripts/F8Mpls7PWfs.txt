0.00s: Well, well, well, what's up outliers?
3.38s: Happy Friday, great to be here with you all.
6.56s: I have everything set up ready for us to rock and roll actually a pretty light session
13.68s: in terms of presentation.
14.68s: Got to move the chat over here.
17.40s: So I keep an eyeball and also to say hello to everybody.
22.60s: So yeah, if you're here, don't forget to pop in the chat and say hi so that I can say
28.44s: hi back.
29.44s: I'm just like we have a handful of folks already to kick us off.
31.92s: I see there's Scott from earlier.
34.68s: I see Joseph Paul O'Tom fan of airplanes, Jay, lots of familiar faces, which is awesome.
42.00s: That's one of my favorite things about doing these Shrejay Justin, Shrejay, it's great
45.68s: to see you, man.
47.68s: It's kind of the fun part, Rude Abega.
50.00s: Can't forget that name.
51.32s: That's fucking hilarious.
53.40s: Zach, great to see you as well.
56.20s: Sweet.
57.52s: It looks like the the Gangs and Town.
59.68s: All right.
60.68s: So what are we doing today?
62.68s: Well, there's a handful of things that I want to cover.
65.72s: Mill Spectre to see you as well.
68.12s: In the past handful of sessions, we really have dove pretty deep into a lot of the basics
78.56s: of options trading.
80.48s: Kind of a lot of these random things that we should be aware of how they work, how they're
86.04s: priced, those kinds of things.
88.92s: So what I want to actually look at for some of this session is threefold.
94.08s: The first thing is I want to take time to dive into any specific questions you guys have
101.48s: from any of the preceding sessions.
104.40s: That's the first thing.
105.60s: The second thing I want to look at a couple of questions that I've received previously,
111.96s: really two of them talked about the same exact thing and about five of them were about
117.56s: the same topic, which is this of defending positions.
122.20s: So we'll talk about defending positions.
125.24s: And then the last thing that I wanted to specifically cover today is looking at some trade
131.40s: examples.
132.56s: And I went back and forth on how I wanted to do that.
135.28s: I have a playlist on my YouTube channel about trade management, which is this one right
141.88s: here.
143.44s: So you can literally go through this playlist.
146.56s: You can find different strategies that I've used at different points and how I've managed
150.84s: different trades.
152.80s: There's also a couple other playlists that talk about management of individual style structures.
159.92s: So that's what this playlist is.
161.96s: What I'm highlighting is not to plug my own playlist.
164.48s: You guys are already on the channel.
166.64s: So plug in my own shit doesn't matter.
168.64s: It's mostly because I don't want to spend a bunch of time looking at positions that I've
173.60s: had in armchair quarterbacking them.
176.72s: So I thought what might be more interesting for that section is to take a look at either
182.86s: trades that you guys have looked at yourselves or trades that you have on.
187.16s: And the reason why I think that could be interesting is because it gives us an opportunity
190.60s: to look at something novel, right?
192.92s: Something that I can't already speak all the way through because I know that's happened
197.04s: because it's my own position.
198.96s: The other thing I thought we could do is go back into on demand, which we've tinkered
204.32s: with before.
206.44s: And in on demand, we have the ability to go back in time and to trade different perspective
212.04s: positions.
213.04s: And then the third thing I wanted to cover with respect to this options trading kind of
219.52s: position section is to talk about a couple positions that I have on now that are in progress.
228.92s: And the reason I want to talk about in progress positions is because I don't know what's
233.76s: going to happen with them.
235.72s: And me not knowing what's going to happen with them is an important part of the discussion
240.60s: cycle about placing trades.
242.84s: Now the downside is there trades that I already have on, but I don't know what I'm going
249.20s: to do with them yet because I'm still figuring it out.
251.80s: So we have a bunch of different angles.
254.12s: We can approach that portion of this session, which we'll be looking at trades and actually
259.92s: to make sure that I keep us on track, I'm going to pop open a notepad real quick and
267.40s: jot down a few notes on how we're going to flow so that I keep us on track.
273.28s: So in the meantime, while I'm doing this, if you guys have relatively new positions
278.88s: or if you guys have, I'm sorry, if you guys have any specific questions that we want
283.60s: to start with taking a look at, I would love to start there.
286.64s: So we'll run through our Q&A.
289.20s: And then obviously the Q&A throughout the entire session, whatever there's something
292.40s: we're talking about that you want to learn more about, you just tell me.
295.24s: But if there's any specific topics that you guys want to start with, this is a great point
301.04s: to do that.
303.20s: Then we'll get into defending positions, which we'll need a couple ideas for that in terms
307.68s: of positions.
308.68s: We'll couple that I recently managed that I think will fit that bill pretty well.
313.84s: And then after that, we'll get into some trade examples.
320.08s: So that's what I got for us.
321.32s: For however long this goes, they've been typically about an hour and change.
324.76s: I think one of them is almost two hours.
326.92s: So all right.
332.72s: Timmy Peparoni, that is a hilarious name.
338.44s: Timmy Peparoni says, New here, just start off trading options a few weeks ago, feeling
342.08s: slightly overwhelmed.
343.08s: That sounds about right.
344.08s: I have, let me grab something for you specifically quickly.
348.28s: There's, I made a guide for people literally for this exact reason.
353.92s: And it's not, it's honestly not finished yet.
356.56s: I've told you guys this before.
358.52s: It's definitely work in progress, but it's something that I'm trying to use to like build
365.48s: out for you guys.
366.72s: So specifically for you, Mr. Peparoni, you can check out that Google sheet that I just
372.76s: shared.
373.76s: And that tries to add some structure around this to make it a little less overwhelming.
378.96s: So what this will look like is this document here on, that's hilarious.
385.60s: There's an anonymous bat.
387.32s: Love that.
388.32s: Hedgehog.
389.32s: Yo, these are cool animals.
390.56s: Okay.
391.56s: So the dinosaur is idle.
392.80s: There's a chipmunk.
393.88s: I like this bat.
394.88s: That's my favorite so far.
397.24s: And so anyways, you'll see that I kind of organize it into a couple primary clusters.
401.92s: That's what's noted in this section over here.
404.44s: These are just broad overarching topics that I think apply.
409.56s: Then I list primary learning objectives for each of them so that I think these are
415.08s: some of the more important components to take away from these.
418.76s: Click admin note.
419.76s: There's way more to trading than this.
421.96s: My goal, however, is not to add so much information to grossly overwhelm people.
428.68s: The reason for that is because there's no shortage of information available at this point.
434.44s: It's different than when I started.
435.80s: When I started trading, you were very much limited by the data you could find about options
440.08s: because there wasn't that much of it.
442.56s: Now it's the opposite.
443.88s: There's a million things that you can find and you don't necessarily know which one's
447.68s: good and which one's not.
449.32s: So what I'm trying to do is keep this comprehensive enough to focus on the important things but not
457.80s: exhaustive so that if somebody opens this their eyes roll into the back of their heads
462.00s: and then they're overwhelmed.
463.48s: I add that caveat because this is not everything that goes into this.
467.12s: These are just some of the really big blocks that are here.
471.32s: On here, I offer some books that I would go through and order.
475.44s: I highlighted five of them that I think really, really makes sense to take a look at depending
482.48s: on your perspective and what you're trying to do.
484.92s: Then down here, I listed just some general steps, what I would be focusing on in order.
490.92s: I offer an outline of what I do and now I realize that this is not lined up with that.
496.72s: My OCD is just overwhelming.
500.60s: So we have to move away from that.
502.60s: And then on this page, the outlier options trading syllabus, the point of this page
509.24s: is to tie resources to each of these components.
515.80s: And what I mean by that is the resources I'm looking to share again are not necessarily
522.28s: comprehensive.
524.12s: These are definitely way more designed to be general to hit the high points as I think
532.08s: they make sense and then to give you a launch pad.
537.88s: And specifically for the folks that are in the pros side of the Patreon, I offer kind
542.84s: of the ability to get a fact check, so to speak, on what you're learning and how that's
548.04s: going.
549.52s: But for everybody else, you don't need that, right?
552.44s: You can essentially look at the stuff I'm showing you, do it on the for free schedule
558.40s: and then get the vast majority of the benefit from it.
561.88s: So that's what this doc is and this is how to use it, essentially.
566.76s: Okay.
567.76s: Got to get caught up on the chat real quick.
571.64s: We got Roaring Titty.
572.64s: I always love to see that name, Big Ace.
574.88s: Coffee donuts and Homer.
575.88s: Do you get a chance to look at costs?
578.08s: Yeah, I looked at costs and it's anomalous.
584.56s: Now as you point out, it doesn't have options.
586.40s: I don't want to get super far down that rabbit hole because I'm really trying to keep these
589.16s: more about like learning options.
591.68s: But I'll take a look at that towards the end of this session if we have time.
595.24s: If we don't, that's totally okay.
598.56s: I think that we can also look at it Monday or we can go as deep into that stuff as we want.
605.24s: Rootabaga says, I don't even know what defending position means.
607.76s: That's a great question.
608.76s: It's actually a giant misnomer in my opinion.
613.32s: I think it's when traders are so scared of booking a losing trade that they have to call
618.36s: it something else to make themselves feel okay.
622.20s: So rather than saying, I took a losing trade down and I'm putting on a new trade or something
627.16s: like that or I'm adjusting a position we call it defending.
630.96s: But there's nothing inherently wrong with defending a position.
633.88s: The concept of defending a position is when you have something that's on and it's not
637.80s: going your way.
639.20s: You can do things in options like adjusting around the position and that's actually very cool
646.60s: about options.
647.60s: It's a unique thing that they offer.
648.92s: I don't love again calling it defending.
652.68s: I prefer to call it adjusting, but that's just semantics.
656.36s: So the main thing I draw the delineation there though is to try to avoid the emotional
661.88s: depth that goes into defending versus adjusting.
666.68s: It is pedantic as that might sound.
669.00s: There's a big difference between the psychology behind those two maneuvers.
673.08s: So I draw the distinction between them for that reason.
678.76s: Okay.
682.36s: Back up here.
683.36s: Elon Song says managing a trade synthetic long, CLSK, Jan 17th, 25, 75 calls.
694.52s: I sold out of the cash, I sold out of the cash secure put leg in order to free up cash
702.28s: waiting for 19 to 24 top to sell these.
706.28s: Okay.
707.76s: So first off, Elon Song's, I would absolutely remind you that synthetic stock, synthetic
717.28s: long is kind of a specific thing.
721.12s: So it looks like what you have is a long call.
723.72s: And again, this isn't to get overly pedantic, but this is we're talking about the fundamentals
728.76s: of trading, which is absolutely important to differentiate.
735.04s: So if I grab CLSK and we look at your example and we look at the 17 Jan 25 here, we go to
749.64s: the 7.5 calls and we analyze this trade a couple things.
757.08s: This is actually not synthetic stock because of this just to be very clear.
764.72s: If this was a synthetic stock position, we would have some sort of short put component added
774.64s: to it.
775.96s: Now this is synthetic stock just to be clear.
779.20s: And again, I'm not, I'm really not trying to like point this out to be pedantic.
783.36s: I'm trying to point out to make sure that we're being accurate because I know a lot of
786.80s: people that consume tasty content, which again, I love Tom Big fan, but I think it can
793.48s: muddy the waters when we use the term synthetics in places where it actually doesn't make sense.
800.96s: Elon Song says I already had, I originally had that short put.
805.52s: Now I just have the long call.
806.52s: Yep.
807.52s: Okay.
808.52s: So point though, exactly to your point that your position absolutely started as a synthetic,
816.52s: is synthetic shares.
818.32s: But then now it represents a long call is all and that's okay.
822.44s: The again, the only reason why I'm drawing the distinction, especially because clearly
826.24s: as you're talking about it, you know that difference.
828.96s: I'm drawing the distinction for other people that might not know the difference because
832.52s: as you guys may or may not know in the trading space, we use a lot of terms in different
837.32s: ways.
838.32s: And there's a lot of colloquial uses and then there's a lot of kind of like super accurate
845.44s: uses by definition of sorts.
847.60s: So I'm just making sure that that's clear for folks.
850.16s: So this is synthetic long down here.
852.48s: Now our position is long calls.
855.32s: So going back up though to your question, waiting for 19 to 24 to sell these.
862.00s: Let's see.
864.16s: I think that's so we're talking about managing long calls to be very clear about kind of this
869.40s: section here.
871.08s: And the first thing that I would do is see what I think about the underlying because I
875.80s: think there's nothing wrong if your target is something between 19 and 24.
880.60s: That's okay.
881.60s: And it looks like it's generally oscillating in that direction pretty slowly, but it's
885.40s: also important to remember that there is an opportunity cost to capital and you kind
891.84s: of need this thing to do what you want it to do.
895.00s: And just because we want it to go there doesn't mean it's going to go there.
899.36s: So the next question I would have for you, Elon songs, is if it doesn't go there, what
905.56s: is your management approach?
908.04s: So let's say for example, as I'm just kind of eyeballing this, let's say for example,
914.92s: it starts to go down to whatever degree that makes sense for us.
920.72s: But what's the move there if it starts going down?
930.00s: Elon song says what I'm confused about is how quickly Theta or valuable melt versus selling
934.16s: it.
935.16s: That's a great question.
937.44s: And then Elon song says what that's what I don't have clear if it goes below 15 all
942.12s: close.
943.12s: Yes, literally perfect.
944.48s: So the very first thing I would offer to you is whenever we place a trade literally
949.36s: every single time we need to have profit and loss defined before entry that before entry
956.16s: component is so important.
960.76s: It's because it is one we are the most objective we can possibly be as a trader is at that point
967.68s: before the trade is on before the risk is on before any emotion before any hopes dreams
974.60s: enter the equation before all of that in my opinion is just it's a non-negotiable.
981.80s: I have this corny little saying that I use that I actually believe in though to a pretty
986.36s: significant degree, which is in trading, there's so much bullshit right people will say,
993.48s: well use this one indicator and make a good $1 trillion or all you have to do is trade
997.96s: for five minutes a day and make $5,000 a day.
1001.04s: Like it's all bullshit.
1002.96s: But there's one thing that's legitimate and there's one thing you can do that will
1008.40s: legitimately transform your trading and that is defining your profit and loss before
1013.80s: you enter a trade.
1015.28s: Because if you do that and you track it and you will be able to observe trends that can
1020.76s: then feed your system to then optimize the system.
1025.60s: So the very first thing is to do that.
1028.76s: Now that that points aside, let's answer your specific question though about how quickly
1034.52s: theta will impact the position and then just in case you guys didn't know YouTube wants
1039.08s: me to insert an ad now it says now's a good time.
1043.04s: What you guys already know the answer to that the answer is we hit close and I finally
1048.24s: have learned how to not let YouTube do this.
1052.40s: So there's another thing that it pops up that says focus on your live stream and let
1056.84s: YouTube insert ads for you.
1058.84s: I'm pretty sure that like YouTube hates me because I actively turn off all of these ads.
1065.52s: It's kind of actually hilarious.
1067.96s: So I don't want to disrupt you guys with it, but I find the pop ups are hilarious.
1074.40s: So let's talk about exactly that.
1076.72s: And for anybody in the chat that knows can you walk me through how we can answer Elon
1081.16s: Song's question specifically about how quickly the theta or value will melt versus selling
1088.80s: it, which is a great question.
1091.32s: How can we do that?
1096.92s: There's a few things that we can easily do.
1101.28s: The first one is navigate to our options chain, get rid of this.
1106.44s: So what can we do in here?
1109.96s: So that means that it's actually quite, quite spelled out for you.
1119.20s: You go right here, you go to the option chain and you look at theta.
1124.68s: That right there tells you exactly the answer to that question.
1128.92s: So that means ceteris parabis, everything else remaining the same as a day passes, you
1136.24s: will lose a penny on your options.
1139.40s: Now again, it's not a penny, right?
1141.80s: It's a dollar because you got to, it's per share.
1144.00s: You have to multiply it out by a hundred.
1146.44s: That's what it decays on a daily basis, everything else remaining the same, a buck.
1153.28s: So this is essentially the cost of leverage for you.
1159.64s: That's what this is showing you.
1160.64s: Rudeabag has a great question.
1162.00s: Does theta change over time?
1163.48s: Fantastic question.
1165.16s: And I actually preemptively expected these questions, one like that, and I grabbed this.
1175.20s: Here.
1180.68s: So this is theta decay in the top right.
1183.68s: So to answer Rudeabag's question, does theta decay change over time?
1191.12s: Absolutely.
1192.28s: And this is exactly how.
1194.40s: So as you get closer and closer into time, your theta decay, theta decay will accelerate.
1200.84s: And we can look at an example.
1203.40s: One of the things that you'll hear me talk about when I'm analyzing options chains is this
1207.60s: concept of surrogate options.
1211.12s: And I actually don't know if that's proper at all to use.
1213.28s: I've used it my whole life, but it's exactly what I do is I use different options to simulate
1220.80s: different scenarios in my brain.
1223.72s: Now as special as that might sound, let's take a look at these seven and a halfs and
1229.76s: let's pretend that we hold those seven and a halfs until the equivalent of the 20 December
1237.40s: expiration cycle.
1239.24s: So what that means is I would simply pretend that time has passed.
1244.12s: And rather than our options having 190 60 to E, this 17 Jan expiration cycle will now look
1251.28s: like this 20 December, meaning rather than having 190 60 to E, where our 17 Jan's now have
1258.68s: 160 80 to E. So I'm going to look at this one.
1261.20s: And then I'm going to see if there's seven and a halfs and there's not, which is kind
1264.84s: of annoying, but it doesn't really matter because I can also just take a look between the
1269.92s: difference between seven and eight to get a sense.
1272.88s: So what I'm looking at is where does my theta go in this scenario?
1277.72s: What happens to theta if essentially this time frame passes a little over 20 days or
1284.72s: whatever?
1286.88s: And we can see theta if we wait for 20 days is still essentially a penny a day, dollar
1294.04s: a day in total.
1296.88s: So you can do this to get an idea of what your position might look like as time passes.
1304.44s: Now there's not always perfect, right?
1306.20s: Like your seven and a halfs are not in here.
1308.24s: So you can't do that to the same degree in here.
1311.56s: So this is one way.
1314.12s: Another way to look at this is to go into some sort of risk profile tool.
1320.24s: You can either make your own.
1321.40s: It's very simple to do genuinely in Excel.
1323.76s: It's not difficult to model all of the different Greeks for an option given a certain amount
1327.80s: of information.
1330.28s: You can eyeball what the total theta of a position could be or you can just fast forward time.
1338.64s: So you can say right now we're looking at the 5th of July if we go fast forward two days.
1345.60s: You can see this line is moving.
1347.76s: It's just not moving very much because the theta is so low.
1351.20s: So if I zoom this in really, really far, that's what I'm doing by kind of this annoying
1354.52s: dragging process.
1356.04s: I'm zooming us in almost to a microscopic level.
1358.04s: I just want you to be able to see this line move as I click the days.
1361.96s: So this is the 5th of July.
1364.52s: Now watch as I fast forward time.
1366.84s: Watch that purple line.
1369.60s: Notice how it moves.
1370.84s: I just fast forwarded us 20 days.
1373.92s: That's how much it moved over the course of that 20 days.
1377.44s: So this is another way that you can see how much your theta will decay or the options
1384.08s: will premium will decay due to theta.
1387.96s: So that's the kind of two easy ways to do this.
1391.28s: And that's essentially what I would do.
1392.92s: If I wanted to know how much theta am I giving away or getting chewed up by this is exactly
1400.48s: what I would do.
1401.48s: I would just go into the option chain and I would look.
1403.00s: I would say, okay, I have the 7.5.
1405.12s: There are 91 delta.
1406.12s: I know something that's really deep in the money is going to have less extrinsic value.
1409.28s: It's going to decay less quickly.
1411.04s: I'll take a look at the theta specifically.
1413.12s: This is a penny a day.
1415.08s: And you can even get this out down to a third decimal place if you want in something like
1418.68s: thinkorswim so that you can see like more precisely what it is.
1422.40s: But I would look at that and say that's simply not much.
1425.52s: That's the cost of my leverage.
1427.08s: So that is the overall process I would follow.
1432.60s: And Elon songs if you have any follow-ons to that.
1435.08s: Let me know.
1436.56s: All right.
1437.56s: Get back through.
1439.56s: I just got to get caught up.
1444.84s: Zach says, is there a free website you'd recommend for options?
1447.32s: I have fidelity but can't see where they have delta gamma listed.
1452.32s: I was the taint on it only looked at cost basis my first couple of times.
1457.16s: When you say for option Zach, do you mean for trading options?
1461.00s: If so, most brokerages have like decent platforms.
1464.36s: If you want to analyze options, chains like thinkorswim here is what I use.
1467.88s: But you can use a bunch of other stuff.
1469.40s: IB interactive brokers has their platform.
1472.56s: Fidelity has their own platform.
1473.88s: I'm pretty sure I think they even have one that you can download if I'm not mistaken
1477.36s: because I had some capital with them at some point.
1479.96s: They have like their thing like fidelity pro, which is their own little trader platform
1483.76s: like this.
1485.00s: So that's what I would do.
1486.84s: Oh, it looks like growing titty.
1488.60s: You already got you.
1489.60s: You probably need to go into the settings.
1490.64s: Actually, trade of pro and customize your window.
1492.60s: Yep, exactly right.
1493.60s: It's perfect.
1494.60s: Anthony says high friends.
1497.44s: What's up Anthony?
1498.44s: God says smooth brain question.
1501.04s: When I'm seeing the bid and ask is the ask the seller and the bid the buyer or is there
1505.60s: a different way to look at it?
1506.60s: That's exactly right.
1507.60s: The only difference I would offer you when you look at the bid and the ask is more often
1511.64s: not.
1512.64s: It's actually the same person.
1513.64s: It's a market maker that's resting orders.
1515.96s: And they're essentially saying what they're willing to transact at.
1519.20s: That's what this is.
1520.52s: Now you can even go a step further if you're so inclined and you can add up here, another
1525.80s: tab would be the size.
1528.16s: And you can see what market they're specifically offering.
1532.24s: I'll see if I can add it without like completely crushing how deep this is already.
1542.88s: So there's the size.
1544.52s: It's kind of difficult to see.
1547.68s: And it doesn't look like this lets me expand the window.
1549.68s: That's slightly annoying.
1550.68s: Maybe if I hover on it.
1551.68s: Perfect.
1552.68s: So in this case for Elon songs position actually, if we look at it right now, it's bid
1557.48s: at 950 offered at 980.
1559.36s: The difference between these is the bid asked spread.
1562.76s: And this is predicated on the market maker and what they're willing to offer you.
1566.52s: Right now they're willing to offer 501 at the 950 for 91 at the 980.
1572.80s: Why is that?
1573.80s: Why would they have a difference?
1574.80s: It's because they might have a different perception of risk or depending on how the
1580.12s: rest of their book looks like, they might want to take a different profile.
1586.00s: These are not in the context when a market maker is offering you a position.
1589.60s: It's not in the context of this one individual strike.
1593.48s: They are looking at it from the perspective of their entire book.
1596.96s: What makes sense based on my entire portfolio of shit and what I'm trying to do with their
1602.76s: risk?
1603.76s: That is what a market maker is most concerned with is managing their risk effectively so
1608.12s: that they can capture their primary profit mechanism, which is the bid asked spread.
1613.12s: So that's why you'll see different numbers here.
1615.28s: You'll see these numbers move.
1617.20s: They can spoof orders.
1618.52s: That's more for high frequency trading.
1619.88s: I'm kind of bastardizing the term for this.
1622.36s: But essentially they can flash orders that don't actually represent what they want to trade
1626.92s: at.
1627.92s: They can flash orders that are worse than they want to trade at that they would improve
1632.08s: if an order comes in at to not divulge what they're calculating IV for.
1637.08s: For example, if they know that they're competing with other makers in that space, that goes
1641.12s: down obviously a very specific ribo hole that we do not need to go crazy, crazy into.
1647.68s: But just general context there.
1650.48s: So when you're looking at the bid asked spread, that is the way you're looking at it is
1654.24s: exactly correct.
1655.72s: The bid is what you could sell something at right now.
1660.08s: The offer or the ask is what you can buy something at right now.
1664.64s: Now, most traders, especially on the retail side because we tend to trade in much smaller
1669.40s: size on a relative basis, you should always target the mid first or even something that's
1675.12s: slightly advantageous to you.
1677.32s: So what that means is let's say that like Elon songs, I want to buy this option.
1683.28s: Well, I know I could buy it at 980.
1686.12s: I want to pay 980.
1687.84s: I want to I know that they're building themselves a big buffer here.
1691.28s: So I'm going to be a cheap bastard.
1693.12s: And maybe I'll come in at like 955 or 960.
1697.72s: Maybe if you getting a fill there is unnecessarily great.
1700.44s: But I also have literally nothing to lose by not giving them exactly what they want to start
1706.44s: and working actually closer from the bid over to the offer.
1710.52s: What's the trade off here?
1711.52s: Well, I'm sacrificing speed of fill.
1715.56s: I'm letting my order be known by the market.
1718.84s: So then they could slowly ratchet the price up if they want.
1722.44s: They can adjust their market as I'm adjusting my order.
1725.76s: So that's the perspective downside.
1729.56s: But in general markets are pretty competitive.
1731.96s: So you're not necessarily going to give up a whole lot.
1734.88s: The main thing that you're giving up there is speed of execution.
1739.00s: And if you're not in a giant rush, that's okay.
1741.44s: You can give up a little bit of speed.
1743.72s: So let me know if that answers your question.
1752.24s: The warranty he says are these lessons you're doing for Patreon?
1754.48s: No, no, no, no.
1755.76s: So from that document that I was showing you guys, that's literally they're open for
1760.92s: everybody.
1762.24s: The purpose of that document is to give you guys an outline for things.
1766.36s: I'm just grabbing it back up because I think I accidentally closed it.
1770.28s: Yeah.
1771.28s: So the whole purpose of this document is not to give it to anybody or anything.
1776.72s: This is to give you something to work through like a little bit of structure.
1780.76s: And then these are just videos that are available for everybody.
1784.00s: The part that I offer the Patreon folks is as they finish a module, there's a spot
1789.00s: you can drop in and say, hey, I just finished module one.
1793.76s: And as soon as I see that, I pop in there and essentially I quiz you.
1797.28s: I asked some questions about the content in this to then attempt to try and help the
1804.92s: detail sink in more deeply to make sure that there's kind of a practical understanding
1809.44s: of the key points in there.
1811.44s: But the videos and stuff in there, that's for everybody.
1816.48s: Joseph says, just want to tell you that they have a lot of respect, have an amazing work
1821.96s: ethic, provide a lot of information, take and submit.
1824.20s: Yeah, absolutely.
1825.20s: That's awesome.
1826.20s: I'm stoked to hear that.
1828.20s: Lauren, a kid, what up, Lauren, a kid?
1830.36s: So yes, bid is the buyer and you can get filled there, but very unlikely because ask
1836.16s: is what they want and it's higher than a bid.
1840.68s: You can buy in the spread as well between the two, but it's a medium fill chance.
1846.92s: Yeah, I think that's a fair way to put it.
1848.76s: Like, the chance of getting filled between the bid asked spread is actually very high.
1853.04s: You do not need to go to the extremes.
1854.96s: That's the only time you would go to the extremes, meaning transact at the bidder offer is if
1859.72s: you need to trade right now.
1861.20s: It's like submitting a market order.
1862.76s: I need something right now.
1864.56s: But if you take any time to play the bid asked spread, you'll overwhelmingly number of
1869.84s: cases get a fill somewhere in there.
1872.28s: So maybe you don't get exactly at the mid, but maybe you get something a little towards
1877.24s: the offer, but not the offer itself.
1879.40s: Like that, that'll happen literally all the time.
1883.72s: Tampa Bay Buck I says, Hey, Eric, what's your opinion on flowing Siri?
1888.80s: We can take a look at that.
1890.08s: I looked at that not too long ago.
1891.48s: And I want to keep these more kind of educational concepts.
1895.68s: So if there's time at the end of the video, remind me and happy to take a look at it.
1900.28s: If not, we can dive into that way more deeply on the Monday live session.
1904.76s: Happy to do that.
1907.48s: Peyton says, can you explain how somebody in 1123 correctly predicted the stocks recent
1914.10s: movements based off of some log view of the chart?
1918.44s: I don't understand your question at all.
1923.56s: It's yeah, Peyton, could you clarify your question a bit because that one does not make sense
1928.64s: to me.
1930.40s: It sounds like you're talking about somebody back in November of 23 predicting a stock
1935.06s: movement that recently happened.
1937.56s: And if that's the question, I can absolutely work through that with you.
1941.48s: But the answer's probably going to disenfranchise you.
1945.08s: Tampa Bay says Eric love the tax and profile, US and R and some for five brother.
1952.80s: Well, cost Ali, can you please show me to place a limit order in toss?
1956.40s: Sure.
1957.40s: Really, if you want to place a limit order for shares, it's just down here limit.
1962.36s: And that's it.
1963.36s: There's your limit order.
1964.52s: If you want to do it for options, it's the same exact thing.
1966.72s: So by this limit order and then input the price that you want to limit at right there.
1972.88s: Ruta, Vegas says does theta change over time?
1982.00s: It does.
1983.00s: So theta as we were kind of talking about.
1985.24s: So if we look at the surrogate option scenario, if we go way out here to 560 days in this
1990.96s: and we look at 91 delta option, the theta is literally so low you need to go to a third
1996.20s: or fourth decimal place to even see it.
1999.00s: So then if we come in here to 18 July and you go to that same 91 delta, you can see
2003.76s: it's the same scenario.
2004.92s: It's so far out of the money you need a third decimal place.
2007.72s: Then if we come in here to 17 Jan, now it's out of penny, you can see it.
2011.88s: Then if we fast forward to 42 days, you'll see now it's at two pennies.
2015.76s: And then if we come in here to 14 days to that same 91 delta, which is somewhere probably
2022.24s: around here, it's four pennies or so.
2026.56s: And the reason why it gets lighter is you go further in the money because there's less
2030.32s: extrinsic value to even have theta to K. There's so far in the money.
2035.04s: So yeah, theta definitely changes over time.
2040.00s: Ruta, Vegas says so basically theta is a function of time and has nothing to do with the stock
2045.32s: movement.
2047.00s: Not necessarily.
2050.04s: Because theta is a function, theta measures in options decay due to the passage of time.
2059.48s: But theta applies to the extrinsic value of an option, which is dependent on the stock
2067.72s: movement.
2068.96s: So that's the tricky part.
2070.56s: When you talk about options in general, is that there's a lot of correlations between
2075.72s: things.
2076.72s: You talk about individual concepts in a vacuum because it's easier to understand them if other
2082.60s: things aren't changing.
2083.80s: But yeah, so theta in a vacuum simply measures the passage of time and the impact that
2090.28s: has on the premium of an option.
2092.16s: That's absolutely correct.
2093.68s: In a practical sense, theta applies to extrinsic value, which cares tremendously about the movement
2099.24s: of the underlying.
2100.36s: So I wouldn't decouple them mentally is all I'm trying to explain there.
2107.72s: Joseph Apex writes as what platform this is think or swim.
2114.64s: Joseph says so when Roryne Kitty made those crazy gains on his options, people said he
2118.68s: didn't have enough money for them.
2121.04s: This has me confused.
2122.12s: If you make gains on options, you have to have money to buy them.
2126.16s: No, you absolutely don't.
2127.96s: Yeah, you don't have to worry about that at all.
2130.64s: So what they're what those people are referring to is the ability to take assignment.
2135.24s: So let's say for example, using this same ticker since we've been on it for a hot minute
2139.88s: and why not.
2142.16s: Let's say that Elon Songs has a one lot at seven and a half.
2148.04s: Well, in order to put this position on, she's using $965.
2153.72s: That's all it takes to buy this option.
2155.72s: However, she has access to a different size position.
2163.32s: So when you're looking at two, there's two different scenarios.
2167.24s: You have whatever the cash secured amount is for an option.
2172.32s: And then you have whatever the option is trading for.
2177.48s: Now this is an anomalous trade.
2180.64s: And the reason why this is anomalous is because there's more intrinsic value baked into
2186.04s: these options than is actually here.
2189.80s: And that happens in really extreme cases.
2192.20s: And I don't want to get too too stuck on that point.
2195.52s: So let me use something a little more appropriate to at least share that specific point.
2200.56s: I'm going to use something that's cheaper so that it doesn't have as many spots, meaning
2204.80s: decimal places so it's less congested.
2207.56s: Why the freak disease have super weird options?
2210.32s: That's annoying.
2211.32s: That's counting for like a special dividend.
2212.76s: I'm trying to find like a simple example to give you guys and everything I'm opening
2215.76s: up has diamonds.
2219.24s: This also has adjustments for different special dividends.
2222.36s: What the hell?
2223.36s: I need like a simple ticker that doesn't have a bunch of man.
2228.68s: What let's use X okay, let's get into sector's yet.
2233.08s: This $200 that's too much money.
2235.36s: Let's use XLF.
2236.36s: This should be cheaper.
2237.36s: Here we go.
2238.36s: All right.
2239.36s: We're on to something.
2240.76s: This is great.
2242.44s: Okay, this is great.
2244.48s: So now that we can finally give you guys an example, even though this is super illiquid,
2251.40s: let's not pretend we're going to transact here because I'll be a terrible idea.
2254.80s: But let's go along with this example.
2257.44s: If you buy this option and you get it at the mid, you're paying $520.
2261.76s: It gives you access to $3,700 of shares, right?
2267.12s: Because this is per share.
2269.20s: Now when you buy an option, you don't have to have the $3,700 to take this position.
2275.52s: That's the leverage gained by options.
2278.12s: Now what you could not do unless you have enough margin space in your portfolio, but let's
2285.28s: just pretend you didn't.
2286.92s: You could not exercise your calls and then take on the shares because you would not have
2294.92s: enough capital.
2296.16s: Again, you could do it if you could onboard via margin, which is again, a slightly other
2300.44s: nuance conversation.
2302.04s: But that's what you were hearing when people were saying that his position was too big
2306.68s: essentially.
2307.68s: And it was.
2308.68s: I did the math in a couple videos on his position because it was just really, really
2312.96s: interesting to me.
2314.76s: And I think what was it like $120 million or it's so ridiculous to me that I'm talking
2323.68s: about a dude that goes by named roaring kitty.
2328.44s: And I'm talking about over $100 million position.
2331.92s: It's so crazy.
2335.12s: But yeah, I think that that's about what it was.
2338.00s: Oh no, it was more than that.
2339.96s: It was like $240 million or some shit.
2343.28s: And he only paid like $68 million for his options or something like that.
2347.16s: Again, as you could tell, I don't fully remember.
2351.36s: That's the point is that he didn't have enough capital in the account to take on the
2355.48s: whole position that we know without definitely or that what we know with certainty.
2361.80s: All right, let me know if that answers your question.
2368.04s: Peter says, what are the modules that's back on this?
2374.12s: The modules are just groupings of lessons essentially.
2377.24s: So like module one looks at basics of investing, investing 101 module two talks about like market
2382.78s: structure module three looks at like behavior of traders and tendencies.
2387.96s: So the modules just break down the topics into sub topics is all it makes it I try to organize
2394.60s: it a little bit is all.
2398.60s: Ian says, do you trade P and for those that don't know what P is, that's not what you and
2403.12s: your significant other do on the weekend to each other.
2406.00s: This is post earnings announcement drift.
2409.84s: And yes, I do trade P for sure.
2413.36s: Absolutely.
2415.56s: Is it a part of earning specific allocation or what does it sit similar question for long
2419.48s: straddles 10 days before earnings announcement?
2421.48s: Yeah, great questions.
2423.16s: So P is definitely part of a drift momentum play for me.
2431.08s: It is absolutely after the fact.
2435.40s: And when I look at post earnings announcement drift, the whole idea there is to try to capitalize
2442.12s: on the continuation of a move.
2444.68s: And there's actually a lot of ways you can search and scan for post earnings announcement
2448.48s: drift, but a really easy example is something like Nvidia.
2452.96s: So Nvidia had big massive gap up for earnings.
2459.28s: It also had a significant beat on expectations.
2462.44s: It came in at 6.12 versus 5143 expected.
2465.52s: There's very specific criteria that go into post earnings announcement drift.
2469.96s: So this ticked some of those boxes.
2472.68s: And then the hypothesis is over the following quarter, you tend to see out performance given
2477.52s: those conditions.
2478.88s: So yeah, and you can also trade post earnings announcement drift to the downside.
2483.36s: It's not always positive.
2484.36s: A lot of times I'll refer to it as positive earnings announcement drift because that's
2487.36s: kind of the lens I typically trade it through to the upside, but you can trade post earnings
2491.88s: announcement drift to the downside.
2493.72s: But there's specific criteria that have to be met that tie to gap of the position, meaning
2500.28s: gap on the release.
2502.16s: And then the level of beat that ensues or miss to the downside, that's what needs to be
2509.08s: in place here.
2510.24s: There also needs to be some other criteria that have changed a lot over time, which is
2515.96s: how efficacious it is given the size of the product.
2523.24s: So let me grab this for you guys.
2526.44s: You guys can grab this off of SSRN.
2530.44s: I'll grab the zoom out here for you.
2535.32s: So this is one of the very many studies that I will cite and talk to you guys about.
2541.92s: And this is where you can get a lot of good basis information on post earnings announcement
2548.56s: drift.
2555.76s: And it quantifies it.
2557.80s: It shows different effects, but here's the punch line.
2563.36s: So you essentially can see about an abnormal return.
2566.60s: That means access.
2567.96s: This is alpha of over 9%.
2571.56s: This changes over time.
2572.56s: It's not like you just do this and get 9% per quarter, but it's not that far off.
2578.28s: Post earnings announcement drift is a big part of my book.
2580.88s: And that's very, very purposeful.
2583.44s: Crypteta, what's up, man?
2585.00s: Thank you so much.
2586.00s: I literally am just about to order dinner.
2588.00s: I actually think we're going to do Buffalo Wild Wings again.
2591.24s: I think I've been on like a boneless wing kick.
2594.00s: I went through a really strict diet period for a while.
2597.64s: So I think my body is just craving trash and carbs right now.
2602.52s: So I am very thankful.
2605.16s: Thank you very much.
2606.72s: My B-Dubs will be even more delicious.
2610.52s: Thank you.
2612.88s: Back up to the questions.
2614.24s: Joseph says, what does it mean to exercise them?
2615.92s: Is that the only way?
2616.92s: No, it's not the only way.
2617.92s: It's actually a suboptimal way to transact there.
2622.28s: I should have, let me see, this should be from the OIC.
2630.56s: Let me one sec.
2632.40s: I think I have a screenshot somewhere from the OIC on this exact topic, but I want to make
2638.48s: sure about the settlement of options.
2641.08s: Here we go.
2648.08s: And now I did.
2650.20s: Yo, I'm like a freaking encyclopedia.
2652.84s: Yo, look at me.
2653.68s: Go.
2654.44s: Got to shift for everything.
2656.48s: So this looks at the settlement of options.
2659.72s: And it says, you'll hear people mistakenly cite literally all the time.
2665.12s: Most options expire worthless.
2667.00s: This is why you should sell them, which is literally complete trash.
2670.44s: It's not accurate.
2671.84s: 72% of all option contracts are closed out prior to expiration.
2677.44s: So the overwhelming majority of options are traded.
2682.12s: This is the primary way that we close options positions.
2685.52s: It's just way more efficient.
2688.80s: There are 22% that expire worthless.
2692.28s: And then there are 6% that get exercised.
2696.12s: Exercise is generally an inefficient modality with options.
2701.28s: We overall want to avoid this.
2706.28s: So the vast majority of instances we want simply to trade the options.
2711.84s: There's a bunch of reasons why it doesn't make sense to exercise.
2716.72s: From the option buyer's perspective, you give up any residual extrinsic value.
2724.08s: So if we go back to Wells Fargo.
2733.72s: And let's say that you bought these 60, let's say you buy something that's in the money,
2740.92s: something that has intrinsic value.
2742.88s: Let's say that you have these 18 October, 55 calls.
2747.32s: And let's say that you bought them for whatever.
2749.68s: Something cheaper than what they are now.
2750.92s: Let's say you got them for $5.
2752.80s: And let's pretend Wells Fargo's gone up a bunch and you're making money.
2757.64s: So what you don't want to do unless you really want the shares is exercise your options early.
2765.08s: Why do I say that?
2766.08s: What can you find from this scenario?
2769.72s: Why would that be disadvantageous?
2771.80s: Other than the fact that perhaps you really want the shares.
2779.56s: And there are absolutely new on circumstances where it still can make sense.
2784.60s: But there's a specific reason why we don't want to do that here.
2789.88s: Any guesses?
2791.52s: Jay, you are becoming really well versed in options.
2798.00s: If I'm not mistaken, you're relatively new to this stuff.
2801.48s: And you're doing an incredible job so far.
2806.60s: It's exactly correct.
2808.52s: You give up the extrinsic value.
2810.68s: This is actually why going back to a GameStop example.
2813.76s: I don't think Warren Kitty exercised his options.
2818.56s: The reason why I don't think he exercises options is because he would have given up over
2823.16s: $3 million in extrinsic value that he could have recaptured by trading the options.
2829.28s: Now there's always competing interest.
2831.00s: You could say, well, I really don't want to deal with buying options.
2837.76s: If the market's going to move a lot, if there's low flow, I just want to exercise in this
2842.00s: case.
2843.60s: And that's okay.
2845.60s: You can do that.
2846.96s: But you are absolutely leaving money on the table when you make that choice.
2851.28s: So in that case, you would be sacrificing optimizing the profitability of the position for a convenience-based
2857.56s: reason.
2858.56s: Which again, that's okay.
2859.56s: You can do that.
2860.56s: But it is a noteworthy trade off to make.
2864.12s: So yeah, absolutely.
2865.96s: That was 100% correct.
2868.16s: We have to do a speed reload.
2870.64s: We now have watermelon, seltzer water, which is definitely my favorite.
2875.84s: This one has not been as good.
2877.08s: The blood orange tangerine, spin drift.
2880.76s: One I really like is like the mango orange one.
2882.88s: That's way more refreshing.
2884.04s: This one's not bad.
2887.32s: But I think it might be just because the oranges are small, the tangerines, I feel like
2890.92s: I just need a big orange.
2892.12s: Maybe they just taste better.
2893.12s: That could be it.
2897.40s: Back up top.
2904.40s: Joseph says, what does it mean to exercise that?
2906.88s: Okay.
2907.88s: So I think we answered that.
2908.88s: That one you can absolutely, you can trade the option.
2913.52s: And that's probably the better choice.
2916.12s: Abdullah says, any thoughts on AMD and Tesla?
2918.68s: I'm going to skip on those for this session.
2920.96s: Again, we can look at those on Monday.
2922.48s: I want to focus this way more on the fundamentals of trading.
2926.48s: Audi says, hey, I thought you would have said howdy, man.
2930.80s: I was wondering if you have a series on YouTube for options 101, extremely new to options.
2935.08s: Yeah, you know it.
2936.24s: They're literally, if you go back into this other document that I've shared with you guys.
2941.84s: And if you go to down here where it says options 101, there's literally a playlist, the
2946.56s: very first one.
2948.28s: And fun fact, this options like introduction video, the one that's pretty long, I have
2954.24s: a new one that I'm trying to launch next week.
2957.28s: Literally that I shot all the way straight through.
2959.80s: It's an hour and 40 freaking minutes that I just sat in my office talking to myself about
2965.84s: options.
2966.84s: It's crazy.
2967.84s: But I'm trying to turn that into like a really, really good staple video that I'm proud
2972.28s: to put in front of you guys.
2973.88s: The last one that I did, the last couple that I did, like they're okay, but they're not,
2980.84s: yeah, I mean, I'm not proud of them.
2983.64s: So Zach says, love it if you go over your GME option purchase from today.
2987.36s: I did not purchase any GME options today.
2989.88s: I've had a GME position for a little while now.
2994.04s: I got into.
2996.04s: I'll tell you one.
3000.28s: Well, it's loading.
3004.56s: I'm looking at thinkorswim on the web base platform.
3008.48s: Here we go.
3010.88s: And then you can't search.
3013.12s: Here we go.
3022.24s: And then I'll just show you on the chart.
3026.52s: I want like a three month something easier to see rid of all this stuff.
3030.96s: All right.
3032.68s: So we were in out.
3034.56s: I'm just trying to see where I got into the latest.
3039.52s: So it looks like we started scaling in right, right here and here.
3049.64s: These two spots.
3051.80s: So the 20th, the first, and then the second as well.
3058.16s: That's when this latest position's been on.
3060.36s: But I've told you guys before, Zach says my bad misunderstood video.
3064.64s: Yeah.
3065.64s: So the reason is is like when I'm doing stuff like this, I use an IRA account that has
3070.72s: no money or no positions in it so that it's not messed up by all my positions.
3075.36s: Because a lot of stuff that I have on, like it lights up like a Christmas tree and it
3079.80s: gets really noisy and especially when you're clicking into things.
3083.08s: So a lot of times when I'm making really any video, I use this, this account that I use
3087.44s: for passing through money to other things.
3090.32s: So that's why sometimes you'll see like the position thing there and sometimes not.
3095.28s: So plus the other thing is I just don't like the idea of people trying to like follow
3099.08s: what I'm doing.
3100.08s: I think that's the, it's like the antithesis of what I stand for.
3103.76s: My entire hope is to get people to a point where they're competent and comfortable enough
3109.00s: to make their own trading decisions.
3111.60s: So yeah, that's another at least consideration that I have when I think about it.
3117.08s: So yeah, all good.
3119.08s: All right, back up top to the next question.
3123.68s: So yes, how do you fn I do a series.
3126.56s: I shared that with you in the Excel document in the chat.
3130.76s: You can grab that.
3133.12s: Scott says why is slapping the ask considered more bullish or is it necessarily it's considered
3140.08s: bullish because it just means that you're trying to get in in a pressing amount of time
3144.68s: or you want to get in at size.
3147.24s: So you're not even trying to play the mid.
3149.12s: You're just immediately going in and you're playing the offer and you're scooping it up
3153.68s: for whatever they'll give it to you for.
3156.24s: So it's like the same thing if you're trying to liquidate a position and you go through
3160.56s: and start submitting a bunch of market orders, that typically is fairly telling.
3166.08s: The other thing is when you're analyzing options chains, whether we transact at the bitter
3170.52s: offer is just informative in terms of telling us where what what the disposition of a position
3175.40s: is.
3176.40s: Right.
3177.40s: If you watch the GME video today, I use that exact tool because you can't tell like
3183.08s: if I just go into this options chain and I look at the 24,519 calls here in GME at 25.
3191.08s: Now because it's GME and I can make some inferences, I have some ideas is to whether or not
3195.52s: these were bought or sold.
3196.80s: But let's just pretend it's a different product, a different name.
3198.80s: You can't tell if these 24,000 options were either bought to open or sold to open and
3205.80s: if based on that difference, you want something different to happen.
3209.04s: If you bought to open, you want them to go up.
3211.56s: If you sold to open for the option specifically, you want it to go down.
3215.96s: So using things like analyzing where options are transacting at helps us understand.
3222.48s: So for example, these 239,000 calls that transacted today in GameStop, they happened at the
3229.76s: bid or below.
3231.80s: You can't buy at the bid.
3234.76s: You can sell at the bid.
3237.36s: So this tells me that 37% of the volume today were people selling calls, which doesn't
3244.72s: surprise me.
3245.96s: Because if we take a look at the volume where it was happening today, take a look at how
3249.52s: much of it was in the five July expiration.
3252.80s: These are people exiting options left and right to try and unwind their position because
3258.88s: they're trying to salvage what value they can because it's the last day and most of
3263.16s: them are going to expire worthless.
3265.00s: So that's how you can kind of use that to understand what's happening with the transactions.
3273.80s: All right, back up to the top.
3279.60s: The chosen one, great name.
3281.68s: What is the most important factors you should know before committing to a long options
3285.16s: play like two, three months out?
3286.44s: I have a video for you.
3289.72s: And I actually made this video for specifically the GME folks, but it applies to anybody.
3296.04s: It's just about buying call options smarter.
3298.32s: I'm going to drop this in the chat for you, the chosen one.
3301.80s: That video will walk you through the exact process.
3305.16s: The reason why I'm giving you that video is because it's kind of a detailed answer.
3308.96s: So there's not like an important factor in my opinion.
3314.00s: It is, well, I guess, okay, well, not to be annoying, but the important factor is whether
3318.56s: or not you think the stock is going to go up.
3320.96s: That is the important factor.
3323.20s: But beyond that, there's a million, not a million, that's dramatic.
3326.40s: There is quite a few other factors that matter, but they're not, no one of them matters
3332.76s: the most necessarily.
3334.92s: They have a lot of different weighing factors.
3340.80s: Which if that's an example that you all want to go through, let me know.
3345.16s: And we can, like we can go through an example of buying a call option.
3348.28s: I'm completely down to do that.
3353.64s: Ravish, is there good idea of how to manage risk if it goes against us?
3357.68s: That's a great question.
3358.92s: So there's nothing wrong inherently with selling naked puts.
3361.84s: They have a place, but I think they need to be treated with respect.
3366.32s: And I unfortunately think a lot of people on places like this on like Thadegan.
3373.16s: I think these people just really, really miss out on a lot because they get too focused on selling options.
3381.16s: And I think that there's benefits to selling things like short puts, but like this right here.
3388.16s: This person is making a fatal, fatal attribution error.
3393.16s: And they're being supported because they posted it in a community that wants to bolster this thought process.
3400.16s: This is not because they bought options.
3403.04s: This is a complete attribution error.
3405.44s: This is not because they bought options.
3408.68s: This is not because they sold options.
3412.08s: Might have been the strategies they were using.
3413.84s: That's not what results in this.
3415.88s: You can buy an option or sell an option.
3419.52s: And if the correct profit mechanism isn't there, you lose money.
3423.80s: So in this example on the selling options.
3427.32s: If they're selling puts in this scenario, they could buy calls and do this or better if they're buying calls smartly.
3436.32s: Same thing on this side.
3437.60s: If they're buying calls and it's not working, selling puts wouldn't magically fix this.
3444.20s: So this is an attribution error.
3446.20s: It's not as simple as this.
3448.04s: So when I think about the process of selling naked short puts, it's completely okay.
3453.12s: But you have to have a broader thing that that's aligned to.
3457.36s: The process of just selling short puts doesn't, it doesn't matter, right?
3463.40s: You need the profit mechanism first.
3466.08s: So the way that I think about this exact process is I have a video on how to create profitable strategies.
3474.80s: And I'll share that in here with you guys.
3477.76s: The reason why I think this video matters is because it goes through this exact process in depth.
3484.08s: We have to start with a completely different question, which is what is the profit mechanism we're trying to action on?
3491.32s: And then what is the supporting structure slash strategy that makes sense?
3494.80s: So for example, who asks this question?
3498.00s: Let me find your name again.
3500.24s: The chose is it's the chosen, no, I like ravish.
3503.04s: ravish you still in here?
3504.72s: ravish did you leave me?
3507.68s: We have to we have to might check ravish see if ravish is here.
3510.88s: So we can finish this example with him or her.
3513.60s: I can't tell what the name ravish.
3514.88s: It could be either or ravish.
3517.32s: If you bailed on me and I've been talking about your question, I'm going to be so sad and disappointed.
3523.08s: Still a good question though.
3524.04s: So I'm really not that mad or disappointed.
3526.48s: It's a good conversation.
3528.80s: Okay, we're going to need a we're going to need a ravish stand in.
3532.80s: So whoever wants to be the surrogate ravish.
3536.72s: If you wanted to sell a put can you guys pick a ticker that we might want to sell a put in?
3543.20s: And then I'll walk you through kind of a little bit of this process.
3548.40s: And in the meantime, I'm going to open my door real quick.
3561.84s: I.
3567.44s: Roaring Titty says M I'll go with M that's slightly different than the rest of these ones.
3573.52s: Take a look at M some macy's.
3576.88s: So let's say you want to sell a put in macy's and let's use on demand.
3582.40s: We'll go back in time and work through an example.
3587.60s: Kind of find a point that would like look good.
3590.40s: Here we go.
3592.72s: Let's go back to 15 November of what is this a year ago?
3605.28s: Yeah, okay.
3606.96s: So go back to 15 November 23.
3610.16s: And we will look at Tampa.
3620.56s: Tampa, I don't know, it's up to you guys.
3623.28s: Tampa is really set on looking at Syria and they want a real world which I mean,
3628.24s: kind of they just want some help placing a trade which is okay.
3630.56s: I don't mind that.
3631.68s: But the real world example actually wouldn't work well for this at all.
3635.92s: So you won't get your ask on this one.
3640.00s: However, we can take a look at it if the rest of the chat supports you.
3646.40s: If they don't support you, then you're on your own.
3649.28s: We could look at it Monday like I said before.
3651.28s: But if everybody else here, if the other 61 people that are here right now,
3655.28s: want to take a look at it, then I'm down.
3657.36s: Okay, now let's take a look at this example though.
3659.36s: On the difference between selling calls or puts because I think I do think that this is a good example.
3664.16s: And since ravish left us, I am down and I need to make a series of assumptions for them.
3673.36s: So let's say that we want to sell naked puts in here because we think that this thing is going
3677.92s: to go up and let's say that we apply.
3683.20s: Arjun says go tasty works route, do the theta decay selling 45, close to 21 days.
3688.24s: Yeah, that's that's okay.
3690.00s: We can simulate something like that here.
3692.08s: So let's say we sell a put.
3693.44s: So let's say in this case, we have this option that goes out and then I'll buy an option that I
3700.40s: typically would something like this.
3702.16s: And if I want it to go up, I'm going to go somewhere like here.
3707.04s: Damn, I forgot you can't do them both separately.
3710.00s: So we have to do this, analyze.
3715.44s: And then we have to do this.
3719.92s: And analyze.
3722.32s: Okay.
3726.40s: Perfect.
3728.40s: Now the analyze tab in this doesn't work.
3730.40s: I really just want us to look at the prices.
3732.32s: That's why I have this.
3733.20s: It's a place for me to keep both the prices while I move the time forward.
3737.44s: So now let's fast forward what two weeks.
3740.96s: We'll give it two weeks.
3746.08s: We had a bit of a pop.
3747.60s: So we got in somewhere right around here.
3751.68s: I actually already forgot where we entered exactly.
3754.72s: But it went up that we know.
3757.76s: So if we go to the analyze tab
3760.16s: and we see where we originally transacted in these.
3763.20s: Right.
3763.52s: So we have 310 and then 64 cents.
3766.32s: So our 29 December.
3768.64s: This strike is now it's the 10.
3771.60s: Or let's look at the puts first.
3773.44s: 29 December 11 and a half put.
3775.52s: So let for 64 cents.
3778.88s: Now it's worth 5 cents.
3781.60s: So in this case.
3784.64s: What I'm looking at is this option.
3787.52s: We got a accommodating move in our favor.
3790.16s: And on this 11 and a half put,
3792.80s: we collected 64 cents, which is $64 in its entirety to start.
3798.40s: And now we can buy them back two weeks later for a nickel.
3802.16s: So in this case, that means that we essentially would have made like $59.
3806.80s: Something like that.
3808.32s: Now let's look at the long calls.
3810.72s: We had the 16 Feb 24,
3815.12s: which is out here.
3817.36s: And we had the 10 calls that we got for 310.
3820.64s: So the 10 calls for 310.
3822.72s: These are now trading for 582 and a half.
3826.48s: So we made 270 bucks on this trade.
3830.40s: Same move, same product, same timeframe.
3834.24s: This is the difference between selling puts and buying calls if you get a move in your favor.
3841.68s: This is the trade off between defined versus undefined profit.
3846.32s: Because here's the other scenario.
3850.08s: If we have something like this, this timeframe in here,
3854.64s: and we do that same trade,
3857.44s: the same comparison of those trades.
3859.76s: The short put would make money.
3863.04s: The long call would not make money.
3865.68s: And it's because it didn't go down to hurt you,
3868.80s: but it also didn't go up to help you.
3872.00s: The short put is okay with that.
3874.00s: The short put doesn't care if it doesn't go up.
3877.20s: It just doesn't want it to go down.
3880.00s: So all the way back to the original question,
3882.40s: is there anything wrong with selling puts?
3883.92s: Absolutely not.
3884.96s: I think that there needs to be a clear plan in place,
3887.92s: like if I'm trading something directionally,
3889.76s: I'm not going to sell puts typically.
3891.68s: And it's because I don't want to cap my profit.
3895.36s: However, I much prefer to sell puts as part of trying to trade putsk you,
3903.44s: trying to trade volatility versus with variance versus premium,
3907.12s: trying to play earnings collapses, stuff like that.
3910.32s: So there's nothing wrong at all with short puts.
3912.88s: I like them, but they have to be bucketed at least in my opinion logically.
3918.08s: So yeah, that's the way I think about that one personally.
3921.68s: Rudebegg is says theta people often say that selling is safer.
3925.04s: Maybe not naked.
3925.84s: I mean, less risky.
3926.48s: It's not.
3927.12s: It's a completely misguided concept.
3929.28s: And it's because they focus too much on win rate.
3932.56s: And they don't focus on expected returns.
3935.60s: So the reason why a lot of them would argue that it's safer
3938.88s: is because they win more frequently.
3940.88s: But that's not a great thing to rest on if you're a trader.
3944.80s: It doesn't matter necessarily how often you're correct.
3950.72s: That's only part of a very important question,
3953.76s: which is that of expected return.
3956.40s: So yeah, good question, but not correct.
3960.72s: Like not a correct way to focus that I should say.
3965.20s: I back up to the top.
3969.28s: Let's see what we got.
3975.76s: Budget Spinner says could you cover GameStop price action
3978.88s: in the last two days and show how we're market makers hedge
3982.08s: and how it moves the price?
3991.52s: I mean, there's not much movement here to show you.
3994.32s: I would be down, but there's just not.
3996.40s: It's been flat the last two days.
3998.40s: Like I don't actually think the market makers are doing much,
4001.68s: much hedging at all.
4003.28s: Look how light the volume is.
4006.16s: The volume is like anemic at this point.
4008.96s: Down to 13 mil.
4012.08s: When it's more active, it's like 35 plus.
4016.32s: So I don't actually think that this is a great example right now
4019.60s: of price action or where a hedge,
4025.36s: or market makers might be hedging to be honest.
4028.64s: It just looks kind of flat.
4031.28s: I think.
4037.44s: Big A says bro script.
4038.96s: Oh, dude, where was your question?
4040.40s: Sorry.
4041.12s: Wait, I didn't get to it yet.
4045.84s: I didn't get to your question yet.
4047.52s: I'm still catching up on the other questions.
4051.04s: But I didn't skip your question at all.
4053.36s: I just not there yet.
4056.08s: I'm like way up here.
4060.80s: Okay.
4064.72s: Anthony says, I like the way you break things down.
4067.84s: Some of these things are quite complex.
4069.76s: Theta and time to have correlation.
4071.04s: Yep, exactly.
4073.20s: James says you have mentioned ratio spreads.
4075.04s: Can you walk through what you look at when choosing a position?
4077.28s: Sure.
4077.84s: So I primarily trade in the context that you're referring to there.
4081.20s: I do trade other kinds of ratio spreads for volatility.
4083.84s: But that's less the context of what I would have been talking about
4087.28s: that you would be referring to.
4088.80s: Well, you would be referring to are things like ratio-called diagonals,
4091.84s: which is one I have on right now in T-Triple Cuse.
4096.88s: And the premise of the ratio-called diagonal
4099.92s: is designed to be a leveraged bullish upside play.
4104.40s: So this position, this is one that I've been working with for,
4109.76s: oh, wait, no, I'm straight up lying.
4111.28s: I'm sorry.
4112.00s: This is a covered strangle.
4113.44s: I'm an idiot.
4114.88s: I'm a complete idiot.
4116.88s: That is not that is not that at all.
4119.44s: What do I have?
4120.24s: I guess XSP is a good example of a ratio-called diagonal.
4123.84s: Sorry, guys.
4125.92s: So XSP is same kind of style idea, though.
4129.60s: This is, I have a ratio-called diagonal on in here.
4133.44s: So right now the position and I'll build it for you.
4138.48s: Is I gotta open this?
4140.64s: Okay.
4141.12s: So the longs are in 27.
4146.88s: Here.
4147.68s: And we have the 535s.
4152.48s: I'm gonna condense this down.
4156.08s: The 535s.
4159.92s: And then we got into these for 25.
4167.28s: And I always do these at a ratio.
4174.16s: So I'll use a smaller ratio to start for the sake of the example.
4180.80s: So we'll do like 15.
4184.88s: And then I am short.
4188.80s: The nine, I just rolled these today.
4190.96s: This is also a good example of defending a position.
4193.20s: Because these were in the money.
4194.96s: These were in the money short calls that I rolled out.
4197.28s: So a slightly different scenario, but I can show you the position as I have it now.
4201.28s: Which is this, the 557s.
4207.28s: Call it six of those.
4211.76s: And then these went out for three.
4217.92s: Wait, I'm messing something up here.
4221.28s: 557s.
4222.24s: Yeah, I was gonna say that's not right.
4223.92s: These ones.
4225.44s: And then these went out for 365.
4236.00s: So this is a ratio called the Agile.
4238.64s: It's a leveraged bullish play.
4240.80s: That's what I'm showing you.
4242.40s: So here's kind of a breakdown of what you're looking at.
4246.56s: You can see the equivalence of the position.
4251.28s: Let's say there's no underlying for XSP.
4254.56s: It's an index, but you can essentially use spy as a surrogate.
4258.80s: So let's say you could buy shares of XSP.
4262.48s: 15 lot gives you control over 1500 shares.
4267.76s: And right now, well, you could do Delta adjusted, but to not bother with that.
4272.96s: The total position that it would take up to is $802,500.
4278.40s: The cost to put this position on is just the 25.7 times 1500.
4286.00s: So it's 38,550.
4289.04s: So it is a leveraged play to the upside.
4293.68s: I'm trying to trade this directionally.
4298.64s: Tampa Bay.
4299.36s: I don't want to time you out, bro.
4303.52s: I'm trying to help the people learn about options.
4307.20s: I know that you're stoked on CERARITY.
4308.88s: It's all your bro.
4309.68s: I'll look at it.
4310.72s: But that's not the purpose of the session today.
4313.12s: We can look at it Monday.
4315.28s: Exhibit patients.
4317.52s: Back to this, though, on the question about the ratio diagonals.
4322.16s: So why do I do it at a ratio?
4324.16s: It's very specific.
4325.68s: So if we look at an alternate universe where I do a one for one,
4331.60s: in this case, it's a little nuanced because I was really careful with the Delta selection.
4335.92s: Yada, yada, yada.
4336.96s: So this doesn't have upside risk.
4339.44s: But in a lot of standard diagonals, so let's just go in here.
4344.80s: And actually, I think this has like a diagonal thing, right?
4350.08s: I think you could do like diagonal by.
4352.56s: I never use these combined orders.
4354.48s: Yeah, there you go.
4355.12s: Better diagonal.
4355.92s: Great.
4358.88s: So this is like a standard diagonal.
4363.12s: Notice what that looks like.
4364.64s: It is completely, completely different, completely different than what you see in the ratio called diagonal.
4376.64s: So what happens with the standard diagonal is it's more of a play on volatility.
4382.40s: You actually don't want things to move a whole lot based on wherever you choose your strike.
4387.20s: And you have both upside and downside risk.
4391.52s: So the way that I'm trading diagonals.
4394.40s: Is to give me leveraged upside potential that is uncapped.
4400.16s: Right.
4400.48s: So notice how this almost looks like long stock.
4404.16s: Not quite, but almost.
4406.56s: It's uncapped upside profit potential.
4409.60s: I collect a bit of a credit with some short options against it.
4415.04s: But this is the exact premise of the strategy.
4417.68s: It is a leveraged directional play.
4421.20s: And I actually have an entire playlist on the ratio diagonal strategies.
4426.24s: I have a video coming out soon, specifically on ratio put diagonal strategies.
4430.32s: Because people ask for a little more detail on those, which you know I'm a man of the people.
4435.92s: So that video will be out in the not so distant future.
4439.20s: But that's the concept of diagonals.
4442.00s: Obviously, I'm happy to dive further into detail as always.
4444.40s: Just let me know if you have any specific questions.
4447.28s: All right.
4447.60s: Back up.
4451.28s: Back up here.
4455.52s: Okay. We're making good a headway.
4457.36s: This is great.
4459.84s: Jawab says appreciate the streams.
4462.24s: How much positive negative effects do weekends have on the Greeks?
4465.76s: They have no negative effects.
4468.16s: Remember, the Greeks simply are ways to view impacts of options due to different factors.
4478.16s: So depending on what Greek you're referring to specifically,
4484.00s: we'll have different impacts based on the weekend.
4486.96s: One of the most commonly interest one people are interested in is they did a K.
4493.04s: And markets are smart.
4499.20s: Markets will adjust the pricing of options,
4504.32s: leading into a weekend so that a lot of the theta decay associated with the weekend
4509.76s: actually comes out before the weekend.
4512.24s: There's still theta decay over the weekend, but it is not a pure expression.
4518.24s: So the weekends will impact things differently because things can move on the weekends,
4522.80s: but it's generally a muted impact because unless there's something big that happens,
4528.64s: the weekends tend to be pretty quiet.
4534.64s: All right, back up here.
4538.40s: Fan of Airplane says, I've been selling my options way too early recently.
4541.60s: What should I be looking at to maximize gains?
4543.44s: Great question.
4544.64s: Now, I'm assuming fan of airplanes.
4546.88s: One, I assume that you are a fan of airplanes.
4552.00s: Let me know if that's a safe assumption.
4554.08s: Two, second question is, or I guess the second input to that,
4560.16s: is I would focus first on the profit mechanism.
4564.00s: So this is a great example in like TeachableQs.
4568.08s: In TeachableQs, I have long shares.
4570.72s: You can essentially replace long shares with long calls, right?
4575.76s: Long options.
4576.40s: Same thing.
4577.44s: And in this scenario, I've talked to a litany of people that thought that it was
4585.28s: overextended here, that it was overextended here, that it was overextended here,
4590.08s: that it was overextended here.
4591.44s: In this case, they were kind of right.
4592.96s: That it was overextended here, here and here.
4594.96s: What I'm highlighting is that it is so important as a trader to trade what the market is doing,
4601.20s: not necessarily what you think it's going to do.
4604.24s: Now, it's a delicate dance, as you could imagine, because it's like a chicken and the egg problem.
4609.12s: But what I'm highlighting is that I do my best to stay sensitive,
4613.92s: to current market environments.
4617.04s: So what that means is notice how I have these different stops in place.
4620.96s: Well, these are just alerts.
4622.80s: But what I do is I set triggers.
4625.68s: And I essentially say, okay, it's still going in the direction that I want.
4629.44s: I don't want to take the trade off because it's doing what I want.
4632.08s: But I also don't want to give up a bunch of money that I've made.
4635.20s: So what I'll do is I'll set different thresholds.
4639.12s: So then I will start to exit as it stops doing what I want,
4644.64s: regardless of what I think it should do.
4647.84s: Do I think that this thing has made a massive move in a relatively short period of time?
4654.08s: Abs of freaking Lutley.
4655.76s: Look at this.
4656.48s: It started the year down here at 48.
4659.76s: It's up at 81 and we're halfway through the year.
4663.20s: That's a crazy move.
4665.52s: Does that mean it can't go higher?
4668.00s: No, it can go higher.
4670.00s: It has been going higher.
4671.52s: Does that mean that it's going to go up forever and never come down?
4674.32s: Also, no, I know it's going to come down at some point.
4676.72s: That's absolutely going to happen.
4679.20s: So it's about balancing those two scenarios.
4682.24s: There's a lot of things you can do.
4684.16s: You can start phasing out of a position.
4686.64s: You can set stop losses.
4688.72s: You can set trailing stop orders.
4691.52s: You can set alerts like I do so that you're not flashing your order to the market because
4696.96s: you are a little over conservative in terms of what you show the market.
4703.92s: And then exit a trade that way or phase out of it that way.
4707.60s: This completely, completely up to you.
4710.64s: But what I think is you should not trade inherently on what you think some things value should be
4718.24s: and you should be far more open to what the market says the value is.
4722.96s: Because people thought this was too high.
4725.60s: Guess what? They missed a ride from 66 on the 28th of May to 81 85 the 5th of July.
4734.80s: It's a massive move in not a lot of time.
4738.32s: Now, again, not all that glitters is gold.
4742.00s: This will be brutal.
4743.52s: This can be brutal to the downside.
4745.60s: Look at this.
4747.84s: It went from 91 down to 16.
4751.36s: And this was from the course of 22 November of 21.
4755.44s: To what?
4756.56s: 2023 essentially like right at the start end of 2022.
4760.96s: So again, if you're not being market sensitive and you think, well, it should go up.
4764.56s: It's gone down so much and you thought that here and you thought that here.
4769.76s: And you thought that here and you thought that here and you thought that here.
4773.92s: Sooner or later, it was right and it stopped going down.
4777.36s: But guess what?
4778.48s: You just lit your money on fire taking a ride from 91 down to 16.
4784.72s: So the short answer to your question in my opinion is literally stay open to what the market
4794.08s: is doing and follow along.
4796.24s: That's it.
4799.76s: All right, back up here.
4804.08s: Joseph says when you roll over an option, are you basically just repurchasing it?
4808.80s: What are the benefits, pros and cons?
4810.16s: Great question.
4810.72s: I have a video on this exact thing that I will drop for you.
4814.08s: The short answer, Cliff Notes version of that video, is when you are rolling an option,
4818.48s: you are simply closing a position and opening anyone.
4821.28s: That's all.
4823.20s: This is a video about a bunch of myths that I see related to it.
4828.00s: And then the second video is a like a much more in depth, the analysis of rolling options.
4837.84s: And then there is another video I have coming out actually this month on just like a general guide
4845.44s: to rolling options, so different considerations to make and stuff like that.
4849.84s: So in the simplest forms, rolling an option is simply closing a trade and opening a new one.
4854.88s: That's literally it.
4856.72s: People, they again, they tie so much ego to it, not wanting to have a losing trade.
4862.48s: So they focus a lot on the potential to make the money back and all that kind of stuff.
4868.80s: And it is a giant, giant mistake.
4873.84s: Tampa says, hey, Eric, they're already attacking you.
4876.00s: I don't know who's attacking me.
4877.04s: It seems pretty mellow here, but it wouldn't surprise me.
4882.32s: We stay under attack.
4885.68s: I don't know.
4886.16s: My dog doesn't seem concerned.
4887.52s: Back up to the top.
4893.52s: Tampa says, explain to folks that if they buy a call option and want to exercise for shares and
4898.00s: don't have the actual cash, you can have your broker do a cashless exercise without running capital.
4902.16s: You can only do that though if your option is showing enough profit.
4906.08s: So yeah, the scenario that Buck is referring to is if you buy an option, call specifically.
4913.60s: And it shows enough of a profit to cover the cost of taking assignment,
4919.68s: which your portfolio would already show that in terms of the net lick that you could take the
4924.00s: position, then you can do a cashless exercise.
4926.64s: You even need to do a cashless exercise at that point though.
4929.28s: You can exercise the option and it will inherently be cashless.
4934.16s: But what he's referring to is that if the profit on your options is large enough to cover the
4938.88s: cost of it, then you are then you're able to exercise the option without putting up more cash as
4948.00s: all. Captain Chris says you got Eric Check in his windows. Yo, I'm just saying I literally have
4954.16s: cameras all around my house and I'm getting ready to put on my kit and start looking around the house.
4960.56s: I
4965.60s: back up to the top. I think we're catching up here.
4972.00s: Timmy Papparoni, that name is so funny. I bought a few days ago. I bought some out of the money
4977.28s: calls that expire the 19th, sold one up 20% then to up 40%. I don't really have an extra strategy
4985.12s: for this one now in the money. I didn't really think I'd get this far. Yeah. So then I actually
4989.76s: I think we covered a lot of that already. So Tony Papparoni, if you have any follow on questions,
4993.84s: let me know. But yeah, I think we can always say we hit most of that. All right.
5005.52s: The big ace, the question that I was accused of skipping, which I would never,
5010.88s: would you ever be able to exercise enough options for the gamma of buying shares to cause an
5016.88s: offset of the loss of action as a value? They're kind of different things.
5025.44s: Yeah. I see your point. The probability of that happening, though, is very, very low.
5031.68s: So yeah, it's an interesting idea, but it's unlikely.
5035.68s: A Tampa Bay says, what is your version of one shot one kill on options flow gamma vague along calls?
5045.84s: I don't follow your question there. When when looking at options flow for me, it's like it's very,
5054.72s: very much a position that's built. It's stuff that you kind of build little pieces of the puzzle.
5062.40s: It's like filling in a puzzle, I guess, is the the best way I could describe it. There's not really
5066.56s: like a one, a one set thing. Agents says his position might have tested that 120k near-term options.
5075.36s: Yeah, that's a great question. And it could have caused a movement, but the problem is is that
5081.76s: the very movement, it would cause would be very, very difficult to purely isolate to the exercise
5088.56s: of those options themselves because here's the other thing. If it's anything other than GameStop,
5093.52s: typically, as you have options that are in the money getting closer to expiration,
5099.04s: the market makers hedging their position. So if you think about something like this,
5105.60s: and let's say that you bought options that were 30 delta right here.
5110.32s: And at the 85s, the 129, let's say you got them for 129. And they're 32 delta. Let's say then you
5125.12s: get a big move in your favor. And now your options look more like these in here that are like 88 delta's.
5132.64s: The market maker is hedging their position as this is going in the money. They're not just
5139.12s: watching it, hoping that it's going to go back out. They're going to have shares,
5146.00s: especially as he gets close to expiration to cover this if it's in the money. Now,
5151.60s: it gets a little bit muddied when we look at the profit incentives for market makers and the way
5162.00s: that they think about it. Tampa says this dude is hedging his way not yours.
5172.24s: I don't follow. This is like just standard market making hedging.
5178.40s: Yeah, this isn't how I would hedge. I'm not taking the other side of these positions.
5183.44s: But for a market maker, their primary profit modality is the bit ask spread.
5189.44s: Their goal is to isolate that.
5192.56s: So I don't know if your point there, Tampa is the scenarios where you can have
5198.56s: market makers that are bending the rules. And that does happen with GME, which is what makes GME
5203.52s: special to be very clear is what I'm talking about is general approach. The reason I'm sticking
5210.00s: with general approach is compared to talking about anomalies or anomalies in the markets is because
5216.00s: you're a bull BSC bow. Well, I want whatever you've had to be honest.
5226.96s: You remind me of Howard Terrence from that Joe Rogan episode with Eric Weinstein.
5231.84s: It's hilarious. But with stuff like GameStop, a lot of times if you have a really greedy market maker,
5240.80s: which greedy market makers don't stay in business for too long. And looking at
5247.60s: their behavior, sometimes they will purposefully under hedge with the hope of being able to
5253.28s: squeak out more profit. But funny enough, and I actually talked to dudes in the discord about this,
5258.48s: when I was having this conversation. And during the conversation, I reached out to a guy that I had
5265.76s: on the podcast that runs a multi-billion dollar ETF and ETF business. He connected me with one of
5274.40s: his friends that works on one of the options markets part of his book that is ex-institutional
5283.04s: side that turned kind of into his own business. And he worked at Susquejana. He went through their
5290.96s: whole program. And for them, I asked them about Roe and Kitty's specifically. And when I looked at
5302.32s: the position I asked them, I was like, what would happen here? What would you do?
5307.68s: And he was saying that for that option position specifically, the 120,000 long calls, he said
5313.36s: that he would be hedged. He would be fully hedged. The other thing he said is that if he thought
5318.00s: that it was an informed trader, which we know market makers can do this, they can piggyback off the
5322.56s: order flow. They know that there's going to be a bunch of order flow coming in. So they literally
5326.88s: can move with the order flow to make some money via surrounding long calls. So there's a lot of
5332.00s: different games that they can play. But yeah, I think that this is an interesting example for an
5340.72s: anomaly. But this is not how market makers typically will make markets, especially if they want to
5344.56s: stay in business. I backup, backup to the top.
5354.96s: A little more, a little more.
5361.68s: A little more.
5368.48s: Okay, here we go. Zach says, I'd in the money call options, if I closed out, it would be
5373.28s: at a loss. His premium paid was six, 10.
5381.68s: And as of today was 475, generally speaking, better off rolling them, preference is not to exercise.
5388.16s: I would just reestablish the position. So if I was in that scenario, there's no reason to
5392.80s: necessarily roll them at all. Like if you still like whatever you have to the upside, but you want
5397.04s: to take them down and reestablish your deltas or whatever, I would literally just take the position
5401.04s: down and change it. Move it to the position that you want. That's all.
5407.52s: Alfonso says during the GME friends, I bought some puts, which actually increased in value,
5412.16s: even though the underlying share price was increasing rapidly, the IV was insanely high,
5415.76s: not complaining. Yeah, that's awesome. And that's that's exactly right. You're attributing it
5418.96s: to the to the precise thing. That's good. Joseph says, I bought one leap for GPS at 28.
5426.00s: The reason why I got because there was high volume of calls for it, am I right? What would be
5430.72s: considered high volume or unusual volume? That's a great question. So for Joseph Pa,
5440.88s: where was that question? I want to be able to refer to it. Here we go.
5445.04s: Okay. So Joseph Pa, let's take a look at this. Joseph, what was the expiration?
5457.36s: And we literally can build a trade real quick to take a look at it together.
5462.08s: All right.
5474.32s: All right. I just love seeing very titties name pop up. It makes me so happy.
5482.48s: Okay. 19 July. Let's take a look at some GPUs. And let's go to 19 July. Wait,
5490.24s: did I miss up? 19 July. Oh, so these are short dated. Whatever reason I thought that these were
5495.52s: going to be longer dated. I don't know why. And the 28 strike. I hate that position. I think it's
5507.92s: a terrible position personally. I think it's a terrible position for a bunch of different reasons,
5512.72s: but that's not your question. Your question is more about like anomalous flow and stuff like that.
5517.92s: And what this doesn't look, am I looking at the right thing? This looks dead.
5524.64s: There's literally 2000 OI. It looks like nothing's happening here. Do you mean like volume in the
5529.76s: underlying? Is that what you meant? Even that looks dead.
5540.00s: What Joseph, what were you looking at that felt like anomalous to you?
5547.92s: It does have bigger call volume. That's for sure. But it's out in 16 August.
5554.56s: And it's the 23s. Joseph says I thought that was a lot. Okay. Got it. Yeah. No, it's definitely not.
5560.32s: This is this. This to me is dead. There's really not much going on here. This is slightly big,
5566.16s: like in terms of the discrepancy between these two, but 8000 options trading is like
5570.72s: like an individual can do that. It's such small fries that it doesn't matter really.
5575.92s: The total open interest here is like 129K. So this overall is tiny. Yeah, not much.
5586.32s: Shout out to Roy Titty. That's probably my favorite comment. One, thank you again very much.
5591.76s: You have no idea. I really, really appreciate the generosity. It means a lot. Thank you.
5598.24s: But to the fact that that just puts Roy Titty's name on blast because it's hilarious.
5603.28s: That is good as it could possibly get. So yeah. Anyways, when I look at this,
5608.48s: there's really not much that I see going on.
5619.76s: All right.
5620.40s: Back up here. All right. Being gaming might be a stupid question. We love those. Man,
5629.84s: we're always here for some questions. How does Theta Decay work for longer length calls versus
5634.16s: short term? Yeah. It's a great question. So the we actually talked a little bit about that
5638.64s: earlier. So I don't want to double tap too much. And I also go through this heavily in that video
5643.52s: that I posted on buying calls smarter. But the Clifnotes version is Theta Decay is highest for
5651.92s: at the money options and as you get closer to expiration. So Theta Decay will expand as you get
5659.84s: closer in. Now there's a little bit of relativity that needs to come into play because you can have
5667.52s: options that are further out in time with a moderate size Theta. And then you can compare that to
5676.72s: something that zero DTE. And you can say, well, wait a minute. The Theta here is zero. But you said
5681.76s: it gets higher as it gets in. Well, the problem is, is these have no more extrinsic value to come out.
5686.24s: It's gone. So what ends up happening is as a percentage of the remaining premium Theta will be very
5692.88s: high as you come in. But again, like you can look at this and you could say, well, wait a minute.
5697.60s: This 17 delta, it only has two Theta. Well, it's because there's just not much extrinsic value left
5705.12s: to come out of those. Whereas if we look at, you know, again, a 17 delta in here, which might still be
5710.24s: about a two Theta as a percentage of the remaining premium is much smaller. So yeah, your instinct is
5715.92s: correct. It is the punchline. Nice job. Paul says, here's a trait of thought of placing when
5722.40s: Tesla is around 180 short strangle 152 45 nine aug. It would be a precarious position today. How
5729.04s: would you go about adjusting it? That's a great question. So first, let's take a look at Tesla
5734.64s: and see what see what the dealio is. Yeah. Okay. And when did you think of this?
5741.20s: Earlier this week. What do you mean like the first? Because honestly, like to me, I think your
5750.00s: eyeball is way off. If anything, literally anything from here, we thought about like placing a
5759.84s: short strangle. I think that that's nuts. This would be what we would call a terrible, terrible trait.
5771.60s: But anyways, in this case, like to succinctly answer this question, I would close the position for
5777.52s: a loss. Like you would just be getting murdered. So yeah, this is not what I would trade at all. I
5786.80s: have I had a position on in Tesla that I took off too early because I'm a paper handed pansy. I
5793.04s: hate myself. But I ended up catching a really nice move in here, but I was trading it to the upside.
5799.28s: So this is not something I would trade a short strangle. If I were to trade a short strangle,
5803.28s: the hypothesis would be typically imply volatility trending over realize volatility, which is
5808.48s: literally not what has happened since the first at all. If it got blown out, I would have
5816.08s: predetermined P and L. P and L targets. So the way I would look at it as let's say that I put the
5825.68s: trade on the first because I'm crazy. Apparently, I would figure out what loss I'm comfortable taking
5833.20s: on the position. So let's see if we can do on demand. If it lets us go this close. I don't know. I
5838.24s: think typically it lags by like a full week, but let's see. It does. Damn it. Wait, what's today?
5842.88s: The fifth. No, it does. We can go here. It's a great.
5849.92s: And so let's say that I wanted to model shorting a strangle. And let's say what were you looking at?
5859.28s: I have to go back up. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
5865.20s: Damn it. I lost the question. Here it is. Nineog. So you would have gone out to the nineog.
5877.60s: Okay. So the first piece of input I would give you is I wouldn't go to nineog. The reason being is
5882.00s: it's a weeklies. Unless there's a very specific reason for me to go into the weeklies, I'm just
5886.48s: going to go to the next to the nearest primary expiration. There's nothing wrong with the weeklies.
5892.16s: But the problem with the weeklies, let's look at this. The 150 and then 245. If I go to the 150,
5899.36s: they're 20 cents wide here. And that is a four delta, which I also hate very, very low delta.
5906.32s: Well, let's look at a four delta here. These are a penny wide.
5911.20s: Right? So this is the very first thing is when you're trading in stuff like this, you are giving up
5917.76s: so much, so much, because it's very low volume. It's not that liquid in here. So that's the first
5925.36s: thing I would change. I would go to at least the 16-og. The second thing is five delta is way too low
5930.16s: in my opinion, because you're not collecting enough for the risk that you're taking. You're essentially
5934.48s: selling tail risk, which is a tough way to make business. You'll make money most of the time,
5939.76s: but when you get caught, it will be murderous and it will happen every so often, which funny enough,
5945.12s: it's happening here. I won't be able to fast forward through the week, because it's just done
5950.80s: and they don't have it in here yet. But to play the scenario out, we have the 245s,
5957.52s: which you're a madman. I just realized what's going on here. You're crazy. So you did a 30 delta on
5962.80s: this side and a five delta. Did I miss read? No, you said the 150s. You did a four delta. You're a
5969.36s: madman. I would love to go to Vegas with you, because I can only imagine the bets you'd be
5974.80s: placing out there. It would be something, something magical. But in this case, I would model this trade.
5983.92s: I would say I stand to make 800 bucks. Here's my risk profile. When does this start to lose too
5991.84s: much money relative to what I can make? If I go all the way out to the break evens of the trade,
5997.84s: I run a specific risk. And the reason why I run a risk here is because
6010.08s: even though this position would be fully profitable here, I technically would potentially lose
6016.56s: just $3. If I don't hold to expiration, the unrealized P&L, if it moved there in the near
6026.80s: term would be almost $1,600, $1,700. Roy Titty says Tampa needs to be kicked out of here. I
6034.64s: really try not to do that. I don't like to do that. You run a risk because people think you are FOS.
6043.04s: That's okay. Yeah, that's okay. I think Buck guy is fine. I would just leave them alone. Let
6048.48s: them do their thing. There's no problem. I try to be open for people being here. I don't like
6054.80s: censoring people and I don't like pushing people away unless they're like egregiously obnoxious
6061.68s: or disrespectful. But I think we're getting close, but we're not there yet. So I would avoid,
6068.88s: look to avoid it. See if we can get through the next 10 minutes amicably. That would be my hope
6073.20s: here. But back over to this, I would say maybe here. Let's say that I stand to make 800 bucks.
6080.80s: And I'm okay if I lose $1,600, whatever that is. So in this case, that would take me to like
6087.52s: $253, and then down here, it would take me much lower. Actually, I forgot because the
6094.24s: Delta is so skewed. Okay. Sorry, Buck. That's no bono. So we're going to kill that.
6108.08s: And then we're going to do that. So unfortunately, because I forgot, I don't even know who we
6118.80s: tried to insult, but I don't deal with that. So sorry, brother, we're not playing that game.
6128.96s: Chase says Tampa is special emphasis on the special. Yeah, you never know what somebody's
6133.20s: going through, right? So like I said, I really try to give everybody the benefit of the doubt. I
6136.72s: don't even I've literally already forgot who they were trying to insult, but like I don't do that.
6142.80s: Oh, it was roaring. Titty. I can see the deleted message. I don't know if you guys can, but I can.
6148.56s: I have to like click a little button. And I just realized that it was roaring to like the one
6153.20s: person I'm not going to play that came. That's hilarious. Yeah, in a way, that's the Louis go.
6163.04s: That's hilarious. So yeah, back to this, what I would do in this case is just set a range. It
6172.64s: would be something like this. It would be to the 253 and then something down here, let's just call
6179.04s: to the 134. So what I would do is I would say, okay, if we get up here to 253, I would set an alert,
6185.68s: but for the sake of this, I will just drop a bar. And then what I say to the bottom, like 154,
6193.44s: something like that. So then it's that simple. If I hit either of those, my hypothesis is wrong,
6200.72s: meaning that implied will trend over realized. And at that point, there would be the accumulation
6206.72s: of a realized move, not necessarily over implied if it's all one directional, but it's enough
6212.16s: that it would cause me to generally doubt my thesis. And then simply accept being wrong and move on.
6218.08s: That's what I would do in that scenario. That's a great question.
6222.96s: John says, high AF in an options learning live stream. Yeah, that's a great place to do it,
6230.56s: man. Like you never know, that might be the right mindset to be in, especially on a Friday night.
6235.44s: That's my favorite part is I do these on a Friday night where most people are like trying to go out
6239.36s: and go go to the bar or whatever. That's the best.
6242.80s: All right.
6252.00s: Diswag says, also I've been wanting to build my GME strangle, but there is always a piece of me
6257.36s: that's afraid of missing out on something important. The good thing is a good basis. Yeah, that's awesome.
6261.60s: Captain Chris says, I saw a Reddit post somebody purchased 4,000 VSC of 15 call.
6273.60s: It does not have a lot of volume. Do you see any future potential with this call hitting money?
6276.80s: Well, it's a good question. So a couple things. The first one is it's important to remember.
6280.56s: It doesn't need to go in the money to make money. Right. So this position, let's replicate it.
6286.64s: The 816 you said so here and the 15. Which I actually like that by. It's an 80 delta. That's a good trade.
6297.20s: And it looks like this trade would have went on semi-recently. I actually, I think I've told you
6302.48s: guys this already, but I started an affiliate relationship with unusual whales because they have
6311.44s: a slick platform for this kind of stuff that's a little more user-friendly than what I do.
6315.68s: So there's a discount code in the video description for folks that are interested. But let's take a look.
6326.72s: And what is this? The 15. So if we grab the 15 strike.
6333.28s: So I'm going to take.
6335.12s: Thor, leave yourself alone.
6339.12s: At the old my dog. Sorry, you guys know what goes.
6345.12s: And.
6349.12s: So I'm looking at essentially the last. Oh, that's not what I meant last month.
6357.12s: Oh, interesting. So it looks like most of the activity would have been like the last week, right?
6361.60s: Yeah. So this is all activity within the last week, which I do find that interesting.
6366.96s: This is this is an interesting trade.
6375.84s: So what I'm looking at right now is the size of the positions that are going on, which is here.
6383.44s: I'm looking at the frequency. So when they went on.
6387.68s: So it looks like a lot of these are multi-leg.
6393.20s: Which I don't feel as strongly about.
6400.48s: The trade was to open as determined by the size. Only trades that can be positive, identify,
6407.44s: marked as such. Yeah, okay.
6412.64s: Yeah, that's interesting accumulation.
6415.44s: For sure.
6423.04s: So there's a couple other things now that I would look at.
6427.04s: Let me get this out of the way for now.
6430.72s: And let's take a look at some other stuff.
6434.80s: I get this out of the way.
6438.32s: So the open interest is not exciting at all.
6441.60s: The open interest indicates a pretty big balance between calls and puts.
6450.48s: The interesting position really is this one that went on that we were just talking about those
6453.84s: 15s. These are like sad little. This is so funny.
6471.04s: So what I'm right now doing is kind of assessing the volatility smile.
6482.32s: And these are interesting because the put side is heavy, which I would expect.
6487.52s: But the call side obviously was gaining a little bit of traction.
6491.52s: And the 15s.
6494.88s: They went on a little bit cheap.
6498.24s: It looks like.
6503.12s: Which is good.
6504.00s: It means that they wouldn't have gone on super expensive.
6506.88s: So that looks interesting to me.
6511.36s: But a lot of what I see in here is kind of not a whole lot.
6518.00s: So the other thing I would want to keep an eye on is the influx of volume.
6524.24s: And then the other thing I would want to keep an eye on is any news.
6528.08s: Because it looks like something's going on here.
6529.84s: Yeah. What happened today in here? Do you know?
6540.80s: Roryntitty says, wait, Temple is going on about me.
6543.92s: I'm not the cat. I don't think anybody knows.
6546.16s: Well, what was going on?
6547.52s: But you definitely had a comment director towards you, which we were not again.
6553.28s: I'm happy to take abuse.
6555.04s: You guys have been on enough live streams where people want to talk.
6558.40s: And I don't really care.
6559.28s: Man, it doesn't bother me.
6560.08s: But I don't let people talk disrespectfully towards other people.
6564.24s: That ain't going to be it.
6566.08s: And then if it gets too a threshold with me, I also won't tolerate it.
6569.28s: But I have no problem taking more of it because I don't care.
6575.12s: Yeah. So I don't see a bunch of news.
6577.20s: Which is funny because of this.
6584.32s: I literally was going to show you guys this other study.
6588.56s: This and this.
6592.40s: So these are two two studies you guys should look at.
6595.28s: This one is fascinating.
6602.40s: What this is highlighting is that there is absolutely an observable
6606.40s: abundance of this kind of activity where people that have insider information,
6614.40s: you don't have to look any further than Nancy Pelosi for that joking, but not joking.
6619.92s: We'll use options.
6621.12s: And it's because they're more efficient.
6623.20s: So you can see that this is really interesting.
6625.68s: That 25% of takeovers have abnormal positive values short dated out of the money calls.
6632.00s: That's expectation of big move, right?
6634.32s: If you know a company you're in has the potential of being taken over,
6637.28s: buying out of the money calls is a great move.
6639.76s: And the fun part is if you look at the bottom, it says that the SEC litigates only 8%.
6647.60s: So there is a massive, massive number of these kinds of positions that go through with no litigation.
6654.80s: So it's kind of a low risk way to, I guess be shitty or take advantage of things.
6661.68s: But anyways, you guys should check out that study as well.
6663.68s: It talks about that kind of stuff a little bit.
6670.88s: All right, see what else you guys got.
6677.36s: Crypteto says what would be the most beginner-friendly book to start with?
6684.08s: The most beginner-friendly book to start with would be this one probably.
6690.08s: Options is a strategic investment, I believe.
6693.76s: That's why I recommend it to most people.
6696.16s: That's why it's kind of the standard go-to book.
6699.60s: It's because it gives you enough to go off of.
6702.88s: It's a decent summary of a lot of high-level topics.
6706.88s: I like this book a lot.
6708.72s: The, this one here is also a must-have in my opinion by Sheldon Natenberg,
6716.08s: falsely imprising.
6717.04s: And then this one too, optional option trading.
6719.44s: This is a good one.
6720.56s: But these get a little more nuanced than necessary, I think.
6724.48s: So the short answer is this one would be my beginner,
6727.68s: special or my beginner, beginner option trading book.
6737.60s: All right.
6739.68s: Oh, that's a weird name.
6741.36s: Joe Sway.
6742.56s: Is that like, Hossway?
6743.84s: I don't know that one.
6746.00s: Interesting name.
6748.08s: I don't know how to say your name.
6749.36s: I'm doing my best out here.
6753.04s: But,
6755.84s: shit, now I lost it.
6756.80s: Where was it?
6761.20s: I think it was in here.
6762.72s: There it is.
6763.76s: Usually what strategy do you use the most?
6765.44s: Buying calls, covered calls,
6766.88s: buying puts, selling puts?
6769.04s: The most frequented strategies for me are the
6771.60s: coverage strangle and ratio diagonal sandstown.
6774.64s: So those are two videos that I kind of have a playlist on.
6778.88s: I'm actually working on a video soon.
6780.96s: That's just like how I trade options a little more broadly.
6784.32s: But those two are definitely the the go-to's for me.
6789.04s: Captain Chris says you strike me as a shroom and stocks kind of guy.
6792.16s: I really don't like drugs.
6794.24s: So that is not so much my go-to.
6798.88s: Diswags as congrats on the usual whales.
6801.12s: I mean, honestly, not a great deal for me.
6803.44s: I don't really care about the affiliates.
6805.04s: The reason why I sign up for affiliates is straight up for people that want it
6810.00s: to give them a discount.
6811.12s: That's literally it.
6812.32s: I don't even know what the what the kickback is for it for me.
6815.28s: They're typically not good.
6817.60s: So like,
6819.12s: but that's the beauty with a lot of the people that will join the the Patreon and stuff like that.
6824.24s: Because then it lets me not worry at all about affiliates and shit.
6829.68s: So I kind of can just try to find stuff that I think is
6833.60s: decent.
6835.84s: But anyways, I appreciate all the same.
6842.40s: Two lures says I have 50 GME calls with 20 strike, 19 July, and 23, 50 for each date,
6851.52s: costs a little over 50.
6852.80s: Do you think it's a good idea?
6853.68s: I think it's a good idea based on your hypothesis.
6856.96s: It'll be a good idea if it works.
6858.32s: It'll be a terrible idea if it doesn't work.
6860.32s: The jokes aside there really what determines a good idea is like if it's a good expression
6865.44s: of your idea, that's all.
6868.96s: Now in terms of the structure of what you bought we can take a look at.
6873.28s: And the first thing is I think the 19 July is a giant mistake
6880.48s: because it is way too short dated.
6883.52s: I like that they're in the money.
6885.36s: So that will help offset some of the theta decay that you're going to get in this
6890.00s: really short term timeframe.
6892.00s: However, you're going to also experience
6895.84s: not like you need a pretty big move here, but you'll move dollar for dollar, which is good.
6900.88s: So in that sense that's all good.
6902.80s: I like the 16-og way better.
6905.12s: And the reason why I like the 16-og way better, even though it's a little more expensive,
6908.32s: a little more extrinsic value, the trade has some time to work.
6911.36s: Now if you tell me that your thesis is something is going to fly off the handle in the next
6917.52s: week and that's part of your hypothesis, then yeah, I think being closer makes sense.
6923.28s: I also like that you use the primary explorations.
6926.08s: I like that you didn't use any of these weird little half strikes that the weaklies have
6930.72s: or anything like that because they're less liquid.
6933.20s: So from those from that standpoint and from those perspectives, I think it's fine.
6940.32s: I don't love the 19 July, but it's just because there's just not a lot of time left is all.
6947.68s: So
6949.68s: orange guy says, can I show you something on a certain stock chart and ask for your opinion?
6953.28s: Yeah, of course. Happy to take a look. I still got a few minutes.
6957.92s: Back up to the top though.
6963.20s: Moody blues, good to see you. I haven't seen you in a minute.
6966.72s: I heard this somewhere that the market tends to drop or month or two before election day.
6971.68s: Is that rumors?
6972.56s: Or do you try to trade it by placing longer shorter days' aspirations?
6975.20s: A great question. So what that would kind of fall into is the thing we would call seasonality.
6979.52s: And you can find all different kinds of seasonality.
6981.68s: I don't know that one off the top of my head.
6983.44s: I do have a data set that could tell me so that's something I can follow up on for sure.
6987.28s: In the discord, I'll take a note on that right now.
6990.00s: That's a really easy one. That'll take me straight up just a couple minutes.
6994.08s: But we'll take a look at market behavior.
6998.40s: Five days, two days, and one day,
7005.20s: pre and post election. And we can break that out too by like who's elected and that kind of stuff,
7011.28s: which is typically useful. So yeah, definitely.
7015.28s: I just don't want to give you a bad answer up front.
7018.08s: The other thing we could do realistically, and I bet that there's something on it already is this.
7021.52s: Let me take a look. Quick look.
7023.20s: This is our end stock market election year.
7029.12s: Yeah.
7030.40s: Most of this stuff has been researched to some degree.
7032.96s: I am a little bit of a data control freak.
7036.32s: I like understanding what I'm using.
7038.08s: So I typically look at my own stuff and essentially only my own stuff.
7042.00s: But I always will look for what exists already.
7044.88s: So here's one right here that we can look through together very quickly.
7051.84s: Okay, never mind.
7052.80s: This one is from good old Bangladesh, which I actually am less interested in.
7059.84s: Let's test this one.
7063.36s: That's Nigeria. It's good.
7066.32s: Maybe we have to do like in the US.
7069.52s: Here's another one we can take a look at real quick before I abandon ship.
7074.24s: What country are you from? They use commas in their decimal points.
7083.36s: Let's see.
7095.76s: I don't really like this so far what I'm reading.
7102.96s: The United States,
7105.60s: the exact day every even year.
7108.00s: Here you go. Positive drift starts as soon as the fifth day before the election.
7112.40s: Ends at the day of election with almost two and a half percent performance on average.
7115.84s: There you go.
7116.56s: And obviously you'd want to do a bunch more research about the quality,
7119.28s: the distribution, like those kinds of things.
7121.12s: But yeah, there's at least a pre-limancer before I have a chance to look at it myself,
7125.44s: which again, we'll do because I prefer to look at my own shit.
7134.32s: Beach dreaming says, dang, I never catch these on time.
7137.20s: Thanks for all you're doing.
7138.00s: Great at teaching. That's awesome.
7138.88s: I love I literally love teaching.
7140.48s: It's teaching, it's funny because like it's not just teaching this stuff.
7145.60s: It's teaching anything that I have a skill set in.
7148.64s: I really, really value the process of teaching.
7151.60s: A big reason behind that I try to give people like the motivations for stuff.
7154.80s: And like I grew up with a single mom and I knew my dad and I loved my dad,
7161.92s: but it was a weird relationship and it wasn't super healthy.
7165.92s: Long story short, the way that I learned how to become like a man
7170.08s: and learn things is from a lot of different people.
7172.88s: I had people teach me about cars.
7174.80s: I had people teach me about basketball.
7176.80s: I had people teach me about cooking steaks.
7179.44s: And it's all these different dudes that help teach me a bunch of different things.
7182.72s: So I derived a tremendous amount of value from that.
7186.40s: And I think that's why I'm so passionate about teaching is for that exact reason.
7193.12s: Crypteto, thank you so much.
7195.28s: I hope you have a killer rest of your evening and weekend.
7198.64s: And I'll see you during the market prep session on Sunday.
7202.56s: Thank you very much, man.
7208.96s: Back up the, John says, I'm fairly new.
7212.96s: Would you say there's a certain time of year when stocks perform the best like summers?
7218.48s: Yes and no.
7219.44s: There are broad answers you could apply to that, but the very situation dependent.
7223.52s: So there is absolutely a seasonality to a lot of different things that you can observe.
7228.40s: But there's enough variance in it that it makes sense to learn the variance, I would say.
7238.56s: Captain says, does it make sense to exercise these close to expiration
7242.40s: because some sort of movement towards earnings or something?
7244.24s: I'm unsure.
7245.20s: Typically not.
7245.92s: If you're talking about your options, typically it's most logical to just trade them.
7251.52s: Reese says, I know what a standard deviation implies, but how is that number calculated?
7259.52s: So there's a few different ways you can think about
7267.84s: standard deviation specifically with respect to volatility, which is essentially that.
7272.64s: But it uses the square root of the variance from a mean.
7281.04s: And the reason why you do, well, it's technically the variance squared
7284.08s: then you do the square root of that.
7285.60s: And that just creates positive integers for everything and then it magnifies it a little bit
7290.08s: when you square it.
7291.44s: And then you square root it to get back to the unilateral base metric.
7297.84s: So yeah, that's kind of it.
7302.96s: So one key rep says, how come my question's gone?
7305.76s: I didn't see it.
7306.88s: If you have one, they'll feel free to drop it in.
7308.96s: I'm about to hop off in a minute because my B-dub just got here, but I am happy to take a look.
7318.80s: Oh, let's see.
7321.20s: Okay, let me get through these last two.
7325.36s: Orange says BBBY.
7329.52s: So the problem with stuff like this is I don't think you can apply standard technical analysis
7334.16s: is what it boils down to.
7335.60s: Like products like this are really anomalous.
7339.20s: Their floats behave very differently.
7341.84s: And also my chart's not loading it.
7343.76s: So a little bit of an uneventful, but this doesn't,
7349.44s: this typically doesn't follow standard rules is really the way I would boil that down.
7353.92s: Alfa says, I have a stocks related question.
7359.84s: Should I trade my shares in BDSM of stocks for something more recent?
7365.92s: I think you should do whatever you want.
7368.24s: I'm really, I have no opinion or vested interest in what individual traders do with their positions.
7374.56s: And I don't say that to defer or to not answer your question, but it's to force you to answer
7380.48s: your own question. I think that that's why.
7384.96s: And it's because like trading is going to be based on your own thoughtware.
7390.00s: If you like whatever stock you have and you want to continue holding it, do that.
7394.80s: If whatever stock you have isn't doing what you want it to do anymore, then don't hold it.
7400.16s: Get rid of something else.
7404.32s: Orange, guys, said I just had a question on the past patterns because something can be learned.
7408.32s: And yeah, so I think, yeah, like I said, I would love to pull it up, but there's nothing going
7415.36s: on here because I literally can't load it. But I was just kind of commenting on BBY anyways.
7422.24s: Because one of the things to think about is like with prior patterns and stuff like this is
7427.68s: because they're so anomalous, it's actually very difficult to like discreetly attribute them to
7434.56s: things. So all right, you guys that officially sums me up. I think this is the longest one we've
7442.56s: done. This is over two hours, but I had a blast with you guys. I'm going to go stuff my fat face
7446.40s: and then walk my dog. But I will see you guys in the discord over the weekend. Be an outlier.
7451.52s: I'll see you guys for part six next Friday. Catch you later.
