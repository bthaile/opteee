0.68s: what's up outliers quick GameStop update
3.64s: as promised I'm on a weekly Cadence now
5.28s: we'll take a look at this and really the
7.76s: main thing I want to talk about today is
9.20s: where GameStop currently sits and it's
11.64s: because from a technical perspective
13.20s: it's at a very interesting level as you
14.76s: can tell all of these lines have been on
16.24s: the chart you've seen them before so I
18.40s: want to talk about how price is reacting
20.44s: to these different thresholds and what
22.68s: we might expect but before that as per
25.16s: usual let's get a quick
27.16s: recap from the Saturday stream in case
30.04s: weren't able to make it and I actually
32.04s: want to talk about this specifically
33.40s: because we also hit a landmark this last
36.28s: Saturday so we had episode 31 that is 31
40.12s: Saturdays in a row where I've been
42.16s: spending at least an hour upwards of 2
44.76s: and a half hours live streaming with you
47.12s: all looking at the GameStop Saga and we
49.64s: are this wrapped up part 13 of reviewing
53.08s: the top theories and due diligence that
56.28s: exists now we've been going through the
58.96s: DD Library for this 13p part sub series
62.24s: and we actually just wrapped up the
64.32s: diamond handbook it's over 800 pages of
68.44s: due diligence that's been Consolidated
70.32s: down along with amas and things like
72.00s: that so I wanted to take a second and
73.72s: actually one just share that fact with
75.52s: you because that's crazy to me that's
76.80s: really interesting that we looked at
78.08s: that much information together is all of
80.52s: you know hopefully by now my goal is not
83.24s: to spread hype or fud genuinely I am
86.36s: just curious about the world around me I
88.64s: like learning things I like exploring so
91.08s: that means I don't really take what
92.88s: people say as law I like to look at
96.20s: source documents and actually see the
98.28s: things for myself and that's what we've
100.68s: been doing here is having a chance to
102.28s: actually look at things with our own
104.00s: eyes versus hearing somebody says
106.68s: something about something and then
108.64s: thinking that we know about that topic
110.56s: which typically might be partial truths
112.88s: I like to know the details so I want to
116.08s: summarize a couple of the key themes
117.80s: that I came across as I was doing the
119.48s: series the First theme is that the DD
122.76s: library has a glorious mix of varying
125.52s: levels of due diligence there are a lot
128.28s: of things in there that I would
131.00s: objectively summarize as you know people
134.40s: that are trying but not really anything
137.04s: you can objectively point at and say we
140.16s: found something objective here like a
142.08s: lot of it is people sharing their
143.24s: opinions their thoughts and things like
144.68s: that which I'm not discounting that
146.48s: that's actually a really important
147.76s: process in our path to exploring things
150.72s: is to postulate ideas so just want to be
152.84s: clear I'm not talking bad against that
154.72s: there's just a lot of that in there and
156.60s: then there's actually the section of DD
159.04s: that I have to be honest I am most
160.72s: interested in and there are pieces in
163.68s: there that are really really high
167.24s: quality research that Source documents
170.72s: are cited and there are a lot of dots
173.60s: being connected those are my favorites
176.80s: because it removes the in objectiveness
181.04s: of our opinions and we're looking at
183.56s: objective facts reality as it sits and
187.96s: there are a number of issues that were
189.92s: raised that I saw in the DD library that
192.68s: I think are worth recapping for
194.52s: everybody and I want to be clear none of
196.44s: this I don't think is going to be new
197.72s: news to you I think it's going to be
200.12s: mostly recapping but the first thing is
204.48s: the key issues that we came across in
206.80s: the DD Library things like naked
209.20s: shorting things like ftds things like
212.92s: conflicts of interest there are varying
215.16s: degrees of all of those and also I
218.64s: should say um not La intransparent lack
222.16s: of transparent markets and Reporting
224.08s: that's a big one actually that would be
225.24s: the fourth one I would list and of those
228.60s: things something that really stuck out
230.92s: to me that is partially disheartening
233.76s: but also partially not shocking is a lot
238.44s: of the issues that the Library
240.88s: specifically the diamond handbook that
242.44s: was going back to explore they a lot of
244.92s: these were written back in 2021 and
246.84s: they're citing documents from you know
248.88s: the prior decade almost two decades
251.28s: before that there was a video that we
253.72s: came across that was talking about Wall
255.84s: Street and a lot of the issues with Wall
258.08s: Street and there's a section in there
259.24s: with Dr Susan trimbath and she's talking
261.96s: about naked
263.64s: shorting the sad part about this is that
267.28s: part of the video was shot in like the
269.48s: early early
270.72s: 2000s she was talking about something
274.16s: that she was in the video citing
276.72s: something back like 10 years so that
279.64s: takes us back to 1990s into the 2000s as
283.96s: different versions of these videos were
285.80s: made talking about naked shorting and
289.20s: it's still a conversation point it's
292.48s: still a thing today the reason why
295.80s: that's so important to identify is
298.76s: because that tells us very clearly with
301.48s: the powers that be the various conflicts
304.04s: of interests that exist and the current
306.20s: incentive structure there is a lack of
310.00s: incentive to actually Institute change
314.40s: and it's important to remember that
315.48s: because the only way then to eventually
318.08s: make that happen is by maintaining
320.96s: steady pressure on the issue which the
323.16s: GameStop Community has done a incredible
325.56s: job doing to be completely honest
327.08s: because it's been a long time and the
328.96s: same drum continues to be beat now to
331.96s: highlight one of these conflicts of
334.72s: interest we have our fan favorite which
336.84s: the purple here looks dashing but Janet
339.84s: Yellen as you guys know she was the
342.04s: Federal Reserve chair and she disclosed
344.96s: a list of more than 50 page speaking
346.68s: events this is all old news by the way
348.84s: but I want you to look at the firms that
351.00s: she's speaking at Goldman Sachs Barclays
354.92s: Citadel there's a lot of these places
357.32s: that people who are in government
358.64s: positions and I also want to bear clear
360.12s: this is for the Federal Reserve right
361.92s: like this isn't the SEC but what I'm
364.36s: highlighting is I imagine pretty much
366.60s: everybody in those kinds of government
368.76s: positions has this to deal with because
371.84s: here's the reality you have people that
374.00s: spend their entire career building up
375.96s: their their proficiency then they go
378.64s: into government she didn't make bad
380.56s: money in government but let's also be
382.40s: realistic you don't make great money in
383.92s: government most people that are going
385.36s: into government they go in to try and
387.56s: build uh Rapport they try to build
389.72s: experience a resume that then is in
391.40s: demand by the civilian corporate world
394.48s: afterwards people in the military do
395.96s: this too and the reason is because you
398.44s: spend your entire career building skills
400.48s: and then you work in a place like the
401.72s: government that doesn't fully reward
403.52s: them again I'm not saying that they get
405.04s: paid terribly but if you're looking at
407.28s: the kind of caliber of people that are
408.76s: rising to these roles that are
409.84s: exceedingly smart these are the kind of
411.52s: peoples that would be making a killing
413.72s: in the civilian world so they're in
416.28s: these positions and then they're making
419.64s: decisions based on what they are trying
421.96s: to do but then they're also making
423.92s: decisions based on understanding that
425.76s: this is part of their game plan the fact
428.20s: that they're going to say I'm going to
429.64s: go work in government for a bit I'm not
431.96s: going to make what I'm worth at this
433.64s: point but I can supplement that by going
436.40s: doing speaking engagements at Goldman
438.32s: Sachs barlay Citadel and so on and so
440.12s: forth so then I can supplement
443.16s: essentially what I'm trying to make this
445.00s: is the conflict of interest because if
447.60s: I'm the Federal Reserve chair and again
450.00s: I'm not getting paid what I think I'm
451.48s: worth and I can go speak to Citadel and
455.12s: make
455.80s: $292,500 from a single speech that's a
460.48s: lot of money so unless you come across
463.64s: people who are completely impervious to
465.48s: money which most of us aren't let's keep
467.16s: it real if a lot of us were in the same
469.64s: scenario it would be a tough tradeoff
472.44s: and who knows what decisions we all
474.04s: would make we don't know we're not in
475.16s: the position so I'm not sitting here
477.72s: judging her or anybody else directly I'm
480.96s: simply talking about the facts and the
482.68s: reality as it is the fact is this being
486.28s: part of this absolutely would create a
488.44s: conflict of interest because then when
489.84s: you're in these kinds of positions the
491.76s: things you do are slightly slightly
494.76s: integrated thinking of what impact might
497.72s: it have on my ability to do do to do
500.28s: these things for these kinds of
502.20s: people so the takeaway here is that not
508.24s: that the system is so full corrupt and
510.24s: nothing can be done right that is that
512.64s: getting to that level of dismay is
514.20s: always sad because then it's essentially
516.56s: it's just throwing our hands up and
517.76s: quitting and I don't really believe in
519.56s: that but there is a reality that this
521.76s: kind of thing is going to take a while
523.24s: and it's going to continue taking a
524.56s: while now reg show just got an update
526.12s: that's actually kind of cool that's
527.52s: going to start requiring funds that are
529.84s: over I think it was $100 million I
532.64s: forgot the exact amount to start
534.40s: reporting their shorts so things like
537.04s: that I think are good it's slow and it's
540.00s: a function of a coalesence of getting
542.12s: the right people in the place that
544.20s: aren't fully motivated by the potential
546.72s: money they can make in the speeches
548.00s: after and actually trying to make a
549.40s: meaningful change so all of that came
552.96s: really to the Forefront of this whole
554.68s: thing so that stuff
557.52s: aside we have now the rest of the DD
560.44s: library to go through which I'm really
562.32s: really stoked to do but there's so much
566.08s: more to explore because the story
568.00s: continues to unfold one of the things is
570.60s: the change for Cohen shares from RC
574.00s: Ventures to his personal name and we
576.40s: spent a while hypothesizing about that
578.88s: we even recruited chat GPT to help us
580.92s: war game and think of different
582.28s: scenarios why this might happen why this
584.00s: might make sense so there's a lot to
586.20s: unravel here and it continues to be
587.80s: interesting to me so all of that aside I
590.80s: want to take a quick look at GameStop
592.56s: where we sit today because I do think
594.08s: we're at a very important level and I
595.64s: mentioned this a couple times so when we
598.12s: see stocks down Trend like this and when
601.28s: we see them breaking out of the
603.20s: downtrends like this here this initial
605.56s: downtrend that you can see drawn it's
607.88s: really important what it does in this
609.88s: next section and unfortunately a lot of
612.76s: this coales with the Tariff conversation
615.60s: that was happening on Friday then the
617.40s: subsequent gap down that happened on the
619.72s: 3 so right now GameStop seems to be
623.56s: following a lot of the broader Market
625.60s: beta but we are now at what I consider
628.68s: to be a a essentially critical level the
631.68s: reason why I think this 20 A2 25 A2
634.44s: level is so critical is because below
637.68s: this there has been very few
639.28s: transactions that means not a lot of
641.20s: people are transacting in GameStop at
643.16s: these prices until you get all the way
644.68s: down here to
646.40s: 2226 so for me I also remember have that
650.52s: covered strangle position it's an
651.88s: options trade that I've been sharing
653.64s: with you in GameStop so this also
656.68s: matters to me because again I'm I'm a
658.68s: Trader
659.76s: so I already told you I unwind some of
662.52s: the shares not too long ago and the
665.16s: reason for unwinding some of the shares
667.84s: was because for a Trader lens I can't
671.80s: make money Holding stock if it's going
673.80s: down that's one of the big things right
676.72s: and I know that that's like well yeah no
679.20s: no Sherlock but the reason why that
681.84s: matters is because it informs short-term
685.04s: positioning so for me if we start to see
687.92s: meaningful breaking down below this
689.88s: level I probably will lighten up even
692.20s: more shares and continue to trade it via
695.20s: cash secured puts to take advantage of
696.96s: the downside volatility the volatility
699.16s: in here has been absolutely massive take
700.88s: a look at the yellow line here and take
702.84s: a look at the Gap that you see between
704.84s: the yellow line and the gry line that's
706.56s: representing historic variant R premiums
708.80s: which are still very significant so I
712.32s: took a stroll through the options chain
715.24s: as per usual to see if anything stuck
717.60s: out to me so the first thing we can take
719.56s: a look at together is literally just to
722.44s: see what the overall tenor is of
726.08s: movement and it's lightening up
729.24s: everything that I see here is very very
731.24s: much lightening up so what I mean by
733.84s: that is if you take a look at the
736.12s: overall call volume and put
739.48s: volume it's been contracting since
743.04s: essentially the end of last week there
745.12s: was a slight uptick and then it rolled
747.80s: back over so really really light overall
751.40s: trading activity that we see in GameStop
754.12s: from an options perspective I didn't see
756.80s: any big trades coming through that
759.60s: really stuck out to me that you know
761.72s: like hey these are big massive trades
763.80s: there's really nothing like that that's
767.44s: catching my eye if we sort this by
769.08s: premium over the last week the biggest
770.48s: trade is 436,000 and that's on uh the
773.64s: call side which is good but yeah just
775.44s: really really light now if we take a
777.96s: look at the options chain itself
779.72s: we can still see it's maintaining heavy
781.72s: call skew over the put side and that
783.88s: continues to be an important data point
786.44s: because I monitor the relationship
788.28s: between here which has been about steady
790.40s: tons of calls traded today against the
792.64s: puts so the activity on a daily basis
794.92s: still continues to be very very call
798.36s: heavy and it's not people just buying or
801.64s: selling it's kind of like split right
803.96s: because you can see 32% of the volume
806.04s: today was at the bidder below and 33%
808.20s: was at the offer or above so these are
810.40s: people kind of doing both things selling
812.60s: calls buying calls it's it's kind of a
814.40s: split volatility on a relative basis is
817.96s: super low it's not even above 80
820.80s: anywhere in these front Cycles which is
822.88s: nuts normally this maintains over a 100%
825.64s: Vol so volatility is very quiet so that
828.88s: tells me from an expectation standpoint
831.28s: it is looking like a pretty quiet period
833.68s: in front of us so that's stuff aside you
836.64s: know I'm still going to keep doing the
837.80s: updates keeping an eye on it as always
839.68s: if you have any questions anything you
841.00s: want me to take a look at let me know be
842.72s: an outlier I'll see you later
