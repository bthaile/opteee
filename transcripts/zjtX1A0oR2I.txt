0.00s:  What up, apes, Eric here.
2.42s:  I want to talk about options.
4.44s:  I come in peace.
5.44s:  I know for a long time options were kind of a weird thing in the GameStop community and
10.64s:  also for other meme stocks like AMC and other stuff.
13.76s:  And no, I don't mean meme stocks in a bad way.
16.24s:  We've had a long conversation about that.
17.80s:  It just means popular stuff.
19.80s:  So there are times things like Tesla or a meme stock.
23.64s:  So I want to talk in a very practical sense about a strategy that I think is applicable
29.92s:  to a lot of people in here that might work really, really well for a lot of folks.
36.32s:  And a few notes here, not here to convince you of anything.
39.40s:  You are the only person that can do whatever is right for you.
43.58s:  But I do like sharing information and I want to help you add another tool to the toolkit.
49.00s:  So I've been trading options for 17 years now.
52.56s:  They are a big part of my life.
54.24s:  I genuinely believe there are a way to really accelerate creating wealth because it has
59.88s:  absolutely changed my trajectory.
62.60s:  But they're also really tricky.
64.72s:  Now for the sake of this video though, I am not going to get bogged down in pretty much
69.32s:  any details.
70.32s:  I'm going to talk from a pure practical sense about the strategy as I would run it so that
77.20s:  you have an understanding from a pure practical application.
80.68s:  There are going to be things that I'm going to say that are very specific.
83.68s:  There's a reason why it is what it is.
86.84s:  But I'm not going to go through the explanation for all of them because otherwise the video
90.48s:  becomes very long and overwhelming to people.
93.20s:  All that being said, if you have questions asked and I'm happy to explain why things are
97.92s:  the way they are, I just don't want to overwhelm people.
100.76s:  So we're not going to go through options 101.
102.88s:  We're not going to go through what calls are, what puts are.
105.44s:  All that stuff is available in my options 101 playlist.
108.28s:  You can learn the basics there.
110.12s:  This video is picking up from the sense that you have a general idea what an option is.
116.12s:  And now you are looking to employ something in GameStop because it really is very, very
125.40s:  applicable.
126.40s:  And why is something like the strategy I'm going to talk about so applicable here?
130.28s:  Well, it's because of two reasons.
132.16s:  One, volatility and two, realize the volatility.
136.44s:  That means because GameStop moves so much, it has high implied volatility.
143.72s:  There are certain things that that benefits.
146.08s:  Specifically, in this case, we're going to be talking about selling calls.
150.52s:  And the other thing is realize volatility moves a lot.
153.76s:  This means that you can kind of have your cake and eat it too.
158.40s:  How so?
159.40s:  Well, let's start with an example.
161.44s:  The strategy that I'm going to cover is called a ratio covered call.
166.84s:  And I have videos on the channel that goes into it in depth.
169.56s:  You can check those out if you're interested.
171.40s:  But again, high level.
173.36s:  Ratio covered call takes the elements of a covered call and fixes what I consider to be
179.52s:  the weaknesses.
181.00s:  And let's take a look first at a covered call.
186.12s:  Let's say that over the past three years, you've been buying into GameStop.
192.76s:  Sometimes you buy it when it's up here at 24.
195.12s:  You got a bunch of it when it's down here at 13.
197.36s:  You've been scooping up a little bit.
199.28s:  I don't know what the average GameStop holding is in terms of number of shares.
203.28s:  So I'm picking something that I would consider to be probably realistic for people.
208.20s:  And what I'm modeling is we have 500 shares at a basis of 2139.
212.96s:  And this is using a pass through IRA accounts where everything's cash secured here.
217.48s:  And you can see it takes about $14,000.
219.56s:  So that's the position that I'm using as the base.
221.60s:  That's the long equity part of the trade.
223.40s:  Long shares.
224.40s:  Lots of GameStop folks.
226.48s:  Very familiar with that.
227.72s:  Cool.
228.72s:  Now a covered call.
231.00s:  Typically a lures people because you have the ability to collect a credit up front.
236.44s:  We're selling an option.
238.28s:  When you sell an option, you collect a premium.
241.00s:  And remember that options work in 100 lot contracts.
244.96s:  So when you see five here, this actually represents up to 500 shares.
250.52s:  And when you see $1.87, this really is $187.
256.44s:  So you have the ability to sell this call.
260.32s:  Have $187 times five.
264.64s:  Hit your account up front.
266.52s:  So that means if GameStop doesn't move at all, you essentially make this money.
270.60s:  So how do you make this money from the passage of time?
274.40s:  Short options benefit from price moving in their favor, from time decaying away and volatility
283.16s:  contracting.
284.16s:  Those are the main things that are going to help you.
286.12s:  Does have a slight interest rate input, but that's not overly applicable.
290.32s:  So I'm not going to run down that rabbit hole.
293.32s:  So a standard covered call is where you sell one lot against each 100 shares you have
301.92s:  at a one to one ratio.
304.36s:  So what that means is if we have 500 shares, we would sell five calls against those shares.
310.64s:  And notice what this does to your PNL.
313.44s:  What you're looking at here is called a risk profile.
315.64s:  It plots the return profile for a series of positions, legs.
322.16s:  You can combine different stuff in here.
324.48s:  So if we look at just the long stock, notice how it's essentially just a standard positive
329.28s:  slope and it's a one to one ratio.
331.64s:  Each dollar GameStop goes up.
333.16s:  You make a buck pretty clear.
335.60s:  And this line here is the zero line.
337.64s:  This is your break even.
338.68s:  So this is where you actually break even at whatever our basis is 2139 and you'll notice
344.28s:  that what we're trading right now, obviously is a premium to that because GameStop is
347.92s:  as of today is like 2744.
350.04s:  So you're making some money in this hypothetical scenario.
353.12s:  Now if we get rid of the shares and just look at a short call, this is what it looks
357.44s:  like.
358.44s:  Notice how as the stock goes up, short calls have unlimited risk to the upside.
365.44s:  And notice how as the stock goes down, short calls make money.
369.52s:  And they have a maximum profit potential.
373.68s:  This is because your profit is going to be relegated to whatever the credit you receive
378.36s:  is upfront.
379.36s:  In this case, you'd get 935 bucks on five of the 42 calls.
384.76s:  So what is the 42 mean?
386.44s:  That's simply your strike price.
388.48s:  So if we zoom this in now, so you can see more clearly, you'll notice that 42, there's
393.00s:  a kink in the line.
394.68s:  Why does that happen?
395.68s:  Well, it's because up until your strike price, your options do not have enough short
402.16s:  deltas to slow down the profit for your long shares.
405.56s:  Because remember, in the beginning, this does not represent negative 500 deltas.
412.48s:  If you look over here on this column, where it actually shows you deltas, one long share
416.76s:  equals one delta.
418.20s:  They're called delta one products because they're always one delta.
421.80s:  They don't change.
423.36s:  Then for options, they have a specific delta.
427.76s:  So if we go to an options chain, and you notice that we go 45 days out in this example,
433.06s:  and you look at the 42, it's a 28 delta 0.28.
437.48s:  Again, options, you have to multiply it by 100.
440.52s:  So it's 28 delta.
442.20s:  So this means at the time of selling, you're for each one lot, you're getting 28 short
449.60s:  deltas, not 528.
453.88s:  Then you'll notice that is the options go further and further and further in the money,
458.08s:  meaning in this case, the underlying goes up, your deltas get jacked up and they go higher
462.48s:  and higher and higher.
464.04s:  So what ends up happening is in the beginning, if we move these down to 100 shares, just
469.64s:  to make it very, very simple, you have 100 shares, a total of 100 long deltas.
475.00s:  At the beginning, you're short 28 deltas.
478.84s:  You can see that down here, 28 deltas.
481.52s:  So then as GameStop goes up, as we all hope it does, as it gets past your short strike,
488.40s:  what ends up happening past your short strike is your deltas from the longs are canceled
495.00s:  out by the deltas from your shorts.
496.92s:  It's at a 1 to 1.
498.32s:  So you will then have negative 100 deltas here, 100 deltas here.
502.28s:  They cancel each other out.
503.36s:  You are now at max profit.
505.52s:  This is the big problem with covered calls.
510.40s:  You're carrying unlimited downside risk, meaning you take the risk all the way down to
515.32s:  zero, but you now have capped upside profit potential.
519.88s:  So how do we fix this?
521.56s:  Enter a ratio covered call.
524.80s:  Notice how we have 500 long shares against five short calls.
530.12s:  If we take this down just one, notice how we have 500 shares still in our short four
536.52s:  calls.
537.72s:  Notice what happened to this kink.
539.44s:  It changed from being flat to now upward sloping.
543.80s:  Now you might be asking what's the difference between the blue line, the purple line.
547.12s:  The blue line shows us at expiration.
549.60s:  The purple line shows us today.
551.44s:  Why is there a difference?
552.88s:  Because options expire over time.
555.60s:  That's what this value in here is.
558.12s:  Funny enough, when you sell an option, this is the value you capture.
563.68s:  That's why you're selling it.
565.20s:  You earn a little bit of this each time.
569.04s:  Time passes.
570.92s:  There's also some other inputs.
573.12s:  If volatility contracts, that decreases premiums, that would help you.
578.20s:  The passage of time itself, theta is linear.
582.20s:  That you'll get each day no matter what.
584.44s:  And then the extrinsic value split into two parts.
587.72s:  There's theta, the actual time, and then there's volatility.
591.72s:  So those two components essentially equal this space here.
596.52s:  So now, notice how by changing this ratio so that we have more long deltas or more long
602.96s:  shares, then the total maximum short shares we would have, we now have upside profit potential.
609.00s:  What this really means is you can be short up to 400 shares, but you're long 500.
616.00s:  So that means you have 100 shares that are uncapped.
619.48s:  So then the next question typically is, well, how many do you sell?
624.92s:  Whatever you want.
626.44s:  As long as it's less than one to one, you will have upside.
630.72s:  And it's a reflection of your expectations of price movement.
634.12s:  So let's take a look at an example.
636.80s:  Let's say that we think GameStop is going to go to 40.
641.04s:  And I'll throw 40 down here.
643.64s:  We can see that's your 40 line.
646.56s:  Today, if it goes to 40 and you have, let's do the five lots to start, if it goes to 40
654.76s:  and you have your five lots, today it would be worth about 6500 bucks at expiration.
659.60s:  It'd be worth 10,000 to 15.
662.20s:  Cool.
663.36s:  Now let's change this and say maybe you did three at the same price level today.
671.04s:  You would have 7600 bucks at expiration.
674.52s:  You would have 9,926 bucks.
678.20s:  What do you notice as I cite those numbers?
680.88s:  Well, you notice that you actually make more money in this scenario by having more short
686.12s:  calls out.
687.60s:  And it's because you're collecting more of a premium upfront.
691.92s:  But what ends up happening eventually is if we get a big enough move, let's say that
697.84s:  instead of 40, it runs to 60.
701.48s:  Let's take a look at the scenario now.
703.52s:  Those five short calls along with your shares would lead to a profit today of 9300 bucks.
710.20s:  At expiration, it would be 11,240.
713.24s:  If again, we change this down so that it's three at that same level.
717.40s:  Now you make 13,303 today, 14,460 at expiration.
722.60s:  You see the difference.
724.36s:  So essentially, depending on where this short strike is, if price lands within that short
731.76s:  strike, you would typically do better with more short calls.
736.22s:  As price moves beyond the short strike, then you do better with less short calls.
741.92s:  So it really comes down to your preference.
743.92s:  The way I think about it is the more short calls I sell upfront, the more money I collect
748.72s:  upfront.
749.72s:  If there's little or no movement or even a little bit of down movement.
753.36s:  The other scenario occurs and I think that there's going to be a really big price movement.
757.84s:  Then maybe I take fewer short calls, still collect some money upfront in case it goes down
763.60s:  or sideways or what I think doesn't happen.
765.96s:  But I'm not sacrificing a ton of upside potential.
769.56s:  So the other thing I want to highlight is an artifact of GameStop's movements that I've
774.12s:  noticed after studying it for some time.
777.16s:  One of the big things is notice how it's very picky.
781.88s:  And it has these really big price movements.
784.76s:  They tend to shoot up for a few days and then come back down.
787.32s:  Shoot up for a few days, come back down.
789.12s:  Now this recent movement is very different.
791.24s:  It's been quite sustained.
792.88s:  But there are ways that you can manage your short call position so that if you choose to
801.24s:  sell at a higher ratio, let's say four contracts against your 500 shares and it starts to shoot
806.72s:  up that you don't necessarily have to get out.
809.72s:  You don't have to necessarily lose your shares.
812.32s:  You are an important note, always at risk of early assignment, although very low probability.
819.88s:  The probability of early assignment is very low and there are things we can do to manage
823.36s:  it.
824.36s:  So we can talk a little bit more about that in a future video if you want the actual management
829.48s:  of the strategy, different techniques you can use.
832.08s:  But the main thing I want to introduce you to is this idea of a covered call to collect
836.64s:  some premium in something that has high volatility that has long periods like every other
841.28s:  stock where it trends sideways, you can benefit from that long volatility against the long
845.58s:  shares that you hold.
846.58s:  Anyway, it doesn't take any more capital whatsoever.
849.36s:  There is a risk of early assignment, albeit very low and there are things you can do
853.28s:  about it.
854.60s:  And if you experience these big price movements and your short calls start to show a loss
860.60s:  because that's exactly what happens as the member, as the underlying goes up, you lose
865.40s:  money on the short calls.
867.04s:  But the reason why in aggregate, you make profit is because your long shares overwhelm
871.52s:  the short calls.
873.24s:  So there are some definitely caveats around what strikes you would want to sell general
878.88s:  ideas, make sure it's above whatever your basis is.
882.20s:  The further up it is, the happier you will be because the higher your max profit would
886.88s:  be.
887.88s:  But we can get into all of those details in a future video if you'd like.
891.72s:  The main thing I want you to take away from this is that you can sell options again,
895.56s:  shares.
896.56s:  If you do it at a ratio, you can preserve more of your upside.
899.52s:  Most people default to this at a one to one.
902.48s:  And then it sucks when you see game stops start to rally up to beyond 80.
907.04s:  You're there making 11,240, which is great.
910.04s:  But in the other scenario, if you had just three contracts against it at that same scenario,
914.80s:  you're making almost double at 18k and it just gets more pronounced the further up you
918.64s:  go.
919.64s:  As always, if you have any questions, let me know.
920.64s:  I'll see you in outlier.
921.64s:  I'll see you all later.
