0.00s: What up, apes, Eric here.
2.42s: I want to talk about options.
4.42s: I come in peace.
5.42s: I know for a long time options were kind of a weird thing in the GameStop community and
10.66s: also for other meme stocks like AMC and other stuff.
13.78s: And no, I don't mean meme stocks in a bad way.
16.22s: We've had a long conversation about that.
17.78s: It just means popular stuff.
19.82s: So there are times things like Tesla or a meme stock.
23.66s: So I want to talk in a very practical sense about a strategy that I think is applicable
29.92s: to a lot of people in here that might work really, really well for a lot of folks.
36.32s: And a few notes here, not here to convince you of anything.
39.40s: You are the only person that can do whatever is right for you.
43.58s: But I do like sharing information and I want to help you add another tool to the toolkit.
49.00s: So I've been trading options for 17 years now.
52.56s: They are a big part of my life.
54.24s: I genuinely believe there are a way to really accelerate creating wealth because it has
59.90s: absolutely changed my trajectory.
62.60s: But they're also really tricky.
64.72s: Now for the sake of this video though, I am not going to get bogged down in pretty much
69.32s: any details.
70.32s: I'm going to talk from a pure practical sense about the strategy as I would run it so that
77.20s: you have an understanding from a pure practical application.
80.68s: There are going to be things that I'm going to say that are very specific.
83.68s: There's a reason why it is what it is.
86.82s: But I'm not going to go through the explanation for all of them because otherwise the video
90.48s: becomes very long and overwhelming to people.
93.16s: All that being said, if you have questions asked and I'm happy to explain why things are
97.88s: the way they are, I just don't want to overwhelm people.
100.76s: So we're not going to go through options 101.
102.88s: We're not going to go through what calls are, what puts are.
105.40s: All that stuff is available in my options 101 playlist.
108.28s: You can learn the basics there.
110.12s: This video is picking up from the sense that you have a general idea what an option is.
116.12s: And now you are looking to employ something in GameStop because it really is very, very
125.40s: applicable.
126.40s: And why is something like the strategy I'm going to talk about so applicable here?
130.28s: Well, it's because of two reasons.
132.12s: One, volatility and two, realize the volatility.
136.44s: That means because GameStop moves so much, it has high implied volatility.
143.72s: There are certain things that that benefits.
146.08s: Specifically, in this case, we're going to be talking about selling calls.
150.52s: And the other thing is realize volatility moves a lot.
153.76s: This means that you can kind of have your cake and eat it too.
158.40s: How so?
159.40s: Well, let's start with an example.
161.44s: The strategy that I'm going to cover is called a ratio covered call.
166.84s: And I have videos on the channel that goes into it in depth.
169.56s: You can check those out if you're interested.
171.40s: But again, high level.
173.36s: Ratio covered call takes the elements of a covered call and fixes what I consider to be
179.52s: the weaknesses.
181.00s: And let's take a look first at a covered call.
185.12s: So let's say that over the past three years, you've been
191.36s: buying into GameStop.
192.80s: Sometimes you buy it when it's up here at 24.
195.12s: You got a bunch of it when it's down here at 13.
197.36s: You've been scooping up a little bit.
199.24s: I don't know what the average GameStop holding is in terms of number of shares.
203.28s: So I'm picking something that I would consider to be probably realistic for people.
208.20s: And what I'm modeling is we have 500 shares at a basis of 2139.
212.96s: And this is using a pass through IRA accounts where everything's cash secured here.
217.24s: And you can see it takes about $14,000.
219.56s: So that's the position that I'm using as the base.
221.60s: That's the long equity part of the trade.
223.40s: Long shares.
224.40s: Lots of GameStop folks.
226.52s: Very familiar with that.
227.68s: Cool.
228.68s: Now a covered call.
231.00s: Typically a lures people because you have the ability to collect a credit up front.
236.44s: We're selling an option when you sell an option, you collect a premium.
241.00s: And remember that options work in 100 lot contracts.
244.96s: So when you see five here, this actually represents up to 500 shares.
250.52s: And when you see $1.87, this really is $187.
256.44s: So you have the ability to sell this call, have $187 times five hit your account up front.
266.52s: So that means if GameStop doesn't move at all, you essentially make this money.
270.60s: So how do you make this money from the passage of time?
274.40s: Part options benefit from price moving in their favor, from time to king away and volatility
283.20s: contracting.
284.20s: Those are the main things that are going to help you.
286.12s: Does have a slight interest rate input, but that's not overly applicable.
290.32s: So I'm not going to run down that rabbit hole.
293.32s: So a standard covered call is where you sell one lot against each 100 shares you have
301.92s: at a one to one ratio.
304.36s: And what that means is if we have 500 shares, we would sell five calls against those shares.
310.68s: And notice what this does to your PNL, what you're looking at here is called a risk profile.
315.64s: It plots the return profile for a series of positions, legs, you can combine different
323.04s: stuff in here.
324.48s: So if we look at just the long stock, notice how it's essentially just a standard positive
329.32s: slope.
330.32s: And it's a one to one ratio.
331.68s: Each dollar GameStop goes up.
333.16s: You make a buck.
334.16s: Very clear.
335.60s: And this line here is the zero line.
337.64s: This is your break even.
338.68s: So this is where you actually break even at whatever our basis is 21 39 and you'll notice
344.32s: that what we're trading right now, obviously is a premium to that because GameStop as of
348.04s: today is like 2744.
349.04s: So you're making some money in this hypothetical scenario.
353.12s: Now if we get rid of the shares and just look at a short call, this is what it looks like.
358.52s: Notice how as the stock goes up, short calls have unlimited risk to the upside.
365.44s: And notice how as the stock goes down, short calls make money and they have a maximum profit
372.00s: potential.
373.68s: This is because your profit is going to be relegated to whatever the credit you receive
378.40s: is upfront.
379.40s: In this case, you'd get 935 bucks on five of the 42 calls.
384.76s: So what is the 42 mean?
386.44s: That's simply your strike price.
388.48s: So if we zoom this in now, so you can see more clearly, you'll notice that 42, there's
393.00s: a kink in the line.
394.68s: Why does that happen?
395.68s: Well, it's because up until your strike price, your options do not have enough short
402.16s: deltas to slow down the profit for your long shares.
405.64s: Because remember, in the beginning, this does not represent negative 500 delta.
412.48s: If you look over here on this column, where it actually shows you delta's one long share
416.80s: equals one delta, they're called delta one products because they're always one delta.
421.84s: They don't change.
423.32s: Then for options, they have a specific delta.
427.76s: So if we go to an options chain, and you notice that we go 45 days out in this example,
433.08s: and you look at the 42, it's a 28 delta 0.28.
437.76s: Again, options, you have to multiply it by 100.
440.52s: So it's 28 delta.
442.20s: So this means at the time of selling, you're for each one lot, you're getting 28 short
449.56s: deltas, not 528.
454.20s: Then you'll notice that is the options go further and further and further in the money,
458.16s: meaning in this case, the underlying goes up, your delta's get jacked up and they go higher
462.52s: and higher and higher.
464.08s: So what ends up happening is in the beginning, if we move these down to 100 shares, just
469.68s: to make it very, very simple.
471.44s: We have 100 shares, a total of 100 long delta's.
475.00s: At the beginning, you're short 28 delta's, right?
478.84s: You can see that down here, 28 delta's.
481.52s: So then as GameStop goes up, as we all hope it does, as it gets past your short strike,
488.40s: what ends up happening past your short strike is your delta's from the longs are canceled
494.96s: out by the delta's from your shorts, that a one to one.
498.32s: So you will then have negative 100 delta's here, 100 delta's here.
502.28s: They cancel each other out.
503.36s: You are now at max profit.
505.52s: This is the big problem with covered calls.
510.40s: You're carrying unlimited downside risk, meaning you take the risk all the way down
515.24s: to zero, but you now have capped upside profit potential.
519.88s: So how do we fix this?
521.52s: Enter a ratio covered call.
524.80s: Notice how we have 500 long shares against five short calls.
530.12s: If we take this down just one, notice how we have 500 shares still in our short four
536.52s: calls.
537.72s: Notice what happened to this kink.
539.44s: It changed from being flat to now upward sloping.
543.80s: Now you might be asking what's the difference between the blue line, the purple line.
547.12s: The blue line shows us at expiration.
549.60s: The purple line shows us today.
551.44s: Why is there a difference?
552.88s: Because options expire over time.
555.60s: That's what this value in here is.
558.12s: Funny enough, when you sell an option, this is the value you capture.
563.68s: That's why you're selling it.
565.20s: You earn a little bit of this each time time passes.
570.92s: There's also some other inputs.
573.08s: If volatility contracts that decreases premiums, that would help you.
578.20s: The passage of time itself, theta is linear that you'll get each day no matter what.
584.48s: Then the extrinsic value split into two parts.
587.72s: There's theta, the actual time, and then there's volatility.
592.04s: Those two components essentially equal this space here.
596.56s: So now, notice how by changing this ratio so that we have more long deltas or more long
602.96s: shares, then the total maximum short shares we would have.
607.00s: We now have upside profit potential.
609.04s: What this really means is you can be short up to 400 shares, but you're long 500.
616.00s: So that means you have 100 shares that are uncapped.
619.24s: So then the next question typically is, well, how many do you sell?
624.96s: Whatever you want.
626.48s: As long as it's less than one to one, you will have upside.
630.96s: It's a reflection of your expectations of price movement.
634.24s: Let's take a look at an example.
636.88s: Let's say that we think GameStop is going to go to 40 and I'll throw 40 down here.
643.68s: We can see that's your 40 line.
646.60s: Today, if it goes to 40 and you have, let's do the five lots to start, if it goes to 40
654.80s: and you have your five lots, today it would be worth about 6,500 bucks at expiration.
659.60s: It'd be worth 10,000 to 15.
662.12s: Cool.
663.36s: Now let's change this and say maybe you did three at the same price level today.
671.04s: You would have 7,600 bucks at expiration.
674.52s: You would have 9,926 bucks.
678.24s: What do you notice as I cite those numbers?
680.88s: Well, you notice that you actually make more money in this scenario by having more short
686.16s: calls out.
687.60s: And it's because you're collecting more of a premium upfront.
691.92s: But what ends up happening eventually is if we get a big enough move, let's say that
697.84s: instead of 40, it runs to 60.
701.48s: Let's take a look at the scenario now.
703.52s: Those five short calls along with your shares would lead to a profit today of 9,300
709.48s: bucks at expiration.
711.00s: It would be 11,240.
713.24s: If again, we change this down so that it's three at that same level.
717.40s: Now you make 13,303 today, 14,460 at expiration.
722.60s: You see the difference.
724.32s: So essentially, depending on where this short strike is, if price lands within that short
731.76s: strike, you would typically do better with more short calls.
736.20s: As price moves beyond the short strike, then you do better with less short calls so
741.96s: it really comes down to your preference.
743.88s: The way I think about it is the more short calls I sell upfront, the more money I collect
748.72s: upfront if there's little or no movement or even a little bit of down movement.
753.00s: If the other scenario occurs, and I think that there's going to be a really big price
756.80s: movement, then maybe I take you were short calls, still collect some money upfront in case
763.04s: it goes down or sideways or what I think doesn't happen, but I'm not sacrificing a ton
767.60s: of upside potential.
769.56s: So the other thing I want to highlight is an artifact of GameStop's movements that I've
774.16s: noticed after studying it for some time.
777.16s: One of the big things is notice how it's very peaky.
781.88s: When it has these really big price movements, they tend to shoot up for a few days and
786.48s: then come back down.
787.48s: Shoot up for a few days, come back down.
789.12s: Now this recent movement is very different.
791.24s: It's been quite sustained.
793.88s: But there are ways that you can manage your short call position so that if you choose
801.08s: to sell at a higher ratio, let's say for contracts against your 500 shares and it starts to
806.44s: shoot up that you don't necessarily have to get out.
809.68s: You don't have to necessarily lose your shares.
812.28s: You are an important note, always at risk of early assignment, although very low probability.
819.88s: The probability of early assignment is very low.
821.88s: And there are things we can do to manage it.
824.36s: So we can talk a little bit more about that in a future video if you want the actual management
829.48s: of the strategy, different techniques you can use.
832.08s: But the main thing I want to introduce you to is this idea of a covered call to collect
836.64s: some premium in something that has high volatility that has long periods like every other
841.28s: stock where it trends sideways.
843.16s: You can benefit from that long volatility against the long shares that you hold anyway.
847.00s: It doesn't take any more capital whatsoever.
849.36s: There is a risk of early assignment, albeit very low and there are things you can do about
853.60s: it.
854.60s: And if you experience these big price movements and your short calls start to show a loss
860.44s: because that's exactly what happens as the member as the underlying goes up, you lose
865.40s: money on the short calls.
867.04s: But the reason why in aggregate, you make profit is because your long shares overwhelm
871.52s: the short calls.
873.24s: So there are some definitely caveats around what strikes you would want to sell general
879.36s: ideas, make sure it's above whatever your basis is, the further up it is, the happier
884.16s: you will be because the higher your max profit would be.
887.84s: But we can get into all of those details in a future video if you'd like.
891.72s: The main thing I want you to take away from this is that you can sell options again shares.
896.24s: If you do it at a ratio, you can preserve more of your upside.
899.52s: Those people default to this at a one to one.
902.48s: And then it sucks when you see game stops start to rally up to beyond 80.
907.04s: You're there making 11,040, which is great.
910.04s: But in the other scenario, if you had just three contracts against it at that same scenario,
914.80s: you're making almost double at 18k and it just gets more pronounced the further up you
918.64s: go.
919.64s: As always, if you have any questions, let me know being outlier.
920.64s: I'll see you all later.
