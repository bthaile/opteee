0.00s: Today I want to talk about how you can create a zero DTE SPX option strategy that actually
7.12s: makes money.
8.12s: We're going to look at a couple examples up front of two sides of the same coin, very different
12.72s: experiences.
13.88s: And then we're going to go through some data and at the end of the video, I want to walk
16.88s: you through some very specific tips and tricks.
20.20s: So what's up everybody?
21.20s: Welcome back to all the L.I.R.
22.48s: shout out to the Patreon family.
24.32s: Thank you guys for the support you make content like this possible.
27.56s: And if what I do helps you in any way, consider signing up.
31.24s: It helps me out a bunch link in the notes below.
35.36s: Ah, yes.
36.96s: Two sides of the same exact zero DTE coin on the left hand side.
43.76s: We have 18 year old meets zero DTE spy puts.
49.56s: And in a single day, they grew their account, 124.3%.
56.92s: That looks pretty good to me.
58.88s: Then we have, well, the other side zero DTE lotto trades gone wrong.
64.80s: Not sure how I'm going to recover from this.
67.16s: And for this person over it looks like I've no idea what the time frame for is for this.
73.20s: It's obviously not within a day.
75.36s: It says all time and they're down $82,200 dollars and a nickel, which is essentially 100%
83.28s: of their account.
84.32s: All right.
85.32s: All right.
86.32s: Two very different experiences.
89.88s: What's going on here?
90.88s: Well, I'm going to give you some quick excerpts from a recent video I did that really
95.64s: dives deep into the world of zero DTE options.
99.68s: And if you want to check that video out, I'll throw a link to that in the notes below.
103.64s: It's really good context.
104.96s: This video is going to dive way more into actually analyzing individual strategies.
109.04s: So slight different scope.
110.56s: But what I want to show you three things quickly left hand side, this essentially just means
115.40s: zero DTE volume is increasing exponentially.
118.88s: This here shows you the average P and L profitability of zero DTE's small traders, meaning mostly
125.28s: retail.
126.44s: And essentially there was a period where we were doing well.
129.76s: That starts kind of in December of 21, definitely through 2022.
135.04s: And then since then it's turned negative.
137.52s: There's net and gross.
138.84s: That means gross is obviously the upfront returns.
142.68s: And then net is once we induce friction, commission, slippage zone and so forth.
147.44s: All I'm highlighting here is that slippage is a big deal cost is a big deal.
151.32s: Then down here we have a quick summary of the profitability of zero DTE trades.
155.60s: And essentially it says we document that retail traders consistently lose money, especially
160.24s: after transaction costs, which is what I just showed you up here.
163.04s: While they correctly incorporate the overall level of expensiveness of zero DTE options and
168.12s: their decision to buy or sell, they fail to outperform the hefty spreads.
172.32s: What people don't realize is that it's actually very expensive for us to trade these.
175.80s: And it's because you are confused by the zero dollar commissions you think you see up front
181.44s: when really you're paying for all of that on the back end, which again, the zero DTE option
186.08s: video that I have goes through that in detail.
188.04s: So what I want to walk through now though is actually a strategy comparison.
192.56s: So I am affiliated with my friends over at Options Omega because I think that they
197.40s: really give a decent platform for somebody that doesn't want to manage their own data
202.08s: to take a look at options.
203.16s: They didn't sponsor this video outright.
204.88s: I'm literally just doing it because I like to tinker with their tool from once in a while.
208.20s: However, I do have a discount code for it.
210.56s: If you want to sign up, there's a link in the notes below for that as well.
214.96s: But to make this a little more easily consumable as compared to showing you a bunch of these
219.36s: individual kind of screenshots, I'm going to show you kind of some synopsis data that I
225.08s: threw into a Google sheet.
227.04s: So what we're looking at is a $100,000 perspective portfolio.
231.48s: We're doing one lots in SPX and we're doing short.
235.60s: There shouldn't be strangle actually.
236.76s: This should be straddle.
237.60s: That's the wrong word.
238.56s: We're doing short straddles.
240.16s: So 50 delta call 50 delta put and this top analysis is looking from one Jan 2021 to 19
246.80s: aug 2023.
248.44s: However, we have a second analysis that has even better results than this one.
254.32s: And I want to talk to you about why that is.
256.08s: But first, let's take a look at our initial results.
259.44s: So the, well, that just got rid of everything.
261.64s: I didn't look at nothing.
262.40s: Did it?
262.92s: Yes, it did.
264.12s: So the very top line you see here is the entry time.
267.00s: These are all zero DTE and we have profit loss management.
270.80s: This is where we're expecting to manage the trade and then we have different trade metrics
274.56s: over here.
275.56s: Now, the very top line here is simply expiration.
279.00s: This means we're not applying any profit or loss management.
282.24s: We're putting on the trade, letting it expire.
284.44s: The PNL of that is negative $46,000 again from 2021 to 2023.
292.04s: The compound annual growth rate negative 21%.
294.60s: You kind of get through the rest of the detail on yourself.
296.92s: But a couple of things that we really want to key into obviously PNL, Kagger drawdown,
302.08s: win rate is less important, which you'll kind of find out in a little bit.
305.24s: But we definitely like average PNL.
307.64s: So not doing anything clearly was not successful over this timeframe.
312.48s: Okay.
313.48s: Then I started isolating looking at the profit side or the loss side or a combination
319.28s: thereof.
320.28s: We managed at 25% 50% and 75% max profit.
325.44s: These are your results.
326.60s: And you'll notice that the only profitable outcome here was managing profits at 25% again
332.36s: that's leaving losses to their own devices, letting them run wherever they're going to
336.56s: be.
337.56s: This is an important note that will carry over as we move into the next segment of data,
343.16s: which is now looking at the loss side.
345.56s: So in these next couple scenarios, we're leaving the profits to their own, meaning we're
351.40s: not managing those, but we were managing at 25, 50 and 75% max profit.
358.12s: And you can see here that if we're managing losses at 25% max loss, that that actually
364.04s: was the best overall PNL for this scenario up top here.
369.96s: And we saw a 14% caguar in 18.9% draw down max a 34% or I'm sorry, 37.8% win rate.
380.60s: So overall pretty insignificant win rate.
383.32s: And this means we're taking a lot of small losing trades.
387.40s: So the average PNL, although it's positive, it's not super impressive here, but the average
392.40s: wins are given room to run.
394.12s: The losses are managed pretty carefully.
396.64s: Then I want to show you this next bucket, 25% managed at profit, 25% managed at loss.
403.32s: Essentially, what I did to test this is I just took the best of both scenarios.
407.48s: I said, OK, 25% max profit did the best on the profit side, 25% max loss did the best
414.92s: on loss side.
416.08s: How does this do?
417.16s: And arguably this looks pretty good compared to the rest, although our PNL is slightly
422.80s: less as well as our caguar, our max draw down is much less.
426.84s: This serves as a jump point for other analysis, which I'll get into in just a little bit
432.68s: on how we can think about this information.
435.28s: But before that, if any of this shocks you, let me know in the comments below because
440.64s: there's actually a couple of things here that did surprise me genuinely.
444.00s: And one of which is I was surprised that letting the profits run more actually hurt us so
450.40s: bad.
451.40s: Which it's also important to take into account the market conditions that we were seeing in
455.00s: 2021 to 2023, but still nonetheless, volatility is kind of an important input here.
460.80s: And as you could tell, I'm obviously doing this video shirtless.
463.76s: So my zero DTE trades are forcing me to start an only fans page, which that's not going
468.84s: well either.
469.84s: So I have to figure out my next thing.
471.28s: Maybe the Wendy's dumpster with all the other Wall Street bets to generates is on my
474.88s: to do list.
475.88s: However, the main point here is this overall didn't perform as well as I thought it would.
481.04s: I really thought that this would have worked better as a typical strategy here.
485.72s: And the last thing I want to show you in this bucket is this, which is just managing
489.92s: it one hour.
491.16s: So I just picked a random timeframe as compared to any sort of percent PNL.
496.12s: And that did not do super well.
497.92s: So there's a bunch of reasons why this is the case.
500.68s: And there's actually some really interesting further analysis that I'm going to overlay
505.64s: on this.
506.64s: If you guys are interested, if the video gets enough likes, then I will
510.96s: happily continue to build this out with more and more data, specifically using the options
516.00s: Omega stuff, because you guys can replicate that.
519.28s: You got me.
521.36s: But some of this aligns neatly with my own data set, but I like also integrating some of
527.72s: these random stuff that I actually don't use on my data set like our management.
531.84s: But there was nothing too noteworthy here.
534.60s: Now what I want to take a look at though is kind of this next bucket instead of going
539.36s: from one Jan 2021 to 19, August 2023.
543.08s: This looks at 13 May 2022 to 19, August 2023.
547.40s: What's the difference here?
548.56s: This is actually when daily explorations and SPX were launched.
553.36s: Well, actually technically it was the 11th of May, but I did the 13th just to give it a
558.24s: couple days for the liquidity to find itself.
560.84s: And notice how much better the performance of nearly all of these buckets are, even though
567.52s: some of these have lower PNLs, look at the max draw downs in comparison.
573.00s: If I take a look at the same exact top line trade here where we just put on the short
578.08s: straddle and let it go and do nothing in that scenario, we're not only positive, but our
584.68s: max draw down is only 17.6%.
587.64s: So the draw downs here are much less part of this is because of the time frame.
592.04s: The market in 2022, the tail half was pretty strong.
595.24s: It stopped going through its overall aggressive adjustment phase, but the other thing is we
600.68s: now have a lot of occurrences.
603.20s: Whereas in this case, before every single day there was an expiration, we were tailored
608.36s: to a smaller data set relative to the time span we were in.
612.92s: So a couple other things I want to highlight here quickly, managing the loss in all of these
617.88s: scenarios is clearly important.
620.48s: The best compound annual growth rates you see in all of these different scenarios comes
625.52s: with loss management.
627.00s: Now in the future, I will show you a much better way to manage losses than using a stop.
634.64s: The problem with using stops and stuff like this is the market moves around.
639.04s: And a lot of times you actually get kicked out of a trade that otherwise comes back into
644.16s: profit and that's not good.
646.32s: So we want to talk about things like iron flies next if you're interested in trading
651.48s: these with a smaller account so that we can avoid using stops where we can, but that
657.40s: will be in the next video.
659.88s: So if you have any questions, comments, concerns, throw them in the comments below, let me know
663.60s: what you thought.
664.60s: If this kind of information is helpful for you and if it is, we can talk about some other
668.16s: things to do in the future.
669.64s: Be an outlier.
670.64s: I'll see you guys later.
