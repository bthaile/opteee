0.00s: What's up, all our is quick market update. We're going to talk about the market as a whole super fast
4.16s: Then I want to talk about DJT and then I want to talk about GameStop because we had some news pop today
9.50s: That's actually pretty cool. So from a broad market perspective
12.52s: We saw a little bit of downturn today the interesting part about this downturn is that it's mixed with in the sectors from within the
19.94s: S&P 500 this simply means that it's not like this
23.16s: Universal broad scale sell off because we can see things like XLC
29.06s: XLF XLI all hit highs today. So there are sectors within the S&P 500 that actually are still hitting highs
37.20s: Even though we saw a bit of a rotation over so what really led to that rotation over because if we take a look at XLY
43.56s: XLV XLU all of those were up slightly on the day
46.84s: XLRE was up on the day XLP was up on the day. So it was XLB
50.94s: So if you look at it most of the sectors were up generally on the day
55.34s: We have XLF and XLI which were read on the day, but both still gapped up and started much higher. So
61.66s: This is the problem tech. We saw XLK had a pretty significant down day today
67.90s: So technology
70.02s: continues to be a bit of a pain now
73.10s: Taking a quick look at just the heat map again
75.94s: You can see in elements of what I'm talking about in terms of what's doing well? What's not energy in and of itself is
82.58s: Generally read we're not seeing like massive selloffs, but definitely downside pressure and
87.98s: Consumer staples looks like it's performing well financials performing well Schwab had a pretty big gap up today
94.14s: Even though it was read on the day. It's still very much is up
97.66s: So overall we're getting into earnings and the market looks quite mixed
102.70s: So if we take a look at city group and Goldman Sachs from yesterday
106.10s: They both performed well with respect to EPS versus estimates versus actual
111.94s: And then today we saw continuation of that so PNC BAC even Schwab Schwab had a really interesting move if we pull up
120.86s: Schwab we can see again had a pretty big gap up but then ended down on the day
126.46s: So from a broad market perspective all this means keep risk
131.98s: front of mind we are not in this really calm
135.86s: persistent bull market
137.58s: We are hovering near highs here and people start to get really
141.58s: Gittery and things become slightly tenuous if we take a look at VIX on a six-month time frame
146.46s: We can see that the average price is about what is this?
151.26s: 1951 relatively high if I look at this on a five-year weekly time frame, which does include 2020 the average in this is like
159.86s: 1515 so what I'm flagging for you. It's a little higher actually. I'm sorry
163.50s: It's like 16 and a quarter. I was using the point of control like yeah
167.54s: maybe 16
169.06s: What I'm flagging for you is volatility is expanding at this point even though we're hovering at all time highs
176.34s: That kind of divergence is something to be aware of okay cool now
180.54s: Let's take a peek at DJT really quick because we came across some interesting stuff yesterday during the live stream that I want to highlight for everybody and
189.74s: DJT has been essentially this big proxy for Donald Trump potentially winning the election
194.74s: And if we take a look at the prediction markets as it sits it does look like that's right now the favorite outcome
201.86s: So I'll grab polymarkets for us and we literally can look at it together
206.22s: so here's polymarket and
208.98s: if we take a look at the
212.66s: Presidential election we can see that the winner right now and this actually went up over yesterday
218.18s: So they're pricing winner is Trump 57 and a half Kamala is 42.1 percent is the winner
224.10s: so
225.14s: The reason why I use prediction markets for this is because prediction markets aren't
230.18s: Layton with different political bias like prediction markets don't care necessarily who wins
236.74s: We're just trying to be able to price it as efficiently as possible and then to trade it. That's a trader's mindset
242.18s: You should like whoever you like that's cool. I still want to try to make money on the event itself
247.38s: So that's why this is actually a really really great tool to forecast probability of things
253.46s: Probabilities of things because really smart people that are trying to make a lot of money are gonna be here
259.30s: And you can see there's five hundred seventy million dollars in here
262.42s: So well, that's just on the Trump side by the way
264.66s: So the market here is liquid. There's definitely people participating
267.46s: You can see it appears 1.9 billion total volume in this so lots and lots of people interested
274.58s: In the outcome
275.70s: So that takes us back then to DJT being this proxy
279.94s: For Trump winning the election now it contracted massively today. Who knows
283.70s: This is essentially a meme stock at this point
285.86s: This will ebb and flow as its popularity ebbs and flows
289.14s: But what I can say is it's made a move from 11 and three quarters and it almost hit
294.18s: 35 I mean, we're not that far off from 35 here
296.82s: So people are playing this for the general movement now if we take a peek at the options chain
302.10s: We can see a few things that it's kind of a even split calls and puts we can see 421,000 calls against 445k
310.10s: And you can see that the lion share of these bigger positions are 15 know which is obviously following the election
316.58s: So if we limit this by the election expiration you can see that it's 158 versus 153,000 for both
325.86s: Calls and puts respectively
327.86s: So yeah people are speculating here
329.86s: Lots of people are selling calls as we can tell 25% of the volume today was calls being transacted at the bit or below
336.90s: Typically a sale
338.18s: So this is overall just an interesting thing to follow along and if we grab unusual whales really quick
344.90s: We'll take a look at just the options volume in here to give you a sense of
349.78s: How that's been going on a recent basis. So what I'm going to do is flag month to date which is today's the 15th
359.30s: So let's see what kind of trades we have coming in
362.10s: So there's one really big trade
365.70s: $935,000 in the
369.46s: 15
370.58s: Nove 24 21 calls so these would have been up quite a lot yesterday
376.02s: I don't know where they're at today, but
378.58s: This person obviously this looks like a speculative play to the upside and we can see elements of that both to the upside to the downside
385.78s: And we can see that this option chain has gotten really active in the last month or so
390.90s: So that is
392.42s: DJT it's exhibiting pretty significant volatility implied volatility percentiles literally at 100 percent pegged up
398.82s: And it's at 313.6% IV super super high
403.78s: Now over to game stop we can see that it had a little bit of an inside day
408.10s: It was down just about a quarter point
410.82s: But there was some cool news now I am not going to pretend to know much about any of this because I don't
416.74s: But it's cool to see some activity and for anybody looking to understand what this means more
421.78s: The only person I could think of that would be the guy to talk to is Richard Newton
425.62s: So go check out his YouTube channel for sure because I'm positive
429.22s: I haven't looked but I'm positive he's going to be talking about this
432.02s: And he knows a lot about collectibles cards and stuff like that. I do not
437.70s: So anyways, though this does look cool where we can see that there's a collaboration that started between game stop and
443.62s: PSA and you can see that it's going to become an authorized PSA dealer and PSA will provide grading services for trading cards
450.74s: Through select game stop stores
453.14s: So this doesn't look like
456.02s: massive news
457.54s: But it looks like some sort of activity which is what people are trying to see
462.66s: We're trying to see what the future looks like for game stop based on different pieces of trickled out information like this
470.10s: That gives some insights into what the future is going to look like because it's been very quiet
474.58s: We do know that they're sitting on quite literally billions in cash. So they have
480.90s: tons of money to do things
483.38s: And what the structure of this deal is going to look like I'm not sure yet. I haven't seen a lot of detail on it
491.54s: But you can see that game stop is now starting to make a little bit of action and that's awesome to see
499.94s: So I'm keeping an eye on the news to see if there's any you know
504.50s: Really big takeaways from it
506.50s: I haven't seen anything that pops out to me yet and just from a market perspective
511.86s: I haven't really seen a really significant change in price
515.86s: So typically if this is like a massive announcement you would see price start flying all over the place
521.86s: But this this Pikachu looks really cool. I can't read any of that. I'll be completely honest
526.34s: And I also have to be honest this Pikachu looks a little chubby
529.62s: We might need to get Pikachu some salad
531.62s: But I do like Pikachu. Maybe he's getting bulked up
534.66s: Maybe it's because we're rolling into fall season thus winter bulking season
539.78s: Trying to get massive for then the summer cut. I would accept that as an answer
544.10s: But who knows?
546.26s: So yeah, I am really really interested to see what this grows into it wouldn't be overly surprising to see
553.38s: Some sort of different card offerings they I'm sure game stop could start the row and if they were so inclined and people would chew it
559.30s: Kind of like what we've seen somebody like trump do with his collectible cards the fact that people are buying those
565.38s: Stonishing to me, but people really like the stuff that they like so I could see that being a future direction
571.46s: I have no idea which way it's gonna go and the other thing is I honestly have absolutely no idea
576.98s: if this is
578.42s: What this means in terms of price you guys will have to tell me in the comments is this expensive is this not expensive?
584.90s: I have never done this
586.10s: So I have no reference or how impactful this is
590.58s: but
591.78s: It does look like an interesting thing and it gives the stores a physical purpose now
597.46s: Because again like peripherals and stuff like that you can argue there's a physical purpose for sure
601.06s: But they can still be shipped and a lot of this stuff could be shipped
604.42s: But there's actually a lot more risk in shipping your precious card that's collectible
610.18s: I would be really nervous to ship something like that around
613.86s: So this is actually kind of cool to me that you can find more of these locally that
618.10s: PSI's PSAs pretty widely accepted
620.90s: And you can go walk in and have them evaluated again
623.54s: I don't know if this is expensive or not
624.98s: But to me 20 bucks a card seems a little steep especially if the card is
629.70s: You know comes out to not be worth a whole lot
631.94s: But my guess is they probably have some sort of
635.30s: Effective way to make this palatable for people to go get their cards like that
639.38s: But you guys will have to let me know more about it from an options perspective
643.86s: GameStop is been relatively quiet. So let me grab
648.50s: The option chain and I'm gonna look at I don't care about the sales here. I want to look at
654.98s: transactions for calls people accumulating so there was
660.26s: A pretty big trade yesterday
663.06s: For 500 of the 10 calls, but these are out in 2026
666.66s: 2025 for the next biggest so these are people building out longer term positions
671.22s: Which again, that's a little more
674.58s: Overall price accumulation style play versus this really near-term focus that we tend to see in GameStop options
682.26s: So if we take a look at the trade tab for GameStop and we look across
689.38s: Open interest for everything still a ton of calls 712 713
695.22s: Thousand against 290k on the put side
698.18s: And if we take a look at what concentration of those is in the front expiration 338,000
703.62s: Half so there's still just this massive massive exposure to front
708.74s: Explorations which I cannot help but find that to be so curious because
715.30s: For those that don't know on Saturday
717.46s: I've been doing a
719.62s: Livestream looking at all of roaring kiddie's old trades and I'm grabbing the workbook right now so that I can show you
726.98s: because
728.18s: This activity of playing this front expiration so heavy is so interesting to me because for the people that are trying to emulate
737.70s: What the cat did that's really not what he's done
741.94s: So if we take a look at his options plays what I started to do is actually build out a view over here
748.34s: That shows me the nearest
750.82s: Expiration for all of these different options plays that he's made again. This is now literally going back to the very beginning the very first post
758.26s: That he made and we're still working through the 2024 stuff
761.30s: What I want to highlight from what I've seen so far is he did a 3dT trade one time
767.22s: And that was around an earnings event
770.26s: So this was a event driven near term play and he ended up essentially having that option expire worthless
777.14s: So I just bring that to people's attention because as I go through the rest of all these different trades that I've seen him made
783.14s: You can see 94 dte these are
786.50s: in 70 te these are 52 dte
789.86s: He first put these on at 495 dte
792.90s: So a lot of these trades that he's building even later into the time here like this 137 dte
798.58s: He's building things with pretty long term
802.10s: Expiration that's playing the value up which again
805.94s: I just find it slightly interesting when I look at how most people are playing game stop here
811.38s: Which is playing it like all the front week which is just a way to light money on fire and for a smarter way
817.86s: The bi options I'll link to a video below
820.10s: It's literally just to give you other ideas on how to potentially play this versus just buying super cheap far out of the money options
826.02s: And hoping something happens as always if you need anything let me know be an ally or see you later
