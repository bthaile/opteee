0.00s: Bit of a mixed bag out there today.
2.54s: So I want to do a quick market update.
4.24s: And then I also want to apologize to you guys.
6.54s: There's a couple of things I have to come clean on which I'll get into in just a few
11.08s: minutes.
12.08s: So talking about the markets first, we have a lot of capitulation that's happening right
19.20s: now.
20.20s: And it's across all of the indices.
22.44s: Notice that we had the S&P 500 that was down three quarters of a percent today.
27.68s: And then the Russell was down almost 2% bid back up to about 1.9%.
36.52s: So yeah, overall some some pretty fair weakness going on.
41.94s: But this isn't like falling out of bed.
44.64s: Can't get up kind of weakness.
46.60s: This looks like a lot of things that have had a insane run from about April mid April
53.52s: until now.
55.36s: So it's kind of like if you were to go out and sprint as fast as you can sooner or
61.40s: later, even if you're that dude that can run a sub two hour marathon or whatever the
66.20s: hell it is, you got to take a break sooner or later.
70.00s: So that's kind of what this is to me.
72.32s: I see not a significant display of weakness across the market as I look across breath indicators.
80.96s: I see net highs lows.
82.76s: For example, is turning down net highs is absolutely coming down.
87.26s: But it's not diving into lows just yet.
90.16s: Although lows are now starting to expand.
93.16s: This is gross lows right behind my head here.
98.12s: So you can see yesterday is hovering right around 39 today.
101.28s: It's down to 67.
103.12s: So this starts accelerating meaningfully.
106.16s: That starts to become more of a concern to me.
108.28s: But right now it's still in kind of this middle zone that doesn't cause for much concern
114.92s: in my opinion.
116.08s: It looks like a bit of a pullback going on on the game stop and why I need to apologize
121.68s: to you guys.
122.68s: It is because I sold my long options today.
126.52s: And here's what happened.
128.76s: The market opened and we kind of hovered around here.
133.00s: It didn't look like we were breaking out anywhere.
135.00s: So literally all I did was set an alert for anything above 2898 to get back in.
140.40s: And I said, eh, it looks like we're stalling out.
142.40s: I'm going to take the longs down.
144.92s: But I played a little bit of a game with the market because we all know that the market
148.48s: essentially knows what I think and what you think.
151.20s: And no matter what you do, it's going to try to make you wrong.
153.76s: So I figured if I sell the longs and keep the short calls on that that would send the
161.28s: market higher, right?
162.60s: Out of the longs, you keep the short calls against the shares now that I don't want
166.32s: to unwind yet.
168.20s: And you think that that would send the market higher.
170.48s: It didn't work.
171.48s: Unbelievably, it didn't work.
172.48s: I ended up actually closing the calls for a nice profit on the short side as well.
177.88s: So I made money on both the long and short calls.
180.84s: But you know, the game plan didn't work.
183.76s: The market obviously knew what I was doing.
186.80s: And it didn't play any games out here today.
188.48s: So it did not fall for my trap.
190.52s: It was per usual.
191.52s: That was like a last ditch effort to make this work for everybody.
194.52s: And it didn't happen.
195.52s: So my bad.
196.52s: I'll have to be smarter next time.
198.36s: It must have known about the shares.
200.08s: That's what I'm missing here.
201.52s: It knew that I didn't want to unwind the shares.
204.16s: And it was like, fine, get rid of the calls.
205.76s: I'm going to punish the shares.
207.20s: That's got to be what it's on about.
209.44s: Now little does it know I have my first alert set here.
213.24s: Maybe I'll set a trap alert right here.
215.40s: I'm going to set a trap alert.
218.56s: And if GameStop goes below this alert that I just said, I'm going to sell.
225.20s: So we'll see what happens.
227.20s: GameStop your move.
229.56s: So what's going on in here though?
230.84s: It does look like GameStop is rolling over a little bit.
233.48s: There's no doubt about it.
234.92s: It's hovering right around this point of control.
237.36s: There's a lot of people continuing to transact here.
239.92s: When I look at the overall view of volume for today, it's much lighter.
246.40s: So the volume contracted meaningfully below the two week average.
251.44s: Now the other thing that I want to highlight from what I'm seeing here at least is the
256.88s: sale volume is not chilling out.
258.92s: The sale volume is like 90% today.
260.92s: So there are no shortage of people unwinding for various reasons.
268.08s: There's a lot of speculation as to what's going on there, but it's clear it's happening
272.20s: and it's having an effect on the price.
274.44s: How much of this is just because of GameStop being GameStop?
278.44s: Probably a lot of it, but there's also a broad market weakness.
281.84s: So if you look across small caps in general, they're not having a great day.
288.36s: And you can take a look at that if we go into something like the visualized tab and we
294.96s: grab the Russell.
295.96s: It's a lot of red.
298.12s: It's a lot of red.
299.28s: You wouldn't want this to be what you're open your portfolio up to because everything is
303.72s: getting crushed.
304.92s: All I'm highlighting is that there's very few segments of strength right now.
308.44s: Although there are some in things like financials, energy, those things are not underperforming.
313.92s: So poorly right now builders are doing okay.
317.56s: Small cap financials are getting killed, but large cap is not quite so bad.
323.80s: It's still not great to be clear, but they're not like getting hammered as what we're seeing
328.16s: over here in the financials on the small capside.
331.52s: They're really getting beat up.
333.64s: So let's take a look at the option screen.
336.20s: We know already that I'm out of my front positions via options.
340.36s: I'm waiting for a reentry.
342.12s: We have a ton of volume today.
343.48s: There was no slowdown, 360,000 contracts traded against for calls against 100,000 puts
352.96s: for the calls the vast majority, the overwhelming majority here is in 19 July.
358.40s: We can take a look at that at 212.
361.64s: If we go out and we look at this 26 July expiration, there's activity there, but it does
369.36s: look like the 16 augs are starting to enter the equation.
372.80s: That's what these yellow rectangles are people getting in there.
376.56s: So if we compare those really fast for next week's expiration, it's only 79,000.
381.64s: This is essentially 80,000 calls versus 32,000 puts.
385.64s: And then in 16 aug, it's 32,800 against 9615.
391.64s: So what I'm seeing now is also fairly standard for what I'm starting to pick up as kind of
397.56s: normal for a game stop where the front expiration cycle, especially if it's an op-x is way
404.12s: busier.
405.36s: And then the weeklies tend to slow down a little bit.
408.08s: And then the monthly as it comes up, probably will start to pick up a bit.
412.48s: You can see that being reflected here, literally in the implied volatility.
415.92s: The implied volatility for the rest of this week, all one day left is 155%.
421.20s: Drops to 131, 129, 125, then back up to 131 and a half.
426.16s: That's a meaningful discrepancy between these.
429.24s: And again, it does have earnings coming up on the 4th of September.
433.64s: This is not then.
435.04s: So this isn't elevated because of some sort of earnings release.
438.04s: It's elevated because it's a primary expiration op-x for game stop, which is still not chilled
443.68s: out yet in a massive way at least.
446.84s: So I want to highlight a couple other things really fast as I look at this.
453.12s: The volume today was light.
457.44s: So I looked at the total premium transactions.
461.56s: And I mean, we have what?
462.72s: One, two, three, four, five trades that are above 100,000.
465.92s: So we have, yeah, whoever this is at 99,000, could you not have just done 1000 more so
471.84s: that it could be in this, you selfish human being?
475.60s: Come on now.
477.00s: And they sold the puts.
478.76s: They're bullish here.
480.00s: They sold puts and they couldn't do a thousand dollars more.
483.36s: Unbelievable.
484.36s: Sometimes people are so selfish.
485.88s: So it's just slowing down.
488.32s: It's slowing down a lot is what I'm seeing in the options chains.
490.44s: Again, like if we go back to the 17th and we take a look at some of the transactions
495.24s: we were seeing there, take a look at how many were above 100,000, a much more significant
500.16s: amount with the top three topping of million dollars combined.
504.28s: I'm not even looking at their bots sold.
505.84s: I don't really care in this case.
507.08s: They're pretty much all bullish trades.
508.96s: But I just want to see how engaged are these options chains?
512.60s: How busy are they?
514.04s: We go back to the 16th same story.
515.88s: Tons and tons of positions getting put on, but you'll notice something.
519.84s: A lot of these positions are not for this front expiration.
522.28s: This is a prime example of people who have money making informed decisions with how
528.08s: they're structuring trades.
529.64s: Notice how many of these big positions that were put on for the 16th were for the Friday,
534.56s: this coming Friday, the 19th of July.
537.52s: I am looking, I see one for the 26th of July and then I see two down here for the 19th.
548.24s: That's pretty much it.
550.08s: This shows you where people typically that have decent resources available to them, how
554.92s: they set up their trades.
556.60s: There's a reason why they're not in these super short term explorations.
563.12s: To me so far, it is a function of keeping eye on things as I've been very closely looking
569.28s: for any sort of interesting activity that really starts to peak my interest.
574.32s: Some of these transactions, like these 25s, these are for tomorrow, bro.
579.84s: This was at the 25s, they came in at 290, so they came in right at the offer and they
585.44s: paid $137,000.
588.68s: Fingers crossed.
591.84s: I hope it works for them, but then I also look at that and I think tough, tough way to make
596.48s: a few bucks.
597.48s: Gotta be honest with you.
599.48s: We'll see how that pans out for them.
600.80s: If we look at those 25s and they're right now trading for $1.10, they got in at 290.
615.08s: So they've essentially cut down to a third of what their overall cost was in a day, literally
623.52s: today.
625.36s: This is the fun and the beauty of trading really, really short term options is they give
633.30s: it and they take it.
635.72s: And from our home boy that came in at 0731 Pacific time with those 25 calls, 471 of them.
645.84s: Salute to you, homie, but that's not looking great.
649.08s: And again, this isn't to shit on them.
651.68s: I genuinely, I hope this prints tomorrow.
653.20s: I really do, but you can see that they obviously didn't put this trade on for 290, expecting
661.90s: it to go to $1.10 if I'm being generous.
667.72s: Like that's the problem with these.
669.60s: They're going to move super fast.
671.20s: So as always, if there's anything you want me to take a look at, let me know.
674.64s: I am going to be watching this pretty closely tomorrow for sure.
677.88s: Be an outlier.
678.88s: I'll see you guys later.
