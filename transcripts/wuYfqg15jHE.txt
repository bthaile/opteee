0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market update. It's been a minute since I took a look at GME.
4.40s: So that's the goal for today. But as you can tell, we have a little guest appearance,
8.04s: which is my spine. Today, I had the pleasure of getting an epidural injection.
12.56s: You can see there's actually two of them here. And it's for all the disc stuff that I'm
16.72s: trying to resolve right now. This is supposed to help reduce inflammation.
20.04s: But I've never seen anything like this before. So I thought I would share it with you
23.56s: because, as I mentioned all the time, the goal of what I do is to share knowledge.
28.56s: Somovid trading related, most of it, except for most of my knowledge is, but some of it
33.00s: is in learning stuff about this, which is actually kind of cool. These are like super big
36.96s: needles. I think they said they were like three and a half inches. And they go into
40.24s: the epidural space. They put in a contrast. That's what makes the nerves here. You can
45.00s: actually see the nerves. It's what makes the nerves this darker color so that they can
49.12s: see them. And then, yeah, interesting. I thought overall. And the other fun fact is these
55.44s: little bends, the doctor actually puts the bends in them herself. And it's so that she
61.24s: can drive the needle better, meaning, you know, position it to where she wants. So fun stuff
66.24s: all around. All right. Now let's talk about the markets, GameStop. What's been going on
69.84s: here? Well, we're running sideways. We had a little bit of a breath of fresh air. Once
75.20s: we saw that the at the market had completed, we've seen volume start to contract back
80.84s: down. So we hit a peak volume here on the 20th of September at 62 million shares. Then
87.40s: we came down to 14, then we came down to 12, then we came down to six. And now we are
92.64s: down to 5.7. So this is kind of standard fare for what I've seen previously after we go
98.56s: through the offering where things start to cool off. Now the cool part is we can see
103.36s: that overall GameStop has been consolidating really nicely here. So we're definitely
108.76s: leveled up a little bit from running down towards the 200 day moving averages. So I'm
114.60s: actually really eager to see if we continue trending sideways here or if there is a point
120.20s: where it starts to turn back over. But even on a down day relative like today, meaning,
125.12s: I'll show you in a second what I mean. On today, we can see that it didn't actually
130.48s: dump off that hard. And it's very much just in a little bit of this consolidation phase.
136.28s: So I don't mind seeing this. And I hope that it can continue trending like this. Now
141.24s: regardless of what I hope or what I want to see doesn't really matter because the market's
144.56s: going to do whatever the market wants to do. And right now we see massive, massive call
150.76s: skew. And this is I'm not being hyperbolic. This is massive relative call skew. There's
156.12s: over 700,000 calls against less than 300,000 puts. That's even greater than the standard
162.68s: two to one that I look for in a general bull's configuration. And again, it's relative
167.72s: to the product. So when I say two to one, I'm just talking about the ratio of calls to puts.
172.28s: And it's highly product specific. In general, I almost always see game stop with call skew.
177.92s: However, from the put side, they've actually been coming down quite a lot. The other thing
182.40s: I want you to look at is look at the breakdown of these different exploration cycles. So we
189.16s: can see that most of the calls actually are in 18 October that have the higher OI. And
197.08s: for the puts, it's a bit of a mix. I see 18 October for sure. But then I also see longer
202.60s: term exploration cycles like 17 Jan 25. So those are people playing longer term hedging
208.52s: positions. And that's actually what makes up the bulk of what we see here from the put
213.96s: OI side of things. So overall, very interesting volatility still low. This is again,
220.04s: kind of the new norm where I'm seeing everything below 100%. So relative basis, right? 100%
226.36s: vol is not low, you know, gross number, but for something like game stop that is relatively low.
232.20s: Now a couple other general admin notes that I'm picking up on. For me, I'm still essentially
237.72s: trading the same thing. I've had a couple of people ask about what I'm doing in here. And it's
241.88s: standard fair. I still have the base position, which is with long shares. And then I am still selling
246.84s: short calls against it because there's no reason for me not to. And it's a way for me to continue to
251.32s: extract some value from game stop while we're going through these lows. This is actually exactly
257.24s: where those short calls are useful. Now the downside to the short calls is that if we get a big spike,
262.44s: they get ran over and it can offer a massive problem. That's why I always, always sell them at
267.64s: a ratio. So what I mean by that is I'm going to make sure I have at least more than 100 shares of
273.40s: game stop if I'm going to sell one call so that if my shares get called away for whatever reason,
278.68s: unlikely, but if they did in that big up move, I have the shares to offer because I do not want to
282.76s: be short game stop. That's a terrible place to be. And that's not just because of the fun of
287.64s: talking about how screwed up the shorts are, but from a trader's perspective, that can put you in a
291.56s: really bad spot if there is a squeeze. Unfortunately, at that same point in time. So by keeping it at a
297.16s: ratio, I make sure I do not cap my profit potential if there is a squeeze because I do not want to
303.48s: cap the profit potential during those movements. I want to be able to trade them. That's what I do.
308.60s: So a couple other admin notes. Let's take a quick look at some dark pool trades because we are still
316.44s: seeing these 5,000 blocks come through. I think that's worth noting. I don't think we have a
321.16s: discrete understanding of what exactly this is just yet, but I think it is something I continue to
327.08s: see. And then if I look back at the 25th and I filter a max of 5,000, I can see them again. And
333.72s: it's kind of a similar sizing. So again, I do not think anybody has a monopoly on the number 5,000.
339.64s: And I again, I do not think all of these would be roaring kitty. Even if this was him, this looks
345.32s: like standard people transacting, but the thing I cannot help but find really interesting about
350.52s: these is that if we go back to like the middle of April, something like that, we don't actually see
357.32s: 5,000 block transactions going on. They don't really seem to start until we get into May sometime.
363.96s: And then they start popping up. So just kind of an interesting thing. I don't think again,
369.80s: anything to specifically highlight other than the occurrence of the thing. And then we'll continue
375.08s: keeping an eyeball on it to see if anything materializes. Last thing I want to take a look at with you.
380.68s: Obviously are the options side of things to see if we have any interesting trends. I haven't
386.44s: looked at this yet. So we'll look at it together really quick. And what do we have? I realize that
393.96s: I'm filtering by something. Give me one sec. So it keeps the size, which obviously I'm not looking
399.24s: for 5,000 blocks here. I'm just looking for any transactions. I want to sort it by premium
404.44s: and super quiet today, super, super quiet today. Biggest trade is 42k. There's not much to talk
410.36s: about there. I'll do for the week leading in just because I haven't looked at GameStop specifically
414.68s: yet and still very, very quiet. So important to note again, we keep an eye on this because as we see
422.44s: changes, that's when things start getting really interesting. Now last item on the agenda is actually
427.24s: a question that I got via email. So let's see what Paul, our friend Paul, shout out to you. Paul,
432.36s: great to hear from you. Paul says I've been joining your videos lately, learning a lot about
436.28s: options. I was looking at Jimmy feed today. I wonder if you could comment on the trades in the
439.56s: photo below. I'm guessing they are connected based on time sizes and wondered if you could give
443.40s: your thoughts on their possible strategy. So first and foremost, I actually think that is,
448.68s: and this isn't meant to sound mean or anything like that. But I personally think it's a giant
452.84s: waste of time to play this game. I'm happy to go through the idea because I understand their
457.80s: perspective. I know where Paul is coming at this from, which is trying to connect dots.
463.24s: The problem is you cannot discreetly connect these dots literally ever.
469.56s: Anytime that we're coming up with connected dots, meaning this person probably did this and then
474.28s: this, it's still an inference. Even when we had that crazy options volume, not all too long ago
480.92s: in GameStop, where we saw somebody buying pretty big options trades and then unwinding them like
486.68s: a half hour later in the same size, in the same strike, in the same expiration. It looks like
492.92s: the same person and it's, I would assume it is, but it's still an assumption. We don't know for
499.24s: certain and it's important to identify that fact because the process of going through and trying
504.84s: to identify what other people are doing is such a difficult way to attempt to make money trading.
513.00s: So that's why I think it's a really difficult process to go through. Now that aside,
517.64s: happy to talk about this with Paul, I just want to give that note so that we don't have people that
522.84s: are trying to do this all the time as like their main approach to trading because again, it's going
527.24s: to be really difficult to turn that into anything usable. So now to Paul's point, if we take a look
534.68s: at this, I had to zoom in a little bit so it's a little more legible. We can see that he's looking
538.44s: at two specific series here. We have the 17 Jan 25, 18 calls and then we have the 27 Sep,
547.80s: 20, 24 expiration 17 calls. So the first thing I can see here is that if we add up these numbers,
555.96s: so for these 18 calls, if we add the 200, if we add the 160, if we add the 74, and if we add
562.68s: the 116, it comes out to 550. So that is very likely the same person and it's very likely the same
571.56s: person that's getting filled over time into a position. And then we can look at the same thing
576.84s: with the 17 calls that are expiring newer and time that these ones are being purchased.
582.28s: And we can see a similar process where it does look like based on the time that this is the same
587.80s: person getting fills at similar timeframes. So we can model this trade together and see what it looks
595.00s: like. So if we pop over here to the platform, we can go to the trade tab and we can grab first
601.48s: the 17 Jan 25s go out here and then we can grab the 18 calls, which are in the money, these
607.32s: are being sold because these are coming in at the bid. And I'm just going to ballpark it at like
613.72s: 580 something like that. It doesn't really matter what the price is. I just want to give it to
617.64s: you for context. And we have a bunch of trades in here because we've been looking at roaring
621.64s: kiddie's trade. So we'll have to tick some of these off and then we'll start with these. So we
627.08s: have those. And again, we know that we have 550 of those. So we'll put short 550. Then if we go to the
636.20s: what do we have here, the 17s on the 27th. And we have again, it looks like 550 of those as well
645.72s: because the numbers match. So I think it's a completely fair assumption to say that we think this
649.08s: is the same person. And if we sell these ones were bought at the offer and again, just ballparking
656.36s: price. It's like five. What I'm doing right now, by the way, is just looking at the executed price
666.60s: just to come up with an idea. And it's like super close. It's a little bit cheaper. So maybe we'll call
672.44s: it like 540 or something like that, just a little bit cheaper than the others. And again, we'll size
676.68s: this up so that it mirrors what we have. So we'll analyze this. We'll add this up so that it's 550
683.64s: of those. And then we got those again for maybe like five. We'll call it like 540 or something
690.52s: like that. So that's the trade. And if you're wondering what that trade is, it essentially is
696.92s: just looking for movement. Now, this can happen in a few different ways. But this is more likely a
702.52s: play on volatility than anything else. That's what I see here. Because by coming into this really
707.64s: near term position, I'm seeing the idea that we're playing probably close, vol expanding is what
714.84s: I'm guessing. But again, the most important point to note here is we don't know what else is in
719.64s: this person's book, right? And that's what makes it such a sloppy game of trying to understand
725.16s: what they're doing. Because I have no idea what else is in this person's portfolio. And even though
731.00s: these trades went on seemingly at the same time and seemingly make this, it doesn't necessarily
736.28s: tell us the whole picture of what else is held in the portfolio and how maybe these don't even
740.92s: line up with one another. Maybe they were just put on at the same time, but tied to other positions.
745.64s: Really hard to say. But if I were to look at these in a vacuum to interpulse question, it looks
750.44s: like a volatility play. That's my best guess. So got a wrap up some hop in over to the outlier pro
756.28s: live stream. I rescheduled the stream with Peruvian bull just because I didn't know if I was going to be
762.28s: messed up after getting the procedure done a little earlier today overall feel okay. So
766.84s: should be good to go. But yeah, I will follow back up with you all when we're going to do that.
771.00s: And then we have the GME live stream tomorrow, 5 p.m. Pacific time being outlier. See you all later.
