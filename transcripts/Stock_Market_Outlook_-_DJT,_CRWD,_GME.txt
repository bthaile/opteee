0.60s: what's up everyone running through a
2.00s: quick Market Outlook for this coming
4.36s: week we have a few things coming up and
6.24s: then I want to talk about djt the stock
9.56s: I want to talk about crwd crowd strike
12.32s: and what's going on there as I'm still
14.40s: learning a little bit more about the
15.60s: technicalities behind it so I thought we
17.12s: could do that together and then I want
19.48s: to talk a little bit about how things
21.72s: like GameStop are looking for the week
23.76s: out ahead so we have a few things that
25.76s: we're going to touch first off we can
28.08s: start with kind of a broad Market
30.60s: overview of what events we have coming
33.72s: up this week which you can see up here
36.32s: we'll filter this out to be this coming
39.12s: week and there are a few things that I
43.32s: think are worth directing your attention
44.56s: towards the very first one is starting
47.72s: on the
49.28s: 23rd and it looks like really Monday is
52.80s: kind of super quiet there are a couple
55.52s: earnings coming out I think there's a
58.36s: Verizon stuff like that so there's not a
61.08s: ton that I'm seeing there of significant
63.92s: interest the 23rd is mostly home sales
66.96s: so a couple of those will be larger
68.72s: impact but not massively impactful
71.60s: either the 24th is when we start getting
75.20s: some more inflation level data this is
79.20s: really important so things like the PMI
82.72s: from S&P we will absolutely want to keep
85.48s: an eye on those when those are coming
87.08s: out the market will probably be fairly
88.68s: sensitive to them as as well then we
91.56s: have fed Bowman speaking on the 25th pce
95.28s: QQ coming out GDP QQ those are going to
98.04s: be massive really really really
99.72s: informative figures along with jobless
101.48s: claims so as I look at this kind of
104.16s: boring Monday Tuesday then the 24th
107.00s: starts to pick up the 25th has some
109.40s: important information and then the 26th
111.28s: does as well with pce month over month
114.88s: personal income spending the balance
117.12s: sheet core pce so so yeah this tail end
122.00s: of this coming week has a little more
124.28s: economic activity going on and a lot of
126.44s: this stuff is still just very very
128.76s: topical to the market and it boils down
131.40s: to where we think rates are going a
135.88s: quick look at the FED watch tool it
137.84s: shows us still with a 95% probability
141.60s: now of no change in 31 July and then 18
146.00s: September it's a
147.52s: 97% probability of and ease which this
151.96s: is even kind of interesting because the
154.04s: no change probability was pretty high
155.92s: then it dumped down as low as 1.92 and
158.56s: now it's back up to 2.86 uh still
160.88s: insignificant still very very low
162.52s: probability and right now it looks like
165.48s: uh 25 basis point cut as compared to the
169.52s: 50 basis point which would be down here
171.84s: so if we take a look at the just
173.44s: aggregate probabilities you can kind of
174.96s: see what the market is looking at
176.72s: obviously here is where we are now it's
178.72s: looking at ENT potentially a 255 bips
181.40s: cut in the September meeting then
183.96s: another 25 bips cut in November and then
187.44s: another 25 bips cut in December my guess
190.68s: is after this first one goes through we
192.80s: probably would see a
195.16s: pretty
196.72s: um I think a pretty significant change
199.28s: in these probabilities would happen
200.64s: there based on what I'm seeing from the
202.24s: FED I would find it hard to believe that
204.00s: they would just immediately go through
205.48s: this cutting campaign although I think
207.04s: it makes sense but it they've been
211.60s: so data oriented I should say and that
215.08s: includes leads and lags that's kind of
216.68s: why I paused when I was saying that
218.68s: because sometimes it looks like they're
220.64s: being indecisive or slow to respond and
223.24s: I think that that's part of it but they
225.64s: continue wanting to see data so that's
227.56s: why I Leen if especially if they're
229.20s: doing these smaller Cuts like 25 basis
231.64s: points sure you could do two of them
233.04s: back to back but then I have to imagine
234.92s: you probably would take a pause
236.72s: depending on what data is coming in it's
238.92s: really difficult running the leads and
240.32s: lags of these kinds of economic systems
242.56s: I'm not going to pretend that I have any
243.84s: idea what they're looking at or how
245.44s: they're looking at it but really for the
248.04s: market this boils down to the market
249.64s: wants Cuts so if this starts changing
252.32s: where the market is not seeing the
253.64s: probability of a cut remaining as high
255.76s: you'll probably see that flow through to
257.12s: the market that's essentially the way
258.68s: that I look at it all right so that's
261.20s: kind of the main stuff coming up this
263.00s: week let's take a quick look at djt
265.60s: because this is the easier one to start
267.44s: with so we have our folks over here at
268.92s: Austin private wealth relatively unknown
271.48s: realistically before this they do have
272.76s: some good Google reviews though good for
274.24s: them and you can see that there was a
277.44s: really interesting trade that came
279.40s: through at some point so essentially
282.72s: right before this assassination attempt
285.96s: underwent there was a massive massive
289.04s: trade that came through people thought
292.48s: that was interesting timing and there's
295.16s: a little bit more to it than that it
297.28s: doesn't boil down at least as far far as
299.92s: I can see to that so what happened here
303.84s: pretty simple we saw this trade come
306.12s: through and this was the filing date
308.88s: that is important to differentiate from
311.44s: when the trade went on there are leads
314.36s: and leads and lags to when trades are
317.56s: placed versus when they are filed so in
320.40s: this case the position was on since 30
323.48s: June and this is when they chose to file
326.68s: and this fell in line with when they
328.72s: tend to file their stuff historically
332.56s: the other thing that we noticed here is
334.52s: that there was a pretty interesting
337.32s: unilateral issue with their data and you
340.92s: can see that they use a third-party
344.48s: vendor and they applied essentially a
348.40s: 10,000 contract multiplier for
350.84s: everything not just djt all their stuff
353.44s: so this does look like a fantastically
356.76s: strangely timed clerical error and this
359.84s: does happen this is one of the issues
361.92s: when we have a little too much
364.28s: coincidence and we start going down the
365.88s: rabbit hole Too Fast Too Deep because it
369.40s: is also not
371.68s: overwhelmingly insignificant that this
374.40s: fund is tied to Black Rock which had
377.56s: some sort of relationship with the
379.84s: shooter that's now dead thankfully and
383.92s: that I think is interesting but Black
387.40s: Rock owns pretty much everything so it's
389.64s: it's it's not like that crazy the other
391.68s: thing I want to point out to people is
392.96s: that if we take a look at
394.68s: djt the idea of putting on like a
397.76s: bearish position in here is it's not
400.36s: crazy but it's been going down since the
404.24s: end of March it's literally had lower
406.56s: highs successively and persistently the
409.20s: lower lows is starting to chill out
411.36s: right here as compared to here so you
413.24s: could argue that it's starting to gain a
415.12s: little bit of a footing but this isn't
416.96s: something that like you look at it
418.24s: you're like again from a trading
419.60s: perspective I don't look at this and be
420.80s: like ah bullish this is going up it
423.32s: looks like it's struggling and it looks
424.96s: like it's vastly going sideways if not
426.96s: slightly down so I mean this doesn't
430.00s: look great to me so the prospects of
432.52s: somebody putting on a bearish trade in
434.04s: here in general is not crazy to me now
436.88s: again if it were actually at that size
439.84s: that would be nuts but it doesn't
442.08s: necessarily look like that's so much the
443.72s: case so I just wanted to share that with
445.28s: you all you guys can check out these
446.56s: articles um at your own Leisure so that
449.00s: as always you can come to your own
450.44s: conclusions that is my goal is to put
452.80s: information in front of you and then
455.04s: maybe help interpolate it as best as I
457.56s: can but leave it up to you all to arrive
460.24s: at what you think happened or did not
462.60s: happen now the other thing that we do
464.48s: have to talk about though is this whole
466.24s: crowd strike business and it is not
469.92s: insignificant and you can see that it is
472.60s: massively impacting this stock it has
475.32s: been falling off a cliff essentially
478.56s: from the six 16th of July we closed here
483.48s: at 369 giggity and we hit a low of two
489.96s: like sub 290 over the next three days
493.52s: that is a massive down move and this
496.48s: whole thing has a really really big
498.40s: impact so I thought I would play a
501.44s: little bit of this video that I've been
502.76s: watching because this dude knows way
504.40s: more about this stuff than I do and we
505.68s: can learn a little bit together so let's
507.20s: get after it by businesses this has
509.12s: caused impact I could never have
511.16s: imagined everything from business
512.72s: meetings falling apart to news networks
515.28s: being in a pretty funny state to the
519.04s: absolute chaos with flights so what he's
522.52s: highlighting here is the broad-based
524.60s: impact which is really important to note
526.68s: by the way for interconnected systems
529.08s: like this when you have that level of
532.20s: impact it
534.12s: is really difficult to isolate and fix
538.08s: things so essentially there was this
540.40s: giant blue screen of death that started
543.88s: tra just hitting essentially everything
546.44s: like this right here so what's been
549.52s: going on with it let's see what else he
551.28s: has to say I think he gets a little bit
552.80s: more into it here investigating breaches
554.84s: so when a company gets hacked they're
556.68s: the company you would call in to figure
558.04s: out why they were hacked what happened
559.72s: and what the impact is so if you were
561.52s: affected by something like ransomware
562.80s: attacks this is the company that would
564.24s: come in and help clean up to damage
566.36s: because of that they started creating a
567.72s: lot of software think like Norton or
570.32s: malware bites but way deeper and their
573.16s: goal is to make sure anything that even
574.64s: looks like it might be wanted to act
576.32s: like that a lot of companies require you
579.68s: to use this software it's not like oh
581.28s: you can choose what so what he's talking
583.36s: about is how pervasive it is and
585.92s: essentially how many companies are
587.92s: experiencing outages from it we know
590.32s: that this is really widespread it's
592.16s: across Industries we saw the airports
595.08s: getting hammered because of this right
596.72s: here I saw a lot a lot of news about it
600.04s: so we know that the overall issue is
603.32s: significant and I think the problem is
606.40s: exactly that I saw here based on the
608.16s: breath of evidence that I see this
610.84s: doesn't look like an easy fix at all so
614.20s: I saw this come up on what was this
617.64s: Friday that this came out I think and
619.88s: this is actually the CEO of crowd strike
622.12s: so let's hear from him Jim Kramer uh
624.56s: this we have to speak right now to
626.04s: George kurts the CEO due to it George
628.64s: thank you so much for for coming on I
629.88s: know your company very well first Jim
631.56s: let me let me start with I want to
633.28s: personally apologize to every
634.96s: organization every group and every
636.96s: person who's been impacted by this
638.84s: little bit file that drives some content
642.32s: and what that means is there's a single
644.52s: file that drives some additional Logic
648.00s: on how we look for uh Bad actors and
652.52s: this logic was pushed out and caused an
656.24s: issue uh only in the Microsoft
658.36s: environment
659.84s: um specific to uh this this bug that we
664.24s: had um we so that's an important note
669.32s: right as we talk about the overall
671.20s: impact and even from this other video
673.20s: when he was walking through the the
676.24s: impact on the plane tracking that they
678.44s: saw this it's clear that it's not fully
681.32s: impactful right because if that's what
682.76s: it looked like before the strike or the
684.68s: issue I'll leave it as now that's what
687.72s: it looked like before and and that's
689.88s: what it ended up looking afterwards I
691.56s: can't get the time perfectly that were
693.04s: going around before this issue occurred
695.16s: and that there's after it there's still
698.04s: planes up there right like it's still
699.56s: tracking something so that tells us that
702.08s: obviously not everything is routed onto
704.12s: that we identifi this very quickly and
707.20s: rolled back this particular content file
710.72s: obviously uh many organizations are are
713.36s: impact rebooted and we've fixed the
716.52s: issue um so the systems are coming up
718.68s: and running some the good old turn it
721.12s: off turn it back on I mean I think that
723.32s: is about as classic as you could
725.00s: possibly get with having an issue and
726.40s: it's really good to see that even the
728.72s: CEO of companies like crowd strike lean
732.04s: on the same thing that I do that's great
733.92s: systems may not fully recover and we're
736.16s: working individually with each and every
738.32s: customer to make sure that we can get
739.80s: them up and running and operational but
742.68s: to be clear it was not a Cyber attack it
745.28s: wasn't um anything related to that it
747.88s: was a content uh bug or update that uh
752.08s: we sent out that we identified and and
754.08s: we rolled back so I think that's
756.72s: important to hear and that's the reason
758.32s: why I wanted to walk you all through
759.56s: this because it's something that I saw a
761.28s: lot of people talking about and again we
763.68s: get super deep into speculation in terms
765.60s: of how deep it goes and anyways that's
768.12s: what they're reporting right now as of
769.64s: the latest right now this is a really
772.08s: interesting event from a trading
773.80s: perspective because we for me I like to
778.00s: see the dust settle to make sure that
779.88s: we're not necessarily in any sort of
782.48s: giant problems but I do really like to
785.88s: play reversion plays on stuff like this
788.64s: so the way that would look is I would be
790.52s: setting stops something again like this
794.08s: so it creates a really tight range for
796.56s: us to move and if we start getting a
798.52s: break back up this way I like that to
800.72s: the upside at least to get back into
803.76s: generally where it was before these news
805.84s: driven kinds of events provide really
808.44s: interesting pricing opportunities and
810.28s: far as far as Market extremes so anyways
813.76s: that's something I'm looking at here now
815.64s: let's talk about GameStop quickly
818.08s: because we just ran through an
820.04s: expiration cycle and we had our live
821.68s: stream yesterday with my boy Newton that
823.16s: was super fun learned a lot more about
825.56s: the company I continue to do so which
827.44s: I'm enjoying greatly and there's a
829.84s: couple really interesting things that
831.56s: we're seeing going on primarily in that
834.28s: we did see a decent move right so from
836.64s: the 1st of July up here it's about 20%
839.56s: move and now it is falling back off
841.56s: we're getting near a couple key levels
843.28s: as far as moving averages and stuff like
845.00s: that I don't care so much about that in
846.92s: something like GameStop necessarily to
848.56s: be completely honest with you it's
850.48s: primarily because as I always say I
852.20s: think it is different Pro really
854.68s: different price thriving factors so
857.92s: volume has been very light this is
860.12s: looking at a one- Monon volume scheme
862.80s: and you can see that we're still
864.76s: declining pretty massively from what we
867.16s: were seeing even back in here right on
869.76s: the late it's kind of like be mid to
872.84s: late June we saw almost double the
876.16s: volume that we're seeing now to a degree
878.24s: so I'm keeping a really close eye on
880.08s: volume expansion I actually have a
881.60s: couple scans specifically on GameStop
883.76s: hunting for that
885.60s: specifically and from a trading
888.68s: perspective there are a few things that
891.16s: I want to look at with you first off is
894.56s: we have shed a lot of options so across
900.08s: all of series all strikes we have 571
904.28s: th000 calls and 350,000 puts this is
909.04s: much much lighter than what it tends to
911.60s: be and my expectation is that I think
915.36s: we're coming into a quieter period
917.08s: that's what seems to be happening here a
919.56s: couple things do stick out the
921.64s: volatility again for the front
923.16s: expiration just it tends to tick up week
925.64s: up this is
927.68s: almost it's pretty Rock Steady at this
929.80s: point you can almost expect to see it
931.32s: it's actually something I've been
932.20s: trading because I continue to see it now
935.72s: the other thing that I look at is where
937.64s: we see the next centralization of
940.80s: volatility which is out in 16 August so
944.72s: a couple other things as I look at it
947.16s: are where do we see the majority of this
950.52s: volume and you'll notice that the
952.32s: majority of what we have now is kind of
954.32s: split all over the place we see that
956.56s: there's stuff out in 16 August that
959.04s: becomes the next main expiration cycle
961.60s: so that doesn't surprise me and then we
963.68s: see some of these pockets and these are
966.20s: the 26th jues there are some decent Siz
968.88s: positions here in 26 July although it is
971.24s: much slower to be abundantly clear than
973.80s: most of what else we've seen But like
975.16s: this right here is not insignificant the
978.04s: 30s expiring 5 days from now currently
981.60s: have
983.16s: 21,400 oi with
985.68s: 16,000 volume uh from Friday so this is
989.52s: people that are just sliding out a week
991.72s: they're not going out super far which
993.56s: again you all know how I feel about that
995.60s: by now but that's what's happening and
998.32s: if we take a look at the further out
1000.00s: strikes because these are the weeklys
1001.96s: and not the monthlies you'll notice if
1003.76s: we go to the monthlies you'll they'll
1005.24s: take you out to 125 on the weeklys they
1007.60s: keep you into the 95s that's just for
1009.36s: liquidity as I continue to remind you
1011.92s: guys a lot of this is you're going to
1014.52s: see less liquidity in these weeklys more
1016.60s: liquidity in the monthlies and you'll
1018.52s: see that expressed in the number of
1020.24s: contracts that are there the number of
1022.16s: volume per day you'll see that in the
1024.00s: number of strikes offered it's a
1025.80s: function of liquidity so anyways all the
1028.84s: way out here at the 95s there's 14,000
1031.52s: contracts with another 5600 traded on
1034.36s: Friday and it looks like they're still
1035.60s: building so there's more people moving
1037.72s: out into these super far out of the
1039.08s: monies as well smaller positions the
1042.20s: last I looked nothing that looks heavily
1045.80s: sizable and the last thing well let me
1048.32s: summarize this at least so right now it
1050.96s: looks like in terms of an overall
1052.40s: participation standpoint the options
1054.00s: chain is slowing down a bit we're seeing
1056.00s: a slight expansion and near-term V with
1058.16s: the next real look coming out at 16
1060.48s: August and the other thing I'm noticing
1063.28s: is the disparity between calls and puts
1066.48s: is much lower this used to be two times
1068.44s: two and a half times three times more
1070.76s: calls than puts and now it's almost even
1073.64s: this is the closest I've seen it across
1075.40s: all expiration Cycles in a while the
1078.08s: next primary expiration cycle is
1079.88s: starting to get built out although there
1082.24s: are a couple larger lingering positions
1084.48s: in the 26th July's at the 30s and then
1087.60s: at the
1088.60s: 95s so the last thing I want to show you
1091.08s: guys is back over here and I want to
1094.96s: take a look at not crowd strike I want
1096.88s: to take a look at gme and I specifically
1099.00s: just want to look at the volume for the
1101.68s: previous week and the reason why I think
1103.44s: that that's helpful is to see how people
1106.00s: are positioning in the near term so this
1109.68s: you'll see that there are some still
1112.08s: really large positions most of these
1115.44s: large positions are still on notice that
1117.68s: these are still set 19 DTE 26 26 544
1122.00s: these ones have come off 89 26 so a lot
1125.60s: of these larger premium overall
1128.00s: positions still exist so that matters to
1131.40s: me because we didn't go through a
1132.92s: massive Exodus of open positions that
1136.40s: are backed by pretty significant value
1139.48s: they're still open and out there so I'm
1141.76s: going to keep an eye on this I'm still
1143.40s: as always looking for options activities
1145.48s: and keeping an eye on everything else
1146.76s: because there's a lot going on right now
1148.12s: Biden just dropped out Kamala looks like
1150.64s: she's got the nod from him so that'll be
1153.08s: interesting the way the market reacts to
1154.64s: that so far it doesn't look like much
1156.92s: the Market's actually up with Futures
1158.84s: right now I see the e- Min is up 0.3%
1162.88s: the Russell's trailing a little bit tiny
1164.88s: little bit 0.28 and then the nasdaq's
1167.24s: recovering pretty well at 0.5 5% up so
1170.32s: far now these overnight opens they don't
1172.84s: necessarily translate highly
1174.52s: informatively to the next day but it's
1176.88s: not the inverse where if you see these
1178.80s: down really big the night before a lot
1180.68s: of times you'll see them not looking
1182.60s: great the next morning so there's not
1184.48s: much to read into this in terms of what
1186.00s: this does to price tomorrow but it does
1188.60s: mean that standard behavior is really
1190.68s: what I'm seeing here a little bit of a
1192.00s: recovery at least because the market RIT
1194.72s: large last week went through a little
1197.56s: bit of a game defitely we saw pretty
1201.16s: uniform sell-offs across pretty much
1204.16s: everything so there were a couple
1206.04s: sectors showing strength but seldom and
1209.24s: we'll see if the market is going to
1210.60s: start moving into a consolidation period
1212.56s: now or if it's got a little bit more of
1214.32s: a correction coming ahead of it that's
1216.28s: what I'm looking at right now the NASDAQ
1219.48s: saw a pretty massive move the Russell is
1222.08s: still showing relative strength and the
1225.04s: SPX is kind of somewhere in the middle
1226.88s: so that's where we're at now as always
1229.00s: any questions anything you want me to
1230.72s: take a look at let me know I'm always
1232.36s: here be an outlier see you guys later
