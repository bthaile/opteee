0.00s: What's up everybody Eric here? We are back with the Outlier podcast and I got my friend Jim
7.34s: Ropel here. He and I actually, we connected like almost a year ago and then we kind of,
12.56s: you know, fell off for a little bit, but I'm absolutely stoked to have you on. I have
16.74s: done a lot of homework and I follow a lot of what you talk about and I am really excited
21.82s: to dive into your approach to the markets because as we were talking about right before
25.06s: we started, a lot of what you do is different than what I do. And that's one of my favorite
29.86s: parts about the podcast. One is I get to learn about other approaches, but then two, we
34.66s: get to put different ideas in front of people and then let them see what works for them
38.46s: because there's a lot of ways to make money in the market. So welcome to the podcast.
42.14s: Thanks for taking some time to hang out. Thank you very much for having me here. It
46.54s: did take a long time to get this scheduled, but we're doing it. That's it. You know what?
51.70s: The thing is it's like, I'm not always great at stuff, but I'm pretty damn persistent
56.34s: man. So like, I'm always around. So whenever it lines up, it lines up. If it doesn't,
60.66s: it doesn't say lovey, but I'm actually really, really stoked that we had a chance to line
65.94s: up because like I was telling you right before we started, I am not like a good friend,
70.30s: but I know Matt Cruz so pretty well here and I have talked quite a few times and I get
74.22s: a chance to talk about kind of like the, you know, small cab growth stock style style.
79.22s: That's a lot of, you know, cancel him based, but I know that you obviously had a relationship
85.14s: with Bill O'Neill, talked to me a little bit about your background. There's a lot of information
90.02s: out there. I'll put a link to your website in the notes below for people that want to like,
94.26s: really dive in and learn all about you, but to get like a high level summary, just to introduce
99.46s: you to the audience, at least my audience, so that they kind of an idea of where you're approaching
103.14s: this thing from just a quick background on how you got started in markets and kind of generally
107.94s: what your approach looks like. You know, my dad, my grandfather worked at
114.98s: Bailey Pindwell machines in the stamping plant. This is 80 years ago or more and Bailey came
120.66s: public and he got stock as an employee. I mean, he was a factory worker and so my dad started to
125.94s: watch Bailey and my grandfather. My dad always talk about it and then I went to college and my
131.54s: two best friends happened to be both very much into the market. One of their fathers was a stock
135.46s: broker. I opened an account with him and just the people around me were in. Now my dad had no money.
140.02s: Okay, I don't want to confuse things. My grandfather had like, you know, 38 shares of that
143.30s: ballet or something. There we go. But my buddies were very into it and we studied the markets.
149.70s: The crash of 87 happened. I took four and a half years because I was persistent
155.06s: and to get there to graduate. In 87, I graduated. The crash really shaped me and I,
161.22s: when I did an interview for a job as a stock broker, which I didn't realize was a call,
165.54s: a cold call cowboy, wasn't a stock broker. There was no, you know, analysis going on. It was a
171.06s: sales job. I was hired and I was a loser in the markets for many years and one day I went to
178.90s: the 7-11 where they had space invaders, that was a ballet midway machine and I got an IBD
186.58s: and investors business daily and I read it and then I read the bill's book How to Make Money Stacks
193.14s: and that was the game changer. My life immediately changed. Number one reason was I let my losses run
200.26s: when I was a kid. This is the long time ago. Okay. This is 1987. 1988, 89. I was fascinated by the
210.02s: markets and what they could do and I love the interaction of whether news, innovation,
215.78s: interest rates, politics, I mean, everything. It fascinated me. I loved it and I,
222.10s: a meet after I started cutting my losses. I started to implement better selection criteria
226.58s: and then technical analysis and my results, well, I immediately stopped losing money.
231.78s: Like, and then with time in learning how to implement, my results started to get better and very
238.58s: good and very, very good and I eliminated the boom bust and I became more consistent and then I
247.54s: started occasionally every few years to tangle up into a very big stock and I made some pretty
253.86s: big money a couple times and that's the background, man. Yeah, it's awesome. It's so fascinating to
260.26s: me how many people I talked to on this that have so many similar aspects to their background and
265.78s: how this whole thing started. I think, you know, as you're talking about your just general interest
270.58s: in the connection between things, I 100% I'd benefit with that. It's like looking at the markets is
275.46s: one of my favorite ways to learn about our world because especially like all these different
280.50s: news sources are so political like you never can figure out like what the fuck I'm reading.
284.66s: But then when I'm reading about anything from a financial perspective, like they don't give a
288.90s: shit. Like if it makes dollars, it makes sense if it doesn't, it doesn't, but it's like typically
292.66s: a pretty decent way to consume information and the other thing you said that I really identified
296.58s: with is the disposition effect where traders tend to let losses run cut winners too short.
301.94s: I think that's like one of the first pivotal things that we all eventually change. So it's funny
307.06s: that you highlighted that one as well. Quick follow on question for you. When you first read Bill
314.26s: O'Neill's book, did you look at this optimistically and like did it click and you're like, oh,
320.10s: I've been doing this wrong. I think this will work or was it more of a I don't really know.
325.14s: Let me just try. See if it works. I'm curious how you approach the world of technical analysis
329.62s: specifically because a lot of people they'll say it's either voodoo or it's not, you know,
334.02s: that kind of stuff. I need to tell you a little bit about my disposition. I am very questioning
341.22s: account or intuitive. And if you tell me no, that means I'm going to do that. And my buddy gave me a
347.30s: book called a random walk down Wall Street. And I read it and I'm like, this is bullshit.
352.82s: I said, this is right for most people, but not except not people who are willing to do things
357.94s: that others aren't. And then I read about people who are the outliers. And I said, most people
362.74s: never be an exceptional outlier because they won't apply themselves. So I read Bill's book.
368.10s: And there are many styles. Many there's probably 30 styles on how to invest. You have to find one
374.26s: that resonates with your nature. It's got to agree with your DNA. There are a lot of styles that work,
380.42s: but they won't work for the wrong person or they won't work if doesn't agree with you. And it
383.78s: agreed with me very well. And I coach so well. And I felt like through the book Bill was talking to
389.78s: me. And then I started to go to see him to when he would speak. Initially, he would speak for
395.06s: free. And then the price went to 300 bucks, then 500, then 10,000. And I went to see Bill probably
402.82s: two to three times a year starting in around 1990-ish until a few years ago. And so I also became
413.86s: an institutional customer of William O'Neill when I opened my first hedge fund where I would talk
418.18s: to Bill all the time. I mean, so I'm trying to answer your question. I might have gotten
423.62s: down a little bit of a tangent. No, it was perfect because essentially you were helping me understand
429.62s: how you approached the methodology and how it resonated with you. Because like I said before,
434.10s: when I actually just interviewed Tom Sausneroff not too long ago another time who's a big
440.50s: options trader not sure if you're familiar with him. He runs up pretty big network. And he came
445.78s: from the pits. And for him, he built Thinkor Swim, which is a pretty popular platform. And like when
451.06s: they first built it, it didn't have charts because they never used them. They all thought charts
455.94s: was like fucking wizardry. So the a lot of people I find have like this polar relationship with
464.34s: technical analysis, but it sounds like it really resonated with you. Like when you looked at it,
468.26s: you're like, this makes sense. I can get behind this idea. I think if you look at the book,
476.02s: all the market wizards books, you look at all the greatest traders in the world. There's only one
480.90s: that I'm aware of Michael Steinhardt who was a fundamentalist. All I don't like apps in terms.
487.22s: Everyone I'm aware of, Altaidist Steinhardt was a trend follower. And charts are a visual way
493.94s: to follow a trend. I don't really think charts are predictive. I think charts give you a clue
501.14s: of the trend and trends fail. Most trends fail. Most breakouts fail. Why is why risk management is
509.94s: so critical? That's kept me in the business for 30. I don't know. I started in 87. So whatever. How long
514.58s: that is? I don't know. If you try to trend follow when you don't have risk management, you're going
520.50s: to wipe out quickly. It's, in fact, the market will seek its level. It will find your weakness.
528.98s: If you're greedy, if you're impulsive, if you're fearful, if you're, I mean, whatever your weakness is,
537.46s: the market is going to expose you quickly. And you're going to learn about yourself very quickly.
542.82s: You're going to take a lot of losses and a lot of bruises. The number one key to spot a liar
549.22s: is I'm great. I'm the greatest. I'm killing the market. I've killed it every year for a thousand
553.38s: year. Lying. You talk to the greats and they are except for one or two that I know of. And the one
560.42s: guy who thinks he's great has not made any money. The other one is kind of great. And he has made
566.18s: a lot of money, but he's vocal about it. But people who are arrogant, the market will pound you
571.78s: down. It's going to beat you down. And you, the market teaches you to be cautious and careful
579.38s: and not arrogant. The market will expose your arrogance if you're, you know, I mean, so anyway,
584.90s: there's another giant tangent for you. I love that tangent because I think, and that's one of
591.22s: the biggest things I always hypothesize trips a lot of technical traders up is when they apply
595.70s: their analysis, they start to say like this should happen. And they kind of create their own
601.06s: reality on what they think should happen completely for going the fact that the market doesn't give
605.94s: a flying fuck what they think should happen. It couldn't possibly care less. And to your point,
612.02s: that's where a lot of not speaking an absolute. It's so funny when you said that because I 100%
618.10s: resonate with that. I refuse to because if I'm looking at a chart, I actually like to apply
622.50s: technical and not, but I always view it as like probabilistic outcomes based on what I see,
627.78s: what is more probable here or what's the risk to reward here, not a determinant this should happen.
635.14s: May or may not. I don't know. The most technical patterns, whether it's a head and shoulders or
641.86s: a cup and handle or whatever you want to call it, the pattern will morph before it emerges out of
649.78s: the pattern. You think it's going to emerge out of. So that's why jumping the gun is such a flaw.
656.42s: And that's what I want to say. Yeah. So speaking of your kind of approach here and obviously you're
666.98s: talking a little bit about the specific timing element, everybody that I know that trades can slim,
672.50s: they tend to have their own twist on things. You know, they don't necessarily apply like purely what
679.62s: they see in the book. So based on your approach to canceling what's what does that look like?
685.78s: Is it a pure play based on what I've seen you talk about it doesn't necessarily seem that way.
690.82s: But I'd love to dive into kind of your approach to canceling. So I think the Japanese had it right.
698.82s: Why invent anything? I am a knockoff artist of a someone who's well known who is not a snake oil
706.66s: sailsman salesman who probably made a billion dollars. And if he didn't pay so much in taxes like
711.78s: Buffett, he probably worth billions. If I'm half as good, half is good. And I only make 500 million.
720.66s: I'm probably going to be just chill with that. I am a not I don't deviate. Now there are some things that
726.02s: I've learned that I do apply, but they're almost tertiary. There's things about the market that I've
733.46s: learned that Bill didn't cover in the book. And I just I just knocked him off. And why deviate?
740.66s: If you want to build a birdhouse, why draw it up on a piece of paper yourself and you give by a book.
745.86s: And the guy's going to tell you exactly how to build the most beautiful birdhouse ever. Now again, the saying
755.46s: this difference between a hero and a crowd is one step forward. If you do what everyone else does,
760.42s: you're not going to be exceptional. But I'll respond to that with I saw Bill live in a room of 400
766.10s: people in it. And he goes, how many people only buy new highs? I raised my hand and not a 400 people
772.66s: that were like five. The rules, the book reminiscences of a stock operator was written in the 1920,
778.90s: 100 years ago, roughly. The the the the the manual is there, but people can't follow it. They either
787.14s: don't have the emotional intelligence, don't have the perseverance, don't it, you know, there's a lot
792.26s: of reasons people fail, but the the road map is there. So I am saying I don't want to you know,
802.66s: build the clock again without the manual, but I want to follow the manual. Most people don't
806.82s: won't do that. And Bill doesn't talk enough about emotional control. Which is really like I said,
814.34s: the manuals there, the it works, but you can implement it because they don't have the discipline,
819.14s: they don't have the patience, they're emotionally, you know, they're trying to survive. Okay, think
824.42s: about the and I'm a huge Republican. Okay, I was going to say it, but I sympathize greatly with
829.86s: a single mom with two children and a deadbeat ex-husband. How much, you know, what is her ability to get
837.78s: you clothes fed off to school, work grass off all day, get you guys home from school, get you dinner,
843.22s: and then hit her second job. We're in there, does she get to read Bill's book and then implement it
847.70s: and get 10 grand to start trading with? Like, you know, there's a you have to be in the right
853.86s: position and I believe you make your own outcome. I totally believe in self-responsibility. You're
859.14s: you are where you are because the decisions you made, nobody else, everyone has curveballs. The
863.70s: meteor flies out of asteroid flying to life and smash your shit. That happened, it's how do you
869.14s: handle that? How do you overcome that? The losses I took when I was young were horrendous. It was
874.34s: emotionally beating, but I never gave up. Ever, you know, even I have bad years now.
881.46s: You know, I've been in the business since 87 to today. I probably have a bad year. I want to say this.
889.30s: People who lie say I'm up 30% every single year. Well, that's not possible with the method we use.
899.38s: If you're you're going to have very big years and then small losses in years, that's why
904.90s: Grooney made off suckered everybody because he promised the Holy Grail, which was unattainable. It was
910.42s: 1% a year, I'm sorry, 1% a month every month with no down months. It's impossible.
918.10s: Sounds good though. Yeah, it's great compound. You compound 12% out of year for 50 years. How much money?
925.06s: Months. Literally tons. I think and that's actually funny that you bring that up because that's
930.98s: one of the things I've always revered about the way you guys trade is because you have this
936.34s: streakingness in your performance. Like when I talked to Matt, I came across as US investing
940.50s: championship performance, which is like 300 plus percent in a year. So I trade derivatives.
945.86s: I trade both sides, primarily options, sometimes futures depending on the product, but like my best
951.38s: year ever was just over 50 percent, which I'm super proud of that, but that's still like a sad, sad
957.78s: comparison to what you guys can produce. But I don't know. I don't know. You know, what are your
964.02s: down years? Like if you can keep your down years, it will single digits and you have a 50% year,
968.26s: every five years, and you have a bunch of 20% years, your 50% is huge. 300% with a 200% drawdown,
978.66s: or you know, an 80% drawdown. That's nothing. 50% up years with 9% max drawdowns,
985.86s: you're going to make money. Definitely. Yeah. And it's that's essentially what I've built my entire
990.74s: world around is the vast majority of the down years are small and they're super and frequent.
995.94s: Now I had down years when I first started, but to be also very clear, I've seen 50% once. So
1001.78s: I have most of my time. It's somewhere in the 20s. So it's still very, it's still really good for me.
1007.62s: I'm 32. I'm in the market since 2007. So 16 years.
1014.66s: You're 100% years coming. It's in front of you.
1020.18s: Well, I'll keep looking for it because it hasn't popped up yet, but I'm eager.
1026.58s: If you wanted it'll come. Yeah. Well, and that's actually one of the cool things as the
1031.38s: account has grown is I'm really receptive to different approaches. So for a while, I traded a lot
1037.14s: of volatility. Valtility trading can be very boring. It's a more of a numbers thing and it's
1041.70s: an aggregate, but it's very consistent. But I started developing different strategies.
1047.70s: Still be a derivatives that let me take advantage of some of the things that you guys like to look at.
1051.22s: So that's what I want to spend a little more time on. So you talked about there are things that
1056.10s: you've learned that build didn't cover in the book. One of them you were talking about how you
1060.58s: wanted him to talk more about emotional kind of side of things. But what are some of the specific
1064.66s: market things that you've amassed over your career that you don't think Bill covered in the book?
1071.38s: I am very much like Bill, a tremendous optimist. But I'm not a permabull. I will go to cash,
1082.10s: but I understand there's bad periods. And Bill said, look, in a downtrend, you have to go to cash.
1088.90s: But he never really explained about the magnitude of how long bears can be and how brutal they can be.
1094.34s: And if you're not careful, how much you can lose, he said, look, just color your losses 7% and walk away.
1100.42s: And he didn't really go into the pain you're going to endure even the greats if you persist in this
1107.22s: endeavor. There's a, oh, God, you know, I could go through my thing and find some gym rules for you.
1113.38s: I have 65 Bill rules. Bill's golden, since Bill's no longer with us. I now have the gym rules,
1119.38s: which I probably know are near as valuable as the bill rules. But maybe I'll look some up,
1123.06s: will you ask me another question? How about that?
1124.90s: Yeah, yeah. I definitely want to hear more about the gym rules. So, yeah, when I think about a lot
1130.26s: of what Bill taught me, it definitely was looking for strength. It's not really accepting anything less.
1137.94s: And one of the things that he really encouraged me to adopt is a difference psychology when it came to
1144.26s: specifically for bullish plays. But when I'm looking for bullish plays, I'm looking for reasons
1148.74s: to say no. And as soon as I see one, then that's the reason it's time to move on to something else.
1153.14s: Whereas I feel like a lot of retail traders, it's the inverse where they're trying to convince
1157.94s: themselves to say yes. So when you're hitting a home run here, okay, there's 55 public,
1166.10s: 5500 public companies, I am distilling that down to like four. I am so selective beyond
1176.34s: incredible selectivity. I am looking for excellence across the board in all metrics.
1183.78s: I won't put a trade on unless I feel I am being forced to buy or forced to sell. I don't ever
1192.50s: anticipate I over after cutting losses, which is the rookie mistake of rookie mistakes, not
1199.38s: cutting losses. The second biggest rookie mistake is overtrating. And I over trade like a champion.
1205.06s: I was a rock star at everybody. Every trade used to get a confirmation in the mail.
1209.70s: And it was like a blizzard flew into my house when the mailed guy showed up. Anyway, I
1216.26s: need the market to force me into it. And the more I trade, the more I lose, the more I get
1224.02s: emotionally caught up in things, I'm no longer trying to pull the arm on the slot machine.
1229.30s: I am not trading the less I trade, the better I do, the more patient to I be patient,
1235.62s: emotional control, discipline, long durations, outlooks, look 20 years down the road in
1241.62s: I'm going to be doing this for 20 years or more. These are all the reason people fail is all those
1245.70s: reasons right there, man. So do we have some some gym rules? Yes. Perfect.
1254.02s: Well,
1256.10s: while scenarios are so abundant, but the markets are lie detectors and fair it out the truth.
1262.26s: Price does not lie or it can't lie for very long. Think about the invasion of Ukraine,
1267.70s: expectations were food and energy shortages. Like they were talking about in Germany,
1272.26s: they were going to freeze the death in the winter. Yes. And there was going to be, you know,
1275.30s: the price of wheat was going to go to 50 million dollars of bushel. Price of wheat went down.
1279.78s: And no one frozen Germany. Okay. I mean, I can go on and on and on about just false narratives.
1287.22s: You have to remove your personal bias and forget the news and follow the price. But you can get
1294.90s: really scared by there's going to be starvation. Like literally, you're talking about wheat prices,
1299.70s: Russia's, sorry, Ukraine's the fourth largest wheat producer in the world. And you know,
1303.94s: that's what a lot of people like subset they live on didn't happen. Let's see here. I can,
1314.66s: you know, the greatest trader in my view is Stan Druckenmiller. He makes mistakes. He in 2020
1323.78s: got it wrong and he didn't make money. Oh God, I, you know what?
1329.14s: Look, I hear something. Bill didn't really talk about this as much as I thought, but the average
1339.14s: true market leader goes up about 94 to 98 weeks. It's it's four to six beat and raise quarters.
1346.98s: The death, my definition of a true market leader is four to six beaten raised quarters. If you
1353.70s: can get in a stock in the right size and sit that that's how you're going to make an absolute
1360.42s: killing. And the the stocks that I've made the most money in were all through beaten raised
1364.90s: quarters. It was Bill stressed earnings and earnings growth. But he rarely talked about
1372.42s: beat and raise. The reason stocks move is because there's an earnings report. They beat,
1379.54s: now the analysts have got to raise guidance. Do you know the estimates were a dollar. They blow it
1384.66s: away. The next year they had to for two dollars. Well, they got to raise it to three. Now that new
1388.58s: information has got to be discounted into the price and up goes the price. That's how you get beat
1393.38s: and raise or I'm sorry, that's how you get prices to move. The new information now has to be
1398.18s: factored forward. You know, Bill never talked about volatility contractions. Like the Bitcoin
1406.18s: market right now is dead. The volume is dead. No one cares. AI has stolen Bitcoin's thunder.
1414.66s: The story of Bitcoin has only become richer and the contraction and volatility. We're at some
1420.98s: of the lowest levels of Bitcoin volatility in history. Along with whale accumulation. But anyway,
1428.10s: dude, I don't I have to really sort these out because there's so many of them and I don't want
1432.34s: to waste your time. Well, I read looking for them. I honestly, I like those ones that you shared
1437.30s: anyways, but oh, Bill was a very heavy, Bill was a very heavy user of margin, which he talked about,
1444.42s: but he didn't talk enough about it. He didn't talk enough about money management either. He would say,
1450.66s: oh, you have an account with the hundred grand should buy four stacks. Like he didn't, he said, his
1455.70s: money management was, you really shouldn't know more than seven rate stacks. Like he didn't
1462.34s: go into that enough. Man, I do know how about I'll send you a couple of them. You can post it
1474.10s: up on your website or when I love that. Yeah. Well, and you actually just hit another thing I wanted
1479.46s: to ask you about, which is, you know, exactly the way that you think about managing your book
1485.54s: because to your point, if you want to catch these big runs, you can't be too spread out, right?
1491.06s: If you have a little bit in a ton of different things, you get a giant move. It doesn't really
1494.34s: fucking matter. But if you're too centralized, then obviously that presents its own issues. So how do
1499.70s: you find that balance? This is an unbelievably good question because in markets like we're in right
1506.74s: now, size kills, size kills, size kills in many ways. Most great money managers attract so much
1516.90s: that their performance is diluted. It's like putting center blocks on an Olympic athlete. He is
1521.38s: an Olympic athlete, but you wait a professional money manager down with too much. You know, I think
1526.82s: can slim in a large scale is difficult to run over a hundred or two hundred million dollars.
1534.58s: There's not enough liquidity in today's market due to the amount of takeovers and mergers and
1539.38s: buybacks. This supply stock is shrunk. So liquidity's gone and you took out the specialist and the
1544.58s: market makers and now it's run by algos. There's not enough liquidity. Like you being in the futures
1549.46s: market, you could scale futures account into the billions. You really could. So what was the question?
1555.94s: Well, quick caveat there, everybody. Eric is not scaling into the billions just throwing it out
1560.74s: there. But not yet. No, I was asking essentially how you find the balance between having too big of a
1570.18s: book where if you get your move, it doesn't really matter versus having too small of a book where
1575.86s: you can get ran over if you're wrong. I just think Bill's stated method is very difficult for
1584.50s: most people to implement because price will hurt you but size will kill you and Bill stresses
1594.42s: concentration. But I literally will trade 100 lots in testing a new bull trend and I'll trade
1604.10s: 400,000 shares in bull markets in one stock depending on the price. I'm looking to put 5 to 10
1611.06s: million in each position. So I'll just tell you sorry. There was a computer system that was used
1617.06s: on the Chicago Stock Exchange many, many, many years back and this guy was the biggest trader on the
1620.74s: floor in Chicago. He looked three doors down for me. I told him I had 27,000 shares of
1626.50s: seabull systems in my personal account and he looks at me and that's just a long time ago. He goes
1631.46s: son, he goes, I don't know how much money you have. He goes, but that sounds like an awful lot of
1635.54s: stock and he goes, I'll just tell you price will hurt you but size will kill you and he was right.
1641.06s: And I got stopped out of my whole position and lost money on a stock that went up like 800%.
1646.82s: And then I did it again in a stock called TheraGenix. It took a lot of me touching that hot burner to
1652.26s: learn this lesson. On the other side of things, I think if you get more than 12 stocks or something
1657.78s: around that position, you become the index. So it's hard to beat the index when you almost
1665.06s: are the index. If you want to have outsized gains, you need to really concentrate that down to
1672.42s: still end those big leaders, but now your volatility is going to go way up. Okay. So Bill didn't
1680.66s: bill traded around his positions a little bit, but he didn't hedge and I do. When a stock gets
1688.66s: extended, the bill never really talked about this very often. You need to understand the
1693.78s: personality of a stock. And if it's personality is at 20 or 30% over the 50 day, it pulls back to
1699.46s: the 50 day, you better start hedging because if you have quarter of your whole account in a stock
1703.46s: and it goes down 30% and it only goes to a normal place, which is perfectly healthy, can you take
1708.82s: that drawdown now throw margin on there? And let's assume that your other stocks are going to pull
1713.70s: back the exact same time because the general market's probably going to be in a digestion. Bill didn't
1718.90s: explain volatility and it looked, Bill made me. All right. My three hedge funds, my net worth is
1725.54s: predicated on Bill. Bill speaking directly to me, paying attention to me, me knocking him off.
1731.46s: I'm not knocking Bill. I'm just saying he should have told me the pain I was going to go through to
1735.70s: get here. Yeah, definitely. Well, and still to your point, I find the same thing like I am
1742.90s: woefully unoriginal myself. And a lot of what I did was predicated actually on a like a
1748.10s: a mentor I found online. So it sounds like the start of a child predator scheme, but it's not.
1753.14s: It was a great, he was an army dude. That was just helping me out. But he was an option straighter.
1757.86s: But it's the same exact thing where I feel like there's things that I've learned on my own that I've
1763.46s: been able to apply and kind of adapt. And it sounds like that's what I took from what you were
1767.46s: saying is that you still are an autonomous thinking human being, digesting information and
1771.86s: integrating that into your process. When you look at these stocks and they're starting to run up
1777.70s: 20, 30% above the 50 day moving averages, how are you looking to hedge them? Are you taking
1782.50s: size off or you're using options? Are you putting on counter opposing trades? What's the hedge?
1788.66s: I don't like to pay taxes. 50% of the money goes to the government. You talk about compounding
1794.82s: with your fall your money or knock that down to long term gains at 20%. So I don't want to dislodge
1800.34s: my stock, especially my low cost stock. So I'm going to be selling in the money calls.
1807.30s: And then if I'm right in the stock, come by the way, I don't ever want to hedge my whole position.
1812.74s: Because what if it blows off? All right, I'm going to hedge. I used to hedge like 20% and I realized
1817.94s: that's nowhere near enough to dampen the effect of the pullback. So I'm generally going to hedge 30 to
1822.66s: 50% of my long position within the money calls. That way, the volatility and the premiums going to
1830.82s: time and volatility premium works for me. It erodes. So I have that going for me. It's in the money.
1836.50s: It's generally I try to, you know, like 80 delta calls in the money short. Super deep.
1842.58s: Yeah. Now the spreads big. But how else are you going to keep your stock and hedge yourself down
1848.50s: 10, 15% or more? 10%, 5%, 10%. So that simply I sell calls and I will trim off stock.
1856.82s: Like this correction we're in right now was far greater than a garden variety pullback in a
1862.42s: bit of bull market. There's a lot going on. We can discuss that at the end.
1866.98s: Yeah. Yeah. Well, it is. And that's another thing I did want to start getting your take on
1871.30s: anyways. But before then, there was a couple of questions I had from some of my community for you.
1877.22s: One of which is when you're looking at the various can slim factors, how do you wait them?
1885.38s: Are there some that you personally apply heavier weight than others? That kind of thing.
1893.14s: Before I tell you this, you're talking about the fundamental metrics. I am a fundamentalist.
1899.70s: I am a story. I understand Celsius, case growth, unit growth, total addressable market.
1906.98s: More than I do. But once I have the story down, I'll just state this. I probably made about 90%
1914.02s: of my net worth and about eight stocks in 35 in 3035 years. I understood the fundamentals
1923.22s: intimately in every one of them. Like I really, really, really deeply understood what was going on.
1928.74s: But as soon as I get that clear, let's just take that off the table.
1933.22s: Relative strength, group strength, general trend of the trend of the general market.
1939.54s: Relative strength is going to take you right to the best names in the whole market.
1944.58s: Anybody looking at stocks, it's like here, forget there's no money involved.
1949.86s: You can pick for free a Vega or a Hugo or a Lambo or a Ferrari. What are you going to take?
1956.02s: I'm always going to go to the high relative strength for our ease. I don't want to let you go.
1959.94s: I don't want to vote swagon. Relative strength is like a divining ride right to the water with all the
1966.42s: money in it. Group strength up to down volume is wildly misunderstood or underutilized.
1976.26s: A cumulative distribution earnings growth and earnings beat. That is, it's just like why would
1983.06s: a stock go up if it wasn't expecting earnings growth and earnings beat. It's like I call it the
1988.42s: cockroach theory. If you're going to look in an apartment and a cockroach comes out from
1992.18s: onto the floor, rest assured there's 10 more under the counter. Earnings beats are not one off
1999.06s: occurrences. They are usually serial earnings beats and repeat. Now you can not lean into that too
2006.50s: much. They have to materialize. But when you have an earnings beat because of some new product,
2011.54s: what do you think people are just going to run to the shelves and clear them off for one quarter
2014.74s: and then they're never going back again? No, people are going to tell them the people. That's going to
2018.98s: be an 18 month story at least. There's relative strength up to down volume, group strength,
2028.50s: tight. Now I'm going to go into technical. Weekly closes in the chart pattern is prevalent in nearly
2037.54s: every, I didn't use every, I said nearly. I don't paint myself into a corner like a marina is about
2042.74s: to get killed. There are just if you look at historical charts of the biggest winners in history,
2050.34s: they have tight areas from two to five weeks and Baker Hughes right now just came out of and came
2057.94s: back and broke out of about a five weeks tight area. Now what's it now for them? Say that again.
2063.78s: Be our ticker for them. Be AR on a weekly. Yeah, I'll grab it and then we can take a quick look to
2073.54s: if you want. I can share my I got it. And you said you want to use a weekly chart. Yes, sir.
2082.18s: Three years, five years. What tickles your fancy? That's perfect right there. Look, look at your red
2087.78s: key. Go back five, six, eight weeks and it's start the first red week. There's two red weeks.
2092.82s: Keep go to the right. Go right, right, right, right up in the handle. Keep going. I'm on there.
2098.26s: Yeah, look at those tight closes. One, two, three, four, is it four or five? It would be better on
2105.22s: a bar chart and I don't want to waste time going to it. Five weeks in a row. You know, rarely.
2112.02s: Yeah, it's five. Yeah. And the group is number the group strength is like, you know, out of 200,
2118.42s: it's like three out of 200. It's it's almost it's elite elite group oils on a run.
2125.38s: Um, I, I, my fund does have a position. I've been reducing it. Um, my lawyers love me that I
2132.18s: just told you that. You gotta give them work. You gotta give them a job. Look, they can make their
2139.38s: money up, building somebody else for a freaking lawsuit. I don't need one. Um, anyway, tight closes are a
2147.86s: look, can slim is predicated on a detailed study of the biggest winning stocks in history and what
2153.86s: characteristics did they possess? And it's all in Bill's book can slim. It's all there. Now, the one
2160.74s: thing is a gentleman I know in a mirror crawl found that something like 30 or 40% of all big winning
2167.70s: stocks have no earnings, which is contrary to can slim. The difference is that when you have no
2175.06s: earnings and you get into a bad market or a bear market, those stocks get pummeled more, right?
2180.42s: Earnings bring durability and earnings bring institutions. And when there are no institutions
2186.90s: in your stock because there's no earnings and somebody goes into dump 400,000 shares, who's there
2192.10s: to buy it? If, you know, fidelity says I'm bid for five million shares literally. They're there
2200.58s: to absorb your shares. But when you're looking at some market cap stock at three billion dollars
2206.66s: and somebody wants to dump 300, 300,000 shares, there's no institutions in there.
2210.74s: Earnings bring institutions, earnings bring liquidity. So there's a bunch. Yeah, well, and it makes
2218.10s: a ton of sense too because I think, I mean, you can look at, you know, aggregate numbers of
2226.42s: performance, but then I think there's you have to, you know, an interesting follow on study that
2231.14s: comes to my mind for that is what's the probabilistic outcomes out of the total pool, right? Because
2236.58s: my guess is, probabilistically, there's likely a higher percentage that have earnings versus not.
2241.94s: But you might have a large raw number with earnings. That would be my guess.
2247.62s: I look, it's much easier for me to sit when I know there's earnings.
2254.42s: Right. You know, biotech, I've been obliterated in biotech and I've made a fortune in biotech
2261.06s: in a few conferences. But most biotech companies are research laboratories with no sales force.
2269.46s: They're, they're, they're not even a product. They're working on a product. And if you go
2274.18s: through clinical trials and they don't pass the FDA approval, goes to zero, basically almost
2280.58s: goes to zero. Now, once you have an FDA approval and then sales occur, the amgens first
2290.58s: reported earnings, second reported earnings, four quarters forward work, 32 cents against a penny.
2299.78s: That's when they invented a epegid, okay? That was the beginning of the move where the
2306.42s: stack went to Mars. It basically changed the world of medicine. If you had AIDS or you were going
2312.18s: through chemo, your red blood cells were being run down. You did they injected you with this
2316.42s: stuff and it ramped your red blood cells. So you could take more chemo, live longer with AIDS,
2321.46s: it was a gain changer. And then they came up with Nupogen, which is a white blood cell replenisher.
2326.82s: It changed medicine. That was not going to be a one quarter earnings beat. And that stack
2332.26s: went to Mars versus some company that has no earnings whatsoever. It's just like sales growth.
2337.78s: I have a rule, gym rule, that I won't put more than one or two per
2342.74s: stocks in my whole portfolio into earning no earnings growth stocks. When the market is being
2348.18s: led or augmented greatly by stocks that have no earnings growth, you're getting to a frothy
2353.86s: market. You get a lot of IPOs that have no earnings, you're late in the game. The IPOs that
2359.62s: are coming out now have earnings, okay? They are another rule. This is a rule.
2366.58s: When the IPO window is closed, the first deals to come out are elite, elite, the best names.
2376.50s: To in a bear market or after a bear market to get an institution to come up pony up cash,
2381.54s: they're only going to do that for the greatest stock of the world. They're not going to do it on a
2385.38s: maybe. They're gunshied to them and beaten up. So the best name you IPOs in bear markets are at
2390.90s: the end of bears or new bulls. Those are good probabilities of being TMLs. Again, I don't like IPOs.
2400.10s: 95 or 7% of all IPOs undercut their IPO opening trading day clothes within a year or two.
2408.98s: The odds are terrible. Most of them are small illiquid speculative. I'm looking for more durable
2414.74s: quality. You asked me variables. I'm backtracking. The comp rating. The comp rating is there for a reason.
2422.82s: If you're buying a stock that is accommodating below 90, there's something wrong with your stock.
2426.98s: It's not elite. When you were talking about the biotechs, I really resonated with that because
2435.86s: in trading volatility with options that spend a lot of time there. It's kind of like the sewers.
2441.94s: It's where things are not liquid. There's a lot of volatility.
2446.02s: Literally the way I've learned to hedge out risk in those kinds of trades is to just have a large
2453.70s: number of occurrences. Literally to have a large sample size. Sometimes even when you're trying to
2458.74s: find the fucking door, it's not there because there's no damn liquidity. The biotech thought process
2465.94s: you went down again, also very much resonated with me. I've spent a lot of time. But you learned a
2471.22s: lot of super cool things. That's the fun part there, I think.
2475.38s: Being in the markets, any daughter looks up their dad and overstates the grandiosity of the
2482.50s: father. My daughter is like, I asked you a question. You know the answer to all this stuff. No,
2487.38s: Sarah. I've been in the market for three or four million years. I've been in a trucking stock.
2492.90s: I've been in a biotech stock. I've been in a plastic stock. I know this much about everything,
2497.70s: but not enough to be valuable. Being in the markets is the most enlightening. I wonder
2505.22s: after understanding economics, I'm incompetent to work at the Federal Reserve. I'm not an economist.
2510.90s: I'm not that smart. But I understand economics enough to know a lot about the world and how the world
2517.30s: works. I look at people in Congress. I'm like, they are incompetent. They are incompetent to do their
2525.54s: jobs. The president made Ronald Reagan was not competent to be the drugs are, the housings are,
2533.14s: the leader of the military and all the other branches. But he brought in experts from that industry
2539.22s: that were in that industry for many years and were top dogs in that industry.
2545.94s: If you if your presidential cabinet is not loaded with people from industry, you appoint them
2552.74s: because of their clout or their donations, you're a charlatan. You're a schmuck. It's detrimental
2564.10s: to engine man. Well, it's fascinating because I find markets in general find people that can balance
2572.50s: theory and practical application, which literally transitions over from exactly what you were just
2577.06s: talking about is this idea of needing people with some level of experience of both. When you look
2584.90s: at your day to day habits, how much of it are you leaning on the theory of what you've learned
2591.94s: versus the practical application of the skill set? Because I know for me, I spend a lot of time in
2597.46s: theory up front understanding again, how derivatives work. All the different details because they're
2602.02s: very nuanced products. But then after a while, you kind of just have a feel for them. And I think
2607.54s: the feel, quote unquote, is a lot of subconscious processing that just is happening in the background
2613.70s: from that learned experience. But on a day to day, I have my things I look for, but a lot of times,
2618.34s: I can do a cursory overview and have a good quote unquote feel to whether or not this is the right
2622.82s: place for me to be. Do you find the same when you're looking for your stocks or is each and everyone
2627.46s: a very rigorous process? I find that finding stocks is easy by screening. It's just second nature
2635.14s: to me. The real battle is when the markets open and you're being fired at and your emotions are
2642.34s: running high, but I'm automatic. I have my stop losses. I know exactly where they are. I know
2647.38s: from history when it breaks the 50 down volume, I watching the, I know exactly what to look for.
2652.98s: But when the market's turning up, I have my Rolple report. I have my battle plan. You know,
2658.98s: I'm in the turret. I'm ready to go. I have the plan. It's right in front of me. So I don't have to,
2665.06s: I will run screens in the day for price up on volume. But I already know what those names are
2671.78s: because I did all my research on Sunday. It's a combination. Like there's another quote. It says,
2681.86s: education is pretty thin stuff without experience. And I'll say something else. You can talk a lot
2688.02s: and write a beautiful newsletter, but implementing whole another world, 90% of the game is implementation.
2697.14s: It's kind of like what it's nice and say, everyone's got a plan until you get punched in the face.
2700.74s: And the market is going to punch you in the face a lot. So it's a combination of both. It's both. It's
2707.94s: it's experienced. It's really disciplined to implement your plan. Whether it's canceling
2714.42s: or value or garper or whatever the heck you're doing, it's disciplined to not be led by your emotions
2721.38s: or scared by your emotions or become greedy because of your emotions. Like I said, the book,
2726.58s: you have options for a strategic investment behind you, green and white book. Okay, I read a book
2730.98s: a million years ago. Anyone can read that book and probably make money if they implement the
2737.22s: process. Yeah, I think it's totally fair. I think one of the things that would help people now
2747.62s: is there's unlimited information out there. And I think that people find themselves in just
2752.66s: analysis, paralysis, information overload. You can get to just this nintinoy level of detail
2757.22s: with everything. But you found a pretty efficient way to just generally call, you know, a large
2765.62s: sample or a large population into a small sample, right? You have like your criteria that you're
2770.18s: looking for. If somebody wants to get more efficient at scanning the market specifically for
2776.34s: canned slim style stocks, because that's your area of expertise, what are some of the introductory
2782.10s: scans you think they could start looking at on a daily basis? You mentioned price by volume.
2786.74s: I'm curious if there's a couple others, not necessarily for them to go start slinging trades,
2791.46s: but to develop pattern recognition, to develop an understanding of what things pop up in this pool
2797.06s: and what they generally look like. Minimum liquidity is an absolute must. And I use about a
2806.74s: hundred million average daily dollar volume below there is kind of that below 30 dollars a share,
2812.74s: below 100 million dollars dollar volume is getting into the junk heap. Let's go below 50 million
2819.70s: average daily dollar volume. RS above 80, 85. I don't even look at things below 90.
2826.58s: In my newsletter, I almost don't cover stocks with RS below 90,
2831.06s: comp rating, EPS in the 80s and 90s, at least, you know, I'm looking for 99.
2843.38s: Dude, you could, anybody can learn to scan with marketsmith in about a month.
2850.50s: When you generate those names, how do you handle them? When you have a big position on
2854.98s: and the market's pulling back because, you know, India threatened a new Pakistan overnight or
2861.86s: there was a skirmish in the South China Sea and the Chinese shot down over fighters and the market
2866.82s: gaps down thousand points on the open and you're long on margin. What do you do? Do you know what to do?
2872.02s: Have you done it before? Do you have your, do you have your stops all in place? Will you pull the trigger?
2876.82s: Or will you go, I know what's not going to be that big of a deal and then it goes down to
2879.86s: a thousand points the next day. I mean, the scanning and finding those stocks is the easy part. That's
2888.10s: you're not even, you're walking out of the dugout in the first inning to take your first swing.
2893.78s: That's not even swinging at the ball. That's just figuring out what equipment you're going to use
2897.94s: in the dugout. Where's your, what's your batting helmet? What bat are you going to use?
2901.30s: Now you get up to the plate. The guy throw will give you the chin music. You know, I mean,
2905.46s: you're swing outside the box. The implementation is process and emotional control is everything.
2913.78s: And I am, you have to learn how to screen and know what criteria you're looking for. But anybody
2919.54s: can tighten up those variables to where you're only generating 15 or 20 names.
2924.82s: Now once you have that, now what? You're going to buy it extended. You're going to buy it in the
2928.10s: bottom of a base or you're only going to buy it on a breakout when volume comes in.
2932.26s: Inflammation.
2936.18s: One of the things you mentioned, I forgot what podcast it was on, but it was actually really
2941.14s: insightful for me when you were talking about kind of this idea of like a true market leader versus
2946.90s: like the second and third place and how the difference in performance for the true market leader
2951.62s: can be up 300% and the second place guy can be like 150%. That's a massive difference between
2959.78s: first and second place. How do you find first place?
2964.82s: Screening forward is large, the matrix. Like if one has return on equity that's twice as good as
2970.02s: the other one, little details matter. A horse that wins at the racetrack wins by a nose, but pays
2978.42s: 20x, what the second place horse pays. I did a study from roughly 1950 call it the 2010ish
2988.34s: of every group, the top five leaders in the group, the percentage gains and the difference
2993.38s: between first and second and the difference between the performance of one and two was 100%.
2999.14s: How do you know? You screen for the matrix, but then the fundamental story. Which one is taking
3004.82s: over the market? Okay. Monster, which very few people know was one of the very best acts ever
3011.94s: in history. Celcius is now eating their markets. Knowing the story at Celcius is really important.
3019.94s: No, what's the total addressable market? Which company has the variables that are slightly better
3026.90s: than the other, the product? I mean, Bill would say to me, here's how I'll give you a bill gold.
3032.26s: I'd ask Bill a lot, should I sit through earnings? I mean, be like, have you been to the store?
3037.06s: Have you used the product? Have you been to Starbucks? Do you have confidence in it personally?
3041.46s: Do you count the cars in the parking lot? Using the product, having actual hands-on knowledge,
3047.14s: what's your level of confidence? How much cushion do you have for the year?
3052.82s: Is the market in a solid bull trend, a wishy-washy bull trend, or a bear market?
3057.78s: What's the environment? Are we in an irrational, exuberance market,
3062.82s: Alan Greenspan? Or are we in a full-blown bear with a pump and liquidity? These are all reasons
3069.46s: why you would hold through earnings. You have to assume every earnings report,
3075.30s: you could have a miss and it's going to gap down by over 20%. If you cannot tolerate that,
3081.70s: you cannot be in the stock. Or you have to hedge. Now, hedging into earnings is different than
3087.06s: her hedging into a pullback because I would probably rather buy puts or do a put spread
3092.66s: because I don't want to give away the upside. If I'm in that stock through earnings,
3095.22s: I think it's going to beat and I don't want to give up my upside. So I'm willing to pay the
3098.82s: big, but I'll actually probably sell the put a good bit lower because I don't want to pay all the
3105.22s: big. Right, right, right. Yeah. And by the point, I want to buy the slightly below the money put
3111.62s: closer to the money and sell the further. Yes. Because I just, dude, you know this, your futures,
3118.02s: dude. What, four out of five options are eight and a half out of 10 go worthless.
3123.54s: It's actually much lower than that. That's like a really,
3126.26s: my ankle. Yeah, it's a really, really miscominated statistic, but the vast majority are actually closed
3134.58s: before expiration. So it's like 60% plus are exited before expiration. And then
3140.58s: nine out of 10 out of 10, tell by retail, go to zero.
3144.02s: Well, that, that I think is pretty, pretty solid bet. Anything, anything, retail's fine. I think
3151.22s: you can take a pretty good guess on that. Another thing I wanted to ask you, which you started talking
3158.74s: about, but this is another question for my audience, which is one of the things I talk a lot about is
3164.10s: if people are looking to trade directionally, whether it's bullish or bearish, to look for the
3168.18s: corresponding sectors that are performing that way and then start narrowing down within those
3172.74s: sectors, just trying to stack as many things in favor of your thesis. How do you go about identifying
3180.02s: just market breadth and then what sectors you view are strong performing versus weak performers?
3188.42s: All right, net new highs, net new highs. The reason I never called this a bull market, I called it
3194.58s: at best a transitional bull. When the market started to go up in January, February this year,
3200.66s: the new highs never confirmed. Almost every most days throughout the year, we had negative net,
3206.42s: we had negative, we had net negative new lows over highs. We never got into bull confirmed status.
3213.14s: We had brief periods where they would new highs would elipse new lows, but not only that,
3219.70s: the new lows right now are getting into dangerous territory. We are not in every bull market has
3226.26s: pullbacks and that new lows exceed new highs, but they're marginal. 40 new lows a 100 new lows a day,
3233.22s: 50 new lows. We're running big numbers here. We're not in a bull market pullback according to new
3240.02s: highs new lows and the bull market never transitioned from a bear to a bull right there. Now that's one
3245.54s: thing you asked me to qualify. What was the other one on breath? You said breath and what was the
3249.14s: breath was the first one and then the other is just analyzing sectors to find what sectors you like
3254.26s: to the upside to the downside. I screened for everything. So I'm generally going to all of a sudden
3260.10s: start to come up with diverging RS or RS leading RS. I screened for that all the time.
3267.22s: Leading RS in a bear in a pullback is gold. It's pointing you right to what the market loves.
3273.62s: So leading RS is a great screen, but when you start running screens like that or up to down
3278.90s: volume over say 1.5, it's going to point you right to the leaders and also you're going to start
3283.70s: see a whole bunch of crappities. Whether they're you know shipping stocks or hotel stocks or
3290.26s: semiconductors and then I'll look at the group and then I'll distill down I'll break down
3295.46s: into what's the leader within the group. Now here's the issue. Anybody can find those
3300.34s: through screening, but how do you know which ones are viable and are you usually when you find it
3306.10s: you're going to be late and it's going to be really extended. That's the third biggest mistake
3309.70s: rookie mistake is buying extended. You're like I found the number one group. I found the leader
3314.42s: in the group. It's got everything, but now it's it broke out from it's 75. It's 95. Now it's 20 points
3319.46s: over the breakout from the digestion, but if you're a rookie just buy it and then it pulls back
3323.46s: and you're like it was the right name. It was the right sector, but your timing was off. You don't
3328.58s: understand congestion digestions. Bases, chart patterns form, they're just digestion. Whether it's a
3335.78s: flat base, a cup and handle, a double bottom, what having shoulders, there are congestion areas
3340.90s: with support and resistance. If you're buying extended from the last digestion, you're a rookie.
3347.78s: That's probably the fifth one. Now how do you balance, especially if these are longer term thesis,
3354.74s: right? Like if we're looking at a three year weekly chart, that seems like a pretty long thesis.
3360.74s: If there's a breakout and I actually remember spending a lot of time in Bill Nuel's book on this
3367.14s: because I found it so interesting, it seems fascinating to me how imperative it is to get that
3373.94s: initial timing right, even though this can be a really long thesis. It seems like it's a really
3379.78s: long thesis. You would give yourself more time, more variance, but obviously his argument is you
3386.42s: get to reduce a lot of risk if your timing is very good. So how do you find that balance between
3393.86s: getting your timing as good as possible, but then also getting into something that you're expecting
3398.26s: to run for the next year, whatever it is? Two things. Okay. The only time you're going to find a 99
3405.06s: comp stock with Skyhigh RS in a base is in a bear market because the second that bear market ends,
3410.90s: I call basket balls underwater, it's just going to pop straight up and it's going to be extended
3415.38s: a day. So if you don't catch it on that day, you're now buying extended and your risk is up.
3421.54s: Now the second part of it is it's not just enough to catch it at the right point, you have to
3425.86s: catch it in size. Probably one of the most underrated things and I can't overstress this.
3433.38s: You should make, I said this is really important. Well, cushion, the value of cushion
3440.02s: is that you can't understand how valuable it is. If you don't have cushion and you are using
3446.26s: risk management, you're living on a razor's edge. And if you're more on and you have a TML right
3454.50s: after a bear market and it's up 20% and you take that gain, now what? Now what's extended? How are
3460.34s: you getting back in? Over the 98.4 weeks, most TMLs go up like 400 to 1000%. And you sold it up 20.
3467.54s: At the end of the bear, fools move. So it's not just how do you catch it, not extended,
3475.70s: but you have to catch it in size because to have, if you have 10% of your account and stack that
3481.30s: goes up 100%, your equity moved by 10%. How often do you get 100% gainer? Well, then you better
3488.34s: have more than 10%. Now the problem is when you're transitioning from bear to bull and you're used
3495.22s: to buying probing positions of 100 lots, but you really intend to buy 200,000 shares, but you're
3501.38s: probing probing probing. So if you get traction, all of a sudden you get traction and you feel like
3506.42s: you're beaten down because you're probably down for the year, you've lost money, you're in a bear,
3509.78s: but you need to go put 20% of your whole account in a stack. At the right time, that is only done with
3516.90s: experience. No rookie, very few, I would, I will bet every time that you get a guy who reads
3525.22s: Bill's book at the end of a bear market, they are not going to get the right stock in the right size.
3528.98s: I'm not, I'm going to buy, in the transition phase, I'm going to buy five or six stocks initially,
3537.30s: probably by three on the follow through day. I'm going to have to, it's a, it's your building
3544.02s: positions. Your most stocks I buy, I, I'm wrong, six or seven out of 10, don't work, even when I
3550.74s: buy them on the breakout day. So that's three out of 10. It's just, it's a, it's a shifting matrix
3557.14s: only to be understood through time, understanding deeply where you are in the trend in the market.
3563.46s: What is the general mark? How is it acting? Is it appropriate now? These, these, this can take
3569.62s: decades to learn. Okay, it's, there's no, I just explained it to you in a very cursory fashion,
3575.70s: but to really learn it where you know, it's like catching surf. There's, there's normal waves,
3583.78s: then there's gigantic waves, and then there's waves that come around every five years.
3588.58s: Well, you have to stick around for 20 years to be through the five big waves periods to understand,
3594.74s: man, now it's time to throw the hammer down. Okay, we got to open fire. Right now, it's, it is go time,
3600.82s: you're in the breach, there's no flinching now, and it's worth the risk. That's when I can take risk.
3607.06s: I'm willing, because I know that the odds are high enough where if I'm wrong, it's worth taking that
3612.34s: risk, but in a crappy market, in a perfect 99 count stock that limps out of a base, I'll throw
3620.74s: something at it to test it. It's more of a test. I'm not even trying to make money. I'm trying to
3625.78s: determine if the market's ready for me to go all in. I'm waiting. It's like playing Texas Hold'em.
3630.18s: I'm waiting for the right setup. What do I have? What's showing it's early? And now I want to,
3635.46s: now I want to, well, I want to slow play it to get them all in, but I want, I need to ramp the,
3639.38s: I need to ramp that pot up. I need to make it worth my while. I just said about 50 things.
3644.90s: One of the things you said there, though, that actually really love to is just this idea of,
3649.14s: like, remaining engaged, because I do believe at least for some traders, a lot of people sometimes
3655.70s: go through periods where, especially the last few years, at least I know them, where they move to
3660.50s: cash, they're not doing anything. And then they get really gun shy to do anything again, because
3665.54s: they can't get the timing. They're not confident in what's going on. I actually really like this idea
3670.26s: that you employ up kind of putting out these small, fueler positions. One to see, you know,
3674.50s: what's working and to gauge the overall pulse of things. But two, I mean, it also gets you,
3679.38s: still moving. You're still doing things. And I don't know if you find benefit from that momentum
3684.66s: in your experience, but definitely from me, I find that useful. I'll find things sometimes that I
3690.98s: don't necessarily have the top most conviction in, but the probabilistic outcome still looks
3696.02s: reasonable enough for me that I'm interested in it. I'm going to just say,
3700.90s: I'm going to give you a little bit of my opinion. We're two and a half years into a bear market.
3708.66s: If this market makes a new low, it's going to be the fifth longest bear market in history.
3713.86s: And everyone is discouraged. The breakout, the last file today is failed. The markets acting
3720.02s: terrible. People are fearful and they're looking away. And they're going away. They're running away.
3725.06s: Exactly classic full rookie move. The major trends can occur, change in three to four days. It can
3735.46s: change everything can change. And now it's like, well, the war is escalating. The government's
3742.26s: probably going to get shut down. We have two idiots running for president. One's my idiot.
3746.42s: There's a lot of reasons to be very nervous right now. And the market is down trending down.
3753.06s: In four days, this market could look completely different. You're always three to four.
3760.90s: The simple answer, you asked me a question with like 10 sentences. I'm going to answer with one
3764.58s: sentence. You're always three to four days away from a major market turn up or down.
3770.66s: And right now, the feeling I get from talking to people seeing the market in my PNL
3777.38s: is we're getting really close to a new bull market. And everyone's looking out.
3782.74s: So you can't proper look away. The rookies look away. The guys who will never compound their
3788.66s: money for 50 years are looking away right now. The people who are still engaged in the process.
3794.26s: And I don't mean checking in. I mean studying a lot. They will be there. I learn this from a guy at
3802.90s: my club. I don't want to give you the full story because it's too inappropriate. But
3811.14s: he just said we're about to have a major market, a major move in treasuries. And he goes,
3817.46s: it's not there now. He goes, but I guarantee you I'll be there when it is. Now, whether it came or
3822.10s: not, it's not the relevant point. The point is he's a professional. And he'd been doing it for 30
3826.82s: years. He never looked away. I mean, dude, that's 30 more minutes on stuff. If you ask me one
3834.18s: question, I ran away for five minutes with the answer, which is perfect. That's what you're here for.
3838.90s: We're here to listen to you talk. Not me. I have a fucking YouTube channel. And people see me talk
3844.10s: all the time. So you're the star here. But you started actually diving a bit more into your
3850.50s: current market assessment, which I did want to spend a few minutes on. So you talked about kind of
3855.46s: this underlying sentiment that you think we might be turning a corner that there might be a
3859.46s: bull market potentially in the cards. It takes only a few days to see a big change. Talk to me a
3864.98s: little bit more about what you're seeing in the markets right now that give you that impression.
3868.90s: Okay, let me preface this whole thing with. Let's hear it. America is the single greatest country
3875.22s: in the world. Not by a little. It's the great history. If you're in India or anywhere Thailand,
3884.10s: and you come up with a great idea in the world, the number one choice for you to go and start your
3888.74s: company is America. And the number two choice is a wildly distant second choice. The world is
3894.58s: run by dictators, despots, thugs, criminals are in government. That's why the government works
3900.34s: around the world outside. In Europe, it's cronyism. In America, we have the freest markets in the
3905.62s: world. So I call it the golden goose a capitalism. The golden goose a capitalism is never going to be
3912.10s: unless it's suffocated by socialism. The golden goose is going to produce the next blackberry,
3916.58s: the next Starbucks, the next, what Wells Fargo United Airlines, Pan Am Airlines, IBM,
3923.22s: Hubert Packer, Digital Equipment, all these companies because in America, it's one of the only
3929.94s: places you can get rich and not in getting incarcerated or imprisoned or have it taken from you.
3936.82s: To a certain mistake.
3937.86s: To a certain mistake.
3941.06s: Did you're lucky if you're not too lucky?
3942.90s: Right.
3943.30s: Right.
3943.54s: But CEO of Luke Oils in Russia, sitting in prison, sort of $30 billion.
3948.02s: He's got to be jailed.
3950.02s: He's lucky that he just killed him.
3951.54s: But the golden goose a capitalism is never going to stop birthing these opportunities.
3957.70s: So you said it looks like we're going to have a bull market.
3961.38s: I said you said that.
3962.90s: It looks like we're going to have one now.
3966.58s: We're always going to have a bull market unless we get suffocated by socialism.
3970.26s: So there's always more.
3971.70s: The guy's out here in the labs in the science park not too far from here.
3976.50s: They don't care about a recession or a bad market.
3979.14s: They're mixing shit and test tubes and splicing atoms and writing code.
3984.50s: So the market, we just have to get the general market to get in gear here.
3990.26s: Now let's take a look at history.
3991.78s: I think the market topped.
3993.46s: Not when the index tapped.
3995.38s: It topped when the advanced decline line topped in February of 21,
4000.26s: which means we've been in a bear for two and a half years.
4002.98s: That is really long by historical standards.
4005.30s: Now you can fight with me on when.
4007.14s: But no matter how you look at it, you want to go from the top of the top of the
4012.34s: the top, the Russell made.
4014.66s: It's still long by historical standards.
4016.50s: And I think it's longer than that.
4017.78s: In order to assess where we're going to be, you can't look behind you.
4024.82s: You can't look at what's happening today.
4026.34s: You have to look what's going to be in 18 months.
4029.30s: This is Stan Druckenner.
4030.34s: In 18 months, the federal of crushed inflation.
4032.98s: The Fed is not going to screw this up.
4034.98s: They may kill the economy, but they are not going to let inflation get out of here.
4039.14s: They could break the economy, which would then we're going to have a recession.
4042.26s: But you know what, bear market or boom bear markets end in recessions.
4046.82s: People like it's a recession.
4047.70s: The markets are going up like I can't buy.
4049.86s: So anyway, the Fed at the very least will not be raising rates in 18 months.
4055.78s: They may raise rates two, three more times.
4058.18s: They might raise what they might not raise at all.
4060.66s: But 18 months from now, they are not going to be raising.
4063.78s: So monetary policy will be eight.
4066.66s: It may not be a tailwind if they're not cutting, but it's not going to be a headwind.
4070.98s: Again, this goes back to the Golden Goose of Capitalism.
4074.18s: I read a report from a very reputable source that said,
4077.14s: AI, just fastener seat belt for this number,
4080.98s: is going to increase global GDP by $15.9 trillion by 2030.
4091.78s: $15.9 trillion.
4094.02s: That doesn't include EVs.
4095.38s: That doesn't include biotechnology.
4097.38s: That doesn't include blockchain,
4101.70s: crypto digital revolution.
4104.50s: The innovation that we're sitting in front of right now is possibly the biggest I've ever seen.
4109.38s: The advent of AI is going to be bigger than the internet.
4112.90s: Okay, that's the promise.
4114.82s: And I have every reason to believe that it is not 3D printing.
4118.74s: Okay, it's not.
4121.86s: This is real.
4123.22s: If AI improves margins at most companies, but by three basis points, I'm sorry, by 3%.
4129.46s: What's that going to do to PEs and earnings growth?
4132.98s: What if it improves it by 8%?
4135.14s: Where will we be when the Fed stops raising rates,
4138.10s: a title wave of innovation, and now AI ramps everyone's margins up?
4143.46s: Where's the market going to be then?
4145.38s: But all they're looking at today is we might have one more rate hike,
4149.22s: and the government's going to shut down in a week,
4152.34s: and we've got two more runs running for president.
4154.66s: They're so short term.
4156.90s: If you're looking out a month, you're missing,
4160.26s: you're damn you're driving your car through the rearview mirror.
4162.74s: You're going to look through the windshield 18 months forward.
4164.98s: The world's going to be radically different.
4166.90s: We might, there could be some type of stalemate in the war in 18 months.
4171.70s: Russia won't have any people,
4173.06s: nobody, people left to fight the war.
4175.06s: They'll be dead.
4177.62s: The sentiment is incredibly ugly.
4181.06s: And I'm just telling you, those are my reasons.
4183.46s: And by the way, if you look at the indexes,
4185.62s: they remain in a massive cup and handle.
4188.42s: You want to look at the NASDAQ?
4189.46s: The only Russell, not the Russell.
4192.34s: There's another breath measure.
4194.34s: Until the Russell exceeds 2000,
4198.26s: we're not in a bull market, in my opinion.
4200.34s: We need to have net new highs overloads in excess of 150 a day every,
4204.58s: you know, most days, and maybe as high as 400 or 500 a day, net new highs.
4210.02s: So we're not there today.
4212.18s: But don't take your eye off the ball.
4214.18s: Okay?
4214.82s: If you decide to, you know, this is time to double,
4217.70s: re-double your efforts.
4218.74s: This is no time to be looking away.
4220.58s: This is if you're ever going to focus,
4223.54s: you focus to the end of a bear.
4225.14s: And I think we're very, very close.
4226.66s: If we have to go into the year,
4230.50s: I will be the most bullish person in the world.
4232.66s: That'll be three and a half years of a bear market.
4235.78s: Okay?
4236.34s: You won't be able to nail, you have to nail me down.
4239.94s: All right, I graced.
4242.90s: I actually think there's a lot of merit to your case.
4245.62s: I believe a lot of the way that you're positioning.
4248.58s: I got it.
4250.26s: Yeah, joking passively.
4252.90s: Oh, I know.
4255.06s: I can be so wrong, dude.
4256.42s: Listen, the markets could make a new low before this happens.
4260.10s: I'm not saying today.
4262.10s: Well, the part that I want to explore that you were talking about,
4264.74s: that I am curious how you value this.
4266.90s: And I'm going to put socks on now.
4268.42s: It's my future cold.
4270.42s: But do you think that the prospects of a recession could drastically extend the time frame
4279.06s: that we're in a bear market?
4280.26s: Because that's the thing that I agree with you in that.
4282.90s: I believe that the Fed is very likely to not permit persistent expanding inflation.
4288.90s: Like they've made that clear.
4290.18s: And I actually, that's like other than them starting super late in my completely
4294.66s: uneducated, unqualified opinion, I think they started trying to tackle this thing a little bit late.
4299.62s: I do think that Big Daddy J.
4302.26s: Powell has been pretty fucking clear about his mission here.
4304.98s: And he's been beaten that same goddamn drone the whole time.
4308.10s: So I give him a lot of credit for that.
4310.66s: But I am curious for the propensity here for us to have this overtightening cycle
4318.50s: that then puts a pretty big wrench in our ability to smoothly exit this
4323.94s: as compared to coming down in a fiery ball.
4327.30s: I really don't know either way, but I'm curious how you kind of think about the unwind.
4332.82s: So you're on to the lever that could extend this.
4337.86s: The odds are the Fed will overtighten.
4340.10s: That's historically the way they over they overlose in the overtighten.
4344.66s: We've had an inverted yield curve for over a year, at least a year.
4348.74s: The odds of a recession are but the counter to that.
4352.42s: Well, first of all, if we have it, depending on how deep it is,
4355.86s: people are going to have to slash at some p-ernie's.
4358.74s: And that's going to elongate.
4359.78s: I'm trying to say, yes, my answer to your question is yes,
4364.02s: a recession is going to delay this for a bit.
4368.18s: Depending on how deep that recession gets is going to predicate how deep
4372.10s: how much it pushes it forward.
4374.26s: But if we do that, think about the duration of this bear market.
4378.74s: You pull rubber band out like this.
4380.90s: It just goes back like that.
4381.78s: When you pull it out like this, it goes, bam.
4385.06s: If we have a bear market, a deeper bear because of a recession,
4388.18s: we're going to stretch that rubber band so hard when it comes back.
4391.06s: We're going to have a monster opportunity.
4393.14s: This will be a generational wealth opportunity.
4396.18s: But the other side of it is, and this is why the Fed is going to really,
4400.02s: well, oil could kill the market for the Fed.
4402.42s: Oil right now, the oil is the largest component of the CRB,
4406.26s: which is running rates, which is running the dollar.
4409.86s: Oil rates dollar, kryptonite, in an uptrend.
4414.82s: If the labor market is so strong,
4422.26s: the labor market, it's unbelievable how strong it is.
4425.94s: So there's this juxtaposed issues the Fed is trying to deal with.
4430.98s: I would not want to be the Fed.
4432.26s: They pay into themselves in no corner.
4434.26s: But they're going to win.
4435.94s: And they should remain independent.
4439.38s: Politicians are going to want a job on the Fed to loosen.
4443.78s: And Powell's got to hold his ground.
4445.46s: The nightmare scenario is that they start to loosen when inflation is not dead.
4449.94s: Now, I just don't think they're going to do that.
4452.98s: As much as I give them no credit, because they're generally trying to preserve their power
4461.54s: as opposed to do the right thing, I don't think they're going to screw this one up.
4465.46s: And if they do, I have to change my case.
4466.98s: And I am always in flux.
4470.58s: I laid out my bull case.
4473.06s: I've been doing this.
4473.94s: I figured it out because my math is so bad.
4476.42s: I've noticed for 38 years, my experience tells me we are at the precipice.
4483.06s: We're within on a long, if we have to wait a year for a bull, I'll be shocked.
4489.30s: But I will flex if the war breaks out into other continents,
4495.38s: if the Fed preemptively lowers rates and inflation ignites.
4501.54s: But I don't see that. That's not my base case.
4505.38s: So again, I'm really, really, really bullish.
4508.74s: My market temperature for a year out is a 10 max bullish short term.
4513.46s: I'm a two.
4514.98s: And after today, it's probably like a one and a half.
4518.18s: But I'm looking way down the road.
4519.86s: And here's the thing.
4520.74s: If I said to you, Eric, you have to wait nine to 12 months to double your money.
4527.30s: Are you okay with that?
4528.42s: Would you do that?
4529.86s: That's what we're looking at.
4532.34s: This is not going to be if the bull market breaks out in a month,
4536.02s: it's not going to be a garden variety bull.
4538.74s: If we wait a year,
4543.78s: I mean, dude, the opportunity almost seems like we want this to go on longer
4549.14s: because of that potential momentum up and out.
4552.34s: Well, you do.
4553.30s: If you, yeah, if you told me I have the choice between nine to 12 months to double,
4558.90s: four or five to wait 24 months to triple, I mean, I'll take the triple, triple and a half.
4564.74s: You're logical and willing to wait in your patient.
4567.54s: Most people want, right?
4568.74s: Like you know the game, they said, we're going to put a dollar bill in the middle of five people
4571.62s: every 30 seconds.
4573.22s: And the longer you wait, the more we'll put in.
4575.86s: And how long will they, until they grab the money?
4577.54s: They always screw that up.
4579.14s: Okay, people want it now.
4580.50s: And that's another thing.
4581.22s: People want to get rich quick.
4582.42s: They want to do it now.
4583.30s: They want someone to give them the stock idea.
4586.02s: Not the reasoning to find it.
4588.90s: People are just, lazy.
4591.22s: Are not very, you said about information and information overload.
4595.78s: It's not lack of information that people don't succeed.
4598.26s: It's like a desire to read the information.
4600.66s: And then it's like a discipline to implement it.
4602.90s: And it's like a perseverance to implement it for decades.
4605.86s: You wonder why people don't get rich.
4611.22s: So yeah, your case is right.
4612.98s: I believe your case strongly.
4614.34s: I'm going to run out of power.
4618.58s: Anyway, that's it.
4620.58s: Man, I believe strongly.
4621.86s: We are at my 30X years of experience.
4626.18s: Tell me.
4628.74s: Dude, people, not just anybody,
4632.02s: brilliant people, CEOs of major companies are saying,
4635.54s: AI is the greatest opportunity in our lifetime.
4640.02s: It is akin to the invention of electricity.
4643.22s: All right, this is a.
4645.86s: How do you balance hype, though?
4647.70s: Because to be clear, I am actually of the same exact opinion of you.
4651.94s: I really do think AI is revolutionary.
4654.34s: But I also saw all of these different metrics talking about how the metaverse
4660.50s: was going to be an $800 billion business within by,
4665.14s: I literally think it was like 2025 or 2030 or something like that.
4667.78s: It was like very quick.
4669.14s: And that one, I honestly didn't really believe in.
4671.62s: But still, I'm not the authority it could or could not happen.
4675.78s: But my point is, you know, people can get a little emphatic about things.
4680.98s: How do you structure that?
4683.62s: How do you value that?
4685.30s: I haven't bet it yet.
4686.74s: Marked in a downtrend.
4688.74s: When the trend turns up, I'm a trend follower.
4691.06s: And I'm going to follow it as long as it goes.
4694.98s: Okay, I watched the build out of the internet from ground zero IPO department at Morgan Stanley.
4700.98s: Okay, I took a lot.
4702.10s: I was involved in allocation of these deals.
4705.30s: I mean, I did palm.
4706.10s: I did red back brocade, tons of names, big names.
4710.74s: And I watched the internet get built out and I watched the companies come public.
4713.78s: And I watched what they did and I watched how Muslim didn't have.
4716.18s: I've seen this before.
4718.82s: This is not 3D printing.
4721.14s: Okay, and the one rule I read to you was,
4724.82s: think for yourself on face value.
4728.02s: Did the metaverse seem to me you like, I'm going to put,
4730.90s: you know, the most unsexy thing you want to repel the opposite sex.
4734.26s: Put head gear on your head.
4735.78s: Okay, it's just, it's like there's lagging them.
4738.90s: They're just paying the ass.
4740.90s: The metaverse is going to have some uses.
4743.94s: But on face value, when I looked at it, I didn't really,
4747.06s: I kind of wanted to get lowered into it.
4749.22s: But it's been the grandest failure.
4751.94s: AI is already changing SaaS companies.
4758.26s: Service now, Adobe HubSpot,
4762.58s: the Palo Alto for security, the AI in the drug discovery for biotech.
4770.34s: Now, this is, I believe this.
4772.50s: Now, I haven't bet it because there's being right.
4777.62s: And then there's being right at the right time.
4780.74s: And this is not the time to day.
4784.26s: But we get a follow through day late next week or early next week.
4787.62s: And if we do, I'm going to probe it.
4790.50s: And if I get traction, I'm going to build.
4793.46s: But if we make a new low into the fall,
4797.30s: into Thanksgiving, and you know, the IWC, the small, look,
4802.02s: IWC almost made a new low for this whole cycle.
4804.74s: The Russell is a base hit away for making a new low
4810.18s: for the cycle, which will definitively make this the
4813.94s: fifth largest bear market history.
4817.14s: Okay. So I believe it.
4820.26s: And I'm a huge optimist.
4822.34s: But until the trend can curves with my thinking or confirms it,
4826.98s: I don't bet it.
4827.70s: It's an I have an opinion.
4829.54s: And I don't bet opinions until the trend confirms my opinion.
4833.86s: I will bet the trend against my opinion.
4836.34s: If the trend moves in a direction, I don't believe it.
4839.14s: I will.
4840.50s: The I make mistakes and lots and lots of them.
4844.18s: And when the trend turned up in the big seven in January, February of this year,
4850.74s: I didn't bet it because I just thought the market was in.
4855.86s: Look, I'm telling you after as many users I've been doing this, I make mistakes.
4860.26s: Okay.
4861.30s: But again, what separates the grades from the also ran and the losers is how fast you
4865.70s: recognize your made a mistake and reverse your position and smash your ego.
4871.78s: If you have a giant ego, oh no, I'm right.
4875.78s: Mark it's wrong.
4877.06s: And then Alga bye bye.
4878.66s: You're out of the bit.
4879.30s: You're you're you're out.
4880.98s: What I like to tell what I like to tell people is,
4884.34s: do you want to be right or do you want to make money?
4886.74s: And you got to pick one.
4888.82s: And it's hard.
4890.74s: I chose golf.
4893.06s: My marriage, my wife and the stock market.
4897.30s: Well, maybe we can how about pickleball, jujitsu, moitai.
4900.90s: How can we work on this golf thing a little bit?
4902.74s: Maybe we could slide a little extra cracker activity in there.
4907.62s: I mean, dude, all these things take incredible amounts of discipline and being wrong.
4915.86s: If you endeavor into almost anything and you're going to be great,
4919.06s: you're going to be wrong a lot to get to the top.
4923.06s: If you're not going to be wrong, you're not going to get there.
4925.70s: You're not trying.
4929.06s: Well, I feel like it also just proves that somebody staying in their comfort zone
4933.06s: and has a certain circle of competence and you're not stepping outside of it because,
4937.94s: you know, to your point.
4939.46s: And I feel like when I look at a lot of traders, they also miss a lot of interesting opportunities.
4945.94s: That's why I like options and derivatives so much is because early on,
4951.30s: I never fell in love with trading up down sideways.
4955.38s: I really don't give a fuck which way the market can go and fucking circles.
4959.06s: The fact of the matter is as long as I can find the correct strategies that fit the current
4962.98s: market environment, that's literally all I care about.
4966.26s: So I feel like your point on the death of ego and just setting your personal pride aside
4973.22s: and just doing your absolute best to interface with the markets really resonates.
4977.70s: I, in a lot of ways, people think I'm unusual and you know,
4987.78s: there's a, I saw a thing today that said,
4992.26s: just be happy with what you have.
4993.78s: And then there's like the guy who's not happy with what he has and he wants to clump.
4998.34s: They say, live a balanced life.
5000.58s: Well, you can't be number one if you're living a balanced life because there's a lot of other people
5005.06s: who are totally cool with being 100% all in on one thing.
5009.38s: I spend my time in the markets golfing, eating and drinking with my family and friends.
5015.22s: That's pretty much it.
5017.30s: I don't do much.
5018.10s: I travel a lot to play golf.
5020.82s: I'm totally unbalanced.
5022.98s: I am, I'm very happy with what I have and I don't do it.
5026.98s: I love the money.
5028.02s: Let's not lie to ourselves.
5030.02s: But I do it to be right.
5032.26s: I do it to notice that politics are moving like this,
5036.10s: interest rates are moving like this, innovations are moving like this,
5038.18s: these patterns are setting up.
5039.30s: This is the leading group.
5040.10s: This is the leading stock.
5041.30s: And all these variables culminate into something that I believe in and then I bet it.
5046.42s: And then it works.
5048.18s: The fulfillment, the level of satisfaction of being right trumps the money.
5053.78s: I mean, again, I'm not, I'm 58, man.
5057.22s: But doing this for a long time.
5059.54s: I have enough money.
5062.26s: I get revved up by the success, by being right, by playing
5066.66s: strategic and figuring out all the moving parts and betting it and when it works, it's great.
5071.62s: One of the most greatest feelings ever.
5074.74s: So with that said, I like the game I've learned.
5078.58s: I've expended an enormous amount of time and energy and emotional beatings to learn it.
5085.06s: I think to learn a whole note like shorting, I mean, I do short.
5088.82s: Occasionally, but I'm usually wrong.
5091.22s: By the time this optimistic go short, that's a signal for all of you guys listening.
5095.78s: But I don't, I am somewhat happy with the game I've learned.
5100.82s: And I think the F necessary for me to learn another game like Polo not playing.
5105.54s: Okay, out on that.
5107.54s: Another method of investing.
5111.14s: I like the model I use because I know it really works.
5114.02s: And I'm good with, I guess I'm good at.
5116.10s: I have very much so specialized.
5119.06s: And yeah, I think when people bastardize a method, they can make it perfect and better,
5126.58s: but usually they follow it up.
5128.58s: Look, it bill was a billionaire.
5130.02s: If I only make half a bit, you know, 500 million, I'll be just okay.
5134.58s: And I'm not even remotely close.
5136.10s: I'm doing better than I was a long time ago.
5138.90s: You compound your money for 35 years.
5140.58s: You'll see how much money you're only you're 16 years in, man.
5143.46s: I'll be I'll be old enough to watch you another another 16 years.
5147.06s: We'll see how much you compounded out.
5148.82s: If you'll, you'll probably say enough.
5151.78s: Well, yeah, well, we'll see.
5153.78s: So far so good.
5154.58s: No complaints.
5155.46s: So yeah, I, and it's funny too because I, I'm very similar to you in that.
5161.62s: A lot of what I'm doing is processed driven.
5166.50s: I'm at the point now where I've actually moved a lot of my investment capital into other stuff.
5172.34s: Like I invest in commercial real estate now, regular real estate.
5175.78s: And it's they're just interesting to me.
5177.70s: And there's some really cool opportunities.
5179.46s: It's a fun way to learn different things.
5181.78s: But to your point, I feel like really embracing the process has served me very well.
5188.74s: And I honestly think that's probably one of the only ways people are going to make it in anything
5194.02s: that they're trying.
5194.58s: Because again, like if when I play golf, right?
5197.38s: I am I literally couldn't even feel comfortable labeling myself
5202.26s: as awful.
5203.06s: Like I shouldn't step foot on the fucking green.
5205.94s: Like I don't belong there.
5207.78s: And it doesn't even begin to scratch the surface.
5211.06s: So it's like for you to get good at golf, it means you went through that same phase I did
5216.90s: where you first stepped on it and you sucked.
5220.58s: And then you probably just decided, let me see if I can do it again.
5224.90s: And then you slowly have gotten better.
5226.18s: And I'm sure, you know, over your time from playing golf that you've really invested into that
5230.58s: process. So it's it's really interesting to me to see somebody again, like you with another
5236.82s: parallel, which is this process driven approach as compared to outcome driven approach.
5242.82s: I think that that's pretty common across the threads I've seen.
5245.78s: I never ever thought what has happened to me would have happened to me because I went to see
5251.94s: Bill two or three times a year. I never thought I'd ever had fun.
5254.82s: I just wanted to learn how to make money and use the market.
5257.54s: I love the markets.
5258.34s: I didn't I didn't know anybody would ever want to have me in a podcast.
5261.22s: Like there was the farthest thing in my mind and I'm on a jet the California to go see Bill.
5265.46s: But all that 30, you know, 30 years of going to see Bill.
5268.82s: It this is what it's turned into.
5270.34s: I had no clue when I started to play golf.
5274.18s: I was afraid of T-boxes that had little ponds in front of them because I couldn't get the ball over
5278.66s: the little pond in front of me.
5281.06s: I don't know if you know what handicaps, but everyone had if you my handy cap when I started was a 36.
5287.06s: I got 36 strokes and the reason I was a 36 is because they didn't have a 46.
5291.54s: I couldn't even play to a 36 handicap.
5294.74s: But going to a golf pro once a month every summer for 20 plus years has brought my handy cap
5304.10s: down into the mid single digits.
5306.74s: I mean, it was 20 years of debt and I'm not a great golfer.
5309.86s: I mean, I'm a good golfer.
5311.46s: I'm better than most people.
5312.74s: But I'm no scratch golfer.
5314.82s: But it didn't.
5315.38s: It took two decades or more.
5318.58s: Investing has taken 30 plus years.
5322.66s: And I still miss hit T-shots all the time.
5326.26s: And I lose money routinely in the stock market.
5329.94s: But I have a friend.
5331.38s: I hang out with a lot of guys and you know guys boss each other's balls and hackle each other.
5335.46s: And my buddy goes, ropely goes, you're a one trick pony.
5339.14s: But it's a really good trick.
5341.54s: It's one trick.
5342.74s: I'm really, I'm, I, I, I hesitate to even say I'm good.
5346.90s: I've had some successes.
5349.46s: But the trick I've learned is a is a is a value is a value.
5352.34s: If you're the greatest male sorter in the world,
5355.46s: you better invent a machine that sorts it for you because you're not going to make any money.
5359.14s: I mean, the world does value packing bushels of corn.
5364.02s: The thing that I engaged in the endeavor I chose,
5368.42s: when you get it right, people are really willing to pay a lot to have you run their money.
5372.42s: Okay, when you're the greatest quarterback, how many guys can throw for 500 yards in a football game or whatever?
5381.14s: What's that worth?
5382.34s: You bring in a winning team, you bring in a couple billion dollars with an ad revenue.
5386.02s: Are they willing to pay a 30 million a year?
5387.94s: Hell yeah.
5389.14s: The guy saw on the beer in the stands.
5391.22s: Don't want to give this shit about the ability to take five bucks and hand somebody a beer.
5394.42s: Anybody can do that.
5395.22s: It's not a valuable skill.
5396.74s: But it doesn't mean he's not valuable as a human being.
5399.70s: You know, you're the greatest person in the world.
5401.54s: The skills he's chosen to master,
5404.66s: cracking beers and handing them down a roll, guys, is no one gives a shit.
5408.74s: Right.
5409.46s: Yeah.
5409.94s: Yeah.
5410.74s: It's really interesting to see and just learn more about your process.
5415.70s: I mean, I've really, really enjoyed talking with you, to be honest.
5420.58s: I figured that I was going to like you just based on the way that you have good energy in
5424.50s: general and I find myself similar.
5426.18s: Like I'm just stoked to fucking be here.
5428.34s: So every time I come across other people that have a similar disposition,
5431.70s: it stokes me up even more.
5432.98s: But before we log off, I know that you have a couple different places.
5438.66s: You know, people can check you out, learn about some of the things that you offer.
5442.10s: Could you share a little bit about those?
5443.70s: And then I'll also throw links in the show notes below.
5446.74s: Dude, I really appreciate it.
5448.42s: I enjoy doing this.
5449.54s: Like I finished things like this and I looked at the clock.
5452.50s: We've been doing this for a long time.
5453.94s: I'm super happy.
5455.14s: I'm, I will turn off this.
5457.30s: This is my longest one to be clear.
5459.54s: Dude, when we log off, I'm going to go, wow, man, I feel great.
5463.70s: I'm energized by this.
5465.54s: But thank you for asking about, well, here, this is the first roll report I wrote in 1992.
5474.74s: These are very, somewhat even dated.
5476.58s: They're issue one through whatever.
5478.26s: And in here, I cover, well, I disbanded it.
5481.30s: But I restarted it about two months ago.
5484.34s: Every Sunday night, I write a 50 to 70 page report covering every leading stack,
5489.94s: every index, every variable that's important to the market,
5492.74s: whether it's interest rates, the dollar, oil.
5495.70s: I give you my comments.
5496.74s: I give you my best ideas.
5499.22s: And then on Wednesdays, I do a video where you can email in your questions.
5504.34s: And I will answer questions for two hours.
5506.90s: In the first part of it, I'll give market commentary.
5509.38s: So there's a two-part package.
5512.66s: You can get it at theroeplereport.com.
5515.86s: If you buy the bundle of the Sunday night research report and the Wednesday
5520.34s: of webinar, where I answer all your questions on Canceliver anything about the markets,
5525.06s: it's like 40% off if you buy the bundle.
5529.54s: And I think it's an amazing product.
5532.42s: If you want to learn Canceliver, if I would have had,
5535.54s: I never really got to talk to Bill one-on-one for maybe 10 years after I'd followed him.
5540.82s: But when I became an institutional customer of a Neal and Company,
5544.02s: he would call me.
5544.90s: And I would call him and we talked, not weekly, but more than monthly.
5550.74s: Had I had that access when I got started,
5554.42s: I might be worth a half a billion dollars right now.
5556.90s: I am here to teach you everything that I know
5560.90s: without you having to lose a ton of money to do it.
5562.98s: Let me, I've already taken the bruises.
5565.22s: I will answer all your questions like if you're all my best ideas and I'm going to give you
5568.58s: like 40 off if you buy the bundle.

5574.98s: It's all around the world.
5576.50s: It's awesome.
5577.62s: It's two weeks free.
5580.58s: That's awesome.
5581.30s: Yeah, I think it's awesome.
5582.98s: And to be honest, I'll probably take a look at it myself.
5584.82s: And then I'll let people know how it goes.
5587.62s: So I think that this stuff you talk about, the way that you approach the markets,
5592.10s: it's, it's awesome.
5593.30s: And I think that you have a really, really fascinating skill set.
5596.02s: You talk about it in a really invigorating way.
5598.34s: So genuinely, thank you so much for so much your time today and hanging out for a while.
5603.06s: I had a blast chat with you.
5605.30s: And I'll definitely follow up with you again to see if I can learn some more golf parlance.
5610.34s: And then I mean, really, I just fucking hate that sport.
5612.98s: So God damn boring and slow.
5614.82s: But nonetheless, I still respect the skill that goes with it.
5617.62s: I'm still hopeful I can get you on like the jujitsu mats or something for a little bit.
5620.74s: It's a little more fun, I think.
5621.70s: But we'll see.
5622.98s: Before we go on to say two things.
5624.58s: Number one, when I see a military truck going down the highway,
5628.82s: I tell my kids salute them.
5630.90s: We owe them everything.
5632.18s: I have such reverence for the military,
5634.82s: for the power we project around the world,
5636.66s: for protecting everyone around the world,
5638.90s: for the freedoms we have, it is all pred-
5641.54s: freedom are free economics.
5644.18s: Global trade is predicated on free shipping channels.
5647.22s: That is all because of the Navy.
5648.50s: The Marines, Toby Keith, Colin Marine.
5651.30s: I love the military.
5652.50s: And I'm not just saying this because you're military guy.
5653.94s: I believe this sense I was young because of my dad.
5657.06s: And I also want to say,
5658.98s: do not ever get too bearish.
5661.46s: Always lean a little bit bullish,
5663.30s: prudently, because the Golden Goose of Capitalism is never going to stop birthing
5667.78s: these new innovative companies that are going to gentrify the poor in the world
5671.70s: and ever make everyone's life better and create trillions of dollars.
5676.66s: It's never going to stop.
5678.02s: So right when you think the world's coming to an end,
5680.66s: there's going to be a stack called the send communications.
5682.98s: And it's going to run up 30% in three days.
5685.14s: And then it's going to go up 2000%.
5686.74s: And there we're just around the corner from that right now.
5689.86s: So anyway, thank you for the opportunity.
5691.86s: I really appreciate it.
5692.82s: We'll do it again maybe in six months.
5694.90s: Sounds like a blast, man.
5695.86s: Thank you so much.
5696.82s: All right, buddy. Have a great afternoon.
