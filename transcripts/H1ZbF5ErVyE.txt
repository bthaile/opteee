0.00s:  What's up, outliers? Today, we're going to talk about making a backdoor Roth IRA contribution
6.16s:  so that you could trade options in your IRA account. So let's talk first about why a
13.56s:  Roth versus a traditional. Then we'll talk about why backdoor. And I'm going to give you
18.64s:  literally a step-by-step process. I literally just completed mine for the year, so sharing
23.16s:  with you for years. So the first thing, why a Roth? Well, a Roth allows for tax free growth
30.68s:  of your capital, very similar to a traditional in that sense. However, as compared to traditional,
37.32s:  where there's no tax on the contribution with a Roth, you tax on the contribution, but
45.72s:  then you are not taxed on the withdrawal. This is useful if you think your income in the
51.64s:  future is likely to be higher than it is now. And for a lot of traders that will be the case
57.40s:  for people that are working in W2 jobs and stuff like that, probably less. So obviously,
63.00s:  consult a tax professional, not a dude on the internet. Next step, why backdoor? Well,
69.80s:  it's actually pretty simple. It's because if you fall into some of these various buckets,
75.80s:  you literally cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. So for example, if you're single and you make
82.68s:  over 161,000, you cannot contribute. If you're married, filed jointly, you cannot contribute.
89.48s:  If it's over 240,000, which is kind of a bummer. Because again, for traders and people who invest,
95.00s:  there's a good chance you're going to be worth more in the future than you are today. So
99.48s:  this is why we use a backdoor contribution is because it is a legal method for high income
108.20s:  earners to contribute to a Roth account. So now let's talk about the steps to complete. It's
116.12s:  actually really easy. So the first thing is you're going to make a non-deductible contribution
122.52s:  to a traditional IRA. Why is it not deductible? Well, it's for the same reasons that you kind of see
131.24s:  over here. If you have a certain amount of income in this case, if you're single and you make over 89K,
138.36s:  you can no longer take the deduction on a traditional contribution. So the majority of instances,
146.84s:  this is what's going to be the case for people that are doing a backdoor contribution.
151.88s:  So you're going to start with a non-deductible contribution, which we'll talk about how to track
156.36s:  that a little bit later. It's again very simple. There's essentially two forms that you need.
162.68s:  Step two is an optional holding period. I essentially don't really use this. This is some people
169.88s:  do it out of a bit of concern trying to reduce their potential footprint for being flagged.
176.52s:  But the reality is it's completely legal to do. And if you accrue any gains while you hold that
185.40s:  position, then you run into the pro-radar rule. So once you have your traditional, you make your
193.40s:  contribution that's non-deductible, then you once your funds settle, which typically takes a couple
199.88s:  days by itself, we convert it to a Roth IRA. If there are no gains on the traditional,
207.72s:  then there's no tax on the conversion. If there is or are gains existing or you accrue them in the
216.12s:  meantime before you complete the conversion, then you do pay taxes on the gains, but there is no
223.16s:  penalty to do so. So it's essentially just going to increase your tax footprint a little bit
228.60s:  unnecessarily. Now, the last thing, we report the conversion on our taxes. And there's essentially
235.72s:  two forms. There's the IRS form 8606, which is for non-deductible contributions. You literally
241.32s:  can just type in IRS form 8606 and it will pop up. And then your broker will send you a form 1099R,
248.28s:  which is a conversion notice, essentially, and distributions from retirement accounts. That one
253.32s:  comes from your broker. Now, I do not do my own taxes. I haven't for a long time. I have a tax
258.44s:  professional that helps me with all this stuff. But what you'll notice is even if you don't do your
263.16s:  taxes yourself, it's useful to know these documents, to know the process so that you're aware. So
269.32s:  for those that are on Schwab, that's who I use, essentially what you're going to do is initiate a
275.48s:  transfer. And you can see when you start the transfer, you're going to say that I want to cash
281.80s:  whatever you have in there. And then down here below my head, one second, let me slide me
288.76s:  out of the way. Then down further below this, there will be essentially a from account to account.
297.80s:  And when you click that, it's going to detect that it is IRA or retirement accounts. So this will
303.32s:  pop up at the top. So then all you do is click this here that says to complete the Roth conversion.
309.88s:  You click that and then this form pops up. And then essentially you say I want to take it from
316.20s:  the traditional. I want to put it into the Roth. I want to do a there's two different. There's
323.32s:  full or complete and then a partial. So typically would be complete because you want to get everything
327.72s:  out of the account and then move it into the Roth. And then once you complete that, that's when you
333.00s:  get your form 8606 to be able to file that. And that's when you also wait until your broker
340.12s:  gives you your 1099 R. So the whole point behind doing this is to be able to move money
347.32s:  into your Roth IRA once you get priced out of being able to directly contribute. And this isn't
353.64s:  specific for options trading. I do trade options in my IRA accounts. However, this is for anybody
361.56s:  that's trying to get money into your Roth IRA. This process is about the same. So if there's any
367.56s:  questions on how this works, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
