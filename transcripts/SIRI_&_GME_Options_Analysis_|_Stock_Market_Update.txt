0.60s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.80s: got two things on the agenda for today
4.36s: the first one is going to be Siri and
6.48s: then the second one is going to be
8.32s: GameStop so I got an email from uh Jacob
14.32s: and they were essentially asking about
17.56s: some unusual options activity that they
20.80s: were hearing or coming across in Siri
23.80s: and then there's speculation obviously
25.28s: if it's roaring Kitty that's that's one
26.84s: of the things I've definitely started to
28.16s: learn about the community is that as
30.20s: soon as anything even potentially
33.00s: related to something strange kind of
35.64s: immediately gets questioned whether or
36.96s: not it's ruring Kitty and rightfully so
39.48s: because of the way that the dude
41.36s: operates it doesn't surprise me
42.76s: whatsoever and also because the way that
46.36s: the cat likes to kind of be mysterious
49.52s: right and that leads so much room for
52.80s: speculation so I know some people get a
54.64s: little frustrated with other people when
56.36s: they're like stop thinking it's wearing
57.68s: Kitty or whatever but I would just say
61.64s: one who knows and
64.36s: two it's kind of the way that the game
66.60s: goes at least as far as I could tell I
68.36s: still consider myself very new to the
70.84s: overall gme ape space I'm learning more
74.32s: and more every day but it doesn't
76.76s: surprise me especially when you realize
79.52s: that most of raring Kitty's
81.16s: communication modalities are super vague
83.56s: right it'll be a string of emojis from a
85.92s: Missy Elliot
88.44s: video I can't even say it seriously it's
91.56s: so crazy meanwhile this dude is like a
94.52s: billionaire so hilarious but anyways it
98.36s: doesn't surprise me so let's start with
100.48s: taking a quick look at Siri there's a
102.56s: ton a ton of focus on this for a bunch
104.88s: of different reasons I think it's
106.36s: becoming tangentially related because of
108.72s: the Emojis and people are interpreting
110.44s: them some of them to mean Siri and again
113.88s: who knows but the the real big idea
116.88s: right now in Siri is they're the hold
120.08s: company Liberty is going through a giant
122.48s: giant giant reorg in terms of the way
124.88s: that it's holding its various assets so
128.40s: there's kind of a quasi merger coming up
131.40s: I wouldn't even really call it a merger
133.00s: because um SiriusXM is is already there
136.08s: but it's just held in different kinds of
138.36s: share classes and they're just looking
140.48s: to join them but there's a discrepancy
142.76s: between those two values so there is a
144.40s: little bit of a merger Arbitrage
146.00s: opportunity which I'm very careful to
148.00s: frame it as merger Arbitrage because
150.60s: standard Arbitrage is when you have the
152.28s: opportunity to tra to trade the the same
154.92s: product on two different exchanges
156.88s: simultaneously to take advantage of a
159.12s: price discrepancy which is not the case
161.16s: here this is essentially taking
163.96s: advantage of a price discrepancy between
165.60s: two holding valuations of the same asset
168.96s: but the risk profile is different
170.68s: because the deal essentially is
172.80s: structured could not go through there
174.12s: could be changes the timeline could
175.80s: change one company could completely
177.56s: change the way it's doing business y y y
179.48s: so it's just important to know that
180.64s: there's a slight difference in the way
182.64s: that those kinds of Trades would flow
184.88s: through so anyways that's kind of what
187.56s: we're waiting to see and Warren
189.28s: Buffett's even playing the move so it is
191.28s: interesting now when we take a look at
193.60s: the options flow in Siri it is
196.92s: interesting and that there's a couple
198.48s: bigger trades but the very first thing
200.40s: that comes to my mind is even though
203.28s: over the last couple days there was a
205.20s: 10,000 block that went through for the
208.52s: 820s
210.48s: the like there's a lot of activity at
213.12s: this three and a half call handle and
215.56s: it's going to be very difficult to fully
218.56s: differentiate who is who but all of this
221.00s: is small trades so does that mean that
224.48s: the cat could be in here he absolutely
225.96s: could be especially because we know a
227.28s: bunch of his money is tied up right now
229.20s: in chewy so he doesn't necessarily have
231.60s: the same pile of cash that he typically
233.32s: does to play options like I've seen him
235.48s: before as I you know went through the
237.00s: rest of his profile on Reddit to get a
239.48s: sense of what kind of positions he puts
240.96s: on what his what his preferences are but
243.00s: when I look at this the three and a
245.08s: halfes kind of do make sense they would
247.04s: be close to at the money the duration
249.56s: would make sense based on what I've seen
251.20s: him do before it's about a month is it
253.20s: seems what he likes to get into so yeah
255.92s: overall this does look generally
258.32s: interesting to me for him but I don't
260.80s: see any other like truly conclusive
264.00s: evidence that it would be him versus
266.56s: just somebody else playing something
268.40s: because again like these aren't large
269.92s: sums of money so yeah it's as always
273.68s: it's hard to say and unless we have
276.32s: somebody like royan kitty that kind of
277.80s: comes forward and simply says yeah yeah
279.96s: you know here's my next YOLO update it
281.92s: would make a lot of sense but I think
283.60s: the other thing is a lot of people are
284.96s: kind of I don't know starting to feel
286.60s: like he's shifting around a lot because
289.04s: we all thought originally like super
290.60s: GameStop Focus then there is a slight
292.28s: pivot to chewy whether that's temporary
294.12s: permanent nobody knows I probably guess
296.60s: more towards temporary based on his
300.04s: background but it does show movement
302.24s: between assets so then it wouldn't be a
303.88s: far cry to see him start tinkering with
305.88s: other assets again
308.16s: but don't know do not know so it's
311.52s: something that I'll keep an eye on for
312.88s: sure to see if you know I can come up
314.88s: with any ideas for it but nothing
316.76s: nothing's jumping out at me just yet so
319.20s: the other thing I wanted to talk about
320.56s: quickly is GameStop and it's really to
324.40s: maintain the Cadence I kind of committed
326.16s: to you guys that I was going to continue
327.44s: looking at this thing at least I don't
328.92s: know until
330.56s: I I I actually didn't think it the end
332.08s: date so I'm just kind of doing it but um
335.92s: there's not a whole lot to report today
337.56s: as far as I can tell so there's a lot of
340.60s: really interesting theories going around
342.80s: and I think Newton's video is really
345.72s: good if you guys haven't seen that I'm
347.04s: sure you have but if you haven't you
348.80s: should check it out cuz he's talking a
350.20s: little bit more about you know the
351.52s: qualitative background and you know like
354.64s: I typically say I'm a Trader so I'm
356.64s: looking at the elements I can trade I'm
358.44s: learning about the story from a
360.28s: curiosity perspective but I can tell you
364.12s: from just an information digestion
365.96s: standpoint I've seen enough people come
367.60s: up with what they think is going to
368.84s: happen and I've honestly not seen a
370.56s: whole lot of them fully come to fruition
372.88s: different elements of the theories I've
374.68s: seen come to fruition so all of that is
376.52s: to say I'm waiting until the one thing I
379.20s: know is going to happen before it moves
380.92s: which is volume like I know that I know
383.04s: volume will move before it moves so
386.16s: that's what I'm keeping an eyeball on so
388.04s: right and right now volume is just very
389.88s: very muted the other thing I want to
391.96s: continue belaboring though is that we
394.16s: have earnings coming up on Fourth
395.84s: September every time I look at this I'm
398.40s: waiting for this earning cycle to start
401.12s: jacking up an implied volatility and it
403.20s: is now just starting to tick up by one
406.84s: point not moving it's not moving much at
409.96s: all which is fascinating to me now open
412.76s: interest is still continuing to expand
415.08s: both the call and the put side and if we
418.12s: look at the volume today an exceedingly
420.08s: light day 63,000 call calls against
423.76s: 17,000 puts this is one of the the
425.60s: quietest days I think I've seen in gme
429.08s: the activity is centralized in the front
430.92s: two expiration cycles for the volume
433.04s: today so that is a quick update on what
436.72s: I'm seeing as always I would love taking
438.84s: a look at anything you guys want to take
440.24s: a look at we will do a gme live stream
443.04s: specific on Saturday yet again going to
444.88s: keep that Cadence going so that we can
446.28s: dig in deeper and deeper learn more
448.32s: about the product as you could tell I'm
449.96s: very interested to do that so whatever
452.00s: you guys want to look at during that
453.32s: also let me know be an outlier I'll see
455.28s: you guys later
