0.00s: What's up, outliers, Eric here today's all about GameStop.
3.36s: I didn't do a dedicated video on this.
5.16s: I actually have another one in the hopper for you all though about trading GameStop with
9.64s: options.
10.64s: We've already done two videos so far that have talked about some strategies that I think
14.56s: are applicable to folks that like to trade this stock specifically.
17.52s: And I have a couple more that I think might be suitable as always.
21.48s: All of this is just for your general consumption.
23.32s: The entire reason why YouTube is to spread information.
26.52s: You can figure out what's suitable, what works for you, what doesn't.
29.68s: That's all good.
30.68s: The hope is just to share ideas and information.
32.64s: Now the options expiration for today was a little bit lighter because this wasn't the
40.48s: densest series that exists right now when I say series, I just mean expiration cycle.
46.92s: So here we can see that the total open interest here was 140,000 calls and 58,000 puts, which
53.80s: is actually a little bit on the lighter side.
56.28s: Now if we take a look at 20 dees, you can see that it's 108 at 42.
62.32s: The interesting thing is that the 17 Jan is the spicy one so far.
66.52s: This is where people are positioning.
68.08s: And again, I continue to highlight things as I see them, which is important in that this
73.04s: is relatively new for GameStop.
75.16s: Typically speaking, we see so much of the total open interest in the front expirations.
80.08s: This has been about a month now that we've continually seen.
83.80s: So I a little further out in time.
86.40s: Now it was up to 60 days out when I first started noticing it.
89.72s: Now obviously the 17 Jan's about 35 days expiration, but that's where most of this is, which
94.24s: is again, really interesting just because it's slightly different.
97.88s: One of the things that you'll notice when we do any sort of options analysis or stock
101.36s: analysis for that perspective is you have to build a baseline understanding of what you're
106.76s: looking at.
107.92s: What is normal is entirely relative to the stock that you're looking at.
113.44s: So for example, GameStop, it's pretty normal at this point to have call OI exceed put
119.60s: OI.
120.60s: If we take a look at something else by comparison like spy, you'll notice it's the inverse.
125.68s: You almost always will see put OI exceed call OI.
130.12s: So you have to understand the individual ticker that you're looking at because there's unique
134.72s: qualities.
136.08s: This to me is not worthy not because calls exceed puts.
141.00s: Again, that's generally the standard here, but it's that the ratio between these, that's
146.00s: now what I track for GameStop because I've identified that as an important trait between
152.00s: these.
153.00s: Normally when we see calls at a two to one ratio or greater, that tends to be coupled
159.24s: with higher volatility, which indicates an expectation of movement.
163.64s: Rightfully so because we just had earnings, if we take a look at the chart funny enough,
168.72s: we landed at 2799, that is an interesting number.
172.00s: Now, I know for those that are really, really into Max Payne and they think that that's
176.80s: like the dominant feature that continually forces GameStop to fall just below numbers,
182.00s: that is a partial truth.
183.92s: We can find instances like this where I absolutely would agree with that.
188.24s: I would just be cautious to think that it's always Max Payne that always forces price
194.56s: to move one direction or another because that starts to sabotage other potential inputs
200.48s: if we essentially prop one up as the dominant feature.
204.40s: Now what I can tell you because I've made videos about Max Payne, I've studied it pretty
208.44s: extensively not just from GameStop, but just as a general phenomenon, which is interesting.
212.84s: There is efficacy behind it, meaning predictive qualities, but it's not perfectly predictive.
217.84s: There's a lot of variance in it.
219.72s: But what I can tell you unanimously across different cases that I've studied is in these exact
225.24s: instances where we are very close, it's more likely to occur, but if you'll notice it's already
230.76s: above 28. So that's pretty interesting to me. You'll tend to find this exact format when we're
239.40s: very close where it tends to be more pronounced. So in this case, seems a little, seems a little
246.04s: something going on. Maybe who knows? I don't know. I'm just speculating here. I'm just a
250.12s: dude on the internet. Let's take a look at the rest of the option sheen actually before that.
255.40s: Let's take a look through the stock because I do want to talk about the chart here.
259.32s: This I continue to see people feeling really upset about the stock price and I just don't see why.
268.12s: The stock is doing really well. The fact that this thing is hovering consistently,
274.28s: post earnings in the high 20s, just shy of 30. That's beautiful to me because it means that this
282.20s: run-up that we experienced, again, wasn't driven by Mania, wasn't driven by structural shorts
287.40s: covering or anything like that. This was driven by people thinking this is worth more.
292.60s: And consistently so. And it's ebbing and flowing in the exact range that I would expect. One of the
298.20s: things from a general trading technical analysis perspective breakout training, that kind of stuff,
302.84s: you try to look for things that have an extension in a consolidation. And notice during the
308.28s: consolidation, how this range is getting tighter. So if I were to draw a couple lines on this thing,
315.48s: maybe to help show that point. Notice how this space here. And this space here. Notice how this
327.96s: little area of congestion is consolidating down. We'll find our point. This means that at this point,
336.60s: the market is determining price consensus. This is people saying, I think it's worth 31 and change,
343.24s: 32. I think it's worth up here. Then a bunch of people step in and say, I think that's too high.
347.48s: I'm going to bid it down. I think it's worth less than that. Then it gets bid down, bid down.
351.40s: Then enough people step in. They're like, okay, well, it might be worth less, but I actually like it
355.24s: at 26. I'm going to buy it here. And then they bid it back up. And then the sellers say, well,
360.28s: I still think this might be a little bit high. Let me step in and sell it to 29 handle and then
365.00s: pushes it back down. But then the buyers step in faster. They're like, well, hold on a second. I
369.48s: actually really like it here. 27 so and so forth. This is literally the visualization of supply and
374.76s: demand and price discovery being played out real time. Now I know that there's a lot of issues with
379.48s: price discovery and something like GameStop through internalization and stuff like that. Totally
383.40s: understand that point. I'm talking from a general charty perspective for those that don't understand
388.76s: what this generally means. So that I actually think is great. I'm really, really stoked on that.
395.16s: I want to see the floor on the stock continue to move higher because that means that consensus is
401.64s: moving higher and higher. Take a look at this. Not all that long ago. We were literally talking
405.64s: about the floor, including a 1932 handle, right? Because that's where we barely touched dump
412.52s: through here. We hit it here here. We've touched this a few times, but then it slowly is drifted
417.48s: up and out of there, which is fantastic. So that's really cool. I already did a video talking about
422.20s: GameStop earnings, which is pretty solid. They came in at a slight profit, although again, the market
427.00s: wasn't necessarily super impressed with the profit. And again, rightfully so because most of it
432.20s: came from interest earned on their cash horde, which is great. But again, from a trader investor
438.12s: perspective, we don't necessarily want to see a company making a bunch of money from holding cash
443.40s: that happens to earn a yield because rates are high right now. We want to see sales revenue.
449.32s: We want to see the business growing. So that's not to belittle the earnings. The earnings was great.
455.16s: It was a slight beat, which is awesome. But I still think that's why we didn't see that beat
461.16s: lead to some sort of massive move because I do think as we start to see GameStop have stronger
467.40s: earnings as it continues to evolve. I absolutely expect to see things like post earnings announcement
472.76s: drift exist in something like this. And for those that are unfamiliar, I have a couple videos that
478.92s: talk about post earnings announcement drift. But post earnings announcement drift tends to happen
484.04s: when you have a company that has a big earnings beat. So if you take a look here, the earnings was
488.52s: 95 cents. It came in at a dollar 25. That's a big beat. And then it's typically followed if it's
494.12s: going to exhibit post earnings announcement drift to the positive side. It's typically coupled with
498.20s: a gap, right? So it typically means that there's some sort of really new news that's led to repricing
504.92s: and reevaluation of the value of a stock. And that tends to carry out over time because it's not
509.40s: immediately priced in big, big sources of money take some time to move around. So that's post
516.28s: earnings announcement drift. And I would not be surprised at all to see GameStop start exhibiting
521.16s: that once it starts having slightly stronger earnings. But I think that's why even though they had a
525.72s: beat in this instance, it didn't necessarily drive post earnings announcement drift one way or the
531.48s: other because of that. So back to the option chain, we have really light volatility. I mean,
539.24s: it's essentially sub 100 across all of it. The front is always going to be jacked up. But the next
544.20s: period that we see is the 17, 20, which is just above 100%. Very, very quiet, very quiet, which
550.76s: I do find slightly interesting. If we take a look at the volume, heavy, heavy call volume today,
555.96s: but a lot of that is sales, this will happen. Notice how this purple here, this is 13Ds. So these
562.76s: are people that are closing out their calls in this front expiration and potentially moving them
568.28s: into another expiration cycle. So the way we contract that is if you take a look, 181,000 calls,
574.20s: if we take a look at the front itself, that's 84,000. And then we can see 50,
580.44s: about 51,000 here and about 24,000 here. So there's a strong likelihood that a decent amount of
587.48s: the volume today was closing out front positions, moving them a little further out in time. Very,
591.80s: very common to maintain exposure to the stock itself. Now, taking a look at overall options flow,
597.48s: which you all know, this is more my world. This is what I pay very, very close attention to. We
601.72s: already talked about this slightly anomalous trade that we saw that was out in 17 April of 25,
608.44s: the 35s. Now, it's labeled as none, no side, meaning we don't know exactly where it transacted.
616.28s: But if we take a look at the price, the price of transacted at was 540, the bid was 535 at the time,
623.08s: the offer was 575. And with the bigger trade like this in terms of size, way more likely that this
628.52s: would have been on the bid side. But we don't know, it absolutely could have been a purchase,
632.12s: meaning to open contracts. But it does look like this is probably more likely a sale of options
639.56s: as compared to a buy. That's what it looks like that also would line up pretty well with what we're
645.32s: seeing on the chart, meaning the stock has had a pretty big run up recently. So this absolutely
651.08s: would be very logical profit taking. But it's just it's a pure guess. I genuinely do not know. And as
657.56s: always, I don't like to share opinions with stuff like this. I much prefer to share objective
663.80s: information and then allow you to figure out what you think it is versus my perception of it.
669.96s: But we can see that the size here 3350. This isn't something that they phased in or out of.
675.32s: So this was something that was able to float right across, meaning there was enough liquidity
679.64s: for this to go through as a bundle order, which is great. Now, the other thing that I did see
685.56s: people talking about with some of these 125s, one of the things to know with something like the 125
692.28s: strikes is for a lot of different entities. This is used for managing risk. We call it units,
701.48s: unit building. And it's because you can buy a lot of options for a little amount of money that will
709.48s: have lower overall extrinsic value, although on a relative basis that they did a cable be very high.
717.48s: If you have no idea what I just said, listen to it a couple times. And then you can reach out to us
722.20s: and the discord is completely free to join. But that's an important point. Now, this does not surprise
729.56s: me at all. And this is also a big reason why we continue to see the far out of the money's
735.32s: being populated both by my expectation, being institutions and retail traders alike. I don't
741.00s: think it's one of the other. I think it's both of them. And I think they both have their specific
745.24s: reasons for doing so. Now, for the retail trading perspective, it's typically a tough position to
750.28s: take on because retail traders tend to have smaller bank rolls. So then when they put on these
754.60s: positions that are very low hit rate, that's the nature of this style trade. This is the kind of
760.12s: trade that you put on 100 times and you expect it to hit twice, something like that.
764.92s: Now, for a smaller retail trader, if you put this on 100 times and you miss 60 something in a row,
771.00s: that can erode your bank roll, depending on how you're sizing the trades. For larger institutions,
775.88s: they literally amortize out how many times they expect to hit on some sort of move that they can
781.16s: monetize to make sure that they're positively expected. But the only way you can achieve that kind
786.04s: of risk reward profile and positive expected return from this is to have a large enough bank roll
790.76s: and size appropriately, which I think a lot of retail traders, unfortunately, don't do.
797.08s: So that's what we're seeing. Looks generally quiet, solid earnings, interesting close to the stock
803.80s: today at 2799. It's kind of comical to me. And we have the GME live stream tomorrow. We're
810.60s: going to continue going through literally the entire due diligence library. I forgot what
816.12s: episode were on, I think for the GameStop series, I think this is going to come up on 23 or
822.68s: something like that, which is kind of nuts. Because if you think about it, I'm doing it every single
826.36s: Saturday. And there's four Saturdays on a month. So it tells you, we've been looking at this for
832.28s: quite a while now. We started really analyzing roaring kitty trades. Now I'm literally going through
837.24s: the entire due diligence library from literally from the beginning. And this is how I like to learn
842.44s: stuff. I don't like to take people's word for things. I like to hear opinions. I like to hear
846.92s: what people see. But then I like to see it myself. I like to go look for it because it allows me
851.16s: to objectively evaluate stuff. And it also lets me learn more that isn't passed through the game of
857.16s: telephone. And the funny thing to me is I think a lot of people that have been in GameStop way
863.48s: longer than I have. Like the true apes out there probably are learning a lot during the series
869.16s: as well because there's a lot of due diligence with a lot of details. So it's been pretty fun
874.76s: going through that. I'm looking forward to it. If there's anything you want me to take a look at,
879.00s: you can always hit me up in the comments in the discord. You can shoot me an email, whatever makes
882.52s: you happy makes me happy. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
