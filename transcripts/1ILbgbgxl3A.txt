 What's up, outliers? Quick market update because we had a little bit of a rigour moral with the old S&P 500. So I actually want to walk through what happened today in the market as a whole, but specifically looking at spy. I want to talk about Big Daddy J. Pous comments. And then I actually want to talk a little bit about general market structure and where there's some opportunities, at least as far as I see it. So what happened today? As you can see, we started off pretty mellow day, nothing to write home about. And then Big Daddy J. Pous, this is all in Pacific. Like you can't even see the time axis. So it doesn't matter to you. But Big Daddy J. Pous came on essentially 1055 Pacific time. And if you take a guess on where 1055 is, that's right here. And then as he spoke, the market dropped a little under 2% and then rally right back up. So what happened? What's going on? And why does this matter? Well, it matters because the market right now is trying to figure out, are we in a plane that still has wheels and might land relatively softly or has the landing gear got stuck and are we getting ready to crash? And it's up for conjecture. We actually don't know yet. Now, if we take a look at Big Daddy J. Pous comments for today, it leads us to believe that things look relatively okay. So let's talk about it. He says that more interest rate cuts are in the pipeline. But they would occur at a measured pace to support the still healthy economy. Why does this matter? Well, if we stroll over to the Fedwatch school and we take a look at some probabilities here, all of a sudden there's actually kind of a pretty big change. So if I compare these, I want you to notice the difference between this here represents a 25 basis point cut. This represents a 50 basis point cut. What do you notice that happened today? Well, the probability of a 25 basis point cut went from 46% now to 63%. The market was yet again pretty far ahead of itself. And we've seen this happen literally, continually. This is not stopped for a beat throughout this entire thing. The market is perpetually trying to front run this move. So the market's expectations just got snapped back to reality. And again, we've seen this happen time and time again. That's actually why I don't think there was this big visceral reaction to it because I think a lot of us myself included. I actually was thinking 50 basis points was a little excessive to do 50 basis points than another 50 basis points. Again, not saying that that would break anything. We still have plenty of basis points to go, but it just indicates a complete change that's quite a bit more aggressive than what he's been actively communicating. So this does not surprise me. And this largely looks like the market is now digesting this new information. And you can see the bond market is repricing probabilities as they should be. So now let's take a look at a couple other things like this no shock here, right? Disappointed the hopes of many investors that there would be kind of another steep cut. The problem with this is that it's near term investors. And that's kind of a contradiction and kind of like near cited investors, I guess, because realistically speaking, this if we saw two 50 basis point cuts in a row compared to how long we waited to start cutting. It starts to raise a lot of questions. The 50 basis point cut already raises quite a lot of questions because is again, like he's been talking about this right here, a measured pace. He's been talking about this data driven approach that's slow, methodical, and it has been generally that. So to sit here and think that we actually would want another half point come down. The problem with that is that starts to say things are not actually looking good if we have to depart from the plan to execute this plan. So let's continue reading. It says the Fed cut its rate by a larger than usual half point, which is completely accurate from a statistical perspective. As it's moved its inflation fight impivided towards supporting the job market. So let's figure out what he has said. We're looking at it as a process that will play out over some time. Again, he's slowing expectations. He's saying chill the fuck out homie. We're going to get there. Then he goes on to say not something that we need to go fast on. It will depend on the data. This is the same thing we've heard. Like every time he opens mouth either money is coming out as he's printing money or he's saying this, the speed at which we will actually go. So right now the way I look at this is every literally every single time we get broad market data that enters the picture that has anything to do with the economy employment inflation. Those are all going to be massively hot button items right now today until we have a more clear picture on how this is going to go because right now there is no clear picture. And right now if you look across the larger banks and institutions that are trying to forecast the probability of us having a recession, it is still well over 25% probability in 2025 that we enter a recession. Some places are as high as 50%. So it is something you have to be aware of as we look at this, which leads me to the second point of this video, which is so where's the opportunity? How does this work? Where do we find things that look interesting? And as I try to remind people, the market is always going to show you interesting things. So let's take a look within the S&P 500. And I want to specifically look at the individual sectors within the S&P 500 because there are still the very same persistent themes we've talked about that if anybody has been acting on them, you've been making money because there's no reason not to hear. There are clearly defined strong performing sectors. There are clearly defined losing sectors that in my opinion, actually in the process of trying to turn around, which necessitates a completely different approach. It's a less clear path to trade. But what are the clear models that we see here to make money? The first one, XLC communications literally just made another new hot. You can see I'm already long in this. Same thing with XLU hanging out near new highs. These are not new names and I'm like, oh yeah, I'm just going to mention these now because they're up. I've been talking about these for weeks. And it's because they've been some of the strongest performing sectors, even when we've gone through periods like this where technology has been contracting. So for bullish style trades, make it simple. Look for things that are showing strength. Then if you want to go within the individual sectors and find the strongest performing stocks, that's what I like to do. And if you're taking a look at what's not doing well, well, believe it or not, tech is not looking great here. It's barely holding on. I still want to be very clear. I'm not bullish or bearish in tech. I'm I'm simply trading what it does. But what I notice here is that we've had a high. We've moved down to this really big pullback low. We rallied up to this high. We had a higher low. This is typically bullish. This is typically a reversal on a pattern that's normally good. The problem I have with this is it sits right now is as it tried to break above this term high here, it failed and it's rolling over. Now today it grabbed a bite. So maybe it will rally up and out and maybe if this does start to convincingly move above this high, I do start to look at it as a reversal. So I'm actually long cues right now, cue futures. But I'm very tentatively long because I still don't see a massive amount of strength. I see some of it happening. I see the moving averages starting to consolidate. I see price hanging above the more impactful moving averages, stuff like that that matters to me. But that's not the same picture as you look at XLU that's been making highs for two weeks now. If you look at XLC that's been making highs again for a month now almost. So there are places to find strength. You just have to look a little bit differently. We are seeing real estate starting to rotate over. We're seeing things like XLP trend sideways. This is a really important consolidation point. I like to trade these as they break out above or below. Again, don't care which way it goes. My job is to trade the movement. Not really care about which way it goes. Either or works for me just fine. We do see XLV breaking off. And again, this is now setting a higher low. But we have to see how well it consolidates in here. But this starts to look weak to me. It's the simplest should ever higher highs higher lows lower highs lower lows. It is literally just following what price is doing 101. But there are elements of strength. There are elements of weakness that are highly, highly tradable for those that are willing to trade both sides as I am. And if you're an options trader, that's one of the benefits of doing it this way. So we'll dive into a bunch of different scans later today during the live stream at 5 p.m. Pacific time. I wanted to recap at a high level. What's going on? As always, if you need anything, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you later.
