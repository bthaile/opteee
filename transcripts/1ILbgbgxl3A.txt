0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market update because we had a little bit of a rigour
4.84s: moral with the old S&P 500. So I actually want to walk through what happened today in
11.04s: the market as a whole, but specifically looking at spy. I want to talk about Big Daddy J.
15.96s: Pous comments. And then I actually want to talk a little bit about general market structure
21.36s: and where there's some opportunities, at least as far as I see it. So what happened today?
25.44s: As you can see, we started off pretty mellow day, nothing to write home about. And then
30.72s: Big Daddy J. Pous, this is all in Pacific. Like you can't even see the time axis. So it doesn't
34.56s: matter to you. But Big Daddy J. Pous came on essentially 1055 Pacific time. And if you take
40.40s: a guess on where 1055 is, that's right here. And then as he spoke, the market dropped a little
47.36s: under 2% and then rally right back up. So what happened? What's going on? And why does this matter?
53.12s: Well, it matters because the market right now is trying to figure out, are we in a plane that
59.44s: still has wheels and might land relatively softly or has the landing gear got stuck and are we
67.12s: getting ready to crash? And it's up for conjecture. We actually don't know yet. Now, if we take a
73.44s: look at Big Daddy J. Pous comments for today, it leads us to believe that things look relatively okay.
81.04s: So let's talk about it. He says that more interest rate cuts are in the pipeline. But they would
87.68s: occur at a measured pace to support the still healthy economy. Why does this matter? Well, if we
95.52s: stroll over to the Fedwatch school and we take a look at some probabilities here, all of a sudden
101.44s: there's actually kind of a pretty big change. So if I compare these, I want you to notice the
107.44s: difference between this here represents a 25 basis point cut. This represents a 50 basis point cut.
114.56s: What do you notice that happened today? Well, the probability of a 25 basis point cut went from
122.00s: 46% now to 63%. The market was yet again pretty far ahead of itself. And we've seen this happen
132.80s: literally, continually. This is not stopped for a beat throughout this entire thing. The market is
139.84s: perpetually trying to front run this move. So the market's expectations just got snapped back
147.68s: to reality. And again, we've seen this happen time and time again. That's actually why I don't
152.88s: think there was this big visceral reaction to it because I think a lot of us myself included. I
157.84s: actually was thinking 50 basis points was a little excessive to do 50 basis points than another 50
163.12s: basis points. Again, not saying that that would break anything. We still have plenty of basis points
168.56s: to go, but it just indicates a complete change that's quite a bit more aggressive than what he's
174.32s: been actively communicating. So this does not surprise me. And this largely looks like the market is
181.52s: now digesting this new information. And you can see the bond market is repricing probabilities
187.68s: as they should be. So now let's take a look at a couple other things like this no shock here,
194.08s: right? Disappointed the hopes of many investors that there would be kind of another steep cut. The
200.96s: problem with this is that it's near term investors. And that's kind of a contradiction and kind of
205.76s: like near cited investors, I guess, because realistically speaking, this if we saw two 50 basis
213.44s: point cuts in a row compared to how long we waited to start cutting. It starts to raise a lot of
218.88s: questions. The 50 basis point cut already raises quite a lot of questions because is again,
227.28s: like he's been talking about this right here, a measured pace. He's been talking about this
232.40s: data driven approach that's slow, methodical, and it has been generally that. So to sit here and
239.44s: think that we actually would want another half point come down. The problem with that is that
246.32s: starts to say things are not actually looking good if we have to depart from the plan to execute
251.84s: this plan. So let's continue reading. It says the Fed cut its rate by a larger than usual half
259.60s: point, which is completely accurate from a statistical perspective. As it's moved its inflation
264.32s: fight impivided towards supporting the job market. So let's figure out what he has said. We're looking
271.52s: at it as a process that will play out over some time. Again, he's slowing expectations. He's saying
279.76s: chill the fuck out homie. We're going to get there. Then he goes on to say not something that we need
285.76s: to go fast on. It will depend on the data. This is the same thing we've heard. Like every time he opens
291.76s: mouth either money is coming out as he's printing money or he's saying this, the speed at which we
297.20s: will actually go. So right now the way I look at this is every literally every single time we get
304.48s: broad market data that enters the picture that has anything to do with the economy employment
309.60s: inflation. Those are all going to be massively hot button items right now today until we have a
317.84s: more clear picture on how this is going to go because right now there is no clear picture.
322.96s: And right now if you look across the larger banks and institutions that are trying to forecast the
328.96s: probability of us having a recession, it is still well over 25% probability in 2025 that we enter
337.36s: a recession. Some places are as high as 50%. So it is something you have to be aware of as we look
343.12s: at this, which leads me to the second point of this video, which is so where's the opportunity?
348.08s: How does this work? Where do we find things that look interesting? And as I try to remind people,
354.08s: the market is always going to show you interesting things. So let's take a look within the S&P 500.
362.08s: And I want to specifically look at the individual sectors within the S&P 500 because there are still
369.36s: the very same persistent themes we've talked about that if anybody has been acting on them,
374.56s: you've been making money because there's no reason not to hear. There are clearly defined strong
380.72s: performing sectors. There are clearly defined losing sectors that in my opinion, actually in the
385.92s: process of trying to turn around, which necessitates a completely different approach. It's a less clear
390.64s: path to trade. But what are the clear models that we see here to make money? The first one,
395.28s: XLC communications literally just made another new hot. You can see I'm already long in this.
399.60s: Same thing with XLU hanging out near new highs. These are not new names and I'm like, oh yeah,
404.24s: I'm just going to mention these now because they're up. I've been talking about these for weeks.
408.56s: And it's because they've been some of the strongest performing sectors, even when we've gone
414.32s: through periods like this where technology has been contracting. So for bullish style trades,
421.68s: make it simple. Look for things that are showing strength. Then if you want to go within the
426.48s: individual sectors and find the strongest performing stocks, that's what I like to do. And if you're
432.72s: taking a look at what's not doing well, well, believe it or not, tech is not looking great here.
440.16s: It's barely holding on. I still want to be very clear. I'm not bullish or bearish in tech. I'm
447.68s: I'm simply trading what it does. But what I notice here is that we've had a high. We've moved down
452.88s: to this really big pullback low. We rallied up to this high. We had a higher low. This is typically
459.04s: bullish. This is typically a reversal on a pattern that's normally good. The problem I have with this
463.92s: is it sits right now is as it tried to break above this term high here, it failed and it's rolling
472.08s: over. Now today it grabbed a bite. So maybe it will rally up and out and maybe if this does start to
478.24s: convincingly move above this high, I do start to look at it as a reversal. So I'm actually long
483.60s: cues right now, cue futures. But I'm very tentatively long because I still don't see a massive amount
490.80s: of strength. I see some of it happening. I see the moving averages starting to consolidate. I see
495.52s: price hanging above the more impactful moving averages, stuff like that that matters to me. But
500.96s: that's not the same picture as you look at XLU that's been making highs for two weeks now.
506.08s: If you look at XLC that's been making highs again for a month now almost. So there are places to find
512.88s: strength. You just have to look a little bit differently. We are seeing real estate starting to
518.00s: rotate over. We're seeing things like XLP trend sideways. This is a really important consolidation
523.68s: point. I like to trade these as they break out above or below. Again, don't care which way it goes.
528.96s: My job is to trade the movement. Not really care about which way it goes. Either or works for
534.16s: me just fine. We do see XLV breaking off. And again, this is now setting a higher low. But we have
541.04s: to see how well it consolidates in here. But this starts to look weak to me. It's the simplest
546.08s: should ever higher highs higher lows lower highs lower lows. It is literally just following what
553.36s: price is doing 101. But there are elements of strength. There are elements of weakness that are
559.04s: highly, highly tradable for those that are willing to trade both sides as I am. And if you're an
564.24s: options trader, that's one of the benefits of doing it this way. So we'll dive into a bunch of
568.56s: different scans later today during the live stream at 5 p.m. Pacific time. I wanted to recap at a
573.28s: high level. What's going on? As always, if you need anything, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you
576.88s: later.
