0.56s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.28s: we're going to talk a little bit about
3.92s: sigga and this new monkey pox Public
7.16s: Health concern that's going on we're
8.72s: going to talk a little bit about some
10.60s: upcoming earnings in stuff like Cisco
14.68s: Baba and that probably get us pretty
17.28s: good throughout the video today so let's
19.60s: get straight and we'll talk about
20.60s: GameStop my bad at the end we will
22.28s: absolutely take a look at GameStop
23.76s: mostly just because I started a Cadence
25.40s: on it and once I start something I just
28.04s: kind of keep doing it so that will be
30.52s: here as well but let's start with uh
32.52s: sigga if you'll
34.52s: notice sigga is up
37.76s: 26.9% on the day massive massive move
41.08s: this popped up on a couple of my scans
44.44s: and why did it pop up on some of my
47.48s: scans well really has to do with this
51.12s: uptick in moox so which is monkey pox by
55.16s: the way so if you take a look this came
57.48s: out earlier and it's entally talking
60.88s: about what this whole monkey pox thing
63.68s: is about I'm going to read because I
65.88s: don't know exactly what it is I have an
67.40s: idea but I'll read to you exactly what
68.92s: it is it's an infectious viral disease
72.00s: that can occur in humans and other
73.92s: animals symptoms includes rash that
76.52s: forms blisters crusts over fever swollen
79.80s: lymph nodes it says the illness is
81.80s: usually mild and most of the infected
84.28s: will recover within a few weeks without
87.24s: treatment symptoms include rash fever
91.12s: exhaustion swollen lymph nodes muscle
93.32s: aches sore throat and the medication is
97.56s: okay let's see how about let antivirals
100.24s: that's the easy one to say the one
101.92s: that's not easy to say is TECO verat so
105.88s: right that is I don't feel super
107.60s: confident there but essentially it looks
110.56s: like uh chickenpox small poox much less
113.72s: infectious and it doesn't seem quite as
115.52s: deadly now interestingly enough though
118.24s: if you take a look at the compy sigga it
121.64s: produces an antiviral for it so that's
124.92s: why it's flying up and off to the races
127.52s: today this is one of the really cool
129.20s: things about markets is I just got a
131.48s: refresher in what monkey pox is I got a
134.80s: refresher on a company that is
136.56s: performing because of the new concern
139.44s: that's coming up and it's all tradable
143.64s: events so you can see this isn't new
146.04s: news right you can see that going back
148.04s: to the first that there's been some
150.68s: early conversations about it
152.16s: specifically on the 5th the World Health
154.92s: Organization warns on a deadlier strain
157.80s: of monkey pox and you can kind of see
160.00s: that it's been building over time the
162.72s: eth it shows plans to declare Regional
165.52s: monkey pox outbreak an emergency and you
168.36s: can kind of see the way that the stock
170.00s: moves with this news and then today it
174.28s: was declared as a public health
176.28s: emergency and a coordinated
178.00s: International response is essential to
181.00s: hul outbreak so tradable events these
184.28s: are tradable events to me I always look
186.44s: for stuff like this because it's a
188.64s: catalyst there's movement it's super
190.48s: unfortunate I don't want to see monkey
192.52s: pox going crazy I don't want to see
193.88s: people going through viral infections
196.72s: and having to endure that that sucks but
200.04s: there's a reality here from the market
201.84s: perspective and this company builds a
205.44s: potential cure SLS solution for it and
208.32s: you can see that being reflected here
209.80s: here today the volume was insane it had
214.40s: 13 million volume where it's 20-day
217.48s: average volume is just what 1.2 million
222.68s: shares up and off up and Off to the
225.24s: Races so this is something you could
227.76s: play a bunch of different ways for
230.20s: something like this it looks like a lot
232.12s: of the move probably has happened if you
234.00s: got into too late for me when I first
236.20s: start looking it's kind of when it
237.32s: breaks Above This 10 handle it looks
239.88s: really interesting so that's when I
241.04s: started nibbling and it's just because I
243.44s: was looking above recent resistance at
245.60s: least as far as I could perceive it this
247.44s: would be a much shorter term trade for
248.80s: me and I'll just kind of follow it up
251.04s: but that's really all there is to this
254.08s: one it does have options although they
256.12s: are grossly a liquid they're not great
259.20s: but they can get the job done if you
260.96s: need some options in here you can trade
263.56s: stuff like a ratio diagonal on the call
266.28s: side that's what I did and it's not very
269.00s: liquid but there is enough to get the
270.80s: job done that's one of the cool Parts
272.28s: about being a poor retail Trader is that
275.60s: you're small enough that you can make
277.08s: stuff like this work sometimes so yeah
279.72s: overall
280.92s: interesting breakout I guess you could
283.04s: say um pun partially intended and that
288.00s: is just one idea off of this but I think
290.56s: it's something to keep an eye on now
292.28s: specifically if the deadlier strain
294.60s: starts to take hold that's really
296.16s: important because we just went through a
298.84s: global pandemic not too long ago we know
300.64s: how that goes so again I doesn't seem so
303.52s: far like this is anything like that I'm
304.96s: not here to try to fearmonger I'm just
307.12s: saying it's something I personally would
308.80s: watch depending on how the deadlier
311.28s: variant emerges and what that looks like
313.44s: in the meantime you can just play the
315.40s: initial response here and that's kind of
316.96s: the way that I look at it so that is
320.44s: sigga now we have to take a look at
323.64s: Cisco and they just reported earnings
327.36s: and they came in at 87 cents against 77
332.64s: 70 cents estimate so they topped
335.44s: expectations pretty well and after the
338.08s: market here they're running 48 bucks
340.76s: when it closed at 45 so this is just a
344.00s: standard earnings play for me nothing
345.72s: sexy in here I did have a slight bullish
347.80s: skew just because I don't fear the
350.56s: downside in something like Cisco as much
352.32s: as I fear the upside because if for
354.20s: whatever reason this thing decided to
355.60s: really start taking flight it can get
357.76s: terribly PL painful and I mean based on
360.88s: where we closed today again like the
362.20s: open tomorrow if it stays around where
363.64s: it's at the open's up here so it's a
366.44s: pretty big gap up but not terrible
370.72s: definitely overall manageable position
372.84s: here now the overall earnings though
376.04s: looked decent I didn't get a chance to
378.04s: go through all of it but we can take a
379.80s: look at some of it together here and
383.60s: let's see so product sales came in at
387.28s: 9.86 billion
389.92s: and it looks like Revenue came down just
393.08s: a little bit and it plans a Workforce
395.76s: reduction of 7% typically don't like to
397.72s: see that but it's typically favorable
400.00s: for the following quarter everything
401.36s: else remaining the same it does help cut
403.68s: costs so this isn't awfully surprising
407.84s: to see here because it is I mean if you
410.36s: look at the path of Cisco it doesn't
412.96s: look as good as pretty much everything
415.08s: else that's been flying along with this
418.04s: broader Tech
420.12s: headwind a lot of things especially in
422.40s: the AI space have been flying off the
424.12s: charts here so when Cisco kind of has
426.84s: this kind of chart configuration it does
428.80s: cause some questions I don't want to
430.36s: necessarily go as far as to say that it
431.88s: gives Intel Vibes because this is a
434.80s: whole other story which this is again
436.64s: another really interesting trade that I
438.12s: like down here for a whole other thing
440.64s: but Cisco looks like it it needs to do
444.00s: something so the fact that they're
446.16s: looking at cutting some Workforce
448.08s: doesn't holistically surprise Uris me uh
450.48s: much at all so it says revenue for the
452.64s: quarter ending 27 July
458.39s: [Music]
476.88s: 13.64% two bill and right now the
481.12s: expectation is 355 and 55.68 billion so
485.28s: kind of like right in there so yeah
488.00s: that's
488.96s: that all right let's now take a quick
492.76s: look at Baba because Baba reports
495.60s: tomorrow morning and it closed down 2%
499.52s: on the day after hours trading right
501.80s: around 80 so up about
504.12s: 50 and this one I'm kind of eager to see
508.16s: this is not one I'm Trading and it's
510.32s: primarily because the last few that I
512.24s: saw I mean look at this this is like
513.80s: just parabolic chop around the earnings
516.44s: look at all of these it's just kind of
517.92s: Madness if you wanted to go longv this
520.48s: wouldn't be a terrible spot to do it I
522.12s: don't think but longv isn't really like
526.24s: through earnings is not my typical go-to
528.60s: but this does have earnings coming up
530.04s: tomorrow um before the open so it'll be
533.56s: another one I'm taking a look at because
535.76s: Baba is kind of a good representation
537.76s: just of broader economy and specifically
541.04s: for China so I'll use it just for a
543.72s: general proxy on like what they're
545.08s: seeing how things are going so that is
548.88s: that for Baba all right now let's take a
551.04s: quick pivot to kind of the broader
552.40s: Market I really want to highlight one
554.00s: specific thing we don't have to spend a
555.24s: bunch of time taking a look at this
557.28s: stuff but let's grab our standard
559.76s: flexible grid here so we can see what's
561.56s: going on and again Divergence that's
565.96s: what I see Russell rotating down down
569.88s: day cu's slightly down S&P 500 up
576.56s: Divergence so what does this mean from a
579.20s: tradable scenario to me it's kind of
581.72s: like watching it unfold until it gets to
584.40s: a point that it starts to become even
586.20s: more appealing and the appealing part
588.48s: would be something like short large cap
591.36s: long short long small cap I was going to
594.28s: say short cap I don't know why doesn't
596.04s: really make sense so but being short
600.96s: large cap long small cap it's been a
604.96s: okay trade but it's taken a long time to
607.16s: come in that's why I'm being a little
609.00s: more cautious in terms of my timing and
611.88s: I still have my long tle Q's position so
614.56s: it wouldn't be like I'm overall gross
616.64s: short the large caps it would just kind
619.16s: of be a small pairish trade specifically
621.28s: between something like iwm and spy but
623.68s: the relationship between the two of them
625.00s: has been fairly defunct for a while now
628.00s: so what this means for me is as I'm
629.64s: watching small caps it's eyes on small
631.56s: caps I want to see if it can start
633.88s: breaking above these levels here and I I
637.88s: just want to see if it can catch a bid
639.64s: and if it can start just getting some
642.88s: sort of strength underway because I do
646.04s: still find it interesting that we have a
648.28s: rate cut that's still projected at 100%
651.08s: coming up and small caps are still just
654.00s: not playing ball here I can't I can't
656.64s: help but find that interesting the other
657.96s: thing I can't help but find interesting
659.40s: is the fact that the sell volume today
661.76s: was massive buy volume was 7.8 million
664.88s: and the sale volume was
666.72s: 1738 million so that tells me that
669.20s: there's just a lot of repositioning
672.08s: Happening by these larger funds in these
674.12s: really short-term time frames which is
675.72s: kind of crazy typically you don't see it
677.92s: necessarily go down like that so yeah I
681.40s: mean that is part of what's going on
682.88s: here bonds are still ticking up and up
684.64s: and up so I see them at
686.44s: 12413 here on ZB
689.88s: so broad Market is kind of in this weird
694.16s: spot starting to see more Divergence is
696.00s: kind of the main call out here now the
698.32s: other thing I want to highlight is this
700.88s: this is really interesting to me so if I
704.20s: take a look at
705.96s: QQQ which is the NASDAQ had a tiny
708.96s: little bit of a Down dat today volume
711.40s: was mostly by volume 65% but then take a
715.52s: look at net highs lows net
718.24s: highs low still negative trending right
721.08s: around 56 it's essentially unchanged
724.12s: over yesterday it was like 59 yesterday
726.64s: 56 today and the gross highs is growing
730.48s: it went from 80 to 101 gross lows is
734.92s: also growing from - 139 to-
739.96s: 157 this is not super common that you'll
742.88s: see this so for me this is the kind of
745.56s: thing that I will watch and see how net
748.64s: highs lows pans out specifically in the
751.08s: cues before I start doing a whole lot
753.56s: because again like this is an abnormal
755.48s: Divergence in the indicator and it's
758.16s: something that I would want to see how
760.64s: it resolves is it that the general pack
765.64s: of stocks is starting to uplift with
768.08s: just you know a smaller group of
769.92s: lingering stocks rotating under could be
773.40s: but I also care about the the change
775.60s: right so day over day we added 21 highs
780.40s: and a little under 20 lows so that is
783.48s: starting to capitulate towards the high
785.68s: side so I have to wait and see how that
788.48s: pans out so what does all this mean from
791.72s: a broad Market it's a weird one I still
794.36s: have my Q's position on as I already
796.20s: said still trading zero DTE all that
798.32s: kind of stuff standard programming there
800.84s: but I think you kind of have to be
802.96s: careful here this clearly isn't looking
805.44s: like some sort of straight parabolic
807.88s: vshape recovery back back up to highs
810.16s: still could be but it doesn't
812.96s: necessarily look like that and again one
814.80s: of the things I would point to for that
816.24s: specifically in the NASDAQ is that the
818.60s: majority of the volume today was buy
820.80s: volume and it still closed down so it
823.24s: tells me that the buyers aren't super
824.68s: strong here and it does tell me that
826.24s: we're starting to see enough larger size
829.24s: selling stepping in to push price at
832.28s: least a little bit and also the
834.76s: Divergence between the indices I don't
836.76s: like seeing spy and q's moving quite so
840.80s: differently not crazy to see small caps
844.36s: moving as they are just because they
846.32s: kind of been on a different program for
847.72s: most of the year but seeing the
848.84s: Divergence between all of them makes me
851.20s: interested so right now I'm playing
853.60s: shorter term thesis I'm playing earnings
855.76s: I'm playing things like I kind of talked
857.56s: about in the beginning of the video
859.16s: playing Just shorter term velocity style
861.52s: movements not so much drift right now
865.04s: and it's because I'm I'm waiting to see
867.08s: how things set up all right let's take a
868.68s: quick look at GameStop got to be honest
870.96s: it's been quiet in here it's been quiet
872.60s: in GameStop and today it is again so if
877.08s: we take a look it is just trending
879.52s: sideways we've gone from like
882.12s: 2154 to
884.36s: 2190 for like the last 5 days we are
886.96s: just grinding sideways here from a
889.92s: volume perspective we are still anemic
892.76s: volume is super super low we are still
895.56s: light years away from the 20-day average
897.88s: which is 8.3 milli million today's
900.60s: average was three today's not average
903.04s: Today's total volume was
906.24s: 3.46 so very light transactions going on
910.32s: in here it does still look like when I
913.44s: look at the options chain that the
917.76s: activity in the near-term expiration
921.12s: is surprisingly is as spicy as it tends
924.68s: to be so the 16 a expiration is is
928.08s: pretty built out here
929.68s: now again I'm trying to keep an eye on
931.72s: this 20 step expiration to see how the
933.60s: buildout is going there as we're getting
935.40s: closer and closer and it's not that
937.52s: crazy neither is the build out in 23 a
940.88s: or 30 a so what that tells me is I'm
944.96s: actually not positive where people are
946.60s: going to reposition once we come up at
949.72s: the end of this week so we can see some
951.68s: of the volume for today and we can see
953.76s: some of this is moving out into 23 a
956.20s: right that's what these are and you can
958.20s: see a little bit this looks like moving
960.24s: out to 30 a that's what these are so
962.36s: there's some rotation happening
964.76s: today but it's not a lot right 82,000
967.84s: traded today on the call side versus
969.56s: 20,000 puts so right now from
973.52s: specifically GameStop perspective it
975.72s: kind of does look like we're in a bit of
977.12s: a holding pattern still I'm eager to see
980.44s: how things start getting busy around
982.40s: earnings I'm still not seeing earnings
985.72s: expiration cycle IV as high as I would
988.64s: expect my guess is this will start to
990.28s: jack up more and more as it gets a
991.56s: little bit closer but it's not massively
994.12s: High the other thing I want to look at
995.28s: quickly is what is the expiration cycles
996.96s: look like coming up so 16 a there's
1000.20s: 295,000 calls 100,000 106,000
1005.16s: puts 23 OG is
1008.44s: 41,000 to 11,000 30 OG is 37 to 10 six
1013.68s: step wow that's actually really
1015.60s: surprising it's 12 to two so just super
1018.92s: quiet super super quiet um 13 step 4,800
1024.20s: to 2 2600 and then 20 step 49 to 27 so
1029.40s: overall the front expiration as pre
1031.84s: usual with GameStop is the busy spot but
1034.20s: it does look like very quiet after this
1036.84s: expiration cycle so really what this
1038.80s: means for me is I still have my shares
1041.32s: I'll just keep holding those but when it
1044.40s: comes to trading options or playing
1046.00s: options I'm selling calls against the
1047.84s: shares because we're just trending
1049.68s: sideways and that helps support the
1051.92s: position a bit and there's still good IV
1055.12s: in the product overall so if we take a
1057.80s: look at the out of the monies we take a
1061.48s: look at the VA you can still see like
1063.28s: there's really decent out of the money
1065.24s: call volume uh volatility sorry so this
1069.12s: is still heavily appealing to me from an
1071.40s: option selling perspective to take
1073.00s: something against the long shares
1075.92s: because again the long Shares are just
1077.32s: kind of grinding sideways they're not
1079.36s: really doing anything super fun to look
1081.52s: at so that is that as always if there's
