0.00s: What's up, allies? Time for a quick market update. We have a few things on the agenda.
4.08s: We're going to talk about quantum computing, quick market overview, PPI, which came in a
7.96s: little bit hot. We have a split coming up in a pretty well-known stock PNW. And then
13.20s: I want to take a look at Tesla and TWLO maybe TWLO if we have time.
18.48s: So I want to start with this though, because quantum computing is starting to gain a lot
21.52s: of traction. And it reminds me a lot of just what we've seen in AI, where AI was kind
26.24s: of quiet. Didn't hear too much about it. Then you started to hear a little bit about it.
30.16s: And then pretty damn quickly, actually yesterday, for me, I updated my phone and in iOS 18.2
36.00s: or whatever it is. It's now integrated into the software itself that I can use Chatupot.
42.80s: So adoption for something like AI is moving super, super fast. Now, quantum computing has
49.04s: a very different use case. And I don't necessarily see the same spread as something like AI
56.24s: that can be in many different shapes and forms and really impact just about everybody. It's
59.44s: literally on my phone. You're not going to have that on quantum computing on a phone, at least
63.92s: in the near term, who knows what it might be in some years from now. Now, the interesting thing,
69.04s: though, is that now is typically the time to find things that we think might be a big part of
75.92s: this quantum computing movement if we think that it's powerful. Now, for those that are curious
82.64s: what quantum computing is, I'm literally the last person on planet earth to explain it to you
86.96s: because I'm an idiot. Now, I can summarize it at a very high level, which it's essentially the
93.12s: ability to solve more challenging problems that an existing computer cannot. And it's a restriction
99.52s: based on the way standard computers now use bits. They exist in either a one or a zero state
105.20s: that adds a natural constraint to what they can compute. Quantum computers use something called
110.64s: qubits that can exist in multiple states. They can be one or zero or and zero, which is really
116.96s: cool. And it allows them to solve really big problems, simulations and things like that that
122.32s: your computer as it sits today cannot do, which is again, very neat. But let's listen to this from
128.16s: fast money. This is a couple days old, but this talks a little bit about some of the error correction
134.32s: component to it. I haven't listened to this yet. I'm actually going to listen to you right now with
137.60s: you guys. This just looked interesting to me. I'm in the camp. I think consistent with what
143.44s: most of the panelists said, which is probably too much for today. I agree with Guy that this is more
149.52s: of a validation point for Google's tech, but this just a point in perspective, they started this
155.12s: Willow project 12 years ago. And so the potential around this being commercialized is probably 10
162.88s: years away. And so it's a it's still a long time. That's interesting. I understand the point that
170.40s: he's making, which is very interesting overall. But I also am continually impressed at how fast
179.60s: things can move once there's the right incentive structure in place. Again, I'm sure for something
184.72s: like widespread adoption utilization, it probably is some time off. To me, 10 years just sounds like
191.36s: a long time for something like that, especially if there's enough opportunity. For example,
198.40s: if a company like Google really sees a huge opportunity as the technology starts to take shape,
205.76s: I wouldn't be surprised if that timeline is pretty severely accelerated. And this goes back to
210.08s: the point I was making just before that if these are the kind of things that you want to try to trade
216.72s: in for me, it absolutely is because these kinds of technologies lead to these massive waves of
223.12s: movement that can quite literally give you a year, two years, three years worth of gains if you're
230.24s: in the correct stuff with the correct style trades to capitalize on the move it is unfold. So
235.92s: that doesn't mean it's happening right now today, but it does mean that keeping a really close
241.44s: on the movement of this technology and when it starts to catch fire, finding companies that we
246.72s: think are really going to be leaders or contributors. And another note on that is big companies like
253.04s: Google will be a big part of this also stuff like IBM will be a big part of this so on and so forth.
258.48s: However, the stuff that's going to move a lot is going to be small cap midstop, mid cap stocks that
265.20s: contribute to this in some way. So now is the time to build that watch list. It's the time to start
270.24s: going through what we think feeds into quantum computing in some way. And it might be a little bit
276.24s: early because here's the other thing. Even before there's widespread adoption, all of these smaller
282.40s: companies are going to have to get their supply chains in line. They're going to have to broker all
285.68s: these different deals in order to feed the commercialization. So a lot of that move is going to happen
291.04s: in those kinds of companies before the full scale adoption. There's something to be aware of.
295.76s: Let's keep going does speak. There is a piece where the stock should have been up today. I would
300.08s: add guest a few percent because I think it does speak to Google invested in the right areas for
306.56s: what will be continuing tech acceleration in the decades to come. I mean, this is a Google investor
312.16s: as a sleep well at night. Similar as Waymo is a sleep well at night business. It doesn't get a
316.88s: ton of attention. But I think collectively, Melissa, I would have expected the stock to be up a
321.36s: couple percent today, not 5 percent. Gene, I love when you're a growth. So thank you. I'll ask you
325.76s: this question and on the back of that. Who should be worried about this? I saw on your notes probably
330.24s: not Nvidia, not AMD yet, but somebody has to be. I think there's some of the other quantum
338.56s: companies. There's private companies on that side. But I think on the public side,
343.84s: the worries are probably because this is again a so far away. I think the piece that the rest of
350.88s: the mag seven needs to be contemplating here and Nvidia needs to be thinking about is just what are
355.28s: they doing to have some sort of position within quantum computing? It is it's theory right now,
361.28s: but I think you have to. You have to imagine they already have thought through this and then some.
365.76s: So I understand this point again, but I don't think that this is Nvidia's time to like start
372.00s: thinking about it. I'm pretty sure Nvidia understands has ideas on how they want to get involved,
376.64s: what they think they can do. And then it's a matter of what's the right timing to execute against
381.28s: it and whatnot. But the reality is quantum computing is very likely the the next big thing. Now,
390.00s: I say that in a different context than something like AI for the reasons I described earlier,
394.96s: AI has the ability to show up in many different forms and impact quite literally everything.
400.24s: Even super small use cases to people playing around with the voice version of chat GPT because
406.16s: it's funny to using it to accelerate the building of newsletters and collating news. All
414.40s: different kinds of things is a trader. You can use AI to review what you're doing and give you
418.40s: feedback. It's literally about as multivariate as you can get. You can load different files and
423.52s: query against that. I've done that with a bunch of different studies from SSR and it essentially
427.44s: becomes a super genius that can answer all different kinds of questions provide research from a
431.52s: giant library of studies I have. So it's like AI can impact lots of things. Quantum computing is
437.76s: going to have very specific use cases in the beginning is it's going to scale. It's going to move
442.00s: a little bit slower. Now, you can see that there is a couple companies that they highlight that are
449.52s: likely involved in this to varying degrees. So let's take a look at these. I'm going to move away
453.28s: from TWLO for now. The main reason why this is on the list is because they're just crushing it.
457.92s: Take a look at this run. They've post earnings. They came in at a dollar to they were expected at
464.72s: eight cents. So smashed earnings and has just been floating up floating up to the sky. This is why
473.20s: post earnings announcement drift is such an important factor, especially for small cap mid cap stocks.
479.68s: Lots of money to be made on stuff like this. Now that aside, let's take a look at some of these
484.00s: other names from that article. So RGTI is one of them. And this obviously is moving a lot to do with
492.08s: the news from Google. I oh and cue this one's interesting because this is popped up on a lot of my
499.52s: scanners. And this is something I've been keeping an eyeball on for a little while now. This also had
506.08s: a pretty rough earnings, but the forecast was generally solid. And we are seeing a Taylor
514.88s: off a little bit here. So we'll just create an alert, keep an eyeball on this bad boy. Yeah, it goes.
519.52s: And then I thought there was one more there it is. UBTS. That's a good name.
529.20s: So this looks just about the same as RGTI. Like they're essentially the same charts, QBTS.
536.40s: These are a handful of names that you might want to keep an eye on. And you can tell that these
545.36s: are very early stage names because most of them are still running in the red. So this had negative
550.96s: earnings here. What did it produce here? It was also negative earnings here. This is very common
555.84s: for companies that are getting their feet on them and starting to grow. So definitely something
560.88s: to keep an eyeball on. Now from a broad market perspective today, we saw tech and large cap hold on.
568.40s: So the S&P 500 and Qs about the same small caps still rolling over. Really interesting because we
574.40s: just reviewed the Fed watch. Yesterday, it's overwhelming probability of a 25 base point cut.
579.52s: And yet the market rolls over. So that I find slightly interesting discretionary is still
585.60s: absolutely crushing it. We can see things like healthcare not doing quite as well. Utilities not
590.80s: doing quite as well. Real estate is slowly basing a little bit. But I would not be surprised at all
595.76s: to see continued downside here and energy just running down. Industrial is running down. So we're
601.60s: seeing a rotation, which is really important. If you're too late to this party, then that's one
608.24s: you're overpositioned to the upside, even though there's a pretty big rotation going on within
613.68s: the indices themselves and within the sectors themselves. This doesn't mean crash. It doesn't mean
617.28s: that the market's going down, but it does mean pay attention to this stuff because it absolutely
622.80s: can go from slow to fast really quick. And you don't want to be cut on the wrong side just because
628.72s: we're not looking at stuff. It's typically a pretty bad reason to go down. Next up, we have PPI.
635.20s: And PPI came in a bit hot, 0.4 month over month compared to 0.2. And before is 0.3. And core PPI was
646.40s: 0.2 right in line with consensus. So inflation is looking a little weird here. It's looking like
652.88s: there's some artifacts of it actually expanding a little bit, not excessively. I don't think the
658.80s: market's freaking out about it. But it's also not necessarily tamped all the way down. And we
665.28s: saw this also with CPI from yesterday. So this is something that we really need to pay attention to
672.48s: because this inflation being in a holding pattern is a really, really big gimme in terms of the way
678.48s: that the market is performing. If that starts changing in any significant degree, that absolutely
684.96s: has the potential to start adding a lot of volatility to the market, even in the markets, very,
689.84s: very complacent right now. Next, let's take a look at PANW. And this is primarily because it does
697.20s: have a split coming up. The stock has had a really, really solid run. And a lot of times post split
703.36s: for stuff like this, we will see new money being able to find its way into the stock that people
708.48s: like. And I'm also, I don't know if good old Pelosi. Let's find out. This has been in Pelosi's
714.64s: portfolio for a while. I don't know if it still is. That'll probably completely dictate what all of us
718.88s: should do. And let's take a peek. I'm not affiliated with these guys. They have a really great tool
723.92s: for this. And let's see Tesla PAN. There it is. Options too. You got to love that Pelosi's out here
733.20s: slaying options. Take a look at this. Her strategies are just smashing. She's up over 800 percent
741.04s: compared to a measly 200 percent over the same reference timeframe for the S&P 500. It's almost
747.12s: it's almost like, almost like she might have information that other people might not. Really great
755.52s: positioning here though. And it looks like the last couple trades were in 21 Feb.
764.40s: But this is something I've seen pop up on our portfolio a few times. So you know what that
770.08s: means? Full port because in Pelosi, we trust at least in terms of our returns. Tesla absolute
778.56s: tear. Somebody asked me if I could take a look at this. And Tesla has been on a on a burner of a
786.24s: move. Now there's a lot of drivers I can see leading into this. But regardless of what all of them
793.20s: are, what I think here is sooner or later, there is extension. And I really prefer to follow momentum.
801.76s: But the way I saw it is getting in post this, it just becomes a really high risk entry.
807.60s: For a shorter term, swing slash momentum style trade, not for a long-term investment,
812.16s: long-term investment is whatever it is. Now one thing I try to remind people though,
817.12s: that if you go further out in time, this is going out to five years. Notice how we are now just
824.56s: getting back to the peaks that we saw at the end of 21. That's an important note. This isn't a lot
832.16s: of like brand new uncharted territory. We are now just getting to this. So all of this proceeding
838.56s: move while very impressive is still a recovery move. We don't start getting into new territory
844.48s: literally until today. So I think that context is really, really important when we look at this
851.52s: because this kind of move seems rip your face off impressive and it is. But that being said,
858.24s: it's still overwhelming majority recovery so far. And now we're just getting into new territory.
864.80s: So that's something else I keep an eyeball on. So lots of stuff going on. As always,
869.44s: if there's anything you want me to take a look at, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
