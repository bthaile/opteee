710.00s: you
712.00s: I
714.00s: This is
716.00s: what
718.00s: person. We need to define literally all of this. And to be clear, this is a great first
726.08s: crack out of goal. This is what most people probably come up with. But what I'm showing
730.28s: you is the requirement for the next step. You have to take another step with this kind
736.04s: of goal. So first, what does consistent mean for, I've been saying like Shazad, Shah
745.68s: Zad, Shahazad, that close, Shahazad. Miller time says, I think this part of the problem
756.88s: as for me, I didn't have a goal. Just wanted to get rich tomorrow. And that's a really,
761.92s: really common condition. By the way, you are not any, any absolutely stretch, the only
768.76s: one to experience that. And if you were called from the first episode of the series, the
775.00s: reason why that's a really terrible target is because that just sets entirely skewed
781.48s: expectations. So I'm, I'm deriving that you understand that now. But it's a worthy
787.34s: conversation point because that is exactly where a lot of people start from. Shahazad,
794.48s: three syllables, and yes, close. Shahazad. Hopefully that's close. So let's start with
800.88s: consistent. What does consistent mean to you? Tell me, what does this mean? Consistent
807.00s: could mean every day I want to make a certain amount of money. It could be every week.
811.80s: It could be every month. It could be every quarter. It could be every six months. It could
815.96s: be over the course of two to three years. And the reason why I'm harping on this is because
821.48s: depending on what we craft here, what you will find is as you're defining your goals as
825.60s: a trader, there are trade-offs that you have to work through for all of them. So monthly
834.48s: returns. Okay. So what are the monthly returns that we want? So we want monthly, positive
843.48s: returns. I'm trying to look at yearly, but then breaking it down to month. Yeah, you'll
854.56s: see why this honestly is a terrible idea, but it's a great starting point for the conversation.
860.16s: So I want you to just follow, follow the stop process. So you're talking about monthly
865.44s: returns, which is annual broken down into monthly timeframes. What you're highlighting
869.40s: there is good. What does income generation mean? What does that mean? Does that mean that
873.76s: we're withdrawing money from its every month, every two weeks, every other month? What's
881.60s: the income generation part of this mean to us? And when we say two to four percent returns,
888.60s: what does that mean? Is that two to four percent returns on the monthly basis is what I'm
895.72s: gathering based on context. But I want to know again, like what the vibe is here. And
904.96s: based on what you tell me, we will be able to shape this. Trading says monthly positive.
918.96s: Okay. So yeah, and I think that that's good for like consistent is breaking it down to
926.16s: that time frame monthly one to two percent. Okay, got it. That's great. Because if you
931.00s: said two to four percent on a monthly time frame, I was going to tell you that it's
935.56s: not impossible, but it's insanely improbable for those that don't know when you're looking
941.76s: at returns like this, especially if you're compounding it in any way, something like picking
948.00s: the midpoint a three percent return is like 42, 44, 40 something. What the hell is this
959.32s: number? 42.6 42.6% annualized. You have to ask yourself how realistic does that feel?
976.24s: So that's why using two to four percent and I throw this, these two absolutely would
984.24s: not go together at all. And it's because in order to get higher returns like this, you
991.36s: inevitably are going to have to accept higher portfolio volatility. So if instead we
998.88s: zoom this down and we pick something that like we're talking about now with that new range
1004.60s: of something like one to two percent. If we pick something that's the midpoint of that,
1011.48s: again, on a monthly time frame, 1.5% that brings you to a 19.6% return, which is still like
1018.96s: people might hear them be like, oh, that's it. Like that's still a really fucking good
1022.64s: return, especially if we're doing it consistently. That's difficult. So this is 1% per month,
1031.72s: 19.6 annualized. I think this is overall generally reasonable if you're a more seasoned trader,
1040.48s: if you're a beginner trader, this will probably ruin your account. But again, good conversation
1045.36s: point. So we've now defined monthly positive returns and we're looking for 1% per month.
1053.96s: Now the next question is of this 1% per month, how much of it are we trying to withdraw?
1063.68s: And the reason why the withdrawal matters is because if we think we are likely to hit
1070.48s: again 1% just with whatever risk we put out, it's very unlikely. What I mean is you're
1079.44s: going to have to cycle on some of these traits because some of them will lose. That's just
1083.28s: the numbers of this game. So the next question is how much of this are we trying to withdraw
1090.70s: on a monthly basis? And then what is deep drawdowns? What percent max drawdown for the account
1101.74s: equals deep drawdowns to you? So we need two inputs. We need income per month. And we
1115.94s: need max drawdown metrics. What do you guys think? Miller, Miller time says if you don't
1128.78s: mind me asking, I don't mind you asking at all, it's the whole point of this. What is your
1132.42s: monthly goal? My monthly goal has changed a lot. It used to be 15% per year and then I would
1139.38s: want to work on a cadence on average that would get me there. But that's actually changed quite a
1147.62s: lot to be honest with you. And the reason for that is because as the portfolio grows, the percent
1156.66s: return actually matters less and less and less. And ultimately what matters more is like the
1165.14s: actual gross dollar amounts. So for me, it used to be 15% per year. That was how I thought about
1175.86s: growing at the rate that I needed to. That comes out to be like one and a quarter, a month again
1181.06s: not compounded. And then that's just from like base level trading activities. 15% per year was
1189.70s: the planning factor. And I talked about creating those kind of goals a few times. But effectively,
1196.18s: what I would do is I would take a look at compound growth over different time frames 20 years, 15
1206.66s: years, 30 years at a certain rate with a certain savings rate on average. And then I was projecting
1214.18s: how long that would take me to hit a million bucks. That was my original planning target. And that's
1217.86s: why it's 15%. She's Shahazad says, I'm trying to figure out the drawdown part. Not sure how to come up
1226.66s: with that. I don't want one month's losses to wipe out a few months gains. For example, in this past two
1231.86s: weeks, I sold in the money calls. The reason it gives me decent protection if this stock goes down
1236.10s: while capturing extrinsic as well. In the money cover calls really are not a good strategy. They're not
1241.62s: bad, but it's like a short put almost always is going to be more effective.
1248.34s: And that's because of puts you you're taking on overall very similar risk profile.
1253.22s: But that part aside, that's completely okay. We can leave these open ended.
1257.94s: The here are the the series of tradeoffs that I want to talk about and then we'll move on from
1264.18s: the goal setting section. Now again, the reason why we spend so much time on goals. This is going
1269.62s: to be probably a 90 minute session because it's just a lot we have to get through. But the goals
1273.62s: is super important because again, everything we do now is going to be in service of the goals.
1279.70s: So we're looking for 19.6% annualized again. We're saying that we're seasoned traders at this point
1286.82s: three plus years at least preferably five plus meaning some decent experience. Now the income per
1294.58s: month, I actually think that this is not even a factor. Don't even think about this. And it's
1300.26s: because this is one of the worst possible ways you could structure yourself as a trader for this
1305.62s: to actually work. Here's what I mean. The way that I think about it is if I need $100 per month,
1314.18s: the last possible thing I want is in order to get this $100 that I need for this month is for
1321.30s: me to have to make it this month. It makes no sense. There's no contingency plan there.
1329.54s: There's no room for error literally zero room for error. So the way that I personally think about
1336.10s: the income generation element of a portfolio is very different than what most people would likely
1341.06s: would think. And here's how I think about it. Let's say I need this $100 per month. What I'm going to
1349.54s: do is I'm going to estimate conservatively so padded cost per month per year. And I'm going
1364.74s: to figure out what this number is. How much money do I think I need per month per year based on
1370.42s: what I'm trying to get out of this portfolio? Then what I do is I wait until the portfolio is at
1380.02s: least two years deep. What I mean by this is that I could consistently pull what I need on a monthly
1390.18s: basis, adding nothing back from trading activities for an entire two year time frame.
1398.82s: It might sound like a lot, but markets change. And again, if you want this to actually work,
1407.46s: you have to think robustness. You need robustness. It's so much easier to say like yeah, just buy
1416.66s: a hundred shares of stock and then sell calls against it and then use that short premium as your
1421.46s: income. It is complete bullshit. It's not going to work. So I'm really conservative in this sense.
1428.50s: And this isn't even as conservative as I personally was before I made this choice.
1433.86s: But I think this is an absolute minimum. So then what this means is my annual trading performance
1441.78s: is essentially filling up the bucket that's at the end of this timeline. So if this is a two year
1448.90s: timeline, zero one two. And I'm withdrawing money out this month. The money that I'm making
1457.38s: is essentially filling the back end of this bucket. That's how I think about it. So with that
1464.58s: all being said, and now that we know, at least in the way that I set this up, is having a monthly
1472.26s: like income target is dumb from a trading activity perspective of I'm going to make this much per
1478.58s: month in order to withdraw this much per month. That is overwhelmingly likely going to fail.
1483.62s: So I think of it as over the course of a year, I need to hit this in order to plus up my bucket.
1492.42s: That's two years out in time in order to stay on the correct trajectory, whether that's to be flat
1499.46s: but to draw enough income or whether that's to slightly grow my money while withdrawing on it,
1505.70s: whatever your goal is, you literally just do the math and figure it out. So that's our goal. Max
1511.46s: drawdown. The way to think about Max drawdown is the higher your return potential is.
1519.30s: So think of it this way. If we have a little scale like this and then we have return
1527.06s: and we have risk, here's what happens. If we want to increase our return, this turns into a
1538.58s: hydraulic scale where both of them are going to go up not necessarily linearly, but there will still
1547.78s: be a positive correlation between them in terms of the overall direction because here's what happens.
1554.02s: In order to move, let's say from this 10% return to this 20% return, you functionally are going to not
1561.30s: even not even accounting for the directional risk of your portfolio, the volatility risk of the
1567.70s: portfolio, not even accounting for those elements. You literally are going to simply have to start
1572.58s: using more money, just more money. And then we can deduce if we have to use more money in order to
1580.50s: hit this higher return, the potential for us to experience a move that hurts the portfolio is higher.
1588.26s: It's not again purely linear, but there is a correlation. So what this says is, depending on how you
1595.06s: trade and depending on what your target is, you're going to have to define a Max drawdown that
1599.22s: makes sense. And if you have no idea what makes sense, this is exactly why you need to pay for
1605.38s: trade because otherwise you will have no idea what works. And we're actually not even going to
1611.46s: answer this just yet. We're going to answer it in a few minutes as we start building some of the
1616.90s: rest of this stuff. So let's just start with a guess. So what's our best guess on Max drawdown that
1625.62s: we think would be allowable to hit a 20% return? What's a guess?
1630.82s: And then I'm going to tell you a way that you can come up with a reasonable guess on your own,
1638.82s: but I want to see what you think of first. And this is really for anybody.
1650.26s: What do you guys think?
1654.34s: Any time that you're looking at something in the trading world and you have absolutely no idea
1659.54s: where to go, I would always start with, is there a reference I can use?
1669.70s: So let me hide this so it's not blocking things. We know what the S&P 500 returns.
1676.26s: We know what the average return is. So if I'm looking at this 10 year monthly time frame and I
1683.78s: look at this over 12 month periods, I can see where the biggest drawdown was. I can see one of
1690.26s: them is right here. What is this? A 36.2% drawdown. This was during the COVID bear market. Okay. I see
1698.18s: another big drawdown here. What's this drawdown? 28.5% drawdown. I see another drawdown that's here.
1707.30s: What's this one? 12.2. I see another drawdown here. What's this one? 21.8%. So what am I doing?
1716.74s: I'm getting a sense even if I were to hold just market beta. What these drawdowns might look like
1726.02s: because again, we're working under the scenario that we have no idea. We're just guessing.
1731.30s: But this is exactly how you come up with an educated guess. As you can look at these different
1737.30s: periods, you know OA-09 was a rough time frame. That's a 60% drawdown. So maybe we don't want to go
1747.14s: down 60%. We know that that's a recent pretty extreme level that we can factor off of. We know
1754.50s: the most recent factor is 36.2%. We also know that typically the worst drawdown is more likely ahead
1764.02s: of us than not. So this looks like if you were to use the S&P 500 for your benchmark here.
1773.30s: And let's look. This is a 20 let's not use the 20 year time frame. Let's do a 10 year time frame
1779.46s: because this will be more advantageous. So what is the average annual return for the S&P 500 for
1788.34s: the past 10 years? Let's see. As can chat you PT, it won't be fully accurate because it'll use
1796.18s: slightly skewed data, but it'll be close enough. I normally would tell people 8 to 15% depending
1801.46s: on what window you use. So this says average annual return for the S&P 500 from
1807.62s: D's 2014 to D's 2024 is 11.3%. Proximate 8% adjusted by inflation. So that's literally perfect,
1817.54s: right? That gives us 11 points, 3% will leave inflation out of it for now, 11.3%. So based on our
1828.18s: rudimentary research over this 10 year time frame, we saw that for the S&P 500, the average return
1836.58s: 11.3%. And we saw that the biggest drawdown here was 36.2%.
1846.66s: So what does that tell us? We're literally looking to about 80% positively outperform.
1854.58s: So the average returns, we're looking to add about 80% onto that. So then what do we think our max
1862.26s: drawdown is going to be better or worse than this? It's probably going to be worse, like that's
1868.66s: the reality of it. Now are there things we can do to control it? Sure. But this is a planning factor.
1876.26s: So maybe it's not going to have to be 80% worse, but maybe we say max drawdown tolerance would
1884.18s: be something like 40%. And if that's too high and you say like, well, damn, I don't want a 40%
1889.78s: drawdown, guess what? Lower your fucking annual target. These are your choices. Now what you'll
1896.66s: find is as you become more refined as a trader, you can definitely achieve pretty solid annual
1905.14s: returns with lower risk. That's been the case for me this year, last year, the year before,
1910.50s: so far, some of my best years trading have fallen into that exact thing. So what I'm trying to do
1916.74s: is help you shape reasonable goals for that interim period. You're not a brand new person.
1922.90s: You've been trading for a couple of years. So you're past the greater than zero first two years.
1928.02s: Now you're in like the three to five year window, three to six year window trying to get
1933.78s: that consistent performance of your account to align with what you want. And you don't have
1940.66s: everything fully fleshed out yet, right? That's why we're in a foundation's live stream right now.
1945.30s: So this I actually think is probably a reasonable planning factor to start with, something close
1953.38s: to this. Okay. So if we get rid of all this, we now have our goals 20% annual return 40% max drawdown.
1962.90s: That's what all of that work amounts to. So now we can get rid of this. We have our goal.
1971.38s: First things done goal 20% 40% MDD.
1983.54s: And by the way, 40% is really large. If you hit a 40% max drawdown, it really does mean that
1989.06s: you're probably fucking up pretty bad. This like I've never I've never personally hit that even
1995.62s: when I had my worst drawdown on the portfolio is still sub 40%. So just giving you context.
2004.50s: Now we've already defined our risk, right? Based on the goals, we took care of both of these upfront.
2011.86s: So we have our return target. We have our initial risk parameter. Next thing we need to do,
2018.82s: this is step one and two. Next thing we need to do three is we need to build a toolbox of profit
2026.90s: mechanisms. So help me. The way that I would personally attack this is I would start with some general
2044.42s: concepts. The first one is markets drift up.
2054.50s: Why does this matter? Because it's going to change what kind of strategies are more relevant to me.
2060.42s: The next thing is we know tech is higher beta, but higher return.
2074.26s: This is relevant because when I first started trading, it was still during the period where small
2080.90s: caps growth stocks tended to outperform large cap stocks. This is a relatively new phenomenon over
2087.30s: the last decade or so where you start to see the massive outperformance of large cap stocks over
2095.14s: everything, very concentrated in tech. But that's a important theme to be aware of.
2102.42s: So with these in mind, and we know that we're trying to be consistent,
2108.66s: we just said that we want to hit at least 20% per year. So what does that immediately tell us?
2116.26s: It immediately tells us that we cannot just build a portfolio based on market beta because the
2126.66s: market goes down. So if the market is down and your portfolio is down, you're not hitting that
2133.94s: consistent return target. Now, one of the things that I would remind newer traders is one of the
2142.74s: simplest ways to outperform the S&P 500 is not inherently to hit 20% every single year.
2150.90s: But you can set a bifurcated target that something like hit 20%
2157.94s: if the S&P 500 is up and then be greater than zero if the S&P 500 is down.
2166.18s: This will still lead to really, really strong performance. So just giving you another way to think
2171.86s: about that. Okay, so we know this effect that markets tend to go up. That tells me that when I'm
2180.10s: building my profit mechanisms and I'm thinking of different kinds of profit mechanisms,
2184.90s: price direction up needs to get a little more attention. So maybe I think I need to build one to
2192.34s: two strategies here to start. Then I need something for price direction down.
2200.10s: Maybe one strategy here to start. And then maybe for volatility, we trade things like risk premiums,
2211.06s: we could use one to two strategies for this. And then maybe for that's probably enough to start.
2220.82s: Like I wouldn't start playing with like relative vol and pairs trading and stuff like that.
2226.10s: Keeping this palatable for like a starter level, I think that this is a pretty diverse toolkit.
2231.70s: This allows you to effectively trade every market condition. So we have a few profit mechanisms
2238.18s: to start tinkering with. So now we know that we're going to trade price direction up in one to two
2244.90s: ways, price direction down and risk premium. So we now need to research different profit mechanisms.
2253.86s: And again, we've already have them generally outlined. So let's start with price direction up in our
2258.18s: two different profit mechanisms that we think we're going to trade. So this could be something like
2263.30s: breakouts and drift slash momentum. For price direction down,
2277.78s: this could be something like momentum. For risk premium,
2285.22s: we could play something like skew. We could play something like
2294.98s: vol contraction from earnings release. I think this one's probably better for a starter.
2303.38s: So skew might be something we add on later. So Shahzad says vol crush, that's exactly right. So vol
2310.90s: around the expected around earnings expectations is solid. Reese says P drift, which is solid for price
2320.10s: direction. So here we now have our homework. Our homework is to research these different profit
2330.98s: mechanisms to figure out how these work. Trading or options says sideways. It's a good point. So sideways
2339.14s: is covered through risk premium. So through the volatility trading. And if there is no volatility
2346.66s: trading, there's still going to be breakouts and breakdowns. The market is never flat. It's never flat.
2354.50s: So there's always a few things you can tinker with. I'm going to the door for Thorough Real Quick.
2369.54s: All right. So we have our first steps complete. We know what our profit mechanisms are now.
2389.06s: We know what our goals are. We know what our risk tolerance is.
2394.50s: Hello, what is skew? What is vol er? Thank you. Ernest. Of course, Ernest. Great questions.
2404.02s: So volatility er simply means the behavior of volatility around earnings releases. So you can play
2412.66s: the expansion into the release and then the contraction post release. Skew is the imbalance
2422.82s: in volatility relative to calls and puts. And I'll show you so that it's more visual.
2433.14s: Now let me give it a listen so it's not confusing. So if we go into S&P or whatever ticker you
2439.70s: want, it doesn't matter. And if we take a look at the options chain and I'll show it to you in
2445.14s: another way in a second, but I think that this will make it a little easier. We look at the first
2452.10s: 30 delta put. The first 30 delta put that we see is priced at 21.68% vol. Let's go to the first 30 delta call.
2466.34s: We literally have to go further. That's actually kind of funny.
2472.50s: The first 30 delta call is priced at 16.07% vol. What do you notice? It's the same delta.
2487.94s: It's the same expiration call. vol 16.07 same delta on the put side put vol 21.68.
2504.18s: A big big difference in the amount of vol priced into each of these options. That's what skew
2512.26s: pertains to and skew exists because the market tends to be here. It's not really fear, but
2519.70s: they'll overpay to hedge to the downside because they don't want to deal with it.
2524.26s: And I'll show you one other way to look at it just for a good exercise. If we look at that same
2531.94s: expiration, what was that? The 20 jones. Let's grab the 20 jones here. Notice the different levels
2543.78s: of vol relative to spot price. So spot price is 56.59. 56.59. So it's like in here somewhere.
2556.26s: Notice the put side relative to the call side. Even if we move equidistant out equidistant out
2564.10s: equidistant out as far as strikes or delta same same in this context, you'll notice that the puts
2571.22s: are way more expensive than the calls. That is skew shown to you in two different ways in the
2580.98s: options chain and then also in the volatility surface. So that's what skew is.
2589.22s: Okey-Doke. Back now to our plan. So we have our strategies here and let's pretend so that we don't
2599.22s: spend too much time, but let's pretend that we already built our trading plan. We already built
2606.10s: our trading log because we spent some time researching these effects. Now to make sure that we
2613.38s: at least have an idea of how to research these effects, all we need to think about first is what can
2620.50s: we find with respect to existing research? And again, let's literally click through it together
2627.22s: so that you can see this process live. So I would use Chachupete now to be completely honest,
2634.18s: because Chachupete is incredible. But let's just pretend that Chachupete wasn't as much of a thing.
2642.42s: And let's take a look at stock markets momentum.
2655.86s: I'm on SSRN, social science research network. And I'm looking and I'm first focusing on
2664.58s: just understanding these different profit mechanisms. And I'm reading what research exists.
2671.54s: You can learn a lot by literally just understanding what other research has already been done
2678.82s: on the topic. You don't need to reinvent the wheel here. So I literally would skip through a bunch
2685.78s: of these. So for example, I personally would still read these ones about other stock markets,
2693.14s: but I wouldn't waste a lot of time on them. I would simply try to understand what the overall
2699.22s: approach being applied is to understand how other smart people think about the concept of momentum.
2706.50s: But I wouldn't worry about the specific details, the outputs and stuff like that because the fact
2711.06s: of the matter is the Vietnamese stock market is so fucking different than the US stock market.
2716.74s: And a lot of that stems from liquidity, which is a big part of momentum. So that all aside,
2722.10s: you can still learn from these. So this is what I would do for these different profit mechanisms.
2726.26s: And if you're not even sure on what to start with based on these profit mechanisms,
2731.70s: I literally have a few videos that talk about profit mechanisms. So I'll throw a link.
2740.18s: I will throw a link to that in the notes. One sec. Here.
2748.02s: So this video goes through a series of different profit mechanisms in case you have no idea where to start.
2758.90s: Okay. Now back to our example. We just fast forwarded time. We spent a few dozen hours researching
2767.54s: these profit mechanisms. We started building our trading plan and our trading log around them.
2774.42s: And we know the kind of things that generally matter to them, at least as far as we guess.
2779.30s: So now it's when we actually start placing trades. And it's typically, in my opinion, best to start with
2786.58s: paper trading. So literally let's do this exact thing. So what I think would make a lot of sense
2795.14s: is if we use on demand and we go back in time. And we can go to a random point in time if you want
2802.98s: or we can do like the recent markets or something, whatever you prefer. Let me know.
2808.74s: But what we can do now is literally try and build an actual portfolio in the actual market,
2818.10s: add an actual point in time and see what happens. This is the meat and potatoes of the session today.
2825.54s: So do you guys want to go back to a random point in time that none of us know? Or do you want to go back
2831.54s: and look at maybe a period that we do know, but to stress test the way that we would set up. What do you
2840.42s: guys think entirely your pick?
2857.06s: Looks like no preference. Shahzad says random time. Let's do that. I think it's fine. It literally
2865.86s: doesn't matter that much. So let's go to 2021. Kind of a boring year overall.
2883.86s: What did the market do that? Oh, no, that was actually, let's go to 18.
2896.26s: This is better. I want to pick something that's
2903.22s: actually completely different. All right. So the first part of this process, always
2912.42s: when we're starting to build a portfolio works off of this. And this is again available in another
2923.38s: video about portfolio management. So I'm not going to spend a bunch of time on it. I am going to
2931.38s: give you a link so that you can check it out at your leisure. It will go further in detail.
2937.38s: But this process will always start with this coming up with the disposition about what's going on.
2942.74s: Now we won't know that. I honestly don't remember this for 2018. I don't remember what like the
2948.82s: big things were. So we're just going to go without that part. The reason why that part does matter
2954.98s: though is because it helps us understand what ideas we might want to run. And a great example of
2961.06s: this is the what I gave you earlier about the performance of small caps relative to large caps
2967.14s: and specifically large cap tech. That sort of thing. So in order to simulate that, I'm literally
2973.62s: just going to look at the broad market really quick and see how everything is doing across the
2978.58s: board so that we can come up with some general themes. So the first thing that I'm noticing is
2986.18s: everything is essentially at local highs. I see VIX is obscenely low. In the 10 handle,
2996.42s: the recent pop that it had was to like 14. So we're talking about a super low super low volatility
3006.26s: period here for sure. We see yields down slightly in bonds have been climbing up on the long end
3017.22s: of the curve. I see materials is hitting highs, energy at highs, financials has been rotating
3024.10s: sideways a little bit longer than everything else. Notice how this big gap up and still pressing
3030.18s: highs. This has been about linear movement up to highs. But if you take a look at XLF, big difference.
3036.18s: XLF is literally rotating sideways. Why does all this stuff matter? It's because this is ultimately
3041.62s: how we're going to build a portfolio is by employing these very ideas. Then we have industrials
3049.06s: essentially rolling up to highs. Tech is rolling down and it's underperforming slightly.
3057.06s: Then we see staples sideways. Real estate is doing poorly. So again, if we're looking for some
3064.50s: short ideas, we have two places to look now. We have inside financials looking for weakness there.
3071.62s: And then we have inside of real estate looking for weakness there. We can also see utilities is
3076.82s: getting smashed. Another place to look for weakness. Then we see healthcare is rallying but still
3085.62s: not closing in on prior local highs. And then we see discretionary is crushing it. So right now,
3092.90s: based on this rudimentary overview, skipping a lot of other analysis that we don't have access to
3098.26s: because it's back in time, this is exactly how I would start building the portfolio. Now, I want to pivot
3106.74s: and I want to look at stuff as it sits literally today. I wanted to give you an example using a random
3115.22s: point in time how to build this market context to then start building trades. And that's exactly
3122.82s: what would be done in this context. What we just did and then looking for trades in that exact
3127.94s: way. But now I want to actually use like today and talk about putting on this portfolio today.
3135.86s: So let's do that. So we know that the market has been rotating sideways. We know that volatility
3142.90s: has been elevated massively so. And again, it's important to remember things in context.
3148.10s: It's down big from its local highs. But again, compared to what you just saw where VIX was hovering
3154.26s: in the tens in 2018. This is double and some on top of that.
3161.54s: So that gives you a good barometer for different volatility regimes and then potentially different
3168.90s: ways to trade these different volatility regimes. So VAL is a much bigger component to what we're
3175.46s: going to be looking at in building this portfolio. So then I'm going to skip over looking at these
3182.26s: individual sectors. And we're literally just going to start. It's effectively using that same
3187.38s: process that I showed you before. But I already have done all this. So I know where things sit today.
3193.78s: Okay. So the next piece we need to define is what size portfolio are we trading?
3206.90s: So let me know what size portfolio we want to simulate here. And then that will
3213.54s: impact what we do. I'm erasing this stuff so that we can continue logging our notes while you
3223.30s: guys let me know what size portfolio we're going to trade. So our profit mechanisms, we're going to
3227.54s: have PD up. And this is going to be done via breakouts. And momentum. Then we're going to have PD down.
3238.90s: This is going to be done via momentum. Then we're going to have VAL. This is going to be done via
3251.70s: risk premium. This is going to be focused on earnings releases. So we have our general approach.
3262.10s: Now we need to map strategies to these and all that kind of stuff, but that's going to depend on
3266.42s: the size of our portfolio, which is the next input. 100K got it. So we have a $100,000 portfolio.
3278.18s: So we know at the end of the year, we're trying to make 20K. And we know that we can experience
3285.46s: drawdowns of up to 40K. And this is all just the general starting phase. And if we take that 20K
3296.26s: and we break it down into the 12 months, that gives us 1667.
3307.70s: So we know we need to put on enough to at least clear this amount.
3312.74s: So now let's actually take a look at putting on this portfolio. And again, what I'm showing you
3318.10s: right now is step five. So I can scoot this out of the way because we're actually going to move now
3328.42s: into a workbook. I'm going to grab a quick screenshot of this so that I don't have to click
3338.82s: back and forth. We'll hide that now. Let's move into our workbook. We'll add a new one just for
3346.50s: the sake of this. We'll add our notes off to the side until we don't need them.
3354.18s: So we're going to have account value is 100,000.
3359.78s: Our target percent return
3375.62s: is 20%
3376.90s: target dollar return
3386.98s: this times this
3388.58s: this
3394.58s: MDD 40%
3397.78s: MDD percent 40%
3402.66s: MDD dollar
3406.74s: this times this. So now to give you some just general things that I normally would tinker with,
3415.38s: I would color code these normally I input some sort of color for the cells that I have to input.
3422.50s: And it literally just makes it faster for me to move through stuff just to give you at least an
3428.34s: idea. So now we're going to look at
3432.90s: actually building the portfolio based on today. And I'm going to move us back in time like two
3444.10s: weeks. And it's just so that we can fast forward time a little bit to actually see how the stuff moves.
3450.34s: So when I say today I just mean like more
3453.94s: temporal. The reason for this is again I want to like be able to fast forward so that we can see
3460.74s: like how we're actually going to deal with these different positions and stuff. So let's go to
3464.98s: like 28 April.
3470.18s: Now the way that I do this I have a core and I have a speculative allocation with a $100,000
3478.42s: dollar portfolio. I absolutely would maintain that that's enough. So core and speculative allocations.
3495.70s: And then as a dollar, the way that I think about core and speculative allocations is how I intend
3505.22s: to make most of my money. So the way that this will work is I normally wait a covered strangle.
3515.30s: That's my overall preference. So that will probably be one of the strategies that we run from a
3520.82s: base perspective. And then the speculative is more testing different things. Now for something
3529.62s: like this based on the way that we trade, we will need to see what splits make sense. So we'll
3537.86s: get to that in a moment. We need to figure out what kind of strategies we're going to map to these.
3543.38s: So let's think about that and what might make sense from a mapping perspective. I want to edit this.
3552.98s: Let me edit you.
3559.30s: I thought I could double click and then whatever. We'll just move it over here.
3564.58s: Cool. So we know that we're going to trade breakout momentum. We're going to trade things that
3576.18s: are moving. So we can use a covered strangle for that. And then we have stuff for downside and
3582.02s: upside. This also in terms of what was going on in the market at this time is really the inside
3591.62s: of earnings. So we have a lot of stuff that we can do here. So I'm going to start by just guessing
3597.78s: at this number. And then we'll refine this as we get a little closer. And I'm going to say that
3602.18s: I'm going to put 50% of the portfolio into a core allocation. And then I'm going to put 50%
3609.14s: into the speculative allocation. It gives me enough money to play with both effectively.
3615.62s: And then again, as we put on our individual trades based on our trading style,
3620.74s: then we'll figure out if this ultimately makes sense or not or if we have to refine it slightly.
3625.62s: I think we will be okay.
3628.74s: Side note, if you don't notice, I just changed everything to Calibri. It's because, again,
3632.98s: like all of these things are small little efficiencies. But the text is still completely
3637.46s: legible, but it's a little bit smaller. So I can fit more stuff.
3642.66s: Which is why you see it like that. All right, we need to put on risk. We know that we need to make
3649.30s: 16, 17, 16, 67 per month. So this is target dollar monthly.
3660.58s: And again, I'm just doing linear. It wouldn't exactly be this, but it's fine for the sake of the
3664.90s: conversation. So we need to put on enough risk to get to here. All right, let's do this.
3670.90s: So now what I'm going to do is grab a really, really simple
3679.22s: singles style tracker.
3686.42s: This we need to squish down more for now.
3694.02s: And I'm going to compress all of these.
3698.26s: I'm not going to waste a ton of time on the trade log. I'm going to skip over, actually,
3702.50s: a bunch of this stuff. But I want you to see, again, a simple way you can start with stuff that
3708.10s: generally will always matter. So today's date is 28 April.
3716.82s: And we need to find some risk. So maybe for the core allocation,
3723.30s: I'm comfortable with risk. So maybe we use something like T triple cues.
3729.46s: And we trade a coverage triangle in here. So this will start by selling puts. So if we go out to 20 June,
3743.62s: and I'm waiting for the options chain to load, and we go to the 30 delta here,
3749.22s: we need to cash secure these. So this part matters. So we'll add one of these. Let's do
3758.98s: like here. This will be like a CSP amount. That's a slight difference for this compared to some
3766.74s: of the other stuff in here. So this will be TQs stock price of TQs in this example is 52 38.
3773.78s: We don't know how many lots just yet because we need to size things, but we just need to get some
3779.14s: risk on. So this we can kill. This will be 20 June. And then this is all fine. So we'll just do a
3793.94s: short put 30 delta is at the 47 handle. And this is again a 30 delta. I'm going to keep the
3804.82s: delta is just because I don't want to give you a bad example. The delta is really don't matter
3810.02s: for the context of this strategy, but that's okay. The premium that we're going to collect is 387.
3822.18s: And there are a couple really important caveats that come with this. I'm going to move this down
3832.18s: here. And there's a couple really important caveats with this. So what we're saying for the
3841.78s: core allocation, we're going to get 50,000. So now what I'm going to do is actually add a couple more.
3848.42s: And I'm going to include a target utilization as a percentage. And then a target. Oops. And then a
3859.14s: target utilization as a dollar. So what this means is of the money that I'm allocating to this
3870.26s: T triple Q's coverage triangle in 28 May, I need to figure out how much money I want to give of
3879.38s: this 50,000 dollars upfront. So here's how I would think about it. And again, the reason why I wanted
3885.70s: to go back just a couple of weeks is because of how crazy things are right now. I don't want to use
3890.10s: all this money, but I don't have a lot of money either. So one of my targets is going to be to put
3896.58s: on as little money as I can in order to get as close as I can to this target return overall.
3906.26s: So let's start and say that I don't want to be any more than 70% utilized.
3912.74s: So what this is going to tell me is how much money I get to use 35 grand. I get to use 35,000
3918.42s: dollars on this T triple Q's coverage triangle. So now let's figure out how many we can put on.
3926.42s: So for the cash secured put, we know we effectively just need to take our strike by the lot size
3934.50s: and multiply that by 100. So if we start with a one lot,
3942.58s: we know that we're going to need 4700 bucks.
3947.94s: So we literally can just do back of the napkin math and we can say, all right, well, I want to use
3952.82s: 35. It's going to cost this much per I can put on seven. So if I put on seven,
3958.74s: it's going to use 32,900 bucks. Okay, sick. That's a perfectly reasonable starting point.
3972.18s: So let's grab these
3984.58s: and then let's grab the
3987.06s: okay.
4008.02s: Why is control that's annoying?
4010.10s: I'm struggling to select all which is making me mad.
4029.54s: Yo, chill. What the fuck?
4040.34s: All right.
4047.38s: All I'm doing is I'm mapping it to the spot in my existing log so I can just more easily copy
4053.78s: this stuff. But for some reason, it's doing a terrible job like being able to copy everything.
4063.30s: I have to unfuck my control all.
4081.70s: All right.
4083.06s: So anyways, what I do in here is I pretty much would just build based on what
4095.46s: deltas are input and based on if the premiums positive or negative, I have it automatically
4100.42s: classified as a strategy. So in this example, if I have a delta of three and then I have positive
4108.82s: premium and I only have a delta on the put side, I know that that's a short put like that kind
4114.58s: of thing. So now we can continue. We don't really need this one. This one we can get rid of.
4129.22s: I'm just getting rid of the extra shit that we don't need.
4131.38s: Lost that will be easy.
4142.18s: Marginous lots. Yep, that's good.
4147.38s: Okay. And then this is fine. So now let's see what our
4155.78s: actual value is here. So this is going to equal cost will be our premium times lots times 100.
4170.34s: So this is going to get us to 2709. So what is the first thing that that tells me is literally
4178.26s: with this one position, I can already get what I need for the month pretty easily actually.
4187.30s: So that being said, that tells me I can actually safely size this down. I don't have to use
4196.10s: as much like we talked about in the beginning, part of this game is using as little as we can
4201.62s: in order to hit our monthly target. So maybe instead of running this at a seven lot,
4207.30s: we run it at a four lot or a five lot, which gets us directly to the target, but it uses
4215.94s: much, much, much less total money. So now,
4225.14s: let's continue. We have our first position on and this first position gets us close.
4231.38s: We also know the market is going haywire. So we don't want to just put short puts on and run
4237.06s: a covered strangle. We need to find some other things. So one of the things that I would do is find
4243.14s: some earnings plays. So I don't know if the calendar works. Actually, we just go back in time, right?
4251.62s: So let's go back to April. We're on April 28th. So let's see what earnings is there.
4258.90s: After the market, there's BYON, RIG and NUE. So what I would do now is actually analyze
4271.06s: the earnings move and I have a whole other screening process that I follow for earnings that I'm
4277.78s: not going to get bogged down on, but I'm going to give you like a quick overview so that we can see
4284.18s: if these are even suitable. So let's start with NUE and let's go to earnings.
4291.78s: And this would be a direct pass for sure. So I'm going to move this off so I can go faster,
4297.30s: but NUE is no chance. RIG is next. RIG is also not liking it. And then BYON is the next.
4309.22s: And BYON is the better of choices. So let's take a quick look at BYON.
4325.54s: And they would have reported after the close on the day here. So then what we'll do is we'll
4338.82s: literally put a position on now and we'll size it so that I mean we think it's something that at
4347.94s: least makes sense relative to the portfolio, which is I think a useful part of this exercise.
4354.82s: So let's do that. So let's say that again, this is April 28th and let's say we take a look at the
4364.90s: options chain and we want to play it for earnings. So we're going to go close in time. We're going
4370.42s: to try to play the contraction here. We can either trade one side or two sides. And again,
4380.10s: normally there would be more research, but I'm just going to play it to one side. And let's say we do
4386.50s: this 21 delta on the short side or on the put side. And then on the call side, we can run the 28 delta.
4399.62s: So this gives us 22 cents and we're risking a dollar. So if we take a look at the total risk profile
4409.94s: here, I forgot I have to go back in time here. So April 28th. Or is it this one? This one.
4420.18s: April 28th. There you go. So we can see what the total risk is here. The total risk is $78.
4432.10s: So now we can build out another part of our plan. So we can do speculative max percent risk
4444.66s: or trade. Then we can do speculative adjustable percent risk. So what we can do is we can say
4461.30s: what based on our strategies based on the research we've done, what's like a reasonable max risk
4467.14s: we can take per trade. And I think a good starting point for this kind of thing would be a percent
4473.06s: of the total portfolio. So what I would do is I would take this either times the total portfolio
4481.86s: value or towards the allocation itself. Your choice between those really depends on your
4488.74s: preference and your risk tolerance. I would maintain this off of the total portfolio.
4496.02s: And then we can also have an input risk section. So then we can say like, well, if I wanted to risk
4503.22s: a little bit more, what would the total dollars be? And then we can plot that just so that it's
4510.42s: easy calculator for us to use. So this will be dollar risk. And again, it's easy because it's
4517.86s: $100,000. So numbers are all the same. Okay. So we know that we can risk about $1,000 on this
4527.38s: earnings play. So let's go into again, 28 April, BYOM, stock prices 4.10, I just called 1.1.
4539.86s: We don't know the lot size yet because we haven't really dug into that component. We're going to be
4546.58s: in the 2 May. Days to expiration is simply expiration less the entry date.
4559.30s: Not going to worry about the width. It doesn't matter here. So let's take a look. We'll fill this in
4566.02s: really quick. I'm going to move it off so I can move a little bit faster for you.
4574.58s: So for these, the strike price I really don't care about. It's really just the delta's that
4580.02s: matter to me. So on the call side, we're at the 5 and the 6. So the 5 is a 28 delta. And then the 6
4588.58s: is a 10 delta. And then on the put side, we're at the 2.5, which is a 4 delta.
4605.46s: And then we're at a 21 delta. We're going to get 22 cents.
4611.22s: The total capital requirement for this trade is going to be defined because it's a defined
4616.50s: risk trade. So again, if we take a look at this, it's asking for $78 per contract.
4623.30s: So now we can do a little bit of math. We can say if it's $78 of risk per contract
4631.30s: and the total risk that's out,
4635.30s: normally I would just manually input it here, by the way. So actually, we'll just do that.
4650.98s: So we'll just do back of the napkin really quick. $78 risk, 22 cents total profit.
4656.90s: That this is based on a one lot. So how many contracts do we want to run?
4673.54s: And then this one we need to multiply by 100.
4675.78s: So then if we run a 5 lot, for example, we're risking $390 to make $110.
4687.70s: If we run a 6 lot, for example, so for earnings plays, I know based on my research that I
4694.50s: actually prefer to size these down. So I'm rounding it to half a percent. So my max risk allowable
4703.38s: is $500. So in this case, that would put me at about a 6 lot.
4709.38s: 6 lot is what we can do. So this will be a 6 lot. So at this 6 lot, we're going to risk 468.
4718.10s: And that will be the same as our margin, which is how much money that the trade needs.
4722.66s: The margin for this cash secured put will be different than the cash secured put amount. Typically,
4728.66s: if you have regulation T, it will be a little bit more. And then if you have
4732.66s: portfolio margin, it's a little bit less money. The reason why the difference between margin
4736.34s: and cash secured put matters is because one of the things that you'll see that we're going to do
4742.26s: is actually put on a box spread. And the reason for the box spread is because this trade here,
4750.10s: it's otherwise using $23,500. However, I'm not really needing to use all of that
4760.66s: in the trade right away. Because again, it's going to have just a standard margin requirement.
4765.86s: So if we take a look at TQs, and also notice in this entire exercise so far, I've not actually input
4772.26s: anything into the platform you don't need to. So in TQs, we looked at being in the 20 June
4780.18s: this is a pass through IRA account. So oh no, this is on demands. So it should give me reg T.
4787.06s: And we're looking at the 47s. Yeah. So what does this require as far as margin? So you can see the
4793.46s: margin requirement here. The margin requirement is $2,900 per contract. If we run five,
4799.54s: margin requirement is 15k. One of the things that I do when I'm inputting this and I'm tracking
4806.34s: this especially in a smaller portfolio is I do not take this spot margin requirement. I actually
4813.06s: take a stress tested margin requirement. So this can be something and especially in a three times
4818.34s: leverage ETF, you actually have to go out even further. So maybe I would add a slice here that as a,
4826.02s: I want to do this as a percentage. So let's say that this thing drops by 30% what's the margin
4832.34s: requirement going to be 16,897. So we'll call it $17,000. This inherently is going to allow me to
4840.82s: account for the eventual move based on market conditions. So then what I do is I generally will sum
4852.74s: the total risk that I have out the total cost and so on and so forth. So give me one second. I have
4860.82s: to make sure that the floor grabbed his food. I will be right back. I'll run this for you guys
4868.74s: in the meantime. One second.
4950.82s: He's been fed. I actually grabbed another seltzer water. He squeak in his toy. Everybody's in
4957.78s: a great spot. Let's continue. All right. So we know how much of the portfolio we're using right
4964.66s: now. So what I would do is add a thing up here below this and I would add margin utilization.
4979.46s: Total utilization. The difference between margin utilization and total utilization will allow me
4988.10s: to identify how much leverage I'm using. So margin utilization will come from this and then total
4995.06s: utilization will come from this amount. So this cash secured element will either be
5012.66s: I would code it so that it would use one or the other. So in this case all I'm going to do is
5017.46s: instead of tracking the margin total here we can track it a little bit differently to make it
5025.94s: easier to account for this. So then we're also going to need to add a box spread. So this one we
5034.26s: know is a short iron condor and the width doesn't matter for the sake of this we can just delete this
5042.02s: column. We know how much this trade needs 468 bucks but it's not a cash secured put kind of
5055.14s: trade. So I'm not going to bother with it. The total cost of this trade is going to be based on
5060.26s: the premium times lots times 100. This is how much we might be able to make from it.
5069.54s: And then percent captured all that stuff this doesn't matter.
5074.98s: Okay, so now let's add our next trade SPX. This is going to be on 28 April. This is going to be
5081.38s: an SPX. And this is to use this money. The variance between these two because well it's not
5089.30s: even the variance between them. I can use this total amount of money and I'll show you exactly how
5094.74s: what I'm going to do is pick SPX bunch of different reasons. I guess you could use XSP. I don't
5104.74s: know how liquid that is. Let's see a quick look just an acuracity XSP. And we're going to build a
5111.54s: box spread. So now the first thing is we already know to de-conflict. We have a little de-conflicting
5119.30s: all we have to do is say, okay, this expires in 20 June. When does early assignment risk likely
5125.86s: start to grow depending on how far in the money I am? Maybe a week out. So I want my box spread to
5131.30s: expire one week before this expires. So then if we see 20 June here, which is 53 days,
5141.86s: I can set this position to expire maybe on 2 June. A little bit earlier, but I'm trying to pick
5150.66s: something that will be more liquid instead of going into the weeklies. That's why I'm picking 2 June.
5156.18s: So we already know that we're going to target something in 2 June.
5162.66s: Regardless if it's XSP or SPX, I'm genuinely just curious how liquid this is.
5171.06s: It's not awful and we don't have to use a bunch of money. So this could be fine. I'm still going
5175.78s: to use SPX just because it's easier. So for SPX, we can get rid of this. We know that we need to use
5185.70s: effectively $23,500. So maybe 20,000 is enough or 23,000 is enough. So for those that don't know,
5195.70s: I have a video. I'm not going to go through all the concepts of a box spread, but it's a place
5202.50s: to park money and earn a slightly better risk-free return than the risk-free return. So
5211.70s: what we'll do is we'll say let's do a 100 points wide, something like that. So let's start and
5220.50s: let's see 500 to 600. That's pretty liquid. 13 Delta. That's not bad. So let's build one here.
5234.66s: And let's just see how liquid it would or wouldn't be.
5237.94s: So this is 100 points wide. You'll notice that it has no loss and it's because what this does is
5251.78s: it's simulating putting up essentially $9,695. So we know we could put on at least two of these.
5264.42s: So for the box spread right now, this is being priced at $9,695 at the mid, which
5271.78s: rarely you're hit at to be completely honest. So it's 100 points wide.
5278.50s: So we know our max profit is this minus this.
5282.82s: I'm 100.
5297.70s: And then this will also be times whatever the lot size is that we ultimately pick. So we're
5302.82s: going to start with the one lot. So what this is going to do is it's going to take this much money
5311.70s: from the account up front. So again, this one will be this times lot size times 100.
5319.94s: So it's going to take $9,695. And at the end of it, it's going to return to me 305.
5330.74s: So we can figure out what the annualized return and stuff is for it. I'm not going to bother.
5334.26s: The only reason to do this trade is it's typically going to be slightly better than the risk
5338.50s: re-rate. That's what you should know. So let's take a look at a two lot. A two lot's going to use
5344.26s: 19, 390. That's pretty close. Now another thing we could do is not use 100 points wide.
5353.38s: And we could do like 50 points wide. So if instead we look at a 50 point wide spread,
5360.50s: let's take a quick look at the 50 point wide. Now the difference here and you'll see in a second
5369.46s: is how many you have to put on and that does matter. Let's actually do like the 25. I literally
5376.02s: never do in this narrow. This is actually kind of cool because these will be way more liquid.
5383.46s: Oh, mother, of course not. We have to do the 30 because there's no 75.
5389.62s: So let's do the 30 to the 80. And we'll be 50 points wide. So on the 50 points wide,
5398.66s: you're going to make 4981. It's really a little too narrow. So I'm not going to bother with that one.
5405.22s: So we're just going to do a two lot of this box spread. So it'll be a two lot.
5411.38s: And this is using excess P just for fun. And the price is 549.52.
5421.70s: And we can input all this data. It really doesn't matter. I'm not going to bother.
5426.10s: The premium that we're getting
5432.66s: is going to be a negative number because we're giving money away. Essentially we're putting
5438.98s: money out. So the premium is this negative 96 95.
5456.10s: And then the margin requirement is this number. And it's, when I say margin requirement,
5464.66s: it doesn't mean that it's necessarily on margin. It literally just means how much money it needs.
5470.42s: So in this case, you can see what the net cost is. So this is going to take money out of the account.
5478.58s: So this one's taking 1900 bucks. So now you can see that our margin utilization
5486.82s: is updated to our recent number here. And then here I would have cash secured amount
5496.82s: just so I know for the things that are cash secured, how much money that's taking up.
5502.98s: And then what I typically do is I also include one for box spreads.
5507.54s: And the reason why I track box spreads separately is because it allows me to know how much money I
5518.18s: can gain access to. So I would again just build it with a formula. I'm just not wasting the time on
5523.70s: it right now. But I would have this essentially do a sum if this would do a sum if the strategy is
5531.62s: a box spread based on the margin. Okay. So this is going to be a box spread.
5540.58s: And I really only buy them. You can sell them to get the loan upfront. I just don't do that personally.
5548.10s: All right. So what do we stand to make with the portfolio as it's used right now? Well,
5556.66s: we know that we can make 1900 bucks here. We can make 132 bucks here. And then again, here we're
5562.58s: planning to make about $610. So this puts us well over our target for this month. And in terms of
5572.18s: total money being used, we're using about 37% of the total account. So we really don't have to stop
5581.94s: here though, because even though we hit our minimums, we know things like earnings plays tend to be
5588.50s: kind of crap shoots. So I typically try to put a few of those on. And we also know things like
5596.98s: playing the broader directional moves. If we think there's a good opportunity, it's typically
5601.30s: worth our time. So we could take a look at a couple more of these earnings plays and build them out.
5607.54s: And I'm not going to spend time doing that. But this is literally the process that I would follow.
5615.06s: So zooming us back out to this concept of we set our goals and by setting those clear goals,
5623.06s: we now know how much risk we might need to take in order to get there so that we can plan
5631.06s: accordingly. Because what this means is I can then sum all of the risk that I have on from the
5640.10s: individual positions. Let's say that I start this will have zero risk because it's a box spread.
5644.66s: This you could put in whatever planning factor that you want for T triple cues. You can
5649.62s: essentially say, well, what if T triple cues goes down to, well, let's use a reference. Let's
5657.22s: show you how to build this reference T triple cues. What I would do is I would literally
5662.42s: zoom the chart out in time. And I would say what kind of moves has it had? Well, it already had a
5668.42s: big part of this move. So I'm not necessarily expecting it to do another one of these, although it
5672.34s: could. So this becomes a good planning factor. So that means T triple cues down another 62.25%.
5680.42s: So what I can do is I can say, well, what would this short put be worth if cues was down at that
5686.58s: point, another 62% or I can say, what would the cash secured amount be at that point? Because
5693.54s: in reality, I probably would be assigned or take assignment. So if we have this 47 strike
5699.06s: and we're saying 62.5. So we're saying this is a percent. We can effectively see what the new
5707.62s: price would be. So it's this minus this times this, which would put us down at 1763.
5718.66s: So then if T triple cues is down at 1763, and I know that I have a five lot, so my total trade
5726.90s: size effectively would be this. So this would be my P and L at that point. Stop working.
5732.58s: So this minus this times lot size times 100. So this is the risk represented there. So 14,000
5747.86s: 67,000, 687.5. Why does this matter? Because this allows me to measure against my risk tolerance.
5760.82s: So I can go back up here and then underneath utilization.
5766.26s: So this will be current risk. So current risk equals this number.
5784.98s: And then current risk as a percentage of the total portfolio. So I know because again,
5792.66s: I know what my max drawdown is allowable to be. So it equals this divided by this 15%.
5800.66s: So we know right out of the gate that with the risk that we have on right now were okay.
5807.54s: If we experienced that broad down move, we would be within the total risk tolerance that we have.
5813.54s: So I'll take a pause here and see what you guys think. Does the exercise that we just ran through?
5822.98s: Does this make sense? And do you have any questions? Because this is like really the heart and soul
5829.06s: of what I wanted to cover with you today because this is really where in my opinion, the money is
5836.74s: made. It's by putting on and building a portfolio that's logical that is within risk parameters that
5845.38s: you want. And that I think is a fair way to start thinking about the problem set. And again,
5855.86s: I would remind you that I don't think that this is like a terminal way to look at the problem set,
5861.06s: meaning it will absolutely evolve from this what you're doing. But I think that being said,
5867.22s: this is really a super solid starting point to work off of. So that's mostly what I wanted to go
5875.70s: over with you. Now, when it comes to risk management and things like that, it's really based on the
5882.18s: individual strategies, right? Each strategy has its defined risk management approach based on what
5890.10s: we build out. So again, for something like this, the risk management really is based on size and
5896.90s: then accepting drawdown potential and sizing us in the context of that drawdown potential. This
5903.14s: is defined risk. This is saying, if I lose this entire amount of money, this is sized appropriately.
5908.98s: So that if I lose the entire trade here, that I'm okay. So by building it this way,
5917.14s: I'm making sure that I'm taking the total amount of risk that I need. But I'm not oversizing things
5927.62s: so that if the market has some sort of vicious move, that I'm not going to be completely off
5934.82s: sides. Now, the other thing is again, based on the broad market analysis, we might say to ourselves,
5943.14s: man, I actually really want to have some short deltas, right? Because if we look at this portfolio
5950.34s: and we bait away to it, this will be about flat deltas. This will be long deltas. This will be flat
5957.14s: deltas. So maybe we say, I want to scrub some of those long deltas. Well, then we go into our bag
5964.02s: for finding price direction down stuff and layering that on. But this literally is the entire process.
5970.34s: So if you have any questions, now is the time. And then if not, in the meantime, I will talk to you
5981.46s: a little bit about what's the next session is going to be about. And the next one is actually the
5989.78s: finale for our little mini series here on outlier options trading foundations. And the next one is
5998.50s: going to be the evolution of your holistic approach as a trader. So what that includes is
6008.26s: building a comprehensive method to then take what we just went through, which is the positioning
6019.54s: of the portfolio, right? Like the building of the portfolio. It's taking those concepts.
6025.70s: And then it's moving it one step further. And it's saying, okay, as I get information in from
6035.06s: the performance of this stuff, how do I make decisions? How do I optimize what I'm doing based
6042.42s: on what's happening in the market? A good example for this could be during the earning season,
6049.14s: based on your back testing for the strategies and what you think they're supposed to do, you
6052.74s: start to notice that you're losing just a higher percentage than you typically would expect to.
6057.70s: Well, that doesn't necessarily mean don't trade them anymore, but it definitely would tell me,
6062.42s: I'm not going to size it at six. I might size this down another 50%. So I might take it to 0.25%
6071.46s: total risk of the portfolio. So that's the concept of like actually taking live information and
6077.38s: updating our mental models on employment so that we're not just blindly stepping in front of
6085.94s: bad risk. So that will be the next session. All right, gang, a little bit of a long one,
6093.22s: a little bit heavy. I hope it's useful. As always, if you have any questions, you can let me know,
6098.18s: be in our outlier. I'll see you guys later.
