0.60s: what's up Apes today we're going to take
3.08s: a look at GameStop so two things on the
5.20s: agenda we have an expiration week coming
7.64s: up so we're obviously going to look
9.24s: through all of that and I want to start
11.68s: with a quick recap of the lessons
14.36s: learned from the live stream on Saturday
17.12s: this is just where we've been diving
19.60s: into the story and the history of
21.32s: GameStop and typically after I have a
23.64s: chance to digest mentally like what I
26.00s: was looking at what we were talking
27.24s: about it's kind of fun to talk about
29.40s: from Ohio level what we discussed what
31.56s: we learned so the video on Saturday we
35.40s: spent some time actually exploring
37.48s: through the recent conversation SL idea
41.52s: that Cohen met with sailor and then the
44.80s: potential that that could mean for
47.64s: GameStop and involvement with
49.64s: cryptocurrency but there really was
51.56s: nothing we could find that either proved
54.04s: or disproved the idea so then after that
57.76s: we just went through the stock we didn't
60.08s: really see a whole lot coming out that
61.76s: looked super interesting as of last week
63.92s: other than some of the price Behavior
65.40s: based on that bitcoin news and then we
67.52s: rolled into the good old DD Library so
72.12s: the main thing I learned from the DD
73.80s: Library last week is that it spent a
75.96s: little bit of time talking about
77.72s: actually funny this is the exact thing I
79.68s: was going to mention it talked
82.04s: about
83.96s: the it talked about the broader
86.20s: landscape where a lot of seemingly
89.16s: disperate companies have shared
90.80s: interests or are even directly owned by
94.20s: some of the other companies specifically
95.92s: things like Black Rock and how that can
98.36s: create an interesting lens when you're
100.44s: looking at something like institutional
101.88s: ownership and if you're looking at a
103.44s: Stock's institutional ownership and then
105.08s: you look at the list of different
106.68s: institutions a lot of those institutions
108.68s: either have ties or bubble up into the
111.56s: same broader institution so then it kind
113.44s: of becomes the same institution
115.96s: potentially owning and exerting force
118.76s: over that company I think it's a little
120.68s: more nuanced there's obviously more
122.08s: detail to it than that but that was one
124.72s: of the interesting pieces that we came
126.48s: across all right let's get into what it
129.00s: looks like this week in general this
133.12s: move here doesn't surprise me this
135.28s: largely came about when we did get the
137.60s: news Well news when news coverage
140.96s: started to pick up this idea that
143.56s: GameStop might be getting involved in
146.80s: Bitcoin one of the things to remember is
148.56s: that there are a lot of investors and
151.92s: less involved entities in the markets
154.76s: that they don't really necessarily
156.80s: directly involve themselves until there
158.96s: is some sort of news article written
160.52s: about it so that's why you see this news
163.88s: driven event because a lot of people are
165.36s: like well wait a minute we already saw
166.92s: this picture that picture is not new
169.00s: this is something that's kind of been
170.68s: talked about for a little while now so
172.36s: why now why today and and today being
176.00s: the 14th and that's simply because the
178.56s: news cycle started to to pick it up and
180.68s: talk about it on the 13th into the 14th
184.52s: so that move itself did seem overdone
188.52s: and excessive to the upside based on
190.36s: everything else and I genuinely did
193.64s: think it was probably going to come back
195.32s: down into this range this is primarily
197.96s: because this broader move is likely from
201.24s: larger institutional positions unwinding
203.60s: for one reason or another and in order
206.76s: for this to go through this kind of a
208.44s: magnitude of a significant rise and
211.12s: maintain that pace would either be from
213.32s: institutional level accumulation or some
215.28s: sort of catalyst and obviously we had a
216.84s: catalyst from the
220.20s: Bitcoin picture coming out first with
223.40s: sailor but then also after that again
226.40s: the news cycle starting to pick up on
229.28s: the event and the potential and then
231.04s: today it kind of you know gapped down a
233.40s: little bit had an inside day well gap
235.80s: down below this area not on the prior
238.04s: day and right now we're hovering right
240.92s: around
242.12s: 2697 nothing huge jumping out of me here
245.72s: volatility is still very low 74% Vol you
249.40s: can see that places is literally at a 3%
252.40s: implied volatility percentile that means
255.04s: the overwhelming majority of days for
257.12s: the past year V was higher than what it
259.20s: is right now so V is siphoning out
262.24s: volume is also drifting down even though
265.04s: we're seeing these clear Peaks where
267.20s: volume clearly is spiking in general if
269.96s: you take a look at the averages they're
271.72s: trailing down very slowly so volume is
275.32s: starting to come out of the stock from a
278.60s: volatility perspective we can see V has
280.92s: essentially been on a steady decline for
283.28s: a while now this darker yellow line
285.32s: represents 30-day V this brighter yellow
288.80s: line represents 7-Day V so a week and
292.80s: 7-Day V has been coming down for
295.00s: literally two months we've been seeing
297.16s: this happening this has actually been a
298.40s: trade I've been running for some time
299.92s: now that's just because this has been
302.04s: very very prevalent and now 30-day V is
304.92s: actually contracted massively it's gone
306.56s: from 128% that you see here and now
310.32s: again this is showing it at
312.68s: 86% is so the the VA that we're seeing
317.52s: is is really really Contracting like
320.80s: very
321.64s: significantly so let's take a look at
324.16s: the options chain I actually had
325.72s: somebody in the Discord last week asking
328.24s: about the option transactions that we
330.92s: were seeing specifically in the 21 Feb
332.92s: expiration and I I think to their dismay
335.52s: unfortunately was saying that like
337.36s: really wasn't seeing anything and I know
339.88s: that key was uh little bit excited
342.76s: because there definitely is some life in
346.20s: the options chain but it's just not that
349.88s: much that's kind of the reality as it
353.08s: sits here so what I mean by that is when
356.32s: I look at the at the monies here you can
359.12s: see that the 27s have
361.16s: 5200 open interest and then there was
363.60s: 5,800 traded today so definitely going
365.88s: to build out this front expiration a
368.60s: little bit so they're still always
370.48s: people playing the near-term price
371.96s: movements but in terms of overall value
375.12s: this option chain is not that deep
377.00s: there's just not that much in it so if
378.92s: we take a look at the total open
380.36s: interest for that option chain by itself
382.40s: the upcoming expiration there's 166,000
385.36s: calls and 40,000 puts so it definitely
388.16s: does and continues to maintain call skew
390.68s: in favor the upside that that's not
392.92s: changed however 166,000 calls in
396.32s: something like this really isn't that
398.32s: significant either based on what we
400.40s: typically see in here if I zoom this out
402.52s: this is all the way down to sub 600,000
405.00s: normally this will be anywhere from 7
408.32s: 800,000 the high fives is a little bit
411.32s: low now the good part here though is
414.28s: there's still massive call skew compared
416.84s: to put skew which that's great because
419.20s: we are actually at one of the largest
422.80s: call to put oi SKS that we've seen in a
425.80s: while so even though total oi is lighter
428.80s: it's very heavy on the call side and a
431.72s: lot of people play this from a pot od's
433.96s: perspective because you never know
435.44s: what's going to send GameStop just
437.92s: flying right and it could be the cat
441.04s: throws a tweet out it could be a million
443.04s: different things that's kind of how the
444.16s: stock moves that what's one of the
445.56s: things that makes it so interesting but
448.36s: so it's cheaper to hold this now on a
451.00s: relative value these are very expensive
453.48s: the volatility on the call side which
455.12s: I'll show you right now tends to be very
457.48s: very expensive which you can still see
459.72s: that here right if we look in these
461.28s: front expirations notice how high this
464.72s: call IV shoots out that's the purple
467.40s: line and the blue line for your
468.60s: reference purple lines 21 Feb the 28 Feb
472.56s: is the blue line and you can see how
476.04s: high these IVs shoot out for these
478.40s: out-of-the money calls
480.00s: what that tells you is the market is
483.20s: essentially pricing in
485.16s: severity in that direction this is the
487.48s: market saying at this point it can
489.52s: either crash or it can fly to the upside
492.72s: and because the levels are very similar
496.04s: you don't really know which one and to
498.12s: give you a context of what this normally
499.56s: looks like if we go over to Apple here's
502.60s: typically what you will see I'm going to
504.88s: limit this to just these front two
506.44s: series to give you the same example this
508.24s: is typically what you see
510.24s: typically what you'll see is the front
512.24s: expiration will be slightly higher than
515.20s: the followon expirations and in
518.04s: companies that just tend to grow and
520.76s: expand over time like apple tends to do
523.88s: you often will see the call side much
526.84s: lower than the put side so what this is
529.80s: is the market pricing in severity to the
532.04s: downside bigger potential move but a
534.28s: higher probability move to the upside
537.36s: now if we compare this to what we were
539.52s: just looking at in GameStop it's a bit
541.72s: of a different
543.28s: story the market is essentially pricing
545.88s: in severity to both directions it
548.40s: doesn't know which way it's going to go
550.00s: it's scared and it's pricing in heavy
552.08s: Vols to the upside because we all know
553.88s: GameStop can crack off to the upside big
556.92s: giant moves very quickly and again based
559.00s: for a Litany of different reasons and it
561.12s: could absolutely crater to the downside
563.16s: for the same thing so this is a really
565.76s: interesting play and it's also why I
567.56s: still really like the coverage strangle
569.72s: in something like GameStop because of
571.48s: this kind of volatility profile it
573.48s: really is very very beneficial for that
577.28s: style of trading now the last thing I
580.92s: want to talk about though are the main
583.68s: expiration Cycles so if we go out now to
586.48s: 21 March you can see that there's only
588.84s: 51,000 calls 16,000 puts so again most
593.52s: of this volume is in these front two
595.52s: expiration Cycles now right now on the
598.12s: platform it's showing earnings on the
600.12s: 25th after the close we will see if that
602.96s: holds if we take a look at the V it
605.56s: looks like the market might be buying it
608.20s: because this jumps up to 89.7 from 75
613.04s: but then it also remains pretty elevated
614.84s: for these two so I think the market is
616.52s: probably saying it thinks it's going to
617.80s: land somewhere in this range that would
619.96s: be the expectation for the earnings
621.36s: release and just like the last one I
623.76s: have to be honest I'm very eager to see
626.44s: what the earnings release has in store
628.52s: for us because the company is still
631.32s: sitting on enough cash it can do good
634.56s: things with that cash to reinvent the
636.76s: company I just really really want to see
640.24s: how it positions out now the last thing
642.08s: I do want to show you is this so I
646.80s: noticed that even though the volume so
649.72s: if you go up here really quick you'll
651.00s: see that there's 130,000 calls against
652.88s: 23,000 puts but if you take a look at
655.68s: the volume of options today but then you
657.80s: take a look at the total premium between
660.04s: calls and puts right so put premium 1.9
663.48s: mil call Premium 15.6 mil total 17 A5
668.84s: there are still a lot of deep calls in
672.36s: terms of the skew overall value traded
674.84s: in the calls but a lot of these are
676.92s: short calls and there are people selling
679.80s: calls in these very regularly and again
681.64s: if you're holding the stock it can make
683.80s: a lot of sense to do that because of how
685.40s: elevated the volatility is you're
686.80s: getting paid to hold something that
687.92s: you're holding anyways
689.84s: so this is interesting just because the
692.80s: total call Value I track this pretty
695.12s: closely and a lot of times it'll
697.40s: maintain about this kind of spread
699.00s: between calls and puts but a lot of
701.88s: times we'll see a little heavier bullish
705.40s: skew on the premium as compared to the
707.48s: bearish skew and this is just guessing
709.84s: by the way when it says bullish versus
712.08s: bearish it's guessing based on where the
714.08s: call or put transacted at so if I sell a
717.80s: call they view that as bare bearish it's
719.96s: not necessarily bearish because if I
721.56s: sell a call against long shares I still
723.44s: want the stock to go up that's where my
724.80s: Max profit is so just when you see this
726.96s: always keep that context in mind it's
728.56s: not exactly as simple as that but the
732.12s: company itself still hanging in there I
735.40s: think we need to see how does it behave
738.64s: in this General now widening
742.32s: consolidation Zone because this is a
744.72s: pretty big consolidation area from 282
747.44s: essentially down to 252 that's that's a
749.64s: little too big for a consolidation Zone
751.68s: actually I think that this will probably
753.00s: narrow out somewhere in here I just
755.20s: don't know where so as always anything I
758.04s: should take a look at let me know be an
759.88s: outlier I'll see you later
