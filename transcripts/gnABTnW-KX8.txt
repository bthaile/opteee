0.00s: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. We have a familiar face, Tom Baso. Welcome back.
7.92s: Hey, good to be here.
9.84s: So here we are post election. And we were actually just talking about a bunch of physical ailments.
16.88s: The market so far is experiencing seemingly very few of those. The market obviously had this massive,
23.60s: massive post election outcome rally. I'd love to start there with what you thought about the market
31.76s: positioning leading into the election and then the reaction post election. Going into the election,
37.84s: I saw extreme volatility, my position sizing algorithms are measuring the increased risk and
44.24s: volatility and downsizing my reversal trades. In some cases, one day I actually
51.60s: right after the election when the market went up 1500 on the Dow, I actually got some risk
57.44s: peel off trades across the entire portfolio. The whole portfolio risk is measured by aggregating
64.32s: all of the positions together, got over my tolerable limit and I had to peel off kind of one contract
72.08s: of everything just to get back down underneath the limit that I set for myself. And from that point on,
80.32s: I think I've seen two markets that have gone nuts that I've had to peel off one contract or
86.64s: something. But volatility continues. You get moves like, man, today Coco was up 678 points.
98.16s: And that's after, you know, like, what, five days ago, it was somewhere around 2,000 points down
108.40s: from where it is now. Those are some serious moves. You know, bonds caving in, stocks were
116.40s: down across the board today. So we'll see whether this is just a pullback or people getting nervous.
121.92s: But what I saw before the election versus after, and before the election, there was a lot of
129.04s: reversal trades. Everybody's guessing, okay, this is going to be good. This is going to be bad.
135.68s: And you get one day, it looks like all things going to cave in. And next day, it looks like it's
140.24s: pie in the sky ready to go. And I'm just kind of following my strategy and running right through it
146.96s: and hopefully keeping the position sizes down. And that was a drawdown for me, right? Before the
154.80s: election, it was drawdown city. Right after the election, a lot of markets just made up their mind
161.12s: and started running. So it broke that whatever the sideways at each market was going in,
167.76s: someone to the upside, some to the down, I have to say out of some 38 markets, I've got right now,
176.72s: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven out of 38 markets are to the upside.
183.92s: All right. It's lighter than I would have expected.
190.16s: There are some that are to the upside like Coco and coffee and that type of thing, but
195.92s: that's just the positioning. And remember, I'm trading seven strategies and I've got short-term ones
203.60s: that are sort of counter trend and they jump in real quick. So those have already shifted to the
208.96s: downside on stocks. The longer-term ones are still upside for the most part, although some of those
214.64s: are starting to pick over to the downside. So where it goes from here, anybody guessed my favorite
221.44s: saying the market will do, at the market will do. When jobs, the traders, the go along for the ride,
226.88s: and I try to enjoy the ride when I can. And so I don't try to necessarily predict what'll happen next,
237.44s: but the news is coming out fast and furious on what's happening in the new administration.
245.92s: And a lot of the purported proposals that Trump has espoused, I think from my amateur behavioral
256.80s: economic analyst viewpoint, I think would be very positive for the economy. So I could see
264.80s: the stock market being happy about what they're hearing. Now, lots got to happen before it
273.60s: kicks in. You're talking first a whole lot of approvals of the cabinet. You've got all sorts of
281.04s: laws that need to be passed, executive orders that need to be signed. Economy, the size of
289.92s: the United States does not turn around on a dime. It's going to take months and maybe
296.48s: multiple quarters to even see any kind of effect in some traction and the numbers starting to turn.
303.44s: And there may be some tougher periods before it catches and really starts paying it off. But I
311.44s: think he's on the right track. I think a lot of these proposals are spot on. I think they'll really,
317.36s: really help the US economy long term. A bunch of questions. I want to start with one of your
323.92s: comments first because it's something that I typically actually say myself and I find a lot of people
332.16s: seem to struggle with what I mean when I say it. So I'm curious how you would explain it to
336.56s: somebody. When you say something like you try not to predict the market, right? You try to go
342.00s: along with what the market is doing. I actually know exactly what you mean. However, a lot of people
347.84s: they struggle to understand how that actually reflects positioning because no matter what,
354.08s: if you have an open position, it is some sort of forecast of expected future price behavior.
360.16s: So how would you explain that to somebody when they say how does that work?
365.36s: Well, what I try to think about it, I say to people is that I like to try to trade in the now.
372.88s: In the zen, like experience of at this moment in time, this second, this minute, this day,
380.16s: this year, the markets are doing something at this moment. When I look down 38 markets and I
388.72s: analyze them by way of seven different types of indicator combinations and parameter sets and
395.76s: everything else, I can rate each one of those 38 markets as being in an up or down direction.
404.56s: So at this moment, I want to be in the same direction as all those markets up or down.
411.36s: I'm completely agnostic. I have no clue why Coco is going up like it did today.
416.72s: But I'm long. So it was my largest position profit today.
424.00s: And I don't sit there and analyze it and say, well, I should peel off some positions. I have
430.80s: algorithms for that even. I'm willing to hold a certain percentage of my equity in a
437.60s: Coco position or a coffee position or a corn position or whatever else, a stock position.
443.52s: And whenever the risk level and the volatility level as a percent of my equity gets too high,
450.88s: I take off just enough to get back down to an acceptable level. So I've even got that algorithmized.
457.20s: I've tried to think through what me as a human, what I as a human trader would want to do in different
466.48s: types of scenarios. And in the end, I just want to be right now. I want to say my risk level is
473.36s: this, my volatility levels this, my equity at this second is that I have indicators that say,
479.92s: this is up or this is down. And I want to take all that together and it gives me the direction I
485.92s: should be in, how many contracts I should hold. And, and then I total it up and see if my portfolio
493.28s: is getting overweighted because maybe all these markets are correlating with each other or
497.76s: something. And I want to keep my risk managed. And then I'm done. I don't need to predict anything.
503.28s: I because the moment that I'm doing all this is now, but tomorrow is going to be another moment in time.
512.00s: And I'm going to have changes. I'm going to have some of these shorts go along and I'm going to
516.24s: have some of the longs go short. I'm going to have a whole bunch of positions that just stay the
520.40s: same direction as they stay. And I'm just going to wait for those big runs. The big runs pay the
526.16s: freight. All these small runs that go back and forth, you know, market flips back and forth six
532.32s: times in, in six weeks, that's going to be a loser for me. But I'm going to limit those losses and
538.80s: make sure that they're very small. Then you get on the, the larger runner, which seems like at one
545.28s: any one time, stocks have been doing really well this week, pretty much after the, after the election,
554.00s: generally up a few softs here and there on the commodity side have done well. The corn and
562.80s: some of the grains are in a trend to the downside. That's been profitable. So at a good day in the
568.32s: grains today. And so you, you just kind of try to find where there's a trend and in that instant,
576.80s: you make sure your portfolio's positioned with that snapshot in time. And then you feel freed up
584.80s: to make another snapshot in time tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the next day.
589.84s: So I'm not really making a prediction. I'm just positioning my portfolio the way the market's
594.72s: reacting today. It's a really great way to kind of explain the process because for me,
601.60s: I typically would say I just use like a Bayesian approach, which is exactly what you're describing.
606.80s: Right. It's based on updating your probabilities based on new information. So I like that as a
612.24s: descriptor. Like I said, it's something that the problem with your description is most clients or
617.12s: most traders when you say the one like a nasian. Yeah. Yeah. I lost. Yeah.
625.68s: Exactly. I'm saying in the now it's a zen-like thing.
629.52s: I need to work on my communication skills. They're not great. It's a Mr. Serenity type thing.
636.16s: Yeah. Yeah. So one of the things that I'm interested though, kind of finding this balance between,
645.44s: you know, trading what exists now and in forecast opportunities. One of the things that I find really
652.24s: interesting and even lucrative at the point is when we have Trump and his, you know, policies
659.60s: flooding the market, people starting to speculate, okay, it looks like windmills, probably not going
666.32s: to do super great. He's not a big fan of windmills. Apparently, I don't know if you saw the podcast
670.16s: with Joe Rogan, but he was talking about how it messes up the whales. I didn't even know that.
673.60s: That's new news to me. Yeah. They make a noise that hums and messes with the whales navigation system
682.24s: and communication systems. Isn't that the coolest thing about markets though? Is that you have an
686.56s: opportunity to learn about some sort of interaction between a thing in whales? I never would have known that.
692.40s: Yeah. I think I saw that someplace. I don't know if it's been an internet but that's the speculation
696.88s: of why so many whales are washing up in New Jersey and other places. Is that building the windmills?
703.92s: Which is fascinating. And so as I see these different policies though coming out from Trump,
709.36s: it seems like there are some fairly predictable themes coming in front of us, right? One of them
714.96s: is oil. He clearly is a fan of oil, wants to tap more into oil. So then some traders are probably
720.88s: speculating, well, I think oil goes up at some point. Maybe now maybe, you know, six months from
725.52s: now, now, now, now. Is that something that would get you to venture into individual trades
731.44s: and you're staying in futures, going to trade oil as a commodity as that moves whenever
735.28s: it goes? I trade oil. I trade natural gas, trade unleaded gas in New York. Those are the three
743.52s: energies, I think, that I'm in. Haven't gotten into trading a Brent crude that involves a little more
750.80s: complexity and I'd rather keep my life simple. Why is that the case? I think it's traded in
759.44s: UK. So therefore you end up with British pound conversions and you know, interactive brokers
765.68s: can handle the transaction. I know that, but I would have to sign up for data. I'd have to sign up,
772.32s: you know, there's exchange fees or whatever to to get the data. Then there's one more ticker to
779.20s: keep track of. Yeah, you know, there's this just to add one market takes me sometimes to get it
790.24s: into the automated process, check everything out, involves a week or two of, you know, working on
798.80s: specs and making sure the specs are in the computer right and dealing with whatever currency risk
805.36s: I might have with that particular market. Some things are priced in US dollars and makes it a
810.00s: lot easier for me since I'm a US guy. But if you don't get trade it in UK pounds, then you would have to
820.24s: you know, realize that you're going to end up with a UK pound position. You could either hedge that
823.84s: position or you could just treat it as another speculance of the position and let it run as a hedge
831.04s: against your US dollar. So you have to kind of look at that, make decisions, see if you want to
836.72s: deal with that risk with an actual night strategy, eight strategy or night strategy would be your
842.72s: currency hedging strategy or something. And then you'd have to make sure you periodically zero out
851.36s: that risk if you wanted to zero it out. There'd be, it's, you got to think through a lot of details,
856.72s: make sure all the eyes are dotted, cheese are crossed. And then I give it the green light and we
861.84s: start trading it. And I've added probably about three or four markets, three, maybe three markets in
871.04s: the last three months roughly. I'm trading iron ore and Singapore. I'm trading rapeseed in Canada
883.04s: or canola if you choose. And I'm also trading the VIX on the CMB. Is that good? That's good
889.92s: to VIX this. Let me see. Sure. No, it's CBOE. It's the volatility index.
896.72s: Do you vote? Yeah. And the futures is traded on the SCFE, whatever that is.
904.08s: When you're going through the process of deciding to add new products, how does, how does that work?
912.40s: Is it you're taking something out of your basket of stuff and putting something in or do you see
917.76s: something that's moving? Interestingly, you're like, I want to add this to my basket.
920.80s: It's not necessarily even something moving. It's something that catches my eye that has
927.20s: sufficient liquidity and movement to be a viable trading vehicle. And it's especially attracted
937.92s: if it's something like iron ore, which doesn't necessarily correlate with anything else in my
943.20s: portfolio. And has the time zone diversification of trading on a Singapore. So I like the concept
950.48s: over time. I will be trading more and more things like Brent Crude that would be in other time
956.40s: zones. And their liquidity is maybe a little bit bigger over in that time zone. And
965.04s: if something happens in the middle of the night and my crude oil position here in the states is
969.76s: not really open for trading. Maybe the Brent Crude is. You can partially mitigate some risk.
977.52s: So those types of things over time, as my portfolio keeps getting bigger and bigger,
983.52s: I'll be looking at adding more markets, no doubt. But I'm pretty careful about adding them. I don't
988.56s: just add them just to have a long list. That seems foolish on my part as a retired guy. I just
995.44s: I'm trying to keep my life easy. So yeah, and I'm interested too, because even 30-something
1003.44s: products is not insignificant. And it almost seems like in your scenario, I honestly would expect
1008.80s: like 10 to 15 and just pick stuff that's inverse, non-correlated, something like that. So obviously
1014.16s: you're finding a lot of opportunities though that you're liking the movement.
1018.00s: Yeah, and even you know, you take the four grains I just mentioned a little while ago. Today corn
1022.64s: was the big winner to the downside. But I'm short. All of them are a net short of all of them in
1029.60s: some strategies. I'm long others. I'm short net short though on all of them. And so the grains
1035.76s: all total did very well. But what you realized when you dig into under the hood, corn was already
1042.64s: short. So I had a big day. The other soybean oil soybeans and wheat, for instance, in some cases,
1051.92s: one of them was long and flipped to the short side. And the others were short and didn't really
1057.04s: move very much. So you end up with kind of a diversification even amongst four different grains.
1065.44s: And the same thing's true. I just recently had a trade. I trade ultra buns and treasury buns,
1070.48s: ones like a 50 year horizon, the other ones 30. And or I guess ultra buns is over 30, I guess,
1079.44s: something like that. Whatever the definition is, they're slightly different on the yield curve.
1084.56s: And what you find just recently in the last month I had a trade where I was actually heavily
1090.88s: into the ultra buns one way. And I had already backed off that's treasury bond position didn't
1096.80s: get a trade. So there's a diversification even amongst something like interest rate debt,
1102.16s: you know, debt futures. So you see that from time to time, sure. There's a lot of correlation
1107.52s: between those two most of the time. And as there is in grains and meats and energy and currencies,
1115.60s: you know, right now the dollar is strong and all the non-US currencies are having a struggle.
1123.76s: You know, that'll break apart and all of sudden the British pound or the Swiss Frank will be
1127.44s: going up and the rest are going down. And I don't try to analyze it too much. You know, the direction
1136.40s: shifts I go with it. Sure. And so when you're looking at some of the policies
1146.24s: that's coming out though from from Trump, it's a lot of people are speculating and I would probably
1151.76s: agree with the majority of them that it does look like a lot of inflationary practice probably
1157.36s: coming in the short term. And the reason why a lot of people and I do agree with that is from a
1164.24s: perspective of cutting spending, which is good, but obviously that'll impact GDP. And the
1172.80s: near term impact of stuff like that. I'm wondering if you have an opinion on it. Obviously,
1179.68s: it seems like you don't think it's going to be quite as inflationary. So I'd love to learn about that.
1184.00s: I don't. For starters, negotiations using tariffs and things like that cause foreign countries to
1191.92s: have problems getting stuff into the country. If they do, it will be more expensive. But what they
1199.84s: inclined to do if there are multinational corporations, especially if you can get the 15%
1205.12s: if you build it in the United States. You just put United States into a top quartile competitive
1212.48s: position to build your next factory in the United States because that's where your market is the
1218.16s: largest. And that's where there's plentiful supply of skilled labor and AI and computer systems
1227.52s: and server systems and everything else. So if you have your choice, do you build it in Ghana
1236.72s: or someplace like that because you can get very cheap labor, but you're not even sure about the
1242.08s: legal system there. And you're like, do your factory and it might be in the middle of a revolution
1248.40s: or something a year from now or do you go to a United States where you're building it closer to
1254.88s: where you're selling it. So transportation becomes less of an issue. You get the employees you need.
1260.96s: Yes, they are more expensive, but there's more automation, there's more robotics, maybe you're
1266.72s: built a state of the art factory. So a lot of capital flow comes in when you do stuff like that
1274.16s: by way of US corporations and multinational corporations deciding to infuse capital in the United
1282.40s: States because that's the easiest decision to make. In some cases, it's the best if you make the
1289.04s: tax rate low enough, you literally are going to be the winning choice when they do the spreadsheet and
1296.48s: say we could build it here here, you know, Switzerland or we could build it in Ghana or we could build
1301.04s: it in Australia or whatever. And you start figuring it out, they start saying, well, you know,
1306.00s: US was looking like a good place to build a factory. So capital comes in more jobs,
1312.96s: more supply of things. The energy alone over the very short run won't have an effect, but over
1321.20s: this, say, six months, 12 months, if you open up energy and drive energy down, energy goes into
1327.68s: literally everything you buy. You know, the farmer has got to pay for the gas for the tractor,
1332.96s: he's got to deal with the fertilizers, which are made largely from petrochemicals.
1339.68s: I was a chemical engineer by degree. So we had a lot of petrochemical operations down in Texas
1346.48s: for instance, where you're you're cutting off a stream of product from barrel of oil and then
1352.96s: you're taking it and feeding into all sorts of other intermediaries, plastics and all sorts of
1358.80s: other things that we take for granted every day that really come from oil originally. So if you
1365.04s: drive the price of that down, you just drove the price of everything down. And so if you if you
1371.28s: can in it say 12 months cut the price of oil in half because you become the major producer in the
1377.36s: world, you just did a lot to drop the prices of food, drop the prices of plastics, drop the prices
1385.44s: of a whole lot of things. And that's anti-inflationary. I don't see some of his policies as being
1393.12s: inflationary at all. Yeah, well, and I think you hit the important point there, right? It's like
1398.16s: the different time frames because I think most people and again, myself included wouldn't expect
1403.76s: it to be inflationary long term exactly to your point. But like is your is your talking about like
1410.24s: the factories and whatnot? That's not a six month thing. No, you know, you take time. Yeah,
1414.96s: there's the build it. But and I tell you what, the Federal Reserve done what they did just before
1420.00s: the election dropping by half a point. I thought that's insane. A quarter of a point would have
1427.44s: been plenty and just leave it alone and be careful. That half point just kind of smacked up a
1433.52s: little bit of politics and a juicing. And what I worry about is then with the latest inflation
1440.48s: numbers and GDP growth and all that, some of which could be, you know, revised later, which seems
1447.20s: to happen a lot lately, you notice? You know, to me, you know, January 20th rolls around and
1457.36s: inflation is going crazy again. Then all of a sudden Trump's got another problem to deal with.
1466.96s: Who knows whether that's by design or not? I tell you what, this is such a screwed up mess.
1475.52s: The American citizen seems to be totally left out of the picture in terms of decision-making
1480.56s: sometimes, I think. But right now, I am cautiously optimistic that based on the
1489.12s: types of people he's proposing for his cabinet, the types of proposals that he very detailed,
1496.32s: articulate detailed way articulated on the campaign trail. If he can get all of those things in
1502.48s: place, there are no tax on tips, I think it's a slam dunk. And if you take over time too, right?
1511.04s: Over time, what do you do? If you take the taxes off over time, you encourage over time. You
1516.00s: encourage hustle. You encourage people to work harder, more productivity. All very beneficial to
1523.76s: the economic growth of the country, which increases tax revenues, no matter what level of taxes you
1530.96s: put on it, you're going to increase tax revenues, laugh or curve at work, drop the incremental rate,
1538.00s: increase the amount of growth, and end up with more tax revenues in the process.
1543.44s: So, I mean, all of these proposals, no tax on self-security. Those types of proposals make it
1553.04s: possible for you to fire about three quarters of the IRS agents. And I think a lot of our inflation
1560.24s: is really due to not, you know, the doge thing, the department of governmental efficiency.
1566.40s: Yeah, but yeah, half a trillion of waste and fraud in our government out of seven, something
1572.64s: trillion spent, two trillion deficit every year. You can get, whittle that down to zero easily, I think.
1581.36s: You get that down and start producing a surplus with things like tariffs and a lot more oil
1587.44s: being produced and stuff like that. All of a sudden, government revenues are increasing and
1594.00s: the economy is rip roaring and, you know, unemployment is in good shape. Everybody's having a good time.
1600.16s: And what you end up without that is running a surplus and start paying down the debt.
1605.76s: What's your perspective on the possibility of a recession sometime in like the next 24 years?
1611.52s: I know it's esoteric and there's different definitions and stuff, but just from a general perspective,
1615.60s: I'm curious if you think about it in episode one or 24 years.
1619.68s: 24 months. Okay. So two years. Sorry. You said years. Oh, well, that it would be a more
1626.72s: difficult. I was going to answer that with, let's see, I'm 72. That would make me 96.
1632.16s: Don't care anymore. Don't care. Bring it on. Whatever it is.
1637.04s: Yeah. Next 48 months, chance of a recession. I think if the most recent move by the Fed ends up
1647.52s: firing up inflation again, which I think it has a possibility of doing.
1652.32s: And if then the short term moves that Trump's making are very short term inflationary, then the
1659.84s: Fed tries to respond by overdoing it again and being too late and not getting ahead of the problem,
1667.36s: which they seem to do a lot of lately. You end up with then maybe a contraction. And yeah,
1674.40s: maybe it could slip. I think with what he's proposing, I think it's that's going to fight
1680.56s: the tendency for a recession. So I think it might be a slower growth economy for a little while,
1686.56s: but I'm not sure. I think the possibility of a recession is too awfully high at this point.
1693.92s: Yeah. And that's an interesting point, specifically talking about the balance between some of the
1700.24s: policies and kind of the current trajectory that we're on. When you're thinking about stuff like
1707.84s: Apple production of things, right? Obviously, they really favor offshore production. And I have to
1715.76s: imagine that they've done tons of enough on where they would prefer to produce and stuff like that.
1722.40s: Do you think moving from 21 to 20% corporate and then 15% if it's domestic? Do you think that's
1729.20s: enough to move the needle for somebody like Apple? Or do you still think that it would be too cheap
1733.28s: comparatively? Because I mean, they're literally just putting up nets to catch people from
1738.08s: it won't be just the 15%. It'll be also the potential for tariffs on goods kind of China.
1746.08s: It'll also be the board of directors of Apple getting around the table and saying, you know,
1754.08s: China's not exactly a comfortable place legally. I mean, they could come in and shut us down overnight.
1761.92s: United States is going to let us be and do our thing. And, you know, we're respected company in
1767.60s: United States. They're going to protect our interests if we're here for strategic purposes since we
1775.68s: sell a lot of stuff here. Maybe we should go ahead and bite the bullet and there's makes a lot of
1781.84s: sense to put a plant here as a strategic backup in case China decides to shut Apple down for some
1790.08s: reason overnight. Then Apple's got alternate facilities that are a little bit more secure. So
1796.88s: it's a supply chain logistics. Lots of different decisions would go into that. But yeah,
1806.64s: taxes would definitely be one of them. In your perspective, what has led them to not make that
1813.68s: decision already then if it's based on the potential risk of like the Chinese government like
1818.24s: shutting them down? Do you think that they just needed one a couple more pieces to push them over?
1822.80s: No, it's 21% now and the current administration was going to let the tax breaks expire, which means
1830.88s: that the tax rate was on its way up. I see. There probably at least would wait until the election
1836.96s: cleared the landscape and then they can make a more logical decision at least for the next four
1842.00s: years. And yeah, if I were them, I would wait until I saw the results of the election because the
1849.04s: way it was going was not going to be very favorable to the United States. I think it would have really
1853.76s: increased dramatically the chance of a recession or worse in the next two years.
1858.96s: Interesting. And so from a broader trading perspective, obviously you're trading
1863.92s: like the yield curve and stuff like that. Do you have a perspective on real estate in general?
1870.64s: Yeah, my wife's more of the real estate expert. You should be asking her that question.
1874.40s: Perfect. I'm just saying. She just got some work done on one of her eyes. She's got a little bit of
1882.80s: a problem with one of her eyes. So we just came from the eye doctor and just barely out for the
1886.96s: center of you. So she's in the other room with her foot up. But she would say, I think, and I have
1894.40s: to agree with her that real estate's been pretty good for a long time and with higher interest rates.
1899.68s: It's frozen everybody sort of where they are. They don't want to sell what they've got because
1904.88s: if they went to someplace else, their mortgage rate would go up a great deal. Well, with what
1911.12s: seems to be happening. And if we look at pictures of the bond market, for instance, has been
1921.04s: going sideways on my graph here for about a month or so, which is just before the election just after
1929.28s: the election, not a huge amount of movement up or down. And if that starts to rally at all and
1936.48s: drop those interest rates. And if the economy starts getting more optimistic, you're already seeing
1941.68s: businesses getting optimistic. You're seeing more announcements of people wanting to bring
1947.92s: factories and business back in the United States. Deals are going to happen with more frequency now
1953.84s: because you're going to get a rid of that anti-monopoly bureaucracy in Washington that seem to be
1961.28s: against any deals, large deals for sure. And so when that stuff starts happening and you free up
1970.08s: the capital markets and the flow of deals and the building of factories and the jobs coming in,
1978.24s: you end up with more of an optimism. More people are going to take chances with buying a new house.
1984.80s: Getting that house that they wanted out in the country or in the suburbs or that downtown condo so
1990.80s: they could be near all the action, but it was out of their reach back in the days. They had to rent.
1995.84s: And now they can actually think about that million dollar condo because they can afford it.
2001.92s: So I think that you'll see real estate perk up. Now over the short run,
2007.52s: until we get the economy doing all those things, maybe the next six months or something,
2011.84s: you could see some softness maybe because if somebody really needs to sell something,
2018.64s: like you guys out in California for instance, I think you're in California, aren't you?
2022.32s: You're out San Diego. It's hard to remember with all the people interviewing me where they're
2028.16s: from, but I seem to remember you being a San Diego boy. And when you get a lot of people trying to
2035.52s: get out of a place like California, that's obviously less demand and you have a fixed supply.
2043.60s: So that's not necessarily positive for prices. On places like, say Texas, Florida, even Arizona,
2052.72s: Scottsdale is not showing a whole lot of sign of downturn because we keep having you.
2058.00s: California types coming over here and buying up our real estate after selling your mansion in California.
2065.04s: So they can buy a modest house here and bank a whole bunch of money.
2069.04s: That's right. That's the playbook.
2071.28s: Yeah, it's a pretty easy decision financially now.
2075.60s: Yeah.
2076.40s: Off you're into the ocean and surfing and the outdoors and you don't like the heat of the desert
2083.60s: in the summer, like cactus or other reasons. There's lots of reasons to dislike
2090.64s: depending on your own preferences, but I love it here. I love the dry air. I love the heat.
2096.24s: I'm an old guy. My sore aching muscles feel better when they're hot rather than when they're cold.
2103.44s: And I breathe better in the dry. I have less allergy so I can sing.
2109.04s: So yeah, it's all good here. This is my favorite place on earth, but
2114.48s: it's not for everybody, but we're getting a study supply of new people coming in all the time.
2120.88s: Yeah, it's funny actually. My wife and I were planning a trip
2124.88s: this month out to Denver because we're looking at we're looking at doing the playbook.
2129.68s: You got to execute the game plan.
2132.40s: Because I mean, I'm not from California originally anyway. I was stationed here for a few years,
2136.80s: hung out for a bit, liked it.
2139.20s: But yeah, the overall approach that you're explaining is exactly what a lot of us
2144.72s: seem to do rightfully so.
2147.28s: But I don't know who's going to be the last one that leaves and turns the light out.
2153.04s: At some point, it's got a fact.
2156.64s: Development of subdivisions, it's got to affect the development of roads, refurbishing of roads.
2164.40s: I noticed many times on Mount and California these days if I drive out there
2169.92s: that my car is hitting more potholes and cracks in the highways and just seems like it's not quite as
2178.08s: smooth as it was back in the 80s, let's say, when California was a bit more in its heyday.
2185.60s: I've noticed the over the decades slight deterioration in some of the infrastructure.
2193.60s: And so I don't know. We'll see how it all sorts out. But there's lots of it's a big country out there
2199.52s: and there's lots of beautiful country. I've traveled a lot of it. And I choose to make this my home
2205.28s: and make sense for a lot of different reasons for Brunnan myself. But even, I mean, I have a nephew
2214.72s: that is now moving just north of DC. He's an expert in aerial reconnaissance. So he's going to be
2222.56s: working for the government. He gets a 40% increase in the salary. He's one of these guys that
2229.20s: looks at the aerial photographs and says, that's a terrorist right there going into that house.
2235.84s: We should arm, you know, we should get a drone up there and take that place out.
2241.04s: And so that's kind of what he does. He ruins his eyes all day long looking at aerial reconnaissance
2248.08s: photos. But hey, if you're good at it, I guess it's a useful skill.
2254.88s: Definitely. And it actually leads to a follow on because one of the most interesting things that
2261.20s: we've learned so far from a military perspective is the engagement that we're seeing in
2267.20s: Israel and Maz a little bit less so that's a little bit more traditional. Still some elements
2271.20s: that we're learning from definitely Ukraine and Russia. We have learned so much about what we would
2277.52s: call TTPs, tactics, techniques and procedures to understand approach. And this entire new scale
2285.52s: and methodology of warfare is fascinating. It's the easiest way to describe it. And I say
2291.68s: fascinating because there's elements of it that's freaking terrifying because you can have these
2296.64s: small drones that cost a few hundred dollars that can literally, literally not necessarily
2303.36s: wipe out, so to speak, but definitely incapacitate a squad, which now for the Marine Corps 13, 13 people.
2311.36s: That doesn't seem obviously to be slowing down. When you see, again, taking it back to the
2318.08s: election since it's so fresh, one of Trump's imperatives is he's talking about trying to end the
2324.08s: conflict in Ukraine and Russia. Any thoughts on what that might look like?
2328.48s: Yeah, I think Trump's the art of the deal guy. He's going to go to both parties and he's going to
2335.20s: get there masts and wants. And if there's anything whatsoever that the masts can be
2345.04s: distinctly met, and then it's down to the wants, you give and take and you use some money flows.
2351.76s: And who knows, the United States may buy somebody off and say, okay, we'll give you this much
2357.04s: to repair that and you stay over here and everybody's happy from here on in. He'll work the deal
2363.68s: and he'll figure it out and then get both of them to agree and all of a sudden the war stops.
2369.20s: And if you were to, more than one more deal, he's done a lot of them.
2374.16s: And if you were to speculate the probability of some sort of deal being arranged,
2379.60s: is that kind of what you're thinking is likely to occur? Do you think it's going to be an attempt
2383.52s: and then it might get dragged out or anything like that?
2386.00s: No, because I think both parties over there, Ukraine and Russia both want to quit wasting
2393.68s: hundreds of thousands of people and lots of money getting blown up in bombs and missiles and drones.
2400.32s: It's a hassle on both sides. There's no really nobody's winning. It's the whole thing is ridiculous.
2410.00s: And so when Trump sets down and gets to each other, he'll figure it out. There'll be a deal made.
2418.16s: Yeah, I'm obviously with my background. I'm really, really interested to see how that reconciles.
2425.52s: Because right now, if anything was drawn based off of the current lines, Russia would gain some
2432.24s: territory, which would be very interesting to frame it lightly. But then when I look at the
2442.72s: overall scale of things, it does make me really interested to understand if what kind of deal
2450.24s: could be made that would maintain Ukraine's borders. And that's the one that I'm curious if
2456.80s: it's even possible. Yeah, sort of, I think Trump or any president really should be
2467.28s: a little hesitant to come in, especially a new president, which Trump would be here.
2476.80s: Yeah, he's got to be cognizant of what has been. But really, he's thrust into a situation of
2483.28s: this is the way it is today. All of how we got here is somewhat interesting, but in reality,
2491.20s: here's where we are today, just like trading in the now. This is where we are.
2497.28s: Now that we're here, what do we do to get the deal done and get this done with?
2505.28s: Both sides are going to bring up, well, yeah, but they did this and there's a bunch of
2509.04s: little kids squabbling with each other. Yeah, but they did that and yeah, they did this and blah,
2514.64s: blah, blah, and argue with each other. But in reality, he just needs to keep focusing back on,
2519.76s: okay, here's where we are today. And here's what you need and here's what you need and here's
2526.72s: what you want and what you want. And let's see if we can't figure out how to give as many of the
2532.72s: wants and needs on both sides. And where are we missing then when we get all of that figured out,
2540.56s: then what do we need to balance the deal and get the deal done?
2545.44s: Interesting. Yeah, I'm really curious to see if if and what that will look like because yeah,
2552.48s: there's a lot of different shapes and forms. And I think that the output of it will be pretty
2556.08s: impactful. Do you think that there's any sort of broader market impact from that conversation?
2563.12s: So let's say that they discuss a deal of struck. Do you think that the market would have some sort
2569.04s: of reaction either way? I doubt it because if they start talking, I think the markets will assume
2576.40s: that it probably is going to happen sooner or later because I think both parties want it.
2581.68s: And I think frankly, most of Europe wants it. I know the United States wants it. The people at
2586.16s: least there seems to be some people in our government right now that seem to want to keep it going.
2592.72s: I know the US getting rid of sending hundreds of billions over there is probably going to be more
2597.92s: money to help balance the budget. So that would be a useful function and trying to make government
2604.32s: more efficient here so that I think definitely the American people should be happy about it.
2611.92s: I don't see a downside. Yeah. Another question. The only downside would be to people who are in favor
2621.60s: of blowing up missiles and drones and stuff like that so they can produce more of them, the military
2628.48s: industrial complex. And then the other people that would be happy about it keeping it going would be
2634.16s: those that are involved in who knows what money goes over to Ukraine, it gets distributed around
2643.60s: to who knows where the Pentagon's lost track of where it's going, who knows who's pockets that
2652.56s: ends up in. So yeah, well, I mean, there's also the unfortunate reality that other than the cost
2658.48s: as a country, like we do bet the United States does benefit if Russia is in conflict because it
2665.20s: gives us a ton to look at from again, a strategic perspective. I'm not advocating for it to be clear.
2672.00s: I think it sucks. But from a from a pure agnostic point of view of their wasting money,
2676.88s: lives, resources, material, fighting this war that's really not going anywhere. That's no
2681.92s: love lost from us from like a defensive strategic position. Yeah. But in the end, if we were
2688.64s: strong ourselves and not sending munitions over there out of our own stockpiles, we would be stronger.
2696.32s: We'd get to a point maybe where it's interesting to know what everybody else has got, but we got
2702.88s: better than they do anyway. So you kind of, you know, you're not too awfully going to
2709.84s: neglect a loose sleep over it, I guess. It's interesting to see that stuff. I understand
2714.64s: strategically you're getting some information, but oh, definitely. I mean, we're probably with
2719.92s: aerial reconnaissance and lots of other, you know, CIA intelligence and who knows what we probably
2726.64s: in a few defectors here and there. You probably have a sense of what's going on in Russia or China.
2733.20s: And you got to worry about what you are capable of doing yourself, probably more than what they're
2742.88s: doing. You want to make sure that you're the best you can be. Oh, sure. And I think our
2749.20s: military is supremely competent. I actually think another thing that we are benefiting from again,
2755.04s: in an unfortunate way, but we have a chance we're testing all kinds of new munitions and technologies
2761.44s: that have had no real actual battlefield application, which again, it's, there's benefit to it,
2769.20s: but it comes at a pretty egregious cost. Right. Another question that I had, I came across this
2775.52s: the other night. I was like really curious about it. I didn't know what to think of it, but I saw
2779.76s: Trump was talking about getting rid of the Department of Education. And I did a bunch of homework on
2785.76s: that just because obviously, you know, there's people that are like, oh, well, you know, he just wants
2790.56s: to make everybody dumb. And it's like, no, he doesn't. Nobody nobody wants even regardless of what
2795.60s: side you're on, quote, unquote, nobody wants our kids to be dumb. So it's like I started doing a bunch
2801.44s: of homework though. I'm like, what they do. And it was really fascinating because I learned a lot
2807.52s: about like their overall process, the allocation of funds, one of the things that I don't know if you
2812.88s: know the answer to this, but I because I couldn't find it right now. A lot of the government,
2818.40s: the federal funds that go to public schools, it's like eight to 12% of total public school
2824.64s: funding that comes from the federal government right now. It's routed through something like the DOE.
2831.04s: My the thing I was trying to figure out is my assumption would be if DOE goes away,
2836.96s: those funds wouldn't necessarily go away. They would be like redistributed in another manner,
2842.24s: but I had no reference for that. I don't know if you know anything about that by chance.
2845.76s: I happened to do. I have a perfect I have a dodroom lot turns out that used to be a teacher in
2854.00s: South School Districts. And thanks to an advanced degree became a specialist in reading and ended up
2862.80s: having to attend a lot of meetings. And what she noticed over time is as she got more educated and
2871.04s: more kind of in more of an administrative type helping other teachers with specializing in reading
2878.24s: and all that. She noticed the meetings were unbelievable. The donuts, the bureaucrats, it just
2886.48s: kept growing and growing and growing. And she realized that she spent a lot more time talking about
2893.52s: a lot of things than doing anything that directly helps a kid learn how to read. And
2901.76s: and I think she leans more liberal than conservative. I doubt if she voted for Trump. And yet she
2911.76s: she made the statement that if you took the money from the Department of Education and just took
2919.04s: all the money that's wasted on all those bureaucrats there that then decide how we're going to
2924.80s: split the pie up amongst all these school districts across the whole country. And you just said,
2930.48s: okay, California gets X billions and New York gets X billions and their individual state
2937.12s: Department of Education gets to decide how to deal with that. They are more cognizant of their needs
2944.08s: than are the federal government. So you just you just directly sort of short circuit this
2950.64s: flow through the bureaucracy. And I think you get a lot more bang for your buck. And I'll come back to
2956.72s: the the most obvious thing of all Carter put the Department of Education in place yet now has
2964.40s: something like is it $180 billion a year budget. Yeah, it's big. And our scores and our capabilities
2972.80s: of our kids are lower than they've ever been. So it's not working. Try something different. You
2981.12s: got nothing to lose. That'd be my argument. It clearly it's it's not helping. Yeah, yeah. And
2989.36s: it's interesting because I think the idea and this is one of the things I was arriving at last
2994.96s: night as I was learning more about the the Department is that it also seems like just a larger gross
3002.72s: number of dollars obviously would be able to be sent out so that not not only would the individual
3009.44s: states be able to have a greater impact because they know what they need but they would actually
3012.88s: have more money to do with it which is kind of interesting because the Department of Education
3017.28s: would not siphon off money for all those bureaucrats and all their little you know the the building
3024.32s: and then we could take that building and lease it or use it to make a mother more valuable purpose
3031.04s: turn it into housing of some sort for Washington DC homeless whatever I mean you got to come
3037.68s: up with some more positive use for the real estate and the people they're not
3045.28s: increasing the economy they are not they are being a drag on the whole system and they're not
3053.52s: producing the results in the end and I'm a big fan of in general I'm in all types of businesses
3060.08s: really um military hard to do that police and fire hard to do that but other than you know the kind
3069.12s: of the original scope of limited government you know protecting your rights and protecting the
3075.12s: boundaries of the United States the minimalist approach to the federal government just about
3080.56s: everything else out there if you open it up to competition and good ideas I mean
3087.52s: X now is the leading platform in the world being downloaded for news and all that but five
3093.52s: years from now some other platform could come along and become the new X and everybody goes there
3099.52s: and it's got XYZ and Elon has been so busy doing the douche thing that he's you know taken his eye
3107.28s: off the ball and X is no longer the the darling and somebody else takes the place of the number one
3114.00s: app for news there's always that ability and the education is no different if you've got
3119.92s: uh I mean homeschooling back 30 years ago when I was back in the middle of trendstab days my head
3128.80s: trader actually homeschooled his his kids and it was the kind of difficult because you know mom and
3135.84s: dad had to sit there and actually deal with math class and geography and stuff like that but nowadays
3143.76s: there's all sorts of organizations textbooks online classwork um uh leagues for athletics and
3153.28s: the the homeschooler in today's world has got a completely different uh set of resources and support
3159.92s: groups to make it easier to do that and a lot of people there's a record number of people
3165.12s: homeschooling their kids now because they look at what's happening over the public schools and the
3169.52s: scorers keep getting lower and lower and the kids keep keep dropping out and and getting involved in
3175.68s: violence and drugs and everything else they just say hey this is a pretty easy decision I can do it
3181.20s: this way or I can do it that way and this way seems better now it trumps for posing uh school choice
3188.80s: that makes a lot of sense to me if money is going into the government and is going back out
3194.48s: if I can choose where to spend it I'm going to make the decision that seems the best for my kids
3201.20s: or for my family uh I'm not going to put up with the government deciding what's best for my kids
3209.60s: so it makes a lot of sense it's more freedom loving you get bureaucrats out of the way maybe
3217.04s: you know if the public schools don't tow the line and get their act together maybe they go
3222.96s: out of business you know nobody wants to put their kids in there anymore so they disappear
3230.24s: the teachers that want to teach go work in homeschooling or they go work in charter schools or
3236.48s: other places where they can focus on teaching well I'll tell you one thing if I had a homeschool my kids
3246.00s: they're in trouble as soon as we get to do improves on triangles because I don't remember any of that
3251.28s: I was just joking about that I remember I did teacher I think it was like seventh grade that was
3255.12s: a real hardass about writing in a triangle as part of my proof that was a big deal right in a triangle
3261.04s: other than writing in a triangle I don't remember it so yeah we're in trouble there
3267.04s: we're both going to be homeschooling we're going to be homeschooled at the same time together
3270.96s: yeah but that's a guy like me they got a hundred on his geometry regents to us in New York state
3276.80s: that might have kids and you'd send your kids over to me and I teach geometry and I'd send
3284.16s: my kids over to you for PE or perfect a class and health there's something like that you know and
3291.36s: you might have to have the responsibility of teaching that course that's good what bunches
3296.80s: swole martial artists so yeah I'm down for that and nothing wrong with that you know I think
3303.44s: I think it's it's very useful for a child in today's world and one of the things I notice with
3308.08s: my grandchildren now I have two granddaughters and fortunately my the kids expose the grandkids
3317.44s: to as many possible different things as they can it it must drive their schedule nuts because
3324.72s: they're carting kids every which way but you know here's a ballet class do you like that no okay how
3332.80s: let's take a class and skiing how's that oh that's fun but I don't you know I just I like doing it
3339.44s: I don't want to compete in it or anything how about swimming oh I think it's cool I like swimming
3344.48s: and and I like the I have some girlfriends over and swimming and and I won my last race and that
3351.44s: was kind of cool and I enjoy the going through the water real fast or something you know
3358.08s: you never know with kids you just kind of throw it out there and they decide oh you know I really
3364.00s: like writing poems or I like coding on the computer or whatever I think math is cool I really like math
3372.40s: you never know you just have to keep exposing them and then all of a sudden this profile comes out
3378.56s: in your maze and you think wow I didn't see that come and I thought when you were six you were
3383.52s: going to be a fashion designer and now you're talking about mathematics being one of your favorite
3389.44s: subjects wow yeah yeah so it's watching them develop but a lot of that is just being exposed to a lot
3398.40s: of different things and the world of today you know thanks to the internet and all that you can get
3403.84s: exposed to a lot of different things so you have to be open to allowing people to reach their own
3411.04s: potential and I think that we have a more of ability in the United States to allow our people
3417.52s: individually if we keep holding on to freedom and encouraging freedom I think over a long run
3426.96s: it's going to be the golden ages Trump often talks about I believe that you're going to have more
3431.60s: freedom more economy more capability to get things done capitalistic wise and I think that's
3439.20s: going to be good for everybody no matter what party you voted for last question and it actually
3446.88s: dovetails off of a lot of what you were talking about the ability to leverage technology to gain
3452.24s: exposure to different things artificial intelligence is so cool to me I think that just the potential
3458.96s: for it is incredible where do you think that that goes as an industry over the next again maybe
3466.80s: few years something like that whatever time frame you want but I'm just thinking like I view
3471.52s: something like AI in some different time frame buckets right we have like early AI as we're going
3476.08s: through now then there would be kind of like mid-advanced and then obviously very very advanced
3480.48s: so for kind of the early AI what are some of the capabilities and just impact that you see for that?
3486.08s: Well at the stage we're at right now I like to refer to it as a fancy Google search back in the
3494.16s: 20-30 years ago you put in one word in a Google search and you got some citations back
3500.48s: that were part of the database where the the bots had gone through for Google and looked at a lot
3506.64s: of different web pages and decided that through keywords or tags or words used in titles of articles
3515.44s: that here's a couple pages of your search results based on that one word you just put in there
3522.24s: and then there was rules that you could put two words and you could separate them by commas or
3526.56s: with a plus or whatever you want it you know there was also it's a search capabilities well now
3532.80s: with AI it's more like you Alexa you know set the timer for 40 minutes and Alexa knows can interpret
3543.12s: your words understand the sentence know that you're talking about a timer so you're timing something
3549.60s: set it for 40 minutes and then beep at you when it's you know time to do whatever it was that you
3556.96s: wanted to do even more so now you can say and I'm sure Elon's going to be doing this with Vivek on
3564.96s: the doge thing they're going to take a whole lot of financial records and they're going to have an
3572.00s: AI engine read those financial records and they're going to look at government statistics they're
3579.04s: going to look at head counts they're going to look at lease expense office space etc etc lots and
3586.40s: lots of information and they're going to ask the question of AI where's the low hanging fruit what
3594.00s: do we go after first department of education or department of energy department or the the
3601.52s: justice department or what you know what out of all of this what is money being spent on that has
3608.16s: the least economic benefit coming back so that's a pretty complex thing for a human brain to figure out
3615.92s: there's some low hanging fruit you could obviously get rid of the what's the effect of Coke on
3622.48s: quail you know quail ingesting cocaine yeah I don't think I need to know that with my taxpayer
3630.40s: dollars you know that would be some simple things you can do but that's not going to get you to
3635.76s: trillion you're going to have to go after a lot of deeply entrenched stuff that's just not being
3642.48s: effective and you're going to have to measure a lot of variables that almost gets behind the human
3647.60s: mind so they're going to be those types of issues as you get more and I call that a little bit
3653.60s: getting more into the intermediate level AI now ultimately you're going to ask AI to design AI
3663.76s: you know you're going to try to get to another whole level in meta here and that that gets to be
3670.56s: a science fiction novel and hopefully with a good ending not a bad ending but you I think that's
3677.92s: some of the concerns that people like Iwan has when you look at that level and AI is designing AI
3685.44s: how do you keep it within the rails so in other words how do you keep it friendly to humanity
3693.76s: as one of its prime directors as they to coin a term from Star Trek days the prime directive to always
3701.44s: you know to protect human life and as as the prime directive and I think that you know I guess
3711.20s: there's going to be nefarious people maybe China and who knows that we'll just ignore that and do
3716.80s: whatever they want and then there be other more ethical AI generations that come out with
3724.48s: limitations on what they do but no end in sight for what the AI could dream that it could do
3731.20s: by pulling all these different things together so I think I see a positive effect I see
3738.32s: that being make it a more efficient economy more efficient manufacturing more efficient I already
3744.72s: see lots of different aspects of technology in terms of even keeping track of at standpoint funds
3753.60s: which I'm the chairman of here in Scottsdale it's a mutual fund that trades 75 alternative markets
3760.72s: and a bunch of equity exposure as well all in the one mutual fund is done very well it's over a
3767.20s: billion and five-year track record very very nice however trying to keep track of all of the
3775.84s: various marketing channels and clients and all of this stuff requires some pretty interesting
3782.48s: software right it's way beyond anything that I ever had back in the day at Trendset trying to
3790.56s: market my measly little six hundred million dollar money management firm back in the day 20 years ago
3798.32s: so you know the world marches on there's lots of new technologies and capabilities back when I
3804.56s: started there was no ability there was no internet basically I didn't have the worldwide web I couldn't
3809.92s: talk to a Tom Baso as a mentor of some sort or have an interview with with some of the big
3816.80s: money managers back in those days I maybe read a Wall Street Journal article bottom or I could
3823.12s: speculate or read a book on them or something like that but I can get the talk to them so you had to
3829.60s: dream up your own ways of creating what it is that you're going to trade and how you're going to
3834.40s: protect your position sizing and you just had to use your own math skills and capabilities to figure
3840.16s: it out on your own and fortunately I waited through all that over the last 50 years but nowadays
3849.84s: geez there's so much read there's so many resources it's almost confusing it's almost the opposite
3855.52s: you have so many people who do you believe who do you want to talk to who who do you which book do
3861.20s: you want to read there's too many of them you know it's yeah it's that's the craziest part too
3868.40s: because when I started trading in 07 obviously trading it come a long way by that point clearly
3874.24s: but like it still wasn't what it is now and it's the the problem set is fascinating because when I
3881.60s: when I first started there was a handful of like books on options and derivatives there's not a bunch
3886.16s: and now it's unlimited so it's very much information overload it seems but you touched on
3892.16s: a lot of really cool parts about AI and actually some of the elements that I'm so excited
3897.44s: or is like how multivariate it can become in how many different levels of industry business
3904.24s: economy that it can impact which would be really cool to really cool to check out so I appreciate
3909.12s: your thoughts on it. Eric I would caution traders which you know probably traders are going to
3915.28s: be more watching this than any other group in the country out there and I would caution traders
3922.00s: though from an AI standpoint I would almost call that over optimizing history because AI is
3930.24s: naturally going to go off of data data is going to have to be historical data price moves that
3937.52s: happen economic data that comes in whatever pieces of data the AI can come up with the AI
3945.04s: cannot come up with necessarily opinions what they'll do is they'll correlate all this stuff
3951.76s: based on what's happened in the past and they will over optimize the heck out of it and say you
3957.60s: should be going long now because of the following reasons and by the same token if you take a
3964.56s: simulation platform and I've done this I'm absolutely positive that this is the case and you
3970.72s: over optimize you run it like a thousand cases and you vary the parameter from point one to point
3978.32s: point one to 1.0 by 0.01s or something and then you have another variable and you change those and
3988.24s: you increment those and you'd run every possible one of the 1000 cases and then you say you know case
3995.20s: number 537 made the most money in history so that's the way I'm going to trade the market the market
4002.64s: will never do that again ever in your lifetime and I did all this great work what the heck happened
4012.80s: and I worry that AI will tend to give you similar types of answers so be careful on how you use it
4020.16s: it's a it's a tool I think if you're trying to look for trade-offs and scenario analysis
4028.88s: and what some of the possibilities would be maybe you could use it for that you certainly can use it
4034.96s: to do screenings of vast quantities of information and you know say something like give me the
4041.52s: the 10 worst one-year periods for the S&P 500 over the last 100 years well then it can go back
4049.44s: and find that and return it if you ask it to then say well given where we are right now
4056.64s: should I be buying or selling that's another whole problem that's a different I think you get
4063.04s: you're gonna end up as a trader having to make that decision yourself and it adds a new paradigm
4070.16s: too because a lot of edge historically used to come from information scarcity and the people
4075.60s: that would pay to acquire the information and then create things and now I actually think that
4080.48s: there's going to be a pretty profound impact yeah exactly it's almost go the other way people will
4085.44s: be so drowned in information and so over optimized on history that they'll lose sight of the
4092.08s: forest for the trees and end up in the middle of all this noise trying to make sense of it all
4099.76s: and I'll be sitting here with my long-term 21-day indicators in boring fashion doing my work like in
4106.88s: 40 minutes every afternoon and just kind of yawning at all this nonsense that goes on that I
4114.64s: just ignore and it's like the world has passed me by in a way but in a good way I have just stuck to
4123.20s: what I do and I'm sort of outside all the nonsense that goes on and uh keep my life pretty easy
4132.08s: well I think that's also one of the beauties of building the the opposite of an overfit right in
4137.52s: a robust approach that allows us to to generally process so yeah yeah I love that
4145.44s: every move of cocoa for instance we started the station about my number one position
4150.96s: profitability wise today coffee is number two I guess no uh corn is number two to the downside
4157.92s: coffees number three um but you know the all of those have broken out of sideways periods
4169.28s: and are now on a big trend I'll catch every one of them with what I'm doing right my indicators will
4175.20s: always pick those up because I'm a trend follower so it's sooner or later whether it's a
4180.64s: shorter indicator of go over quicker long-term want to go over a little later eventually if it's a
4186.80s: big move they're all going to go over in the direction that I want them to go over and I'm going to
4190.80s: make money on that big run and I just do one of those every quarter or half a year and it probably
4198.00s: pays my way because I make so much off of that that you know all the rest of the stuff just adds up
4204.56s: to nothing or chunk change it really doesn't make that much difference it's a lot of work to get
4209.04s: nowhere but you got to be on on those big runners that's the key right yeah Tom always awesome
4217.20s: catching up get a chance to learn a lot and understand thanks for walking through a lot of your
4221.20s: perspective just on where the market is today because we're in a weird time and I think that yeah
4227.84s: I think the next uh 12 to 18 months are going to be interesting to watch so people can get a
4234.08s: hold of you enjoy the ride dot world I'll include that link in the notes below but anywhere else
4240.16s: that you want to send people that's the website most of the people that follow me out of all the
4245.12s: social media seem to be on x x it's at bosso b a s s o underscore tom got it well if it's anything
4255.52s: other than that you've got an imposter and I get one a week so be careful out there uh yeah and
4261.84s: I'll grab the correct link and I'll throw that in the notes as well for everybody so that they
4265.76s: are directed to the Facebook and LinkedIn and truth social and I forget where I have a what do you
4276.88s: call a sub stack articles that I write every now and again there's some interesting stuff there
4281.68s: if people are interested in reading some of my sub stack pieces mostly on trading or life
4289.20s: uh attitude psychology of trading that type of stuff so for a trader there might be some interesting
4296.00s: stuff in there for people but there's lots of ways you can get a hold of me beautiful well yeah
4301.68s: Tom thanks for thanks for sharing and thanks for hanging out as always I mean we'll definitely
4306.16s: connect again you know in a few months and see how things are going I always look forward to it
4311.04s: awesome take care everybody see Eric
