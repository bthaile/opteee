 Betawating explain I'm gonna walk you through exactly what this metric is and why you should care about it Because this is one of the few things in trading where one tool can provide a ton of great information and it's super simple to access So I'm gonna walk you through exactly what it is how it's calculated How you can use it and then some best practices at the end of the video So what's up everybody Eric here welcome back to all the outliers and a shout out to the patreon and family because you guys make content like this possible for everybody so if what I do helps you consider signing up it helps me a lot Let's talk about what Betawating is and I'm gonna get my face out of the way because I caught a little too much sun This past week and playing some sick pickleball and I'm burnt So not much to look at not that I'm typically much to look at but let's look at this We have a portfolio inside this portfolio. We have all different kinds of positions I'm not gonna run through them all but you can see that word short calls short straddles long calls all different kinds of things So if we think about this portfolio, how do we answer some simple questions like if the broad market using spy in this example Goes up 10 points what happens to our portfolio? How is that going to behave? You don't really know That's one of the things we can use beta-weighted delta sport the other thing is with all of these different positions on you probably know You know in aggregate how much money you have out at a given point in time But what's the no-sional value of the risk also don't know that but beta-weighting deltas will help you understand that So let's take a look now at what these raw deltas are and then we'll get into beta-weighting them What's a raw delta? It's just whatever you get from the options chain now to be very clear stock can also have and has Delta so if we take a look at this example down here where we're long 500 shares of AMC That's long 500 delta's but I kind of combine this one because it's a covered call and we have short two calls against it So that takes our delta's down a little bit that kind of thing But these are just raw deltas and why is this metric not good enough? Well because it's a little misleading in this case if we take a look at this long deep in the money calls in vix I didn't put any specific trade details, but I'm just pretending that these are plus 180 delta's these are approximates these aren't directly pulled from anything But they're pretty close to give you a good idea But in this case we have something that's long deltas however Vix is typically inversely correlated to the stock market So as you see in a second this metric actually looks quite a bit different when it's put into the language of beta waiting Delta's so let's do exactly that I'm gonna slide up out of your way So in the think or swim platform This is super easy to do if you don't use think or swim I have no idea if your platform has it a lot of them do this is nothing novel Most account managers use this tool because it's very simple But if you do use think or swim there's just this little thing under monitor activity and positions position statement There's a little box you could tick or beta waiting and then you just type in whatever you want to beta wait against It's one of the cool things about beta waiting actually is that you don't have to use spy you could beta wait against whatever the hell you want It just kind of makes the most sense to use spy typically for most people or spx or just some sort of broad market index So you can also use vix you can use of volatility product and what this is doing is taking all of these positions And it's putting them into a common language that language is how many shares Spy or whatever your beta waiting against does this position represent? So if we look at these two short calls and excel you they're negative 60 delta's by themselves But if you beta wait them to the spy they're only negative 20 So what is this negative 20 again? This means that this is going to behave like negative short 20 shares of spy and then so on down this list So if you take a look at that vix trade that I was kind of highlighting before and you see that's actually It plus 180 delta's but then when we beta waited to the spy it's actually negative 200 delta's so in this case again This means that this is pretending. This is essentially the same thing at this point in time as short 200 shares of spy Notice how I said at this point in time. It's a really important note because as the market moves as the value of Spy moves as these delta's move all of these things change so these are pretty regularly updating figures They're just static obviously in the snapshot So now I want to walk you through those other two things I was talking to you about the notional value and the P&L Now you'll notice how beta waited spy delta's we you know have the each individual position So you can beta way all of them, but then you can also summarize them you could do totals So right now our portfolio is behaving like 300 shares of spy So with that information You should already be able to calculate the answer to this question over here But if you can't don't worry the only piece you need for this is whatever spy currently is trading at and in this example I'm used $430 so you can with that detail you can answer essentially this you can answer this and you can answer this But if you're unfamiliar with it, let's talk about it So when we look at something like no shinole value all we're going to do is take the Beta-weighted delta's and then we're going to multiply that by the current price of spy So in this case like I said, I'm going to use spy at $430 and these are the notional values for each of these trades And then in the aggregate so again, you can either do the math for each individual position Which you know again your platform typically will do this for you So you can get a view of each individual position But then you can also look at the aggregate this is so useful Because one you get one stop shop for your overall portfolio metrics and to be clear once you beta-weight against the spy You can get beta-weighted delta's you can get beta-weighted all different kinds of metrics that help you understand the disposition of your portfolio What do I mean by that? You can also beta-weight things like your gamma now things like theta and vega don't matter If you beta-weight them, you're not going to see them change because it doesn't matter what they're ranked against They are what they are But those two things specifically and a bunch others you can beta-weight, but I want to focus on delta's here So as you can see we can see the overall value of each of these positions So one of the things we should be doing as we're seeing this is do any of these positions strike you as odd His eyes seem to be a little bit odd don't they? And again, this is all going to be completely predicated on your risk tolerance And the way you like to structure your portfolio But the first thing that I see is this is a giant position in northrop crumman This position down here by itself is $193,500 Whereas the rest is kind of 20,000 This one is essentially flat if you look at them side-by-side But if you look at them individually, they're $10,000 trades This one is also pretty big at 86,000, but this is double that So this is a big trade and I can tell you right out of the gate That's something that interests me This is how you use beta-weighted delta's to get one in understanding of your entire portfolio But then to individual positions within it So that's just one thing that jumps out to me Maybe you really like northrop crumman and you want that position Cool, that's really fine But if you look at this you're like oh shit This is actually way bigger than all of these other ones Because if you take for example these AMC versus northrop crumman positions They have essentially the same rock deltas The AMC cover calls 440 The northrop crumman calls are 400 But when you beta-weight them it's massive difference So that's the kind of thing we can use Now if you hadn't already Let's take a look at how we do the math here To figure out how our P&L moves based on movements in the S&P 500 So in this case Again you should be able to do this math before I show you these numbers So you can pause the video, run through, do the math real quick And then here are your answers So I just did it for the S&P 500 at $440 Again you can do the same exact thing with it at $430 But this is the same process What we're looking at is whatever the delta is in spy Meaning the change That can be a little confusing when you talk about delta in terms of change Versus delta in terms of representation of In options product But in this case I was referring to it as in change That's why I kind of purposely use change here So if we use the price change in spy So again going from 430 to 440 that's $10 So we're saying spy change by $10 Then we need to multiply our beta-weighted deltas By whatever that changes So in this case I'm taking 20 beta-weighted deltas And then I'm multiplying it by the change here Which is 10 That gives you your negative 200 And then you can do that all the way down Now again this is in a vacuum Because volatility is going to change The deltas on things are going to change So it's very rarely going to be this neat math Where you see spy move $10 And none of these other things change But this is just to give you an idea of how this broadly works Because round about this is what you would see Again, barring massive other changes in volatility or other products But the main tool that you can derive from this Notional value for the positions How those positions are correlated to the spy And then the notional size for the portfolio So overall this one tool gives you a ton of information So again to recap what you learned You now know that beta-weighting is a tool for helping us Normalizing positions into a common language So that we can see how everything fits together as a broad puzzle piece We can also understand our directional risk Because if you have really big either individual trade Sizing that's beta-weighted or the portfolio That's a shot across your bow And what I mean by that is if we come back to this example If you look at this beta-weighted delta's of $130,000 If you have a $50,000 account This means that you are in a pretty big size And by the way let me get out of your fucking way so you can see Thank fucking God I'm referencing this down here So if you see this $129,000 And that looks really big relative to your portfolio Let's say it's $50,000 That means that you're leveraged You have more risk than you have capital in the account Again that might be part of your game plan But that gives you a sense of your overall risk But then again you can also see if you have individual trades That are outsized compared to others So the other thing you can grab here is the overall size of positions But the correlation of them Because you can have things that by themselves If you look at the raw delta You might not actually fully understand how these things behave against one another So like for example These short calls in XLU compared to SPX short straddle This delta relationship from the raw delta's doesn't really tell us much But if you look at the beta-weighted delta's You're like, oh wait a minute These essentially gansely each other out Interesting So the overall risk in the portfolio is quite different than what the raw delta's would lead you to believe So this helps you get way way way more precise Understanding the risk in your portfolio Mapping out what changes you need to make So that you are more effectively employing And protecting your capital If you have any questions as always Drop them in the notes below in the comments
