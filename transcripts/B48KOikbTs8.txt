 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you of traders don't make money, why then make it complicated, trying to iron condor consistently hedge covered calls if it works through it works for you. But otherwise, no need to further complicate trading, just trying to possibly help others out. What the fuck does this mean? Once again, succeed in killing the account. I, okay, so I have no idea what I just put us through because I don't actually see what the strategy is and hear what maybe click of this, to be honest, is the fact this, it's been about 18 months and my strategy has been consistently winning with a high success rate. This was the issue that I had with this one. That's why I wanted to look at it. So I don't actually even see, it says the whole description is in the comments, so maybe there's actually a strategy in there or something. But anyways, this is wrong. Like, this is the wrong way to look at it. It's the same reason why this is wrong and we'll understand why. All right, so before we go any further, what I would love for you to do, whether you're watching the recording or you're on the stream now, is I would love for you to think about a trading strategy that you use. And I would like you to quickly evaluate that trading strategy to yourself. What I mean by this is think about the data points, think about the things that you would look at to see if this strategy is good or not. Okay. Once you have that for a couple of moments, I'm going to start walking you through what I would do. And I want you to compare what you came up with on your own against what we're about to go through together. I want you to see what's the same because there will be things that are the same. I'm pretty sure. And what's different. And I guarantee you there will be things that are different. So off we go. Now for those unfamiliar with the outlier strategy process, like I said, in the beginning, we're going to start here. This is just a framework for building a strategy. The reason why this matters is because when we get into the concept of reviewing a strategy, you'll see that there's actually a very important first step when we're trying to review a strategy, which we're going to talk about in a second. I actually realized I'm going to move this over here for just a moment. I want to make sure that everything on the next slide doesn't pop up all at once, which I think it's going to. It is. Give me one sec. I'm just dropping a couple covers right now. Main thing is I want you guys to have the progression because there's progression in what you're about to take a look at. Cool. This will work. All right. So let me slide this back over. I'm fixing two other things. Beautiful. All right. We Gucci. I don't know how long that was, but I felt like it wasn't too bad for you guys. And I think this will make it a better experience, which is what we're going for. All right. Joe says, buy and hold diversified funds has been my best strategy. Yeah. Well, especially somebody like you, Joe, to be honest, it makes a lot of sense. And it's because you have funny enough. I actually realized I need you just jog my mind for something. I need to add to this list for you. And it's just that people strategy hop a lot. It's very difficult. It's very difficult to create a trading strategy. It takes a lot of time in effort. And I have seen you enough by now that I know you're not doing it. So because of that, your propensity to kind of flow in between things that you think might work. And then bouncing out when it's not working, we refer to that as strategy hopping. And it's really nefarious. And you'll actually see there's something in here that talks directly about that. So yeah, buy and hold for most people realistically will work best. Now, if we take a look at the ally strategy process, you'll notice that there's four steps. And these first two steps as always are all about the profit mechanism. They're not about a strategy at all. And then we get into creating strategies between these two steps. Okay. So if we now move on to the concept of evaluating a trading strategy, you'll notice that the first thing, the very first thing that's here is idea. You can't evaluate a trading strategy unless you have some sort of idea on what it is you're trying to monetize the profit mechanism. And some idea on what it should look like. If you don't have this, then you can evaluate what you're doing. And again, most people, my guess, like this person, they don't have this. So they're just starting to click buttons. They're seeing an outcome yet unfortunately, they don't actually know what they're trying to do. So then they can't answer the question. They're trying to answer. And nobody really can answer it unless you understand what it is that you're trying to do. So I don't know if that point is too esoteric. Like if that's one of those things that as I say it, it kind of just goes over and it doesn't make sense. If so, please tell me the way to think about this, it's like if you play pool. I'm not good at pool, but I have fun. And when I'm playing pool, if I'm trying to shoot a ball, I'm thinking about what ball I'm trying to hit, where I'm trying to hit it, and where I think that ball is going to go. Now anybody that's played pool will know sometimes that idea that you think it might go like that, but then you shoot the ball, something bounces in a way that you didn't expect and all of a sudden, another of your ball, it goes in. But it's not the one that you meant to go in. So that's the case where somebody puts on a trade. They make money, they made money on a trade, but they didn't make money for the right reason. Just happen to make money because of path. The danger here is that if I were to try and become a professional pool player, and the premise of my skill set is sometimes when I shoot the ball, some shit goes in, but it's not really what I'm trying to do, I'm probably not going to go that far. It's the same thing in trading, but the difference is in trading, everybody is just equally happy when they make money. And this goes back to a broader concept about a lack of attention to the process, and everybody's focused on the outcome, which is a whole other conversation. So you have to start with a defined idea. We take the idea, we analyze it. So the idea in this context is a profit mechanism. So we should be able to take a look at whatever the profit mechanism is that we're trying to trade, and we should be able to analyze it. This process here mirrors what you see in the outlier strategy process. Like these are the four steps of the outlier strategy process in a slightly different context. Okay. So now is where we get to the point of evaluation. We have a profit mechanism, we analyze it, we build a strategy around that, and now we're testing the strategy. Now is when we get to analyze. The process of analysis is actually really, really simple. We're going to observe what happens with our strategy. Then we're going to iterate on the strategy. This is when we're bringing other elements back in, applying new filters, maybe testing different deltas, all that kind of stuff. We're iterating. We're trying to see what fits optimally. And then once you finish this process in a paper trading sense, then we can move to a live variation of this, and then an actual full scale trading, like utilization of this. So this here is the same as this here, which is the same as this here. It's just at different stages. In this stage, we're roughing out the idea. In this stage, we're testing it live with a small amount of money. And then in this stage here, we are actually implementing it and continuing to monitor and optimize. So now, none of this talks about the process of evaluating just yet. This is giving you the overall strategy process and the iterative components to it. So now, what we need to do is double click into these spots. This is where the actual evaluation occurs. This is when we're looking for those details that are going to give us some idea on whether or not this is something that we like or don't like, that we think fits our general approach or doesn't. So now, let's click into these stages where the actual evaluation occurs. Now, we already started talking about some traps. It's like Admiral Akbar. It's our trap. There's so many of them. It's not even funny. There's so many of them. It's not even funny. And this isn't even a drop in the bucket. Another one that we were just talking about before that would fit in here is strategy hopping. Another one would just be a whole litany of statistical traps. It's literally too many. Well, it's not too many. We could list them, but it would take this entire slide in terms of our analysis. Then we have things like cognitive biases. So if we go through these and think about them, I want you to go back to that exercise I gave you at the very beginning of this where I asked you to think about one of your strategies and just kind of loosely evaluate it in your head in terms of like what are the things that you would be looking at and evaluating with your strategy. And then I want to run through this together now and you'll see some things. First, regime impact. You tell me, is there a difference between 2020 and 2025 year to date? Obviously, there's differences. It's not going to be the exact same. But broadly, if you think about the broad market conditions, are there differences? Lauren says yes, Joseph says yes. So name one of the differences. What's one of the things that's very different between 2020 and 2025? H says I could throw a dart at letters on the wall and go long. That's actually a hilarious smart way to say it. That's completely true. Ricky says was that COVID? It was COVID. Rhee says interest rates. Here we go. Now we're getting it. So rate environment. We had things like stimulation from the Fed. Everybody relax. Everybody relax. I know I said the word stimulation. Everybody got a little perked up there. But I meant from the Fed. If Big Daddy Jay Powell stimulates you, we have a problem. 2025. What do we have? We have Trump as press. And again, politics aside, your political leanings, being whatever they are, doesn't matter. There are implications with Trump as president. It is a fact. H says higher rates, bingo, much higher rates. H says more uncertainty around how Trump will act bingo. So now we have things like tariffs. We have a new conflict. And so on and so forth. So the regime matters so much. What you see and what performs well in this will differ than this. This is using two years at an annual view. This concept of regime, we talked about this in the procession when we were talking about pattern recognition. One of the key things to take away from that session is a reminder and then also to introduce it for those that weren't in there is that when we're analyzing regimes, we can analyze regimes across a broad spectrum of levels. So we have things like an economic. We have things like the geopolitical. We have things like the stock market. And again, when I've refer to the stock market in this context, I'm talking about indices, behavior, commodities, vol, all that stuff. Then you click in another level. We have the individual stocks, sectors, so on. And then we finally start getting down to the portfolio level. All of these things have regimes. And the regimes aren't on an annual basis. When we think about regimes, you can have micro macro. There's regimes that come and go, that become relevant to very small points in time or very large points in time. So taking this all the way back to when we're evaluating a strategy, you have to be cognizant. Of what the regimes were in the thing that you're looking at. That's the backdrop. So to give you like an actual example of this, a practical example. Let me hide all that stuff. If I take a look at the last 10 years in SPX, and again, we know that 22 was a bear market. That was a down year. So if I'm evaluating a long call strategy in 22, what do I think I'll see? Long call in equity index, probably lose money. Like if we're just doing a, what I've referred to as a dumb strategy, just a road strategy where we're just mechanical. Then if I were to buy a 30 day call and then roll it out in time every two weeks, probably not going to do great, probably not. Yet, if I did that in 2020, I probably would have smashed it. It probably would have gone super well. Because on the downside, you have limited loss. You're not getting killed like all the long stock people are. And then you have unlimited upside potential. So the point here is if you don't pay attention to the regime when you're analyzing your strategy, you're making a massive mistake. Because a lot of us, we tend to oversimplify it in our brains. And then we miss a lot of important nuance. So if you did consider regime when I asked you in the exercise earlier to evaluate a strategy, just drop a Y in the chat. I'm curious how many people. And it's okay. My guess is most people probably wouldn't think of regime. My guess is most people wouldn't directly to the strategy. That's my guess. Yes. Yet, it's one of the most important things to start with. And this is why when you all hear me talk about things, you'll hear me talk about things in the context of a generally standardized process. Top down. Top regime. That's the top thing we have to set a backdrop. Cool. Next. Path. Who's familiar with path? This is path. This is path. Path is super confusing. Path can lead people into such a false sense of security that eventually causes them massive problems with their trading approach. And I'll show you exactly how this typically goes with respect path. Normally, somebody will build a strategy. That's random. Just off the dome, some stuff that they've seen over time. And then they start moving that strategy directly to production. Then what ends up happening is if we think about the stock market, we know that over different time frames, you'll get different looks typically. Yet, if we just plot a stock market that looks like somebody's having an aneurysm, not really. It's not jagged enough. Wait, I don't really know what this looks like. This one went backwards in time. Go ahead, try to trade a market that goes backwards in time. Check that out. Let's actually draw something that might be a little more reasonable. So, if somebody takes this strategy to production right here, and let's say that this strategy is what I was referring to before, because it's simple. We're going to buy 30 day calls and we're going to roll them every two weeks out in time. Just over and over again, start up 50 Delta, it doesn't matter. And let's say that this is a six month period. They might think holy shit. I have found the holy grail. I have made so much money over this time frame. I should take a mortgage out on the house. You don't already have one. Take a second mortgage. And I should put all of my money into this strategy. I started the strategy by risking, let's say one percent of the account. But over this time frame risking, just one percent of the account, if I had risked 10 percent of the account, holy shit, I could have quadrupled my account over this time frame minimum. This is what I'm going to do. This is path. Path will catch everyone, literally everyone. If you stay in the markets, path will catch you. This is why you see volatility-based hedge funds blow up. It doesn't happen super frequently, but when it starts to happen, it tends to happen quite a few at once. And they're the kind of things that people win over and over and over again. They have great returns over and over and over again. The overwhelming majority of instances, this thing is working beautifully. Yet they fall prey to path. So this is path. It's the fact that the market can show you something for an extended period of time. Now, let's say by comparison, instead of the long call strategy, let's say that this was supposed to be a short-strangle strategy. What would happen here? The short-strangle would not work. This would lose money. Does that mean that this strategy doesn't work? Oh, strategy could be completely fine. It could be completely fine. It means it doesn't work there. It means in a persistent uptrending market, typically marked by low volatility and all this other shit. It means it doesn't work well there. Does that mean that this doesn't work at all? Absolutely not. So this leads to one of the very many cognitive biases where people will, again, not understanding the context of what they're looking at, they'll throw something out. That might otherwise be pretty decent. Path confuses and loses most people, I think. And it's because path will always catch you. If you stay in the markets long enough, you are going to see what your actual skill is. The issue with path is that if I plot a time series again, path can carry your returns for a while. So this can be six years where the path of what you were doing happened to work. And then all of a sudden, what you're doing no longer works on year seven, and you lose everything. This is why people that have really consistent returns in markets over long durations are super fucking rare. It's because of path. Okay. Next, small sample. I think everybody knows what this one is. It's actually the same concept as path funny enough. But 18 months. Super small sample. 17 months. Super small sample. Literally means nothing. Super short term time frames literally means nothing means nothing. Antel, Antel, good or bad means nothing. The idea comes from general statistical practice. You'll hear of something called law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Good old CLT. So the Clifnodes version for both of these is if I plot my return zero line. And this is just my trade count. I plot five trades. Making money. This looks pretty good. I plot another five trades. Still looks pretty good to me. I plot another five trades. Starts to look a little more concerning. I continue this process over time. The longer you do this process, the more that line of best fit represents your actual strategy and your actual performance. If you do not have a lot of dots, which are individual trades, and I'm going to show you a way to calculate the number of trades you need in order to have a 90% confidence interval that what you're doing is actually showing you the performance of the thing. Most people don't know you can do that. It's really not that difficult. We're literally going to calculate so that I know while how many trades do I need to have before this thing actually starts to represent what the performance is. We can calculate it. So the idea of small sample is most people will say based on this grouping here. Oh, shit. This thing is good. This is great. The problem is it's probably not. And if you continue doing it long term, you're going to see what it really is. And you're probably not going to like it. That's just the reality. Next, Goldilocks analysis. Goldilocks analysis applies to all of these. I was working with somebody on a coaching call this week. And we were looking at a zero DTE strategy. And in the zero DTE strategy, they were using a back testing tool. And in that back testing tool, there was a couple toggles, conditional toggles. I don't even remember what they were. There were two conditional toggles, though. And the performance before those conditional toggles, when they're on, the performance was, I don't remember, but let's call it like 15% return something like that. Or maybe 11. And then once we turned these conditional toggles off, the performance dropped to like 4%. This is Goldilocks analysis. This shows me something that literally lacks all robustness. What this tells me is that the entire edge of the strategy was based on these conditional toggles, which were based on the back testing logic. That's a fucking problem. But when you want to see something so bad, your brain will make it so. Your brain will skip over these red flags. And be like, no, this is probably, this is probably pretty representative. I did it over a long-term timeframe. It looks good over the long run. Your brain will make that leap for you. I know this all too well because I've spent, I cannot tell you how many hundreds of hours testing strategies. And it's like the same thing when you're hunting for those that have been hunting before. I cannot tell you how many times I've seen a deer, beautiful deer, moving around pretty far just at the end of visual, pretty far, I could swear it's moving. And then I look at it long enough, get a little closer and it's a fucking stump. My brain wants to see a deer so bad that it's turning fucking stumps into deer that move. Fun fact, this stump didn't move. My brain made that bitch move. That's how bad I wanted to see it. That can screw you in trading. Your brain will try to make whatever you want to happen, happen, but you've got to, you've got to reel that in. The only thing that it ultimately manifests in is losing money. It's bad news bears. We don't want that. Goldilocks analysis really couples with everything on this list. The way to overcome Goldilocks analysis is actually really, really simple. You should look at things, the objective as objectively as you possibly can and you have to make it a habit. That's why you guys hear me talk about that so much and why I try to apply that lens so frequently because if you make it a habit, if you wire it as a part of the way you think, it becomes easier. The other thing is you have to be ready to do the hard things, like turn off these toggles and see what the performance is and then see this drop. Why wouldn't that person have turned off these toggles just to see? Because they don't want to see. They want to see this so then they make it so. And this is partly why we have to have a robust process when we're evaluating things. Strategy hopping we already talked about. Statistical traps, dog, there's a million of them. All of these are basic statistical paths. It goes super deep. One of the absolute most common statistical traps that I can see with option traders, bar none, anybody guess what it is? I'm going to open the door for Thor, but take a guess because my I'm thinking you probably know. Bingo. Joe's on it. That's exactly right. The overwhelming majority of option traders, they disgustingly, disgustingly exhibit a gross overemphasis on high win rate. Again, what are we what are we showing here? 16 at a 17 months. I have a video coming out on this post. I think the video will come out next Wednesday, but to give you a pre-read. Since 2024, 8.32 percent. Yeah, this one 18 months high success rate. Win rate right here, this is win rate. It's so common. And it's because you're taught to want to win. In trading, you have to completely reconfigure that. Winning is still part of it, but the way that winning looks can look very different. Then what most people falsely bubble it up to being just a high win rate. For example, I'm looking at one of my strategies now. So I have a long call option strategy. My loss rate is 53 percent. The current win rate for the strategy is 47 percent. So it means that I'm losing more than 50 percent of the time with that strategy. Arguably, not a high win rate, yet I'm trading the strategy. Why would I do that? Yes, that's right. Reese has it. Reese has exactly what it is. It's a timing based strategy. The way that it makes sense is that I take small losses frequently. But then when it makes money, it makes a lot of money. So even though the win rate is only 47 percent, it's severely profitable. This is one of the issues with overemphasis on high win rates. All right, let's talk about some of these metrics, Maui. Not exhaustive by any stretch. This is actually what I would consider to be an MVP minimal viable product. So what we need to track and break down. And again, this occurs here. It occurs here. And it occurs here. So what I'm going to do is break out the traits. So just a simple count number and then percent of wins losses. There's no draws. There's no draws in trading. There is no draw. It doesn't exist. Every single trade will have at least some sort of positive or negative P&L. Now there is the unicorn scenario where maybe your win is the exact size of your commissions and slippage included. I feel pretty confident saying the overwhelming majority of people won't find that circumstance. So what that means is you just need these two buckets. So let's talk about this. How do we use a win rate? If I'm looking at a strategy and I see, for example, that it has 10 wins and two losses. What can I conclude from this? And don't say it's too small of a sample. We don't know that. What can I conclude from this though? Any guesses? If you guessed not much, you're right. This metric alone. I can't guess shit. I have no idea. H says high win rate. Yep, definitely. That's about the only thing that I can walk away with is that there's 10 wins and two losses. That's all I know. This could be based on something, some sort of market effect that does not come up that frequently. This could be based on some sort of market effect that comes up once a year. This represents 12 years of data for that strategy, for that profit mechanism. Or this could be something that's traded on a zero DTE basis and is super early. The fact is we have to be able to contextualize this information. And by itself, we can't tell that much. Yet the funny thing is just as who was it? H. Just as H noted, this has a high win rate. What did we just say? Most retail traders focus on. H. I win rate. I can't tell anything from it. Now, just because I can't tell anything from it alone, doesn't mean that this is unusable. I need this information. This is the foundation for everything else that I'm going to show you. Everything else that we're going to test is based on that. So another thing that people do in their minds, and it's because people we like to argue, and it's not a bad thing, right? A lot of people like, I'm argumentative. I like to argue in the pursuit of information. But one of the downfalls of people that like to argue, but they're not thoughtful about it is they'll just take the other side. And if you just default to the other side, you're actually going to miss really important information. So when we look through this, you'll see that this by itself doesn't really show us that much. But if you just default to the other side of that, meaning you then say, well, then it's not useful data. It's a massive mistake. It's not true. There's nuance in this shit. It's super important. Just can't tell anything from it by itself. So first piece trade count. Here. No, I didn't say Siri. Chill. My phone just knows Siri. Go away. All right. Chill. Turn off. So the first thing that you'll notice here, we don't really need the rest of this stuff. This is a sample log that you can make for yourself. You can literally rip this. So notice how we have number of trades open closed total right out of the gate. And then what I do is I break them out. I start with the overalls. So this is the average total average, meaning for the entire grouping. Then I segment the wins here. I segment the losses here. I look at the extremes, the tails, max and min. And then I also calculate the expected return. You can do different permutations for average PNL from expected return. But in this case, I calculate this separately. So that's essentially how I'm breaking out the trade count, the PNL and the expectancy. And for those that need a refresh on why you care about expected return, here's a video for you on this metric. Okay. So now we get into this to the more nuanced stuff that a lot of people probably don't look at. So first thing I like to plot is total standard deviation and then downside deviation. So what this does is if I'm plotting standard deviation, standard deviation just tells me how a data set the overall severity about a mean. So I was just looking at variance. Yes. Downside standard deviation gives me downside severity. So it's not downside meaning when the stock goes down. It's downside meaning, are my losing positions? What's the deviation? And this gives me a sense of how consistent is this thing? Then you can calculate things like max drawdown. So that would just be the sequence of your returns that yielded the largest or the smallest. But the worst PNL. So you can write a formula that does that. I want to look through all of my PNL and I want to find the sequence of returns where the consecutive losing trades led to the largest total amount of losses. That would show you your max drawdown. Then we can calculate sharp and sortino. I prefer sortino because like standard deviation and downsides, downside standard deviation sharp is similar to standard deviation. It's looking at measuring risk adjusted returns of overall deviation. Sortino gives us that same thing. But again, for downside standard deviation. Then we can calculate something that I imagine most like most people don't calculate, which is coefficient variance. And again, if the stuff that I'm saying is like, you know, you're thinking yourself, what the hell is this? Just play it back and ask Chachi Pt to help you. None of this stuff is that crazy. I promise you. There are just words that you might not be used to hearing. Just as if you at your job were to start talking to me about your job in how the would be a lot of words that you would be saying that I wouldn't know. So don't feel like this is some crazy shit. It's not. It's super basic. If just don't let the words scare you off. Just remember them and then ask Chachi Pt to tell you about them. That's it. You just have to learn. That's all. So coefficient variance is really important. And it's because it gives us an understanding of how our return varies against an average, against a mean, whatever the line of best fit is. So a slightly different metric. Then looking at just standard deviations. Then we can calculate the number of required trades. The formula for required trades is easier than you think. So in this context, I'm not including a standard error margin, margin of error, which we typically would. So the way that that would look is here. We just go right here and then we would put something in here. So if we wanted to be within 15%, standard margin of error, whatever it is that we're calculating. You could throw that there, whatever. So the first metric you see here is 1.635. That represents a specific confidence interval. It's another statistical term. We have certain numbers that represent specific confidence intervals for the various formulas that we might use. Then we take AZ. Is it AZ? Oh, yeah, AZ here. Standard deviation. I was wondering when I made this, I made it backwards. Normally, I would start from here and then go here. Standard deviation. Now the way that I would also run this is first use the total standard deviation, but then use the downside standard deviation. Now, one of the things you're going to notice with your returns as a trader is that you are going to get huge coefficient variance, typically expressed as a percentage. So the issue here is that if you have really large standard deviations, which is what most people will have, it means that you're going to need a ton of trades. If you want to land at a 15% confidence interval or some or I'm sorry, using a 15% margin of error. So the issue here is that when we get our final result of required number of trades, often it will be a huge number. That does not mean that the metric itself is useless. It means as always, you need to apply some context to the metric. One of them is I actually use a moving average for mine. So I can see is my performance tightening the range or is my performance expanding the range of required trades. If it's tightening the range, I can become more and more confident that what I'm seeing is likely a closer representation of the performance of the strategy. If I see it expanding the range, then I know that's not the case. So you might get 80,000, something like that. That absolutely can be the case. So that doesn't mean that if you get that, you essentially say I can't use the strategy, seven, eight,000 instances to see if it works. You have to make some educated guesses, but then you can monitor the performance over time and see how the metric trends. All right, so I'm going to take a pause there because I noticed that as I started talking about the statistical stuff, we literally lost like half the people here, which is to be expected. But what questions you guys have on this so far, and then I'll talk to you about how to look at these that actually think about a strategy. But what questions do you have so far? For those that have run the gauntlet, if you're good, that's awesome. I'm going to ask ChatTBT about the last 20 minutes. Yeah, and that's cool. I imagine that will be the case for most people. You'll have to pause it and go back. Lauren says I have a lot of questions for ChatTBT. Good. Yeah, that's awesome. And that's what I would expect, right? A bunch of people will have heard something, a series of some things for the first time in a context that might not make any sense. But the cool part is, is like to create a super simple log like this. It's really just a function of working through what you're doing in order. That's all. So like I said, I wouldn't get overwhelmed with anything that's in here. Just break it down into bite-sized chunks. Jordan says that log is beyond me at this point. That's not true at all. It's not beyond you. Like I said, there's just going to be some words in here that are different than what you're used to seeing. Like that's literally it. It's just a function of some of the words. So I wouldn't feel any type of way about it. I would simply take a look at the terms that are confusing, that you're not super confident, you know, and like what they mean. And then I would just think about breaking them down into their smaller components. That's all. And you are 100% capable of literally everything in here. This is easy stuff. Just takes a little while. Ricky says we don't have master's degrees and stats. I don't either. I just have a bunch of stats focused, but it's not a natural degree and outright stats. That would be some straight nerd shit. Lauren says I got a new ligament in my elbow Friday. So I'm slow to the draw still. That's perfect. That also means that you probably got plenty of time to test and refine ideas, which is great. Age says thanks for the template. Yeah, perfect. That's exactly what you should do. You should use this as a starting point. Now there's a couple of ways that I would make this a little bit better by including things like not just the largest, not just the tails, but things like the median, the median matters a lot. What things end up about the middle. The other thing that I do is I calculate the returns, exonerating both tails, one tail, so that I can see how do things work? How does the average P&L work if I get rid of the extremes? If I see the average P&L move a lot, that tells me I have a strategy that's highly, highly dependent on whatever those extremes are. So if I can explain in an upside extreme, if that came from pure luck, then I would generally analyze the strategy without that data point included so that I can see what the true performance is. And then to the downside, if it's something where I fat-fingered something and I just made a giant mistake, and that's what led me to lose a bunch of money that otherwise structurally wouldn't be part of the strategy, then I would exonerate that. I would still track it as my P&L. It's my P&L. But when I'm analyzing stuff to try and improve what I'm doing, I would take those data points in a consideration. Now if you just have a strategy where if you take the tails off, the extremes, like the most extreme one or two trades, and it doesn't change that much, well then that tells you quite a lot. It tells you that your strategy is pretty widespread by itself. So there's a lot of small inferences like that that we can make. So I'm literally going to go through all of these really quick. Recess coefficient loss me. Yeah, so the coefficient variance is a little easier than it might seem. All it's telling us is the relative variability against the mean. Whereas if you think about standard deviation that's giving you the absolute dispersion or variance about a mean. So the main difference between a standard deviation and coefficient variance is one is using total total variance and then coefficient variance is using relative variability. FXT says how does this log accommodate path and regime change? Like how do you see that type of shift happening? It's a great question. So in a log like this, there's a couple ways you can do it. You can either simply track these numbers and you can see how they're changing day over day. So you can take screenshots of your metrics. Anytime you make an update. So if I'm down here updating a trade and then normally what I do is I have another section down here. So this would be like the live trade section. And then this would be the closed trade section. So if I copy this out and I actually just use a macro, there's a button I click and when I click the button, it automatically inserts a cell down here. It copies this entire range as values down here and then it deletes the input ranges from in this context, AF to AX. So you can build a button that does it. That's easy or you can just copy and paste it and then come up here and manually delete. But what you can do is as you're updating your live trades. So let's say that we're taking something down before I take it down, you can take a screenshot here and then you could just put it in a cell over here so that like this. So if I take a screenshot, I drop that screenshot in. I can have a date column. So today's date is 20 June or 20 June slash if you like it for whatever reason. And then I can click the cell that I want to put it in. And then I literally just put put image in the cell. Bay, I'm there it is. So then I can create a library this way. Now it's easy now to extract data from this, from pictures. It used to not be. So what you can do for a more live sense is you can literally copy and paste this as an entirety over to the side as well, not a photo, but the thing itself. And then you can run whatever analysis you want off of it. So that's the simple way is literally just to track this stuff here. Now what I do in my log is I have a couple things. This is just like a super simplified version of stuff. What I do is up here, I have two inputs. I have something like population in sample. And then I have input dates. So then what I do is I'll populate and then I have an input for strategy. And realistically, it actually looks like this where it goes, I'd like that. So what I do is I use a drop down for my strategy. So it'll pull from any of these. And then it'll pull all of these population levels statistics, which looks at the entire log. And then I then date bound it to take a look at the sample. So then I can just quickly visualize over the last week. How is this performed against the population? That's another way. And then the other thing that my log has is over to the side here. I have a full statistical breakdown with actual graphs that help me see everything. It's the same concept where I bound it by date and strategy. I take a look at population in sample, but I create visuals that essentially give me all of this data, but visualized. So it allows me to detect them, to see them. So it's a great question. And that's that's how you can detect things as they're shifting. Now this is from a data perspective. There's also just a trader intuition, which you will develop that over time. And that will also become part of the thing that's more so for like regime chefs. So for example, I didn't need to like do some sort of rigorous statistical analysis that when inflation started skyrocketing to know that small caps were going to get hurt. Right? That's why you guys saw me rotate out of the Russell, which I typically trade that came down in its entirety. And it's because of that. Like I knew it was going to struggle. Now, when it comes to path, that's why graphs are really, really useful because you can see the actual individual data points and how they relate to one another. With summary level statistics like this, you'll never see that. And that's why having like different views is really important. And that's honestly a really, really good question. But that's the long answer, but at least honest answer on how to accommodate things like path of returns in your analysis. And then to track things like regime changes. It's a great question. Trace says, updated my log to track standard deviation coefficient. That's good. Need to add downside deviation sequence max CD. Yeah, those are super, super useful. And then it really can go again, like I said, and that's not to be like intimidating or anything, but like this is a really simplified version. The reason why it's so simple is you have to think of it this way. Once you build this, you build it once. So once you struggle through learning the difference between standard deviation, downside deviation between sharp and sortino between different margin of error inputs into your coefficient variance calculator. Right? Like once you tinker with all that stuff, once it's built, it's built. So you have to think like I've been building my log literally for almost 20 years. Realistically, I would give it maybe 15 because the logs that I had in the beginning were pretty trash. So the like that's why even this, which to me is like extremely basic, can look super overwhelming. And it's just because it might be something that somebody might not have started at all. So then when you see this, it's like, oh, fuck, that's a lot. But in reality, it's it's really not. If you think about a professional sport, how many stats they give a professional athlete? They have everything from their average scoring by distance, by defender, by side of the court, like all of these stats, that's for basketball. And it's just because once you observe stuff long enough, you can come up with different data points that become relevant. So I view this as like a solid minimum starting point. This gives you at least enough stuff to take a look at to have some ideas on where to go. So now we'll just take a quick look at these. We already talked about a bunch of them. So you already know how to use literally all of these total PNL. Obviously, you need to know how your thing is doing in total averages. So it breaks that down over different individual trade lens so that you know what each individual exposure typically looks like. We break down between wins and losses. So like everything in here is designed to make it simple to come up with at least broad ideas on what you might take a look at. So for example, if I'm trading a long strangle or straddle strategy either or and I notice that my win rate as a percentage is going down, but my average PNL is going up. That'll spark some questions. And as you're doing this, it'll be really simple. You'll immediately know that you're losing more frequently, but less. And when you're winning, you're winning more, but less often. But then you can actually measure the relationship between those. So if I see the average PNL going up, is it because my wins are that much larger or is it because my losses have become much smaller? And this ties back into the trade plan and the trade plan change template that we talk about. Because when I think about my trade plan, let's say my trade plan says, I'm going to exit my, what is this long strangle? So I'm going to exit this long strangle talking on the losing side. Let's say in the beginning, it's at X-PRI. Then in again, my 20 June update, my change log, I'm going to know changed exit to be 50% loss, just picking something. So then when I go back to this and I input my dates, I can see what's going on. As I change my loss from just taking it to X-PRI to 50% loss, what do I notice? Well, I would expect to see my average PNL change in some way. Now, it depends on what the strategy is and what the tails look like. Because taking it down at a 50% loss could improve my average PNL or it can hurt my average PNL. If it hurts my average PNL, it tells me that I'm now knocking off too many wins. So I would then expect to see a change in my win rate and my average wins. So this is the iterative process. This is what I spend a lot of time with people that I do one-on-ones with is like literally running through this analysis because it's nothing that you can't figure out on your own. But if you don't think to look at this stuff, most people probably would never do so. And that's why I'm doing streams like this to give you the ideas even though there's 18 people watching this, I don't care. I think this information is really important. I think that for the people that do watch this, it has the capacity to make a big difference. So now you have some ideas on when you're evaluating a trading strategy, some of the stuff to look at. And this also turned into a little bit about building a log to help give you those data points to look at, but pretty much it. So what stuff you guys want to talk about? What questions do you have anything else that you want to hit before we wrap up? Reese says, are they correlated? Yeah, you could argue that they're correlated. Just look at different things. So here, let's literally show you really quick. The way to think about it before I show you is if you think about standard deviation, that's just showing you total magnitude. And then coefficient variance is showing you relative. So let's use Gemini. And let's say I'm learning about standard deviation and coefficient variance. Give me an example to help understand the difference between the metrics. Have the end create a table that summarizes each for a quick comparison. Let us learn together. Whoa, tail of two cafes literally puts it in a story that's kind of fun. So your coffee kind of sore trying to decide between two cafes, daily grind and bean dream. Great names. You're interested in how consistently they deliver your latte, specifically how much milk they add in millimeters is a very specific person. You visit each cafe five times and measure the milk in your latte. So daily grind gives you these numbers. Bean dream gives you these numbers. So you can calculate first the standard deviation for both of these, which essentially is you can see for each data point, you just need to find how far they are off a mean. You square them because it makes them all the same type of number, positive integer. Then you sum them. And then you divide by the total data points, you square root. The reason why you take the square root is you square them. So everything becomes magnified. So you take it back down to whatever the original magnitude was. And then you get your metric. So between these, we have seven mill and 14 mill. So what does this tell us about the difference between bean dream and daily grind, daily grinds at seven mill, bean dreams at 14. So you can see this, this is incredible. The fact that it gives you this whole story. It says per daily grind on average, the amount of milk in your latte deviates about seven mill. And then in bean dream, it deviates by 14 mill. So there's a much larger deviation in your milk content from cafe B. So it's more spread out. Now if we take a look at CV, all we're doing is taking the standard deviation. And a lot of times like more often than not, we are going to express it as a percentage. So you take the standard deviation over the average and then turn it into a percentage. So you can see daily grind is a 3.7% CV. Bean dream is 12.8% then here that says daily grind, this means the standard deviation is about 3.72% of the mean. Yeah, okay, this is a fair way to describe it. So let's see if it clears this up. It's kind of like reiterating what it is. It might not actually clarify it. Let's see how it does it. Then it gives you bean dream saying that they're 12.85% of the mean. So this says even though cafe B has higher absolute standard deviation, 14 mill versus 7 mill, it's relative variability as much. Yeah, this does a beautiful job. It's relative variability is much higher. The standard deviation of 14 mill for cafe B is much larger proportion of its mean 110 mill than the standard deviation of 7 mill. Yeah, this is great. This is a good job. I like this. This does a good job. And then our summary table, what it measures, absolute dispersion, like we talked about relative amount of dispersion about the mean we talked about, gives you the units again, typically CV as a percentage interpretation for standard deviation, how much on average individual data points deviate from the mean good, how variable a data set is in proportion to its average that's solid. It's really solid. This is great. You all just literally got a undergrad level understanding of standard deviation in CV. That's actually absolutely sick. Thank you. Good job. Any questions on that? This is sick. I'm like actually impressed with how well it does this for you guys. Cool. All right, gang. Well, that's your crash course on understanding what is worth taking a look at in a trade log. And this will help you a lot with actually evaluating a trading strategy. So as always, if you guys need anything, let me know being outlier. Tell it.
