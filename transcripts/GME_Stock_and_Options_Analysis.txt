0.60s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.28s: it's been a minute since I took a look
3.68s: at gme so that's the goal for today but
5.92s: as you could tell we have a little guest
7.56s: appearance which is my spine today I had
10.48s: the pleasure of getting an epidural
12.08s: injection you can see there's actually
13.32s: two of them here and it's for all the
15.72s: dis stuff that I'm trying to resolve
17.60s: right now this is supposed to help
18.84s: reduce inflammation but I've never seen
21.32s: anything like this before so I thought I
22.80s: would share it with you because as I
24.60s: mention all the time the goal of what I
26.32s: do is to share knowledge some of it
29.12s: trading related most of it that's where
31.00s: most of my knowledge is but some of it
32.96s: is in learning stuff about this which is
35.12s: actually kind of cool these are like
36.48s: super big needles I think they said they
37.76s: were like 3 and 1 12 in and they go into
40.24s: the epidural space they put in a
42.64s: contrast that's what makes the nerves
44.64s: here you can actually see the nerves
46.40s: it's what makes the nerves this darker
48.24s: color so that they can see them and then
51.00s: yeah interesting I thought overall and
54.12s: the other fun fact is these little bends
56.68s: the doctor actually puts the bends in
58.92s: them herself
60.44s: and it's so that she can drive the
62.36s: needle better meaning you know position
64.16s: it to where she wants so fun stuff all
66.44s: around all right now let's talk about
68.12s: the markets GameStop what's been going
69.72s: on here well we're running sideways we
72.88s: had a little bit of a breath of fresh
74.36s: air once we saw that the at the market
77.20s: had completed we've seen volume start to
79.92s: contract back down so we hit a peak
82.56s: volume here on the 20th of September at
85.68s: 62 million shares then we came down to
88.00s: 14 then we came down to 12 then we came
90.52s: down to six and now we are down to 5.7
93.92s: so this is kind of standard fair for
95.60s: what I've seen previously after we go
98.60s: through the offering where things start
100.12s: to cool off now the cool part is we can
102.92s: see that overall GameStop has been
105.12s: consolidating really nicely here so
108.04s: we're definitely leveled up a little bit
110.48s: from running down towards the 200 day
112.56s: moving averages so I'm actually really
115.20s: eager to see if we continue trending
117.92s: sideways here or if there is point where
120.36s: it starts to turn back over but even on
122.40s: a down day relative like today meaning
125.28s: um I'll show you in a second what I mean
127.64s: on today we can see that it didn't
130.04s: actually dump off that hard and it's
133.00s: very much just in a little bit of this
134.68s: consolidation phase so I don't mind
137.08s: seeing this and I hope that it can
139.44s: continue trending like this now
141.20s: regardless of what I hope or what I want
142.84s: to see it doesn't really matter cu the
144.24s: Market's going to do whatever the market
145.60s: wants to do and right now we see massive
149.60s: Mass massive call skew and this is I'm
152.24s: not being hyperbolic this is massive
154.64s: relative call skew there's over 700,000
157.56s: calls against less than 300,000 puts
160.72s: that's even greater than the standard
162.68s: 2:1 that I look for in a general bullet
164.92s: configuration and again it's relative to
167.84s: the product so when I say 2: one I'm
169.76s: just talking about the ratio of calls to
171.40s: puts and it's highly product specific in
174.24s: general I almost always see GameStop
176.36s: with call skew however from the put side
179.52s: they've actually been coming down quite
181.08s: a lot the other thing I want you to look
183.04s: at is look at the
184.48s: breakdown of these different expiration
187.96s: Cycles so we can see that most of the
191.24s: calls actually are in 18 October that
195.04s: have the higher oi and for the puts it's
197.96s: a bit of a mix I see 18 October for sure
201.16s: but then I also see longer term
203.08s: expiration Cycles like 17 Jan 25 so
206.48s: those are people playing longer term
208.28s: hedging positions and that's actually
210.12s: what makes up the bulk of what we see
212.48s: here from the put oi side of things so
215.40s: overall very interesting volatility
218.00s: still low this is again kind of the new
221.04s: Norm where I'm seeing everything below
222.92s: 100% so relative basis right 100% Vol is
226.84s: not low in a gross number but for
228.96s: something like GameStop that is
230.68s: relatively low now a couple other
233.92s: General admin notes that I'm picking up
235.84s: on for me I'm still essentially trading
238.12s: the same thing I've had a couple people
239.52s: add about what I'm doing in here and
241.72s: it's standard fair I still have the base
243.72s: position which is with long shares and
245.72s: then I am still selling short calls
247.48s: against it because there's no reason for
249.04s: me not to and it's a way for me to
250.80s: continue to extract some value from
252.88s: Gamestop while we're going through these
255.36s: lows this is actually exactly where
257.44s: those short calls are useful now the
259.44s: downside to the short calls is that if
261.12s: we get a big spike they get ran over and
263.40s: it can offer a massive problem that's
265.76s: why I always always sell them at a ratio
268.56s: so what I mean by that is
270.40s: I'm going to make sure I have at least
272.12s: more than 100 shares of GameStop if I'm
274.20s: going to sell one call so that if my
276.92s: shares get called away for whatever
278.36s: reason unlikely but if they did in that
280.04s: big up move I have the shares to offer
281.88s: because I do not want to be short
283.52s: GameStop that's a terrible place to be
285.76s: and that's not just because of the fun
287.48s: of talking about how screwed up the
288.84s: shorts are but from a Trader's
290.44s: perspective that can put you in a really
291.96s: bad spot if there is a squeeze
293.96s: unfortunately at that same point in time
296.24s: so by keeping it at a ratio I make sure
298.72s: I do not cap my profit potential if
301.48s: there is a squeeze because I do not want
303.36s: to cap The Profit potential during those
305.24s: movements I want to be able to trade
307.04s: them that's what I do so couple other
310.52s: admin notes let's take a quick look at
313.40s: some dark poool trades because we are
315.68s: still seeing these 5,000 blocks come
318.16s: through I think that's worth noting I
320.20s: don't think we have a discreet
322.04s: understanding of what exactly this is
324.04s: just yet but I think it is something I
326.52s: continue to see and then if I look back
328.80s: at the 25th and I filter Max of 5,000 I
332.16s: can see them again and it's kind of a
334.32s: similar sizing so again I do not think
337.44s: anybody has a monopoly on the number
339.08s: 5,000 and I again I do not think all of
341.52s: these would be roaring Kitty even if
343.80s: this was him this looks like standard
346.12s: people transacting but the thing I
348.08s: cannot help but find really interesting
350.36s: about these is that if we go back to
352.52s: like the middle of April something like
355.00s: that we don't actually see 5,000 block
358.52s: transactions going on they don't really
360.72s: seem to start until we get into May
363.12s: sometime and then they start popping up
366.36s: so just kind of an interesting thing I
369.04s: don't think again anything to
370.88s: specifically highlight other than the
372.52s: occurrence of the thing and then we'll
374.80s: continue keeping an eyeball on it to see
376.40s: if anything materializes last thing I
378.76s: want to take a look at with you
380.92s: obviously are the options side of things
384.00s: to see if we have any interesting Trends
386.20s: I haven't looked at this yet so we'll
387.40s: look at it together really quick
390.44s: and what do we have uh I realize that
394.00s: I'm filtering by something give me one
396.12s: sec so it keeps the size which obviously
398.88s: I'm not looking for 5,000 blocks here
400.40s: I'm just looking for any transactions I
402.32s: want to sort it by premium and super
405.56s: quiet today super super quiet today
407.88s: biggest trade was 42k there's not much
410.00s: to talk about there I'll do for the week
411.84s: leading in just because I haven't looked
413.36s: at GameStop specifically yet and still
416.52s: very very quiet so important to note
420.40s: again we keep an eye on this because as
422.12s: we see changes that's when things start
423.60s: getting really interesting now last item
426.08s: on the agenda is actually a question
427.64s: that I got via email so let's see what
430.28s: Paul our friend Paul shout out to you
432.20s: Paul great to hear from you uh Paul says
434.28s: I've been enjoining your videos lately
435.64s: learning a lot about options I was
436.80s: looking at J Feed today and wonder if
438.28s: you could comment on the trades in the
439.64s: photo below I'm guessing they are
441.24s: connected based on time sizes and
442.84s: wondered if you can give your thoughts
443.76s: on their possible strategy so first and
445.96s: foremost I actually think that is um and
448.92s: this isn't meant to sound mean or
450.60s: anything like that but I personally
452.00s: think it's a giant waste of time to play
453.92s: this game I'm happy to go through the
456.04s: idea because I understand their
457.96s: perspective I know where Paul is coming
460.48s: at this from which is trying to connect
462.44s: dots the problem is you cannot
466.16s: discreetly connect these dots literally
468.68s: ever anytime that we're coming up with
471.48s: connected dots meaning this person
473.48s: probably did this and then this it's
475.36s: still an inference even when we had that
478.52s: crazy option volume not all too long ago
481.00s: in GameStop where we saw somebody buying
483.88s: pretty big options trades and then
485.68s: unwinding them like a half hour later in
488.44s: the same size in the same strike in the
490.96s: same expiration it looks like the same
493.44s: person and it's I would assume it is but
497.08s: it's still an assumption we don't know
499.00s: for certain and it's important to
501.28s: identify that fact because the process
503.92s: of going through and trying to identify
505.80s: what other people are doing is such a
509.04s: difficult way to attempt to make money
512.12s: trading so that's why I think it's a
514.64s: really difficult process to go through
516.68s: now that aside happy to talk about this
518.92s: with Paul I just want to give that note
521.64s: so that we don't have people that are
522.92s: trying to do this all the time as like
524.80s: their main approach to trading because
526.84s: again it's going to be really difficult
528.60s: to turn that into anything usable so now
532.44s: to Paul's point if we take a look at
534.88s: this I had to zoom it in a little bit so
536.20s: it's a little more legible we can see
537.96s: that he's looking at two specific series
540.28s: here we have the 17 jm25 18 calls and
545.28s: then we have the 27 sep 2024 expiration
549.56s: 17 calls so the first thing I can see
552.76s: here is that if we add up these numbers
556.04s: so for these 18 calls if we add the 200
558.96s: if we add the 160 if we add the 74 and
562.44s: if we add the 116 it comes out to 550 so
567.12s: that is very likely this same person and
570.24s: it's very likely the same person that's
572.24s: getting filled over time into a position
575.56s: and then we can look at the same thing
576.92s: with these 17 calls that are expiring
579.40s: nearer in time that these these ones are
581.28s: being purchased and we can see a similar
584.36s: process where it does look like based on
586.64s: the time that this is the same person
588.36s: getting fills at similar time frames so
591.80s: we can model this trade together and see
594.52s: what it looks like so if we pop over
597.32s: here to the platform we can go to the
598.72s: trade tab and we can grab first the 17
602.16s: JN 25s go out here and then we can grab
604.92s: the 18 calls which are in the money
607.24s: these are being sold because these are
610.04s: coming in at the bid and I'm just going
612.84s: to Ballpark it at like 580 something
614.68s: like that it doesn't really matter what
616.40s: the price is I just want to give it to
617.64s: you for context and we have a bunch of
619.60s: trades in here because we've been
620.88s: looking at roaring Kitty trades so we'll
623.12s: have to tick some of these off and then
625.40s: we'll start with these so we have those
627.56s: and again we know that we have 550
629.96s: 50 of those so we'll put short 550 then
633.76s: if we go to
635.32s: the what do we have here the 17s on the
640.32s: 27th and we have again it looks like 550
645.12s: of those as well cuz the numbers match
646.76s: so I think it's a completely Fair
647.96s: assumption to say that we think this is
649.28s: the same person and if we sell these
653.40s: ones were bought at the offer and again
655.40s: just Ball parking price it's like five
663.28s: what I'm doing right now by the way is
664.56s: just looking at the the executed price
666.68s: just to come up with an idea and it's
668.76s: like super close it's a little bit
670.44s: cheaper so maybe we'll call it like 540
673.52s: or something like that just a little bit
674.96s: cheaper than the others and again we'll
676.44s: size this up so that it mirrors what we
678.88s: have so we'll analyze this we'll add
681.48s: this up so that it's 550 of those and
685.44s: then we got those again for maybe like
687.72s: five we'll call it like 540 or something
690.68s: like
691.60s: that so that's the trade and if you're
694.68s: wondering what that trade is it
696.20s: essentially is just looking for movement
698.56s: now this can happen in a few different
700.44s: ways but this is more likely a play on
703.00s: volatility than anything else that's
704.68s: what I see here because by coming into
707.16s: this really near-term position I'm
709.48s: seeing the idea that we're playing
711.76s: probably close Vol expanding is what I'm
715.24s: guessing but again the most important
717.68s: point to note here is we don't know what
718.96s: else is in this person's book right and
721.64s: that's what makes it such a a sloppy
724.04s: game of trying to understand what
725.40s: they're doing because I have no idea
728.08s: what else is in this person's portfolio
730.36s: and even though these trades went on
732.16s: seemingly at the same time and seemingly
733.96s: make this it doesn't necessarily tell us
736.64s: the whole picture of what else is hold
738.24s: held in the portfolio and how maybe
740.52s: these don't even line up with one
741.68s: another maybe they were just put on at
743.44s: the same time but tied to other
744.76s: positions really hard to say but if I
747.36s: were to look at these in a vacuum to
749.36s: Paul's question it looks like a
750.88s: volatility play that's my best guess so
753.80s: got to wrap up cuz I'm hopping over to
755.48s: the outlier Pro live stream I
757.60s: rescheduled the stream with Peruvian bow
760.40s: just because I didn't know if I was
761.56s: going to be messed up after getting the
763.88s: procedure done a little earlier today
765.40s: overall feel okay so should be good to
767.56s: go but yeah I will follow back up with
769.92s: you all when we're going to do that and
771.08s: then we have the gme live stream
772.20s: tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time be an
773.72s: outlier see you later
