0.00s: What's up, everybody? I think this thing's turning on. We're on here. What's going on?
14.24s: We have a hopefully a bunch of work to go through tonight. I want to spend time going through
22.20s: a lot more of that DD library that we took a peek at a little bit last time that I had
28.28s: no idea what was the thing, but super stoked that it is. So we're going to poke through
33.80s: there and hopefully learn some more about GameStop, the stock, the background, the story, all
42.52s: of that great stuff. I was actually just texting with Peruvian Bull. So he and I, we're going
49.96s: to create some more content together in a little bit, actually pretty stoked. He's starting
57.76s: to build out and might get a little bit more into live streaming and stuff, which would
60.52s: be really, really cool. I like learning about his perspectives and what not. So what's
68.36s: up, apes? Great to see everybody. Also great to see the outliers and the outlier apes. Really,
74.52s: whatever you consider yourself is cool here. We don't really care. Everybody is welcome.
83.32s: Let me grab a few reddits. We need to grab GameStop. We need to grab Superstunk. I think those
93.40s: are the main ones, right? For GameStop reddits, is that correct? I think so. Yeah.
108.00s: And we got to grab the, we got to grab our map as well. You already know that. Cool. So I think
121.16s: we literally have everything we're ready to grow. First things first, you already know what's
125.40s: up. I need to know where you're from if you haven't told us yet. So we are map is filling out.
135.16s: There was somebody on one of the other live streams that was a little salty that I spend
140.20s: time in the beginning of the live streams, which kind of bullshitting and doing this map thing.
143.72s: But I told them that I actually don't really give a fuck about their opinion. And I have
149.04s: fun looking at the map with you guys. One of the really cool things about this for me, at
153.92s: least, is how crazy is it that there is an individual stock that connects people like this?
164.32s: I don't know of many other stocks that do this. Sure. You could say something like Apple
170.20s: or Amazon, but it's different, right? Like people that are buying Apple or Amazon, they're
175.64s: not buying it because we just love Apple as a company. It's, no, we think Apple is revolutionizing
184.88s: technology and growing, which is one of the neatest things about it, I think. So the fact
191.24s: is like right now for literally everybody on the stream, there's people from all these
197.48s: different places that have been on this stream. And I emphasize this stream because it's
201.72s: not like I have a big YouTube channel or anything. So the fact that there's this many people
205.88s: from all these different places from this smaller corner of the world, I think is really
211.36s: cool.
212.36s: May he can boys from California, may he can boy, don't you lie to me? Your dad names
217.40s: pretty clear where you're from. I'm just saying like I was born at night, but it wasn't
222.72s: last night. You're trying to tell me California. I'm trying to tell you based on your name.
229.12s: I'm not buying it. I'm not fucking buying it. Maybe we're in, let's go. So if you're in
235.96s: California, you're probably somewhere super far south or LA based on your name. And my
242.76s: guess is, well, let's see, we have to get a fact check here. So may he can boy, wherein
249.96s: may he can may he call or are you from originally? We got Maui, I don't know if we have Maui
257.16s: on the list already. I think we have Hawaii. Yes. So we have Honolulu. We need to add Maui.
270.44s: That's a cool ad. And then I guess one time I have to I have to stream one word and
275.80s: Kauai so that we can we can cross Kauai off the list because technically my wife, they're
283.78s: not from she's not from Kauai, but she kind of grew up there. So she went to like school
289.20s: and stuff and Kauai. So I mean, that's that's pretty close. I would give her credit for
297.84s: Megan voices Monterey County. Oh, I see. I see. All right.
306.40s: Khalid Nali says actually someone named outlier asked me about that on discord, but is this
316.68s: part of something else? But I wasn't sure if it was a bot. No, it wasn't. So for anybody
327.04s: ever that for those that don't know, there is a free part to the discord. And then there's
333.12s: the part for the Patreon people. But the discord is free literally for everybody to join. But I want
339.44s: to emphasize a specific element of it, which is this. For literally anybody that finds their way
351.52s: into the discord, when you go to start here, I want you to to read this very first part at the
359.92s: very tippy top. We do not DM anybody. It is such an important note. None of us DM anybody. The reason
367.76s: for that is because the the scam on discord is actually really, really informed. What they do
374.00s: is they leave people in the discord so that they're the people the person in the discord
380.08s: isn't the one that's actively reaching out. And they feed the names to other people because we
385.20s: have it set up that unless you're verified, you can't see everybody else, which is kind of part of
390.32s: how I set up the partitioning system. So yeah, the punchline is don't get just don't get scammed.
397.60s: That would be that would be great. And I say that because I started doing the whole YouTube
402.40s: thing and building the community and all this stuff to help people. And it would it's just
405.76s: super frustrating to me that some people are getting ripped off by
411.28s: some some bots straight piss me off. So a college says, got you a dude had your link. Oh, yeah,
419.36s: they copy everything. Yeah. So what they do is they they literally copy the entire profile to
426.40s: make it obviously look like it's me. That's their goal. One of the things that you can do
431.36s: college out of curiosity is if you go to their profile and you look at when it was created.
436.16s: And then if you look at the the way that it's actually spelled, there's going to be errors of
440.16s: some sort. Obviously, because it's not me. So they'll they'll have small errors in there. But
444.64s: they're super smart. They they do stuff. That's one of the reasons why I switched from ES
449.68s: invests because it was too easy to confuse uppercase eyes in lowercase else, which is also pretty
457.84s: funny. So yeah, boy, don't get scammed out there. That's all I got to say.
462.88s: James says, my one friend has 40 K and GM me. I'm praying for him. Well, depending on what is
466.96s: basis at, he might be all right. Pench potentially. And then mock chicken says RGME. Okay, so I have
476.32s: that one up. We'll be able to go through there. And then James says, you're a great guy. Eric,
479.76s: thanks for the advice the other week already adapting to bigger losses now that I sized up my
484.32s: portfolio. I don't know what I told you, but hopefully it was useful.
491.12s: Tanner says book of mo last parts one through three by GERKIN IT. Also, where did the shares go?
500.16s: Okay, cool. So I will absolutely. I'll absolutely check those out. Great. Great call out.
508.48s: So show James says his basis is 20. Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm your friends doing okay then.
516.64s: The main thing is if your friend has more money and game stop at a basis of 20 that they're
521.52s: uncomfortable with, they can literally flatten whenever they want. That's easy.
527.92s: P.F.A. says Tyson definitely had Moas last night. Tyson did have Moas. He made a ton of money.
533.44s: I'm so stoked for Mike. It's like, it's crazy to me that all these people are so pissed off about
543.52s: the Mike Tyson fight. And I just cannot understand what the fucking like what people thought was going to
552.56s: like I just I don't understand it. So this is pretty cool. Let's grab. Let's grab this.
558.88s: Because you guys know, like I'm a martial artist myself and I'm a fight fan. Like I love combatos.
565.04s: I like martial arts a lot. And this is hilarious too. This is so good. This is so good.
578.16s: But yeah, I think one of the things that did surprise me, I have to be honest, is that
586.56s: his legs in training looked fine. Like they didn't look that bad. And whatever reason in the
593.52s: actual fight, it looked like he couldn't even like really walk, which I couldn't figure that out.
600.64s: Because they're obviously they're not going through like some big dehydration rehydration thing.
605.44s: I like I yeah, I just I couldn't identify why that was happening the way that it was. It didn't
611.52s: make sense to me. And obviously training clips are always going to be really carefully selected and
616.56s: what not. But it literally looked like he like couldn't walk well, which I that part I don't really
623.60s: understand. The other thing that I thought was really interesting is that he just didn't throw much
630.72s: which that's why is this Mike Tyson fans are saying she stole the show. Oh, I see.
641.52s: Yeah.
645.52s: What the fuck is this Mike Tyson to Jake Paul in the third round. Oh, yeah, that's funny. It's
652.00s: fun. That's so funny. Yeah, anyways, I I didn't think that he he looked. I don't think that he
660.40s: looked that bad. I think people people had some crazy as expectations for a dude that's almost 60.
667.28s: But I did expect him to be able to walk a little bit like that that really did surprise me at
671.12s: the fact that he couldn't really walk well. That kind of sucked. That Lawrence is the girl fight was
678.32s: good. Yeah. So that fight I didn't catch all of it because we went for a walk during it.
684.80s: And it looked I mean, it looked like they they had a war though from the clips that I saw before
690.24s: he left and whatnot. So yeah, that that I'm stoked was a was a good fight. It looked like the one
696.96s: girl had a cut above the eyebrow, which always sucks. Like getting I don't know. Getting cuts like
704.64s: that, especially from it accidental headbutt just sucks because it puts a different tenor and it
709.92s: changes the fight a lot. But I mean, it is what it is, right? It's the fight game shit happens.
715.60s: Colleagues is totally his legs were thrown me off. What was you doing with the chewing his glove
719.04s: or mouthpiece? It wasn't the it wasn't the mouthpiece. If you watch again, like I'm a bit of a
725.28s: fight dude. So if you watch my Tyson's old fights, he has a tick where he bites his glove.
731.28s: But I think he was obviously doing a lot there because it he wasn't anywhere near as active as he
737.44s: was in his previous fights. So I think for sure it was just him at least I didn't see anything like
746.40s: there was nothing wrong with the mouthpiece from what I saw went in went out just fine.
750.56s: It was nice and tight as it should have been because his coach had a hard time plucking it out a
754.80s: few times. But yeah, that it just I've seen him do it a bunch throughout his career. It's like
760.56s: this fucking tick he does. I think it was revved up to like 11 though because he probably felt a bit
767.68s: uncomfortable, right? Like as you can see when he tried to bounce around and get his feet on
771.84s: for whatever reason, like he couldn't he like it didn't look comfortable at all, which is again,
777.84s: it's so I just I'm really, really confused by it to be completely honest because like he didn't
783.36s: look bad when he was sparring. And again, I understand that sparring is different than
792.16s: you know, because they're going to release very carefully curated footage. But still like to
798.48s: be that different with your legs from sparring to that. I don't know dog. I thought I thought that
804.64s: was fucking I thought it was fucking weird. I couldn't piece it together. It looked like something
810.72s: was look like something was wrong. But the other thing I have to say to give credit where credits do
818.88s: Jake, Jake could have fucked him up not saying that he could have knocked him out. I don't know
824.24s: about that. But like there was a there was a couple there was a couple hits where Jake clearly
830.00s: knocked him off balance. And he could have followed up a lot more aggressively probably knocked him
835.60s: down. I absolutely could have seen that happening again. Like if you don't have legs getting knocked
839.76s: down entirely realistic. And he didn't do that to him, which I actually thought was classy. I
845.12s: thought that that was cool. So yeah. Overall. Overall, interesting. The main thing is I'm fucking stoked
856.56s: that he got through it. All right. That he's healthy. He looks completely fine. He came in in shape.
866.16s: Oh, here's some highlights. Yeah, like he just his legs just don't look like they're fucking move
871.20s: in man. And you see how much he's on his heels and flat foot. That part's also really strange.
881.28s: Yeah. Interesting.
888.16s: Mark chicken says Jake pulled his punches when he he gauged Mike where Mike really was. Yeah,
893.04s: yeah, yeah. Cause I mean, the first two rounds Mike did not look bad at all. He really didn't. He
899.36s: was moving okay. And he and he was hitting okay. But like, yeah, just seeing the way that he's
905.92s: responding to these hits, you could tell he's not getting rocked. Like Jake's not rocking him at all.
912.56s: But it's like he can't fucking stand. Like he just couldn't get his speed under him, which was
916.40s: really interesting. So yeah, I'm glad that they that again, he got through it. All right, he looked
922.64s: okay. Cause the main thing everybody kept asking me like for my friends and stuff, because they know
926.96s: I like fighting and they were they were like, yo, you know, what do you think about Mike Tyson
931.36s: fighting? And it's like, it's one, it's not me to judge. But more importantly than that, I want
937.20s: Mike to do whatever the fuck Mike wants to do. So like if Mike genuinely wanted to do that fight,
942.00s: I'm so I'm so stoked for him. If for whatever reason whatsoever, he felt pressured to do it,
947.52s: whether it be for money or for something else, then that kind of sucks. But yeah, the you
956.72s: could tell even the way when when Mike did connect with Jake compared to when Jake was connecting
962.96s: with Mike, Mike was just getting kind of like pushed as a whole unit. But the handful of punches
969.60s: that Mike landed like you could literally see Jake's head moving, right? There's a difference in
974.00s: power that Jake doesn't have compared even to 58 year old Mike Tyson. There's a power difference
980.80s: that you can see it. You literally can see it in a sturdiness difference. So
986.56s: that's like says he did it for the money. I think he knew he wasn't going to have this. I think
989.84s: so too. I think for sure that obviously if if it wasn't what like a $20 million fight,
998.08s: I think that changes things. But even then, I don't think Mike needed the $20 million. Who doesn't
1003.04s: want $20 million? I'm sure it doesn't hurt. So I actually don't think the money was the only
1007.84s: motivating factor. My guess is he was looking for just the experience. That's the other thing to
1015.84s: know about a fighter like him. It's all he knows. He's fought his whole fucking life. And the only
1022.64s: time he's been able to get out of the whole fight thing is by heavily drugging himself. He's either
1029.12s: highest fuck or on a bunch of fucking shrooms to chill the fuck out, which is good. I'm glad he's
1035.20s: able to find peace. But that also that's another way to go through life, right? That's still not going
1039.36s: through life sober as you are who you are. It's altering yourself quite a lot. So yeah, to me,
1047.52s: I still think he can fight. I don't know what happened with his legs. But I think if they
1052.80s: can figure that fucking leg thing out, whatever that was, I think he looked fine. He was moving at
1057.20s: the waist well. He can still fucking throw when he wants. But if you think about a big part of his
1062.40s: style, it's slipping and moving and countering. But a big part of his counters as a smaller dude
1070.24s: is he has to be able to leap forward to throw his punches. He has to. He's not a huge jab, dude. He's
1078.96s: a hook guy. So without legs to close the gap like that, it doesn't work. And you can tell because
1087.44s: anytime Jake started getting near Tyson, Jake just backed out, which is super smart because the
1095.28s: fact is, again, even 50 or eight year old Mike, man, if he connects well, like you're fucking sleeping,
1101.44s: there are people who have the gift of power and there are people who do not. Jake Paul doesn't
1106.64s: really have the gift of power like that. You can tell just by the way he connects with people.
1110.96s: Somebody like Francis and Gano from the UFC does Alex Pereira from the UFC does. And the way
1118.08s: you can tell that power differential from people is when we have somebody that has to catch you
1126.16s: perfectly in order to knock you out or TKO you, that's mostly precision timing speed applied
1136.48s: really well. That's like a countermer Gregor. That's what countermer Gregor has precision timing speed.
1141.60s: He has that stuff down perfectly to connect. But then there are people like, for instance,
1146.64s: Gano when he knocked out Alistair over him who's no slouch. Alistair over him is a tough mother
1151.68s: fucking dude. And you I'll show you the punch. He like he literally connected on like his fucking neck.
1159.20s: And he still had more than enough power to put him out. That's the nature of heavy weights. As
1163.36s: soon as you're above you know 220 you have generally the gift to enough power to put somebody
1171.28s: to sleep decisively. I'm really interested to see steep A versus John Jones. I don't think
1179.68s: it boats well for steep A because he's been so inactive. But we'll see how that goes. What was
1185.68s: it going to look up in Gano over him. And then we'll get into Jimmy. Yeah, this this year.
1199.60s: I have to kill the sound. Otherwise you guys know we'll get we'll get like copyright struck. But
1207.04s: take a look at take a look at this. So I think they do it in slow motion afterwards. But just watch
1216.80s: where he connects like again, you can tell the difference between somebody who has power, the gift
1221.44s: of power and somebody who doesn't. So the knockout right there super fast can't really tell.
1233.44s: But watch watch when they bring it into slow motion.
1244.64s: So watch where watch where Francis is left hand lands watch.
1253.76s: Objectively that's not a clean hit. That's not where you want to knock somebody out. Objectively
1259.60s: it's not where you want to knock somebody out. You can see it's hard to tell. His fucking head
1264.16s: is experiencing massive whiplash at this precise moment. But you can see he's on the neck
1269.92s: and on the inside of the chin. He's here. That's not a knockout punch for somebody that doesn't have
1275.44s: the power. That is a massive blow debilitating off centering stuff like that. But there was so much
1282.80s: power generated from this dude because he has that gift that if you watch his head, his head snapping
1288.88s: back is what knocked him out. It wasn't this hit up front, which is crazy. Most people know
1294.16s: for like knocking people out, the big thing is to cause massive disruption in the brain, right?
1299.28s: It's like whiplash. That's what will cause it. So if you take a look at the way his head flows,
1305.68s: that that's what knocks him out because he has the force. Head moves back has to abruptly stop at
1313.12s: some point because you run out of literally mobility and that causes a really fast disruption of
1319.28s: your brain. Lights out. Yeah, he's completely asleep there. So that's the fascinating thing because
1328.80s: again, you can tell like some people have power that can do that with a really unclean shot because
1335.36s: they have so much power and then other people do not. And I can I can easily tell you from Mike
1342.72s: when he did connect with Jake, because he didn't even throw that hard when he did. He absolutely
1348.32s: has that power still. Plus as you age, that's way slower to go, which is really interesting. So yeah,
1357.28s: really, really interesting stuff. All right. So Lawrence's brains are important. Yeah, it's something
1364.32s: about the brain doing something or other. I feel like a lot of times my brain betrays me,
1368.56s: but I guess the brain is supposedly supposedly important and does something. I don't know.
1374.56s: Posted to do something they say. All right. So last time we were going through all this different
1381.44s: DD and we got through some of it. Man, we have a lot to go. We have a whole lot to go. So we're
1387.68s: going to have to go through these pretty quick. And if there's one of these though that we click
1393.76s: into, please let me know if it's like a big deal. If it's something that we really need to take some
1400.48s: time on, because what I'm actually going to do is prime up chat GPT to help us out just for the sake
1407.20s: of time. So, but if there's one that you know is like a really good one for whatever reason,
1413.60s: again, tell me so that then we can we can take our time with it. But otherwise, I'm going to
1419.68s: kind of poke through these because again, a lot of this is me building context. That's the that's
1424.48s: the whole goal. I think this thing super cool. All right. So let's see. Okay, this is 842 pages.
1436.16s: Oh, fuck. Oh, this is great. So this is a compilation. This is beautiful. This is exactly what we
1442.80s: need. Diamond hand logo are okay, cool. Oh, this is literally perfect. Hold on, let me move this
1456.88s: out of the way. And then I'm going to move this out of the way as well. And then I'm going to maximize this.
1473.28s: Yeah, this is perfect. I'm stoked that that this exists. I didn't know that this was a thing.
1478.56s: That's fantastic. All right. And then I'll move this over here. Oh, that's good.
1487.68s: I like this. Can't agree. The GameStop short squeeze crisis solved.
1495.20s: Off Poon says, what are the dates on this D.D. after the Jan squeeze? Where does it which D.D.
1501.12s: This one. This one is from 26 May. Does it give us the dates in the beginning? Because that would
1511.60s: actually be kind of cool to see some of the dates. It does. 14 March 18 March 31 6 April May.
1525.36s: So these are not in chronological order. Yeah, it's kind of like shotgun blast order.
1543.36s: But most all I see here after 2021, like after January. Okay.
1555.52s: Can you guys read this? I don't know if it's easier if I read it out to you. If I read it, it's going to take me longer.
1569.60s: Or I can gloss over it. And then highlight stuff that I see. Let me know because as long as you guys
1575.44s: can read it, I'm not going to read the whole thing out loud because it'll it'll slow me down a lot.
1580.24s: And then what I'll do is I'll kind of skim through it quickly and find the stuff that sticks out.
1587.44s: Core intention of this post summarized, Moas.
1591.76s: Not intended to serve as source of proof.
1600.72s: There's a massive amount of research in D.D. that has been performed documented around this
1605.12s: theory can be found here. Okay.
1635.20s: So it looks like the same. This all looks like the same stuff. Let's see.
1654.08s: Okay.
1656.88s: All right. Certain participants in the stock market manipulators take an advantage loophole short sell. So I think we already know this naked shorting. I think we all know this.
1669.92s: Yep. So they got fucked. I think we know. We know all this.
1675.68s: Okay. I think we can skip all this. I think we can skip all this. Oh, let's see.
1682.24s: Okay. Very different from investors, but harder to explain. Yep. They are. Yep. Yep.
1691.76s: Special rules. Yep. Naked shorting is one of them. Yep. Yep. Yep.
1703.84s: This type of trade illegal outside of specific situations involving market.
1708.72s: Market makers do a loophole lack of oversight regulation. Naked short selling can be used to manipulate the prices is all correct.
1715.04s: ynthetic shares. If there's anything in here, again, that you see as I go through it that you're curious about. Let me know.
1720.64s: Otherwise, again, I'm just going to keep. I've learned to speed read. So I normally blast through stuff pretty fast.
1728.48s: But if there's a like any of these topics that you see that you're like, yo, I don't know anything about that. Can we talk about it? Let me know.
1734.64s: I'm synthetic shares are obviously a really important part of this whole thing.
1743.44s: Sean O'Karrel says House of Cards DDS one you should take your time on. This one is very basic for you. Okay. Yeah. Let me know.
1749.68s: Whatever we I'm assuming it's going to be in here. So. And you.
1755.84s: With this kind of thing, if I download it does it go to like a PDF because if it does, that would be that would be next level. Let me see real quick.
1766.80s: I got to put you guys over here for a second so I can move stuff around. Let me download this thing.
1775.84s: It is in PDF.
1777.52s: Aha. This will be much faster too.
1786.00s: Okay.
1789.52s: Let me save this.
1800.24s: Yeah. Okay. I'm stoked. This is great.
1816.16s: All right. Let me grab you guys back over to this screen.
1824.48s: This one. This is cool. So this looks like I can scroll through it. This will be much, much faster. This is fantastic.
1832.88s: I think I have fucking SAP in my hair that don't love.
1855.68s: Yeah. Okay. All that basic stuff we're looking at. All right. Here we are.
1859.28s: Retail market makers and they get shortings and FedEx. Okay.
1872.56s: Margin. That Lauren says SAP is better than Pink Eye. Yeah. You know, thankfully I haven't had Pink Eye since I was like a child because I have a thing called an immune system.
1883.12s: But so that in that context, I'm not sure if SAP is better because it's like, I don't know how to get fucking SAP out of hair though.
1890.08s: I have like, I definitely have some of it back here though. There's there's literally no doubt in my mind, which is unfortunate for me, I believe.
1902.96s: Yeah. We don't necessarily love that. Love that for me.
1907.04s: Oil. What kind of oil? That would be great.
1913.44s: James says put it in notebook LM and make it into a podcast. The problem with something like that would still be slower than my ability to read through this.
1928.72s: This is just all very basics. They're just talking about margin. Here we go. Let's see.
1937.68s: Large, large short position on a stock whose price rapidly increases. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep.
1958.16s: So this I'm actually noticing is kind of conflating two different terms.
1962.24s: Do they. Is this alphabetical these terms? They're not. Damn it. What the fuck went to the alphabetical? You come on guys.
1981.20s: Yeah, this looks a little bit like they're conflating a couple different things. Well, let's see.
1986.48s: What I'm seeing is conflating short squeeze from something like a gamma squeeze, which have different circumstances.
1995.68s: Understanding the difference in those circumstances is actually really, really important.
2002.40s: First, let me see. I think I should be.
2013.04s: No.
2016.48s: I'm trying to sign into the counts because I have a paid version of this and I want to be able to use the AI tool.
2037.52s: Does this work?
2046.24s: What the fuck?
2055.12s: Included with your account.
2063.36s: I think this should be correct.
2065.36s: I know. And then sign it.
2084.32s: So I'm hopeful that if this works, then we can have the AI tool help us.
2095.36s: Okay.
2103.04s: All right. I think we might be okay. We'll give it a go.
2114.16s: Lawrence's coconut oil and let it sit for 10 minutes. Yo, 10 minutes. There's no fucking way.
2119.76s: To sit there and let coconut oil sit my hair for 10 minutes. That's like an impossibility, I think.
2125.36s: It's a nice idea. I'm sure like from a functional standpoint, it absolutely sounds like something that would work.
2133.52s: But from a practical standpoint, I think you are grossly overestimating any shred or semblance of
2141.12s: patients that I might have, which I really have a disease when it comes to patients.
2150.08s: That Lawrence is impossible. That's a bit dramatic. No, no, no, that is the most accurate
2155.36s: description I can think of. It's that is an impossibility. I don't think it can functionally be done
2164.24s: by somebody like me. I just don't see it. Maybe for somebody that's better than I, I could see,
2172.64s: but for somebody like me, there's no way. There's no way. I don't think that that's literally
2179.84s: doable. I think that you're asking me to do something that, yeah, that's that's
2186.88s: undoable. There's no way. I don't have that kind of fucking patience. Again, you have to
2192.56s: you have to understand different people. We have like different strengths and different weaknesses.
2197.44s: And that is not one of my fucking strengths right there. Patience is a virtue that somehow
2205.60s: fucking skipped right over me. And I don't fucking have it. So patience is whatever that is.
2216.72s: All right.
2220.80s: Cedric says put the do rag on and STF use. That's actually probably a good idea. I think,
2227.20s: because then I wouldn't be able to touch it. I think that would actually be the big secret.
2232.48s: All right. So let's see. I want to know. I've never used the AI tool for this. So I don't know
2239.52s: exactly how it works. I wonder if I can ask it to summarize a section.
2250.40s: Yeah, this is all basic stuff. So I'm going to just fly through here.
2254.48s: Get to the first one.
2256.24s: Yep. So this this is talking about the mechanics of a short squeeze, which I think everybody here
2265.04s: is appraised of. Again, if there's something that you're unfamiliar with, let me know. And then
2269.60s: I will slow down and describe it and discuss it with you.
2276.24s: Is the squeeze squos? No.
2279.52s: I mean, why would they say no?
2288.64s: Is it always no in the expect when when we say is the squeeze squos, they simply mean it can happen
2294.88s: again. Yeah. Because one of the like one of the realities here is the depth of a future squeeze.
2304.64s: It very likely will look a lot different than what this one historically looked like,
2310.72s: which I'm not sure if that's being fully accounted for here by people. But
2320.40s: again, the answers up to you short sellers likely needed every share to cover the position.
2325.36s: A lot of me says they mean it hasn't happened yet. Okay. So that was the following. So
2329.60s: I see. Okay. So Lauren says it wasn't a squeeze. It was a sneeze in my last
2335.84s: days tomorrow. Okay. So then the prevailing hypothesis is that what happened in 21 was a smaller
2344.48s: version of what's expected to come. Is that correct?
2348.32s: Not a true squeeze until synthetics are forced to cover.
2364.48s: Well, is that I don't understand that definition?
2368.80s: Okay. So Jan 21 was a sneeze. And again, just making sure I understand when we say sneeze
2380.96s: in this context, we just mean it was like a small squeeze like it wasn't, wasn't as big as it needed to be.
2390.88s: Don't care. It says, yeah, basically, the believe that short hedge funds figured out a way to
2394.56s: hide short positions and swaps and never close. I think that's true. Like I've seen evidence of that
2399.12s: for sure. It would have been a squeeze, but was halted. Okay. Got it. Now, help me reconcile this
2411.28s: then if this, if the squeeze that happened is considered a sneeze, this sounds like a fucking
2419.36s: doctor sues book. If the squeeze is considered a sneeze, I don't know how to keep rhyming that,
2425.12s: but if that squeeze was considered a sneeze that was halted, right? There was direct
2432.56s: intervention by market forces to stop it. What's the premise then that the next squeeze would
2441.28s: actually be a squeeze versus being halted again by market forces?
2449.84s: Renegate Trader says wishful thinking.
2462.08s: I'm in pressure.
2474.88s: But I think SM, I think time and pressure doesn't matter, right? Because if we look at the previous
2482.00s: instance, there was obviously enough time and pressure that would have propelled price much higher,
2487.76s: but then there was an artificial intervention. So the only way that I could conceivably see an
2495.68s: argument being posed by somebody that would be logical would be that they think conditions
2502.24s: are different that would lead to markets not intervening. But I don't see why we would think
2512.96s: that that would be the case because we know from the original sneeze that the market was literally
2520.32s: concerned about composite, total market viability. So I don't see why anybody would think that we
2532.80s: would be less inclined as an institution, again, taking the other side's perspective, less inclined
2538.72s: as an institution to stop in occurrence of that again. I don't get that.
2554.24s: I'm just getting caught up. Vladimir says who was buying 480 per share on 27 Jan 21? Crazy.
2561.36s: It's crazy. But again, if you're going into this thing not knowing that it's about to be
2566.56s: intervened with a squeeze like that literally can double again. So even for somebody that gets
2572.16s: in at 480, that doesn't mean that you can't get out for a fucking thousand. So the people that
2578.32s: would be doing that are the people who are a bit late to the party, but they're doing the trading
2582.88s: game of buying high looking to sell higher. I don't hate them at all. The people that the people that
2591.84s: bought it 480, they got fucked because of a rug pole because the market then decided like,
2599.04s: no, we're not letting this go on anymore. We're done here. And that fucking sucks.
2606.16s: WETDC says less needed more could be. The premise is based on what would happen if hall
2612.24s: of the regulatory requirements were enforced against more participants rather than locking retail out.
2618.00s: Yeah, no, I get that, but I still the part that I'm not understanding here is if we're expecting
2624.56s: a bigger squeeze in the future and the last squeeze was cut short because of the total impact
2632.32s: it might have had on the financial system. Why do we think that the future squeeze is going
2639.52s: to be bigger than the previous squeeze that was smaller and still cut short?
2646.96s: I'm trying to understand that as you can tell, my heart's out in the open here, I'm trying to
2652.96s: understand because from a logical perspective, I just don't understand how that racquetsyles.
2662.88s: Sean says prolonged squeeze like Tesla. That's not a squeeze though.
2666.40s: So what Tesla has done is appreciated and value as a company. They've become more valuable.
2673.28s: That's completely different than a squeeze.
2684.16s: The squeeze may not be bigger, but the run may be longer. I see.
2689.12s: I see. Okay. So then that said, Drake says 100% Tesla was a squeeze. What move in Tesla,
2699.84s: you guys talking about? I don't know actually what time frame or reference. What time frame
2706.88s: were referencing.
2719.76s: Tesla is short inches from 2016 until they ran up. Okay, got it. So we're talking older Tesla.
2733.52s: I thought you were talking about something more recent. Yeah. Well, I also think there's a
2737.28s: couple news articles about that, right? Because there was definitely series of shorts must use to
2743.20s: dunk on people about that, which I always thought was entertaining. So you're just talking about
2748.72s: like a standard short squeeze though. Like you get when you're talking about the Tesla in those
2753.84s: time frames, we're not talking about this idea of like, Mellaz or anything. Is that correct?
2764.08s: I'm trying to understand the context here.
2767.60s: Mike says, well, GameStop is in a better position and wider base investors are choosing to buy
2771.44s: more buying pressure along with short covering could be huge. I see. I see. Okay. So,
2776.96s: said, Drake, you're just saying that, yeah, so that's why I'm confused with the comparison to Tesla.
2783.44s: Because Tesla had like very normal short squeezes. They weren't like the movement that you saw in
2789.68s: Tesla was like pretty textbook short squeeze like older school if we're talking like mid 20s slash.
2795.52s: I think there was also what in 2020. I want to say that there was
2803.12s: another instance of a squeeze there as well. So, but Tesla to me would be an example of just like
2812.64s: standard squeeze falls off rolls up.
2816.24s: So,
2820.24s: said, Drake says it wasn't Mellaz because they had time to exit the shorts. Yeah, well,
2823.20s: and that's kind of the nature, right? Of short squeezes because they happen. And that's why it's
2827.44s: called a short squeeze. And again, like a short squeeze is different than a gamma squeeze,
2832.48s: which is really important to differentiate between them. Because a short squeeze still typically
2839.44s: reconciles and it's not being fueled inherently by market maker.
2850.08s: Sean says this is the debate, I think. Some people believe in the fairy tales of one million
2854.08s: per share, but I think most people regularly just think something akin to Tesla.
2858.88s: But so then so then Sean, in that example, then most people you would by that position, you
2872.64s: would say like most regular people aren't then gunning for Mellaz. Most people are just
2877.68s: gunning for like a future short squeeze reminiscent to what GameStop is already experienced.
2883.84s: Is that correct?
2888.56s: Impulsive says seriously, watch the fear in his eyes. Thomas Petrifi said it would Mellaz.
2894.88s: Yeah, definitely. Petrifi talked about the total systemic risk, which was no joke there.
2901.76s: Sean says yes, but it sustained highs.
2905.84s: I don't that's the part I don't understand because by its nature, a squeeze, whether it's a
2911.92s: short squeeze or gamma squeeze is temporary. Squeezes don't persist into perpetuity.
2919.04s: It's a it's a functional constraint that exists.
2932.80s: Lawrence says can a short squeeze turn into gamma squeeze or vice versa? Definitely.
2937.44s: So short squeezes and gamma squeezes absolutely have interplay, no doubt.
2942.32s: And the interplay can literally be violent between short squeezes and gamma squeezes.
2947.28s: So what 100% 100% happened?
2952.56s: I'm going to stretch this and then I think I can even zoom in a little bit for us.
2962.64s: I see.
2967.04s: Okay.
2969.20s: So that's man, that's like tricky to get my arms around.
2973.04s: So let me let me know if I got this right. There are some people who are searching for Moas,
2982.16s: which is like financial system breaking almost level of short gamma squeeze, whatever.
2988.88s: Massive price movement. That's one bucket. Then there's another bucket of people
2995.20s: who are looking for what we would consider to be like more standard short squeezes.
3002.16s: And then there's another bucket of people and not saying that they're discrete, there might be
3006.16s: overlap. And then there's another bucket of people who genuinely like the company long term,
3013.04s: the story of the company, the turnaround perspective and stuff like that. And then there's
3017.92s: like the third bucket there. Is that correct? So there's a bit of a diverse view. It's the background
3030.40s: here. Okay. Got it. That's super helpful. I'm just trying to, I'm trying to frame everything in my mind.
3039.76s: And
3043.76s: chicken nuggets says we all want Moas, but when you think about reality, you understand that can happen. I see. Okay.
3050.00s: All right. Cool. Thank you. That's super, super helpful. I know sometimes I ask a lot of fucking stupid questions,
3055.76s: but I like to understand things at their core. It helps me a lot.
3061.84s: Um, one is the squeeze. Nobody knows. Here you go. Why just holding do anything? So here's my next
3069.20s: question. With the recent at the market offerings and now in abundance of shares, how does this impact
3081.92s: this this idea of holding? And then I have a secondary question, which is
3089.60s: if we're holding, where's the where's the exit that isn't stepping on one another to get out the door?
3102.88s: Because the only way to realize the money from a squeeze is to sell at some point. And then as
3110.24s: that selling starts to occur and cascades into future selling, that pushes price down.
3119.20s: Of Vladimir says, D. R. S. works against a short squeeze. You want higher short interest. I don't.
3135.76s: I don't see that the same. I see your point, but one of the one of the important parts,
3144.08s: specifically about like a really aggressive short or gamma squeeze is share availability.
3153.28s: So if you're making it impossible for people to tap shares to move around, it decreases total
3161.20s: liquidity. Sean says, I think some people hold this stock as a form of protest almost. Yeah. I mean,
3171.28s: I already told you guys the shares that I hold is literally just to it's literally just to support
3176.40s: the the ape movement. Like I just want to show the ape some love because I think what they're doing
3180.88s: is really interesting. Yolo rollo says D. R. S. takes shares off exchange so they can't short though.
3196.08s: Yeah. If you're not synthetic shorting, right? If you're synthetic shorting, then you're still
3200.48s: shorting. But more importantly than that, it requires less short interest to have the same short
3208.32s: interest ratio because there's less availability. Again, there's there's a relationship there.
3218.64s: So. So let me let me simplify my first question.
3226.40s: For the ape community is holding right now as it sits today, like a cornerstone
3234.32s: element of the strategy. Like is that still a really important part of the the ape movement where
3243.52s: people are buying and D. R. S. shares is that still at the same magnitude?
3249.04s: Yes. Okay. Got it. So that's still a big push. What do we know what percent of the float is
3259.92s: currently locked up? And then let me I gotta go grab another mango orange. I'll be right back.
3308.64s: Right.
3328.56s: Yeah, there's a hundred and sixteen people in here. Shout out to you guys. Thanks for helping me
3334.00s: learn about this. By the way, I'm I genuinely am appreciative. Okay. So it looks like 25%
3341.36s: you guys are saying is D. R. S. So of the 25% then that's D. R. S.
3347.28s: Is there like a target a target percentage that is been identified as like a critical point?
3358.24s: What does this thing do? Edit PDF, copy, or dact right through an online highlight.
3374.40s: A hundred percent. A hundred percent would be no good. I don't think that would be good at all.
3381.92s: Why would you guys want a hundred percent? Wait, so you guys are saying it was a hundred percent
3390.00s: that was, you know, I'm fucking confused. There's a lot of different stuff flying around. So
3400.32s: impulsive is saying purpose of D. R. S. was to prove synthetic shares, which that I think it did.
3406.80s: And then we're saying that it's to lock the float.
3421.84s: All of Putin's talking about Cohen's legacy, which that's interesting because I have no idea how
3427.92s: anybody has any idea what anybody's legacy is is preferred or expected.
3439.84s: Lock the float. Okay. Interesting. Super, super interesting.
3447.44s: Are you guys manipulating the market? Yes. By doing this, it is manipulating the market.
3452.96s: There's a lot of misinformation flying around. No, we are not. What the fuck do you mean you're not?
3463.36s: This suburb is in no way a form of market. We aren't we aren't the ones manipulating the market.
3482.32s: How is this the perspective?
3491.76s: Jotatus's apes aren't manipulating the market. But how?
3498.56s: If the idea is to lock up all the flow and control the float in an effort to force or drive a squeeze,
3512.48s: is that not manipulating the market?
3520.96s: I see. So this.
3529.68s: I see. So you guys, based on what I'm seeing, people are leaning on the fact that there's not
3536.56s: a directive.
3544.08s: Okay. So this looks like people know they are, but they're trying to find like a way to be able
3553.36s: to deny allegations as they should.
3559.12s: Cedric says, can I hide my and manipulate the market?
3562.08s: Abs of fucking looting. Abs of fucking looting. 100%. You don't even need a hive mind.
3568.80s: If you're trading something that's low enough flow, you can have a few friends do it.
3577.84s: I see. So you guys are.
3580.32s: I see. I see. I see. I see. Okay. So this makes way more sense. I think it looks like people are
3587.68s: looking at this in a negative connotation of manipulating the market as a negative connotation,
3594.24s: which I understand now.
3598.24s: Cedric says you ain't going to lock up millions of apes. It's not about that. It's not about that
3602.72s: at all. You can try to find the worst offenders, so to speak. And go after them if they were so inclined.
3610.16s: Sean says market manipulation is illegal. Yes. Well, let's actually look up the definition.
3618.16s: I'm curious. Research the definition of market manipulation, because I'm looking at market
3627.60s: manipulation in the, not in a legal sense here. I'm looking at it in a practical sense,
3634.56s: right? Like the idea of trying to cause a squeeze is manipulating the market from again,
3639.84s: like a practical sense, because it's creating conditions that are favorable for a otherwise
3647.12s: generally unnatural market movement to occur. So it's manufactured that kind of thing.
3653.84s: I don't, the way that I'm laying that out is not in any way trying to paint it as a bad
3662.00s: context. I don't think that's bad. I actually think it's fucking smart. It's like, it's other people
3667.52s: manipulate, like institutions manipulate that everybody manipulate the market as much as they
3672.00s: possibly can. So I don't think it's a bad thing. I just think from a, from a technical perspective,
3678.72s: it's exactly what it is. Now I understand from the legal perspective, though, this makes a lot of
3685.52s: sense. So I'm trying to look up the actual SEC definitions of market manipulation so that
3694.48s: I understand this. When someone artificially affects supply and demand for security,
3706.08s: artificial, what does this mean? This is not, this is not that, that doesn't apply.
3716.32s: That doesn't apply. That doesn't apply. So based on investor.gov, their, their
3725.76s: context for market manipulation, none of this applies. Yeah, this doesn't, this doesn't look
3734.72s: like it applies at all. So let me look up one other thing really quick. Research, cases of
3746.00s: market manipulation. I want to look research tried cases. I'm going to look at trial specifically.
3761.84s: Because this looks like they generally are targeting like not retail at all. This looks like,
3769.12s: this looks like it's really, let's let's actually search for that.
3775.52s: Here we go. Here. So our K-gos, we know that. We know that Citroen got fucked, thankfully, good.
3788.32s: Two former traders at JP Morgan were convicted of engaging multi-year market manipulation scheme.
3795.12s: Okay. Yep. So they were spoofing and stuff. Yep. So that's still at an institutional level.
3803.28s: So these dudes.
3809.44s: Yep. So this absolutely looks like standard. Yeah. So like, I think, I think from like a fundamental
3819.20s: perspective, what apes are trying to do is manipulate the price, but I think from a legal
3825.44s: definition, nothing in here looks like it even remotely applies to the eight movement.
3831.60s: So this, I understand, I understand much more, I think now.
3836.48s: Citroen says things been real quiet about left super sus. Well, I think it's because this trial
3840.48s: was moved out by a year and he naturally isn't going to talk about it because it literally is
3846.48s: just detrimental for him to talk about it. It raises his risk considerably. So if for somebody
3853.36s: that's going through litigation, they're, they're just going to shut the fuck up as they should
3857.84s: if they're smart. And he probably has decent legal counsel.
3864.16s: Citroen says in why roaring city, roaring kitty is not manipulating because he never said to buy
3868.96s: anything. Well, not just that, but roaring, roaring kitty doesn't say shit other than his
3874.56s: fucking opinion or what he's doing. I don't think that's manipulating at all. I think again,
3881.52s: there's from a functional perspective of reality behind he has to know when he tweets things about
3890.88s: GameStop or when he posts about GameStop, GameStop goes up. He has to know that. But I don't think
3898.08s: that that means he's manipulating things. He absolutely can cause GameStop to move.
3907.20s: But Sean says, but the media were talking about him and E-Trade threatened to kick him off.
3911.60s: E-Trade discussed it, but I don't think they made any threats to kick him off. I think they
3917.04s: discussed it. And I don't think that they were kicking him off under the premise of,
3923.12s: under the premise of him manipulating the stock. I think that they probably for a litany of
3931.60s: different reasons just thought there was more risk in having him as a client.
3941.44s: So yeah,
3944.40s: I'm posted sometimes he posts, he posts, he posts, he and I'm saying GameStop goes up. What is
3947.44s: he supposed to do? Yeah, well, and that's the thing, right? It's like him as a personality, he's been
3953.68s: really,
3957.04s: really tightly associated with the ticker. So yeah, Sean says there's CNBC having debates in may
3965.52s: about him manipulating the market. Wait, really? I have to look at I did not know that.
3971.84s: I have to look at that. That's crazy.
3977.28s: What do we do? CNBC, CNBC,
3991.20s: what would the do you know what I should search for?
3995.28s: What the CNBC,
4006.32s: roaring kitty market manipulation.
4010.72s: All right. So you already know we have to do it through closed captions. We found our loophole.
4033.84s: All right, let's see.
4040.64s: So this looks good so far. I just need to speed it up because it's moving at like a glacial pace.
4055.60s: Didn't seem to be anything that would be big red flag for regulators.
4062.00s: There's going to be a massive wall of text that's going to pop up. She's saying a lot of words
4065.92s: and nothing is popping up. Many, many experience in not telling people what to do,
4073.92s: discussing his personal opinion, doesn't give regulators wiggle room to label them as a minute. Yeah,
4079.12s: that's exactly correct. So this, this looks fine. This doesn't look like they're debating that he is.
4088.24s: Well, since dude, you need to watch his last dream when he returned and had like 600 people
4092.08s: watching him. Oh, I watch, we watched that a bunch of times. I'm not sure if you're new to the
4097.28s: new to the series here full send. But yeah, we spent a while looking at that stream because it's hilarious.
4106.00s: It certainly seemed to lay it out. Shows you his holding. Shows you quite a lot of ground
4110.64s: on the stock went down to if anything. What he's doing is now sending up the perfect defense
4114.64s: for market manipulation, giving regulators everything he would use in his defense if they brought
4119.28s: up a market manipulation. Up to me, they're trying to do, I think ban him.
4123.36s: A very high bar to reach ban him from ever being able to trade again. I think so. That would be
4127.28s: the only outcome if you were charged with market manipulation seeking a lifetime ban. Try to get
4132.64s: him out of the market completely. You see what each trade is doing. They're unhappy. However,
4138.88s: or get in the best press they've ever gotten there. Their information is also single thing he posts.
4145.44s: So they should be happy right now in a good position as well. Readvertising. Yep.
4152.40s: Yeah, this looks okay.
4156.48s: Still a lot of active retail trading. Wall Street people, he said they want people involved in
4160.24s: trading. What do you think of the brand retail trading? Fantastic. The first time individual
4164.48s: investors are out there in front learning from people. Memes stocks could be an SEC rule on
4168.24s: Memes stocks. Don't like that. Retail traders or investors are finally getting the market
4172.16s: understanding what's going on. Opinion trading their own money. Great for the market. Wall Street
4178.48s: wants retail doing it now. Wall Street's doing it having fun too.
4186.40s: This looks okay so far. This is saying you don't want a bag. You want retail holding the bag.
4193.68s: Wall Street is rigged for years and years. Retail investors could never true. With these
4197.76s: types of Memes stocks, key kill particularly everything is public. Perfect.
4204.00s: Something else just crashed on my other screen. Receiving retail investors act very differently
4208.96s: from how they did back in 21. React into the positions you're showing and holding and affirming
4215.44s: is holding what what's the market supposed to do. How much of it those different from what day
4219.44s: traders were back in the late 90s. Really 2000s. It's one thing to be an investor another to be a
4225.20s: trader. So far this looks fine.
4240.88s: Yeah so you're seeing that regulators are looking at Keith Gill and trying to find a rule that
4244.88s: doesn't exist to control the market. Yeah that looks okay. Sean says the point is why is it even a
4251.52s: discussion? It's a fair discussion. I think it's a completely fair discussion.
4257.28s: Because again like even though Keith isn't telling anybody directly to do anything, there
4263.76s: is a known. It's kind of like if I'm driving a car and I hit somebody and they die. Hopefully
4272.64s: it doesn't happen. But in that scenario I could just say well I didn't know that they were going to
4277.76s: die when I hit them. Maybe I hit them going really slow but maybe when they fall they hit their
4283.04s: head and then die. The point I'm making and this is a very loose example to draw the correlation
4288.96s: though is that there's a reality that when we're in Kitty posts, we can generally assume
4298.24s: GameStop is going to go up. Generally assume. Now I think what is clear from his perspective though
4306.64s: is it's not like he's unwinding every time the move happens. So as long as like he's still
4317.20s: shooting straight, keeping it real then I see absolutely nothing wrong with what he's doing at all.
4322.32s: Ben says if you were him, would you retire the Twitter handles and other social media stuff? No
4326.48s: fuck no. I absolutely would not. Because again I don't think he's doing anything wrong. I think
4331.28s: the one thing I would continue to do is like here's another reality. When he disappears for
4338.64s: prolonged periods and then pops back up randomly, that sends GameStop reeling. If he was even remotely
4347.68s: consistent with his posting, then the market would essentially have no effect. There would be
4353.36s: realistically no effect because a lot of times when he bounces and then comes back people then
4360.72s: go into a fervor about it. So yeah, I don't think you should retire anything. I don't think he's
4369.12s: I don't think he's doing anything illegal at all. Like I said, I'm not saying that I'm just saying
4373.84s: that the conversation is reasonable. I'm not saying I don't agree with it whatsoever. I think that
4378.80s: there's absolutely rightfully so. There's no grounds at all to accuse him of anything which is
4385.68s: exactly why they haven't. There's a reason why they've tried to investigate him. And I know
4390.80s: that he was investigated in a state. But again, investigation is different than being tried or accused.
4400.56s: Those are slightly different things. So yeah, I don't think he's doing anything wrong whatsoever.
4406.00s: I think he's literally just a dude talking about a stock that he's liked that he's liked for a
4410.48s: really long fucking time and sharing what he's doing. I don't see anything wrong with that at all.
4416.88s: Sean says fair enough his old employer got fine for his behavior. Yeah, definitely. And his
4422.88s: again, like he broke the rules when when he was actively trading at that point, he broke the terms
4430.64s: of what his company allowed him to do. So like in that circumstance, Keith was wrong.
4439.12s: His company was wrong. The reason why they were fine is because they should have found it and
4444.16s: stopped him. They also found that there's other people doing similar shit, other people operating
4449.04s: without the licensure that they needed and stuff like that. So like their internal regulations
4454.64s: just sucked. But like in that in that circumstance, Keith was wrong. He broke the rules laid out by
4460.16s: his company. His company ended up paying the price for it, which is fuck them. I don't care. But
4465.76s: that's that's absolutely fair. W A T D C the terms he broke were that he was teaching regular
4472.96s: people what he knew. That's that's not it. Again, you guys already know like my my goal and all
4478.80s: of this is objective truth. It's not opinion. It's not skew. And the terms he broke absolutely were
4485.44s: not teaching people what he knew. The terms he broke were violating what securities he was allowed
4492.24s: to transact in. Most people like when I worked at Deloitte, there's different rules that are
4497.60s: applied to you when you're in different kinds of businesses. So absolutely. So if we look at
4506.32s: Keith Gill, where did he work? It was like something American. I fucking I can't remember. You
4512.64s: guys will know. What's the I don't remember it at all. What's the name of the place that he worked
4516.88s: at though? Mass mutual. Is that right? I thought I had like American in it for some reason. I don't
4524.48s: know why. Maybe I'm just fucking patriotic as shit. That could be it. Mass mutual. Okay, cool. So let
4532.56s: me look that up. In the meantime, I got to get my dinner order off. We're going to do I towel. Yeah.
4541.12s: Okay. So Keith Gill, mass mutual. I'm just going to put like violation. Here we go. And I
4553.36s: remember this is from like Rooters. And then we found this one as well. Because we've looked at
4560.48s: these before. Settlements conducted. Who's relentless cheering for GameStop, part of a meme
4569.12s: stock mania state officials who resigned in January failed to adequately supervise his and other
4575.20s: agents trading an online activity. So this is the rule that he broke. He would have had an
4582.16s: employer's agreement with mass mutual worth mass mutual. What have told him you cannot do
4587.76s: XYZ in terms of securities. This is why for people that work at ETF funds. I have a friend of mine.
4596.32s: I was actually talking with them about maybe trying to try to work with them. Because I think
4600.00s: it would be really cool to learn more about that business. And anyways, one of the things he told
4605.92s: me is like, well, if you work here, you can't you can't trade. And I was just like.
4612.00s: Like that sounds great. Cool place. Cool people. But like that. So like that it's very common in
4621.28s: any sort of financial industry for that to be a constraint. And it's for conflicts of interest.
4627.12s: So anyways, going back to the original question from Sean, which is what was it? This is what it was.
4633.28s: He violated the employment agreement with mass mutual. He was trading things that he shouldn't have
4637.76s: been trading. And mass mutual should have caught it earlier and stopped it. But they didn't. So
4642.80s: that's why mass mutual got fucked. So yeah.
4651.92s: W T D C sorry, Fraser Ron because regular people were able to follow him. It got noticed.
4657.76s: No, it's it's because it just got big. It didn't have anything to do with other people's involvement.
4664.00s: It's because he literally became a fucking celebrity. So it's like the reason why they like I
4670.08s: wouldn't even be surprised if they didn't if they knew and they didn't really care.
4676.40s: But it got so big that they were made to care because everybody knew about Keith Gill and
4682.40s: Roy and Kitty. He literally became a celebrity. He became like in your face. So then everybody was
4690.32s: just like, Oh, who's this guy? What's his background? What does he do? And that's exactly how I got
4696.64s: funneled back to it. It had everything to do with just his him literally becoming a celebrity.
4704.80s: And he had compliance constraints from his job that he violated. Like, yeah, nothing to do with
4709.28s: other people following him. It had everything to do with his popularity, which is again, it's very
4717.36s: cool. It's like really neat earned popularity. But Sean says why why wasn't he liable? That's
4725.68s: kind of the cool part is because it's a corporate policy. So his job could have chosen to try to
4733.28s: pursue him, but they found it easier not and they just accepted their fault because again,
4739.44s: it's also not Keith's fault that mass mutual wasn't doing their fucking job. Mass mutual
4745.76s: should have absolutely had systems in place to check and to stop that kind of behavior. So mass
4753.12s: mutual was at fault for the behavior and as you can tell it wasn't just him. There was other people
4759.04s: that were involved. I'm trying to see, oh, was it on this one?
4773.92s: This that it failed to supervise its agents among the social media, right? So there's other people
4780.88s: that are involved in that process. So they're the employment agreement between he and mass
4787.36s: obviously would have been terminated. I don't know if he got fired or if he left. But yeah,
4792.72s: my guess is one of those would have occurred there. So that's his quote unquote punishment
4798.08s: from his job. And then mass mutual because they weren't compliant in their
4804.16s: monitoring of compliance. They're also a problem. So yeah.
4811.20s: WATDC says he became a celebrity in the average person was learning to trade. We're saying the same
4815.60s: thing. Yeah, we're saying the exact same thing there. But again, the thing that you say in the
4819.68s: beginning is different, right? You're saying the terms he broke where that he was teaching regular
4825.52s: people what he knew. That's not that's not the terms he broke. There's nothing in here that says
4831.28s: Keith Gale can't teach other people what he knows. There's nothing in here that says Keith Gale
4835.60s: can't start a YouTube channel and teach people about trading. He can do both of those things
4840.24s: completely fine. The terms he broke were him trading. Then his rise into popularity is what got
4852.56s: that noticed. But it's not his rise in popularity either. That's not a term that he broke.
4861.04s: So yeah, they're just they're different things. WATDC says you're right. I made that statement
4866.08s: in frustration and I totally understand that. I totally understand that. That's why I take the
4870.72s: time to talk about these things though because I know that a lot of people in the GME community are
4875.28s: like just really burnt out, tired, frustrated and stuff like that, which I understand. I really
4881.36s: do understand. But yeah, again, like my position on most things is to do my absolute best at
4890.40s: analyzing things objectively. I can have and I do have opinions, but the opinion is in a separate
4896.96s: bucket than the analysis. The analysis is what it is. And remaining as objective as humanly
4903.44s: possible, I think is super important. We're all riddled with bias, but it's easy. So this is super
4909.84s: interesting though. All right. So we got through the market manipulation component
4921.04s: and there's this. All right. So I think we can get through this. How are these crazy high share
4933.60s: prices that people say possible? This is cool. No one knows how high the squeeze could take the
4938.56s: stock price. The best rational reason says that these numbers are possible through the laws of
4942.48s: supply and demand. Furthermore, it's likely that a short percentage is a lot higher than reported.
4948.16s: See, this is interesting. This is interesting because
4963.12s: this is a incomplete analysis, right? Realistically speaking, the reason why it's an incomplete
4971.28s: analysis is because they're talking about the underlying function that could lead it, lead to it,
4978.40s: which is completely fair, but this misses, this is like a theoretical perspective. It's not a
4984.88s: practical perspective. And the reason why that matters again is the impact to the broad market
4991.44s: still has to be considered, which is essentially exactly what happened. So then what is your short
4999.28s: squeeze? We know this. Let's see. Basically, a bunch of institutions think a stock will fail, pile in,
5005.68s: more often than not, they do not make a lot of money. Go and notice short squeeze can occur.
5013.20s: Yep, that's, that's all fine. More than 100, we know that because that's straight fucking trash.
5021.04s: Why games stop? Here we go. Short squeeze can happen anywhere. There is short interest. Game stop,
5026.16s: however, is special case. Short sellers got extra greedy. They were sure that Game Stop was going to die.
5035.04s: So sure, in fact, they began selling naked short, the stock like crazy. The other thing to know
5040.24s: about this kind of thing is part of seller boxing, which I don't necessarily think is fully what
5046.32s: got into place here. I think they were probably going down that path. But the really interesting
5051.60s: thing here from my perspective is that there's a massive tax benefit. So if I'm shorting something
5057.68s: that ends up going bankrupt, I literally get a tax benefit on the position as it's closed,
5063.60s: which is huge. When you're talking in the millions and millions of dollars, the tax benefit
5068.72s: itself can save you quite literally millions of fucking dollars. So this is incredible to me. And this
5075.76s: is a really great point for them to call out. Naked shorting, I think we already know what they
5082.96s: is. Who's Ryan Cohen? Yep. Chairman of Game Stop. I think we know. Clearly believes in Game Stop to
5090.80s: the point. Well, the other thing to know about Ryan Cohen from what I've seen is that he absolutely
5095.12s: is a bit of an activist investor, right? He he's talked about this before and he from what I've
5100.80s: researched, he has a pension for looking for stuff like this and trying to intervene. So I also
5108.00s: think that he just embodies the approach of an activist investor, not quite a Bill Ackman
5115.84s: because Bill Ackman and Warren Buffett have a slightly different approach, I think, but very
5120.40s: similar in terms of like what this is. So yeah, I think this is also really cool.
5125.20s: Yeah.
5125.92s: Yeah.
5127.20s: Oh, here we go. And why do people keep calling me that? What is a shell? And why do people keep calling me
5136.72s: that? Here we go. One of the many things that hedge funds have tried to do to curb stomp retail
5142.96s: investors is flooding our public communities with reddit accounts. Purposely spreading some negative
5149.44s: sentiment. Now, okay, that's what I was going to ask the proof. These accounts have been seen
5155.68s: all over not just reddit, but also YouTube Twitter, not just conventional social media.
5162.80s: Anywhere you could talk about GME, the term shell is a blanket term for those accounts,
5167.12s: them, bots are people. Do we have do we have evidence of this? Like is there a thing that links to like
5174.48s: negative comment and perceived bot account? I'm super, super interested in that.
5183.20s: Because this I fully agree and I think that this is absolutely also because if you think of it
5187.76s: from a hedge funds perspective, if a hedge fund or some sort of institution has tons of money
5194.96s: that's being threatened because people are starting to pool together and you want to try to
5199.20s: disrupt that, then you can pay people cheap, cheap to go on and start posting all sorts of
5207.52s: shit. So I absolutely, absolutely would believe that they would do this. No doubt.
5219.04s: So I'm just curious if we have, if there's like a library of like actual accounts where it's like
5225.84s: somebody says some reckless shit and it's like an account that's brand new and the only thing
5229.76s: they have in their profile is like two shitty comments towards game stop or something like that.
5234.64s: Because to me, that would be clear as day, right? If you have accounts that are like that.
5242.48s: John says thousands of accounts signing on simultaneously. Yeah, like, right. That's clearly like a
5248.32s: fucking farm. So yeah, I'm just curious. Cedric says, send a link for Reddit. Let's take a look.
5257.36s: Where'd you send it? I do not see it. Oh, you can't, I don't see the link in the chat. The chat
5269.84s: scrubs links for whatever reason. I don't know why. It's super annoying. But
5274.64s: W-A-T-D-C says we started doing that, but it also per per to doxing of real people in
5281.44s: causing them harm. I see. Yeah, that sucks. That sucks. Yeah. All right. So,
5291.60s: shills have utilized different approaches. Fud. Yep. Please, unless you really are a
5297.36s: shill, don't take it personally. So this is good to know too, because they're identifying that
5304.40s: there's a lot of people getting caught with strays. Short and distort time. Yep. You have
5312.80s: shill-based fun and how to spot it. Here we go. Note your potential bias. That's great.
5320.48s: Not all fun is invalid. Some bring up a solid point against otherwise great D-D. That could scare you.
5327.92s: This is great too. Remember just because you don't like what someone is saying, does it make
5331.04s: it invalid? That's massive. I love that. I actually don't think that most people do that based
5336.80s: on what I've seen, but I love that as a guiding force. That's huge. Shooting this person down
5344.16s: as the shill asks yourself the following, are they making a valid point? Is it backed up with
5347.76s: evidence? Have I fact checked this evidence? Those are great questions too. This is great.
5352.32s: I love this. That's really, really good.
5357.92s: W-A-T-D-C says shill isn't used correctly anymore. It gets applied when people disagree.
5361.68s: Yeah. That's, I kind of guess that.
5370.16s: All right. Here we go. How do I set a retail stand-of-chance against hedge funds? Here we go.
5379.12s: Back up in terms of shares held. All short, floats, numbering around. One of the things to know,
5383.28s: by the way, is that your job as a retail trader is not to stand against a hedge fund.
5388.56s: There's no reason for that to be the case. You don't have to.
5396.00s: I see. So this is the sensitivity to weir. Us, again, separating manipulation from the
5402.24s: technical aspects from the legal aspects. I understand that now. Hedge funds in terms. This is cool.
5408.96s: Wow. That was really enlightening for me. A lot of interesting things. Thank you guys for a lot
5414.96s: of the information. Being able to query and understand some of the broader context is really,
5421.20s: really helpful. It's possible we're living in a completely fraudulent system. That's funny.
5430.16s: Citadel has no clothes. It has been fine 58 times for violating stuff. Several instances,
5435.44s: documents, it's with full naked shorting. We know. I don't think we need to read this one through.
5443.20s: Oh, okay. So this is a great DD. Got it. Okay. Never mind. So we will read this one all the way through.
5448.88s: This looked to me to be pretty well known.
5458.56s: All right. Fuck. Did it not? Oh, I was going to say that's going to piss me off.
5465.44s: I'm going to say that's going to piss me off.
5469.44s: Summarize the highlighted section.
5477.44s: Sure. Take all my fucking data. I'm sure.
5487.44s: Oh, you bastard. Let me just go to fucking chat GPT.
5496.32s: Summarize all key point. I'm going to drop it into perplexity as well just to see what perplexity comes up with.
5519.60s: All right. So key points summary here. I'll pull it over here for you guys.
5526.00s: Key points summary. Citadel find a bunch of times. I think we know.
5532.08s: Increasing short positions. Yep. Trading practices and data. Yep.
5541.44s: Fair accounting. Yeah. So this is. Yeah. This is just saying that Citadel does exactly what you
5548.32s: would expect Citadel to do, which is fucking straight bullshit. Also fun fact, the summary that
5556.96s: chat GPT gave me is light years better than what perplexity gave me.
5565.92s: Perplexity is just kind of like good for searching for stuff. It's not really good for stuff like
5571.12s: this I've learned. All right. So that's the overview. We can kill AI assistant because clearly it's
5580.40s: not going to help us. And then let me zoom this in just a little bit more for you guys. All right.
5586.32s: And then I'm told sold not yet purchased sold not not yet.
5601.92s: Yo, Adobe get your shit together. What the fuck?
5614.56s: Impulsive. Do you know where it is? Because apparently I can't fucking search for the terms.
5620.80s: It says it's not in here. That's so annoying. Unless you're giving me bad scoop and it's not
5632.40s: called that then it's not annoying and you're annoying because you're fucking sending me down a
5637.12s: goat rope for some shit that's not there. If that's not the case of first three images. Okay,
5642.72s: got it. So it's near the top. First three images. Here's the first image. Okay, security sold not
5654.40s: yet purchased that fair value. Yep. Okay. Proven the shorts are merely future buyers. Yeah. Yeah.
5661.44s: I think we know this though. Yeah. I don't know. This this I think is
5666.16s: is known that this is also building. Yeah. This is exactly what I would expect to see.
5676.96s: Yep.
5680.32s: This all this all makes sense. Okay, cool.
5688.32s: Does this thing have a
5696.56s: all right, let's get back through here.
5703.76s: As an industry we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that's prudent.
5710.32s: I mean, it's objectively a fair thing to say.
5722.08s: All right.
5726.64s: Rock bag hold. Black rock is operating in a shadow market with citadel and bridge water.
5732.88s: Whoa, bridge waters. Wait, is bridge water affiliated with this?
5739.20s: There are three contributing to the greatest market manipulation of all time.
5742.56s: Head of the snake citadel is beginning to fail.
5745.28s: Layal. I believe citadel shorted the majority of Black Rock's Jimmy portfolio in addition to
5750.96s: other highly shorted songs leaving Black Rock to hold the bag.
5756.56s: What does that mean though?
5776.24s: All right, let's see what chat GPT says.
5781.20s: Thank you. It's this one.
5784.96s: I'm all right. This.
5793.44s: All right.
5799.04s: Citadel's believed to have shorted the majority of
5802.24s: or all of Black Rock's Jimmy shares.
5805.84s: What's the relationship there specifically?
5811.84s: How is it known that citadel
5817.04s: tormented Black Rock's shares?
5825.60s: Is inferred through circumstantial evidence?
5828.56s: I see.
5829.92s: I said managers like Black Rock, commonly, Linhish.
5832.64s: Oh, I see. So just based on letting practices.
5834.56s: Okay. That makes sense.
5835.84s: Yep.
5843.12s: Point to potential rigging market through to trade practices.
5846.56s: Okay.
5850.88s: I'm really an asset manager relies on citadel's market making.
5856.24s: Yep.
5860.80s: The investigation outlines a network of influential firms operating in a way that could
5864.64s: potentially manipulate the market for significant gain. Yeah. I think that's so fair.
5868.32s: The main thing is that they just run the risk of
5874.88s: being caught to different degrees.
5876.40s: And even if they're caught to varying degrees, I don't even think they fucking care.
5880.24s: Because the fines are in no way relatable to the overall issue. So yeah.
5895.60s: Yeah. Okay. That one makes sense.
5899.04s: Citadel and Friends have shorted the treasury bond market to oblivion using the repo market.
5903.60s: Citadel owns a company called Palafox trading and uses them to short-intrate treasury securities.
5911.92s: Exclusively part here is a little interesting because it's very common for companies like this to
5919.04s: specialize. So I don't know if this seems like it. They think it's a bigger deal than it probably is.
5927.52s: Palafox managers, one fund for Citadel. Yeah.
5933.84s: Or owned by offshore investors in the Cayman Islands that also is just a tax and security shelter.
5940.72s: So that makes sense.
5942.48s: The reverse repo agreements are entirely repoticated and then they cannot pay off their own repo agreements
5949.76s: until someone pays them first. Oh, interesting.
5957.68s: This is interesting.
5963.20s: All right, let's see what this is.
5972.00s: The only issue I see with this is like the bond market is one of the biggest, most liquid markets
5986.40s: on the world, like literally in the world. So I do struggle a little bit with the theory that
5994.72s: they're using either so far or the bond market as a relationship.
6001.92s: Summarize.
6005.92s: Because even somebody that's at a place like BlackRock or Citadel, they're massive.
6013.92s: They have massive influence, but they still are not able to fully control the something like the bond market.
6022.88s: Linzo says, I don't know if you went over to this. The point of deresting the shares is to get
6026.24s: a total kind of shares owned by retail. This way we could say we own the whole float. So where are
6030.56s: they getting the shares to short? I see. I mean, I don't see how that's possible.
6041.04s: Simply because institutions are still going to own some of them anyways.
6052.00s: But anyways, okay. Citadel threw it some citrary gauges yet we just read that.
6060.56s: The global fix. Yep. Okay.
6067.52s: Repo market dynamics, repo reverse repo, essential for liquidity. Yes.
6072.96s: Realize on rehab application where collateral is reused for multiple transactions. Yep.
6080.16s: It cannot settle repo agreements without incoming payments. Okay.
6091.12s: Pelifox access Citadel's market maker for repose supporting their massive short position.
6100.08s: Going reliance on re-hypothicated assets to cover obligations.
6107.20s: Instances were repo rates dipped below negative three. Just this extreme desperation for treasury
6113.84s: bonds that can to short squeezes in the stock market.
6116.56s: I don't think this makes sense.
6127.60s: Yeah. I don't really think this makes sense.
6136.88s: FICC holds 47 billion in deposits for unsettled treasury transactions,
6143.60s: sign up systemic streams, Citadel's high exposure to derivatives, lack of loan positions.
6150.16s: Dependence on bar assets set up potential risks. That's fair. I mean, they will have
6156.64s: so many circuit breakers and hedges in place. But yeah. Yeah. The reason why this doesn't make
6163.20s: sense is just because you're like, you're not going to see a squeeze in the bond market.
6167.92s: Same thing with the repo market. It's just it's too liquid. It's literally, I think it
6176.72s: literally might be the most liquid market in the world. Let's see.
6186.40s: Yeah.
6193.44s: All that other says, yeah, let's bully chat GPT. Wait, what am I supposed to ask it?
6197.12s: Oh, for a fact check. Yeah. And you fact check these.
6205.60s: You fact check each of these.
6207.52s: Let's see.
6226.24s: Yep. So this is just saying that this is normal stuff.
6229.60s: Yep. So it talks about the function of that. Yes. This.
6241.92s: Yep.
6245.36s: Hedge funds may take short positions in teabonds based on expectations of interest rates. However,
6250.40s: the claim that hedge funds have shorter the treasury bar market to oblivion is an exaggeration
6254.64s: definitely. Well, short positions exist. They're part of diverse trading. Yeah, I agree with this.
6259.52s: I think again, like to to be in a position to even try to do that is really, really extreme.
6270.80s: Yeah. Okay. So that I think that checks out.
6277.28s: And then I want to ask you one more
6285.52s: summarize the key takeaways from the post.
6298.40s: I wonder if there's anything
6302.88s: forward looking.
6304.56s: Lino says this would expose all the synthetics in a cover synthetic shares you need to buy real
6315.76s: shares and that would drive price up of no one sells supply and demand price goes up until they sell.
6323.20s: Well, price doesn't go up and supply and demand until they sell inherently, right? You need more
6330.08s: people buying because if you have a system where there's nobody buying, then price doesn't move.
6337.28s: It's impossible for price to be bid up if nobody is buying it. So there needs to be an element of
6343.36s: liquidity. Otherwise, there's there's no transaction. So yeah.
6349.68s: But
6357.44s: hold on, the rest of you said the loan, they loaned the same shares over and over again,
6360.72s: multiply hundreds of millions and the aesthetics and their billions and shares out in the well. Yeah,
6363.76s: definitely. And they they abuse that system. No, no, no debate there at all.
6373.04s: Yo, yo, yo, rollo says, but then margin calls. Wait, margin calls for what? I don't know where
6379.76s: you're talking about the scenario of the synthetic shorts and then the covering.
6389.68s: Just so I know if I'm looking at the right thing.
6395.60s: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what I'm I was just again, very specific points that I make when I look at
6402.16s: this stuff, the point that I'm making is that if all shares are D.R. asked 100% of the
6410.88s: float is locked up. And then we've identified all of these naked shorts, but nobody is selling.
6417.44s: If nobody is selling their shares, right, because they're all locked up, there are no shares for
6423.84s: anybody to buy. If there's nobody buying anything, price doesn't go up. People have to buy in order
6433.60s: to bid price up. So I'm just saying that that would come at a that there's a there's an impasse
6441.60s: in that scenario. Yo, yo, rollo says, what if there's one share? So it's a great, it's a great example.
6450.88s: So impulsive says, but one share can sell at one million and the price is one million.
6455.92s: It potentially, right? But in the the like the theoretical doesn't work in a practical sense.
6462.72s: I'll start it with that. So acknowledging that we're talking about a theoretical that wouldn't
6468.40s: play out in a practical sense, that one share would be bought at the first available price.
6476.40s: So a seller could say, I'm willing to sell this one share for one million dollars.
6482.40s: If there's only one share available and there's no more shares on the order book,
6490.16s: then there's still no liquidity that one share isn't going to offset anybody's position.
6497.12s: So again, from a practical sense in the hypothetical scenario, that one share would do nothing
6501.76s: for them. It doesn't matter. You need liquidity. Otherwise, there's there's literally no reason for the
6508.32s: transactions. So yeah. All right. So back to this.
6522.00s: Walk in like a duck, talk in like a duck. I like the name of this one.
6526.00s: I have prepared a case which strongly indicates that Citadel securities are committing securities
6532.88s: fraud. Okay. I don't really feel super. I don't think that this is a massive one for us to read
6543.36s: unless you guys do because like it. It isn't there's nothing in here that I would openly debate.
6549.36s: I am sure that different kinds of institutions like that are committing securities fraud.
6558.08s: And I don't think that it actually impacts that much. So yeah.
6566.32s: The reason why I say it doesn't impact much is just because until there's enforcement,
6571.20s: it doesn't really, it doesn't really move the needle.
6575.20s: Okay. I think this is one of the ones that you guys said that we had to read, right? A house of
6581.84s: cards. Am I, am I remembering correctly? I think you guys were saying that this was a big one.
6591.76s: The DGC has been taken over by big money. They transitioned from a manual to computerize ledger,
6596.16s: 80s and it played a significant role in 87 crash. In 03, several issuers with DTC wanted to
6605.76s: remove their securities from DTC's deposit because the DTC persistence were naked short so on their
6610.56s: securities turns out they were right. Okay. The DTC and its participants have created a market-sized
6616.80s: naked short scaling scheme. Okay. This is very interesting. So I'm going to drop this in first.
6623.76s: We'll read through this one specifically, but I just want to drop it in for a summary to start.
6641.28s: Right. Let's grab Gpt somewhere.
6645.60s: WTTC says I don't think 100% DRS will ever happen. I mean, again, I don't like speaking in
6655.36s: absolutes. So could it theoretically occur? It could. Is it in any sense of probability going to
6662.96s: occur? No. The reason why the the answer is exceedingly unlikely is because there are people,
6670.80s: there are institutions that already have the shares. So as long as those institutions maintain
6677.68s: the shares, then there's no way to achieve 100% DRS. So it would require institutions choosing to
6686.08s: unwind their shares for whatever position, whatever reason. And I'm sure some of them would over time.
6690.88s: But it's it's like you can't buy something that somebody isn't selling.
6700.88s: Um,
6705.12s: Impulsive says only need to DRS float, not outstanding. Okay. Because again, that's different. And I
6710.48s: agree with you. I think looking at something like flow outstanding is a different scenario. And I
6717.92s: think focusing on that is absolutely achievable in a in a theoretical and a practical sense.
6723.44s: Difficult to do, but achievable. But yeah, I was just responding to the to the comment of like 100%
6729.68s: DRS. Okay. So we know this stuff from DTC have been accused of facilitating large scale naked
6740.40s: short selling where the shares are sold without being barred delivered highlighted in O3 when multiple
6746.24s: issuers sought to withdraw their securities from the DTC, suspecting the participants were naked
6750.96s: shorting their stocks. Seed and co a DTC and Roli holds the master's certificate of shares when
6758.24s: shares are deposited, they issue IOUs instead of moving the actual certificates, centralizing control
6764.88s: and potentially enabling the re-ipotentation of shares for future transactions.
6770.96s: Um, okay. O3 issuers petition DTC tell them to withdraw their securities due to concerns over
6781.12s: participants shorting the stocks, which could harm the value, all right. DTC proposed SR that
6787.92s: rule effectively blocked issuers from retrieving their securities leading to widespread concern, okay.
6796.96s: Historical records and finra reports indicate consistent violations by DTC participants such as
6803.92s: failing to report short sale transactions accurately over reporting short interest. Okay.
6810.88s: DTC structures allows participants, primarily large institutions, significant control over
6819.04s: deposited securities, potentially enabling market manipulation agreed. Yeah, so this, this is
6826.48s: obviously highlighting the seeding codes really lack of transparency in their approach and the
6834.96s: fucking IOU system. So, back, back, all, factions. Yeah, that's fucking, that's madness.
6848.96s: Fact, fact, fact, fact.
6855.44s: Yeah. Yeah.
6858.56s: So, document cases short sale violations involving market major institutions. Yes, yes.
6867.44s: Yes. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Interesting. All right. So, let's scan through this now.
6879.04s: No.
6887.12s: This is the cool shit to me. The fact that fucking retail traders have taken the time to sit down and
6896.72s: get into this stuff is fucking fascinating. I have to scan through kind of quick though because my
6902.24s: dinner's getting here right now. Yep. So, we already went through all this stuff.
6913.76s: Many analysts blame these computer trading large institutions. Yes.
6923.84s: So, this is just talking about the impact of computerized trading and algorithms.
6932.48s: Yeah.
6937.12s: Computers dictated more and more features. Be sold, buyers, those features,
6942.08s: insist to shut up a little prices. Oh, interesting.
6953.52s: Risk appetite. Yep. Yep.
6962.32s: So, they wanted to pull their shares out, which we know.
6973.28s: Bigger deal when word got around that the proposed rule changed. Interesting.
6981.60s: Recently, a number of issuer securities have independently requested that DTC with draw from
6985.52s: the deposits, sort of securities by them. As explained in further detail by many,
6990.24s: the commenters opposing DTC's proposal, the issuers have made these requirements alleged that
6994.72s: their securities have been target of manipulative short sellers. That's nuts.
7006.56s: Dear Senator Lieberman, my firm represents FST shares traded on the NASD OTC,
7014.00s: Bolton board. We're writing to enlist your support of our request to the SEC to conduct an
7019.04s: investigation in negative short selling of shares of small cap companies on the OTCB. That's
7023.84s: awesome. That's absolutely awesome.
7034.48s: The rules should not be passed because by permitting the settlement of so-called shares by
7038.32s: traders not holding shares certificates, DTC itself to be incompetent to uphold the law and
7044.40s: stop. That's awesome. So there's a lot of people coming out unhappy with them. That's red.
7060.24s: Ultimately, migrate to T plus one. All that stuff's already updated.
7075.76s: So, I mean, this obviously highlights a massive loss and trust of DTC.
7081.84s: That's massively, massively, massively impacted here.
7090.96s: And this also really launched a lot of the conversation around naked shorting, which is huge.
7096.40s: Like, absolutely, absolutely critical. This is awesome.
7101.84s: How's the cards part two? I need to bookmark this one.
7112.48s: The fuck do I bookmark?
7117.44s: Right click. Nope, don't want to crop.
7129.20s: Nope.
7133.60s: I just want to bookmark.
7139.36s: How do you bookmark?
7142.48s: Damn.
7154.32s: Oh, damn. Well, anyways, I will fucking figure out how to bookmark this thing.
7159.76s: There it is. Oh, I see. So it's already, it's already flagged.
7165.28s: I see. Yeah. So let me highlight this.
7168.88s: And we'll pick up from here. Super interesting.
7174.40s: All right, gang. I'm going to go eat some dinner. Super awesome hanging out.
7178.24s: Tomorrow, I'll probably do a live stream before I do the outlier pro live stream. Later in the day,
7184.24s: I'll kind of set up a time for all that. And then, yeah, if you guys need anything,
7189.04s: hit me up in the discord, be an outlier, be an ape, be an outlier, ape, whatever applies to you.
7194.32s: And I'll catch you guys later.
