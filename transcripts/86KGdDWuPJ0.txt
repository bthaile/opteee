0.00s:  What's up, everybody? I think this thing's turning on. We're on here. What's going on?
14.28s:  We have a hopefully a bunch of work to go through tonight. I want to spend time going through
22.24s:  a lot more of that DD library that we took a peek at a little bit last time that I had
28.32s:  no idea what was the thing, but super stoked that it is. So we're going to poke through
33.84s:  there and hopefully learn some more about GameStop, the stock, the background, the story, all
42.56s:  of that great stuff. I was actually just texting with Peruvian Bull. So he and I, we're going
50.00s:  to create some more content together in a little bit, actually pretty stoked. He's starting
57.80s:  to build out and might get a little bit more into live streaming and stuff, which would
60.56s:  be really, really cool. I like learning about his perspectives and what not. So what's
68.40s:  up, apes? Great to see everybody. Also great to see the outliers and the outlier apes. Really,
74.56s:  whatever you consider yourself is cool here. We don't really care. Everybody is welcome.
83.36s:  Let me grab a few reddits. We need to grab GameStop. We need to grab Superstunk. I think those
93.44s:  are the main ones, right? For GameStop reddits, is that correct? I think so. Yeah.
107.52s:  And we got to grab the, we got to grab our map as well. You already know that. Cool. So I think
121.20s:  we literally have everything we're ready to grow. First things first, you already know what's up.
126.88s:  I need to know where you're from if you haven't told us yet. So we, our map is filling out.
135.12s:  There was somebody on one of the other live streams that was a little salty that I spend time
140.32s:  in the beginning of the live streams, which kind of bullshitting and doing this map thing. But I told
144.64s:  them that I actually don't really give a fuck about their opinion. And I have fun looking at the
150.16s:  map with you guys. One of the really cool things about this for me at least is how crazy is it
157.84s:  that there is an individual stock that connects people like this. I don't know of many other
165.60s:  stocks that do this. Sure. You could say something like Apple or Amazon, but it's different,
172.56s:  right? Like people that are buying Apple or Amazon, they're not buying it because
177.76s:  oh, we just love Apple as a company. It's, no, we think Apple is revolutionizing technology
185.44s:  and growing, which is one of the neatest things about it, I think. So the fact is like right now for
192.56s:  literally everybody on the stream, there's people from all these different places that have been
198.56s:  on this stream. And I emphasize this stream because it's not like I have a big YouTube channel
203.04s:  or anything. So the fact that there's this many people from all these different places from this
208.16s:  smaller corner of the world, I think is really cool. Mahi Kenbois from California, Mahi Kenbois,
214.72s:  don't you lie to me. That name's pretty clear where you're from. I'm just saying. Like I was born
221.52s:  at night, but it wasn't last night. You're trying to tell me California. I'm trying to tell you
227.28s:  based on your name. I'm not buying it. I'm not fucking buying it. Maybe we're in, let's go. So if
235.76s:  you're in California, you're probably somewhere super far south or LA based on your name. And my
242.88s:  guess is, well, let's see, we have to get a fact check here. So Mahi Kenboi, wherein Mahi Ken,
251.52s:  Mahi Koh, are you from originally? We got Maui, I don't know if we have Maui on the list already.
258.48s:  I think we have Hawaii. Yes, so we have Honolulu. We need to add Maui.
265.36s:  That's a cool ad. And then I guess one time I have to, I have to stream one word and Kauai so that
277.68s:  we can, we can cross Kauai off the list because technically my wife, they're not from, she's not from
285.44s:  Kauai, but she kind of grew up there. So she went to like school and stuff and Kauai. So I mean,
294.56s:  that's pretty close. I would give her credit for it.
299.92s:  Mahi Kenboi says Monterey County. Oh, I see. I see. All right.
309.12s:  Khalid Nali says actually someone named outlier asked me about that on Discord, but is this part
316.88s:  of something else? But I wasn't sure if it was a bot.
324.56s:  No, it wasn't. So for anybody ever that, for those that don't know, there is a free part
331.68s:  to the Discord. And then there's the part for the Patreon people, but the Discord is free,
336.40s:  literally for everybody to join. But I want to emphasize a specific element of it, which is this.
347.84s:  For literally anybody that finds their way into the Discord, when you go to start here,
355.44s:  I want you to read this very first part at the very tippy top. We do not DM anybody. It is such an
364.64s:  important. No, none of us DM anybody. The reason for that is because the scam on Discord is actually
370.80s:  really, really informed. What they do is they leave people in the Discord so that the person
379.28s:  in the Discord isn't the one that's actively reaching out. And they feed the names to other
384.72s:  people because we have it set up that unless you're verified, you can't see everybody else, which
389.52s:  is kind of part of how I set up the partitioning system. So yeah, the punchline is don't get,
396.56s:  just don't get scammed. That would be, that would be great. And I say that because I started doing
401.60s:  the whole YouTube thing and building the community and all this stuff to help people. And it's just
405.76s:  super frustrating to me that some people are getting ripped off by some bots straight piss me off.
415.92s:  So, a college says, got you a dude had your link. Oh, yeah, they copy everything. Yeah. So what they
421.52s:  do is they literally copy the entire profile to make it, obviously, look like it's me. That's their
428.48s:  goal. One of the things that you can do, um, college, out of curiosity is if you go to their profile
434.16s:  and you look at when it was created. And then if you look at the way that it's actually spelled,
439.04s:  there's going to be errors of some sort. Obviously, because it's not me. So they'll have small errors
444.32s:  in there, but they're super smart. They do stuff. That's one of the reasons why I switched from
449.36s:  ES and Vests because it was too easy to confuse uppercase eyes and lowercase else,
457.04s:  which is also pretty funny. So yeah, boy, don't get scammed out there. That's all I got to say.
462.88s:  James says, my one friend has 40 K and GMM praying for him. Well, depending on what his base is at,
467.68s:  he might be all right, potentially. And then, uh, mock chicken says, RGME. Okay, so I have that
476.48s:  one up. We'll be able to go through there. And then James says, you're a great guy. Eric,
479.84s:  thanks for the advice the other week already adapting to bigger losses. Now that I sized up my
484.32s:  portfolio, I don't know what I told you, but hopefully it was useful. Tanner says book of moass
493.68s:  parts one through three by GERKIN it. Also, where did the shares go? Okay, cool. So I will absolutely,
503.52s:  I'll absolutely check those out. Great. Great call out. The show.
512.80s:  James says his basis is 20. Yeah. Well, I mean, I'm your friends doing okay. Then the main thing is,
517.92s:  if your friend has more money and games stop at a basis of 20 that they're uncomfortable with,
522.24s:  they can literally flatten whenever they want. That's easy. PFA says Tyson definitely had
530.16s:  moass last night. Tyson did have moass. He made a ton of money. I'm, I'm so stoked for Mike. It's
537.36s:  like, it's crazy to me that all these people are so pissed off about the Mike Tyson fight.
546.16s:  And I just cannot understand what the fucking like what people thought was gonna, like, I just,
553.36s:  I don't understand it. So this is pretty cool. Let's grab, let's grab this.
560.64s:  Because you guys know, like, I'm a martial artist myself and I'm a fight fan. Like, I love
564.56s:  combatos. I like martial arts a lot. And this is hilarious too. This is so good. This is so good.
577.20s:  But yeah, I think one of the things that did surprise me, I have to be honest, is that his legs
587.68s:  in training looked fine. Like, they didn't look that bad. And for whatever reason in the actual fight,
594.32s:  it looked like he couldn't even like really walk, which I couldn't figure that out.
600.64s:  Because they're obviously they're not going through like some big dehydration, rehydration thing.
605.52s:  I like, I, yeah, I just, I couldn't identify why that was happening, the way that it was. It didn't
611.52s:  make sense to me. And obviously, training clips are always going to be really carefully selected and
616.64s:  whatnot. But it literally looked like he, he like couldn't walk well, which I, that part I don't
623.36s:  really understand. The other thing that I thought was really interesting is that he just didn't
629.04s:  grow much, which that's, why is this Mike Tyson? Fans are saying she stole the show. Oh, I see.
645.60s:  What the fuck is this? Mike Tyson to Jake Paul in the third round. Oh, from, yeah, that's funny.
651.92s:  This fuck that's so funny. Yeah. Anyways, I, I didn't think that he looked, I don't think that he
660.48s:  looked that bad. I think people, people had some crazy expectations for a dude that's almost 60.
667.28s:  But I did expect him to be able to walk a little bit like that, that really did surprise me.
671.12s:  The fact that he couldn't really walk well. That kind of sucked.
677.04s:  That Lawrence is the girlfriend was good. Yeah. So that fight, I didn't catch all of it because we
681.20s:  went for a walk during it. And it looked, I mean, it looked like they, they had a war, though,
688.72s:  from the clips that I saw before he left and whatnot. So yeah, that, that I'm stoked was a, was a good
695.44s:  fight. It looked like the one girl had a cut above the eyebrow, which always sucks. Like getting,
702.32s:  I don't know, getting cuts like that, especially from it accidental headbutt, just sucks,
707.92s:  because it puts a different tenor and it changes the fight a lot. But I mean, it is what it is,
713.12s:  right? It's the fight game shit happens. Colleagues is totally, his legs were throwing me off. What
717.76s:  was you doing with the chewing his glove or mouthpiece? It wasn't the, it wasn't the mouthpiece.
722.88s:  If you watch again, like I'm, I'm a bit of a, a fight dude. So if you watch my Tyson's old fights,
728.24s:  he has a tick where he bites his glove. But I think he was obviously doing a lot there because it,
735.44s:  he wasn't anywhere near as active as he was in his previous fights. So I think for sure it was just,
743.92s:  him, at least I didn't see anything like there was nothing wrong with the mouthpiece from what I
748.08s:  saw went in went out just fine. It was nice and tight as it should have been because his coach had a
753.76s:  hard time plucking it out a few times. But yeah, that it just, I've seen him do it a bunch throughout
759.92s:  his career. It's like this fucking tick he does. I think it was revved up to like 11 though,
764.72s:  because he probably felt a bit uncomfortable, right? Like, because you can see when he tried to bounce
770.48s:  around and get his feet on the room for whatever reason. Like he couldn't, he like it didn't look
775.76s:  comfortable at all, which is again, it's so, I just, I'm really, really confused by it to be
781.04s:  completely honest because like he didn't look bad when he was sparring. And again, I understand
787.52s:  that sparring is different than, you know, because they're going to release very carefully curated
795.20s:  footage. But still like to be that different with your legs from sparring to that. I don't know,
803.60s:  dog. I thought that was fucking, I thought it was fucking weird. I couldn't piece it together.
810.00s:  It looked like something was, looked like something was wrong. But the other thing I have to say to
815.60s:  give credit where credits do Jake, Jake could have fucked him up. Not saying that he could have
823.12s:  knocked him out. I don't know about that. But like there was a couple, there was a couple hits where
829.20s:  Jake clearly knocked him off balance. And he could have followed up a lot more aggressively,
834.80s:  probably knocked him down. I absolutely could have seen that happening. Again, if you don't have
839.04s:  legs getting knocked down, it's entirely realistic. And he didn't do that to him, which I actually
844.24s:  thought was classy. I thought that that was cool. So yeah, overall, overall interesting.
854.80s:  The main thing is I'm fucking stoked that he got through it. All right, that he's healthy. He looks
859.76s:  completely fine. He came in in shape. Oh, here's some highlights. Yeah, like he just his legs just
870.00s:  don't look like they're fucking moving, man. And you see how much he's on his heels and flatfoot?
876.96s:  That part's also really strange. Yeah. Interesting.
888.16s:  Mob Chickens says Jake pulled his punches when he he gauged Mike where Mike really was. Yeah,
893.76s:  because I mean, the first two rounds Mike did not look bad at all. He really didn't. He was moving
899.92s:  okay and he was hitting okay. But like, yeah, just seeing the way that he's responding to these hits,
907.28s:  you could tell he's not getting rocked. Like Jake's not rocking him at all. But it's like, he can't
913.52s:  fucking stand. Like he just couldn't get his feet under him, which was really interesting.
918.08s:  So yeah, I'm glad that they that again, he got through it. All right, he looked okay.
923.60s:  Because the main thing everybody kept asking me like for my friends and stuff because they know
926.96s:  I like fighting and they were they were like, yo, you know, what do you think about Mike Tyson
931.36s:  fighting? And it's like, it's one, it's not me to judge. But more importantly than that, I want Mike
937.52s:  to do whatever the fuck Mike wants to do. So like if Mike genuinely wanted to do that fight,
942.00s:  I'm so I'm so stoked for him. If for whatever reason whatsoever, he felt pressured to do it,
947.52s:  whether it be for money or for something else, then that kind of sucks. But yeah, the you could
956.96s:  tell even the way when when Mike did connect with Jake compared to when Jake was connecting with Mike,
964.16s:  Mike was just getting kind of like pushed as a whole unit. But the handful of punches that Mike
970.00s:  landed like you could literally see Jake's head moving, right? There's a difference in power
974.88s:  that Jake doesn't have compared even to 58 year old Mike Tyson. There's a power difference that
980.88s:  you can see it. You literally can see it in a sturdiness difference. So that's like says he did it
987.52s:  for the money. I think he knew he wasn't going to have this. I think so too. I think for sure that
992.24s:  obviously if if it wasn't what like a $20 million fight, I think that changes things. But even then,
1000.16s:  I don't think Mike needed the $20 million who doesn't want $20 million. I'm sure it doesn't hurt.
1005.52s:  So I actually don't think money was the only motivating factor. My guess is he was looking for
1013.76s:  just the experience like that. That's the other thing to know about a fighter like him. It's all he
1018.72s:  knows. He's fought his whole fucking life. And the only time he's been able to get out of the
1024.08s:  whole fight thing is by heavily drugging himself, right? He's either highest fuck or on a bunch of
1030.96s:  fucking shrooms to chill the fuck out, which is good. I'm glad he's able to find peace. But that
1036.40s:  also that's another way to go through life, right? That's still not going through life sober as
1041.28s:  you are who you are. It's altering yourself quite a lot. So yeah, to me, I still think he can fight.
1048.72s:  I don't know what happened with his legs. But I think if they can figure that fucking leg thing
1054.40s:  out, whatever that was, I think he looked fine. He was moving at the waist well. He can still
1058.96s:  fucking throw when he wants. But if you think about a big part of his style, it's slipping and moving
1066.08s:  encountering. But a big part of his counters as a smaller dude is he has to be able to leap forward
1073.52s:  to throw his punches. He has to. He's not a huge jab, dude. He's a hook guy. So without legs
1082.96s:  to close the gap like that, it doesn't work. And you can tell because anytime Jake started getting
1088.72s:  near Tyson, Jake just backed out, which is super smart because the fact is,
1097.52s:  again, even 50 year old Mike, man, if he connects well, like you're fucking sleeping, there are people
1102.24s:  who have the gift of power. And there are people who do not. Jake Paul doesn't really have the
1107.20s:  gift of power like that. You can tell just by the way he connects with people. Somebody like
1112.00s:  Francis and Gano from the UFC does Alex Pereira from the UFC does. And the way you can tell that
1119.04s:  power differential from people is when we have somebody that has to catch you perfectly in order
1128.00s:  to knock you out or TKO you, that's mostly precision timing speed applied really well. That's
1137.20s:  like a Conor McGregor. That's what Conor McGregor has precision timing speed. He has that stuff
1142.24s:  down perfectly to connect. But then there are people like, for instance, in Gano when he knocked out
1147.92s:  Alistair Overheim, who's no slouch, Alistair Overheim is a tough mother fucking dude. And you,
1153.84s:  I'll show you the punch. He like, he literally connected on like his fucking neck. And he still had
1160.24s:  more than enough power to put him out. That's the nature of heavyweights. As soon as you're above,
1164.40s:  you know, 220, you have generally the gift to enough power to put somebody to sleep decisively.
1172.88s:  I'm really interested to see steep A versus John Jones. I don't think it bodes well for
1180.40s:  steep A because he's been so inactive. But we'll see how that goes. What was it going to look up
1186.48s:  in Gano Overheim? And then we'll get into Jimmy. Yeah, this this year. I have to kill the sound
1201.12s:  otherwise you guys know we'll get we'll get like copyright struck. But take a look at
1210.48s:  take a look at this. So I think they do it in slow motion afterwards, but just watch where he connects.
1217.68s:  Like again, you can tell the difference between somebody who has power, the gift of power,
1222.16s:  and somebody who doesn't. So the knockout right there, super fast can't really tell.
1233.52s:  But watch watch when they bring it into slow motion.
1244.64s:  So watch where watch where Francis is left hand lands watch.
1252.80s:  Objectively, that's not a clean hit. That's not where you want to knock somebody out. Objectively,
1259.60s:  it's not where you want to knock somebody out. You can see it's hard to tell.
1263.20s:  X is fucking head is experiencing massive whiplash at this precise moment. But you can see he's
1268.88s:  on the neck and on the inside of the chin. He's here. That's not a knockout punch for somebody that
1274.96s:  doesn't have the power. That is a massive blow debilitating off centering stuff like that.
1281.28s:  But there was so much power generated from this dude because he has that gift that if you watch
1286.96s:  his head, his head snapping back is what knocked him out. It wasn't this hit up front, which is crazy.
1292.96s:  Most people know for like knocking people out, the big thing is to cause massive disruption in
1298.72s:  the brain, right? It's like whiplash. That's what will cause it. So if you take a look at the way
1304.08s:  his head flows, that that's what knocks him out because he has the force. Head moves back,
1311.84s:  has to abruptly stop at some point because you run out of literally mobility. And that causes a
1317.92s:  really fast disruption of your brain. Lights out. Yeah, he's completely asleep there. So
1327.44s:  that's the fascinating thing because again, you can tell like some people have power that can
1332.96s:  do that with a really unclean shot because they have so much power. And then other people do not.
1338.08s:  And I can I can easily tell you from Mike when he did connect with Jake, because he didn't even
1345.52s:  throw that hard when he did. He absolutely has that power still. Plus as you age, that's way slower
1353.12s:  to go, which is really interesting. So yeah, really, really interesting stuff. All right, so
1361.36s:  Lauren says brains are important. Yeah, it's something about the brain doing something or
1365.76s:  other. I feel like a lot of times my brain betrays me, but I guess the brain is supposedly
1371.84s:  supposedly important and does something. I don't know. Posted to do something they say.
1376.72s:  All right. So last time we were going through all this different DD and we got through some of it,
1384.80s:  man, we have a lot to go. We have a whole lot to go. So we're going to have to go through these
1388.40s:  pretty quick. And if there's one of these though that we click into, please let me know if it's
1396.96s:  like a big deal. If it's something that we really need to take some time on, because what I'm
1401.92s:  actually going to do is prime up chat GPT to help us out just for the sake of time. So, but if
1408.96s:  there's one that you know is like a really good one for whatever reason, again, tell me so that
1415.44s:  then we can we can take our time with it. But otherwise, I'm going to kind of poke through these
1420.72s:  because again, a lot of this is me building context. That's the that's the whole goal. I think
1425.52s:  this thing's super cool. All right. So let's see. Okay, this is 842 pages. Oh, fuck. Oh, this is
1438.72s:  great. So this is a compilation. This is beautiful. This is exactly what we need.
1445.84s:  Diamond, hand, logo are okay. Cool.
1453.04s:  Oh, this is literally perfect. Hold on. Let me move this out of the way.
1459.36s:  And then I'm going to
1461.36s:  maximize this.
1466.80s:  Yeah, this is perfect. I'm stoked that that this exists. I didn't know that this was a thing. That's fantastic. All right. And then I'll move this over here.
1478.00s:  Oh, that's good. I like this. Can't agree. The game's not going to be a good one. I'm not going to
1484.80s:  Oh, that's good. I like this. Can't agree. The game stop short squeeze crisis solved.
1495.20s:  Off Poon says, what are the dates on this D.D. after the Jan squeeze? Where does it which D.D.
1501.12s:  this one? This one is from 26 May. Does it give us the dates in the beginning? Because that
1511.44s:  would actually be kind of cool to see some of the dates. It does.
1521.84s:  14 March, 18 March 31, 6 April May. So these are not in chronological order. Yeah, it's kind of like
1536.72s:  shotgun blast order. But most all I see here after 2021, like after January. Okay.
1552.32s:  Yeah.
1563.60s:  Can you guys read this? I don't know if it's easier if I read it out to you. If I read it, it's going
1567.68s:  to take me longer or I can gloss over it. And then highlight stuff that I see. Let me know,
1574.64s:  because as long as you guys can read it, I'm not going to read the whole thing out loud because it'll
1578.24s:  it'll slow me down a lot. And then what I'll do is I'll kind of skim through it quickly and find
1583.76s:  the stuff that that sticks out. Core intention of this post summarized my last.
1591.84s:  Not intended to serve as source of proof.
1600.80s:  There's a massive amount of research in D.D. that has been performed documented around this
1605.20s:  theory can be found here. Okay.
1635.20s:  So it looks like the same. This all looks like the same stuff. Let's see.
1656.96s:  All right. Certain participants in the stock market manipulators take an advantage.
1662.64s:  Loophole short sell. So I think we already know this naked shorting. I think we all know this.
1670.00s:  Yep. So they got fucked. I think we know we know all this.
1675.76s:  Okay. I think we can skip all this. I think we can skip all this. Oh, let's see.
1683.20s:  Very different from investors, but harder to explain. Yep. They are. Yep. Yep.
1690.00s:  Yeah. Special rules. Yep. Naked shorting is one of them. Yep.
1696.56s:  Yeah. Yeah.
1702.56s:  Yep.
1702.96s:  Yep.
1707.76s:  This type of trade illegal outside of specific situations involving market. Like market makers due to a loophole lack of oversight regulation.
1711.28s:  Naked short selling can be used to manipulate the prices. This is all correct.
1715.04s: ynthetic shares. If there's anything in here, again, that you see as I go through it that you're
1719.60s:  curious about, let me know. Otherwise, again, I'm just going to keep. I've learned to speedread. So I
1724.40s:  I normally blast through stuff pretty fast. But if there's a like any of these topics that you
1731.92s:  see that you're like, yo, I don't know anything about that. Can we talk about it? Let me know.
1737.60s:  Synthetic shares are obviously a really important part of this whole thing.
1741.44s:  Synthetic shares.
1742.72s:  Yeah.
1743.44s:  So I'm going to go through this whole thing.
1744.72s:  Synthetic shares.
1746.72s:  Yeah.
1748.72s:  Yeah.
1750.72s:  Yeah.
1752.72s:  Yeah.
1754.72s:  Yeah.
1756.72s:  Yeah.
1758.72s:  Yeah.
1760.72s:  Yeah.
1762.72s:  Yeah.
1764.72s:  Yeah.
1766.72s:  Yeah.
1768.72s:  I'm going to put you guys over here for a second so I can move stuff around. Let me download this thing.
1776.32s:  It is in PDF.
1778.72s:  Aha. This will be much faster too.
1786.96s:  Okay.
1788.72s:  So let me save this.
1799.44s:  Yeah.
1801.44s:  Okay. I'm stoked. This is great.
1816.24s:  All right. Let me grab you guys back over to this screen.
1819.04s:  This is cool.
1827.04s:  So this looks like I can scroll through it. This will be much, much faster. This is fantastic.
1837.92s:  As for me, I like the stock. That's so awesome.
1842.24s:  I think I have fucking sap in my hair that don't love.
1849.04s:  Yeah.
1851.04s:  Okay.
1853.04s:  Well, this is all that basic stuff we're looking at. All right. Here we are.
1859.04s:  Retail market makers and they get shortings and the FedEx.
1867.04s:  Okay.
1869.04s:  Margin.
1873.04s:  That Lauren says sap is better than pink eye. Yeah.
1877.04s:  Thankfully, I haven't had pink eyes since I was like a child because I have a thing called an immune system.
1883.04s:  But so that in that context, I'm not sure if sap is better because it's like,
1887.04s:  I don't know how to get fucking sap out of hair though.
1889.04s:  I have like, I definitely have some of it back here though.
1893.04s:  There's literally no doubt in my mind, which is unfortunate for me, I believe.
1900.08s:  Yeah. We don't necessarily love that. Love that for me.
1905.68s:  Oil. What kind of oil? That would be great.
1911.68s:  James says put it in notebook LM and make it into a podcast.
1917.68s:  The problem with something like that would still be slower than my ability to read through this.
1923.68s:  This is just all very basics.
1931.68s:  They're just talking about margin. Here we go. Let's see.
1937.68s:  Large, large short position on a stock whose price rapidly increases.
1941.68s:  Okay.
1944.68s:  Yep.
1947.68s:  Yep.
1951.68s:  Yep.
1957.68s:  So this I'm actually noticing is kind of conflating two different terms.
1965.68s:  Do they? Is this alphabetical these terms?
1971.68s:  They're not. Damn it. What the fuck went to the alphabetical? You come on guys.
1979.68s:  Yeah. This looks a little bit like they're conflating a couple different things.
1985.68s:  Let's see. What I'm seeing is conflating short squeeze from something like a gamma squeeze, which have different circumstances.
1995.68s:  And understanding the difference in those circumstances is actually like really, really important.
2001.68s:  First, let me see.
2005.68s:  I think I should be.
2012.68s:  No.
2016.68s:  I'm trying to send it into the counts because I have a paid version of this and I want to be able to use the AI tool.
2030.68s:  Is this work?
2045.68s:  What the fuck?
2054.68s:  I think this should be correct.
2077.68s:  I know. And then sign it.
2083.68s:  So I'm hopeful that if this works, then we can have the AI tool help us.
2098.68s:  Okay.
2102.68s:  All right. I think we might be okay.
2107.68s:  We'll give it a go.
2113.68s:  Lawrence is coconut oil and let it sit for 10 minutes. Yo, 10 minutes. There's no fucking way.
2119.68s:  To sit there and let coconut oil sit my hair for 10 minutes. That's like an impossibility, I think.
2126.68s:  It's a nice idea. I'm sure like from a functional standpoint, it absolutely sounds like something that would work.
2133.68s:  But from a practical standpoint, I think you are grossly over estimating any shred or semblance of patients that I might have, which I really have a disease when it comes to patients.
2149.68s:  That Lawrence is impossible. That's a bit dramatic. No, no, no, that is the most accurate description I can think of.
2156.68s:  It's that is an impossibility. I don't think it can functionally be done by somebody like me.
2165.68s:  I just don't see it. Maybe for somebody that's that's better than I could see, but for somebody like me.
2175.68s:  There's no way. There's no way. I don't think that that's literally doable.
2180.68s:  I think that you're asking me to do something that.
2184.68s:  Yeah, that's that's undueable. There's no way. I don't have that kind of fucking patients.
2190.68s:  Again, you have to you have to understand different people.
2194.68s:  We have like different strengths and different weaknesses. And that is not one of my fucking strengths right there.
2200.68s:  Patience is a virtue that somehow fucking skipped right over me.
2207.68s:  And I don't fucking have it. So patience is whatever that is.
2216.68s:  All right.
2218.68s:  Cedric says put the do rag on and STF you that's actually probably a good idea.
2225.68s:  I think because then I wouldn't be able to touch it.
2229.68s:  I think that would actually be the big secret.
2233.68s:  All right. So let's see. I want to know I've never used the AI tool for this.
2238.68s:  So I don't know exactly how it works.
2241.68s:  I wonder if I can ask it to summarize a section.
2250.68s:  Yeah, this is all basic stuff. So I'm just fly through here.
2254.68s:  Get to the first one.
2259.68s:  So this this is talking about the mechanics of a short squeeze, which I think everybody here is appraised up again.
2266.68s:  So I think it's something that you're unfamiliar with. Let me know.
2269.68s:  And then I will slow down and describe it and discuss it with you.
2275.68s:  Is the squeeze squos no.
2282.68s:  I mean, why would they say no?
2288.68s:  Is it always no in the expect when when we say is the squeeze squos they simply mean it can happen again. Yeah.
2296.68s:  Because one of the like one of the realities here is the depth of a future squeeze.
2304.68s:  It very likely will look a lot different than what this one historically looked like, which I'm not sure if that's being fully accounted for here by people.
2315.68s:  But again, the answers up to you short sellers likely needed every share to cover the position.
2324.68s:  And a lot of me says they mean it hasn't happened yet. Okay, so that was the following.
2329.68s:  So I see. Okay, so Lauren says it wasn't a squeeze. It was a sneeze in my last is tomorrow. Okay.
2337.68s:  So then the prevailing hypothesis is that what happened in 21 was a smaller version of what's expected to come. Is that correct?
2355.68s:  Not a true squeeze until synthetics are forced to cover.
2364.68s:  Well, is that I don't understand that definition.
2373.68s:  Okay, so Jan 21 was a sneeze.
2377.68s:  And again, just making sure I understand when we say sneeze in this context, we just mean it was like a small squeeze like it wasn't.
2385.68s:  Wasn't as big as it needed to be.
2390.68s:  Don't care. It says, yeah, basically the believe that short hedge funds figured out a way to hide short positions and swaps and never close.
2396.68s:  I think that's true. Like I've seen evidence of that for sure.
2403.68s:  It would have been a squeeze, but was halted. Okay. Got it.
2408.68s:  Now help me reconcile this then. If if this if the squeeze that happened is considered a sneeze.
2417.68s:  This sounds like a fucking doctor.
2419.68s:  Soobstook if the squeeze is considered a sneeze. I don't know how to keep rhyming that.
2424.68s:  But if that squeeze was considered a sneeze.
2428.68s:  That was halted, right? There was direct intervention by market forces to stop it.
2435.68s:  What's the premise then that the next squeeze would actually be a squeeze versus being halted again by market forces.
2454.68s:  Renegade trader says wishful thinking.
2466.68s:  I'm in pressure.
2474.68s:  But I think SM I think time and pressure doesn't matter, right?
2479.68s:  Because if we look at the previous instance, there was obviously enough time and pressure that would have propelled price much higher.
2487.68s:  But then there was an artificial intervention.
2490.68s:  So the way that the only way that I could conceivably see an argument being posed by somebody that would be logical would be that they think.
2500.68s:  Conditions are different that would lead to markets not intervening.
2507.68s:  But I don't I don't see why we would think that that would be the case because we know from the original sneeze that the market was literally concerned like about composite total market viability.
2528.68s:  So I don't see why anybody would think that we would be less inclined as an institution again taking the other side's perspective less inclined as an institution to stop in occurrence of that again, I don't get that.
2553.68s:  I'm just getting caught up Vladimir says who was buying 480 per share on 27 Jan 21 crazy it's crazy, but again, if you're going into this thing not knowing that it's about to be intervened with a squeeze like that literally can double again.
2570.68s:  So even for somebody that gets in at 480 that doesn't mean that you can't get out for a fucking thousand.
2576.68s:  So the people that would be doing that are the people who are a bit late to the party, but they're doing the trading game of buying high looking to sell higher.
2587.68s:  I don't hate them at all.
2589.68s:  The people that the people that bought it 480 they got fucked because of a rug pole because the market then decided like, no, we're not letting this go on anymore we're done here and that fucking sucks.
2605.68s:  W TDC says less needed more could be the premise is based on what would happen if all of the regulatory requirements were enforced against more participants rather than locking retail out.
2617.68s:  Yeah, no, I get that, but I still the part that I'm not understanding here is if we're expecting a bigger squeeze in the future and the last squeeze was cut short because of the total impact it might have had on the financial system.
2634.68s:  Why do we think that the future squeeze is going to be bigger than the previous squeeze that was smaller and still cut short.
2645.68s:  Like I just I'm trying to understand that as you can tell like my you know my my heart's out in the open here I'm trying to understand.
2654.68s:  Because from like a logical perspective I just don't understand how that reconciles.
2662.68s:  Sean says prolonged squeeze like Tesla that's not a squeeze though.
2666.68s:  So what Tesla has done is appreciated and value as a company they become more valuable that's completely different than a squeeze.
2683.68s:  The squeeze may not be bigger but the run may be longer I see.
2690.68s:  Okay, I see okay so then that.
2695.68s:  Sadrick says 100% Tesla is a squeeze what what moving Tesla you guys talking about I don't know actually what we're what time frame or reference what time frame we're referencing.
2726.68s:  Tesla is short inches from 2016 until they ran up okay got it so we're talking older test sorry I thought you were talking about something more recent yeah well I also think there's a couple news articles about that right.
2738.68s:  Because there was definitely series of shorts must used to dunk on people about that which I always thought was entertaining so you're just talking about like a standard short squeeze though like you you get when you're talking about the Tesla in those time frames.
2754.68s:  We're not talking about this idea of like melas or anything is that correct.
2763.68s:  I'm trying to understand the context here.
2766.68s:  Micah says well GameStop is in a better position and wider base investors are choosing to buy more buying pressure along with short covering could be huge I see.
2774.68s:  I see okay so sadrick you're just saying that yeah so that that's that's why I'm confused with the comparison to Tesla.
2783.68s:  Because Tesla had like very normal short squeezes they weren't like the movement that you saw in Tesla was like pretty textbook short squeeze like older school if we're talking like mid 20's slash I think there was also what in 2020 I want to say that there was.
2803.68s:  Another instance of a squeeze there as well.
2806.68s:  So but Tesla to me would be an example of just like.
2812.68s:  Standard squeeze falls off rolls up.
2819.68s:  I said to say it wasn't my last because they had time to exit the shorts yeah well that's kind of the nature right of short squeezes because they happen and that's why it's called a short squeeze and again like a short squeeze is different than a gamma squeeze which is really important to differentiate between them.
2835.68s:  Because a short squeeze still typically reconciles and it's not being fueled inherently by market maker.
2849.68s:  Sean says this is the debate I think some people believe in the fairy tales of one million per share but I think most people regularly just think something akin to Tesla.
2859.68s:  But.
2863.68s:  So then.
2866.68s:  So then Sean in that example then most people you would by that position you would say like most regular people aren't then gunning for moass most people are just gunning for like a future short squeeze reminiscent to what game stop is already experienced is that correct.
2889.68s:  Impulsive says seriously watch the fear in his eyes Thomas petrified said it would moass yeah definitely petrified talked about the total systemic risk which was no joke there.
2901.68s:  Sean says yes but it sustained highs.
2905.68s:  I don't that's the part I don't understand because by its nature a squeeze whether it's a short squeeze or gamma squeeze is temporary squeezes don't persist into perpetuity.
2918.68s:  It's a it's a functional constraint that exists.
2932.68s:  Lawrence is kind of short squeeze turn into gamma squeeze or vice versa definitely they so short squeezes and gamma squeezes absolutely have interplay no doubt.
2941.68s:  And the interplay can literally be violent between short squeezes and gamma squeezes so what 100% 100% and happen.
2951.68s:  I'm going to stretch this and then I think I can even zoom in a little bit for us.
2961.68s:  I see.
2962.68s:  I see.
2967.68s:  Okay.
2968.68s:  So that's man that's like tricky to get my arms around so let me let me know if I got this right there are some people.
2978.68s:  Who are searching for moass which is like financial system breaking almost level of short gamma squeeze whatever massive price movement that's one bucket then there's another bucket of people who are looking for what we would consider to be like more standard short squeezes.
3001.68s:  And then there's another bucket of people and not saying that they're discreet there might be overlap and then there's another bucket of people who genuinely like the company long term the story of the company the turnaround perspective and stuff like that and then there's a like the third bucket there.
3020.68s:  Is that correct so there's a bit of a diverse view is the background here okay.
3033.68s:  Got it that's super helpful i'm just trying to i'm trying to like frame everything in my mind.
3039.68s:  I'm trying to get it that's super helpful.
3049.68s:  I know sometimes I asked a lot of fucking stupid questions but I like to understand things at their core it helps me a lot.
3062.68s:  One is the squeeze nobody knows here you go why does holding do anything so here's my next question.
3071.68s:  With the recent at the market offerings and now in abundance of shares.
3079.68s:  How does this impact this this idea of of holding and then I have a secondary question which is.
3092.68s:  If we're holding.
3095.68s:  Where's the where's the exit that isn't stepping on one another to get out the door.
3102.68s:  Because the only way to realize the money from a squeeze is to sell at some point and then as that selling starts to occur in cascades into future selling that pushes price down.
3125.68s:  Of Vladimir says drs works against the short squeeze you want higher short interest.
3131.68s:  I don't.
3135.68s:  I don't see that the same I see your point but one of the one of the important parts specifically about like a really aggressive short or gamma squeeze is.
3150.68s:  Share availability so if you're making it impossible for people to tap shares to move around it decreases total liquidity.
3166.68s:  I think some people hold this stock is a form of protest almost yeah I mean I already told you guys I the shares that I hold is literally just to it's literally just to support the the eight movement like I just want to show the eight some love because I think what they're doing is really interesting.
3191.68s:  Yolo rollo says drs takes shares off exchange so they can't short though yeah if you're not synthetic shorting right if you're synthetic shorting then you're still shorting but more importantly than that it requires less short interest to have the same short interest ratio because there's less availability again there's there's a relationship there.
3219.68s:  So let me let me simplify my first question for the ape community is holding right now as it sits today like a cornerstone element of the strategy like is that still a really important part of the the eight movement where people are buying and drs shares is that still at the same magnitude.
3247.68s:  Yes okay got it so that's still a big push what do we know what percent of the float is currently locked up and then let me I gotta go grab another mango orange will be back.
3277.68s:  you
3307.68s:  right.
3323.68s:  Yeah there's a hundred and sixteen people in here shout out to you guys thanks for helping me learn about this by the way I'm I genuinely am a appreciative okay so it looks like 25% you guys are saying is drs so of the 25% then that's drs
3348.68s:  and then we're going to get a target a target percentage that is been identified as like a critical point.
3362.68s:  we have something to edit PDF copy attacked right through on our line highlight
3372.68s:  100% 100% would be no good. I don't think that would be good at all. Why would you
3382.38s:  guys want 100%? Wait, so you guys are saying it was 100% that was, you know, I'm fucking
3396.20s:  confused. There's a lot of different stuff flying around. So impulsive is saying purpose
3402.02s:  of D.R.S. was to prove synthetic shares, which that I think it did. And then we're saying
3410.18s:  that it's to lock the float. Off Putin's talking about Cohen's legacy, which that's interesting,
3426.42s:  because I have no idea how anybody has any idea what anybody's legacy is is preferred or
3436.06s:  expected. Lock the float. Okay. Interesting. Super, super interesting. Are you guys manipulating
3448.70s:  the market? Yes. By doing this, it is manipulating the market. There's a lot of misinformation
3454.54s:  flying around. No, we are not. What the fuck do you mean you're not? This summer is in no way
3464.86s:  a form of market. We aren't, we aren't the ones manipulating the market. I, how, how is this the
3484.06s:  perspective? Jotate says apes aren't manipulating the market, but how? If the idea is to lock up all
3501.38s:  the D or at or lock up all the float and control the float in an effort to force or drive a squeeze,
3514.14s:  is that not manipulating the market? I see. So this, I see. So you guys, based on what I'm seeing,
3532.62s:  people are leaning on the fact that there's not a directive. Okay. So this looks like people know
3547.26s:  they are, but they're trying to find like a way to be able to deny allegations as they should.
3556.22s:  So, you guys are, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see, I see. Okay. So this makes way more sense. I
3585.66s:  think it looks like people are looking at this in a negative connotation of manipulating the market
3592.22s:  as a negative connotation, which I understand now.
3598.30s:  Cedric says you ain't going to lock up millions of apes. It's, it's not about that. Like, it's not
3602.38s:  about that at all. Like you can try to find the worst offenders, so to speak and go after them
3609.02s:  if they were so inclined. Sean says market manipulation is illegal. Yes. Well, let's actually look
3617.58s:  up the definition. I'm curious. Research the definition of market manipulation, because I'm
3626.86s:  looking at market manipulation in the, not in a legal sense here. I'm looking at it in a practical
3634.06s:  sense. Right? Like the idea of trying to cause a squeeze is manipulating the market from again,
3639.98s:  like a practical sense, because it's creating conditions that are favorable for a otherwise
3647.18s:  generally unnatural market movement to occur. So it's manufactured that kind of thing.
3653.90s:  I don't, the way that I'm laying that out is not in any way trying to paint it as a bad context.
3662.78s:  I don't think that's bad. I actually think it's fucking smart. It's like, it's other people
3667.50s:  manipulate, like institutions manipulate. Everybody manipulate the market as much as they possibly can.
3673.58s:  So I don't think it's a bad thing. I just think from a, from a technical perspective, it's exactly
3680.62s:  what it is. Now, I understand from the legal perspective, though, this makes a lot of sense.
3686.86s:  So I'm trying to look up the actual SEC definitions of market manipulation so that I understand this.
3697.34s:  When someone artificially affects supply and demand for security,
3703.18s:  are to fit artificially. What does this mean? This is not, this is not that, that doesn't apply.
3717.34s:  That doesn't apply. That doesn't apply. So based on investor.gov, their, their context for market
3726.94s:  manipulation, none of this applies. Yeah, this doesn't, this doesn't look like it applies at all.
3735.98s:  So let me look up one other thing really quick. Research cases of market manipulation. I want to
3749.50s:  look research tried cases. I'm going to look at trial specifically.
3761.90s:  Because this looks like they generally are targeting, like, not retail at all. This looks like,
3769.10s:  this looks like it's really, let's let's actually search for that.
3775.50s:  Here we go. Here.
3779.98s:  So our K-gos, we know that. We know that Citroen got fucked, thankfully, good.
3788.30s:  Two former traders at JP Morgan were convicted of engaging multi-year market manipulation scheme.
3795.18s:  Okay. Yep. So they were spoofing and stuff. Yep. So that's still at an institutional level.
3801.34s:  So these dudes.
3809.42s:  Yep. So this absolutely looks like standard. Yeah. So like, I think, I think from like a fundamental
3819.26s:  perspective, what apes are trying to do is manipulate the price. But I think from a legal
3825.50s:  definition, nothing in here looks like it even remotely applies to the eight movement.
3831.66s:  So this, I understand, I understand much more, I think now.
3836.54s:  Dutedo says things been real quiet about left super sus. Well, I think it's because his trial was
3840.62s:  moved out by a year. And he naturally isn't going to talk about it because it literally is just
3846.78s:  detrimental for him to talk about it. It raises his risk considerably. So for somebody that's going
3853.82s:  through litigation, they're, they're just going to shut the fuck up as they should if they're smart.
3858.86s:  And he probably has decent legal counsel.
3864.22s:  Sedrick says in why roaring city, roaring kitty is not manipulating because he never said to buy
3869.02s:  anything. Well, not just that, but roaring, roaring kitty doesn't say shit other than his
3874.54s:  fucking opinion or what he's doing. I don't think that's manipulating at all. I think, again,
3881.50s:  there's from a functional perspective of reality behind he has to know when he tweets things about
3890.94s:  GameStop or when he posts about GameStop, GameStop goes up. He has to know that. But I don't think
3898.06s:  that that means he's manipulating things. He absolutely can cause GameStop to move. But
3908.30s:  Sean says, but the media were talking about him and E-Trade threatened to kick him off.
3911.66s:  E-Trade discussed it, but I don't think they made any threats to kick him off. I think they
3917.10s:  discussed it. And I don't think that they were kicking him off under the premise of,
3925.10s:  under the premise of him manipulating the stock. I think that they probably for a litany of
3931.74s:  different reasons just thought there was more risk in having him as a client.
3941.50s:  So yeah,
3944.46s:  and Pulse of sometimes he posts Reynah Shink, GameStop goes up. What is he supposed to do? Yeah,
3948.30s:  well, and that's the thing, right? It's like him as a personality. He's been really
3954.06s:  really tightly associated with the ticker. So yeah, Sean says there's CNBC having debates in
3965.34s:  May about him manipulating the market. Wait, really? I have to look at I did not know that.
3971.90s:  I have to look at that. That's crazy.
3974.86s:  Oh, what do we do? CNBC,
3991.18s:  what would the, do you know what I should search for?
3995.26s:  CNBC,
4003.26s:  what the CNBC,
4006.38s:  roaring kitty market manipulation.
4025.26s:  All right. So you already know we have to do it through closed captions. We found our loophole.
4033.82s:  All right, let's see.
4046.62s:  So this looks good so far. I just need to speed it up because it's moving at like a glacial pace.
4055.58s:  Didn't seem to be anything that would be big red flag for regulators.
4062.06s:  There's going to be a massive wall of text that's going to pop up. She's saying a lot of words
4065.98s:  and nothing is popping up. Many, many experience in not telling people what to do,
4073.98s:  discussing his personal opinion, doesn't give regulators wiggle room to label them as a minute. Yeah,
4079.18s:  that's exactly correct. So this, this looks fine. This doesn't look like they're debating that he is.
4085.34s:  Full sends. Dude, you need to watch his last dream when he returned and had like 600 people watching him.
4092.54s:  Oh, I watch, we watched that a bunch of times. I'm not sure if you're new to the,
4097.10s:  new to the series here full send, but yeah, we spent a while looking at that stream because it's hilarious.
4106.06s:  Certainly seem to lay it out shows you his holding shows you quite a lot of ground
4110.70s:  when the stock went down to if anything, what he's doing is now sending up the perfect defense
4114.70s:  for a market manipulation, giving regulators everything he would use in his defense if they
4119.02s:  brought up a market manipulation. Up to the other trying to do, I think ban him.
4123.42s:  Very high bar to reach ban him from ever being able to trade again. I think so. That would be the
4127.58s:  only outcome if you were charged with market manipulation seeking a lifetime ban. Try to get
4132.70s:  him out of the market completely. You see what each trade is doing. They're unhappy. However,
4138.94s:  are getting the best press they've ever gotten there. Their information is also
4143.90s:  single thing he posts. So they should be happy right now in a good position as well.
4149.34s:  Readvertising. Yep. Yeah, this looks okay.
4156.54s:  Still a lot of active retail trading. Wall Street people always said they want people involved
4160.14s:  in trading. What do you think of the brand retail trading? Fantastic. The first time individual
4164.54s:  investors are out there in front learning from people. Memes stocks could be an SEC rule on
4168.30s:  memestock. Don't like that. Retail traders or investors are finally getting the market understanding
4172.62s:  what's going on. Opinion trading their own money. Great for the market. Wall Street wants retail
4179.66s:  doing it now. Wall Street's doing it having fun too. This looks okay so far.
4188.14s:  This is saying you don't want a bag. You don't want retail holding the bag. Wall Street was rigged
4194.62s:  for years and years. Retail investors could never true. With these types of mean stocks,
4198.62s:  key kill particularly everything is public, right? Perfect.
4203.98s:  Something else just crashed on my other screen. Receiving retail investors act very differently
4208.94s:  from how they did back in 21. Reacted to the positions you're showing and holding and affirming
4215.42s:  is holding what's the market supposed to do? How much of it is different from what day traders
4219.82s:  were back in the late 90s? Really 2000s. It's one thing to be an investor, another to be a trader.
4228.22s:  So far this looks fine.
4229.74s:  So you're seeing that regulators are looking at key kill and trying to find a rule that doesn't
4245.26s:  exist to control the market. Yeah, that looks okay. Sean says the point is why is it even a
4251.50s:  discussion? It's a fair discussion. I think it's a completely fair discussion.
4255.74s:  Again, even though Keith isn't telling anybody directly to do anything, there is a known,
4265.90s:  it's kind of like if I'm driving a car and I hit somebody and they die.
4272.22s:  Hopefully it doesn't happen. But in that scenario, I could just say, well, I didn't know that they
4277.34s:  were going to die when I hit them. Maybe I hit them going really slow, but maybe when they fall,
4282.46s:  they hit their head and then die. The point I'm making, and this is a very loose example to draw
4288.30s:  the correlation though, is that there's a reality that when we're in Kitty posts, we can generally assume
4298.30s:  game stops going to go up, generally assume. Now, I think what is clear from his perspective though
4306.62s:  is it's not like he's unwinding every time the move happens.
4314.06s:  So as long as he's still shooting straight, keeping it real, then I see absolutely nothing wrong
4320.22s:  with what he's doing at all. Ben says, if you were him, would you retire the Twitter handles
4325.18s:  another social media stuff? No, fuck no. I absolutely would not. Because again, I don't think he's
4329.34s:  doing anything wrong. I think that the one thing I would continue to do is like, here's another
4335.26s:  reality. When he disappears for prolonged periods and then pops back up randomly, that sends
4343.82s:  game stop reeling. If he was even remotely consistent with his posting, then the market would
4351.34s:  essentially have no effect. There would be realistically no effect. Because a lot of times when he
4357.98s:  bounces and then comes back, people then go into a fervor about it. So yeah, I don't think
4366.86s:  I don't think he should retire anything. I don't think he's doing anything illegal at all.
4371.26s:  Like I said, I'm not saying that I'm just saying that the conversation is reasonable.
4376.06s:  I'm not saying I don't agree with it whatsoever. I think that there's absolutely rightfully so.
4381.26s:  There's no grounds at all to accuse him of anything, which is exactly why they haven't.
4387.10s:  Right? There's a reason why they've tried to investigate him. And I know that he was investigated
4391.98s:  in a state. But again, investigation is different than being tried or accused. Those are
4400.38s:  yeah, those are slightly different things. So yeah, I don't think I don't think he's doing
4405.10s:  anything wrong whatsoever. I think he's he's literally just a dude talking about a stock that he's
4409.50s:  liked that he's liked for a really long, fucking time and sharing what he's doing.
4414.46s:  I don't see anything wrong with that at all. Sean says fair enough his old employer got
4418.94s:  fine for his behavior. Yeah, definitely. And his again, like he broke the rules. When he was
4426.62s:  actively trading at that point, he broke the terms of what his company allowed him to do.
4434.30s:  So like in that circumstance, Keith was wrong. His company was wrong. The reason why they
4441.34s:  were fined is because they should have found it and stopped him. They also found that there is
4446.62s:  other people doing similar shit, other people operating without the licensure that they needed
4452.30s:  and stuff like that. So like their internal regulations just sucked. But like in that in that
4457.34s:  circumstance, Keith was wrong. He broke the rules laid out by his company. His company ended up
4462.06s:  paying the price for it, which is, fuck him. I don't care. But that's that's absolutely fair.
4470.14s:  WATDC, the terms he broke were that he was teaching regular people what he knew. That's that's not
4474.70s:  it. Again, you guys already know like my goal in all of this is objective truth. It's not opinion,
4481.50s:  it's not skew. And the terms he broke absolutely were not teaching people what he knew.
4487.58s:  The terms he broke were violating what securities he was allowed to transact in.
4493.74s:  Most people like when I worked at Deloitte, there's different rules that are applied to you when
4498.46s:  you're in different kinds of businesses. So absolutely. So if we look at Keith Gill,
4508.14s:  where did he work? It was like something American. I fucking, I can't remember. You guys will know.
4513.66s:  What's the, I don't remember it at all. What's the name of the place that he worked at though?
4519.58s:  Mass mutual. Is that right? I thought I had like American it for some reason. I don't know why.
4524.94s:  Maybe I'm just fucking patriotic as shit. That could be it.
4530.94s:  Mass mutual. Okay, cool. So let me look that up. In the meantime, I got to get my dinner order off.
4538.14s:  We're going to do I towel.
4544.62s:  Okay, so Keith Gill, mass mutual. I'm just going to put like violation. Here we go.
4553.10s:  And I remember this is from like Rooters. And then we found this one as well.
4559.66s:  Because we've looked at these before. Settlements conducted.
4566.30s:  Whose relentless cheering for GameStop, part of a meme stock mania, state officials who
4571.98s:  resigned in January failed to adequately supervise his and other agents trading in online activity.
4577.66s:  So this, this is the rule that he broke. He would have had an employer's agreement with mass
4583.58s:  mutual worth mass mutual. What have told him you cannot do X Y Z in terms of securities.
4590.94s:  This is why for people that work at ETF funds. I have a friend of mine. I was actually talking with
4597.34s:  them about maybe trying to try to work with them. Because I think it would be really cool
4601.42s:  to learn more about that business. And anyways, one of the things he told me is like, well,
4606.46s:  if you work here, you can't you can't trade. And I was just like.
4612.06s:  Like that. Sounds great. Cool place. Cool people. But like that. So like that, it's very common in
4621.34s:  any sort of financial industry for that to be a constraint. And it's for conflicts of interest.
4627.18s:  So anyways, going back to the original question from Sean, which is what was it? This is what it was.
4633.34s:  He violated the employment agreement with mass mutual. He was trading things that he shouldn't have
4637.82s:  been trading. And mass mutual should have caught it earlier and stopped it. But they didn't. So
4642.86s:  that's why mass mutual got fucked. So yeah.
4646.06s:  WTDC, sorry, Fraser Ron because regular people were able to follow him. It got noticed. No,
4658.06s:  it's because it just got big. It didn't have anything to do with other people's involvement.
4664.06s:  It's because he literally became a fucking celebrity. So it's like the reason why they like,
4669.98s:  I wouldn't even be surprised if they didn't, if they knew and they didn't really care.
4676.46s:  But it got so big that they were made to care because everybody knew about Keith Gill and
4682.46s:  Roy and Kitty. He literally became a celebrity. He became like in your face. So then everybody was
4690.38s:  just like, Oh, who's this guy? What's his background? What does he do? And that's exactly how I got
4696.70s:  funneled back to him. It had everything to do with just his, him literally becoming a celebrity.
4704.78s:  And he had compliance constraints from his job that he violated. Like, yeah, nothing to do with
4709.34s:  other people following him. It had everything to do with his popularity, which is again,
4716.86s:  it's very cool. It's like really neat earned popularity. But Sean says why why wasn't he liable?
4725.18s:  That's kind of the cool part is because it's a corporate policy. So his job could have chosen
4732.62s:  to try to pursue him, but they found it easier not and they just accepted their fault because again,
4739.50s:  it's also not Keith's fault that mass mutual wasn't doing their fucking job.
4745.02s:  Mass mutual should have absolutely had systems in place to check and to stop that kind of behavior.
4752.62s:  So mass mutual was at fault for the behavior. And as you can tell, it wasn't just him. There was
4757.90s:  other people that were involved. And trying to see, oh, was it on this one?
4773.98s:  This that it failed to supervise its agents among the social media, right? So there's other people
4780.94s:  that are involved in that process. So they're the employment agreement between he and Mass
4787.34s:  obviously would have been terminated. I don't know if he got fired or if he left.
4792.06s:  But yeah, my guess is one of those would have occurred there. So that's his quote-unquote
4797.26s:  punishment from his job. And then mass mutual because they weren't compliant in their
4804.22s:  monitoring of compliance. They're also a problem. So yeah.
4811.26s:  W-E-T-D-C says he became a celebrity and the average person was learning to trade. We're saying the
4815.42s:  same thing. Yeah, we're saying the exact same thing there. But again, the thing that you say in the
4819.66s:  beginning is different, right? You're saying the terms he broke where that he was teaching regular
4825.58s:  people what he knew. That's not that's not the terms he broke. There's nothing in here that says
4831.34s:  Keith Gale can't teach other people what he knows. There's nothing in here that says Keith Gale
4835.66s:  can't start a YouTube channel and teach people about trading. He can do both of those things,
4840.30s:  completely fine. The terms he broke were him trading. Then his rise into popularity is what got
4852.62s:  that noticed. But it's not his rise in popularity either. That's not a term that he broke.
4861.10s:  So yeah, they're just there different things. W-E-T-D-C says you're right. I made that statement
4866.14s:  in frustration. I totally understand that. That's why I take the time to talk about these things,
4871.90s:  though, because I know that a lot of people in the GME community are just really burnt out, tired,
4877.50s:  frustrated, and stuff like that, which I understand. I really do understand. But yeah, again,
4883.98s:  my position on most things is to do my absolute best at analyzing things objectively. I can have,
4892.70s:  and I do have opinions, but the opinion is in a separate bucket than the analysis. The analysis
4899.42s:  is what it is. And remaining as objective as humanly possible, I think is super important.
4905.98s:  We're all riddled with bias, but it's easy. So this is super interesting, though.
4912.70s:  All right. So we got through the market manipulation component
4917.10s:  and there's this.
4928.30s:  All right. So I think we can get through this. How are these crazy high share prices that people
4934.46s:  say possible? This is cool. No one knows how high the squeeze could take the stock price.
4939.26s:  The best rational reasoning says that these numbers are possible through the laws of supply
4943.02s:  demand. Furthermore, it's likely that a short percentage is a lot higher than reported.
4949.26s:  See, this is interesting. This is interesting because
4963.18s:  this is a incomplete analysis, right? Realistically speaking, the reason why it's an incomplete
4971.42s:  analysis is because they're talking about the underlying function that could lead it, lead to it,
4978.46s:  which is completely fair, but this misses, this is like a theoretical perspective. It's not a
4984.94s:  practical perspective. And the reason why that matters again is the impact to the broad market
4991.50s:  still has to be considered, which is essentially exactly what happened.
4995.90s:  So then what is your short squeeze? We know this. Let's see. Basically, a bunch of institutions
5002.78s:  think a stock will fail, pile in more often than not. They do not make a lot of money. Go and notice,
5010.14s:  short squeeze can occur. Yep, that's, that's all fine. More than 100, we know that because that's
5017.98s:  straight fucking trash. Why game stop? Here we go. Short squeeze can happen anywhere. There is short
5025.50s:  interest. Game stop, however, is special case. Short sellers got extra greedy. They were sure
5030.94s:  that Game stop was going to die. So sure, in fact, they began selling naked short the stock like crazy.
5039.58s:  The other thing to know about this kind of thing is part of seller boxing, which I don't
5044.46s:  necessarily think is fully what got into place here. I think they were probably going down that path.
5050.54s:  But the really interesting thing here for my perspective is that there's a massive tax benefit.
5055.50s:  So if I'm shorting something that ends up going bankrupt, I literally get a tax benefit on the
5061.98s:  position as it's closed, which is huge. When you're talking in the millions and millions of
5066.70s:  dollars, the tax benefit itself can save you quite literally millions of fucking dollars. So this
5073.02s:  is incredible to me. And this is a really great point for them to call out.
5078.30s:  So
5080.14s:  naked shorting. I think we already know what they is who's Ryan Cohen. Yep. Chairman of Game Stop. I think we know
5089.26s:  clearly believes in Game Stop to the point. Well, the other thing to know about Ryan Cohen from
5093.42s:  what I've seen is that he absolutely is a bit of an activist investor, right? He he's talked about
5098.62s:  this before and he from what I've researched, he has a pension for looking for stuff like this
5105.26s:  and trying to intervene. So I also think that he just embodies the approach of an
5111.02s:  of activist investor, not quite a Bill Ackman because Bill Ackman and Warren Buffett have a
5118.38s:  slightly different approach, I think, but very similar in terms of like what this is. So yeah,
5123.50s:  I think this is also really cool. Catalyst. Yep. Oh, here we go. And why do people keep calling me that?
5134.62s:  What is a shell? And why do people keep calling me that? Here we go. One of the many things that
5140.38s:  hedge funds have tried to do to curb stomp retail investors is flooding our public communities with
5145.18s:  Reddit accounts. Purposely spreading some negative sentiment. Now,
5152.54s:  okay, that's what I was going to ask the proof. These accounts have been seen all over not just
5156.62s:  Reddit, but also YouTube Twitter, not just conventional social media. Anywhere you could talk about
5163.82s:  GME, the term shell is a blanket term for those accounts, then bots are people. Do we have?
5170.30s:  Do we have evidence of this? Like, is there a thing that links to like negative comment and
5175.82s:  perceived bot account? I'm super, super interested in that.
5183.26s:  Because this I fully agree and I think that this is absolutely also because if you think of it from
5188.14s:  a hedge funds perspective, if a hedge fund or some sort of institution has tons of money
5195.02s:  that's being threatened because people are starting to pool together and you want to try to disrupt
5199.74s:  that, then you can you can pay people cheap cheap to go on and start posting all sorts of shit.
5208.30s:  So I absolutely, absolutely would believe that they would do this.
5213.42s:  No doubt. So I'm just curious if we have if there's like a library of like actual accounts,
5225.10s:  where it's like somebody says some reckless shit and it's like an account that's brand new and
5229.18s:  the only thing they have in their profile is like two shitty comments towards game stop or
5234.14s:  something like that. Because to me, that would be clear as day, right? If you have accounts that are
5240.06s:  like that. John says thousands of accounts signing on simultaneously. Yeah, like, right.
5247.34s:  They're like, that's clearly like a fucking farm. So yeah, I'm just curious.
5252.70s:  Cedric says, send a link for Reddit. Let's take a look. Where'd you send it?
5262.86s:  I do not see it.
5264.30s:  Oh, you can't I don't see the link in the chat. The chat scrubs links for whatever reason. I
5271.50s:  don't know why it's super annoying. But WATDC says we started doing that, but it also per
5279.58s:  per to doxing of real people in causing them harm. I see. Yeah, that sucks. That sucks. Yeah.
5287.50s:  All right. So, uh, shills have utilized different approaches. Fud. Yep.
5295.82s:  Please, unless you really are a shill, don't take it personally.
5300.62s:  So this is good to know too, because they're identifying that there's a lot of people
5305.18s:  getting caught with strays. Short and distort time. Yep. If you have shill-based
5313.50s:  fun and how to spot it, here we go. Uh, note your potential bias. That's great.
5320.46s:  Not all fun is invalid. Some bring up a solid point against otherwise great DD that could scare you.
5327.90s:  This is great too. Remember just because you don't like what someone is saying. Does it make
5331.02s:  it invalid? That's massive. I love that. I actually don't think that most people do that
5336.54s:  based on what I've seen, but I love that as a guiding force. That's huge.
5341.18s:  Shooting this person down as the shill asks yourself the following, are they making a valid point?
5346.94s:  Is it backed up with evidence? Have I fact checked this evidence? Those are great questions too. This is great.
5352.38s:  I love this. That's really, really good.
5357.98s:  W-A-T-D-C says shills and use correctly anymore gets applied when people discrete. Yeah, that's,
5362.78s:  I kind of kind of guess that.
5370.22s:  All right. Here we go. How do I use a retail stand-a-chance against hedge funds? Here we go.
5379.18s:  Back up in terms of shares held, all short, floats, numbering around. One of the things to
5383.10s:  note, by the way, is that your job as a retail trader is not to stand against a hedge fund.
5387.42s:  There's no reason- there's no reason for that to be the case. You don't have to.
5391.10s:  I see. This is the sensitivity to weir. Us, again, separating manipulation from the technical
5403.18s:  aspects from the legal aspects. I understand that now.
5406.78s:  hedge funds in terms. This is cool. Wow. That was really enlightening for me. A lot of interesting
5413.66s:  things. Thank you guys for a lot of the information. Being able to query and understand some of the
5419.98s:  broader context is really, really helpful. It's possible we're living in a completely fraudulent system.
5425.58s:  That's funny.
5430.14s:  Citadel has no clothes. It has been fine 58 times for violating stuff. Several instances,
5435.50s:  documents as with will make it shorting. This we know. I don't think we need to read this one
5441.18s:  through. Oh, okay. So this is a great D-D. Got it. Okay. Never mind. So we will read this one all
5447.58s:  the way through. This looked to me to be pretty well known.
5458.62s:  All right. Fuck. Did it not- oh, I was going to say that's going to piss me off.
5469.74s:  Summarize the highlighted section.
5478.22s:  Sure. Take all my fucking data. I'm sure.
5487.34s:  Oh, you bastard. Let me just go to fucking chat GPT.
5496.38s:  Summarize all key point. I'm going to drop it into perplexity as well just to see what perplexity
5504.14s:  comes up with.
5519.58s:  All right. So key point summary here. I'll pull it over here for you guys.
5527.02s:  Key point summary. Citadel find a bunch of times. I think we know.
5531.66s:  It increasing short positions. Yep. Trading practices and data.
5539.82s:  Yep. Fair accounting. Yeah. So this is.
5545.02s:  Yeah. This is just saying that Citadel does exactly what you would expect Citadel to do.
5550.62s:  Which is fucking straight bullshit. Also, fun fact. The summary that chat GPT gave me is light
5558.78s:  years better than what. Perplexity gave me. Perplexity is just kind of like good for
5568.86s:  searching for stuff. It's not really good for stuff like this. I've learned.
5574.30s:  All right. So that's the overview. We can kill AI assistant because clearly it's not going
5580.70s:  to help us. And then let me zoom this in just a little bit more for you guys. All right.
5586.30s:  And then I'm told sold not yet purchased sold not yet.
5604.78s:  Yo, Adobe get your shit together. What the fuck?
5608.86s:  I'm not.
5614.54s:  Impulsive. Do you know where it is? Because apparently I can't fucking search for the terms.
5621.74s:  Does it's not in here?
5625.82s:  That's so annoying.
5630.30s:  Unless you're giving me bad scoop and it's not called that then it's not annoying and you're
5634.78s:  annoying because you're fucking sending me down a goat rope for some shit that's not there.
5639.50s:  If that's not the case of first three images. Okay. Got it. So it's near the top.
5649.90s:  First three images. Here's the first image. Okay. Security sold not yet purchased that fair value.
5655.98s:  Yep. Okay.
5658.30s:  Proving the shorts are merely future buyers. Yeah. Yeah. I think we know this though. Yeah.
5664.06s:  I don't know. This, this I think is is known that this is also
5671.42s:  building. Yeah. This is exactly what I would expect to see.
5677.02s:  Yep.
5680.38s:  This all, this all makes sense. Okay. Cool.
5688.38s:  Does this thing have a
5693.66s:  right?
5696.70s:  All right. Let's get back through here.
5703.82s:  As an industry we have a responsibility to manage risk in a way that's prudent.
5710.38s:  I mean it's objectively a fair thing to say.
5722.14s:  All right.
5724.14s:  Black rock baggold. Black rock is operating in a shadow market with citadel and bridge water.
5732.94s:  Well bridge waters is wait is bridge water affiliated with this.
5739.26s:  We're three contributing to the greatest market manipulation of all time.
5742.62s:  Head of the snake citadel is beginning to fail.
5745.34s:  Lail. I believe citadel shorted the majority of Black Rock's GME portfolio in addition to
5750.94s:  other highly shorted songs leaving Black Rock to hold the bag.
5756.62s:  What does that mean though?
5776.22s:  All right. Let's see what chat GPT says.
5781.26s:  Thank you. It's this one.
5785.02s:  I'm all right. This.
5793.50s:  All right.
5799.10s:  Citadel's believed to have shorted the majority of all of Black Rock's GME shares.
5805.90s:  What's the relationship there specifically?
5811.90s:  How is it known that citadel
5817.10s:  shorted Black Rock's GME shares?
5825.66s:  Is inferred through circumstantial evidence.
5828.62s:  I see.
5829.98s:  As it manages like Black Rock calmly lindish.
5832.70s:  Oh, I see. So just based on letting practices.
5834.62s:  Okay. That makes sense.
5835.82s:  Yep.
5843.10s:  Points to a potential rigging market through to trade practices.
5846.46s:  Okay.
5850.94s:  I'm really an asset manager relies on citadel's market making.
5856.22s:  Yep.
5860.86s:  The investigation outlines a network of influential firms operating in a way that could
5864.70s:  potentially manipulate the market for significant gain. Yeah. I think that's so fair.
5868.38s:  The main thing is that they just run the risk of being caught to different degrees.
5876.46s:  And even if they're caught to varying degrees, I don't even think they fucking care.
5880.30s:  Because the fines are in no way relatable to the overall issue. So yeah.
5895.66s:  Yeah. Okay. That one makes sense.
5899.10s:  Citadel and friends have shorted the treasury bond market to oblivion using the repo market.
5903.66s:  Citadel owns a company called Palafox trading and uses them to short-intrate treasury securities.
5911.98s:  Exclusively part here is a little interesting because it's very common for companies like this to
5919.02s:  specialize. So I don't know if this seems like it they think it's a bigger deal than it probably is.
5927.50s:  Palafox managers, one fund for Citadel. Yeah.
5933.82s:  Or owned by offshore investors in the Cayman Islands that also is just a tax and security shelter.
5940.70s:  So that makes sense. The reverse reprogramments are entirely re-pothecated and then they cannot
5948.46s:  pay off their own repo agreements until someone pays them first. Oh, interesting.
5957.82s:  This is interesting.
5963.26s:  All right, let's see what this is.
5973.58s:  The only issue I see with this is like the bond market is one of the biggest, most liquid markets
5986.46s:  on the world, like literally in the world. So I do struggle a little bit with the theory that
5994.70s:  they're using either sofa or the bond market as a relationship.
5999.02s:  Some arise. Because even somebody that's at a place like Black Rock or Citadel, they're massive.
6013.98s:  They have massive influence, but they still are not like able to fully control the something like
6019.50s:  the bond market.
6022.78s:  Alinzo says, I don't know if you went over to this. The point of DIRSing, the shares is to get a total
6026.70s:  kind of shares owned by retail. This way we could say we own the whole float. So where are they getting
6031.18s:  the shares to short? I see. I mean, I don't see how that's possible.
6041.02s:  Simply because institutions are still going to own some of them anyways.
6044.38s:  Citadel through some citrary gauges. Yet we just read that.
6060.54s:  The global fix. Yep. Okay.
6067.58s:  Repo market dynamics. Repo reverse repo. Essential for liquidity. Yes.
6073.02s:  Realize on rehab application where collateral is reused for multiple transactions. Yep.
6080.22s:  It cannot settle repo agreements without incoming payments. Okay.
6091.10s:  Pelifox access Citadel's market maker for repost supporting their massive short position.
6097.18s:  We're relying on re-hypothicated assets to cover obligations.
6107.18s:  Instances where repo rates dipped below negative three suggests this extreme desperation for
6113.50s:  treasury bonds that can to short squeezes in the stock market.
6119.50s:  I don't think this makes sense.
6127.66s:  Yeah. I don't really think this makes sense.
6136.86s:  FICC holds 47 billion in deposits for unsettled treasury transactions.
6143.66s:  Sign of systemic streams. Citadel's high exposure to derivatives. Lack of lot of positions.
6150.14s:  Depending on baritess, it's set up potential risks. That's fair. I mean, they will have
6156.70s:  so many circuit breakers and hedges in place. But yeah. Yeah. The reason why this doesn't make
6163.26s:  sense is just because you're like, you're not going to see a squeeze in the bond market.
6168.06s:  Same thing with the repo market. It's just it's too liquid. It's literally, I think it literally
6177.34s:  might be the most liquid market in the world. Let's see.
6187.50s:  Yeah.
6193.50s:  All that other says, yeah, let's bully chat GPT. Wait, what am I supposed to ask it?
6197.18s:  Oh, for a fact check. Yeah. And you fact check these.
6205.66s:  You fact check each of these.
6207.58s:  Let's see.
6226.30s:  Yep. So this is just saying that this is normal stuff.
6229.66s:  Yep. So it talks about the function of that. Yes. This.
6241.90s:  Yep.
6245.34s:  Hedge funds may take short positions in teabonds based on expectations of interest rates. However,
6250.46s:  the claim that hedge funds have shorter the treasury bar market to oblivion is an exaggeration.
6254.62s:  Definitely. Well, short positions exist. They're part of diverse trade. Yeah, I agree with this.
6259.58s:  I think again, like to to be in a position to even try to do that is really, really extreme.
6270.78s:  Yeah. Okay. So that I think that checks out.
6277.26s:  And then I want to ask you one more.
6285.58s:  Some arise. The key takeaways from the post.
6298.46s:  I wonder if there's anything.
6302.94s:  Well, word looking.
6304.62s:  Lino says this would expose all the synthetics in a cover synthetic shares you need to buy real
6315.82s:  shares and that would drive price up of no one sells supply and demand price goes up until they sell.
6323.26s:  Well, price doesn't go up and supply and demand until they sell inherently, right? You need more
6330.14s:  people buying because if you have a system where there's nobody buying, then price doesn't move.
6337.34s:  It's impossible for price to be bid up if nobody is buying it. So there needs to be an element of
6343.42s:  liquidity. Otherwise, there's there's no transaction. So yeah.
6349.66s:  But
6357.50s:  hold on the rest of you said the loan, they loan the same shares over and over again,
6360.78s:  multiply hundreds of millions and the FedEx, your millions and shares out in the well. Yeah,
6363.82s:  definitely. And they they abuse that system. No, no, no debate there at all.
6373.10s:  Yo, yo, yo, rollo says, but then margin calls. Wait, margin calls for what? I don't know where
6379.74s:  the margin calls for buy and for what? You're talking about the scenario of the synthetic shorts and
6387.02s:  then the covering? Just so I know if I'm looking at the right thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what I'm,
6397.98s:  I was just again, very specific points that I make when I look at this stuff. The point that I'm
6404.22s:  making is that if all shares are de-rest, 100% of the float is locked up. And then we've identified
6413.82s:  all of these naked shorts, but nobody is selling. If nobody is selling their shares,
6420.30s:  right? Because they're all locked up. There are no shares for anybody to buy. If there's nobody
6427.02s:  buying anything, price doesn't go up. People have to buy in order to bid price up. So I'm just
6436.46s:  saying that that would come at a, there's a, there's an impasse in that scenario.
6445.42s:  Yo, yo, yo, rollo says, what if there's one share? So it's a great, it's a great example. So
6452.14s:  impulsive says, but one share can sell at one million and the price is one million. It potentially,
6457.26s:  right? But in the, like the theoretical doesn't work in a practical sense. I'll start it with that.
6464.78s:  So acknowledging that we're talking about a theoretical that wouldn't play out in a practical
6469.58s:  sense, that one share would be bought at the first available price. So a seller could say,
6478.38s:  I'm willing to sell this one share for one million dollars. If there's only one share available,
6486.38s:  and there's no more shares on the order book, then there's still no liquidity. That one share
6493.90s:  isn't going to offset anybody's position. So again, from a practical sense in the hypothetical
6499.74s:  scenario, that one share would do nothing for them. It doesn't matter. You need liquidity. Otherwise,
6506.38s:  there's literally no reason for the transactions.
6513.18s:  So yeah. All right, so back to this.
6522.06s:  Walk in like a duck, talk in like a duck. I like the name of this one.
6527.98s:  I have prepared a case which strongly indicates that Citadel securities are committing securities fraud.
6536.54s:  Okay. I don't really feel super. I don't think that this is a massive one for us to read
6543.34s:  unless you guys do because like it, there's nothing in here that I would openly debate.
6553.18s:  I am sure that different kinds of institutions like that are committing securities fraud.
6558.22s:  And I don't think that it actually impacts that much. So yeah.
6566.38s:  The reason why I say it doesn't impact much is just because until there's enforcement,
6571.26s:  it doesn't really, it doesn't really move the needle.
6578.14s:  Okay. I think this is one of the ones that you guys said that we had to read, right? A house of
6581.90s:  cards. Am I, am I remembering correctly? I think you guys were saying that this was a big one.
6591.82s:  The DTC has been taken over by big money. They transitioned from a manual to computerize ledger,
6596.22s:  80s. And it played a significant role in 87 crash. In 03, several issuers with DTC wanted to remove
6606.06s:  their securities from DTC's deposit because the DTC process pins were naked short. So on their
6610.62s:  securities turns out they were right. Okay. The DTC and its participants have created a market-sized
6616.86s:  naked short scaling scheme. Okay, this is very interesting. So I'm going to drop this in first.
6623.34s:  We'll read through this one specifically, but I just want to drop it in for a summary to start.
6641.34s:  Right. Let's grab GPD.
6648.46s:  A WTTC says I don't think 100% DRS will ever happen. I mean, again, I don't like speaking in
6655.42s:  absolutes. So could it theoretically occur? It could. Is it in any sense of probability going to
6663.02s:  occur? No. The reason why the answer is exceedingly unlikely is because there are people. There are
6671.18s:  institutions that already have the shares. So as long as those institutions maintain the shares,
6679.18s:  then there's no way to achieve 100% DRS. So it would require institutions choosing to unwind their
6686.70s:  shares for whatever position, whatever reason. And I'm sure some of them would over time. But it's
6693.10s:  like you can't buy something that somebody isn't selling.
6705.18s:  Impulsive says only need to DRS float, not outstanding. Okay, because again, that's different.
6710.22s:  And I agree with you. I think looking at something like float outstanding is a difference scenario.
6717.26s:  And I think focusing on that is absolutely achievable in a theoretical and a practical sense.
6723.42s:  It's difficult to do, but achievable. But yeah, I was just responding to the comment of like 100% DRS.
6734.06s:  Okay. So we know this stuff from DTC have been accused of facilitating large scale naked short
6740.78s:  selling where the shares are sold without being barred or delivered highlighted in 03 when multiple
6746.30s:  issuers sought to withdraw their securities from the DTC, suspecting the participants were naked
6750.94s:  shorting their stocks. Seed and co a DTC and Roli holds the master's certificate of shares when shares
6758.62s:  are deposited, they issue IOUs instead of moving the actual certificates, centralizing control and
6765.02s:  potentially enabling the re-ipotentation of shares for future transactions.
6773.02s:  Okay. Oh, three issuers petition DTC tell them to withdraw their securities due to concerns over
6781.18s:  participants shorting the stocks, which could harm the value. Right. DTC proposed SR that rule
6788.78s:  effectively blocked issuers from retrieving their securities, leaving a widespread concern.
6795.98s:  Historical records and finra reports indicate consistent violations by DTC participants such as
6803.90s:  failing to report short sale transactions accurately over reporting short interest. Okay.
6812.78s:  DTC structures allows participants, primarily large institutions, significant control over
6819.10s:  deposited securities, potentially enabling market manipulation agreed. Yeah. So this is obviously
6827.02s:  highlighting the seeding codes really lack of transparency in their approach in the fucking IOU
6835.82s:  system. So back, back, all, sections. Yeah, that's fucking, that's madness.
6849.10s:  Fact, fact, fact, fact.
6855.42s:  Yeah. Yeah.
6860.62s:  Document cases short sale violations involving market major institutions. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
6873.66s:  Yeah. Okay. Interesting. All right. So let's scan through this now.
6879.18s:  Yeah.
6887.18s:  This is the cool shit to me. The fact that fucking retail traders have taken the time to sit down
6896.70s:  and get into this stuff is fucking fascinating. I have to scan through kind of quick though,
6902.06s:  because my dinner's getting here right now. Yep. So we already went through all this stuff.
6913.82s:  Many analysts blame these computer trading large institutions. Yes.
6923.98s:  So this is just talking about the impact of computerized trading and algorithms.
6932.54s:  Yeah.
6937.10s:  Computers,
6938.78s:  dictated more and more features. Be sold, buyers, those features,
6942.06s:  insist to shut up a little prices. Oh, interesting.
6953.58s:  Risk appetite. Yep. Yep.
6962.38s:  So they wanted to pull their shares out, which we know.
6973.34s:  Bigger deal when word got around that the proposed rule changed. Interesting.
6981.66s:  Recently, a number of issue or securities have independently requested that DTC with draw
6985.34s:  from the deposits, sort of securities by them. As explained in further detail by many,
6990.30s:  the commenters opposing DTC's proposal, the issuers have made these requirements alleged that
6994.78s:  their securities have been target of manipulative short sellers. That's nuts.
7006.62s:  Dear Senator Lieberman, my firm represents FST shares traded on the NASD OTC,
7013.98s:  Bolton board. We're writing to enlist your support of our request to the SEC to conduct an
7019.02s:  investigation in negative short selling of shares of small cap companies on the OTCB. That's
7023.82s:  awesome. That's absolutely awesome.
7034.46s:  The rules should not be passed because by permitting the settlement of so-called shares by
7038.38s:  traders not holding share certificates, DTC itself to be incompetent to uphold the law and
7044.38s:  stop. That's awesome. So there's a lot of people coming out unhappy with them. That's red.
7061.26s:  Ultimately, migrate to T plus one. All that stuff's already updated.
7075.82s:  So, I mean, this obviously highlights a massive loss and trust of DTC.
7081.82s:  That's massively, massively, massively impacted here.
7090.94s:  And this also really launched a lot of the conversation around naked shorting, which is huge.
7096.46s:  Like, absolutely, absolutely critical. This is awesome. How's the cards part two? I need to bookmark
7104.14s:  this one. The fuck do I bookmark? Right click. Nope, don't want to crop.
7121.58s:  Nope. I just want to bookmark.
7139.42s:  How do you bookmark?
7145.50s:  Damn.
7151.58s:  Well, anyways, I will fucking figure out how to bookmark this thing. There it is.
7161.66s:  Oh, I see. So it's already, it's already flagged. I see. Yeah. So let me highlight this.
7168.94s:  And we'll pick up from here. Super interesting.
7174.38s:  All right, gang. I'm going to go eat some dinner. Super awesome hanging out.
7178.30s:  Tomorrow, I'll probably do a live stream before I do the outlier pro live stream. Later in the day,
7184.30s:  I'll kind of set up a time for all that. And then, yeah, if you guys need anything, hit me up in
7189.98s:  the discord, be an outlier, be an ape, be an outlier, ape, whatever applies to you. And I'll catch you
7194.86s:  guys later.
