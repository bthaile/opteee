0.88s: hey everyone eric here made a handful of
3.12s: adjustments
3.84s: in the small stacks portfolio yesterday
6.56s: so
7.68s: um i'm going to share those here and
10.40s: then the other thing i was actually just
11.92s: thinking about is kind of defining
14.40s: the time frame for the portfolio because
17.92s: although it is entertaining and you know
21.04s: educational for this
22.56s: essentially this forum um i do not
25.68s: intend to do it into perpetuity just
28.00s: because it's not really
29.36s: the best use of my time for myself
33.36s: so as of right now i'm thinking of
35.92s: pretty much doing it for a year
37.52s: which would take us till around 1
39.12s: september of next year
40.80s: but if anybody has any thoughts on that
42.48s: let me know i don't want to
44.32s: you know cut the segment short if you
46.16s: know folks are finding it helpful but
48.32s: i also am thoughtful in the fact that
52.56s: it's helpful for folks but like i said
55.36s: not really the best use of my personal
57.12s: time so
58.08s: we'll um right now that's what i'll plan
60.08s: to unless you know there's some sort of
61.76s: uproar
62.56s: or somebody has a better approach you
64.56s: know i would be receptive to it
66.88s: okay so that part aside let's take a
69.92s: look
70.32s: at the um the portfolio so
73.68s: i took down my trade in mosaic yesterday
76.72s: most of these trades were done yesterday
78.72s: the reason being is just with today
81.12s: being election
82.08s: i anticipated a bit of volatility so
85.52s: pretty much across most of my portfolios
87.68s: i was just
88.64s: closing stuff down yesterday and then
91.12s: planning on reestablishing
93.20s: um you know minor exposure yesterday
96.48s: but really i wanted to make sure i was
99.20s: repositioning
100.00s: things before we went into the election
102.88s: just because
104.32s: didn't know obviously which way the
106.56s: market was going to react still don't
108.16s: know
109.28s: right now it's 1825 pacific time so
113.60s: we'll see but with all that being said i
116.48s: wanted to make sure that
118.24s: everything was kind of adjusted before
121.44s: today and then we'll kind of see what
123.52s: things look like going forward so
125.60s: i figured that we would start with the
127.04s: macro view so
130.48s: i realize i got to move my head again so
133.44s: now we'll go down here
135.76s: and actually i think we can go bottom
137.92s: left because the next one this is going
139.52s: to be in the way
140.56s: okay and then let me just slide this
142.56s: over
143.84s: all right so for
147.36s: mosaic that got closed out
150.48s: for 59 cents yesterday and
153.76s: that took in a p l
157.44s: which was about a 34 capture of premium
161.68s: overall i still like mosaic
164.72s: i didn't want to hold it through
166.24s: earnings so
167.76s: as soon as i saw an opportunity to exit
170.88s: the
171.68s: trade yesterday i dumped out of it
175.44s: just because i wanted to minimize my
177.76s: exposure to kind of the move and then
179.52s: the subsequent
180.72s: follow-on follow-through potential which
183.04s: if we take a look at it real quick
185.12s: it was a good thing i did that and it's
188.08s: another
188.64s: example of why i talk about
192.40s: being purposeful when offering exposure
195.76s: so they reported yesterday after the
198.16s: close and as you can tell today had a
200.00s: pretty big
200.72s: red day so my intention with that trade
204.24s: leading into earnings
207.76s: was to capitalize on the increased
211.20s: volatility which we see
212.88s: it trading at
216.08s: 90 cents when i put the trade on and
219.20s: then
220.32s: before the close yesterday i was able to
222.96s: exit the trade
224.08s: and i would look to revisit it um
227.44s: but the reason why i didn't again is
229.28s: because i don't want to mess with it
231.44s: post earnings as it's settling out
234.48s: this was not really an earnings play
237.20s: depending on the
238.24s: trade ran through i was willing to hold
240.80s: it through earnings but that wasn't the
242.16s: original disposition so
244.00s: i wanted to limit that now
247.04s: in its place i took up bank of america
250.64s: and again yesterday i offered the
253.92s: 20 nov 24 puts
257.12s: at a dollar 22. now this was
260.40s: a super advantageous trade i was between
263.92s: xlf and bank of america and
267.44s: it's because they're trading right
268.56s: around the same level and this is a good
270.96s: conversation
272.16s: about premium and
275.36s: even though xlf was returning over a
278.32s: percent
278.96s: which is good for an etf
282.24s: bank of america was obviously returning
285.76s: well over that
286.72s: so that's why i took my money to really
289.84s: where the trade was
291.52s: and i was hesitant to get long here but
294.56s: obviously it had a bit of a gap up today
297.28s: that i intend to watch
299.04s: very closely because it's still early in
301.68s: the life cycle of the trade otherwise i
303.36s: would love to close it here
304.96s: but it's really not showing any sort of
306.80s: meaningful profit just yet
308.88s: um but we'll monitor that one as we go
313.84s: really the purpose of that trade was to
315.52s: capture that that premium it was
317.04s: significant
318.00s: and for the buying power that i was
320.80s: putting out there it
322.00s: represents a really really good return
324.32s: which is what
325.12s: lured me into that trade and i liked
328.64s: adding some financial exposure so that's
330.96s: why that's there
332.64s: okay now moving over to the diagonals
337.12s: um let me take this one down and open
339.84s: this one up
340.40s: okay so taking a look at these in kroger
344.00s: if
344.48s: you'll remember from the last couple of
346.80s: videos
347.84s: i took down the short calls
351.12s: but i didn't offer any new exposure and
354.24s: it's just because i was kind of waiting
355.60s: for a little while to see
357.36s: what the product did and
360.56s: it was trading sideways for a little
362.00s: while and then today
364.16s: with its recent kind of move
367.28s: up i decided to offer a little bit of
369.68s: exposure in there
371.28s: and the reason for that is i just didn't
373.68s: want to not be taking in premium for too
376.40s: long
377.12s: so that's why i offered kind of a
379.20s: partial here it's still at a one to two
381.04s: ratio so my upside is not capped
383.76s: but i sent out the 18 december 35
387.36s: calls collecting 65 cents which is
390.48s: around a 30 delta the leaps themselves
393.92s: right now are losing
395.28s: um they're definitely not where i want
398.72s: them to be but
399.60s: it's overall still not too bad of a
402.40s: position
403.60s: the un unrealized loss on those is about
407.76s: 380 dollars
409.76s: compared to the the current leap but we
412.32s: have 288
413.44s: realized profit on the short calls and
415.84s: then we still have an additional 65
418.32s: out from the new outlay if we see
421.60s: a little bit more of an up move i will
423.60s: happily offer the second call
425.76s: to make this at a one-to-one so i could
427.84s: essentially exit the entire trade at a
429.76s: profit
430.56s: but we'll see what it looks like i like
433.44s: scaling in with the short calls
435.68s: just so i can be more sensitive to price
437.52s: movements and kind of collect a little
438.96s: bit more premium
440.16s: when the opportunity presents itself
442.48s: next up is
443.44s: intel so intel this was another pretty
447.20s: simple trade
449.52s: i was watching it for a little while
451.92s: simply because
453.76s: i was showing over a 50 max profit
458.56s: pretty much you know for a few days
460.80s: since i put this thing on
462.84s: and once it started
466.24s: hovering around here and then i started
468.72s: saw it start making a little bit of an
470.48s: up move
471.60s: that's when i wanted to make the
473.36s: adjustments so
474.72s: i closed out the 47
478.32s: calls i sold them for 1.65 i took them
481.28s: down for 74 cents
483.36s: and that brought out a realized profit
487.12s: of 91 bucks on that and then i offered
490.48s: the 20 no 47 calls
494.40s: and i got 56 cents for those now i want
497.04s: to
497.76s: offer an important note on this
501.04s: i typically would not have closed
504.32s: those four d's 47 calls
507.92s: if there was 74 dollars left on the
510.32s: table
510.96s: when i was only getting 56 dollars for
513.52s: the new position
514.48s: right because that essentially means
515.92s: there's 20 20
517.76s: little s 18 in the
521.12s: position i was taking down more than
523.20s: what i just put on
524.80s: the reason why i did this is because
528.08s: the early expiration 20 nov
531.20s: so it offers me a little more
533.28s: sensitivity
534.64s: to more recent price change and
537.76s: it's a obviously as soon as you start
540.08s: moving closer
541.12s: days to expiration your premium per day
543.52s: automatically increases
545.44s: so it has a higher premium per day but
547.84s: the real thing that i was looking for
549.52s: here
550.40s: is although it is a slightly lower
553.60s: overall return it is
556.88s: in um in the scale of things going to
559.60s: give me more money per day than what i
561.60s: had left
563.04s: in the 47s that i had before so it was a
566.08s: way for me to realize that profit
568.56s: and then take a look at something
571.68s: that will um that will offer me a little
574.64s: more sensitivity
576.00s: for whatever comes next
579.36s: for intel one of those
582.56s: being the dividend coming out on the
585.60s: fifth which will knock price down
587.44s: again which is another potential for me
590.88s: to
591.28s: take those calls down at a partial
593.52s: profit depending on what that looks like
595.92s: but we'll have to wait and see what that
598.48s: um what that turns out to be for us
601.12s: so overall going back out to the
604.64s: macro somebody was asking about the net
606.88s: lick for the portfolio so
608.80s: i don't typically track this and i don't
610.48s: intend to going forward but just to
612.16s: answer that question
613.60s: right now it's sitting at around 5 500
615.52s: bucks which is
617.36s: a little bit lower obviously than the
620.16s: realized
621.52s: p l but you know totally okay with me i
624.64s: prefer to track the realized p
626.08s: l that's what's most important to me in
628.08s: a portfolio like this
629.92s: but nonetheless again wanted to answer
631.92s: that question so right now it's looking
633.12s: like 5500 or so
635.04s: and that's mostly coming from kroger
638.40s: the leaps hurting in there they're down
640.64s: almost 380. so that's where the majority
642.56s: of that's coming from
644.32s: all right so right now when we look at
646.56s: the portfolio
647.84s: utilizations at 4 800 which is around 80
651.20s: utilized um we've made about a thousand
654.08s: dollars on the account which is
655.60s: pretty solid return it's 17 since i
658.56s: started this on the first of september
661.04s: the vast majority of profit is still
663.52s: coming from the diagonals
665.52s: and right now there is 243
669.04s: in premium out in the market which would
671.36s: be about a 4
672.24s: return on the account now the last thing
675.12s: that i want to
676.48s: note is this is absolutely a time
680.40s: that i'm going to start looking at
682.48s: volatility products
684.56s: as we see volatility starting to recede
687.36s: back leading
688.32s: into the election especially if things
691.68s: start
692.00s: getting weird tomorrow meaning you know
695.60s: we don't know who wins that kind of
697.44s: thing they're starting to recount
699.20s: fighting over that
700.88s: as soon as i start seeing anything like
702.64s: that happening i will
704.08s: absolutely buy some vxx calls
707.68s: just to take attempt to take advantage
710.88s: of an
711.20s: uptick in volatility on the cheap so
714.80s: i'm gonna keep an eye for that overnight
717.20s: and realistically this will be one of
719.28s: those scenarios
720.96s: that i may end up playing it in my
723.92s: margin account via futures
726.16s: but i will do my best to mirror that in
729.68s: this account
730.88s: just because i think that that may
733.04s: provide a good opportunity to make a few
735.20s: bucks
736.32s: so all in all that's where we're at with
738.16s: the small stacks account as always if
739.84s: there's any questions or feedback
741.28s: anything that people want to see let me
742.96s: know that is the entire purpose
745.44s: of the channel um we'll
748.48s: see what the market looks like curious
750.24s: how the week is going to play out
752.00s: and we'll talk to everybody later
