0.00s: Losses that haunt me, options trading wiped out my savings.
6.08s: Who else?
7.52s: This is a post on Reddit from a appropriately named person, I quit options, which is probably
14.84s: fair.
15.84s: And I thought this post was really interesting and worth diving into because this highlights
22.48s: a couple really important points.
25.00s: But more importantly, I want to talk to you about how you can avoid this.
30.44s: This is entirely avoidable and it's not that difficult to avoid.
35.88s: It simply requires having a plan and thinking through methods to become successful at trading.
44.52s: However, there's some absolutely vital steps that have to be taken that I want to talk
49.64s: about.
50.64s: So first, let's just talk about this in the context.
54.16s: I'm grabbing my drawing pad because we're going to need a couple examples as we work through
59.72s: this.
60.56s: The first thing is, I don't know how to start this.
62.68s: I'm 42X banker and pretty good with money or so I thought.
66.04s: This part sticks out to me and it's because of, they're not saying this, they're, but it's
71.56s: a common assumption and it's the appeal to authority.
76.84s: Lots of people will take somebody's position and their status and not weigh the thought
84.84s: action activities by themselves.
88.08s: And again, they're extremely humble here, right?
91.56s: I'm not saying they're saying this, but it's very common where people will think like,
95.60s: oh, somebody works within the finance industry, air go, they're going to be a good trader.
102.28s: And it's just patently false.
106.24s: And if we take a look at that and just click in a little bit, if we compare institutional
113.12s: investing slash trading and we compare that against retail, there are a litany of very
120.80s: important differences between the two.
123.88s: It summarizes that institution and institutional trading have a lot of baked in edge and structural
133.12s: advantages available to them.
136.72s: That's not available on the retail trading side.
139.72s: And the fun fact is when you become a retail trader, you have to wear a lot of different
144.68s: hats.
145.68s: One of the big things that sticks out to me here is risk oversight, dedicated risk management
150.80s: departments predefined firm wide risk limits.
154.12s: There are literally, and this is actually used to be a not prestigious position that became
158.48s: a very prestigious position to become.
160.88s: And it's because it is so important to the success of an institution.
165.52s: Well, as a retail trader, you are that for you.
169.96s: And as you could tell from our friend here, they clearly don't have good risk control in
178.96s: place.
180.24s: And this is really simple to begin with as a trader because there's only one point in
185.88s: time you can ever fully control the risk of a trade and it's when you enter it.
191.16s: That means you're defining your risk based on the size of the position.
194.60s: And this still applies to undefined risk trades.
197.16s: You can still roughly define your risk based on the size that you put on or capping with
202.00s: a wing or something like that.
204.20s: So let's continue.
205.56s: I got into options trading during the pandemic happened to a lot of people.
209.24s: What started as something casual turned into a daily obsession, this is also good or bad.
213.96s: It can be both.
214.96s: It was an obsession for me as well.
216.20s: And you kind of need a certain level of obsession to learn this stuff.
219.64s: So I don't weigh that either way.
222.08s: It's all myself.
223.08s: I was being strategic, but I was really just chasing dopamine and losses.
226.80s: It's actually quite self aware.
228.64s: And this is very, very common.
230.52s: There are a lot of research papers on this topic of sensation seeking.
236.76s: This is a little bit of an older paper.
240.60s: It's from 2006.
242.48s: It's called sensation seeking overconfidence and trading activity.
245.16s: It talks about this exact thing where traders very frequently will exhibit and display
249.28s: this kind of behavior.
250.28s: Well, we're just looking for this sensation of winning, making good trades and stuff like
256.88s: that.
257.88s: All things that unfortunately run contrary to building a solid foundational approach,
262.48s: which we'll talk about.
263.48s: Fast forward to now.
264.48s: And now I've lost over 88, whatever this metric is, looks like 88 million of whatever
271.68s: that currency is.
272.84s: It looks like they're Indian in two years.
276.04s: Didn't happen all at once.
277.32s: Small losses turned into bigger ones.
279.72s: Few wins gave me false confidence kept adding capital.
282.84s: Probably self make it back.
284.32s: This is called revenge trading standard avoidant behavior that you don't want.
288.68s: I ignored red flags.
289.68s: Hit it from my family convinced myself one trade away from fixing it all.
293.12s: That's gambler's fallacy.
295.56s: And so let's let's talk about what happened here.
299.04s: This is just an utter and complete breakdown in process.
303.68s: So what ends up happening is you go through your learning phases as a trader.
307.20s: There's an important thing called the Dunning Kruger effect.
310.28s: And it's after you go through you learn a bit and you start to feel confident in what
315.04s: you've learned.
316.28s: And then all of a sudden, you tend to make a mistake or a series of mistakes like they
321.24s: did.
322.24s: And then you end up down here, which is where they are.
324.48s: Then you typically have a choice.
326.24s: You can either kind of embrace the work that needs to be done and continue on your way.
330.80s: Or you just pivot into buy and hold investing, which a lot of people ultimately do.
335.48s: It makes sense for a lot of people.
337.52s: The cool part is this trial of despair doesn't need to come with the significant loss of
343.60s: capital provided that you have some very, very basic controls in your portfolio.
349.52s: So the first thing we need to talk about is circuit breakers.
353.24s: Circuit breakers.
354.56s: Really simple.
355.56s: And it's the same thing that you see in the standard market funny enough, which is if we
361.36s: have a portfolio of whatever some of money, let's call it a hundred K, whatever you feel
365.76s: like.
367.16s: What you do is you start by planning how you're going to use this portfolio.
372.04s: These are thinking through things like desired return and then risk tolerance.
382.22s: Then what you do is you start shaping what the portfolio can look like.
388.20s: And I have a bunch of videos that talk about the concepts of implementation of a portfolio,
392.80s: but it boils down to figuring out how many trades you need to put on in order to hit your
396.94s: desired return target and then making sure that those trades all composite fall within
404.38s: a risk tolerance.
405.38s: And there's one way you can ensure they do by adding a circuit breaker.
409.54s: So this effectively says if the portfolio loses more than X percent, whatever that percent
416.06s: is, that you will then begin closing positions because it means something is gone drastically
422.98s: wrong.
423.98s: You can't just pick a random number because it needs to be fit to the strategies that
430.70s: you're running and the size of the portfolio and the kind of things that you're doing.
434.06s: So the way that we figure out a circuit breaker is by literally analyzing the strategies,
438.66s: the average PNL, the average drawdown for our strategies and then arriving at this number.
443.06s: And if you're thinking, wow, that sounds like something I haven't done yet.
445.86s: It's the point.
446.86s: This is the work that needs to be done in order to make logical decisions as a trader.
451.38s: And this is also the work that needs to be done to avoid this fate.
458.30s: This is exactly how you don't do this is by doing this kind of work.
463.74s: The other thing is by integrating a simple feedback mechanism.
468.50s: So if we take a look, this is just an example strategy.
471.54s: This is looking at an iron condor and it's just looking at some summary stats.
475.14s: We're saying that we had 90 trades closed.
478.98s: There's no open trades right now.
480.10s: The PNL for the strategy is $130,000, average PNL, all these different metrics.
486.10s: Notice how all of these metrics are here.
488.82s: And notice how it's organized in the context of an individual strategy.
493.38s: Notice how this would otherwise be tied into what the individual trades being built out
505.06s: are down here.
506.98s: So what that means is instead of this sample being 90, it's going to start at zero.
513.46s: And then it's going to go to one and it's going to go to two, three, four, five, so on
518.58s: and so forth.
519.82s: So what that means is as you're inputting all of these individual trades into your trade
525.26s: log, which you need to have that's broken down by strategy, which is not difficult to
529.38s: do.
530.38s: I have videos that talk about that.
531.62s: You just got to start.
533.74s: What ends up happening is as you're getting additional data points for your strategy,
538.62s: if you see these summary statistics not behaving properly, it tells you you have a problem
545.86s: with your strategy and you have to do something to fix it.
550.30s: This process is how you explicitly avoid doing this where we just keep adding money into
561.06s: the account.
562.18s: We slowly keep putting more and more in because we think that we're really close to fixing
567.78s: it.
568.78s: Well, if you look at your trade log and you see the strategies or the compilation of your
572.50s: strategies is not working, then you don't feel this way.
576.30s: The only reason why you would feel this way is if you're ignorant to those details because
579.94s: you don't have them.
581.54s: So this sucks.
583.30s: This happens all the time.
584.54s: It happens to most, but the cool part is it is completely avoidable and it's avoidable
590.70s: in those ways that I described.
592.46s: By first, creating a plan for the portfolio, by second, planning through the way you're
597.82s: going to implement in defining things like your return target and your risk metrics that
603.86s: you're comfortable with, making sure that they make sense against one another.
607.94s: And then by creating an iterative process that allows you to implement an idea that's
613.66s: well researched, to validate what's happening as you get real time data based on your performance,
619.98s: and then you can optimize it.
621.34s: You can completely circumnavigate all of this simply if you do the work.
626.38s: You know what I'll tell you later.
