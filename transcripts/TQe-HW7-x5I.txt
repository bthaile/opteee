 option box spreads. I'm going to walk you through what they are, how I use them, why they might be useful for your toolkit because for me specifically, these are actually an important part of what I do and namely because a lot of the strategies that I use like the coverage strangle, the diagonal they unlocked leverage and one of the ways you can capitalize on the leverage is putting the money to use that is otherwise scheduled for those other strategies as I listed them. So I'm going to walk you through the strategy first and then give you a couple examples on how I like to use them and then finally the management of the strategy. So what's up everybody Eric here welcome backs all the all ours. Let's get right to it. So the very first thing what is an option box spread? Well realistically the reason why we use this is it's a way to arbitrage the risk free rate from the market. And if you don't know what arbitrage means, it's essentially way for us to guarantee a profit with no risk. And there are instances that you can do it, but notice how I say V at the risk free rate. The reason why that part is important is because there's not this magical trade that you're finding that just gives you free money. This is just a essential way to either loan money to the market or get money from the market. Be up alone. So we'll talk about that in a little bit. It is a high collateral and low reward style trade. It's exactly what you would expect for any other risk free trade. If you look at what you can get in the market, you can see that it's not going to be a good thing to do. You can get what you can get in bonds. It's essentially the same thing. So I typically use these, like I said, when I have money set aside for something like a coverage strangle. And that kind of thing essentially requires a bunch of money for me to be able to buy shares at some point in time. It's super inefficient to have that money just sitting there not doing anything at all. Or still being exposed to inflation, whether it's high, like it is right now, relatively speaking or low. And there's an opportunity cost for that money. So this is a way for me to put that money to use while I'm still kind of using it for other things. And I'll talk about the timing in that just second. This is overall a delta neutral trade, meaning we don't care which way the market goes whatsoever. And the hallmark of this is we need to make sure that the trade is put on where the expiration value is greater than the premium rate, the premium paid. So what is the structure of the strategy? Well, really it's just a debit put spread plus a debit call spread and a walk you through what that looks like in just a second, but there are a couple important notes up front. The very first thing you have to use European options. Let me reinforce that point. You have to use European options. If you do not use European options, the risk of early assignment exists. And there's a dude on Reddit that lost a whole bunch of money lost like $50,000 to a box spread in UVXY. Because he thought he was smart and his thesis was decent. The product was completely wrong. You need to not be at risk of early assignment. So don't use American options, use European options. And really the product I use the most for this is the SPX keeps it simple. And that also answers the second point here, which is liquidity. You got to have liquidity in this trade. One of the things that eats this trade alive more than anything are fees. If you have high commission cost large bit asks spreads. This is a very difficult strategy to use with any amount of efficacy. So as you can tell here, we're talking about the concept of arbitrage. Any time there's a potential risk free return. You would better believe everybody and their mother is interested in it. So that means that the margins are very low. If you have high cost, that's a problem. You're going to eat away at any of the potential rewards you have available to you. So we need to be mindful of costs. And then the last thing timing is variable. You can do that's one of my favorite things about these kinds of trades is you can deploy them in all different kinds of time frames. So for example, if we look at the SPX here, you can see all these different explorations. And right now I have a box spread out in 17 March. This started as an 18 days to expiration trade, which I'm going to walk through this whole trade in its entirety for the example. But you can essentially establish box spreads wherever you want. But you got to make sure that it's liquid. So a lot of times you're going to find the best liquidity in the monthly explorations. That's just a function of where most people put their money. But you can essentially pick any time frame that you want. And that's actually one of the most important parts of the way that I deploy the strategy is because it's typically saved to a broader strategy that I'm using. And I need to be more careful about the timing of this because I need the capital to be available for the other trade. Now one last note is if you are long the box spread or long the box, you are loaning money means you're paying money, but going to get more back at expiration. And then if you're short the box spread, it means you're borrowing money. You're going to get money upfront, but then you're going to have to pay back the principal and then the interest at the end of the trade come expiration. So what does this look like? Well, this is the like a just said, this is the trade I just showed you. And this is a long call spread and a long put spread. It's got to be the same expiration and the same strikes. So if you look at the example trade down here, I am. Long the 4,000 calls. I am short the 5,000 calls. I am then short the 4,000 puts and then I am long the 5,000 puts. So essentially the way that this trade works is you are going to pay a debit out and then you are going to get more back. So what does this look like when I first put this trade on it was 18 days to expiration. So a little less than three weeks. It was a thousand points wide, right? So 4,000 of 5,000 thousand thousand points wide. So that means that each contract represents $100,000. Why do I use 100? Why did I use 1000 points wide? It's so that I don't have to trade as many of them. You don't have to trade them this wide. You could trade them 10 points wide, 5 points wide, whatever you want. But if you want to put on a sizable position, it's a little more efficient to go a little bit wider. So in this case, each contract here represents $100,000 in total. So in this case, the total loan out is worth $1 million. But the loan amount, what did I actually give to the market is $997,725. So what's the difference here? Well, I just told you that the loan value is $1 million. The way you get to this loan value is you take the width of the strike, you multiply it by the number of contracts that you've sold and that essentially gets you out to your loan value. So if you have a thousand points, you got to multiply it by 100, like you typically would for your options because there are 100 lots. So that gets you to your 100,000 and then it's a 10 lot. So you add one more zero. That's the total loan value. The loan amount is the debit that you pay. So in this case, it came out to that and it represents a 4.6 annualized return on a vested capital, which is a little less after fees than the risk free rate as it is. But that's the nature of the trade and I'll walk you through why I set them up this way. But on this trade, I'm essentially sending out $997,000 and I'm going to get back 22,75. So this is not a bad gross $1 amount, but obviously it's just not a good return on invested capital. If you think about the actual return on this, it's less than half a percent. But again, it's all designed to work in tandem with other strategies. So what I mean by that is right now, I still have money put to work for things like the coverage strangle. And this money would be sitting there otherwise doing nothing. Meanwhile, the coverage strangle is still completely secured. Now there's a couple of risks when you do this. The first thing is there's always the risk when you're running something like the coverage strangle of early assignment. And if the money is not there, that's a problem. So one of the things I tell people is like, let's say for example, I have a really deep in the money short put. I'm not going to put the capital for that trade into a box spread because the propensity for early assignment is still relatively high, especially if there's not a lot of time value left in those options. So that's one scenario that I would not deploy a box spread. The second scenario that you have to consider is the timing of your trades. So for example, in this box spread, I have 11 days left to go. That means that the cash is going to come available on 11 days. I don't want to buy this back early because that's more fees and that's another spread that you have to cross all eats into the profitability. I want to take this trade to expiration and let it expire. It's a cash settled product. So even if one of these is in the money and one of them's not in the money or whatever, it doesn't matter. That's another reason why I trade the SPX is because it's cash settled. It doesn't matter if it winds up in between the legs. It's going to be a full profit if I let it expire. But let's say, for example, I had a trade in IWM that's going to require X number of dollars and that actually expires on the ninth of March. Well, now I've just created a timing issue because the cash for the coverage strangle, which expires nine March is tied up until 17 March. So let's say that part of my overall trade thesis for the coverage strangle is to take assignment and let's say that those short puts are deep in the money. And I still have all that cash available, but it's tied up in this box spread that's not going to come out for another two days past this expiration. I've just created a problem for myself, not in surmountable. There's ways to go about it. You could take assignment on margin and then pay the margin fee and so your box spread comes available because here's the thing with the box spread. When you put the trade on, there is some important metrics for an account. I haven't blocked out because it's privacy. But if you think about the netlick and day trades, that's how much your account is worth if you flatten everything. The cash and sweep is how much actual cash is available in your account. So the margin requirement for this trade as you can see is only $18,000. It doesn't require a lot of money, but it takes a lot of cash. So what that means is I still have plenty of capital available to trade options to trade on margin because it actually is a very low margin requirement. But what ends up happening is I use all of the cash that's available if you put on too many box spreads. And then you essentially if you get assigned early, you have the room in your account based on margin, but you don't have the room in the account based on the cash. So all that means is that you would be trading on margin for a little bit until the cash from this trade comes available if you timed it inappropriately or you can always take the trade down early. So right now I could take this trade down for $600 profit. I don't because it still has time left in the trade. Now I want to talk to you about one other risk in this trade and that is the risk free rate. So as the risk free rate changes when you put the trade on, obviously you're establishing your value. But let's say race increased while I was in this trade. Well, then now I'm kind of not in an ideal scenario because there's a better rate available and I'm locked into this rate. So it's one of the reasons why I prefer shorter term time frames, especially in a dynamic interest rate environment. So box spreads are a fantastic way to utilize leverage and the rest of the cash and the portfolio, why it's being used for other things. You just have to be pragmatic and smart about the way you do it. But this has been one of the hallmarks of what I tend to do, especially coupled with the covered stringle strategy, because the coverage triangle is very capital intensive. So this is a way to earn something while the covered stringle is still working and still has all the cash available to it. So while rates start to increase or they maintain a level that at least makes sense to run the strategy, I tend to run it. Now when we were in essentially a near zero interest rate environment, I didn't bother with it because after fees, there wasn't much to walk out with. But that's not always the case, especially as we get rates back to a normal place. So if you have any questions in the box spread, obviously this is all predicated on being long the box spread, loading the money. I don't use this to take money, although you could very reasonably and you can get it at a good rate from the market like this. So if you have any questions on the box spread, hit me up. Let me know. Happy to hit them up. And if you made it to the end, like, subscribe and be an outlier. See you later.
