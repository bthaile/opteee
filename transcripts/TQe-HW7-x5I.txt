0.00s: option box spreads. I'm going to walk you through what they are, how I use them, why they might be useful for your toolkit because for me specifically, these are actually an important part of what I do and namely because a lot of the strategies that I use like the coverage strangle, the diagonal they unlocked leverage and one of the ways you can capitalize on the leverage is putting the money to use that is otherwise scheduled for those other strategies as I listed them.
28.00s: So I'm going to walk you through the strategy first and then give you a couple examples on how I like to use them and then finally the management of the strategy. So what's up everybody Eric here welcome backs all the all ours. Let's get right to it. So the very first thing what is an option box spread? Well realistically the reason why we use this is it's a way to arbitrage the risk free rate from the market. And if you don't know what arbitrage means, it's essentially way for us to guarantee a profit with no risk.
58.00s: And there are instances that you can do it, but notice how I say via the risk free rate. The reason why that part is important is because there's not this magical trade that you're finding that just gives you free money. This is just a essential way to either loan money to the market or get money from the market. Be up alone. So we'll talk about that in a little bit. It is a high collateral and low reward style trade. It's exactly what you would expect for any other risk free trade. If you look at what you can get in the market.
88.00s: And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And then you can get a loan of money from the market.
118.00s: And then you can get a loan of money from the market. And the loan of money from the market. And then you can take a loan of a loan of money from the market. Also a loan of money from the market that's good, because the retained insisted on getting an loan from the market. So when we're working together studying the price limit, we're making the right plan and going for a loan of money, because the Rozal flavor delivery truck is going to be using the Business C상이 for P
140.70s: put on where the expiration value is greater than the premium
143.78s: prayed, the premium paid. So what is the structure of the
148.98s: strategy? Well, really, it's just a debit put spread plus a
153.74s: debit call spread and a walk you through what that looks like
156.34s: in just a second, but there are a couple of important notes
159.70s: upfront. The very first thing, you have to use European
163.62s: options. Let me reinforce that point, you have to use European
168.74s: options. If you do not use European options, the risk of early
173.18s: assignment exists. And there's a dude on Reddit that lost a
177.78s: whole bunch of money lost like $50,000 to a box spread in
181.14s: UVXY, because he thought he was smart and his thesis was
185.38s: decent. The product was completely wrong. You need to not be
189.34s: at risk of early assignment. So don't use American options,
193.30s: use European options. And really the product I use the most
195.90s: for this is the SPX keeps it simple. And that also answers the
200.14s: second point here, which is liquidity, you got to have
202.98s: liquidity in this trade. One of the things that eats this
206.18s: trade alive more than anything are fees. If you have high
210.62s: commission cost large bid ask spreads, this is a very difficult
215.82s: strategy to use with any amount of efficacy. So as you can
219.62s: tell here, we're talking about the concept of arbitrage.
223.02s: Anytime there's a potential risk free return, you would better
226.58s: believe everybody in their mother is interested in it. So that
230.78s: means that the margins are very low. If you have high cost,
236.34s: that's a problem. You're going to eat away at any of the
239.10s: potential rewards you have available to you. So we need to be
242.94s: mindful of costs. And the last thing, timing is variable, you
246.42s: can do that's one of my favorite things about these kinds of
248.78s: trades is you can deploy them in all different kinds of time
251.42s: frames. So for example, if we look at the SPX here, you can
255.70s: see all these different explorations. And right now I have a
258.02s: box spread out in 17 March, this started as an 18 days to
261.98s: expiration trade, which I'm going to walk through this whole
263.78s: trade in its entirety for the example, but you can essentially
266.90s: establish box breads wherever you want. But you got to make
270.38s: sure that it's liquid. So a lot of times you're going to find
272.74s: the best liquidity in the monthly explorations. That's just a
275.94s: function of where most people put their money. But you can
279.26s: essentially pick any time frame that you want. And that's
281.26s: actually one of the most important parts of the way that I
283.18s: deploy the strategy is because it's typically slaved to a
287.22s: broader strategy that I'm using. And I need to be more
291.66s: careful about the timing of this because I need the capital to
294.54s: be available for the other trade. Now one last note is if you
297.86s: are long the box spread or long the box, you are loaning
301.46s: money means you're paying money, but going to get more back at
304.38s: expiration. And then if you're short the box spread, it means
307.18s: you're borrowing money, you're going to get money upfront, but
309.30s: then you're going to have to pay back the principal and then
311.54s: the interest at the end of the trade come expiration. All right,
316.10s: so what does this look like? Well, this is the like a gist of
319.02s: this is the trade I just showed you. And this is a long call
322.98s: spread and a long put spread. It's got to be the same
327.06s: expiration and the same strikes. So if you look at the example
329.82s: trade down here, I am I am long the 4,000 calls, I am short
338.18s: the 5,000 calls, I in them short the 4,000 puts and then I am
345.46s: long the 5,000 puts. So essentially, the way that this trade
350.42s: works is you are going to pay a debit out. And then you are
354.62s: going to get more back. So what does this look like? When I first
357.22s: put this trade on, it was 18 days to expiration. So a little
360.50s: less than three weeks, it was a thousand points wide, right?
363.86s: So 4,000 of 5,000 thousand points wide. So that means that
367.54s: each contract represents $100,000. Why do I use 100? Why did I
373.54s: use 1000 points wide? It's so that I don't have to trade as
376.94s: many of them. You don't have to trade them this wide. You
380.06s: could trade them 10 points wide, five points wide, whatever
382.62s: you want. But if you want to put on a sizable position, it's
386.38s: a little more efficient to go a little bit wider. So in this
388.94s: case, each each contract here represents $100,000 in total. So
393.46s: in this case, the total loan out is worth $1 million. But the
399.30s: loan amount, what did I actually give to the market is $997,725.
408.10s: So what's the difference here? Well, I just told you that the
411.02s: loan value is $1 million. The way you get to this loan value is
415.02s: you take the width of the strike, you multiply it by the number
418.50s: of contracts that you've sold. And that essentially gets you
422.50s: to go out to your loan value. So we have 1,000 points. You got
426.18s: to multiply it by 100, like you typically would for your
429.78s: options, because there are 100 lots. So that gets you to your
432.98s: 100,000. And then it's a 10 lot. So you add one more zero. That's
436.66s: the total loan value. And the loan amount is the debit that you
441.70s: pay. So in this case, it came out to that. And it represents a
446.26s: 4.6 annualized return on a Vesic capital, which is a little less
450.42s: after fees than the risk-free rate as it is. But that's the
455.62s: nature of the trade. And I'll walk you through why I set them
458.26s: up this way. But on this trade, I'm essentially sending out
461.30s: $997,000. And I'm going to get back $22.75. So this is not a
465.70s: bad gross $1 million amount. But obviously it's just not a
470.66s: good return on a Vesic capital. If you think about the actual
474.10s: return on this, it's less than half a percent. But again, it's
478.74s: all designed to work in tandem with other strategies. So what I mean
482.82s: by that is right now, I still have money put to work for things
486.66s: like the coverage strangle. And this money would be sitting
490.18s: there otherwise doing nothing. Meanwhile, the coverage
494.10s: strangle is still completely secured. Now there's a couple risks
497.54s: when you do this. The first thing is there's always the risk
501.14s: when you're running something like the coverage strangle of
502.82s: early assignment. And if the money is not there, that's a problem.
507.22s: So one of the things I tell people is like, let's say for example,
510.02s: I have a really deep in the money short put. I'm not going to put
514.50s: the capital for that trade into a box spread because the
517.22s: propensity for early assignment is still relatively high,
521.06s: especially if there's not a lot of time value left in those options.
523.94s: So that's one scenario that I would not deploy a box spread.
526.90s: The second scenario that you have to consider is the timing of your
530.66s: trades. So for example, in this box spread, I have 11 days left to go.
536.26s: That means that the cash is going to come available on 11 days.
539.22s: I don't want to buy this back early because that's more fees.
542.74s: And that's another spread that you have to cross all
545.86s: eats into the profitability. I want to take this trade to
548.42s: expiration and let it expire. It's a cash settled product.
552.66s: So even if one of these is in the money and one of them's not in the
555.46s: money or whatever, it doesn't matter. That's another reason why I trade
558.82s: the SPX is because it's cash settled. It doesn't matter if it
561.54s: winds up in between the legs. It's going to be a full profit if I let
564.82s: it expire. But let's say for example, I had a trade in IWM that's
569.70s: going to require X number of dollars. And that actually
573.54s: expires on the ninth of March. Well, now I've just created a timing issue
578.82s: because the cash for the coverage strangle, which expires nine March,
583.94s: is tied up until 17 March. So let's say that part of my overall trade
589.62s: thesis for the coverage strangle is to take a
592.10s: assignment and let's say that those short puts are deep in the money.
594.50s: And I still have all that cash available, but it's tied up in this
598.02s: box spread that's not going to come out for another two days past
601.30s: this expiration. I've just created a problem for myself. It's not
604.26s: insurmountable. There's ways to go about it. You could take a
606.98s: assignment on margin and then pay the margin fee and so your
610.26s: box spread comes available because here's the thing with the
612.26s: box spread. When you put the trade on, there is some important
616.18s: metrics for an account. I haven't blocked out because it's
618.50s: privacy, but if you think about the netlicking daytrades, that's how much
622.02s: your account is worth if you flatten everything. The cash and sweep is how
626.58s: much actual cash is available in your account. So the margin
630.74s: requirement for this trade, as you can see, is only $18,000.
634.90s: It doesn't require a lot of money, but it takes a lot of cash.
639.78s: So what that means is I still have plenty of capital available to trade
644.66s: options to trade on margin because it actually is a very low margin
648.58s: requirement. But what ends up happening is I use all of the cash that's
652.90s: available if you put on too many box spreads. And then you
656.90s: essentially, if you get assigned early, you have the room in your account
660.50s: based on margin, but you don't have the room in the account based on the cash.
665.54s: So all that means is that you would be trading on margin for a little bit
668.10s: until the cash from this trade comes available if you time it
670.74s: inappropriately or you could always take the trade down early.
674.34s: So right now I could take this trade down for $600 profit. I don't
677.70s: because it still has time left in the trade. Now I want to talk to you about
681.38s: one other risk in this trade. And that is the risk free rate. So as the risk
686.42s: free rate changes, when you put the trade on, obviously, you're establishing
690.18s: your value, but let's say race increased while I was in this trade.
693.78s: Well, then now I'm kind of not in an ideal scenario because there's a better
697.22s: rate available and I'm locked into this rate. So it's one of the reasons
700.10s: why it prefers shorter term time frames, especially in a dynamic interest rate
703.46s: environment. So box spreads are a fantastic way to utilize leverage and
709.86s: the rest of the cash and the portfolio, why it's being used for other things.
713.38s: You just have to be pragmatic and smart about the way you do it.
716.90s: But this has been one of the hallmarks of what I tend to do, especially
720.66s: coupled with the covered strangle strategy because the covered strangle is
724.10s: very capital intensive. So this is a way to earn something
727.62s: while the covered strangle is still working and still has all the cash available to it.
731.46s: So while rates start to increase or they maintain a level that at least makes
735.70s: sense to run the strategy, I tend to run it. Now when we were in essentially a
740.10s: near zero interest rate environment, I didn't bother with it because after
743.86s: fees, there wasn't much to walk out with. But that's not always the case,
748.42s: especially as we get rates back to a normal place. So if you have any questions
751.86s: in the box spread, obviously, this is all predicated on being long the box spread,
755.78s: loading the money. I don't use this to take money, although you could very
758.90s: reasonably. And you can get it at a good rate from the market like this.
762.50s: So if you have any questions on the box spread, hit me up. Let me know.
764.90s: Happy to hit them up. And if you made it to the end, like, subscribe,
767.46s: and be an LRCL later.
