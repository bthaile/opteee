0.00s: two big problems with the wheel options strategy.
4.48s: It's actually a big part of what I do slight variation
7.24s: because I like to trade the coverage triangle
9.08s: and there's a specific reason for that.
11.36s: It actually helps address some of these problems.
14.64s: But I want to walk you through with these two problems
16.68s: are why you should care about them
18.24s: and then how we can overcome them
20.40s: because I actually think the wheel
22.44s: or the coverage triangle are two fantastic strategies
25.68s: for just about all traders,
27.28s: especially newer traders, but some of these get in the way
31.68s: and they give people a bad experience
33.28s: because they're not really thinking
34.64s: through the strategies in their entirety.
36.36s: What's up, everybody?
37.28s: Eric here.
38.12s: Welcome back to all the outliers.
39.36s: Let's start talking about the wheel.
41.40s: Okay, the very first problem.
43.96s: I am comfortable getting assigned at X,
47.96s: X meaning a price on a specific stock.
51.88s: I literally cannot tell you how often I have heard this sentiment.
56.88s: We have something that's trading along just like this
61.04s: that you see here and they're making this statement
65.52s: when things look like this, meaning they look good.
69.44s: The underlying is going generally where we want it to.
73.28s: There's good earnings supporting it, everything seems good.
77.60s: So for most people, they come up with this
80.00s: just insane mental gymnastics where,
82.80s: oh, if it's trading at 180 up here,
86.00s: I would love to have it at 160.
88.40s: It's a bargain.
89.96s: The problem with that sentiment is this.
93.80s: When it's trading down at 160 or whatever the case is,
97.88s: there's typically a reason in that reason,
101.60s: more often than not, will make you uncomfortable
105.80s: with getting assigned at that point in time.
107.88s: So this is looking at Apple.
110.16s: One of the largest market caps stocks
113.12s: in existence literally a trillion dollars,
115.64s: big company, everybody thanks to Big To Fail.
119.12s: And let's take a look.
120.24s: If you had top ticked it,
122.08s: meaning not even getting it at the very top,
124.48s: but like up here, when it was trading very strong,
127.88s: you would have bought in at around 179 180.
131.12s: As of the close of today, which is the 20th December,
134.00s: it is trading at 132.
135.56s: This is a 26% decline in the product.
138.96s: Now to be abundantly clear,
140.68s: I actually still like Apple.
142.16s: I think long-term it's probably okay,
144.20s: but there's a huge problem with this.
146.00s: Let's say you were okay, getting assigned
149.20s: at whatever your short strike was.
151.96s: Let's say if it was trading at 179,
154.56s: you got in at 170 being very gracious with the pricing.
159.00s: The problem is, your basis is now 170.
162.64s: It's trading down at 132.
164.60s: It's very difficult to maintain spot price sensitivity
169.60s: in this style trade.
170.72s: And this is one of the reasons why I like
172.00s: the coverage triangle so much,
173.56s: because one of the primary differences
175.80s: between these two strategies is with the wheel,
179.16s: you sell your cash secured puts into your assigned,
181.52s: and then you sell covered calls.
183.12s: With the coverage triangle,
184.56s: I do slightly different accounting
186.68s: where I don't use all of my money on the initial trade.
189.80s: So I sell cash secured puts,
192.08s: and then I'm assigned long stock.
193.76s: Once I'm assigned long stock,
195.24s: I sell additional cash secured puts,
198.44s: granted, I still like the product,
201.12s: while I'm selling uncovered calls against it.
204.12s: So slight different way that I like to run those,
206.36s: I'll throw a link to how I trade them
207.92s: in the video description down below.
209.72s: But the point I'm making here is,
212.04s: more often than not,
213.08s: we're comfortable until we're uncomfortable.
215.00s: Most traders fail to truly materialize in their mind,
218.92s: what is the case that is going to lead them to being assigned,
222.44s: because most of the time they think it's something like this.
225.36s: Where we're just getting this nice little dip,
227.56s: I'll buy it at a discount on a small pullback,
231.60s: and then we'll just run up and out,
233.32s: and I'll have this great basis,
234.88s: and life will be peachy.
236.24s: That's the ideal scenario.
237.48s: Unfortunately, the stock market has a very nifty way
240.76s: of screwing us all over simultaneously,
243.56s: somehow saying it is a joke,
245.16s: but everybody feels like that.
248.00s: So if you think you're comfortable getting assigned at X,
252.68s: that's fine,
253.56s: the way that I would really quantify that
256.76s: is saying, okay, if it's trading at 179,
259.92s: we sell our 170 cash secured plug.
262.64s: Now it's trading at 170,
264.52s: and you're like, okay, it's trading right around my strike,
266.40s: I don't mind, and then I go to 168, then 165, 165, 150,
271.40s: 150, all the way down to 132,
273.96s: the way that I make sure that I am comfortable
277.36s: with getting assigned is I don't just leave the,
280.80s: my management plan as get assigned cell-covered calls.
284.76s: I make sure that there is some sort of protocol
287.80s: to manage the basis.
289.92s: So for me, I trade the cover struggles,
291.60s: but if you chose not to,
292.92s: and you just wanted to trade the wheel,
294.84s: maybe you set up a floor that you'll take the trade to,
299.44s: because again, we have to acknowledge the fact
301.52s: that if we're selling puts below the basis,
303.40s: we get assigned on those puts something changed.
305.72s: Ideally, it's not a big, hopefully it's not a big deal,
308.76s: but it might be.
310.48s: So we need to have some sort of floor in place.
313.04s: So again, rounding out this example,
314.72s: we saw those 170 puts, let's say we give it a five to 10%
320.56s: movement range against our entry,
323.52s: and then if it falls through that,
325.20s: that's where we have a cell stop order
327.24s: to get the fuck out, move on.
329.00s: And now we can be comfortable,
331.56s: because we're not just gonna be bad holding this stock.
334.72s: Now if it's something that you like long term,
337.00s: completely different scenario,
338.40s: maybe your dollar cost averaging in,
340.28s: totally cool, no qualms with that.
342.52s: The main thing I'm highlighting here is people say they're comfortable
346.12s: until shit starts to hit the fan,
348.04s: and then all of a sudden they're not comfortable
349.56s: and the plane goes out the window.
350.92s: You gotta think it all the way through.
352.24s: Let's move on to the next one here,
354.12s: which is premium hunting.
357.64s: I have two examples here,
359.44s: and this is, I know I did this myself early on.
362.36s: I wanted to sell cash secured puts
364.04s: where I could make the most money,
365.24s: the highest return on invested capital,
367.56s: but I didn't totally understand what that meant.
370.88s: And I want to make sure that you understand what that means.
373.44s: If you do, before I say it, throw it in the comments below,
376.96s: quick, low quiz.
378.04s: See if you understand why it's not as simple as I want to get paid
382.92s: the highest return on invested capital.
385.72s: The reason why it's not is let's look at two examples.
388.80s: I have PG on this side, Tesla on this side.
391.64s: PG on a 31 day-to-experation, 30 delta put.
396.48s: The return on invested capital's 1.3%.
399.56s: So all I do pop up PG here, go over here, 31 days to expiration.
404.48s: We come over here to this 30 put.
406.56s: I'm just using the mid price, which is $1.90.
409.64s: So on a one-lot, 100 shares, you'll collect $199.
413.08s: And you'll put up $14,600.
415.36s: That is how you are getting this return on
417.32s: invested capital.
418.16s: That's actually really good.
419.16s: And I want to make a quick note on that,
420.80s: because we're in a bear market and volatility is abundant.
424.60s: This is actually still a really good trade.
426.24s: During the bull market that we went through,
429.16s: when I was trading things like the coverage
430.56s: struggle, I was hunting for one percent return on the money.
434.40s: So this is actually still really good.
436.52s: It's going to skew a lot of people's perceptions
438.48s: that trade these that are just starting now,
440.88s: but it's worth noting.
442.88s: So anyways, 1.3% return on invested capital.
446.92s: The high low variance for the past one year is 26%.
451.92s: So if I come in here and we look at the high
453.92s: and we look at the low, the variance between
456.40s: the widest part of this one-year daily range
458.84s: is again, that percentage, which is 26%.
463.24s: And if we take a look at what the daily weekly moves are,
466.96s: the daily move, one standard deviation moves about $2.
470.08s: Weekly is about $4.60 monthly, about $9.50.
474.64s: Okay, got it.
475.68s: So this is, again, I want to make this really clear,
477.72s: because this is going to screw a lot of people up when we're not
480.08s: in a bear market and volatility is gone.
483.08s: And you can't even get this.
484.44s: You're hopeful to get 0.8% return on invested capital.
488.72s: So take advantage of this while you got it.
490.64s: But then let's look at something like Tesla.
492.60s: So Tesla right now is actually offering 5.5% return
497.56s: on invested capital.
498.88s: So again, using the same example, if we go 31 days out,
501.68s: I think this one, yeah, right here, 30 delta.
504.00s: This is the mid price of $6.95.
506.16s: So it's the same exact story where just
507.52s: going to take the premium received, divided by the amount
510.88s: to cash secure the position.
512.44s: And you're going to get 5.5% return on invested capital.
514.88s: A lot of money for what you're putting up,
516.84s: you're like four times what you're getting over here,
519.60s: which is fantastic.
521.16s: However, look at the one-year high-low variance.
524.16s: It's 66%.
525.60s: It's like three times what you're seeing over here.
527.88s: So why is this the case?
529.32s: Why does this matter?
530.28s: Why does premium hunting lead people astray?
533.20s: Because it kind of combines these two factors in one setting.
538.20s: So what I mean by that is we are selling something.
542.80s: And we would like to collect the premium, obviously.
545.88s: And we're starting them at with the assumption of uncomfortable.
549.44s: But then when we start premium hunting,
552.08s: we're looking for the highest return on invested capital
554.76s: that we can find what you're going to experience
557.72s: is more return variance.
560.60s: That is why you are getting more return on your money
564.84s: for that ticker.
566.36s: Because the raw implied volatility of these products
569.76s: is different.
570.96s: If we look at Tesla, the raw implied volatility
573.88s: here is 81.64% and then if we look at PG,
577.60s: the raw implied volatility is 22%.
580.92s: So these are very different worlds.
583.60s: And that is why you're going to get more money
586.44s: when you have higher implied volatility.
589.48s: But the trade off with higher implied volatility
592.16s: is you're going to be dealing with the trades a lot more
594.00s: in maintaining a assignment, having to roll trades,
596.48s: which may not be the end of the world.
598.20s: But a lot of people get into this just purely looking
600.84s: for the most, the highest return on their capital,
603.32s: which I understand, but there's a trade off to that.
605.92s: Higher implied volatility means higher variance movement
608.28s: in the underlying itself.
609.72s: You got to be ready to deal with it.
611.28s: And again, while you're going through that variance
614.12s: that what you were comfortable with to start,
617.08s: you might not be comfortable with as the underlying is now
620.32s: down 60% over a year.
623.48s: So thinking through that ahead of time
625.48s: is absolutely pivotal to making sure
627.76s: that you can actually follow your plan.
629.92s: These are two of the biggest problems with the wheel.
631.68s: People don't think through these things enough ahead of time.
634.60s: They get stuck trying to figure it out on the fly
636.88s: and they struggle abandon the plan
638.92s: and then we just have a bunch of losing trades.
640.96s: So don't do that.
642.80s: You know how it will wire?
643.60s: Don't forget to like and subscribe.
645.36s: See you all later.
