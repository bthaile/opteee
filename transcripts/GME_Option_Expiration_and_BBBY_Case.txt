0.60s: what up outliers today is all about gme
3.60s: and we have a hilarious series of new
6.64s: documents on the Bed Bath and Beyond
9.68s: case that have come out recently that
13.00s: are we're going to take a look at mostly
15.20s: tomorrow during the live stream today I
18.12s: just want to do a gloss over of some of
19.84s: the things that I've come across so far
21.36s: and then I want to take a look at
23.04s: GameStop the stock because it was
25.20s: expiration and as you know we have to
26.76s: pour one out for the homies cuz there
28.48s: was hundreds of thousands of op that
30.32s: expired worthless today so we got to pay
33.68s: our tribute to the Fallen Soldiers there
36.88s: so that's the game plan for today is
39.20s: just looking at some GameStop stuff so
41.84s: quick update in General on the daily
43.96s: video schema is I'm actually going to go
46.84s: back to picking like one or two specific
49.52s: things that I want to talk about versus
51.24s: like the broad market update because I'm
53.28s: also doing a daily live stream so the
55.40s: game plan is during the live stream is
57.56s: when I'll do kind of like the market
59.12s: update stuff
60.60s: so in the meantime the video that I
62.96s: release each day other than Saturdays
65.76s: will be about something specific like
67.72s: this GameStop so here we go this one was
71.68s: hilarious this is obviously a deposition
75.12s: of Cohen so he's the one that's
77.44s: currently answering questions so you can
80.60s: see like the top part here starting from
82.68s: number eight they're talking about the
84.80s: consultants and we know that Cohen
88.16s: doesn't have a super favorable opinion
91.84s: of them and especially in this like how
93.92s: it all went down so this is the part I
95.76s: really want to highlight on starting
98.60s: from 13 it says or BCG right this is the
101.92s: question uh sure Consultants I know that
104.52s: you you are critical of those but what
106.84s: I'm saying is that you never felt ever
108.60s: while you were invested that they did
110.68s: any of these things correct and here's
112.80s: Cohen's answer for just the gup moment
116.64s: the company was losing hundreds of
118.00s: millions of dollars I don't know what
119.92s: they did or didn't do they did a
121.36s: remarkable job of driving the company
123.56s: off of a cliff they get an A+ for that
126.68s: it's awesome it's such an awesome
128.24s: response and as you guys know I am just
130.88s: an idiot online I'm not an attorney I
133.72s: don't know anything about any of this
135.08s: stuff but from my just deductive
137.96s: reasoning this is actually a pretty
139.12s: smart answer because one of the issues
141.08s: they have with this case is that Cohen
143.44s: didn't pay the Consultants because he
147.20s: didn't feel like they did the job so by
150.36s: answering like this he's essentially
153.08s: saying that regardless of contractually
156.32s: what they agreed that they would do or
158.72s: not do the result was bad so I actually
162.28s: think this is a really smart response
164.84s: also just a hilarious framing of the
167.60s: response and yeah overall I thought that
169.88s: that was a pretty interesting component
171.72s: to this from my understanding I think it
174.28s: was like with BCG specifically they they
176.80s: had like a 30 million unpaid bill of
179.28s: some sort I'm not not saying that they
180.32s: didn't pay them at all I I don't know
181.72s: those details I just know that I came
183.36s: across that at some point that they had
185.32s: an unsettled account there so this is
187.36s: just hilarious response the other thing
189.44s: that I thought was interesting was this
190.88s: question or kind of comment from Ruff
192.80s: Willow and it says uh how did this guy
195.48s: pass the bar exam so uh Mr finina says
198.60s: no no no if you want to ask him his
199.96s: opinion you now have him under oath
201.40s: giving his testimony if you want to show
202.84s: him something and ask him whether he
203.92s: agrees with it he'll tell you whether or
205.20s: not he agrees with it and then you'll
206.96s: have his testimony Mr Joffrey says okay
210.32s: thank you for the advice so these are
212.20s: obviously the again don't know guessing
214.96s: two attorneys it looks like finina is
217.24s: with Cohen and Joffrey is on the other
220.24s: side now what I do think is important to
222.88s: point out again like I understand why
224.60s: people might think this but you have to
227.92s: know it's fun to poke fun I love poking
230.08s: fun trolling a little bit having having
232.48s: a bit of a Gest and just throwing around
234.64s: some insults it's a good time banter is
236.92s: great however it is also important to
239.00s: make sure we understand and like this
241.44s: actually doesn't apply here at all so
244.08s: this guy is asking really smart
245.60s: questions in the way that he's doing it
247.16s: so my guess is that person um that
249.96s: posted this saying how they passed their
251.32s: bar exam is essentially saying that like
254.04s: Mr Farina was explaining to Joffrey
256.24s: essentially how to do things but from my
258.64s: understanding during the depositions one
260.44s: of the tactics attorneys will use is
262.80s: that they'll have a document that
264.56s: essentially has some sort of
266.12s: transcription or information and then
268.32s: they'll ask the person about what's on
270.52s: the document without showing them and
273.20s: then essentially what they're trying to
274.28s: do is get a contradiction they'll say
276.12s: like what did you do last Tuesday and
278.56s: the person will say what they think they
280.12s: did last Tuesday and they'll say oh
281.52s: interesting because in this email over
283.28s: here it says you did this last Tuesday
285.32s: what does that mean right so they're
286.72s: they're trying to create problems that's
289.04s: that's why depositions go the way they
290.84s: go it's why you'll see attorneys ask
295.00s: questions 16 million times that's the
298.52s: same question they just try to rephrase
300.60s: it slightly and the whole goal there
302.92s: it's just attrition these are long
304.68s: sessions where they're beating you over
306.16s: the head with these questions just
307.80s: trying to find small holes and Kinks
310.84s: that they can pull out the other thing
312.72s: is that they want to make sure that
313.88s: they're getting to a point what their
315.12s: response is so that when if and when it
317.80s: goes to trial they already know your
319.40s: answer because they've essentially boxed
321.60s: you into an answer going through the
322.92s: deposition process so if they say what
324.60s: did you do last Tuesday you'll say I
326.80s: went to the beach and then they'll say
328.20s: what else did you do oh I had lunch what
330.36s: did you have for lunch I had toast what
332.20s: else did you have for lunch turkey
333.32s: sandwich right like they're literally
334.92s: going to get to that detail so that
336.32s: during the actual trial as they're going
338.96s: through their story trying to frame it
340.80s: how they can they already know all your
342.20s: answers and then if you bulk on it while
344.68s: you're going through the trial itself
346.12s: then you look dumb because then they'll
347.48s: say oh interesting because during your
348.80s: sworn testimony you said this now you're
350.84s: saying this can you explain that puts
352.64s: them in a bad spot so I just want to
355.88s: point that out because again like I'm
357.64s: down for the jokes love this it's
359.68s: hilarious question or like it's a
361.52s: hilarious comment right but for those
363.32s: that actually take this seriously
364.84s: thinking like wow this is so dumb how
366.28s: dumb are these lawyers they're not
367.76s: they're smart unfortunately
369.36s: super smart and the people that are
371.20s: involved in these kind of cases like
373.40s: they about as high-profile as they can
375.84s: get so you're going to have the
377.76s: quintessential big Law Firm attorneys
379.84s: with tons of experience that make
382.28s: millions of dollars doing this stuff
384.56s: you're not going to have kind of the
386.12s: run-of-the-mill me trying to play lawyer
388.80s: like these are smart people so it's just
391.28s: important to know that it's again better
393.80s: to Banter I like that better myself but
397.32s: it is important to know and actually
399.48s: like analyze the playing field for what
401.24s: it is the these are not stupid people so
404.00s: anyways just a couple things that I saw
406.24s: here at a prelim for those that are
408.28s: interested this is the website and the
410.64s: case number that you could look up so
413.08s: this one here specifically exhibit 41
415.32s: which is Doc 130 attachment 5 this is
417.80s: actually the deposition it's like 7
419.80s: Pages like I said I haven't gone through
421.20s: it all we'll go through it more in depth
423.96s: together during the live session
425.72s: tomorrow but this is essentially the
428.32s: latest documentation that's been added
430.60s: on the 14th of August
433.68s: so the whole thing is continuing to move
436.52s: along it looks like it started back on
439.28s: 23 a in 22 so yeah this is the the
443.36s: website the case you can look up to find
445.00s: it if you're so interested all right
446.88s: let's turn over to here take a look at
449.00s: GameStop
450.44s: what are we seeing here well we're
452.04s: seeing sideways and that's essentially
455.48s: the the long and short from at
458.80s: actual price perspective volume is still
462.24s: super super light volume today was 3.6
466.04s: million against the 20-day average of
469.20s: 7.28 million we contracted volume over
472.76s: yesterday which is 5.3 today's 3.6 so
476.24s: volume is just super low here we're not
478.12s: seeing a lot of movement
480.28s: this kind of further bolsters this whole
482.16s: consolidation thesis now one thing
485.12s: that's worth pointing out that I think
487.16s: is favorable for GameStop is small caps
490.60s: is starting to grab a little bit of a
492.20s: leg here so that just adds a general
495.84s: wind at the back of small cap stocks
499.36s: when the broader index itself is
501.84s: progressing in a positive direction so
504.12s: that part is actually in my opinion
506.44s: pretty good to see so looking at
510.12s: GameStop options though specifically we
512.32s: had a t we had a ton expire today so if
517.16s: we take a look at the 16 Aug and we look
520.68s: at the out of the monies there is
532.30s: [Music]
538.44s: 346,000 look for on days like this
540.64s: though is did we start a big bout of
544.76s: volume in the next expiration cycle so
547.00s: if we take look at the volume today we
548.96s: can see all these blue squares popping
551.80s: up that's 23 Aug so this is the next
554.88s: expiration cycle but you notice these
556.32s: are all actually very small sizes so
559.76s: today from the call side there's
562.40s: probably 15 almost probably a little
566.04s: more than that out of the money 150,000
568.76s: out of the money calls that expired
570.40s: worthless and now as far as Replacements
573.56s: in 23 Aug the biggest offering biggest
577.64s: volume today was
579.44s: 5,273 so this is just a a pretty big
582.68s: slowdown so when we take a look at 23 a
586.92s: you'll see that it's getting built out
588.60s: over yesterday and my guess is on Monday
590.52s: at the open this will get built out more
592.04s: from people moving positions out from
595.72s: yesterday into today and then from today
598.60s: into next week after expiration here but
601.48s: there was just a ton of options that got
604.52s: uh nothing so the 23s there was 12,000
608.76s: of those essentially with 614 added over
612.12s: yesterday there was 9900 traded today
615.04s: again my my overwhelming guess is that
617.96s: for these larger expirations when you
619.64s: see like 9900 traded today 4700 traded
623.16s: today to me that's probably people
625.00s: trying to scalp any existing value out
627.48s: of these that they can to save some of
629.64s: it so that's what I see on the call side
633.40s: now when I look at our implied
637.76s: volatility super low I mean it's just
640.40s: super low it's not even above 100
642.60s: anywhere and I still see this six seep
646.48s: expiration super light
648.64s: 84% IV as compared to I mean and this
652.60s: has earnings as compared to 13 sep which
655.52s: is 92 and then the primary expiration
658.08s: after that is 89 that still is
659.96s: surprising to me and I'm expecting that
661.68s: to change I'm expecting this IV to
665.28s: expand and the reason why I point it out
666.92s: is for me it's a tradable event it's
668.72s: something that I will trade because my
671.76s: opinion is that this VA is going to
675.48s: expand and it's because it there's
677.40s: earnings there and it's very rare that
679.72s: you'll find an earnings expiration cycle
682.64s: that is like that much low almost 10
685.08s: points lower from the next expiration
687.00s: cycle it's just very anomalous so it's
689.60s: something that I will probably look to
691.48s: trade so that's what we got for today as
694.80s: always if there's any questions anything
696.20s: you want me to take a look at let your
697.68s: boy know be an outlier I'll see you guys
700.16s: later
