0.00s: What's up everybody? Eric here time for a reboot on my favorite strategy the
4.74s: covered strangle my goal is to do a in-depth but quick video so I'm gonna try to
10.82s: run through all of it within 10 minutes my other more in-depth videos will
15.28s: still exist. They're just a little older. I want to go over some new details so
19.32s: if you want the more depth version check that out. I'll throw a link up here and
23.62s: then also in the video description below but otherwise let's get straight to
27.54s: this trade. So this is hands down my favorite strategy I deploy this almost man
35.32s: tough to say I would argue at least 70% of my trades I do ebb and flow based on
41.44s: market conditions obviously but this is just such a utilitarian trade that is
45.72s: so good in so many different circumstances and my favorite part about the
50.16s: trade is the way that I define an edge in the trade is via management. That's
56.04s: not me being any sort of great stock picker being able to guess direction it
61.00s: is the ability to structure well-developed trades that take advantage of
65.18s: different option pricing and just option conditions to try and increase the
70.98s: overall success of the strategy and I would say between this and diagonals of
76.90s: some sort these are hands down the vast majority of my trades. So what is the
82.38s: covered strangle or the cash secured strangle as my mentor likes to refer to it
86.46s: as essentially we're going to start with a cash secured put then we're going to
89.94s: roll to a covered call and then we add another cash secured put on top of that.
94.62s: So let's take a quick look at what this flow chart looks like so it's easy to
99.72s: conceptualize and then we're going to go through the rest of the details how
103.80s: we're going to set the trade up where we're going to look what kind of things we
106.36s: want to see how we're going to management and then some notes at the end. So like
110.40s: I said we're going to start with a cash secured put so this means that we're
112.96s: going to sell put and we are expecting to be assigned if things go poorly. That
118.22s: doesn't mean that we're going to be assigned it doesn't mean that we're not
120.78s: going to defend and roll a position but it means that we are prepared to be
124.26s: assigned. Couple really important implicit components to that the main one
130.14s: being is you don't mind the underlying that you're going to be trading and a lot
134.32s: of people that trade puts the always say oh I don't mind ownership but then as
137.94s: soon as the stock drops 15% their put is you know 10% down they're like well I
144.74s: don't want it here that that's not how that works. So it's really important to
149.98s: truly like what you are holding because if you're going to get assigned on a
154.28s: cash secure put it means that the underlying is going to be trading below your
158.98s: strike. A lot of people like to say oh well if I just sell a put I'll buy the stock
163.14s: in a discount. Yeah you're going to get it at a discount to the current price but
167.42s: if you're getting assigned it means that you're at a premium to the to the
171.42s: then price because your put has to be in the money. So it's just important to
175.74s: keep that in mind. So if we sell that put the easiest scenario here is that it's
180.30s: going to be out of the money or we're going to manage it at a profit and then
184.86s: that leads us back to the cash secure put and you just kind of recycle those.
189.18s: The other scenario is you're in the money. Now my first approach one more in the
194.98s: money is to look to roll the trade which we will get into detail in a minute
200.02s: but essentially rolling is just a way for us to close out that existing trade
204.74s: we are going to book a loss. However we are going to establish a new trade that
211.02s: has a profile that allows us to take in an overall credit so that we can make
215.82s: money on the entire trade without being assigned. That being said we can also
221.02s: be assigned. So if you take a look at the assigned tree over here there's two
226.54s: segments. We have the covered call side and then an additional cash secured put.
231.62s: So this cash secured put that you see here simply follows this tree that we
236.82s: already went over essentially everything up there. Now while the cash secured
242.74s: put side is relatively straightforward the covered call side isn't anything
247.18s: too crazy. We're just combining combining two different strategies at the
250.22s: same time. So for the covered call you're going to sell short calls against the
254.86s: long stock that you're assigned. On those covered calls there's two potential
260.06s: outcomes. The first one is those covered calls the short calls are out of the
263.18s: money meaning your calls are either managed at a profit or expire worthless and
267.66s: then you just do it again selling another covered call as long as you have
274.02s: the ability to collect some money which I'll also explain in a little bit. For the
278.62s: in the money side if they fall in the money that's perfect that's best case
281.74s: scenario here we don't want to do anything we want to let them expire in the
285.86s: money. The the long stock that you now have will be called away and then
290.74s: essentially you just circle your butt right back up to the start here and do it
294.86s: all again. So the true power in this strategy comes in multiple forms it's
300.38s: definitely management and part of the management approach here that's really
304.70s: important understand is sometimes you have to wait. Nobody likes to do that
310.18s: in trading it doesn't feel very sexier fun but that is important and the reason
315.42s: why I'm waiting is important is because let's say that we're assigned and we have
320.82s: long 100 shares of XYZ and our basis is 10 and right now it's trading at six.
327.42s: We're not going to be able to sell covered calls above our 10 basis if the
333.58s: underlying is trading at six at a 40% discount to where we're at right now. If
338.10s: you try to sell short calls there more likely than not you're gonna get two
342.94s: cents three cents for a 50 day trade it's not enough money in my opinion to
347.46s: cap your potential upside. In those circumstances my preference is to wait.
353.30s: You said at the onset of the trade that you're comfortable holding the
357.26s: underlying do it because if we start trying to sell calls too early let's say
364.06s: we do get a rally now those calls might be trading at two dollars you got two
368.74s: cents for them just because you want to try to collect something right at your
373.18s: basis and that leads to the next problem you want to be able to sell your
377.50s: covered calls above your basis so if we are assigned at same example at 10 and
385.22s: underlying is trading at six you don't want to trade short calls ideally at 10
391.14s: you want to be able to have some capital gains on the short calls so you're
394.58s: gonna want to be selling them at 12 or 13 you need to give the trade a little
400.06s: room to the upside. Alright let's move on to the setup these are the things
404.90s: that I look for in general this isn't an all-inclusive list but this is a
408.06s: general guideline to help give you some ideas the punchline here is you are
412.90s: wanting to trade things that are liquid and that you don't mind holding for
416.86s: real for real again not just saying it but you really mean it so these are
420.30s: products that you might be holding for a year two years three years find products
424.50s: that fit that profile for you so I tend to use sector ETFs or index ETFs those are
432.22s: my favorite as anybody knows that follows the channel I WM is typically my go
436.50s: to and you can also I also venture into individual S&P 500 stocks and that's
442.50s: just because there's some inherent screening going on there if it's within
445.98s: the S&P 500 it tends to be a pretty strong company so you can find reasonable
451.06s: things in there instead of kind of just chasing premiums and selling some
455.38s: random ass stock that is paying a bunch of money P.S. they pay a bunch of money
460.02s: for a reason it's because it's super volatile and it helps eliminate some of
465.54s: just unnecessary risk in my opinion so I do like to look for things that have
470.62s: weaklies a lot of times that will indicate a certain level of liquidity
474.42s: because the OCC and just the exchanges in general don't immediately offer
479.42s: weaklies there has to be enough demand volume there that's not to say that
483.22s: weaklies can't be a liquid that does happen you have to check it but in general
488.58s: it's a good place to start now this is a short premium strategy so I tend to
494.10s: prefer higher implied volatility percentile something higher than 25%
498.50s: typically is good the main reason for this is you don't want to get stuck in a
502.30s: bad position where you sell some premium and then IV expands even further and
508.46s: then you lose potential profits or you're seeing an unrealized loss
512.02s: unnecessarily so keep an eye on that you definitely don't want to sell these
516.22s: in really really low implied volatility percentile environments it just sets
521.06s: you up for failure in kind of two ways right you have directional risk and
524.30s: then you also have volatility expansion risk in this trade so we want to limit
529.30s: that price and trend super important also side note it's already eight minutes
534.82s: 50 seconds in there's 0% chance I'm gonna finish this in 10 minutes so I'm sorry
540.06s: but for price and trend this is there's kind of two ways I think about it
545.02s: sometimes I will go with the catching a falling knife where I'm looking for
549.98s: some sort of trend reversal I want to see something that is kind of making
555.34s: big declines maybe on a three-month chart is declining but on a six-month one
561.62s: month it's uptrending a couple really important just general technical
565.66s: analysis tools that I look at again these help inform decisions they're not
569.70s: hard rules but I prefer it to be generally uptrending so that means short-term
574.86s: moving average above midterm above long term I also definitely prefer price
579.74s: above the long-term and midterm if it's below the short-term I'm a little
584.06s: more flexible on that I also want to make sure that it's trending up at least
589.06s: on a yearly chart preferably on a six-month end yearly I also like to look at
595.70s: some fundamentals so to make sure that we have growing free cash flow if it's an
599.98s: individual stock I want to make sure that there are growing sales those are
605.10s: really important for longer term trades shorter term trades within a year the
608.90s: multiple tends to drive a lot of the price performance so it's another thing I
612.94s: like to look at multiple something around or below industry averages so for
618.86s: the short put itself when I'm sending that out the door I like something that
622.50s: has at least a one percent return on an invested capital so you can take a
626.78s: look at whatever total premium you're gonna need to cash secure that position
630.50s: figure out the credit you're gonna receive divide the credit by whatever it is
634.50s: to cash secure that position and that's how you get your return on invested
637.22s: capital dividend optional I like to look for something with the dividend if it
642.58s: has one and it's still something that I like I'm not gonna go chasing them but it
647.02s: is something I'm aware of if I have two products that are essentially equal in
651.26s: most dimensions and one pays a dividend one doesn't I'm gonna go for the one
654.86s: with the dividend kind of straightforward there then we get into a little bit
659.30s: of management here so let's throw the rest of this up I want to talk about these
664.74s: two and how this fits in with the rest of our management plan so for management
670.78s: Max profit is gonna be whatever the credits you receive over the life of the
675.10s: trade plus the capital gain on the stock Max loss technically is unlimited
679.42s: however a stock can only go to zero so that is your Max loss if it goes to zero
683.98s: now when we're looking at entering this trade we find what we like we need to
689.74s: figure out our trade allocation and then our initial outlay this is an
695.14s: important concept so when we're trading like an index ETF I don't mind
700.18s: allocating a lot of the portfolio to that because if I'm for a while I would
704.66s: trade levered in something like I WM and then if I was assigned on a hundred
710.26s: percent had to close some for a loss but then I was just gonna sit on a hundred
713.82s: percent of my portfolio and I WM no problem with that whatsoever it's an
718.42s: index ETF a hold it for 10 years if I have to doesn't typically happen but what
724.02s: I'm saying is make sure that your allocation is a size that you're comfortable
727.78s: with based on what you're trading if you're trading individual stocks I like to
732.02s: use no more than 8% of the account in an individual stock sometimes it might
736.20s: flow to 10% but that's about it not so much anymore normally it's way smaller
740.58s: than that probably you know two to five percent just because I don't really
745.06s: venture into individual stocks a whole lot at this point there's not a huge
749.26s: drive for it but I do an occasion and that's where I look for and then your
754.26s: outlay is how much of that allocation are you gonna use when you're setting the
759.66s: trade up and then your scaling is how are you gonna add additional capital to
763.82s: the trade so let's say that you set $50,000 aside for a trade and let's say on
769.10s: your outlay you use 20,000 means that you've 30,000 left when are you going to
775.82s: use that 30,000 dollars that's what scaling is so let's talk about how those
780.90s: two look based on this right here entry off of delta so normally I'm gonna
787.42s: enter my cash secured put with three or 0.3 or 0.4 delta typically
794.66s: somewhere between the two and what I find is that gives me a good balance
798.70s: between the premium I'm receiving as well as not necessarily fighting every
805.94s: single trade that I have on the higher you delta the higher the probability is
809.14s: that you're gonna be managing that trade at some point but the higher
812.72s: delta the more you're gonna get paid for it the other thing to make sure that
816.50s: you're doing when you're checking out these credits that you're gonna be
819.66s: getting is check the theoretical price it is another way to confirm is
824.54s: if you are paying too much or too little for an option really easy to do that
829.46s: you can use a black sholes calculator in Excel you can add it to your platform
833.90s: that's what I have on as well just because it's quick and convenient but it is
837.50s: important take a look at that in conjunction with your implied volatility
840.90s: percentile level because your theoretical pricing gives you an idea if you're
846.66s: slightly overpaying slightly underpaying or if you're grossly overpaying
851.10s: grossly underpaying so you want to avoid those ladders all right let's talk
855.68s: about percentage off of highs and then how that ties to your outlay so we talked
860.68s: about that fifty thousand dollar allocation instead of just saying well I'm
864.34s: gonna use twenty thousand I like to use some guidelines to inform my decision
869.22s: making so in this instance let's say that I'm trading I WM and we're greater
874.10s: than 40% off of all time highs I'll use 90% even a hundred percent of that
879.46s: allocation on the initial outlay if we are less than that I tend to use
886.18s: smaller outlays the reason for this is again just an assessment of risk if
891.68s: we're 10% off of all time highs or recent highs there's probably a pretty
897.30s: good chance at least at some point within the next year or two that there's
900.34s: gonna be a pullback I don't want to be fully invested during that pullback
904.62s: because scaling is an important part of managing these trades so what scaling
912.62s: allows us to do is to remain sensitive to the the basis of the
918.28s: underlying so if we're trading something like I WM and it starts to drop by
924.58s: scaling in via additional cash secure puts that are below our basis one we
930.58s: have an opportunity to continue to realize profit I have a video that is that
935.26s: compares the wheel to this strategy and it explains this exact point I'll
940.22s: link to that up here for you all as well but essentially by remaining and
944.86s: having capital ready to use during a down move it's an extremely advantageous
949.22s: position to be in all right so let's slide over to just general management
954.94s: typically I'm gonna manage these at sixty percent credit received or if we're
959.62s: within a week and I see something between 30 and 50% max profit I might take
965.18s: that trade down it really depends on the broader market circumstances how many
969.34s: trades I have out how much risk I'm trying to take in or expose myself to but
974.50s: just some general ideas to use the other thing is once we start getting around
979.74s: 20 days to expiration normally I will offer these out at you know 50 something
986.46s: between 30 and 50 and if we start getting within 20 so 18 days it's important
993.90s: to note that our gamma risk over here starts to raise significantly gamma risk is
999.78s: just the rate of change of delta as we get closer to expiration options that
1004.34s: are out of the money want to move to a zero delta options that are in the
1008.90s: money want to move to a one delta that's where they're gonna approximate at
1012.54s: expiration so it's important to know that once we get within 20 days gamma or
1018.26s: your delta is going to move very quickly so that's why that window is something
1024.06s: at least for me to look at again none of this is hard written and stone never
1028.26s: deviate but it is important to know now let's talk about this section here when
1034.42s: we're rolling or assigned if we're gonna roll that's typically my first
1039.06s: preference simply because if we're rolling it means that we're being
1043.34s: challenged it's hard to know when we're at the bottom of a bear market or
1047.58s: something so I do my best not to get caught at the top rolling sometimes just
1053.38s: doesn't work and you might run out of capital to add to the trade you might run
1057.30s: out of reasonable rolls and you might just take assignment at that point I've
1060.90s: done that plenty of times but my typical preference is to roll now your best
1065.18s: time to roll is when the stock equals your strike price not saying that's
1070.74s: when you should roll it's just when you're gonna have the most opportunities and
1074.66s: what I mean by that is when your stock equals strike if you want to roll you'll
1080.22s: almost assuredly be able to go out a couple weeks and move your strike out of
1083.94s: the money or further away from the money more often than not the issue is once
1089.50s: you end up further and further in the money you have less and less extrinsic
1094.26s: value that means that going further out in time by two three weeks isn't going
1098.90s: to help you that much to get a credit or to more importantly aggressively
1102.86s: adjust your strike so I use stock equal strikes as the first time for me to look
1108.90s: for a role typically I will wait and typically it'll go further in the money
1113.54s: and I will use risk as a way to manage those trades so once we start deciding
1120.74s: okay I'm in IWM I had $20,000 initial outlay I want to add an additional 8 to 10
1128.90s: percent of my allocation or I'm sorry at each 10 8 to 10 percent drop in IWM I
1138.98s: want to add more of my risk the amount of that risk will definitely depend on
1143.62s: the rest of your portfolio plan your outlook of the underlying things like
1147.70s: that but typically for me I like to maybe add 10 percent something like that so what I'll do
1156.34s: is say okay we moved down another 10 percent I want to add another 10 percent of my capital to the
1162.42s: trade that allows me to do exactly what we were talking about before which is slowly
1168.50s: scale into the trade now when we are in the money it is important to monitor how much
1174.34s: extrinsic value is left in those options for early assignment if you see less than a dime
1180.02s: and extrinsic value in the options you're definitely at risk of early assignment make sure you take a
1184.34s: look not a huge deal if you get assigned early you can always unassign yourself provided you have
1188.42s: the capital and you know your broker is not going to lose their shit but otherwise it's really
1193.94s: no impact it's just something to work around now when we do have the covered call out I like to have
1201.94s: a ratio meaning if I'm long 500 shares of the underlying I like to sell two maybe three covered
1209.54s: calls against it and the reason for that is so that I allow unlimited upside potential I like that
1215.22s: scenario the other thing like I mentioned before do your best to allow for capital gains meaning
1221.78s: don't sell your short call right at the same price as your long call or as your long stock sorry
1228.98s: I think that's a bad idea and you really kneecap a lot of the potential return of the strategy
1234.66s: especially there's an opportunity cost to hold so if you sell a short call against your long stock
1241.14s: you collect that premium whatever that is that's it that's all you got on that side of the trade
1245.54s: there's an opportunity cost that you just gave up there we talked about game a risk we talked about
1251.30s: not chasing premiums and essentially getting into bad products that you don't really like the last
1256.50s: one is make sure you check your leak weekly liquidity I mentioned that but liquidity is going to be
1263.14s: king especially because when we're rolling I prefer not to roll out super far out in time I like to
1268.50s: roll out as little in time as possible while collecting a credit while ideally being able to adjust my
1274.26s: strike at the same time all right that is the coverage triangle speed round I literally doubled the
1280.10s: time that I thought I was going to try to hit but I didn't want to skimp on the information so
1285.06s: I'm okay with it as always if there's any questions or anything let me know like I said I do
1289.22s: have the more in depth videos that you could check out there's a bit of a series there but until next
1293.86s: time I'll catch you all later
