 What's up everybody? Eric here time for a reboot on my favorite strategy the covered strangle my goal is to do a in-depth but quick video so I'm gonna try to run through all of it within 10 minutes my other more in-depth videos will still exist. They're just a little older. I want to go over some new details so if you want the more depth version check that out. I'll throw a link up here and then also in the video description below but otherwise let's get straight to this trade. So this is hands down my favorite strategy I deploy this almost man tough to say I would argue at least 70% of my trades I do ebb and flow based on market conditions obviously but this is just such a utilitarian trade that is so good in so many different circumstances and my favorite part about the trade is the way that I define an edge in the trade is via management. That's not me being any sort of great stock picker being able to guess direction it is the ability to structure well-developed trades that take advantage of different option pricing and just option conditions to try and increase the overall success of the strategy and I would say between this and diagonals of some sort these are hands down the vast majority of my trades. So what is the covered strangle or the cash secured strangle as my mentor likes to refer to it as essentially we're going to start with a cash secured put then we're going to roll to a covered call and then we add another cash secured put on top of that. So let's take a quick look at what this flow chart looks like so it's easy to conceptualize and then we're going to go through the rest of the details how we're going to set the trade up where we're going to look what kind of things we want to see how we're going to management and then some notes at the end. So like I said we're going to start with a cash secured put so this means that we're going to sell put and we are expecting to be assigned if things go poorly. That doesn't mean that we're going to be assigned it doesn't mean that we're not going to defend and roll a position but it means that we are prepared to be assigned. Couple really important implicit components to that the main one being is you don't mind the underlying that you're going to be trading and a lot of people that trade puts the always say oh I don't mind ownership but then as soon as the stock drops 15% their put is you know 10% down they're like well I don't want it here that that's not how that works. So it's really important to truly like what you are holding because if you're going to get assigned on a cash secure put it means that the underlying is going to be trading below your strike. A lot of people like to say oh well if I just sell a put I'll buy the stock in a discount. Yeah you're going to get it at a discount to the current price but if you're getting assigned it means that you're at a premium to the to the then price because your put has to be in the money. So it's just important to keep that in mind. So if we sell that put the easiest scenario here is that it's going to be out of the money or we're going to manage it at a profit and then that leads us back to the cash secure put and you just kind of recycle those. The other scenario is you're in the money. Now my first approach one more in the money is to look to roll the trade which we will get into detail in a minute but essentially rolling is just a way for us to close out that existing trade we are going to book a loss. However we are going to establish a new trade that has a profile that allows us to take in an overall credit so that we can make money on the entire trade without being assigned. That being said we can also be assigned. So if you take a look at the assigned tree over here there's two segments. We have the covered call side and then an additional cash secured put. So this cash secured put that you see here simply follows this tree that we already went over essentially everything up there. Now while the cash secured put side is relatively straightforward the covered call side isn't anything too crazy. We're just combining combining two different strategies at the same time. So for the covered call you're going to sell short calls against the long stock that you're assigned. On those covered calls there's two potential outcomes. The first one is those covered calls the short calls are out of the money meaning your calls are either managed at a profit or expire worthless and then you just do it again selling another covered call as long as you have the ability to collect some money which I'll also explain in a little bit. For the in the money side if they fall in the money that's perfect that's best case scenario here we don't want to do anything we want to let them expire in the money. The the long stock that you now have will be called away and then essentially you just circle your butt right back up to the start here and do it all again. So the true power in this strategy comes in multiple forms it's definitely management and part of the management approach here that's really important understand is sometimes you have to wait. Nobody likes to do that in trading it doesn't feel very sexier fun but that is important and the reason why I'm waiting is important is because let's say that we're assigned and we have long 100 shares of XYZ and our basis is 10 and right now it's trading at six. We're not going to be able to sell covered calls above our 10 basis if the underlying is trading at six at a 40% discount to where we're at right now. If you try to sell short calls there more likely than not you're gonna get two cents three cents for a 50 day trade it's not enough money in my opinion to cap your potential upside. In those circumstances my preference is to wait. You said at the onset of the trade that you're comfortable holding the underlying do it because if we start trying to sell calls too early let's say we do get a rally now those calls might be trading at two dollars you got two cents for them just because you want to try to collect something right at your basis and that leads to the next problem you want to be able to sell your covered calls above your basis so if we are assigned at same example at 10 and underlying is trading at six you don't want to trade short calls ideally at 10 you want to be able to have some capital gains on the short calls so you're gonna want to be selling them at 12 or 13 you need to give the trade a little room to the upside. Alright let's move on to the setup these are the things that I look for in general this isn't an all-inclusive list but this is a general guideline to help give you some ideas the punchline here is you are wanting to trade things that are liquid and that you don't mind holding for real for real again not just saying it but you really mean it so these are products that you might be holding for a year two years three years find products that fit that profile for you so I tend to use sector ETFs or index ETFs those are my favorite as anybody knows that follows the channel I WM is typically my go to and you can also I also venture into individual S&P 500 stocks and that's just because there's some inherent screening going on there if it's within the S&P 500 it tends to be a pretty strong company so you can find reasonable things in there instead of kind of just chasing premiums and selling some random ass stock that is paying a bunch of money P.S. they pay a bunch of money for a reason it's because it's super volatile and it helps eliminate some of just unnecessary risk in my opinion so I do like to look for things that have weaklies a lot of times that will indicate a certain level of liquidity because the OCC and just the exchanges in general don't immediately offer weaklies there has to be enough demand volume there that's not to say that weaklies can't be a liquid that does happen you have to check it but in general it's a good place to start now this is a short premium strategy so I tend to prefer higher implied volatility percentile something higher than 25% typically is good the main reason for this is you don't want to get stuck in a bad position where you sell some premium and then IV expands even further and then you lose potential profits or you're seeing an unrealized loss unnecessarily so keep an eye on that you definitely don't want to sell these in really really low implied volatility percentile environments it just sets you up for failure in kind of two ways right you have directional risk and then you also have volatility expansion risk in this trade so we want to limit that price and trend super important also side note it's already eight minutes 50 seconds in there's 0% chance I'm gonna finish this in 10 minutes so I'm sorry but for price and trend this is there's kind of two ways I think about it sometimes I will go with the catching a falling knife where I'm looking for some sort of trend reversal I want to see something that is kind of making big declines maybe on a three-month chart is declining but on a six-month one month it's uptrending a couple really important just general technical analysis tools that I look at again these help inform decisions they're not hard rules but I prefer it to be generally uptrending so that means short-term moving average above midterm above long term I also definitely prefer price above the long-term and midterm if it's below the short-term I'm a little more flexible on that I also want to make sure that it's trending up at least on a yearly chart preferably on a six-month end yearly I also like to look at some fundamentals so to make sure that we have growing free cash flow if it's an individual stock I want to make sure that there are growing sales those are really important for longer term trades shorter term trades within a year the multiple tends to drive a lot of the price performance so it's another thing I like to look at multiple something around or below industry averages so for the short put itself when I'm sending that out the door I like something that has at least a one percent return on an invested capital so you can take a look at whatever total premium you're gonna need to cash secure that position figure out the credit you're gonna receive divide the credit by whatever it is to cash secure that position and that's how you get your return on invested capital dividend optional I like to look for something with the dividend if it has one and it's still something that I like I'm not gonna go chasing them but it is something I'm aware of if I have two products that are essentially equal in most dimensions and one pays a dividend one doesn't I'm gonna go for the one with the dividend kind of straightforward there then we get into a little bit of management here so let's throw the rest of this up I want to talk about these two and how this fits in with the rest of our management plan so for management Max profit is gonna be whatever the credits you receive over the life of the trade plus the capital gain on the stock Max loss technically is unlimited however a stock can only go to zero so that is your Max loss if it goes to zero now when we're looking at entering this trade we find what we like we need to figure out our trade allocation and then our initial outlay this is an important concept so when we're trading like an index ETF I don't mind allocating a lot of the portfolio to that because if I'm for a while I would trade levered in something like I WM and then if I was assigned on a hundred percent had to close some for a loss but then I was just gonna sit on a hundred percent of my portfolio and I WM no problem with that whatsoever it's an index ETF a hold it for 10 years if I have to doesn't typically happen but what I'm saying is make sure that your allocation is a size that you're comfortable with based on what you're trading if you're trading individual stocks I like to use no more than 8% of the account in an individual stock sometimes it might flow to 10% but that's about it not so much anymore normally it's way smaller than that probably you know two to five percent just because I don't really venture into individual stocks a whole lot at this point there's not a huge drive for it but I do an occasion and that's where I look for and then your outlay is how much of that allocation are you gonna use when you're setting the trade up and then your scaling is how are you gonna add additional capital to the trade so let's say that you set $50,000 aside for a trade and let's say on your outlay you use 20,000 means that you've 30,000 left when are you going to use that 30,000 dollars that's what scaling is so let's talk about how those two look based on this right here entry off of delta so normally I'm gonna enter my cash secured put with three or 0.3 or 0.4 delta typically somewhere between the two and what I find is that gives me a good balance between the premium I'm receiving as well as not necessarily fighting every single trade that I have on the higher you delta the higher the probability is that you're gonna be managing that trade at some point but the higher delta the more you're gonna get paid for it the other thing to make sure that you're doing when you're checking out these credits that you're gonna be getting is check the theoretical price it is another way to confirm is if you are paying too much or too little for an option really easy to do that you can use a black sholes calculator in Excel you can add it to your platform that's what I have on as well just because it's quick and convenient but it is important take a look at that in conjunction with your implied volatility percentile level because your theoretical pricing gives you an idea if you're slightly overpaying slightly underpaying or if you're grossly overpaying grossly underpaying so you want to avoid those ladders all right let's talk about percentage off of highs and then how that ties to your outlay so we talked about that fifty thousand dollar allocation instead of just saying well I'm gonna use twenty thousand I like to use some guidelines to inform my decision making so in this instance let's say that I'm trading I WM and we're greater than 40% off of all time highs I'll use 90% even a hundred percent of that allocation on the initial outlay if we are less than that I tend to use smaller outlays the reason for this is again just an assessment of risk if we're 10% off of all time highs or recent highs there's probably a pretty good chance at least at some point within the next year or two that there's gonna be a pullback I don't want to be fully invested during that pullback because scaling is an important part of managing these trades so what scaling allows us to do is to remain sensitive to the the basis of the underlying so if we're trading something like I WM and it starts to drop by scaling in via additional cash secure puts that are below our basis one we have an opportunity to continue to realize profit I have a video that is that compares the wheel to this strategy and it explains this exact point I'll link to that up here for you all as well but essentially by remaining and having capital ready to use during a down move it's an extremely advantageous position to be in all right so let's slide over to just general management typically I'm gonna manage these at sixty percent credit received or if we're within a week and I see something between 30 and 50% max profit I might take that trade down it really depends on the broader market circumstances how many trades I have out how much risk I'm trying to take in or expose myself to but just some general ideas to use the other thing is once we start getting around 20 days to expiration normally I will offer these out at you know 50 something between 30 and 50 and if we start getting within 20 so 18 days it's important to note that our gamma risk over here starts to raise significantly gamma risk is just the rate of change of delta as we get closer to expiration options that are out of the money want to move to a zero delta options that are in the money want to move to a one delta that's where they're gonna approximate at expiration so it's important to know that once we get within 20 days gamma or your delta is going to move very quickly so that's why that window is something at least for me to look at again none of this is hard written and stone never deviate but it is important to know now let's talk about this section here when we're rolling or assigned if we're gonna roll that's typically my first preference simply because if we're rolling it means that we're being challenged it's hard to know when we're at the bottom of a bear market or something so I do my best not to get caught at the top rolling sometimes just doesn't work and you might run out of capital to add to the trade you might run out of reasonable rolls and you might just take assignment at that point I've done that plenty of times but my typical preference is to roll now your best time to roll is when the stock equals your strike price not saying that's when you should roll it's just when you're gonna have the most opportunities and what I mean by that is when your stock equals strike if you want to roll you'll almost assuredly be able to go out a couple weeks and move your strike out of the money or further away from the money more often than not the issue is once you end up further and further in the money you have less and less extrinsic value that means that going further out in time by two three weeks isn't going to help you that much to get a credit or to more importantly aggressively adjust your strike so I use stock equal strikes as the first time for me to look for a role typically I will wait and typically it'll go further in the money and I will use risk as a way to manage those trades so once we start deciding okay I'm in IWM I had $20,000 initial outlay I want to add an additional 8 to 10 percent of my allocation or I'm sorry at each 10 8 to 10 percent drop in IWM I want to add more of my risk the amount of that risk will definitely depend on the rest of your portfolio plan your outlook of the underlying things like that but typically for me I like to maybe add 10 percent something like that so what I'll do is say okay we moved down another 10 percent I want to add another 10 percent of my capital to the trade that allows me to do exactly what we were talking about before which is slowly scale into the trade now when we are in the money it is important to monitor how much extrinsic value is left in those options for early assignment if you see less than a dime and extrinsic value in the options you're definitely at risk of early assignment make sure you take a look not a huge deal if you get assigned early you can always unassign yourself provided you have the capital and you know your broker is not going to lose their shit but otherwise it's really no impact it's just something to work around now when we do have the covered call out I like to have a ratio meaning if I'm long 500 shares of the underlying I like to sell two maybe three covered calls against it and the reason for that is so that I allow unlimited upside potential I like that scenario the other thing like I mentioned before do your best to allow for capital gains meaning don't sell your short call right at the same price as your long call or as your long stock sorry I think that's a bad idea and you really kneecap a lot of the potential return of the strategy especially there's an opportunity cost to hold so if you sell a short call against your long stock you collect that premium whatever that is that's it that's all you got on that side of the trade there's an opportunity cost that you just gave up there we talked about game a risk we talked about not chasing premiums and essentially getting into bad products that you don't really like the last one is make sure you check your leak weekly liquidity I mentioned that but liquidity is going to be king especially because when we're rolling I prefer not to roll out super far out in time I like to roll out as little in time as possible while collecting a credit while ideally being able to adjust my strike at the same time all right that is the coverage triangle speed round I literally doubled the time that I thought I was going to try to hit but I didn't want to skimp on the information so I'm okay with it as always if there's any questions or anything let me know like I said I do have the more in depth videos that you could check out there's a bit of a series there but until next time I'll catch you all later
