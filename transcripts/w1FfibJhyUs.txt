0.00s: What's up, everyone? Quick GameStop update. Take a look at the expiration that's coming
6.00s: up primarily because we are nearing the 5th of July and we do have a handful of options
14.00s: that are set to expire. So what's been going on here? Well, a lot. As you guys know, I'm
19.40s: actually doing a live stream with Richard Newton this Saturday at 5 p.m. Pacific time.
25.80s: The goal of that is to spend a little more time learning about this thing and diving into
30.40s: the details. We're going to explore some of the cycle theories. I have a couple pieces
35.60s: of research that I want to discuss with him as far as the grand theory of everything
42.20s: because this is still way too interesting to me. So the last couple days we did see some
49.76s: upward drift in price. It's nothing super crazy. But essentially we had a closed two days
58.66s: ago at 2333. Then yesterday we went up to 2398 and then today 2437. So we are getting
66.28s: a little bit of positive drift. Obviously everything here is so suppressed because
69.92s: of this recent move. But volume is anemic, which is behind my head. So let me move out
76.84s: of the way there you can see volume is just so light in here, which is really interesting.
82.92s: This also tells me from a broader perspective that if there were a bunch of people trying
88.64s: to short this thing into the dirt, they would not have a whole lot of resistance ahead of
93.92s: them because the volume is so light here. So the fact that we're basing in here is just
100.64s: very intriguing to me. And it's essentially been within this very, very tight range from
105.60s: back here on the 10th of June, which is very close to where we can use last update, which
111.68s: I think if I'm not mistaken on the 13th here. And but we're essentially at like 29 to the
119.20s: upside there and then to the downside here, 22 ish, something like that. So very, very tight
124.20s: range. Now if we take a look at the options chain here, there's a ton of call activity.
134.24s: The majority of it is at the ask or higher. So these are people that are buying calls.
140.44s: There are also people that are buying puts. And when I look at the volume for today, this
145.88s: is a little bit slower than what we've recently seen. So if I kill off this three July, we
151.64s: look at the two July here, we were below 200k on the call side for the first time in at least
159.04s: a week. Then on three July, it's still sub 200k, but kind of a little bit lighter than what
166.76s: we saw on two July. So when I look at this, I see a couple things. I see a really big position
174.48s: cropping up out here in the 19th July, the 125s. And this looks again like a very much giant
184.56s: quantity of lot of buying. So if we kill off this quantity restriction, and then if we go
191.20s: specifically to the 19th July series, and then let's take a look specifically at the 125s,
199.84s: what I want to show you is the size of these traits. And again, they're all just very,
203.60s: very small. The reason why the size of the trade matters is because it gives you some insight
210.32s: as to the entities that might be placing them because it's very rare to have really large
218.40s: institutions placing one lots, five lots, 10 lots. It's kind of a waste of time for them.
224.64s: So the majority of volume that I see in here are pretty small positions. There are a couple
230.80s: like this here, which is 1208, but it's still only at 13 cents. So it's still not
239.44s: a very large dollar value trade. It's just a lot of contracts because it's so cheap.
244.96s: So I'm not sure that there is a ton to read into just yet on these 125s, other than there are
251.36s: a good million participants that are in it. That's very clearly the case here. And the most
258.48s: transactions I see definitely are on the on the buy side. So again, nothing that I write home about,
265.12s: but something that I keep an eye on. Now, as far as other larger transactions for today,
272.96s: it's really smaller positions. Now, one issue with Timing Sales on Thinkorswim is that it just uses
280.96s: the quantity. Really, it's better to use like a dollar delta of some sort because there are
285.92s: positions in here that as a dollar value are actually bigger than this one, but smaller lot
290.32s: sizes. But even with that, there's not a ton of them like this one right here. This 125 in 16 August,
299.44s: if we grab our handy dandy calculator, we take a look at the size. So that's 598 times 65. It's a
307.52s: 38 39,000 position. So still, I would consider that on the small side. That's again, like,
317.36s: until we start getting over like $150,000 in a position like we're talking still pretty small
322.88s: trades, especially in something like this. Now, the good part though is with all these different
328.16s: orders coming in at all these different strikes, a lot of these are still in the five July,
332.48s: unfortunately, and the reason why that's unfortunately is because we are very quickly coming up
336.96s: on expiration here. And my guess is a lot of this OI that's out here in five July is going to
346.96s: just get eviscerated. So there's 192,000 calls in here. Right now, GameStop is at 2437. So if we
356.16s: look at everything that's essentially below that, a decent bulk of these positions are going to
364.88s: come off. And there's a lot of the larger positions here, kind of like in this zone. Now, we're not
371.92s: fully building out follow on expiration is just yet. So if we clear these off, we're like a 12 July,
376.96s: that's only 70K 19 July is the next primary. This is where most people look like they're moving into.
384.64s: And then 16 August is still lacking behind. So I'm still seeing the overwhelming majority of people
390.40s: playing these really short term timeframes in here. I don't think that's anything overly novel at
395.52s: this point. Now, what I think we should do though is check out time and sales, but I think we should
401.04s: take a look specifically at the 12 or the 19 July expiration and see what's happening out there
410.00s: and what trends are emerging. So if we sort these by size so that we can kind of parse through a
421.36s: little more quickly, we do have those 125 blocks. We do have some in the money 24's. These are
429.20s: kind of interesting because again, this is a much smaller position here in terms of contract size,
435.44s: but in terms of dollar amount, this also is not trivial. And I want specifically though 19 July,
442.72s: and let me get that series. There we go. 125's, those are the busy ones. We have that 24 block,
451.68s: 125's tons of tons at 125. So unfortunately, this is what we've seen a lot of. People kind of
459.68s: speculating super far out. I'm seeing some in the mid 20s and 30s, which is good. So if you come
465.92s: out here, let me take a look at those standard strikes 25s still relatively heavy, OI, moderate volume.
475.52s: People are building into this though because over yesterday 3500 contracts were opened up.
481.12s: Same thing for the 30s. So I'm seeing net positive flows over the last day at least and my
486.40s: assumption would be that that would generally continue. Interestingly enough, that actually surprises
491.28s: me that so many of the 125's came down. That's curious. Makes sense because there's still enough time
498.16s: left in these positions though to get some of your money back. But there hasn't been any sort of
502.72s: massive moves yet. And there's still 35,000 contracts out here. I find that really interesting with
509.04s: the crowd that's trading options in here is that they keep going to these super far out of the money
513.36s: strikes. Again, they can pay out great if you get your move. But if you don't get your move,
519.04s: it's just lighting money on fire and it's a generally low probability play. So for me, it's not how
525.28s: I'm playing it. You can see like I'm out here in the 18 October that is by design. The way I trade
531.52s: options is very different than I think a lot of people that are trying to make a quick buck here.
536.96s: Last note though, take a look at this flattening of open interest. This is interesting.
543.76s: So we've gone essentially from call OI being at least two, two and a half times that
549.52s: of put OI. It's flattening massively. We're seeing 852K calls against 520 K puts.
557.76s: So we need to see what's going on with this net flow. My expectation is that as soon as GameStop
564.16s: starts showing some significant signs of life again that these will start popping off.
569.84s: And I also think there's been a moderate amount of distractions if we think about it with everything
574.64s: that was going on in cost today. We had chewy going on. We have sear it like there's just a
579.84s: just a ton of different names getting thrown around and people bouncing all over. So I think once
584.72s: this becomes a little bit more of the focus again, we'll see more flow into this. But overall,
590.64s: generally quiet here on the Western front. Not a whole lot sticking out to me as always though,
596.56s: if anything does, I will give you guys an update. And if there's any questions anything I should go
600.96s: over, let me know, be an outlier. See you guys later.
