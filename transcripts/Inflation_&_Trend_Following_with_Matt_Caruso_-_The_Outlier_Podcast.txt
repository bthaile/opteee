1.64s: what's up everybody Eric here I am back
4.62s: with Matt Cruz so from I think is your
7.08s: platform actually like the whole thing
8.22s: called Caruso insights or is that just
10.02s: the newsletter that we share that's the
12.12s: whole thing yeah yeah good well it's
13.92s: it's a great thing thanks yeah and I
17.10s: mean if somebody has real insight that's
19.20s: probably you not me so I think at least
21.54s: yours is pretty damn authentic
24.36s: thanks Eric
26.52s: um how's your year going dude
28.38s: ah you know what to be honest it's quiet
30.18s: like um
32.04s: you know markets are not Cooperative
33.66s: like I'm more of a trend Trader and
35.88s: we're just kind of stuck in this range
37.20s: so my aim in these kind of markets is to
39.18s: not get into trouble that's uh that's my
41.58s: my go-to strategy at the moment so
43.14s: trying to uh avoid that uh that bad chop
46.50s: you get stuck in one of those kind of
47.82s: trendless markets and you force it and
49.68s: that's never good for anyone so it's
51.00s: been it's been quiet but you know it's
52.02s: great because it gives me a chance to
52.86s: kind of focus on other things like
54.48s: obviously always Market related but
55.86s: rather than the in and outs and um which
58.02s: is a change for me though you know it's
59.10s: funny as you know you go through your
60.30s: career and you do different things and I
62.16s: day traded for years so it's kind of
63.66s: your glue to the action now it's kind of
65.76s: almost nice to kind of like spread out
66.90s: do other things a little bit but how's
68.46s: your year going so far
70.02s: really good so for me I'm one of the
72.36s: fortunate people that
74.52s: um the the chop is good for volatility
76.20s: right so like I'm sure during the the
78.78s: bull market you know before the Kobe
80.52s: crash you were probably killing it and
82.86s: then that's when I was sitting there I
84.78s: mean I was looking under rocks for
86.58s: volatility
88.92s: so this is this has actually been like
91.62s: my exact Market it's not too frequent
94.08s: that we get kind of this sort of
95.76s: sustained Market over the past it's not
97.32s: what year and a half now or it's been
99.00s: pretty similar to this last year you
100.98s: know more trending to the downside but
102.60s: still enough volatility to trade really
104.58s: effectively and this market so far has
107.22s: just been fantastic big fan you know
109.44s: it's funny um when I started trading on
111.60s: the desk back in the day I was younger
113.10s: and we were almost all Equity guys but
114.90s: there was a few option guys and we
116.88s: didn't really mix too much kind of later
118.08s: on different sides of the desk you know
119.40s: but I remember talking to my manager who
120.78s: became close I said you know I have the
122.28s: options guys doing he's like I'm bull
123.60s: markets they don't really make any much
124.74s: money he's like but for the Department's
126.36s: a great Hedges like when things go bad
127.62s: and the equity guys take a beating they
129.72s: make like a huge multiple of like their
131.28s: normal returns he's like so for us it's
132.84s: more of like a diversify of returns I'm
134.40s: like oh you know I never never thought
136.08s: never thought of it that way but uh so I
137.82s: I guess yeah you know there's certain
139.50s: kind of truisms of the market all these
141.18s: years later remains true with with your
142.86s: option style too so it's just a uh a way
145.32s: of the market yeah and I to be honest
147.78s: it's it's one of the reasons why I
149.34s: really like that's you know everybody
151.14s: thinks retail Traders are perpetually
152.90s: disadvantaged and there are innumerable
155.58s: disadvantages for retail traders to be
157.38s: super clear but there are some benefits
159.30s: and it's kind of what you're talking
160.68s: about is you know not that I could ever
163.20s: trade Trends as effectively as you can
166.08s: you've essentially dedicated you a lot
168.18s: of your life to that approach but I do
170.34s: have the luxury of saying okay this
172.74s: strategy set is working well on this
174.54s: market now it's not working I need to do
177.24s: something else and that's actually why I
179.34s: I kind of structure my options trading
181.50s: to not just be one thing I don't just
183.90s: trade volatility because there are
186.06s: extended periods where it's not there
187.68s: whereas you know like the dudes on the
189.54s: desk that you're talking about they
190.80s: essentially you know they have a more
192.18s: limited scope on what they're doing
193.44s: because they're part of a bigger picture
194.88s: which is I say that for the retail
196.80s: Traders because retail just likes to
198.84s:  and moan that you know
200.34s: everything's stacked against us and it's
202.38s: it is in general but there are some
204.90s: benefits in being able to Pivot pretty
206.76s: quickly is actually kind of a nice thing
208.08s: even what you're doing now right in your
209.70s: strategies because you're saying that
211.08s: you're just trying to not get in trouble
212.64s: so what does that look like for you are
214.20s: you mostly in catch now
215.70s: yeah I've been mostly in cash for
217.26s: probably the past month or so and uh you
219.54s: know like I said for for someone who's
221.34s: looking for Trend even if it's a swing
222.72s: trade or whatever I mean it's just been
224.16s: you know it's one of those markets
225.96s: that's deceiving for for anyone who's
227.28s: trying to play Direction because just as
229.20s: something looks good it fails when
230.58s: something looks awful then it comes back
231.96s: it's really the reversion to the mean
233.46s: guy is the only guy who makes money in
234.72s: this market so so knowing kind of when
237.06s: to like oh this is time for me to back
238.50s: away and having the tools for that it's
239.88s: like a big Advantage because I mean this
241.44s: is the kind of Market in the past where
243.06s: I you know you go into drawdown which
244.62s: sucks and then just you're fighting just
246.36s: to make back your drawdown and good
247.62s: times before you can actually get ahead
249.06s: and I think for some people where they
251.10s: you know trading for a living is not
252.48s: their their their their main uh business
254.28s: you say oh well I'll make it back
255.54s: whatever but if you're trading for a
256.68s: living and you build that big hole it's
258.30s: a big mountain to climb so you you learn
260.28s: to want to avoid that that loss as much
262.14s: as possible so it's quiet that's it's
264.12s: fine for me you know for someone who's
265.32s: who used to have you know 500 open
267.30s: orders at once and have to run to the
269.88s: washroom and run back to not get too
271.56s: many fills you know sometimes a bit of
273.06s: quiet it's not a bad thing
274.50s: yeah and uh actually one of the dudes
276.90s: from my Discord he pulled in a tweet
279.24s: that you put that I think you were I
281.16s: didn't catch it myself but I think you
282.84s: were referencing one of Mark's tweets
284.34s: essentially about cash and
286.98s: um I actually loved that conversation
288.54s: because sometimes I think people do
290.28s: forget that cash is a position like and
293.28s: there is Decay right you don't want to
295.20s: stay in cash for too long and some
296.88s: people do I think fall into the Trap of
300.12s: okay I feel uncomfortable or I know this
302.94s: isn't right for me I'm gonna move to
304.38s: cash but then all of a sudden they have
306.00s: a hard time redeploying because the
308.64s: conditions are then never right again
310.08s: right it's never perfect there's always
311.64s: concessions I want to know how you kind
314.16s: of overcome that because I think that's
316.26s: a common problem for people you know
318.12s: that's a really good point I remember
319.20s: when I um again when I first started
320.88s: Tree on the desk and I didn't want to at
323.04s: first I guess you know like cocky 20
324.30s: year old you started making some good
325.38s: money and I was training Futures and why
326.88s: would I want to work anywhere you know
328.32s: but uh it just so happened my wife had a
330.42s: different job in the bank but happened
331.68s: to be next to the trading desk and so
333.18s: she like introduced me said okay I'll
334.32s: give it a shot but I learned a lot of
335.82s: lessons which was great in retrospect
337.14s: and happy I did it but I remember I saw
339.12s: I was like the youngest guy on the desk
340.14s: I was sitting next to the oldest guy on
341.40s: the desk and at one point I hit a draw
343.26s: down I forget what it was like it wasn't
344.70s: terrible but like I was kind of just
346.38s: like you know confused and you know you
347.82s: know you get those points where it's
348.66s: like you look at the market and
349.50s: everything just looks like like the same
351.36s: thing you don't know how to read
352.38s: anything anymore it's like you've gone
353.46s: blind and he's like Matt whatever you do
355.26s: he's like I don't care if you own 100
356.76s: shares of stock he's like whatever
358.40s: always be trading he's like or you lose
361.02s: your feel you lose your touch and he had
363.06s: a he had a super point and that helped
364.74s: me a lot over the years now I've kind of
366.90s: adjust it a little bit so I have some
368.64s: tools where it's like when when the the
370.44s: green sign comes in I force myself to do
372.54s: some buying because if you don't have
373.74s: some kind of rule or some kind of method
375.24s: that's going to force you to buy you
376.98s: totally lose your touch and you kind of
378.48s: forget why you got into it in the first
379.68s: place by the time you come back as you
381.36s: see a headline the best moves have taken
384.30s: off without you so like uh for those who
387.24s: don't have I think the discipline to
388.62s: kind of stay away but then force
389.76s: yourself back in I would almost say it
391.50s: sounds you know maybe counterintuitive
393.72s: but yeah you should always be trading if
395.46s: you don't know when to kind of force
396.66s: yourself back in because losing that
397.74s: touch is an expensive mistake to make so
400.14s: a good point Eric yeah no well and I'm
402.60s: glad that you you kind of give people
404.64s: two different tools because I actually
406.38s: typically fall into that first camp
407.94s: where I almost always have some sort of
411.60s: exposure almost always there was a
413.70s: couple periods over the last what two
415.86s: years three years where I went
417.72s: completely to cash zero percent
419.22s: utilization but that was like super
421.44s: short term and then I immediately looked
423.72s: for any excuse to put something on
426.00s: because I've been there before man where
428.16s: it's like I I moved to cash and it's
430.74s: like you see everything else just
431.94s: lighting up on fire around you and
433.50s: you're like wow this is actually like
434.58s: pretty good I'm not losing anything here
436.14s: yeah and then it's I just remember man
438.36s: I'm like looking at the markets like oh
440.10s: well this could happen or that could
441.72s: happen and all of a sudden it's like
443.04s: another four days and there's nothing
444.72s: out there I'm like all right dude I
446.58s: gotta put something on
448.32s: um so what stuff has been working for
452.10s: you so far this year in terms of even
454.68s: the those shorter term trades not
456.78s: necessarily like the big big trends that
458.76s: you're looking for but like maybe some
460.44s: of the shorter term stuff that you're
461.58s: looking just for some exposure
463.56s: yeah so January worked out really well
465.66s: uh and we came in and and again someone
467.70s: like like my main tools kind of said you
469.32s: know things are conducive and it's
470.64s: really odd one of my main tools is
472.26s: looking for like more 52-week highs and
474.42s: 50 tweak lows right and so although like
476.64s: January markets were lower than where
478.92s: they are now let's say you know
480.12s: especially the NASDAQ the QQQ like we we
483.36s: had really strong internal signs so that
486.18s: worked great uh then after kind of
488.28s: February into March down at the chop in
489.96s: April I've been in cash because it's
491.22s: just been this and again looking back
492.78s: for someone looking for Trend when
494.10s: you're a flat line that's like a worst
495.42s: case type of market so I think like
497.64s: looking back it's really just kind of at
499.38s: least the tools really did their job you
501.00s: know again like I always I never fully
503.10s: trust a tool like I'm always like scared
505.32s: that okay at a certain point it's going
506.64s: to stop working and if there's like
507.96s: endless stories of like systems that
509.34s: were great and then just stopped and and
511.02s: people couldn't recognize it so I I'm
512.88s: always kind of like if the tool is
515.04s: giving me a signal like I want to like
516.42s: verify that this really is representing
518.28s: the environment properly but um I think
520.50s: for now like sometimes
522.12s: just knowing when to get aggressive when
523.98s: not too aggressive like the biggest I
525.72s: think the hardest thing for me to learn
526.86s: over the years was to assess
528.18s: environments you know like like there's
529.62s: that time to really get really like be a
531.60s: pig you want to like be as aggressive as
533.46s: you can other times you know mediocre
535.32s: and sometimes not much but um kind of
537.42s: like you I almost always have a position
539.04s: it's probably like five times I can
540.60s: count in my career where I didn't I mean
542.94s: even on my honeymoon I had positions
544.26s: although it's the positions cost me more
546.12s: than my honeymoon did which is like the
547.50s: other problem of having positions when
548.82s: you shouldn't
550.32s: um but uh yeah you know so that's pretty
552.36s: much it I think just you know
553.14s: recognizing the tools are working well
554.52s: keeping you safe and just waiting for uh
557.34s: like that fat pitch I saw a great
558.66s: interview with Stanley drucken Miller
559.92s: recently where he was saying kind of
561.30s: similar you know tough environment for
563.58s: positions he's like and you want to wait
565.86s: for that fat pitch to knock it out of
567.12s: the park you know so that's that's
567.96s: really where my focus is
569.82s: yeah another question I wanted to ask
572.16s: you was
573.72s: um as you're looking at the markets
575.46s: right now it sounds like you there
577.44s: aren't any strong sector leaders that
580.62s: you're keying into but I'm curious how
582.48s: you're monitoring that slash if there's
584.22s: anything at least you're kind of waiting
585.90s: to see starting to make a breakout or do
588.24s: you think it'll be a while before we
589.38s: actually see that kind of strength
591.18s: so I do see sector leaders so that's
592.92s: that's the thing you know and
594.84s: it takes like that discipline because I
596.52s: see stuff that looks good but that but
598.32s: those rotations sometimes can be
599.58s: fleeting so like kind of in a good
600.96s: Market what looks good then really
602.40s: expands and manages to pay you know but
604.56s: like in these choppy markets you can get
606.00s: violent rotations but I think the key
607.56s: themes coming out like I think AI is
609.30s: going to be huge like a lot of stuff is
611.76s: hype so I'm not someone that usually I
613.26s: think one of the problems I faces and
615.18s: I'm sure you know you've been trading
616.50s: for a while too so like you know most
617.88s: professional Traders I know are cynical
619.38s: people because you see so much
621.24s: you know crap over the years of CEOs
623.64s: promising this and this this trend and
625.68s: then it all ends up like you look back
627.36s: five years later and the stuff's down 90
628.92s: so you stop believing like in anything
630.90s: that that could be great
633.18s: um but I have some experience with AI I
635.04s: had a consulting company I'd worked with
636.84s: a few years back although it's like ai's
639.24s: really balloon since you know but um I
641.16s: think that will be big and I think
642.36s: that's what's really pushing Nvidia
643.62s: Nvidia is kind of like the guy selling
645.36s: the shovels to the gold miners or like
647.28s: of AI so you're seeing it play through
649.02s: that there's just not a lot of direct
650.04s: plays right now so I think that's one
652.26s: kind of going beyond that which I think
653.82s: everyone is like staring at so it's
655.38s: probably like a late a late trade in the
657.18s: short term is I think you can see like
658.92s: kind of more like affordable dining I
660.42s: think if you look at Chipotle Mexican
661.56s: Grill Wingstop some of these stocks are
663.42s: doing great and I think you know what
665.34s: obviously with inflation the past few
666.72s: years
667.50s: um you know for a lot of people it's
668.58s: more affordable to go to lower end
670.32s: diners and um you know they do a good
672.66s: job at their price point so that's been
674.94s: another strong Trend it's interesting
676.68s: another strong Trend I found is housing
678.48s: and building which I have a hard time
681.24s: understanding why given the higher rates
683.52s: you would have thought with higher rates
684.66s: they'd be getting crushed but that's
686.10s: been strong but I don't fully I don't
688.50s: fully get that move
690.06s: um there's just one stock fnd which is
692.22s: floor and Decker they have a great kind
694.02s: of growth plan coming through FN as in
696.24s: Nicholas uh growth plan so that they've
699.06s: been kind of building but everything's
700.50s: like everything's stuck sideways since
701.82s: February it's like flat lines and these
703.56s: are some of the stocks that are you know
705.24s: you can see with your channel lines
706.26s: coming up like I mean it's generally in
707.94s: an uptrend but it's so like there's such
710.58s: large flat periods if you don't catch
712.02s: those like fleeting moments of uptrend
713.58s: like you're just stuck with a lot of
714.90s: noise so it's uh
716.52s: it's really interesting you point that
718.08s: out right because yeah down here it's
719.52s: trading at 69 and then from December to
722.34s: the end of you know yeah it makes its
725.46s: run to 100 and then it's just from there
728.64s: on it's flat man that's a good point
730.92s: yes you look at they say oh that's easy
732.54s: but then in real time they get a factor
734.46s: of the stock that kind of failed and
735.54s: this and that so it's kind of you know I
737.52s: kind of just realized when the
738.54s: environment's kind of like soft I prefer
740.28s: to kind of slow myself down so I always
741.90s: usually have some trades I had one
743.34s: recently iot
744.78s: which was doing great actually standing
746.88s: Stanley druckenville has a position this
748.80s: it's like kind of a recent IPO as I was
751.32s: positioning in there like in uh like you
753.24s: know tail end of March right off those
754.92s: key averages and it's like went to break
757.14s: higher and as I was breaking out I'm
758.70s: like I don't know whenever something
759.90s: breaks down this market like instantly
761.40s: fails so I had a break even stop and
762.96s: just kind of like rolled over instantly
764.82s: so that's kind of kind of summarizes a
767.16s: lot of this I think the big opportunity
768.48s: really was that like early January to
771.36s: Feb ever since then it's been just like
772.86s: chopped for like three months it's just
774.78s: been sideways which has been kind of
776.28s: tough for a trend Trader this is pretty
778.26s: impressive though this down move here
779.94s: yeah like what this surprises me like I
783.72s: assume this is catalyst driven of some
785.46s: sort like not at all not at all this
788.94s: this is really an environment like uh of
791.82s: positioning whenever people get like two
793.50s: position one way there's such little
794.94s: Trend that like it just gets rammed the
796.80s: other way back down and this is totally
799.86s: just a a breakout that was pushed lower
801.72s: but by short-term short-term Algos or
804.24s: machines or whoever big traders that
805.80s: that's there was nothing nothing news
807.48s: driven for that you know so okay
809.46s: interesting yeah cause I'm checking out
810.90s: the news and it says that it was moved
812.82s: to a hold and yeah I mean nothing awful
816.24s: right like nothing no
818.04s: thank you
819.36s: and that's uh that's interesting
822.66s: especially yeah those kind of moves
824.22s: because and it's always one of the
825.66s: favorite things like one of my favorite
826.80s: things about talking to you is you
827.82s: always introduce me to new tickers
829.38s: because you definitely look at like a
831.06s: very different side of the market than I
832.74s: tend to
834.18s: um so it's always fun to yeah to take a
836.22s: peek at some of these because most of
837.54s: the stuff it's funny I look at this
839.82s: chart but most of what I'm looking at
841.80s: this year is actually I care about this
843.84s: chart which is just implied versus
845.88s: historic volatility and I'm just looking
848.34s: for variance risk premiums essentially
851.28s: um so it's it's interesting because when
853.32s: I look at something like this there's
854.70s: definitely like good variance risk
856.56s: premiums here at least on a short term
859.08s: um so even though it might not be
860.28s: something I would typically trade uh if
862.86s: the options are not super gross which
864.96s: they're not they're not great but
866.22s: they're not bad
868.20s: who knows man we might uh might add it
871.68s: to the watch list
873.26s: so something like this are you just
875.40s: looking to really fade like the Vol
877.14s: differences or like how would you are
879.42s: you are you bringing in Trend or
880.74s: Direction in any way like how are you
882.06s: how would you approach a symbol like
883.98s: this because I know it's a very
885.66s: different uh very different styles it's
887.70s: a great question if if we were kind of
890.04s: more in this sideways trending section
891.84s: then I would be way more pure volatility
894.74s: hoist but with something that makes this
897.60s: kind of down move you know from what 22
899.94s: down to 1718 it's pretty significant
902.82s: move for a product this size I can't
904.80s: ignore Direction so I either need to
907.44s: structure the volatility capture to
909.48s: account for some sort of expected
912.48s: um continuation and Trends so like for
914.16s: example
915.54s: um you know who knows maybe there's some
917.70s: semblance of support forming somewhere
920.34s: in here right and maybe I wait to see
923.16s: how it hangs out around this level
924.66s: before maybe it drops down here but the
927.36s: point being is this is is not where I
929.28s: would place a directionally neutral
932.06s: volatility capture strategy just yet I
934.74s: need to wait and see how this thing
936.12s: moves a little bit more because I mean
937.86s: this is six big consecutive down days
940.68s: yeah so it's you know the volatility
944.16s: expansion especially for this kind of
945.96s: move if we're being honest it's not that
947.76s: impressive like typically with this kind
950.58s: of big down move I would expect implied
953.52s: volatility to be increasing kind of like
955.38s: what you see back here like way more and
957.96s: it's not so it also tells me that this
959.82s: is just a typically more volatile
961.80s: product it runs at a higher Baseline
963.66s: which is also seen in the numbers so
965.96s: yeah with higher volatility is good it
969.48s: gives me
970.62s: um just higher propensity to catch
972.24s: larger discrepancies but options Traders
975.12s: I think sometimes get too focused on
977.46s: higher volatility for getting that
979.56s: higher volatility means moves so
982.44s: with something like this man it's easy
984.60s: to get ran over on some sort of
986.16s: directional neutral trade which actually
987.54s: happened to me
989.40s: um in FRC which is this has been a
993.42s: fantastic trade I have been pulling
995.94s: volatility out of this thing for two
998.82s: weeks now and then in what the last week
1002.12s: I was attempting to do the same thing
1003.98s: I've been doing for a while now I've
1005.84s: been positioning pretty small because I
1008.60s: see a insane amount of risk in this
1011.06s: product and I mean whether it's halt
1013.58s: because I mean one of the days I was
1014.84s: trading it I had to get out via between
1016.82s: halts and that's oh you know how that
1019.28s: goes yeah like there's a order
1021.68s: log that has to get ran through so
1023.84s: you're just hoping to get a fill even
1025.46s: out of Market order yeah so but this is
1029.18s: like a prime time example of something
1030.56s: where you know I was kind of trading
1032.96s: that capture strategy but then all of a
1034.52s: sudden we started moving from 15 down to
1036.98s: 11 10 and even that move was enough to
1039.68s: trigger those halts and then the
1041.96s: volatility if we pull this up the
1044.36s: realized volatility was just spiking so
1046.58s: I was getting out essentially at small
1048.68s: losses as soon as this started to happen
1050.90s: instead of letting it run some of them
1052.28s: actually would have been uh actually
1053.66s: decent profits but I don't I do not like
1056.18s: to play with that especially in
1057.50s: something like this this is like when I
1058.70s: was playing uh playing GameStop in AMC I
1062.48s: fully acknowledge that I am playing with
1064.70s:  fire so I am real quick to you
1068.84s: know get the position on that I think
1070.04s: makes sense but then as soon as it
1071.60s: starts even remotely not working I'm
1073.94s: getting the out immediately
1076.04s: yeah yeah no I uh and I've I've played
1079.58s: with those like maybe not FRC but I I've
1081.80s: played with the very volatile names like
1083.96s: earlier in my career so I I know the
1085.58s: vibe I think you know positioning is a
1087.02s: big part of it you have to just know
1087.98s: like the right size to put on yeah you
1089.90s: know you always have like that that
1091.16s: buffer I used to I mean I used to build
1093.20s: into it like you know because usually
1094.40s: you know the high ball you're taking out
1096.32s: like huge returns when it's working your
1097.76s: way so you do it enough where you say
1098.96s: okay I have enough profit or even if I
1100.28s: raise my size worst case I'm just giving
1101.90s: back my profit and and I don't get hurt
1103.88s: too bad and and you size and you have to
1105.92s: know the point where you can't get too
1106.94s: greedy or else eventually you will get
1108.32s: snagged you know but um yeah let's do a
1110.84s: lot of like kind of like merger ARB type
1112.34s: stuff and you just have to be careful
1113.78s: you're in that wrong environment where
1115.52s: like you know it would fail and not go
1117.38s: through us you know it's like you're
1118.40s: picking up pennies in front of a
1119.36s: steamroller you gotta be very careful
1120.86s: very Nimble you don't want to get run
1122.54s: over so uh yeah I've tried those it's so
1125.72s: per like I literally love the way that
1127.52s: you just kind of phrase that because
1129.50s: options Traders will say the thing like
1131.60s: picking up pennies in front of a
1133.16s: steamroller and I always remind them I
1134.54s: was like well just remember like stay
1135.98s: Steamrollers they move pretty
1137.72s: slow so if you're quick just like you
1139.46s: said right if you're Nimble you can get
1140.84s: the hell out of the way which is kind of
1142.10s: the whole name of the game
1143.78s: um and it's also I think so precipitous
1146.78s: that you brought up sizing because in
1148.82s: the Discord you know every once in a
1150.26s: while I'll drop in some of the stuff I'm
1151.58s: working on and somebody was just like oh
1153.62s: man you know how are you handling FRC
1155.78s: you know because I told them that I'm
1156.98s: essentially waiting to get out because
1158.36s: of the halls and I was just like I just
1160.76s: I'm literally just waiting there's
1162.38s: nothing for me to do and the trade is
1165.02s: strategically sized that even if we have
1167.54s: another 15 gap down I don't want it to
1170.66s: but it's not going to break the bank
1172.46s: like it's specifically sized because I
1175.28s: acknowledge what I'm trading and I think
1177.80s: sometimes people forget being able to
1180.32s: flex strategies and sizing based on that
1183.44s: and it's kind of like what you were
1184.40s: talking about before right the idea of
1186.14s: being more greedy when it's time to be
1188.84s: greedy but then knowing when to back off
1190.88s: on that same strategy
1193.22s: um so when you're looking at the rest of
1195.62s: this here are you expecting kind of
1199.40s: stronger Trends so that you can start
1201.80s: kind of sizing in a little bit more or
1203.54s: writing more or are you expecting kind
1205.94s: of this chop throughout the rest of the
1207.44s: year no I mean chopped it like no Trend
1209.66s: ever lasts like even shop won't last you
1211.58s: know uh I I mean I think really one of
1214.46s: two things are going to end up working
1215.72s: like this way like I either the
1217.76s: inflation inflation doesn't start to
1219.14s: fall more than we thought and the FED
1220.40s: can back off
1221.54s: or it stays the way it is and the
1224.24s: economy starts to break down and then
1225.62s: the FED gets scared and it backs off
1227.00s: like either way so you know in my
1230.18s: experience even when I was day trade
1231.50s: even I was doing kind of stuff like you
1232.70s: were doing even I would like day trade
1234.86s: I was taking like small trades I always
1236.96s: made like by far my most amount of money
1239.78s: when I still caught a trend because the
1240.98s: way my mind works I I always played
1242.84s: alongside even I was day trading even in
1244.52s: 08 my first year with the financial
1245.84s: crisis I made money just trading belong
1248.06s: all year I just I would wait I would
1249.62s: change like the parameters as to how
1251.42s: oversold something I had to be before I
1253.04s: would test the waters but even as a day
1254.90s: trader I always play the long side
1257.54s: um but for me it's like when I whenever
1259.22s: I had a strong conviction trade
1261.26s: and I'd be day trading that direction
1263.06s: but keeping kind of a core and building
1264.50s: and always putting on like more more
1267.20s: size I was right those are always the
1269.66s: years of fireworks So and I've noticed
1272.00s: just maybe this is just my own personal
1274.46s: you know character but I've always made
1277.22s: like big chunks of money like in three
1278.90s: four months like in all the the trends
1280.82s: like there's that kind of like that
1282.14s: perfect point where you hit the heater
1283.34s: where it's just like there's like that
1285.26s: ultimate move and if you're positioned
1286.82s: right and you get it right if you can
1288.86s: move your account like you know triple
1290.18s: digit returns like really fast and hard
1292.10s: and then you need to know when to back
1293.42s: off so
1294.56s: for me and you know what's interesting
1296.06s: listen to drucken Miller because
1297.26s: although he's like a global macro guy
1299.18s: and I don't really trade that way I
1300.86s: think the way he views the world and the
1302.54s: way he thinks is really like I align a
1304.40s: lot with him and he was saying something
1305.96s: similar to he's like you know I don't
1307.10s: see a fat pitch he's like but the fed's
1309.14s: gonna fold they're gonna do something
1310.34s: and we're gonna you're gonna get those
1311.72s: windows of opportunity I mean his basis
1313.82s: is that we're kind of like in a decade
1315.26s: like the 70s like a lost decade but
1317.36s: within those you get those one-year
1319.22s: two-year bull markets where there's
1320.66s: sizeable money and
1322.22s: that's like the fractal nature of the
1323.84s: market too even in one year it could be
1325.40s: a one year of junk but if you're patient
1327.02s: you don't grind yourself down you're
1328.46s: gonna get that you don't need more than
1330.08s: three or four if you get a four month
1331.28s: Trend you're positioned properly
1333.26s: like that's fireworks you don't need
1335.18s: more than that if you're if you're an
1336.92s: Adaptive flexible aggressive Trader but
1339.98s: like this past year and a half's been
1341.84s: abnormal I mean we broke we topped in in
1344.84s: late 21 growth top in like February 21.
1347.90s: if you look at the.com crash uh which
1350.72s: was you know kind of also very long but
1352.82s: you had some serious rallies like coming
1354.80s: out of like the tail end level one you
1356.06s: had like a 50 NASDAQ rally off the lows
1358.52s: like it was big like counters this has
1360.74s: kind of been like Drop and chop which is
1363.08s: really kind of like
1364.58s: you're looking back over decades there's
1367.22s: like a handful of these kind of markets
1368.96s: so it is odd but it's okay I mean like
1370.76s: that the market always you know send you
1372.44s: something to give you a curveball if
1373.64s: there's not a Dodge it but uh the
1375.44s: opportunities are going to come they
1376.40s: always come whenever I thought I'd
1377.90s: missed something you wait enough time
1379.64s: and you just Pace in the Market's
1381.02s: another opportunity so yeah it's and
1384.02s: it's interesting and I think that's
1385.64s: actually one of the other things that I
1386.96s: find so impressive about you honestly is
1388.64s: that you go through those Cycles where
1390.14s: you'll have like triple digit three
1391.94s: month return like I've never I literally
1393.98s: have never seen that in my entire career
1395.42s: so it's like it's to me that's such a
1397.76s: cool concept and again so different than
1400.82s: the way that I typically perceive
1403.82s: um the markets I've always been more of
1406.40s: uh
1407.54s: throughout the year I don't have
1409.10s: anything Stellar but I almost know with
1411.68s: certainty where I'm gonna end at the end
1413.36s: of the year almost every single year
1415.52s: um and that I think the way that I've
1417.92s: used that to grow was sizing right is
1421.04s: once once I've you know built that
1423.50s: return over like six seven years I was
1425.30s: like okay I've hit this seven years
1427.16s: consecutively in kind of various markets
1429.38s: I'm okay to start sizing up here and for
1431.78s: a period I was even going levered and
1433.76s: stuff like that to really accelerate but
1436.22s: how did you develop the discipline to
1439.16s: sit and kind of watch things keeping
1441.20s: smaller positions from time to time but
1443.36s: then and being able to successfully
1445.04s: making that transition from looking at
1447.44s: the markets and then saying okay now
1449.66s: it's time to start scaling in is there
1451.52s: kind of like a more rigorous checklist
1453.14s: that you look to see in the markets in
1454.76s: terms of the internals and what not to
1456.26s: provide the support that you think you
1457.70s: need for that Trend I'm fascinated by
1459.92s: that approach so I'm really curious to
1461.36s: understand how you make that transition
1462.62s: mentally it also
1464.84s: um for the longest time I always ran
1467.00s: kind of multiple strategies so I kind of
1468.74s: I always had day trading going on
1470.00s: because I started as a market maker so I
1471.56s: was like my starting point and so I said
1473.90s: kind of thing with you like I knew
1474.86s: almost every month like a cash register
1476.54s: like you just like you take x amount
1477.98s: maybe summer months would get quieter
1479.66s: but during the year was fairly
1481.28s: consistent
1482.48s: and it was more uh when I was running it
1485.06s: that way it was more a little bit of um
1486.98s: you would get a Vibe build it was kind
1489.44s: of like the traitor Instinct you know
1490.52s: like Jesse Livermore I'm sure you've
1491.66s: read like uh reminisce stock operator
1493.28s: and like you would just feel I mean like
1494.78s: you know I always loved economic history
1496.46s: macro Trends so I would get like a
1498.44s: thesis like this Market should explode
1500.18s: and you they would act differently and
1502.22s: that's something like people don't get
1503.96s: like um the same buy signals that will
1506.36s: work in a really good Market would be
1508.04s: garbage in other markets and so when
1509.66s: you're when you're new you're like I
1510.86s: don't understand I made money for nine
1512.54s: months more money than I thought I was
1513.80s: ever gonna make and now I can't make a
1515.66s: penny it's the environment that's
1516.74s: changed so so originally it was kind of
1518.90s: like a um a Vibe and you would see
1521.24s: things moving and then you would press
1522.44s: the bet uh at a certain point it's like
1524.96s: uh I mean I'm not sure with yourself but
1526.64s: like the niche kind of day trading
1527.84s: strategy I was putting like I was
1528.98s: getting too sizable for for what I for
1530.90s: to be able to grow so I said you know
1532.34s: what I have enough Capital where I did
1534.26s: the analysis like you know like I always
1535.64s: tell people there's a business we're
1536.60s: running you know like so what if what if
1537.74s: we hit one year period where markets
1539.90s: suck because I started in 08 so it's not
1541.76s: as if I was like unaware of bad Market
1544.04s: periods and so I got to a point where I
1546.14s: said like I have enough Capital worst
1547.46s: case I'm fine it's not a big deal I'm
1549.32s: sure I'll bake something or whatever
1550.82s: I'll make extra the year after
1552.98s: and so I've built all the tools to make
1554.66s: sure that I would never get off guard
1555.92s: and miss a major Trend at least so I
1558.14s: think there's one um hedge fund manager
1559.82s: Jim roppel is popular on YouTube and
1562.34s: everything and and he he talks with like
1564.32s: the idea of guard rails you know he's
1566.48s: like you know you want to have these
1567.26s: guard rails to make sure you don't kind
1568.46s: of you know it's like it's like the
1569.72s: guardrails won't guide your car as
1571.04s: you're driving but like they make sure
1572.18s: you don't fall off a cliff so like I've
1574.16s: kind of built guardrails into my system
1575.60s: where one you don't get demolished by a
1578.12s: trade but also two you never miss a
1580.64s: major Trend like when I was uh when I
1582.68s: was younger I don't know if you know
1583.88s: Ralph at campora one of the co-founders
1585.38s: of the CMT Association so he used to
1587.42s: come to Montreal a lot where I was
1588.74s: running the chapter and then I ran the
1590.24s: national technical analysis organization
1592.16s: here and I remember him talking saying
1594.68s: that you know the biggest mistake you
1595.82s: can make in this business because I was
1597.02s: young I was like 21 and he was already
1598.52s: like the Godfather of technical analysis
1600.14s: and he's a super nice guy and he told me
1602.24s: the biggest mistake you could make is
1603.32s: like get on the wrong side of a major
1604.82s: trends like never ever get on the wrong
1607.16s: side of a major Trend so I always kind
1608.72s: of took that to heart so I've made these
1610.22s: like guideline rules where just like you
1612.56s: know it's a kind of full circle from our
1613.88s: talk before even if I'm out or I'm
1615.50s: trading light I have these rules that
1617.42s: will force me okay I have to find
1619.40s: something to buy or I have to build
1621.02s: exposure because I my risk is you stay
1624.20s: you stay on the sidelines you got
1625.88s: comfortable maybe you get a little bit
1627.44s: lazy and you miss out on the opportunity
1629.72s: you've been waiting for so I always have
1631.04s: these like strong technical guidelines
1632.48s: to keep me
1633.62s: um looking in the right areas got it and
1635.96s: so for like a lay Trader we don't have
1638.24s: to go super far in the detail on your
1639.68s: guidelines but what are some of the
1640.88s: things that they could start to look at
1642.56s: to help them with that
1645.08s: uh so you can look at different ways um
1647.24s: you can look you could have just like
1648.50s: you know General Trend rules like you
1650.78s: know above key averages or you know
1652.76s: that's like really simplified I think
1654.62s: there's I think there's drawbacks to
1656.36s: that because uh it's um you have whip
1658.82s: saws like I know Ray dalio originally's
1661.28s: original systems had moving averages and
1662.96s: things and he eventually moved away from
1664.22s: that because of the drawbacks and I've
1665.90s: seen some of those too so I prefer
1667.10s: Market breadth because especially like
1669.14s: the way I trade
1671.48s: um
1672.50s: like there's also three four month
1674.12s: environments where things rock and roll
1675.98s: where you really want to be exposed and
1677.78s: there's a certain kind of um uh kind of
1680.66s: construction to what those environments
1681.98s: look like you know something like
1683.48s: similar like to like a fragile price
1684.92s: like a banking Panic you know people you
1686.42s: just had in March if you look at the
1687.50s: action in March if you look at like
1688.88s: covet drop like even bad markets have a
1690.98s: certain character to them so these kind
1693.02s: of like great environments have a
1694.34s: certain character for me market breadth
1695.84s: like the internals the way they're
1697.34s: acting whether they're accelerating or
1698.72s: decelerating above key thresholds to me
1701.12s: that's a better indication is the
1702.50s: overall participation so like I like to
1705.32s: focus on growth growth tends to be on
1707.18s: the speculative Spectrum like the the
1708.98s: jump your stocks like iot so those do
1711.50s: well when there's confidence so when a
1713.66s: lot of stocks are participating they'll
1715.70s: start to participate as well but they go
1717.26s: vertical when people are unsure kind of
1719.24s: like now large cap work you know so
1721.28s: that's why you're seeing like you know
1722.36s: the biggest names like Microsoft Dominic
1724.28s: you're not going to get firework returns
1725.84s: because this thing's a two trillion
1726.80s: dollar company but it'll Edge higher if
1729.32s: you're looking at the index indexes you
1730.64s: feel bad to say hey look the nasdaq's
1732.50s: moving up but it's like five Mega stocks
1734.42s: pushing it higher whereas most stocks
1735.98s: are getting killed so for me to kind of
1738.14s: give myself like a realistic benchmark I
1740.18s: use Market breath and like key
1741.62s: thresholds to know when the
1743.36s: participation is rising yeah I love that
1746.24s: and it's actually one of the things that
1748.04s: I started trading because like you I
1749.66s: started in 07 and the only reason why I
1752.06s: didn't blow up is because I was just
1753.62s: starting and I was too scared to like
1755.00s: put a bunch of money out
1756.80s: um but I started looking at kind of a
1761.60s: Faber's sector rotation strategy and I
1764.84s: think that got me not necessarily to the
1767.54s: same degree of sophistication that you
1769.04s: have you know with your Market breath
1770.54s: analysis but we do look at a lot of
1772.94s: similar things I think because you've
1774.32s: talked about things like net highs lows
1776.90s: within you know what in exchange or
1779.18s: whatever I look at that I don't know if
1781.04s: you use like tick and Trend do you use
1782.54s: either of those no you know I never got
1784.22s: into them I never I never really kind of
1785.84s: called out to me yeah because I I
1788.18s: started using tick Trend and then like
1790.58s: an average weighted Trend and then kind
1792.32s: of made like a composite indicator with
1794.96s: both of them combined which is yeah it's
1797.36s: almost like a mat it's almost like a
1798.50s: macd for moving averages just using
1800.12s: Trend
1801.26s: um but what other like decent breath
1804.44s: indicators do you talk about that people
1806.54s: can find out or do you think people
1808.82s: should look into
1810.44s: so I I try and like um like you know my
1813.44s: study of like technical analysis like
1814.76s: I'm a charter Market technician so I
1816.38s: studied so many tools a lot of them
1818.24s: become redundant you know like I
1819.68s: remember like it's kind of like the
1821.18s: Elixir or you come and you think I have
1822.74s: enough lines on my chart I'll get enough
1824.84s: information but so I got to the point
1826.94s: where kind of like I'm sure like with
1828.20s: your military background like you'll
1829.52s: appreciate it's like you know every
1830.78s: everything I'm using needs a specific
1832.94s: purpose like I need to know why it's
1834.38s: there like I don't want to carry around
1835.64s: extra bulk for no reason like you want
1837.38s: to be efficient so I have like so there
1839.84s: are many breath tools you can use even
1841.46s: though it's a different like you know
1842.30s: that you call them like breath thrusts
1843.74s: you know where there's like massive yeah
1845.48s: so there's like variation upon variation
1847.70s: and so early on I think when most people
1849.68s: start they kind of feel like well the
1851.42s: more I have the more signals the more
1852.98s: powerful the signal but not necessarily
1854.78s: it probably you end up with like
1856.58s: analysis paralysis where you just can't
1858.62s: make a decision so I really kind of so I
1861.56s: know of more tools I've studied more but
1863.36s: I really keep kind of net highs net lows
1865.16s: and I also look at the advanced decline
1866.54s: line I use them really for different
1868.16s: things so Advanced decline I kind of
1870.26s: look for longer term divergences just
1872.36s: kind of tell where I am in the cycle of
1874.58s: the market you know so early on you'll
1876.56s: see a lot of participation and as like
1878.48s: the Mark gets older and a little more
1881.24s: tired it starts to kind of break down so
1882.92s: it's kind of like a bigger picture of
1884.12s: you and the net highs and lows are kind
1886.16s: of more my intermediate type of view
1888.50s: yeah I I love that and I think using
1891.20s: both of them in concert makes a lot of
1893.06s: sense and your comment there reminds me
1894.92s: of one of my favorite quotes I tell
1896.12s: people which is uh Simplicity is the
1898.04s: ultimate sophistication and yeah Da
1900.44s: Vinci said that and I talk about that a
1902.66s: lot with Traders because I feel like we
1904.10s: all go through this parabolic curve
1905.60s: where we don't know anything we don't
1907.34s: know how to use anything then we find
1908.78s: everything we try to use everything and
1910.34s: then we scrap most of it and use a few
1912.32s: things that we probably saw the first
1913.58s: few days that we started and you know I
1915.92s: I feel like that exists in a lot of
1917.72s: disciplines like I mean I play guitar
1919.04s: and like so when you start you want like
1921.02s: a million guitar pedals and effects and
1922.82s: then after you look at like these
1923.78s: legendary guitarists and all they want
1925.22s: is like a 1968 Fender Stratocaster with
1927.62s: a clean amp and they play and you're
1929.30s: like how does it sound so good and then
1931.28s: you have like you're doing a tap dance
1932.54s: with like guitar pedals before so I feel
1934.76s: like I I feel it's maybe something of
1936.20s: like just like of like learning in
1937.94s: general like like every you know anyone
1941.12s: who's great at something I find they'll
1942.62s: say like oh it's simple but it's almost
1944.06s: like you have to learn all the
1945.02s: complexities before you can get back to
1946.46s: Simplicity and that's kind of like the I
1948.32s: think the way of life almost for a lot
1949.94s: of stuff dude I I literally could not
1952.76s: agree more with you I think going
1954.14s: through that phase of throwing
1955.88s: everything at the wall seeing what's
1957.26s: sticking because especially in trading
1959.36s: specifically but then also on like
1960.68s: basketball or I know jack about
1963.32s: guitar but my best friend plays so I
1965.84s: listen to him sometimes
1967.46s: um but I agree with you we're like
1969.02s: everybody has their slight Nuance for
1971.60s: like what works sense for them or like
1973.64s: what makes sense for them what works for
1975.14s: them what kind of mentally clicks so I
1977.90s: think that makes a like a ton of sense
1980.00s: especially with complex systems because
1981.98s: if you leave them to be too complex for
1983.54s: too long they're kind of really
1985.04s: difficult to manage speaking of the the
1988.46s: bank movements that we were talking
1989.84s: about before what do you make of the new
1992.36s: stuff that we're seeing with FRC do you
1995.66s: foresee kind of this credit crunch
1998.30s: expanding or do you think that they're
2000.46s: doing their best to kind of localize it
2002.02s: as much as they can so that it doesn't
2003.40s: become a bigger problem well I think
2005.38s: they're trying to localize it but
2006.64s: there's an inherent like actual problem
2009.16s: the FED has made with the market where
2010.90s: like by raising rates so fast and banks
2013.66s: are not raising their deposit rates it's
2015.04s: just in everyone's interest to pull
2016.42s: their money out of their checking
2017.50s: account and go put it into like a money
2019.60s: market fund or a brokerage account
2021.58s: that's paying a higher rate like why
2023.02s: would you stay with one percent when you
2025.24s: can get five you know so so it's like
2027.52s: you're just like giving everyone and you
2031.24s: know it's like Charlie Munger would say
2032.38s: like show me the incentive and I'll show
2033.70s: you what people will do so like the
2034.90s: longer you keep this on people talk say
2036.58s: like hey you're getting one percent like
2037.90s: put in this money market fund you can
2039.40s: pull it out tomorrow you're not locked
2040.84s: in but you get like five or four and a
2042.82s: half or whatever it is uh at the time
2044.44s: you know so
2045.70s: I I think the fed's kind of hoping that
2047.86s: they can kind of beat inflation fast
2049.18s: enough uh so then they can kind of they
2051.82s: can go back lower to kind of stop us in
2053.80s: Balance but that's where a lot of this
2054.94s: is coming from and a lot of banks I'm
2056.44s: sure are concerned uh that you know the
2058.78s: longer there's a disbalance like you
2060.10s: know that that deposit money you know
2062.44s: it's kind of you know Bank Banks do so
2063.82s: much at the end of the day the majority
2065.44s: of their business is like banking
2066.58s: one-on-one they try and expand for more
2068.56s: profit but like the bulk core of what
2070.30s: they do is banking 101.
2072.76s: um so but this interest rate environment
2075.22s: is causing
2076.72s: um
2078.16s: um a breakdown of that normal system
2080.02s: it's kind of forcing away these these
2082.06s: easy deposits from from depositors to
2083.98s: these money market funds where where
2085.54s: Banks institutions don't make as much
2087.04s: money with with this and they can with
2088.78s: re-lending out deposits so
2090.94s: I don't know it's just a it's a really
2093.28s: kind of wild scenario it's like kind of
2095.20s: like and it's kind of scary in a sense
2096.52s: because they're kind of putting a patch
2097.60s: on top of a patch on top of a patch to
2099.10s: fix a problem yes but uh at a certain
2101.50s: point they better get to a solution or
2103.24s: you know things get calm again
2104.38s: complexity the more complex the scenario
2106.90s: the more likelihood of breakdown so we
2108.64s: want this to kind of resolve itself
2110.26s: sooner rather than later
2111.70s: dude I was a little surprised I expected
2114.22s: Regional Banks to be under pressure
2115.60s: after SMB like I felt like that was like
2118.42s: a good canary in the coal mine bad bad
2120.76s: practices right like their Risk
2122.26s: Management Department completely
2123.70s: the bed fine you know that happens but I
2126.04s: did see that happening I was like that's
2127.54s: kind of interesting and then what's
2129.94s: going on with FRC that makes me a little
2132.40s: more concerned for just kind of these
2134.56s: smaller Regional Banks because I imagine
2136.66s: what's happening to them is probably
2137.98s: happening elsewhere
2140.08s: um is is there a tradable opportunity
2143.26s: there on the rebound from that kind of
2145.96s: sector for you or do you prefer to wait
2148.84s: until there's established strength
2151.24s: across the full sector before you start
2153.16s: dabbling
2155.50s: so you know it's not really like a
2157.36s: specialty of mine it's the kind of play
2158.80s: those but like even when I was day
2160.48s: trading I always kind of tried to kind
2161.92s: of move away from these specialty
2163.42s: situations because all this like news
2164.92s: will come out and it's like whenever you
2167.08s: get into these really
2168.88s: you know unique situations this these
2171.34s: are what you know it's kind of like the
2172.42s: specialist versus the generalist type of
2173.98s: you know discussion and and these are
2176.20s: the scenarios where the specialist
2177.76s: really gets ahead like it's rare it's
2179.56s: like you know it's like you're a
2180.76s: specialist in financial services and
2182.08s: it's like you could be stuck in the
2183.76s: wilderness for like 10 years like
2185.38s: waiting for like some real juice to come
2187.42s: into your sector and then when it does
2188.50s: like okay then it's really your
2189.52s: opportunity to deliver Alpha but for
2191.50s: someone on the outside where it's like
2192.94s: there's all these kind of like my new
2194.74s: differences it's like a hard place to
2196.48s: kind of swim so for me it's more a
2198.40s: matter of like I don't really care what
2200.44s: happens with with regional Banks you
2202.00s: know I I just you know as long as not
2203.44s: systemic and everything else kind of
2204.76s: like improves that'll bring you know
2206.80s: risk on elsewhere and then that kind of
2208.36s: opens up the gates for big profits
2209.92s: elsewhere but like to kind of swoop in
2211.30s: and try and find like the undervalued
2213.28s: Regional Bank it's not really my like
2214.72s: Forte got it yeah that makes a ton of
2217.36s: sense and I was always curious with
2218.80s: something like this if there was
2221.50s: at least based on your your studies like
2223.72s: a large return to a mean post
2227.62s: you know the Catalyst coming to a
2229.96s: conclusion because I feel like as I look
2232.12s: at the the financial sector right now
2233.74s: most people are like okay how bad is
2235.84s: this and then at least from a volatility
2239.02s: perspective the way that I would view
2241.78s: that is volatility will be high until we
2244.24s: come to a conclusion until we know the
2245.74s: answer and then volatility will
2247.12s: naturally contract because now we have
2248.80s: the answer and I didn't know that was a
2251.02s: tradable event for your kind of style
2253.30s: but it makes a ton of sense too because
2254.62s: I've been talking a lot about that too
2256.12s: where
2257.08s: it does feel like it's I call it an
2259.42s: emotional Market it doesn't really mean
2260.86s: anything right there's a words
2262.12s: but it does feel like every different
2264.22s: headline I see there's people pitching a
2266.62s: fit about something and I'm wondering
2269.86s: you know when we're looking at the broad
2271.84s: landscape talking about inflation a
2273.88s: second ago my underlying hypothesis is
2277.60s: that it will probably be around for a
2280.30s: bit that's my guess I again I'm this
2282.22s: just a idiot sit in my house so
2284.62s: what do I know not much but I am like
2287.38s: from your perspective are you seeing
2290.38s: inflation being something that once we
2292.84s: go through the rate hike perceivably in
2295.18s: what a couple days then we'll kind of
2297.88s: whatever happens with rates throughout
2299.68s: the rest of the year but are you
2301.06s: expecting inflation to kind of stay
2303.04s: leveled out for most of this year then
2305.68s: maybe coming down next like how do you
2307.18s: view the inflation picture because for
2308.86s: me I it just it doesn't seem like it's
2311.32s: responding super aggressively to what's
2312.94s: been done even so far
2314.80s: you know inflation's that one of those
2316.60s: uh interesting things like especially
2318.46s: with Finance like now there's Financial
2319.66s: engineering and they try and turn into a
2321.46s: science when it comes down to things
2323.14s: like money and inflation like if you
2325.12s: there's like these Geniuses like um uh
2327.94s: Ludwig von mises like like the Austrian
2329.80s: School of Economics like like just like
2331.72s: they were like brilliant in terms of
2333.52s: like they had like philosophical views
2335.14s: of money and all of this but like when
2336.82s: it comes down to like again all this
2338.98s: fluff like with banking all the try this
2340.60s: and that when it comes to like banking
2341.92s: 101 is inflation is just competence in
2344.08s: the currency and the amount of you know
2345.58s: supply versus demand
2347.20s: and so if people start to believe that
2348.88s: inflation will stick around that's that
2350.44s: alone will make inflation stick around
2351.82s: you ask for a raise and you ask for a
2353.56s: raise and the products go up so the
2354.82s: aspirin of the raise so it's really in
2357.04s: the fed's interests everyone's interest
2358.72s: to really destroy inflation before it
2361.78s: becomes entrenched so like they're
2363.22s: looking at like you know estimates like
2365.20s: people like forward you know they do
2366.82s: polls like forward expectations for
2368.32s: inflation this and that
2369.76s: it seems anchored so that's what I think
2371.74s: the economists are concerned about but
2372.94s: economists just sometimes getting really
2374.14s: wrong like the polls just don't really
2376.06s: adequately explain what people are
2377.62s: feeling so they better get under control
2379.84s: because uh the other side of that is
2382.66s: then like a very deep deeper longer
2385.00s: recession because you got to go really
2386.26s: aggressive with rates
2387.82s: so I I'm not sure like again it like
2390.70s: this Powell like back off the second
2392.92s: they see a recession kind of coming or
2394.78s: if the market starts to break down to be
2396.28s: back off right away does inflation
2397.48s: surprise and finally really drop off
2399.28s: like core core numbers have been sticky
2401.50s: so core like X food and energy you know
2404.02s: like uh the FED doesn't really care
2405.28s: about food and they figure look it's out
2406.60s: of our control like what the rain is and
2408.76s: whether there's like a country invading
2410.62s: other we can't really control food and
2412.90s: energy but like the rest the core is
2414.76s: critical and that has stopped coming
2416.50s: down which is I think a big concern for
2418.84s: everyone so
2420.34s: they're gonna go up another quarter
2422.50s: um I think what makes this cycle really
2424.18s: different than like other ones of the
2425.80s: past when you kind of look at the 70s
2427.30s: early 80s even 1990 is debt levels now
2430.66s: are so much higher than the past so you
2433.84s: know going from zero to five is
2435.64s: astronomically right more now than it
2439.06s: was 30 years ago I mean back then there
2441.22s: weren't even like no mortgage products
2443.14s: and although the same way you know what
2444.64s: credit card is there the way they are
2445.84s: now so
2446.98s: we'll have to see I I think it's really
2448.96s: I would it's better that the fed you
2451.00s: know we take our medicine and the market
2452.74s: is not great for a bit but we get back
2454.84s: to normalcy then if inflation gets
2456.46s: entrenched it ends up being a long-term
2458.44s: problem which is is bad for everyone
2460.90s: yeah and it's the the thing I find so
2463.48s: curious about it all is it seems like
2464.98s: that we're already starting to see
2466.24s: things break right and from what we're
2468.70s: seeing from the FED like I think most
2470.02s: people agree like we have more to go in
2472.66s: order to get this thing under wrap so
2473.92s: it's it almost feels like how how well
2475.84s: can we keep things strapped together
2477.64s: until we do get things high enough rates
2481.00s: high enough to control inflation which
2482.98s: leads me to the to the last thing I want
2484.48s: to wrap up with here um because I know
2486.04s: you got to run in a second
2487.78s: um earnings so far
2489.40s: what are your general thoughts impressed
2491.02s: not impressed in line with expectations
2492.58s: outside of expectations how do you feel
2494.32s: about them yeah I think uh I think
2496.60s: what's the good part is they're not
2498.10s: terrible like there's some good some bad
2499.78s: kind of mixed I think like the bigger
2501.16s: the company the more pricing power like
2503.68s: the better the company's doing so you
2505.30s: and you're seeing and again typical of
2507.34s: the economic cycle right like in not
2509.14s: great times big companies do better
2510.52s: because Apple has more pricing power
2511.96s: than you know John's uh you know John's
2514.48s: Bike Shop you know like obviously like
2515.98s: apple people really want an Apple phone
2518.02s: so like kind of in line but nothing
2520.06s: great
2521.38s: um but it's early you know like like
2523.12s: this whole inflation higher interest
2524.20s: rates like I I don't think it's so much
2526.36s: going from zero to five which that is a
2528.34s: huge move but staying at five like If
2530.68s: the Fed stays at five for longer like
2532.48s: think about every time the longer we
2534.34s: stay here every month that goes by
2535.66s: that's more people who's you know car
2537.28s: leases come to you and now they have to
2538.96s: make the decision that you know rates
2540.34s: that were 0.99 or maybe 7.99 you know or
2543.28s: or people's mortgages come so the longer
2545.26s: you stay here the more interest rate
2546.76s: debt products kind of reset themselves
2548.98s: at higher rates and the kind of like the
2552.04s: way everything becomes Amplified so I
2554.26s: think it's a bit early because they just
2555.34s: really jack up rates like at the tail
2556.66s: end of last year so maybe you know
2559.12s: companies can get still get by it'll be
2561.10s: really interesting to see if this kind
2562.24s: of persists
2563.50s: so um a lot on the FED I don't think we
2565.72s: go much higher if you look even in the
2567.22s: 80s it's when volcker basically took
2569.20s: rates above the inflation rate that
2571.12s: inflation was killed
2572.62s: and so we're basically there if you look
2574.24s: at cores let's say 4.6 or whatever so it
2576.46s: rates at five percent you're basically
2578.62s: there how long do we stay here how weak
2581.08s: the economy gets you know how quick all
2583.24s: these rates reset it's like big
2585.22s: questions man it's hard to tell I I find
2586.96s: you know sometimes we try to know what's
2589.00s: going to happen next sometimes it's like
2590.50s: unknowable I mean if you ask if you look
2592.18s: at the FED they have like 30 000 people
2593.62s: working for them best data in the world
2595.18s: and Powell will say well I don't know
2596.92s: what's gonna happen next we'll have to
2597.94s: see what the data is so you know they're
2599.38s: kind of like you said like be in your
2600.52s: basement and say like I know exactly
2601.96s: what's going to happen I think that's
2603.10s: kind of like you know uh being a little
2604.84s: bit um over the top you know so I that's
2606.76s: why I kind of when times are really
2608.68s: unsure like I always try to have a
2610.18s: strong view but when times are really
2611.44s: unsure I default to my tools and and
2613.84s: it's kind of like you know most of the
2615.70s: time you're flying a plane you're
2616.66s: looking out you know the the window to
2618.46s: see what's going on but if it's a bad
2619.78s: storm you just I can't have no
2621.16s: visibility I go back to my my indicators
2624.10s: and that's kind of what I do in this
2625.66s: environment it's proven well so I can't
2627.76s: complain too much yeah it makes a ton of
2630.04s: sense and it's funny I always think that
2632.38s: there's is a delicate balance because
2633.94s: for me I'm naturally interested in
2636.94s: markets and economics I think the way
2639.52s: that the systems work are fascinating
2641.38s: but I couldn't agree more with you on
2643.66s: the point that there's a difference
2644.62s: between that general interest in trading
2646.72s: and I always tell people like if you are
2649.96s: more concerned about being right in a
2652.12s: prediction than having like positive
2654.16s: expectancy you're gonna it's gonna be
2655.96s: real tough go man it's difficult
2657.76s: to be right in the markets
2660.04s: um the very last question I lied to you
2661.66s: the very last question because you said
2663.10s: something that's made me super
2664.18s: interested
2665.80s: um based on the homework you've done
2667.60s: before to me it seems like we raised
2670.72s: rates pretty quickly in a relatively
2673.42s: compressed time frame you have do
2676.68s: on what the unwind might look like do
2680.92s: you think that it would be a parabolic
2682.96s: drop because to me that sounds dangerous
2685.36s: just by severity but I haven't done that
2687.76s: much homework to be honest with you
2688.78s: unlike the the actual coming downside so
2690.88s: I'd love your thoughts there
2693.22s: well it usually does start to happen
2694.72s: pretty quick and if you look at like
2696.04s: historical precedent that's how it
2697.36s: happens because
2699.10s: like if you look at what the FED is but
2700.66s: like I said and he's right Powell I have
2703.00s: to say at least he's right you know the
2704.44s: the um the risk of doing too little is
2707.20s: worse than doing too much because like
2708.70s: it the fed's point of view is like if
2710.32s: things get bad we could always just drop
2711.58s: a ton of money and everybody's lap and
2712.96s: everything's fixed but if inflation
2714.16s: expectations get unhinged then like I
2717.04s: said that that's a long process to break
2719.08s: so I think they naturally even if they
2721.84s: won't articulate it and uh you know
2723.82s: three quarters of the FED is trying to
2725.56s: understand what they're really saying
2726.76s: but they would rather kind of push
2728.38s: things too far and start to break things
2730.30s: so and after they say oh stops breaking
2732.22s: now let's quick quick let's like throw
2733.60s: the kitchen sink at it so typically they
2735.64s: push it to a point where it gets pretty
2737.02s: rough and then they have to get
2738.10s: aggressive to fix it but that usually
2739.96s: does work to fix things but um you know
2742.66s: it's like again complexity
2744.82s: the FED because of this this way that
2746.92s: they've been working
2748.36s: they keep taking a bigger and bigger
2749.92s: role in the economy I mean when they
2751.06s: first started in 1913 it was supposed to
2753.22s: be just lender of Last Resort like you
2754.78s: know like FRC for example we're out of
2756.34s: money okay here's some money you've gone
2758.26s: from that to like
2759.76s: controlling the entire economy different
2762.28s: that you know you have you have QE
2763.84s: buying bonds and controlling Banking and
2766.24s: repo and and so like their hands are
2768.40s: everywhere and and I I said just
2770.74s: everyone read the book The Lords of
2771.88s: Finance
2773.32s: um which is basically like a recount of
2775.18s: like the the um the Federal Reserve the
2777.46s: different Bankers in uh I forget the era
2779.80s: was now it was like the early 1900s and
2782.56s: where we kind of always feel looking at
2784.06s: these these people talk like oh that
2785.56s: they know what's going on and then 2021
2788.20s: is a perfect example where inflation
2789.82s: which to some great investors was so
2792.04s: obvious I mean you guys like drucken
2793.90s: Miller Tudor Jones like the same names
2795.40s: like we're saying like look at relations
2796.66s: coming and it's like these other guys
2798.28s: who are supposed to have all the data
2799.72s: all the people totally blindsided by
2802.06s: like the worst inflation in like 40
2803.56s: years
2804.58s: so it's kind of like to think that they
2806.50s: know exactly like you know people like
2808.48s: like to have this false sense of
2810.10s: confidence makes them feel good like oh
2811.60s: don't worry we're under control
2813.76s: um but the the FED doesn't always really
2815.74s: know quite what's right I mean I think
2817.00s: 2021 they're they're transitory
2818.74s: inflation call which like was
2819.94s: historically bad
2821.86s: um like they're kind of going along and
2823.42s: what what I think is extra tough is like
2825.70s: they definitely have like Ivory Tower
2826.96s: syndrome or like they're disconnected
2828.52s: from what the average person is going
2829.72s: through so they're looking at their
2830.68s: models and this and that and
2832.60s: sometimes boots on the ground is like
2834.34s: just the only way you can get a sense of
2835.78s: stuff especially in complicated periods
2837.28s: and the fact that their role keeps
2839.20s: getting more and more complex with more
2840.76s: like I mean like look you know because
2842.38s: they have like uh they've affected rates
2844.12s: and they have the repo Market that now
2845.74s: affected FRC you know because of you
2848.08s: know this this spread between money
2849.22s: markets and and so it's like you're
2850.96s: having all these second third order
2852.34s: effects that get so complicated that
2854.86s: like I don't envy the fed's position
2856.48s: gets it gets like tougher and look and
2858.58s: it's like I always say you know like you
2860.14s: know the United States is like
2861.82s: like the like the best historical
2863.56s: experiment ever like free markets and
2865.60s: capitalism but like since the Federal
2867.40s: Reserve like there's this like small
2868.66s: Central planner who's like at the core
2870.16s: of it that like made his way in where
2871.54s: he's trying to control the price of
2872.80s: money and interest rates which
2874.84s: is you know like that's why central
2876.52s: planning and Soviet Union failed is
2878.38s: because it's an inferior system but yet
2880.18s: the fed's taking it bigger bigger enroll
2881.92s: trying to like be a central planner and
2883.96s: it's a tough job it's a tough job yeah
2885.88s: yeah man dude huge information I can't
2888.76s: thank you enough especially for that
2890.02s: last part because that's that's some
2891.34s: homework I have to do like I literally I
2893.38s: haven't studied the unwind nearly as
2895.90s: much as I've studied the the ramping
2897.70s: because typically the unwind is tradable
2900.22s: at least based on what I've seen in my
2901.66s: limited experience
2903.46s: um so I I gotta check out some some more
2905.62s: historic precedent on the unwind and see
2907.42s: yeah just kind of see what kind of trade
2909.34s: this is we can come up with but
2911.08s: thank you so much for jumping on the uh
2913.36s: Dow liar podcast brother it's honestly
2915.34s: it's great to chat with you I love
2916.72s: hearing your thoughts in the markets
2918.46s: what you're looking at and then for
2919.96s: people that want to get a hold of you
2921.46s: I'll drop your Twitter in the notes
2923.14s: below along with your website is there
2924.82s: anywhere else that they should look for
2926.32s: you yeah I started putting some videos
2928.48s: on YouTube as well so if they're
2929.56s: watching this on YouTube you can check
2931.06s: out Caruso insights and try and do
2933.10s: something as markets are quieter I say
2934.66s: you know let me do like the odd film and
2937.24s: this and that different educational
2938.26s: things so uh they can check me on
2940.12s: YouTube as well wait I'll make sure
2942.16s: that's in the notes and until next time
2943.60s: we'll catch everybody later
2945.46s: thanks
