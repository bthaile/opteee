0.64s: what's going on everybody big day today
2.60s: the markets were very very active we
4.84s: have this scenario where the E minis the
7.84s: S&P 500 futures are up as well as
11.84s: volatility this is not the relationship
14.84s: that most people think in terms of you
17.24s: never see volatility rise with something
20.76s: like the S&P 500 but it does happen from
24.32s: time to time now this past weekend
27.44s: obviously was a little bit tumultuous
29.60s: and I think the market is trying to
31.96s: digest what happened we talked a little
34.72s: bit about this during a couple live
36.40s: streams this weekend so I'm not going to
38.64s: dive far into that just know that the
40.76s: market right now is more active that's
42.92s: the way I would look at it we had the
44.96s: S&P 500 up 0.4% the small caps have been
49.00s: flying off the handle they are now
51.60s: almost I mean take a look from their
54.28s: open on the 10th we came in at 20482
60.04s: and we hit a high of 2219 and this is
62.48s: over the course of four trading days
64.68s: that's just an insane rally a lot of
67.96s: this has to do with the market trying to
70.36s: price in who they think is likely going
73.00s: to be the next president and then
75.20s: discounting the subsequent impact that
78.00s: that will have on the markets that's the
79.28s: broad nutshell of what's going on here
82.00s: that's a big reason why you're seeing
83.32s: the Russell respond so strong because
85.96s: the current restrictive environment in
87.64s: terms of rates is difficult for small
90.04s: caps to survive they are able to
93.44s: obviously maintain but it's been a
95.60s: really tough year for small caps for at
98.04s: large if you take a look over at the
100.72s: financial sector which is a pretty big
102.72s: component these are all just small
104.76s: Financial well small relative to the S&P
107.04s: 500 they're smaller most of them are
109.04s: still pretty large market cap um over a
112.08s: billion dollars but that it's difficult
115.16s: the current environment is difficult for
116.44s: them so with the expectation now of of
120.20s: trump potentially winning the presidency
122.08s: again I'm not here to be political I
123.64s: don't care I'm just talking about what
124.96s: the market is seeing and you can look at
126.96s: things I shared this again over the
128.40s: weekend the Bloomberg Terminals and
130.52s: there's a lot of websites that project
132.36s: the probability of the outcome so that's
134.08s: literally all that's happening here so
137.08s: that's something you should be aware of
138.64s: just the broader environment that we're
140.68s: in but more importantly let's take a
143.32s: look at GameStop because we have a lot
146.48s: going on here we are now breaking up
149.20s: above the this point of control that's
151.00s: been established for some time now at
152.84s: like 26 and A2 we closed today at 27 up
156.64s: 3.65% it's one of our bigger days
159.24s: recently and it's still on a relative
161.72s: small basis there's nothing to be super
163.64s: excited about just yet but there are the
167.60s: conditions forming that get interesting
170.28s: so there's a lot of conversation about
172.56s: some of these different cycles that
174.04s: might be coming up we know from the live
176.08s: stream this past weekend with Newton
177.92s: that he's looking at August still for
180.12s: this next Tailwind cycle and we're doing
183.56s: another live stream this coming Saturday
185.52s: so you guys can check us out on that one
187.64s: as well same time and place 5:00 P p.m.
190.60s: Pacific Time on YouTube live but to this
194.64s: I'm seeing this floor continuing to
196.80s: raise we are slowly slowly ascending
199.84s: here if I take us into like a 30-day
202.00s: chart you can see that we are creeping
204.16s: up and up and up so the moving averages
206.28s: are starting to align that kind of stuff
208.32s: I always am careful to say that I don't
210.68s: really care that much about a bunch of
213.12s: standard technical analysis in here
214.92s: because the way that this moves is so
217.40s: different that's not to say somebody
219.48s: said in a comment that they they thought
221.08s: I was scared to do technical analysis
223.44s: because people might try to beat me up
224.96s: for doing that it's not it at all it has
227.80s: everything to do with me understanding
229.96s: how this product moves and I'm very
232.16s: cautious to say well this is support and
234.84s: then this is resistance in something
237.12s: like this that just it doesn't care it
239.12s: doesn't care it's built on a much
242.20s: broader functional backend that leads to
245.80s: this kind of behavior right cuz here's
248.28s: your support then it got broken and
250.24s: completely violated and then here's your
251.88s: next support like the the probability of
254.80s: a normal product going from 18 to 64 in
259.20s: a couple days then back down and then
261.60s: back up from 22 hitting a high of 50
265.16s: almost that that's you that's not normal
268.00s: that's what makes it so special so so I
270.64s: reiterate that to people so that they
272.84s: understand that I'm a Trader that's what
275.20s: I do is I look at things to trade but it
278.72s: is really important to understand the
280.40s: individual products and the nuances of
283.24s: them and this is a very nuanced product
285.76s: speaking of all of the Nuance let's take
288.08s: a look now at the options because things
290.60s: are getting interesting the first thing
292.96s: I want to start with is this right
295.80s: here right now at the 30s expiring 19
300.68s: July there was over
302.56s: 40,000 volume transacted today now I am
307.24s: very eager to see what this transaction
310.72s: volume is going to look like tomorrow we
313.88s: can get some ideas right so if we grab a
316.48s: tool like this you can use thinker swim
318.28s: it also has this uh sort of information
321.12s: this just makes it a little easier to
322.48s: see I believe so if we come in here and
324.96s: we look at this coming expiration cycle
327.00s: and we limit us to the 30s the reason
330.56s: why I want to do this is because I want
332.28s: to see of that 40,000 oi how many of
335.36s: those are buying or
337.12s: sales because my guess is if the
341.68s: majority of that volume is buys that's a
343.92s: lot of added pressure so this is right
345.84s: now filtering by purchases and I see a
349.36s: th there it doesn't look like a ton so
353.08s: then let's take a look at
355.20s: sales and it also doesn't look like a
357.40s: ton so it looks like a bit of a mixed
359.00s: bag is is what I'm picking up here the
362.56s: stuff that transacts at the mid you
364.36s: can't really tell what's going on there
367.00s: let's take a quick look in this filter
370.24s: which will give us a little bit more of
371.68s: a comprehensive View and I will filter
375.32s: it by just the calls I want to look at
378.12s: just this series and I want to look at
380.72s: the 30s
382.84s: only and we'll get a sense of kind of
387.00s: how many were bought versus sold the
389.92s: reason why I'm doing it in here is
391.64s: platforms like unusual whales they're
394.44s: limiting by larger transactions they're
396.72s: not showing us every single transaction
399.24s: they're trying to find the more
400.20s: interesting things right like the whales
402.68s: this is time in sales this shows us
404.68s: everything so you'll see that the vast
407.08s: majority of volume today interestingly
409.08s: at the
409.92s: 30s actually was pretty small so we see
413.24s: these blocks of 20s and then it just
415.40s: drops to small trades we have 15s 10
419.76s: tons of those tens and as I scroll
423.20s: through this it's a healthy
425.80s: mix of buys and sales that's what I can
430.08s: tell so right now I'm just scanning for
432.84s: the colors literally and I'm kind of
435.56s: making a general guess at the lean of
438.32s: the colors which it does look like
440.88s: slightly green heavy buys but there's a
443.40s: lot of sales in here too so this just
445.44s: looks like a ton of transactions that's
447.40s: kind of the
448.52s: takeaway from this at least in my
451.52s: perspective is we are seeing a lot of
454.28s: people transacting at those 30s it's
456.08s: very busy but a lot of that does not
458.68s: look like buys which that's why it is
461.48s: hanging out up here with over 40,000
464.96s: contracts traded today it's massive so
467.92s: we also had a couple other
471.64s: interesting strikes pop up so from a
475.44s: volume perspective you can see we had
476.96s: 254,000 volume against 58 so massive
480.08s: massive call skew and if I show you the
483.40s: volatility really fast to give you a
485.92s: sense of how this skew is lining up it's
488.64s: very standard where we are still seeing
492.32s: way more put V than call V so this is
496.16s: not forecasting this massive move yet
500.64s: you never know when it changes but it's
502.48s: not forecasting it yet if if you're
506.72s: curious what this can look like if you
508.80s: go back into the gme playlist that I
510.76s: have and you go back towards the
512.20s: beginning videos You'll see this is
514.32s: essentially inverted meaning this call
518.00s: side is higher in terms of vol than the
520.16s: put side and that is abnormal that's
522.72s: when the market is really pricing in
524.32s: some sort of upward
526.08s: expectation this right now is pricing in
528.44s: just a movement right because even the
530.48s: call side is still at 550% Vault on the
534.36s: super far out of the monies it's between
536.76s: three and four on kind of this more mid
539.12s: strike St range but the puts the far out
541.32s: of the money puts continue to Skyrocket
543.20s: and that's very very normal that's
545.56s: because the downside can come fast and
548.60s: hard so that's why this gets treated
551.80s: with a little bit more respect in terms
553.12s: of the Vault pricing now going out into
556.92s: 16 a for a quick comparison you can see
559.24s: it actually has this little bit of a bow
561.20s: right there that's interesting and
563.80s: that's a little bit less normal they're
565.76s: starting to see the 25s pop up out in a
570.56s: even more so than the 19 ju which is
573.44s: fascinating that inversion is not normal
576.28s: and I find that interesting as I've
579.36s: probably
580.44s: mentioned so what am I seeing from V
583.60s: from a volatility perspective I'm seeing
585.52s: some slight anomalies I'm seeing this
587.36s: front expiration not being heavily
590.92s: priced into the upside I'm seeing the
592.48s: putside continue to Skyrocket as per
594.52s: usual and I'm seeing a lot of instances
597.20s: of inversion which is kind of
599.48s: backwardation in certain instances for
601.44s: the same strikes but nothing mindblowing
605.60s: here now let's go back into open
608.44s: Interest really quick so that you can
610.08s: get a sense of what this all looks like
611.48s: we're up to 85,000 total calls against
615.12s: 480,000 puts so this Gap is still
620.16s: continuing to now contract again we saw
623.76s: an expansion a contraction between calls
626.20s: to puts and it is continuing to narrow
629.92s: not tremendously so but definitely
632.72s: seeing a lot of put transactions here of
635.16s: the puts that traded today 29% of them
638.24s: were at the bid or below so that tells
641.20s: us that people are selling puts and then
643.88s: we had 26% at the offer or above the
647.20s: vast majority of call volume today was
649.40s: at the offer or above so opening
652.12s: positions people buying options now I
654.84s: want to take one other look back at the
657.36s: volume but I want to limit it by this 19
659.04s: Ju cycle because there's an interesting
661.16s: trade Series right here this 19 July 24
665.68s: 27 halfs the volume is not anything too
669.80s: crazy compared to everything else you're
671.20s: seeing on this 27 a halfs had 7,800
674.68s: contracts traded so why am I calling
676.44s: that out specifically well it's because
679.84s: they had a little bit of a pretty
683.64s: serious block come through today so let
687.36s: me show you all get rid of these 30 so
689.48s: that you can see everything and take a
692.16s: look at these right here there was a
694.04s: trade that came
695.44s: through that was worth
698.60s: $327,000 it was for $ 3551 this was part
702.40s: of a series of orders that total
706.16s: 3551 now if you go through the rest of
709.08s: this chain there are a couple other 27
712.16s: and a halfs the reason why that matters
714.20s: is because while this platform might not
716.60s: be joining them together for us it looks
719.52s: like there's more of them so it's very
721.68s: likely that the person that put on those
723.36s: original 27 halfs probably put on some
725.96s: of these other ones so if we take a look
728.32s: here there was another 101 that came
730.76s: through that kind of was picked out
733.60s: through what six transactions is so
738.64s: somebody was building a little bit of a
740.16s: position there's a lot about the 27 and
743.08s: a Hales that I find so interesting a big
745.96s: part of that is one it's for this coming
748.28s: expiration cycle two those started
751.00s: coming through at essentially the open
754.48s: 0639 Pacific time is when that first
757.76s: trunch of 3551 came through and then at
763.64s: 0808 we saw another 99 of the 27 halfs
768.00s: come through then at 1224 we saw another
771.52s: 101 of the 27 and a halfes come through
774.92s: so this was something that was phased in
777.08s: throughout the day is what I can see so
779.72s: if we take a look at these 27 a halfs
782.24s: the oi is very small it was literally
785.36s: 2200 again I remind you guys this all
787.52s: the time notice how illiquid these are
789.68s: compared to these this is exactly why
792.32s: people tend to trade in the round number
796.04s: strikes you'll almost always find that
799.40s: the round number strikes are going to
801.36s: have more liquidity than others it's not
803.28s: always there's anomalies but the vast
805.88s: majority of instances that's what you'll
807.36s: see and it's for the sake of liquidity
809.44s: so the fact that these 27 a halfs came
812.56s: through at 7,800 contracts today with
815.36s: only 2200 open and we know a good
818.84s: majority of those probably at least four
821.32s: 5,000 of them are probably opens is very
823.96s: interesting now I see people speculating
826.24s: well somebody might be buying these to
827.92s: exercise them they could be and there's
830.56s: an incentive to do that from a
832.56s: settlement perspective with delivery
834.52s: from exercised options the problem with
837.36s: the theory is if requires essentially
841.44s: lighting this money on fire you're
844.52s: giving up all of the capital you paid
847.56s: why is that because this is all
850.56s: extrinsic value that's all extrinsic
853.24s: value so if you exercise that's gone
855.32s: there's no intrinsic value in those
856.80s: options so if this person put on
858.96s: something to the tune of 4,000 5,000
861.44s: contracts the 3500 contract itself was
867.00s: $327,000 so you're talking like a400
869.08s: $1,000 $500,000 position somewhere in
871.32s: that range depending on where they got
872.96s: their fills and they're they would just
874.72s: be lighting that on fire if the
876.64s: intention was to buy those to exercise
879.96s: them could still happen if the idea is
883.88s: you exercise them to cause demand the
887.32s: calculus could be well I'll make more on
890.40s: the rest of the position than the cost
892.76s: of
893.84s: the4 $500,000 I'm going to be
896.68s: eviscerating I have a hard time
898.40s: believing that because that's still a
900.48s: ton of money on something that's very
902.80s: speculative but it's not outside the
904.96s: realm of possibility I'm just providing
908.04s: the thought process behind it so that
910.20s: you can evaluate for yourselves what you
912.00s: think is most likely as I continue to
913.68s: remind you guys I am not here to spread
916.16s: hype or fud I am here to do my absolute
918.92s: best to do what I do as a Trader which
920.84s: is look at information process it is
922.80s: objectively as possible and then come to
925.88s: as best of a conclusion as I can based
928.28s: on the breath of evidence available to
929.92s: me so what does that look like somebody
932.24s: is choosing to transact at the 27 and
934.16s: halfs that's a very purposeful strike
935.88s: again most of us that do this at least
938.92s: full-time professionally whatever you
940.20s: want to call it these would be the
941.84s: go-tos because they're more liquid this
943.80s: is already giving up money by going to
945.88s: this as compared to something that's
947.16s: five wide you're going into something
949.08s: that's seven points wide for whatever
951.00s: reason weird from the start second thing
954.04s: building out the position throughout the
955.48s: day that shows conviction in whatever
957.80s: they're trying to do
959.44s: the overall Deltas here are 50 so if we
963.40s: start to see an accommodating move it
966.16s: could be with the idea that if we get a
970.08s: big strong move in our favor there is a
973.12s: pretty significant amount of OI building
975.28s: in these out of the monies if you'll
977.76s: notice right out of the money there's
979.92s: 6,600 at these 27s with 11,000 so more
983.20s: of those are being added the then 2200
985.96s: at the 27 and Hales with 7,800 being
988.64s: added so it literally could even be from
990.48s: the perspective of trying to build out a
993.80s: ramp so absolutely absolutely fun to
997.80s: watch the last thing I want to highlight
999.44s: from this quickly is we are seeing
1002.20s: different expirations being hit so in
1006.60s: 816 we saw a trade come through for
1009.67s: [Music]
1010.84s: $378,000 at the' 40s then 89 at the 29
1015.32s: we saw 343,000 come through then at the
1018.44s: 26 1018 232,000 come through so we're
1022.92s: starting to see some size coming into
1024.72s: this and I've been doing this every day
1026.52s: for a reason because it allows me to
1028.40s: track the progress incrementally and
1030.64s: share it with you guys and this is
1032.44s: relatively new we haven't seen
1034.64s: necessarily this level of severity as of
1037.60s: late so this is actually kind of
1039.56s: exciting to see these kind of trade
1041.68s: sizes starting to roll in and we will
1044.92s: see what that has in store for us so as
1047.88s: always if you have any question question
1049.08s: or anything you want me to take a look
1050.16s: at let me know throw it in the comments
1051.84s: be an outlier see you guys later
