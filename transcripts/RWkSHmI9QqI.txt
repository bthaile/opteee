836.00s:  you
838.00s:  these
868.00s:  entire energy sector right now that otherwise is very clearly sucking wind. So if we take a look at,
875.44s:  let's do the six month performance. If we take a look at the energy sector, this is within the S&P 500,
881.76s:  there are how many names in here? 22 and of those 22, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
892.56s:  half of them have a greater than 0, 6 month percent change performance. And you can take three of
900.56s:  them off so that we can get to the number that are at least up 10 percent plus. So the energy sector
908.64s:  right now is struggling, but there are very clear pockets of strength. And it's important to
915.52s:  continue identifying those pockets of strength. And we'll see again, if any of this budget
921.60s:  offload that we're finding and is going through doge might bleed into incentives that Trump could
928.24s:  put in place for incentivizing some of his broader initiatives that he has discussed so far,
934.48s:  some of which are obviously drilling more oil and things like that. So that's one of the key
940.08s:  themes that I definitely keyed into. And then I want to go back and take a look through this CPI
945.28s:  thing. Now, if you were called on the Sunday stream, and then I think I also reiterated it on
949.76s:  the Monday stream, the reason why CPI is really important is because, sorry, my dog was breathing
959.92s:  really weird. And it's because his head is like hanging off the bed. So his neck is at like a 40
968.88s:  degree angle. Clearly making breathing difficult. But the strength of the consumer right now is
979.04s:  super important. So when we see CPI starting to tick up, and then we also still have a couple other
986.88s:  metrics that were me, I assume you might be too, but that we are talking about are not just
997.84s:  you're over here CPI, but here. So you can see retail sales. And I don't know why there's
1006.96s:  German stuff in here. There shouldn't be German stuff. I was like, why am I looking at
1015.28s:  stuff from Germany? I mean, I like our German friends, but I don't really care about their markets
1022.40s:  right now, to be honest with you. So core CPI and then tomorrow, we'll have month over month,
1030.48s:  or PPI and PPI were also going to have retail sales. So retail sales tomorrow will be the next big
1037.36s:  look we have at seeing at least how the consumer is doing and what this might mean for the market. And
1044.64s:  this all goes back. I was going to say Harkins back because I've heard that word before,
1050.16s:  but then I stopped myself because I actually don't know what Harkins means, but I wanted to say it
1055.44s:  because it sounds fun. I think it makes sense to say it, but it's just a fun sounding word. This Harkins
1062.56s:  back to the conversation from yesterday and the day before, which is the market clearly is in a bit
1070.88s:  of a holding pattern. So let me move this back to the market overview. And if we take a look at the
1076.40s:  market performance over the last three days, it's essentially unchanged. And I think a lot of this
1083.52s:  is because the market right now is trying to figure out what direction we break and if so how strong
1089.84s:  and as I will continue beating the strum, I do think the pot odds still favor a downside move.
1097.84s:  Now, when I say that, when I say pot odds in this perspective, it's in terms of the risk we take.
1103.44s:  So if I were to give straight probabilistic assessment, I would have to continue to gauge
1110.32s:  and prioritize probabilistic move to the upside simply because of drift. But in the near term,
1118.56s:  and the way that the market is currently setting up to me, it feels like the better return on risk
1125.04s:  potential play here is actually to the downside. So we talked about handing or we talked about
1132.80s:  building a couple bearish style trades. We actually looked at some of them yesterday. And I added a
1139.28s:  few to the book in general because I do think again, just from a probabilistic standpoint,
1146.56s:  I'm still net positive deltas and I still will continue to be that until there's a broad regime
1151.76s:  change, which we're not in yet, in my opinion. There's still a little time for that. But I think right
1159.44s:  now with the market generally stalling out, this also goes back to when I gave you guys the last
1163.92s:  update on the covered strangle allocations. Most of the allocations there are pretty light on the
1170.80s:  equity side of things. Most of them are 20% and less of the total current cash utilized. And they're
1176.40s:  much heavier on the cash secured put side. And it's because cash secured puts right now we're
1181.20s:  still making money. I actually dropped this in the discord earlier today because it's a fun case
1185.92s:  study where if we take a look at T triple cues and I forgot the position. I actually think I might
1192.48s:  have managed it today. I'll tell you what the position was so that you guys can take a crack
1196.80s:  at the case study. So what I had asked was I said that I'm short the 21 Feb. Let's get rid of the
1205.92s:  let's go to 21 Feb. I was saying that I'm short the 21 Feb 78 puts. And today the market was down
1219.04s:  but the puts were profitable meaning the puts actually contracted in value. So typically when the
1224.72s:  market goes down, we expect puts to go up in value. So there is a really key series of changes that
1234.56s:  happen that led to the puts actually being profitable on the day, even though that the market opened
1239.84s:  down. And I gave a brief overview in the discord, but it comes down to a couple key factors. Now
1247.36s:  there were a couple guesses. I know people were in there talking about things like Delta decay.
1255.04s:  And Delta decay is part of it, but that's actually not one of the primary drivers that you saw
1261.36s:  here. And that's obviously talking about like charm. And the third order, second and third order
1266.88s:  Greeks, some of them, I think people were thrown around like Van Eyes on there, which is good that
1270.80s:  we're talking about the third order Greeks. But we can simplify because remember the third order
1275.52s:  Greeks, they just help us understand what's happening, right? That's the way that we measure things.
1280.56s:  And we can see even on the day, the Delta for these puts is now 13 cents. So we can assume that when
1290.00s:  the market opened earlier today in T triple Q's and the market was down at 82, which is essentially
1296.16s:  $3 less than where we are now. So we can do the surrogate strike game. We can essentially pretend
1304.16s:  that our 78s were actually looking like similar to the 81s. So they ended up looking much
1312.16s:  better throughout the day because of the rally. So what happened here? Well, we can see that
1317.20s:  we would have lost on a Delta perspective because the directional move would have gone against us.
1322.24s:  We can see gamma would have been actually ramping against us. But take a look at theta and Vega.
1331.52s:  Right? So theta took out 10 cents day over day and it would have been more if we were closer to
1337.60s:  at the money earlier today. And then Vega. So today was a really interesting example of where the
1344.88s:  market actually had a bit of a down tick. But the corresponding volatility relative to the cycle
1352.24s:  that we're in did not have that drastic of a corresponding volatility uptick. So let me show you
1359.68s:  this. What I'm going to do is add another volatility line. I typically keep them off for you guys
1365.36s:  just because the way that I look at this in case you were ever wondering what it actually looks
1370.08s:  like for me. It's like this, which is I normally don't do this because I know that it's like
1377.76s:  insanely overwhelming to the standard looker. But like this. So it's a very noisy chart. But what I
1388.16s:  can do is I can isolate volatility behavior for different time frames. So if I close this off for
1394.88s:  now and we start seeing how volatility behaved for various time frames, you'll notice that it
1401.92s:  didn't behave the same on the day. So to make this easier to see, let's move this into like a three
1407.44s:  month daily. Let's go even further. We'll do like a 30 day that's going to flatten it out too much.
1413.76s:  I'm trying to find like a really effective view for you guys that makes it easier to see.
1419.52s:  I think this one's probably the best, the three month daily. And you can see that even just
1426.96s:  eyeballing the ends of these yellow lines here, which is implied volatility. We can see that some of
1432.64s:  them are slightly upward sloping. And we can see some of them are slightly downward sloping.
1439.12s:  So to make this a little cleaner so that it's not quite as noisy for you, what I normally show you
1445.92s:  here is literally just 30 day vol. And then I show you the VRP, which simplifies the plot quite a
1455.28s:  lot for a one day and then normally a seven day period. So there would be two VRP lines in here.
1463.84s:  So anyways, back to what I want to show you, which is the seven day vol. If I show you seven day vol.
1470.40s:  And make sure that there's no others. Oh, yeah, we want 365 out of here. Notice what happened to
1478.88s:  seven day vol. That's this one. What happened to seven day vol day over day, 11th and 12th?
1488.32s:  Seven day vol contracted. Seven day vol contracted nearly a point. So even though we saw an expansion
1499.20s:  in 30 day vol, we saw a contraction in seven day vol. Now that contraction in seven day vol
1509.28s:  can be I can be visualized in a few different ways. So what I'll do to try to make it a little
1516.64s:  easier. I don't know how how difficult that is for you guys to see. I'm trying to make it so it's
1523.12s:  the difference between these is a little more pronounced between seven and 30 day vol. So I'm making
1528.24s:  this one much darker 30 day vol versus seven. Let me know if that helps. Meaning seven day vol is
1535.52s:  here. And you can see seven day vol actually contracted on the day. And now we can use the Greeks
1541.84s:  to see why would seven day vol have contracted relative to 30 day vol. If we're in this bigger
1550.80s:  down move. And again, it was an up move on the day. So I'm talking earlier in the day. Okay,
1556.24s:  cool. Thank you, Tommy wanted to make sure that I wasn't like just fucking talking about something.
1559.52s:  You guys are like, what the hell is this guy on about the end of the day? Obviously, it was a big rally.
1563.68s:  So all of this conversation is rooted towards the beginning half of where we gaped down to 82
1570.80s:  and then slowly started rallying. So there's a specific Greek that explains this to us. And do
1578.88s:  you know what that Greek is? And then we're at 520. So then I will pivot us after this who are skilled
1585.52s:  development sessions. But I'm curious if you guys know the Greek. Let me grab. I'll give you the
1590.40s:  answer too. It'll take you a second to find it anyways. So you could poke through there. I'm going
1596.56s:  to open the door for Thor.
1597.44s:  What do you guys see? So right now we should be trying to understand the rate of change of
1616.56s:  volatility, not from Vega, which is just from a raw move in volatility. That's part of it.
1625.60s:  But there's another Greek that helps us understand essentially Vega decay, which is Veda.
1636.16s:  Kind of like Darth Veda. Darth Vader Veda. Close enough. Darth Veda. So Darth Veda is effectively your
1648.16s:  volatility, your Vega decay. So Veda tells us rate of change per one rate of change in premium
1660.08s:  for 1% move in IV. Veda tells us Vega rate of change when there's a move in VAL and passage of time,
1670.80s:  which is what happened here. And that's exactly why you see what you see here. Now a couple other
1677.36s:  answers that I saw, let me see that were pretty close. One of them was charm. And again,
1685.20s:  this this actually wasn't charm. So for those that don't know charm is just delta decay.
1690.48s:  And again, it's essentially the change in delta from the passage of time. And it's not charm
1699.12s:  that led to this. And Vanna is close to it. Vanna is close to it. But it's not exactly it either.
1710.96s:  The more direct impact is from Veda. And again, those are really just different ways that helps us
1719.44s:  measure it. I actually think, let me take a look real quick. I think I might have built a
1728.72s:  reference for you guys. Where would I have put it? Give me one sec.
1737.12s:  So I think it might be useful.
1742.24s:  Is it in this?
1747.92s:  Sort by date.
1750.00s:  No.
1757.92s:  Damn it. Let me see if I can find it really quick. Because I literally just built this not that long ago.
1765.60s:  And what I was building was like a really, really basic chart that helps you visualize
1777.36s:  the various Greeks and their impact on this is not it.
1791.52s:  I will look for it. And then once I find it, I'll put it in the discord. Oh, it might have been,
1797.76s:  hold on, it might be on the phone. I think that might have been what happened. I think it might be
1802.64s:  in here. Aha. Found it. So what I'll do is I will drop this in the discord for you guys.
1812.96s:  But essentially what I did is I made like a really, really simple table that allows you to understand
1818.64s:  the difference in all of the different Greeks and what they measure. The one that I use in the
1825.68s:  screenshot that I showed you, it's kind of by design. It's supposed to be a little more noisy.
1831.84s:  But the whole point of it is to be more specific, meaning, you know, include the formulas
1837.60s:  and the actual movement of things. Whereas this one that I'm going to upload right now is just
1843.60s:  like a word picture that helps you understand. So this is Greeks overview. So I'm uploading that
1854.08s:  to Google Drive and then I'll be able to share that with you guys.
1861.84s:  Let me see if you guys have any questions on that.
1867.12s:  Haters says the seven day volvertured evolved put option with seven days left. Yes.
1873.76s:  Not to the vol of the put option though. Seven day, seven day vol just
1879.04s:  refers to implied volatility for a seven day time frame. We can segment implied volatility.
1885.12s:  When you look at the implied volatility for a stock, this is annualized. So we can essentially
1891.04s:  use the square root of time to determine for a bunch of different time frames. What we think
1898.56s:  volatility might be either as a raw number as an expected move. So when I'm talking about the
1904.00s:  different period of volatility, it's literally looking at this.
1911.76s:  This difference in volatility that you see here. I forgot I can draw on this.
1916.72s:  And while we're doing a volatility recap since we're here already,
1923.84s:  what is this called? This over here. The fact that 14 Feb is 62.6% vol. And the fact that
1935.36s:  14 Feb and then 21 March is 62.1% and then let's do 15 Jan.
1951.36s:  27. This is 55.1% vol.
1956.64s:  Term structure. So this shows us the volatility relative to different periods in time.
1970.40s:  This is your term structure. Now, James, who's speculating on contango versus backwardation,
1980.08s:  contango or backwardation is just the classification of term structure.
1985.12s:  So contango is what we tend to see markets in. This is actually in backwardation right here.
1990.88s:  This is a great example of backwardation.
1998.08s:  So contango is the propensity for further out volatility to be higher than near term volatility,
2006.32s:  which is lower. So this would be DTE. This would be zero. This would be N plus one. I guess T plus
2016.72s:  one. T plus one dot dot dot. So generally speaking, this is the configuration you'll have.
2028.00s:  The further out in time you go, the more volatility you expect to see over that time frame.
2034.40s:  This is contango. Backwardation is actually what this is configured as right now, where this 14
2040.24s:  Feb expiry is 62.6. And this is actually 55.1 backwards. Backwardation.
2048.24s:  Tweet. All right, we are at 530. I don't want to chew up too much time on volatility. We actually
2054.64s:  just did a session on this. And I want to make sure that we have enough time to do our case study.
2059.68s:  But honestly, great questions. As you know, always happy to talk about volatility.
2063.36s:  Volatility is super, super important.
2067.84s:  Re says isn't contango backwardation using reference of interest rates? Not really.
2072.72s:  You can, but that's it's more in reference to the yield curve. So if you're talking about interest
2079.44s:  rates, specifically the yield curve than yes. But contango and backwardation. And again,
2085.12s:  that's essentially the same thing that you see here. Right. So for yield curve,
2090.80s:  yeah. So Reese, that's the way to frame what you're asking now is in reference to a yield curve.
2097.36s:  And this is a volatility curve. The way to think about these different curves is it just looks at
2103.68s:  a relative level at different points in time. That's how we create a curve. So if we take a look at,
2113.60s:  if I turn this into a time series, which would be easier for you to see like this.
2120.00s:  And then this would be T zero. And then again, this would be T plus one dot dot dot, meaning
2126.32s:  just further out in time. But to make this easier, we'll just do T zero. This will be seven day.
2133.12s:  This will be T plus 30, T plus 90. So these are different explorations. You can sub in
2142.64s:  anything for these. This can be the sofa rate. This can be a two year note. This can be 10 years.
2152.88s:  This can be 30 years. So then if we have a 30 year, I actually have no idea what they're trading
2159.68s:  for right now to be completely honest. Let's see. Where is it?
2172.72s:  So the 30 years at 4.828. So put that here. 4.828. And then we'll just do one more of them.
2195.84s:  Because I think you guys get the example at this point. 10 year 4.6, 1 year 4.3,
2206.24s:  4.6. And then this is I think a 1 year actually, which is 4.3.
2213.84s:  So the curve here looks like this.
2222.08s:  Just like that. And for those that have checked out the box spread video,
2229.12s:  I literally show you exactly how to make a yield curve. And I'll give you what it actually is.
2238.96s:  Because the tool that I built really, it's super simple to use. All we do is copy all of this stuff
2247.20s:  in to my sheet. It auto updates the curve. And then I'll show you what the curve is right now.
2264.80s:  Where to go?
2266.40s:  I'm going to paste it in here.
2269.44s:  Aha. Great success.
2274.48s:  This is the curve right now, the yield curve. So notice the name of this. This is from a sheet
2281.04s:  that I made. And again, those that are in the the proside, you guys have this template.
2288.56s:  So what this is is it shows us the relative yield for all these different time frames.
2294.88s:  So then we can visualize where things might be relatively expensive,
2300.32s:  and I 180 days for sure. And then we can see where they're relatively cheap, essentially one year.
2307.44s:  That's relatively cheap way too cheap. And again, whether it's the yield curve that we're talking
2313.52s:  about, these are just different words. Yield curve. This can be volatility curve. You can have
2323.52s:  gamma curves, theta curves, etc. And when we're talking about curves in this context,
2334.88s:  what we're talking about is a time series plot. And then a relative value. That's all.
2343.04s:  So then when I'm showing you tools like this, this is a delta and DTE curve.
2355.52s:  This is a theta decay curve. This is a Vega curve. This is a gamma curve.
2361.36s:  So the context of curve as we're talking about it here is simply a time series plot of the input
2369.92s:  value, whatever it is that we're talking about. And I think that's the, that's the gist.
2377.36s:  Does that all make sense?
2382.88s:  You can put a ton of stuff on a curve. And then again, contango versus backwardation just
2388.80s:  refers to the structure, what we're observing on the curve.
2392.96s:  I don't know if silence is good, meaning you guys are all locked on. Okay, cool. Thank you,
2403.28s:  Tommy. Tommy, you're the man. Because after I finished explaining some of this stuff, sometimes I
2407.84s:  genuinely am like, I have no idea if that Helter did not help at all. So thank you, Tommy. Very
2413.84s:  useful feedback from me. Okay, now we got some work to do. The case study, which is what are we
2423.28s:  at? We're at 4020. And this, oh, this isn't the case study that I'll be tomorrow. Skiz, skills dev,
2431.44s:  creating an option trade exit, strategy. Beautiful. Let me open up the door for Thor.
2444.00s:  We have a ritual now where he runs out for his dinner and then he runs back in immediately,
2458.16s:  post dinner and gets back in his heated blanket. It's actually fucking hilarious. So the session for
2464.24s:  today for the skill development is about creating an exit strategy for options trades. And the reason
2477.12s:  why I'm talking about this is because for most people, we know that this is a purely random
2483.36s:  effect. This is something that we kind of just try to figure out as we go. As promised, here's a
2492.24s:  video about risk management with respect to this broader conversation that we're going to have.
2498.88s:  And here's, here's where things start to become more important. So let's take a look at this.
2506.96s:  We're Joe McFatguy, which is obviously absolutely epic name. Joe McFatguy. They have a $200
2515.52s:  loss on their calls. Do they hold or do they sell? What's the answer to this? Now the easy answer to
2523.68s:  this is, well, it depends. Right? Because it obviously does. It depends on the strategy. It depends
2530.24s:  on what their idea was. It depends on a lot of stuff. So the very first step when we're considering
2540.00s:  in exit strategy is very simple. There are going to be core concepts. These core concepts are going
2558.96s:  to apply to literally everything. And then there's going to be strategy specific.
2573.44s:  And these strategy specific concepts, as you probably can guess, they're relative to the actual
2580.80s:  strategy. Let me grab the chat here. I want to be able to hang out with you guys. Reese says,
2588.24s:  are they naked or covered? These are, well, you answer it based on what you can see in this,
2594.40s:  because you can answer that for yourself for the contracts here.
2603.28s:  So your terminal learning objective for the session today, what you should walk away with,
2610.64s:  is an understanding of how to create an effective process for determining exit points in a strategy.
2622.56s:  That's your terminal learning objective. And then for those that are in the pro-patrion,
2627.84s:  tomorrow, when we will do our case study, we're actually going to use some of your strategies
2635.12s:  to figure out what's optimal for your strategy and how we can build it in a natural practical sense.
2642.96s:  So here, this homey bought 10 of these calls. He bought 10 for $6.5,
2657.36s:  bought them on the 6th of Feb, and now they're currently trading at 315.
2666.40s:  So this represents a, essentially, 50% decline. I actually don't know what they're talking about
2675.44s:  with $200 calls lost. This is way more than that.
2680.40s:  Okay. Well, they're also very confused about the relative size of their own risk,
2688.00s:  which is actually kind of fucking crazy. So anyways, let's take a look. I want to talk about,
2696.96s:  and I want to add some common misconceptions that we're going to talk about.
2702.96s:  And as always, with the common misconceptions, the goal is at the end of the video,
2711.20s:  you should have the correct answer for all of these. So let's take a look. Misconceptions.
2722.32s:  One of them is never, never.
2733.68s:  Risk more than
2736.96s:  X percent. The second one is always
2749.84s:  lock-in profit.
2756.00s:  Third is green.
2763.52s:  Is always,
2768.72s:  I don't know why I got all fucked up. Always better
2776.80s:  than red, which is both should anyways, because red is my favorite color.
2781.44s:  And then the last one
2789.44s:  is take profits
2796.40s:  at X percent.
2801.12s:  Okay. So from a high level, have you all heard of at least one of these?
2808.96s:  Or did all of these things that I throw up here, does this all sound kind of crazy?
2816.24s:  Or does this generally make sense? Meaning this is at least something you might have heard
2822.08s:  at some point. Any question?
2830.88s:  Okay. Resets heard them, but not from you. Oh, definitely. I'm glad you haven't heard them
2834.48s:  from me, because I won't say stupid shit like this. This doesn't make sense.
2839.44s:  And 54 says you have heard it. They swags this three quarters. Okay. Great.
2843.12s:  So these are things that you've heard to varying degrees before. These are things that typically
2847.76s:  sound smart. And I'm going to show you, not going to tell you directly, but I'm going to show
2855.20s:  you why literally all of these are misconceptions. So now let's go back up and let's get back
2861.44s:  into the core concepts for an exit strategy. So the very basis of an exit strategy starts from
2870.96s:  the most basic point. What is the most basic point? If we're thinking about an exit point
2880.00s:  that always makes sense, regardless of the strategy you have on, what could that be?
2888.16s:  Any guesses?
2891.12s:  Res says when do you cut losses?
2894.48s:  Nope, that's not it. Because remember, exit strategy is not just for losing trades.
2898.88s:  Exit strategy is also for winning trades. So we can talk about winning trades and losing
2903.44s:  trades separately for sure. But your scenario, Res, of when do you cut losses is important.
2918.24s:  I want you to zoom up one click from that. When would we make when would we cut a loss?
2931.20s:  Res says just thought, risking the main thing we can control. It's a great guess. You're not wrong,
2935.36s:  by the way. You're not wrong at all. I just want to zoom you up one more level. Because when we
2939.52s:  get into the actual point where we cut losses, that's actually where we become more strategy specific.
2947.60s:  Okay, Impala is heard of all four. Great. This is good. So then by the end of this,
2951.44s:  you guys should have a pretty good sense of why these are all nonsense.
2957.76s:  So, Res, zoom your answer up one level. You're saying when to cut losses,
2965.20s:  why would we cut losses?
2967.68s:  Pop-a-proper is very close.
2977.12s:  Ah, there you go. Ryan's got it. Nice job, Ryan. So Ryan is saying when the thesis
2986.24s:  is proven or disproven. This is literally the root of every single trade that goes on
3004.24s:  on when we should exit the trade or begin looking to exit at the trade.
3010.16s:  Is when our idea is either validated or invalidated that has nothing to do with an arbitrary
3021.12s:  percent move in the underlying, it has everything to do with what your thesis is.
3028.56s:  Because let's say for example,
3030.64s:  let me hide all that stuff. Let's say for example that you're in Nvidia.
3042.32s:  And let's say that you're an investor and your vision in Nvidia is that in a one year time
3052.56s:  horizon, it'll be worth more than it is right now. But let's say you also have a rule in place
3058.88s:  in your portfolio because you heard that this was smart, that at any point the ticker has a 10%
3066.72s:  drawdown from wherever, let's just pick a level, 10% drawdown that you should get out.
3074.00s:  Well, what would have happened here? In something like Nvidia, when it was 136 up here,
3080.24s:  and traded down at 91, guess what would have happened? You would have gotten out.
3085.28s:  But even if we look at the movement from here to here, it's been in profit since for sure.
3094.64s:  So the point is if you pick an arbitrary number, it might not align with the actual idea.
3106.72s:  The idea in this case is an investment, a longer term idea.
3114.16s:  So if we go back now to this and we add our second core concept,
3120.64s:  it's that exit must fit thesis. The exit has to fit the thesis.
3142.72s:  If you use an arbitrary exit that doesn't align with your thesis, you are at a natural crossroads
3151.60s:  that don't make sense. Okay, so now let's talk about some strategy specific concepts.
3160.08s:  This has everything to do with expected return.
3172.00s:  The expected return of the strategy is what will guide where our exits should be.
3187.04s:  So now let's talk about the two elements of an exit strategy.
3200.64s:  The first one has to be what we talked about up here. So predefined
3216.72s:  targets. This can be P and L. This can be stock. Again, this will be based on the strategy.
3234.40s:  The second element of an exit strategy is the method.
3243.68s:  This is do we use a mental stop?
3249.36s:  Do we scale? Do we have a resting stop?
3255.44s:  These are the two primary elements of an exit strategy. The first thing is you need to define it.
3265.12s:  And then the second thing is you have to determine the corresponding method that makes the most sense.
3272.32s:  So I've given you examples before about making sure that the exit strategy itself
3284.40s:  fits the opportunity. And then for the strategy specific side of things that the expected return
3292.00s:  is still positively expected. So I'm going to clear all this off. I don't want to get rid of the
3299.20s:  misconceptions though. So I'm going to take a screenshot of these.
3313.68s:  Here.
3318.96s:  And now I can delete them.
3322.56s:  So now let's hypothesize a little bit. Let's say that what's one of those rules that you've heard?
3335.60s:  Do you have you guys heard specific percentages? Like always take your profits at blank
3341.68s:  or never risk blank. Have you guys heard of any of those kinds of things?
3349.60s:  I'm specifically asking like specific percentages or numbers that you've heard relative to those.
3357.76s:  50% max profit. Okay.
3359.68s:  Now that's a tasty trade artifact, which obviously I'm familiar with. And this is on short
3375.12s:  options if we've sold something. So the idea here is 50% max profit.
3381.68s:  So to illustrate this one, I'm actually going to grab a website and we're going to take a look together.
3401.84s:  Let's do.
3402.96s:  This is all good. Let's do two of these.
3414.72s:  I'm running a test really quick.
3420.16s:  Paul says does 50% apply to all DTE? Well, it's based on the broader tasty trade methodology,
3426.08s:  which they're going to sell typically at 45 DTE and then it'll be 50% or closest to 20 or 21 days,
3433.36s:  I think. But the reality is that that actually is not the correct answer. That's just a simplified
3440.32s:  answer. That answer is designed to make it easier for you to synthesize and figure out,
3448.16s:  you know, like what you should do and what you shouldn't do. But it's not the correct answer.
3452.80s:  And I'll give you an exact example of why this is. So let's take a look on short term strategies.
3465.20s:  So let's take a look on why Day Swag is completely wrong on his idea. So what I'm looking at
3474.08s:  is trading zero DTE options in SPX. And I want to show you two different scenarios.
3495.52s:  So for these two different scenarios,
3499.68s:  you can see this one has a higher win rate. This one up here is managing at 50% max.
3511.60s:  You can see the actual return is much better. This is no exit to X-PRI.
3530.16s:  So the performance goes from a 2.4%
3534.80s:  Kagger to a 11.8% Kagger. Let me move my head out of the way.
3548.32s:  There.
3548.64s:  So this is an example where just defaulting to 50% max profit literally doesn't make any sense.
3564.96s:  And it's way more nuanced than that.
3566.96s:  So the art of developing the actual exit plan comes down to understanding the strategy that you're
3580.72s:  using. And then what periods functionally make sense to get out at. And the way that we figure
3589.60s:  that out is by actually looking at the strategy. If you don't look at the strategy, you will not know.
3595.84s:  There's no way for you to know. So if we take a look at the misconceptions, the first one is take
3604.40s:  profits at X percent. Well, we know this isn't true. The reason why we know it's not true to set a
3610.88s:  fixed take profit at blank percent is because it's going to be highly relative to the strategy.
3618.32s:  So as always, we can display this. We can illustrate this with an example. And it'll be done through
3626.88s:  the expected return formula. So we have an average win.
3636.64s:  We have a win rate. We have an average loss. We have a loss rate.
3648.32s:  So let's take a look at a couple simple scenarios. Let's say our average win is one
3664.72s:  Hyundai. One Hyundai dollar. And let's say our win rate is 90%. Let's say our average loss is 2000.
3680.56s:  Then loss rate 10%. The expected return here, pretty simple formula, average win times win rate
3699.76s:  plus average loss times loss rate. You have a negatively expected strategy. Even though you are winning a
3712.56s:  shit ton of times, you are winning 90% of your trades. 10% of your trades are wiping you out.
3720.16s:  And this goes even further than that. So let's take a look at one other thing. Let me see. This is okay.
3732.64s:  Give me one sec. I want to grab another example. I just have to find it for you.
3749.36s:  I did like a series of examples with this. I can't find it.
3767.60s:  Annoying. Well, anyways, let me continue with a little bit more of the example. And then
3772.80s:  I want to give you a wave forward. And then for those that are in the pro livestream tomorrow,
3778.72s:  this is where we're actually going to lift this and use this to create the actual steps for the case
3785.20s:  study. So the key takeaway here is that you cannot apply a random approach. The approach has to
3797.92s:  be based on the strategy because now let's take a look at a couple different scenarios. Let's say
3805.04s:  that you have a system. We'll do it down here. Let's say that you have a system that has 10
3812.56s:  winning trades and two losing trades. Actually, we'll do eight and two to keep it at 10.
3819.84s:  Let's do the same thing here. Let's see what the numbers do. Let's just have a little fun and
3830.88s:  tinker a little bit. I know that it might be weird that this is the idea of fun, but this is
3837.68s:  and it is fun. Let's have these inputs instead. What I'm going to do
3849.76s:  is have number of wins, number of losses, and then I'm going to calculate this.
3864.32s:  So this will be this divided by this plus this.
3879.36s:  And then I'm going to calculate this is this divided by this plus this.
3887.84s:  The reason I'm doing it via formulas so that we can play around a little bit because
3891.84s:  what do you notice? What just happened in these two different systems? They represent literally the
3900.32s:  same thing. But if we have these slight changes in a system where the win rate is 90%,
3913.20s:  the loss rate is 10% 9 and 1. We come to our expected return of negative 110. So then as we
3923.28s:  start blowing up these samples a little bit, you'll see provided that we stay exactly in the same
3930.24s:  sample size, the expected return will still show obviously the same rate. But the difference is
3937.92s:  that it very rarely is going to show the same exact expected return as the sample size changes
3945.52s:  because slight differences are going to enter into the system. So now there's a really,
3952.72s:  really important way we need to be able to identify one of the most important traits with respect
3961.28s:  to a strategy. I'm actually going to build a standalone video on it. The thing I'm going to show
3967.44s:  you all is how you can figure out the number of trades you need to determine once you have a set
3976.56s:  confidence interval. So I use like a 95% confidence interval in the number of trades required so that
3982.72s:  you know that the strategy that you're using again with the 95% confidence interval is actually
3988.16s:  representative of the expected return because what we don't know in this strategy here or this
3994.64s:  strategy here is have we put on enough trades to know that this expected return is accurate or not.
4003.60s:  Does this actually reflect the performance of the strategy and the reality is we don't know
4012.00s:  because there's a simple way to calculate that which that will be a time, a lesson for another time
4020.16s:  since we are pretty much at time here. So let's finish out these misconceptions.
4027.60s:  The never risk more than x% on an individual trade. This loses all nuance in a strategy.
4037.76s:  So let's say that in this case we're using a $100,000 portfolio.
4044.96s:  And what are some of the common numbers that you that you're told to never risk more than
4052.48s:  anybody have one that comes to the top of your mind?
4060.16s:  Never risk more than 1% recess. Great. So 1% risk. We can again do the math. Obviously you can just
4071.12s:  do the mental math here, but so on a 1% max loss, let's see what happens here.
4082.72s:  Let's see that if our average loss is negative 1100.
4091.12s:  Interesting. So in this sample so far we see that if we risk more than 1% this looks to hold.
4101.12s:  Right. Well, what happens if our average win isn't actually $100? What happens if our average
4107.84s:  win is $150?
4113.60s:  Serious. Now it's fine.
4117.92s:  So the point that I'm making is that these blank rules of never risk more than
4124.08s:  blank percent are it's just ignorant because it doesn't take into account the nuance of a strategy.
4132.16s:  In this strategy, you win 90% of the time at $150. You lose 10% the time at $1100 which exceeds
4140.48s:  the maximum allowable risk. You make money. This is not bad. This is completely okay.
4148.48s:  So when we think about never risk more than blank percent, that comes down to a personal
4158.96s:  decision based on your risk tolerance. I can give you examples of some of my friends that are
4166.00s:  traders that trade actually very concentrated portfolio of three tickers and their portfolio will
4172.00s:  go through 30 40% drawdowns. They still make good money because when the trades come online,
4180.96s:  they make a lot of money. But that's based on the performance of their broader system.
4187.36s:  Right. So when we look at this here and this here, the only time to set some sort of risk
4199.20s:  percent protocol is based on yourself, what you prefer to risk. That's it. Nothing else.
4207.44s:  So this next idea of always lock in a profit. The reason why this makes, again, no sense is because
4220.08s:  if we overemphasize the idea of green being better than red or locking in a profit, what happens?
4227.36s:  Our average wind size is going to go down. And it's because a lot of trades will have periods
4235.44s:  where they're losing money before they make money again. So then if you have a trade that's
4240.16s:  showing a $10 gain and you want to never let anything go from profit to loss so then you take it
4246.16s:  off when it goes to zero. You have a $0 gain once you include fees. Obviously you lost a little bit
4251.36s:  of money, but then that trade started to roll back up and actually make money. It doesn't make
4258.08s:  sense. And if you're doing something like selling premium, this essentially will never,
4264.64s:  this will never make sense because short options tend to take a bumpy path to profitability.
4272.48s:  Take some time for them. So it's just another example on why that in a broad sense
4280.32s:  doesn't really apply holistically. It's just not good advice. And the idea of green being
4289.12s:  always better than red is pure foolishness because it focuses on the outcome of individual trades
4299.12s:  and it does not emphasize the overall profitability of the system, which is extremely important.
4309.12s:  The overall profitability of the system is way more important than if we're green or red
4314.32s:  on an individual opportunity. And that's just the reality. So
4322.08s:  any questions on what we talked about here with respect to creating an X-Strategy for an
4330.72s:  option straight. The way we create an X-Strategy is very simple. We first design a couple core
4337.68s:  concepts that apply to literally everything we do. Then we set up a rules-based approach where
4345.20s:  we might have overarching risk management protocols for the entire portfolio,
4350.00s:  but each individual strategy needs to have its own defined levels based on what the strategy is.
4358.00s:  If you're trading something like a zero DTE strategy that has a ton of trades,
4365.04s:  the expected return formula for that is going to look a lot differently than if you're trading
4370.24s:  something on a quarterly basis. So it has to be made relative to the strategy. It cannot be
4377.84s:  these just blank sweep rules. They don't mean anything. There are things that sound smart that
4383.68s:  are not smart. They're misleading. Joseph says, one case most ideal and options on a 100,000
4393.52s:  account. Again, that's kind of going off what I was just talking about. It's not ideal.
4400.56s:  What is ideal? Technically, what's ideal can be determined by Kelly Criterion,
4406.08s:  but realistically, what's ideal is highly relative to the strategy. So if we're trading strategies
4416.64s:  that are more speculative in nature, then maybe not risking more than one, two, three percent
4425.44s:  on an individual trade can make sense. It could make complete sense. Or if you're trading a strategy
4432.80s:  that's typically more profitable in the long run, then one percent might be literally way too tight.
4440.64s:  Because if you're going to size things off of that, then you're going to either have to put on a
4446.16s:  ton of different things in order to make money. Or you're going to have to find different names to
4456.16s:  put on that are not correlated because otherwise you end up putting on the same total risk if you
4461.92s:  have to find a bunch of trades so that you're not risking more than one percent in any one trade.
4466.96s:  So this also doesn't account for any sort of correlation risk. So the idea of one percent in,
4475.04s:  again, just like a blanket rule, loses way too much nuance.
4482.40s:  Yeah. Paulus says, the Stagwit Kelly criteria is that you really don't know the P. Well,
4486.32s:  you can know the probability. You certainly can. Again, you can look at your historic probability for
4491.28s:  a strategy. You can either hypothesize what it is. And the thing to remember about the Kelly
4505.52s:  Criterion and for people that talk bad about it, that they don't understand it is that the Kelly
4512.24s:  Criterion does exactly what you want, which is optimized for growth. So if you have something that
4519.44s:  optimizes for growth, what is that tell you? Well, it's going to throw risk management into the
4523.92s:  wind, meaning it's going to purely optimize for growth. So with Kelly Criterion, what a lot of
4530.32s:  people do in a practical sense is we use what's called a fractional Kelly sizing. So you can take
4537.28s:  any fraction of the total Kelly sizing to fit within your risk tolerance. So some people do half
4545.60s:  Kelly. Some people do quarter Kelly. Whatever that number is, it gives you some like a general
4550.56s:  starting point. But the whole point of the Kelly Criterion is to optimize for growth. And in the
4555.52s:  pursuit of optimizing for growth, it's absolutely going to push you to some uncomfortable levels.
4559.76s:  Now, to solve for the probability component, you can either use the probability of options
4565.92s:  when you're entering the trade or more appropriately, you can use the probability based on
4572.32s:  drum roll, your fucking trade log. And on your historic interactions with that strategy that you've
4578.08s:  carefully logged. Policies have you used Kelly for formula for multiple outcomes, of course.
4585.28s:  So what you're referring to is the difference between discrete and industry Kelly.
4590.00s:  If you use standard Kelly formula in options markets, it makes literally no sense. Because there's
4596.00s:  a continuum, you need to use continuous Kelly. If you use discrete Kelly, that's based on binary
4601.84s:  outcomes that's using the exact wrong tool for the wrong job. That's good for binary outcome
4609.36s:  propositions. The only way to use Kelly in trading is through a continuous variation of Kelly.
4615.60s:  If you don't use continuous Kelly, then again, it's just not really
4622.00s:  not really doing you any good. You're applying a tool that's meant for another kind of system.
4627.60s:  So yeah. But I mean, for me, I don't use Kelly anyways. There is, and I have a calculator for Kelly.
4639.04s:  So I pay attention to it. It's absolutely part of my input. But I wouldn't size something
4644.40s:  based on Kelly. And the reason why I don't size things based on Kelly is because you have to take
4649.68s:  the entire portfolio into account. So there's a reality that we need to monitor things like
4658.00s:  correlation risk, incising risk between some of the different names that we're trading. And Kelly
4663.92s:  loses that sensitivity. And it's again, just focused on optimal sizing with respect to growth.
4670.88s:  So
4671.20s:  it can be a useful tool for sure. And I like Kelly to be clear. Kelly is one of those things
4681.20s:  that's widely misunderstood by most traders, just because they're used to seeing it in sports
4687.28s:  betting or gambling binary outcome. Same thing like Martin Gale. Martin Gale gets such a bad rap.
4693.36s:  Martin Gale can be completely, completely profitable if it's adapted correctly for the circumstance.
4701.68s:  But most people don't do that. Because they lazy, bro. Most people don't do that because
4709.12s:  it's not an easy question to answer and you have to do a lot of research. So
4717.52s:  anything else? Any other questions? Great questions. Great conversation. I really like the topics
4722.56s:  that you guys brought up. And I hope that the overarching message is at least useful from a
4729.52s:  skilled dev perspective. The key takeaways here in creating your own approach to creating an
4736.16s:  exit strategy for all of your options trades is that it should be predefined and it should be
4743.12s:  within the bounds of your broader risk tolerance. And it should be custom sized to the individual
4749.28s:  strategies and what the strategies back in. Another reality is if you have a strategy, for example,
4758.00s:  and by the way, the only reason why I'm still going is because I got to note that my call has
4761.44s:  canceled. We've been working on a bunch of stuff on one of the properties that I invest in with
4770.08s:  a few of my friends. And we were working on a bunch of stuff earlier today, but we apparently
4776.64s:  don't have to have a call now, which is good. But based on the strategies, you need to look at things
4783.84s:  like the standard deviation and the coefficient variance. And between both of those,
4790.64s:  they can help you understand how varied your strategy is so that you can come up with better
4796.96s:  guidelines on how to manage it. And again, that's also why the nuance of all of this is really,
4804.32s:  really important. So for those that are in the pro side of things, if you have a strategy
4811.76s:  that you want us to talk about in the case study tomorrow, in the discord, give me the metrics.
4817.36s:  I essentially just need the average win, average loss, win rate, loss rate, number of trades.
4824.56s:  And then I can walk you through how to optimize the exit strategy for that specific strategy.
4830.96s:  And then we can talk about some of those broader core concepts and developing like a fundamental
4835.92s:  respect for other portfolio level inputs, like correlation, which is a big thing. If you have a
4843.68s:  bunch of strategies that are all risk sized at 1% total risk, but you have 30 positions that are
4851.04s:  the same thing, well, really, you're kind of sitting at 30% risk way more than otherwise you
4857.20s:  thought you were having simply because it's divvied up between individual positions. So that
4861.76s:  correlation, relationship is super, super important. All right, looks like we good. All right, everybody,
4873.52s:  is as always, if there's anything that you need, hit me up. I'm here for you. I hope that the
4878.80s:  session's useful. If you have questions or if you have follow-ups, feel free to throw it in the
4882.32s:  discord. Happy to chat with you all and see if we can help get everybody on target. Be in
4887.20s:  outlier. See you guys later.
