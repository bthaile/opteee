858.00s: you
860.00s: so one of the beautiful things
862.00s: about using the flexible
864.00s: grids like this to give you
866.00s: essentially propping up the entire energy sector right now that otherwise is very clearly
872.74s: sucking wind. So if we take a look at, let's do the six month performance. If we take
877.78s: a look at the energy sector, this is within the S&P 500, there are how many names in
884.48s: here, 22 and of those 22, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, half of them have a greater
895.02s: than 0, 6 month percent change performance. And you can take three of them off so that we
902.38s: can get to the number that are at least up 10% plus. So the energy sector right now is
909.94s: struggling, but there are very clear pockets of strength. And it's important to continue
915.94s: identifying those pockets of strength. And we'll see again, if any of this budget offload
922.14s: that we're finding and is going through doge might bleed into incentives that Trump
928.02s: could put in place for incentivizing some of his broader initiatives that he has discussed
934.14s: so far, some of which are obviously drilling more oil and things like that. So that's
939.62s: one of the key themes that I definitely keyed into. And then I want to go back and take
944.08s: a look through this CPI thing. Now, if you were called on the Sunday stream, and then
948.32s: I think I also reiterated it on the Monday stream, the reason why CPI is really important
954.52s: is because, sorry, my dog was breathing really weird. And it's because his head is like
965.44s: hanging off the bed. So his neck is at like a 40 degree angle. Clearly making breathing
974.50s: difficult. But the strength of the consumer right now is super important. So when we
981.26s: see CPI starting to tick up, and then we also still have a couple other metrics that were
990.26s: me, I assume you might be too. But that we are talking about are not just you're over
998.32s: here CPI, but here. So you can see retail sales. And I don't know why there's German stuff
1007.82s: in here. There shouldn't be German stuff. I was like, why am I looking at stuff from Germany?
1017.34s: I mean, I like our German friends, but I don't really care about their markets right now
1022.58s: to be honest with you. So for CPI, and then tomorrow, we'll have month over month for PPI and PPI
1032.78s: we're also going to have retail sales. So retail sales tomorrow will be the next big look we have
1038.02s: at seeing at least how the consumer is doing and what this might mean for the market. And this
1045.22s: all goes back. I was going to say Harkins back because I've heard that word before, but then I
1050.66s: stopped myself because I actually don't know what Harkins means. But I wanted to say it because
1055.78s: it sounds fun. I think it makes sense to say it, but it's just a fun sounding word. This Harkins
1062.58s: back to the conversation from yesterday and the day before, which is the market clearly is in a
1070.74s: bit of a holding pattern. So let me move this back to the market overview. And if we take a
1076.02s: look at the market performance over the last three days, it's essentially unchanged. And I think
1082.98s: a lot of this is because the market right now is trying to figure out what direction we break and
1088.34s: if so, how strong. And as I will continue beating the strum, I do think the pot odds still favor
1096.34s: a downside move. Now, when I say that, when I say pot odds in this perspective, it's in terms of
1101.94s: the risk we take. So if I were to give straight probabilistic assessment, I would have to continue to
1109.30s: gauge and prioritize probabilistic move to the upside simply because of drift. But in the near
1117.94s: term and the way that the market is currently setting up to me, it feels like the better return on
1124.58s: risk potential play here is actually to the downside. So we talked about handing or we talked about
1132.82s: building a couple bearish style trades. We actually looked at some of them yesterday. And I added a
1139.30s: few to the book in general because I do think again, just from a probabilistic standpoint, I'm still
1147.06s: net positive deltas and I still will continue to be that until there's a broad regime change,
1152.02s: which we're not in yet, in my opinion. There's still a little time for that. But I think right now,
1159.54s: with the market generally stalling out, this also goes back to when I gave you guys the last update on
1164.34s: the covered strangle allocations. Most of the allocations there are pretty light on the equity side
1171.46s: of things. Most of them are 20% and less of the total current cash utilized and they're much heavier
1177.14s: on the cash secured put side. And it's because cash secured puts right now, we're still making money.
1182.50s: I actually dropped this in the discord earlier today because it's a fun case study where
1187.86s: if we take a look at T triple cues and I forgot the position. I actually think I might have
1192.58s: managed it today. I'll tell you what the position was so that you guys can take a crack at the case
1197.30s: study. So what I had asked was I said that I'm short the 21 Feb. Let's go to 21 Feb.
1207.94s: I was saying that I'm short the 21 Feb 78 puts. And today, the market was down,
1218.98s: but the puts were profitable, meaning the puts actually contracted in value. So typically,
1224.50s: when the market goes down, we expect puts to go up in value. So there is a really key
1232.66s: series of changes that happen that led to the puts actually being profitable on the day,
1238.26s: even though that the market opened down. And I gave a brief overview in the discord, but it
1243.86s: comes down to a couple key factors. Now, there were a couple guesses. I know people were in
1251.14s: they're talking about things like Delta decay. And Delta decay is part of it, but that's actually not
1259.30s: one of the primary drivers that you saw here. And that's obviously talking about like charm.
1263.86s: And the third order second and third order Greeks, some of them, I think people were thrown around
1268.74s: like Van Eyes saw in there, which is good that we're talking about the third order Greeks.
1272.90s: But we can simplify because remember the third order Greeks, they just help us understand
1276.98s: what's happening, right? That's the way that we measure things. And we can see even on the day,
1283.62s: the Delta for these puts is now 13 cents. So we can assume that when the market opened
1291.14s: earlier today in T triple Q's and the market was down at 82, which is essentially $3
1298.26s: less than where we are now. So we can do the surrogate strike game. We can essentially pretend
1304.18s: that our 78s were actually looking like similar to the 81s. So they ended up looking much better
1312.42s: throughout the day because of the rally. So what happened here? Well, we can see that we would
1317.46s: have lost on a Delta perspective because the directional move would have gone against us.
1322.26s: We can see gamma would have been actually ramping against us. But take a look at theta and Vega.
1331.54s: Right. So theta took out 10 cents day over day. And it would have been more if we were
1337.06s: closer to at the money earlier today. And then Vega. So today was a really interesting example
1344.26s: of where the market actually had a bit of a down tick. But the corresponding volatility relative
1351.54s: to the cycle that we're in did not have that drastic of a corresponding volatility up tick.
1358.26s: So let me show you this. What I'm going to do is add another volatility line. I typically keep
1364.26s: them off for you guys just because the way that I look at this in case you were ever wondering what
1369.22s: it actually looks like for me, it's like this, which is I normally don't do this because I know that
1375.22s: it's like insanely overwhelming to the standard looker. But like this. So it's a very noisy chart.
1387.54s: But what I can do is I can isolate volatility behavior for different time frames. So if I close
1394.18s: this off for now and we start seeing how volatility behaved for various time frames, you'll notice
1401.54s: that it didn't behave the same on the day. So to make this easier to see, let's move this into like a
1407.14s: three month daily. Let's go even further. We'll do like a 30 day that's going to flatten it out too
1413.46s: much. I'm trying to find like a really effective view for you guys that makes it easier to see.
1419.54s: I think this one's probably the best, the three month daily. And you can see that even just
1426.98s: eyeballing the ends of these yellow lines here, which is implied volatility. We can see that some of
1432.58s: them are slightly upward sloping and we can see some of them are slightly downward sloping.
1439.14s: So to make this a little cleaner so that it's not quite as noisy for you, what I normally show you
1445.94s: here is literally just 30 day vol. And then I show you the VRP, which simplifies the plot quite a
1455.30s: lot for a one day and then normally a seven day period. So there would be two VRP lines in here.
1463.78s: So anyways, back to what I want to show you, which is the seven day vol. If I show you seven day vol
1470.42s: and make sure that there's no others. Oh, yeah, we want 365 out of here. Notice what happened to
1478.90s: seven day vol. That's this one. What happened to seven day vol day over day, 11th and 12th? Seven day
1488.98s: vol contracted. Seven day vol contracted nearly a point. So even though we saw an expansion in
1499.54s: 30 day vol, we saw a contraction in seven day vol. Now that contraction in seven day vol can be
1511.70s: visualized in a few different ways. So what I'll do to try to make it a little easier. I don't know
1517.38s: how difficult that is for you guys to see. I'm trying to make it so it's the difference between
1524.10s: these is a little more pronounced between seven and 30 day vol. So I'm making this one much darker,
1529.46s: 30 day vol versus seven. Let me know if that helps. Meaning seven day vol is here. And you can see
1536.74s: seven day vol actually contracted on the day. And now we can use the Greeks to see why would seven
1544.34s: day vol have contracted relative to 30 day vol. If we're in this bigger down move. And again, it was
1552.26s: an up move on the day. So I'm talking earlier in the day. Okay, cool. Thank you, Tommy. I wanted to
1557.38s: make sure that I wasn't like just fucking talking about something. You guys are like, what the
1560.26s: hell is this guy on about? The end of the day obviously was a big rally. So all of this conversation
1565.22s: is rooted towards the beginning half of where we gaped down to 82 and then slowly started rallying.
1573.14s: So there's a specific Greek that explains this to us. And do you know what that Greek is? And then
1581.22s: we're at 520. So then I will pivot us after this who are skilled development sessions. But I'm curious
1586.66s: if you guys know the Greek. Let me grab. I'll give you the answer too. It'll take you a second to
1593.14s: find it anyways. So you could poke through there. I'm going to open the door for Thor.
1597.46s: What do you guys see? So right now we should be trying to understand the rate of change of volatility,
1617.38s: not from Vega, which is just from a raw move in volatility. That's part of it. But there's another
1628.18s: Greek that helps us understand essentially Vega decay, which is Veda. Kind of like Darth Veda. Darth
1638.58s: Veda. Close enough. Darth Veda. So Darth Veda is effectively your volatility, your Vega decay. So
1652.90s: Veda tells us rate of change per one rate of change in premium for 1% move in IV. Veda tells us
1665.06s: Vega rate of change when there's a move in VAL and passage of time, which is what happened here.
1672.90s: And that's exactly why you see what you see here. Now a couple other answers that I saw, let me see,
1679.06s: that we're pretty close. One of them was charm. And again, this actually wasn't charm. So for those
1687.94s: that don't know, charm is just delta decay. And again, it's essentially the change in delta from
1695.94s: the passage of time. And it's not charm that led to this. And Vanna is close to it. Vanna is close
1706.18s: to it. But it's not exactly it either. The more direct impact is from Veda. And again, those are
1717.06s: really just different ways that helps us measure it. I actually think, let me take a look real quick.
1727.22s: I think I might have built a reference for you guys. Where would I have put it? Give me one sec.
1735.14s: So I think it might be useful.
1738.34s: Is it in this? Sort by date.
1750.02s: No.
1755.22s: Damn it. Let me see if I can find it really quick. Because I literally just built this not that long ago.
1765.62s: And what I was building was like a really, really basic chart that helps you visualize
1777.70s: the various Greeks and their impact on.
1782.50s: This is not it. I will look for it. And then once I find it, I'll put it in the discord.
1796.66s: Oh, it might have been hold on. It might be on the phone. I think that might have been what happened.
1801.30s: I think it might be in here.
1803.54s: Aha. Found it. So what I'll do is I will drop this in the discord for you guys.
1812.98s: But essentially what I did is I made like a really, really simple table that allows you to understand
1818.66s: the difference in all of the different Greeks and what they measure. The one that I use in the
1825.70s: screenshot that I showed you, it's kind of by design. It's supposed to be a little more noisy.
1831.86s: But the whole point of it is to be more specific, meaning, you know,
1836.34s: include the formulas and the actual movement of things. Whereas this one that I'm going to upload
1841.70s: right now is just like a word picture that helps you understand. So this is Greeks overview.
1852.98s: So I'm uploading that to Google Drive and then I'll be able to share that with you guys.
1861.78s: Well, let me see if you guys have any questions on that.
1867.06s: Haters says the seven day volvertured evolved put option with seven days left. Yes.
1873.70s: Not to the vol of the put option though. Seven day, seven day vol just
1878.98s: refers to implied volatility for a seven day time frame. We can segment implied volatility.
1885.14s: When you look at the implied volatility for a stock, this is annualized.
1889.54s: So we can essentially use the square root of time to determine for a bunch of different time
1897.06s: frames. What we think volatility might be either as a raw number as an expected move.
1902.74s: So when I'm talking about the different period of volatility, it's literally looking at this.
1911.78s: This difference in volatility that you see here. I forgot I can draw on this.
1916.74s: And while we're doing a volatility recap since we're here already, what is this called?
1926.42s: This over here. The fact that 14 Feb is 62.6% vol and the fact that's 14 Feb.
1937.14s: And then 21 March is 62.1% and then let's do 15 Jan.
1951.38s: 27. This is 55.1% vol.
1956.66s: Term structure. So this shows us the volatility relative to different periods and time.
1970.42s: This is your term structure. Now, James, who's speculating on contango versus backwardation,
1980.10s: contango or backwardation is just the classification of term structure.
1985.14s: So contango is what we tend to see markets in. This is actually in backwardation right here.
1990.90s: This is a great example of backwardation.
1998.10s: So contango is the propensity for further out volatility to be higher than near term volatility,
2006.34s: which is lower. So this would be DTE. This would be zero. This would be N plus one. I guess T plus one.
2019.54s: T plus one dot dot dot. So generally speaking, this is the configuration you'll have.
2028.02s: The further out in time you go, the more volatility you expect to see over that time frame.
2034.34s: This is contango. Backwardation is actually what this is configured as right now where this 14 Feb
2040.50s: expiry is 62.6. And this is actually 55.1 backwards. Backwardation.
2048.18s: Tweet. All right, we are at 530. I don't want to chew up too much time on volatility. We actually
2054.58s: just did a session on this. And I want to make sure that we have enough time to do our case study.
2059.62s: But honestly, great questions. As you know, always happy to talk about volatility.
2063.38s: Volatility is super, super important.
2067.86s: Re says isn't contango backwardation using reference of interest rates? Not really.
2072.74s: You can, but that's it's more in reference to the yield curve. So if you're talking about interest
2079.46s: rates, specifically the yield curve than yes. But contango and backwardation. And again,
2085.06s: that's essentially the same thing that you see here, right? So for yield curve,
2090.82s: yeah. So Reese, that's the way to frame what you're asking now is in reference to a yield curve.
2097.38s: And this is a volatility curve. The way to think about these different curves is it just looks at
2103.70s: a relative level at different points in time. That's how we create a curve. So if we take a look at,
2113.62s: if I turn this into a time series, which would be easier for you to see like this.
2120.02s: And then this would be T zero. And then again, this would be T plus one dot, dot, dot. Meaning
2126.34s: just further out in time. But to make this easier, we'll just do T zero. This will be seven day.
2133.14s: This will be T plus 30, T plus 90. So these are different explorations. You can sub in
2142.66s: anything for these. This can be the sofa rate. This can be a two year note. This can be 10 years.
2152.90s: This can be 30 years. So then if we have a 30 year, I actually have no idea what they're trading
2159.70s: for right now to be completely honest. Let's see. Where is it?
2172.66s: So the 30 years at 4.828. So put that here. 4.828. And then we'll just do one more of them.
2195.86s: Because I think you guys get the example at this point. 10 year 4.6 1 year 4.3.
2206.26s: 4.6. And then this is I think a 1 year actually, which is 4.3.
2215.78s: So the curve here looks like this.
2218.18s: Just like that. And for those that have that have checked out the box spread video, I literally show
2230.34s: you exactly how to make a yield curve. And I'll give you. I'll give you what it actually is.
2238.90s: Because the tool that I built really it's super simple to use. All we do is copy all of this
2246.82s: stuff in to my sheet. It auto updates the curve. And then I'll show you what the curve is right now.
2264.82s: Where did it go? I'm going to paste it in here. Uh-huh. Great success.
2272.58s: This is the curve right now, the yield curve. So notice the name of this. This is from a sheet that I made.
2281.54s: And again, those that are in the the proside you guys have this template.
2288.58s: So what this is is it shows us the relative yield for all these different time frames.
2294.90s: So then we can visualize where things might be relatively expensive. And I 180 days for sure.
2303.38s: And then we can see where they're relatively cheap. Essentially one year. That's relatively cheap.
2308.50s: Way too cheap. And again, whether it's the yield curve that we're talking about. These are just
2315.46s: different words. Yield curve. This can be volatility curve. You can have gamma curves.
2328.02s: Vata curves.
2331.38s: Etc. And when we're talking about curves in this context, what we're talking about is a time series
2336.98s: plot. And then a relative value. That's all. So then when I'm showing you tools like this,
2351.22s: this is a delta and DTE curve. This is a theta decay curve. This is a Vega curve. This is a
2359.62s: gamma curve. So the context of curve as we're talking about it here is simply a time series plot
2368.90s: of the input value, whatever it is that we're talking about. And I think that's the that's the
2376.26s: gist. Does that all make sense? You can put a ton of stuff on a curve. And then again,
2386.66s: contango versus backwardation just refers to the structure. What we're observing on the curve.
2398.98s: I don't know if silence is good, meaning you guys are all locked on. Okay, cool. Thank you,
2403.22s: Tommy. Tommy, you're the man. Because after I finished explaining some of this stuff, sometimes I
2407.78s: genuinely am like, I have no idea if that Helter did not help at all. So thank you, Tommy. Very useful.
2414.66s: Be back for me. Okay. Now we got some work to do. The case study, which is what are we at? We're at
2423.62s: 40 20. And this is, oh, this isn't the case study that I'll be tomorrow. Skiz skills dev.
2431.46s: Creating an option trade exit.
2439.38s: Strategy. Beautiful. Let me open up the door for Thor.
2453.70s: We have a ritual now where he runs out for his dinner and then he runs back in immediately
2458.18s: post dinner and gets back in his heated blanket. It's actually fucking hilarious. So the session for
2464.26s: today for the skill development is about creating an exit strategy for options trades. And the reason
2477.14s: why I'm talking about this is because for most people, we know that this is a purely random
2483.38s: effect. This is something that we kind of just try to figure out as we go. As promised, here's a
2492.26s: video about risk management with respect to this broader conversation that we're going to have.
2498.90s: And here's, here's where things start to become more important. So let's take a look at this.
2506.98s: For Joe McFatguy, which is obviously absolutely epic name. Joe McFatguy.
2514.34s: They have a $200 loss on their calls. Do they hold or do they sell? What's the answer to this?
2521.06s: Now, the easy answer to this is, well, it depends. Right? Because it obviously does. It depends on
2528.58s: the strategy. It depends on what their idea was. It depends on a lot of stuff. So the very first
2537.22s: step when we're considering an exit strategy
2543.62s: is very simple. There are going to be core concepts.
2557.62s: These core concepts are going to apply to literally everything. And then there's going to be
2564.18s: strategy specific.
2573.46s: And these strategy specific concepts, as you probably can guess, they're relative to the actual
2580.82s: strategy. Let me grab the chat here. I want to be able to hang out with you guys.
2587.78s: Reese says, are they naked or covered? These are, well, you answer it based on what you can see in
2594.18s: this because you can answer that for yourself for the contracts here.
2598.34s: So your terminal learning objective for the session today, what you should walk away with,
2610.66s: is an understanding of how to create an effective process for determining exit points in a strategy.
2622.58s: That's your terminal learning objective. And then for those that are in the pro-patrion,
2627.86s: tomorrow, when we will do our case study, we're actually going to use some of your strategies
2635.06s: to figure out what's optimal for your strategy and how we can build it in an actual practical sense.
2642.98s: So here, this homey bought 10 of these calls. He bought 10 for $6.00 and $5.00.
2658.18s: Bottom on the six of Feb. And now they're currently trading at 315.
2666.26s: So this represents a essentially 50% decline. I actually don't know what they're talking about
2675.38s: with $200 calls lost. This is way more than that.
2680.50s: Okay. Well, they're also very confused about the relative size of their own risk, which is
2688.42s: actually kind of fucking crazy. So anyways, let's take a look. I want to talk about, and I want to
2697.70s: add some common misconceptions that we're going to talk about. And as always, with the common
2707.38s: misconceptions, the goal is at the end of the video, you should have the correct answer for all of
2713.78s: these. So let's take a look. Misconceptions. One of them is never, never risk more than
2735.38s: 10%. The second one is always lock in profit. Third is green.
2760.66s: And the one that I got all fucked up. Always better than red, which is bullshit anyways, because red is my favorite color.
2781.86s: And then the last one is take profits at x percent. Okay. So from a high level,
2804.42s: have you all heard of at least one of these or did all of these things that I throw up here?
2811.14s: Does this all sound kind of crazy? Or does this generally make sense? Meaning this is at least
2820.50s: something you might have heard at some point? Any question? Okay. Resets heard them, but not from you.
2832.90s: Oh, definitely. I'm glad you haven't heard them from me, because I won't say stupid shit like this.
2836.58s: This doesn't make sense. N54 says you have heard it. They swags this three quarters. Okay, great.
2843.14s: So these are things that you've heard to varying degrees before. These are things that typically sound smart.
2849.14s: And I'm going to show you, not going to tell you directly, but I'm going to show you why literally all
2856.82s: of these are misconceptions. So now let's go back up and let's get back into the core concepts
2863.30s: for an exit strategy. So the very basis of an exit strategy starts from the most basic point.
2872.74s: What is the most basic point? If we're thinking about an exit point that always makes sense
2882.58s: regardless of the strategy you have on, what could that be? Any guesses?
2891.14s: Reece says when do you cut losses? No, that's not it, because remember exit strategy is not just
2897.86s: for losing trades. Exit strategy is also for winning trades. So we can talk about winning trades
2902.98s: and losing trades separately for sure. But your scenario, Reece, of when do you cut losses?
2911.94s: Is important. Oh, whoa. I want you to zoom up one click from that.
2924.10s: When would we make when would we cut a loss?
2931.22s: Reece says just thought risk being the main thing we can control. It's a great guess.
2934.74s: You're not wrong, by the way. You're not wrong at all. I just want to zoom you up one more level.
2939.06s: Because when we get into the actual point where we cut losses, that's actually where we become
2943.14s: more strategy specific. Okay, Impala is heard of all four. Great. This is good. So then by the end
2951.14s: of this, you guys should have a pretty good sense of why these are all nonsense.
2957.70s: So Reece, zoom your answer up one level. You're saying when to when to cut losses,
2965.14s: why would we cut losses?
2973.70s: Papa proper is very close. Ah, there you go. Ryan's got it. Nice job, Ryan.
2981.70s: So Ryan is saying when the thesis is proven or disproven,
2994.66s: this is literally the root of every single trade that goes on on when we should exit the trade or
3006.82s: begin looking to exit at the trade is when our idea is either validated or invalidated that has
3018.58s: nothing to do with an arbitrary percent move in the underlying. It has everything to do with
3026.02s: what your thesis is. Because let's say for example, let me hide all that stuff. Let's say for
3039.78s: example that you're in Nvidia. And let's say that you're an investor and your vision in Nvidia
3050.74s: is that in a one year time horizon, it'll be worth more than it is right now. But let's say you
3056.98s: also have a rule in place in your portfolio because you heard that this was smart, that at any point
3064.50s: the ticker has a 10% drawdown from wherever, let's just pick a level, 10% drawdown that you should get out.
3074.02s: Well, what would have happened here? In something like Nvidia, when it was 136 up here,
3080.18s: and traded down at 91, guess what would have happened? You would have gotten out.
3085.30s: But even if we look at the movement from here to here, it's been in profit since for sure.
3094.66s: So the point is if you pick an arbitrary number, it might not align with the actual idea.
3106.74s: The idea in this case is an investment, a longer term idea. So if we go back now to this and we
3117.54s: add our second or concept, it's that exit must fit thesis.
3136.10s: The exit has to fit the thesis. If you use an arbitrary exit that doesn't align with your thesis,
3148.42s: you are at a natural crossroads that don't make sense. Okay, so now let's talk about some strategy
3157.62s: specific concepts. This has everything to do with expected return.
3171.94s: The expected return of the strategy is what will guide where our exits should be.
3187.06s: So now let's talk about the two elements of an exit strategy.
3200.66s: The first one has to be what we talked about up here. So predefined,
3216.50s: targets. This can be P and L. This can be stock. Again, this will be based on the strategy.
3234.34s: The second element of an exit strategy is the method. This is, do we use a mental stop?
3249.30s: Do we scale? Do we have a resting stop?
3255.46s: These are the two primary elements of an exit strategy. The first thing is you need to define it.
3264.58s: And then the second thing is you have to determine the corresponding method that makes the most sense.
3269.38s: So I've given you examples before about making sure that the exit strategy itself
3284.34s: fits the opportunity. And then for the strategy specific side of things that the expected return
3292.02s: is still positively expected. So I'm going to clear all this off. I don't want to get rid of the
3299.14s: misconceptions though. So I'm going to take a screenshot of these.
3305.70s: Here.
3313.70s: And now I can delete. So now let's hypothesize a little bit. Let's say that what's one of those
3334.10s: rules that you've heard? Have you guys heard specific percentages?
3338.74s: Like always take your profits at blank or never risk blank? Have you guys heard of any of those kinds of
3346.50s: things? I'm specifically asking like specific percentages or numbers that you've heard relative to
3355.54s: those? 50% max profit. Okay.
3367.70s: Now that's a tasty trade artifact, which obviously I'm familiar with. And this is on short
3375.14s: options if we've sold something. So the idea here is 50% max profit.
3385.62s: So to illustrate this one, I'm actually going to grab a website and we're going to take a look
3393.30s: together. Let's do. This is all good. Let's do two of these. I'm running a test really quick.
3417.30s: Paul says does 50% apply to all DTE? Well, it's based on the broader tasty trade methodology,
3426.02s: which they're going to sell typically at 45 DTE. And then it'll be 50% or closest to 20 or 21 days,
3433.38s: I think. But the reality is that that actually is not the correct answer. That's just a simplified
3440.34s: answer. That answer is designed to make it easier for you to synthesize and figure out what you
3448.98s: should do and what you shouldn't do. But it's not the correct answer. And I'll give you an exact
3454.58s: example of why this is. So let's take a look on short term strategies. So let's take a look on why
3467.78s: Dase Swag is completely wrong on his idea. So what I'm looking at is trading zero DTE options
3476.42s: in SPX. And I want to show you two different scenarios.
3483.46s: So for these two different scenarios, you can see this one has a higher win rate. This one up
3507.14s: here is managing at 50% max. You can see the actual return is much better. This is no exit
3523.62s: to experee. So the performance goes from a 2.4%
3533.06s: to a 1.8%
3536.90s: Cacker. Let me move my head out of the way.
3548.34s: There.
3553.86s: So this is an example where just defaulting to 50% max profit literally doesn't make any sense.
3564.02s: And it's way more nuanced than that.
3571.78s: So the art of developing the actual exit plan comes down to understanding the strategy that you're
3580.74s: using. And then what periods functionally make sense to get out at. And the way that we figure
3589.62s: that out is by actually looking at the strategy. If you don't look at the strategy, you will not know.
3595.86s: There's no way for you to know. So if we take a look at the misconceptions, the first one is
3604.18s: take profits at x%. Well, we know this isn't true. The reason why we know it's not true to set a fixed
3611.46s: take profit at blank percent is because it's going to be highly relative to the strategy.
3618.34s: So as always, we can display this. We can illustrate this with an example. And it'll be done through
3627.38s: the expected return formula. So we have an average win.
3636.66s: We have a win rate. We have an average loss. We have a loss rate.
3648.34s: So let's take a look at a couple simple scenarios. Let's say our average win is one
3664.74s: Hyundai. One Hyundai dollar. And let's say our win rate is 90%. Let's say our average loss is 2000
3680.66s: and loss rate 10%. The expected return here, pretty simple formula, average win times win rate
3699.78s: plus average loss times loss rate. You have a negatively expected strategy. Even though you are
3711.70s: winning a shit ton of times, you are winning 90% of your trades. 10% of your trades are wiping you
3719.14s: out. And this goes even further than that. Right? So let's take a look at one other thing. Let me see.
3729.46s: This is okay. Give me one sec. I want to grab another example. I just have to find it for you.
3742.98s: I did like a series of examples with this. I can't find it.
3761.70s: I'm going to give you a wave forward. And then for those that are in the pro livestream tomorrow,
3778.66s: this is where we're actually going to like lift this and use this to create the actual steps for the
3784.90s: case study. So the key takeaway here is that you cannot apply a random approach. The approach has
3797.70s: to be based on the strategy because now let's take a look at a couple different scenarios. Let's say
3804.98s: that you have a system. We'll do it down here. Let's say that you have a system that has 10
3812.58s: winning trades and two losing trades. Actually, we'll do eight and two to keep it at 10.
3821.86s: So let's do the same thing here. And let's see what the numbers do. Let's just have a little fun
3830.66s: and tinker a little bit. And I know that it might be weird that this is the idea of fun, but this is
3837.46s: and it is fun. So let's have these inputs instead. What I'm going to do
3852.66s: is have number of wins, number of losses,
3856.82s: and then I'm going to calculate this. So this will be this divided by this plus this.
3876.58s: The reason I'm doing it via formulas so that we can play around a little bit because what do you notice?
3894.82s: What just happened in these two different systems? They represent literally the same thing.
3900.98s: But if we have these slight changes in a system where the win rate is 90%,
3915.14s: the loss rate is 10% 9 and 1. We come to our expected discern of negative 110. So then as we
3923.22s: start blowing up these samples a little bit, you'll see provided that we stay exactly in the same
3930.26s: sample size, the expected return will still show obviously the same rate. But the difference is that
3938.18s: it very rarely is going to show the same exact expected return as the sample size changes because
3946.26s: slight differences are going to enter into the system. So now there's a really, really important
3954.34s: way we need to be able to identify one of the most important traits with respect to a strategy.
3962.42s: I'm actually going to build a standalone video on it. The thing I'm going to show you all is how
3969.94s: you can figure out the number of trades you need to determine once you have a set confidence
3977.06s: interval. So I use like a 95% confidence interval in the number of trades required so that you know
3983.06s: that the strategy that you're using again with the 95% confidence interval is actually representative
3989.06s: of the expected return because what we don't know in this strategy here or this strategy here
3996.10s: is have we put on enough trades to know that this expected return is accurate or not. Does this
4004.26s: actually reflect the performance of the strategy and the reality is we don't know
4011.06s: because there's a simple way to calculate that which that will be a time lesson for another time
4020.18s: since we are pretty much at time here. So let's finish out these misconceptions. The never risk more
4029.46s: than x percent on an individual trade. This loses all nuance in a strategy. So let's say
4039.86s: that in this case we're using a $100,000 portfolio. And what are some of the common numbers that you
4049.30s: that you're told to never risk more than anybody have one that comes to the top of your mind.
4055.22s: Never risk more than 1% resets. Great. So 1% risk. We can again do the math obviously you can
4070.98s: just do the mental math here but so on a 1% max loss let's see what happens here. Let's see that
4083.54s: if our average loss is negative 1100. Interesting. So in this sample so far we see that if we risk more than
4098.02s: 1% this looks to hold right. Well what happens if our average win isn't actually $100?
4106.66s: What happens if our average win is $150?
4113.54s: Serious. Now it's fine.
4117.86s: So the point that I'm making is that these blank rules of never risk more than blank percent
4125.70s: are it's just ignorant because it doesn't take into account the nuance of a strategy.
4132.10s: In this strategy you win 90% of the time at $150. You lose 10% the time at $1100 which exceeds the
4140.66s: maximum allowable risk. You make money. This is not bad. This is completely okay. So when we think about
4152.26s: never risk more than blank percent that comes down to a personal decision based on your risk tolerance.
4163.30s: I can give you examples of some of my friends that are traders that trade actually very concentrated
4168.34s: portfolio of three tickers and their portfolio will go through 30-40% drawdowns. They still make good
4177.22s: money because when the trades come online they make a lot of money but that's based on the
4184.66s: performance of their broader system. Right. So when we look at this here and this here the only time
4197.62s: to set some sort of risk percent protocol is based on yourself what you prefer risk. That's it.
4204.34s: Nothing else. So this next idea of always lock in a profit.
4214.74s: The reason why this makes again no sense is because if we overemphasize the idea of green being
4223.22s: better than red or locking in a profit what happens. Our average wind size is going to go down
4231.86s: and it's because a lot of trades will have periods where they're losing money before they make money
4237.62s: again. So then if you have a trade that's showing a $10 gain and you want to never let anything go
4244.34s: from profit to loss so then you take it off when it goes to zero. You have a $0 gain once you
4249.30s: include fees obviously you lost a little bit of money but then that trade started to roll back up
4254.66s: and actually make money. It doesn't make sense and if you're doing something like selling premium
4262.50s: this essentially will never this will never make sense because short options tend to take a bumpy path
4271.46s: to profitability take some time for them. So it's just another example on why that in a broad sense
4280.34s: doesn't really apply holistically. It's just not good advice and the idea of green being
4289.14s: always better than red is pure foolishness because it focuses on the outcome of individual trades
4299.14s: and it does not emphasize the overall profitability of the system which is extremely important.
4309.06s: The overall profitability of the system is way more important than if we're green or red
4314.34s: on an individual opportunity and that's just the reality.
4320.90s: So
4325.06s: any questions on what we talked about here with respect to creating an ex-strategy for an
4330.74s: option straight the way we create an ex-strategy is very simple. We first design a couple core
4337.62s: concepts that apply to literally everything we do. Then we set up a rules based approach where
4345.22s: we might have overarching risk management protocols for the entire portfolio but each individual
4351.22s: strategy needs to have its own defined levels based on what the strategy is. If you're trading
4358.74s: something like a zero DTE strategy that has a ton of trades the expected return formula for
4366.74s: that is going to look a lot differently than if you're trading something on a quarterly basis.
4373.30s: So it has to be made relative to the strategy it cannot be these just blank sweep rules they don't
4380.50s: mean anything. There are things that sound smart that are not smart they're misleading.
4386.02s: Joseph says one case most ideal and options on a 100,000 account that's again that's kind of
4395.70s: going off what I was just talking about. It's not ideal. What is ideal technically what's ideal
4403.22s: can be determined by Kelly criterion but realistically what's ideal is highly relative to the
4411.94s: strategy. So if we're trading strategies that are more speculative in nature then maybe not risking
4422.50s: more than one two three percent on an individual trade can make sense. It could it could make complete
4429.46s: sense or if you're trading a strategy that's typically more profitable in the long run then one
4437.86s: percent might be literally way too tight because if you're going to size things off of that then
4444.34s: you're going to either have to put on a ton of different things in order to make money or
4451.38s: you're going to have to find different names to put on that are not correlated because otherwise
4458.74s: you end up putting on the same total risk if you have to find a bunch of trades so that you're
4463.94s: not risking more than one percent in any one trade. So this also doesn't account for any sort of
4470.66s: correlation risk. So the idea of one percent in again just like a blanket rule loses way too much
4478.34s: nuance. Yeah. Paul says the snag what Kelly criteria is that you really don't know the P. Well
4486.34s: you can know the probability you certainly can again you can look at your historic probability for
4491.30s: a strategy. You can either hypothesize what it is and the thing to remember about the Kelly
4505.54s: Criterion and for people that talk bad about it that they don't understand it is that the Kelly
4512.26s: Criterion does exactly what you want which is optimized for growth. So if you have something that
4519.46s: optimizes for growth what is that tell you well it's going to throw risk management into the wind
4524.82s: meaning it's going to purely optimize for growth. So with Kelly Criterion what a lot of people
4530.58s: do in a practical sense is we use what's called a fractional Kelly sizing. So you can take any
4537.62s: fraction of the total Kelly sizing to fit within your risk tolerance. So some people do half Kelly
4546.02s: some people do quarter Kelly whatever that number is it gives you some like a general starting point
4551.14s: but the whole point of the Kelly Criterion is to optimize for growth and in the pursuit of optimizing
4556.50s: for growth it's absolutely going to push you to some uncomfortable levels. Now to solve for the
4562.10s: probability component you can either use the probability of options when you're entering the trade
4567.78s: or more appropriately you can use the probability based on drum roll your fucking trade log
4574.50s: and on your historic interactions with that strategy that you've carefully logged.
4580.82s: Policies have you used Kelly for formula for multiple outcomes of course. So what you're referring to
4586.82s: is the difference between discrete and indiscreet Kelly. If you use standard Kelly formula in
4592.10s: options markets it makes literally no sense because there's a continuum you need to use continuous
4598.82s: Kelly. If you use discrete Kelly that's based on binary outcomes that's using the exact wrong
4604.42s: tool for the wrong job that's good for binary outcome propositions. The only way to use Kelly in
4611.94s: trading is through a continuous variation of Kelly. If you don't use continuous Kelly then again
4617.70s: it's just not really not really doing you any good you're applying a tool that's meant for another
4626.74s: kind of system. So yeah. But I mean for me I don't use Kelly anyways. There is and I have a
4637.78s: calculator for Kelly so I pay attention to it it's absolutely part of my input but I wouldn't
4643.62s: size something based on Kelly. And the reason why I don't size things based on Kelly is because
4649.06s: you have to take the entire portfolio into account. So there's a reality that
4656.50s: we need to monitor things like correlation risk and sizing risk between some of the different
4661.86s: names that we're trading and Kelly loses that sensitivity. And it's again just focused on
4668.02s: optimal sizing with respect to growth. So
4671.14s: it can be a useful tool for sure. And I like Kelly to be clear. Kelly is one of those things that's
4681.78s: widely misunderstood by most traders just because they're used to seeing it in sports betting or
4687.86s: gambling binary outcome. Same thing like Martin Gale. Martin Gale gets such a bad rap.
4693.38s: Martin Gale can be completely completely profitable if it's adapted correctly for the circumstance.
4701.70s: But most people don't do that. Because they lazy, bro. Most people don't do that because
4709.14s: it's not an easy question to answer and you have to do a lot of research. So
4717.54s: anything else any other questions great questions great conversation. I really like the topics
4722.58s: that you guys brought up. And I hope that the overarching message is at least useful from a
4729.54s: skilled dev perspective. The key takeaways here in creating your own approach to creating an
4736.18s: exit strategy for all of your options trades is that it should be predefined and it should be
4743.14s: within the bounds of your broader risk tolerance and it should be custom sized to the individual
4749.30s: strategies and what the strategies back in. Another reality is if you have a strategy for example
4757.94s: and by the way, the only reason why I'm still going is because I got to note that my call has
4761.38s: canceled. We've been working on a bunch of stuff on one of the properties that I invest in with
4770.02s: a few of my friends. And we were working on a bunch of stuff earlier today, but we apparently don't
4777.54s: have to have a call now, which is good. But based on the strategies, you need to look at things
4783.86s: like the standard deviation and the coefficient variance. And between both of those,
4790.66s: they can help you understand how varied your strategy is so that you can come up with better
4796.90s: guidelines on how to manage it. And again, that's also why the nuance of all of this is really,
4804.26s: really important. So for those that are in the pro side of things, if you have a strategy
4811.78s: that you want us to talk about in the case study tomorrow, in the discord, give me the metrics.
4817.38s: I essentially just need the average win, average loss, win rate, loss rate, number of trades.
4824.58s: And then I can walk you through how to optimize the exit strategy for that specific strategy.
4830.90s: And then we can talk about some of those broader core concepts in developing like a fundamental
4835.94s: respect for other portfolio level inputs, like correlation, which is a big thing.
4843.14s: If you have a bunch of strategies that are all risk sized at 1% total risk, but you have 30
4849.78s: positions that are the same thing, well, really, you're kind of sitting at 30% risk way more
4856.26s: than otherwise you thought you were having simply because it's divvied up between individual
4860.42s: positions. So that correlation, relationship is super, super important.
4867.86s: All right, looks like we good. All right, everybody is as always, if there's anything that you need,
4876.42s: hit me up. I'm here for you. I hope that the session's useful. If you have questions or if you have
4880.82s: follow-ups, feel free to throw it in the discord. Happy to chat with you all and see if we can
4884.90s: help get everybody on target. Be an outlier. See you guys later.
