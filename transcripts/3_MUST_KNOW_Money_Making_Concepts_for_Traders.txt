0.00s: money cannot buy you happiness poverty
2.46s: can't buy you anything that's really the
4.98s: path for most Traders is unsuccessful
8.16s: production of capital meaning we're
10.32s: actually losing money if you think about
13.02s: creating wealth in terms of a broader
15.30s: plan there are a handful of really
17.28s: important Concepts that I'm going to
18.90s: share with you three of them to be
20.40s: specific and these are the exact things
22.80s: that I've used coming from a single mom
25.44s: in a low income area to being a
28.14s: multi-millionaire before I'm 32 and
30.48s: that's not some sort of big Flex I am a
32.88s: neanderthal just like most other Traders
35.10s: the point I'm trying to highlight here
36.84s: is that it is entirely possible to find
39.72s: your way into a different trajectory if
42.42s: you are thoughtful about what you do
44.40s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
45.84s: back to all the outliers shout out to
47.76s: the YouTube members and the patreon fam
49.56s: thank you guys for supporting the
51.06s: channel and let's get right into it the
53.22s: very first thing that you are going to
54.66s: see here are some things that you're not
56.52s: going to want to hear and it's whatever
57.90s: it is what it is the very first thing
61.02s: the five thousand dollar account the ten
63.60s: thousand dollar account that you start
65.10s: with is not going to be your future
67.80s: wealth so this idea of starting with a
70.56s: small amount of money and trading it
72.36s: into a huge amount of money just sets
75.18s: you up for failure to the highest
77.64s: probability do not do this this money is
81.96s: your starting Capital this is not what's
84.48s: going to be your retirement early on
86.78s: obviously the inverse here is saving
90.54s: saving is the hands down most important
93.96s: lever you're going to pull on early no
95.82s: that's not sexy no that's not fun to
98.22s: hear it's the reality because most of us
102.36s: are not special what I mean by that is
105.42s: yes we might think we can pick up skill
108.06s: the skill set of trading we might think
109.68s: that we have a high propensity to be
111.96s: super successful at it we have the
113.52s: skills that might lend us to that
115.74s: success however this is the reality most
119.40s: people do do not most people are posting
122.58s: on Wall Street bets that please help
124.62s: I've not slept in days because their
127.08s: position is down 47 percent over the
130.26s: course of a few days this is the reality
132.72s: so what I offer to you is while you
135.42s: might be special you might have the
137.10s: proclivity to be fantastic at trading
139.74s: you don't really know it up front and
141.90s: most of us aren't so I would avoid
144.78s: planning on the fact that you are Rain
147.90s: Man for your future wealth what I mean
150.06s: by that is focusing on a more
152.10s: probabilistic outcome that's what I did
154.44s: so what does that actually mean well we
157.02s: need to take a look at a few things the
158.46s: first one is the compound growth
159.78s: calculator I've done a bunch of videos
161.10s: on these but what I want to highlight
162.66s: here is this is starting with twenty
164.64s: thousand dollars at a twelve percent
165.90s: yield annual for 20 years notice the 100
169.44s: a month contribution gets you to 280k
172.20s: the one thousand dollar a month gets you
174.24s: to one million dollars what does this
175.98s: tell you saving saving is incredibly
178.62s: important now the ability to change this
181.02s: interest rate by getting better at
182.58s: trading is important but saving is
185.22s: accessible to all of us the variable
187.62s: that is this in terms of the interest
189.96s: rate you're able to produce as a Trader
192.06s: it's a bigger variable and again
193.62s: statistically speaking most people are
195.60s: not going to outperform the market it's
197.04s: a pill that's hard to swallow but it's
198.78s: an important one to acknowledge the
200.52s: other thing is conservative estimates
202.20s: when I'm filling in these things like
203.76s: the monthly contribution to figure out
205.38s: where I want to be in X number of years
207.36s: I'm not pretending I'm going to be able
209.22s: to put everything in there I'm going to
211.14s: plan conservatively that includes both
213.06s: the yield and the monthly contribution
215.16s: but what I'm highlighting here is trying
217.44s: to create a realistic Target for you the
219.96s: only way all of this can happen is if we
222.00s: Embrace this delayed gratification and
225.12s: you might be saying to yourself Eric it
227.10s: doesn't seem like you're delaying
228.30s: gratification
230.04s: and you're right at this point I've
233.16s: delayed gratification long enough to be
235.68s: able to afford things that I enjoy from
238.70s: automotives to trips to Kauai to trips
241.92s: dive trips to Curacao to a two million
244.62s: dollar house in Southern California all
247.08s: of that comes down to careful planning
249.96s: and it starts with delayed gratification
252.18s: the better you can the better job you
254.58s: can do with this early on the bigger the
256.98s: impacts you're going to see on these
260.40s: numbers because again even if you're a
263.22s: really great Trader you can drive the
265.26s: yield of your returns up the more you
268.14s: can turn this number up the better the
271.08s: results are going to be more quickly the
273.90s: other thing I want to highlight on this
275.16s: page is paper trading this is another
276.96s: thing that everybody hates but going
279.24s: back to the idea that we are not special
281.46s: the whole idea of trading is we think we
285.54s: can outperform the market you think you
287.76s: could do better than the market we know
289.50s: statistics basically that that is a
291.48s: small subset of traders that can do that
293.34s: so what does that mean we think we can
295.26s: do something that a lot of people try
296.88s: and they fail at that means you're
298.86s: special but I'm just saying we're not
300.42s: special so how does this happen you've
302.46s: got to develop the skill set it's just
304.26s: like if you do any sort of martial arts
306.06s: there are times when somebody with very
308.40s: little experience can walk in like Jon
310.26s: Jones he can train for a relatively
312.36s: short period of time and he could just
314.10s: start crushing people that exists guess
316.68s: what life isn't fair most of us don't
319.44s: fall into that category and we have to
321.42s: work our asses off to find that same
323.82s: level of success that's what this is the
326.22s: whole idea of paper trading is to make
328.50s: sure that we are developing this skill
330.24s: set while avoiding some of these big
332.94s: pitfalls and that's what I want to talk
334.56s: to you about now is the pitfalls the
337.50s: first one I want to cover is this right
339.42s: here the skill Gap and drawdowns if you
343.68s: start trading right out of the gate
345.06s: because you think you are Rain Man and
347.52s: you're super good at this and despite
349.44s: what everyone but he says you're not
351.24s: going to be that guy and you're not in
353.88s: the scenario where you know you're
355.56s: losing all your money like this dude and
357.78s: you're going to be great cool the
359.52s: problem is good Traders make it look
362.22s: easy that's the skill Gap so it can be
364.62s: very misleading that's one of the issues
366.30s: with trading in general this stock
368.28s: market is unbelievably misleading in
370.68s: that way where the people that do a good
373.14s: job they make it seem easy we want to do
376.02s: things like automate everything we want
377.88s: Algos to do it for us there's a reason
380.22s: why those don't dominate The Marketplace
382.86s: yet because as soon as we can do that
385.14s: everybody will do it even though there
387.72s: are small subsets of people that can
389.94s: make a lot of money training
391.08s: realistically so we got to make sure
393.00s: that we are guarding against skill Gap
395.22s: and making sure that our growth rate
397.14s: makes sense for our skill set the head
399.18s: and the sand approach is super common
401.16s: it's when Traders they don't want to
402.96s: have a trading plan they don't want to
404.22s: be held accountable for what they're
405.36s: doing they don't want to be responsible
407.46s: for the outcomes they want to be able to
408.84s: blame things so they don't have a trade
409.86s: trading log and essentially we just go
411.84s: in circles because our ego prevents us
413.82s: from making good decisions and making
415.74s: sure that we're controlling things the
417.60s: problem with this is you're not going to
418.98s: gain any traction if you do not have a
420.78s: paper trading or if you do not have a
422.46s: trading plan and if you do not have a
424.02s: trading log that is documenting Your
426.36s: Capacity and your success in paper
428.04s: trading you are putting your head in the
430.38s: sand you're just hoping that you're
431.88s: going to figure out on the Fly because
433.14s: you do better under pressure or you
435.42s: perform better when you have skin in the
436.98s: game I'll tell you what I'm really
438.54s: thankful we don't say that in the Marine
440.16s: Corps that in order to prep for war you
443.64s: don't have to get shot to practice
445.20s: getting shot at and moving under
446.70s: pressure it's a really awful approach to
449.40s: high volatility scenarios and it
451.38s: includes trading so what you need to
453.78s: avoid is drawdowns what do I mean by
456.42s: that well there's a big problem with
458.64s: drawdowns take a look at this account I
460.80s: have a video that's going to come up
462.06s: soon but take a look at the Returns on
464.70s: this account does portfolio three over
467.16s: here they have a 30 return a negative 20
469.80s: 25 percent return than a 12 14 12
472.92s: returns by all accounts that's a pretty
475.56s: damn solid series of returns and it's an
477.72s: average return of 8.6 percent look at
480.36s: the compound annual growth rate look at
482.52s: the ending value they have an 8.6
484.86s: average average return a 6.87 kagger but
488.18s: 140k let's take a look at portfolio one
490.74s: 10 20 I'm sorry ten percent ten percent
493.50s: two percent ten percent five percent
495.06s: returns not one of these cracks even the
498.18s: lowest be the lowest positive return
500.28s: over here however the average return is
502.86s: seven point four percent it's less than
504.72s: the average return over here look at the
506.58s: compound annual growth rate Devin point
508.80s: three five percent compared to 6.87
511.14s: percent that means that on these smaller
513.54s: returns you have made more money than
516.90s: this person with a 1.2 percent better
519.96s: average return this is the impact of
523.26s: drawdowns the last thing I want to note
525.00s: here is the myopic approach this is a
528.12s: video or this is from a video I put out
530.22s: what last year on a rental property that
532.74s: I sold I made 263 263
536.46s: 000 and it was tax-free because of um
540.42s: capital gains tax on recently lived in
542.70s: properties there's different tax codes
543.96s: that apply to real estate but the point
545.70s: being is I made decent money trading
547.92s: however we can also make money in other
550.62s: endeavors and I cannot over emphasize
553.26s: how important it is to do that I do not
556.86s: just trade I am an angel investor I am
560.52s: also involved in residential and
562.32s: Commercial Real Estate beyond my
564.72s: investing stuff beyond the stuff I'm
566.94s: starting to do with YouTube you gotta
568.92s: find other ways to increase your income
571.32s: because if you increase your income when
574.56s: we look at the monthly contribution what
577.68s: you can save to then compound with the
580.20s: skill set you've developed that's where
582.06s: it comes from making more income so all
585.18s: in all rating can be incredibly
587.64s: lucrative I've done very well Trading
589.68s: have outperformed the market for the
591.72s: last 15 years running you can do well
594.24s: even still it is so important to have a
598.32s: holistic approach to your wealth
600.00s: development and for Traders that
602.04s: includes the concepts I outlined here so
604.50s: if you made it to end don't forget to
606.18s: like the video throw it down in the
607.56s: comments anything that stood out to you
609.18s: or anything that I missed from this list
611.40s: and until next time be an outlier see
613.26s: you later don't forget to subscribe
