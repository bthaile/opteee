0.88s: what up outliers quick market update I
2.76s: got two things on the agenda the first
4.48s: one quick look at the broad markets
6.40s: second thing GameStop earnings we got to
8.08s: see what's going on in there so let's
10.20s: Dive Right In today the market really
12.92s: was all over the place so if we actually
16.08s: jump into spy here we can use something
19.28s: like SPX and let's take a look at what
22.64s: it did in day so I want to look at today
26.04s: one and take a look at this started off
28.40s: a little bit of a gap up over yester
29.96s: yesterday then crashed Down based
32.16s: crashed down then rallied all the way up
34.04s: and out it really started catching wind
36.40s: kind of like 10 1010 and then it caught
39.36s: another breath of fresh air right at
40.64s: around 11 the reason why I know 11 is
42.52s: cuz I was just getting ready to place
43.84s: some trades and I saw it start running
46.48s: so I actually held off for a little bit
48.80s: and then kind of entered when it was
50.00s: basing in here but what this means for
53.52s: me is the market is still in this highly
57.84s: tenuous position I don't view this as
60.00s: Ultra bullish especially if you look at
62.92s: the S&P 500 the percentage of stocks
65.56s: that are above their 50-day moving
68.04s: averages it actually declined today
70.76s: meanwhile the S&P 500 was up today so
73.40s: what does that tell me it tells me that
74.72s: there was a handful of stocks that drove
77.44s: this movement and then if we take a look
79.04s: over at the cues we can see a lot of it
81.36s: came from the qes this is Tech really
84.76s: starting what I consider to be a really
87.84s: really important price movement and I'm
90.96s: going to zoom this out now just a little
92.72s: bit and show you what I'm talking about
95.00s: now in the analysis of a trend what we
97.96s: want to see is higher highs higher lows
100.68s: and so we have a low here we have a
102.60s: higher low here we have a higher low
104.52s: here and then we kind of hit this term
106.76s: high peak high for this time frame that
110.04s: we start falling off so then we create
112.16s: this low now this is a lower low
114.92s: compared to this compared to this but it
117.08s: maintains the broader trend for the time
119.96s: frame so now in my opinion this price
124.52s: level becomes quite important because if
128.20s: this starts to fall at or below this low
133.08s: that starts to confirm again in my
135.32s: opinion an actual
137.28s: downtrend and it still clearly is
139.68s: downtrending in a short-term time frame
141.64s: right so if we look something close to
143.52s: this you know again near-term high and
146.08s: we just draw a general trend line like
148.04s: clearly downward sloping but the in the
151.52s: way I'm looking at this is the market
153.16s: has a little bit of a decision to make
155.84s: and the reason why I'm cutting this
157.28s: candle off um is to kind of fit it with
160.40s: this other period this is overfitting
162.20s: this specific line from like a TA
164.48s: drawing perspective I don't really care
166.00s: it's not for that purpose it's just to
168.40s: show the broader Trend that we're seeing
171.44s: here where we are still getting slightly
174.40s: higher lows which is again important but
178.92s: this is
180.40s: really really delicate right now in my
182.16s: opinion so I'm keeping a really close
184.04s: eye I do not have a lot of tech exposure
185.92s: here yet I start to get interested in
188.88s: Tech if we start looking at stuff above
193.00s: uh I forgot that's a wrong tool let me
195.04s: grab trend line or price level I like it
199.12s: above there I start adding it to a
202.20s: closer watch list above here obviously I
204.32s: look at it every day but I I need to see
206.84s: how it behaves in here I need to see if
208.56s: it starts rallying up and challenging
211.40s: these zones that show like kind of
214.20s: lighter volume right so it's hitting
216.48s: right on this coming up right on this
218.88s: volume node has to cross up above that
221.36s: but then after that it's kind of smooth
222.68s: sailing as you could tell from the
223.96s: volume profile until you get up towards
225.60s: here so and that would be starting to
228.68s: you know resume a broader uptrend which
232.00s: again we just have to see how it behaves
233.92s: from a breath perspective I do see both
236.72s: things like the money flow index is
239.24s: positive sloping here and I see that the
242.68s: RSI is crossing over the EMA which is
246.88s: also good because it just indicates to
249.96s: me a a near-term change in momentum that
252.40s: you're kind of seeing going on here but
254.24s: we're still right around that kind of
255.76s: 50% level on the RSI so when it's
258.36s: hanging around there kind of in my
259.96s: opinion go either way but I like that it
262.84s: was well bought here and it's moving up
266.12s: on sub average volume for 25-day periods
270.00s: so yeah overall really interested to see
273.48s: where this goes I think this is again
276.28s: not a point to start throwing a bunch of
278.08s: money around for me at least the way
279.56s: that I trade I am heavily utilized but
282.20s: it's just not in stuff like Tech all
284.80s: right now let's get on to kind of the
287.04s: fun stuff which is obviously GameStop so
291.12s: GameStop reported earnings today and it
293.84s: closed at 2345 right now it's trading
295.96s: around 2160 so we're down about
300.76s: 10% don't I don't love that look
305.00s: but uh yeah I feel like there's so much
308.84s: that goes into this earnings release and
310.92s: so much of it I don't know so I don't
313.20s: actually feel comfortable speaking too
315.36s: heavily about like the broader context
317.76s: of Q2 and the way that the company
320.76s: typically performs but if we take a look
323.20s: at some of our prior earnings we can at
326.00s: least get an
327.28s: idea of how GameStop tends to behave
330.88s: which is generally inside right so as I
333.96s: look through this movement leading into
335.68s: earnings it was up at 46 then it came
337.76s: down to 28 this is obviously q1 which is
340.64s: a little bit of a busy time for gme here
344.28s: it came in at 155 came out at 13 so like
348.92s: this is generally standard fair from
350.84s: what I can tell from previous earnings
352.40s: releases but like the broader context
354.12s: behind it I'm not fully read into but
357.56s: when I looked through the financials it
360.36s: really didn't look bad to me so starting
363.68s: from the top here I was disappointed in
367.64s: that there was no statement or anything
371.12s: attached to it and again the community
372.80s: told me to expect that so I didn't have
374.36s: my hopes very high but I still really
376.56s: wanted to see them say something about
380.28s: having 4 billion in cash which is great
382.44s: it's really good that they have a bun in
384.76s: a bunch in cash but from an investor
387.76s: standpoint it's also like I want to know
390.40s: what the general idea is again I know
393.16s: that there's something to be said about
395.04s: keeping like a competitive Advantage by
397.36s: not necessarily forecasting all your
399.00s: moves and stuff like that like that
400.04s: makes sense I'm okay with that but I
402.88s: would just really really love if at the
405.60s: very least they would give us something
409.56s: we're looking to invest into the comp
411.76s: like literally any words associated with
414.76s: the cash pile that's sitting there would
416.36s: have been welcomed at least from my
418.04s: perspective to give some idea
420.52s: but let's go through this so net sales
422.76s: came in positive which was great
425.36s: 0.789 billion so positive is good
428.96s: although we obviously came down from the
433.08s: 1.64 we saw net income at 14.8 million
438.28s: which is super important because it was
441.76s: a loss year over year prior and in cash
446.40s: right now there's
448.52s: 4.24 billion so again they're sitting on
453.52s: a absolutely tremendous cash pile which
457.24s: is exciting but the excitement is
460.88s: slightly tempered for me right now just
462.84s: because I want to know what they're
464.88s: doing I want to know what's going on
466.80s: with this money so it's I say it
469.52s: partially in just because I do think
471.28s: Cohen is super smart way smarter than I
474.12s: am so I know that he's making the moves
476.40s: that he's making for a reason or at
477.72s: least that's what I assume so it doesn't
479.72s: bother me that much but I just want to
483.08s: know I just want to know so let's scroll
486.04s: through this a little bit so we can see
488.44s: net sales that came down a little bit I
490.92s: actually don't like to see that too much
493.28s: when we have sales Contracting and we
496.68s: can see that cost of sales C has come
499.04s: down pretty massively so net income came
503.12s: through pretty big time a big part of
505.80s: that obviously you can tell stemming
508.28s: from here where we have again much lower
513.76s: cost acquisition for sales operating
516.68s: loss has contracted pretty meaningfully
520.00s: so overall they they seem to be in a in
523.12s: a pretty good position now I don't know
527.88s: how this leads into followon earnings
531.24s: but what I can say is the net income per
534.20s: share is pretty impressive in this sense
536.64s: this is showing um four pennies
540.08s: so the other couple things I want to
542.56s: highlight let me see a little bit
544.60s: further
546.44s: down uh here so we can see uh cash and
551.04s: equivalent Securities merchandise
554.00s: inventories assets all of that
557.28s: essentially is about the same so
559.24s: merchandise inventories has come down a
561.32s: bit which I find slightly interesting
564.24s: but I also know that the company is
566.12s: trying to Pivot a lot and lean into its
568.72s: successful story stores and maybe start
571.20s: navigating a little bit away from its
573.04s: less successful stores which again is
574.68s: just really smart for a company that's
576.68s: in this perspective accounts payable has
578.88s: come down quite a bit from 378 to 220
583.28s: and liabilities
585.96s: about uh for long-term debt sorry for
589.12s: long-term debt is about static this I
591.36s: don't expect to see much change in this
593.08s: but if there is a change in this it
594.72s: typically tells me something's going on
596.48s: in a company but that's why I look at
598.52s: that and total liabilities is down as I
601.44s: think we generally expect so long-term
603.44s: net debt 12.4 versus
606.96s: 236 and total
610.88s: liabilities about the same call it
613.12s: relatively unchanged you can see stock
615.40s: holders Equity is moved from um 1267 to
621.52s: 4383 so yeah I think from a a company
626.04s: perspective like if I were uh like a
628.52s: value or a fundamental investor which
630.44s: again being completely honest with you
631.76s: guys I'm not I am a Trader but when I
633.84s: look at this I see a company that seems
636.36s: like it's in a decent position to start
639.56s: doing something but I also have to be
641.40s: honest like right now if I'm looking at
643.32s: this company I'm
644.48s: thinking it's not doing much that I can
647.04s: see like I'm not seeing a bunch of
649.20s: Capital Improvements massive plans
650.92s: coming out to expand the company pivot
652.56s: the company none of that and again my
654.60s: guess is Cohen probably has some ideas
657.24s: going on in the back end that you know
659.36s: he's probably just playing the game a
660.88s: little closer to his chest for you know
663.28s: whatever reasons he has but again from a
667.08s: Traders perspective it's kind of like I
668.92s: need to know why I would put my money
671.24s: somewhere and for something like this if
673.84s: you have really strong belief in Cohen
676.36s: the business the ability to Pivot then
678.16s: sure I totally get that but from again
680.72s: like an objective analysis standpoint
682.72s: based on just the numbers not the story
685.16s: not the qualitative components but just
687.24s: the numbers this looks relatively light
690.64s: it's obviously profitable to a degree
693.04s: it's sitting on a literally War chest of
696.12s: cash but as I continue to remind people
699.00s: we we have to do something with the cash
701.32s: because cash just sitting there really
703.04s: it doesn't help us very much cash needs
705.64s: to be used to drive business so
707.40s: hopefully and again that's my underlying
709.52s: assumption they're just not ready to
710.84s: share it yet there's a plan for this
712.96s: cash
714.52s: so we can
716.56s: see sale from property and Equipment
719.12s: right right so we're starting to unwind
720.68s: things which we knew is going on
722.84s: marketable Securities came down
726.00s: massively
728.72s: and let's see yeah so huge cash flow
732.92s: essentially came from this segment in
734.88s: here and a big part of it was decreasing
738.04s: marketable security purchases right so
740.24s: going from 313 to 75 so that's why this
744.20s: is so advantageous is essentially down
746.24s: to this line item
749.52s: repayments of debt about the same not a
752.92s: big change
754.52s: there uh financing activities right we
756.84s: already know about all that so cash
759.52s: equivalence
761.56s: 4.2 yeah so I mean it's just it's a lot
764.96s: of money to sit on this this is what
769.56s: yeah like I didn't love this so Hardware
772.56s: accessory sales down so net sales here
776.40s: 597 here 451
779.24s: software also down Collectibles also
782.28s: down so net sales from these again like
787.28s: I just I don't love
790.68s: that and it's the same thing from like
794.60s: the 26 we period versus a 13we period
797.28s: right so this is giving you a slightly
799.76s: different comparison
802.56s: window I don't love that because I would
805.68s: want to see sales moving again it's
807.68s: still positive which is good but again
810.16s: from like an objective analysis
811.96s: standpoint this this reiterates to me
815.20s: more so than ever something needs to
817.44s: happen and again it's also important to
819.60s: remember this is why we compare
821.80s: typically um different time frames right
823.96s: so this is looking 13 weeks 26 weeks it
825.80s: gives you different snapshots that cover
828.36s: different time periods so sales is
831.20s: positive which is great and I know that
833.00s: there's a new console thing coming up uh
835.00s: I think it's for PlayStation again you
836.60s: guys would know better than I would on
837.96s: that I would defer to you
839.88s: but I'm not a PlayStation guy I I like
841.76s: Xbox I've I've had that I used to have
843.64s: PlayStation when I was a little kid I
844.88s: remember playing like Gran Turismo on
846.40s: there but we got away from PlayStation
848.28s: pretty quick I don't remember why maybe
849.88s: it was Halo moved us over to Xbox with I
852.96s: remember the Duke remember the Duke
855.44s: controller this absolutely massive
858.44s: controller so as I look through this I'm
861.56s: interested it doesn't look bad but it
865.00s: also doesn't look like this is obviously
867.00s: a company that's currently outperforming
868.72s: I think
869.64s: that's not necessarily a news spash so
872.04s: for me after looking through the
873.40s: financials and again continuing to get
875.24s: closer to the product I think a big part
877.60s: of this is just seeing where really
880.12s: where we go from here we're at a spot I
883.84s: don't want to call it make or break CU I
885.56s: think that's a little dramatic I think
887.24s: that the company definitely has a decent
889.12s: Runway to figure things out but I don't
893.52s: think that this in and of itself is the
897.96s: you know winner of the day right we've
899.72s: known that it's had four billing cash
901.28s: for months now so the question is what
904.80s: do we do with it then the other question
906.52s: I have is I do like some video games but
909.40s: I have absolutely no idea what I'm
911.32s: looking at up here so if anybody can
913.52s: help me out with what the winged it
915.92s: almost looks like a it looks like a
917.20s: Deadpool fairy to me cuz this looks like
919.56s: a Deadpool Mask they have a sword and
923.36s: then they have wings and then these
926.00s: remind me of
929.64s: Harvesters from I forgot what game has
932.28s: Harvesters maybe Gears of War I played
934.68s: that a while ago with a buddy that was
936.44s: kind of a
937.60s: strange strange forray anyways don't
940.08s: know what this stuff is would love to
941.32s: know so now though there is one other
944.12s: interesting piece of information I look
946.96s: through the options chain somebody is
949.20s: probably going to be a little bit sad
950.84s: with these 9924 calls for
954.36s: $28,000 that's not looking great and
957.40s: that's for this Friday so we don't love
960.60s: that for them unless they're part of
963.88s: like a a spread but what I have this
966.28s: filtered by right now is um I I care
969.24s: about single leg trades so I get rid of
972.28s: spreads from the filtering but here's
974.48s: the other thing that I can't help but
977.28s: find
978.36s: interesting is if we take a look at
983.52s: GameStop and if we take a look
986.84s: restricting trade size to 5,000
992.04s: and we look at the last couple days we
995.08s: see these blocks of 5,000 rolling in
998.88s: again now what I find interesting about
1001.92s: the blocks of 5,000 today were that it
1005.12s: was kind of throughout the entire day
1007.52s: whereas when we see these blocks of
1009.04s: 5,000 yesterday it was much more
1012.04s: short-lived there was a couple touches
1014.32s: 0650 0655 this is Pacific Time 07 then
1018.44s: we see these eight 0840 transactions
1021.76s: which I have these earmarked as
1023.76s: something I'm keeping an eye on I see
1025.96s: only one 0840 transaction today and then
1028.80s: a bunch of like 09
1031.08s: 010s or I'm sorry not uh 09 then 10 11s
1036.32s: 12 so it's kind of like throughout the
1037.44s: rest of the afternoon and then if we go
1039.56s: back further though we can see that
1041.56s: these 5,000 blocks have been happening
1043.96s: for some time now so based on the 9th
1048.12s: based on the sixth the fourth the fourth
1051.24s: again the third the 30th of last month
1055.32s: like there's lots of blocks of 5,000 the
1057.72s: reason why I want to highlight highlight
1059.48s: that is because I know a lot of people
1060.80s: think that from roaring Kitty's previous
1064.64s: options trades which we're going to dive
1066.24s: further into this coming gme live stream
1069.64s: this coming Saturday because last
1071.36s: Saturday we got into the weeds and I
1073.92s: learned a lot but one of the things is I
1077.36s: think people just kind of naturally
1079.00s: attribute this size trade to him because
1081.08s: of the options that he came into but I
1083.32s: actually I don't see that obviously he
1086.24s: doesn't have a monopoly on the size of
1088.76s: 5,000 it's a nice round number tons of
1092.08s: people would transact there and I'm not
1094.92s: saying it's it's not him in the near
1096.84s: term I have no idea but what I'm
1098.72s: highlighting is just that it's not
1100.92s: relegated to him as you know solo
1103.88s: fingerprint unique to him and only him
1106.76s: that's all as always my goal is to try
1109.60s: and analyze information as objectively
1112.20s: as possible I have all sorts of crazy
1114.80s: theories that's literally why I have a
1116.76s: tinfoil hat that I'll throw on when I
1118.80s: want to get weird and start throwing
1120.72s: opinions out there but when I'm looking
1122.52s: at this I'm just trying to analyze data
1124.76s: interpret it as a Trader which is again
1128.12s: what I primarily do so there is buildout
1131.24s: going on though and there's a lot of
1132.52s: these 5,000 block contracts but it's not
1135.08s: to be honest like there there's way
1136.76s: bigger trades going on right now so if
1139.08s: we kill that 5,000 size requirement and
1142.24s: we sort this by premium like there's
1145.04s: literally a 2 million trade that ran
1149.04s: through this is looking at the dark pool
1150.88s: by the way for 933 there's a
1154.12s: 79,000 for 186 mil so it's like there's
1157.56s: big trades going and the reason why I
1159.16s: highlight that is because it tells us
1161.24s: that there's liquidity right there's not
1163.72s: in the options Market to fill those
1166.88s: contracts at $5,000 Lots like that's a
1169.56s: pretty big options trade because
1171.04s: obviously there's 100 shares per but
1173.08s: that's just for relative size it's
1176.36s: larger 5,000 for an options Market but
1178.72s: what I'm seeing here is that if the
1180.80s: order goes to the lit exchange through a
1182.88s: dark pool and then obviously hits the
1184.88s: Consolidated tape there's still tons of
1188.08s: liquidity here right so we're seeing you
1190.44s: know just blocks of 10,000 move around
1194.36s: like it's nothing not moving the market
1196.56s: that are being executed all together and
1200.00s: then again we see blocks almost up to
1202.36s: 100,000 so it just tells me that there's
1205.36s: liquidity here and for whatever reason
1208.48s: the I don't know the process of
1210.76s: submitting like repetitive 5,000 lot
1214.36s: trades is kind of interesting to me
1217.52s: because I would think of it from an
1218.80s: efficiency standpoint of what why why
1220.84s: bother doing that if you can simply get
1223.80s: a much bigger price now it would make
1225.88s: more sense to me if these 5,000 lot
1228.72s: contracts were being done day over day
1232.76s: that I would get because it's like
1234.60s: you're scaling into something right so
1236.64s: you're buying your 5,000 on the 9th then
1238.76s: you buy 5,000 on the 10th and you kind
1240.80s: of dollar cost average into something
1243.24s: over time but that's not exactly what I
1247.24s: see here oh it's my brother calling in
1248.92s: case you guys don't know in my phone his
1250.64s: name is Sasquatch because he's a he's a
1253.12s: big old boy but shout out to you
1256.08s: Sasquatch anyways back to this
1259.40s: there's a lot of these going on some of
1261.76s: them that happen within really tight
1263.40s: time frames like this lead me to believe
1265.56s: it's the same person but the fact that
1267.88s: this happens across the entire day is
1271.28s: confusing and makes me more likely to
1273.96s: believe that this isn't a single person
1276.44s: but likely different groups of people or
1279.12s: different entities don't know who that
1281.48s: are transacting at you know their set
1283.12s: prices but when you look at these and
1284.52s: you find blocks of time where it's like
1286.44s: right around one another like super like
1288.60s: within seconds super close time frame
1291.00s: that like this right here right 707 710
1294.92s: 732 like that's all right on top of one
1297.28s: another so could that be three different
1299.68s: people that entered in order right
1301.28s: around the same time sure it could but
1303.68s: again when I see it in this tight of a
1305.44s: compression at that exact size I
1307.92s: typically believe that this might be one
1310.40s: person but don't know that is the
1314.08s: Mystique and mystery of trying to play
1316.16s: this puzzle and piece things together
1317.84s: with this kind of it's just so fun an
1321.00s: absolute blast I really really enjoy it
1323.48s: um and a couple people were asking about
1326.56s: when Newton and I we going to do another
1328.20s: live stream I actually just hit him up
1331.44s: yesterday and he he and I were we're
1334.32s: going to look for a time so we don't
1336.20s: know if it's going to be able to be a
1337.76s: live stream but the dude's working like
1339.20s: a dog right now and he's trying to you
1342.04s: know maintain his Cadence with his
1344.20s: videos and stuff so it's just
1345.28s: challenging for him but like I said we
1347.44s: we text most days so we'll we'll find
1350.92s: something eventually whether it's a live
1352.48s: stream which I obviously really enjoy
1354.40s: doing with you all that would be my
1356.00s: preference but I also understand that
1357.80s: you know live streams are difficult
1359.12s: timing for him so he and I might do
1361.16s: something recorded together in the
1362.56s: morning early morning so that it
1364.64s: accommodates his schedule we'll figure
1367.44s: something out but yeah looking forward
1369.44s: to connecting with him again because we
1370.72s: have a we have a lot to catch up on as
1372.88s: this thing continues to evolve so yeah
1375.00s: just following up I forgot who dropped
1376.52s: that as a comment yesterday but I wanted
1378.68s: to follow up with them so that wraps me
1381.28s: up as always let me know if there's
1382.92s: anything you want me to cover anything
1384.48s: we should take a look at being an
1385.44s: outlier I'll see you all later
