0.00s: the market doesn't always do what we want. If you're
4.08s: anything like me actually most of the time it does
6.24s: is the exact opposite kind of makes things
8.08s: difficult. The goal of the video for today is to
10.88s: walk you through in advanced rolling technique for
14.80s: options. Now I have a bunch of videos that go through the
18.32s: ins and outs of what rolling is the basics, the
21.12s: accounting, all that stuff will throw links to that in
23.52s: the notes below. So we won't waste any time on it, but
27.04s: I want to pick up from one of the really interesting
30.32s: elements of an option. Now we're a quick recap for those that
35.36s: might need to refresh. A roll is super simple. You have trade one.
39.36s: This is an opening trade. You have trade two. This is a closing trade.
45.84s: And then you have trade three which is an opening trade. So
50.08s: effectively what's happening during a roll is you are
52.88s: opening a trade and then you are closing it. This
55.68s: realizes the position. Now this can be for a profit or a loss
61.52s: depending on if you made a loss money. And then the concept of a
65.04s: roll is we're opening another trade that's tied to this
69.68s: prior trade. And this is essentially what rolling
73.84s: amounts to be. You have a realized P&L from this portion of the
77.04s: trade. Now you have a new open trade with an unrealized P&L.
83.20s: And a really important note, I was actually just having this
86.08s: conversation with somebody in the comment section,
89.44s: is that this realized P&L will hit your net liquidating value.
95.20s: And then your unopened P&L, the credit that you receive, your net
100.08s: liquidating value is hunch. So your net lick is hunch, meaning it doesn't
104.72s: change, but you will have that credit in your cash and sweep.
110.40s: The reason why this is so important is because of longer duration
115.12s: rolls and how your account can erode in net lick, which at some point
121.12s: can lead to your cash and sweep not being large enough or your
125.12s: margin requirement exceeding your cash and sweep or your net
128.56s: lick, which leads to either trading on margin margin calls again.
132.00s: We have a couple of videos in the notes that we'll talk through this.
135.12s: So let's use a recent trade, actually, that I did this exact
139.52s: technique I'm going to talk to you about. And again, the way to think
144.08s: about rolling is it's just a series of traits. There are no rules.
149.92s: So one of the things that I like to do is let's say up here in
154.40s: T-TripleQs that I had sold to open puts. And then as it goes down,
160.32s: I buy to close those puts and then I sell to open new puts,
165.84s: trying to adjust my basis. And then it keeps going down.
170.88s: Well sooner or later you might find yourself assigned.
178.16s: Or an alternate scenario is you actually just bought to open shares.
184.40s: Up here. So we have shares. Now, at some point during this, you might say to yourself,
191.52s: well, if I hold shares, there's only a couple of ways I can effectively adjust the basis of my
199.04s: shares. The first one is to buy. The second is to sell more shares.
205.36s: That's effectively how you change your basis if you hold shares. So what I'm highlighting here is that
211.12s: your cost basis is static, not dynamic. One of the cool part about this rolling scenario is
218.72s: my basis here might be 80. And then as we're going down, I might be able to get my basis down to
225.04s: 77, right? So my basis just changed three points. Effective, useful. So I have a mobile basis.
234.00s: Now again, there's tradeoffs to everything. The tradeoff here is that if for whatever reason,
238.64s: the underlying decides to start skyrocketing up, you have to be pretty on top of your game
243.92s: to either buy back in or so on and so forth. We'll talk more about it. Now, I want to talk about
250.64s: now a really uncommon approach to rolling an option. And it's very different than what a lot of
258.72s: people will talk about. But it's effectively taking your first trade from shares or whenever you
264.64s: end up with shares. So again, trade one is going to be long shares. Trade two is going to be
276.16s: sell to close the shares sell to open puts. So we're effectively moving from asset classes. We're
288.40s: moving from shares into puts. Now, how does this work? It's actually really, really simple.
296.56s: It's taking the concepts of rolling, which again, is just taking different trades and tying
304.24s: the accounting together for the trades. That's literally what you can do to move between shares,
311.12s: options, options, shares. And this is to lean into the benefits of both because if you're an
317.68s: option trader, you shouldn't always just bucket yourself into only trading options. There can be
322.88s: points where trading some of these other things can be really, really effective. So in the concept
328.88s: in this case, we don't know that this part of the market happens. Right. So this entire side of the
336.00s: chart get rid of it. Pretend you're still back where the tariffs are coming out. The tariffs are
341.20s: bad. It looks like the tariffs might have some sort of give. And then they don't have any give
347.04s: in the rest of the world is starting to say, well, we're going to have retaliatory tariffs. So the
351.52s: news is bad. And the depth of this is completely unknown. So in this case, it was a real trade
360.56s: where at this point, I had 800 shares. This is part of the model covered triangle portfolio. If you've
367.68s: been following that series and teach teach real cues and other ETFs. But I had 800 shares of
374.00s: TQs at a basis of 64.3. Now, if you'll notice down here, we hit a low of 35. So what ends
385.44s: up happening is as your basis. So let's say that this is share price on a scale. Let's say that
394.32s: this is us with our basis of 64.3. If the equity is still trading around this rate, we're going to
404.80s: range. It's no problem. We can still sell calls that we're going to get a decent credit. We
410.00s: don't have to go super far out of the money and those kinds of things. However, if the equity
415.60s: starts to go down here into the 40s, well, now there's a big difference between these. And if I choose
423.60s: to sell calls, if I want to collect anything resembling a decent premium, it's going to have to
429.28s: be below my basis, which puts me in at risk. Now, again, it's not the worst risk on earth. There are
435.60s: things you can do to manage it. But nonetheless, it's a risk that has to be managed because the
441.04s: scenario here is if it rallies super hard like this and you have these short calls below your
445.76s: basis, you can get stuck. Now, on the short call side of things have to sell below your basis.
449.60s: It's a whole other problem to have. So what I ended up doing was saying, well, I don't want to deal
455.84s: with that part of the equation. And I didn't want to bother holding the shares of T-Triple
461.92s: cues, and I'll show you a specific reason why it's because of this. Now, I know it's a little
468.48s: blurring, it's just a screenshot. But what I want you to pay attention to is this is showing you the
473.36s: price of price performance year to date of QQQQ. And today is the 20th of May and you can see QQQ
480.16s: is up 1.2%. Great. However, you can see T-Triple cues is down 12%. This is volatility to K. So this is why
489.76s: I'm disinterested in holding the shares as it's plummeting this way. You can choose to dollar
495.52s: cost average and stuff like that. Again, there's a lot of different ways to manage it. But I chose
502.00s: this route instead. All I did was sell to close my shares and I closed them when TQQs was
514.08s: trading around, let me see, 41.95. So this realizes a loss of 17,880.
532.00s: So what do you notice? If we go back to the basic concept of rolling, well, here's trade one
541.28s: technically, it wasn't just 800 shares at 64. It was averaged in, but we'll just call it trade one.
546.64s: Then here's trade two. So what comes next in a row? Right three. Get into the options.
552.56s: And that's exactly what I did. And we'll take a look at the options position now in the way that I
558.56s: thought about getting into that options position. So if we hide this and we jump over
567.20s: here, this was effectively where T-Triple cues was. I'll update this 41.95. And this little
578.00s: unassignment trackers super easy to build. You can tell you literally only need six inputs.
584.08s: Let me zoom this in so it's a little easier for you to follow along. Hopefully that's maybe
588.88s: we'll go a little further than that. We're going to do honey. There you go. Even if you're visually
593.04s: disenclined, this should meet your need. So you can see that we have the current spot price at the time.
599.52s: This was on the seventh of April. Fun fact, literally completely bottom-ticked it perfectly.
605.04s: Seventh April, this is where I exit at the stock, of course. Going back to the beginning of the video.
610.16s: Rarely goes the way that you want such as the life of a trader. So I exit there.
616.32s: And the reason why I exit there is because for the coverage triangle, I was using about as much
620.88s: as I wanted to use because you never know how far T-Triple cues is going to go down. So at this point,
625.68s: I wanted to gain that spot price sensitivity through the vector I told you by having a very
630.88s: variable basis super important. So then I told you the basis for the shares already was 6430.
638.56s: It was 800 shares. So it means that I originally spent 51-4440. And I at the time of closing
647.36s: ended up realizing them where their value was 33-560. So if I reorder this so it's a little
655.28s: easier to follow along with the math for those that might not find the super intuitive,
662.32s: I'm essentially realizing that P&L of 1780. So then what I did is I moved into options.
672.00s: So on the seventh of April, I went out to the two May 63's. So the first thing to note is
680.48s: take a look at my basis here's 6430 and I was able to get into the 63's. Those are still
686.40s: deep in the money. The Delta on those was an 82 Delta super deep in the money. The premium I
692.16s: collected on that was $21. Now notice what I can do. I can literally do the math and I can say
700.00s: how many do I need to sell at these details? Well really these two details in order to cover this loss.
709.52s: This is the idea of rolling for a credit. So all I did was say in order to cover this loss,
717.28s: I really would need to have sold nine. Well you can't do parcels and so that's why it would be nine.
722.72s: However, I chose to sell eight and it was to manage more of the portfolio because again,
730.96s: I have it with the specific allocation. So if I add another hundred shares for the sake of just
736.32s: covering this loss, it can put me in a disadvantage position in case it keeps crashing. Again,
740.80s: at this point we don't know what's going on. So I went with eight lots. The reason why I did this
746.64s: is because I actually am able to reduce some of the basis on the trade because as you can see,
756.24s: the original cost to get into the trade was 5140 and that was to get 800 units. Don't worry about
762.32s: the basis of the units, 800 shares of TQs. So then in this case, I'm able to stay at 800 shares
770.08s: of TQs. I'm able to reduce my basis 6430 to 63, which is where that basis reduction comes from
780.88s: that you see in the trade. So the original cash secured put requirement is here and then you can see
787.68s: where we landed. We don't need as much money from the original outlay because it's at a cheaper basis.
794.72s: So the whole point in doing this is to give us room to adjust the trade.
801.20s: So then what happens? The net P&L for all of this. I take those shares down for 17,880.
810.00s: I can calculate the total credit I received here is 16,800. So I would be walking out with the net
816.00s: P&L of down 180 bucks. So this doesn't fully cover the cost of that trade. It's not perfect.
823.36s: But I chose to accept this small loss in the beginning with the full intent of doing other activity
830.64s: to get the position back where it needed to be like it is today. However, at this time, by not adding
836.80s: that additional loss. Because again, if I add that additional lot, you'll see this becomes a positive number.
842.32s: And we're in the black and if we're not super deep in the money running out of capital for
847.52s: utilization out of the total allocation, we can do this. But in this case, preparing for a bigger drawdown,
854.24s: what I'm doing now is moving myself back into options and out of shares.
861.12s: Because then let's say, T-TripleCue's did continue going down. Now what we can do is follow the rest
869.44s: of our standard rolling protocols with dynamic lot sizing. So if we take a look at the hypothetical
876.64s: scenario, this now is pretending time is passed. So the seventh of April is when we got into this
882.96s: trade that you see listed here. And we're pretending now it's the 18th of May. And let's say rather
889.52s: than it rallying back up the market continued down. And TQs was now at 35. What I can do is because
898.32s: I didn't burn that extra lot here, I can bake it into my new trade, increase my lot size by one point,
906.56s: so that I can try and reduce my basis. So notice we started in this hypothetical at the basis of
913.28s: 6430. The only got the basis to 63. Now what the basis says 63, if it continues going against this,
920.00s: we might be able to get it down to 61 or better, something like that. And this is the process of having
926.64s: a dynamic position in using roles to move in and out of different assets to end yourself in a
934.32s: better position so that even though today, as I showed you, T triple Qs is still down 12%, my
942.08s: covered strangle is up money. And it's from doing stuff like this. Do you have any questions? Let me know
948.16s: be an outlier. See you later.
