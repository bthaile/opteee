0.88s: what's up outliers quick General market
3.52s: update then I want to talk about P NW
6.60s: and then we'll take a look at GameStop
7.84s: so let's get right into it what happened
10.04s: today well a slight down day the first
13.12s: one that we've seen in a little while
15.88s: now for the S&P 500 for the q's and for
18.84s: the Russell it's still the weakest of
20.80s: the bunch by far so I'm seeing a few
23.68s: things as you could tell the red volume
26.52s: which is the sale volume is definitely
28.68s: ticking up here and we're still seeing
31.64s: volume Contracting so what's to be
35.68s: derived from that as per usual don't
38.24s: know just yet but it is kind of
41.92s: confirmation to me that this isn't
44.84s: necessarily a straight v-shaped recovery
48.56s: from low to high does this mean that we
51.60s: start transacting sideways a little bit
54.04s: that would not surprise me at all and
55.64s: it's because as you could tell for
57.92s: specifically the cues we've just bumped
60.04s: to the point of control a lot of people
61.52s: are wanting to transact there for
63.56s: something like the Russell it just can't
65.44s: catch a big bid it is struggling here
68.48s: and we still have the S&P 500
71.12s: outperforming to the upside so the other
74.32s: thing I noticed from a broader
76.08s: perspective is the variant R premiums
78.68s: here have been
80.12s: contracting pretty meaningfully
82.20s: interestingly enough for the 30-day vs
84.68s: in the S&P 500 which I find curious but
87.64s: it's not surprising with the Vex being
89.52s: so suppressed here it did catch a little
92.36s: bit of a bid today so I'm already out of
95.36s: my fade vix position and I'm reloaded
98.48s: always looking to get back into that as
99.88s: soon as the time looks good but right
101.96s: now vix is so low this is not somewhere
104.36s: that I personally would look to fade it
106.44s: so broad Market fascinating what's going
109.28s: on here it's still making this really
111.88s: aggressive recovery we're seeing net
114.36s: highs lows for the NASDAQ turning
116.72s: positive and maintaining positive
119.12s: whereas for iwm they've been positive
121.32s: for a while and we're just not seeing
124.20s: the strong continuation that's being
126.16s: seen in large cap stocks so right now
130.52s: I'm still positioned long Market in
132.44s: general and I have both long Futures in
137.12s: The e- Minis and then I still have the
138.72s: tle q's position that I'm actually
140.28s: starting to pair down and that position
143.48s: will morph a little bit likely rotate
146.44s: that into Nasdaq futures in the not so
150.32s: distant future the reason why I'm using
152.08s: the three times is because when you get
153.88s: these really strong persistent one- day
156.48s: one directional moves that compounding
158.88s: of a three times daily return is
160.52s: actually pretty lucrative but for
162.88s: General carry positions futures or the
164.80s: indices themselves are typically fairly
166.80s: effective so I'm agnostic to which of
169.20s: those I'll end up rotating into but for
171.04s: something like T I have no problem
172.96s: holding it for some time but it's not
174.60s: something that I would just close my
175.80s: eyes and hold forever and it's just
178.00s: because I I'm not really interested in
180.28s: going through the full cycle that it can
182.32s: present to you which can be pretty nasty
184.72s: even recently it's gone from 85 down to
186.92s: 48 just a big move and unfortunately
189.96s: there's no tax advantage for something
191.48s: like tle Q's whereas if you're trading
193.00s: the indices themselves which the NASDAQ
195.24s: index is super illiquid the option so I
197.88s: don't trade that um but the NASDAQ
201.12s: futures are kind of the next best choice
203.08s: there so that's probably what I will
205.96s: rotate into so now let's take a quick
208.92s: look at just the market events for today
210.80s: cuz not a ton went down the 20th was
213.28s: really quiet we had a couple fed
214.76s: speakers tomorrow is when it starts to
217.12s: get a little more interesting so we have
218.32s: the FED meeting minutes which I think is
220.28s: going to be a slightly bigger deal now
222.44s: the other thing I wanted to pull up
223.64s: really quick is
226.16s: pnw and Pao networks just had a a banger
230.36s: of an earnings it was estimated at 0.768
233.92s: came in at 151 uh moderate Gap up but a
237.44s: big up move on the day so this starts to
241.20s: look attractive from a post earnings
243.92s: announcement drift style play to the
245.84s: upside so I established a small position
249.64s: on the Gap up expecting a continuation
252.64s: and essentially the way that I'll run
254.68s: this is I haven't decided if I'm going
256.68s: to have a hard stop right here and keep
258.84s: it really really speculative meaning
261.16s: high probability of being stopped out or
263.08s: if I want to give it a little more room
265.00s: to run and take it down below these lows
267.72s: I actually have that for an action item
269.92s: to to figure out and kind of dial it in
272.44s: it's one of those two but I just need to
274.32s: see which one fits with the broader
276.00s: portfolio better and then near-term
279.20s: Target I want to see it break Above This
282.08s: volume node that you see here on the one
284.48s: year we moved this into a six-month it's
286.56s: kind of like this big chunky block but
289.60s: there's just not a lot of overhead
291.20s: resistance here so this looks like a
294.36s: interesting run out play to me but you
296.44s: can see that on a relative volue time
299.36s: frame it's hundreds of percents
301.52s: magnitude over 20day 10day 5day just big
304.48s: big volume expansion the last couple
306.00s: days around earnings so this just looks
308.32s: generally interesting to me and then the
310.60s: last one gme and then for those that
313.24s: don't know we have a live stream today
315.80s: at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time and we'll go
317.80s: through really whatever you guys want to
319.16s: talk about but the Market's a little
320.88s: more in depth as we get closer to that
323.24s: but a couple things stick out to me here
324.92s: in GameStop the first thing little bit
327.24s: of a down day and I do notice that on
329.80s: the down day one of the the pieces I've
332.28s: been really really interested to see is
334.72s: what does the volume look like on a down
336.76s: day versus an up day and I was actually
338.48s: pleasantly surprised that the volume was
340.84s: pretty light today so the volume
343.40s: yesterday was 4.5 million the volume
345.08s: today is 3.5 so a little bit of a down
347.96s: day is okay again because the Russell's
350.16s: down so essentially the broader index
352.08s: that it's tied to is down now I'm glad
355.64s: that there wasn't a really aggressive
357.48s: increase in pressure but there's just
360.56s: not much going on here right like again
362.20s: like I'm not here to church things up
364.28s: I'm not here to try to make things
365.68s: better than they are or worse than they
367.08s: are I'm trying to look at it as
369.04s: objectively as I can it's just not much
370.80s: is going on here we've had a decent move
373.24s: to be clear like this is essentially
374.84s: taking something from 19 to 22 that's
377.76s: that's not nothing of a move but it's
379.60s: nothing I'm excited about for sure and
383.16s: it's kind of still maintaining this just
386.00s: consolidation Trend we can see this
387.64s: volume note continues to get get built
389.88s: out further and further and it's just
392.16s: because we're running essentially
393.44s: sideways so this looks interesting
395.36s: because it's kind of like Contra to what
397.72s: I'm seeing in chewy leading into chewy
400.72s: earnings so going into chewy earnings
402.84s: again down day across the the general
406.00s: smaller cap midcap universe so this
408.00s: doesn't surprise me but you can see
409.28s: leading into earnings it's been kind of
411.52s: aggressively moving up on a relative
413.44s: basis going from 20 to now closing today
416.44s: at 26 so a slightly different tenor in
419.84s: the style of move is what I'm seeing
422.08s: here now from an options perspective we
426.20s: saw a pretty significant buildout in the
429.60s: oi so if we look at the volume there's
431.32s: only 87,000 calls transacted against
433.64s: 16,000 puts so light for GameStop
437.16s: standards open interest is still very
439.68s: light for GameStop standards but it's
441.40s: already essentially at 2 to one for
443.64s: calls to puts so people are putting on
445.96s: more put positions I'm sorry more call
449.12s: positions then put positions which I do
451.76s: find interesting and the other more
453.44s: interesting part here is notice how it's
456.64s: not centralized in this front expiration
460.16s: this is still new this is an anomaly in
463.12s: GameStop from when I first started
464.48s: tracking the product it's not even in
466.60s: the 30 Aug it's not even in the 6ep it's
469.52s: all over the place but you can
471.20s: definitely see 18 October which is the
473.64s: green boxes definitely large and in
476.52s: charge it has a dominant presence so
479.60s: that I find very curious the fact that
483.44s: these 18 on expirations which is 60 days
486.32s: out is starting to get so active in
488.72s: terms of depth of open interest now the
492.96s: other thing I do want to knowe is for
495.88s: the earnings which again is still coming
498.08s: up on the 4th before the open and V is
502.88s: like going down it's crazy V has been so
506.88s: strange for this earnings release I'm
509.52s: still bullish involve for six but it's a
513.24s: little too far out still for me to play
514.96s: it although I do intend to as it gets a
516.68s: little bit closer but I would expect
519.20s: this VA to start guiding up a little bit
521.76s: as we're coming into earning so the fact
523.20s: that this has been so light has been
525.12s: really really interesting to me and last
526.84s: thing I want to show you is just from
528.04s: our friends over at unusual Wales which
530.44s: I do have a discount code for you guys
532.60s: if you're interested I do get some sort
534.36s: of commission I actually have no idea
535.56s: what it is but just in case you like the
538.60s: tool otherwise I'll show it to you right
540.48s: here and what I'm seeing is just light
543.56s: volume right so I see 100,000 100,000
546.80s: 100,000 100,000 and that's kind of split
549.84s: between calls at the bid calls at the
551.96s: offer and puts at the bid so there's not
555.96s: a bunch of big trades coming through
558.64s: right now which kind of Falls in line
560.60s: with the broader picture I was just
562.00s: explaining that things seem generally
564.92s: quiet so as you know your boy keeping a
568.04s: close eye on it but
569.92s: I don't have really anything significant
571.76s: to report right now IV percentile is
574.40s: insanely low for GameStop so it is just
578.92s: a function of keep an eye on it and
583.00s: we'll see we'll see what it does as
584.68s: always any questions or anything that
585.84s: you want me to take a look at let me
586.96s: know I'll see you guys at the live
588.16s: session later today be not liar
