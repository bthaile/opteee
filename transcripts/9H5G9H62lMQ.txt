0.00s:  What's up outliers? Welcome to outlier trading tips. We're in five minutes or less. You will have some knowledge to walk away with today. We're going to talk about whether or not options are zero sum.
13.00s:  This is actually a really important conversation specifically not for the pedantic side of things, but for the implications and you'll see what I'm talking about.
22.00s:  So what is a zero sum system? It's a situation in which whatever one entity gains another entity loses.
34.00s:  So if we think about options in that context, let's start with a scenario. If I buy a call and the stock goes up, this seller loses money.
48.00s:  So we can visualize this if we go into the platform and we take a look at the selling side of a call. They obviously will have lost money.
60.00s:  So let's now take a look at the implication of a zero sum game. The reason why zero sum games are so important in the context of their implication is because especially in markets where we're interacting with a lot of really smart entities with a lot of information and a lot of powerful resources.
79.00s:  If we are playing a true zero sum game, then we would be led to believe that the other side of our trade knows something that we don't otherwise why would they sell the option to us.
97.00s:  So let's take for example, if I knew stock XYZ was going to go up tomorrow, I knew it.
105.00s:  And let's say everybody then knew it. Same time we all know the stocks going to go up.
111.00s:  We would take the other side of that trade. Nobody because it's a known losing proposition.
118.00s:  However, markets are a little more complex than this. So what if the seller delta hedged their position.
128.00s:  So let's say as soon as they sold their option, they went out and they bought the Delta equivalent of offsetting the delta.
137.00s:  But if the seller of that option is actually a retail trader that sold that call against long shares that are already in profit, would that also be a consideration.
149.00s:  Now, here's the reality. When we look at options, individual option contracts, they absolutely are zero sum, meaning one side is going to win.
160.00s:  One side is going to lose for the contract itself. However, if we focus too much on that pedantic component of options themselves individual transactions, then we lose the true importance of a zero sum system, which is again this implication that we talked about here.
178.00s:  So the reality is options as a practice options trading as a practice is not zero sum.
186.00s:  So let's take a look at this zero sum perspective. If again, I sell this call and in this case, Nvidia goes up, obviously the trade loses.
196.00s:  But what if I already have, let's say 200 shares of Nvidia and let's say Nvidia goes up.
204.00s:  Do I lose? Oh, I made money. Now again, for the general point, that option that short call absolutely will have lost.
213.00s:  But my motivation for putting that short call on might not actually be because I think the stock is going down.
222.00s:  It could be part of a broader system that I'm trading. In this case, a ratio covered call and the ratio component of that is you know is very important, the not cap the upside potential.
232.00s:  So going back to this, this is the most important part of this conversation, the implications, the implication of a zero sum system is that the counterparty knows something that we don't.
242.00s:  And we might be stepping in front of a moving train. The reality is options are complex systems that typically have additional positions in conjunction with or you can have a market maker.
252.00s:  For example, that is working in a very low friction environment that essentially at the end of the trade, even though the option itself might lose, they can still walk out out of profit by delta hedging and capturing the bit us spread.
265.00s:  So remember from a pure perspective, individual contract certainly is zero sum, but it's important to not get so stuck in a linear line of thought and think a little more broadly around the total system, which is not at all zero sum.
282.00s:  So as always, any questions, let me know, be an outlier. See you later.
