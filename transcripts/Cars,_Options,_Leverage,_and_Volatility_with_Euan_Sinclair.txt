2.10s: what's up everybody Eric here and I am
4.50s: back with you and I've tricked him into
7.80s: another conversation
10.32s: um we have a lot of interesting things
11.82s: that I want to talk to you about we you
13.38s: know we're starting a new year I think
15.36s: it'll be really interesting to get some
17.04s: of your thoughts on last year this year
18.78s: and there's a handful of other things
20.70s: that I wanted to talk to you about one
22.14s: of which I was giving a little bit of a
23.82s: preamble before we started recording
26.04s: which is a purchase I'm making and I
28.20s: want to get your thoughts but before we
30.42s: get into all of that welcome back yet
32.88s: again it's good to start the year with
34.44s: you yeah thanks for having me I feel
36.66s: sorry for you that you haven't got
37.92s: anyone more interesting to talk to that
39.72s: you've had me back three times in what
41.34s: three months or something but it's time
42.90s: to be here yeah I I think the the cool
45.90s: thing I like about you is um it's very
48.60s: straightforward conversation a lot of
50.76s: people that I talk to
53.34s: um yeah there's a lot of nebulous pieces
56.58s: to the conversation and I think from
58.32s: like a listening perspective I am a very
61.16s: no-nonsense guy I just prefer to ask a
64.32s: question talk about whatever that is and
67.02s: you have a lot of depth behind what you
69.12s: talk about plus I mean most of us are
71.70s: options Traders so really you're our guy
73.86s: so whether whether or not you like us
76.62s: we're here
78.24s: um and the audience I'm pretty awesome
80.52s: so I can see what well I mean based on
84.30s: what you were telling me about your
85.92s: distilling practices and the the level
88.02s: of clarity you can get in your alcohols
90.36s: I mean that is pretty impressive to me
92.40s: for anybody
93.66s: um that's interested in moonshine and
95.22s: whatnot we were just talking about that
96.66s: and apparently Ewan was saying that he
98.82s: has the best moonshine on planet Earth
101.10s: he labeled it as it will not kill you
104.28s: which is you know about is bringing him
106.44s: an endorsement as you can think of
108.66s: uh yeah I've still got some I'll send
110.64s: you some actually I'll bring some out
112.02s: when I'm in California when are you
113.64s: coming out uh next week no way where you
116.94s: going Palm Springs
118.74s: oh cool yeah I I if yeah I mean I'm I
122.28s: literally work from home so I can always
124.14s: pop over a link up with you that'd be
125.70s: kind of cool
127.44s: um Palm Springs right now I think uh is
130.98s: it getting rain or no because it's been
132.36s: raining here actually a lot in San Diego
134.12s: I don't know I mean if it gets rain it's
137.22s: gonna be for a few days and we can live
138.72s: with it it's gonna whatever the weather
140.04s: is there it'll be better than it is here
141.78s: fair enough yeah I guess that's fair
144.12s: yeah it's it's actually been warm and I
146.22s: think it's supposed to be really nice
147.18s: like we got the Sun out today it's the
148.56s: first day in a little while we've been
149.64s: getting a bit of a storm mostly up in
151.20s: NorCal so you'd probably be all right
152.46s: out in the desert
154.50s: so the very first question I want to
157.38s: talk to you about is the purchase
158.76s: decision so I am car shopping and I need
162.96s: something else to juxtapose against the
165.42s: Corvette and I figured you would have a
168.24s: strong opinion on this so I'm ready to
171.00s: hear it which is what are your thoughts
172.86s: on McLaren since you've spent some time
175.20s: over there and you are a car connoisseur
178.02s: yourself I know you're a Ferrari guy so
179.58s: I already know we're starting off on the
180.84s: wrong foot but I'm curious what your
182.76s: thoughts are I feel like I should like
184.80s: McLarens more than I do because Bruce
187.86s: McLaren was a kiwi so
191.16s: um I've got a kind of a kinship there
192.66s: and if you actually remember the Ford
193.98s: versus Ferrari movie yeah
196.82s: three of the guys who finished in the
200.28s: both Ford cars were new zealanders like
202.98s: new zealanders used to be legit good at
205.08s: sports car racing I don't know why you
206.94s: know people go surprises me countries go
208.68s: through little patches where there are
210.00s: good people and then other people follow
211.56s: them and so forth but anyway Bruce
213.60s: McLaren was a New Zealander so I feel
215.46s: like I should like them more than I do
217.26s: they're very good cars but they don't I
220.56s: don't know they don't really seem to
221.58s: have a lot of
223.74s: I don't know they just don't really
224.94s: appeal to me they just don't do it the
226.92s: other thing you've got to be really
228.00s: careful with is if you find one that's
231.00s: been dinged they are incredibly
233.52s: expensive to repair because they sit on
236.04s: this carbon fiber tub right it's not a
239.16s: matter of just hammering it out it's
241.82s: that's a real problem
244.98s: um
245.58s: I don't know I mean not good I'd rather
247.44s: get one than a Porsche
250.04s: so I was looking at the Supercar I was
253.26s: looking at the Porsches and the problem
254.64s: is I like I respect them I like them but
257.58s: I just have a hard time with uh six
260.28s: cylinder in a in a play car so I this
263.88s: superficial as that is I've been in a
265.86s: couple of them and they just don't they
268.32s: don't yeah do it for me that way the
269.76s: Aston Martins I think they're really
271.26s: really classy beautiful cars but they're
273.00s: just heavy they're heavy as all get out
274.68s: well they're not sports cars yeah it's
278.16s: have you ever have you ever owned one or
280.20s: driven one
281.88s: I nearly bought a db8 a long time ago
286.08s: um because I look kind of like the
287.58s: English muscle car right they actually
289.14s: look a little bit like 70s Mustangs they
291.48s: do
292.32s: um the problem with old ones is they
294.18s: just don't work they're terribly built
296.88s: um really badly built the new ones are
299.22s: fine
300.12s: um a friend who bought one I've driven
301.86s: them they're great they're fine but any
303.72s: car you buy now is going to be gonna
305.64s: drive really well I mean you can't buy a
308.22s: bad car you buy a Kia is going to drive
310.80s: better than any Ferrari or 40 years ago
312.90s: you know cars are much better I just
316.02s: the big thing about a McLaren though is
317.94s: you're not going to see them every day
319.14s: you know I see Porsches every day yes no
322.50s: one no one gets excited when a Porsche
324.36s: turns up but a McLaren's still
326.22s: yeah I'd get it I could get one I could
328.50s: they just don't do much for me but
329.76s: they're great cars do you like do you
331.80s: prefer the naturally aspirated V10 V8
334.92s: platform versus the forced induction I'm
336.96s: curious if that's part of your Calculus
340.38s: oh they've got
342.36s: there's nothing better than a V12 there
345.12s: it is I mean because if you've ever
347.10s: driven a V12 that is so smooth and they
350.04s: sound so good and they've got all the
352.56s: power of a V8 with the smoothness of a
354.78s: straight six that is the best
357.00s: um but I haven't really got a problem
358.44s: with turbos I mean they do
361.08s: a good turbo setup is quite good for
363.54s: avoiding sort of dead spots in your
365.34s: power curve and stuff I haven't got a
367.62s: problem with them but yeah I not many of
370.44s: my favorite cars happen to have them but
373.44s: an old turbos were terrible
376.44s: if you ever drive like a Saab Turbo from
378.90s: the apple or trying to think what else
382.02s: was turbocharged back then oh yeah the
384.18s: the Lotus with the turbo yeah terrifying
387.66s: cars because they didn't do anything
389.82s: they had a huge turbo lag and then it
392.04s: would just come in and suddenly you get
393.30s: an extra 100 horsepower it was it's like
395.64s: driving a two-stroke motorbike that's
397.92s: kind of the funny turbos I think is
399.48s: every once in a while they just come on
400.80s: and punch you right in the face because
402.36s: the the Corvette I have uh supercharged
405.24s: around that which I really really like
407.40s: um so that's actually one of the draws
408.84s: to the McLaren for me was that it it has
411.06s: the twin turbo I like there's a lot of
413.76s: stuff you can modify slightly with that
415.86s: which I like so I checked out a couple
417.66s: of the Ferraris one of which was the the
419.66s: 488 GTB and I liked it but I it just I
424.74s: don't know it didn't it didn't really do
426.90s: it for me I'm not yeah I don't know it
429.54s: didn't Tickle My Fancy I suppose
432.12s: I don't I'm not a huge fan of the
434.22s: Ferrari sports cars yeah
437.16s: um the Ferrari GTs are really amazing
439.32s: classy beautiful wonderful cars the
441.54s: sports cars are great but they don't
443.88s: I don't know they didn't it doesn't
445.38s: really appeal to me as much
446.78s: superchargers though are different to
448.62s: turbos and that they're kind of halfway
450.30s: between naturally aspirated and a turbo
452.52s: exactly much smoother power delivery
456.24s: um
456.96s: although twin turbos help because you
459.48s: can have a big one and a little one you
460.86s: can have a spinning coming into
462.36s: different periods and stuff yeah exactly
464.46s: and then depending on and also they make
466.56s: that whining noise so you can pretend
468.30s: You're Mad Max yeah I think that's the
471.30s: best part yeah well the other thing
472.44s: especially with like things like E85
474.72s: right and variable timing you can really
477.42s: smooth out most of the power curve I
479.70s: mean really the main drawback for people
481.38s: on superchargers at least is um the
483.90s: parasitic loss because it's belt driven
485.64s: but I I mean one they're very efficient
488.94s: now but two obviously none of these are
492.66s: for gas the total is the total
496.38s: horsepower you get out even if it's not
498.12s: as efficient as a turbo it's still
499.62s: better than if you don't have it on
500.94s: there right oh
502.74s: um by far and I mean my favorite part is
504.84s: is with superchargers now they they come
507.12s: on quick it's there's there's no lag
509.22s: right as soon as I get above 2000 RPMs
511.86s: I'm getting what I'm getting off the
514.14s: belt yeah
515.76s: yeah
517.68s: um
518.60s: superchargers went out of fashion for a
520.68s: long time but yeah they seem now
522.66s: everyone's putting superchargers and
524.04s: turbos on so you get the best of both
525.66s: worlds I know that that
527.78s: cross-pollination I actually think is
529.56s: really fascinating I no kidding was
532.38s: thinking about that for a little bit on
533.64s: the Corvette because that's kind of
534.90s: turned into my Frankenstein
537.06s: um I just have a bunch of parts laying
538.50s: down in the garage and every once in a
539.88s: while I'll just slap some different ones
542.16s: on and see what it behaves like and that
545.04s: does seem like a really fascinating
547.08s: setup I just do not have the skill set
551.10s: for tuning that just yet I can tune most
553.98s: of the rest of the car but that is a
556.80s: little outside of my wheelhouse
558.90s: yeah I could see that especially with
560.76s: the uh you know the ecu's you've got on
563.34s: these cars now it's not a matter of just
564.84s: bolting them on is it
567.18s: yeah Bingo and especially like the setup
569.58s: on the Corvette right now I have two
570.90s: ecu's essentially
572.40s: um to handle the different fueling
573.90s: systems and that already is challenging
575.76s: enough but well I'll be honest you
578.46s: shocked me I thought that it was going
580.14s: to be a vehement dislike of the McLaren
582.96s: but I figured there might be part of you
585.06s: that liked some of it because of your uh
587.40s: your background so I mean they're great
589.62s: cars they just don't grab me yeah which
591.96s: I think is totally fair I I find that
594.00s: with a couple of the other things I was
595.38s: looking at and I I mean that's a
597.18s: beautiful part of American consumerism
598.92s: in general is you know there's so many
601.08s: viable Alternatives here because I've
603.30s: talked to some of my other friends who
604.44s: are in like Australia and whatnot and
606.42s: they can get other cars right it's not
607.98s: like they don't have any cars but for
609.78s: some of them it's like really restricted
611.34s: like it's difficult you're essentially
613.26s: starting to ship things they end up
616.14s: costing twice as much too and the other
617.70s: thing about America is gas is almost
619.32s: free right how expensive you think it is
621.90s: compared to the rest of the world it's
623.16s: really cheap oh yeah appearance is
625.74s: ridiculously cheap like ensuring a
628.50s: Ferrari in London
630.24s: is going to cost you I don't know 50 000
632.40s: bucks a year or something ridiculous
634.50s: I just made that I just made that number
636.48s: up but it's a very very high number like
638.76s: I had a motorbike there and it cost me
640.68s: as much to insure it every year as I
643.08s: paid for the bike
646.14s: I mean at that point I would just what's
648.18s: what's the penalty if you get caught
649.68s: without it like oh yeah it's you've got
653.34s: to have it it's bad got it and also the
655.98s: other thing is um they get stolen that's
658.20s: a problem right
659.76s: so I only had that Pike eight months and
662.52s: someone stole it so you know I actually
664.02s: came out ahead on the insurance yeah
665.88s: it's so easy even here in San Diego
668.04s: there's a big problem because I mean you
669.84s: literally just need two dudes and they
671.64s: can pick it up and put it in a pickup
673.74s: truck and that's it yeah that's what
675.18s: they did I had a chain on it that was
677.10s: like as big as a anchor chain on a
679.26s: battleship and they just don't bother
681.06s: they just pick it up a second in a van
682.44s: and take it away and deal with it later
683.64s: exactly 100 30 seconds yeah it's I mean
687.84s: they're just not that heavy especially
689.16s: you know a lot of bikes it's funny you
691.14s: don't see that happening with some of
692.64s: like the BMW 1200 gs's because those are
696.24s: just fat they're heavy but yeah that's
699.90s: probably only weighed you know 350 400
702.42s: pounds yeah too easy that that's an easy
704.76s: pickup well I want to uh pivot us over
708.84s: for a little bit to the markets
711.78s: um 2022 interesting year it for me at
715.26s: least I talk about it pretty regularly I
719.22s: started Trading 2007 so not that long
721.98s: ago 15 years ago now and last year
725.34s: technically was like the third and only
728.82s: the third down year in the S P 500 since
732.42s: I started trading which I think just
734.28s: kind of highlights the the regime
736.08s: overall that I I've been trading through
738.30s: mostly
739.92s: um I walked out the year still pretty
741.96s: handsomely profitable which I'm thankful
744.00s: for I think it was the
746.04s: final culmination of the skill set I've
749.76s: been working on for some time and then
751.32s: it finally I just saw a different Market
752.88s: which obviously benefited a lot of the
755.76s: strategies that I use which I just want
757.62s: more volatility which I mean we we did
759.72s: get that but from your perspective
761.82s: obviously way more time and experience
763.50s: in the markets than me I'm just curious
765.36s: as you look back at 2022 if you were to
768.54s: share some of your initial thoughts what
770.10s: does that look like
772.32s: well my first thing you said it was an
775.62s: interesting year and you've got to get
777.00s: over that I mean the the market
780.54s: shouldn't be interesting like that on a
783.96s: in on that sort of level you should be
786.66s: interested in your process and
788.28s: interested in doing what you're doing
789.66s: but I mean until you told me the market
792.24s: was down the third time and well I mean
793.98s: I don't know I didn't know that I don't
795.48s: care it's like it doesn't people seem to
798.36s: think you need a different process if
800.34s: the Market's going down and the Market's
802.02s: going up
803.10s: but the problem with that is you don't
805.02s: know that in advance you can say we're
807.90s: in a bear Market but that just means we
809.76s: have been going down and if you're good
812.28s: enough frankly to say that that's going
814.26s: to continue
815.58s: I don't know why you're trading options
817.44s: you should just be trading Futures it's
819.12s: an awful lot easier
820.68s: so if you don't have a process that can
824.70s: be broadly applied in a market or a down
827.52s: Market
828.60s: you've got a problem because you cannot
831.90s: predict that in advance that's why we
834.18s: trade options we trade because of
835.68s: volatility which we can predict in
837.48s: advance that's that's why options are
839.52s: good because you're trading something
841.38s: more predictable you've got other
842.64s: problems but at least you can predict
844.38s: the main profit driver
846.90s: so that would be my first takeaway is
850.68s: like you know it was just another year
853.26s: I mean the only thing I've seen
855.30s: genuinely different I've seen two things
858.24s: genuinely different in the market
859.86s: because the market goes up the market
861.54s: goes down
862.80s: I mean something has to happen right I
866.22s: mean a year is 365 days
869.34s: that time gets filled with some crap
871.98s: right so it's usually like whatever's
875.52s: driving the market the market goes up
877.26s: the market goes down the FED does this
879.24s: the FED does that oil does
881.52s: it's all the same apart from all the
884.10s: banks going bankrupt in 2008 2009 that
888.72s: was a big change because that was like
890.28s: the entire system was threatened right
892.92s: the only other thing that I remember and
894.96s: it's a much more minor thing was the
897.42s: blow-ups of the volatility etns in 2000
901.68s: and when was that 2020 no God a long
904.50s: time ago 2018 or something
907.44s: um that was different like because that
909.48s: was a
911.94s: something that was endogenous to the
914.04s: structure of the etn it wasn't a
915.96s: volatility effect it was because of the
918.48s: way they'd structured this thing and the
919.92s: way they had to rebalance it right but
922.62s: other than that in 2022 was just uh it
925.62s: was a year things happened the the
928.20s: interesting thing about it
930.62s: was vix is elevated still I mean Vixen
935.58s: it's not often that Vex stays this far
938.16s: above its long-term median
940.62s: for this long I mean it's it's uh it's
943.68s: unusual but what's more unusual is that
946.80s: volatility of Vex is really low
949.50s: and usually there's a very strong
951.06s: correlation between the vix level and
953.04s: the volatility effects now that's kind
954.96s: of an observation there's no money to be
956.70s: made there volatility of Vex should be
958.62s: low because it's not moving
960.60s: so purely as an observation you can't
963.72s: make any money out of it because
966.60s: well you can't make any money out of
968.04s: levels or prices you need something to
970.92s: change to make money
972.66s: but that would be one of those things
975.42s: where I think you should look at your
977.34s: process
978.54s: and okay so volatility is high so you
981.78s: might have been trading a certain way in
983.10s: the past based on that
984.90s: but is that actually contingent on
987.12s: volatility of volatility being high as
989.40s: well
990.36s: I see because that is a correlation
992.76s: that's always held on the past and might
994.80s: not now
996.18s: so that I think trading and volatility
999.66s: regimes you can modify your process and
1002.36s: you should
1003.32s: trading in Bear markets and bull market
1005.36s: regimes
1006.80s: I I think that's
1008.96s: that's a Fool's errand trying to fit
1011.18s: your process to that
1012.92s: it's interesting and I actually that's
1014.96s: one of the reasons why I really enjoy
1016.34s: talking with you because I know that
1018.08s: you're a very dedicated to the
1019.88s: volatility trading craft and I think for
1022.34s: me I look at last year and another
1024.62s: interesting aspect to it at least in my
1027.02s: opinion was just the relationship
1028.46s: between equities and bonds and there was
1032.90s: actually an at least for a good period
1035.36s: of time some good pairs trades I think
1037.64s: that we're able to construct on that do
1040.64s: you trade Pairs and things like that
1042.44s: when their typical relationships are out
1044.36s: of whack or do you kind of just stick to
1046.10s: the volatility trading because that's
1048.02s: more your wheelhouse I don't really
1050.06s: trade interest rate products at all got
1051.98s: it um I mean I have a little bit in the
1054.92s: past the correlation between bonds and
1057.50s: stocks is a lot trickier than I think
1060.14s: people think absolutely it either goes
1063.08s: really positive for a while or really
1064.88s: negative for a while depending on
1066.38s: exactly what people are worried about
1068.18s: you know whether it's are we worried
1069.68s: about inflation are we worried about a
1072.38s: recession foreign
1073.76s: it's
1075.44s: that is something I've never got
1078.02s: involved in and I would
1080.72s: be very cautious about doing that based
1083.36s: on any sort of macro views you might
1085.28s: have
1086.18s: because those you might as well be
1088.64s: guessing right whatever you think your
1091.22s: macro views are it's very unlikely that
1093.74s: better than Market consensus it's just
1096.44s: no one's have ever proven to be in the
1098.66s: long run
1099.62s: so the chances that you're that guy is
1102.14s: pretty slim so the other reason I avoid
1105.20s: bonds is they're not volatile enough
1106.64s: there's not really enough changing going
1108.98s: on for me to do anything with them the
1111.38s: people I've known who've been very
1112.58s: successful and interest rates have all
1114.02s: been doing spreads along the Curve yeah
1116.48s: and that I I imagine they're probably
1117.98s: mostly trying to take advantage of the
1119.90s: leverage as well because bonds do offer
1121.82s: depending on what product you're trading
1123.50s: like Bond Futures offered pretty good
1125.12s: leverage
1126.44s: yeah and they'll be trading the fives
1128.48s: against the tens against the 30s or euro
1131.18s: dollar strips against the fives and so
1133.16s: you know the the trading enormously
1135.86s: leveraged stuff and they're trying to
1137.54s: make half a tick on it it's a different
1139.64s: game it's it's not in in no way is it a
1143.48s: retail game right right right yeah I
1146.24s: think that's fair and I mean I I
1147.86s: actually found last year I know that
1150.02s: this isn't necessarily your approach but
1152.90s: um I I found directional options trading
1155.42s: to be pretty profitable
1157.52s: um there is a handful of of things that
1159.74s: I was able to do specifically like ratio
1161.66s: put diagonals which I like quite a bit
1164.90s: but again I know you tend to focus more
1168.14s: on the volatility side of stuff
1170.36s: looking at 2020 you're doing that and if
1175.16s: you do that and you make money that's
1176.42s: great that's no problem you know you're
1178.46s: not making money off me I'm not going to
1180.62s: be bitter or Twisted about it that's
1182.06s: right you've done well all I would say
1184.76s: is make sure you p l things separately
1187.46s: yes you've got a Delta p l and you've
1190.46s: got a volatility p l which is basically
1192.38s: everything that isn't your Delta p l
1194.12s: because a lot of times what you think is
1196.52s: making you money isn't really what's
1198.02s: making you money and that makes it
1199.88s: really hard to improve or to know when
1202.22s: things are going badly so if you find
1204.38s: out all your money is coming from the
1205.94s: Delta give up on the options you should
1208.88s: be trading the Delta because it's an
1210.80s: easier you should always trade the
1212.90s: simplest thing you can right
1215.24s: um or maybe all your money's coming from
1217.22s: the volatility side in which case you
1219.56s: know don't do the Delta stuff so all I
1222.14s: would say is when you're doing
1223.10s: multi-dimensional stuff and I do this
1224.96s: for options as well because
1227.18s: options have tons of different risk
1229.40s: factors you've got to break out where
1231.02s: your p l is coming from in each case
1232.76s: because that is the more you can learn
1235.82s: yeah I think that makes a lot of sense I
1238.28s: I think one point that I do slightly
1240.86s: disagree with you on is just the idea of
1243.88s: trading options solely for volatility
1248.30s: and if it's essentially not a volatility
1250.10s: component or you know the majority of
1252.26s: the profits coming from volatility you
1254.54s: should trade Delta one products and the
1256.10s: only reason why I say that is there's an
1258.74s: efficiency component with options that I
1261.86s: can't get with Delta one products
1265.28s: um totally you know respect your point
1267.50s: especially as it pretends to volatility
1270.08s: being the largest driver essentially
1273.14s: when we're talking about options but I
1275.30s: do think that there's something to be
1276.68s: said about the overall product
1278.96s: efficiency of of options specifically as
1281.60s: it pertains to leverage like if I buy a
1283.52s: leap that's 500 and something days out
1286.28s: that I'm pretty convicted on at least
1288.74s: either following a trend or an interim
1290.66s: price movement it's gonna perform better
1293.66s: for me
1294.86s: um than if I buy the Delta one product
1297.20s: provided that I'm not stepping in the
1299.48s: face of volatility and getting my face
1300.98s: ripped off with that yeah I could see
1304.04s: that but I think what you're doing is
1306.20s: making the best of a bad situation so
1309.20s: you lot you're doing what the best you
1311.72s: can but you're not doing what the best
1314.06s: is in an Ideal World
1315.92s: so I mean we all have we all have issues
1318.38s: with what we can trade like that I mean
1320.30s: there are sometimes I see oh I want to
1322.46s: do a Vex Futures trade but I don't have
1325.22s: I don't have a Futures account so I
1327.56s: can't just say oh I do the Vex Futures
1329.30s: instead of I don't know VXX or whatever
1331.60s: so I mean we all have limitations like
1334.52s: that and you have to do the best within
1336.26s: them
1337.10s: but you also have to sort of realize
1339.26s: that sometimes what you're doing
1340.96s: wouldn't be the best in an Ideal World
1344.30s: so yeah no and it's it's super well
1347.06s: received so I would say with options as
1350.24s: well as if you're trading sort of
1351.62s: semi-part time and you can't sit in
1353.24s: front of your screen all day
1354.86s: options do give you that automatic stop
1357.14s: process
1358.34s: you know and that is that's what you're
1360.92s: paying for and so if you were I don't
1364.22s: know a semi-professional or retail or
1366.56s: you know whatever if you're not a
1367.88s: full-time Pro then that does give some
1372.02s: benefits as well I mean options do exist
1374.30s: for a reason
1376.04s: yeah so following that same thread
1379.22s: um let's say that that same scenario
1381.86s: right let's say if I have a bearish
1383.66s: theme in something and I want to trade
1385.34s: it to the downside and rather than what
1389.24s: would you just short the Delta one
1390.92s: product if that is your primary theme
1392.72s: and accept the the carrying cost of the
1394.64s: short
1395.66s: um and then just manage the and I know
1397.70s: that you to preface all of that I know
1400.34s: that that's not necessarily your style
1402.08s: of trading this is all just in a
1403.40s: hypothetical
1404.90s: um but would you trade the short stock
1407.54s: including the carrying cost and then
1409.64s: just manage your risk via a stop or
1412.10s: whatever the case is versus
1413.86s: buying a long dated deep in the money
1416.84s: put and something like that
1420.50s: I would probably end up doing that but
1422.84s: it wouldn't be that would be the result
1424.22s: of a process rather than a dogmatic
1426.38s: decision that's the first thing I'd do
1428.18s: is look to see what the implied Vol
1429.62s: looks like relative to my forecast fault
1431.90s: maybe the options are cheap I mean that
1433.82s: does happen the other thing I'd look at
1435.80s: is what the implied skew was like if it
1438.68s: was an index I probably wouldn't because
1440.36s: you're overpaying for the ball and the
1442.58s: skew right but for a lot of stocks
1444.26s: you're not so if it was a stock
1447.38s: maybe maybe I'd do an option I mean
1450.50s: could possibly
1452.72s: but I'd probably given the fact options
1455.06s: are usually overpriced given the fact
1456.92s: skus usually overpriced like probably it
1459.44s: would end up just shorting the stock
1461.48s: yeah yeah and I think I mean something
1463.94s: like uvx or uvxi right we know it decays
1467.00s: right if you've just shorted it you've
1470.60s: made a ton of money over the years
1473.36s: if you've bought ports you haven't
1476.36s: because you're paying such a high Vol
1479.06s: level for them but they just they're
1481.40s: just a bad bet you're just paying too
1483.38s: much for the Viewpoint you have
1486.02s: right right yeah and that makes total
1489.08s: sense to me because I think one of the
1490.52s: the primary inputs at least in what I do
1492.38s: anytime I touch an options really a lot
1495.14s: of it is inspired from reading your work
1496.94s: if if I don't have at least some level
1499.70s: of volatility opinion I wouldn't
1501.86s: typically trade it so it makes sense to
1505.04s: integrate that I was actually doing a
1507.62s: bit of testing
1509.60s: um I don't know if you've read the book
1511.40s: I think it's called the the second leg
1513.38s: down yeah um yeah when that that's been
1516.32s: a really interesting read to me one of
1518.24s: the things from that book it talked
1519.44s: about was just the centralization of
1521.96s: variance risk premiums in indices and
1525.08s: they were looking at different Deltas to
1527.66s: see you know where that skew or that
1530.48s: variance risk premium tends to Trend the
1532.34s: highest and they were identifying it was
1534.44s: something around a 25 Delta I'm curious
1537.14s: if that falls in line with what you've
1539.54s: seen or if you've actually studied that
1541.10s: I know you've looked at a ton of stuff
1542.66s: and
1543.80s: have you seen that
1545.54s: yeah I actually wrote a paper on it last
1547.88s: year
1548.84s: um got published started last year
1551.30s: um yeah looking at all the risk
1553.28s: reversals in all of the different ETFs
1555.98s: and different indices
1557.48s: actually it's more like the 15 Delta 20
1560.30s: 20 Delta it's slightly lower
1563.18s: um but yeah that's that's true I would
1565.58s: that is a good book by the way so I'm
1567.32s: not criticizing the book necessarily but
1569.24s: I do
1570.44s: I mean there aren't many good books but
1572.12s: that is one of them I do take issue with
1574.64s: that being a volatility premium because
1577.16s: if you just trade if you trade a hedge
1579.74s: risk reversal
1581.66s: and you compare that to just selling the
1584.66s: straddle
1585.74s: you'll find that you have
1588.44s: that correlated but not a hundred
1590.42s: percent it's a different risk factor so
1593.54s: I kind of think of it like
1595.40s: the same way that the market the stock
1597.98s: market has value factors and size
1600.26s: factors I think volatility surface has
1602.96s: different factors as well I think
1604.82s: there's a variance Factor there's a skew
1606.62s: Factor okay
1608.42s: um but yeah if you're going to sell
1609.92s: options in indices
1612.38s: start with the 1520 Delta range I mean
1615.68s: that's normally where you get the boat
1617.06s: most banned for your buck
1619.10s: that makes sense and another interesting
1621.32s: follow-on this is one that I was doing
1623.30s: myself was just testing different styles
1627.14s: of broad portfolio Hedges either using
1630.74s: in index itself spy iwm something like
1634.34s: that or
1635.72s: using volatility and I know there's
1638.84s: obviously trade-offs between using those
1640.82s: two products
1642.26s: one of the things I found interesting
1644.48s: was I use a program that essentially
1648.02s: lets me trade live but pre like
1651.38s: historical days right so I can like
1653.72s: rewind and time and trade that day as it
1655.64s: was and one of the things I noticed that
1659.00s: was pretty interesting was volatility's
1662.30s: behavior during something like 2020
1664.70s: during the crash that we saw around
1666.86s: March
1668.12s: that seemed to greatly outperform using
1672.92s: any sort of put strategy as the Hedge
1675.80s: kind of Ideal circumstances for that spy
1678.80s: or the volatility hedging strategy
1681.98s: one of the things I'm curious about is
1684.80s: I was thinking that volatility was so
1688.28s: underpriced because leading into
1690.02s: volatility or leading into 2020 we've
1693.32s: had just a sustained bull market does
1697.46s: that rule or does that experience carry
1701.00s: more as a rule where volatility can
1704.12s: serve as a more effective General broad
1707.42s: portfolio hedge versus using something
1710.06s: like beta weighted you know puts in a
1712.40s: index itself because those tend to be
1714.26s: overpriced
1715.82s: uh that's a really really big question
1719.06s: um
1720.26s: every hedge tends to be overpriced and
1724.28s: that shouldn't hold you back because
1725.96s: you're paying for insurance you're doing
1728.30s: it not to make money people sometimes
1730.82s: conflate
1732.44s: a hedge with it being a different trade
1735.56s: and they want to be they want to make
1737.00s: money on both sides of it and that's
1738.68s: just not going to happen right if you if
1741.68s: you think stocks are going to go down
1742.94s: sell your stocks
1744.62s: that you have a hedge in place because
1746.96s: you think things are going to go down
1748.34s: but if you're wrong and you can't get
1749.84s: out of the way so you have to pay for
1752.12s: that privilege and whether it's a stop
1753.74s: whether it's an option whether it's
1755.12s: volatility it's it should cost you money
1758.30s: right you want it to cost you money
1760.52s: because that means the rest of your
1761.66s: portfolio is making money
1763.52s: the optimal way to do stops is a really
1766.64s: difficult question
1768.98s: um
1769.64s: and it's a very involved question I'm
1772.70s: actually working on it now
1775.64s: trying I'm sort of tying stops and
1777.92s: options and the Kelly Criterion all into
1780.62s: one thing
1781.88s: so I figure when I've done it it will
1783.68s: annoy practically everyone in the world
1785.54s: because all of those things annoy people
1788.48s: um
1789.50s: but yeah it's a it's it's a very
1792.50s: difficult very general question I would
1795.56s: say the other thing is if you're hinging
1797.18s: if you're hedging something you should
1799.04s: probably hedge it with something on that
1801.14s: something right so if you're hitting
1802.94s: stops you should hedge it with stop
1804.44s: options or a stop in the stocks
1807.10s: oftentimes people get too clever
1809.96s: and they try to hedge a product with
1812.36s: something else they think is correlated
1815.18s: and the problem is when something
1817.34s: disastrous happens those correlations
1819.38s: can break
1820.70s: so you would have seen that
1822.98s: if someone had tried to do a hedge on
1826.84s: uvxi with VXX options
1829.94s: when VXX went through that problem where
1832.22s: they weren't redeeming
1833.84s: those those correlations completely
1835.76s: broke right and you're not hedged so I
1840.08s: would say if you've decided you're going
1842.30s: to Hitch
1843.92s: it's almost always a better move to
1846.92s: hedge it with the actual thing so here's
1850.10s: your
1851.00s: stocks with stock options or stock
1854.18s: futures I wouldn't do a cross product
1856.94s: hedge because you're just adding another
1858.74s: problem on top of things and the reason
1861.68s: you do a hedge is because you're like
1863.96s: there are some situations in the future
1866.06s: that I won't understand right now
1868.76s: so don't try and get too smart hmm
1872.42s: yeah I I think that makes a ton of sense
1874.82s: and I think at least from my perspective
1877.58s: I actually just about never hedge
1880.64s: um I just kind of use sizing as the
1883.58s: primary risk control protocols but I
1885.86s: like looking at them I find them
1887.06s: fascinating especially the way that they
1888.68s: behave and the main thing I was really
1891.26s: looking at there is I was wondering if
1893.36s: the out performance I saw in vix
1896.60s: in 2020 relative to hedging again via
1900.32s: puts of different Deltas of different
1902.60s: expirations in the in the in the indices
1905.00s: himself was because we had such a
1909.20s: prolonged period of low volatility
1911.36s: leading into 2020 if they were just
1914.62s: outrageously cheap comparatively or if
1917.30s: that's you know kind of just general
1919.34s: behavior for them it's really hard to
1921.56s: tell the people analyzing things like
1923.78s: that is we just don't have many examples
1925.52s: right I mean the fix has only been
1927.56s: around since 1990 it's only been
1929.54s: tradable since 2003 so we haven't had
1932.96s: many sort of genuine panics so we anyone
1936.74s: who claims that's one of those things
1938.36s: I'll be like maybe I can't claim to know
1941.78s: because no one can claim to know we
1943.34s: haven't had enough evidence to do it I
1945.98s: would say that just because vol's low
1948.92s: doesn't mean it's a good time to buy it
1950.96s: because it can stay low for a very long
1954.44s: time
1955.28s: like Vol was exceptionally low for like
1958.70s: three years in the 2000s so if you
1961.46s: decided that you're going to buy the vix
1963.14s: because it was a 12 even though the Vex
1965.48s: I don't know if it's trading back in I
1967.70s: mean you would you would pay carry on
1969.68s: that for four years before you would
1971.24s: have made money
1972.50s: so it's one of those things that timing
1974.54s: is really important right and I and I
1977.60s: think that's kind of the the general
1979.04s: hypothesis I had was
1982.04s: um it was so low because of exactly that
1984.56s: because people would have been
1986.48s: um it would have been bid so low for so
1988.40s: long because there was no volatility
1991.64s: um another question that I got from
1993.32s: somebody that actually thinks really
1994.64s: interesting they were talking about the
1997.04s: the risk-free rate because for some of
1998.90s: the people that started trading in 2020
2000.64s: essentially you know it was not so
2004.84s: does that factor into the way you trade
2010.18s: options beyond the fact that risk free
2013.06s: rate is obviously priced in we know that
2015.10s: but I'm curious if the movement of
2018.28s: risk-free rate or the trend of risk rate
2020.14s: anything like that if that factors into
2021.70s: your Calculus
2023.50s: it doesn't really
2025.30s: um for a couple of reasons first most of
2027.22s: the stuff I trade is complete garbage
2029.02s: that has enormous borrow rates on it so
2032.26s: you know if you're trading a stock with
2034.06s: a borrow a rate of like 60 percent
2036.54s: that's your main consideration for what
2039.46s: the fair value is going to be not the
2041.80s: interest rate whether it's the interest
2043.24s: rates two percent or four percent does
2045.34s: it
2046.42s: um the other thing is most of the
2047.62s: options I trade are very short dated
2050.62s: um
2051.28s: I mean honestly
2053.08s: all right
2054.64s: I still think you can pretty much ignore
2056.74s: interest rates as an option Trader I
2059.02s: don't really think they're a big deal
2060.40s: and especially like row is going to be
2063.22s: such a small risk component to you
2066.28s: that
2068.10s: it's going to be overwhelmed by other
2070.84s: considerations sure you might make or
2072.82s: lose money if interest rates change
2074.38s: because of Roe but you're probably going
2076.72s: to make or lose a lot more money because
2078.22s: of something else
2080.08s: and you can't hitch it anyway so
2083.50s: it's just one of those things if you
2085.12s: find yourself selling or only puts and
2087.88s: no calls you might have your interest
2090.04s: rate set too low in your system
2093.28s: but that's pretty much the only thing
2095.44s: I'd worry about got it yeah I
2097.80s: essentially that was generally what I
2100.66s: was expecting you to see because it does
2102.04s: seem
2103.36s: um
2104.62s: I don't know yeah it seems like it gets
2106.18s: priced in as we move along so at least
2108.22s: from a retail trading perspective I
2110.50s: think one of the the parts of the
2111.94s: question they were trying to identify
2113.38s: was does that change like Risk to reward
2116.98s: calculations and for me it didn't seem
2120.22s: like it but I assume it does a bit right
2124.06s: and I think people neglect Carrie uh
2127.54s: more than they should like if if you're
2130.60s: if you're doing something like I don't
2132.16s: know selling uvx right
2134.62s: um You might think well that's a great
2135.76s: trade because it's down 15 this year or
2138.82s: whatever it is yeah except there's a
2141.10s: nine percent borrow rate on it right so
2143.62s: that makes a major difference and you
2145.78s: don't see that in your calculations
2148.00s: because you're looking at the price of
2150.04s: it you don't see this interest rate
2152.08s: payment draining out of your account
2154.06s: each day so I think people do neglect it
2158.14s: but
2159.60s: the effect on options because the option
2162.40s: premiums low
2163.84s: right that's why you like options
2165.70s: compared to trading the underlying so
2168.34s: the amount of carry on the option
2170.14s: premium isn't an enormous consideration
2174.82s: I mean yeah you should probably think
2176.86s: about it but I wouldn't think about it
2178.96s: very hard I've got other problems it's
2180.70s: way down the list right okay I start
2183.16s: worrying about my row I know it's been a
2185.44s: very very quiet time
2188.20s: got it
2190.06s: now another 2022 question for you did
2194.20s: any of your trades specifically stand
2196.60s: out and if so why
2201.16s: uh
2205.06s: I remember there was one from our
2206.68s: previous conversation that I was
2208.72s: actually curious about you were saying
2210.52s: that I I don't know if it was from last
2212.20s: year or from a time before that but
2214.30s: essentially you were explaining your
2216.52s: book which is a lot you carry a lot of
2218.74s: positions at least compared to like most
2220.48s: retail Traders I'm typically below a
2222.70s: hundred
2224.26s: um but you were explaining that there
2226.42s: was something it was a biotech stock or
2229.06s: whatever that you were trading
2229.96s: volatility on that essentially like
2231.70s: imploded oh yeah but that happens all
2234.10s: the time
2235.54s: um I
2237.46s: no I can't I think
2241.30s: this is there's a bit of a dichotomy
2243.04s: right one of the things about trading is
2244.66s: it's like the Alice in Wonderland thing
2246.34s: you've got to hold diametrically opposed
2248.50s: views in your head at the same time and
2250.60s: you've got to be comfortable with that
2252.04s: so one of the things about trading is
2254.02s: you have to learn from your mistakes
2255.84s: because a lot of people think that if
2258.34s: you do something for 10 years you're
2259.78s: going to get better at it but you want
2261.88s: unless you examine your mistakes and
2263.86s: lose learn actively learn
2266.68s: but the other thing is it's kind of good
2268.84s: in a way to forget all these traits in a
2271.24s: way they should all just blur and
2272.68s: together because it should be like
2274.54s: asking you know I don't know a cabinet
2277.36s: maker you know do you remember anything
2279.70s: particularly eventful about the cabinets
2281.74s: you made in 2015
2283.90s: . you're like I don't know no I went to
2285.76s: work I picked up a wood I did the same
2287.62s: stuff I always do it's kind of like that
2289.24s: when things are going well
2291.10s: probably shouldn't remember stuff it
2293.08s: should be the process it should just be
2294.82s: a a thing you do every day
2297.40s: like the buy and take imploding yeah but
2300.82s: it was a biotech this week that went up
2303.16s: 50 yeah was that yeah
2307.30s: uh I don't know I mean I never even care
2310.60s: I don't care why it happened I just knew
2312.58s: that it could happen because you could
2313.90s: see it priced on the options
2315.88s: so
2317.74s: that happens all the time when you're
2319.06s: trading garbage like I do so unless it
2322.66s: happens to like five or six stocks on
2325.42s: the same day it's a decent chance I
2327.88s: don't even really notice it
2330.04s: which is how I like it right fair enough
2332.44s: that it's yeah generally unremarkable
2334.36s: was there anything that you changed in
2337.30s: your approach for last year compared to
2340.24s: the year before the year before that
2343.20s: incrementally
2344.98s: I'm going to change things all the time
2346.54s: incrementally there's always an
2348.46s: evolution
2349.66s: but I wouldn't say there was any sort of
2351.66s: dramatic revolutionary change
2355.18s: I'm always
2357.28s: tweaking models testing models
2361.18s: um this year I've been working a lot on
2363.82s: the portfolio construction rather than
2366.40s: just having I'm selling these I'm buying
2368.68s: these trying to weight them all more
2371.50s: appropriately and that's actually a
2373.48s: really difficult problem because it's
2375.34s: really easy to just overfit things to
2377.20s: what they did in the past
2379.72s: um so that's I mean I'm always working
2381.82s: on stuff like that because the actual
2383.62s: trading is fairly automated
2385.66s: so you should always be doing that but
2387.58s: it's not like I'm like oh stop doing
2389.86s: that now I'm going to do pairs trading
2391.54s: or something sure sure with the
2393.94s: exception of the crypto stuff I got tied
2395.62s: up in which was genuinely a different
2397.96s: game and very unique I mean yeah I think
2402.76s: yeah the whole structure of that market
2404.80s: was different and you could do carry
2407.74s: trades on crypto and make 20 a year
2409.90s: whereas that's just not going to happen
2411.46s: in the equity world you know right right
2413.80s: right yeah
2415.00s: so then that leads into kind of a
2417.10s: follow-on question that is I assume we
2419.74s: already know the answer based on what
2420.94s: you've shared so far but looking at 2023
2423.76s: are there any like themes that you're
2426.58s: interested in or is it generally ceteris
2429.34s: paribus just continuing to deploys you
2431.08s: typically do
2433.26s: yeah I think so
2436.30s: um there are things that could affect me
2438.94s: in better ways or Worse ways but the
2441.82s: things I don't have any real control
2443.14s: over so and I can't really predict them
2445.96s: so I would like it if some of the retail
2448.78s: flow got out of front week options and
2450.88s: went into the backs
2452.68s: and I'd like it if the retail flow
2454.78s: stopped trading I think 50 of its ETFs
2458.46s: because there's another 3 000 stocks
2461.26s: that I'd love some more volume in
2463.42s: if that happens you know in five years
2466.42s: ago we wouldn't afford all this retail
2468.28s: would have come in and started trading
2469.78s: weekly options to the degree they have
2471.52s: right so if that happened that'd be
2473.92s: great for me but I can't really
2476.38s: do anything
2478.60s: to prepare for that or I can't convince
2480.94s: people they should do that so
2484.06s: that's kind of like most of my things
2486.10s: there's a ton of things that could
2487.54s: happen to me but I'm kind of at the
2489.22s: mercy of
2490.30s: the world right and like what actually
2492.22s: happens that's fair is is retail moving
2495.34s: into the other products is that more
2496.78s: like you're saying just for liquidity to
2498.64s: provide liquidity or
2500.56s: yeah it's
2502.78s: if you look at how many products
2504.52s: actually trade more than a thousand
2506.02s: options a day it's about 800 right so
2509.74s: there there's a lot of listed stuff that
2512.44s: just doesn't trade
2513.82s: and of those 800 an awful lot of them
2517.42s: are going to be trading less than 2 000
2519.28s: a day
2520.24s: so any sizable position I want to put on
2523.60s: is really it's one of the problems with
2525.94s: my portfolio
2527.32s: it's like I would happily sell 20 000
2530.08s: options but that is just not going to
2532.00s: happen right so I can't wait that the
2534.34s: way I wanted to it's also a problem and
2536.50s: significantly with a lot of academic
2537.82s: papers
2539.68s: um when you actually go through the
2541.00s: details of what they did you'll find
2543.34s: they did a long short portfolio but you
2545.38s: look at the shorts they put on and
2546.82s: you're like yeah none of that would have
2548.08s: been possible I see
2550.48s: um so
2551.56s: yeah I'd prefer it if there was someone
2553.60s: to trade against I'd like some more
2555.58s: volume than some of the stuff
2557.86s: it's interesting and I think that you
2560.14s: know this is part of the conversation
2561.40s: that retail Traders we're always taught
2563.98s: or told at least you know that retail
2566.56s: Traders are you know the most
2567.94s: disadvantaged people you know yada yada
2570.22s: yada which I I agree with a lot of that
2572.14s: to some degree but I always maintain for
2574.54s: retail Traders one of the the beautiful
2576.28s: things about a lot of what we do is even
2578.20s: if you have you know a 10 million dollar
2579.94s: portfolio you can still very reasonably
2582.40s: move into and out of most things but you
2585.88s: know for portfolios that are larger you
2588.88s: know institutional side they they've run
2591.76s: into this liquidity problem like you're
2593.26s: talking about even Warren Buffett talks
2595.06s: about this there is an interesting
2596.32s: interview I saw with him in I forgot how
2598.78s: old it was but it's essentially it's the
2600.70s: same thing people are saying you know
2602.98s: well why don't you spread into more
2605.32s: things if you're able to find all these
2607.60s: undervalued companies he said it because
2609.52s: I can't there's nothing for me to do
2611.50s: there there's not enough depth and you
2614.50s: know I think that's just a point that a
2616.72s: lot of retail Traders don't fully
2618.40s: understand
2619.96s: but I think people I think you're
2622.54s: overestimating the liquidity as well
2624.46s: though if you're trading SP you've got
2627.22s: to remember options and volatility are a
2630.40s: tiny bit of the financial Universe Heidi
2633.64s: compared to equity and bonds and
2635.86s: currencies
2637.24s: the stuff we do might as well not exist
2639.52s: right we are we are fleas on a horse
2642.52s: and if you want to trade the SPX options
2645.10s: though
2646.12s: I don't care how big you are you know
2648.52s: you you could have a billion dollars and
2650.32s: trade those but if you want to trade
2653.68s: a wide book of equities you'll have
2657.22s: trouble with 10 million bucks if you
2659.02s: have decent margining I don't know what
2660.76s: IB would give you but if you had
2662.20s: professional level margining that could
2664.66s: be difficult a 10 million dollar
2666.22s: portfolio
2668.26s: um if you've got 10 million bucks you
2670.00s: are really Limited in the stuff you can
2671.98s: trade you're probably limited to the top
2673.54s: 100.
2674.98s: yeah and I think that that generally
2677.20s: Rings true it's actually you know part
2680.44s: of the the product selection I typically
2683.02s: go through anyways is built around
2686.56s: um the the index ETFs and it's a lot of
2689.80s: it is just because I'm I'm lazy and a
2691.66s: lot of it's easier for me
2693.58s: um one of the the following questions I
2696.16s: had based on the last point for you
2697.90s: though is when you're looking at the
2701.98s: positions as you're building your book
2704.20s: and you have this limit in liquidity
2708.42s: obviously it can be difficult to exit
2711.52s: some of the positions I presume at a
2713.14s: fair price especially in some of the
2714.40s: biotech stuff if they have really wide
2717.22s: varied volatility how do you handle that
2720.16s: okay so if I if I could
2723.64s: I would like to trade like six month
2725.92s: options and take them off after about
2728.02s: three months because that means I'm much
2731.14s: less exposed to gamma I have much lower
2733.72s: hedging costs it becomes much more of a
2735.94s: pure volatility play it's much cleaner
2739.06s: the problem is first there's a lot less
2742.54s: liquidity as you go further out like
2744.46s: this and the other thing is like you say
2746.74s: getting in is one thing I can always
2750.04s: just hang around maybe I get in maybe I
2752.38s: don't but if I have to get out then I'm
2754.18s: in trouble if you have to do something
2756.22s: then illiquidity is a big deal right
2759.40s: so because of that I'm pushed way more
2762.22s: towards the fronts and I would say
2766.06s: I don't know eighty percent of my
2768.16s: positions probably I hold to expiration
2771.52s: so that's that's a big problem and it
2775.06s: sort of takes you away from
2776.38s: theoretically where you want to be to
2778.18s: practically where you have to be
2780.88s: yeah I mean is expiration risk or pin
2784.60s: risk is that uh something that impacts
2787.36s: you or not so much oh it does
2791.08s: um but today I had
2793.78s: possible problems with about three
2796.24s: stocks so it's not normally a huge deal
2800.62s: and I mean it's it is always there
2804.34s: but
2805.90s: I mean that's something I can live with
2808.24s: because I can trade the underlying I can
2811.24s: if you're right very close to expiration
2813.64s: it's normally you can get out easier
2815.32s: than you can if it's a four month option
2817.06s: because other people are looking at it
2818.86s: if you're sitting right on a strike as
2820.48s: well right right yeah that makes a lot
2823.84s: of sense
2825.16s: um I had one other question for you
2828.16s: um and I think we've kind of talked a
2830.32s: little bit about it so far but a lot of
2833.08s: the people that I interact with have
2835.30s: like really small accounts it's
2836.80s: essentially like twenty five thousand
2838.30s: dollars and less
2839.44s: and you know I always commensurate with
2844.24s: the series of trade-offs that they have
2846.52s: to make and one of the questions that I
2848.08s: got somebody was asking in that scenario
2851.38s: let's say you have a 10 or 20 000
2853.42s: account whatever and you want to trade
2856.36s: derivatives specifically for the
2858.52s: leverage but you're less interested in
2861.76s: trying to extract just volatility in and
2864.34s: of itself but you're trying to play a
2866.14s: trend
2867.64s: what are your thoughts on that broadly
2869.98s: speaking well it goes back to what you
2872.50s: were saying before it's not the ideal
2876.22s: way
2877.66s: to monetize that view
2881.14s: but it might be the best way that this
2884.20s: person can
2885.76s: so what I would do in a situation like
2888.28s: that is look for look for situations
2890.98s: where you're overpaying by the least
2893.14s: amount possible so I wouldn't be
2897.10s: I wouldn't be buying 20 Delta calls you
2900.46s: know because they are very speculative
2903.46s: not out of the money now yeah you'll get
2905.74s: great leverage on them but they're
2908.32s: probably going to end up worthless
2910.36s: situations like that I mean maybe
2914.80s: buying like a 70 Delta call or something
2917.68s: but you're still overpaying because
2920.02s: there's still a volatility premium to it
2922.72s: so that's the price you're paying for
2925.36s: the Leverage
2926.74s: the other thing I would caution people
2928.24s: with is they tend to somehow or
2930.58s: sometimes
2932.34s: overestimate their Edge
2935.02s: and hence over leverage something so
2938.92s: just because you can leverage it doesn't
2940.90s: always mean you should you know so
2945.76s: that's probably a bigger problem to be
2947.74s: honest
2948.52s: yeah and I I always think about it I I
2951.58s: actually did what like two years ago I
2954.34s: did uh like a small challenge account
2956.92s: you've seen them around before probably
2958.54s: at some point but essentially I like I
2960.22s: just took five thousand dollars put it
2961.66s: in account and saw what I could do over
2962.98s: you know a few months and it was a good
2966.58s: reminder of how annoying that is to be
2968.98s: honest just being so restricted is super
2971.98s: difficult even if you wanted to trade
2974.08s: equities outright I mean that is I think
2977.50s: even more difficult you I made way more
2980.02s: money in that account trading options
2982.66s: than Delta one products because of the
2985.90s: leverage so I can see why people go in
2988.96s: that direction but it lends to the point
2990.82s: that you're highlighting which is you
2992.80s: better be real good at Direction and we
2995.56s: know that in general people aren't
2998.08s: I mean I I run into this occasionally as
3000.72s: well it's like it's pretty easy actually
3002.76s: well okay nothing's easy but there are
3006.18s: patterns you can trade in options with
3009.60s: the day left
3011.00s: so let's just take that as a given the
3013.92s: problem is those spy options might be
3016.74s: worth a dollar
3017.82s: and I might have a 10 Edge
3020.10s: okay great let's say I can get 10 I can
3023.16s: make 10 cents on that option even after
3025.80s: costs great the problem is
3029.82s: if I want to sell a thousand it's by one
3033.36s: day options
3035.16s: that's like a I don't know
3038.48s: multi-million dollar haircut you know
3040.62s: it's something like I don't know
3042.60s: three 3.84 million dollars or something
3045.98s: that's a tiny return on that amount of
3050.46s: margin
3051.60s: so
3052.92s: that's a big yeah everyone faces that
3056.64s: I mean I was very happy that I found
3059.40s: something I could make 10 10 cents on
3061.50s: every day then I realized that the
3063.96s: actual return on the capital was
3065.52s: probably not worth it
3068.04s: um
3069.00s: I only found that out when I got a call
3071.76s: from the uh the clearing Bank to ask
3073.86s: what the hell I was doing
3077.18s: so hold on I I'm actually really curious
3081.42s: about that why why did they call you
3084.66s: well I mean I just went typically
3088.32s: I just went massively over my risk
3090.48s: limits without knowing I got over my
3093.36s: risk limits because my risk wasn't
3095.10s: really a problem but my margin was a
3097.62s: problem and they only really have a hard
3100.56s: limit on that overnight
3103.14s: so typically the the
3108.06s: how do I put this
3110.16s: the limits I have are on the software
3112.26s: side and a thousand options isn't
3114.78s: particularly big okay but a thousand spy
3119.28s: options because it's a four hundred
3120.84s: dollar stock
3122.16s: that is particularly big in a margin
3124.62s: sense okay so that was I was like oh
3127.68s: that was surprising
3129.30s: I mean I should afford that earlier but
3131.04s: it just didn't seem like a big deal yeah
3133.56s: yeah
3135.06s: so I've had you here for about an hour
3138.12s: um and as always I really respect your
3140.28s: time but I do want to ask you one final
3142.68s: question which is
3144.54s: I was reading a few articles that I find
3146.64s: really interesting where there was a lot
3148.92s: of retail traders that started in 2020
3151.38s: during covid all at home tons of
3153.36s: stimulus yada yada and we're starting to
3156.54s: see retail Traders uh bowing out which
3159.78s: falls in line with most of the the
3161.58s: studies I've read so far at least at
3163.44s: about five years is the major threshold
3166.32s: for retail Traders specifically day
3169.20s: traders to either Make It or Break It
3171.84s: for the people that are on the fence
3176.34s: and looking at this and saying okay you
3178.98s: know I've been at this for two years not
3180.72s: really profitable
3182.52s: if you were in their shoes what would
3185.76s: you be doing going forward not
3188.28s: necessarily because it's 2023 but just
3190.20s: going forward as they're two years into
3192.12s: this you know into their trading tenure
3194.94s: you mean what would I be doing as in
3196.62s: giving them advice whether they should
3198.12s: keep going or what they should
3199.92s: specifically be trying to learn
3202.80s: um I would go with the latter but less
3205.26s: on like your advice for them and more
3207.96s: your advice for yourself like if you
3209.82s: were in that that paradigm
3216.06s: I mean that's difficult to know because
3217.68s: honestly when I was two years in the
3220.20s: markets were in such a different
3221.34s: situation in a different shape I mean we
3223.68s: were talking about you know Merrill
3226.26s: Lynch should still charge people 20
3227.70s: bucks to do a Futures Contract kind of
3229.80s: thing
3236.88s: I think the big thing to get over
3240.18s: is to work out the things you actually
3243.24s: have a chance of predicting that might
3246.48s: make money
3247.74s: so stop trying to think these deep and
3252.60s: complicated thoughts about how the war
3254.88s: in Ukraine is going to affect potato
3256.80s: futures or something that's
3259.50s: a very appealing game to play right it's
3262.44s: like when you think you can bet on
3263.88s: football because you played football in
3265.86s: high school
3267.06s: and you think you know about football I
3270.12s: bet you Bill Belichick couldn't
3272.30s: professionally bet on football
3274.74s: because what he knows isn't the
3277.80s: important thing for beating the spread
3279.42s: he knows more about it sure well that's
3281.94s: almost completely baked in
3284.46s: so you've got to look for other stuff so
3287.22s: don't try and do the fundamental things
3289.38s: like that look for situations where
3291.90s: markets might be slightly out of line
3294.24s: for a reason you can identify
3296.82s: you know because
3298.62s: there's a I don't know Coke and Pepsi
3301.02s: they tend to move together and there's a
3303.18s: massive supply of balance because
3305.06s: someone's dumping a lot of coke so the
3307.68s: spread gets out of whack so you do that
3309.60s: spread trade that kind of thing look for
3312.48s: situations where there is a definite
3315.24s: reason you can identify for a small
3318.90s: discrepancy like that so actually
3321.18s: honestly if I was starting right now and
3323.70s: I was coming in from a retail angle I'd
3325.80s: probably do pairs training
3327.60s: because that is that situation where
3329.88s: you've got an identifiable thing
3332.46s: you can hold these things for weeks so
3335.46s: your transaction costs won't kill you
3337.20s: that's the other thing don't try to be a
3338.82s: day trader that's what they all do
3340.74s: though your transaction costs are just
3343.02s: way too big look I get it as well right
3345.18s: it's the same thing you you think you've
3347.88s: got an edge so you want to make a
3349.14s: thousand bets a day
3351.30s: all you're going to do is rack up
3353.04s: transaction costs it's an incredibly
3355.68s: difficult thing to do I would say be a
3358.20s: peers Trader
3359.70s: look for
3361.68s: trades that are going to take you two or
3363.60s: three weeks right and don't look for
3366.12s: things that are locks don't worry too
3368.70s: much about whether Coke has this
3370.38s: business and Pepsi doesn't or whatever
3373.02s: I would do it mathematically
3376.20s: um
3376.98s: try not to have opinions and would you
3379.62s: use options you would you use Delta one
3381.66s: products
3383.40s: uh you can do peers trading through
3385.68s: options you know straddler versus
3387.36s: Scrabble yeah but it's a lot more
3389.64s: complicated because you've got exposure
3392.10s: to applied Vol and realized ball and
3395.16s: correlation
3396.66s: just way more complicated thing I'd
3399.48s: probably use Delta one
3401.88s: um
3403.14s: most of the stuff you need to learn
3404.64s: about options
3406.32s: is the mechanic solve options
3409.50s: you will really benefit as an options
3412.44s: Trader if you know how to trade all this
3414.54s: other stuff as well
3416.28s: and there's
3417.90s: actually there's another good book one
3419.64s: of the very few good books out there a
3422.04s: book called pairs trading Yeah by
3426.30s: some Indian person whose name I can't
3428.58s: remember I think it starts with a v
3430.80s: and you know people will take issue with
3433.08s: it if you if you put out on Twitter for
3435.00s: example is this a good book no you'll
3437.40s: get a hundred thousand people saying
3438.78s: it's a terrible book for some reason
3440.16s: because they did something and it was
3441.66s: wrong but
3443.46s: I think it's a good book there's a lot
3445.08s: of stuff in there that'll help you it'll
3446.46s: set you in the right direction there's
3448.32s: no money but the yeah the the book for
3451.56s: anybody wondering I'll throw a link to
3452.94s: it but it's called Parish trading
3454.32s: quantitative methods and Analysis I
3456.84s: would try to say the name but did a
3459.90s: Murphy or something it's
3462.38s: ganapathy
3464.00s: vitamurthy okay yeah yeah it's a good
3467.40s: book I've tried to find I've tried to
3468.96s: email them or contact them I've never
3470.70s: managed to I actually plagiarized them
3472.80s: accidentally in my first edition of my
3474.96s: book because I'd written it down in some
3477.84s: notes and I hadn't written down that I'd
3480.12s: taken it from his book so I'd forgotten
3482.22s: uh I apologize for that in the second
3484.74s: edition I try to reference people I
3486.72s: don't try and plagiarize but you know
3489.12s: sometimes
3490.40s: sooner or later you'll come across an
3492.54s: idea that existed
3494.04s: uh this was more than that this was
3496.68s: basically straight out of his book oh
3499.14s: good it was only half a page and I think
3501.90s: I wrote it better and I did Apologize
3503.76s: later when I realized so if he's
3506.52s: listening I apologize again it was a
3509.16s: homage it was not theft
3511.80s: we'll make sure that uh he's he's well
3514.32s: aware
3515.88s: um well un is always seriously I I love
3518.88s: chatting with you I love picking your
3520.44s: brain on a lot of this stuff
3522.24s: um so thank you for taking the time to
3524.22s: to hang out talk a little bit with us I
3526.14s: think an interesting thing going forward
3529.32s: there was a handful of questions that
3532.68s: people ask specifically as it pertained
3535.62s: to your approach to retail trading and I
3540.30s: think that there's bits of that you know
3541.80s: in your books I think people can can
3543.78s: identify a lot of it but I thought that
3545.64s: could be a cool follow-on session to do
3548.22s: in the future and really kind of like
3549.90s: nuts to bolts walk through some of that
3552.48s: stuff because I think like you're
3554.04s: talking about one of the the fights I'm
3557.16s: fighting here is retail Traders do what
3559.44s: retail Traders do they typically look at
3562.02s: things that are just straight in front
3563.34s: of their face forgetting the future
3565.14s: dated aspects to things even like
3567.24s: expectancy it's hilarious to me like how
3569.76s: unknown that is compared to something
3571.20s: like probability of profit you throw a
3573.00s: rock you hit somebody that knows about
3574.80s: probability of profit but it's never
3576.18s: heard of the idea of expectancy you know
3577.92s: it's like those kinds of things so I I
3580.50s: think it would be really cool if you're
3581.52s: willing at least at some point in the
3582.90s: future to do kind of like a concerted
3584.58s: session specifically on like retail
3587.28s: trading Concepts
3589.08s: um I I think that could be really fun
3590.82s: but regardless you know as always it's a
3592.98s: pleasure chatting with you so thank you
3594.30s: for uh for hanging out for a bit no
3596.58s: problem thanks for talking again well
3598.80s: we'll catch you again soon I'll let you
3600.66s: know what uh what car I end up with and
3603.06s: then we'll see what your opinion is of
3605.22s: it all right just don't get an orange
3607.14s: one that's literally the color I
3609.66s: probably will get okay
3612.60s: I had to figure out a way to disappoint
3614.52s: you so I think I I snuck it in there
3616.50s: right at the end don't worry I'm sure
3618.18s: you can disappoint me in lots of ways
3619.62s: I'm positive
3621.60s: take care thanks
