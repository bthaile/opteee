0.00s: Everyone, Eric here made a handful of adjustments in the small stacks portfolio yesterday.
6.60s: So I'm going to share those here.
10.44s: And then the other thing I was actually just thinking about is kind of defining the time frame
15.76s: for the portfolio because although it is entertaining and educational for essentially this forum,
24.76s: I do not intend to do it into perpetuity just because it's not really the best use of my time for myself.
33.48s: So as of right now, I'm thinking of pretty much doing it for a year, which would take us till around one September of next year.
40.88s: But if anybody's any thoughts on that, let me know.
43.12s: I don't want to cut the segment short if folks are finding it helpful, but I also am thoughtful in the fact that it's helpful for folks.
54.48s: But like I said, not really the best use of my personal time.
57.48s: So we'll right now that's what I'll plan to unless you know, there's some sort of uproar or somebody has a better approach, you know, I would be receptive to it.
67.04s: Okay, so that part of side.
69.44s: Let's take a look at the portfolio.
73.08s: So I took down my trade in mosaic yesterday.
76.80s: Most of these trades were done yesterday.
78.84s: The reason being is just with today being election, I anticipated a bit of volatility.
85.40s: So pretty much across most of my portfolios, I was just closing stuff down yesterday and then planning on reestablishing, you know, minor exposure yesterday.
96.52s: But really, I wanted to make sure I was repositioning things before we went into the election just because.
104.48s: I didn't know obviously which way the market was going to react.
107.80s: Still don't know.
109.40s: Right now it's 18 25 Pacific time.
112.84s: So we'll see.
114.68s: But with all that being said, I wanted to make sure that everything was kind of adjusted before today.
122.40s: And then we'll kind of see what things look like going forward.
124.72s: So figured that we would start with the macro view.
128.56s: So.
130.56s: I realize I got to move my head again.
133.24s: So now we'll go down here.
135.76s: And actually, I think we can go bottom left because the next one, this is going to be in the way.
140.56s: Okay, and then let me just slide this over.
143.88s: All right.
144.88s: So.
146.28s: For mosaic that got closed out for 59 cents yesterday.
153.00s: And that took in a $31 PNL.
157.48s: Which was about a 34% capture of premium.
161.68s: Overall, I still like mosaic.
164.80s: I didn't want to hold it through earnings.
167.20s: So as soon as I saw an opportunity to exit the trade yesterday, I dumped out of it.
175.44s: Just because I wanted to minimize my exposure to kind of the move and then the subsequent follow on follow through potential, which if we take a look at it real quick.
185.16s: It was a good thing.
185.84s: And I did that.
186.84s: And it's another example of why I talk about being purposeful when offering exposure.
195.84s: So they reported yesterday after the close.
198.84s: And as you can tell today, had a pretty big red day.
201.84s: So my intention with that trade leading into.
206.84s: And the reason why I didn't again is because I don't want to mess with it post earnings as it's settling out.
228.84s: This was not really an earnings play.
235.84s: Depending on the trade ran through, I was willing to hold it through earnings, but that wasn't the original disposition.
242.84s: So I wanted to limit that.
245.84s: Now in its place, I took up Bank of America.
249.84s: And again, yesterday, I offered the 20 know of 24 puts at $1.22.
258.84s: Now, this was a super advantageous trade.
262.84s: I was between XL left and Bank of America.
266.84s: And it's because they're trading right around the same level.
269.84s: And this is a good conversation about premium.
273.84s: And even though XL left was returning over a percent, which is good for an ETF.
281.84s: Bank of America was obviously returning well over that.
286.84s: So that's why I took my money to really where the trade was.
291.84s: And I was hesitant to get long here, but obviously it had a bit of a gap up today.
296.84s: And I'm really excited that I intend to watch very closely because it's still early in the life cycle of the trade.
302.84s: Otherwise, I would love to close it here, but it's really not showing any sort of meaningful profit just yet.
309.84s: But we'll monitor that one as we go.
313.84s: Really the purpose of that trade was to capture that premium.
317.84s: It was significant.
318.84s: And for the buying power that I was putting out there, it represents a really, really good return.
324.84s: And I'm going to look at what lowered me into that trade.
327.84s: And I liked adding some financial exposure.
330.84s: So that's why that's there.
332.84s: Okay.
333.84s: Now moving over to the diagonals.
337.84s: Let me take this one down and open this one up.
340.84s: Okay.
341.84s: So taking a look at these in croaker.
344.84s: If you'll remember from the last couple of videos.
347.84s: I took down the short calls.
351.84s: I didn't offer any new exposure.
354.84s: And it's just because I was kind of waiting for a little while to see what the product did.
360.84s: And it was trading sideways for a little while.
362.84s: And then today with its recent kind of move up.
367.84s: I decided to offer a little bit of exposure in there.
371.84s: And the reason for that is I just didn't want to not be taking in premium for too long.
377.84s: And I offered kind of a partial here.
380.84s: It's still at a one to two ratio.
382.84s: So my upside is not capped.
384.84s: But I sent out the 18 December 35 calls collecting 65 cents, which is around a 30 delta.
392.84s: The leaps themselves right now are losing.
396.84s: They're definitely not where I want them to be.
399.84s: But it's overall still not too bad of a position.
404.84s: And then unrealized loss on those is about $380.
409.84s: Compared to the current leap.
411.84s: But we have 288 realize profit on the short calls.
415.84s: And then we still have an additional $65 out from the new outlay.
420.84s: If we see a little bit more of an up move.
423.84s: I will happily offer the second call to make this at a one to one.
427.84s: So I could essentially exit the entire trade out of profit.
430.84s: And then we'll see what it looks like.
433.84s: I like scaling in with the short calls just so I can be more sensitive to price movements and kind of collect a little bit more premium.
442.84s: One of the opportunity presents itself.
444.84s: Next up is Intel.
446.84s: So Intel.
448.84s: This was another pretty simple trade.
451.84s: I was watching it for a little while.
454.84s: Simply because I was showing over a 50% max profit.
458.84s: I was having a lot of time for a few days since I put this thing on.
463.84s: And once it started hovering around here and then I started,
468.84s: saw it start making a little bit of an up move.
471.84s: That's when I wanted to make the adjustments.
474.84s: So I closed out the 47 calls.
479.84s: I sold them for $1.65.
481.84s: I took them down for 74 cents.
483.84s: And then I offered the 20 no 47 calls.
493.84s: And I got 56 cents for those.
496.84s: Now I want to offer an important note on this.
500.84s: I typically would not have closed those 4d 47 calls.
507.84s: If there was 74 dollars left on the table when I was only getting 56 dollars for the new position.
514.84s: Right.
515.84s: That essentially means there's 20 $20.
517.84s: A little less $18.
519.84s: In the position I was taking down more than what I just put on the reason why I did this is because.
527.84s: The early expiration 20 no.
530.84s: So it offers me a little more sensitivity to more recent price change.
536.84s: And it's a obviously as soon as you start moving closer days to expiration,
541.84s: your premium per day automatically increases.
544.84s: So it has a higher premium per day.
547.84s: But the real thing that I was looking for here is, although it is a slightly lower overall return.
554.84s: It is in in the scale of things going to give me more money per day than what I had left.
562.84s: And the 47s that I had before so it was a way for me to realize that profit.
568.84s: And then take a look at something that will.
573.84s: That will offer me a little more sensitivity for whatever comes next for Intel.
581.84s: One of those being the dividend coming out on the fifth, which will not price down again, which is another potential for me to take those calls down.
591.84s: At a partial profit depending on what that looks like.
595.84s: But we'll have to wait and see what that, what that turns out to be for us.
600.84s: So overall going back out to the macro somebody was asking about the net lick for the portfolio.
607.84s: So I don't typically track this and I don't intend to going forward, but just to answer that question.
612.84s: Right now it's sitting at around $5,500, which is a little bit lower obviously than the realized.
620.84s: I just, P and L, but you know totally okay with me.
624.84s: I prefer to track the realized P and L. That's what's most important to me in a portfolio like this.
629.84s: But nonetheless, again, wanted to answer that question. So right now it's looking like $5,500 or so.
634.84s: And that's mostly coming from Kruger.
638.84s: The leaps hurting in there. They're down almost $380.
641.84s: So that's where the majority of that's coming from.
644.84s: So right now when we look at the portfolio, utilizations at $4,800, which is around 80% utilized.
652.84s: We've made about $1,000 on the account, which is pretty solid return.
656.84s: It's 17%. Since I started this on the first of September, the vast majority of profit is still coming from the diagonals.
665.84s: And right now there is $243 in premium out in the market, which would be about a 4% return on the account.
673.84s: Now, the last thing that I want to note is this is absolutely a time that I'm going to start looking at volatility products.
684.84s: As we see volatility starting to receive back leading into the election, especially if things start getting weird tomorrow, meaning, you know, we don't know who wins.
696.84s: That kind of thing. They're starting to recount fighting over that.
700.84s: As soon as I start seeing anything like that happening, I will absolutely buy some VXX calls just to take attempt to take advantage of an uptick and volatility on the cheap.
713.84s: So I'm going to keep an eye for that overnight. And realistically, this will be one of those scenarios that I may end up playing it in my margin account via futures.
725.84s: But I will do my best to mirror that in this account just because I think that that may provide a good opportunity to make a few bucks.
735.84s: So all in all that's what we're out with the small stacks account is always if there's any questions or feedback, anything that people want to see.
742.84s: Let me know that is the entire purpose of the channel.
746.84s: We'll see what the market looks like curious how the week is going to play out.
751.84s: And we'll talk to everybody later.
