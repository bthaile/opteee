0.56s: made a
1.52s: 84% return in nem in less than 40 days
5.76s: so this video is going to walk you
7.16s: through a Rao called diagonal position
9.60s: that I put on in neem and I want to walk
12.68s: you through essentially how I've managed
14.32s: the trade it's been a while since I've
15.60s: done one of these trade deep Dives so
18.28s: this one's not going to be edited we're
19.60s: just going to get straight into details
21.40s: and start working through the position
23.08s: so here's in a nutshell what played out
27.28s: on the 4th of March happy old birthday
30.04s: to myself I guess I gave myself a gift I
32.56s: saw NM starting to break out in a pretty
35.88s: big way and it popped up on one of my
38.40s: alerts and this is where I entered the
41.12s: trade now what's the origin of all of
44.32s: this it's kind of simple and I've been
46.36s: talking about this stuff on my YouTube
48.04s: lives actually for quite a while and
51.88s: it's the
53.20s: rotation that we're seeing still from
57.56s: Capital tied up in things like if I zoom
61.88s: this out a little bit more like 6 months
64.36s: you can see that on a longer term time
67.04s: frame it communication Services these
69.92s: have been killing it for the last year
73.28s: plus and definitely within the last six
76.12s: months but if you take a look at some of
77.52s: these shorter term time frames like if
79.24s: we go here to 3 months you'll notice
81.52s: that energy materials Industrials
84.68s: starting to creep up towards the top a
86.48s: little bit if we go into one month
88.48s: you'll also see that we still see energy
90.84s: running at the top materials still down
93.20s: towards the bottom but it's important to
95.24s: click within materials because metals
96.92s: and Mining has been doing a great job
99.92s: for some time so you can see metals and
101.40s: Mining is actually up 15% as compared to
104.36s: some of the other sub sectors of
106.12s: materials that are struggling so because
108.32s: I've started catching some of this
110.40s: rotation of capital into these other
112.88s: products especially against the broader
114.36s: inflationary environment that we're in I
116.44s: became really interested so NE popped up
119.64s: on on one of my scans and I decided uh
123.76s: to essentially just watch it and I
126.52s: didn't like it here at all so what I
129.48s: ended up doing was setting an alert
132.40s: right here at
134.04s: 3131 and it's just because this is kind
136.44s: of where I saw near-term resistance if
139.88s: we started to get some sort of pullback
142.76s: and we started to see a little bit of
145.32s: Life come through it's hard to see
146.68s: because it's kind of suppressed but you
147.84s: can actually see that volume on these
151.20s: updats started to expand so that was
153.96s: interesting to me and I ended up getting
156.40s: the alert after it cracked above 3131 on
161.20s: the 29th so then I was watching it on
163.32s: the 1st of March I was keeping an eye on
166.36s: the volume as we're running into this
168.24s: and then actually when the dividend was
169.80s: coming out you know you'd never know
172.32s: necessarily against broader market
174.40s: conditions I didn't necessarily you know
176.68s: integrate it too much into the decision
178.48s: cycle but I was aware that that there
180.04s: was a dividend coming up and then on the
183.00s: fourth I started seeing this really
185.12s: strong volume So I entered into a pretty
188.68s: speculative so this lived within my
190.52s: speculative allocation of the portfolio
192.80s: but I entered into a ratio called
195.52s: diagonal so the broader Market
197.84s: hypothesis kind of what we've been
199.44s: talking about high inflation now
202.36s: especially higher for longer is becoming
204.80s: a theme Tech is still doing well but
206.80s: starting to fall off a little bit we're
208.76s: coming into an earnings cycle there are
211.40s: you know a handful of things coming to
213.24s: the Forefront of my brain but the main
215.52s: thing that I want to highlight here is
217.16s: the rotation of capital into things like
220.24s: Metals into things like energy I
222.12s: actually have a couple energy trades on
223.52s: as well now the primary profit mechanism
227.12s: in here was a bullish thesis meaning I
229.08s: wanted neem to go up my original targets
232.60s: when I entered the trade were 42 and 31
236.88s: 42 simply because that is where the
239.84s: near-term high was and I would love to
243.28s: see us run up there I didn't think that
245.20s: we would run straight up there but that
247.52s: was the near-term Target and then 31
250.20s: because I was actually setting a really
252.48s: tight stop to the downside on this and
255.08s: it's because it's in a broader downtrend
257.60s: I viewed this as a really speculative
260.56s: entry I typically don't like to enter
262.56s: things when they're running down like
264.36s: this I look for strength but because I
266.48s: saw strength in the broader sub sector
268.72s: it made me interested on this volume
270.64s: breakout so once I saw it crack up above
274.80s: this kind of you know
277.32s: 302 handle that's when I really thought
280.80s: we were seeing some strength so the
283.76s: original trade that I put out was a 45
287.28s: lot of the 30 calls expiring 21 June 24
293.12s: and this was back on the 4th of March
295.64s: again so this originally was allocated
298.52s: to be a $25,000 position in its entirety
302.16s: and I wanted to use most of the capital
304.64s: upfront because I had such a tight stop
308.12s: loss on the
310.52s: product the reason why I went with a
312.96s: ratio called diagonal is because I
314.84s: wanted to leverage to the upside I also
318.60s: typically prefer the efficiency as
321.80s: compared to buying the shares although
323.44s: either in this case is fine and I went
325.84s: out to 21 June at the time of Entry
328.04s: because that falls into kind of my
330.08s: standardized days to expiration Target
332.68s: time frame for ratio called diagonals I
335.04s: like the longs to be definitely longer
337.88s: than 60 DTE typically 90 plus I've used
341.88s: to be over a year for almost all of them
343.84s: but I've actually slowly have brought it
345.52s: in quite a bit and normally it'll be
348.12s: somewhere around 90 now with NM
351.20s: specifically liquidity was a concern so
354.04s: I had to find decent offerings that led
357.76s: me to an entry that wasn't overwhelmed
362.28s: by super wide bit ask spreads and that's
364.76s: actually why I ended up at this so when
367.76s: I first put this on it was a little
370.20s: light on the Deltas it was like a 70
373.04s: something Delta I typically prefer 80
374.88s: plus but again liquidity kind of drove
376.76s: me in that direction now when I first
379.68s: sold calls against the position that's
381.92s: actually this line item here you'll
384.44s: notice that I only sold 10 why did I
386.84s: only sell 10 well it's because I wanted
390.40s: to see more follow through and I started
394.08s: to see it but then it kind of just
395.64s: started trading sideways for a while and
397.96s: actually during a couple conversations
399.52s: with the pro Community I was talking
401.68s: about unwinding this position for a
403.84s: small profit because it hadn't yet done
405.84s: what I wanted and it was getting a
408.76s: little bit long in the trade because I
412.52s: originally wanted to manage this
413.92s: position before we came into earnings on
416.24s: 25 April now I was okay to through
420.20s: earnings if we had a sustained move and
422.64s: it looks like we still are having a
424.20s: pretty decent move but it's not quite
426.48s: enough and I also have some travel
428.00s: coming up so that leads into a little
429.48s: bit of the decision to unwind but going
431.36s: back to the choice on the ratio that's
434.12s: why it was so light because I was
436.56s: sacrificing the money UPF front because
438.64s: I really wanted to try to maximize my
441.12s: upside potential in the
442.92s: position and I collected 60 cents on
446.40s: that so it was 600 bucks and those were
448.88s: uh$ 32 Delta and obviously over the life
452.48s: cycle of this trade they actually fell
454.16s: in the money so if we go to 20 march
457.32s: here you'll see that's where the
459.64s: position was managed and that is right
465.44s: here and essentially what I wanted to do
469.60s: was roll out and up to give me some more
472.64s: upside potential to see if I could you
475.08s: know get the calls a little bit out of
476.60s: the money but keep the ratio I didn't
478.44s: want to add any size cuz I wanted the
480.08s: upside profit potential so that's what I
482.64s: ended up doing I was able to take the
484.36s: 34s to 35s I had them out to 19 April
489.00s: and I collected 88 cents so a small
491.28s: credit on those of 20 cents same size
494.00s: and obviously those fell deep in the
495.80s: money these came off today the 11th of
499.72s: April for 435 so the total aggregate p&l
503.08s: on the short call side of the trade did
504.88s: nothing but serve as drag on my returns
507.52s: it was a 35
509.92s: loss in total so fortunately sometimes
514.60s: when you get these really big powerful
516.28s: moves the short calls as you would
518.28s: expect they really decrease our return
521.36s: profile now what ended up happening in
524.76s: the position I started with like I said
528.56s: it's around like a 78% allocation I was
532.04s: targeting around
533.56s: 75% and then I saw this next breakout so
537.36s: I had another alert set for any anything
539.76s: above this 3522 handle and we saw it on
544.16s: the 28th of March we saw a slight uptick
547.24s: and volume not quite as much as we saw
549.60s: earlier but still enough that it
551.40s: registered for me so in this case I
554.36s: chose to add a little bit to the
556.36s: position and that's what you see down
558.52s: here so I added five of this of the same
562.44s: exact contract for
564.56s: $632 so that took my aggregate basis to
567.72s: $455 Total investment at this point is
571.28s: 22735 I was actually saving a little bit
573.68s: more room to scale in again if I just
577.00s: started seeing volume fly off the handle
579.48s: this is a little bit of a mistake and
582.24s: the reason why it's a little bit of a
583.52s: mistake is because based on the amount
585.00s: of time I had left in this trade against
588.04s: my original premise if I were to scale
590.52s: in here again I probably would have gone
592.92s: with the rest of the allocation because
595.24s: it was a no risk trade at that point
597.44s: what I did was Slide the stop up from
600.68s: 3170 and change and all I did was bring
603.40s: it just below this really aggressive um
607.84s: consolidation period that we had here so
610.60s: it went to like 34 and change which
612.36s: would have locked in a profit and then I
614.68s: slid it up again to 3526 actually on
618.00s: this day the very next day and from
620.20s: there I just start using the moving
621.72s: averages to follow the trend so my game
625.84s: plan because of the constraint for
627.68s: timing I was going to use use this
630.44s: expiration or this expiration this
632.12s: moving average as my exit which is just
634.00s: a 9 or a 10 day 10 day so that led me to
638.68s: today where we fell off a bit I see the
643.00s: candle today it still looked pretty
644.96s: strong really light volume though I
646.88s: didn't love that so as I saw the day
649.44s: unfolding I ended up exiting today
651.56s: because it's at a good profit my next
653.60s: stop as you can see was moved up here to
656.48s: 3777 and the probability of this
660.20s: channeling sideways for a little bit
661.76s: before it regains some steam is moderate
663.92s: in my opinion and this realizes a pretty
667.08s: decent amount of profit right out of the
669.16s: gate so what I ended up doing was
671.44s: offloading all 50 of the 30 calls and
675.72s: again I bought them for an average of
678.08s: $455 and I ended up selling them for
682.56s: 910 average today so that takes the
686.24s: realized p&l on the long call to
690.72s: 22765 less the 3550 from the short calls
696.32s: so that takes the total p&l of the trade
699.48s: to
700.28s: 19,25 which is an
702.96s: 84.5% return on invested Capital so a
706.36s: couple notes that I want to highlight
707.92s: here specifically is I still think this
711.24s: rotation is likely in play however it
714.00s: might slow down a little bit with the
715.32s: current rate environment dragging out as
717.16s: it is and it wouldn't surprise me to see
719.80s: Capital starting to rotate back into
721.64s: Tech which is something that I'm keeping
723.44s: an eye on however we're at a really
725.68s: interesting Market position especially
728.12s: whenever we end up getting closer to
729.96s: this rate cut actually happening I think
732.56s: that you'll see things like this start
734.20s: to move even more still but this was a
736.60s: way essentially for me to gain exposure
738.80s: to Gold because this is one of the
740.84s: largest gold miners and it came up on a
743.84s: couple of my alerts so that was the
745.64s: trade I have a few others that I've
747.36s: actually talked to the Community about
750.72s: in different products but this one I
752.16s: thought was interesting because of two
753.76s: things one the mistake I made here and
756.04s: two because this is something that it
757.76s: was actually coming up on my time
759.64s: Horizon to manage this trade because it
762.20s: wasn't performing and I got a decent
764.48s: move it was running a small profit but
767.00s: it wasn't moving enough in order for it
769.04s: to make sense but I gave it just enough
772.20s: time that it started to pop out for me
774.24s: which is again ideally what we wanted to
776.64s: see here so that's the trade if you have
778.72s: any questions or anything that you want
779.88s: me to dive into about it just let me
781.44s: know happy to like subscribe share be an
783.28s: outlier see you guys later
