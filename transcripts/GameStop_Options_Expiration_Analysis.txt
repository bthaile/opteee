0.52s: what's up outliers Eric here today's all
2.44s: about GameStop I didn't do a dedicated
4.40s: video on this I actually have another
5.88s: one in the hopper for you all though
7.72s: about trading GameStop with options
10.32s: we've already done two videos so far
12.68s: that have talked about some strategies
14.16s: that I think are applicable to folks
15.68s: that like to trade this stock
16.96s: specifically and I have a couple more
18.60s: that I think might be suitable as always
21.36s: all of this is just for your general
22.56s: consumption the the entire reason why I
24.20s: do YouTube is to spread information you
26.56s: can figure out what's suitable what
28.08s: works for you what doesn't that's all
29.80s: good the hope is just to share ideas and
32.00s: information now the options expiration
35.76s: for today was a little bit lighter
38.76s: because this wasn't the
41.04s: densest series that exists right now
43.92s: when I say series I just mean expiration
45.96s: cycle so here we can see that the total
48.40s: open interest here was 148,000 calls and
51.56s: 58,000 puts which is actually a little
55.12s: bit on the lighter side now if we take a
57.44s: look at 20 D you can see that it's one 8
60.48s: at
61.28s: 42 the interesting thing is that the 17
64.52s: Jan is the spicy one so far this is
66.72s: where people are positioning and again I
68.68s: continue to highlight things as I see
70.92s: them which is important in that this is
73.28s: relatively new for GameStop typically
75.48s: speaking we see so much of the total
78.08s: open interest in the front expirations
80.00s: this has been about a month now that
82.12s: we've continually seen oi a little
85.32s: further out in time now it was up to 60
87.68s: days out when I first started noticing
89.32s: it now obviously the 17 Gen is about 35
92.16s: days to expiration but that's where most
93.48s: of this is which is again really
95.32s: interesting just because it's slightly
96.80s: different one of the things that you'll
98.64s: notice when we do any sort of options
100.52s: analysis or stock analysis for that
102.24s: perspective is you have to build a
104.96s: baseline understanding of what you're
106.84s: looking at what is normal is entirely
111.04s: relative to the stock that you're
112.52s: looking at so for example GameStop it's
115.44s: pretty normal at this point to have call
118.40s: oi exceed put oi
120.36s: if we take a look at something else by
122.00s: comparison like spy you'll notice it's
124.96s: the inverse you almost always will see
127.16s: put oi exceed call oi so you have to
131.56s: understand the individual ticker that
132.96s: you're looking at because there's unique
134.96s: qualities this to me is noteworthy not
139.32s: because calls exceed puts again that's
141.80s: generally the standard here but it's
143.88s: that the ratio between these that's now
146.36s: what I track for GameStop because I've
148.84s: identified that as an important trait
151.60s: between these normally when we see calls
154.76s: at a 2:1 ratio or greater that tends to
158.80s: be coupled with higher volatility which
161.12s: indicates an expectation of
163.24s: movement rightfully so because we just
166.00s: had earnings if we take a look at the
167.52s: chart funny enough we landed at$ 27.99
170.76s: that is an interesting number now I know
173.24s: for those that are really really into
175.40s: max pain and they think that that's like
176.96s: the dominant feature that continually
178.76s: forces GameStop to fall just below
180.96s: numbers that is a partial truth we can
184.20s: find instances like this where I
186.52s: absolutely would agree with that I would
188.56s: just be cautious to think that it's
191.08s: always max pain that always forces price
194.56s: to move One Direction or another because
196.68s: that starts to sabotage other potential
199.64s: inputs if we essentially prop one up as
203.12s: the dominant feature now what I can tell
205.40s: you cuz I've made videos about Max pain
207.68s: I've studied it pretty extensively not
209.28s: just from game stop but just is a
210.64s: general phenomenon which is interesting
212.72s: there is efficacy behind it meaning
214.76s: predictive qualities but it's not
216.72s: perfectly predictive there's a lot of
218.28s: variance in it but what I can tell you
220.76s: unanimously across different cases that
222.60s: I've studied is in these exact instances
225.96s: where we are very close it's more likely
229.16s: to occur but if you'll notice it's
230.44s: already above 28 so that's pretty
234.60s: interesting to me you'll tend to find
236.96s: this exact format when we're very close
240.08s: where it tends to be more pronounced so
242.68s: in this
243.72s: case seems a little seems a little
246.08s: something going on maybe who knows I
248.32s: don't know I'm just speculating here I'm
249.92s: just a dude on the internet let's take a
252.32s: look at the rest of the options chain
254.84s: actually before that let's take a look
255.96s: through the stock because I do want to
257.68s: talk about the chart here this I
260.80s: continue to see people feeling really
263.96s: upset about the stock price and I just
266.80s: don't see why the stock is doing really
270.40s: well the fact that this thing is
272.60s: hovering consistently post earnings in
276.36s: the high 20s just shy of 30 that's
279.60s: beautiful to me because it means that
282.00s: this runup that we experienced again
284.52s: wasn't driven by Mania wasn't driven by
286.68s: structural shorts covering or anything
288.24s: like that this was just was driven by
290.60s: people thinking this is worth more and
293.00s: consistently so and it's ebbing and
295.64s: flowing in the exact range that I would
297.60s: expect one of the things from a general
299.28s: Trading technical analysis perspective
300.96s: breakout trading that kind of stuff you
303.20s: try to look for things that have an
304.76s: extension in a consolidation and notice
307.96s: during the consolidation how this range
310.24s: is getting tighter so if I were to draw
314.32s: a couple lines on this thing maybe to to
316.32s: help show that point notice how this
320.16s: space
322.52s: here
325.40s: and this space here notice how this
328.24s: little area of congestion is
330.84s: consolidating down to a finer point this
334.16s: means that at this point the market is
338.16s: determining price consensus this is
340.64s: people saying I think it's worth 31 and
342.92s: change 32 I think it's worth up here
345.00s: then a bunch of people step in and say I
346.44s: think that's too high I'm going to bid
348.16s: it down I think it's worth less than
349.68s: that then it gets bid down bid down then
351.64s: enough people step in they're like okay
353.20s: well it might be worth less but I
354.64s: actually like it at 26 I'm going to buy
356.40s: it here and then they bid it back up and
358.28s: then the sellers say well I still think
360.84s: this might be a little bit High let me
362.32s: step in and sell at the 29 handle and
364.88s: then pushes it back down but then the
366.44s: buyers step in Faster they're like well
368.68s: hold on a second I actually really like
370.12s: it here 27 so on and so forth this is
372.80s: literally the visualization of supply
374.72s: and demand and price Discovery being
376.52s: played out real time now I know that
377.96s: there's a lot of issues with price
380.04s: Discovery and something like GameStop
381.40s: through internalization and stuff like
382.96s: that totally understand that point I'm
384.80s: talking from a general charting
386.80s: perspective for those that don't
388.60s: understand what this generally means so
392.44s: that I actually think is great I'm I'm
394.24s: really really stoked on that I want to
396.00s: see the floor on the stock continue to
399.24s: move higher because that means that
400.76s: consensus is moving higher and higher
402.56s: take a look at this not all that long
404.24s: ago we were literally talking about the
406.60s: floor including a 1932 handle right
409.60s: because that's where we barely touched
412.28s: dumped through here we hit it here here
414.56s: we we've touched this a few times but
416.04s: then it slowly is drifted up and out of
418.04s: there which is fantastic so that's
420.20s: really cool I already did a video
421.84s: talking about GameStop earnings which
423.20s: was pretty solid they came in at a
425.04s: slight profit although again the market
427.04s: wasn't necessarily super impressed with
428.80s: the profit and again rightfully so
431.28s: because most of it came from interest
433.28s: earned on their cash horde which is
435.16s: great but again from a a Trader investor
438.28s: perspective we don't necessarily want to
440.36s: see a company making a bunch of money
442.52s: from holding cash that happens to earn a
444.56s: yield because rates are high right now
446.48s: we want to see sales revenue we want to
449.76s: see the business growing so that's not
452.72s: to belittle the earnings the earnings
454.68s: was great it was a slight beat which is
456.64s: awesome but I still think that's why we
459.24s: didn't see that beat lead to some sort
462.00s: of massive move because I do think as we
465.48s: start to see GameStop have stronger
467.40s: earnings as it continues to evolve I
470.36s: absolutely expect to see things like
471.84s: post earnings announcement drift exist
473.80s: in something like this and for those
475.80s: that are
476.84s: unfamiliar I have a couple videos that
479.00s: talk about post earnings announcement
480.36s: Drift But post earnings announcement
482.16s: drift it tends to happen when you have a
484.56s: company that has a big earnings beat so
487.24s: if you take a look here the earnings was
488.60s: 95 cents it came in at a125 that's a big
491.44s: beat and then it's typically followed if
494.00s: it's going to exhibit post earnings
495.40s: announcement drift to the positive side
497.28s: it's typically coupled with a gap right
499.68s: so it typically means that there's some
501.20s: sort of really new news that's led to
504.32s: repricing and re-evaluation of the value
506.52s: of a stock and that tends to carry out
508.36s: over time because it's not immediately
510.00s: priced in big big sources of money take
513.48s: some time to move around so that's post
516.28s: earnings announcement drift and I would
518.16s: not be surprised at all to see GameStops
520.32s: start exhibiting that once it starts
521.96s: having slightly stronger earnings but I
524.04s: think it's why even though they had a
525.76s: beat in this instance it didn't
528.28s: necessarily Drive uh poster his
530.44s: announcement drift one way or the other
532.32s: because of that so back to the options
535.88s: chain we have really light volatility I
539.12s: mean it's it's essentially sub 100
540.76s: across all of it the front is always
542.36s: going to be jacked up but the next
544.24s: period that we see is the 17 Gen 25s
546.12s: which is just above 100% so very very
548.36s: quiet very quiet which I do find
551.56s: slightly interesting if we take a look
552.96s: at the volume heavy heavy call volume
555.80s: today but a lot of that is sales this
558.20s: will happen notice how this purple here
560.68s: this is 13 DS so these are people that
563.44s: are closing out their calls in this
565.60s: front expiration and potentially moving
567.76s: them into another expiration cycle so
570.68s: the way we can track that is if you take
572.08s: a look 181,000 calls if we take a look
575.36s: at the front itself that's
577.52s: 84,000 and then we can see 50 about
580.80s: 51,000 here and about 24,000 here so
584.80s: there's a strong likelihood that a
586.92s: decent amount of the volume today was
588.88s: closing out front positions moving them
590.64s: a little further out in time very very
592.08s: common to maintain exposure to the stock
594.40s: itself now taking a look at overall
596.92s: options flow which you all know this is
598.64s: more my world this is what I pay very
600.36s: very close attention to we already
602.04s: talked about this slightly anomalous
603.72s: trade that we saw that was out in 17
607.04s: April of 25 the 35s now it's it's
612.00s: labeled as none no side meaning we don't
614.40s: know exactly where it transacted but if
616.56s: we take a look at the price the price it
619.04s: transacted at was 540 the bid was 535 at
622.80s: the time the offer was 575 and with a
625.28s: bigger trade like this in terms of size
627.60s: way more likely that this would have
628.80s: been on the side but we don't know it
630.52s: absolutely could have been a purchase
632.16s: meaning to open contracts but it does
635.20s: look like this is probably more likely a
638.84s: sale of options as compared to a buy
640.60s: that's what it looks like that also
642.36s: would line up pretty well with what
645.04s: we're seeing on the chart meaning the
647.60s: stock has had a pretty big runup
649.28s: recently so this absolutely would be
651.56s: very logical profit taking um but it's
654.56s: just it's a pure guess I genuinely do
656.36s: not know and as always I don't like to
658.84s: share
659.96s: opinions with stuff like this I much
661.92s: prefer to share objective information
664.64s: and then allow you to figure out what
667.12s: you think it is versus my perception of
669.68s: it but we can see that the size here
672.00s: 3350 this isn't something that they
673.96s: phased in or out of so this was
676.04s: something that was able to to float
677.60s: right across meaning there was enough
679.16s: liquidity for this to go through as a
681.32s: bundle order which is great now the
684.48s: other thing that I did see people
685.92s: talking about with some of these 125s
688.40s: one of the things to know with something
690.88s: like the 125
692.84s: strikes is for a lot of different
695.84s: entities this is used for managing risk
699.80s: we call it units unit building and it's
703.04s: because you can buy a lot of options for
707.20s: a little amount of money that will have
710.16s: lower
711.52s: overall extrinsic value although on a
714.76s: relative basis the Theta Decay will be
716.96s: very high if you have no idea what I
718.64s: just said listen to it a couple times
720.80s: and then you can reach out to us and the
722.48s: Discord is completely free to join but
724.68s: that's an important point now this does
729.04s: not surprise me at all and this is also
731.48s: a big reason why we continue to see the
733.60s: far out of the monies being populated
736.76s: both by my expectation being
738.80s: institutions and Retail Traders alike I
741.00s: don't think it's one or the other I
742.04s: think it's both of them and I think they
743.72s: both have their specific reasons for
745.80s: doing so now for the retail trading
748.36s: perspective it's typically a tough
749.88s: position to take on because retail
751.52s: Traders tend to have smaller Bank roles
753.60s: so then when they put on these positions
755.28s: that are very low hit rate that's the
757.32s: nature of this style trade this is the
759.96s: kind of trade that you put on a 100
761.48s: times and you expect it to hit twice
763.32s: something like that now for a smaller
766.16s: retail Trader if you put this on 100
767.92s: times and you miss 60 something in a row
771.20s: that can erode your bank roll depending
772.88s: on how you're sizing the trades for
774.76s: larger institutions they literally
776.64s: amortise out how many times they expect
779.28s: to hit on some sort of move that they
781.08s: can monetize to make sure that they're
783.12s: positively expected but the only way you
785.00s: can achieve that kind of risk-reward
786.52s: profile and positive expected return
788.40s: from this is to have a large enough
789.96s: bankroll and and to size appropriately
793.16s: which I think a lot of retail Traders
795.24s: unfortunately don't do so that's what
797.84s: we're seeing looks generally quiet solid
800.56s: earnings interesting close to the stock
803.84s: today at
805.24s: $27.99 uh just kind of comical to me and
808.72s: we have the the gme live stream tomorrow
810.44s: we're going to continue going through
812.20s: literally the entire due diligence
814.28s: Library this I forgot what episode were
817.24s: on I think for the GameStop series I
820.16s: think this is going coming up on 23 or
822.72s: something like that which is kind of
823.88s: nuts because if you think about it I'm
825.40s: doing it every single Saturday and
828.88s: there's four Saturdays in a month so it
831.00s: tells you we've been looking at this for
832.40s: quite a while now we started really
834.00s: analyzing raring Kitty traits now I'm
836.36s: literally going through the entire due
838.00s: diligence library from literally from
840.00s: the beginning and this is how I like to
842.20s: learn stuff I don't like to take
843.80s: people's word for things I like to hear
845.92s: opinions I like to hear what people see
847.60s: but then I like to see it myself I like
848.96s: to go look for it because it allows me
851.24s: to objectively evaluate stuff and it
853.24s: also lets me learn more that isn't
855.84s: passed through the game of telephone and
859.64s: the funny thing to me is I think a lot
861.52s: of people that have been in GameStop way
863.56s: longer than I than I have like the true
865.72s: Apes out there probably are learning a
867.76s: lot during the series as well because
869.92s: there's a lot of due diligence with a
872.56s: lot of detail so it's been pretty fun
874.92s: going through that I'm looking forward
876.16s: to it if there's anything you want me to
878.12s: take a look at you can always hit me up
880.08s: in the comments in the Discord you can
881.44s: shoot me an email whatever makes you
882.76s: happy makes me happy be an outlier I'll
885.08s: see y'all later
