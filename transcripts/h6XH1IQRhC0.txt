0.00s: Why am I so obsessed with the outlier concept and why you should be too?
5.60s: The goal of this video is to walk you through exactly that. I want to level set with some
10.08s: basics of the outlier concept, some statistics to help elucidate the point, and then at the end
16.48s: of the video I'm going to walk you through two things. Some of the exact steps I took to become one,
21.44s: and then literally, quite literally, a near bulletproof plan to become one if you're able to follow
28.56s: it, which spoiler alert, most people aren't, but that's the goal of this video, is to change the way
34.40s: you look at your financial well-being. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers.
41.04s: Let's start with why I'm even talking about this. Well, for those that don't know, I grew up poor,
46.88s: had a single mom, she worked two jobs, I grew up in a shitty area, the same old story. That's not
51.76s: really important because that's just a starting point. However, by my late 20s, I was already a first
58.16s: generation self-made millionaire. Now, in my early 30s and 32 now, I'm a multi-millionaire.
63.36s: Not some big flex, it's to walk you through how changing your perspective can change your outcomes.
71.12s: So let's get into that. What's the probability of becoming a millionaire in the US? It's 8.8%.
76.88s: You might look at that and say, wow, that's pretty low. Not high, so it's clearly not
80.80s: granted. However, if you look at that compared to something like becoming an MBA player, 48 out of
86.40s: 155,955 high school players make it to the MBA. For those that are not math inclined, that is 0.03%.
94.56s: That's your probability of becoming an MBA player. Not that great. So when we think about this,
99.84s: that's actually pretty achievable. And we're going to talk about exactly how to land there.
104.56s: So first, let's level set on what an outlier is. This is just a standard definition.
110.16s: It's a person or thing differing from all other members of a particular group or set. And in a
116.48s: graphical way, this is kind of how you can visualize it. We have the average data sample over here.
122.32s: And then we have a positive skew outlier all the way out here to the right. You can also have negative
128.08s: skew outliers all the way over here to the left. But guess what? None of our concern. We are focused
133.04s: on this benchmark. When I was going through school undergrad, grad, my time in the Marine Corps,
138.56s: I never cared at all about what the minimum was. That is not how my mind works. I wanted to know
145.84s: what the maximum was for everything. This one small change in the way that you view things can have
152.24s: a massive impact on how your life unfolds. If you chase the minimum or if you chase the average,
160.00s: you might get there. That's not the goal. So now let's talk about some other statistical
166.08s: phenomena. What do you think the probability is of you starting a successful business? You nailed it.
171.60s: 17%. Now, obviously, this is a range. This is just a specific example from LinkedIn. But the point
177.44s: being it's not a slam dunk either. And fun fact, the probability of starting a successful business
184.08s: that then goes on to make you a millionaire is smaller than this. So how do we do this? Let's talk
191.04s: about it. The first thing is by understanding the landscape. So what's the median earnings by age?
198.32s: Well, for my reference period, 32 years old, it's $53,000 per year. Yeah, not much the right home
204.80s: about. What is the average in median household wealth by age? For those that don't know, they have to
211.04s: use median because the outliers skew the average so much. So you have to pick the midpoint. So in
219.28s: this case, if you look at the average and median household wealth by age, I'm 32, the average is
226.24s: $95,000. The median is $29,000. This is the reality for most people. We can continue the example.
235.04s: The average retirement age is 64 years old. The average life expectancy is 77 years old.
240.64s: Looks like 13 years to me. Now, to be clear, the goal of retirement, in my opinion, is not to just
247.28s: stop working and become a succubus in the world around you. It's to be able to pivot your time and
252.88s: effort, your resources onto the things that you really are passionate about because for those that
258.48s: don't know, at least as far as we know, you get one shot at this thing called life. So doing things
264.48s: like this, sharing this kind of information with people gives me purpose. So my hope is that you'll
270.48s: follow along with me. So now I want to talk to you about this idea on how to become an outlier.
278.00s: The very first thing, as I already mentioned, is you have to completely change your standards.
282.40s: The way that you think about things matters tremendously so. So if you right now focus on things as
290.24s: what can I do to get by? What is the minimum I can do in order to get the best possible outcome?
296.72s: There's a little bit of optimization there and I don't hate that. However, if you do not have high
302.40s: standards, you're going to land where average people land. That's just how it works. So next,
308.08s: we need to think about our reference benchmarks. I don't know if I said that right. Reference
313.28s: benchmarks. And what I mean by this is this right here. Why do I use outliers part of my brand?
319.92s: Why do I call us the outlier community? It's for this. It's to start engraining these concepts
326.56s: with you immediately because we are a product of who we surround ourselves by. So if you're hanging
333.60s: out with people that are just balling out going to the club, spending all their money, that's probably
338.48s: what you're going to do too. So by getting around the right people is absolutely essential. Now,
345.12s: the kind of people you need to find yourself around and one of the key habits you must learn to
351.84s: embrace is delayed gratification. This is where you willingly forego near term gratification,
359.12s: buying that thing you want and embracing delayed gratification instead saving that money
366.48s: for the future, investing that money because in a little bit, I'm going to show you how just this
373.04s: right here can make you a millionaire again, essentially without fail as long as you can adhere to
379.44s: the plan. So next up, we have favoring the process over the outcome. If you are overly outcome driven
386.88s: when that outcome doesn't happen quickly enough, we tend to get disenfranchised. So learning early
392.40s: on to favor the process is absolutely pivotal in our capacity to remain loyal to the process long
400.72s: term. We need to take a proactive approach to our life. If you do not accept ownership for everything
408.16s: around you as much as humanly possible, this won't work for you. If you are the kind of person that
413.60s: blames other things for things, this isn't for you. If you're late to work and your excuse is,
420.00s: oh, there was traffic, that is, I'm telling you, the wrong mindset. So the problem here is that a lot
426.08s: of people apply a reactive approach to life and you get a reactive outcome. Got two more for you
433.12s: here. The next one is habits and discipline. This is really what feeds this process and the way to
439.44s: think about discipline is pretty simple. The way you do one thing is the way you're going to do
445.76s: most things. And in order to pull all of this together, we have to plan. You have to plan effectively.
452.16s: So now let's do just a little bit of planning. If we pop over to my website and we take a look at
457.84s: this resource section, there's a section here that says do traders make money. And you'll see a
462.40s: few things. The first one is seven percent of traders remain in the market after five years.
467.92s: That's not super great. Here we are seeking to understand the landscape. The average trader
474.24s: underperforms the market by six and a half points on average. So most traders underperform the market.
481.44s: 93% of traders quit within five years, just the inverse of that. And then this one, there are even
486.16s: traders that continue beyond the five year mark that still are not profitable. So how do we plan
492.00s: successfully? Simple. You embrace something like this. So again, if you go to my website and you go
497.68s: here to the compound interest calculator, here is a scenario. If you have $25,000 of principle and you
503.28s: save $500 per month for 27 years at a 10% return, you are going to become millionaire. It is just math.
510.56s: How do we accelerate this? Well, we get better at trading. And instead of 10% per year, which is
516.80s: about the average for the S&P 500, depending on your reference period, maybe we get this up to 15%
522.16s: per year. Then all of a sudden, you're now almost 2.8 millionaire in that time frame. So then maybe
527.60s: instead of 20 years, you're 27, you could take it down to 20 years and notice you're a millionaire
532.48s: in that time frame. Maybe you get better at saving. And instead of $500, you're able to save $1000.
538.48s: Maybe we could take this down now even further to 17 years. Still a millionaire. So there are
544.96s: different levers you can pull on to accelerate this time frame for you. The concept of becoming an
551.52s: outlier is well within your reach. It comes down purely to your mindset. We all have different
558.40s: starting points. Some people start more disadvantaged or advantaged. That you cannot control, but you
563.68s: can fully control how you react to your current scenario and change your outcomes. Like,
569.84s: subscribe, share, be an outlier. See you guys later.
