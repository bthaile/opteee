0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.56s: Quick market update.
2.56s: Two things on the agenda.
3.90s: First we have Visa with its new antitrust lawsuit coming out, which we'll talk about quickly.
10.52s: And then we're going to take a look at you, meaning Unity, because there's a lot of talk
18.08s: about some trades flowing in that are of interesting size, meaning 5,000 lot options trades.
25.56s: That's actually popped up earlier for me today.
28.96s: And I think it's kind of interesting to keep an eyeball on.
32.08s: So let's start with Visa.
36.08s: What's going on here?
37.08s: Well, it's pretty straightforward.
40.00s: So you can see that the Justice Department accuses Visa of stifling competition in the
45.56s: debit hard business.
48.80s: So why does this matter?
50.44s: Well, it essentially shows that the Justice Department is starting to attack some of these
59.04s: perceived monopolies.
61.12s: I don't exactly want to go as far as to call it as a monopoly, but you can see that Visa
65.84s: controls more than 60% of debit card processing.
70.04s: And this is one of the really interesting factors that go into a economy and overall capitalistic
77.84s: structure like we have here is where is that line drawn between letting good businesses
83.60s: grow and thrive versus good businesses being given excess advantages that then allow
90.32s: them to dominate a landscape.
92.92s: And it's a really interesting discussion to be had.
96.12s: But we can see here, it says Visa handles more than 60% of debit card transactions and
101.32s: collects more than 7 billion in annual processing fees.
106.56s: And it uses its market power to stifle competition, which again, in a capitalistic society that
112.72s: doesn't necessarily surprise me.
115.44s: And it says we alleged that Visa has unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far
120.20s: exceed what it could charge in a competitive market.
122.84s: And this is kind of the interesting balance between regulation and free capitalistic society.
129.00s: It's not an easy answer.
130.60s: And I'm not here to weigh in on it.
132.04s: I'm here just to show you what it says.
134.12s: It says merchants and banks pass along those costs to consumers, right?
139.16s: Pass through costs either by raising prices or reducing quality of service to decrease
144.16s: the cost it makes to make it.
145.76s: So this essentially is alleging that Visa's conduct ultimately impacts the consumer and
153.48s: that this is spread into just about everything.
155.96s: Now, what I find slightly interesting here is if we take a look at this and I'm not super
162.76s: positive on this source, I'm just looking for some numbers.
167.28s: And it says essentially in 2021, we can see credit card purchase volume is like 52.5%.
175.40s: So that's actually meaning that there is a pretty significant amount of debit card transactions
183.28s: that happen.
184.28s: And I just find that generally interesting because that really bolsters this argument that
188.80s: there's a pretty significant market here that Visa is looking to dominate.
193.40s: So we can see that merchants are on board because obviously they just pass through the cost
197.32s: anyway.
198.32s: They generally don't care.
200.24s: And it says Tuesday's lawsuit is not the first time Visa's run a foul of the Justice
204.16s: Department four years ago, the government suits a block visa from acquiring a Fintech
208.80s: company, Plaid, which most of us are familiar with.
211.68s: And it says if you the 5.3 billion takeover as an insurance policy to prevent Plaid from
216.24s: infringing on its lucrative debt debit card.
218.72s: And again, that's the, this is something that we saw through Facebook previously
223.96s: now meta that they used to literally buy companies and just nuke the company to get rid
230.00s: of the competition.
231.00s: And again, it's really hard to say in a theoretical standpoint, if that's good, if that's bad,
236.36s: if that is capitalistic, if it's not, if there should be regulation.
240.44s: And these are the arguments that are going to be had by people of different opinions.
244.52s: But what I can tell you is that there is a tradable event here.
250.12s: So we now have Visa that is down 5.5% today, big, big, big sale volume.
258.56s: And we can see that it was doing great right before this news.
261.92s: And the way that this is going to work now is volatility has already started to creep
266.48s: up.
267.48s: We can see implied volatility percentiles now at 81%.
270.64s: So for me, I look at it very simply is how can I trade this?
274.28s: Again, theoretical, existential conversations aside about what we think is right or wrong,
279.04s: completely different.
280.04s: That's a different part of my brain.
281.60s: This part of my brain is like, how do we trade this?
283.68s: And there's lots of ways to trade it.
285.20s: Now, we can trade a directional move here assuming that this move might continue or depending
291.20s: on how it behaves over the next day or so.
293.00s: We can see if it starts to rebound and rally right back up.
297.00s: So this could be a buy the rumor sell the news kind of scenario.
302.36s: We don't know just yet, but what I can tell you is that catalysts like this offer interesting
308.20s: opportunities.
309.20s: So I'm keeping a really close eye on this to see how it materializes.
313.32s: I wouldn't trade it on a day like today other than intraday following it.
316.88s: But we have to see how all this is digested and then the market's perception of essentially
320.44s: what will happen here, which is TBD obviously.
324.16s: So now if you take a quick look at the options, change that a curiosity.
328.48s: We can see a few things.
330.48s: We can see volume on the put side definitely expanded today.
334.52s: And you can see that a lot of it where people buying puts 22% came in and rightfully so scooping
340.48s: up the downside opportunity.
341.88s: They're playing the 20 step expiration.
343.96s: That's where all this volume was today.
345.12s: It's people hedging existing positions.
346.80s: It's people gaining exposure to play it to the downside.
349.80s: But here's what I want to see is how much this call put OI starts to change because it's
356.00s: been maintaining call skew.
357.36s: So I tracked Visa pretty regularly and this is its normal configuration where it's pretty
362.16s: bullish in terms of the options chain.
364.32s: But we can see that it's starting to get a little bit more interesting.
368.08s: And what I found even more interesting is that if we take a look at some of these net
373.12s: change day over day on this three, well previously would have been four DTE yesterday when
379.40s: these were added can help.
381.20s: But notice there's some pretty good ads here.
384.20s: I see 1700 contracts that were added at the 285 puts 1800.
390.60s: This is from yesterday to today.
392.20s: This isn't accounting for today and tomorrow.
394.68s: So there's some people that had an idea of what's going on, which is always entertaining
401.52s: to see.
402.52s: Gotta be honest with you.
403.52s: Love that about options markets though is that people that have leverage want to express
407.84s: an idea.
408.84s: And people who typically are informed seek leverage because then they can express an idea
413.76s: and make more money.
415.08s: Good old greed.
416.84s: It never goes out of style.
419.04s: So that's that.
420.92s: Next up we have you.
423.84s: And you is something I'm not super tied into.
427.64s: This is maybe something that we need to spend a little bit more time on during the meme
431.10s: stock trading live stream tomorrow.
434.60s: Later today is the outlier pro live stream.
437.32s: But this one is interesting just because it popped up on a few scans that I tend to run
443.64s: and it's had really interesting behavior.
445.64s: So if we look at volume today, it's had insane.
449.68s: Insane call volume 262,000 calls traded against 37 36,400 puts not even able to round
459.16s: that up in good faith.
460.88s: So massive massive call volume today.
463.52s: If we look at the open interest, it has massive call OI versus put a lie.
468.32s: So these are people that are just loading up full port upside.
473.24s: 36% of the calls transacted today, 36% were at the offer or above.
479.08s: This is people that are expressing a directional opinion using calls leverage.
483.52s: That's exactly what's going on here.
485.60s: Then if we take a look here, we see this.
489.84s: If I look over the last couple days, I look at yesterday and today in you and I'm looking
495.84s: at calls that were purchased at the offer or above.
499.48s: And I'm looking for single leg trades only not looking for spreads.
503.36s: What do we see?
504.36s: Well, we see a few blocks of 5,000 rolling in.
508.08s: And again, the reason why this is always topical is because folks immediately want to tie
512.80s: 5,000 blocks to roaring kitty.
515.44s: And it's because of what happened in GME come the summer of this year.
521.20s: And so I understand why that speculation tends to arrive.
524.84s: And it's really interesting though, because we see those 5,000 blocks at a couple different
530.36s: strikes over a few different days.
533.84s: That part I genuinely do find interesting.
536.32s: So if I sort these instead by premium, if I sort them by time really quick, we can see
541.40s: that throughout the day, there's a bunch of small trades, right?
545.08s: 10,000, 20,000, 2,000 tons of these smaller trades that don't really mean that much to
552.64s: us.
553.64s: But then if we sort it by premium, all of a sudden we see that we get these blocks of
558.28s: 5,000 that drift up to the top.
560.64s: We can see them starting on the 23rd for sure.
563.60s: And there were a few tranches.
565.00s: So I see 1257, 1259 from yesterday, the 23rd, 1254, 1252.
572.04s: And this is at the 15, the 20.
574.96s: And then I see the 20 and the 20.
577.32s: So it looks like somebody getting exposure to a few different spots here.
581.80s: But if we look at the dollar value on these, all of a sudden we are massively sized.
586.44s: We've gone from looking at stuff that's a few 10,000s of dollars to a couple that are
592.52s: hundreds of thousands, a couple half a million dollar trades.
596.12s: And then all of a sudden we have trades that are several million dollars.
601.12s: This is not a small position.
602.68s: That's all there is to it.
604.96s: This looks like at least two different positions being built.
609.04s: So we can see some of the 15s that are being built out in 2025.
613.64s: And then we can see some that are being built out in 15, no 24.
617.80s: That's what these are.
619.32s: So whether or not that's the same person, different person.
621.60s: Again, it's a crap shoot.
622.60s: Really, really difficult to tell.
624.32s: But what I can tell you is that these 15s are being hit in a few different spots.
630.96s: Because I see the 15s here on 17, Jan 25, I see the 15s here on 15, no 24.
637.92s: And then I see the 15s here on again 17, Jan 25.
641.96s: And then I see the 15s with the slightly smaller trade out in 25 again.
646.16s: And then if I look at the 20s, we see them in 25 here.
651.72s: We see them 15, no 24, 25 again.
656.12s: So this is kind of a split of different things.
658.32s: Now for people that think that this is roaring kitty, again, I don't blame you for thinking
663.48s: and who knows who it could be.
665.04s: But I do highly recommend check out the series that we've been doing on Saturday, the GameStop
670.60s: series, because I literally started going what three weeks ago, we went all the way back.
676.32s: And we're right now still in the process of it.
678.08s: The next one is this coming Saturday.
679.88s: We're literally going trade by trade to see what he did when what the market looked like,
686.00s: what he did all the way back to the very beginning of his Reddit profile.
689.20s: The reason is I call it fingerprinting.
691.60s: It lets me get an understanding of how something looks behaves that's unique to that thing,
696.40s: in this case, that thing being our boy, roaring kitty.
700.72s: So while this could be the cat, I don't instinctually see him here based on what I've seen
705.72s: him do previously, meaning when I've seen him establish and change previous positions,
710.64s: it's not across a bunch of different explorations across a bunch of different strikes.
714.32s: What I've seen, he tends to layer into something.
717.68s: And then when he wants to add more exposure, she'll layer into something else.
721.12s: But this is all about the giant caveat.
722.76s: We're not done yet.
723.76s: Right now, like I said, in that series, I think we're still in, we're at the end where
728.32s: there be the end of 21 or the beginning of 2022.
731.40s: So we're getting there, but we still have a ways to go.
734.24s: But all I'm saying is this looks a little bit different than what I've seen so far.
738.00s: Does that mean it can't be him?
739.00s: Of course not.
740.00s: It could be.
741.00s: Every time we see 5,000 lot trades that it is him, also absolutely not.
746.40s: There are, there's a human tendency to use round numbers.
750.84s: You'll see things like this, this is a bigger trade for sure, but you'll see 5,000 blocks,
756.00s: 2,500 blocks, 10,000 blocks.
758.72s: Those are just instinctual numbers that people use when you're trading at larger sizes.
763.92s: So if you decide that you're going to put on a bigger position that's worth a few million
767.84s: dollars, you're kind of backed into a trade, right?
771.48s: Like a standard sizing.
773.44s: Most people are not coming in to put in a trade that's, you know, 1,526.
778.08s: It's going to be a round number more often than not.
781.12s: That's why if we take a look at these strikes in unity, you'll notice the same thing I
785.88s: try to draw your eye to pretty frequently.
788.24s: Where if we go to these round number strikes, they're almost always more active than other
794.52s: strikes in terms of open interest.
796.88s: And that's because of this very natural tendency.
799.04s: So for example, if I look at these 25 calls in 18 oct, there's 11,900 of them.
806.24s: Then if I go to the 30s, round number, there's 47,000 of them.
811.00s: Then if I go into the 20s, round number again, kind of moving in five dollar lots here,
816.12s: there's 11,000 of them.
818.00s: So even though there's options that are much better closer to the money, like these,
822.04s: they're still smaller size than something like the 20s or the 25s of the 30s.
826.96s: Human tendency.
827.96s: You'll see this all the time and options markets.
829.96s: So I would always say approach things with an open mind.
833.04s: Who knows what's happening, but also understand the landscape.
836.32s: And this kind of thing is very, very normal.
838.60s: So we got to see what's going on with you though, because it is definitely starting to get
843.52s: a bit of legs underneath it.
845.56s: We'll take a closer look at it tomorrow during the live stream.
847.96s: As always, anything you want me to take a look at, let me know, be an outlier.
850.76s: I'll see you all later.
