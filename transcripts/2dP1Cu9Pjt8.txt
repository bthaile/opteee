0.00s: What's up outliers today?
2.54s: We are going to talk about the absolute best option strategy.
8.38s: I'm going to walk you through seven traits that we need to look for to identify what we
15.14s: would consider to be the best.
17.02s: And then I'm going to give you some ideas to think about with respect to actual strategies
23.32s: that might fit the bill for us.
25.62s: Now, as you know, options are very complex.
29.50s: However, they offer a exposure to a lot of really interesting ways to make money.
34.82s: So when we're looking at the best option strategy, one of the most important elements of
41.98s: this is something that can trade different market conditions because the market goes
48.46s: through different regimes.
52.14s: If we pop over to the platform and we take a look at a five year weekly chart in SPX,
60.34s: you can see that most of the time SPX is upwards trending.
66.34s: So bullish direction.
68.22s: However, you can also see that there are periods like 2022, which is this entire time
74.56s: for you in here where it actually declined.
79.22s: So being able to trade multiple market conditions is going to be really, really important for
85.38s: the best option strategy.
87.22s: We need something that we can consistently make money off of that reliability is one of
93.78s: the most important elements of a strategy because if it's something that regularly produces
101.02s: the results that we expect and they're positively expectant, meaning they're profitable,
105.62s: then it's something we can continue doing in the future, which is really important must
110.06s: have.
111.38s: We want to see things that have larger winning trades relative to the losing positions.
120.02s: Why is this important?
121.02s: Well, it's for convexity.
123.58s: One of the issues with really high win rate strategies here, high win rate strategies is
131.38s: although they win a lot, they tend to win not that much money.
137.58s: So here's a great example of this.
139.38s: If we go into SPX and we go into short term options.
145.02s: So let's use these three day options for an example.
148.10s: I can come out here and we can go super far out of the money and I can sell these two
154.74s: delta puts and I can get like $90 for these two delta puts.
160.94s: So this means that the overwhelming probability is that these are going to expire out of the
166.14s: money.
167.14s: However, this is what we refer to as selling the tails because every once in a while you
173.58s: will get caught.
175.42s: Meaning there will be a big move and when you experience that one, but rare big move,
182.34s: it can wipe out multiples of winners, which is a big problem.
188.34s: Now this leads to our next point where we would prefer something that is undefined profit
193.90s: potential and that's simply because if we're correct in terms of our direction, we don't
200.22s: want to cap our potential losses to that to our potential gains to that same vein.
208.46s: We do want to cap our losses because again, going back to this scenario, if we choose
215.54s: to sell this 5765 put that expires in three days, let's analyze this trade and let's
222.58s: just say that there happens to be a massive move against us.
227.10s: Let's say that the market drops 15% come Monday because over the weekend, there's some
232.86s: really terrible news that comes out or even if it drops 10% or even 5%.
239.10s: What you'll notice is that even on a 5% decline while we're in here trying to make $85 or
244.42s: $90, we're going to lose 7,624.
249.14s: So the probability of SPX dropping this 5% over the weekend, opening Monday and then
255.06s: trending down is low, but you can literally do the math to see how many trades you would
262.42s: wipe out with this $1,7600 loser, which is like 89.
269.66s: So the issue with undefined losses is that they can rack up very, very quickly unless
276.34s: there's a control in place for them.
278.58s: We also would want something that benefits from ThaidedaK, which is the standard holding
284.14s: penalty for long options.
286.66s: And we would prefer something that benefits from Gamma because again, that provides convexity
292.70s: to our return, the ability for the actual return profile to accelerate.
297.50s: So now that we know the traits of the best option strategy, what fits the bill and this
305.10s: will be of absolutely no surprise to you.
309.38s: Nothing.
310.54s: Nothing fits this bill.
312.10s: There is no option strategy that does all of this.
317.70s: It doesn't exist.
320.46s: And this is the problem when we try to frame things like what is the best option strategy
328.14s: is we're trying to be lazy.
330.14s: We're trying to say what is the best thing I can do that always works optimally.
336.46s: Guess what?
337.46s: That doesn't exist.
338.94s: Now there's a benefit from all of this.
343.94s: You can absolutely build relative best option strategies.
352.34s: And we use something like the Outlier Strategy process to help us do this.
357.54s: I have a link that talks about this in detail in the notes below.
362.62s: But I want to review it quickly and show you an exact example of this concept.
368.34s: So the Outlier Strategy process, you will notice that there is absolutely a way to build
374.98s: a best strategy.
376.74s: The problem is the best strategy is going to be relative to specific profit mechanisms
384.06s: or market effects.
385.98s: You will not have something that provides the best across all forms because going back
393.18s: to this, we would prefer something that has large winners relative losses in ideally
399.26s: something with a high win rate.
401.54s: Those two don't typically go together.
404.02s: Same thing with wanting to benefit from theta decay but then also benefiting from gamma.
410.34s: Those two quickly go together.
412.82s: So the broader point here is if we take the time to isolate the actual profit mechanism,
420.50s: the market effect that we're trying to capitalize on, then we absolutely can find optimal structures
429.98s: that we turn into strategies for those very ideas.
433.50s: And I'm going to show you an example right now.
436.14s: So if we go back into the platform and now I actually want to go into on demand.
441.34s: And I want to go back in time to show you an example.
445.02s: And I'm going to show you an example in video because this is actually a position that
449.30s: I spoke to pretty much everybody about on different streams.
454.50s: And it's because in Nvidia, when deep seek R1 came out, there was this massive adverse
460.14s: reaction that led to a big decline.
463.06s: And my original response was wait and see how this goes.
466.90s: And the idea, the broader idea was eventually I would expect to see a recovery.
474.54s: It's just a hunch based on a bunch of different analysis, but that's the idea.
480.30s: So based on this hunch, there are a couple of different trades we can model.
485.46s: So if we go into the trade tab here and I will show you two different positions that
490.82s: we built using the 21 March and the 16 May option cycles.
496.38s: Let's go to the analyze tab to show you.
498.94s: So the first trade that I built was selling a 21 March, one 12 put, collecting $5.45.
510.10s: And let me scoot this up a little bit so that you can see the actual trade right there.
515.50s: So this is the trade.
517.18s: It's selling essentially a 26 delta put, which is a really high probability of making a decent
524.46s: amount of money.
525.46s: This is through a virtual account.
527.66s: So it's going to require regulation T margin.
534.14s: So in this case, it's asking us to put up 1,500 bucks in order to hold this position.
539.78s: If you were to cash, secure this put, you would need $11,200.
544.94s: Okay.
545.94s: So we have the short put on.
549.26s: Then comparatively, we use something similar to what I trade for directional breakouts,
555.34s: which is what we might consider this as it's breaking out on volume compared to the congestion
560.90s: zone over here.
562.38s: And we go out to the 16 May 120 calls.
566.10s: We buy those for 15 90 now right off the jump.
570.70s: You'll notice that this costs $1,590 to put on.
575.86s: This one only requires 1,500 bucks.
582.10s: So right from the get go, we can put on a bunch of these puts if we're so inclined.
588.66s: What's the downside of putting on a bunch of these puts?
590.90s: Well, if we start ramping up the size of this so that it's about the same size position,
596.82s: the issue we run into now is that if we do get a continuation and if Nvidia continues
604.26s: to trend down, had to update the date for you.
608.14s: But if Nvidia dips down 10%, you lose 3700 bucks.
613.30s: If it dips down 15%, you're now down 6800 bucks.
617.62s: Comparatively to this, if Nvidia dips down 5%, you lose 270.
622.34s: If it dips down 10%, you lose 592.
624.82s: It dips down 15%, you lose 865.
628.74s: So this immediately shows you the trade off of different options positions.
634.26s: So now I just want to fast forward time until as far forward as we can go, just for
638.90s: the example, and I just want to compare these different positions for you.
643.46s: Because if I size this back down to just kind of compare them on a one lot basis, I want
650.06s: to show you a couple things.
651.74s: Now I need to update the date and here again, let's go to the 19th.
655.78s: And so this long call at this point is showing us $952 profit.
662.98s: This short put is showing us $424 profit.
669.06s: So via the long call, again, we picked a favorable condition, but for this specific profit mechanism,
677.50s: we make more money with this long call.
679.82s: Now this still isn't optimized for exactly what happened.
683.98s: If we wanted to fully optimize for exactly what happened here, right, to overfit it entirely,
689.42s: you would have bought short dated calls that were out of the money.
693.26s: But the general point I'm trying to show you is that if we're trying to trade something
698.82s: that quote unquote is the best, and it means that we always do something, always buy an
704.62s: option, always sell an option.
706.90s: There are periods where both will underperform comparatively.
711.54s: And as a trader, you are so much better off outlining different profit mechanisms that
718.82s: you're going to attempt to trade.
720.46s: Again, in this case, the profit mechanism is a price reversion based on a breakout and
728.02s: overextension to the downside.
730.42s: So in that kind of context, if we understand what this kind of price movement typically
735.62s: looks like, we would naturally back into saying, well, selling a put here might cap me short.
742.78s: And if I sold the put at the same size as the long call, I'm taking a ton of risk
748.58s: on a relative basis because I am in the process of playing something to the upside that had
754.22s: a pretty vicious down move.
755.78s: And it can, as always, roll back over to the downside.
760.74s: So the best option strategy is going to be relative and built first around the profit
768.38s: mechanism you're trying to trade.
770.14s: And then the second something that fits in with your broader portfolio objectives.
776.86s: Be an outlier.
777.46s: See you later.
