0.00s: The worst possible time to determine when you should roll an option is when the trade is on.
5.36s: What that means is we should think about it ahead of time. So the goal of this video is to walk
9.76s: you through a formula on how you can think about rolling options. What the best time to roll an
16.00s: option is, but then most importantly, the different considerations you should think about as you're
21.60s: going through the process of rolling an option. Get right in. So very first thing is a market
28.24s: disposition. This is the same thing you'll see in most of my content. And it's because
31.92s: overviewing the market in your portfolio upfront is probably one of the most important steps you can
37.28s: take as a trader. It informs everything else that we're doing. So if I'm looking at any position
45.28s: and I'm thinking if I want to roll it, a big part of that is what do I think about the market?
50.64s: What do I think about the portfolio and how this position fits into the portfolio? All of that
55.52s: informs the way I think about rolling. Now a couple of other general concepts as it pertains
60.56s: to rolling first off, when we're referring to rolling most often, we're referring to a short
66.96s: option that is fallen in the money, meaning we would be closing it for a loss and opening a new trade.
73.52s: But that's just kind of colloquially speaking. Rolling can occur at any point in time. Rolling
78.88s: an option is simply when we close one, open another and we're tying the accounting to one another.
85.76s: It's nothing more than that. So you can roll winning positions, you can roll out of the money
90.48s: positions, you can roll bought or sold positions. It's just two transactions. Now for general
96.64s: context here and most often you're going to hear people rolling positions that they're defending
101.60s: something that's going against them. So that part of side, we have kind of our first step out
106.24s: of the way. What's the next step? Well, this is one that most people overlook and it's probably one
111.28s: of the most important things they need to ask themselves, should you be in this trade? A lot of people
117.12s: have a position that they put on. It starts to go against them and then they're like, ah, I got
122.00s: to defend this. But maybe we're just wrong. Maybe the best move is actually to get out of the trade,
128.40s: not tie up capital into something that's not working and then to deploy our capital somewhere
133.52s: more logical. So the way to think about this is first, I don't like the question of what I put the
140.16s: position on now because that assumes that over the entire life cycle of a trade that you would
147.36s: have optimal entry points. And that's just not real. That's not how trading works. Even trades that
153.12s: are working, there's very commonly instances where I wouldn't put that trade on right now.
158.64s: So I actually don't like that. I get the idea and it's designed to get you to do this, but as
164.40s: usual, I prefer to get a little more specific. So the real question I have is am I defending loser
171.28s: just because of my ego and because I don't want to have a losing trade or is there a logical reason
177.44s: behind it? That is the question to ask here. And we'll get into an example in just a couple minutes.
183.68s: The next piece we have is this, which is what is the optimal time to roll? Well, in an ideal world,
191.84s: your optimal time to roll would be when the stock price is the same as your strike price and
197.76s: there's no extrinsic value remaining. This is a Goldilocks scenario. You're essentially never going
202.64s: to see this. It could happen, but it's insanely infrequent. Most often though, you're going to have
208.40s: a point in time where your short option, again, just using kind of that general scenario,
213.92s: is the same price as the stock. So let's take a look at an example that I have on right now.
220.16s: If you take a look at IWM, you'll notice that I'm short the 199 puts. This is part of a covered
224.96s: strangle. These are at a 20 delta. So these are actually working for me beautifully, a rare scenario.
231.28s: But let's say, now that I'm talking about, it's probably going to happen. Let's say that these
236.32s: short puts end up at the money. What you'll notice is when they're at the money, there's actually
241.12s: the most extrinsic value the option is going to have. So in terms of data decay perspective,
248.40s: there's a lot of time value that needs to come out of these options and there's a lot of
252.64s: extrinsic value that you don't necessarily want to buy back if you've sold it. That's the idea
257.36s: of selling a put is to collect time value. However, the other thing you'll notice is there are a lot
264.40s: of choices available to roll. So these have 10 days left. Let's say that these actually fell to
269.60s: the at the money and they're trading around where these 204s are right now, which is like 242,
275.44s: something like that. So if I take a look, let's just even go out one cycle to 20, let's go a little
282.00s: further. Let's go to 28 March. And you'll notice that I can already roll them down. I can get them
288.72s: further away from the money and I can still collect a small credit so I can decrease my basis in
294.72s: this scenario hypothetical from 204 to 203. This is the ideal scenario. And again, this is assuming
300.64s: your short puts are being challenged. Now, you'll notice though that you're buying back a ton
305.36s: of extrinsic value. So that has to be part of your equation and we'll get a little further into
310.96s: that later. The reason why it's important to know when optimal, what's the goalie lock scenario?
315.92s: is so that we can then understand the trade offs that we're actually going to be facing as we go
320.16s: through this example. So let's take a look now at a quick decision tree using this IWM position
325.68s: that I have on. So I'm going to start with the market and the portfolio. The first thing I'm looking
330.32s: at from the market is has my market disposition materially changed from the time I entered the trade
336.32s: to now. And if it has, it might require a change in position in its entirety. Then I'm going to look
343.28s: at the portfolio. Here, I want to get a sense of what different decisions impact the portfolio as a
349.84s: whole. So again, for example, let's say that if I look at my portfolio, I have tons of positions
357.12s: that are expiring the 28th of March tons. Maybe instead of rolling these out to that same
363.60s: expiration cycle, I could get a little bit of diversity in expirations that I have exposure to.
371.36s: And instead of going to this 28 March, maybe that informs my decision making to go out to the
376.88s: 5 April or the 12 April. So some of this is going to be fed by what do you think about the market
382.72s: as a whole, but then most importantly, how does this fit into your portfolio? Are there any guidelines
389.12s: or implications from either of these that inform your decision making? Then we have the trade review.
394.88s: So now we're going to look at the trade. We're going to say, is my original thesis intact? Am I
401.12s: concerned about early assignment? How many days are left to expiration? Are there any market moving
407.60s: announcements coming up that I have to be aware of? So in this case, if the thesis has not changed,
413.36s: then we're okay for a role. If the thesis has changed, maybe we need to change the position. Am I at
418.88s: risk of early assignment? If yes, that tells me I need to do something sooner rather than later.
423.36s: A way to think about early assignment is pretty simple. If I had, again, short puts,
429.04s: but let's say I had short puts that were all the way in here like the 230s. Notice that there's
432.96s: only like two pennies of extrinsic value. These become more and more likely to be reassigned once they're,
438.80s: you know, sub-adigm definitely sub-nickle in extrinsic value left. So you have to consider that.
444.88s: How many days are left? So one of the things is we talked about in the beginning. If I'm selling
450.32s: premium, I want time to pass. So if I have a whole bunch of days to expiration left, maybe I
456.48s: want to leave it on a little bit longer to let some of that fade-a-go, or if I'm concerned about
460.80s: the way this fits in the portfolio, I don't want to take assignment yet. And it's super far out in
465.28s: time. But at this point, the stock price equals a strike price. I can make a meaningful basis
469.92s: adjustment. Maybe it being a little further out in time then doesn't matter to us when we make
474.16s: the adjustment. There's some ideas that go behind this, which we'll talk about. And then announcements
478.40s: is simple. Do we have something coming up that can potentially hurt us? How does that inform or
483.28s: decision making? Okay, let's talk about the analysis now. So we already talked about the stock equals
488.96s: strike. What's going to happen here is you're going to have the greatest choices in strike selection.
494.96s: And here's why. If we take a look at this again, 10 DTE, the further you go on the money,
502.08s: the more intrinsic value there is, the less extrinsic value there is. So when you buy this back,
509.44s: it's becoming increasingly expensive, but there's less extrinsic value that you're getting for these.
515.44s: So let's say if I wanted to roll these two tens that are trading, let's call it six ten.
520.56s: So the two tens are trading for six ten. If I go out to that same expiration that we were looking
526.40s: at before, the 16 DTE from 10, and I go to those two tens, notice how I can't improve my basis anymore.
534.16s: I can't get a net credit here. These are only trading for five seventy five, five seventy eight.
540.00s: So because they're too far in the money and there's too much intrinsic value, I've now lost the
546.08s: ability to go out as short as I could before and collect a credit. I'm stuck at the strike unless
552.40s: I want to go further out in time. So this is why when the stock price equals the strike price,
558.24s: you love the most variability in terms of strike selection, but you're going to be paying the most
562.80s: extrinsic value. So the first question that comes into my mind here and the most important one in my
568.48s: opinion is actually this one right here. What is my preference towards inventory? Do I want to take
576.40s: shares on or do I not? If I don't want to take shares on, that's going to inform my decision-making.
583.36s: Really, this series of trade-offs here, which we'll touch on in a second. If I don't care about
587.84s: inventory, then I might feel a little bit differently. Expiration liquidity is another part of this puzzle.
592.56s: If we take a look at expirations, even in something like IWM, that has a bunch of them. Notice how we
598.56s: can go from one day, three day, six day, eight, 10, 13, 16, 24, 31. So what's happened here?
606.40s: Here we're going in two day increments. Then we go two day again, but then all of a sudden we start
611.28s: going out full weeks. Then you'll notice it goes 38, 45, 45 to 66, 66 to 101. What I'm showing you is
618.96s: expiration liquidity. The way that these expirations are thought up is based on liquidity and near-term
625.28s: options, even with weaklies, will have more expirations the closer into time you get, typically within
631.52s: 60 days. But once you get outside 60 days, then the date windows start to jump massively. In this case,
638.16s: you have 49 days until you get to the next cycle. This can be even worse if you're trading something
644.40s: that's less liquid. So if you're trading something like QLD, notice you don't have that many choices.
649.12s: You go from three to 38 to 129. So expiration liquidity is actually a really important part of this
654.56s: puzzle because my general disposition is to go as little far out in time as I can. Here's why.
660.32s: If I'm in the position of defending something that's not going in my favor, so if we zoom this out
666.48s: more and I'm going and I'm trying to fight this thing that's going in the wrong way, you have a
671.28s: couple of choices. You could go really far out in time, get a bigger basis adjustment. But then if
676.08s: it keeps going down, what's happening in that scenario is, let's say you rolled it from this 10 to
681.52s: the 45, you get a really nice basis adjustment, but let's say it keeps plummeting. Well, now you can't
687.52s: really adjust your basis as much because now instead of just being able to jump 30 days, you're going
692.88s: to have to jump increasing periods of time that kind of lock you into holding the position, even
698.48s: though something could be nose diving. So it's very market dependent, but it's something to think about.
703.28s: My typical disposition is if I'm defending a trade, I want to go as little out in time so I can
708.72s: maintain spot price sensitivity. So the last thing here is profit potential. Now if I have no
715.52s: inventory preference and expiration liquidity looks good, meaning I have tons of choices, then I'm
720.72s: going to look at which one gives me the most ways to make money. And what that means is let's take a
726.00s: look at this example again. If I go in this trade and again, let's say that we have these 204s,
731.68s: let's say that you choose to roll out to this 16 DTE. So this 204, you would make more money if
739.92s: you kept it right here at the 204 because you would collect more extrinsic value. However, your
745.28s: basis would be the same. So if you wanted to roll out and then down to get away from being at the
751.20s: money, and this is the same for the call side, then all of a sudden you're collecting less theta.
756.56s: So your trade makes less money. So this also becomes a pretty big calculus specifically for covered
762.40s: calls because if you have long shares and if you're able to roll up for your long shares, that means
769.12s: that you're able to sell them instead of 203 at 204. So you might sacrifice some of the time value
776.40s: of your options because you'll make more money on the long stock. You have to look at that pretty
781.12s: carefully. So this is really the series we're looking at though. How do I feel about inventory?
787.68s: What am I trying to do with my basis? If I'm trying to more aggressively adjust my basis,
793.12s: that tells me I'm going to sacrifice how much money I potentially am going to make in extrinsic
798.32s: value because I'm trying to get a bigger change in my basis. The time value left in the options is
803.76s: always a tricky prospect. I prefer to let as much time value run away as I can. However, again,
810.64s: if you do that and something falls too far in the money, that's when you get stuck and you can't
815.84s: adjust your strike over your basis anymore. So again, if you don't care about adjusting your basis,
820.32s: then that probably doesn't matter so much. You wait until as much of this as out as you possibly can.
824.48s: If you do care about your basis or you do care about inventory, then maybe we prioritize getting
829.84s: away from at the money and getting out of the money again, whether it's a color output. And then
835.36s: the last thing here is reminding us about that DTE liquidity. The reason why I go from the 10 to
840.72s: the 16 is because it lets me slowly move my way out while I'm accelerating by the highest
847.12s: portion of theta decay. Because again, if we look at these two or threes, two or fours, they're
851.20s: moving at a dime a day in theta. If I go out to this 38 DTE and I go to the at the money, they're only
856.80s: losing six cents of theta, way less. So if my goal is to be spot price sensitive and maintain as
864.40s: much expiration liquidity as I can, meaning if I roll to this 16 and then five days in, it's not
869.52s: going well. I can roll it again out to that would be the 19 at that point instead of the 24 DTE.
875.28s: I have a lot of choices if things go against me. I'm collecting less money up front because I'm going
880.40s: out very little in time. But I want to go out as little in time as possible while achieving whatever
886.96s: my broader objective is for the role. So for example, if I wanted to get a really big basis
892.56s: if we go to this 10 DTE and we buy these two or fours back in for 242 and we go 38 DTE out,
900.32s: notice you can go all the way to the 199s and get 242. You can get a few pennies in extrinsic value
906.40s: back to roll for break even or a slight net credit. But you're moving your basis five bucks from
911.44s: two or four to 199. So this is a way you can get a more meaningful basis adjustment. But again,
916.16s: then if you want to roll again, you're not able to go from 10 to 16 DTE. You're going to have to go
921.76s: from 38 to 45 or whatever else is there. So it's a big consideration to make. This is the general
928.08s: process that I follow. I'm going to look at the market, the portfolio review the trade, make sure
932.72s: it still makes sense that there's nothing coming up that alerts me. Then I'm going to go through this
936.56s: series of analysis. How do I feel about inventory? How do I feel about making an aggressive adjustment
941.28s: to my basis or not? And then where's the best profit potential I have affordable to me? And what
947.04s: keeps me most adjustable to the market that I'm obviously defending against again using this
951.52s: general scenario? If you have any questions, let me know. Like, subscribe, share, be an outlier. See
955.52s: you guys later.
