0.52s: what's up outliers got another email
2.48s: asking to look at djt again and a couple
5.28s: comments asked if we could look at a few
6.76s: times leading into the election which
8.36s: makes sense to me happy to do so and
10.68s: there was actually a couple things that
12.16s: happened yesterday that I thought were
14.64s: really interesting and I want to talk
16.64s: about it so first here you can see on
18.92s: the chart we have uh spy q's and iwm and
23.72s: you can see over the last two days spy
26.60s: has been running slightly negative iwm
29.32s: has been running negative and q's got a
32.28s: little bit of a bite today and yesterday
34.88s: had a pretty big down day and then
37.68s: notice djt it is up on yesterday hitting
42.96s: new highs and today it's hanging out
45.44s: round about there as well so what's
47.84s: going on here and why do I find this
49.20s: interesting well it tells us a few
51.04s: things definitively now we have a lot of
53.16s: ideas around djt and how that's behaving
56.00s: and whatnot but from a a broad
58.44s: perspective this is adding a pretty
61.44s: significant clarifying structure which
64.80s: is there is pure speculation going on
68.36s: right now and this is being used as
71.36s: speculation to the probability of
73.44s: winning an election now I think most
75.72s: people already generally thought that
78.60s: but the reason why it's so interesting
80.28s: now is that this isn't just following
82.04s: along with General market beta in adding
85.08s: a little bit of spice on top of it this
87.48s: is now decoupled slightly in the near
90.24s: term from broad Market beta right
93.20s: because you can see on the 17th spy has
95.08s: hit a high and it's actually been
96.40s: rolling over a little bit here and if
99.44s: you take a look at the 17th what's
102.12s: happened in djt it's just gone up so
104.88s: that's interesting seeing breakdowns and
106.60s: correlation like that and this now being
109.36s: used quite literally as a speculative
111.36s: measure on election outcome
114.08s: probabilities which again for those that
116.16s: are
117.16s: unfamiliar you can use prediction Market
120.08s: things like poly Market to get an idea
122.24s: of what this might look like so if we go
124.04s: in here check out the presidential
126.08s: election right now it's showing about a
129.00s: 64% probability of trump against a 36%
132.96s: probability of Harris uh pretty close
137.16s: and the reason why I say pretty close is
139.08s: because these relationships can move
141.40s: diverge and converge very quickly as you
144.36s: can see back here it was really blown
147.24s: out to the other direction and um
149.96s: paris's narrowed it quite a bit back and
152.16s: forth and now we're definitely diverging
155.16s: again right now but we are not in you
157.64s: know 9010 level so that part in and of
162.20s: itself is a little bit interesting to me
163.84s: in terms of just prediction Market
166.68s: probabilities now a couple notes about
168.48s: prediction markets is they're not
169.76s: perfect and these are not super liquid
171.88s: markets yet so if you look at this
174.12s: there's
175.28s: $2.4 billion in volume and the reason
179.44s: why it's important to emphasize in
181.32s: volume is because we don't know buys or
184.76s: sales opening closing trades being moved
187.64s: around that matters quite a lot the
190.68s: other thing that I find interesting is
192.16s: that if we take a look at the polls
194.36s: National polls show Harris with an edge
197.44s: 48.2% against Trump at 47 those are
200.52s: interesting because the polls tend to
203.16s: capture certain audience and markets
205.12s: tend to capture a different audience so
207.92s: the the truth likely lies somewhere in
210.32s: the middle which again we will have to
212.48s: see now going back to djt though there's
216.24s: a few things that I want to talk about
218.48s: next so first let's get over to a chart
220.92s: and let's show just where it's hanging
222.72s: out which again is near highs and it's
225.20s: maintaining this really aggressive
227.40s: volume the 5day and the 20day average
231.08s: volume has essentially been consistently
233.92s: growing from all the way back here in
236.44s: the beginning of
238.28s: October just expanding RIT large and
241.76s: today it's the 20-day average volume is
243.60s: now at
244.68s: 37.6 million shares the 5day is all the
247.32s: way up to essentially like
248.80s: 43 so really strong volume and the other
253.04s: thing that's kind of interesting is the
254.36s: lockup period for djt uh expired a
257.08s: little while ago and there's not like
259.00s: this insane sailing volume there's
261.24s: definitely some likely attributed to
263.20s: that but not a ton a couple other things
266.32s: that I note here is look at the
268.24s: volatility it's continuing to expand
270.44s: even more so implied volatility right
272.72s: now is 36% now when I did a video on
275.60s: this like 2 days ago it was like 300%
278.00s: and um IV percentiles 98% so it is very
281.76s: very much just pin near
284.28s: highs now if we take a look at average
287.40s: true range for the 5day it's
290.64s: 7.45% 20-day is 8.3 90day is 7.43 so the
296.84s: interesting thing that I pick up from
298.52s: here is that we are now getting into a
301.96s: probably very volatile period until we
305.28s: get into the election here you can look
306.88s: at the expected move on a monthly time
309.20s: frame which is like 88% it's insane
311.80s: absolute absolute move this is likely
313.68s: going to be a binary event meaning for
316.48s: this stock if Trump wins this is likely
320.48s: to get a a decent move but how much of a
323.36s: move is going to be tricky because
324.60s: there's going to be a lot of people
325.64s: selling into that move and if Trump
328.56s: loses this is probably going to drop
330.28s: like a freaking Rock cuz everybody's
332.72s: going to be dumping out because it's
334.72s: essentially tripled in value from the
337.88s: middle slend of September and there's
340.80s: been very little change in the
342.28s: fundamental picture of this so this
345.24s: being used as an election proxy is very
347.28s: interesting to me now if we pop over to
349.76s: the trade tab you can see the
352.00s: volatilities around 8 and 15 nove just
355.20s: being astronomically High I have a
357.92s: position out in 15 no no the reason why
360.68s: I use 15 no compared to 8 no is
363.40s: literally just because it's more liquid
365.56s: the weeklys in this case are still very
367.88s: liquid but they're still not as liquid
370.32s: as the standard monthly expiration if
372.64s: you take a look at the 8 November
374.32s: expiration there's
376.04s: 2,783 calls against 35,000 puts and if
379.44s: you go to 15 nove it's 156 to 152 so
383.40s: there's lots of people playing this
384.84s: different ways now I want to show you
388.52s: another thing that I found
390.28s: which is over here from unusual whales
394.84s: and there is a couple really interesting
397.04s: movements this week one of which is on
399.88s: the 23rd we can see that there was uh a
403.60s: couple interesting trades to me let's
405.88s: say so we have a few bids at the 37
410.04s: calls and we can see some of these are
412.56s: actually pretty large trades near
414.20s: million dollars over million dollars
416.44s: then we can also see these are longer
419.20s: term up here out in
421.48s: 2026 and these trades are interesting
424.52s: because I don't fully understand what
427.92s: the game plan is here like why they
429.76s: would go out to 26 for these 20s but I
433.76s: mean that's a $2.3 million trade which
436.52s: is interesting enough but it's had some
439.92s: really heavy overall premium volume so
444.08s: far this week and you can see that
445.48s: there's stuff transacting put side calls
448.60s: side it's a little bit of a shotgun
450.88s: blast and I think it's because you're
452.72s: going to see two very different things
454.64s: going on here there's going to be people
456.64s: trading djt as a directional thesis for
460.36s: what's going to happen with the election
461.68s: again either upside or downside but the
463.56s: other thing that you're going to see
464.56s: here are people using djt as a hedge for
468.80s: the rest of their portfolio again
470.88s: depending on what they think may or may
472.44s: not happen going through the election so
475.56s: the fact that there's this stock that is
478.20s: being used in a lot of different ways
479.80s: around this binary event and let's go
482.72s: back to the fact that the Stock's not
484.32s: really designed to be an election proxy
486.96s: so there's going to be fascinating
489.56s: movement that comes from this literally
491.52s: because of those reasons now leading
493.56s: into the rest of the election the
494.92s: question to me becomes where does this
497.36s: go how high is reasonable for this based
501.44s: on again no change in fundamentals and
504.32s: how much how much fomo is going to lead
507.84s: to people dumping into to more of this
510.44s: because I had originally started scaling
512.56s: in just a little bit based on some of
514.84s: these really large average daily range
517.84s: breakouts and I'm just holding a small
520.44s: position to kind of follow through with
521.96s: it but I'm sitting here left wondering I
525.56s: just how far does this run into the
527.64s: election it's coming up pretty soon so I
529.52s: have to imagine we're getting near where
531.48s: this might land but options can help us
534.56s: understand that so if we go to the
536.20s: analyze Tab and we go to the probability
538.80s: analysis take a look at this skew right
541.28s: so normally you would see this as more
544.44s: of a normal distribution but this is
546.88s: obviously very very skewed all the way
548.92s: out here to the downside but in the near
551.12s: term it's actually skewed a little bit
552.76s: to the upside so if we take a look at
556.00s: let's say over the next week let's take
558.36s: a look at the probability of a touch it
562.08s: has a and this is a one standard
564.12s: deviation move so it's going to use
566.12s: around a 16% probability and as a 16% %
569.68s: probability of being all the way out to
571.28s: 60 or 17 so the upside skew potential in
576.08s: this is massive which is why people like
578.68s: me who don't really care to use this as
581.40s: it's being used right now are still
582.76s: willing to speculate and it's because of
584.92s: this skew in probabilities so this thing
588.44s: is going to be on Wheels coming up
590.92s: without a doubt and look at the
592.80s: compression around like the 43%
595.84s: probability range and stuff like that it
597.48s: is just really really crunchy down um
601.04s: 300% V will do that but again you can
604.68s: see essentially out let's see when this
606.84s: starts to flip over because all the way
610.00s: out here so far to 60 days there's still
612.44s: definitely upside skew and it's only
614.32s: because it can only go down so far but
616.32s: then it starts to really uh Peak and
618.64s: roll back over which I again I just find
621.96s: that generally interesting based on the
624.36s: overall perception of what we might see
627.44s: coming into the election so looks like
631.84s: volatility is the name of the game going
634.28s: forward we will see what this looks like
636.48s: as always anything you want me to take a
638.12s: look at let me know be an outlier I'll
639.56s: see you'all later
