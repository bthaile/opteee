0.00s: What's up everybody?
4.40s: Let me know if you guys can hear me.
7.96s: We're using hotel Wi-Fi, so it might be a little sketchy, but let me know if this is working.
17.40s: Looks like so far we got Scott.
20.92s: So that's good.
29.92s: Is this thing working?
33.92s: Perfect.
34.92s: PFA, can you hear me?
37.92s: Making sure that we're alive and well, otherwise I can hotspot from the phone if I need to.
42.92s: Okay, perfect. Thank you, Lauren.
44.92s: Looks like everybody else was just playing games and gonna let me fucking sit here and figure it out on my own.
51.92s: So no thank you for whoever's doing that.
56.92s: Awesome.
57.92s: So first things first, I got to grab a couple links for us and we're gonna run through.
65.92s: We're gonna run through some more of DFVs kind of due diligence that we've seen, not just about DFV I guess, but just broader game stop due diligence.
77.92s: So I'm just grabbing a bunch of links right now so that we can float through them and take a peek together.
84.92s: So first let's just talk about GME though because I did a video yesterday on it and it looks.
92.92s: I mean, I love that it's consolidating up here.
96.92s: It opened, it had a high of 2980 low of 27, so it's like a really, really inside day here, but I don't even really think that matters that much.
106.92s: I think the fact that it's still hanging out up here and it's not necessarily being done on crazy high volume or anything.
116.92s: I think I've been telling you guys I think that's a good thing because it really needs I think is much.
125.92s: As much support up here is it can get so we also got the John here, we got Dirt Shlup great to see you all.
134.92s: We had to start a little bit earlier tonight just because of some schedule and stuff.
139.92s: So thank you guys for being flexible popping on early.
143.92s: Let me grab our GME map to start because I got to make sure that we have this fully up to date with anybody that's.
154.92s: Die one in need to know where you're from or here's our GMU.
161.92s: So if you are dialing in, let me know where you're from.
168.92s: And in the meantime,
171.92s: while I'm starting to fill this in and whatnot.
174.92s: Okay, that water tastes weird.
177.92s: Do you like this water?
182.92s: It's fucking weird.
185.92s: So we have like this weird water from this hotel.
190.92s: It's supposed to be a BPA free liner, which I guess sounds good, but it tastes weird.
200.92s: Yeah, not a big fan.
205.92s: Cool. So let's take a look at this while we're waiting for anybody to chime in with where you're at.
211.92s: And we'll get that on the map.
214.92s: We have earnings coming up.
217.92s: And I think Lauren says missing that plastic taste.
221.92s: Yeah, I guess maybe that's it.
223.92s: Maybe the BPA free is the problem.
226.92s: Maybe I need the BPA.
228.92s: And then it looks like shown us from Maui.
230.92s: I think you might actually have a friend here. Yeah, you do. See?
233.92s: So we have almost it was you that told us previously.
237.92s: But we have we have attendance from Maui so far.
241.92s: So Sean, I don't know where in Maui you are with somebody else's from there too.
246.92s: So you could phone a friend, make a friend.
249.92s: We still need Madagascar.
251.92s: I don't know when your guys's travel plans are going to take you to Madagascar.
255.92s: But that's pretty high on the hit list for me.
257.92s: We already have New Zealand, which is sick.
259.92s: I also think what would be good is Tasmania.
264.92s: Because Tasmania just seems like a cool ass place.
268.92s: And then obviously we're still trying to get Iceland.
273.92s: Jotato says I will move to Madagascar for the team.
275.92s: That's it. That's really all I'm asking is for people to,
278.92s: to not be selfish and to do things for the for the greater good here,
283.92s: which obviously me being able to fill this map in this arbitrary map
288.92s: that really doesn't necessarily mean anything.
291.92s: That's a super high priority.
293.92s: Also fun fact with the,
296.92s: with the spot that we're in right now,
298.92s: we have a perfect view of JPMorgan and nobody's working.
303.92s: So there's going to be light off soon because investment bank
307.92s: is supposed to be grind until you die.
310.92s: And I'm looking at a bunch of empty desks right now.
312.92s: There's literally nobody there grinding.
314.92s: They got the lights on nobody's home.
316.92s: So yeah, I don't know what that's all about.
319.92s: And then we have some neighbors across the way that it looks like they're watching a cartoon.
324.92s: A cartoonist city living's not for me.
327.92s: I don't like being able to see this much shit.
331.92s: SAS has been watching for a while.
333.92s: Just curious, do you hold a long position in GameStop yourself?
337.92s: It yeah, so it's kind of ebbs and flows.
339.92s: So I've already kind of talked to you guys previously about holding a position
344.92s: just for kind of participation sake and then trading around it is a slightly different thing.
351.92s: But yeah, GameStop is one of those stocks that has a ton of movement potential.
357.92s: And from pretty much any sort of trading perspective,
361.92s: that's a net positive because things that have more volatility,
365.92s: like you see here, you can trade things like the volatility in it,
368.92s: you can trade the price movements, all that kind of stuff.
372.92s: So it's like really, really interesting in that way because it'll grab trends
379.92s: and run a trend for a little while.
381.92s: And that's one of the things I try to talk to people about it's because it's not like GameStop is relegated to just its squeeze behavior.
391.92s: It definitely has squeeze behavior. There's no doubt about it.
393.92s: But that's not the only thing that it does.
395.92s: It has a lot of other price behavior that I genuinely find interesting.
400.92s: Because if we zoom this out a little bit further, come out to a year,
404.92s: you can trade this thing from a lot of different directions on short-term timeframes.
408.92s: So it can have these big massive runs, it can have contractions,
412.92s: it can have sideways periods for volatility, a lot of sideways periods.
416.92s: And the interesting thing about the sideways periods is that you're kind of inventorying risk
421.92s: if you're trading it in more of a price neutral flavor,
427.92s: which is a lot of people do that with something like this because of how volatile it is.
433.92s: I measure the risk premiums and stuff pretty regularly.
437.92s: And it is pretty strong risk premiums that this continues to have.
443.92s: And anything that has big, outsized move potential like this,
447.92s: that's exactly what it's going to have.
449.92s: Because somebody is going to inventory the risk on the sell side.
453.92s: So in order for them to logically hold that position, they have to be compensated for that risk.
459.92s: But Donkey Kong says, will you be calling in air strikes on these locations?
467.92s: I don't think so. I don't think there's a need to.
470.92s: I think it's nice to be able to watch a couple different TVs right from where I'm sitting looking out the window.
478.92s: One of them apartments is empty in case you want to rent one.
483.92s: There's a nice opportunity right across from us.
486.92s: And yeah, I'm waiting to see the interns of the first years at JP Morgan go back to work
493.92s: because they shouldn't be they shouldn't not be working right now.
497.92s: This is ridiculous.
499.92s: I don't know if you guys know, but like if we take a look here,
504.92s: JP Morgan, JP Morgan, see, let's see.
511.92s: See, this is the problem.
514.92s: There's really no way for the CEO, which is Jamie Diamond for those unaware.
521.92s: The CEO of JP Morgan, he is based salary is a mill and a half.
525.92s: And then his performance based compensation is 34 and a half,
529.92s: which is five mill in cash and then the rest in equity, which is kind of ridiculous if you think about it.
537.92s: So in order for him to be able to take home his measly 36 million per year,
544.92s: he obviously needs the interns grinding away working right now, which they're not.
550.92s: So very much like that other video that we did, which was making sure everybody's aware of the plight of Citadel in
558.92s: Ken, just keep do us all favor and keep Jamie Diamond in your thoughts and prayers as well,
565.92s: because obviously they're not working.
568.92s: So that's that could hit his 36 million compensation, which is just kind of that's going to be tough to get through.
574.92s: So I wonder if there's a way to look at what kind of assets he has.
579.92s: Like I wonder, let me see, Jamie Diamond as a list, because I'm sure some of his assets will be very public.
587.92s: I'm curious if he has like yachts and shit like that.
590.92s: Let's see.
594.92s: So he has a lot of stock.
599.92s: It doesn't talk about any real stay specifically and it doesn't talk about any boats.
605.92s: I still have conjecture that he has.
610.92s: I think that he has a yacht somewhere.
613.92s: Why wouldn't you when you have that much money?
616.92s: I don't see any reason to not hook yourself up with a yacht.
620.92s: It's kind of like the least to least you could do or at least you can get for your effort.
626.92s: I don't know how long he's been seeing for this kind of interesting.
629.92s: So what do you guys make of GameStop so far?
632.92s: I'm going to grab the library now and we need to get back through here.
636.92s: We were sorting this by date and I don't remember where we ended.
644.92s: I remember you guys told me that there was a couple.
647.92s: I think this one we looked at, the Diamond notebook.
650.92s: Yeah, we started looking at this one and I downloaded it.
655.92s: Yeah, okay, okay.
657.92s: So let me see if I can find this.
661.92s: I think I should have put it on my share drive so I should be able to grab it for my laptop.
671.92s: Let's see.
673.92s: Are there years?
675.92s: Yes.
677.92s: Date model for that.
680.92s: No, no, no.
683.92s: What is the name of this Diamond Handbook?
686.92s: Diamond.
689.92s: This one.
697.92s: And then this beautiful.
700.92s: That's what we love to see.
703.92s: So now we should be able to go through and naturally kind of take a peek at this together.
712.92s: Hold on a second.
713.92s: There's some of them on my screen.
714.92s: What's up with the screen?
715.92s: What does this thing do?
717.92s: Yeah, okay, cool.
720.92s: All right.
721.92s: So.
722.92s: Okay.
731.92s: Oh, I upgraded my subscription to Adobe literally for this so that we could use the AI more efficiently,
739.92s: but it needs to update on the laptop.
742.92s: So we, I think I left a bookmark right with where we left off if I'm not mistaken.
749.92s: I got to figure out where the fuck are these bookmarks at this thing?
753.92s: Here we go.
755.92s: This maybe?
757.92s: No.
761.92s: No, this is page 841.
770.92s: I'm trying to figure out how to find my bookmark.
773.92s: Go to bookmark.
776.92s: Finney guys know to use this.
777.92s: That would be great.
778.92s: But if not, I definitely know that we're somewhere.
785.92s: Let's see what we got through.
786.92s: We did this.
787.92s: We did this.
788.92s: We did this House of Cards for sure is where we were.
793.92s: We were looking at.
794.92s: Do you guys remember if we finished House of Cards?
798.92s: Let's see.
803.92s: And that's kind of annoying that the bookmark thing doesn't work.
806.92s: I thought it'd be easier.
812.92s: Yeah.
813.92s: Okay.
814.92s: Remember.
815.92s: Yep.
816.92s: We were definitely here.
817.92s: Ken confirmed we were here.
821.92s: Okay.
823.92s: So let's.
826.92s: I think if you, if I'm not mistaken, this is one that you guys said we should take our time going through.
832.92s: And I think we got through most of this because I talked about the DTC.
835.92s: Yes, yes, see.
836.92s: We got through most of this.
838.92s: PFA says thinking about selling this week and throwing my profit towards my crypto investment.
843.92s: Well, the way I look at stuff like that is you got to do whatever is right for you as a trader, right?
848.92s: There is what we would call an opportunity cost here capital.
852.92s: So if you have money sitting somewhere that's not doing anything, not saying that it is there isn't with GameStop.
859.92s: I don't know what your position is.
861.92s: But if you have money that's not really active, then you definitely did like it can be earning a return somewhere else.
872.92s: So the opportunity cost to the capital.
875.92s: I actually think is an important consideration.
877.92s: But the other thing is a lot of people think in black or white, which I don't think you need to.
882.92s: Right.
883.92s: So the other thing, there's no rules that say that you can't have a position that you scale down and use the money somewhere else and then still maintain some kind of position if you are so inclined.
894.92s: Or if you think it's better to just completely vacate and move out, like that's also completely reasonable.
900.92s: But I would always keep in mind that in the world of trading, you kind of have to execute what's most logical for you is a trader.
911.92s: And it's not get hung up on other components because it's too easy to get stock holding things that aren't doing what you want.
921.92s: And there is an opportunity cost for that without a doubt.
924.92s: Like this is how it goes.
926.92s: The capital could be earning something somewhere.
930.92s: Okay.
931.92s: So let me go through this really quick.
933.92s: I'm going to actually dump this into into perplexity.
939.92s: Except it's not scrolling, which is kind of problematic.
942.92s: That's going to be annoying.
946.92s: Let's get rid of this bookmarks though because that sucks.
952.92s: There we go.
955.92s: I just want to use this to summarize.
958.92s: And for the, so for the prior week, like I said, I did a video, I think yesterday on GameStop and GameStop's movement and whatnot.
967.92s: So if you guys want to get a recap on like the options and stuff, because I'm going to be keeping a really, really close high.
973.92s: Well, I look at it every day, but I'm going to keep a really close eye of it looking into earnings because I want to see if there's any interesting positioning that starts to emerge from potential earnings.
987.92s: And then let me grab chat GPT.
991.92s: I guess here we can use perplexity.
994.92s: I don't know if perplexity or GPT is, but let's try GPT.
1001.92s: And let's see summarize this section.
1007.92s: And let's see what it comes up with.
1013.92s: And then I'll walk you guys through what it's telling us what we can learn from here.
1018.92s: And then we'll kind of dive into it more deeply.
1021.92s: Here we go.
1026.92s: We'll put this over here.
1030.92s: So here, it talks about the DTCC.
1035.92s: We already know all of this.
1037.92s: We already know this.
1040.92s: And I mean, I'm sure you guys are familiar with like the different instances of computerized trading.
1044.92s: Like there's the massive flash crashed literally 87.
1049.92s: This was done by I'm pretty sure a commodity trader.
1053.92s: And then there's like a bunch of different issues when it comes to computerized trading.
1059.92s: And I think the the ape community is actually one of the entities that's closer to that than most people.
1066.92s: So for those that don't understand the way it kind of works is it's almost like North Korea and South Korea.
1073.92s: Right? Like they're kind of just sitting there super close to one another staring across looking at one another, seeing what the other one's going to do.
1080.92s: Now computerized trading.
1084.92s: It's designed on a preset series of conditions that if they're seen, it should execute and do something.
1092.92s: Well, one of the problems with that is they start kind of building off of one another rapidly.
1099.92s: And it can lead to execution that otherwise may or may not make sense.
1104.92s: But more importantly, it can really increase severity of movement because if there's a ton, a ton of different entities that are running similar style computerized systems algorithms that start to piggyback off of one another.
1119.92s: This is when you start to see these kinds of movements here.
1122.92s: And this is actually what like such a prime time example if we go to chewy right and there was the period where the cat literally just made that random post this.
1135.92s: I think I think it was around here.
1137.92s: I don't know if this is the exact day that he made the post, but he had made a post about it wasn't even chewy like obviously he was signaling chewy, but it wasn't even chewy.
1147.92s: He made a post that had like the blue background in the dog face with green eyes, right?
1153.92s: So most people interpreted that myself included to think that he was buying something, but this is algorithms like that's what this is.
1163.92s: And some people think sometimes mistake the role of algorithms because algorithms are just kind of doing what they're told to do.
1171.92s: They're not necessarily going out and purposely trying to you know, overstate things.
1176.92s: I'm sure they would actually prefer to avoid that if possible, but that's just not necessarily the reality.
1182.92s: And especially as they're building off of one another, they're not going to, they're not going to be as discreet as that.
1188.92s: They absolutely have the ability to compound, which is one of the bigger again impacts.
1194.92s: So there's a good part about it, but also it's good in terms of efficiency, but it's not good when things start going haywire.
1205.92s: It's similar to what is likely to happen with AI and when the terminator comes alive.
1213.92s: AI in the beginning is going to be great, super useful, then we're going to have AGI, and then we're going to have a bunch of different technology that's like all services accelerators.
1221.92s: And then all of a sudden it's going to somehow gain consciousness and then try to ruin all of this.
1227.92s: So make sure that you have your your microwaves ready so that you don't fall full victim to a robot that would be pretty lame, I think.
1237.92s: So yeah, I think that that's a great point that this that this highlights.
1241.92s: So now let's take a look at some of this because the other thing I remember that we were talking about last time was the way that shares and what not were being held.
1254.92s: And that yeah, here we go. This was a massive problem. Yeah, okay.
1259.92s: So I think that we got through pretty much all of that one. Yeah, okay. So here's the bookmark. Oh, I highlighted it. That's what I did.
1267.92s: Now I remember now that we're here. Look at me go you guys never mind me. Why the fuck would you let me just to struggle through that when you guys already knew you guys unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable.
1282.92s: Lauren says, I guess I'll stop bullying chat GPT. Yeah, you better start learning how to say please and thank you to chat GPT because chat GPT is going to be like the little cousin to the overlord soon that you're going to want to gain.
1296.92s: You're going to want to gain positive favor with. So yeah, I would I would think that that's the right move.
1305.92s: Alright, so let me grab this. And again, if you guys know that this is one that we should go through in detail, please tell me. And then we can. But in the meantime, I'm just going to grab this and throw it into.
1318.92s: Chat GPT for a summary and see any high level things that draw my interest. The reason why a lot of these I kind of bounce through is most of what these are talking about.
1328.92s: I think most of us generally and already are aware of the case now some of these will have very deep nuance specific points.
1338.92s: But I don't actually think necessarily that those deep specific nuance points change a whole lot. So I want to see at a high level what this one has for us and then we'll take a look from there.
1353.92s: Because like this I'm looking at fines and I'm just assuming that they're not that they're highlighting that the fines are nowhere to mention it, which again, that's like one of those things that we kind of already know.
1365.92s: And it's also a reason why they continue to do these kinds of things, right? It's because if the fines were so excessive that if you committed one, it was a massive problem.
1376.92s: Then these kinds of companies have the resources to not do that. But I honestly don't think that they care that much because they're not made to care that much.
1385.92s: All right, so let's dump this in here and then I'll have it summarize this section include all major points and be thorough.
1398.92s: I don't need it to like summarize at too high level because we're absolutely able to look through this together.
1407.92s: Let's see. PFA says that's why I'm that's what I'm battling. Oh, let me see what you got. PFA most will happen right after you do. Yeah, but you can't learn obviously is poking fun.
1419.92s: But PFA you can't like you can't make trading decisions like that. Right? Because again, and this is one of those things that it's not binary as well.
1432.92s: You're not forced to either have a position in GameStop or not. You can still maintain exposure to GameStop and then reposition and something else if it's moving better, if you think it moves better.
1445.92s: Because here's one thing we've talked about this and I will continue talking about this every single chance I get because I think it's important for everybody to see.
1454.92s: Every single time GameStop has had a big move, it has not just happened overnight. There are always lead in periods that then culminate into bigger moves.
1466.92s: It is never right now we're trading at this point and then the next day we're at this point. It's never done that. It's always a few day period that you get in order to position and to you know change your structure.
1480.92s: How you want. So I would just keep that in mind when you're thinking about how you want to go about you know maintaining a position in something like this or not.
1492.92s: It doesn't have to be binary and I would actually take it a step further and say that there's there's really no reason for it to be binary.
1502.92s: Let me grab trading view real quick trading view trading view just has a slightly easier way to go back through some of the stuff.
1520.92s: I think it's this account. I honestly forget which account I have the is this right.
1529.92s: Let's look at games that are.
1532.92s: Yep, yeah, that's correct. Perfect. So here's trading view.
1542.92s: We can open this up a little bit.
1545.92s: And then let's change a couple of these really fast.
1550.92s: Let's take this out to a 10 7's a little too short for this example.
1555.92s: And then let's take this to 60 120 no 180.
1572.92s: Okay. And then zoom this in a lot.
1577.92s: Because I want you to pick up this point so that it's a little it's a little less burdensome. I think hopefully at least go to that.
1587.92s: So if you look at this period here, we obviously we were trading around 11 30 11 60 right so really, really tight ranges.
1599.92s: And there's a couple things that are exceedingly predictable when it comes to perspective movement and game stop.
1607.92s: Now I emphasize that point of perspective movement because literally nobody ever knows when something is going to do something.
1614.92s: But what I can say is that I've looked back through the literally the entire history of game stop at this point.
1622.92s: And I've created a lot of different like data slices that analyze movements.
1627.92s: And you don't even need any of that to eyeball, but essentially what I'm talking to you about also I realized that we need the.
1635.92s: We want these turned on.
1637.92s: It was one or is like where the fuck are the rest of the ms there we go.
1642.92s: So you can see again, we're we're hovering around in the levens.
1646.92s: Then it goes to 1181 notice how much bigger the average daily ranges here that's something that we can use to predict larger price movement.
1656.92s: Again, even the most recent move it's not that significant, but notice what happens.
1661.92s: We are trending sideways. This was around earnings. So this will happen.
1665.92s: We're trending sideways trending sideways. Then all of a sudden before the move happens, volume starts to scale.
1672.92s: Now again, it's not like a massive change, but it is absolutely notable. We can see it.
1679.92s: Volume here was 2.68 and then it goes to 6 mil.
1685.92s: This is before we had the big move.
1689.92s: Then we have on the 28th of October volume expand to 13.64.
1695.92s: So what I'm showing you is that even if you didn't bottom tick this, which is a fools errand anyways in trading, you can still capture the bulk of this move.
1706.92s: If you're paying attention and putting on good risk or reward trades, because that's the other way that I look at stuff like this is.
1714.92s: If I choose to get some sort of entry here, right on this exact kind of day, it's a low risk trade for me.
1723.92s: Because what I would do in this specific kind of circumstance is if I see GameStop popping above what I would consider to be near term resistance, which is this right here.
1737.92s: In this case, it's like the 21.66 handle and you don't think it gave me a break. So I got to put out some chapstick. It's super dry here. And I'm trying not to have my lips fall.
1746.92s: And so as it breaks above that and as it has expansive volume while it's doing that, this is essentially an interesting spot.
1762.92s: Now, even if you put a trade on here, the way that I look at it is essentially right below what I would consider to be near term support is where the stop goes, or you can even use the day of the break out the low of that if it's a false breakout.
1779.92s: So what that looks like is in this case, let's say that we get in and it's trading around 21 and 3.4, 21.74. And then we have our stop set at the low for this day leading into it, which is 20.73.
1793.92s: Right. So you're essentially taking a one point risk. You're taking such light risk. So the nature of these is being stopped out very frequently. And that's okay.
1806.92s: Because when you get stopped out, the tiny little losses. And then when you don't get stopped out, guess what? It's a really healthy move. So in this case, we were risking a dollar give or take. And let's, again, say we got in at 21.78.
1822.92s: And now it's trading at 27.90. So you're risking a dollar to make six. So it's, again, this is specifically for PF a to kind of consider and really for everybody else's consumption.
1836.92s: That there's a lot of ways that you can trade things like this as long as you remember that like your job as a trader is to be mobile, right. It's to pay attention to things as they move and take advantage of opportunities as they present itself going back to 21.
1851.92s: Guess what you're going to see. Guess what you see before the biggest days here price, price is four and change, four and change, five and change, then all of a sudden, all of a sudden volume goes from 28.24 mill here. It's 59 here. It's 25. So volume in here is heavy, right. 20 mill plus. And then all of a sudden here, it goes to 500 in 78 million.
1882.92s: Day before was 28 million. This essentially takes a move from this is 491 and then the range on the next day high to low was 966 to 501. Right. So then you essentially can get in at near term prices. And then again, depending on how you choose to play it, follow the trend, render stops.
1906.92s: This is light years before the big move. So this idea that I find a lot of the ape community has it can found me because there's no reason to always maintain a perpetual position unless you want to.
1921.92s: If you want to, that's cool. Do do whatever fits you best. There's no issue with that at all. But there's also when people say like molasses tomorrow or you know the big moves always tomorrow or the next day. That's okay. Right. Like because there's still enough time as long as you're paying attention to pivot and gain exposure to that move if you want.
1944.92s: If you want to move your money around and do different things. So I just see that all the time and it ends up yielding capital sitting in accounts, not doing anything for really long periods of time.
1958.92s: And again, if your preference is to have kind of like that fundamental long game stop position, just because you like it. Cool. That makes sense. But what I try to encourage people is to go into things. What I call eyes wide open.
1974.92s: So there shouldn't be any, you know, there shouldn't be any component that you're not aware of with respect to the trade off. So if we're maintaining positive exposure to game stop into perpetuity in an attempt to find a squeeze, then the one thing you will solidify is that if there's a squeeze, you will be in the trade. So that's good. Right. You can essentially create that profile for yourself.
1999.92s: But if you think that that's not potentially coming at the cost of capital being used otherwise, that then can be pivoting pivoted over into game stop. Well, then that's you'd be a little bit.
2016.92s: You'd be short changing yourself. So food for thought.
2024.92s: As they says, by one billion worth of Bitcoin, that is something you can do. I'm pretty sure Michael sailor is trying that approach right now as it sits. So that Lauren says right now, so find GME or holding my 5K portfolio up. So I'm hanging out right now. I'm hanging out for now. Well, the problem with you, Lauren, besides the fact that you have a greediously long legs, apparently, is.
2054.92s: If you aren't realizing profits on those traits and reallocating capital, it's not really doing that much for you. I wish I had my drawing pad with me. I don't on this setup. Unfortunately, this would be a really helpful thing. Can I draw with it? It'd be really tough to draw, I think.
2076.92s: Okay, I can. This is going to be with the mouse. So I'm going to do my best, but let's say that you have a dollar and then let's say it's worth two dollars.
2088.92s: So then once it's worth two dollars, if you take a dollar out and then maintain the investment of your other dollar up here, then what you can do with this dollar down here is turn it into another trade.
2105.92s: And again, I'm using single dollars just for simplicity. But what ends up happening is this is a way it's similar to a concept called Shannon's demon. And this is a way that a lot of us will trade things like leveraged ETFs is if you have a leveraged ETF where you earn enough money.
2126.92s: What you do is you take the excess off. So these are your profits up here. You take the profits off. You put them into something else. And then you continue to let the trade work at whatever the decided decided value of it is. So the main thing that
2146.92s: the main thing to be aware of here is you can use the management of capital to change the risk profile of a trade. So going back to the example of Lauren, if we have two positions on one and so five and one and GameStop. So let's grab so five, which is doing great. By the way, I'm glad.
2166.92s: But what I think about in here is how do you draw horizontal lines? Is that what this is? Is this going to be like a million? No, that's like fibs. I don't want that. You guys already know I don't know how to use this thing.
2180.92s: Trend line. How do I use you?
2184.92s: Where's on the line? There we go. So so flies another great example because we can gain entry somewhere down here. Then is it rallies up and it starts running. We can essentially use the lows of the gap for another stop.
2203.92s: Oh, you have to click each time. That's an eye.
2207.92s: There it consolidates it consolidates. Then as it gets up here, we would set a stop potentially. Yeah, I've got to click it again.
2216.92s: We would set a stop potentially for a drop below here. So on this kind of day, we would get out and realize the profit that we've made so far. You can either scale out entirely or you can scale out partially.
2229.92s: Then when you get a break above, I got to click this again. When you get a break above.
2236.92s: This prior resistance line here, you get back in. You lose the potential profit from here, which is 10 78 down to 1123. So it's less than a dollar that you lose.
2250.92s: The reason we do this is because if this for whatever reason decided to roll over and just go all the way down, then you're not exposed to it. You've kept your profits.
2259.92s: But now you can regain exposure at the original price level that you're in at. And then you can continue that process all the way up. That's the idea of like a trade that works out well.
2272.92s: Obviously a lot of them don't go like this, but also some of them do. And you can find them by being patient. But the point I'm making here for somebody like Lauren and really anybody else is that the process of trading around your positions is not just to reduce risk, but you can also reduce structural volatility and tap into something that we call Shannon's demon.
2294.92s: So which is really good for for overall return profiles just for general awareness. So now back to GameStop as it sits today. I want to finish going through this next one really quick so that we can eyeball a few things.
2314.92s: We need to grab this again. And then let's grab this. Okay, so this is looking at part two of House of cards. So this says financial struggles in a small flow to 50 million shares short sellers exploited this by taking short positions exceeding 140% of the flow, which is crazy.
2336.92s: The fact that you can have something that literally is over 100% of the flow is not like exactly this right mathematically impossible, just doesn't make sense. It's absolutely absurd that that can be a thing, but it is what it is.
2349.92s: And then it draws the comparison, which I think you guys have done a bunch of times comparing it to the Volkswagen V, coming in for the Deutsche Land short squeeze, which I guess in 08, Porsche reduced the available flow to 1% causing massive demand in GameStop short interest exceeded its entire flow, highlighting a deeper systemic problem.
2371.92s: Yeah, naked short setting artificially increases share supply, suppressing prices. This one makes sense to everybody, right, like how this works, because this is kind of an important, an important point and why people talk about naked short selling so much.
2385.92s: Because it does absolutely function as this now, how pervasive it is and actually like on a daily basis, how impactful it is. It's really hard to quantify and measure, but it's not.
2399.92s: It's not something that can be dismissed. It absolutely is part of this whole thing. Of course, as my problem has been that I take profits to early profit is profit, but I miss out on some larger gains. I'm still so new to trading that I don't do is that I don't mind I view it more as experienced.
2415.92s: Well, anybody in the chat that's familiar with my channel and what I talk about can tell you exactly what you're dealing with there. And it's because it is really, really common.
2427.92s: You actually shouldn't be doing that at this point, to be honest, at least if you watch any of my content, because you should be aware of that and the problem with it by now.
2436.92s: But if not, let me grab a video. I actually think that there's a video that I just like literally just put out today about this, this here and Reese, Reese hooked you up.
2450.92s: So what Reese is talking about it, it's called the disposition effect and let me grab a study. Actually, let me grab my folder, one sec heavier.
2464.92s: This one.
2467.92s: So this study here, I literally reference it all the time for anybody that's into trading, even if you're not a nerd like I am, you can go on to publication like SSRN.
2479.92s: And you can just look up different kinds of studies that exist. This one's really important because it looks at a really broad sample of investors, which is different than trading and you can't be too pedantic with stock market style studies, simply because there's not that many of them that are quality at least.
2498.92s: And there's two names that you will see a lot. You will see Barbara and Odin, both of those guys are fantastic. I've actually had the pleasure of talking to them a couple times on the phone just asking me general questions, neither one of them wanted to do an interview, but I try to have them on the podcast just because I really respect the work.
2515.92s: And what you're talking about there, Corey is super well studied this right here. Number two.
2524.92s: So number two is flag as sell winning investments while holding losing investments known as the disposition effect.
2534.92s: The reason why I highlight it here is because things that are this widely studied and this well understood, they should not be mistakes that we make as traders because this is the same thing is somebody telling you that if you jump off a really high bridge, you're likely to hurt yourself.
2553.92s: Right, like we don't need to do that mistake ourselves to understand that there could be a problem if we do it based on the artifacts of other people doing it and viewing the results.
2566.92s: The in trading you cannot afford to make all of the mistakes by yourself. It is if you're the kind of person that says like, oh, you know, I have to touch the stove to figure it out.
2578.92s: You know that the stove's hot. Well, trading is not going to work that well for you. It's going to be a giant problem. So anyways, for you, Corey, you have to learn about this here because you are exhibiting a really common behavior that most of us do, which is called the disposition effect, which really just leads to wealth depleting behavior because it's negatively expected in a nutshell.
2599.92s: So as they says, what percent profit do you take at first opportunity, which is a great question, but it's the wrong question. It's actually the entirely.
2614.92s: The reason why it's the wrong question is because the way you choose to take profits is completely, completely and utterly dependent on what the strategy is.
2628.92s: You can't pick an arbitrary number. It just doesn't work that way. I actually recorded a video. It comes out on the 14th of December and it's about using stops in trading.
2647.92s: So that's essentially how to how to select exit points and a big thing that you'll learn in that video is why picking exit points. It cannot be random. It can't be random.
2661.92s: So here's why if we go let me grab this really quick and I think that this might help drive this example and I'm happy to talk about it because this is a really, really important concept for you guys.
2677.92s: And I actually think I can grab this from here. Yeah.
2686.92s: I don't know if it'll keep the forming list. Does it? It does. This is fantastic. Great. Cool. So this is a calculator that I've shown shown you guys before, but let's take let's take a just individual trade. It doesn't matter.
2702.92s: And what I want to show is let's say that you have a system this system right here. This is just a perfect example. You have a system that has 92 winning trades and eight losing trades.
2715.92s: So your win rate is incredible, right? You have a really, really high win rate. What is this? I was wondering why that wasn't working. Hold on. Let me see.
2733.92s: Well, it's because it's locked. That's why I was wondering why is this not working.
2742.92s: This should be this.
2746.92s: So in this example, you have a massively high win rate, right? So we're winning 92 trades out of with eight losers and your average win size is a hundred bucks because we're taking really small wins.
2760.92s: In those eight losing trades, just eight losing trades. If you lose on average 1150, you have a what we would call a neutral expectancy. You are flat, which is not where you want to be. It means that you're not making money.
2775.92s: So what I'm highlighting and somebody might say like, oh, well, obviously, you know, if you're making a hundred bucks and you lose 1150, why would I let it go to 1150? Well, it's because the people that find themselves in the scenario, they're winning 92% of the time.
2790.92s: That becomes addictive to people. So they're willing to have a lower average win to have this much higher win rate and it's misguided. So going back to Aziz's question, you can have a system like this that has a profit.
2806.92s: Let's just say that your average loss here is 800 bucks.
2813.92s: And this is fantastically positively expected. I think this, let me double check that this is good. Yep.
2825.92s: So this is fantastically positively expected over the life cycle of the system. However, the problem here,
2835.92s: I'm unclowed sandwiched. Why does your voice sounds so robust today? I think it's because I'm on my laptop. So the camera might be the mic might be different. Is it too loud? I can turn it down. I actually feel like I'm talking super quiet.
2853.92s: No, how quiet am I talking? Melishikes are ahead of me. Complete bullshit. If it's too loud, let me know. I can turn it down for you guys.
2865.92s: But so here's a system that has really small winning trades.
2873.92s: Slightly, well, not slightly significantly larger losing trades and it's positively expected. Here's one system.
2880.92s: Now, let's pretend this is another system. Let's say that in this case, we have four winning trades and let's say two losing trades. Same profile.
2895.92s: What happens? We have a massive problem.
2902.92s: We have an absolutely massive problem. You see the problem here. So the issue in this case is we have the same exact average one size, the same average loss size that I just showed you.
2914.92s: But in this sample, it's negatively expected. That's a problem. So one of the things that we can do to kind of always keep our width about us with this is something like this.
2931.92s: If we change this formula and what we do is we have a change in it looks like this. We can have sample.
2949.92s: So in the sample, we can say instead of doing this over four and two trades, we can model what this might look like over a 100 trade system.
2962.92s: So then what we can do is we can essentially forecast if we continue on this current approach, what would this look like?
2971.92s: Because what I just showed you is that if we have a better win rate 92 and eight, we have a positively expected system.
2982.92s: So that's based on a 92% win rate and eight percent loss rate. If I do what was it?
2988.92s: Five and three or five and whatever five and I forgot what it did. It doesn't matter. At five and three.
2995.92s: Then you can see 62% win rate just doesn't cut it. So what I'm what I'm trying to elucidate for you as easy as that.
3006.92s: So this has to be based on the system. I just showed you a system that had the same exact average win average loss, but a different sample size, which yields different probabilities because of that variance and probabilities.
3017.92s: It makes all the difference. So to trade to turn this into like practical trading terms. If I have a system, let's say zero dT's and we're trading zero dT's and SPX.
3027.92s: Well, this literally means conceivably you could do it like 252 times. That's your sample. Meanwhile, let's say that I'm trading something like post earnings announcement drift only in mega cap companies, mega caps that only have weekly options.
3047.92s: What I'm doing is I'm adding filters that will decrease the number of occurrences. Right. So just from a nutshell, if we look at post earnings,
3056.92s: if we look at post earnings announcement drift, there's four quarters in a year for mega cap stocks that have weekly options that are liquid. Let's say that there's maybe 20 of those.
3069.92s: Probably a little bit more than that being realistic, but just for the sake of the example in this system here, notice how we only get to have 80 occurrences.
3080.92s: This is a different system with a different risk profile. This has to be traded differently than something like this. Your zero dT SPX approach can be the kind of thing that has a lower average win, a larger win rate.
3095.92s: And it can come out in the wash because there's enough opportunities, something like this that has fewer sample size will not allow you to do that.
3105.92s: So you have to determine based on your strategy, what makes sense. I hope that makes sense because I think it's an important note that a lot of people come up with because traders, they go through this series of things where like we feel like we're being really, really smart when we say like, oh, I'm going to manage my profits.
3126.92s: It sounds smart and then what becomes even more nefarious is when traders say like, oh, I'm not going to be greedy either, right? Because it's good not to be greedy.
3136.92s: But I've talked about this before in the fact that that doesn't work well in trading. It just doesn't work.
3144.92s: Because you can't apply broad things like that. So yeah, anyways, back over here.
3153.92s: And let's talk about Fintra. We already know. Fintra is not meeting. We know about red show.
3162.92s: Let's see what this says. Oh, I want to read these case studies. It says, ABN Amro repeated violations over eight years, including misreporting short interest and understating margin required.
3173.92s: It's interesting. These actions undermine market integrity, but resulted in minor fines. So we already know.
3179.92s: And this is one of the things that they are highlighting in that documentation from the due diligence is that they are highlighting how small the fines were.
3187.92s: Apex clearing over four years, they excluded 1.36 million shares from short interest reports across just two sample sentiment periods suggesting widespread on reporting.
3200.92s: Now, one of the things I'm curious about with these is other than the other than the financial impact.
3215.92s: Did they do any research to like objectively find out if there was nefarious activity? I know that we all assume that there is, but I'm curious if that was proven.
3228.92s: Because I don't I know that again, I know that that's our underlying assumption, but I don't know if it's like actually been proven in something.
3236.92s: Let me see if I can find that apex thing. Goldman Sachs has been up here a bunch of times.
3244.92s: See group. I want to see what they found barclays.
3259.92s: And here is.
3265.92s: Evident short selling. Here goes initiated a case for doing the same stuff as admiral magnitude of this violation really puts things in perspectives.
3277.92s: Without admitting or denying the findings, the firm consented to the sanctions into the entry of findings that it failed to comply with finisher, interest reporting requirements and related supervision obligations.
3290.92s: Find and state it that the firm experience and issue an its short interest reporting logic.
3295.92s: That excluded certain short interest positions from the firm submission of finra.
3300.92s: Okay, so this is they're trying to say that it was due to systems issues.
3304.92s: Again, I'm sure that unless they were forced to be an investigation to actually.
3312.92s: You know, to somebody else to figure out exactly what happened.
3315.92s: I'm sure that they would lean on this. So what I derived from this is it's just inconclusive.
3320.92s: We don't know if it's like like legitimately purposely being done.
3324.92s: We can make assumptions, but we don't know objectively.
3329.92s: Interesting. All right, let's go back to this.
3336.92s: Yep, we know this.
3340.92s: DTC.
3343.92s: Well, design streamlining settlements systems has enabled manipulative practices like negative short selling.
3349.92s: So are they trying to speculate that the DTC that the DTC is complicit or are they just saying that they're that there's not enough oversight?
3358.92s: WTTC says if I remember correctly, Barclays through Lehman at one point was Jimmy's underwriter.
3369.92s: Oh, interesting.
3372.92s: I don't know anything about that. It sounds interesting.
3380.92s: I just want to see if they think that DTC DTC is like explicitly trying to enable it.
3387.92s: Or if they're just not not proper for oversight.
3391.92s: Issues are sought to withdraw securities from DTC. I remember reading about that they denied these requests.
3398.92s: Okay.
3401.92s: Yep, and we know about seed.
3406.92s: Lack of transparency.
3409.92s: Fugulations are isolated incidents rather than systematic issues. I think that's correct.
3414.92s: This is I think this is completely correct.
3418.92s: The one on the second there's somebody on the other door.
3427.92s: Yes.
3430.92s: Thank you so much.
3438.92s: I can't even know what that means.
3441.92s: They gave us this.
3446.92s: This is a turn down service.
3452.92s: We just had somebody come by the room and offer us a turn down service.
3457.92s: I'm more in a turn down for what camp.
3462.92s: What is a turn down service?
3464.92s: Turn down.
3470.92s: What?
3473.92s: Is this real?
3483.92s: What?
3489.92s: That's crazy.
3492.92s: So this says they turn down the bed, turning back the top covers and refreshing the linens.
3501.92s: They tidy up the room.
3504.92s: What the fuck?
3506.92s: Leaving a small tree chocolate on the pillow or bedside table, closing the curtains and turning the lights.
3511.92s: They literally put you to bed.
3515.92s: That's fucking crazy.
3517.92s: You know, people are nuts.
3521.92s: It's a little bit.
3526.92s: Yeah, but I definitely think that this happens without it out because we see that with like the repeat instances of offenses in places like this.
3541.92s: Interesting.
3544.92s: Mill's base says, is this an episode of Beverly Hill billies apparently?
3549.92s: I'm going to tell you guys.
3550.92s: I don't know anything about this shit.
3552.92s: They literally did not know what that was.
3555.92s: It's like.
3556.92s: Yeah, that's a very strange thing to me.
3559.92s: I don't know why anybody would want that.
3562.92s: This is fucking bizarre.
3567.92s: The question says turn on services, the practice of staff entering a guest room and turning down the bedlin and a bed.
3573.92s: Yeah, it's like crazy.
3575.92s: Like just just fucking get in the bed yourself like a grown adult.
3581.92s: W TTC says it's a long time for me on this stuff, but there could be a Lehman rep on the DTCC board.
3587.92s: If the underwriter allows the offer to be a result.
3590.92s: Yeah, well, I think it's a massive conflict of interest.
3593.92s: But I also think based on the like these citations right Barclays, Barclays,
3600.92s: Parabits is on here a couple times.
3606.92s: City group a bunch of times.
3608.92s: It's like the bigger you are the more you're on here,
3611.92s: Deutsche Bank, Goldman.
3614.92s: So it's like, but again, this is one of the things to keep in mind is that I don't necessarily think like every single.
3622.92s: Instance of this is nefarious activity.
3626.92s: Like I generally do think with bigger companies like this, they're going to have issues oversight problems like that's natural.
3634.92s: But for a lot of it to be so focal on this is sus to me.
3639.92s: And I think that there's no way that most of them don't know what they're doing with respect to like the naked shorting like that's that's an active choice.
3647.92s: So yeah.
3649.92s: Crazy.
3652.92s: All right.
3654.92s: Anything else that you guys want to hit before I wrap up because we got to go grab some dinner, but happy to take another look at anything else.
3662.92s: I'm going to try to figure out how to add a natural bookmark here so that we can get back to this easier.
3668.92s: Maybe I'll add a comment this time.
3673.92s: Last spot.
3678.92s: See if we can find a way to get there.
3688.92s: Yeah, okay, perfect. This works great. So now we know how to find our spot easily.
3696.92s: The Johnson's MSTR we could take a look at that another day. I try to keep these a little more game stop focused. So happy to take a look at that either tomorrow or Monday or Tuesday or something.
3710.92s: Unclothed Salamander Sandwich. That's hilarious.
3716.92s: Could Jamie Bome cone at 35 let's take a look at the probabilities on that real fast and we can we can know with certainty.
3730.92s: Is this where?
3735.92s: Is this where it is?
3740.92s: I think it should be in here.
3746.92s: It's not.
3749.92s: Well, it's a little weird.
3754.92s: So yeah, let's grab GameStop up here real fast. Kill this.
3759.92s: So if we peak at GameStop's current state, 35 is right there.
3770.92s: My instinct would say 35 is very unlikely unless there's a very specific catalyst.
3782.92s: The reason why I think 35 is unlikely is because this move and actually think it's a good thing that it's unlikely to be clear because this move has been very orderly.
3793.92s: It's been moving in really nice phases. It's seeing good movement on volume volume variance moving averages are starting to look really, really good.
3804.92s: So my guess best guess is that we would see GameStop probably hover like this in that range leading into earnings.
3816.92s: That would be my guess kind of this range.
3818.92s: And the reason for that is most companies will start to slow down as it gets closer to earnings, which is on the fourth.
3825.92s: So maybe it's still less two weeks. So maybe it could be a little more active before.
3831.92s: But the probability of this hitting 35.
3834.92s: I imagine it's going to be pretty low.
3837.92s: Let's see.
3839.92s: So the probability of a touch at 35.
3846.92s: Yeah, I stand corrected.
3849.92s: This is showing like a 50% chance, 51% chance actually. So slight edge bigger chance than I thought.
3857.92s: So obviously these options have a lot of volatility in them more than actually.
3861.92s: Yeah, so they do stop. I was wondering because when I literally just looked at this yesterday, the the the ball itself wasn't this heavy.
3869.92s: So yeah, this makes this makes a lot more sense now.
3874.92s: I get it.
3877.92s: So yeah, it looks like the easy answer to that question is like a just shy 51% probability.
3885.92s: So there's a little bit more ball. I again, I still would imagine there to have to be a pretty strong catalyst, but we'll see.
3892.92s: A match and says, do we think arcade figured out the alga's they're using a tweets to break the alga's during its by phase.
3898.92s: I think so personally. I think that he knows that his tweets have an impact on the market.
3904.92s: And I think that he enjoys playing with that.
3907.92s: But I don't think that I don't think that he's like trying to break any sort of like the buy behavior or something like that because.
3918.92s: Like I don't think his tweets would actually disrupt a by phase. I think that they would encourage it.
3924.92s: So.
3926.92s: All right, guys, time for me to go grab dinner. Great. Hang in out. I don't know when the next live stream will be sometime the next couple days probably.
3933.92s: So I'll I'll let you guys know the day of the Thanksgiving and out for a little bit.
3937.92s: If you guys need anything, throw it in the discord, be an outlier, be an ape, be an outlier ape, whatever's most applicable.
