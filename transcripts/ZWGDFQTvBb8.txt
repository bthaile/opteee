0.00s: What's up, Alhairz? Quick market updates. There's not a whole lot going on, but a few things
4.56s: worth discussing as it sits today. Futures right now after the close are a little bit down
11.12s: across the board. Oil is up just a little bit. S&P 500 is closing in on highs. It's at 60746.
18.00s: And three month highs right now and all time highs 609 for spy specifically cues. Finally,
23.68s: cracked highs on a three month time frame up to 530. IWM is bucking the trend. So we're seeing large
30.48s: caps and cues. Those two sectors themselves definitely showing strength and small caps
37.44s: rolling over. Interesting because there's a lot of speculation about the upcoming FOMC
42.80s: meeting. What that could look like as far as a rate cut. We'll take a look at that.
46.88s: And I think the markets is starting to price in what they're thinking could be happening.
52.40s: As per usual, it's a discounting mechanism, but I didn't really expect to see this level of
57.68s: weakness trailing off of 244. Now we're down hovering right around like 235 mid to 30s. That's
64.56s: a little bit low here. Vix is sub 14 so very low. Bonds are rolling back over. Bitcoin is comfortably
71.76s: hovering above 100,000 for the time being. We'll see how that continues to go. Cross the sectors.
78.08s: Still super strong energy. Still super not strong.
81.12s: Financials have definitely rolled over pretty significantly, not massively, but on a relative
86.48s: basis, industrials, same story technology is doing pretty well. So we do know within
93.44s: QQQ that it's the comm sector that's really driving that performance. And we can see discretionary.
99.92s: Still crushing. I have been following along with this for a while. I have a couple trades
105.76s: that are designed to continue to follow this momentum. And I keep waiting for the music to stop
113.04s: because I don't know why the music is playing at this point in discretionary. It's been so decoupled
119.20s: from staples, which is interesting. Not that they're one to one or anything just because they
122.88s: both have consumer in the name. Doesn't mean they're the same thing. They're not. But normally,
126.40s: they're a little more correlated than they've been. They're almost unlocked at this point,
130.48s: which I can't help but find that to be a little bit interesting. Now,
134.80s: if we grab the Fed watch tool, we can see that the current probabilities for a cut on the 18
144.24s: D's meeting are 98.6%. This is moved up massively. There's been so much pricing dislocation with
155.36s: respect to the expectation around this specific rate cut. It is not quite confounding but very
161.52s: interesting. The market normally is very persistent in its ability to sniff out what it think
167.84s: may or may not happen. It's a collective interface of knowledge. But when you see these big kinds of
173.68s: changes, it tells that there's a lot of new information coming out that's causing people to change
177.52s: their opinions. So when you go from 65% probability of a cut a month ago to 98% probability of a cut,
184.32s: one as the event gets closer, we tend to become a little more certain because there's less
187.92s: information coming out likely to impact it. But it does show that there's a change in landscape.
192.48s: There's a change in information that leads to this. And for a while, the Fed has been messaging
198.32s: a slower, more pragmatic approach, not necessarily trying to jump the gun too far. A lot of people felt
205.04s: that they waited too long to start. Then when they started, a lot of people felt that they started
209.28s: too heavy with a 50 basis point cut compared to a quarter. And now it looks like we're targeting
217.28s: about a quarter point, which is what would be expected in terms of a cut if it was anything
221.28s: bigger than that. That means things are going very, very poorly. And that would be not well received
226.40s: by the market as a whole. But the entire run up in small caps previously was due to a lot of the
233.44s: expectation around this rate cut. Now the rate cut seems near certain and small caps are rolling over.
239.36s: So that tells us again that there's more going on underneath the surface as per usual.
245.20s: And it's difficult to sniff it out. But it has me questioning a few things as it sets. We need to see
253.44s: how we roll out here. Let's grab the economic calendar really quick and see what we think might
261.04s: be coming up that could impact this. Obviously, CPI came in right around in line with expectations
269.12s: a little bit light, which is a pretty good thing. Actually, consensus was 31534 came at 31549.
278.56s: So light little excessive compared to the consensus in the forecast, but not by much at all and
285.36s: definitely lower than the prior. So that means is CPI is moving generally in the correct direction.
291.12s: And then tomorrow we have PPI coming out, which will be another really big release across the board.
297.28s: So I think the market is seeing a little bit of weakness, but it does look like inflation is still
304.40s: generally holding steady here, which tends to bode well. So let's take a look at a couple stocks
310.56s: quick because there's a few that stuck out to me first and foremost. Here was a trade in Google
319.92s: that was interesting. If we take a look at Google, it had a blazing day, 5.5% move, and that
329.60s: doesn't sound like a lot of your use to growth stocks. But for something like this, that's a big
334.24s: look at the size of the candle compared to everything else, right? It tells you everything
336.72s: you need to know for an intraday move that's massive. Or something like Google. And I noticed
343.60s: when it was trading around 195 43, so very close to where we are now, I saw out in 13D, the 190 puts,
353.12s: there was a total volume transacted there at 43,000. The volume over OI there was massively different.
362.48s: So let's take a look at this. Let's go to 13Ds two days from now. And let's take a look at these 190 puts,
369.84s: which are just shy out of the money. Take a look at this. The OI on those prior was 137.
376.88s: And the OI now is going to be 43,400 in change, a tremendous expansion. That's people expecting
386.88s: downside. That's why those puts are being open there. We can take a look at some of the transactions
392.08s: that led to that. But it looks like people are prospectively fading this pretty significant draw
399.84s: up move, which doesn't entirely surprise me, especially in something like Google. It's not
404.08s: necessarily a bet against the company thinking that it's going to crater or anything like that. But
408.64s: it is absolutely speculation that maybe it's run up a little bit heavy here. So let's take a look
416.08s: weird that game stops always in there. That's typically the default. But let's take a look at Google.
420.72s: And let's take a look at today. And let's see right now it should be sorting by premium, which we
429.28s: don't actually care about so much in this case. I want to look specifically at the Friday expiration.
436.48s: And I want to look specifically at those puts. Because we can get an idea of how those came through
444.32s: today. So let's take a look. We look like. Yeah, they were getting banged all day.
457.68s: Literally all day. And when we have these style moves, it doesn't really surprise me.
464.72s: Because people are going to play the short term price perceived price reversion.
470.08s: Price as a mean reverting phenomenon is a little more difficult to discuss and quantify.
474.96s: Because it doesn't actually have mean reversion tendencies like something like volatility.
478.96s: But it does have extensions and retracements. We can see those quantify those. So yeah, when
484.16s: I look at this, it does seem like a pretty big move. So it doesn't surprise me to see people fading
490.16s: them. But man, this was bit up really, really heavy. Those 190s, they came in super heavy. I just
495.84s: thought it was interesting. It doesn't lead me to believe that downside is immediately coming. But
501.60s: I also saw in Google, Google, the 13d 187 and a half puts those came in at 22,407. So that can
511.84s: also be people that are getting into puts just to lock in profits, which to short term though,
517.20s: that's the argument against that. Always interesting. The market always has a way to leading to very
523.52s: interesting movements that can be difficult to explain. Now, let's say look at SoFi. So if I had a good
527.92s: move today and with SoFi, I got close to a reentry. So I had exited. I talked about that a while ago.
536.64s: Just because it was rotating sideways, starting to fall down, but it's a little too early. I want to
541.60s: see it above that 1603 handle. That's just because I want to see that the consolidation is held. I want
547.20s: to see that then it's building a base price continuation. And I genuinely do expect to see that
552.40s: because it was bit up really heavy today. The volume was overwhelmingly by side. So it looks like
557.20s: people are interested in it, but you never know. And that's why I trade the way that I do,
562.32s: especially with directional momentum slash breakout following strategies that I would apply to
567.20s: something like this. It's a very, very different approach and it's depending entirely on what price
572.72s: actually does. It's very little. My expectations, I do apply probabilistic assessments because it
577.44s: helps me size, figure out what risk reward makes sense. But I need to see it behaving as it should
584.88s: in air quotes because how should something behave, but this I want it to go up. So that's why
590.32s: we are holding tight right now. No SoFi position, but looking. And if it looks like it can hold
595.92s: us rally, then it will be time for reentry. As always, if there's anything you want me to take a look
601.04s: at, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
