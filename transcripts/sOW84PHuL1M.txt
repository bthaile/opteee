0.00s:  What is up, everybody? We got the apes, the outliers, the ape outliers. We got everybody
9.20s:  ready to dive in. There's actually a follow-up session from what we kicked off last week,
16.24s:  which was diving into Roryn Kitty's old trades. So the goal for today is to finish going
25.72s:  through some of his old trades. And then I think we should talk a little bit about kind
30.96s:  of what we see going on with GameStop today, because there's quite a few interesting
38.12s:  things I think that it's worth going in depth on. And I've gotten a handful of people
46.04s:  that have sent me some posts from like Super Stalking Stuff that we want to take a look
49.68s:  at. So I am looking forward to digging in with you all. For those that don't know, on the
58.08s:  last live stream, I decided to start dropping in where people in the live stream are from.
67.72s:  And take a look at the last one we did. This is essentially what we had. So we had people
75.16s:  from quite literally all over. I think we were missing Africa is a continent. And then
81.68s:  I think we need a little bit of like Northeastern over here. But I mean, other than that, we
87.60s:  have just about everything covered the Aussies. You know, I'm friends with the Aussies. I
92.16s:  spent some time in the military hanging around them. I still talk with them. So I feel
96.16s:  like they're innately covered to a degree. But yeah, I just thought this was so cool.
101.40s:  One of the things that I find so fascinating about the GameStop story is that it's this
105.60s:  thing that really has taken people from all different kinds of backgrounds and brings
111.20s:  them together. Like how literally how fun is that? For me, it's an absolute blast because
117.68s:  as a lot of you know, I'm a professional trader. It's what I do. And the way that I look
123.36s:  at the whole GameStop thing is probably a lot different than the way that a lot of other
128.04s:  people look at it. But it's still the fact that the same circumstance brings people
133.96s:  from literally all over the place into one spot. It kind of reminds me of the melting pot
139.84s:  that is trading or the melting pot that is the military. That's really what comes to
144.04s:  mind. The military is really, really good at pulling people together. So yeah, I just
150.52s:  get such a kick out of that. So let me grab the chat. I have to make sure that we say
155.44s:  hello to everybody and we get this party started. So let me grab this. So we got Dr.
164.52s:  Zeyes, Cedric Gravitarist, the Nye, Derschlup, lots of lots of familiar names, Reese Raptures,
173.48s:  Pam, Cedric, which I think is Cedareti Carlos, Zachariah, the fresh maker from Germany.
182.20s:  Do we have Germany in here? I think we have Germany. It would actually be really nice
189.88s:  if you could sort these by name that would be good. It doesn't look like I can easily.
195.56s:  I feel like we have Germany though. I feel like I literally just looked at that. We'll
201.76s:  type it in. We'll type it in. We'll see. I had that baby in. So we got Germany. I think
215.12s:  I think I'm seeing Amsterdam. And then we got Belgium. We got to keep our little thing
224.52s:  up to date here. I'm not going to lie as a very standard Westerner. I don't Holy,
234.84s:  is there like a big cultural difference between Germany and Belgium? Just seems so close.
247.28s:  I feel like they got to be so close to one another. Beer is a little different. One is beer,
260.76s:  one is chocolate. I guess that's fair. Yeah, because there's a, I had a friend in high school
265.68s:  whose dad was from Belgium and he had opened a chocolate shop. So I guess that makes sense.
270.32s:  Interesting. Well, cool. So we got people from all over the map. That's what we're
276.96s:  seeing here. So as always, if there's anything that you think we should take a look at or you
283.60s:  want to specifically look at, let me know because it is an open agenda. We're definitely going
288.56s:  to poke through some of these existing things like we've talked about, but I fully intend to pick
295.28s:  up where we left off. And I've gotten a few questions in the meantime. So one of them is about
303.84s:  the 5K share purchase history. We left off at the June 2020 Yolo update. So that's where we're
311.68s:  going to go. We like essentially are through a good bit of his previous trades to see what they
318.96s:  looked like and the delta between the positions and stuff. So I'm excited to keep moving this forward.
327.28s:  Get back into June. Here we go. So this is where we left off. So,
333.84s:  so a couple of things really stuck out to me from where what we did last time.
340.64s:  And as I analyze, I again, like I call it fingerprinting. And literally all it is is I'm trying to
346.72s:  identify the behaviors that are unique to a person as a trader. And again, I always feel the
355.20s:  need to remind people that from my lens, I'm not trying to deconstruct what Warren Kitty is doing
363.20s:  so that I can try to copy him. That's literally not it at all personally. The reason why I like
370.16s:  looking at his stuff is because the movements he's made as an investor in trader are naturally
377.84s:  fascinating to me. And it's because from a trading perspective, a lot of what he does
383.44s:  would not follow a standard, fully logical pattern. Not saying he's illogical, but when we're talking
390.32s:  about trading investing, the standard logic is make as much money as you can decrease risk.
396.08s:  Like those are really that's really the point of this. But every once in a while, you'll come across
400.80s:  anomalies that have different objectives. One of my friends, he's a YouTuber. And
406.80s:  I talked to him a lot about his preferences as a trader. And he literally has said multiple times
412.88s:  that like he doesn't really care that much about making money. He just loves trading that much.
418.16s:  Which again, to me is fucking crazy. But I also can understand that perspective. So a lot of the
425.28s:  things that I see the cat do are just so interesting to me because it highlights such an important
434.40s:  difference in motivating factor. If we look at the standard motivating factor,
439.60s:  make more money, reduce risk, ideally at the same time. If you can make a bunch of money with low
444.32s:  risk, that is generally the pinnacle. But then you can come across somebody like the cat who literally,
453.44s:  literally flips all of that all over the fucking place. It's crazy. The fact that when this dude came
461.76s:  back and we'll look at it in a second, but the fact that he goes through this process.
469.28s:  And even the amount of money he came back with, I find really interesting. The way that he trades
474.88s:  now, I can't help but find literally fascinating. If you followed my coverage or exploration, I should
482.00s:  say, of GameStop and my learning of it so far, you're probably exhausted from hearing me saying the
489.36s:  fascinating. But it is the honest truth. I've been a lifelong practitioner of markets.
497.04s:  And I have seen a lot from my start in 2007. You get a sense of what markets do, how people behave,
505.20s:  the different motivations and incentives for different participants. And then every once in a
509.84s:  while you come across a fucking anomaly. And that's part of the reason why this is just so
517.36s:  unbelievably interesting to me. Also shout out to all the apes because there's 69 of us in here
523.04s:  right now. And I can't help but notice that whenever we do these live streams, we really, we
528.32s:  seem to hover around that magical number for just a hot minute. It takes a, takes 69. It takes
536.08s:  a crowd to make it happen. So let's start with Dr. Sayez says, if you ever do merge, it should be
544.88s:  t-shirts that say fascinating and anomaly. That's hilarious. Yeah, that would be like probably the
550.08s:  worst merge launch ever, but it would be epically funny. But yeah, I really do find just about
558.40s:  everything pertaining to this just absolutely curious. So all right, let's talk about where we left
565.76s:  off. Here's what I noticed leading into this. When we were going through his previous trades,
571.04s:  we can see that he went through a very interesting scaling process. And the other thing that I found
577.04s:  so interesting about what he was doing is that he clearly was very risk tolerant right from the jump
586.24s:  because we've seen even this 100,000 portfolio flow. And it's been all over the map so far.
593.44s:  So we've seen it over $200,000, not all that long ago. And not that long before that, we've seen
599.68s:  it below $50,000. Right. So February 2020, $44,400, something like that, February 2020, $215,000.
613.04s:  Big difference. Then we go from April to May, back down sub 150. Then we go from May to June,
622.64s:  back down again, another 25k to 121. What I'm highlighting is from a normal traders perspective
630.40s:  that is insane volatility. And the way that we would typically move around those kinds of positions
637.36s:  is very different than this, which is why it's so damn interesting. So the other things that I
647.52s:  want to highlight from the last session is that we absolutely found that he is completely confident
653.04s:  averaging down as something is declining if he still believes in it, which clearly he did. He
659.60s:  continued to cost average, cost dollar average into the position, which is interesting. Now what I
666.80s:  noticed with that though is that he would do it with longer term options plays, longer term. I've
675.12s:  not seen him do that with some of these shorter term options plays, which I don't know if he does
680.48s:  or doesn't. I literally haven't looked past this since we discussed it last Saturday. So now we go
685.60s:  back in and pick up where we left off. The goal here was obviously to do a quick recap for anybody
691.12s:  that might not have missed it or just once the TLDR. That's essentially it. We have some very
696.32s:  clear behaviors and tendencies that we can identify for roaring kitty. So,
703.68s:  Cetric says, if I would buy huge amount of contract yellow clothes to the money on heavily
708.80s:  shorted stock, would the same thing not happen? You have to remind me what we're talking about
716.00s:  for that. Yeah, I'm not sure. You have to, Cetric, let me know what that means.
723.52s:  Cetric says, if you yellow 50K on a heavily shorted stock with options, could anybody have
731.20s:  launched it like that now? Because it wasn't just because it was shorted, 50K in options is nowhere
737.76s:  near enough. And the other thing is like, he didn't launch, like he doesn't have enough money at this
742.64s:  point to cause anything. That's just the reality of things. That's one of the craziest things about
748.24s:  this is, and this is one of the things I didn't know about him is he's using leverage via options.
755.20s:  The very first trades that we have of his, which is going to take me second, but it's worth showing
759.92s:  again, you just have to scroll all the way down here. Oh, yeah, somebody gave me a cheat code on
764.64s:  the last one. You guys have to tell me what the last, damn it. Somebody gave me like the specific
768.80s:  hot key to get to the bottom instead of having to do this like a freaking caveman, but we're here.
776.24s:  So if we go all the way back five years ago, you can see that literally his entire series of
783.12s:  positions are options. That's literally how he started doing this, which again, I did not know that.
791.76s:  Based on everything I heard, I had the impression that he was a stock trader that sometimes used
800.72s:  options to amplify the position, but I didn't take it that he was an options trader, which is what
806.00s:  I would classify this as he's absolutely a stock value investor at this point five years ago.
812.56s:  No doubt in my mind, but he's using options very, very strategically to create the leverage that he
819.04s:  wants his entire, his entire position is all options, which is really interesting to me.
825.36s:  I'm going to keep that other tab open just so that if we want to go back down to the bottom,
829.28s:  I don't have to play that scrolling game again, but this one will just take me a second to get to
834.24s:  June. A key of Vladimir says Eric, look at our case actual moves during January 2021. His
842.16s:  cost basis for the options that he held, which is a few thousand, but he was making up to 10 million
847.76s:  unrealized gains in a day in January 21. Well, yeah, let's see when we get there.
854.08s:  So let's figure out where we are here in June. In June, right now, we just started building a
861.28s:  very small stock position. We have 500 shares at a basis of five, 16. And the last price was
872.24s:  434. So let me grab, I think we were using Yahoo Finance. Yeah. I think that's what let us go and
878.24s:  like look at the specific chart back in time if I'm not mistaken. Because the on-demand feature in
885.04s:  thinkorswim was being super, super not reliable. Let's zoom this thing in, get rid of this. Here we go.
893.28s:  So now we want to go to 2021. We can go to May, maybe. Remember last time this gave us some problems.
904.24s:  And then let's take this to December, maybe. Of 21. Let's just go to the end there. Let's hit
916.80s:  apply. Let's see if this, yeah, see, it did this exact thing last time. Why does it do this last time?
923.52s:  Let's try doing like a six month daily. And see if this fixes it. We had the same exact problem
930.72s:  last time. I don't know why. And apparently we have an issue with it loading. What is wrong with
942.96s:  you? Okay, good. So now we have a six month daily. Now let's go back again. Let's try this one more
947.92s:  time. Let's just go to 2021. And I'm just going to essentially look at the whole year and see if
957.28s:  this will let us apply that date range. How does that look to you? Because I don't see anything that
967.36s:  looks even remotely close. What is this is so frustrating? Is there another charting tool that you
972.24s:  guys know? Because this is incredibly annoying. I guess I could just go back here and zoom in. I
981.52s:  just wish that I could go to the specific time. Like that would just be nice. I guess we can just
986.72s:  do this. This is fine. I'll get over it. I'll be okay. I don't know if I'm going to be okay.
991.84s:  Some kind of salty about this. Because this is the thing is like I want the scale to be correct.
999.60s:  So we got to get this 21 stuff out of there. There we go. Okay.
1005.68s:  Here we go. So we need to go to 2020. Here's June. Okay. We'll go off of here.
1015.44s:  So this is now using one week candles, which I don't want. I want daily candles, which then fast
1020.96s:  forwards me to today because I hate this. I hate this.
1030.08s:  2019, 2020. Okay. Gang, we got it. Man was that painful. We did it though. We did it.
1037.28s:  Also shout out to us. Well, really you, the apes. There's over a hundred of you now.
1044.16s:  So I think the next magical number we have to hit. Maybe you have to call a friend. It
1047.36s:  but is 169. I think is the next one. I think we cracked over 200 once. I think that was last
1055.36s:  weekend, actually. We'll see. We'll see if we can get the gang in town. All right. So let's take a
1061.52s:  look. This is what was going back in June. And what I want to, what I'm identifying now is actually
1069.92s:  how he behaved. So I'm going to move this over here so that we can essentially have these side-by-side.
1080.56s:  So I can see that the he got in at 516. So again, this is all split adjusted. So I don't know
1089.60s:  how many adjustments happened in this time frame. So I don't know actually like where on the
1094.00s:  nominal price he would be. I'm just kind of following along with the behavior. So this is from the
1102.40s:  end of June. We know that he started doing his updates towards the end of the month. And at this
1108.00s:  point, he had 500 shares that he accumulated again. His basis was 516. So super small stocks
1115.76s:  position. But then we can see another interesting behavior emerge. This is different. This is
1121.84s:  completely different than what we saw previously. And it is 100% worth noting is take a look 2021,
1131.36s:  2021, 2021, right? So we still have these base positions that are in 2021. And we can see the value
1141.76s:  of these positions. The reason why this matters is because he's still playing two things I can
1149.84s:  clearly identify. He's playing options that are further out in time. And he's still playing options
1157.04s:  that are out of the money. Very important note that these are out of the money options that he's
1163.28s:  playing that far out in time. That's a very specific kind of options trade to take, especially in a
1169.92s:  longer term time frame, which we can talk about that really quick so that you understand why I'm
1174.96s:  highlighting that to you. So I don't know if on demand let's just go back far enough. Does this
1180.48s:  let us go back to 20? Let's see, can we get back to 21? We can. Great. And we can go back to 20. This
1188.64s:  is perfect. So let's go back to the end of June. And let's take a look at his actual portfolio.
1195.44s:  Don't worry about these weird bars and stuff. It's just because it's on demand being stupid.
1201.84s:  Let you just let us load for a second. I'm literally going to recreate his portfolio so that we
1206.64s:  can see exactly what it looked like, which was one of my goals on the last session, but we just
1211.04s:  couldn't go back far enough. Again, don't pay attention at all to this candle. It's misleading you.
1216.72s:  It's just because it's on demand and it's broken data. So just take it for what it's worth. But what we
1221.44s:  can do is get rid of all of these other positions. This was I think an example we were doing at some
1227.68s:  other point. So we'll just clear out the whole portfolio. And then let's scoop up his exact position.
1234.56s:  So the first thing we have is 500 500 shares, 500 and we got those five
1244.16s:  Hyundai. His basis was five six in five six five one six six three five. Just being super precise.
1259.52s:  I'm going to get rid of all these other we were doing we've done a million examples. That's why
1262.72s:  you see all these other simulated trades in here. Okay. So that's his basis here.
1267.84s:  And we also have a bunch of options trades. So we have let's go to we'll do the 21st first.
1283.20s:  So in 21 he has the 16 April 12 calls super far out of the money as far as you can go.
1291.04s:  So super far out of the money. And he has 500 of these. I love the leverage that this dude uses is
1305.28s:  classic. Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. He doesn't have 500. He literally has a thousand of these ones. So
1311.36s:  is a thousand of these at 40 cents. Next option and next option he has is in Jan 1521.
1331.92s:  He has the 20s. What are these? These are like a six delta. This is crazy. So he's buying tiny
1339.68s:  little delta's. This is nuts. This is absolutely like mind boggling to me. And he got them for six cents.
1351.76s:  Mind boggling. This I'm not even going to lie. This reminds me of like amateur options trader movements.
1361.36s:  And I'm not saying that he is. He obviously isn't like he's probably even more skilled than I am.
1366.24s:  Not that that's like that high of a threshold to cross. But just these trades are just so
1372.08s:  counterintuitive for what would generally make sense based on what I've heard from his thesis,
1377.12s:  which we'll talk a little bit about. So it's 15 Jan. He has another. So he has the 20s, the 15s.
1384.00s:  Then he goes into 16 October. And he has the eights, which again, super far out of the money.
1393.12s:  And he has 500 of those for six cents. So he's buying a bunch of super cheap options.
1401.12s:  Super cheap options. Back here. Then we have. So now
1413.20s:  now we start getting into near term stuff because he doesn't have anything in in
1419.36s:  hog. And he goes to July 17th. Okay, so important note here. Again, for fingerprinting important note.
1430.08s:  The last two, the last two series, let me grab this. The last two series that we're going to pull
1436.64s:  in here. Take a look. 17 July. What do you notice about all of the expiration choices he's selected?
1444.24s:  What do you pick up? There's one very clear thing I see so far. And again, this is the beginning
1450.72s:  of the fingerprinting. I don't know what happens next. But this is something that pops into my brain
1455.20s:  that I think is important to call out here. And then we'll see what it looks like.
1461.76s:  All monthly explorations exactly, Mr. Off Putin. So we are not using weeklies. We go right by the
1469.04s:  weeklies and we were just using monthly's, which is smart, by the way, that makes sense to me.
1474.24s:  I totally understand why he would do that. So we have these. Did I already grab these? Yes,
1479.76s:  so in July now, we need the 12s in July. Again, so far out of the money, so far out of the money.
1488.48s:  And for these, he grabbed 500. And he got them for 18 cents.
1506.08s:  And then the last one he has is the six, which makes way more sense, still really low delta.
1513.28s:  He has 300 of these. And he grabbed these for 0.1367. What does that tell me?
1524.32s:  When I just typed in 1367 for these options, what does that tell me? There's a very specific thing I
1531.28s:  can understand from that in this instance. Any ideas?
1535.68s:  It's another important note, again, with respect to fingerprinting.
1546.88s:  Dan says he's using options to grow his shares. The shares are the asset and the options he
1551.84s:  trades help grow that I actually don't agree with you. I really don't agree with you.
1556.00s:  The reason why I don't agree with you is because he's been trading GameStop for a long time now.
1560.56s:  And now he's just starting to purchase shares. And the shares are a trivial amount of the portfolio.
1568.08s:  He grabbed 500 shares at 516. If we go back through this archive of all of his positions,
1575.04s:  he's trading options. So I actually don't interpret it that way at all. I view it as he's just
1582.00s:  trading GameStop to the upside. I don't think he's looking at this as I want this asset. And I'm
1588.40s:  going to use the shares to use options to get me to the asset. He had the money to buy 500 shares
1595.36s:  when he first opened his account. It was worth about the same. So I don't actually see that here at all.
1608.16s:  Okay, so what this tells me, the fact that this is he bought 300 of these 17 July 20s
1617.04s:  at 0.1367. What this tells me is he's averaging in. You can't transact at that price. There's no price
1626.32s:  that can transact at that. The reason why this matters to me is because when I look at his basis,
1634.40s:  I can see, for example, here, these 15 calls in 15 Jan 21. They're at 18 cents. He got to fill
1643.60s:  all at once on those. That was 500 of them. These 40s or I'm sorry, these 12 calls out in 12 April
1652.48s:  16. He has a thousand of those. He got them for 40. He was able to get a fill on all of those at
1658.64s:  once at one price. These are examples of positions he's averaging into. I would wager more often than
1665.28s:  not. It's not concrete. Again, to always keep it a buck with you guys. I can't say that with
1671.28s:  certainty because it could be that as he's getting this one order filled, it's getting
1676.80s:  pieced up and he's just returned with an average price. That's like that. But the reason why I
1682.96s:  deduce more likely than not that these are averaged into is that if he's able to get fills
1688.88s:  on bigger positions further out in time, which are less liquid, he's very likely to be able to get
1695.68s:  full fills on positions near a term that are smaller. So I think he's averaging into these.
1700.96s:  Again, that doesn't mean anything outright. It's just another small data point that I can key into
1707.92s:  when I'm looking at these. Now, the other thing I noticed is I have to update some of these prices
1712.40s:  because they're wrong. I was using the last updated price. So the 16 April, he got those for 40. That's
1718.16s:  correct. The next one here is the 15 change 21 20s. He got those for 0952.0952.
1731.92s:  And then the 15s, he got for 18 cents. That's correct. The 8s, he got for 2880. So 0.2880.
1745.44s:  Then the 500 of the 12s, he got for 18 cents. That's correct. And then this one's correct.
1752.40s:  Okay. So this is where we sit currently. Let me get rid of that slice for now.
1761.92s:  And let me catch up on the chat. Vladimir says,
1771.12s:  Rohan Titty says, wasn't that when he realized it had high short interest? I think he knew that for a while
1776.56s:  to poorly speaking. So let me grab the YouTube channel for him.
1784.56s:  And we'll take a quick little peak C.
1791.92s:  A key. Let's go to videos. I think it was probably in a live because funny enough both he and I
1799.12s:  really like doing live streams. I think we both like live streams way more than videos because he
1803.12s:  has way more live streams than he does videos. Four years ago. So okay. So he's already talking about
1812.24s:  a squeeze here. What's the date on this? I forgot. There's somewhere you hover. There it is.
1822.08s:  Four September 2020. So he's talking about a squeeze here on four September. So it's about
1832.96s:  the same time frame. So here's his position as it sits here. So now let's take a look at what his
1843.12s:  next position looks like. So we can close this one out. That's June. Let's get to July. In the meantime,
1848.32s:  let's see what some of these look like. I think these are all gifts.
1856.96s:  Love that. Absolutely love that. Okay. So now we're in July.
1863.36s:  And he's now added a much more significant. A much more significant.
1875.92s:  Share position. And let's see what's rolled off.
1884.16s:  I got to slide this a little further out of the way. So here's what's rolled off.
1888.56s:  16 April is still there. Jan 15 is still there. Double time. Triple time. He's added. He's added to it.
1899.28s:  October is still there. 17 July is gone. And that would that would have been eight.
1907.68s:  So he did not. This is another really, really important note. Because I know a lot of people all the
1921.52s:  times speculate like did he exercise? Did he exercise? This is another example where I can tell he
1928.40s:  did not exercise these options. There's a very specific way I can tell he did not exercise any of
1936.08s:  these options that we see in here. From his previous portfolio because these came due.
1941.12s:  These 17 July's they rolled off and he ended up buying shares.
1947.28s:  Rointit he says not enough cash to exercise them. That's a great point. But that is not what tells
1952.00s:  me definitively. There's another thing that's even more certain than not having enough capital
1956.96s:  because it always could be argued. He added capital to the account and we have no way to prove
1962.08s:  or disprove that by the way. We really don't eat it could or could not have happened we wouldn't know.
1972.08s:  Cost average. That's exactly correct.
1977.36s:  So both lands and H or spot on. I can look at the change in his cost basis. Here we have 500 shares
1986.40s:  at 516 and change. Now we have 10,000 way more shares at an average of 411332. We obviously
1996.48s:  average down the lowest basis he had in here was an eight. Well, let me go back over here. Sorry.
2004.48s:  The lowest basis he had in here was a six in a 12. So the way that this would work is if he
2010.16s:  exercised these he would have taken 500 shares times 100. His basis would be this $12 plus the debit
2019.76s:  he paid in this case, $0.18. So it would have been 1218 drive his basis up. Same thing even with this
2026.00s:  six, this six 1367 would have moved this basis up not down. Sedrick says so we rolled them. No, he did not
2034.08s:  roll them. He just took a loss is what happened. He absolutely grabbed more options across the board,
2044.32s:  but there's nothing to roll. So if you want to call it a roll, there's nothing necessarily structurally
2050.00s:  wrong with calling it that, but it's essentially not what happened though. Those would have came down
2057.28s:  for a full loss. So he would have lost the investment on both of these. These two are now gone
2063.68s:  right now. In case you guys don't know, I was talking to my mom earlier and she's just sending me
2067.76s:  pictures of her spice cabinet, which is hilarious. So I actually didn't ask the ask for these, but
2076.00s:  I guess I'm glad that she sent them. Now I know what my mom's spice cabinet looks like. If any of
2080.16s:  you guys need to take a look at a spice cabinet, I have a great example. But no, I don't think he
2087.12s:  rolled them. I think these just came off for a full loss. He would have lost the investment on them.
2091.68s:  Maybe he salvaged a little bit of value left. We could figure that out technically, but I don't
2096.00s:  think it matters much. Sedrick says, maybe I don't understand rolling. I thought it was just
2101.20s:  selling your option by the next ones. Yeah, that's not completely wrong. That rolling is fake.
2108.00s:  That's the way to think about it. And the reason why I say it that way is because people
2111.68s:  grossly misunderstand rolling. So there is a video about rolling options. This is another video
2121.92s:  about rolling options. And then this is a video about common myths about rolling options.
2129.12s:  But Cliff notes version of what a rolled option is. It's literally when we close a position,
2135.12s:  open a new position, and we mentally tie the accounting between the two. That's it. But it's
2141.68s:  literally just closing a position, opening a new one. So normally when we're rolling a position,
2146.72s:  it's like if it's a sold option that's underwater and we're trying to manage it. But
2152.40s:  yeah, it's again, it's just fake. It's essentially closing a position, opening a new one,
2156.64s:  designed to make you feel better. So anyways, these would have came off. These are gone,
2160.48s:  boom, boom, gone. Now we have to size all these up though to represent what he has.
2166.32s:  So now what he has, I have to slide it over here so I can see. He now has 10,000 shares.
2173.60s:  And he has 10,000 shares at a basis of 4.11332. And he has 1,000 of the 16. These are the same.
2189.12s:  These did not change. He bought another 500 of these to bring this up to a thousand of these 20s.
2196.88s:  And it brought his basis down again. Important note, he's averaging down.
2203.28s:  726. He's averaging down into these as well. He has 1,000 of these 15s. And he got 1,000 of them now
2214.96s:  4, 14, averaging down, continuing to average down. And then he has 1,000 of these 16,
2225.84s:  oct 28s. And he averaged down these as well. He has these now for 2, 19. And at this point,
2237.20s:  just to show you what the stock was trading at, first I need to update the date in this so that
2244.48s:  it shows you correct. We have to go back to 20. Where am I July of 2020? Is that right?
2253.36s:  July 2020, we're at the end. And then I need to bring this back to July of 2020 as well.
2260.72s:  Here. And the current spot price was $4 in a penny. So I'll throw that here so that we
2276.88s:  could see what his PNL, well, we already know what it was, but just so that you could see his full
2280.56s:  position. So this is what he's holding right now. And that's where GameStop is currently trading.
2288.48s:  And this is looking at June 30th.
2293.68s:  Cedric says you have a video on CFDs. No, we don't really trade CFDs much here in the States.
2299.04s:  It's actually really difficult to trade them. And I don't like CFDs at all. I think they're
2302.64s:  like terrible, terrible products. So I don't trade them much myself. And I wouldn't,
2312.56s:  you know, turn, I wouldn't like talk about something that I don't have experience in. So that
2318.32s:  one I wouldn't be able to help. Sorry. Zacharias says no wonder Wall Street Betsy's ragging on
2328.72s:  crazy even for him. Yeah, absolutely insane. Literally absolutely insane.
2333.60s:  So this is what it looked like for him. We have to go to the end of July, which is when this came
2343.20s:  through. Right now the chart is updating. So again, don't pay attention to the latest candle. It's
2352.40s:  all it's all bullshit. Zacharias says the most hydrated man on YouTube. Yeah, dude, I take,
2358.64s:  drinking fluids very seriously. It's because I, I sweat like a horn church. So
2365.52s:  and I'm typically physically active. The whole herniated disc sciatic thing is still
2370.96s:  kind of fucking me up, but not terribly. So yeah, I'm still going to the gym every day.
2381.12s:  Still got to keep hydrated. So let's see kind of just oscillating sideways here.
2392.72s:  And so this is what his position looks like. 112K. Nothing really jumping out of me yet.
2403.84s:  Let's see what he's talking about here. I'm curious what the tenor was of the conversation.
2417.36s:  Humulating GME 2, painfully boring, market makers have pinned for for I don't think this is true,
2426.72s:  but I know people use this all the time.
2438.88s:  The only catalyst is whether or not GameStop can transition online, which is really interesting,
2443.76s:  because this is four years ago. I think Amazon should buy them likely considering it. That's funny.
2453.76s:  They were still doing well in sales.
2459.44s:  Lance says gotta stay hydrated. Don't want to silver bullet. Yeah, well,
2462.40s:  that's kind of the problem, you know, with all those fucking corpsmen out there, they're real,
2466.48s:  real excited to try to, you know, take a core temperature, which on the marine officer side of
2473.60s:  the house, that is literally like it's literally not going to happen. You would, I would rather die
2481.92s:  than go through that, especially if in front of like the dudes or something, like there's no
2486.64s:  fucking way. I would fight the corpsman. There's literally no way. So yeah, you gotta watch,
2491.52s:  you gotta watch them corpsmen. They were real stoked whenever that process comes up.
2499.52s:  Reeks.
2501.12s:  We're into the said, did GameStop just change its logo? Let's see.
2521.36s:  Doesn't look it.
2526.40s:  Somebody says that there's something new like six months ago, but I don't see it.
2530.24s:  I don't see a change.
2538.96s:  Titi says I saw it on Newton's video today. I'll text him. I didn't watch this video today.
2546.64s:  Let me text them.
2560.16s:  I'll see what he says. I just asked him.
2581.36s:  But yeah, this, I mean, this looks, looks the same to me.
2584.72s:  All right. So that's the end of July. I want to finish going through this post first.
2594.88s:  So this looks like he's starting to win people over.
2601.12s:  And you can tell that about four years ago, people are,
2608.00s:  yeah, people are starting to come around.
2618.88s:  Which that's really interesting. So it tells me it took about a year, it seems.
2625.76s:  Also, there's 151 apes in here, which is sick, but we're very close to 169. So if there is,
2635.44s:  maybe maybe if your grandma is interested in GameStop or something, it'd be a perfect time to
2640.08s:  invite her in and let her know that she can be part of a childish joke.
2650.40s:  Okay. This is just a lot of people talking. I was curious. I'm going to be timely, month, and let's
2655.68s:  see what this is. Huge news going to be month and update on Monday. What's your target
2664.56s:  sitting on eight calls? No precise target just up. Okay.
2676.08s:  GCA says, please don't ever say 69 and grandma in the same sentence again. I'm just saying GC,
2682.56s:  I mean, I don't know how old your grandma is, but if she did anything in like the 60s or 70s,
2688.80s:  she's probably more familiar with that number than you are, I would imagine. So we just got to
2693.76s:  keep it a buck out here. I wouldn't don't start disengrama.
2704.72s:  No, no, same. Okay. So here we go. Massive, massive, massive change, massive change.
2714.08s:  112, the end of July, 612 in August.
2724.16s:  So let's see what's changed.
2735.76s:  Nothing. Nothing's changed. All the positions are the same. He's just held them.
2742.72s:  And we can see the total gain here. Oh, that's interesting.
2754.32s:  And value is 112.
2770.32s:  Value is 112. Value is 612.
2774.40s:  I think he added money.
2783.68s:  I think he added money here.
2787.20s:  I'm grabbing a quick little workbook so that we can look together.
2791.68s:  So, because here's what I see.
2799.20s:  I see he had 112, 238, 78.
2805.60s:  And then I see he moves to 619 or 612, 191, 84.
2822.80s:  So this is a $449,000 essentially a $500,000 variance, which is not compensated by this total gain.
2845.52s:  So the other thing I see here is he's aggressively saving.
2850.80s:  Because here his portfolio went up 441, 410, 93.
2860.48s:  So then the variance that's not captured here, like 58 grand.
2875.28s:  Interesting.
2879.44s:  And it looks like he added some options. You guys are showing me the 17s.
2885.28s:  So now he has oct. And then 12345.
2894.88s:  520, 21, expertise. Let's see.
2899.04s:  Yep. Okay. So he still has the oct.
2904.72s:  He still has the Jan.
2913.76s:  One is in 15s. He added 17s.
2917.76s:  And he also added 10s. And he still has the 8th.
2923.60s:  So let's add those.
2929.04s:  So let's do.
2939.28s:  We need to go to Jan 21, which again about still really long expiration.
2944.00s:  That's where the vast majority of his money is.
2948.40s:  And he added the 17s and the tens.
2952.40s:  So the 17s super far out of the money.
2955.04s:  He had as a thousand of those he likes round numbers.
2958.16s:  And he likes the positions being about the same.
2962.08s:  And he got those for 15 cents.
2967.20s:  And then he also added the tens closer to the money.
2973.04s:  Still low delta, thousand of those.
2977.36s:  And he got these for 20 cents.
2981.60s:  Those got hit at the same price.
2985.60s:  All right. Let's double check.
2993.60s:  So we have 10,000 at war 11.
2999.28s:  That's good.
2999.92s:  These April's would have come down.
3003.60s:  So he probably would have taken profit on those.
3008.32s:  Oh no, that's damn it.
3011.52s:  I took the wrong ones down.
3012.48s:  I'm an idiot.
3013.12s:  I'm a damn.
3014.48s:  I have to add those back.
3016.48s:  All right.
3016.96s:  Let me finish checking the other ones.
3018.16s:  Then I'll add those back.
3018.88s:  Stupid.
3020.00s:  I got to go this way.
3021.92s:  So we have the 20s.
3024.08s:  We have the 17s.
3025.84s:  And I reorganize these or no, that would be slick.
3030.48s:  Apparently not.
3031.28s:  That would have just been too convenient.
3033.60s:  So we have the 20s, 17s, 15s, 10s, 8s.
3037.76s:  Okay.
3038.96s:  So I just got to add those April ones back real quick.
3046.64s:  And he hasn't really added more to these April's,
3048.64s:  which I find interesting.
3051.28s:  And again, these were the 12s.
3054.16s:  And he has a thousand of those.
3057.76s:  And he got into these for 40 cents.
3063.28s:  So now he was trading for like $6.68 here.
3077.28s:  Cool.
3080.72s:  Yeah.
3081.04s:  So it looks like he added money to the account.
3086.40s:  That's one of the things I noticed here.
3088.72s:  Okay.
3093.76s:  Hockey nuts says cash dropped and he added 15,
3098.56s:  Jan 17 calls.
3099.36s:  Yeah.
3099.68s:  So he used cash for sure.
3102.80s:  But the point I was making before about the likelihood of him adding money
3107.76s:  is because he didn't.
3111.84s:  This doesn't account for the difference between what is the account was before
3116.00s:  and what it is now. So it tells me that something moved around in the account. What exactly? I'm not
3123.60s:  positive. But something here moved around for sure. Roryntady says he was building a long-dated
3130.96s:  gamma ramp. I don't actually think that myself personally. And it's for a bunch of different reasons.
3139.20s:  But the main thing is like none of these positions are even like remotely close to causing anything
3145.84s:  like that. Even in a stock that's hard to borrow, these are still really, really small positions.
3151.12s:  And by going this far out in time, it really will depend on entirely where the stock is around
3157.04s:  this point. The entire purpose and function, I have a video about gamma.
3162.88s:  So I have a video here that talks about essentially what that actually looks like and how that works.
3181.44s:  And what I notice pretty clearly is when we're talking about a gamma squeeze, there's like very,
3190.24s:  very specific conditions that lead to it. So one of the things that I would wager is like,
3198.24s:  what these being so far out in time, there's essentially a null factor there. And it'll be so
3203.52s:  dependent on what the underlying is trading at as we get closer. So I don't even think he was
3208.16s:  viewing it as some sort of gamma ramp. I think here it's mostly him just playing leveraged,
3215.52s:  which is again, like as I look across the bulk of his exposure, like that's exactly what I see him
3222.24s:  continuing to do is gain leverage. Like that's exactly what this is. Let's August, here's September,
3231.28s:  612 to 832. Same size across the board, same options across the board. So he's just holding.
3245.44s:  He's still just holding. 16-Sep,
3262.72s:  same. No change. Didn't add any shares. What I'm trying to identify now,
3274.96s:  is when do these ox roll off? I want to know when he catches in on those, assuming that he does.
3281.44s:  But again, here's another prime time example of something that is just fascinating.
3287.52s:  In my opinion, there's no reason to cash in on these right away. However,
3293.68s:  if this were my trade, I would have a resting stop loss. So that if it does start to dive down,
3301.76s:  I would still get out and capture most of this profit or this profit, I should say.
3308.16s:  So my question then becomes, does he do that? I don't think he does. My guess is if these start
3314.64s:  trading down, he would just take them to the downside. That's my guess. But let's see. So it takes us
3320.24s:  to September. Oh, he does a bunch of intramont updates. That's interesting. Let's take a quick
3330.48s:  look at this because I still think he's adding money by the way. Let's take a look at these ones.
3344.32s:  I'm going to move this over. Then let's grab this again.
3348.88s:  And let's take a look together. So here, let's just do a total gain.
3363.52s:  Just to make this a little easier to compare, not have to rebuild at each time.
3368.96s:  Little gain, cash, value.
3379.04s:  You guys already know it's got to be formatted, right?
3384.32s:  So this was one's a sub date, one step, one step, one step.
3392.64s:  Here are one of those.
3402.88s:  And okay. So game stop here.
3408.48s:  Total gain is 652, 610, 93.
3418.96s:  Cash, 8391, 84.
3424.88s:  Value, 823, 391, 84.
3430.32s:  Okay. So now, let's see what happens.
3445.44s:  This is 16 step,
3457.92s:  gain 802,
3461.20s:  910, 93.
3468.40s:  Cash, 8538,
3475.20s:  804.
3478.24s:  Value, 973,
3481.68s:  83804.
3485.36s:  So now what we can do is just a quick analysis.
3490.56s:  And we can look at the change.
3514.40s:  So now we can see a few things. The first thing is the total value of the portfolio
3536.40s:  moved by 150,000. And the total gain moved by 153, 153,
3549.20s:  so this looks completely fine, like these line up perfectly, right?
3553.12s:  So this plus this equals this. So this tells me that no money is moved.
3558.64s:  So now we continue.
3561.28s:  Dr. Zayah says he holds the same position until 19.
3566.00s:  Yeah, that's cool.
3566.80s:  What, what I'm in, Dr. Zayah, well, for everybody, I don't know if you guys know,
3571.68s:  the whole point of this live stream is to go through this in detail.
3576.80s:  So I respect that you are providing the read ahead.
3580.88s:  But what I'm doing is I'm analyzing not just what changes he makes to his position.
3585.68s:  I'm analyzing what happens to the cash, how he behaves with respect to stuff like that.
3593.76s:  So that's my objective here.
3603.04s:  So now, total gain, can you guys see this excel sheet, by the way?
3610.00s:  I can't tell how much is on the screen. I can try to squish it down a bunch.
3613.12s:  TG is 111127.33.
3624.16s:  And then cash, what I'm going to do actually is make this a little more convenient for me.
3632.72s:  So this is just part of like my general workflow.
3636.08s:  I try to not have, I don't like skipping cells when filling stuff in because it's annoying.
3642.24s:  So what I'll do is I'll move like those calculated cells to the end, like over here,
3647.20s:  something like this.
3651.84s:  Okay, so cash, see like this is, this is a giant difference, 250, 016.79.
3660.08s:  That's a giant change.
3661.44s:  Value 150111679.
3676.32s:  So something specific is going on here.
3691.60s:  So like this,
3707.28s:  here, money moved. I can tell you money moved, right?
3712.56s:  Because again, what I'm doing is I'm looking at the variance in the value of the portfolio.
3719.20s:  That tells me it's 527,000. I can look at the variance in total gains and then the cash.
3729.36s:  And then if these don't line up, something moved. So between these, these two added,
3738.48s:  gives me 549,000, which should account for that total delta. This should be that, but it's not.
3744.64s:  So in this case, it's very clear that money moved. And again, this is the whole point
3754.56s:  of going through these. And also the other thing that I just noticed is, look at this. See,
3759.12s:  this is why you have to trust, but verify you got to look at everything because this isn't the same
3764.32s:  right? October is gone. So he's now down in options position. So very likely.
3775.36s:  So very likely, this is something that he offloaded. Like he obviously wouldn't have taken it,
3780.32s:  well, he could have taken it into expiration, but we're not we're not there at expiration.
3784.24s:  So this is still 22 September, September, October. So then in that case, he would have unwound
3792.56s:  his oct.
3797.52s:  And then what again, this is another important part of the fingerprinting.
3803.60s:  Because today's date in here is 22 September. Was it here in 16 sep? It was here in 16 sep.
3811.84s:  So between 16, between 16 sep in 20s, 22 sep is when he unwound that position.
3820.48s:  And again, the reason why that matters is because these were expiring on 16 oct.
3828.88s:  So he probably took them down right after this, I would imagine. If not right before this,
3834.96s:  about a month early. Again, that's a massive, massive, massive, important piece of data.
3842.64s:  Is because it tells me he didn't hold this all the way into expiration like he like we've seen
3850.08s:  in a few others. So this is now gone. Also Newton just hit me back.
3860.08s:  Oh, I see what he's talking about.
3871.84s:  So Newton shot me a text with what he was looking at. Let me see if I can show you.
3882.88s:  That we got to stand up.
3890.16s:  So what Newton's talking about is, I don't know if you can see, let me actually,
3897.44s:  let me grab this really fast. He's talking about this.
3907.68s:  So I don't know what that is, but it is.
3913.52s:  Cedric says was a month ago. Okay, got it. So they just changed the color. But what's also interesting.
3926.96s:  Interesting. What's also interesting is if you look at the little icon, it's the same Reggie Red S.
3936.88s:  So that's interesting. They didn't change the little cookie note thing or whatever the hell that the
3942.24s:  chip or I don't know what the fuck it's called, but you know what I'm talking about.
3948.16s:  All Poon says why not track is price paid. Yeah, that's a dog.
3954.96s:  Are you are you following along with us, homie? That's that's what all of this is. It's exactly what I'm looking at.
3962.72s:  Flavicon. Okay, cool. Thank you. That's what it is. So yeah, so the logo now is all black, but the
3968.96s:  Flavicon is still red and black. No idea if that means anything. Flavicon. Sorry, Cedric, you got
3976.40s:  me out here saying Flavicon. I'll say whatever it is because I don't know what it's called. I'll call it
3981.12s:  the fucking Flavicon. Right? So you got me out here looking dumber than I already look. So thanks
3990.00s:  for that, I suppose. Didn't quite feel like I deserved that kind of treatment, but okay,
3998.40s:  I thought we might have had an understanding with one another. Also, you already know we got to get
4003.36s:  the dinner order started tonight. I'm feeling probably Buffalo Wild Wings again. I'm on like a
4009.92s:  shitty food. Oh, Mexican sounds good though. Shit. All right, there's the question. Is it Mexican?
4017.52s:  Or is it Buffalo Wild Wings?
4022.08s:  Rory Titty says Flavia Flav, are you even old enough to know who that is? I don't think so. I
4027.12s:  don't know. I don't know anything about him. I think he had like the big clocks, right? Was that his
4033.84s:  thing? Or is that somebody else? Yeah, the big clocks.
4051.12s:  Poppy chicken, Mexican. Yeah, boy. Okay.
4055.36s:  I think I like the flavor of love. So it looks like we might have to run up.
4064.56s:  H says you've been on a Mexican terror lately, brass. I know it's been it's been like on fleek.
4069.28s:  Everybody says I always order barbecue, but I'm gonna text Mel. See what she would see what she
4078.24s:  says. I'm gonna say Mexican or B-dubs. We'll see what she comes back with.
4086.80s:  We will see. Yeah, so anyways,
4096.08s:  now we know, oh, let's see. Oh, Mel votes B-dubs. That actually surprised me a little bit.
4103.36s:  I might have Mexican fooded her out to be honest. I don't actually blame her entirely because
4112.08s:  I've been running, I've been running Mexican pretty regularly, but she's down for some B-dubs.
4118.64s:  So we'll get that order started. Grab that, grab that. I order the same shit every single time.
4125.68s:  So it takes me like two seconds done and done.
4138.72s:  Vladimir Alpoutin says I must be blind because your comms don't track his cost bases that I see.
4143.44s:  Oh, I'm not I'm not tracking the cost bases here. The cost bases here doesn't matter at all.
4148.56s:  So all I'm doing here is I'm looking for changes in cash movement. That's all. That's that's
4156.80s:  the entire purpose of this section. So what where I'm tracking his cost bases for the trades is
4162.96s:  in here so that I can track the difference from movements and positions. But the entire point
4170.56s:  of this up here is literally just seeing when money flows in and flows out. And again,
4176.08s:  it's clear as day. If these two don't match, this tells me right away that there's a variance of
4182.80s:  some sort that's driven by cash. Oh, I just got a long text from Newton. Okay.
4191.68s:  I'm just reading through to make sure I'm not saying anything I shouldn't say.
4198.24s:  Okay. So Newton says they've rebranded a lot of their in-house hardware
4204.48s:  accessories from a tricks to this. I actually don't I don't know what a tricks is.
4217.76s:  What's a tricks?
4234.80s:  Oh, yeah.
4236.24s:  Is that it? What is a tricks?
4241.68s:  A tricks. I've heard him say that before.
4251.60s:  I have no clue. He deep in fundamentals. Yeah. I don't know what this means.
4256.48s:  They've rebranded a lot of their in-house hardware accessories from a tricks to this.
4266.32s:  Okay. Thank you, Agent Per, you to bomb. So Agent Per says it's just like an accessory brand.
4272.00s:  Okay. Got it. So and then he says, he says I think it's okay. I'm not a business person and I don't
4280.56s:  know to what extent the SEC and lawsuits impacted GameStop and Ryan Cohen's work.
4285.44s:  NFT marketplace was failure because of SEC as an example. But I don't but I feel like it
4291.84s:  would have been a no brainer to rebrand everything in 2021 and use a logo that the community
4296.56s:  would identify, pump out, yeah, higher margin merge. Yeah. Okay. Got it. Super helpful for
4304.72s:  my boy, Newton. And let me catch up to you guys. Day swag says any discrepancies would be
4312.00s:  RK adding money from external accounts. Yeah. It would be money moving. It would absolutely be
4318.48s:  money moving in some capacity. So Vladimir off Poon says, Day swag, no, he's selling some contracts.
4324.48s:  No, that doesn't that doesn't drive because if he's selling contracts and not reinvesting it,
4330.08s:  guess where it goes right here, amigo. So that's why his cash went up is because selling contracts
4337.76s:  and then he did something with like he didn't do anything with the cash. So when there's a variance,
4343.44s:  again, that's why I'm tracking this when there's a variance between the account value after
4348.88s:  accounting for total gain and cash. Vladimir off puttons says he buys other contracts, but he didn't.
4356.48s:  Right? Like I dog, I don't know what's going on with you today off Putin. Normally you are on
4362.00s:  Putin, but you are off Putin right now. You're really off Putin. That's why it's literally what
4368.96s:  we're looking at. There's no variance in any of these. There's no added contracts, no added lots,
4374.24s:  no, no new contracts added to this. There's no new shares added to this. No change, price paid.
4380.64s:  There's no change in any of it. But again, what I can see is that there is a change in value.
4389.04s:  And again, for off Putin, this is where you're on Putin, because again, I agree. I think some of
4396.24s:  this is from the options that he closed out for a profit. But when you close an option out for a
4401.04s:  profit, it's going to get placed into cash. Look at change in price paid. Sure. So we have price
4413.36s:  paid down here. So we have 411. We have the 10 calls at 20. We have the 15s at 14. We have the
4430.64s:  17s at 15. We have the 16 April 21s at 40. And we have the 21, the 15 Jan 21s 20s. These are the
4446.16s:  same exact things. Nothing change, man. Again, that's that's my point is that this tells me that money
4454.08s:  moved from the account. So none of these positions changed. From his last update, we had more cash
4461.92s:  show up from his other options place that was not rolled into new positions. Nothing changed.
4467.84s:  But there is a variance in his account value that I can see. So because of that variance, let me
4475.04s:  make sure. Yeah, so you guys can see that. It's this column here that I'm most concerned about.
4480.40s:  This column shows me variance. So again, I'm tracking all of those things. That's why that's
4486.64s:  literally why I'm looking at this. And based on looking at this again, like money moved in this
4492.88s:  scenario, the value delta of the portfolio here is 527. And what it should have been considering
4500.32s:  these two is 549. So this tells me money came out of the account more likely than not like 22k
4507.68s:  moved. Don't aware. Don't know why, but it moved. I can see it.
4513.68s:  So we continue our digging. But before we continue our digging, I got to go grab our little man
4522.96s:  Thor. So I will be right back. I got to grab the dude. Quick. What? I would say
4530.88s:  a quick 38 second hiatus time starts now.
4560.88s:  Well, he's not he's not digging it. Here he is.
4591.68s:  Oh, wow. Here he is. The boss growing to this is your sole. I don't feel like I was that late.
4601.12s:  It felt like I was talking, but he just wasn't he wasn't showing up. But he's now ready. See,
4608.96s:  you got to get into the his is tuxedo on. He's very formal. He's known for his formalities.
4615.52s:  He's ready to look at rowing. Are you going to be rowing Thor? Is that going to be your little thing?
4622.48s:  You can be rowing Thor. That's fun. I think he's ready. Alright, let's get back to it.
4630.64s:  So now let's take a look at the next. Let's take a look at the next update.
4637.60s:  Jotato says Thor's thoughts. Why is he always talking to this stupid box? I feel like that's
4646.64s:  got to be it. Sometimes he gets like really over when I'm talking because whenever I'm talking,
4651.60s:  I typically talk kind of loud. I don't know why it's just like a natural tendency I've built. So
4658.56s:  sometimes he'll just dip. He should be like, yo, I'm getting the hell out of here.
4664.32s:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, all the way across the board.
4676.00s:  No changes at all. Okay. So this will be.
4685.76s:  When is this? 30 step.
4693.36s:  And now we continue. So TG is 989 027.33.
4703.04s:  Cash. I have to slide this over. I think you guys can still see the full thing.
4709.28s:  Cash is 250 02235. So he just gained some interest there. Values 1379
4719.44s:  022.35.
4729.36s:  MS up. Oh no, I didn't.
4738.72s:  Yeah. So this lines up perfectly.
4740.16s:  Let me make this a little easier.
4749.76s:  Formula.
4760.32s:  If this.
4767.92s:  It's not letting me type in my formula. I have to type in the.
4771.52s:  And I do that. It doesn't look like that's annoying.
4786.48s:  If this equals this.
4791.76s:  Then we do.
4792.40s:  Just do binary.
4822.40s:  So I'm just making it easier for us to eyeball stuff for one more looking at it later.
4831.60s:  So we can clearly identify when there's changes like here. Definitely a change.
4838.88s:  So in this case, where we can see money moved here and money so far hasn't moved otherwise.
4846.88s:  So now we go on. So now we go to eight oct.
4852.40s:  Eight oct.
4855.28s:  TG 1883927.
4862.24s:  Dot 33.
4864.08s:  Ash 250. So he's not doing much with this cash.
4867.92s:  25423.
4870.64s:  Value 227.
4873.76s:  4323.
4877.76s:  So no change. Same same.
4882.48s:  Same positions. Same prices.
4887.12s:  Yep. All good.
4891.60s:  Vladimir says remember he had two weeks between yellow updates posts. We see a snapshot of a particular
4897.04s:  point in time and not all of his transactions. Yeah, of course. That's the that's.
4901.76s:  I'm confused, man. Like that's that's the entire point of looking between these. It's not
4908.24s:  while we're doing this, we're not seeing any like complete evidence of every transaction that
4917.76s:  happened or to, you know, what extent. But what it does let us see very distinctly is exactly
4925.68s:  what you just highlighted, which are the changes in between them. And then we can make inferences.
4932.64s:  Vladimir says I was just need topic for minutes ago. Okay. Yeah, because.
4941.28s:  Um Vladimir off Putin says 168 to 139 and cost basis on his posted yellow option updates.
4952.72s:  You're confusing me. So when you're talking in here, when you say his cost basis,
4958.56s:  you're talking about price paid. And you're saying that there was a one moving from 162 to 139.
4967.12s:  Right. That again, that is captured. The reason why the cost basis changed is because a line item
4977.52s:  trade is now gone. Right. So if we have a long call that has a price paid that comes up
4986.08s:  expiration time for him to manage it, whatever it is, that is originally captured here.
4993.20s:  Then when he chooses to sell the long call, price paid will come down to account for that long
5002.32s:  call as a line item disappearing. That's exactly why you see it go from 162 to 139 is because
5009.44s:  a position went away. As that long call goes away, it moves into cash. So this changing, again,
5021.04s:  like the price paid here for the analysis that we're doing in this Excel sheet, it literally doesn't
5026.88s:  matter because it's going to be captured. The way it's going to be captured is because I'm tracking
5034.96s:  the difference between total gain cash and value that is all of the possible buckets for the money
5044.96s:  to be in at a given point in time, unless it is removed from the bucket. So in this case,
5053.12s:  I can tell you its money was removed from the bucket. And it's because of the variance between
5061.76s:  these. So it's exactly how I can track between yellow updates if there's changes to the position,
5069.68s:  or if there's changes to the cash. And again, I have no context as to for the cash side of things,
5078.24s:  why what changes, but I can validate if it changes. So again, that's literally the entire point
5087.76s:  of doing this is so that we can get a sense of how these things move. So now back at it,
5095.12s:  last one we have eight oct. Now we have 15. Oops, clicked wrong thing, my bad. 15 oct. So 1000.
5106.40s:  Jan, Jan, Jan, Jan, Jan, April. Jan, Jan, Jan, so no change. Same same. No change in any of the
5114.64s:  bases here. Oops, I want to move this over. We don't need the space.
5129.36s:  Yeah, so this is fine.
5132.40s:  Cedric says, so if something changed, we should see it between yellow updates. 100%. That is exactly
5137.60s:  why we're looking at this is because we will see it between the yellow updates. No matter what happens,
5143.60s:  whether he adds a position, whether he adjusts a current position, whether he takes cash in or out,
5149.68s:  I will see it because if he sells some of a position, and then let's say for an example,
5155.44s:  if he sells some of his position, but then buys some more of the same position, I'll still see it
5161.44s:  because the price chain, the price paid for that individual line item will show a variance.
5167.04s:  I will be able to detect it. Again, that's why doing this line by line is really informative,
5172.32s:  because we've already seen a few changes. So now the TG here is 1902,
5180.00s:  827.33. Then we have cash, 250, 299.5, so cash decreased slightly. I don't know why,
5192.40s:  but slightly, 2293, 099.5.
5202.72s:  So cash came down slightly, but the variance lines up.
5213.84s:  Interesting.
5222.64s:  So something happened here. I don't know what. I have to earmark this.
5233.12s:  So my best guess is again, I don't know why 12350 moved, but 12350 moved.
5245.20s:  Now, even though these line up telling me that there was no change to the position,
5252.40s:  like we did take something, because if this 123 moved, and it's not reflected in any of these
5261.28s:  other positions, because again, they would have moved. Something happened. I don't know what,
5266.48s:  but again, something happened. 15 oct, 22 oct.
5270.56s:  TG, Jesus, 235, 600, cash is 25301.60, value 2636, 901.6.
5300.56s:  And then
5312.24s:  10,000. These are all the same. Big change though.
5330.80s:  Interesting.
5346.64s:  Oh, because I, that's why I was wondering. I was like, I did the, I like couldn't figure out.
5351.12s:  This was completely wrong. But it was from here. I grabbed the day gain instead of total gain,
5357.44s:  because I'm an idiot. So 2246, 627, got 33.
5366.88s:  Perfect match. We're good.
5369.44s:  AT says total gain is all wrong and all caps as well deserved spot on.
5374.64s:  30 oct.
5382.64s:  Oh, got a backup. Okay, so 30 oct.
5388.40s:  TG, let's get it right this time is 932, 627.301.
5396.72s:  Cash, 253.303.
5400.80s:  0.52, that looks like, to me, that just looks like interest.
5407.28s:  Values 1322, 903, got 52.
5424.56s:  And I miss something up. What did I mess up?
5428.24s:  1322, 903.
5441.68s:  Oh, so this is just a rounding. Okay.
5445.60s:  So when I look at this here, I can see that this should be, you know, 131399810.
5452.96s:  This is, you know, 131399808. So this literally is just like a small rounding error.
5460.16s:  I'm not worried about that. That's just missing a decimal. So essentially, we need this to be
5467.52s:  like 90, 190 would be the delta here. So for cash, if I take off like two pennies, or I'm sorry,
5476.96s:  add two pennies, it'll line up. I'm not going to do that, but I'm just going to highlight this
5483.68s:  as a rounding discrepancy. That's all that is. And it's just because we don't see all the digits.
5492.56s:  So small, tiny, small rounding variants like that is to be expected. Five, no.
5498.24s:  No change in position again. So this is also really interesting. Like how much he holds these as they
5510.72s:  oscillate around. 1075, 527.31. Cash is 2, 5030352. Exact same. 1465,
5527.52s:  8352. Same, same. So here's one of the interesting things I find. So this position is now up
5544.88s:  $314,000. Let's keep an eyeball on that really fast. So last price was 340. That's on 5, no.
5555.52s:  251. Like this, that's not normal. That is not normal. The fact that this position was showing over
5567.36s:  half a million dollar gain. And then we don't rest a stop order. It's absolutely insane.
5576.32s:  It's absolutely insane. It's incredible. But that's not normal. Because think of it this way,
5585.20s:  he's holding something here that the gain represents again, $600,000 gain, $600,000 gain.
5594.24s:  And he lets it go from $600,000 down to $250 back up to 314. So what this again tells me is that he's
5604.80s:  not using things like stops. And it seems like what I'm seeing so far is him basing his options
5613.12s:  exits, not based on some sort of profit target for the option, but based on time. That's what it looks
5621.44s:  like to me. Because if you had some sort of profit target for your option, you would follow
5627.84s:  the value of the option and capture it when it's at its zenith because options decay.
5635.36s:  Vladimir says maybe he likes to stock and doesn't sweat the value. I don't disagree with you,
5641.04s:  but what I'm identifying here, though, is a methodology for using options. Because the problem
5647.76s:  with options is that they do decay. So when I look at a 10 call, even though these are slightly
5656.32s:  in the money, they still will decay. That's the tricky part when you trade options.
5663.60s:  Is it's not just a function of if you like something, it goes up. Like that's part of it.
5669.44s:  But even if you're correct, these will decay. So we literally can take a quick look at it together,
5676.32s:  just out of curiosity. That's what we're here for. So let's fast forward time here.
5681.44s:  And let's go to five know of 2020.
5689.92s:  And at this point,
5694.16s:  GameStop should have been trading.
5699.84s:  Yep. So it's showing right about where he saw it. Last price on his was 1145. This has like
5705.52s:  1138. That's good. So now let's look at this Jan, which is now 70 days out.
5712.16s:  And then let's take a look at the 10. Right. So if you take a look,
5717.20s:  right now it's a dollar 38 in Shrenzig value. And again, quick options 101 to figure out in Shrenzig
5724.56s:  value for a call, we just take the last price and the strike price out of it. So in this case,
5730.64s:  last price is 1138. You take the 10 strike out. So it gives us a dollar 38.
5737.20s:  That tells me my in Shrenzig value out of this. So the mid price here, we can use whatever he was
5743.60s:  quoted at. So he was quoted at 340. So we need 340 minus 138, 340 minus 138. And he has a thousand of
5756.32s:  these. And then their option. So there's another hundred. So right now in time value,
5765.12s:  he has $202,000. Even though this stock is doing exactly what he wants and it's going up. And
5775.76s:  he's losing. He has the total value at risk for time value is over $200,000. So whether or not we
5784.80s:  like GameStop to the upside or whatever the case is, that's part of the equation. Obviously,
5790.00s:  but you're still holding a decaying tool options decay rather quickly. So even though his are like
5798.00s:  right at the money, they're actually going to be close to the height of their theta decay curve.
5804.08s:  So now what I'm very carefully honing in on is when does he start managing these 15 Jan
5811.12s:  options? Because again, I can tell you based on price movement so far, it's not predicated on a
5818.40s:  price target. Clearly, he's just trading it to the upside. So then it leads me to believe that
5824.08s:  he's trading it based on time, which is fascinating. So we did five know. Let's go to 12 know.
5833.76s:  12 know. Total gain 957 827 dot 31.
5846.96s:  Cash. Willie says to generate on the surface level, but solid options trade around the inside.
5854.48s:  I mean, I really don't know. I really don't know if I would say that personally. Like,
5860.80s:  based on what I'm seeing here, this isn't bad, but it's really not good. So it's it's hard to say.
5867.60s:  It's really, really hard to say because what I can tell you is that his most recent options trades
5872.88s:  have a very different field than what I'm seeing here. It's actually remarkable to see the difference
5878.80s:  because in this example, if his thesis for whatever reason didn't play out, this is like, again,
5885.92s:  it's as he says, it's a true yolo. If his thesis wasn't fortunate enough to play out,
5892.72s:  what you get in part is luck. Part of it is absolutely good luck. Now, it's obviously a ton of
5899.28s:  research and it's doing the homework and it's having a good ideas. I'm not discounting his effort,
5904.40s:  but you still need luck for it to do what you want in your time frame and the stuff that he's trading
5911.52s:  absolutely require a massively healthy dose of luck is what it is. So that gives us a 12-no. Let's get
5919.52s:  to 19-nove. See, no change here. Hey, Mel, while you're here, actually, could you grab me another
5930.56s:  one of these? Mel was stopping by because I talked to you, but I told you guys that already.
5941.52s:  I already forgot the date that we're looking at, which is 19-nove.
5946.56s:  Damn it. 19-nove. 19-nove. Okay, TG is 1184127.31.
5959.44s:  Ash 250579.6.No change. And then
5976.64s:  we got, we had to get a mango reload. It's like absolutely critical to the operation.
5988.72s:  I was drinking the mango orange seltzer water, which is good, but it's not ideal. Okay, value.
5994.16s:  1574679.6. No change. We're good.
6007.52s:  Well, Rointitdy says he's also doing this because of the buybacks RC buying in, console, all those
6012.08s:  things. Yeah, I think you're absolutely cracked. And again, we can validate the thesis, right? It's
6016.64s:  actually really, really easy for us to see what his thoughts were. We can straight up take a
6021.60s:  look at these same time frames. That's kind of the nice part about being able to line these up.
6025.84s:  So for the group, is there a specific time frame in here that we're most interested in seeing
6031.36s:  what his thoughts were at that time? Because if so, we'll just jump into one of those videos really
6037.36s:  fast. And then we can see what he was thinking. Rhinow says he was a financial and economic genius.
6046.08s:  He knew in his heart of hearts that GME was going to go up a bit. I don't think he saw 480 coming.
6050.80s:  Yeah, I mean, and again, like, it's really important to always remind ourselves that genius and
6057.60s:  crazy are essentially the same thing. And the what differentiates them is the outcome, right? Because
6064.96s:  if for whatever reason, GameStop went down another path like so many other stocks and this didn't
6070.88s:  happen, then it would be a complete different story. We wouldn't be spending any time looking at
6076.64s:  this because he would have been yet another blown up trader. But what we're what we have to be
6081.84s:  really, really careful when we evaluate stuff like this is again, it's survivorship bias.
6088.72s:  We're seeing somebody that was able to very, very, very effectively apply an incredible skill set.
6097.04s:  And again, lining up with a healthy dose of good fortune and luck with the performance of things.
6104.32s:  And it led to obviously the outcome that we saw. But it's 100% survivorship bias because for
6113.44s:  everyone, it's literally like winning the lottery. For everyone, Rorin Kitty, who happened to
6120.08s:  identify this stock that he was interested in, do the homework and then go in and size up massively,
6126.64s:  like all of those things together lead to an incredible, an incredible lining up of events.
6134.96s:  Cedric says, now this is not that outlier. If you looked at fair value of the company before and
6139.20s:  after his options, you would understand the business double their so unfair fair value. Yeah,
6143.52s:  no, no, I agree with you. I'm saying the research is good. What again, I think you guys, at least in
6149.12s:  this context, I think it's really important to understand the broader effect. So for example,
6158.96s:  GameStop, it could have done what Wells Fargo's, what Wells Fargo did. As GameStop was pivoting as
6166.48s:  they were growing in value, they could have been involved in some sort of scandal. Easy, they could
6172.64s:  have Wells Fargo did. They could have done an SBB style thing, not manage their risk appropriately.
6179.12s:  They could have had a terrible investment into a brand new venture that didn't make sense.
6183.92s:  So again, the value that he perceived is there and it makes sense. But there is a massive
6190.64s:  amount of good fortune that goes into something moving along as it happens to move along.
6197.68s:  And that's just from a very, very specific circumstance talking about the individual stock.
6204.64s:  This doesn't talk about our broader economic condition and the fact that we happened to not go
6211.44s:  into some sort of broad economic recession. There happened not to have been World War III during
6218.32s:  this that led to the stock market in and of itself collapsing or even imploding. So that happened to
6225.84s:  not happen when a global pandemic launched and started leaving to essentially countries closing
6233.44s:  down for prolonged periods of time. All I'm highlighting is that it was excellent research.
6241.84s:  In excellent thesis, it was traded excellently. Despite all of those pieces of excellence,
6252.24s:  there is still luck. There will always be luck to a degree. Now, as you increase your skill set,
6261.68s:  you'll find that fortune seems to smile upon you more frequently. But there still is luck.
6269.60s:  And it's important to know that there's luck.
6272.24s:  So, yeah, anyways, it's so I think somebody said like a specific time frame.
6280.48s:  Steven Sealgall, that's what a great name. Steven Sealgall says October 2020, I think,
6286.72s:  when Burry sold his position, yeah, let's go there.
6293.04s:  2020 is what four years ago.
6295.28s:  Four years ago.
6303.04s:  Here? This is when he entered. Wait, Steven Sealgall, do we mean here where he entered for
6316.56s:  for Cohen or oh, no, you said Burry, my bad.
6320.32s:  Burry, Burry, Burry, Burry. Here?
6325.76s:  Is this where Burry sold you guys think?
6333.92s:  Cedric says, but if you take a trade with 30% chance of hitting over 60% by D.D., I don't call it luck.
6340.64s:  No, it's called expected return. But the problem that you're mistaken, Cedric, with your analysis,
6348.16s:  which is exactly what Robo is highlighting, is the problem with having a possibility of a 100% loss
6360.24s:  on a 30%, 60% thing is still negatively expectant long term. So it still is luck, it's complete luck
6367.68s:  in that instance. Again, like this is the confusion. When we're trading or investing,
6372.96s:  we're trying to create a higher probabilistic outcome. But when you tie that with total concentration
6380.16s:  of entire net worth or at least investible capital, you are one bad hand away from being
6388.64s:  eviscerated. So again, for the person that's at the poker table, Robo, the equivalent is to get
6395.44s:  your hand and then go all in when you find a decent hand after seeing your first two cards.
6402.16s:  So it's just completely, completely different. And that's why at least me, I take a very probabilistic
6410.00s:  approach to trading, but it's why I've never seen the returns that he has is because I think about
6416.40s:  it in the context of path of returns. So yeah, it's a fascinating scenario and that's really
6423.92s:  where the luck in this scenario came in because I agree with you. His due diligence was fantastic
6428.80s:  and he was very convicted. And I can tell that he absolutely does a ton of homework. It's a great
6435.20s:  thesis, but it's still just one randomness thing away from happened to have not worked for whatever
6442.48s:  reason. Unfortunately, thankfully it didn't happen. But I mean, like if we look at his portfolio,
6447.60s:  literally all of his money is in this one thing. It's crazy. And it's what makes it so special
6456.24s:  in my opinion is because of this. Okay, so just a double check, is there a specific time frame in
6466.00s:  here with his movements that we wanted to validate? Because in here, there's been no change
6473.60s:  essentially from back here. So then we can continue down this, I think, until we find a change
6481.76s:  that we want to investigate what his thoughts were about it. Unless again, if there's one of the
6488.56s:  things in here that we want to investigate, because that's why I would watch the video or at least
6491.84s:  comb through it, is to see if there's any inclination or any hint as to what his thoughts were.
6505.44s:  Ryan O'Sus, he had over 50 stocks in his portfolio until that. It's the Warren Buffett idea,
6509.44s:  not swinging at bad pitches until the white one presents itself to Keith. This was the right pitch.
6513.68s:  Yeah, definitely. You could tell. And it was something that he was purely convicted in. It was a
6518.24s:  100% convicted yellow. It's the only reason why you would concentrate to this degree. So yeah,
6526.80s:  completely agree there. 19, no, all right, 25, no, one, two, three, four. Okay. So this does look like we
6534.88s:  see change. And it looks like we see change in his options position. Because the variance here now
6549.36s:  is one of these options is gone. The 17s are gone. So here, this is 25, no,
6560.48s:  damn it. I keep clicking the wrong thing. That's fascinating. Why the 17s? Why the 17s?
6567.04s:  We're going to have to figure that out next. Man, this is so. 1666, 041, 23,
6575.60s:  3,
6577.60s:  Ash 510,
6579.60s:  593,
6581.60s:  54,
6583.60s:  total 2, 3,
6585.60s:  01093,
6587.60s:  go up 5, 4. Okay.
6591.60s:  So money also moved again.
6595.12s:  Fascinating.
6596.40s:  So one of the things
6604.08s:  one of the things that I can see is that he's he missed an options trade.
6611.60s:  Meaning he he moves something. A lot of me says his cost basis dropped about 15k. Yeah,
6616.32s:  it's because he lost his options play. We can see that clear as day, right? So down here in his
6622.48s:  last position, he still had 15, Jan 21, 17s. He still had those, but he got rid of them.
6629.36s:  It's 25, no.
6635.12s:  I'm this is fascinating. This is absolutely fascinating. Because I think we're starting to see
6644.56s:  how he unwinds his trades, which again, it looks like it's based on time. So exited,
6652.48s:  15, Jan 21, 17 calls.
6661.36s:  So now I want to see what he does with the remainder of these. My guess is he's going to start
6666.00s:  moving them. Now what I don't understand is why the 17s. Because 10s make sense,
6675.84s:  they're in the money. 15s make sense. They're at the money. 20s, I don't understand
6682.24s:  why the 20s are the 17s, like how he picked between those. So let's see, the total gain here
6690.88s:  was 185, 223. Let's go back. Total gain here, 130.
6701.04s:  Don't understand that choice. So he exited the 15, Jan 17 calls, and then I'm going to put, he
6715.44s:  kept the 20s, he kept the 10s, or the 15s, and the 10s.
6731.52s:  Very, very interesting. No change to shares. Very cool.
6739.84s:  So cash went up by 260K. I'm assuming that's the proceeds from the 17s.
6754.00s:  I can't peg. I can't peg what happened. Why the 17s are not the 20s.
6764.16s:  The cost basis on the 17s was 15 cents.
6776.08s:  Man, that's really interesting.
6782.16s:  Okay, so now my guess is that we're going to see more changes. That would be my natural inference.
6787.28s:  So this is, what's the DTE here? 25 know 15, Jan, so let's do 15, Jan, 25, 15, Jan,
6802.48s:  what yours is 2020, 15, Jan, 2020, the 25, no, not 25, no, 2020, and this equals.
6815.12s:  I think it's not copy in the format here. What the hell, you made these damn dates.
6839.84s:  15, Jan, 2020, 25, no, 20, 20 equals this minus, oh, I'm in 80x, it's 21, got. 51 days.
6858.80s:  This is 51 DTE. Okay.
6869.44s:  So we can also see that money came out.
6875.68s:  Because this should have been 741 and it's 726.
6880.88s:  Rapture says could it be closer, he did. Yeah, that's exactly what he did.
6886.72s:  So that's why you see the cash delta elevate here.
6892.64s:  Yep. So here, it's very clear that he took those 17s down. Why he took the 17s down? I really don't know.
6902.56s:  But we'll get a little more clarity as we go.
6905.84s:  30, no.
6916.40s:  Exactly, exactly as anticipated, exactly as anticipated. This makes sense. So the total gain here
6926.48s:  was 195, 55, 65, 7.63.
6934.24s:  This makes so much sense now, at least in terms of identifying a behavior, 11, 00, 611.49.
6944.08s:  And then the value is 316, 6211.49. So we had an expansion,
6956.88s:  of 590 in cash. We had an expansion of 865K total in value. What I can see here is,
6976.88s:  he still has the tens and the 20s. So now I understand what he's doing. He's taking down the
6983.12s:  options that are closer to the money. So here, he took the 15, Jan 21, and he took the 15 calls down.
6995.84s:  And he kept the tens, which are in the money, which will move more dollar for dollar,
7003.20s:  and he kept the 20s, which will compound.
7009.60s:  And again, the date here, expiration is 15, Jan 21, and then 30, no, 20.
7023.52s:  Okay.
7025.44s:  equals this minus this 46 days 46, DTE now 46 DTE fascinating. Love this.
7038.56s:  Okay, let's know now we're at des, eight, ease, eight, ease.
7046.32s:  10s, 20s, 12s, no change in anything else. Okay. So he's just holding here. So total gain
7057.32s:  17, 9, 3, 4, 5, 7, got 6, 3, ash, 11, 02, 8, 38, got 3, 8, value of 3, 0, 0, 6, 2, 3, 8,
7077.64s:  got 3, 8. Okay. So no change. He still has still holding Jan 15, Jan 21. He's still holding
7102.96s:  the 10s, 20s. And this is now 80s, 80s, 20. This is now 38 DTE. So he started exiting his
7121.72s:  two others at 51 and 46. And then here he's holding the same expiration 15 Jan 21, 38 DTE. Okay.
7136.48s:  The ninth, 90s, GG is 10, 39157, 63, ash, 11, 02, 8, 38, got 3, 8, value, 2251,
7165.44s:  91, 93, 8, got 3, 8. 251, 93, 1, 02, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
7186.48s:  all the same options. No change. That's a hold across the board. Same, same story here.
7204.88s:  So he's still holding those. Now it's 37 DTE. Same, same.
7221.16s:  Rowing Titi says maybe he's paying for additional assurances, his account is over 250k. I doubt
7224.84s:  he would do that. I mean, most of us that have, I don't do that. And I have definitely
7230.04s:  quite a bit more than that. Yeah, I don't think he would be doing that either. It's
7236.88s:  just so inefficient. FDIC is really like disaster protection at the point where if there's
7244.48s:  like some sort of large bank failure, if you feel the need to do that, what you would
7249.04s:  do much more efficiently is just split your capital out, move it into multiple banks.
7254.76s:  But most of us don't try to hedge like as soon as you're over 250, it would be unreasonable.
7265.72s:  Vladimir says anyone can open a Roth or IRA as long as you have earned income. Well,
7276.08s:  I'm pretty sure you can still open an IRA account.
7278.84s:  Yeah, I think Rapture says I used to work at a bank. You can walk in and open a
7308.70s:  Roth or traditional. Yeah, I think it's whether or not you can open it is one thing, which
7314.54s:  again, I'm pretty sure you can. It's what tax advantages are provided to you. Right?
7322.46s:  So you can still open an IRA if you're so inclined or a Roth IRA and you can put money
7329.62s:  into it. But if you don't have earned income, then you won't be able to deduct it, right?
7335.62s:  Because you don't have earned income to deduct, but it doesn't mean you can't open it.
7339.54s:  It's like the same thing with like when you're priced out of a Roth IRA, I've been priced out
7344.34s:  of a Roth IRA forever now, but you can still contribute to a Roth IRA in a few different ways.
7350.42s:  One of the ways you could do it is through a backdoor contribution, which is it sounds real sketchy,
7354.74s:  but it's not. It's a really well known pattern. And there's just certain documents you have to file,
7360.82s:  informs to file, but it's accepted. It's nothing nefarious. And then the other thing is,
7367.30s:  like you can still contribute to a Roth if you're so inclined, but you just don't get any tax
7372.50s:  benefit from doing so. So once you once you max it out, you can definitely go beyond the standard
7378.90s:  max and you can also add more to it beyond that. You're just not getting any sort of tax benefit
7384.74s:  at that point. Vladimir says you can't deduct for contributions to a Roth that's after tax.
7391.30s:  Yeah, sorry. I was talking about IRAs in general, but yeah, obviously the difference between
7397.38s:  like a standard or traditional IRA and Roth is the tax treatment, traditional being you'll be taxed,
7404.66s:  you'll essentially have your income tax deferred and then your tax on the back end Roth,
7412.02s:  it's the inverse. You get taxed up front and then it's taxed deferred on the back end,
7416.74s:  which is why people get priced out of Roth super fast, which is super, super annoying because
7424.74s:  Roth is more appealing to most of us for a lot of different reasons, but they make it really annoying
7432.42s:  to maintain exposure to them. So yeah, I don't think going back to the original though with what
7441.70s:  we're looking at here, I don't think that he's like paying for insurance or anything on these
7448.34s:  or on his portfolio yet. All right, so we're caught up here. Let's go to the next.
7456.98s:  17 D's. The other thing I notice is that you can tell that he likes the attention and that's
7463.94s:  not digging out them, but that's why he's posting so frequently and you can tell that's why he starts
7469.14s:  to slow down, which is actually really, really fun. I like that he enjoys, you know, like the
7474.82s:  game is playing and being part of the community and stuff. He's not shying away from the attention
7480.02s:  he gets from doing this, which is super cool. 1102. 857.63. Ash 1105.069.48.
7496.18s:  This looks like it matches up. I'm guessing this is a rounding error.
7515.46s:  Oh no, it's not. Wait. Why doesn't this match? Looks completely correct.
7535.30s:  I'm super confused.
7536.42s:  659.3110. That's the same. It's literally the exact same. I even added a bunch of decimal points.
7550.50s:  I don't, I have no idea what the difference is between these. These look completely fine.
7557.86s:  I'm just going to label as a rounding discrepancy.
7561.46s:  He's still holding all of his options and now we are at 14D's 2032 DTE. So the reason I'm
7574.50s:  tracking the DTE is now is I want to see when does he choose to start managing this a little
7583.46s:  bit differently. Also, I need to turn my air back on my office. It normally turns off at like seven.
7599.86s:  But since I'm in here with the door closed, it'll be spicy. Okay. So now we have 22D's.
7607.54s:  No change in positions. This is fascinating. So now the main thing I'm curious about is when does he choose?
7622.02s:  When does he choose to take these positions down? So I don't think he's going to wait till the last
7628.66s:  second. Cash is 116, 7, 9, 6, got 64. Value is 34.05, 396, got 64. I messed something up. What did I mess up?
7652.34s:  Hmm. The cash. It missed a one. Easy to do. Really easy to do when you're playing with this many numbers.
7665.62s:  So here, and he's still holding. And now it's 22D's.
7673.54s:  22D's 20. So it's 24 DTE. This is like getting this is getting close to one I would expect these to be managed. Now for the tens,
7687.30s:  they're going to be so far in the money that he probably doesn't care about the extrinsic value. We can take a look at those.
7695.14s:  So today is 22D's. Here. And the tens are going to be so buried that the amount of extrinsic value that's
7707.38s:  decaying on those will be probably insignificant. But on the 20s, it's going to be actually very significant.
7715.78s:  So I'm really curious to see what those values are.
7727.70s:  Okay. So the tens, yeah, they have like no no value left. So let's just call it 19 minus 10 gives us 9. And these are at
7741.38s:  892 minus. Yeah. So these essentially are like a one delta. Yeah. There's like no time value left in
7751.70s:  these at all. So that's why it doesn't care about those. But the 20s are all time value. And they're at the peak
7760.42s:  of their Theta decay curve. This is when Theta decay is actually really, really, really, really pronounced.
7766.74s:  So you can see on these 20s, he's losing five cents a day. So if you take $5 times his 1000
7777.94s:  contracts that he has, he's literally losing five grand a day by holding these. And it's because we are in
7785.62s:  the most pronounced phase of this.
7789.78s:  Stories of Opacity says the backwards account dropped another meme. I think it's RK and it's
7798.58s:  his all personality account is Tiffy. That's funny. I've seen a lot of back and forth on that. I
7803.86s:  don't personally believe that yet. But I would defer to you guys mostly to be honest. You guys probably
7809.62s:  would know better than me. Yeah. Let's finish through December. And then we'll probably take a pause.
7818.82s:  So this is 25 days because I just want to go through some of the recent price action before we wrap
7824.18s:  up. And I'm actually going to call it here. Let's just call it at 22 days. We'll leave it at that.
7836.10s:  And I'm going to add a note that that's where we left off.
7840.18s:  I'll do RK raids. We'll keep an eyeball on it. So I want to talk about some of the other stuff
7853.62s:  because there was a few questions that I got that I don't want to not have a chance to get through.
7859.54s:  And obviously his old trades are going to be there.
7861.70s:  And all right. So one of the things that we talked about way in the beginning, it was I think one
7870.42s:  of the first questions somebody dropped in here was about these 5,000 block that we continue to see
7878.98s:  in GameStop, flown through the dark pool. So if you go to GME. And if we limit this by 5,000
7886.82s:  and we limit this by 5,000, I didn't need the tin foil literally this entire session.
7892.42s:  That's kind of crazy. I was expecting to get into way more tin foil stuff. Maybe that's what we'll do
7897.70s:  when we get to the to the meme thing. Maybe that will be where we need the tin foil for.
7902.98s:  So we've honestly this has all been like standard data analysis, which I love doing. But it's like
7909.06s:  part of these sessions is supposed to be getting really weird. Okay. So let's take a look.
7916.74s:  913.
7923.30s:  There's let's count how many are on this.
7929.38s:  Rhino says that 5K is most likely institutions and a dark pool to not affect the tape that's not
7934.34s:  A.K. legal shit. It's not true. So Rhino, I think it's really, really, really important to again,
7942.90s:  understand the way that the markets behave. One, dark pools are not illegal.
7947.94s:  Two, more importantly, dark pool prints still hit the consolidated tape. They're just delayed
7956.42s:  typically by a few seconds. Maybe a few minutes. That's an extreme scenario, typically not the case.
7962.74s:  Dark pool trades still hit the consolidated tape. They still hit volume that goes through the day.
7969.94s:  They still hit stock price that goes through the day. The things that do not hit the consolidated
7976.26s:  tape impacting volume stock price are internalized orders or an internalized order. You won't see them.
7985.38s:  So those are the kinds of orders that we will not see an impact because we have no idea.
7991.38s:  Cedric says even our K can use a dark pool. Absolutely. We can all access the dark pool. The other
7995.94s:  thing is it's up to the broker on the way that they choose to route your order or the market maker.
8001.94s:  So if I'm buying shares of GameStop and it happens to go through a market maker who happens
8006.10s:  Decide to route my personal order through the dark pool. That's where it'll go. So dark pools are
8012.42s:  accessible. So anyways, one of the questions that we had is like, let's go back into May.
8025.06s:  Kind of like this pre-squeeze time frame.
8033.54s:  And see what kind of 5,000 blocks we saw if we saw 5,000 blocks.
8038.98s:  I haven't done this yet. So I have no idea what this is going to show us.
8048.82s:  C Gillian says do you think it's been DFV buying the 5,000 blocks in the dark pool this week
8053.54s:  there are over 100. There's a lot of them actually.
8058.98s:  And I covered a couple of them actually in the last few daily video updates that I did.
8065.38s:  But the fact the matter is I don't know.
8073.14s:  So yeah, I think I, man, so this is like just not loading.
8085.62s:  Maybe I'll try like a smaller time frame. Maybe we'll just do like May like a week or two.
8091.62s:  And let's get rid of these because it looks like there's none. Yeah, okay. So there's none.
8096.82s:  One, when did the squeeze start in May?
8102.50s:  Doctors A says does anyone remember the origin of how 5,000 blocks? It's just from when he
8107.94s:  was buying options, which is that that's another funny thing that I see is that people assimilate
8114.50s:  like 5,000 blocks shares. But he was buying 5,000 blocks of options, which is completely different.
8122.82s:  And the reason why options matters because 5,000 lots in the options world is a big trade.
8130.34s:  I in the share world it's small. It's insignificant. But in the options world, those kinds of
8136.82s:  positions are larger. So the reason why he was used, and it wasn't just 5,000 blocks that he was
8143.06s:  using by the way, it's definitely more than that. He just happened to settle on that number to
8147.38s:  start scaling into his position for a few of them. But he had other sizes too.
8153.06s:  So anyways, as we go through here, let's do cap it at 5,000.
8163.54s:  So there's no, well, that doesn't make sense. Because I saw,
8171.78s:  yes, all like a 50, okay, so maybe we'll cap it at like 5,500.
8175.86s:  Okay, so we can see that there's a handful here. So let's do the rest of May like this.
8187.14s:  And then let's limit this by 5,000 now and see if we can, there we go.
8193.54s:  And then let's change this to 5,000. There we go.
8198.50s:  So in the 31st of May, there is a bunch of these blocks.
8205.94s:  Ryanos says 512 is when he came back cool. So then we'll just do, we'll do like,
8212.58s:  here to here.
8218.10s:  17th, I'm going to zoom this in then because it's going to be
8223.30s:  too much I think. Zero. So leading into his return,
8230.82s:  from all of May, there was nothing at 5,000 blocks.
8239.46s:  So then let's go back and look at April really quick. Nothing at 5,000.
8253.70s:  So yeah, doesn't look like, doesn't look like there's anything tying that,
8259.14s:  which is also really, really interesting actually. Because here's the other thing that I find very
8266.82s:  curious. And again, maybe we can get the tinfoil hacks. It's probably coming up on time.
8275.06s:  The roaring kitty.
8280.58s:  So if we take a look at this,
8282.34s:  in updated 13G, if he got out of Chui at, well, let's just call it 6ep because he's running
8293.70s:  at a time. If he got out of Chui at or before this date, he owes an update in 13G within 10 days.
8307.70s:  Or the whatever point in time that he drops below 5% ownership.
8318.90s:  So here's the other problem with this is when we look at this, we could say he is doing this
8327.30s:  preemptively and to indicate that he might be putting down Chui or not, we don't know.
8331.94s:  But it's the point where his ownership drops below 5%.
8342.58s:  So he could have opted to start unwinding his position earlier.
8350.02s:  And then he could have eventually crossed that threshold or not crossed that threshold.
8356.74s:  So HockeyNuts says, is it 10 days or 10 trading days? That's a great clarifying question.
8362.42s:  Let's double check. For amended 13G SEC filings, is it calendar or trading days?
8375.22s:  Calender Days
8396.74s:  Interesting,
8398.74s:  So this says for amended 13G SEC filings, the deadlines are based on calendar days.
8412.80s:  In amended 13G must be filed within 45 calendar days at the end of the calendar year if there
8420.78s:  is changes in the information previously reported. If the amendment reflects a change in ownership,
8428.70s:  exceeding 10% or more, it must be filed within 10 calendar days after the end of the month in which the
8438.22s:  change occurred. Very interesting. So this looks like there's a
8450.22s:  fucking giant window here. 45 calendar days after the end of the calendar year. So this means essentially
8462.78s:  he has until the end of 2024 and then 45 calendar days into 2025 to file the amended 13G. That's what that
8475.06s:  means. And then I'm going to go to the SEC and check it directly there. Actually, I'm going to ask chat GPT for a source so that we can look at it for ourselves.
8485.02s:  Because I've learned not to trust chat GPT much at all.
8505.06s:  I want to see the site. Yeah, so beneficial ownership exceeding 10% filings must be made within five business days.
8517.26s:  So this is different than what it says up above. This is the problem with chat GPT. I need to go to SEC 13G filing rules.
8529.42s:  We just need to go. Great to the source will grab this one because they'll probably make it easier to read.
8537.46s:  And then we'll probably look at this one, which is going to be terrible to read, but it will be fine.
8544.42s:  Those are literally two different. I want to like chat GPT so much, but I just don't trust it. I guess the other thing I.
8551.26s:  What is this?
8556.78s:  The shareholder owns over 5% corporations form 10 registering.
8564.94s:  12 month period from the acquisition of the time was privately held.
8570.70s:  Shareholder acquired access of 10% of a class of equity securities prior to the registration.
8577.54s:  Any share holders so exempt from filing 13D 13G within 45 days after the end of the calendar year, which in exchange act registrant.
8588.02s:  So I got a double check is Keith.
8593.02s:  Keith.
8595.02s:  Gil.
8597.66s:  13.
8600.14s:  Was it a 13G? Some pretty sure is a 13G. It is a 13.
8606.46s:  We can see 13G.
8609.74s:  We can also confirm that he's not a cat.
8613.90s:  And it's based on rule 13 D1 C.
8618.38s:  So I'm actually going to.
8632.38s:  Let me see.
8634.38s:  This is rule 13D1C.
8646.38s:  13D.
8650.38s:  13D1A.
8654.38s:  13D1C.
8658.38s:  A bank converted to a holding company structure.
8662.38s:  A 5% shareholder who had been filing.
8668.38s:  The equivalent of a schedule 13G with the comptroller.
8674.38s:  Currency.
8676.38s:  Received 5% of the holding company's stock in a one for one exchange.
8682.38s:  But after the stock had been registered.
8686.38s:  What the fuck?
8690.38s:  This doesn't feel like the right thing.
8698.38s:  This doesn't feel like the right.
8702.38s:  So let's see.
8706.38s:  What is SEC rule 13D-1C?
8714.38s:  Or a schedule 13G filing?
8720.38s:  Let's see what this is.
8724.38s:  Okay.
8728.38s:  So 13D1C governs section 13 filings for passive investors.
8734.38s:  The differentiation.
8738.38s:  Passive investors entity or individual that owns more than 5% of company's stock.
8742.38s:  Does not seek to influence or control the company.
8744.38s:  I think we knew that.
8746.38s:  These investors typically hold securities for investment purposes only.
8748.38s:  I think we know that.
8750.38s:  So initial filing.
8752.38s:  A passive investor must file schedule 13G within 10 calendar days after acquiring more than 5% of the company's stock.
8760.38s:  I think we know that.
8762.38s:  If the investor's ownership exceeds 10% or there is a material change.
8772.38s:  Ownership increasing or decreasing by more than 5%.
8778.38s:  That's an important note.
8780.38s:  The investor must file in amended 13G within two business days.
8788.38s:  That's interesting.
8798.38s:  Let's do the required only for these.
8806.38s:  And let's get rid of this one which looks like what I don't want to look at.
8810.38s:  So this is.
8813.38s:  Really interesting because one of the things I'm highlighting from here is ownership increasing or decreasing by more than 5%.
8821.38s:  So if that is the case.
8825.38s:  If he has a 6% stake.
8827.38s:  He can sell 4% in.
8829.38s:  Oh, nothing.
8831.38s:  So knowing him at least is loosely as I do.
8835.38s:  It would not surprise me in the least.
8839.38s:  If he posted this with everybody thinking that he's going to drop Choui entirely.
8845.38s:  And there might be nothing about it because he might not move by 5%.
8851.38s:  He doesn't have to.
8853.38s:  He can unlock the majority of his capital by unwinding 4.5%.
8859.38s:  Potentially.
8861.38s:  If he does any, which is kind of funny.
8869.38s:  Interesting.
8875.38s:  Record investor in investor with control intent file schedule 13D 13G for passive.
8887.38s:  One is this from.
8891.38s:  This doesn't tell me.
8895.38s:  So this says 13G.
8899.38s:  The amendments shorten the initial filing deadline from 45 after the.
8905.38s:  So that's why we're seeing that 45 after the calendar year.
8909.38s:  So that's just old information.
8911.38s:  This is why I like GameStop so much is because I'm learning random filing regulations that I otherwise would never be aware of.
8921.38s:  I would never have a reason to look at this shit.
8923.38s:  So this is hilarious.
8927.38s:  Okay.
8929.38s:  So it says it shorten the initial filing 10 to 5.
8933.38s:  And this one says it shortens from 45 days after the end of the calendar year to 45 days.
8941.38s:  At the end of the calendar quarter.
8945.38s:  Uh-huh.
8947.38s:  So in other schedule 13G filers passive investors.
8951.38s:  The amendments shorten the initial filing deadline.
8955.38s:  From 10 days to 5 business days.
8961.38s:  Business days.
8963.38s:  In addition for all schedule 13G filers, the amendments generally require that in amendment to be filed 45 days.
8969.38s:  After the calendar quarter, which a material change occurred rather than 45 days of the calendar year.
8975.38s:  Interesting.
8977.38s:  Amendments accelerate 13G.
8979.38s:  Okay.
8981.38s:  Interesting.
8987.38s:  So then this their election matters.
8993.38s:  So if they're a G that's 13d1c.
9001.38s:  All 13g's be amended within 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter.
9007.38s:  In which any material change occurred under the current rules except certain situations they have 45 days at the calendar year.
9017.38s:  So this one is this from 9 step 24.
9021.38s:  So this seems like really, really.
9025.38s:  That this is about as recent as it gets.
9029.38s:  And this looks like, oh, wow.
9031.38s:  So this is actually going to start soon.
9033.38s:  30 step 24.
9035.38s:  So there's even a bigger change here.
9039.38s:  Really, really interesting.
9043.38s:  So that's going to accelerate it even more.
9047.38s:  So we can see what it's going from and to.
9051.38s:  Yeah, this will catch him then if there's a change.
9057.38s:  Fascinating.
9060.38s:  Pam says I don't think rk likes RC so much.
9065.38s:  Oh, interesting. I wonder why.
9069.38s:  Yeah, I don't know.
9071.38s:  I haven't really spent a whole lot of time thinking about like the perception of that relationship and stuff.
9077.38s:  But I don't.
9080.38s:  I don't see why, especially like if he stays associated with GameStop.
9088.38s:  If you think about it, like GameStop right now is essentially Cohen.
9095.38s:  Right. That's that's where all the values coming from.
9098.38s:  And it looks like based on his previous work, it seems like he really liked Cohen.
9103.38s:  Right. Like he talks about him actually quite a lot.
9107.38s:  So I don't.
9109.38s:  I don't see him not liking Cohen.
9112.38s:  I think one of the problems is at least what I can tell from the ape community is it seems like the apes believe that Cohen should prioritize a squeeze.
9125.38s:  And I don't think that that's what Cohen is or should prioritize.
9132.38s:  I know that that might upset some of the apes, but that like that is what it is a squeeze does not benefit the company to a significant degree.
9141.38s:  Now it can help.
9142.38s:  I'm not saying it's detrimental.
9144.38s:  But what I'm saying is the focus for a company and a CEO of a company should be literally.
9154.38s:  Hold on, I'm getting hit up. They're confused.
9161.38s:  It should be the operation of the company.
9170.38s:  So yeah.
9172.38s:  I think for what I can tell from the apes is that the apes seem to be obviously like laser focused on this giant squeeze, which I understand.
9182.38s:  From a CEO perspective, a squeeze is not like a squeeze is short lived right like that's only a thing that happens and then will go away shortly thereafter.
9194.38s:  So then it's a function of how do I operate a company profitably and grow it.
9200.38s:  So I think from Cohen's perspective that is and should be his focus is growing the company.
9210.38s:  So Gillian says do you think RC and or DFV are involved in the BBY GME merger acquisition.
9218.38s:  I don't know shit about that.
9221.38s:  I haven't seen anything concrete about a BBY slash GME merger acquisition.
9228.38s:  And I have absolutely no clue.
9233.38s:  I have absolutely no clue why RC or DFV would be involved.
9244.38s:  Yeah, I don't I don't follow that.
9251.38s:  I mean, if there's information about it.
9254.38s:  I would be happy to look at it.
9256.38s:  I think one of the things that I'm noticing is from a lot of people they're looking at like GameStop and they're starting to look at like all these acquisitions with other meme stocks.
9267.38s:  And like it doesn't it doesn't really line up that well, not saying it couldn't happen.
9273.38s:  But I think like the process for what they choose to get into it be a little more calculated than that is all.
9283.38s:  RC Gillian says you should look into it.
9285.38s:  Your mind will be blown.
9287.38s:  Maybe.
9288.38s:  Yeah, maybe it will be.
9292.38s:  But.
9298.38s:  Willie says, but the initial thesis has always been on a squeezable event.
9301.38s:  Well, that's for I think well, I think for GameStop, the initial thesis has always been value, right?
9306.38s:  Like even before any of these things about a squeeze came out.
9310.38s:  He's talking about the value of the stock.
9312.38s:  So I think that that was his original his original thesis.
9317.38s:  But.
9318.38s:  Yeah, I the BBB why stuff I don't actually fully understand the the allure to it to be honest because I know it has an interesting story.
9339.38s:  I guess maybe because it's like super super cheap.
9343.38s:  Is that why.
9345.38s:  What's the trading it now BBB why.
9353.38s:  Or what what is this.
9360.38s:  Here we go.
9364.38s:  So this one away.
9367.38s:  In May of 23.
9371.38s:  At seven cents.
9375.38s:  So yeah.
9378.38s:  I mean, this hasn't been around for a hot minute.
9387.38s:  I think he says RC bought up 10% retail stock or fall it in then RC dumped I actually don't think that that's the.
9395.38s:  I don't think that that's what happened with Cohen on BBB why at least based on what I understand on his involvement with it.
9403.38s:  It looks like he had other ideas in mind, but then there was some other things that popped up that essentially derailed the plan.
9412.38s:  And I don't think that he actually went to like dump on retail.
9419.38s:  I think that's essentially how the timing went through.
9425.38s:  Blancway.
9426.38s:  He says why did you wait with their first at the market for five months hitting in really high and did not cash in before.
9439.38s:  I think it's really specific.
9442.38s:  I think that from what I've seen so far with GameStop with their at the markets they have very, very, very specific timing that they leverage.
9452.38s:  And I know that they got approval for a massive offering.
9457.38s:  So there's still tons and tons left to go if they are so inclined with the existing offering.
9465.38s:  So yeah, I think when I look at their approach so far, it seems like it's really focused on trying up.
9475.38s:  I can't see I know there's something, but I can't see like what their end vision is in mind.
9482.38s:  And the reason for that is because it seems like.
9488.38s:  At least to me, it seems like at this point we would have some sort of clue is to what the overall idea is here, but I don't really feel like we do.
9499.38s:  Rointit, he says he dumped. I'm not saying he did a profit off retail, but he dumped. I'm saying retail stocked his investment jumped in.
9505.38s:  Oh, yeah, sure. I think that that would be totally fine.
9509.38s:  Because yeah, you're absolutely correct. Like he he xited the position, which is the connotation, right?
9514.38s:  Like when somebody says something like the term dump is a very specific connotation is compared to, you know, like exit, leave.
9522.38s:  But yeah, if it's just saying that he left a position, then yeah, for sure completely agree.
9528.38s:  But Rointit, he says, but retail is mad at him for that.
9531.38s:  Well, retail and what I find in general is like humans are just going to be angry at somebody for something.
9537.38s:  It's just how they are, man. Like people get pissed at me. I get hate mail from the way that I talk about GameStop.
9544.38s:  I get hate mail for literally everything. So it's like, yeah, people are just fucking silly.
9551.38s:  And like to be angry about stuff. And they look for scapegoats because most people struggle to look at themselves and identify their part of something or their reaction to something.
9564.38s:  And they look for something to blame. So yeah, the fact that retail traders were upset at him literally, literally not even a remote surprise to me.
9575.38s:  That sounds completely par for the course because well, people are people.
9584.38s:  GCA says I'm angry and offended by that. Perfect. That's what we go for here.
9590.38s:  All right, gang. That wraps me up. It's time to go grab some dinner. Absolutely blast hanging out though.
9595.38s:  Let me know what we should look at in the next session. You can throw them in the comments.
9599.38s:  You can hit me up on the discord or when I make the post, you can always drop anything that we want to look at there.
9605.38s:  But I want to go through part three of his trades and finish going through those. I literally, I'm learning a ton.
9612.38s:  The thing I want to know the most right now is when does he manage those 17 Jan 21s because he's coming in. I think he's already within 30 DTE.
9621.38s:  So I want to know when that goes down.
9626.38s:  But that's the top of mind for me. Obviously, I'll keep in eyeball on stuff like what GME does, but it's just been, it's been very, very quiet in here.
9640.38s:  So when we're doing stuff again, like when I'm doing my daily market update videos, I still glance at GameStop.
9647.38s:  And if there's something at least somewhat notable, I'll obviously always bring it to your attention.
9652.38s:  At least, you know, what I see. But so far, pretty quiet.
9656.38s:  So as always, blast hanging out. Enjoy the rest of your weekends for the outlier pro members.
9661.38s:  I'll see you on the market prep livestream tomorrow. Everybody else will see in the discord on the next YouTube livestream.
9667.38s:  I'll see you guys later.
