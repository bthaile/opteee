0.00s: What is up, everybody? We got the apes, the outliers, the ape outliers. We got everybody
9.20s: ready to dive in. There's actually a follow-up session from what we kicked off last week,
16.24s: which was diving into Roryn Kitty's old trades. So the goal for today is to finish going
25.72s: through some of his old trades. And then I think we should talk a little bit about kind
30.92s: of what we see going on with GameStop today, because there's quite a few interesting
38.12s: things I think that it's worth going in depth on. And I've gotten a handful of people that
46.08s: have sent me some posts from like Super Stalking Stuff that we want to take a look at. So I
52.32s: am looking forward to digging in with you all. For those that don't know, on the last live stream,
59.60s: I decided to start dropping in where people in the live stream are from. And take a look at the
68.80s: last one we did. This is essentially what we had. So we had people from quite literally all over.
77.52s: I think we were missing Africa is a continent. And then I think we need a little bit of like
83.28s: northeastern over here. But I mean, other than that, we have just about everything covered.
89.52s: The Aussies, you know, I'm friends with the Aussies. I spent some time in the military hanging
94.24s: around them. I still talk with them. So I feel like they're innately covered to a degree. But yeah,
99.68s: I just thought this was so cool. One of the things that I find so fascinating about the GameStop
103.60s: story is that it's this thing that really has taken people from all different kinds of backgrounds
110.56s: and brings them together. Like how literally how fun is that? For me, it's an absolute blast.
116.56s: Because as a lot of you know, I'm a professional trader. It's what I do. And the way that I look at
123.36s: the whole GameStop thing is probably a lot different than the way that a lot of other people look at it.
129.20s: But it's still the fact that the same circumstance brings people from literally all over the place
136.96s: into one spot. It kind of reminds me of the melting pot that is trading or the melting pot that
142.16s: is the military. That's really what comes to mind. The military is really, really good at pulling
147.76s: people together. So yeah, I just get such a kick out of that. So let me grab the chat. I have to make
154.40s: sure that we say hello to everybody and we get this party started. So let me grab this. So we got
163.84s: Dr. Zeyes Sedrick graveter, graveterist, the Nye, Derschlup. Lots of lots of familiar names.
172.16s: Reese Raptures, Pam Sedrick, which I think is said already Carlos,
178.80s: Zachariah, the fresh maker from Germany. Do we have Germany in here? I think we have Germany.
188.72s: It would actually be really nice if you could sort these by name that would be good.
193.28s: It doesn't look like I can easily. I feel like we have Germany though. I feel like I literally just
198.40s: looked at that. We'll type it in. We'll type it in. We'll see.
208.40s: I had that baby in. So we got Germany. I think I think I'm seeing Amsterdam.
217.60s: And then we got Belgium. We got to keep our little thing up to date here. I'm not even going to lie
226.56s: as a very standard Westerner. I don't fully. Is there like a big cultural difference between
237.04s: Germany and Belgium? Just seems so close. I feel like they got to be so close to one another.
258.08s: Beer is a little different. One is beer, one is chocolate. I guess that's fair. Yeah,
262.64s: because I had a friend in high school whose dad was from Belgium and he had opened a chocolate shop.
268.40s: So I guess that makes sense. Interesting. Well, cool. So we got people from all over the map.
275.84s: That's what we're seeing here. So as always, if there is anything that you think we should take a
282.64s: look at or you want to specifically look at, let me know because it is an open agenda where
287.92s: definitely going to poke through some of these existing things like we've talked about. But
293.04s: I fully intend to pick up where we left off. And I've gotten a few questions in the meantime. So
301.28s: one of them is about the 5K share purchase history. We left off at the June 2020 Yolo update.
310.96s: So that's where we're going to go. We like essentially are through a good bit of his previous
317.92s: trades to see what they looked like and the delta between the positions and stuff. So I'm excited
324.64s: to keep moving this forward. Get back into June. Here we go. So this is where we left off.
331.84s: So geez. So a couple of things really stuck out to me from where what we did last time.
340.64s: And as I analyze, I again, like I call it fingerprinting. And literally all it is is I'm trying to
346.72s: identify the behaviors that are unique to a person as a trader. And again, I always feel the need to
355.84s: remind people that from my lens, I'm not trying to deconstruct what Warren Kitty is doing so that I
363.68s: can try to copy him. That's literally not it at all personally. The reason why I like looking at
370.56s: his stuff is because the movements he's made as an investor in trader are naturally fascinating to
378.72s: me. And it's because from a trading perspective, a lot of what he does would not follow a standard
385.92s: fully logical pattern. Not saying he's illogical, but when we're talking about trading investing,
391.44s: the standard logic is make as much money as you can decrease risk. Like those are really the
397.52s: point of this. But every once in a while, you'll come across anomalies that have different
403.04s: objectives. One of my friends, he's a YouTuber. And I talked to him a lot about his preferences as a
410.24s: trader. And he literally has said multiple times that like he doesn't really care that much about
415.36s: making money. He just loves trading that much. What you get to me is fucking crazy. But I also
422.40s: can understand that perspective. So a lot of the things that I see the cat do are just so
428.96s: interesting to me because it highlights such an important difference in motivating factor.
436.88s: If we look at the standard motivating factor, make more money, reduce risk, ideally at the same time.
442.72s: If you can make a bunch of money with low risk, that is generally the pinnacle. But then you can come
449.68s: across somebody like the cat who literally, literally flips all of that all over the fucking place.
457.84s: It's crazy. The fact that when this dude came back and we'll look at it in a second, but the fact
466.00s: that he goes through this process and even the amount of money he came back with, I find really
472.96s: interesting. The way that he trades now, I can't help but find literally fascinating. If you followed
479.36s: my coverage or exploration, I should say of GameStop and my learning of it so far, you're probably
486.48s: exhausted from hearing me saying the term fascinating. But it is the honest truth. I've been a life-long
494.64s: practitioner of markets and I have seen a lot from my start in 2007. You get a sense of what
503.44s: markets do, how people behave, the different motivations and incentives for different participants.
508.80s: Then every once in a while, you come across a fucking anomaly. That's part of the reason why this
515.76s: is just so unbelievably interesting to me. Also shout out to all the apes because there's 69 of us
522.64s: in here right now. I can't help but notice that whenever we do these live streams, we really,
528.08s: we seem to hover around that magical number for just a hot minute. It takes a 69. It takes a crowd
537.04s: to make it happen. So let's start with. Dr. Stase says, if you ever do merge, it should be T-shirts
545.28s: that say fascinating and anomaly. That's hilarious. That would be probably the worst merge
551.04s: launch ever, but it would be typically funny. But yeah, I really do find just about everything
559.20s: pertaining to this just absolutely curious. So all right, let's talk about where we left off.
566.24s: Here's what I noticed leading into this. When we were going through his previous trades, we can see
571.60s: that he went through a very interesting scaling process. And the other thing that I found so
577.36s: interesting about what he was doing is that he clearly was very risk tolerant right from the jump
586.24s: because we've seen even this 100,000 portfolio flow. And it's been all over the map so far.
593.36s: So we've seen it over $200,000 not all that long ago. And not that long before that, we've seen
599.68s: it below $50,000. Right? So February 2020, $44,400, something like that, February 2020, $215,000.
613.04s: Big difference. Then we go from April to May, back down, sub 150. Then we go from May to June,
622.64s: back down again, another 25k to 121. What I'm highlighting is from a normal traders perspective
630.40s: that is insane volatility. And the way that we would typically move around those kinds of positions
637.28s: is very different than this, which is why it's so damn interesting. So the other things that I
647.52s: want to highlight from the last session is that we absolutely found that he is completely confident
653.04s: averaging down as something is declining if he still believes in it, which clearly he did, he
659.60s: continued to cost average, cost dollar average into the position, which is interesting. Now what I
666.80s: noticed with that though is that he would do it with longer term options plays, longer term. I've
675.12s: not seen him do that with some of these shorter term options plays, which I don't know if he does
680.48s: or doesn't. I literally haven't looked past this since we discussed it last Saturday. So now we go
685.60s: back in and pick up where we left off. The goal here was obviously to do a quick recap for anybody
691.12s: that might not have missed it or just once the TLDR. That's essentially it. We have some very
696.32s: clear behaviors and tendencies that we can identify for roaring kitty. So,
703.68s: Cetric says, if I would buy a huge amount of contract, yellow closed to the money on heavily
708.80s: shorted stock, would the same thing not happen? You have to remind me what we're talking about
716.00s: for that. Yeah, I'm not sure. You have to, Cetric, let me know what that means.
723.52s: Cetric says, if you yellow 50K on a heavily shorted stock with options, could anybody have
731.20s: launched it like that now? Because it wasn't just because it was shorted, 50K in options is nowhere
737.76s: near enough. And the other thing is like, he didn't launch, like he doesn't have enough money at this
742.64s: point to cause anything. That's just the reality of things. That's one of the craziest things about
748.24s: this is, and this is one of the things I didn't know about him is he's using leverage via options.
755.28s: The very first trades that we have of his, which is going to take me second, but it's worth showing
759.92s: again, you just have to scroll all the way down here. Oh, yeah, somebody gave me a cheat code on
764.72s: the last one. You guys have to tell me what the last, damn it. Somebody gave me like the specific
768.88s: hot key to get to the bottom instead of having to do this like a freaking caveman, but we're here.
776.24s: So if we go all the way back five years ago, you can see that literally his entire series of
783.12s: positions are options. That's literally how he started doing this, which again, I did not know that.
791.76s: Based on everything I heard, I had the impression that he was a stock trader that sometimes used
800.72s: options to amplify the position, but I didn't take it that he was an options trader, which is what
806.00s: I would classify this as he's absolutely a stock value investor at this point five years ago.
812.56s: No doubt in my mind, but he's using options very, very strategically to create the leverage that he
819.04s: wants his entire, his entire position is all options, which is really interesting to me.
825.36s: I'm going to keep that other tab open just so that if we want to go back down to the bottom,
829.28s: I don't have to play that scrolling game again, but this one will just take me a second to get to
834.24s: June. A key of Vladimir says Eric, look at our case actual moves during January 2021. His
842.16s: cost basis for the options that he held, which is a few thousand, but he was making up to 10 million
847.76s: unrealized gains in a day in January 21. Well, yeah, let's see when we get there.
854.08s: So let's figure out where we are here in June. In June, right now, we just started building a
861.28s: very small stock position. We have 500 shares at a basis of five, 16. And the last price was
872.24s: 434. So let me grab, I think we were using Yahoo Finance. Yeah. I think that's what let us go and
878.24s: like look at the specific chart back in time if I'm not mistaken. Because the on-demand feature in
885.04s: thinkorswim was being super, super not reliable. Let's zoom this thing in, get rid of this. Here we go.
893.28s: So now we want to go to 2021. We can go to May, maybe. Remember last time this gave us some problems.
904.24s: And then let's take this to December, maybe. Of 21. Let's just go to the end there. Let's hit
916.80s: apply. Let's see if this, yeah, see, it did this exact thing last time. Why does it do this last time?
923.52s: Let's try doing like a six month daily. And see if this fixes it. We had the same exact problem
930.72s: last time. I don't know why. And apparently we have an issue with it loading. What is wrong with
942.96s: you? Okay, good. So now we have a six month daily. Now let's go back again. Let's try this one more
947.92s: time. Let's just go to 2021. And I'm just going to essentially look at the whole year and see if
957.36s: this will let us apply that date range. How does that look to you? Because I don't see anything that
967.36s: looks even remotely close. What is this is so frustrating? Is there another charting tool that you
972.16s: guys know? Because this is incredibly annoying. I guess I could just go back here and zoom in. I
981.60s: just wish that I could go to the specific time. Like that would just be nice. I guess we can just
986.72s: do this. This is fine. I'll get over it. I'll be okay. I don't know if I'm going to be okay.
991.84s: Some kind of salty about this. Because this is the thing is like I want the scale to be correct.
999.60s: So we got to get this 21 stuff out of there. There we go. Okay.
1005.68s: Here we go. So we need to go to 2020. Here's June. Okay. We'll go off of here.
1015.44s: So this is now using one week candles, which I don't want. I want daily candles, which then fast
1020.96s: forwards me to today because I hate this. I hate this.
1030.08s: 2019, 2020. Okay. Gang, we got it. Man was that painful. We did it though. We did it.
1037.28s: Also shout out to us. Well, really you, the apes. There's over a hundred of you now.
1044.16s: So I think the next magical number we have to hit. Maybe you have to call a friend. It but is 169.
1048.80s: I think is the next one. I think we cracked over 200 once. I think that was last weekend,
1055.68s: actually. We'll see. We'll see if we can get the gang in town. All right. So let's take a look.
1062.08s: This is what was going back in June. And what I want to, what I'm identifying now is actually how
1070.56s: he behaved. So I'm going to move this over here so that we can essentially have these side by side.
1080.56s: So I can see that the he got in at 516. So again, this is all split adjusted. So I don't know
1089.60s: how many adjustments happen in this time frame. So I don't know actually like where on the nominal price
1094.72s: he would be. I'm just kind of following along with the behavior. So this is from the end of June.
1103.28s: We know that he started doing his updates towards the end of the month. And at this point, he had 500
1109.12s: shares that he accumulated again. His basis was 516. So super small stocks position. But then we can
1117.60s: see another interesting behavior emerge. This is different. This is completely different than what we
1122.88s: saw previously. And it is 100% worth noting is take a look 2021 2021 2021. Right. So we still have
1135.36s: these base positions that are in 2021. And we can see the value of these positions.
1143.68s: The reason why this matters is because he's still playing two things I can clearly identify.
1151.60s: He's playing options that are further out in time. And he's still playing options that are out
1158.24s: of the money. Very important note that these are out of the money options that he's playing that
1163.68s: far out in time. That's a very specific kind of options trade to take, especially in a longer term
1170.48s: time frame, which we can talk about that really quick so that you understand why I'm highlighting
1175.52s: that to you. So I don't know if on demand let's just go back far enough. Does this let us go back
1181.20s: to 20. Let's see, can we get back to 21? We can. Great. And we go back to 20. This is perfect.
1189.68s: So let's go back to the end of June. And let's take a look at his actual portfolio. Don't worry
1195.92s: about these weird bars and stuff. It's just because it's on demand being stupid.
1200.64s: So let you just let this load for a second. Well, I'm literally going to recreate his portfolio
1205.84s: like so that we can see exactly what it looked like, which was one of my goals on the last session,
1210.64s: but we just couldn't go back far enough. Again, don't pay attention at all to this candle. It's
1215.68s: misleading you. It's just because it's on demand and it's broken data. So just take it for what
1220.56s: it's worth. But what we can do is get rid of all of these other positions. This was I think an
1226.48s: example we were doing at some other point. So we'll just clear out the whole portfolio. And then
1230.80s: let's scoop up his exact position. So the first thing we have is 500, 500 shares, 500.
1239.76s: And we got those five Hyundai. His basis was five, six,
1251.84s: five, six, five, one, six, six, three, five. Just being super precise. I'm going to get rid of all
1260.32s: these other we were doing. We've done a million examples. That's why you see all these other
1263.44s: simulated trades in here. Okay. So that's his basis here. And we also have a bunch of options
1273.36s: trades. So we have let's go to we'll do the 21st. So in 21 he has the 16 April 12 calls super
1289.60s: far out of the money as far as you can go. Super far out of the money. And he has 500 of these.
1303.12s: I love the leverage that this dude uses is classic. Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. He doesn't have 500. He
1308.88s: literally has a thousand of these ones. So he has a thousand of these at 40 cents.
1314.24s: Next option. And next option he has is in Jan 15 21.
1331.92s: He has the 20s. What are these? These are like a six delta. This is crazy. So he's buying tiny
1339.68s: little delta's. This is nuts. This is absolutely like mind boggling to me. And he got them for six cents.
1351.76s: Mind boggling. This I'm not even going to lie. This reminds me of like amateur options trader movements.
1361.36s: And I'm not saying that he is. He obviously isn't like he's probably even more skilled than I am.
1366.24s: Not that that's like that high of a threshold to cross. But just these trades are just so
1372.08s: counterintuitive for what would generally make sense based on what I've heard from his thesis,
1377.12s: which we'll talk a little bit about. So it's 15 Jan. He has another. So he has the 20s, the 15s.
1384.00s: Then he goes into 16 October. And he has the eights, which again, super far out of the money.
1393.12s: And he has 500 of those for six cents. So he's buying a bunch of super cheap options.
1401.12s: Super cheap options. Back here. Then we have. So now
1413.20s: now we start getting into near term stuff because he doesn't have anything in in
1419.36s: hog. And he goes to July 17th. Okay, so important note here. Again, for fingerprinting important note.
1430.16s: The last two, the last two series, let me grab this. The last two series that we're going to pull
1436.64s: in here. Take a look. 17 July. What do you notice about all of the expiration choices he's selected?
1444.24s: What do you pick up? There's one very clear thing I see so far. And again, this is the beginning
1450.72s: of the fingerprinting. I don't know what happens next. But this is something that pops into my brain
1455.20s: that I think is important to call out here. And then we'll see what it looks like.
1461.76s: All monthly explorations exactly, Mr. Off Putin. So we are not using weeklies. We go right by the
1469.04s: weeklies and we were just using monthly's, which is smart, by the way, that makes sense to me.
1474.16s: I totally understand why he would do that. So we have these. Did I already grab these? Yes,
1479.76s: so in July now, we need the 12s in July. Again, so far out of the money, so far out of the money.
1488.48s: And for these, he grabbed 500. And he got them for 18 cents.
1506.08s: And then the last one he has is the six, which makes way more sense, still really low delta.
1513.28s: He has 300 of these. And he grabbed these for 0.1367. What does that tell me?
1524.32s: When I just typed in 1367 for these options, what does that tell me? There's a very specific thing I
1531.28s: can understand from that in this instance. Any ideas?
1535.68s: It's another important note, again, with respect to fingerprinting.
1546.88s: Dan says he's using options to grow his shares. The shares are the asset and the options he
1551.84s: trades help grow that I actually don't agree with you. I really don't agree with you.
1556.00s: The reason why I don't agree with you is because he's been trading GameStop for a long time now.
1560.56s: And now he's just starting to purchase shares. And the shares are a trivial amount of the portfolio.
1568.08s: He grabbed 500 shares at 516. If we go back through this archive of all of his positions,
1575.04s: he's trading options. So I actually don't interpret it that way at all. I view it as he's just
1582.00s: trading GameStop to the upside. I don't think he's looking at this as I want this asset. And I'm
1588.40s: going to use the shares to use options to get me to the asset. He had the money to buy 500 shares
1595.36s: when he first opened his account. It was worth about the same. So I don't actually see that here at all.
1608.16s: Okay, so what this tells me, the fact that this is he bought 300 of these 17 July 20s
1617.04s: at 0.1367. What this tells me is he's averaging in. You can't transact at that price. There's no price
1626.32s: that can transact at that. The reason why this matters to me is because when I look at his basis,
1634.40s: I can see, for example, here, these 15 calls in 15 Jan 21. They're at 18 cents. He got to fill
1643.60s: all at once on those. That was 500 of them. These 40s or I'm sorry, these 12 calls out in 12 April
1652.48s: 16. He has a thousand of those. He got them for 40. He was able to get a fill on all of those at
1658.64s: once at one price. These are examples of positions he's averaging into. I would wager more often than
1665.28s: not. It's not concrete. Again, to always keep it a buck with you guys. I can't say that with
1671.28s: certainty because it could be that as he's getting this one order filled, it's getting
1676.80s: pieced up and he's just returned with an average price. That's like that. But the reason why I
1682.96s: deduce more likely than not that these are averaged into is that if he's able to get fills
1688.88s: on bigger positions further out in time, which are less liquid, he's very likely to be able to get
1695.68s: full fills on positions near a term that are smaller. So I think he's averaging into these.
1700.96s: Again, that doesn't mean anything outright. It's just another small data point that I can key into
1707.92s: when I'm looking at these. Now, the other thing I noticed is I have to update some of these prices
1712.40s: because they're wrong. I was using the last updated price. So the 16 April, he got those for 40. That's
1718.16s: correct. The next one here is the 15 change 21 20s. He got those for 0952.0952.
1731.92s: And then the 15s, he got for 18 cents. That's correct. The 8s, he got for 2880. So 0.2880.
1745.44s: Then the 500 of the 12s, he got for 18 cents. That's correct. And then this one's correct.
1752.40s: Okay. So this is where we sit currently. Let me get rid of that slice for now.
1761.92s: And let me catch up on the chat. Vladimir says,
1771.12s: Rohan Titty says, wasn't that when he realized it had high short interest? I think he knew that for a while
1776.56s: to poorly speaking. So let me grab the YouTube channel for him.
1784.56s: And we'll take a quick little peak C.
1791.92s: A key. Let's go to videos. I think it was probably in a live because funny enough both he and I
1799.12s: really like doing live streams. I think we both like live streams way more than videos because he
1803.12s: has way more live streams than he does videos. Four years ago. So okay. So he's already talking about
1812.24s: a squeeze here. What's the date on this? I forgot. There's somewhere you hover. There it is.
1822.08s: Four September 2020. So he's talking about a squeeze here on four September. So it's about
1832.96s: the same time frame. So here's his position as it sits here. So now let's take a look at what his
1843.12s: next position looks like. So we can close this one out. That's June. Let's get to July. In the meantime,
1848.32s: let's see what some of these look like. I think these are all gifts.
1856.96s: Love that. Absolutely love that. Okay. So now we're into July.
1863.36s: And he's now added a much more significant. A much more significant.
1875.92s: Share position. And let's see what's rolled off.
1884.16s: I got to slide this a little further out of the way. So here's what's rolled off.
1888.56s: 16 April is still there. Jan 15 is still there. Double time. Triple time. He's added. He's added to it.
1899.28s: October is still there. 17 July is gone. And that would that would have been eight.
1907.68s: So he did not. This is another really, really important note. Because I know a lot of people all the
1921.52s: times speculate like did he exercise? Did he exercise? This is another example where I can tell he
1928.40s: did not exercise these options. There's a very specific way I can tell he did not exercise any of
1936.08s: these options that we see in here. From his previous portfolio because these came due.
1941.12s: These 17 July's they rolled off and he ended up buying shares.
1947.28s: Rointit he says not enough cash to exercise them. That's a great point. But that is not what tells
1952.00s: me definitively. There's another thing that's even more certain than not having enough capital
1956.96s: because it always could be argued. He added capital to the account and we have no way to prove
1962.08s: or disprove that by the way. We really don't eat it could or could not have happened we wouldn't know.
1972.08s: Cost average. That's exactly correct.
1977.36s: So both lands and H or spot on. I can look at the change in his cost basis. Here we have 500 shares
1986.40s: at 516 and change. Now we have 10,000 way more shares at an average of 411332. We obviously
1996.48s: average down the lowest basis he had in here was an eight. Well, let me go back over here. Sorry.
2004.48s: The lowest basis he had in here was a six in a 12. So the way that this would work is if he
2010.16s: exercised these he would have taken 500 shares times 100. His basis would be this $12 plus the debit
2019.76s: he paid in this case, $0.18. So it would have been 1218 drive his basis up. Same thing even with this
2026.00s: six, this six 1367 would have moved this basis up not down. Sedrick says so we rolled them. No, he did not
2034.08s: roll them. He just took a loss is what happened. He absolutely grabbed more options across the board,
2044.32s: but there's nothing to roll. So if you want to call it a roll, there's nothing necessarily structurally
2050.00s: wrong with calling it that, but it's essentially not what happened though. Those would have came down
2057.28s: for a full loss. So he would have lost the investment on both of these. These two are now gone
2063.68s: right now. In case you guys don't know, I was talking to my mom earlier and she's just sending me
2067.76s: pictures of her spice cabinet, which is hilarious. So I actually didn't ask the ask for these, but
2076.00s: I guess I'm glad that she sent them. Now I know what my mom's spice cabinet looks like. If any of
2080.16s: you guys need to take a look at a spice cabinet, I have a great example. But no, I don't think he
2087.12s: rolled them. I think these just came off for a full loss. He would have lost the investment on them.
2091.68s: Maybe he salvaged a little bit of value left. We could figure that out technically, but I don't
2096.00s: think it matters much. Sedrax says, maybe I don't understand rolling. I thought it was just
2101.20s: selling your option by the next ones. Yeah, that's not completely wrong. That rolling is fake.
2108.00s: That's the way to think about it. And the reason why I say it that way is because people
2111.68s: grossly misunderstand rolling. So there is a video about rolling options. This is another video
2121.92s: about rolling options. And then this is a video about common myths about rolling options.
2129.12s: But Cliff notes version of what a rolled option is. It's literally when we close a position,
2135.12s: open a new position, and we mentally tie the accounting between the two. That's it. But it's
2141.68s: literally just closing a position, opening a new one. So normally when we're rolling a position,
2146.72s: it's like if it's a sold option that's underwater and we're trying to manage it. But
2152.40s: yeah, it's again, it's just fake. It's essentially closing a position, opening a new one,
2156.64s: designed to make you feel better. So anyways, these would have came off. These are gone,
2160.48s: boom, boom, gone. Now we have to size all these up though to represent what he has.
2166.32s: So now what he has, I have to slide it over here so I can see. He now has 10,000 shares.
2173.60s: And he has 10,000 shares at a basis of 4.11332. And he has 1,000 of the 16. These are the same.
2189.12s: These did not change. He bought another 500 of these to bring this up to a thousand of these 20s.
2196.88s: And it brought his basis down again. Important note, he's averaging down.
2203.28s: 726. He's averaging down into these as well. He has 1,000 of these 15s. And he got 1,000 of them now
2214.96s: for 14, averaging down, continuing to average down. And then he has 1,000 of these 16,
2225.84s: oct 28s. And he averaged down these as well. He has these now for two 19. And at this point,
2237.20s: just to show you what the stock was trading at, first I need to update the date in this so that
2244.48s: it shows you correct. We have to go back to 20. Where am I July of 2020? Is that right?
2253.36s: July 2020, we're at the end. And then I need to bring this back to July of 2020 as well.
2260.72s: Here. And the current spot price was $4 in a penny. So I'll throw that here so that we
2276.88s: could see what his PNL, well, we already know what it was, but just so that you could see his full
2280.56s: position. So this is what he's holding right now. And that's where GameStop is currently trading.
2288.48s: And this is looking at June 30th.
2293.68s: Cedric says you have a video on CFDs. No, we don't really trade CFDs much here in the States.
2299.04s: It's actually really difficult to trade them. And I don't like CFDs at all. I think they're
2302.64s: like terrible, terrible products. So I don't trade them much myself. And I wouldn't,
2312.56s: you know, turn, I wouldn't like talk about something that I don't have experience in. So that
2318.32s: one I wouldn't be able to help. Sorry. Zacharias says no wonder Wall Street Betsy's ragging on
2328.72s: crazy even for him. Yeah, absolutely insane. Literally absolutely insane.
2333.60s: So this is what it looked like for him. We have to go to the end of July, which is when this came
2343.20s: through. Right now the chart is updating. So again, don't pay attention to the latest candle. It's
2352.40s: all it's all bullshit. Zacharias says the most hydrated man on YouTube. Yeah, dude, I take,
2358.64s: drinking fluids very seriously. It's because I, I sweat like a horn church. So
2365.52s: and I'm typically physically active. The whole herniated dyspsiatic thing is still
2371.04s: kind of fucking me up, but not terribly. So yeah, I'm still going to the gym every day.
2381.12s: Still got to keep hydrated. So let's see kind of just oscillating sideways here.
2392.72s: And so this is what his position looks like. 112K. Nothing really jumping out of me yet.
2403.84s: Let's see what he's talking about here. I'm curious what the tenor was of the conversation.
2417.36s: Humulating GME 2, painfully boring, market makers have pinned for for I don't think this is true,
2426.72s: but I know people use this all the time.
2438.88s: The only catalyst is whether or not GameStop can transition online, which is really interesting,
2443.76s: because this is four years ago. I think Amazon should buy them likely considering it. That's funny.
2453.76s: They were still doing well in sales.
2459.44s: Lance says gotta stay hydrated. Don't want to silver bullet. Yeah, well,
2462.40s: that's kind of the problem, you know, with all those fucking Cormin out there, they're real,
2466.48s: real excited to try to, you know, take a core temperature, which on the marine officer side of
2473.60s: the house, that is literally like it's literally not going to happen. You would, I would rather die
2481.92s: than go through that, especially if it's in front of like the dudes or something, like there's no
2486.64s: fucking way. I would fight the Cormin. There's literally no way. So yeah, you gotta watch, you gotta watch
2492.00s: them Cormin. They were real stoked whenever that process comes up. Reeks.
2500.96s: We're into the said, did GameStop just change its logo? Let's see.
2520.32s: Hmm, doesn't look it.
2522.16s: Somebody says that there's something new like six months ago, but I don't see it.
2538.24s: I don't see a change.
2542.00s: Titty says I saw it on Newton's video today. I'll text him. I didn't watch this video today.
2546.64s: Let me text him.
2552.56s: I'll see what he says. I just asked him.
2578.56s: Yeah, this, I mean, this looks, looks the same to me.
2586.72s: All right, so that's the end of July. I want to finish going through this post first.
2594.88s: So this looks like he's starting to win people over.
2598.24s: And you can tell that about four years ago, people are,
2612.24s: yeah, people are starting to come around.
2618.80s: Which that's really interesting. So it tells me it took about a year, it seems.
2622.80s: Also, there's 151 apes in here, which is sick, but we're very close to 169.
2633.36s: So if there is maybe, maybe if your grandma is interested in GameStop or something,
2639.20s: it would be a perfect time to invite her in and let her know that she can be part of a childish joke.
2644.56s: Okay, this is just a lot of people talking. I was curious.
2652.80s: I'm going to be timely month and let's see what this is.
2658.96s: Huge news going to be month and update on Monday.
2663.68s: What's your target sitting on eight calls? No precise target just up.
2671.20s: Okay.
2675.12s: GCA says, please don't ever say 69 and grandma in the same sentence again.
2681.20s: I'm just saying GC, I mean, I don't know how old your grandma is, but if she did anything
2686.88s: in like the 60s or 70s, she's probably more familiar with that number than you are, I would imagine.
2692.56s: So we just got to keep it a buck out here. I wouldn't, don't start disengrama.
2704.48s: No, no, no, no, no, same. Okay. So here we go.
2708.56s: Massive, massive, massive change, massive change, 112, the end of July, 612 in August.
2725.12s: So let's see what's changed.
2734.88s: Nothing. Nothing's changed. All the positions are the same.
2741.12s: He's just held them.
2745.68s: And we can see the total gain here. Oh, that's interesting.
2754.88s: Okay.
2762.88s: Value is 112.
2770.32s: Value is 112. Value is 612.
2777.36s: I think he added money.
2778.72s: I think he added money here.
2787.20s: I'm grabbing a quick little workbook so that we can look together.
2793.68s: So, because here's what I see.
2799.28s: I see had 112, 238, 78.
2809.60s: And then I see he moves to 619 or 612, 191, 84.
2824.80s: So this is a $449,000,
2836.56s: or essentially a $500,000 variance, which is not compensated by this total gain.
2845.84s: So the other thing I see here is he's aggressively saving.
2850.96s: Because here his portfolio went up, 441, 410, 93.
2856.64s: So then the variance that's not captured here, like 58 grand.
2876.80s: Interesting.
2879.52s: And it looks like he added some options. You guys are showing me the 17s.
2883.84s: So now he has Oct.
2886.96s: And then 12345.
2894.40s: 52021 expertise.
2897.44s: Let's see.
2898.72s: Yep. Okay.
2901.44s: So he still has the Oct.
2903.12s: He still has the Jan.
2908.80s: He added 17s.
2918.00s: And he also added 10s.
2919.44s: And he still has the 8th.
2921.84s: So let's add those.
2928.00s: So let's do.
2938.16s: We need to go to Jan 21, which again, about still really long expiration.
2944.00s: That's where the vast majority of his money is.
2948.40s: And he added the 17s and the tens.
2952.40s: So the 17s super far out of the money.
2955.12s: He had as a thousand of those he likes round numbers.
2958.16s: And he likes the positions being about the same.
2962.08s: And he got those for 15 cents.
2967.20s: And then he also added the tens closer to the money.
2973.12s: Still low delta, thousand of those.
2977.36s: And he got these for 20 cents.
2981.60s: Those got hit at the same price.
2985.60s: All right, let's double check.
2995.60s: So we have 10,000 at war 11.
2999.36s: That's good.
3001.76s: These April's would have come down.
3005.60s: So he probably would have taken profit on those.
3008.32s: Oh no, that's damn it.
3011.52s: I took the wrong ones down.
3012.48s: I'm an idiot.
3013.04s: I'm a damn.
3014.48s: I have to add those back.
3016.48s: All right, let me finish checking the other ones.
3017.92s: Then I'll add those back.
3018.88s: Stupid.
3019.92s: I got it this way.
3021.92s: So we have the 20s.
3024.08s: We have the 17s.
3025.84s: And I reorganize these or no, that would be slick.
3030.48s: Apparently not.
3031.20s: That would have just been too convenient.
3033.60s: So we have the 20s, 17s, 15s, 10s, 8s.
3037.76s: Okay, so I just got to add those.
3039.20s: April was back real quick.
3042.40s: And he hasn't really added more to these April's,
3045.12s: which I find interesting.
3046.56s: And again, these were the 12s.
3049.76s: And he has a thousand of those.
3052.96s: And he got into these for 40 cents.
3058.00s: And he got into these for 40 cents.
3066.08s: So now he was trading for like $6.68 here.
3080.40s: Cool.
3080.88s: Yeah, so it looks like he added money to the account.
3084.40s: That's one of the things I noticed here.
3093.76s: Talking about says cash dropped and he added 15,
3098.56s: Jan 17 calls, yeah.
3099.68s: So he used cash for sure.
3102.80s: But the point I was making before about the likelihood of him adding money
3107.76s: is because he didn't, this doesn't account for the difference between what his account was
3115.60s: before and what it is now.
3118.32s: So it tells me that something moved around in the account.
3122.24s: What exactly?
3123.04s: I'm not positive.
3124.80s: But something here moved around for sure.
3129.04s: Roryntady says he was building a long dated gamma ramp.
3131.76s: I don't actually think that myself personally.
3136.96s: And it's for a bunch of different reasons.
3139.20s: But the main thing is like none of these positions are even like remotely close
3144.80s: to causing anything like that.
3146.40s: Even in a stock that's hard to borrow,
3148.40s: these are still really, really small positions.
3151.12s: And by going this far out in time,
3153.68s: it really will depend on entirely where the stock is around this point.
3158.00s: The entire purpose and function, I have a video about gamma.
3167.36s: So I have a video here
3173.60s: that talks about essentially what that actually looks like and how that works.
3181.44s: And what I notice pretty clearly
3186.72s: is when we're talking about a gamma squeeze, there's like very, very specific conditions
3191.76s: that lead to it.
3193.12s: So one of the things that I would wager is like,
3198.16s: with these being so far out in time,
3199.76s: there's essentially a null factor there.
3202.24s: And it'll be so dependent on what the underlying is trading at as we get closer.
3206.24s: So I don't even think he was viewing it as some sort of gamma ramp.
3211.68s: I think here it's mostly him just playing leveraged,
3215.52s: which is again, like as I look across the bulk of his exposure,
3220.40s: like that's exactly what I see him continuing to do,
3223.84s: is gain leverage, like that's exactly what this is.
3227.44s: Let's August, here's September,
3231.28s: 612 to 832.
3236.32s: Same size across the board, same options across the board.
3240.72s: So he's just holding.
3246.40s: He's still just holding.
3250.80s: 16-Sep.
3262.40s: Same.
3265.36s: No change.
3268.00s: Didn't add any shares.
3270.56s: What I'm trying to identify now
3274.96s: is when do these ox roll off?
3277.68s: I want to know when he catches in on those, assuming that he does.
3281.44s: But again, here's another prime time example of something that is just fascinating.
3287.52s: In my opinion, there's no reason to cash in on these right away.
3292.40s: However, if this were my trade, I would have a resting stop loss
3299.12s: so that if it does start to dive down, I would still get out and capture most of this profit.
3306.16s: For this profit, I should say.
3308.16s: So my question then becomes, does he do that?
3312.32s: I don't think he does.
3313.36s: My guess is if these start trading down,
3315.52s: he would just take them to the downside.
3317.12s: That's my guess.
3318.32s: But let's see.
3319.60s: So it takes us to September.
3324.00s: Oh, he does a bunch of intramont updates.
3326.64s: That's interesting.
3329.84s: Let's take a quick look at this because I still think he's adding money, by the way.
3335.76s: Let's take a look at these ones.
3344.32s: I'm going to move this over.
3347.36s: And then let's grab this again.
3351.60s: And let's take a look together.
3354.32s: So here, let's just do a total gain
3360.56s: just to make this a little easier to compare.
3366.64s: I'm not have to rebuild it each time.
3368.96s: Little gain,
3370.72s: cash, value.
3379.04s: You guys already know it's got to be formatted, right?
3384.32s: So this was one's this update, one step, one step.
3390.64s: Here are one of those.
3402.88s: And okay.
3406.48s: So game stop here.
3410.48s: Total gain is 652,
3414.48s: 610, 93,
3417.92s: 3,
3419.12s: cash,
3421.12s: 83, 91, 84,
3424.96s: value, 823,
3428.08s: 391, 84.
3435.36s: Okay.
3439.04s: So now,
3444.32s: let's see what happens.
3448.00s: This is 16-SEP.
3457.92s: Gain, 802,
3464.08s: 910, 93,
3468.40s: cash,
3470.64s: 85,
3472.48s: 38,
3473.28s: 80,
3475.28s: 804,
3478.24s: value,
3479.60s: 973,
3481.68s: 83,
3482.64s: 804.
3485.60s: So now what we can do is just a quick analysis.
3490.64s: We can look at the change.
3503.20s: So now we can see a few things.
3530.96s: The first thing is the total value of the portfolio
3537.92s: moved by 150,000.
3541.28s: And the total gain moved by 153,
3546.64s: 153,
3549.20s: so this looks completely fine, like these line up perfectly.
3552.80s: Right? So this plus this equals this.
3555.76s: So this tells me that no money is moved.
3558.64s: So now we continue.
3561.28s: Dr. Zeyes says he holds the same position until 19-Nove.
3565.28s: Yeah, that's cool.
3566.88s: What, what I'm,
3569.68s: Dr. Zeyes, well, for everybody, I don't know if you guys know,
3571.68s: the whole point of this live stream is to go through this in detail.
3576.80s: So I respect that you are providing the read ahead.
3580.88s: But what I'm doing is I'm analyzing not just what changes he makes to his position.
3585.60s: I'm analyzing what happens to the cash,
3588.72s: how he behaves with respect to stuff like that.
3593.76s: So that's my objective here.
3603.12s: So now, total gain, can you guys see this excel sheet, by the way?
3609.76s: I can't tell how much is on the screen.
3611.36s: I can try to squish it down a bunch.
3613.12s: TG is 111127.33.
3624.16s: And then cash.
3626.88s: What I'm going to do actually is make this a little more convenient for me.
3632.72s: So this is just part of like my general workflow.
3636.08s: I try to not have, I don't like skipping cells when filling stuff in because it's annoying.
3642.24s: So what I'll do is I'll move like those calculated cells to the end like over here,
3647.12s: something like this.
3651.84s: Okay, so cash. See, like this is, this is a giant difference.
3655.68s: 250, 016.79. That's a giant change.
3661.44s: Value 150111679.
3676.32s: So something specific is going on here.
3691.60s: So like this.
3702.08s: Here, money moved. I can tell you money moved.
3712.40s: Because again, what I'm doing is I'm looking at the variance in the value of the portfolio.
3719.28s: That tells me it's 527,000.
3722.48s: I can look at the variance in total gains and then the cash.
3729.36s: And then if these don't line up, something moved.
3733.20s: So between these, these two added, gives me 549,000,
3740.96s: which should account for that total delta.
3742.80s: This should be that, but it's not.
3744.64s: So in this case, it's very clear that money moved.
3749.44s: And again, this is the whole point of going through these.
3755.44s: And also the other thing that I just noticed is, look at this.
3758.24s: See, this is why you have to trust but verify.
3760.88s: You got to look at everything because this isn't the same shit, right?
3764.72s: October is gone.
3765.84s: So he's now down in options position.
3769.44s: So very likely,
3775.28s: so very likely this is something that he offloaded.
3778.72s: Like he obviously wouldn't have taken it, well, he could have taken it into expiration,
3781.84s: but we're not, we're not there at expiration.
3784.24s: So this is still 22 September, September, October.
3787.68s: So then in that case, he would have unwound his oct.
3797.52s: And then what, again, this is another important part of the fingerprinting.
3803.52s: Because today's date in here is 22 September.
3807.44s: Was it here in 16-sep?
3808.80s: It was here in 16-sep.
3811.84s: So between 16-sep and 22-sep is when he unwound that position.
3820.48s: And again, the reason why that matters is because these were expiring on 16 oct.
3828.80s: So he probably took them down right after this, I would imagine.
3833.20s: If not right before this, about a month early.
3837.44s: Again, that's a massive, massive, massive, important piece of data.
3842.64s: It's because it tells me he didn't hold this all the way into expiration,
3848.72s: like we've seen in a few others.
3850.96s: So this is now gone.
3853.44s: Also Newton just hit me back.
3859.12s: Oh, I see what he's talking about.
3871.68s: So Newton shot me a text with what he was looking at.
3874.80s: Let me see if I can show you.
3882.80s: Ha, we got to stand up.
3888.64s: So what Newton's talking about is, I don't know if you can see.
3894.96s: Let me actually, let me grab this really fast.
3900.08s: He's talking about this.
3907.68s: So I don't know what that is.
3911.28s: But it is,
3913.44s: Cedric says was a month ago.
3914.96s: Okay, got it.
3915.52s: So they just changed the color.
3917.44s: But what's also interesting.
3926.88s: Interesting.
3927.68s: What's also interesting is if you look at the little icon, it's the same red G red S.
3936.88s: So that's interesting.
3939.28s: They didn't change the little cookie note thing or whatever the hell that the chip or I don't
3942.96s: know what the fuck it's called, but you know what I'm talking about.
3947.20s: Uh, off-poon says why not track is price paid?
3951.76s: Yeah, that's a dog.
3954.96s: Are you, are you following along with us, homie?
3957.36s: That's that's what all of this is.
3958.96s: It's exactly what I'm looking at.
3962.72s: Flavicon.
3963.52s: Okay, cool.
3964.00s: Thank you.
3964.32s: That's what it is.
3965.92s: So yeah, so the logo now is all black.
3968.40s: But the Flavicon is still red and black.
3972.88s: No idea if that means anything.
3974.88s: Flavicon, sorry, Cedric, you got me out here saying Flavicon.
3977.76s: I'll say whatever it is because I don't know what it's called.
3980.16s: I'll call it the the fucking Flavaflavecon, right?
3985.44s: So you got me out here looking dumber than I already look.
3988.24s: So thanks for that, I suppose.
3994.00s: Didn't quite feel like I deserved that that kind of treatment, but okay.
3998.48s: I thought we might have had an understanding with one another.
4001.36s: Also, you already know we got to get the dinner order started tonight.
4005.92s: I'm feeling probably Buffalo Wild Wings again.
4008.64s: I'm on like a shitty food.
4012.08s: Oh, Mexican sounds good though.
4014.16s: Shit.
4014.88s: All right, there's the question.
4015.92s: Is it Mexican or is it Buffalo Wild Wings?
4022.08s: Roryn Titty says Flavaflave, are you even old enough to know who that is?
4025.52s: I don't think so.
4026.96s: I don't know anything about him.
4030.96s: I think he had like the big clocks, right?
4033.28s: Was that his thing?
4036.16s: Or is that somebody else?
4042.00s: Yeah, the big clocks.
4051.20s: Poppy chicken, Mexican, yeah boy.
4054.08s: Okay.
4055.36s: Flavor of love.
4057.60s: So it looks like we might have to run up.
4064.56s: H says you've been on a Mexican terror lately, Brass.
4066.72s: I know it's been like on fleek.
4069.28s: Everybody says I always order barbecue, but
4075.76s: I'm gonna text Mel, see what she says.
4078.40s: I'm gonna say Mexican or B-Dubs.
4082.40s: We'll see what she comes back with.
4086.80s: We will see.
4091.28s: Yeah, so anyways,
4096.08s: now we know, um, oh, let's see.
4099.68s: Oh, Mel votes B-Dubs.
4101.68s: That actually surprised me a little bit.
4103.36s: I might have Mexican fooded her out, to be honest.
4107.76s: I don't actually blame her entirely because
4112.08s: I've been running, I've been running Mexican pretty regularly.
4117.12s: But she's down for some B-Dubs, so we'll get that order started.
4122.40s: Grab that, grab that.
4123.84s: I order the same shit every single time, so it takes me like two seconds.
4129.20s: Done.
4131.28s: And done.
4132.88s: One.
4138.80s: Vladimir Putin says I must be blind because your comms don't track his cost bases that I see.
4143.36s: Oh, I'm not, I'm not tracking the cost bases here.
4145.84s: The cost bases here doesn't matter at all.
4148.56s: So all I'm doing here is I'm looking for changes in cash movement.
4155.28s: That's all.
4156.24s: That's, that's the entire purpose of this section.
4159.04s: So what, where I'm tracking his cost bases for the trades is in here so that I can track the
4164.64s: difference from movements and positions.
4168.32s: But the entire point of this up here is literally just seeing when money flows in and
4173.84s: flows out.
4174.88s: And again, it's clear as day.
4177.04s: If, if these two don't match, this tells me right away that there's a variance of some sort
4183.28s: that's driven by cash.
4185.68s: Oh, I just got a long text from Newton.
4187.44s: Okay.
4191.68s: I'm just reading through to make sure I'm not saying anything I shouldn't say.
4198.32s: Okay.
4198.96s: So Newton says they've rebranded a lot of their in-house hardware accessories from
4205.60s: A-tricks to this.
4209.12s: I actually don't, I don't know what A-tricks is.
4217.76s: What's A-tricks?
4236.56s: OEM.
4237.36s: Is that it?
4238.72s: What is A-tricks?
4241.68s: A-tricks.
4242.40s: I've heard him say that before.
4251.60s: I have no clue he deep in fundamentals.
4254.08s: Yeah.
4255.12s: I don't know what this means.
4259.28s: They've rebranded a lot of their in-house hardware accessories from A-tricks to this.
4266.24s: Okay.
4266.72s: Thank you, Agent Per, you to bomb.
4268.56s: So Agent Per says it's just like an accessory brand.
4272.00s: Okay.
4272.32s: Got it.
4273.52s: So, and then he says,
4277.44s: he says, I think it's okay.
4278.80s: I'm not a business person and I don't know to what extent the SEC and lawsuits impacted
4283.36s: GameStop and Ryan Cohen's work.
4285.44s: NFT marketplace was failure because of SEC as an example.
4289.76s: But I don't, but I feel like it would have been a no-brainer to rebrand everything in 2021.
4295.12s: And use a logo that the community would identify, pump out, yep, higher margin merge.
4299.76s: Yeah.
4301.60s: Okay.
4302.08s: Got it.
4304.00s: Super helpful for my boy Newton.
4307.92s: And let me catch up to you guys.
4309.76s: Day swag says any discrepancies would be RK adding money for external accounts.
4314.40s: Yeah, it would be money moving.
4317.68s: It would absolutely be money moving in some capacity.
4320.56s: So Vladimir Offpun says,
4322.56s: Day swag, no, he's selling some contracts.
4324.48s: No, that doesn't that doesn't jive because if he's selling contracts and not reinvesting it,
4330.08s: guess where it goes right here, amigo.
4332.72s: So that's why his cash went up is because selling contracts and then he did something with the
4339.60s: like he didn't do anything with the cash.
4341.52s: So when there's a variance, again, that's why I'm tracking this.
4344.88s: When there's a variance between the account value after accounting for total gain and cash,
4352.08s: Vladimir Offputin says he buys other contracts, but he didn't.
4356.72s: Like I dog, I don't know what's going on with you today off Putin.
4360.64s: Normally you are on Putin, but you are off Putin right now.
4365.52s: You're really off Putin.
4367.20s: That's why there's literally what we're looking at.
4370.16s: There's no variance in any of these.
4372.00s: There's no added contracts, no added lots, no new contracts added to this.
4377.20s: There's no new shares added to this.
4378.88s: No change, price paid.
4380.64s: There's no change in any of it.
4382.64s: But again, what I can see is that there is a change in value.
4389.04s: And again, for off Putin, this is where you're on Putin.
4394.00s: Because again, I agree.
4395.52s: I think some of this is from the options that he closed out for a profit.
4399.52s: But when you close an option out for a profit, it's going to get placed into cash.
4403.84s: Look at change in price paid.
4410.56s: Sure.
4411.68s: So we have price paid down here.
4414.72s: So we have 4.11.
4417.60s: We have the 10 calls at 20.
4426.48s: We have the 15s at 14.
4430.08s: We have the 17s at 15.
4434.24s: We have the 16 April 21s at 40.
4440.24s: And we have the 15 Jan 21s 20s.
4445.60s: These are the same exact things.
4447.68s: Nothing change, man.
4449.60s: Again, that's my point.
4451.92s: Is that this tells me that money moved from the account.
4456.08s: So none of these positions changed.
4459.20s: From his last update, we had more cash show up from his other options place.
4463.76s: That was not rolled into new positions.
4466.24s: Nothing changed.
4467.76s: But there is a variance in his account value that I can see.
4473.12s: So because of that variance, let me make sure.
4475.68s: So you guys can see that.
4477.28s: It's this column here that I'm most concerned about.
4480.32s: This column shows me variance.
4483.52s: So again, I'm tracking all of those things.
4485.84s: That's why that's literally why I'm looking at this.
4489.28s: And based on looking at this again, like money moved in this scenario.
4494.24s: The value delta of the portfolio here is 527.
4498.24s: And what it should have been considering these two is 549.
4503.04s: So this tells me money came out of the account more likely than not.
4506.64s: Like 22k moved.
4508.48s: Don't aware.
4509.04s: Don't know why, but it moved.
4510.72s: I can see it.
4513.68s: So we continue our digging.
4518.16s: But before we continue our digging, I got to go grab our little man Thor.
4523.36s: So I will be right back.
4525.12s: I got to grab the dude.
4527.36s: Quick.
4529.20s: What?
4530.24s: I would say.
4533.76s: A quick 38 second hiatus time starts now.
4553.36s: Well, he's not he's not digging it.
4579.84s: Here he is.
4592.40s: Oh,
4593.12s: Oh,
4594.48s: here he is.
4596.40s: The boss growing to this is you're so late.
4599.28s: I don't feel like I was that late.
4601.04s: It felt like I was talking, but he just wasn't he wasn't showing up.
4606.40s: But he's now ready.
4608.24s: See, you got to get into the he is as tuxedo on.
4611.52s: He's very formal.
4613.28s: He's known for his formalities.
4615.44s: He's ready to look at rowing.
4617.36s: Are you going to be rowing Thor?
4619.44s: Is that going to be your little thing?
4622.40s: You could be rowing Thor.
4626.00s: I think he's ready.
4627.60s: All right, let's get back to it.
4630.64s: So now let's take a look at the next.
4635.36s: Let's take a look at the next update.
4638.64s: Do tato says thores thoughts.
4643.04s: Why is he always talking to this stupid box?
4646.00s: I feel like that's got to be it.
4647.60s: Sometimes he gets like really over when I'm talking because whenever I'm talking,
4651.60s: I typically talk kind of loud.
4653.60s: I don't know why it's just like a natural tendency I've built.
4657.12s: So sometimes he'll just dip.
4661.20s: He should be like, yo, I'm getting the hell out of here.
4664.32s: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
4672.64s: 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000, 1000 all the way across the board.
4676.00s: No changes at all.
4679.04s: Okay, so this will be.
4685.76s: When is this?
4688.80s: 30 step.
4693.36s: And now we continue.
4695.20s: So tg is 989 027.
4700.56s: 0.33.
4703.04s: Cash.
4703.68s: I have to slide this over.
4705.68s: I think you guys can still see the full thing.
4709.28s: Cash is 250.
4713.36s: Oh, 2235.
4715.60s: So he just gained some interest there.
4717.76s: Values 1379.
4719.44s: 022.35.
4729.36s: I messed up.
4731.44s: Oh, no, I didn't.
4738.64s: Yeah, so this lines up perfectly.
4740.16s: Let me make this a little easier.
4756.08s: Of formula.
4760.32s: If this.
4765.04s: It's not letting me type in my formula.
4768.00s: I have to type in the.
4770.32s: Can I do that?
4771.12s: It doesn't look like that's annoying.
4786.48s: If this equals this.
4791.76s: Then we do.
4794.32s: Uh,
4798.48s: we'll just do binary.
4805.36s: So I'm just making it easier for us to eyeball stuff for one more looking at it later.
4826.64s: So we can clearly identify when there's changes like here.
4836.40s: Definitely a change.
4838.88s: So in this case, where we can see money moved here and money so far hasn't moved otherwise.
4846.96s: So now we go on.
4848.72s: So now we go to eight.
4850.56s: Oct.
4852.32s: Eight.
4853.28s: Oct.
4855.28s: TG.
4856.56s: One.
4857.68s: Eight eight three nine two seven.
4862.24s: Dot three three.
4864.16s: Ash 250.
4865.68s: So he's not doing much with this cash.
4867.92s: 25423.
4870.64s: Value 227.
4873.76s: Four.
4874.80s: Three two three.
4877.76s: So no change.
4879.52s: Same same.
4880.48s: Same.
4882.64s: Same positions.
4883.68s: Same.
4884.64s: Prices.
4887.20s: Yep.
4887.60s: Oh good.
4891.60s: Of Vladimir says remember he had two weeks between yellow updates posts.
4895.68s: We see a snapshot of a particular point in time and not all of his transactions.
4899.52s: Yeah, of course.
4900.08s: That's the that's.
4901.84s: I'm confused man.
4904.08s: Like that's that's the entire point of looking between these.
4907.68s: It's not.
4909.20s: While we're doing this, we're not seeing any like complete evidence of every transaction
4917.60s: that happened or to to you know what extent.
4920.56s: But what it does let us see very distinctly is exactly what you just highlighted,
4927.20s: which are the changes in between them.
4930.64s: And then we can make inferences.
4934.56s: Of Vladimir says I was just in a topic for minutes ago.
4936.64s: Okay.
4936.88s: Yeah, because.
4942.08s: Vladimir off Putin says 168 to 139 and cost basis on his posted yellow option updates.
4952.64s: You're confusing me.
4954.80s: So when you're talking in here, when you say his cost basis, you're talking about price paid.
4960.64s: And you're saying that there was a one moving from 162 to 139.
4967.12s: Right.
4968.00s: That again, that is captured.
4972.40s: The reason why the cost basis changed is because a line item trade is now gone.
4980.08s: Right.
4980.40s: So if we have a long call that has a price paid that comes up expiration time for him to manage it,
4988.24s: whatever it is.
4989.84s: That is originally captured here.
4993.20s: Then when he chooses to sell the long call, price paid will come down to account for that
5001.92s: long call as a line item disappearing.
5005.84s: That's exactly why you see it go from 162 to 139 is because a position went away.
5011.84s: As that long call goes away, it moves into cash.
5017.44s: So this changing again, like the price paid here for the analysis that we're doing in the
5024.64s: 6L sheet, it literally doesn't matter because it's going to be captured.
5030.56s: The way it's going to be captured is because I'm tracking the difference between total gain
5038.32s: cash and value that is all of the possible buckets for the money to be in at a given point
5046.56s: in time unless it is removed from the bucket.
5051.68s: So in this case, I can tell you its money was removed from the bucket and it's because of the
5059.92s: variance between these.
5062.64s: So it's exactly how I can track between yellow updates if there's changes to the position
5069.68s: or if there's changes to the cash.
5072.40s: And again, I have no context as to for the cash side of things, why what changes, but I can validate
5081.68s: if it changes.
5084.96s: So again, that's literally the entire point of doing this is so that we can get a sense of how
5091.20s: these things move. So now back at it. Last one we know is 8 oct. Now we have 15.
5098.80s: Oops, clicked wrong thing, my bad. 15 oct. So 1000.
5106.40s: Jan, Jan, Jan, Jan, Jan, April. Jan, Jan, Jan, so no change. Same, same. No change in any of the
5114.64s: basis here. Oops, I want to move this over. We don't need the space.
5128.40s: Yes, so this is fine.
5132.32s: Cedric says, so if something changed, we should see it between yellow updates. 100%
5136.64s: that is exactly why we're looking at this is because we will see it between the yellow updates.
5141.76s: No matter what happens, whether he adds a position, whether he adjusts a current position,
5147.36s: whether he takes cash in or out, I will see it. Because if he sells some of a position,
5154.00s: and then let's say for an example, if he sells some of his position but then buys
5158.32s: some more of the same position, I'll still see it because the price
5162.56s: chain, the price paid for that individual line item will show a variance. I will be able to
5167.68s: detect it. Again, that's why doing this line by line is really informative because we've already
5173.12s: seen a few changes. So now the TG here is 1902, 827.33. Then we have cash, 250, 299.5. So cash decreased
5190.08s: slightly. I don't know why, but slightly. 2293, 099.5.
5203.68s: So cash came down slightly, but the variance lines up.
5213.84s: Interesting.
5220.72s: So something happened here. I don't know what. I have to earmark this.
5235.04s: So my best guess is again, I don't know why 12350 moved, but 12350 moved.
5244.96s: Now, even though these line up telling me that there was no change to the position,
5252.32s: like we did take something. Because if this 123 moved and it's not reflected in any of these
5261.20s: other positions, because again, they would have moved, something happened. I don't know what,
5266.56s: but again, something happened. 15 oct, 22 oct.
5270.72s: TG, Jesus, 235, 600.
5280.32s: Cash is 25301.60, value 2636, 901.6.
5300.56s: And then
5312.24s: 10,000. These are all the same. Big change though.
5330.80s: Interesting.
5346.56s: Oh, because I, that's why I was wondering. I was like, I did the, I like couldn't figure out.
5351.12s: This was completely wrong. But it was from here. I grabbed the day game instead of total gain,
5357.36s: because I'm an idiot. So 2246, 627, got 33.
5366.96s: Perfect match. We're good.
5369.44s: AT says total gain is all wrong and all caps as well deserved spot on.
5374.64s: 30 oct.
5382.80s: Got a backup.
5385.04s: Okay, so 30 oct.
5388.48s: TG, let's get it right this time is 932, 627.301.
5396.72s: Cash, 253.303.
5400.80s: 0.52, that looks like, to me, that just looks like interest.
5407.28s: Values 1322, 903, got 52.
5424.56s: And I miss something up. What did I mess up?
5428.24s: 1332, 903.
5441.68s: Oh, so this is just a rounding. Okay.
5445.60s: So when I look at this here, I can see that this should be, you know, 131399810.
5452.96s: This is, you know, 131399808. So this literally is just like a small rounding error.
5460.16s: I'm not worried about that. That's just missing a decimal. So essentially, we need this to be
5467.52s: like 90, 190 would be the delta here. So for cash, if I take off like two pennies,
5476.24s: or I'm sorry, add two pennies, it'll line up. I'm not going to do that.
5482.16s: But I'm just going to highlight this as a rounding, discrepancy.
5488.24s: That's all that is. And it's just because we don't see all the digits. So small, tiny, small
5494.24s: rounding variants like that is to be expected. Five, no.
5503.20s: No change in position again. So this is also really interesting. Like how much he holds
5509.84s: these as they oscillate around. 10 some five, five, two, seven, dot three, one, cash is two,
5522.88s: 50, 30, 352, exact same. 1465, 80, 352.
5531.52s: Same same. So here's one of the interesting things I find. So this position is now up $314,000.
5547.04s: Let's keep an eyeball on that really fast. So last price was 340. That's on five, no.
5553.60s: 251. Like this, that's not normal. That is not normal. The fact that this position was showing
5566.80s: over half a million dollar gain. And then we don't rest a stop order is absolutely insane.
5576.32s: It's absolutely insane. It's incredible. But that's not normal.
5583.60s: Because think of it this way, he's holding something here that the gain represents again,
5589.12s: $600,000 gain, $600,000 gain. And he lets it go from $600,000 down to $250, back up to 314.
5601.44s: So what this again tells me is that he's not using things like stops. And it seems like what I'm
5609.44s: seeing so far is him basing his options exits, not based on some sort of profit target for the
5618.16s: option, but based on time. That's what it looks like to me. Because if you had some sort of profit
5624.08s: target for your option, you would follow the value of the option and capture it when it's at
5632.16s: its zenith because options decay. Vladimir says maybe he likes to stock and doesn't sweat the value.
5638.96s: I don't disagree with you, but what I'm identifying here, though, is a methodology for using
5645.52s: options because the problem with options is that they do decay. So when I look at a 10 call,
5654.96s: even though these are slightly in the money, they still will decay. That's the tricky part when
5662.24s: you trade options is it's not just a function of if you like something, it goes up. Like that's part
5668.88s: of it. But even if you're correct, these will decay. So let's I mean, we literally can take a
5675.28s: quick look at it together just out of curiosity. That's what we're here for. So let's fast forward
5680.08s: time here and let's go to 5.0 of 2020. And at this point,
5692.24s: game stop should have been trading. Yep. So it's showing right about where he saw it. Last price on
5703.36s: his was 1145. This has like 1138. That's good. So now let's look at this Jan, which is now 70 days out.
5712.16s: And then let's take a look at the 10, right? So if you take a look, right now it's a dollar 38
5720.08s: in Shrenzig value. And again, quick options 101 to figure out in Shrenzig value for a call,
5725.84s: we just take the last price and the strike price out of it. So in this case, last price is 1138.
5732.56s: You take the 10 strike out. So that gives us a dollar 38. That tells me my in Shrenzig value out of
5740.16s: this. So the mid price here, we can use whatever he was quoted at.
5744.40s: So he was quoted at 340. So we need 340 minus 138, 340 minus 138. And he has a thousand of these.
5758.32s: And then their option. So there's another hundred. So right now in time value, he has 202,000
5767.12s: dollars. Even though this stock is doing exactly what he wants and it's going up. And he's losing,
5777.44s: he has the total value at risk for time value is over 200,000 dollars. So whether or not we like
5785.28s: GameStop to the upside or whatever the case is, that's part of the equation obviously. But you're
5790.40s: still holding a decaying tool options decay rather quickly. So even though his are like right at
5798.48s: the money, they're actually going to be close to the height of their theta decay curve. So now what
5804.96s: I'm very carefully honing in on is when does he start managing these 15 Jan options? Because again,
5812.80s: I can tell you based on price movement so far, it's not predicated on a price target. Clearly.
5820.40s: He's just trading it to the upside. So then it leads me to believe that he's trading it based on
5825.68s: time, which is fascinating. So we did five know. Let's go to 12 know. 12 know. Total gain, 957,
5840.72s: 827 dot 31 cash. Willie says to generate on the surface level, but solid options trade around
5851.36s: the inside. I mean, I really don't know. I really don't know if I would say that personally.
5860.32s: Like based on what I'm seeing here, this isn't bad, but it's really not good. So it's it's hard
5866.88s: to say. It's really, really hard to say because what I can tell you is that his most recent
5871.36s: options trades have a very different field than what I'm seeing here. It's actually remarkable
5877.44s: to see the difference because in this example, if his thesis for whatever reason didn't play out,
5884.56s: this is like again, it's as he says, it's a true yolo. If his thesis wasn't fortunate enough
5892.32s: to play out, what you get in part is luck. Part of it is absolutely good luck. Now it's obviously
5898.96s: a ton of research and it's doing the homework and it's having a good ideas. I'm not
5902.64s: discounting his effort, but you still need luck for it to do what you want in your time frame.
5909.04s: And the stuff that he's trading absolutely require a massively healthy dose of luck is what it is.
5917.92s: So that gives us a 12-no. Let's get to 19-nove.
5923.84s: See no change here.
5927.36s: Hey, Mel, while you're here, actually, could you grab me another one of these?
5937.12s: Mel was stopping by because I talked too loud. I told you he was there already.
5941.52s: I already forgot the date that we're looking at, which is 19-nove.
5945.68s: Come on. 19-nove. 19-nove. Okay, TG is 1184-127.31.
5959.52s: Ash 250-579.6. No change. And then
5976.64s: we got, we had to get a mango reload. It's like absolutely critical to the operation.
5988.72s: I was drinking the mango orange seltzer water, which is good, but it's not ideal. Okay, value.
5994.16s: 157-4679.6. No change. We're good.
6007.52s: Well, Rowan Titi says he's also doing this because of the buybacks RC buying in, console, all those
6012.08s: things. Yeah, I think you're absolutely cracked. And again, we can validate the thesis, right? It's
6016.64s: actually really, really easy for us to see what his thoughts were. We can straight up take a
6021.60s: look at these same time frames. That's kind of the nice part about being able to line these up.
6025.84s: So for the group, is there a specific time frame in here that we're most interested in seeing
6031.44s: what his thoughts were at that time? Because if so, we'll just jump into one of those videos really
6037.36s: fast. And then we can see what he was thinking. Rhinow says he was a financial and economic genius.
6046.08s: He knew in his heart of hearts that GME was going to go up a bit. I don't think he saw 480 coming.
6050.80s: Yeah, I mean, and again, like, it's really important to always remind ourselves that genius and
6057.60s: crazy are essentially the same thing. And the what differentiates them is the outcome, right? Because
6064.96s: if for whatever reason, GameStop went down another path like so many other stocks and this didn't
6070.88s: happen, then it would be a complete different story. We wouldn't be spending any time looking at
6076.64s: this because he would have been yet another blown up trader. But what we're what we have to be
6081.84s: really, really careful when we evaluate stuff like this is again, it's survivorship bias.
6088.72s: We're seeing somebody that was able to very, very, very effectively apply an incredible skill set.
6097.04s: And again, lining up with a healthy dose of good fortune and luck with the performance of things.
6104.32s: And it led to obviously the outcome that we saw. But it's 100% survivorship bias because for
6113.44s: everyone, it's literally like winning the lottery. For everyone, Rorin Kitty, who happened to
6120.08s: identify this stock that he was interested in, do the homework and then go in and size up massively,
6126.56s: like all of those things together lead to an incredible, an incredible lining up of events.
6134.96s: Cedric says, now this is not that outlier. If you looked at fair value of the company before and
6139.20s: after his options, you would understand the business double their so unfair fair value. Yeah,
6143.44s: no, no, I agree with you. I'm saying the research is good. But again, I think you guys, at least in
6149.12s: this context, I think it's really important to understand the broader effect. So for example,
6158.96s: GameStop, it could have done what Wells Fargo's, what Wells Fargo did. As GameStop was pivoting as
6166.48s: they were growing in value, they could have been involved in some sort of scandal. Easy, they could
6172.64s: have Wells Fargo did. They could have done an SBB style thing, not manage their risk appropriately.
6179.12s: They could have had a terrible investment into a brand new venture that didn't make sense.
6183.92s: So like, again, the value that he perceived is there and it makes sense. But there is a massive
6190.64s: amount of good fortune that goes into something moving along as it happens to move along.
6197.68s: And that's just from a very, very specific circumstance talking about the individual stock.
6204.64s: This doesn't talk about our broader economic condition and the fact that we happened to not go
6211.44s: into some sort of broad economic recession. There happened not to have been World War III during
6218.32s: this that led to the stock market in and of itself collapsing or even imploding. So that happened to
6225.84s: not happen when a global pandemic launched and started leaving to essentially countries closing
6233.44s: down for prolonged periods of time. All I'm highlighting is that it was excellent research.
6241.84s: In excellent thesis, it was traded excellently. Despite all of those pieces of excellence,
6252.24s: there is still luck. There will always be luck to a degree. Now, as you increase your skill set,
6261.68s: you'll find that fortune seems to smile upon you more frequently. But there still is luck.
6269.60s: And it's important to know that there's luck.
6272.24s: So yeah, anyways, it's so I think somebody said like a specific time frame.
6280.48s: Steven Sealgall, that's what a great name. Steven Sealgall says October 2020, I think,
6286.72s: when Burry sold his position, let's go there.
6293.04s: 2020 is what four years ago.
6295.28s: Four years ago.
6301.04s: Here?
6303.12s: This is when he entered. Wait, Steven Sealgall, do we mean here where he entered for
6314.96s: for calling or oh, no, you said Burry, my bad.
6320.40s: Burry, Burry, Burry, Burry. Here?
6327.68s: Is this where Burry sold you guys think?
6333.92s: Seatrix says, but if you take a trade with 30% chance of hitting over 60% by DD, I don't call it luck.
6340.48s: No, it's called expected return. But the problem that you're mistaken,
6346.32s: Cedric with your analysis, which is exactly what Robo is highlighting,
6353.04s: is the problem with having a possibility of a 100% loss on a 30%, 60% thing is still
6362.48s: negatively expectant long term. So it still is luck, it's complete luck in that instance.
6369.04s: Again, this is the confusion. When we're trading or investing, we're trying to create a higher
6374.72s: probabilistic outcome. But when you tie that with total concentration of entire net worth or
6382.00s: at least investible capital, you are one bad hand away from being eviscerated. So again,
6390.08s: for the person that's at the poker table, Robo, the equivalent is to get your hand and then go
6397.68s: all in when you find a decent hand after seeing your first two cards.
6402.16s: So it's just completely, completely different. And that's why at least me, I take a very
6409.36s: probabilistic approach to trading, but it's why I've never seen the returns that he has,
6414.64s: is because I think about it in the context of path of returns. So yeah, it's a fascinating
6422.88s: scenario. And that's really where the luck in this scenario came in. Because I agree with you,
6426.56s: his due diligence was fantastic. And he was very convicted. And I can tell that he absolutely does
6433.52s: a ton of homework. It's a great thesis. But it's still just one randomness thing away from
6440.08s: happened to have not worked for whatever reason. Unfortunately, thankfully it didn't happen.
6445.36s: But I mean, like if we look at his portfolio, literally all of his money is in this one thing.
6451.20s: It's crazy. And it's what makes it so special, in my opinion, is because of this.
6462.64s: Okay, so just a double check, is there a specific time frame in here with his movements
6468.96s: that we wanted to validate? Because in here, there's been no change,
6472.56s: essentially from back here. So then we can continue down this, I think, until we find a change
6481.68s: that we want to investigate what his thoughts were about it. Unless again, if there's one of the
6488.56s: things in here that we want to investigate, because that's why I would watch the video, or at least
6491.76s: comb through it, is to see if there's any inclination or any hint as to what his thoughts were.
6502.48s: Ryan O'Siss, he had over 50 stocks in his portfolio until that it's the Warren Buffett idea,
6509.44s: not swinging at bad pitches until the white one presents itself to Keith. This was the right
6513.36s: pitch. Yeah, definitely. You could tell. And it was something that he was purely convicted in.
6517.76s: It was a 100% convicted yellow. It's the only reason why you would concentrate to this degree.
6526.40s: So yeah, completely agree there. 19, no, all right, 25, no, 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay, so this does look like we
6534.96s: see change, and it looks like we see change in his options position. Because the variance here now
6549.20s: is one of these options is gone. The 17s are gone. So here, this is 25, no,
6560.48s: damn it. I keep clicking the wrong thing. That's fascinating. Why the 17s? Why the 17s?
6567.04s: We're going to have to figure that out next. Man, this is so.
6569.36s: 5, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 1, 2, 3,
6576.40s: 10, 10, 5, 9, 3, 5, 4. Total 2, 3, 0, 1, 0, 9, 3, go up 5, 4. Okay.
6593.28s: So money also moved again. Fascinating.
6596.64s: So one of the things, one of the things that I can see is that he's, he missed an options trade,
6611.60s: meaning he moved something. Vladimir says his cost basis dropped about 15k. Yeah, it's because
6616.72s: he lost his options play. We can see that clear as day, right? So down here in his last position,
6623.36s: he still had 15, Jan 21, 17s. He still had those, but he got rid of them.
6629.36s: It's 25, no, I'm, this is fascinating. This is absolutely fascinating. Because I think we're starting to see
6644.56s: how he unwinds his trades, which again, it looks like it's based on time. So exited
6650.16s: 15, Jan 21, 17 calls. So now I want to see what he does with the remainder of these. My guess is
6665.28s: he's going to start moving them. Now what I don't understand is why the 17s? Because tens make sense,
6675.84s: they're in the money. 15s make sense. They're at the money. 20s, I don't understand why the 20s
6683.04s: are the 17s, like how he picked between those. So let's see, the total gain here was 185, 223. Let's go
6693.52s: back. Total gain here, 130. Don't understand that choice. So he exited the 15, Jan 17 calls,
6713.44s: and then I'm going to put, he kept the 20s, he kept the tens or the 15s and the tens.
6731.52s: Very, very interesting. No change to shares. Very cool.
6744.40s: So cash went up by 260K. I'm assuming that's the proceeds from the 17s.
6753.92s: I can't peg. I can't peg what happened. Why the 17s are not the 20s.
6766.08s: The cost basis on the 17s was 15 cents.
6774.16s: Man, that's really interesting.
6782.16s: Okay, so now my guess is that we're going to see more changes. That would be my natural inference.
6787.28s: So this is, what's the DTE here? 25 know 15, Jan, so let's do 15, Jan, 25,
6800.00s: 15, Jan, what yours is 2020, 15, Jan, 2020, the 25, no, not 25, no, 2020. And this equals,
6815.12s: equals, equals, this, oh, because it's not copying the format here. What the hell, you're
6838.96s: merely these damn dates. 15, Jan, 2020, 25, no, 20, 20, equals, this minus, oh, I'm in 80x, it's
6854.64s: 21, got 51 days. So this is 51 DTE. Okay. So we can also see that money came out
6871.76s: because this should have been 741 and it's 726.
6883.68s: Of Rapture says could it be closer, he did. Yeah, that's exactly what he did. So that's why you see
6887.68s: the cash delta elevate here. Yep. So here, it's very clear that he took those 17s down. Why he took
6899.20s: the 17s down. I really don't know. But we'll get a little more clarity as we go. 30 know.
6916.40s: Exactly, exactly as anticipated, exactly as anticipated. This makes sense. So the total gain here
6926.48s: was 195, 55, 65, 7.63. This makes so much sense now, at least in terms of identifying a behavior, 11, 00,
6941.28s: 611.49. And then the value is 316, 6211.49. So we had an expansion of 590 in cash. We had an
6961.12s: expansion of 865K total in value. What I can see here is he still has the tens and the 20s.
6979.44s: So now I understand what he's doing. He's taking down the options that are closer to the money.
6985.44s: So here he took the 15 Jan 21 and he took the 15 calls down.
6995.76s: And he kept the tens, which are in the money, which will move more dollar for dollar. And he kept
7003.76s: the 20s, which will compound. And again, the date here, expiration is 15 Jan 21. And then 30,
7021.28s: know. 20 equals this minus this 46 days 46 DTE now 46 DTE fascinating. Love this.
7038.56s: Okay, let's know now we're at D's eight.
7044.80s: And he's 20s, he's 20s.
7051.04s: And so he's just holding here. So total gain 17, 9, 3, 4, 5, 7,
7064.50s: got 6, 3, 10, 1, 1, 0, 2, 8, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 6, 2, 3, 8, 3, 8.
7082.74s: Okay.
7083.38s: So no change. He still has still holding Jan 15 Jan 21. He's still holding the tens, 20s.
7105.06s: And this is now eight D's, eight D's, 20. This is now 38 DTE. So he started exiting his two others at 51 and 46.
7125.70s: And then here he's holding the same expiration 15 Jan 21, 38 DTE.
7135.14s: Okay.
7139.94s: The ninth, 90s, DGE is 10, 39 15, 7, 63, ash, 11, 02, 8, 3, 8, 3, 8,
7160.74s: value 2251, 938.38.
7170.58s: 2251, 938, 180, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9, 150.
7189.86s: All the same options. No change.
7196.42s: That's a hold across the board. Same, same story here. So he's still holding those.
7207.46s: Now it's 37 DTE. Same.
7210.82s: Roy and Titi says maybe he's paying for additional assurances as the count is over 250K. I doubt he would do that.
7225.46s: I mean, most of us that have, I don't do that. And I have definitely quite a bit more than that.
7231.78s: Yeah, I don't think he would be doing that either. It's just so inefficient. FDIC is really
7241.30s: disaster protection at the point where if there's some sort of large bank failure, if you feel the
7247.06s: need to do that, what you would do much more efficiently is just split your capital out, move it
7252.82s: into multiple banks. But most of us don't try to hedge, like as soon as you're over 250, it would be
7259.30s: unreasonable. Vladimir says anyone can open a Roth or IRA as long as you have earned income.
7275.62s: Well, I'm pretty sure you can still open an IRA account.
7289.30s: Yeah, I think
7305.62s: Rapsha says I used to work at a bank. You can walk in and open a Roth or traditional. Yeah, I think
7310.90s: it's whether or not you can open it is one thing, which again, I'm pretty sure you can.
7317.70s: It's what tax advantages are provided to you. So you can still open an IRA if you're so inclined
7326.02s: or a Roth IRA and you can put money into it. But if you don't have earned income, then you won't
7333.86s: be able to deduct it because you don't have earned income to deduct. But it doesn't mean you can't
7338.58s: open it. It's like the same thing with like when you're priced out of a Roth IRA, I've been priced
7344.26s: out of a Roth IRA forever now. But you can still contribute to a Roth IRA in a few different ways.
7350.42s: One of the ways you could do it is through a backdoor contribution, which is it sounds real sketchy,
7354.74s: but it's not. It's a really well-known pattern. And there's just certain documents you have to file
7360.82s: informs to file, but it's accepted. It's nothing nefarious. And then the other thing is
7367.30s: like you can still contribute to a Roth if you're so inclined, but you just don't get any tax
7372.50s: benefit from doing so. So once you max it out, you can definitely go beyond the standard max. And
7379.46s: you can also add more to it beyond that. You're just not getting any sort of tax benefit at that point.
7387.46s: Vladimir says you can't deduct for contributions to a Roth that's after tax. Yeah, sorry. I was
7391.94s: talking about IRAs in general, but yeah, obviously the difference between a standard or traditional
7398.90s: IRA and Roth is the tax treatment traditional being you'll be taxed. You'll essentially
7406.98s: have your income tax deferred and then your taxed on the back end, Roth, it's the inverse. You get
7413.14s: taxed up front and then it's taxed deferred on the back end, which is why people get priced out of
7418.58s: Roth super fast, which is super, super annoying because Roth is more appealing to most of us for a
7427.38s: lot of different reasons, but they make it really annoying to maintain exposure to them.
7437.30s: So yeah, I don't think going back to the original though with what we're looking at here,
7443.86s: I don't think that he's like paying for insurance or anything on these or on his portfolio yet.
7450.18s: All right, so we're caught up here. Let's go to the next.
7457.06s: 17 D's. The other thing I notice is that you can tell that he likes the attention and that's
7463.94s: not digging out him, but that's why he's posting so frequently and you can tell that's why he starts
7469.14s: to slow down, which is actually really, really fun. I like that he enjoys, you know, like the game
7475.14s: he's playing and being part of the community and stuff. He's not shying away from the attention
7480.02s: he gets from doing this, which is super cool. 1102. 857.63. Ash 1105.069.48. Value 2317.869.44.
7505.06s: 8. This looks like it matches up. I'm guessing this is a rounding error.
7520.74s: Oh no, it's not. Wait. Why doesn't this match look completely correct?
7535.30s: I'm super confused. 659.3110. That's the same. It's literally the exact same. I even added a bunch
7545.86s: of decimal points. I don't, I have no idea what the difference is between these. These look
7552.98s: completely fine. I'm just going to label as a rounding discrepancy.
7561.46s: And he's still holding all of his options. And now we're at 14d20, 32dte. So the reason I'm
7574.50s: tracking the dte's now is I want to see when does he choose to start managing this a little
7583.54s: bit differently. Also, I need to turn my air back on my office. It normally turns off at like seven.
7599.86s: But since I'm in here with the door closed, it'll be spicy. Okay. So now we have 22d's.
7607.54s: No change in positions. This is fascinating. So now the main thing I'm curious about is when does he choose?
7622.02s: When does he choose to take these positions down? So I don't think he's going to wait till the last
7628.66s: second. Cash is 116, 7, 9, 6.64. Value is 34.05, 396.64. I messed something up. What did I mess up?
7652.34s: Hmm. The cash. It missed a one easy to do. Really easy to do when you're playing with this many numbers.
7665.62s: So here, and he's still holding. And now it's 22d's.
7673.54s: 22d's 20. So it's 24d to eat. This is like getting this is getting close to one I would expect these to
7684.58s: be managed. Now for the tens, they're going to be so far in the money that he probably doesn't care
7691.86s: about the extrinsic value. We can take a look at those. So today is 22d's.
7697.78s: Here. And the tens are going to be so buried that the amount of extrinsic value that's decaying on
7707.94s: those will be probably insignificant. But on the 20s, it's going to be actually very significant.
7720.58s: So I'm really curious to see what those values are.
7727.70s: Okay. So the tens, yeah, they have like no no value left. So let's just call it 19 minus 10.
7737.54s: It gives us nine. And these are at. Call it 892 minus. Yeah. So these essentially are like a one
7748.02s: delta. Yeah, there's like no time value left in these at all. So that's why it doesn't care about
7754.50s: those. But the 20s are all time value. And they're at the peak of their theta decay curve.
7762.42s: This is when theta decay is actually really, really, really, really pronounced. So you can see on
7767.86s: these 20s, he's losing five cents a day. So if you take five dollars times his 1000 contracts that
7778.50s: he has, he's literally losing five grand a day by holding these. And it's because we are in the
7785.78s: most pronounced phase of this. Stories of Opacity says the backwards account dropped another meme.
7797.14s: I think it's RK and it's his all personality account is Tiffy. That's funny. I've seen a lot of
7802.66s: back and forth on that. I don't personally believe that yet. But I would defer to you guys mostly
7808.42s: to be honest. You guys probably would know better than me.
7814.26s: Yeah, let's finish through December. And then we'll probably take a pause. So this is 25 Ds
7821.30s: because I just want to go through some of the recent price action before we wrap up.
7826.58s: And I'm actually going to call it here. Let's just call it at 22 Ds. We'll leave it at that.
7833.22s: And I'm going to add a note that that's where we left off.
7846.10s: We'll do RK grades. We'll keep an eyeball on it. So I want to talk about some of the other stuff
7853.62s: because there was a few questions that I got that I don't want to not have a chance to get through.
7859.54s: And obviously his old trades are going to be there.
7864.58s: And all right. So one of the things that we talked about way in the beginning, it was I think one
7870.42s: of the first questions somebody dropped in here was about these 5,000 block that we continue to see
7878.98s: in GameStop, flown through the dark pool. So if you go to GME. And if we limit this by 5,000
7886.82s: and we limit this by 5,000, I didn't need the tin foil literally this entire session.
7892.42s: That's kind of crazy. I was expecting to get into way more tin foil stuff. Maybe that's what we'll do
7897.70s: when we get to the to the meme thing. Maybe that will be where we need the tin foil for.
7902.98s: So we've honestly this has all been like standard data analysis, which I love doing. But it's like
7909.06s: part of these sessions is supposed to be getting really weird. Okay, so let's take a look.
7916.74s: 913.
7923.30s: There's let's count how many are on this.
7929.38s: Rhino says that 5K is most likely institutions and a dark pool to not affect the tape that's not
7934.34s: A.K. legal shit. It's not true. So Rhino, I think it's really, really, really important to again,
7942.90s: understand the way that the markets behave. One, dark pools are not illegal.
7947.94s: Two, more importantly, dark pool prints still hit the consolidated tape. They're just delayed
7956.42s: typically by a few seconds. Maybe a few minutes. That's an extreme scenario, typically not the case.
7962.74s: Dark pool trades still hit the consolidated tape. They still hit volume that goes through the day.
7969.94s: They still hit stock price that goes through the day. The things that do not hit the consolidated
7976.26s: tape impacting volume stock price are internalized orders or an internalized order. You won't see them.
7985.38s: So those are the kinds of orders that we will not see an impact because we have no idea.
7991.38s: Cedric says even our K can use a dark pool. Absolutely. We can all access the dark pool.
7995.54s: The other thing is it's up to the broker on the way that they choose to route your order or
8000.66s: the market maker. So if I'm buying shares of GameStop and it happens to go through a market maker
8005.54s: who happens to decide to route my personal order through the dark pool, that's where it'll go.
8011.30s: So dark pools are accessible. So anyways, one of the questions
8019.62s: that we had is like, let's go back into May. Kind of like this pre-squeeze time frame.
8033.54s: And see what kind of 5,000 blocks we saw. If we saw 5,000 blocks. I haven't done this yet.
8039.86s: So I have no idea what this is going to show us.
8041.86s: C. Gillian says do you think it's been DFV buying the 5,000 blocks in the dark pool this week?
8053.62s: There are over 100. There's a lot of them actually. And there's I covered a couple of them actually
8061.78s: in the last few like daily video updates that I did. But the fact.
8067.30s: The fact of the matter is I don't know.
8077.62s: Yeah. I think I, man, so this is like just not loading. Maybe I'll try like a smaller time frame.
8087.30s: Maybe we'll just do like May like a week or two. And let's get rid of these.
8092.90s: So it looks like there's none. Yeah. Okay. So there's none. When did the squeeze start in May?
8102.58s: Dr. Zay says does anyone remember the origin of how 5,000 blocks? It's just from when he
8107.94s: was buying options, which is that that's another funny thing that I see is that people assimilate
8114.50s: like 5,000 blocks shares. But he was buying 5,000 blocks of options, which is completely different.
8122.82s: And the reason why options matters because 5,000 lots in the options world is a big trade.
8130.58s: In the share world, it's small. It's insignificant. But in the options world, those kinds of
8136.82s: positions are larger. So the reason why he was used, and it wasn't just 5,000 blocks that he was
8143.06s: using, by the way, it's definitely more than that. He just happened to settle on that number to
8147.38s: start scaling into his position for a few of them. But he had other sizes too.
8153.06s: So anyways, as we go through here, let's do cap it at 5,000.
8163.54s: So there's no, well, that doesn't make sense. Because I saw,
8171.78s: yes, all like a 50, okay, so maybe we'll cap it at like 5,500.
8175.86s: Okay. So we can see that there's a handful here. So let's do the rest of May like this.
8187.14s: And then let's limit this by 5,000 now and see if we can, there we go.
8193.54s: And then let's change this to 5,000. There we go.
8198.50s: So in the 31st of May, there is a bunch of these blocks.
8205.94s: Well, Rhinoces 512 is when he came back cool. So then we'll just do, we'll do like,
8212.58s: here to here.
8218.10s: 17th, I'm going to zoom this in then because it's going to be
8223.30s: too much, I think. Zero. So leading into his return,
8230.82s: from all of May, there was nothing at 5,000 blocks.
8239.46s: So then let's go back and look at April really quick. Nothing at 5,000.
8253.70s: So yeah, doesn't look like, doesn't look like there's anything tying that,
8259.14s: which is also really, really interesting actually. Because here's the other thing that I find very
8266.82s: curious. And again, maybe we can get the tinfoil hacks. It's probably coming up on time.
8275.06s: The roaring kitty.
8280.58s: So if we take a look at this,
8282.34s: in updated 13G, if he got out of Chui at, well, let's just call it 6ep because he's running out of time.
8295.30s: If he got out of Chui at or before this date, he owes an update in 13G within 10 days.
8307.70s: Or the whatever point in time that he drops below 5% ownership.
8318.90s: So here's the other problem with this is when we look at this, we could say he is doing this
8327.30s: preemptively and to indicate that he might be putting down Chui or not, we don't know.
8331.94s: But it's the point where his ownership drops below 5%.
8342.58s: So he could have opted to start unwinding his position earlier.
8350.02s: And then he could have eventually crossed that threshold or not crossed that threshold.
8356.74s: So HockeyNuts says, is it 10 days or 10 trading days? That's a great clarifying question.
8362.42s: Let's double check. For amended 13G SEC filings, is it calendar or trading days?
8375.14s: Calender days.
8397.86s: Interesting.
8398.98s: So this says for amended 13G SEC filings, the deadlines are based on calendar days.
8412.58s: In amended 13G must be filed within 45 calendar days at the end of the calendar year.
8420.34s: If there is changes in the information previously reported,
8425.62s: if the amendment reflects a change in ownership exceeding 10% or more, it must be filed within
8432.74s: 10 calendar days after the end of the month in which the change occurred.
8443.86s: Very interesting. So this looks like there's a fucking giant window here.
8452.98s: 45 calendar days after the end of the calendar year.
8460.66s: So this means essentially he has until the end of 2024 and then 45 calendar days into 2025
8470.66s: to file the amended 13G. That's what that means.
8478.34s: And then I'm going to go to the SEC and check it directly there.
8480.82s: Actually, I'm going to ask chat GPT for a source so that we can look at it for ourselves.
8484.90s: Because I've learned not to trust chat GPT much at all.
8504.90s: I want to see the site.
8511.70s: Yeah, so beneficial ownership exceeding 10% filings must be made within five business days.
8517.14s: So this is different than what it says up above.
8520.90s: This is the problem with chat GPT. I need to go to SEC 13G filing rules.
8529.30s: We just need to go
8531.94s: great to the source. We'll grab this one because they'll probably make it easier to read.
8537.30s: And then we'll probably look at this one, which is going to be terrible to read, but it will be fine.
8544.26s: Those are literally two different. I want to like chat GPT so much, but I just don't trust it.
8549.94s: I guess the other thing I
8553.14s: what is this?
8556.66s: The shareholder owns over 5% corporations form 10 registering.
8562.82s: Hold month period from the acquisition of the time was privately held.
8570.66s: Shareholder acquired access of 10% of a class of equity securities prior to the registration.
8579.46s: Any shareholders so exempt from filing 13D, 13G within 45 days after the end of the calendar year,
8587.30s: which in exchange act registrate. So I got a double check.
8592.34s: Is Keith Gil 13?
8600.02s: Was it a 13G? Some pretty sure it was a 13G. It is a 13.
8606.34s: So we can see 13G. We can also confirm that he's not a cat.
8613.78s: And it's based on rule 13D1C.
8618.26s: So I'm actually going to...
8632.58s: Let me see.
8636.82s: This is rule 13D1C.
8652.58s: 13D1A.
8655.30s: 13D1C.
8657.06s: A bank converted to a holding company structure,
8663.86s: a 5% shareholder who had been filing the equivalent of a schedule 13G with the comptroller.
8674.58s: currency received 5% of the holding company's stock in a one-for-one exchange,
8682.58s: but after the stock had been registered,
8686.50s: what the fuck?
8693.54s: This doesn't feel like the right thing.
8698.34s: This doesn't feel like the right thing at all.
8702.50s: So let's see.
8703.62s: What is SEC rule 13D-1C for a schedule 13G filing?
8720.18s: Let's see what this says.
8727.22s: Okay. So 13D1C governs section 13 filings for passive investors, which that's the differentiation.
8738.18s: Passive investor is an entity or individual that owns more than 5% of a company's stock,
8742.02s: but does not seek to influence or control the company. I think we knew that.
8745.38s: These investors typically hold securities for investment purposes only. I think we know that.
8749.70s: So initial filing, a passive investor must file schedule 13G within 10 calendar days
8756.58s: after acquiring more than 5% of the company's stock. I think we know that.
8764.18s: If the investor's ownership exceeds 10%, or there is a material change,
8772.50s: ownership increasing or decreasing by more than 5%, that's an important note.
8779.78s: The investor must file an amended 13G within two business days.
8789.30s: That's interesting.
8790.74s: Let's do the required only for these.
8805.46s: And let's get rid of this one, which looks like what I don't want to look at.
8810.74s: So this is really interesting, because one of the things I'm highlighting from here is
8817.62s: ownership increasing or decreasing by more than 5%. So if that is the case,
8824.74s: if he has a 6% stake, he can sell 4% in 0.0.
8831.86s: So knowing him at least as loosely as I do, it would not surprise me in the least if he
8841.94s: posted this with everybody thinking that he's going to drop Chui entirely.
8846.82s: And there might be nothing about it, because he might not move by 5%. He doesn't have to.
8854.26s: He can unlock the majority of his capital by unwinding 4.5% potentially. If he does any, which is kind of
8863.14s: funny.
8872.42s: Interesting. Okay.
8875.06s: Record investor, an investor with control intent, file schedule 13D, 13G for passive.
8886.90s: What is this from?
8890.42s: This doesn't tell me.
8894.74s: Let's see.
8895.54s: So this says 13G, the amendments shortened the initial filing deadline from 45 after the
8905.22s: us. So that's why we're seeing that 45 after the calendar year. So that's just old information.
8911.30s: This is why I like GameStop so much is because I'm learning random filing regulations that I
8919.30s: otherwise would never be aware of. I would never have a reason to look at this shit.
8923.70s: So this is hilarious. Okay. So it says it shortened the initial filing 10 to 5. And this one says it
8934.26s: shortens from 45 days after the end of the calendar year to 45 days at the end of the calendar quarter.
8942.90s: Uh-huh. Where other schedule 13G filers passive investors, the amendments shortened the initial
8953.62s: filing deadline from 10 days to 5 business days. Business days. In addition for all schedule 13G
8964.34s: filers, the amendments generally require that an amendment to be filed 45 days after the calendar
8970.26s: quarter, which a material change occurred rather than 45 days of the calendar year.
8975.70s: Interesting. Amendments accelerate 13G. Okay. Interesting.
8987.30s: So then this, their election matters. So if they're a G that's 13D1C,
9000.42s: uh, all 13G's be amended within 45 days after the end of the calendar quarter,
9008.50s: in which any material change occurred under the current rules except certain situations they have
9014.18s: 45 days at the calendar year. So this one is this from 9,724. So this seems like really, really,
9024.02s: yeah, this is about as recent as it gets. And this looks like, oh, wow. So this is actually
9030.58s: going to start soon 30,724. So there's even a bigger change here.
9039.54s: Really, really interesting. So that's going to accelerate it even more. So we can see what it's
9046.90s: going from in two. So yeah, this will catch him then if there's a change.
9057.94s: Fascinating. Pam says, I don't think RK likes RC so much. Oh, interesting. I wonder why.
9069.62s: Yeah, I don't know. I haven't really spent a whole lot of time thinking about like
9074.18s: the perception of that relationship and stuff. But I don't, I don't see why, especially like if he
9084.26s: stays associated with GameStop, if you think about it, like GameStop right now is essentially Cohen.
9095.14s: Right. That's that's where all the values coming from. And it looks like based on his previous work,
9100.26s: it seems like he really liked Cohen. Right. Like he talks about him actually quite a lot.
9107.86s: So I don't, I don't see him not liking Cohen. I think one of the problems is at least what I can
9115.46s: tell from the ape community is it seems like the apes believe that Cohen should prioritize a squeeze.
9125.30s: And I don't think that that's what Cohen is or should prioritize. I know that that might
9133.14s: upset some of the apes, but that like that is what it is. A squeeze does not benefit the company
9140.10s: to a significant degree. Now it can help. I'm not saying it's detrimental. But what I'm saying is
9145.46s: the focus for a company and a CEO of a company should be literally, hold on, I'm getting
9154.90s: hit up. They're confused. It should be the operation of the company.
9163.86s: So yeah. I think for what I can tell from the apes is that the apes seem to be obviously like laser
9177.54s: focused on this giant squeeze, which I understand. But from a CEO perspective, a squeeze is not like,
9186.50s: a squeeze is short lived, right? Like that's only a thing that happens and then will go away
9192.42s: shortly thereafter. So then it's a function of how do I operate a company profitably and grow it?
9199.86s: So I think from Cohen's perspective that is and should be his focus is growing the company.
9210.18s: C Gillian says, do you think RC and or DFV are involved in the BBY GME merger acquisition?
9216.26s: I don't know shit about that. I haven't seen anything concrete about a BBY slash GME merger acquisition.
9228.66s: And I have absolutely no clue. I have absolutely no clue why RC or DFV would be involved.
9239.38s: Yeah. I don't I don't follow that. I mean, if there's information about it, I would be happy
9255.22s: to look at it. I think one of the things that I'm noticing is from a lot of people they're looking at
9261.38s: like GameStop and they're starting to look at like all these acquisitions with other meme stocks.
9267.38s: And like it doesn't it doesn't really line up that well, not saying it couldn't happen.
9273.06s: But I think like the process for what they choose to get into would be a little more calculated than that is all.
9283.30s: C Gillian says you should look into it. Your mind will be blown. Maybe. Yeah, maybe it will be.
9290.10s: But
9298.42s: Willie says, but the initial thesis has always been on a squeezable event. Well, that's for I think
9302.82s: well, I think for GameStop, the initial thesis has always been value, right? Like even before any
9308.10s: of these things about a squeeze came out, he's talking about the value of the stock. So I think that
9313.62s: that was his original his original thesis. But yeah, the BBB why stuff I don't actually fully
9323.62s: understand the the allure to it, to be honest, because I know it has an interesting story.
9331.78s: I guess maybe because it's like super, super cheap. Is that why? What's the trading it now? BBB why?
9348.98s: Or what what is this?
9360.34s: Here we go.
9364.74s: So this one away in May of 23 at seven cents.
9373.62s: So yeah, I mean, this hasn't been around for a hot minute.
9386.90s: Roentit he says RC bought up 10% retail stock or follow them then RC dumped. I actually don't
9393.46s: think that that's the I don't think that that's what happened with Cohen on BBB why at least
9400.34s: based on what I understand on his involvement with it. It looks like he had other ideas in mind,
9405.94s: but then there was some other things that popped up that essentially derailed the plan. But I
9412.10s: don't think that he actually went to like dump on retail. I think that's essentially how the timing
9420.82s: went through. Blanc Swayze says why did GME wait with their first at the market for five months
9433.38s: hitting in really high and did not cash in before. I think it's really specific. I think that
9443.46s: from what I've seen so far with GameStop with their at the markets, they have very, very,
9448.90s: specific timing that they leverage. And I know that they got approval for a massive offering.
9456.66s: So there's still tons and tons left to go if they are so inclined with the existing offering.
9464.58s: So yeah, I think when I look at their approach so far, it seems like it's really focused on
9472.50s: trying to, I can't see, I know there's something, but I can't see like what their end vision is in mind.
9482.50s: And the reason for that is because it seems like at least to me, it seems like at this point,
9490.66s: we would have some sort of clue as to what the overall idea is here, but I don't really feel like
9496.90s: we do.
9499.78s: Roindtitty says he dumped. I'm not saying he did a profit off retail, but he dumped. I'm saying
9504.10s: retail stocked his investment jumped in. Oh, yeah, sure. I think that that would be
9507.78s: totally fine. Because yeah, you're absolutely correct. Like he exited the position. It's just
9513.14s: the connotation, right? Like when somebody says something like the term dump, there's a very
9517.78s: specific connotation is compared to, you know, like exit leave. But yeah, if it's just saying that
9525.30s: he left a position, then yeah, for sure, completely agree. But Roindtitty says, but retail is
9531.06s: mad at him for that. Well, retail and what I find in general is like humans are just going to be
9535.86s: angry at somebody for something. It's just how they are, man. Like people get pissed at me. I get
9541.14s: hate mail from the way that I talk about GameStop. I get hate mail for literally everything. So
9548.42s: it's like, yeah, people are just fucking silly and like to be angry about stuff. And they look
9555.14s: for scapegoats because most people struggle to look at themselves and identify their part of
9562.18s: something or their reaction to something and they look for something to blame. So yeah, the fact
9568.42s: that retail traders were upset at him literally, literally not even a remote surprise to me. That
9576.42s: sounds completely par for the course because well, people are people.
9584.98s: GCA says I'm angry and offended by that. Perfect. That's what we go for here.
9590.82s: All right, gang, that wraps me up. It's time to go grab some dinner. Absolutely blast hanging out,
9595.38s: though. Let me know what we should look at in the next session. You can throw them in the comments.
9600.02s: You can hit me up on the discord or when I make the post, you can always drop anything that we
9604.82s: want to look at there. But I want to go through part three of his trades and finish going through
9610.74s: those. I literally, I'm learning a ton. The thing I want to know the most right now is when does
9615.30s: he manage those 17 Jan 21s because he's coming in. I think he's already within 30 DTE. So I want to
9622.74s: know when that goes down. But that's the top of mind for me. Obviously, I'll keep in eyeball on
9633.22s: stuff like what GME does, but it's just been, it's been very, very quiet in here. So when we're doing
9641.94s: stuff, again, like when I'm doing my daily market update videos, I still glance at GameStop and if
9648.10s: there's something at least somewhat notable, I'll obviously always bring it to your attention,
9652.18s: at least, you know, what I see, but so far, pretty quiet. So as always, blast hanging out, enjoy the
9658.74s: rest of your weekends for the outlier pro members. I'll see you on the market prep live stream tomorrow.
9663.78s: Everybody else, let's see in the discord on the next YouTube live stream. Be an outlier. I'll see you
9667.86s: guys later.
