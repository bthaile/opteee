0.68s: what's up outliers Market's closed so
2.56s: time for an
4.24s: opx market update so today I got two
7.36s: things on the agenda good old GameStop
9.76s: and then we're going to take a look at
10.68s: chewy and then for those that are
12.48s: interested later today at 5:00 P p.m.
14.64s: Pacific time we have our options trading
17.04s: for beginners live stream so today's
19.36s: kind of an open-ended day we'll cover
21.88s: whatever topics you all want to spend a
24.12s: little time diving deeper into but these
26.16s: are sessions built around and for
28.52s: beginners so this is where you can come
30.16s: ask all of those beginner questions that
32.24s: you might not feel comfortable sharing
33.56s: them somewhere else or you're just
34.76s: struggling to pick up that's what it's
36.32s: for so let's get right in today I
39.20s: actually did not love the price action
41.60s: in GameStop and the reason why I didn't
43.28s: love the price action is because
45.48s: GameStop was kind of a little bit down
48.44s: today if I zoom this in a little bit you
50.28s: can see that we opened at
52.48s: 2225 and then we closed at 2221 so
56.36s: essentially a flat day but I don't like
59.56s: that it's slightly negative there's a
62.36s: few reasons for this primarily because
65.36s: the larger burden of where we think
69.12s: interest rates are going and what small
71.08s: caps are doing was actually slightly
72.80s: lifted today and this is what I'm
75.56s: referring to right here iwm had a pretty
78.48s: big day today it was over 3% and this
80.60s: comes back from Big Daddy J palal
84.68s: hanging out with the boys at Jackson
87.08s: Hole and they're just out there talking
89.40s: their is obviously I'm joking but
91.60s: they're they're talking about inflation
93.48s: and they're starting to signal that they
95.72s: think it's about time and the reason why
98.32s: I don't appreciate the way gme behaved
102.28s: today from a price perspective I was
104.92s: hoping for more of a pop is what I'm
106.52s: getting at is because take a look at
108.28s: this this is the number of companies in
110.76s: the New York Stock Stock Exchange so a
112.68s: lot of small and midcap stocks that have
114.96s: made highs today so when I look at this
118.48s: yesterday
120.00s: net highs lows was 136 companies today
124.16s: it was 287 a massive change now the
127.72s: other thing is gross highs lows meaning
131.20s: just a raw number not net yesterday
134.28s: gross highs was 153 and today it's 293
138.24s: almost double so a lot of small cap
142.20s: stocks saw a breath of fresh a today and
144.52s: you can see that bit across this whole
146.76s: thing so really what this highlights is
149.60s: that the argument of the broader indices
153.08s: are slowing down and not helping is
155.52s: actually kind of Abad here which to some
158.92s: degree that's not bad because it means
160.76s: that we don't necessarily have a an
162.52s: additional headwind but I really really
165.32s: was hopeful that we might see a little
166.96s: bit of Life come in today and we just
169.84s: didn't really see this pop through so
173.40s: volume today again for kind of two days
176.08s: running was overwhelming sale volume and
179.52s: very light 4 million shares traded with
185.16s: I mean we're we're below the 20day
188.16s: average we're slightly above the 5day
190.40s: average which is nice just to see a
192.16s: little bit of volume picking up on a
194.52s: relative basis but it's still uh pretty
197.32s: contracted unfortunately so again it
200.12s: goes back to this thing until we start
202.00s: to see volume picking up to some degree
204.88s: this is more or less uh what I expect to
207.32s: see is kind of this sideways trending
209.44s: action
210.56s: and my expectation would be as soon as
212.52s: we start seeing some volume flow into
214.84s: this we'll start to see some price
216.96s: movement now the other positive I do
218.52s: want to highlight here although I don't
220.92s: love that we're starting to rotate over
223.56s: ever so slightly is that we have been
225.16s: range bound essentially from the 9th
228.20s: we've been trading almost straight
230.20s: sideways so one of the benefits to that
232.88s: looking on the bright side of things
234.24s: again is that even though there's decent
236.48s: sale volume it's not strong enough to
238.84s: really start pushing price down which is
240.92s: also awesome to see so a bit of a mixed
245.08s: bag I suppose I just really wanted to
246.80s: see with the broader Market lifting
248.84s: today some of that flow over into this
251.00s: but I mean that's just how it goes
252.52s: sometimes so let's take a look at the
253.96s: options chain and today we had a decent
258.04s: amount of OI bleed off so there was 574
261.20s: th000 calls and after today 100,000 of
265.04s: those are gone so we are again in this
268.48s: quieter period with respect to just
271.40s: where we're seeing options activity your
274.32s: boys keeping an eye on it as I said I
276.24s: would but there's just not a whole lot
278.28s: to keep an eye on it it's it's
279.56s: relatively slow and steady in here the
282.00s: other thing I will note yet again is
284.16s: take a look at this six step I took my
286.24s: volatility trade down today because I
288.88s: started thinking I got the move I was
290.60s: going to get and sure sure enough V
294.72s: dropped from over 80% for this
296.80s: expiration cycle down to 72 so there was
299.12s: a little bit of move there but I I took
301.68s: it down before this move because
303.00s: otherwise I mean I I would just start
305.36s: losing money on this trade at this point
307.12s: the The Vault trade I still expect that
309.00s: 72% to go up for sure but it's just
312.76s: taken its sweet time now the other thing
316.00s: I did want to see is based on the volume
317.96s: today very light and it looks like most
321.28s: of it is moving out into the next
322.96s: expiration cycle so kind of a standard
326.36s: General Behavior here for GameStop
329.16s: playing mostly on the front the front
331.32s: options and again reminder we have
333.48s: earnings coming up on the fourth
335.12s: scheduled right now for before the open
339.52s: the other thing I did was take a look
341.24s: for the whole week and I wanted to see
344.28s: in GameStop first then we look at chewy
347.08s: but looking through GameStop focusing on
348.68s: the calls and just seeing what kind of
351.52s: sizes we saw we only had two lines two
355.64s: trades composite trades this top one
358.12s: above $100,000 this one's large to be
360.80s: clear the 20 June
364.28s: 25s those were
367.04s: $364,000 trade that's not insignificant
370.20s: but I mean the other trade was for 16
372.84s: Jan 26 that was 175 so like all these
375.28s: bigger trades are pretty far out in time
377.64s: and those are the only two so just again
380.56s: another example of a pretty quiet week
383.12s: with respect to the options chain all
386.00s: right quick pikach chewy because the
388.80s: interesting thing in here is that we've
390.08s: started running sideways here as well so
393.56s: back from a quick break grab a drink of
395.44s: water actually it's a little bit of uh
398.16s: Pedialite getting your hydration on so
402.16s: in chewy they've also been really
404.48s: trending sideways I I think I already
405.96s: told you guys I had some long calls that
407.44s: I exited out uh here and it's just
410.48s: because it it just wasn't moving right
412.80s: so in here it was Ring pretty hard and
416.40s: then my guess is that it's quite likely
419.64s: to consolidate into earnings which it
421.80s: has on the
423.20s: 28th so the difference though is when I
425.92s: look at chewy is chewy options have
429.12s: actually been really busy on a relative
432.76s: basis and when I say busy I'm
435.68s: specifically highlighting look at all
437.40s: these different expirations that are in
439.48s: here whereas when we typically look at
441.64s: GameStop it's very Silo to front
445.24s: expiration second expiration as the
447.48s: front expiration is expiring and you
449.32s: know that whole bit here it continues to
452.96s: be all over the place but there's
455.60s: definitely positioning going on for
457.48s: earnings which again is on the 28th
459.88s: which will be captured here and you can
461.28s: see that there's double calls to puts so
464.40s: still relatively small 32k to 15K but
467.28s: nonetheless bullish positioning as far
468.96s: as I can see for earnings coming up and
471.76s: we can see earnings VA nice and high as
474.08s: per usual so 128% Vol which promptly
477.00s: drops down to 96%
479.72s: which again is what I expect to see for
481.04s: earnings unlike what we're seeing in
483.04s: GameStop now
485.04s: obviously before we get too far we
487.32s: actually have to go back to GameStop
488.68s: because you all know what needs to
489.60s: happen we got to pour one out for the
491.64s: homies because there is uh just a bunch
495.72s: of people again that have options that
498.16s: just expired completely worthless we can
500.60s: see for example of this
503.40s: 11,000 there was 1,700 added over
506.60s: yesterday and only 7600 traded today so
510.28s: some I'm guessing the majority of the
511.84s: 7600 would be people trying to grab
513.76s: whatever value they can but that leads
516.04s: several thousand that just expired
517.56s: worthless so shout out to the
521.20s: homies that's how she goes sometimes now
524.20s: again I continue to reiterate this point
526.96s: if you buy calls or if you buy options I
530.12s: have a video I will link to it as I
531.80s: always do on a way to do this a little
534.24s: bit better a little smarter so that
535.92s: we're not just lighting money on fire on
538.68s: a weekly basis it does not have to be
540.84s: like that so I'll throw that in the
543.44s: notes Below in case you want to check
545.12s: that out and in case you just want to
546.68s: stay playing the fronts and seeing what
548.76s: happens that's cool too whatever floats
550.24s: your boat now the last thing I'll say
552.84s: about chewy is when I look at chewy
556.32s: options activity for this past week I
558.12s: get a different I get a different View
561.08s: and it's I mean take a look at this this
563.88s: is for this entire week call side on the
567.12s: ask side and this is literally all that
569.60s: populates right and we're already down
571.36s: here to
572.44s: $27 so much smaller aggregate size and
575.96s: total trading here options chain in
578.92s: chewy is also relatively quiet at this
583.44s: time so that is the expiration week for
587.16s: here again coverage as promised but not
590.44s: a whole lot to report at this time now
592.88s: tomorrow we have our GameStop YouTube
595.04s: live stream at 5:00 P p.m. Pacific time
596.64s: this will be another solo one I'm
598.24s: chatting with Newton to see if we can
599.48s: find a time that fits with his schedule
601.28s: a little bit better in the coming weeks
602.84s: to get us back together for some of
604.40s: those kind of fun joint sessions but
607.36s: really at this point I'm still spending
609.80s: a lot of time digging into the
611.08s: background so that's the goal for
612.36s: tomorrow if there's anything you think I
613.56s: should take a look at let me know I
615.12s: would love to until next time be an
617.28s: outlier I'll see you guys later
