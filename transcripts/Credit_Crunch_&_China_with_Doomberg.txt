2.46s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
4.92s: back to another top the outlier podcast
7.56s: and today I have my favorite green
10.74s: chicken here with us our friends from
13.50s: doomberg first off welcome and thank you
16.26s: so much for joining us
17.88s: Eric great to be here and looking
19.50s: forward to a fantastic discussion yeah
22.14s: well so we got to start with uh the
24.60s: chicken in the room which is what's the
26.16s: Genesis of the chicken
27.96s: yeah sure uh the green chicken is the
30.72s: well first of all I'm the head writer of
32.58s: a small team that publishes the doomberg
34.74s: substack we launched it two years ago
37.14s: coming up here on May 3rd our two-year
39.48s: anniversary and we built this brand you
42.18s: know from scratch we had no social media
43.62s: presence whatsoever we were
45.48s: again a small team of Consultants from
47.28s: the commodity sector focused on energy
48.96s: Finance private Equity Venture Capital
51.84s: crypto and um
54.66s: we decided to get into the content
56.34s: creation business after having consulted
57.90s: in the space for about 18 months
60.60s: and um you know when you start from
62.28s: nothing you have to create something and
63.96s: and you know many of the bigger content
66.96s: creators the brand is the face is the
69.18s: person and that that was not something
70.62s: we could do because a we weren't a
72.84s: person and B we'd had no pre-existing
74.76s: social media to build from and so um we
78.18s: decided you know the old adage of
79.68s: marketing is you can't be remembered if
81.06s: you don't stand out
82.20s: and when we had our sort of initial
83.82s: brand brainstorming sessions
85.74s: um you know there's a whole market for
86.94s: sort of doomerism or Doom porn or pick
89.34s: your favorite sort of descriptor for it
91.38s: and a lot of it
93.24s: um is sort of superficial and clickbaity
95.16s: and we decided that um there was
97.14s: probably a niche in the market for a bit
99.72s: more sophisticated Doom or better
101.88s: written a little better edited a little
103.08s: better research so our homework
105.60s: um and we love our Bloomberg terminal
107.06s: and so as we were just sort of
109.08s: brainstorming doomberg sort of just came
110.70s: out of it and then the concept of
113.10s: Chicken Little getting a terminal and
114.66s: scrolling through the Bloomberg machine
116.16s: looking for headlines to be afraid of
117.84s: was one of the sort of riffs that we did
120.06s: as a team and we found this cheap clip
122.40s: art anybody can find it the green
123.84s: chicken with the stunned eyes well it's
125.58s: just a chicken with the stunned eyes and
127.08s: the clip art that we we purchased and
128.88s: then we colorized it with you know some
130.68s: of the colors from the Bloomberg
131.64s: keyboard and stuff just to just to be
133.50s: fun and um and you know we just launched
136.50s: it almost as bit of a lark and uh took
138.90s: off
139.92s: beyond our wildest dreams and when paid
142.50s: a year ago and now we're you know the
144.12s: number one paid Finance sub stack in the
145.98s: world and amongst the top on on the
149.22s: platform across all
150.78s: categories which is you know crazy
152.58s: stunning humbling life-changing
156.12s: um thrilling we've one of the things I'm
158.22s: most proud of is the team has taken the
159.96s: time to save her the success we've not
162.42s: taken it for granted we don't suffer
163.86s: from the disease of more we've achieved
166.14s: way more than enough and way more than
167.76s: our wildest dreams and we have us and
172.08s: our families have have been proactive
174.54s: and conscious about waking up every day
177.66s: and like pinching yourself and savoring
179.88s: the reality of having achieved something
183.36s: um that we're proud of that our kids are
185.28s: proud of that help support our kids and
187.86s: our families and friends and Charities
189.48s: and things that we're passionate about
191.28s: and so it's been really a remarkable
193.32s: Journey couldn't do it without our
194.58s: subscribers
195.72s: um and we are you know 100 subscribers
198.00s: supported and and every subscriber is
199.74s: precious and and so yeah it's just been
201.78s: a real world one so yeah it's it's crazy
203.70s: but yeah once you build something like
205.44s: the green chicken you can't de-automize
206.94s: like we were talking before we came on
208.44s: the air like
209.64s: um many many many people on Wall Street
212.40s: know who we are it's not a big secret
214.20s: you know right some stack knows who we
215.82s: are when we meet with substant we meet
217.32s: as ourselves stripe no so we are
219.60s: obviously for kyc AML purposes our our
222.60s: Bankers you know who help us um with the
226.50s: sort of the business aspects of things
227.94s: heard our business plan before we went
229.56s: to paid and they know who we are
231.18s: obviously and but if you de-anonymize
233.58s: you sort of destroy the brand mystique
235.02s: and so even if like
236.88s: people guessed who we were or tweeted
239.28s: who we were we would just ignore it
240.72s: because you just can't acknowledge it
241.98s: and you just um I don't want to destroy
244.14s: the you don't want to pop the green
245.40s: chicken bubble you know and it's been
246.90s: such a good ride for us that we're
248.46s: honestly in sort of protect mode like we
251.10s: wake up every day make sure we don't do
252.36s: anything wrong
253.80s: um and then just keep doing all the
255.12s: things that have worked for us and so
256.50s: that that's the story of the green
257.52s: chicken yeah it's awesome I I love it
259.98s: and a couple of following questions
261.60s: there so where was your team did you all
264.36s: like work together for like another
266.52s: project before you pivoted over to
268.20s: doomberg
269.46s: yeah we had a bespoke consulting firm
271.32s: where we catered to c-suite Executives
273.48s: and family offices and our
275.94s: sweet spot was a family office and a
278.16s: commodity space that was sort of running
279.36s: a business needed to get unstuck and
282.48s: they would bring us in and we would sort
283.80s: of think laterally and leverage our
285.96s: multiple Decades of experience in the
287.64s: commodity sector as Executives to
290.58s: um unstick you know certain businesses
292.86s: and unlock value and make money and we
295.32s: had developed a very good book of
296.34s: business and then covet hit and we lost
298.08s: 85 of it in the span of six weeks and I
301.80s: like every small business owner you know
304.02s: you have a we call it a high pucker
305.58s: Factor moment like what are we going to
306.84s: do do we go back to get a job do we
308.94s: reinvent ourselves do we fold shop and
312.42s: go our separate ways and um we decided
315.42s: to stick it out in a very famous hedge
317.22s: fund manager who I I personally had
319.50s: called to get some advice as to how we
321.00s: might go forward and how we could
322.08s: rebuild our business said you know
323.28s: there's this whole
324.90s: area of content creation that serves
327.60s: Wall Street where the content creators
330.06s: are super talented but they don't have
331.62s: your business training and and sort of
333.78s: execution and discipline expertise that
336.24s: that I've I've come to know of you and
338.52s: maybe you could build a book of business
339.90s: helping content creators run their
341.40s: businesses better and and we did that
342.72s: and we got you know very next phone call
344.94s: a high profile client that we helped a
346.62s: lot and we're still very good friends
347.70s: with one of the few clients we've kept
349.20s: But to answer your question we had a
350.88s: small consulting firm that was
352.08s: successful and covet hit then we had to
355.68s: rebuild ourselves like many small
356.82s: business owners and you know that
359.22s: 85 percent kick in the you know what
362.58s: um what's the best thing that ever
363.72s: happened to us in hindsight because well
365.94s: we had a good book of business it wasn't
367.56s: really our passion
369.30s: um it was fun it was good money
371.64s: um proud of the work that we did proud
373.56s: of the clients that we had proud of
375.48s: clients that we've kept
377.10s: um but since starting doomberg we've
379.26s: turned down all new clients and trimmed
381.06s: down the existing clients we've decided
382.68s: to keep just the very core
384.36s: and um and teamwork has swapped that
387.96s: business
389.10s: um to be totally transparent it's really
391.08s: been
393.12s: it's you know eating what you kill kind
396.06s: of as an entrepreneur you know like and
398.52s: the beautiful thing about the
400.08s: subscription business is um we could get
401.88s: another thousand subscribers this week
403.44s: and it wouldn't really create all that
405.00s: much incremental work so it scales we'd
407.40s: still be publishing six to eight pieces
408.96s: a month and we'd still be doing our
410.10s: podcasts and still doing our tweeting
411.60s: and and now of course I'm working on
415.20s: notes sub Stacks new Twitter alternative
417.96s: um but it's also none of this feels like
419.94s: work it's a really amazing blessing we
421.62s: we have a a bunch of phrases we use
423.54s: around the office um the chicken coop
425.10s: we've since bought in our office so that
426.78s: we could sort of um consolidate
428.70s: ourselves into a really great work
430.14s: environment
431.10s: and one of the most important metrics
433.98s: that we measure and hold ourselves
435.12s: accountable to is
436.44s: every week we take a look at our
437.94s: schedule and say how much of this was
439.56s: stuff that we had to do versus how much
442.26s: of this stuff is things that we got to
444.78s: do you feel like I get to do that but I
447.96s: have to do this we call it our get to
449.76s: have to ratio and we want to drive that
451.38s: to infinity and so with the the
454.62s: financial success of duper we've been
456.66s: able to Outsource many of The Have to's
459.90s: and we keep isolating and optimizing Our
463.08s: Lives to only focus on the things that
465.48s: we feel like we get to do
467.82s: which actually makes us far more
469.80s: productive because when you're in I get
472.02s: to do that mode and it doesn't feel like
474.24s: work
475.08s: you could sit at your desk from 10 in
477.12s: the morning until midnight and look at
478.62s: your watch and not know what time it is
480.42s: and getting into that mindset that Peak
482.88s: Performance mindset for something as
485.46s: silly as the doomberg you know substance
488.04s: but it's not silly to us you know like
489.42s: we eat live breathe sleep dream
492.60s: you know this business
494.52s: um and we poured our hearts into it and
496.92s: um
497.52s: you know we we just had a multiple
499.50s: family celebration over spring break
502.40s: and and our subscribers wouldn't know it
505.68s: because we you know we never miss a beat
508.44s: we always publish at the same Cadence
509.76s: our subscribers come first we pre-wrote
512.10s: a couple of pieces
513.60s: um ahead of that vacation that we all
515.04s: took and um you know because our
516.36s: objective is to Delight our clients and
519.18s: as long as you focus on your ideal
520.68s: clients and obsess over delighting them
522.84s: as a small business owner
525.36s: um it's pretty hard to fail
527.52s: essentially just really
530.04s: important wisdom I think even for me is
532.50s: like a new content creator right like
534.66s: I'm new to all of this I started
537.24s: um a little bit before you guys did
538.74s: right during covid
540.84s: um but I did not start in the content
543.12s: creation business I was just trying to
544.86s: like share information with like my
547.68s: veteran friends and I was repeating
549.84s: myself a lot so I made some videos you
551.64s: know so that they could watch and then
552.66s: we could talk
553.74s: but I mean a lot of what you're talking
556.14s: about there is actually just really
557.58s: interesting content creation
560.04s: um information so another question I
562.44s: have is
564.30s: when you think about the world of
567.84s: Economics what keeps you guys excited
571.92s: about it why is that your niche
575.58s: so in the subset of Economics our Niche
577.80s: is what we know which is Commodities
579.54s: energy
580.46s: and related and of course we also have
583.44s: pretty strong Finance background on our
584.94s: team with you know private equity and
587.22s: venture capital and a combination of
589.08s: those things which is what we were doing
591.24s: in our Consulting business which is sort
592.98s: of helping unlock values for private
595.56s: Investments or advising Seafood
598.08s: Executives like hey here's the technical
599.88s: assessment of this opportunity here's
601.80s: the financial assessment and here's why
603.12s: you shouldn't do it
605.10s: um because it's likely to burn your
606.72s: money or here's why you should do it you
608.58s: know um
610.44s: and so that um it's really fun to sort
613.38s: of um we we sort of specialized in
616.56s: distilling complexity so like I remember
618.84s: a client hired us because they had a
620.40s: really tough environmental problem that
622.62s: the internal team really kind of got
624.18s: stuck on it we have a pretty strong
626.04s: Science Background i i in particular you
628.02s: know managed
629.16s: um pretty large teams of phds scientists
632.04s: working on alternative energy for
634.20s: many many years and so I have a pretty
636.24s: good personally I have a pretty good
637.44s: molecular map of how the economy
639.96s: actually works and those are the types
641.94s: of problems where you dive in and you
643.32s: read through five years worth of
644.40s: internal reports and you say aha here's
646.32s: what they've missed and you should look
647.40s: at this and then all of a sudden the
648.72s: whole team sees a problem from a
649.98s: different you know
651.12s: different angle that was super fun we've
652.92s: taken all the fun parts of that job
654.86s: connecting dots
657.18s: um pattern recognition explaining
659.66s: scientific Concepts to finance
661.62s: Professionals in a language they can
662.88s: understand all of those things are sort
665.28s: of wrapped into the doomberg brand and
668.28s: um key element of our brand again is
670.14s: delighting our ideal clients we actually
671.94s: have
672.78s: you know I was listening to your origin
675.06s: story which is actually very common for
676.62s: many content creators and um and and
680.06s: really what it comes down to is that
682.50s: pivot from doing this for fun
686.46s: to doing it professionally and so when
688.26s: you ask me what gets me excited about
689.94s: the economy is the fact that we now have
691.38s: a professional Outlet
693.78s: for our work and thoughts and writings
696.06s: in that regard and the economy is so
698.82s: Dynamic and the energy sector in
700.38s: particular is so Dynamic that were we
702.90s: just published piece 187 this morning
705.06s: and we have never
707.76s: run out of things to write about right
709.98s: and I don't think we ever will and so
712.80s: thing that excites me the most is the
714.66s: dynamic nature of it the ongoing need
716.76s: for pattern recognition and and the
719.28s: distillation of complexity
721.50s: um and that we have found what like
723.42s: personally this is what I was meant to
725.16s: be doing in life
726.60s: and what a gift
728.22s: to wake up every day knowing that after
731.58s: 20 years of school and 20 years plus of
734.76s: working and many many years as an
737.16s: entrepreneur
738.32s: experimenting with various business
739.92s: models that you land on the thing you
742.26s: were supposed to be doing you catch your
745.08s: tiger by the tail and we just don't let
746.88s: go like we're not going to do anything
748.02s: else we wrote a piece one of the work of
750.54s: my life pieces where we talked about the
751.80s: disease of more right like
754.50s: um we've been offered all kinds of
755.76s: things you know hey send me your email
757.74s: list I'll make it lucrative or you know
759.36s: you should write a book or you should do
760.86s: this or you should never gonna do none
762.06s: of those things we're going to show up
763.74s: make our numbers go up and repeat I mean
766.80s: that's what we're going to do we're
767.70s: going to write our pieces we're going to
769.14s: grow our Twitter following we're going
770.28s: to grow our free email list we're going
771.72s: to grow our paid subscriber list
774.06s: um we're gonna nail every podcast
776.76s: um invite that we get
779.60s: by the way put in all the work and show
781.98s: up and be professional and treat every
783.96s: podcast like your business depends on it
785.46s: because it does that's one of our
786.54s: phrases here like we want to be the very
788.70s: best podcast guess we can be because
790.08s: what a what a great engagement but you
792.06s: know in the customer Journey from
793.08s: impression to engagement to email to
794.64s: paid there's no stronger engagement than
796.74s: the people listening to you and I
798.06s: talking right now and maybe some of them
799.68s: will think wow hey this doomberg is
801.12s: worth checking out let me go let me go
802.92s: to their webpage and then some of them
804.30s: will eventually sign up and some of them
805.74s: might actually pay like that's the way
806.82s: this business works and so um we want to
809.76s: be professional about we want to be
810.78s: serious about it and there's just no
812.70s: shortage of fascinating things you know
814.98s: when you research
816.54s: write edit and publish and promote and
818.82s: defend 187 pieces you learn a ton along
822.66s: the way
823.74s: as well so just think of the
825.18s: institutional knowledge that we have
826.68s: built up inside of our very small firm
828.84s: if we ever wanted to restart our
830.76s: Consulting business man how powerful
832.26s: would we be given all the things we've
834.48s: written researched and published and
835.80s: defended and you know one of the things
837.54s: we do after every piece is we we go
839.46s: thoroughly through all the comments
840.60s: which are close to just paid subscribers
842.16s: but they're having to defend it or learn
845.94s: something new or have you thought about
847.20s: this angle like it's all part of that
848.52s: continuous Improvement Learning Journey
849.90s: so that's really to answer your question
851.82s: the thing that excites me the most is
853.56s: that there's just an unlimited uh world
856.38s: of learning potential for us to dive
858.60s: into
859.50s: yeah I I love that and I think at least
862.20s: from like a retail Trader perspective a
864.72s: lot of my audience really enjoys trading
867.24s: for very similar reasons because you get
870.36s: to learn about the world from the lens
872.46s: of Finance which I always kind of find
874.32s: refreshing because you lose a lot of the
877.56s: the partisan stuff in some instances and
880.08s: it's more about dollars and cents
882.48s: um and for a lot of people that's like
884.40s: an easier way to consume the world but
887.34s: when you look at kind of the state of
890.88s: the economy right now
892.68s: what are some of the and I want to get
895.68s: into Commodities and energy but kind of
897.78s: zooming out one level first to start
899.82s: when you look at the state of like the
901.80s: US economy first right now what are some
904.26s: of like the primary themes that you're
906.36s: keying into
908.16s: the thing we're watching most closely is
910.38s: deposit outflows from Regional and
912.18s: Community Banks and this is something
914.88s: that we believe is being
917.70s: perhaps underestimated by the market
920.34s: um now it full disclosure we bank with a
922.80s: very small Community Bank we know the
924.48s: sector pretty well and we're very
926.70s: passionate about the critical importance
928.26s: of Regional Community Banks to
930.96s: the real economy you know if you sort of
933.60s: divide the banking sector in the U.S
934.92s: between the two big to fail Banks
937.02s: certain banks in between and then
938.64s: everybody else all the real hard work
940.44s: that makes the economy go is done by
942.06s: everybody else and JP Morgan doesn't
945.30s: really care about you know
948.30s: um factoring receivables for a local
949.98s: business because they are having trouble
952.02s: financing their working capital because
953.40s: their growth is too strong
955.02s: right
956.16s: um they're actually looking at people
957.42s: like that as an opportunity to squeeze
959.22s: whereas you know we have a banker and
961.92s: she has a name and we know her and um we
965.64s: know her significant other and we we
967.98s: meet about doomberg as a business and
970.32s: when we were about to launch he heard
972.30s: our business plan and she has came to
974.88s: our office and viscerally did her know
976.98s: your customer anti-money laundering
978.36s: obligations by understanding the timing
980.46s: nature and origins of the future cash
981.96s: flows of this new business that we had
983.76s: created that she helped us create
986.76s: um that is such a critical lubricant in
990.18s: the economic years of America
992.78s: and it's just a fundamental fact when
996.00s: deposits leave small Banks they stop
999.18s: Lending
1000.14s: they have to right and when small Banks
1003.02s: stop Lending
1004.16s: the economy goes into what's known as
1006.08s: credit crunch
1007.64s: and right now we have a converging
1010.16s: Factor we have a converging set of
1012.86s: factors I'm sorry
1014.18s: one we've had this recent mini run on
1016.52s: the banks Silicon Valley Bank Signature
1019.58s: Bank Silver Gate
1021.44s: First Republic a few others
1024.68s: two we had Janet Yellen be clown herself
1027.44s: in front of Congress when asked hey you
1030.74s: know our deposits in Oklahoma safe ask
1033.02s: Senator Langford uh Senator Lankford
1035.24s: from Oklahoma and she totally loves the
1036.80s: answer but three and and Jim Bianca
1039.56s: actually just put a great Twitter thread
1041.12s: on this app this morning which was
1042.74s: really eye-opening we have tax paying
1045.26s: season right now and turns out that you
1049.34s: know during last week through the next
1052.04s: week
1052.94s: Banks experience a significant deposit
1055.52s: outflow as people like us have to pay
1058.04s: our taxes you know you make your
1059.18s: estimated taxes for the year then you
1061.58s: file your extension on tax day because
1063.74s: you have you know your LLCs aren't all
1065.42s: lined up and you have to make an
1066.92s: estimate for how much taxes you owe and
1068.18s: then you write a big check and you
1069.38s: usually write a check slightly bigger
1070.52s: than what you owe so that you can get a
1072.44s: small refund in a few months or a few
1074.36s: weeks when you file your final returns
1075.80s: and you don't have to pay a penalty
1077.84s: um there's going to be a huge outflow of
1079.40s: deposits from small and Regional Banks
1082.40s: Community Regional banks in the next you
1084.56s: know in the past week and the next few
1086.36s: weeks and and this could feed a
1089.12s: temporary credit Crunch and you know
1090.86s: when um
1092.54s: when Banks stop lending the economy
1094.04s: stops growing and so we would be
1096.02s: concerned about access to credit for
1099.20s: small businesses and flyover country
1100.70s: because neither the big Banks nor the
1103.58s: national media
1104.84s: cares about flyover country and so
1107.24s: there's two light and we live and
1109.16s: flyover country we we are immersed in
1111.68s: this culture we understand how the
1113.36s: construction company
1114.80s: you know needs to prepay for materials
1116.90s: and all that stuff and and
1119.42s: and that's actually you know 50 60 70
1122.18s: percent of the actual economy
1124.70s: you know the two big to fill Banks make
1126.26s: money because they're too big to fail
1127.94s: so it's just that simple and and the
1130.46s: small Regional Community Banks need to
1132.56s: make money by
1134.18s: um growing deposits and lending shortly
1137.60s: and and and that is actually the economy
1140.48s: the two big to fill Banks aren't the
1141.86s: economy the derivatives books and the
1144.68s: counterparty risk and the you know
1147.74s: um crop desk Insider that's not the
1149.66s: economy that's moving money around
1152.48s: hoping to pilfer money from retail
1155.18s: investors the economy is our Banker who
1159.38s: lends to
1160.78s: the son who inherited his Plumbing
1163.28s: business and wants to buy three new Vans
1165.50s: and hire four new employees to double
1166.88s: this business because he thinks he has a
1168.38s: competitive advantage over the
1169.40s: competitor across town that's the
1171.14s: economy that's capitalism that's an
1173.84s: entrepreneur taking a risk
1176.12s: um leaning on the bank for some help and
1178.04s: succeeding in the bank getting their
1179.72s: money back with interest and that you
1181.58s: know plumber getting the excess
1183.62s: um Equity that they've earned literally
1186.44s: earned working 80 hours a week making
1188.00s: their business run and so our biggest
1190.64s: the key thing that keeps us up at night
1192.20s: right now is
1194.24s: deposit outflows out of small banks in
1196.52s: the US and I do it has a certain
1198.92s: subprime is contained feel to it
1201.44s: um if we go back to sort of 08 but
1203.18s: probably not to that degree but a very
1205.22s: similar feel where I was like ah you
1206.84s: know subprime's a small part of the
1208.04s: housing market and housing prices only
1209.84s: ever go up
1211.40s: um oh these small Community Regional
1213.32s: Banks don't really matter and the big
1214.94s: Banks can just fill the void no they
1216.32s: can't and they won't and so this this is
1218.84s: really from an economics perspective the
1220.88s: thing we're watching most closely
1222.74s: and you brought up that you felt like
1224.78s: the General market is not necessarily
1227.60s: fully appreciating that fact what what
1230.36s: leads you to believe that just that
1232.04s: you're not seeing the movement that you
1233.66s: would expect based on that information
1234.86s: or something else
1236.84s: yeah I think the
1240.38s: the sort of s p earnings estimates and
1243.08s: so on that you know who knows whether
1244.88s: that actually moves markets I suppose
1246.32s: markets are mostly you know moved by
1248.18s: flow at these points you know flows into
1251.00s: you know
1252.08s: um into passive investment vehicles and
1254.42s: so on but um by and large we still
1256.64s: believe that ultimately the price of
1259.04s: equity should reflect the present and
1261.20s: future value of earnings and cash flows
1263.18s: and dividends and BuyBacks and to the
1265.16s: extent that the market might be
1266.18s: overestimating the strength of the
1267.86s: economy in the back half of the year
1269.24s: then you would expect that there would
1271.10s: be a little more bearishness in the
1272.36s: markets than we see today having said
1273.86s: all of that
1275.60s: um we're not good Traders and and
1277.34s: everybody listening should understand
1278.54s: that so
1280.90s: and did you see I'm sure you know right
1284.06s: banks are reporting right now and a lot
1285.68s: of them actually beat on their previous
1288.26s: release does that factor and that's the
1290.84s: big Banks to be very clear I'm curious
1293.18s: how that factors into confirms my fears
1296.06s: exactly okay that's what I was figuring
1297.80s: yeah because this is zero-sum game so if
1300.14s: the big banks are outperforming who's
1301.52s: underperforming
1303.32s: right
1304.94s: um again big Banks exceeding earnings
1307.40s: and expectation is consistent with
1310.58s: again we're not making a bearish call we
1314.00s: have man steubenburg you know nobody
1315.92s: comes to us for the rosy you know
1317.48s: optimistic album but if you're asking me
1320.78s: where I would be concerned and what
1322.52s: Milestones I would be tracking
1324.80s: you know the the weekly reports of the
1326.90s: FED about deposits at small and Regional
1329.24s: Community Banks uh is one that we're
1331.22s: looking at and by the way concur with
1333.26s: that you know we have a pro tier
1335.42s: um where
1337.22s: um we have sort of elite subscribers who
1339.38s: get
1340.16s: the full Dooms in webinar once a month
1342.02s: with usually a presentation from us or a
1344.90s: high profile guest and the key part of
1346.16s: that is they get open q a like direct q
1348.08s: a with us and a guest room
1349.82s: on the last fed day we had Danielle
1352.28s: demartino boothan and she gave up a
1354.38s: really staggering 30 minute presentation
1356.00s: going into all these details and one of
1358.28s: the big big challenges is um of course
1361.22s: real estate
1362.72s: 55 commercial real estate loans are
1364.88s: underwritten by small Regional Community
1366.86s: Banks and um nobody's going back to work
1369.86s: right I mean these Office Buildings are
1371.66s: empty nobody's going back to the office
1373.10s: people are still working nobody's going
1374.48s: back to the office
1375.62s: and you combine deposit outflow with bad
1379.58s: loans
1381.08s: and suddenly you can begin to see
1384.08s: you know the Genesis out on the cancer
1385.94s: crisis and truly
1388.22s: the market is just sort of pricing in
1390.56s: that the FED has everybody's back and
1392.06s: look that's been a very good trade and
1393.32s: it probably is true
1395.06s: um that the FED still does have
1396.32s: everybody's back
1397.94s: um but uh it's something we're looking
1399.62s: at for sure
1401.06s: Yeah you mentioned something earlier
1403.10s: that I actually talk a lot about
1404.36s: specifically from a trading perspective
1405.98s: which is pattern recognition it's really
1407.84s: well documented it is a super important
1410.60s: aspect for long-term successful Traders
1413.06s: obviously you're finding that to be
1414.86s: important also in just the world of
1417.68s: economics if you're thinking about the
1420.68s: perspective of a retail Trader what are
1423.98s: some of the key pattern pieces that you
1427.34s: think they should start paying attention
1429.56s: to in general if they're not already
1434.24s: yeah tough question because
1436.04s: um retail trading is hard hard to make
1438.32s: you know hard to beat the market as a
1439.82s: retail Trader as you know and um
1442.34s: and so our advice to retail Traders is
1444.62s: don't trade until you've like paper
1447.20s: traded for a long time and really
1448.46s: understood what makes it work but even
1449.96s: then you know there's something fiscally
1451.70s: different emotionally about having your
1452.96s: own money on the line
1454.58s: um and then that sort of runs counter to
1456.50s: what I was just saying but if I if I
1458.30s: were
1459.20s: given a fixed amount of money to trade
1461.30s: and I had to it's not something I would
1462.92s: like to do
1463.82s: um I would actually become deeply
1465.80s: knowledgeable about a very small subset
1467.60s: of the market right
1468.86s: and I would go I would go deep and I
1471.14s: would trade three or four stocks maximum
1473.78s: and I would know their Industries I
1475.70s: would know what they mean when they put
1477.44s: out press release I press releases I
1479.12s: would know what they mean when they they
1480.74s: say certain things on earnings calls or
1482.78s: you know for example if you had a pure
1484.58s: play in a very narrow commodity and then
1486.92s: you subscribe to the industry magazine a
1489.86s: rag that gives you the weekly prices for
1492.08s: the market and you could beat the market
1493.70s: knowing that prices are taking a dip and
1495.50s: you could go short that thing
1497.60s: um or or you could see that this
1499.04s: bullicious indicators because you know
1500.48s: one of their competitors went offline
1501.80s: and and they're running at full capacity
1503.48s: and they have pricing power and the
1504.80s: market hasn't yet realized that you know
1506.18s: if you get a fundamental Edge and then
1507.92s: use some technicals to support your
1509.84s: entry and exits that's sort of the
1511.70s: classic way to do it
1513.26s: um and that's what I would advise like I
1515.42s: would become deeply knowledgeable around
1517.52s: three or four companies
1519.26s: and I wouldn't you know I would keep an
1521.24s: eye on the broader macro just to
1523.34s: understand sort of the tide but I would
1526.40s: go I would trade the same stock over and
1528.14s: over and over again that's actually what
1529.58s: I would do so keying into that though
1531.68s: and I'm specifically curious about the
1533.48s: the economics side just because that's
1535.76s: kind of where your eminence is so you
1537.26s: mentioned at the end there that you know
1539.24s: you would keep an eye on the economic
1540.80s: tide how would you do that
1543.50s: so let's take an example right now
1546.02s: um crypto
1547.46s: and we've written about operation show
1548.96s: Point 2.0
1550.94s: um which is tied to the spanking crisis
1553.70s: you know it's not surprising that three
1555.56s: of the banks that failed either were
1557.30s: directly or indirectly heavily
1558.62s: associated with the crypto industry and
1560.12s: the Epic Mania in um private markets
1563.12s: venture capital
1566.06s: um that's a huge headwind or any crypto
1570.56s: related stock
1572.24s: and so you might say at the highest
1574.88s: level
1576.68s: um I am
1578.48s: bearish all things crypto
1581.72s: and so I will be opportunistically
1585.50s: seeking
1587.48s: rallies to Short
1589.52s: you know and dips to cover
1592.04s: um and I would say wow you know Bitcoin
1594.92s: just went up 2 000 points
1597.44s: and
1599.00s: just take for example like Gary Gensler
1600.62s: has made it very clear
1602.06s: what he's going to do it's all there
1603.92s: like the writing's on the wall like you
1605.54s: just charged this rest exchange
1607.46s: yesterday you could read the 80-page
1608.84s: report yourself we did we know what he's
1610.82s: doing and so we know what that might
1612.86s: what it should mean
1615.50s: certain stocks in the public market and
1618.74s: you can then say to yourself I have a
1621.50s: bearish
1622.52s: fundamental Tailwind if I'm going to go
1624.92s: now puts or or I'm going to short a
1626.72s: stock
1627.68s: um and then you have to watch the trade
1629.90s: action and you can say wow this thing
1631.58s: you know
1632.54s: Tesla's ramping today and that means a
1634.58s: lot of the sort of
1636.38s: um memes type stocks are ramping and
1638.42s: this thing that I've been watching and
1639.50s: thinking about shorting just as up four
1640.94s: and a half percent on no news that
1642.08s: doesn't make any sense and Gary
1643.64s: kensler's testifying today before
1645.14s: Congress and I read his testimony and
1646.76s: nothing changed I'm going to go ahead
1648.26s: and short that stock today and then you
1650.60s: know you have your entry in your exit
1652.10s: and your own discipline and everyone I'm
1653.84s: sure would I'm sure you think about
1655.46s: discipline all the time
1657.26s: um and and that's the way that we would
1659.42s: look at it and then but then you have to
1660.74s: be very careful to say okay what are the
1662.24s: Milestones that would make me pivot from
1664.34s: being bearish to sector to the longer
1666.68s: Barrison and you have to stop trading
1668.06s: through that framework immediately and
1669.86s: it might be two consecutive trades that
1671.66s: don't work now pick your favorite rule
1673.94s: the thing about trading again don't take
1676.34s: advice for me on trading but
1678.32s: um I certainly read a lot about it try
1680.06s: my hand at it a few times had some
1681.56s: successes had some failures
1683.54s: um is is really it it is literally just
1686.90s: a discipline game
1688.76s: um you have your rules and the greatest
1692.00s: indicator of success for a Trader is the
1694.46s: discipline with which they follow their
1695.72s: rules it's not even actually what the
1697.04s: rules say
1698.24s: because the reason why Traders lose is
1699.92s: because of emotion
1702.02s: um and so as long as you have a set of
1703.64s: rules that you are very disciplined
1705.62s: about keeping you know within look you
1707.42s: can't say my rule is I put 50 of my
1709.40s: account into every trade like but you
1711.50s: have to have a pretty reasonable as long
1713.06s: as you have a reasonable set of rules
1714.98s: the thing that differentiates good
1716.78s: Traders from below average Traders is
1719.18s: the discipline and the lack of emotion
1722.18s: and executing that discipline around
1723.62s: those rules
1725.24s: yeah completely agree yeah at first when
1727.40s: you were saying about the the discipline
1728.90s: I was kind of half agreeing half
1730.64s: disagreeing with you but then as soon as
1732.02s: you added the the caveat on having rules
1734.54s: that provide positive Edge completely
1736.22s: agree yeah 100 yeah
1739.04s: um and by the way experiment to develop
1741.14s: such a set of rules with small Stakes so
1742.88s: that you keep your bankroll yeah like
1746.06s: um until you're a really good card
1747.32s: character uh card counter at the
1748.94s: blackjack table you shouldn't be betting
1750.56s: large but the moment you were convinced
1752.42s: yourself that you could count cards and
1754.10s: the casino won't figure it out well when
1755.78s: the when the odds are in your favor then
1757.34s: you could raise your Stakes you know
1758.42s: bankroll management alongside a good set
1760.40s: of rules is absolutely critical to
1761.72s: staying in a game you know it's funny as
1763.28s: you're talking I'm seeing behind you you
1764.78s: have two books
1766.22s: um options
1767.54s: um SSG investment and Supple Leopard and
1770.66s: that might be the first guest to uh to
1772.76s: to be a proud owner of both of those
1774.26s: books oh really you know you know uh
1780.22s: I could tell by your physique that
1782.24s: you're a power lifter I'm a uh I'm a
1784.16s: closet power lifter and uh I will say
1786.62s: that I have a um relative to my weight I
1790.82s: have a uh exceptionally strong deadlift
1793.46s: that's my specialty but anyway I digress
1795.38s: wait is it Sumo or conventional we have
1797.90s: to get that out of the way
1799.52s: oh I do uh my favorite deadlift is the
1802.34s: hex bar
1811.90s: I
1813.68s: at my Peak I did lifted two and a half
1815.60s: times my body weight
1816.92s: good yeah that's really good yeah I
1820.28s: think um
1821.32s: no I I welcome it openly because I
1825.20s: actually
1826.30s: I'm a huge moment of Fitness in general
1829.82s: not just like physical but mental
1831.80s: Fitness and this is probably one of my
1835.28s: most gifted books becoming a simple
1837.44s: leopard I give probably 30 to 50 copies
1840.50s: of that out a year and it's because it's
1842.66s: like I genuinely think it's
1844.52s: transformative so I actually think it's
1846.08s: super super dope that that you're
1847.70s: familiar with uh yeah
1850.94s: I I implemented a pretty significant
1853.16s: project around a birthday Milestone and
1855.08s: that book was part of my I set a very
1857.90s: strong goal and I just broke it down
1859.58s: into small parts and you know and that
1861.92s: book and a few others uh really helped
1864.26s: me achieve that goal and and it was sort
1866.30s: of a crazy goal a stupid goal but but I
1868.94s: managed to do it and um and so I really
1871.10s: did enjoy that book which is why but
1872.42s: I've saw I've seen it since we started
1874.16s: talking and I was waiting for my
1875.24s: opportunity to to bring it up but I also
1877.58s: own the book on top of it
1879.20s: um options as a Strategic investment
1880.64s: because I have a good feel for numbers
1882.62s: and love trading options even though you
1884.30s: know I have a good friend Tony Greer who
1886.16s: runs TG macro and he says when you're
1887.84s: thinking about putting an Ops trade on
1890.12s: um slam your hand in a drawer and then
1891.80s: think about it again so he doesn't
1894.20s: believe in training options and uh he's
1896.54s: a good friend of mine we like to joke um
1898.16s: but I I'm a I'm a I have a i
1900.14s: predominantly don't trade
1901.94s: um I invest privately but I do have a
1904.46s: nickel slots account where occasionally
1905.84s: I will um head to the horses head to the
1908.48s: ponies and make a few bets and I still
1910.22s: enjoy it so
1911.90s: yeah and I actually think keeping a side
1914.30s: of that is still good man because even
1916.82s: if it's low probability but still
1918.44s: asymmetric risk every once in a while it
1920.66s: does pay out like like you said right a
1922.76s: very small subset of a bankroll but I do
1926.24s: think there's a time and place
1928.16s: it's a very it's a de minimis amount
1931.28s: relative to my personal net worth but it
1933.50s: is still admit in a ways it's almost
1935.48s: more fun than you know the big bets of
1937.22s: the payoff in in the private world you
1938.90s: know it's um it I have a couple of
1941.48s: friends that I do it with and we just
1942.68s: sort of
1943.58s: get to dunk on each other when the
1944.96s: trades don't go well and or when they do
1946.70s: for us and so it's just kind of fun it's
1948.56s: good to have a little skit in the game
1949.70s: and and just uh it's like watching
1951.86s: football and placing a few side bets on
1953.42s: Sunday you know who doesn't like to do
1955.58s: that so well I hate watching football if
1958.64s: I can get you on a rugby that would be
1960.14s: my go-to but you know I get to the point
1962.02s: only if I can gamble on it
1964.70s: oh yeah you can gamble and rugby all
1966.80s: over the place they're degenerates
1970.04s: um it's it's actually funny though that
1972.50s: you talk the more I listen to you talk
1974.84s: the more I find a lot of just general
1977.30s: common themes from the concepts of
1979.28s: stoicism that you mentioned up front
1981.14s: definitely notice that littered
1982.82s: throughout you talked about taking a big
1985.52s: problem and chunking it into small
1987.68s: problems we do that in the Marine Corps
1989.42s: literally all of the time we have the
1991.16s: saying how do you eat an elephant one
1992.66s: bite at a time and then you're also into
1996.02s: physical fitness which I find
1998.54s: fascinating because I actually think
2001.12s: there's a huge correlation between a
2003.40s: human being's discipline as you
2005.86s: mentioned and just their overall impact
2008.14s: on life not just how good they are as a
2010.90s: Trader or how good they are as an
2012.28s: economist or a business owner but just
2013.90s: literally in life
2015.90s: what is kind of your guiding feature
2019.42s: obviously in terms of business you like
2022.06s: what you do
2023.26s: is there a broader impact that you're
2026.20s: trying to make as doomberg the brand or
2028.66s: as an individual within doomberg I'm
2030.82s: curious how you think literally about
2032.26s: life large
2034.60s: yeah so you know obviously uh married
2037.06s: two kids I love my family deeply love my
2040.60s: business partners and and their family
2043.36s: um so I'm a big believer that you know
2046.78s: um success starts in the home and take
2049.78s: care of your stuff
2051.40s: um I once said something in in Greer
2053.56s: slack Tony grew a slack that um pride of
2056.14s: ownership as they found foundational
2057.70s: attribute of a responsible provider so
2060.28s: if you come to my house and you look
2062.32s: around my yard there's a lot of right
2063.58s: angles and well-cut grass and if there's
2066.22s: a paint chip it gets it gets you know
2068.62s: taken care of and if a branch falls out
2070.36s: of a tree onto my driveway it gets
2071.62s: picked up like we the pro the precise
2074.38s: and proper amount of pieces of garbage
2076.06s: in my property is zero
2078.94s: um and you know I I don't care where you
2080.86s: are on the economic ladder proud of
2082.24s: ownership is free
2084.28s: um and and it starts at home so
2086.50s: um you know personal preparedness taking
2088.96s: care of my kids you know straight teeth
2091.06s: and then education is my commitment to
2092.80s: them and they'll get both of those
2095.14s: things before they leave my home and
2096.52s: they will have lifelong allies and
2097.84s: support between me and my spouse
2100.84s: um
2101.62s: and then it goes out from there you know
2103.60s: like I will take care of my friends and
2105.22s: family first and then charitable giving
2106.78s: beyond that and helping others and one
2108.70s: of the big ethoses of doomberg is we
2110.20s: help every content creator who asks us
2111.70s: and I I do countless uh Zoom calls
2115.12s: one-on-one with aspiring or existing
2117.46s: content creators who want to run their
2118.66s: businesses better or try to pick our
2120.04s: brain or and vice versa by the way we
2121.90s: learn from all of them as well which is
2123.22s: a great way
2124.30s: um we firmly believe that the NPP of
2126.64s: giving is infinite so
2129.16s: um you know there will be lots of people
2130.84s: who take advantage of your time and
2132.10s: never pay you back and that's perfectly
2133.54s: fine because all it takes is one along
2135.04s: the way that that is as transformative
2137.14s: as that hedge fund manager who took my
2139.06s: call at the depths of our covid crisis
2141.58s: and gave us a really critically
2143.08s: important piece of life that changed our
2144.58s: lives you know like if 30 people that we
2147.04s: helped ignore us when we truly need it
2148.72s: all it takes is that one person to give
2150.52s: you that sort of pivot point in your
2152.62s: life and you have to then be prepared to
2154.06s: take advantage of it and one of our
2155.74s: favorite phrases
2157.54s: um which comes back to your physical
2158.62s: fitness comment
2160.18s: um Vince Lombardi find out what the
2162.34s: price is and pay it like I'm a firm
2163.78s: believer that
2165.76s: um if you have a reasonable goal and you
2168.16s: break it down to a thousand pieces of
2170.38s: the elephant and you can isolate all the
2172.96s: other variables
2174.70s: accept your efforts
2176.92s: then there's no excuse but your own
2180.06s: inability to work hard enough to get
2182.14s: there and many people actually fall not
2184.96s: to get too philosophical but this is a
2186.64s: great conversation we're going down
2188.50s: um various rabbit holes here
2190.24s: um
2191.20s: most people don't want to actually do
2193.42s: their very best at anything because if
2195.76s: they if they do their very best and they
2197.74s: don't succeed then they will have
2199.00s: nothing other than themselves to blame
2200.80s: for their failure so they proactively
2202.48s: look
2203.62s: or cop-outs excuses and reasons why the
2207.58s: outside world created a set of
2209.26s: conditions that cause them to not
2211.30s: succeed
2212.38s: and
2213.64s: um we would call that loser talk I mean
2216.04s: to be totally blunt like winners win
2218.26s: winners go and get it like um you don't
2220.96s: get to be in the Marine Corps unless
2222.28s: you're a winner like you gotta go and
2224.20s: get it right and you're not going to
2226.18s: travel a life as a successful Trader if
2228.94s: you're always railing about how the
2230.62s: market is wrong
2232.60s: right and so
2235.12s: um when I was in the sort of the
2238.78s: corporate world and we were looking to
2240.34s: hire we had a very strong philosophy
2242.62s: winners win let's look for signs of
2245.62s: winning on the resume not signs of
2247.54s: pedigree
2248.62s: although there is an aspect of pedigree
2250.24s: that matters
2251.86s: um but signs of winning and the number
2254.26s: one sign of winning is what I would sort
2256.90s: of call that curve what did you do with
2259.54s: the opportunities when they were given
2261.10s: to you at various stages of your career
2262.84s: right I don't care where you started
2265.12s: what did you do where you started and
2267.76s: did you parlay that into another
2269.50s: opportunity so you may have enlisted in
2271.30s: the Army and then you know I don't know
2272.92s: how it works in the military but you go
2274.54s: and like try to get into the Marine
2277.00s: Corps and then you do and then when
2278.26s: you're in the Marine Corps you climb up
2279.64s: a ladder quickly and suddenly you become
2281.32s: you know
2282.64s: um very high up in the pecking order and
2284.68s: like that's a winner like when given an
2287.14s: opportunity you nailed it and if you
2289.18s: have a consistent track record of
2290.56s: nailing the opportunities you have the
2293.02s: absolute place where you are doesn't
2294.70s: matter as much as the vector and if the
2297.16s: vector is upward forcing and and give me
2300.16s: an engine
2301.24s: and you know you can you can do wonders
2304.72s: with a with a team full of people with a
2306.70s: high motor
2308.08s: um and so we have a very small team
2309.82s: we've not expanded we've not grown we've
2312.64s: spent nothing creating doomberg
2315.04s: um we've can on purpose run a very tight
2318.10s: just budget we spend zero on customer
2319.84s: acquisition
2321.28s: um
2322.18s: we've spent
2323.44s: a shockingly small amount of money
2325.36s: building new brakes all Sweat Equity and
2328.42s: we have resisted the temptation to build
2330.10s: a big team to Outsource a bunch of work
2332.16s: we want to live eat breathe sleep
2335.44s: viscerally feel every aspect of this
2337.72s: business stop doing almost everything
2339.40s: else in our life and we've just pounded
2341.38s: it and like when you catch a tiger by
2343.18s: the tail you keep going like
2344.86s: um
2345.52s: you know you just keep going
2347.62s: um wake up show up make the number go up
2349.90s: and repeat that's our motto uh we attack
2352.48s: it with discipline like a Supple Leopard
2354.88s: um and that book had a big impact on me
2356.82s: and and it's true like and and very few
2361.12s: people have that
2363.40s: um far more people have the desire to
2366.10s: find an excuse
2368.02s: then they have the willingness to lay it
2370.78s: all out there like if you're not like if
2373.06s: you do your best you will Define what
2374.86s: your best is not and you best be
2376.24s: prepared
2377.20s: or understanding like
2380.32s: let's say I studied my ass off for a
2382.42s: math test when I was in school
2384.10s: and the kid next to me beat me by three
2386.20s: percentage points
2387.64s: two things happened
2389.68s: I found out that that kid is better than
2391.24s: me at math
2392.38s: which is irrelevant
2393.94s: I did my very best on this math test and
2395.98s: set myself up personally for the
2397.48s: absolute maximum success in life so our
2400.18s: belief is
2402.40s: um absolute measurements are the ones
2404.56s: that matter not relative ones so my
2407.02s: personal deadlift record pales in
2408.94s: comparison to yours I could tell
2410.32s: somebody looking at you compared to
2411.64s: looking at me
2412.84s: but for me that was the very best I
2415.48s: could do and I did it and I said a goal
2417.70s: I broke it down I laid it all on the
2420.34s: line
2421.00s: they're not they're not five people in
2422.80s: the world that cared but I hit that
2424.06s: milestone
2425.26s: I cared because it meant something to me
2427.24s: and I did it and that's the framework
2428.68s: that's the mentality that and I do
2431.62s: believe that comes through in our
2432.58s: writing in our professionalism in our
2434.38s: marketing and our subscribers appreciate
2436.66s: it and they're inspired by it and we've
2438.94s: been very honest with our subscribers
2440.20s: from the beginning two years ago that we
2441.70s: intended to make this a business that
2443.08s: transformed our lives and we invited
2445.00s: them to be part of that Journey with us
2446.86s: and I think that has been a real
2448.90s: important input into our success
2451.84s: yeah it's huge and I'm I'm a big fan of
2454.30s: your guys's writing because there's a
2457.00s: lot of writing that I see that it's
2459.76s: difficult for me to read a lot of times
2461.74s: there's a lot of baked an agenda or
2464.26s: there's just a lot of
2466.42s: um fluff it's just words that probably
2468.40s: don't need to be there that consume
2470.32s: space and it takes time to read and
2472.78s: admittedly as
2475.18s: the consumer it can be annoying it can
2477.64s: just be laborious but I notice with your
2480.34s: guys's articles I I don't get that
2482.92s: sensation like they're obviously very
2485.32s: well written pieces and just about
2487.24s: everything in there has a reason for
2489.10s: being in there in terms of telling a
2490.48s: full story
2496.72s: um I was gonna ask when you're writing
2499.90s: about current Day events like we're
2503.44s: seeing you know day over day
2505.36s: a lot of these things have immense
2508.12s: complexity how do you strike a balance
2510.76s: between writing a piece that is
2513.54s: descriptive enough and has enough
2515.80s: supporting information to give a good
2518.50s: solid understanding but you don't go so
2521.98s: far that you're explaining every single
2524.56s: thing you mentioned so that it becomes
2526.12s: an unreadable piece how do you find that
2527.74s: balance yeah so great question back to
2530.80s: our brand ambition
2532.54s: um and this is really important so
2533.86s: there's sort of two factors our brand
2535.18s: ambition and the fact that we have a
2537.46s: person who is the editor that is a
2539.32s: complete and separate and distinct role
2541.54s: from the writer and editing is not uh
2544.72s: proofreading editing is editing
2547.18s: um and that editor is actually really
2551.10s: fits the descriptor of our ideal clients
2553.78s: so not a technical background but a
2555.94s: finance background but pretty you know
2557.56s: obviously brilliant and um literally our
2560.14s: ideal client and so if we could write in
2561.64s: a way that our editor gets it then our
2564.64s: ideal client probably gets it but back
2566.08s: to the brain our brand ambition and our
2568.00s: brand is nothing more than the gut
2569.26s: feeling you induce in your ideal clients
2571.12s: when they interact with your product we
2573.64s: created doomberg with the following
2575.02s: brand ambition when our email shows up
2577.78s: in Eric's inbox the gut feeling we
2580.84s: induce in Eric is ooh I get to read that
2584.98s: not I have to read that I should read
2587.08s: that or that might be interesting but
2588.40s: I'll get to it I'll print it out and
2589.84s: then I'll never read it and it goes in
2591.16s: the garbage at the end of the week when
2592.36s: I clean my desk I get to read that so
2595.48s: how do we do that we broke that down
2596.74s: into three brand Ambitions and the third
2598.48s: of them hits to your question the first
2601.18s: is we shall be provocative without being
2603.22s: polarizing nobody wants milk toast but
2606.70s: nobody wants well we didn't want to be
2609.04s: just an outrage engagement machine okay
2613.30s: um two we shall be funny without being
2614.98s: silly our pieces should entertain you
2617.20s: you should smirk you should get the
2618.70s: inside jokes of our captions on our
2621.34s: pictures and you know like there's a
2623.26s: there's a lot of embedded
2625.12s: fun inside jokes in our pieces that our
2627.58s: long time readers get which drives huge
2629.32s: engagement and stickiness and that's the
2631.84s: most important parameter for
2632.80s: subscription business and then third to
2634.90s: your point we shall teach without being
2637.30s: self-indulgent and our editor being
2641.98s: the manifestation of one of our ideal
2643.66s: clients is the ultimate Arbiter in
2647.08s: this is too much let's cut that this
2650.02s: needs to be pulled out a little Lamar
2651.40s: because you're assuming too much in the
2652.72s: reader and we desperately try to strike
2655.18s: that exact balance that you just
2656.62s: described our ideal readers are
2659.20s: financially sophisticated Highly
2661.00s: Educated Financial professionals that
2663.40s: have succeeded in life that Pride
2665.14s: themselves on their ability to
2666.28s: understand complexity but like the laugh
2668.50s: like to learn like to be educated and
2671.14s: like to feel part of something and we
2672.64s: try to give that to our ideal clients
2673.96s: with every piece and so like in the
2676.24s: piece we published this morning about
2677.56s: Saudi Arabia and the rupture of the U.S
2679.36s: and the prospects for peace in the
2681.04s: Middle East and what that might mean for
2682.18s: the bric countries and the US dollar and
2683.74s: the price of oil in the future there was
2685.42s: a lot of stuff that didn't make it that
2686.80s: I had in it when I first handed it over
2688.36s: for edit and one of the most important
2690.10s: things we did very early on in Nuremberg
2691.72s: around piece 20 or piece 30.
2694.24s: um is we decided that we would have a
2698.02s: full day for editing
2699.64s: before we publish a piece
2701.50s: so when we are going through our
2703.84s: timeline for the week right now I have a
2705.88s: mental Target to get the next piece done
2707.32s: by Wednesday for a Friday morning
2708.88s: publication
2710.74s: which gives the editor a full day to rip
2713.56s: apart and we do I mean by the way once
2715.90s: it goes to the editor it's out of my
2717.16s: hands like we have a work process and we
2720.76s: have you know operations one of our five
2722.20s: pillars uh to our business and we have a
2725.44s: very systematic 30 point checklist for
2727.42s: each piece what's the title what's the
2728.80s: quote what's the outline what's the one
2730.36s: sentence summary of each paragraph what
2731.80s: are the charts what are the what are the
2733.42s: photoshops what's the thumbnail what's
2734.80s: the social preview first draft second
2737.32s: draft third draft hand it off to edit
2739.78s: um first edit second edit third edit
2742.24s: um post it send it to a few of our
2744.82s: friends to make sure there's no glaring
2746.32s: typos and even still despite all of that
2748.30s: you know we had to type on the piece
2749.50s: this morning which makes you want to
2750.46s: shoot yourself
2751.72s: um jokingly internally and I did but the
2754.66s: point is like that level of
2756.34s: professionalism is what our audience
2757.54s: comes to expect and we have as an editor
2760.06s: which is a critical role if you're going
2761.38s: to be a writer without an editor and
2762.64s: you're just getting your stuff proof
2763.60s: read you're not actually operating at
2765.34s: the highest plane possible you need a
2766.84s: brilliant editor who has the courage to
2769.12s: tell you what's and to tell you
2770.62s: what it needs to go and to tell you
2772.42s: what's missing and to say this is
2774.10s: self-indulgent it doesn't teach it's
2775.60s: self-indulgent stop you don't need to
2777.58s: bring Eric all the way here Eric Smart
2779.44s: he gets it you can stop right here and
2781.54s: we do that it's one of the three brain
2783.64s: pillars is how do we make sure we're
2786.76s: bringing just enough along and you know
2789.16s: sometimes if you talk over the head of
2790.60s: of your reader that's okay because
2791.92s: they'll go back and they'll do the
2793.18s: research and they'll want to learn and
2794.44s: they'll understand it and they'll get it
2795.64s: and they'll have new respect for you
2796.72s: because of where you're operating out of
2798.34s: and they want to join you right like
2799.42s: that's part of learning you don't just
2801.40s: feed everybody everything and so it's
2804.10s: okay to talk a little bit in code and to
2805.96s: refer to things that they might not know
2807.28s: but it doesn't it doesn't take from the
2810.22s: context the essence of the message still
2811.96s: comes through
2813.70s: um and so um that's the real key We
2816.88s: Believe to a a perfect Emperor piece a
2819.04s: perfect Ember piece teaches you
2820.90s: something you didn't know makes you
2822.58s: laugh
2823.78s: um and and then leaves you with a
2826.12s: feeling that wow I'm glad I read that
2827.92s: and that speaks to peace length it
2830.20s: speaks to paragraph length it speaks to
2832.80s: word sophistication you know like
2835.96s: um there's lots of things that go into
2837.52s: being a great writer it's not just
2839.44s: writing long and fancy words that people
2841.84s: don't understand but they have to pick
2842.98s: up a dictionary
2844.84s: um to go and and see what the meaning is
2847.06s: and I'll leave you with one final point
2849.04s: one of our phrases is anybody can say a
2852.04s: lot with a lot of words it takes talent
2854.32s: to say a lot with few words and we pride
2856.48s: ourselves on the density of our pieces
2858.72s: recognizing that people's attention
2861.04s: spans are shrinking they're busy we
2863.02s: respect their time they might only read
2865.00s: the first third if we don't capture them
2867.22s: um they're not going to read the rest of
2868.18s: it we want them to read all the way
2869.14s: through it and so we think about that
2870.82s: all the time it's great that you ask
2872.26s: that question because this is really
2874.24s: really a key element of our operational
2876.82s: plan
2878.02s: I love it yeah it reminds me of Leonardo
2880.66s: da Vinci one of my favorite quotes of
2882.58s: his is Simplicity is the ultimate
2884.98s: sophistication and I actually really
2886.78s: subscribe to that concept even in my
2889.24s: trading people ask like what I do for
2891.58s: trading and you know they expect I'm
2893.44s: actually primarily a derivatives Trader
2895.18s: and that you know they expect since I
2898.00s: trade options or Futures that I'm always
2899.92s: deploying these really sophisticated
2901.72s: elegant crazy strategies and I explain
2903.64s: I'm like most of what I do is boring as
2907.06s:  it is super simple Concepts that
2910.54s: I've honed over 16 years and that is
2914.50s: exactly why they work
2917.08s: um so I actually really like that you
2919.72s: guys uh think about it that way
2922.06s: um another thing I wanted to ask you is
2925.36s: there's two big things that we're seeing
2928.30s: a lot of conversation around right now
2930.34s: there's kind of the the US dollar
2932.62s: potentially falling from Grace as the
2935.62s: global Reserve currency lots of news
2937.48s: about that and then also kind of these
2940.12s: new conversations with OPEC Plus
2942.94s: oil production I'm out of those two
2946.12s: stories what is like what's the bigger
2949.18s: story in your view
2951.04s: yeah I think the detolorization risk is
2953.32s: vastly exaggerated
2955.06s: um I do think there's a possibility of
2956.80s: partitioning the globe into you know
2959.86s: regions where the dollar still dominates
2961.90s: and where alternative currencies begin
2963.94s: to get more market share in certain
2965.32s: regions
2967.06s: um
2967.72s: and for the average listener that
2970.60s: partitioning is going to be irrelevant
2971.98s: to you because you live in the dollar
2973.18s: world and you know that our investment
2975.88s: philosophies we earn in Fiat we save in
2977.80s: real assets and we invest privately well
2979.72s: that Fiat that we earn in is a US dollar
2981.34s: and I've said even though we're gold
2982.72s: bugs and we have many gold bugs amongst
2984.28s: our subscribers if the US government
2985.84s: came out tomorrow and made private
2987.82s: ownership of golden illegal we would be
2989.44s: turning in our goal because we are law
2990.82s: abiding citizens of the United States we
2992.92s: operate within the construct of the law
2994.50s: and we have families and reputations and
2998.08s: good livelihoods that we'd like to
2999.28s: protect and we're not going to make a
3001.92s: death stand on the altar of gold no
3005.10s: asset is worth that for us and so um for
3007.74s: the vast majority of your listeners the
3009.48s: D dollarization
3011.10s: stuff is interesting we're watching it
3013.80s: far more relevant is OPEC plus and their
3017.04s: market share in the oil sector and their
3019.68s: ability to affect prices which is the
3021.66s: subject of the piece this morning and
3023.16s: how China is sort of taking the place of
3025.74s: the United States in the Middle East
3027.78s: um they're far more likely that a world
3030.24s: would exist where because of um you know
3033.00s: the ESG movement in the Western World
3034.50s: oil production and capital Investments
3036.54s: are nowhere near what they should be
3038.10s: OPEC gets control over the market
3040.26s: pricing power and they use it because
3041.94s: historically they already have the era
3045.00s: of 100 oil regardless of the economic uh
3047.94s: you know recession slash expansion macro
3050.76s: analysis that you might want where the
3053.10s: floor price of oil might be 100 that's
3054.90s: far more relevant to the average
3057.00s: listener this podcast than the
3059.40s: detolorization phenomenon and we could
3061.62s: be wrong
3062.76s: um there's no question that um the US
3065.58s: dollar is still very dominant it's it it
3068.10s: it's going to take a lot more than
3071.10s: what we're seeing in the news flow now
3072.78s: with the dollar to be meaningfully
3075.06s: dethroned from its position especially
3077.94s: if your benchmark is an average U.S
3080.76s: citizen listening to this podcast who
3083.76s: only has ever operated in US Dollars I
3085.92s: this is to me OPEC plus is potential
3088.80s: control over the energy markets it's far
3091.44s: more impactful in the short to medium
3093.72s: term than the dollarization phenomena
3096.42s: yeah it's it it's so fascinating to
3099.72s: listen to you because there's you and I
3101.16s: have never talked before
3102.66s: um but a lot of a lot of the way you
3105.42s: view things I find is kind of
3108.06s: it's very similar to a way that in uh in
3111.06s: my Layman's World much less
3113.40s: sophisticated of uh approach than you
3115.86s: but I I come to similar conclusions
3119.04s: um another kind of dovetail question
3122.10s: specifically off of China
3124.82s: I just from I'm still in the Marine
3127.56s: Corps Reserves so I still follow kind of
3130.10s: geopolitics pretty closely and whatnot
3132.20s: and the the Silk Road in general and you
3136.02s: know just China's expansion policy
3137.52s: essentially infrastructure expansion
3138.72s: policy has been like really effective do
3141.66s: you think that that continues I don't
3144.18s: know if you guys go that far into that
3145.80s: side of things it sounds like you might
3147.30s: at least touch it but I I'm curious your
3149.88s: thoughts on that
3151.20s: yeah I'd recommend
3153.36s: um
3154.22s: listeners and viewers buy a book called
3157.32s: confessions of an economic Hitman
3159.72s: and um I'll I'll pull up the book and
3163.08s: get the author's name who escapes me
3164.34s: right now while I'm talking to you but
3166.20s: um The Playbook that China's running
3168.12s: right now is essentially the same
3169.92s: Playbook that the US ran in the
3171.42s: post-world War II era
3173.40s: um and
3174.60s: um
3175.26s: you know that this is sort of what
3177.24s: happens as sort of the the new Global
3179.16s: superpower um begins to ascend in the
3181.08s: old one in the case you know when we
3182.46s: were sending you know the British
3185.10s: um
3186.00s: um you know John Perkins is the author
3188.10s: of the book
3190.50s: um and so um that's a really fantastic
3192.66s: book and if you just take that book and
3193.92s: then apply it to China today it really
3195.60s: is a great framework for understanding
3197.58s: um their motivations and I believe you
3198.96s: you're probably meant to say the Belton
3200.34s: Road initiative oh yeah sorry which is
3202.74s: the yeah the big you know the Chinese
3204.48s: macro policy of of
3207.90s: um of gaining favor with developing
3210.18s: economies by providing capital and
3211.92s: expertise to help them build out
3213.36s: infrastructure and and this is what John
3215.58s: Perkins would say is sort of being an
3217.14s: economic Hitman and of course there's a
3219.24s: price to be paid for doing that which
3220.56s: usually involves
3222.66s: um you know um subordinating your
3224.88s: Economic Policy uh and foreign policy to
3227.94s: the the whims of the of the Chinese in
3230.34s: this case but look they're they're being
3231.72s: very
3232.74s: rude about it they're being very
3234.54s: strategic about it one of the big
3236.94s: challenges that I see in the western
3238.68s: discourse is a constant underestimation
3241.32s: of the enemy so to speak right and in
3243.72s: the Marine Corps I'm sure they don't
3244.74s: teach you to assume that the person on
3246.30s: the other side of the battlefield is
3247.56s: weak dumb and incapable of fighting back
3250.08s: at the highest level you prepare for the
3252.12s: ultimate Athlete on either side of you
3253.86s: and your objective is to be that much
3255.84s: better than than the person that you're
3257.34s: about to confront and why it is that we
3260.22s: um I'll give you an example like when we
3262.20s: sanctioned Russia after uh Putin's
3264.18s: foolish invasion of Ukraine we came out
3266.10s: with a piece called on the custom of an
3267.90s: economic Singularity where we began to
3270.18s: call days after these came out that this
3271.80s: is probably not going to work it's
3272.76s: probably going to backfire honest here's
3274.62s: a here's a way to actually hurt the
3277.26s: revenue of Putin which is to not focus
3279.30s: on choking up their supply but to swamp
3282.12s: him with Supply which is how you drive
3284.04s: down price in a commodity market and
3285.96s: thus kill profits and yet by sanctioning
3289.50s: his Supply we drove the economic cost of
3291.96s: oil and gas to nosebleed Heights and and
3294.24s: there was no amount of Supply we could
3295.68s: choke off that couldn't be made up on
3297.54s: price and this was all very clear we
3300.18s: wrote it and we got crushed like
3301.80s: everyone oh you're basically we got
3303.66s: accused of being
3305.04s: um unpatriotic when in fact we were
3307.74s: trying to lay out an alternative
3309.06s: blueprint to actually obtain the
3311.76s: objectives that that are stated you know
3313.62s: and and so um
3315.90s: and so I don't know why it is that we
3317.82s: have this uh you know um
3320.22s: the perfect example is um Peter zein
3323.22s: who's an analyst that we enjoy and we
3324.96s: have obviously very different views but
3326.64s: he was saying that you know Russia has
3329.28s: no technology
3331.44s: to keep their oil and gas Fields running
3333.90s: and look at I I managed Global teams of
3337.50s: technologists around the world I
3338.58s: lectured at Chinese and Indian
3339.96s: universities I know the state of the
3343.08s: Chinese and the Indian technology sector
3344.64s: especially in the oil and gas space
3346.02s: which is critically important to them
3347.22s: and the combination of Russia China and
3350.34s: India is going to be more than capable
3352.14s: of offsetting the quote-unquote western
3353.88s: technology and all of the arrogance that
3355.80s: that phrase has embedded in it and you
3359.10s: know people were saying
3360.72s: at the onset of the sanctions that this
3362.76s: was going to you know oil and
3364.62s: gas production and you know it would go
3366.06s: to zero and this would bankrupt Putin
3367.98s: and all of that was Auto nonsense and
3370.92s: pointing that out was basically called
3373.44s: you know unpatriotic when in reality I
3375.54s: would call it realistic don't
3376.98s: underestimate the enemy overestimate the
3379.44s: enemy and be happy when you have done so
3381.18s: it was kind of a much much much better
3383.22s: way to attack a battlefield and so
3385.44s: that's sort of um when I watch what
3387.42s: China is doing
3389.04s: um I don't describe
3390.90s: um evil intent to it it's just they're
3393.54s: solving for themselves they're
3394.50s: optimizing for themselves you should
3395.70s: assume that that's what your
3396.66s: geopolitical adversaries will do right
3398.76s: think like them you know where is it in
3402.06s: uh you know uh
3403.74s: um in The Art of War where is it in that
3406.74s: book does it say
3408.18s: um you know um hand all the leverage to
3410.16s: your economic to your opponents and then
3411.84s: bemoan the fact when they use it this
3414.36s: this is not how like war is won and so
3417.06s: uh it's fascinating to see
3419.22s: um but you know that that that's sort of
3420.96s: my answer to that question
3422.28s: side note on the Art of War that's
3424.38s: actually what's underneath the
3426.00s: sabertooth cat skull right there that is
3428.34s: the Art of War
3430.20s: um it's it's interesting the I'm
3433.62s: actually really fascinated that you guys
3435.12s: had like blowback like that from that
3437.82s: kind of piece I I find people sometimes
3440.22s: can become a little too segmented in
3442.98s: their thoughts because the other thing
3444.78s: that I like to remind people about with
3446.88s: China is that they they're they're a
3450.96s: long-term country right they're big and
3454.02s: they're old real old but they're making
3457.38s: at least as far as my again very
3460.02s: drastically uneducated opinion goes what
3462.90s: I'm seeing it's long-term initiatives
3465.96s: that they're expecting to cash in on 50
3468.48s: years from now maybe less but they're
3470.70s: setting kind of a much larger footprint
3473.46s: and sometimes I feel like that escapes
3475.92s: the near-term focus at least the
3478.02s: perceived near-term Focus that I have of
3479.94s: the US I I question sometimes the way
3482.34s: that we do things but to your point it's
3483.84s: not because I don't love the US and it's
3485.64s: not because I don't love my country
3486.90s: obviously it's the inverse it's because
3488.52s: I'm concerned
3490.44s: um yeah so I would say that your
3491.76s: strength is your weakness
3493.68s: um and so the Chinese ability to think
3496.32s: long term flows in part from the fact
3498.12s: that they run a very
3499.64s: disciplined and violent dictatorship
3504.66s: and so they can think in 10 or 20 or 30
3506.88s: years because they don't have to face
3509.52s: the populace and that has its strengths
3512.04s: they can think long term and it has its
3513.90s: weaknesses which means
3515.64s: their internal economy has far less you
3517.98s: know uh Dynamic elements to it in the
3520.26s: way that the US economy does and more
3521.76s: capitalistic economies do and our
3523.92s: strength being a a relatively Dynamic
3526.74s: Capital market system is also our
3528.96s: weakness because our political leaders
3530.52s: are forced to be
3533.84s: held to shorter and shorter short-term
3536.70s: measures and and and and so
3540.00s: um it's not a
3541.80s: this is not a
3543.96s: an attribute that is derived to sort of
3546.42s: race or to you know
3548.34s: um to being Chinese or being American I
3550.86s: think this is a consequence of the
3552.42s: political and economic systems that
3554.52s: these two countries have separately
3556.02s: through their own unique history
3558.54s: um have arrived at and so
3561.18s: um and so you know the American system
3563.46s: in the Chinese system should be compared
3565.32s: not the sort of Chinese people and the
3566.76s: American people because we're all
3567.84s: products of the system that we are born
3569.88s: and raised in of course
