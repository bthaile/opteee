0.64s: what's up outliers if you are not using
2.76s: AI as a Trader you are so far behind the
5.44s: ball the goal of this video is to walk
7.28s: you through a No Frills tutorial on how
10.96s: to use AI as an options Trader as you
14.04s: can see that there's three steps we're
15.48s: going to go over right above my head
17.64s: then I'm going to walk you through a
19.08s: list of prompts to give you some ideas
22.48s: for how to approach this thing we're
24.64s: going to talk about comparing different
27.60s: AI tools and then we're going to spend
30.72s: time doing an actual practical
32.84s: application Together live I'm going to
35.40s: go through without anything
37.80s: pre-generated so that you can see how to
40.08s: do this alongside me and as you know I
41.96s: don't edit my videos so this will be
44.16s: straight all the way through what's up
45.80s: everyone Eric here welcome back to the
47.28s: outliers let's talk about this so AI is
51.12s: literally changing everything it
52.88s: accelerates quite literally everything
54.80s: you do but you have to be thoughtful
57.80s: about how you approach this thing
59.16s: because it's very easy to get lost in
60.96s: the sauce and go all over the place so
62.80s: we're going to start with always a
65.24s: template just like in the Marine Corps
67.28s: we tend to start with what we call an
69.64s: orientation this is a landscape analysis
72.28s: this is where you provide an overview of
74.92s: what things look like as they sit today
78.60s: this is normally after we do something
80.12s: called reconnaissance well we're going
81.68s: to do all the same things just in a
83.96s: slightly different Less Fun sense but
86.84s: all still very cool so before we start
91.72s: anything we have to start thinking
94.16s: through what we do as Traders what are
97.68s: the tasks we perform what are the steps
101.28s: we take to do things how do we find
103.24s: ideas where do we conduct our research
105.76s: these are just things to have in the
106.80s: back of your mind because as we go
108.76s: through the step on prompt
110.76s: engineering understanding what you do
113.40s: and then some of the capabilities will
115.52s: then inform how you might phrase things
119.00s: now it's important to understand that AI
121.96s: is not omnipotent it very frequently is
124.84s: wrong so you have absolutely got to be
128.44s: still the ultimate decision maker the
131.24s: thinking part of things the way to look
134.44s: at AI is that is an accelerator it is
137.44s: not the end all Beall it will say things
140.36s: very confidently that sometimes are
142.12s: wrong so you have to be ready to fact
144.56s: check what you're seeing to make sure
146.36s: that you're comfortable with the
147.40s: responses that you're getting there's a
149.36s: couple ways we can go about that which
150.72s: we'll talk about now landscape analysis
153.88s: this is where we have a chance to take a
155.84s: look at different AI tools as they exist
159.20s: and what they're capable of so again my
162.84s: preference is not to answer things for
164.96s: you but help you figure out how to
167.20s: answer things for yourselves and we can
169.80s: jump into Google we can throw into
171.40s: something like AI comparison chart or AI
174.16s: comparison or whatever you want I just
175.68s: grab two of them from literally the top
177.84s: I think I normally skip the top one cuz
179.84s: normally assume that it's a sponsored
182.44s: post go to the second one and I haven't
184.80s: looked through this yet but you can see
186.56s: that it absolutely is giving you some
189.72s: highlevel overview of all of these
192.08s: different language models and then same
194.36s: thing for this one we can see what
196.16s: different tools exist and what they can
197.80s: do so things like Chachi PT and llama
202.40s: definitely are a little more diverse now
206.72s: to give you the cheat code version of
209.12s: all this for I personally like to use is
211.88s: actually what you see on the thumbnail I
213.92s: like to use chat GPT for General
216.52s: reasoning and back and forth dialogue I
219.84s: like to use perplexity for researching
222.72s: things in terms of I want you to go find
225.08s: research on this or provide background
229.00s: studies on this perplexity is good at
231.36s: that and then I like to use grock for
234.20s: what happened in the stock market today
236.36s: look through um X and look through Wall
241.12s: Street bets and see what the most
243.08s: commonly talked about tickers were that
245.40s: kind of stuff now part of this is you
247.84s: just have to Tinker figure out what you
249.36s: like there are other tools like Claude
252.36s: which can really help with things like
255.28s: programming which is one of the
256.84s: accelerators that we'll talk about the
259.12s: main note is you have to start with this
263.64s: process understanding the landscape
265.56s: meaning what tools there are what their
267.52s: capabilities and limitations are
270.24s: so that you know when you're going
271.92s: through and you're doing your prompting
273.52s: you can find things that work best again
275.96s: I already gave you the cliffnotes
277.28s: version of what I found to work so far
280.12s: I'll use chat GPT for reasoning and
282.12s: that's kind of my go-to unless I'm doing
283.84s: something like research let's now move
286.92s: on to the execution step how do we use
290.80s: them well first after we go through the
294.32s: information we find in Step One what I
297.28s: think makes sense is to think about
300.64s: those things that you do as a Trader and
302.72s: create categories so here are some
305.36s: categories to get your mind started
307.16s: learning for a lot of people learning
310.12s: how to trade learning how to be better
312.44s: Traders is a significant Focus so that's
316.48s: the very first thing you can use AI for
319.36s: it can be your teacher to look at news
323.84s: for you to synthesize the markets as
326.80s: they sit to synthesize economic data as
329.84s: it's coming out for General analysis the
333.40s: next one here is researching so you can
336.12s: start thinking through maybe I want to
338.24s: run a strategy that does this it can
340.84s: help you with that helping you build a
343.88s: trading plan strategy outlines log
348.12s: developments this is what you will find
350.32s: on my YouTube channel and I have videos
352.72s: about creating trading plans and stuff
354.60s: like that creating strategies I have all
356.52s: of this stuff for you but you can use AI
359.76s: to help you frame your ideas think
362.20s: through different ways to set up how you
363.80s: want things to sit and then one of my
366.32s: favorite ways to use it is as a process
369.24s: auditor one of the really big things
371.52s: that I'm a massive advocate of is
373.56s: external audits this is where you
375.36s: provide information to somebody that's
377.00s: not yourself to take an objective look
379.28s: through what you're doing what you're
380.56s: thinking how you're processing things
382.68s: and not necessarily to give you direct
384.64s: feedback although that's always great
386.28s: but even just to ask you questions why
388.16s: are you doing it this way why are you
389.60s: doing it this way that can be a really
391.80s: beneficial process just from a general
393.92s: learning
395.04s: perspective so now that we know what AI
398.52s: can help us with we know what kind of AI
400.56s: tools there are we know how the
403.40s: different AI tools
405.24s: behave we know the different areas that
408.24s: we want to use AI to help us well now we
411.40s: get into the process of actually using
413.88s: AI so I want to walk you through prompt
415.64s: engineering at a high level I'm going to
417.60s: walk you through some basic prompts and
418.96s: then we're literally going to go into
420.56s: the PRACK app right after that now one
422.84s: other AI tool that I did not list that I
425.28s: do think is worth your time especially
427.04s: if you use Google is Gemini because one
429.44s: of the cool things about Gemini is you
431.00s: can use it in conjunction with all of
434.36s: the files that you have on Google Drive
437.28s: so I have a giant category of research
440.28s: that I've downloaded from all different
441.92s: places like ssrn and I literally can use
444.76s: Gemini to query against all of it at
446.84s: once which is insanely useful and for
450.96s: those that are in the outlier Pro
452.88s: patreon you already have a file with all
455.32s: of those different studies and you
457.12s: literally can do the same thing it's one
459.12s: of the cool things about Gemini's
461.56s: integration it's just something you
463.24s: should be aware of all right so let's
465.16s: get into prompt
467.68s: engineering prompt engineering is an
469.76s: iterative process sometimes you're going
471.20s: to ask it things or tell it to do things
473.08s: and it's not going to do what you want
474.32s: or it's going to give you different
475.28s: results and you have to coach it so
478.60s: think of it not as whatever you get is
481.20s: the answer but be ready to walk it onto
484.36s: Target so that it actually is giving you
487.12s: the information you need you have to be
489.72s: very very thoughtful in how you're
492.60s: phrasing things you're literally talking
494.32s: to a robot so don't be lazy in your
498.28s: language don't take it as it's going to
501.36s: understand anything that you're saying
503.60s: the subtext of what you're trying to
505.64s: teach it now one of the things that's
507.56s: useful is some provide a space where it
511.52s: can learn you and then over time it can
514.04s: become more efficient which is actually
515.88s: very helpful you should always use it to
519.80s: teach you what to ask it so you can
523.12s: start a process and then you could be
525.56s: stuck and you could say huh I don't know
528.44s: what to ask yet so you could say give me
531.16s: five questions you think I should ask
532.52s: you next that kind of thing and then
535.56s: another thing that's super important is
537.20s: always make it give you sources again
539.52s: this is so that you can verify what it's
541.24s: giving you because it's not always going
543.24s: to be correct actually very frequently
545.00s: unfortunately it'll have errors so here
547.84s: are a list of prompts and if you'll
550.44s: notice that these prompts are actually
552.20s: tied to these categories over here guess
555.04s: what I did I went into perplexity and I
559.92s: said create a list of five questions for
563.80s: each of these topics I'm not going
566.72s: through all these with you I'm just
568.08s: showing you an idea on how you can use
570.28s: it and then these should give you some
572.44s: inspiration but I actually want to move
574.96s: to the practical application part of
576.92s: this because I think that's what's going
578.00s: to be most useful to you so I want to go
582.76s: through each of these at a very high
585.48s: level to give you ideas on what you can
588.04s: ask how you can ask it so that you can
590.48s: get the information that you want so
593.00s: first things first is to Prime the AI so
597.04s: this is the only question I asked in
598.52s: this chain as you can tell I'm scrolling
599.84s: up scrolling down this is in perplexity
602.08s: one of the things that I like about
603.32s: perplexity is that you can tell it to
605.64s: use different AI engines so right now
608.88s: even though I'm in perplexity I'm
610.72s: actually using chat GPT Omni so the
615.04s: first thing I tell it is I'm an options
617.28s: Trader you are going to perform all
619.28s: these functions for me are you ready to
621.48s: rock and roll this was more just to much
624.52s: just for fun asking if it's ready to
626.08s: rock and roll so let's start let's say
629.52s: that we are a new options Trader and we
631.44s: are trying to learn how to trade options
634.88s: let's use AI to assist with this now if
638.80s: you're an advanced Trader you literally
640.96s: can apply the same thing what you we're
642.60s: all learning so the only difference is
645.20s: the question you ask might be slightly
647.52s: different and we'll go through two
648.48s: variations to give you two different
650.68s: levels beginner and advance so let's say
654.00s: I'm a new options
656.52s: Trader looking to learn more
659.80s: about options and how they
664.08s: work create an
666.92s: outline similar to a class
673.24s: syllabus on what you think I should
677.20s: focus
678.92s: on use units and topics for each
685.36s: unit see what it says so you can see I'm
689.68s: and I'm actually purposely making this A
691.24s: little sloppy right I'm not this isn't
693.56s: that descriptive but let's see what it
696.04s: comes up with and it's actually exactly
698.12s: what I want so it's giving me a general
701.04s: unit for the topic and then subtopics
703.56s: for each so now what I want to do is
707.48s: scroll through this it looks okay and I
710.36s: want this to be more comprehensive make
712.60s: this more indepth and include outlines
717.68s: for each
721.52s: subtopic and
723.68s: item so now I'm telling it to go deeper
726.60s: I want it to be further in depth and I
730.20s: want it to give me more information
732.60s: about each of these so so far this is
735.48s: giving me a perfect outline so what I do
739.84s: after this once it
742.84s: finishes I'm going to tell it to create
747.76s: lessons for all topics in unit one
751.60s: create lesson create a lesson for
757.76s: 1.1 and I didn't do all just because
759.84s: it'll take a little
761.36s: while so now I'm literally having it
764.28s: teach
766.04s: me it's teaching me pretty cool
769.64s: huh now after you go through learning
773.16s: about the basics of options like this as
775.68s: with any class you've ever taken we need
779.28s: to verify what we
780.29s: [Music]
781.60s: learned help me verify
785.08s: what I've
787.12s: learned Create a
791.52s: quiz with 10 multiple
794.48s: choice 10 true
798.00s: false
800.28s: five
801.96s: paragraph or five scenario based
809.64s: open
812.24s: responses and one deeper case
816.92s: study with a more
820.56s: comprehensive
824.36s: response prepare an answer key but do
828.88s: not show it to
831.44s: me until I
834.44s: ask now we can use chat GPT
839.56s: to help us verify what we've learned
843.52s: after what it just gave us now there's
846.48s: other really cool prompts you can do
848.24s: with this once it finishes going through
850.84s: this and the point that I'm trying to
854.52s: illustrate here is this is literally
859.16s: restricted only by your
860.96s: imagination and something that I'm
863.84s: building right now for the patreon folks
866.04s: is a really big list of prompt
870.44s: the cool part is you don't need that you
872.28s: literally can make your own using this
874.24s: it's just a process of iterating and
877.56s: thinking of different things you can ask
878.92s: it so here it is it's giving us our
881.44s: multiple choice questions it's giving us
883.88s: our true false questions it's giving us
885.76s: our scenario based questions and then
887.60s: it's giving us an actual case study so
891.24s: there we go so now if you're a more
893.88s: advanced options Trader maybe we're
897.24s: trying to learn how to build out our own
899.52s: volatility surface so let's switch this
902.76s: up I'm an
904.96s: advanced options
908.32s: Trader and want to build my own
912.36s: volatility surface
918.20s: model walk me through how to build
923.44s: one in could be Excel python whatever
927.08s: you want and we'll start with Excel
931.88s: so you can see even as a more seasoned
935.04s: investor you can have it walk you
937.84s: through slightly more complex data
941.32s: points so that you can create your very
945.88s: own surface model if you were so
947.92s: inclined so this is learning now I
951.00s: already told you that I like to use
952.96s: grock for news and market analysis but
955.08s: let's just stick in here for now and
957.32s: let's start with something basic like
958.68s: some
961.56s: sumarize the stock market news for today
966.84s: include any key economic data
973.40s: points um US based
979.92s: news trending
982.61s: [Music]
983.72s: individual
985.40s: stocks cryptocurrencies
992.72s: and upcoming events for
997.08s: tomorrow now what I've definitely
999.36s: noticed is I like to input dates now so
1002.48s: 16 D 24 because a lot of times it will
1006.64s: mess up on the dates so now first we're
1010.68s: just giving it a a general thing we
1012.92s: haven't given it a format we haven't
1014.48s: really told it what we want it to do and
1017.48s: this is how it summarized in it which so
1019.84s: far this looks good so we can see it's
1022.52s: talking about avgo Nvidia paler smci
1026.20s: dropping 12 points which is kind of
1027.80s: funny and this looks completely fine for
1032.16s: a summary but you can have it go further
1036.04s: in depth so let's say that we wanted to
1039.80s: track US manufacturing PMI we could have
1043.92s: it give us historic PMI figures or we
1047.08s: can open up the source that shows it to
1050.28s: us and go find it for ourself what I
1053.00s: like to do is outline a specific
1055.84s: template that I want it to use and I
1060.20s: tell it to save it so I can tell it
1063.12s: remember this format as stock market
1067.48s: update for today we'll throw that in
1071.04s: quotes for
1072.16s: it and we're essentially telling you
1074.12s: remember the the format now sometimes
1077.92s: it'll save it sometimes it'll go through
1080.36s: and run the analysis again like it's
1082.12s: doing right now but now when I ask it
1085.88s: again it will default to that now again
1088.56s: depending on if you use GPT which is
1090.08s: very good at this use perplexity it's a
1092.40s: little less Remember full so I just save
1096.84s: the actual prompts that I want and then
1098.44s: I can just copy and paste them in okay
1100.32s: so now let's check out researching an
1102.12s: idea so let's say I want to trade
1105.64s: earnings releases with options
1109.64s: help me build a
1113.12s: strategy
1114.96s: first
1117.68s: research first find any
1121.48s: research regarding trading options
1125.72s: around earnings and summarize the key
1130.28s: themes for
1132.60s: me We're Off to the Races now if you
1135.36s: don't know about a specific thing that
1136.96s: you might want to do like this you could
1138.20s: zoom it up and you could say I'm
1139.96s: interested in trading options give me
1143.24s: ideas on how I can trade options for
1148.76s: blank trade options for things going up
1151.52s: trade options for things going down
1152.88s: trade options for earnings trade
1154.32s: volatility so this is walking you
1156.76s: through with citations from different
1159.60s: places about what happens around
1163.80s: earnings and how you can place different
1167.20s: ideas next one
1170.08s: now that we know that there's an effect
1171.72s: around earnings that we might want to
1173.56s: trade let's say I wanted to create a
1177.88s: strategy outline for me to test to trade
1183.68s: options
1185.40s: around the IV
1190.56s: contraction of
1195.48s: earnings so now I'm having it skip us
1198.48s: down to this I'm having it going to
1200.80s: outline a strategy for us to test now
1203.08s: notice I say for me to test because you
1205.08s: should not take whatever whatever it
1207.28s: gives you that's not good we need it to
1210.88s: give us some ideas like this but then
1214.80s: we're going to have to test it so then
1216.72s: that's actually the next step I'm going
1218.88s: to have it outline a trade log template
1224.52s: for Excel that I can use to test this
1231.24s: strategy so now I don't even have to
1233.24s: think about what format might make sense
1234.96s: in Excel if I don't know how to do it I
1237.04s: can have it give me something to start
1240.84s: with and there you
1243.32s: go notice how it gives you specifically
1247.24s: the elements that are most important for
1249.96s: the trade itself now we can also have it
1253.56s: build me a pre-trade checklist
1259.00s: that applies to all trades I
1264.80s: place then for this specific
1269.24s: strategy
1270.80s: build the unique
1275.36s: things I should
1277.48s: check before
1279.68s: entering the trade so what I'm doing is
1282.76s: I'm having it build a standardized trade
1286.00s: checklist that I canly to everything and
1288.20s: I'm having it build the specific things
1291.60s: that matter for this individual strategy
1293.48s: CU that's exactly what I do in my own
1296.12s: stuff I have a standardized template for
1297.80s: pre- checklist I don't fill it out
1299.32s: anymore it's kind of mental but then for
1301.32s: each individual strategy that I have
1303.16s: there are things that are specific to
1305.48s: the strategy itself and notice how it's
1307.56s: finding the specific things that matter
1310.36s: to the strategy
1312.12s: itself perfect so now let's ask it for
1315.40s: this last
1316.88s: part process it can be done in a lot of
1319.60s: different ways you can upload documents
1321.80s: to it you can explain out a trade that
1326.24s: you put on in detail and ask it for
1329.28s: points of feedback so process audit has
1333.08s: everything to do with using it to help
1335.76s: you optimize what you're doing so let's
1339.40s: say for my
1342.52s: earnings
1345.08s: strategy
1346.88s: evaluate the process
1349.36s: as it sits and give me ideas on how I
1354.04s: can improve
1356.60s: it so now I'm having it literally audit
1360.60s: what it gave me pretending that you know
1363.20s: I made up elements of it and it's
1366.44s: literally giving me very specific
1368.76s: actionable things that I can do to make
1372.04s: this better so I can look at better
1374.40s: historical data analysis which is really
1376.40s: good analyzing expected Move versus AC
1378.68s: move which is super important this is
1381.64s: literally exactly how you can use this
1384.52s: so there are so many opportunities the
1387.68s: last thing I want to show you is
1390.32s: this what other questions should I ask
1394.28s: you about the earnings
1400.12s: strategy so I'm literally teaching it or
1403.40s: telling it to tell me what I should ask
1406.12s: it AKA teaching myself to know what I
1409.04s: don't
1410.92s: know so it's giving me a exactly one of
1415.60s: the that's why I'm smiling one of the
1416.68s: first questions I think is important to
1417.96s: ask is when should I enter it's telling
1421.04s: you you could have it then go down this
1424.16s: thread of teach me more about the
1426.52s: timing take time Tinker with this this
1429.68s: is probably the biggest accelerator
1431.96s: that's right in front of you this has
1434.84s: the ability to literally transform a
1438.68s: regular Traders approach into something
1440.76s: that's much closer to a professional
1443.04s: with very little effort it'll never
1445.84s: replace the experience but I wish I had
1449.12s: this as always if there's any questions
1451.20s: anything you want me to talk about make
1452.64s: a video on let me know be an outlier
1454.28s: I'll see you later
