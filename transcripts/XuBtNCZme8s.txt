0.00s: What's up outliers? Just wrapped up a live stream talking about the recent options activity
6.00s: in GameStop making a quick video to recap everything that we talked about because it was
11.00s: a lot. So today we saw the continuation of some really interesting short put behavior
20.32s: in GameStop that's worth talking about. Now first, I want to show you this. This was actually
26.52s: in a post I made earlier that is the perfect starting point. And you'll notice the overall
33.36s: size of option premium both call input. That's what the green and red squiggly lines are
41.00s: here. And if you just notice the last two days, what do you see? You see a very severe
50.84s: line, meaning they go much wider than the others, which is the overall premiums. And
57.36s: you see that they're stacked together in the last couple days. So what you can conclude
62.08s: from this is that there have been a pretty significant amount of put premium in the last
70.92s: two days. And you conclude that most of it is been sold. So in a vacuum, when we see
77.80s: that we often will think sold put bullish trade, you can't conclude that here yet. It's
83.48s: way too early. And the other thing is you have to remember the counter parties to stuff
88.92s: like this will have this position as part of a total portfolio. We don't know what else
96.68s: is in the portfolio, which is really important because we don't know how this fits in with
102.52s: things, whether it's actually bullish bearish offsetting delta's that kind of stuff. Now,
107.20s: let's focus on the positions in a vacuum. And again, I got hit up a lot on the activity
112.00s: today, but I think it's worth noting for everybody that the activity started yesterday at a
117.24s: different strike here. It started at the 95s. And then it wound at the 105s. So let's take
123.08s: a look at what's going on. First things first, we need to take a click into what's going
129.36s: on as far as volume and open interest. So if we take a look at the highest volume contracts
135.92s: on the day, we can clearly see that the 125s out in 2025 are getting busy. But if you take a
143.60s: look at the price on these, they're actually really cheap, right? 17 cents. So the total volume
148.40s: of 6,000 contracts is still heavy, but it's not that not that much in terms of premium adjusted
154.96s: size. That's different when you go down here. The 105 puts that are 253 days out. They're trading
162.32s: around the 79 handle in terms of premium. And the volume here seems small, right? 2700 contracts,
170.08s: right? Not like a ton of volume. However, when you adjust this based on premium, they're actually
175.92s: pretty big trades. So if we take a look here and we just size up some of the premiums that have
184.00s: been rolling through, you can see that the trades that came through today were in blocks of like 23,
190.72s: 24, 25 in the 20 handles. Almost all of these are 95 delta plus effectively a one delta.
199.36s: And the premiums ranged, you know, around 170 to 190 anywhere in there. These are the 125s
208.96s: that came in at the offer, by the way, not the 105s. These are the ones that we're looking at
212.24s: primarily today. So one of the interesting artifacts that we see is that these got slammed all day.
220.56s: And again, it wasn't just the 105s. It also came in at the 100s all out in the January 2026
230.64s: experee. So this started in the morning, right? 7 a.m. or so. And you can see for both the 100s
237.76s: and the 105s, they just got slammed all day, literally all day. And if we take a peek into this,
245.04s: you can see the distribution of where the average feels were and where the volume was. And you
250.40s: can see what the total premium traded today was in these was about 21.2 mil. So what I did was
257.28s: take a look at this doesn't matter. I took a look at both the 95s and the 105s. And I just wanted
263.52s: to analyze a little bit what might be going on. So we can see what the total current delta's
270.96s: for both of these positions, their short puts. So it means they're long delta's.
276.16s: This overwhelmingly looks like a synthetic stock position. Now a question on the live stream was,
282.00s: well, why would they sell premium and volatility was so low? There's a lot of reasons why not,
287.84s: but it amounts to what's not for that reason. It's a synthetic stock position. So what this means
294.56s: is we're trying to control shares of game stop without buying the shares outright. And there can be
299.60s: a bunch of different reasons why that might be the case from regulatory requirements to simply
304.80s: capital efficiency. Because you can see that the total position here or the 105s, for example,
312.08s: won't went through today. The total current delta's on that is a little over 200,000 again. I
317.60s: didn't give it the total volume for today because there could be other people involved. I was
324.32s: involved in some of it just trading the order flow. So they probably are the lion's share,
328.88s: but I don't know how much of the total size. So I'm just estimating here. So you can see what the
332.80s: total current delta represents with how far in the money they are. It's 213,750 shares. That
338.00s: means that this position is going to behave like that number of shares. The total maximum position
343.12s: is 225,000. So about 10,000 shares short of what this could be if it was a true one delta.
350.08s: You can see what the credit was. This is the margin requirement for a regular, not a regulation
356.00s: but a portfolio margin account. And again, if this is an institution, they can get even way better
362.56s: margining rates than this. But what this is effectively saying is per contract, one lot,
369.12s: you have to put up $2,600. And it's essentially cash securing it because it's so far in the money.
375.68s: That's again still for a Regtie account. But it's 2602. Now, if you were to buy the equivalent number
386.24s: of shares at this size, meaning you decided to buy all of the same position size, you'll see that
395.44s: I added another column. This is the share equivalent at the strike price. This is the spot equivalent
402.48s: if the same size went on today. And the same size going on today, you can tell it's about the same
409.60s: price because they're effectively making you cash secure the position because it's so far in
413.20s: the money. Now, if you wanted to transact at the strike prices, though 105 and the 95, some people
418.56s: were postulating, well, maybe they're trying to sell shares at those levels. Well, the equivalent
424.40s: stock position at those points would be 23,000, 23,000 plus. So this overall just looks like a
433.28s: synthetic stock position. Now, why is it with one leg versus two legs? That's another great question
438.48s: that we don't really know the answer to. It doesn't lie in some sort of annual return yield on
444.48s: the premium because they're so little premium collected on these and they're so deep in the money,
448.96s: the overwhelming majority of the credit here is intrinsic value. So it's not that as the case,
457.76s: it likely falls something more wrapped around regulatory requirements and the desire to build
463.44s: a synthetic long because they did collect a lot of premium. Now, again, this is mostly intrinsic
467.84s: value. So if the underlying stays anywhere around where it is, this is effectively going to be given
474.80s: back. Another thing to pay attention to that I got as a question was, well, does this mean somebody
480.88s: thinks that the stock is going to go up to 105 and 95? And the answer is no, not inherently. The thing
488.08s: to remember is that this position here effectively is going to behave like long stock. So here's what
496.32s: that means in context and I'll draw it out for you. So what ends up happening when you have a delta
506.32s: effectively of one, let's say spot price right now is 26 and again, our strike price list is
512.32s: called 100. We'll just use the midpoint between these and some people who say it doesn't mean I have
517.84s: to go to that. It doesn't because because the delta is so high, the delta is essentially one.
525.04s: That means that if GameStop goes up $5, let's say it goes up to 31. What ends up happening is the
531.76s: current credit for these trades and again, let's just call it 75 or 74. I'm just taking the midpoint
539.52s: between these. So your current credit of 74, that's where you're at down here at spot price. Your
548.24s: current premium is 74, but average premium. And let's say it goes up to 31. It goes up five points.
556.64s: Well, because this is essentially all intrinsic value, what this means is if this is actually
562.00s: going to decay to 69 and it's not because of the passage of time, it's not because of
566.40s: altilities contracting. It's because this has a delta again of one. So as this move, your again,
573.52s: delta shows you the rate of change of an options premium per one point move in the underlying. So
577.84s: in this case, if the underlying moves five points because you have essentially a delta of one,
581.52s: your premium is going to move by five points. So that means that you net this $5 difference
587.12s: that otherwise happened in the underlying, you get it from the option. Now, there is a little bit
592.32s: of a liquidity component to this that might be a little bit challenging, but it's not a huge
596.96s: position as far as the number of contracts. It's just large in terms of the overall size.
604.08s: And again, you can see that this is a pretty meaningful size position that went on in total.
611.44s: So because of this, it does seem to me like a synthetic long. Another question that came up is
619.60s: like, is this some sort of way to pass the buck or pass the losses if this is some sort of legacy
626.00s: short onto the market maker? And the short answer is no. Because what ends up happening is you
631.76s: would reconcile the P&L on the short position. You would then reconcile the P&L on the options
636.88s: position. And because the options are so far in the money, what ends up happening is let's say you
641.68s: exercise and you're selling at these prices. Well, it means buying at these prices, I should say.
649.04s: But if your short shares, they would be canceling each other out. So what ends up happening is you,
655.68s: there's not really a slick way to weasel your way out of a loss. So otherwise, everybody would do
661.04s: that right? If there is a way to come out ahead in that kind of transaction, but in this case,
665.28s: there really isn't. So now the game is to see how this option flow sustains. Do we continue to see
673.52s: this kind of behavior tomorrow and the continue build out of the position? Because one of the things I
677.92s: noticed when I was looking at the option flow specifically for yesterday, the 95s was a little
685.44s: bit different than today for the 95s. If you look, the 95s, they started their activity around midday,
693.36s: but they ran all the way up directly to the close. Whereas if you take a look at the activity
701.12s: from today versus yesterday, today they started closer to the open and ran most of the day, but
709.28s: stopped before the close. So it looks like as of yesterday, the position wasn't fully put on that
715.28s: might have been desired compared to what might be on now. So this could be the terminal position
719.92s: size. We will absolutely know tomorrow if we continue to see the activity. So really, really
726.48s: interesting trading activity and game stop. If we take a quick look at the price behavior,
733.92s: it's rolling over, hanging out kind of sideways here. And if we poke into the options chain really
740.00s: quick, you can see that the call volume today was actually pretty heavy, 81,000 against 15,000
744.96s: puts. So it definitely got way more activated. And of interest, we're now seeing this volume again
751.76s: centered in the front expiration, which is again, quite interesting. Now you can see those puts
758.56s: that we talked about here. And you can also see those other puts that people aren't really talking
762.96s: about, but did happen at the 100s. So you had the 95s yesterday, you had some 90s. And then
770.48s: you also had the 100s today, which got overlooked massively because of what happened at the 105s. But
776.08s: the 100s are also part of this equation. So the vault curve here in terms of the volatility
782.64s: surface is relatively mellow. Once you get that far out on a relative basis, right? So you can
791.44s: see literally just the raw difference between the height and how much vault is in these on a
797.04s: relative basis. So it doesn't look like some sort of relative vault volatility play, anything like
803.36s: that. This looks like synthetic long shares to me. So as always, if you have any questions, let me know,
809.20s: be an outlier. See you all later.
