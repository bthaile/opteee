0.00s: What's up, outliers? Welcome back to the outlier podcast.
5.00s: I'm a friend, Duneberg, and the timing for this is beautiful because as per usual, there's
10.68s: no shortage of crazy things going on. I always find my inability to fill out the stock market
18.44s: and economic bingo cards to be pretty hilarious. I never really get that far. How's the year
24.64s: starting off for you?
26.12s: Well, it must be said that Donald Trump is nothing if not fantastic for the newsletter business.
32.24s: I was joking with my wife about that because it's like to your exact point, if nothing else,
40.32s: you have no shortage of constant streams of clips of things to talk about because I was watching
47.84s: him signing like a bunch of different executive orders and he's given like a press conference
52.44s: while he's signing these things.
53.44s: You know, we have a good friend, Sir JJ over at Market Fives, a new sub stack. I like
59.32s: a lot. He's an old school trader 50 years in the pit. And a recent piece that he published
65.12s: under his master's head. He had an interesting comparison, which is FDR's fireside chats,
70.96s: you know, in a way. Trump is playing the media in the same way that FDR did, totally accessible
78.20s: to all of his faults and believe me, he has many. The man has stamina and endurance and
84.68s: is never afraid of the microphone and the contrast between four years of a staff trying
90.52s: to hide Joe Biden from the public and Donald Trump on a bashfully afraid to talk to a bunch
96.16s: of microphones that, two in the morning on a return flight from California, is really
100.76s: quite something.
102.32s: It's a stark contrast. So talk to me a little bit about from an overall lens, how the
110.52s: year is starting off were things so far in line with expectations where there are new
115.40s: injects to the mental models in terms of just how you expected things to go. And I'm not
119.96s: really isolating to one level of analysis, economic markets, political, really just anything
126.44s: in general. The main reason I'm asking it this way is that I want to get a sense from
130.80s: your paradigm. What's sticking out to you so far this year?
134.20s: Yeah, the only thing that matters is the speed and efficiency with which Trump is hitting
137.92s: the ground and smashing the opposition. Whatever your views are, whether you are a, you know,
143.00s: right leaning, left leaning, Donald Trump had four years to ponder what went wrong, how
149.00s: he quote unquote lost 2020, how his first administration was sidelined by distraction after
155.60s: distraction and perhaps sabotage from within. And he had four years to plot his revenge.
161.92s: And he ascended to the presidency on January 20th. And it is just simply undeniable that
169.04s: he is flooding the field with all manner of good policy, crazy policy, insane statements.
177.20s: The new cycle can't keep up with whatever it is he's rolling out. And you know, he's
184.32s: deputized Elon Musk to do a variety of things and he's getting his nominees through the Senate,
191.92s: making crazy statements with Netanyahu at this press conference like it. He's just a whirlwind.
198.72s: And again, whatever your views on the man or his politics or his morals, he is a tornado.
205.92s: That is, that is impacting everything. He's impacting stocks. He's impacting geopolitics.
210.32s: He's impacting war. He's impacting peace. He's impacting the tax code. He's impacting the
214.88s: federal government budget. He is just a steamroller, the likes of which the US frankly, I don't think
221.44s: has ever seen. And history will record Trump regardless of how his term ends as a tour de force.
228.80s: Whether it ends up being net positive or negative, of course, depends on future events and depends
234.72s: on your perspective coming into these events. But the man is undeniably just an energizer
241.28s: bunny of just unlike we've never seen it. Maybe it's just the contrast between what Trump would
247.84s: characterize as the sleepy Joe administration. But he just really is something to be
254.00s: hold in. Frankly, we are having trouble keeping up with it all, trying to chronicle it and trying
259.76s: to bring some sense to it. But it's nothing if not interesting to be sure.
264.48s: Yeah. So so far, you bring up a really interesting point about just how much is going on of the
271.12s: just litany of policies, executive orders, statements that are being made. Are there any specific
277.28s: items that he's been talking about that really stick out to you and if so why?
283.04s: So there's the assault on USAID, depending on your perspective. And that is really just
295.04s: going right at the juggler of the power structure of the Democratic National Committee.
299.76s: And somebody gave Trump really good advice before he came into the presidency a second time
304.64s: around. So there's the proactive things he's actually doing. And look, that's a scandal. Like I
308.80s: mean, I think that is is really going to be a major story for months to come. As we see all
315.60s: of these foreign quote unquote newspapers and media outlets, something going on a business because
320.24s: they were actually just paid fronts of the Democratic Party of the United States. Opposition,
327.60s: media and Hungary, for example, is just one example where Victor Orbán was tweeting about recently.
332.08s: So there's the things he's doing, but then there's the things he's not doing, which I think are just
335.76s: as important and just as profound, which is what we're trying to get our hands around to write a
340.80s: few pieces on, which is he really doesn't want anything to do with Ukraine. I mean, I think this is
345.60s: Biden's war. Don't forget Trump was impeached over Ukraine in 2019. It's not like he's unaware
352.24s: of what's really going on over there and how this all came about. And he would like to just
357.20s: wash his hands of it, turn the keys over to Europe, which of course is akin to losing the war because
362.40s: there is no way in which Ukraine could sustain itself in the absence of continued US support.
367.36s: And he just doesn't actually want to talk about it. The stuff he does say when asked is mostly wrong,
375.68s: sort of indicates to us that he's not really studying the issue all that closely. It's kind of like that
381.76s: that issue in the back of your mind that you know is there that you wish would just go away as you
385.28s: don't spend much time thinking about it, which is sort of consistent with Trump's personality,
388.72s: because he gravitates towards winning and strength and all of those things like we're losing that war,
393.28s: NATO will lose that war, Russia will win that war. And he's kind of just trying to drop the bags
398.56s: on Europe. And one of the pieces we're working on right now is how you know this amazing
404.64s: interview that Marco Rubio gave with Megan Kelly where he all but says that the US will retreat to a
411.52s: sphere of influence slash you know multiple of world. There's no scenario in which the European
418.08s: Union survives an American retreat in that regard. And that's what's coming. Rubio Albutzigolet
423.68s: trumps absence of forceful you know for all the talk of I'm going to solve the war today and I'm
428.80s: going to call Putin and we're going to deal. He's done none of those things. And I don't I can
434.96s: understand why he was dealt with losing hand. We've said many times in our articles and on
440.80s: podcast appearances that one of the reasons why you avoid picking fights is you might lose them.
446.32s: And this is especially true when the when the cost of defeat is larger than the prize on offer.
451.92s: You know and so he just wants to ignore Ukraine. And every day that he ignores Ukraine you know
459.76s: the Russian army continues to sort of roll up the parts of Ukraine that it and now considers Russia.
465.84s: And so once he gets more and more desperate it's a real fiasco one for which the blame lies at
472.96s: the feet of the Biden administration to be clear. I think with a high degree of certainty that
478.24s: Trump statements that the war would not have happened if he had won in 2020 or absolutely true.
482.24s: We would not be involved in this war. And so it's not just what he's doing but what he's not doing.
487.44s: And he is really taking an assault a frontal assault on the vast waste and fraud and
497.76s: mismanagement of public money that has occurred in Washington under the auspices of both
502.56s: democratic and Republican regimes. In our view there's team DC and team Trump and DC is about to get
510.32s: rinsed. A couple of things here. The first one going back to the Ukraine war two questions.
519.92s: The first one is your hypothesizing that Russia is likely to win when you say when what does that
527.92s: mean? Like how would you define Russia winning this conflict?
531.52s: Russia will impose its objectives by military force and there is nothing that Europe or the US
538.40s: can do about it. That is my definition of winning. It will secure the quote for regions. It will
545.60s: degrade Ukraine's military capabilities. It might not be able to enforce upon Ukraine that the
551.92s: Russians that live within what's left of Ukraine get you know the rights to speak their language and
557.28s: go to church and all of those things but the broad important military objectives will be achieved
562.96s: by force which is sort of the ultimate definition of winning in a military conflict. As I'm sure
568.56s: you more than anybody would be aware. And the following one is why do you think Trump is taking such a
577.68s: passive position on it? Obviously understanding the context of being dealt kind of a difficult
582.64s: hand to work with but that also seems like a really great potential win for him and his platform.
591.20s: He doesn't have the leverage to win and Trump hates to be seen as losing. I mean I don't want to be
597.76s: like armchair psychologist but he is a relatively straightforward person to understand.
605.20s: He is I think a very empathetic person, a very patriotic person, a very bombastic person,
612.96s: he enjoys a good negotiation, the art of the deal, wrote a book on it and I think has very good
619.92s: intuition for when he is walking into a situation where he doesn't have the leverage and since he didn't
625.92s: create this situation but he only inherited it. I think the motivation, like in his first 100 days he
633.04s: wants to be seen as winning as much as possible and this is just a losing hand. And so I just think
639.36s: passive aggressively he wants to ignore it. What makes you think so much that it's a losing hand?
646.40s: I know I've been studying the day-to-day line of combat moves and what both sides are telling
653.68s: themselves internally for propaganda and body counts and all the things that you would want to
658.48s: study to get your own independent analysis of what's going on in the ground and this is very hard.
664.40s: We wrote a piece a year ago called Mapping the War and we opened that piece with the difficulty
668.96s: involved in cutting through propaganda and one of the things we have learned to do which I think
673.36s: serves us very well is we read the propaganda of all the sides because even just learning what
678.96s: they're telling each other is a very valuable input into what's possible and what's likely happening.
685.68s: And we're seeing, look it's just the mathematics of it are very clear. You have a giant country next
691.52s: to a relatively small country. You have a vast industrial machine that the West radically underestimate
699.44s: and I don't know why for centuries invading armies always underestimate the industrial capacity of
704.80s: Russia. Their supply chain is far closer to the line of combat than ours. It is viewed internally
711.60s: within Russia and is spun as much within their propaganda as an existential threat to the country.
717.36s: It's a nice to have war for us. You go to the Midwest and you go to the mall and you ask
722.08s: a hundred people do you care about your crane. I bet you wouldn't find a single yes.
726.24s: If you go to the same mall in Moscow it's an existential threat. So you have one side fighting
731.60s: it extensively, the Russians for whom their entire industrial base is right there and then the US
741.76s: through its sort of proxies in the EU with very long extended supply chains much of which has
747.04s: been outsourced to China by the way who is allied with our opponent in this war.
752.72s: If this is highlighting huge weaknesses in the US military industrial complex which I think Trump is
758.08s: is motivated to fix and in many ways this has opened the eyes of I think the Department of Defense
764.88s: which is we would sort of view Washington as the DOD largely pro Trump and CIA Wall Street largely
771.12s: not pro Biden. The DOD recognizes the holes in the supply chain doesn't really want to escalate the war
777.04s: in Ukraine and sees that it's just a fight that we can't win. We've spent how many tens of billions
784.16s: of dollars on this war and if you just go to the deep state mapping project and play the video of
793.12s: the movement of the line of combat over the last year it's very clear that it's in one way traffic.
801.04s: And so Russia's armies never been bigger it's never been better equipped. The head of NATO just admitted
808.16s: that Russia is producing three times as many weapons as the entirety of the NATO countries integrated
813.36s: by factor three. We're not going to win this war. We're not going to go to we're not going to
818.80s: resort to nuclear war. You know weapons that's pretty clear and so if one of the reasons why you don't
824.96s: pick a kinetic conflict with nuclear superpowers unless you're willing to use your nuclear weapons
830.32s: or not much use to you. So I just think writings on the wall and especially if Trump pulls away
838.00s: you know we've cut off funding and a few other things like it won't be long and and so I just think
845.92s: sometimes you just got to take the take the L and Trump is probably willing to take that L
850.88s: because by the way it's very hard like how would you win this war from here if you were in charge
855.20s: Eric I'd be curious like I don't see how we can do it. We've exhausted a huge amount of our weaponry
863.28s: we're more concerned about China really than Russia and I think Trump is
868.16s: provably more concerned about China than Russia. So I just don't see it and by the way if you're going
873.84s: to lose and once everybody sort of understands that you're going to lose these things and collapse
877.44s: pretty quickly. Yeah no I think you have an interesting perspective I think the the only
884.64s: follow-up I would have there then is why is the war still going? If Russia is this
890.96s: behind superpower it's super close to the line of conflict it has this industrial complex
897.44s: it can steam really Ukraine and yet the war is going on. So two reasons from the Russian side Putin
903.92s: is genuinely interested in minimizing Russian casualties so slow steady don't leave troops
910.16s: outrun your your drone coverage you know and by the way he has he has stated his military objectives
917.76s: which is the four regions which they're he now considers Russia and then on the Ukrainian
923.44s: side Solansky has no room to maneuver right I mean you have this far right bender right portion
929.52s: of Ukraine which has zero desire for compromise and would rather sort of die trying to push the
936.88s: Russians out and the moment Solansky takes a step towards compromise I think his personal position
942.00s: would be very precarious losing wars is hard like if you just look through history
953.52s: admitting that you have been defeated early enough to salvage something reasonable from the
958.56s: situation is almost impossible and putting leaders in such positions is a no-win situation for them.
967.04s: And so a slow grind that ultimately inevitably ends in total defeat is sort of a boiled frog
975.76s: you know situation for those on the losing side of war. Again picking wars we should have a very
981.84s: very high barrier to like getting involved in wars because you could lose them and it as
987.76s: Columpal says if you don't have a plan upfront for overwhelming victory what are you doing?
991.76s: We had no such plan from the beginning there was no scenario where we were going to impose a
995.68s: kinetic defeat on Russia from afar maybe we were not even enough to think that from the beginning
1003.28s: but after the first few months it should have been clear that that was unlikely to happen certainly
1008.08s: after the large counteroffensive from Ukraine was defeated by Russia at that point like you know
1014.56s: the war is over and again if you just go back through history Eric like Napoleon you know
1020.48s: pick your favorite like people roll into Russia and then what happens they get
1025.44s: ground down to a pulp the Russia is not afraid to fight a war of attrition and to win them.
1031.36s: So that's where we are I think that's by the way not a controversial opinion anymore we may have
1036.64s: been early to that opinion but I think that's broadly if you just read the economist in the
1041.60s: financial times and the British papers are starting to come around to the fact that
1046.32s: maybe this war is not winable and we should begin to sort of salvage what's left but it's very
1050.16s: difficult to lose the war losing a war you know way that minimizes the totality of negativity on
1058.16s: your country takes a level of statesmanship that is very very rare and by the way its statesmanship
1066.72s: involves convincing the people you need to go along with it and sometimes it's just impossible so
1073.28s: you know it again it's a terrible situation the biggest losers in all of this by far like
1078.00s: scandalously so are the people of Ukraine you know the US can wash his hands if it Trump could
1083.60s: wash his hands if it and there might be some mile political price to pay in the US but compared to
1089.60s: what has happened to the people of Ukraine this has been a calamity true calamity one for which people
1096.16s: should be held to account. In one last question on this one while we're on it I I'm trying to
1104.32s: understand your perspective on Trump's reference to potentially let this one go with it being
1112.96s: such a massive global focus in such a massive part of his campaign I would see it hard to look at it
1121.20s: any other way than a colossal failure on Trump's on Trump's scorecard. Yeah yeah go ahead. No
1130.40s: that's I think you got it. Yeah so first of all it's early for him right and if he puts
1135.76s: some of W's on the board maybe he can wash away an L or two but I actually think more likely is
1142.00s: for all the talk of a Trump Putin meeting I think there's going to be a Trump Putin G summit
1148.72s: where big broad spheres of influence are delineated and Trump gets concessions in other areas
1155.84s: and seeds Ukraine and again anybody from Ukraine listening to this will be quite angered by me
1161.84s: characterizing it in this way and I fully understand that I'm just trying to get into Trump's head I'm
1165.60s: not telling you what I would do now I think there's going to be some grand bargain look what is Trump
1169.76s: focused on since since he became president Ukraine Panama Canada Colombia Mexico Venezuela
1177.28s: Western hemisphere spheres of influence Monroe doctrine Ukraine's not on the board
1182.80s: um it's it's a true tragedy I'm not trying to to downplay it it is a catastrophe but in a world
1189.92s: where Trump and G and Putin get together and decide the world for the next four years
1195.44s: it's not like we're going to be able to convince Putin to to to to turn around and just hand
1201.12s: back Ukraine to to Europe it's just I just don't think it's going to happen and I think as traders
1205.52s: as investors as analysts you have to see the pieces on the board as they as they are and play them
1209.20s: accordingly or yeah one last question on this one and then um I actually want to pivot to talk to you
1215.68s: a little bit about the whole tariff game that's happening but on the on the war as it sits what are your
1221.44s: thoughts specifically on the way new technology is essentially reshaping the ability for smaller forces
1229.84s: to be able to compete because obviously as you're doing your research on the battle lines I'm sure
1234.32s: you're coming across no shortage of actual live videos or recorded videos of the conflict as it
1241.04s: sits and you see two thousand dollars of drones knocking out fifteen million dollars of equipment
1247.36s: so then it starts to call into question the industrial capacity and the ability to produce you know
1252.48s: large weapons able of reaching far a lot of these missile systems and stuff like that the drones
1259.04s: have changed all of that so how does that how does that yeah how does that fit into your analysis
1265.84s: yeah so I would say look I mean full credit to Ukraine I mean they are the second strongest
1271.60s: military in Europe today by a wide margin through the cold room of having to fight right um
1279.12s: the technological development and the necessity of doing so in order to sort of stay one step
1284.80s: ahead of your competitor has made both Russia and Ukraine far stronger um technologically than
1292.24s: almost any other military in the world and it's only because Russia is so much bigger and has such a
1298.56s: stronger military industrial complex to rely upon and frankly more people to uh in ties to join
1304.88s: its army um in ties being sort of a a say purposely broad term um like Russia is a far stronger
1314.24s: military force today out of necessity than it was when what Putin would call the special military
1321.12s: operation commenced in 2022 far stronger than America um today and I think China has been studying
1328.00s: this situation very carefully like Russia has a million plus strong army or you know military not
1333.84s: just army um and they have been sort of you know trial by fire in the most like brutal
1342.40s: disgusting horrifying way possible which is like a war in which a bunch of people die every day I
1350.32s: think like both sides are suffering hundreds of casualties a day we see the latest um evolution of
1356.56s: fiber optic controlled drones out of Russia have you seen these where these super thin wires like
1361.60s: basically a giant fishing line that spans kilometers and these drones basically can't be interfered with
1368.56s: using you know electronic um weapons and so they just are flying now with full autonomy all over
1377.20s: the battlefield and I think this has been the most recent of the sort of technological developments
1382.96s: that is changing the pace of change on on the front line because if you can't really use you know
1387.52s: electronic interference weapons to distort the path and in aiming capabilities of these drones and
1394.80s: now you literally have a hard wire drone flying through the air with a super thin fiber optic
1399.92s: cable controlling it um that's just the latest innovation that would never have happened if the
1405.36s: won't if this war hadn't been you know fought for the past that three years it's amazing by the way
1411.04s: that we're coming up on three years um it's really sad actually it's a real indictment of
1417.28s: of the current slate of western leaders that we've allowed this thing to go on that for as long
1421.76s: as we have but yeah huge amount of technological development old weapons that cost millions of
1427.12s: dollars a pop totally obsolete right um and then you know beyond that sort of missile development the
1434.00s: a rejnic missile which doesn't get much press in the west but I think really shocked and open the
1439.44s: eyes of of NATO yeah I mean it necessities the mother of invention and there's nothing more
1444.80s: necessary than trying to win a war and we're seeing an amazing adaptation of AI and and drone
1452.32s: technology and and all the things that should scare people you know autonomous robot technology
1458.32s: I've seen some films of by the way I should say you don't want to watch too many of these films
1463.92s: because there's a lot of like actual real people dying in horrific ways in the footage that you can
1468.96s: see online and every person that you see dying as somebody's kid somebody sibling somebody's cousin
1475.60s: somebody's friend and it's a really human tragedy and and it can yeah one thing you don't want to
1481.28s: do is ever get sort of normalized to watching such things because it's it's quite sad
1488.00s: can be yeah definitely can be really interesting I enjoy here in your perspective there's a lot of
1493.20s: nuance to it there's a lot of things um yeah that I think are just a very interesting lens
1498.72s: to apply but I'd love to pivot now and pick your brain a little bit on the the game of tariffs
1507.52s: that's a foot is that how did you think that that was going to play out and how is it trended so far
1513.60s: not sure if you saw but we just wrote about it um yes you're okay um and so it was top of mind for
1518.72s: us um we have a lot of friends and connections to Canada and and we actually take Trump on on this
1524.48s: issue we take Trump at face value um the fentanyl crisis is a real issue we're losing 100,000
1531.20s: people a year to overdoses in the country which is almost certainly a significant underestimation um 80
1538.16s: percent of those overdoses are from fentanyl a lot of those fentanyl overdoses are from people using
1543.20s: other drugs not knowing that fentanyl has been cut in and so they overdosed by accident and they
1548.40s: die this is a chemical war declared upon the US by China that largely targets military aged
1555.36s: adults in the country and it's long past time that we get serious about trying to stop it
1561.76s: most of the fentanyl that finds this way into the US comes in via Mexico or Canada and
1568.08s: Canadians were shocked and angered and bewildered at being lumped in with Mexico as co-equal
1574.88s: participants in this sort of fentanyl trade but as we rode in our piece undeclared there's strong
1582.32s: circumstantial evidence to support Trump's claims and the main counter sort of arguments that
1588.96s: the Canadian media and the Canadian government have been putting forward don't really pass
1593.36s: mustard and don't stand up to to close scrutiny and you'll notice um you know the sort of this theory
1601.68s: that Trump is just a economic arsonist or a madman and orange man bad and all this stuff um when
1608.72s: he campaigned he said over and over and over and over again i will make fentanyl a top priority and
1614.56s: how we use tariffs to convince mexico china and canada to do something about it that's what he does
1621.36s: if you actually read the executive order that um lazy groundwork for these tariffs it begins with
1626.88s: fentanyl within 24 hours after he announced the tariffs um both mexico and canada pledge to do
1635.52s: substantially more on the fentanyl issue and Trump says okay let's delay the tariffs until we can
1640.24s: negotiate a permanent settlement like it's very clear he he called a shot he explained why he was
1646.48s: doing it he did it the moment he got movement on the main issue that was a driving force for the
1651.76s: tariffs he relented like fentanyl is a real issue we we're losing more people of fentanyl than we lost
1658.48s: in the battlefield of world war two like that was shock people to look at that statistic we lost
1663.60s: 400,000 soldiers dead in world war two for the entirety of the war and we've lost that many people
1670.24s: of fentanyl last four years five years like it's a big deal um it's destroying families and communities
1678.32s: across the country look there's a demand side argument to be made uh and i get that um but there's
1685.12s: more that canada and mexico and the us could do um and trump is is well within his his rights and
1694.56s: frankly we applaud to him for finally making this uh an issue uh of the highest priority for the
1701.04s: US federal government like it if not this than what you know like we're we're losing a hundred
1706.64s: thousand people young people um it's a big deal and um there's far more fentanyl being
1714.16s: producing canada than the canadiens would like to admit and beyond that the chinese gangs in canada
1721.20s: excel um at you know uh money laundering and they've they've embarked upon a synergistic
1728.16s: collaboration with the mexican cartels to help them turn their drug profits into money good
1733.92s: and and and this is real and trump is uh should be applauded for for recognize now look the
1740.48s: bluntness of tariffs and trump's sort of style and statements leave a bad taste in some people's mouth
1746.64s: but on this particular issue um we find ourselves wholeheartedly supporting the president
1753.12s: yeah i just like the way you framed the the modality because i agree it definitely can rub people
1761.28s: all different kinds of ways one of the one of the things that i have to agree with you on broadly though
1766.80s: is that in order to move things quickly you kind of have to do things that are a little
1773.36s: i don't know brash is the right term but definitely a little heavier handed than the standard
1779.68s: bureaucratic process of call a summit have leaders come talk about it and so on and so forth because
1785.84s: to your broader point think of how fast there are now you know mexico setting what is it 10,000
1791.44s: troops you know to the mexicoside of the border just is a loose example safe with gandhi yeah yeah
1797.60s: and that and that happened over the course of you know 48 hours so you don't really get speed
1802.96s: like that unless you do something a little more drastic now i find an interesting exercises to think
1809.92s: about what the next month might look like though and specifically the element that i think your
1816.96s: expertise will probably lend in in understanding a lot better is let's say 30 days go by and they're
1822.96s: unable to arrive at a conclusion or a deal i mean my expectation honestly is that they would because
1828.56s: i think it's an everybody's benefit but just you know playing the scenario that maybe maybe they don't
1834.24s: what do you think about the implementation of tariffs then the retaliatory tariffs from
1841.12s: canada and how that might shape the broader economic picture at least in the near term three six
1847.28s: months ish here's why deal has to happen exports from canada to the us account for 22% of
1856.40s: canadian gdb and exports of the us to canada account for 1.5% the us should be there's just no
1865.12s: leverage on the canadian side like trump will dictate the terms and canada will follow them that is
1871.60s: the outcome that is in everybody's economic interest and if they don't the tariffs will come on
1877.92s: he'll probably put them up to 50% there will be a revolution of some kind in canada and there'll
1885.20s: be a new partner for trump to negotiate with on this one i again i have many many close friends and
1891.60s: other associates in canada and our piece provoked all manner of responses on this one canada would
1900.00s: be wise to be seen as doing as much as possible and by the way it's an easy off-rand like who could
1906.00s: be opposed to rolling up fentanyl labs in rural version Columbia who could be opposed to tightening
1913.36s: the border crossings across the rural western part of the country you're going to pay all those
1918.64s: soldiers who have monitored the border anyway and and who could be opposed to cracking down on
1925.60s: td bank and the money laundering that they've been accused of doing to enable a fentanyl trade like
1931.52s: fentanyl is a dastardly drug that all law-abiding citizens should be fully supportive of
1937.92s: of of eradicating from our our collective societies canada to by the way they canada you know loses
1944.16s: three to four thousand citizens a year to fentanyl overdose it's not quite at the same pace even
1949.60s: correcting for relative population than we see in the u.s but it's still material every one of
1953.84s: those is a tragedy every one of those deaths is somebody's kid and and it should be eradicated and
1960.48s: and the mexican cartels and the chinese cartels are deeply evil people like and we should be fighting
1967.68s: them um mexico for example has just huge potential runway which is a piece we're pondering writing
1976.16s: for a variety of reasons if they could just get their cartels situation on a control and i know
1980.00s: it's been that way for decades and it's a hard problem but like the same thing in canada like look we
1985.92s: have very strong evidence that there are dangerous chinese organized criminal elements
1997.52s: satirating british clombian and the city of toronto mostly interfering with canada elections
2004.40s: causing all manner of crime um blowing the property bubble in van koover in toronto like
2010.08s: used to be that you can say such things without being accused of you know xenophobia but it's true
2015.44s: it's real everybody knows it's real let's get a handle on it like again one of the things about trump
2020.00s: is he just sort of has a knack for saying sort of loudly and sometimes and appropriately all the things
2026.40s: that everybody's thinking quietly let's just go ahead and put it on the table and get it fixed
2033.44s: so then to summarize that it sounds like your overarching expectation is arrive at a deal
2040.56s: it's impossible impossible they wouldn't Eric i mean come on i mean 22% of your gdp
2047.52s: i mean i mean we say that in it to be clear i actually agree with you but i mean what's the point of
2053.44s: even starting then with retaliatory retaliatory tariffs uh you know trutos lame duck
2059.68s: wants to be seen as strong this is an injection of uncertainty into an election campaign that was
2065.92s: imminent and looked likely to be a deep defeat for the liberals if trump if trutos could be seen as
2073.12s: standing up to the bully and fighting for canada then maybe whoever replaces him on the ticket
2077.12s: stands a better chance of of minimizing the defeat that they look set to suffer to the conservatives
2083.28s: i mean there's you know people optimize for all kinds of outcomes in situations like this
2091.60s: and look it gave trutos a chance to be relevant again for one thing and to his credit i think he
2098.40s: did actually a pretty good job of handling the situation certainly being portrayed as such in the
2103.76s: Canadian media which i follow closely and you know that the as we articulated in the piece which
2109.52s: we thought was pretty balanced this this move by trump sparked a rare moment of national political
2117.44s: unity across canada which is not to be ignored and and isn't in consequential and so it changed
2124.40s: the game like that the least happy person is pure polar bear you know like waiting to ascend to the
2129.92s: throne of prime minister of canada then some of the entire rules of the game change that's not good
2134.80s: when you have a winning hand you want stability and this is a deeply destabilizing event when
2139.68s: you have a losing hand uh instability is a potential opportunity and so and look trutos handle it
2147.20s: well he relied on you know there's these sort of council of us relations within canada and and
2152.88s: lord knows within canada the stance and negotiation towards the united states is probably the most
2157.52s: important political issue on the board and and trutos again to his credit handled this situation
2165.04s: quite well and look i'm no fan of trutos like we've written very critically about trutos over the
2170.16s: years especially his sort of uh totalitarian instincts around the freedom convoy and all that stuff
2177.04s: but in this particular case isolated to the event at issue um trutos comes out looking pretty good
2182.88s: in my view one of the things i noticed when the the tariffs are coming out i have a bunch of people
2190.16s: in my audience that are canadian and you could definitely tell that there's a lot of people that
2193.84s: were just kind of like pissed off about it right yeah yeah it felt like our neighbor is being lame
2200.56s: and why is it like this and one of the arguments i saw opposed that was pretty interesting um was
2207.52s: the fact that canada represents a really significant portion of this is right up your alley
2212.64s: of us heavy oil imports so not crude but sand oil and the us doesn't really have deep
2222.40s: production of that in place just yet i think that there are different ways that the us would manage
2227.76s: through it but just to play out the scenario because it's an interesting thought exercise
2232.16s: is tariffs let's say 30 days for whatever reason the impossibility does occur and they don't arrive at
2239.28s: a in agreement maybe it's political maybe it's part of the to your to your broader point part of
2245.36s: this broader election whatever the scenario is and let's just say that the scenario escalated
2251.60s: somehow to where canada says we are going to cut sending you heavy oils now i i think that that's
2259.68s: kind of suicide for canada but just for the lens of us how does something like that
2267.36s: impact the us and how do you think the us would navigate through that kind of decision i'm
2273.92s: going to give you an answer that'll surprise you um Canadians are vastly vastly overestimating
2280.64s: the leverage that we sell the us heavy oil brings to them um refiners who are optimized to refine
2288.72s: heavy crude prefer to refine heavy crude because they have made the investments necessary to take
2295.76s: sulfur out of heavy crude and heavy crude tends to be cheaper that doesn't mean that they can't
2302.16s: refine other crude and so there's this thought that if canada shuts off the spigots that somehow the
2310.00s: us will find itself in a refined products crisis and that's just not true um we export we the
2318.08s: us i live in us um the us exports light crude and imports heavy crude because the newest refineries
2325.92s: out there prefer to refine light crude and the old refineries here prefer to refine heavy crude
2335.04s: it doesn't mean they couldn't make do with the light crude that we have it be suboptimal um you know
2341.12s: they might not run at full capacity and some of their operational units might be idle
2346.88s: but in the long run the us which has by the way massive stores of these refined products and who go
2353.76s: many many weeks um with you know while the refiner is retooled and and work through the inventory
2360.24s: they have online like this is um compared to the 22% of your GDP being reliant on us exports this
2366.96s: is no leverage at all and these are the happy stories you tell yourself when you have an leverage
2372.64s: again i'm sort of reminded of Ukraine um the us would be in a far better place to handle
2380.40s: a a slowdown in the imports or even a complete cessation of the imports of heavy crude from canada
2388.72s: it would be suboptimal people wouldn't make as much money but the us gas pumps would not run dry
2394.08s: uh you know um and by the way um it would accelerate the necessary investments needed to optimize
2402.32s: the us refinery fleet for light grades which would then permanently reduce any leverage
2407.28s: leading as it might be that canada might have and so when i see such
2412.08s: commentary in the media cringe because it tells me that the people actually don't know what they're
2416.00s: talking about and that it might uh inform political leaders to make decisions based on leverage
2421.28s: they think they have that doesn't actually exist um you know the us petroleum industry is exceptionally
2428.16s: sophisticated and they aren't trapped in some like oh my god we need canadian heavy crude
2434.08s: we'd like to buy canadian heavy crude at a discount wcs as a discount and why should i pay up
2440.80s: to buy this light crude um that others in foreign lands are willing to pay up for when i could buy
2445.84s: my um cheap crude here and capture a bigger spread when i sell my gasoline and my jet fuel and my
2450.64s: diesel that there's a vast difference between economic optimization and economic necessity
2456.80s: and this is a card that i think is is wildly over exaggerated uh in the canadian media today
2462.80s: to the canadian instrument yeah yep i fully agree with that one and the the other part that i
2468.88s: was doing a little bit of research on is just even if we needed if the us needed to find some sort
2475.12s: of short term replacement there are other places that produce heavy crude as well it's not
2481.92s: globally traded yeah right it's globally we would just turn the spikets on in Venezuela i mean
2486.96s: you know mexico but like it's produced all over the world it's it's it's floating around in
2492.00s: cargo ships if we truly needed it we could just pay up and buy it um the us is not going to run out
2497.44s: of gasoline diesel or jet fuel because canada turns off the taps just isn't yeah the us is a global
2503.36s: energy superpower and the reorientation of the system given the price disparities that would
2509.52s: temporarily materialize would only further your road canada's leverage over time right now
2516.16s: speaking of energy and just what that might look like for the year we obviously talked last time
2521.84s: about some of trump's policies about you know drill baby drill and the the different things that we
2527.44s: might expect to see from an energy evolution standpoint but i'd love to get an update on any key
2536.48s: energy themes that you guys are seeing and expect to play out this year yeah i mean you know
2543.76s: Chris righteous you know elevated to the secretary of energy which was a big vote that we were
2549.60s: watching very carefully earlier this week he's taking aggressive action to implement trump's agenda
2556.56s: i'm looking at the board right now and i see wti at seventy dollars and fifty cents you know
2562.56s: basically at the low end of opax desired managed range um sari rabia needs 95 to 105 to balance its
2572.08s: budget that's for the the financial break even price of sari rabia opay is on its back foot
2576.88s: um i note with great interest that the envoy that trump sent to venezuela seemed to have pretty
2582.72s: good success in freeing some us hostages in air quotes i don't know what they were up to in venezuela
2588.32s: but they have since been released um and other concessions being made by venezuela i'd keep a close
2595.44s: eye on chevron's desire to get a license renewed to continue to operate in venezuela trump seems
2602.24s: to be playing the mineral doctrine um this whole concept that we need to increase production in the
2607.36s: us for trump to achieve his objectives which is forty dollar oil to sort of put pressure on food and
2613.52s: maybe get a better deal in the ukraine um misses the fact that there are other ways for trump to
2618.88s: increase global oil production right here in the western hemisphere giana venezuela um argentina
2624.32s: i'd keep a close eye on columbia which seems to be taking a pretty uh combative stance towards trump
2630.08s: and i wouldn't be surprised if we see regime change there um sometime this year that very interesting
2634.64s: situation to follow um so there's plenty to do at home and trump has signaled that he's interested
2641.20s: in doing those things at home um and it's not just the us i mean if exon mobile radically increases
2648.08s: drilling and production in giana how is that different than the permeant basin increasing
2653.84s: production right i mean it's an american company you know um leading uh a joint venture which
2659.28s: actually by the way includes a chinese company um increasing global supply of oil the chinese are
2664.56s: interested in lower oil prices too um and so you know i i just think looking at the board right now
2671.52s: oil hugging the bottom end of the preferred managed range of opak hard to see what the catalyst
2677.12s: are for significant upside from here interesting and i know they get a run in a couple minutes one two
2684.56s: more questions the first one is looking at the global stage right now obviously there's so much talk
2692.80s: about you know canada mexico russia ukrain and you mentioned earlier an important player that just
2701.52s: has seemed to have kind of been a little more quiet until the tariff conversation earlier this
2706.40s: week and that's china so where does china fit into the broader mix the broader global and geopolitical
2714.24s: scale as you can see um just from like a current thematic perspective i think china is playing
2720.48s: its cards exceptionally well as it always does i think it's a serious error to underestimate your
2727.68s: geopolitical opponents i think if marco rubio is indeed out there talking about spheres of
2734.08s: influence and multi polarity um this is music to chinese ears um they have been the arsenal
2741.60s: in support of russia's imminent victory in ukrain and between those two countries and
2747.44s: the great catastrophic geopolitical disaster of driving them together that happened in the last
2753.76s: four years which is something the us has tried to avoid for decades by the way this strong cohesion
2760.08s: between russia and china is going to be a formidable competitor to the us in a new multi polar world
2764.80s: and i think china is emboldened to gradually take back tiawan and the way that it wants to which is
2770.64s: without armed conflict um and i don't know what trump can do um in a world where where that
2778.48s: begins to happen because it's not like we can project uh enough power from here to there
2784.00s: especially when china controls so much of our military industrial supply chains and especially
2787.84s: as we've learned in russia that proximity to the battlefield is is really determinative and there's
2793.76s: nobody closer to tiawan than china i mean by definition it's right there um so um g is sitting
2800.56s: back um the nice thing from china's perspective not necessarily for my hours but if you're china um
2808.72s: you you don't have an urgency you know you don't have that for your electoral cycle you don't have the
2813.12s: need to be seen as doing something consequential in your first hundred days china thinks in decades
2819.28s: it has all the cards by doing nothing it continues to win i expect that to keep doing nothing like
2826.08s: why would it provoke a war over tiawan now when it could just continuously and gradually
2833.36s: and incrementally achieve with objectives in a way that doesn't disrupt its economy and doesn't
2838.48s: force it to fight and next thing you know wake up one day in a checkmate um and i think that's what
2843.36s: they're going to do um i think g would certainly attend a summit between putin and trump uh if
2851.52s: for no other reason that they would know that it's two on one and i think china and russia have a
2857.04s: pretty good read on trump by the way his ego and uh what drives him and and what his needs are and how
2864.40s: they could jujitsu those needs for their own objectives i mean i you know if you're just being
2869.44s: objective and you take a step back like trump is not really a complicated guy um and so
2875.92s: it's going to be fascinating to see we are of course are nothing more than interested observers
2881.36s: but i think china um has its own challenges internally and people point to them all the time
2887.36s: although the same people point to various challenges in russia and never seem to materialize in
2890.96s: anything meaningful um demographics and the property boss and all that other stuff uh i don't know
2897.44s: it kind of reminds me of the peachy bow guys um you know anxiously looking for
2901.52s: well-depletion rates in the premium for proof that we're about to fall off the cliff in global oil
2906.00s: production um but nonetheless i i would say that um my own personal history in dealing with and
2913.20s: being in and around china uh in my industrial career um they're not to be taken lightly um they
2921.44s: play the game on a horizon that is longer than ours they're infinitely patient um they're more
2928.32s: than happy to take the free weeks you know the free the freebies um as we as we toss them up
2933.76s: and then wait for the next one and uh and and we shall see but i i think um the odds of a sort of
2939.68s: kinetic conflict over ty one i think are growing down with each passing day as it becomes apparent that
2944.40s: that would just be sort of a losing battle so um and i think that's their objective you know like uh
2949.36s: nobody should want war um the chinese haven't really started a war that i can remember in modern
2955.28s: history and so why would they want to sort of provoke one now uh over the ty one issue
2959.84s: definitely and i think well i agree with the element of like supply change and stuff like that
2966.00s: that that actually is one of the the hallmarks of us military is our ability to project power and
2971.92s: we we've spent a lot of a lot of resources developing carrier strike groups and things like that
2977.92s: and that's not to weigh in whether or not that's the deciding factor between winning a conflict
2982.24s: wrapped around ty one or not but to your broader point that's just the path of more resistance for
2986.80s: everybody and it looks like in the us we're starting to try to incentivize more domestic chip
2992.00s: production and if that happens then the stake in ty one from the us perspective starts to wane and
2996.48s: you know it's on and so forth so let me ask you questions you think a us carrier strike group could
3001.28s: resist an orasnic missile attack today and you think that right you you actually think that i
3006.16s: could be interested to see i i don't um we could agree to disagree um but if if if they can't that's
3013.84s: a game changer you would agree right like um if certainly yeah if hyper sonic missiles can
3021.12s: penetrate the anti missile shields of us carrier groups then us carrier groups
3026.96s: become a lot less relevant so i mean you would certainly have more experience in this space than i do
3031.92s: but i i would be let's put this way if russian china believe that they can't i think that we're
3037.84s: heading for a conflict right yeah yeah well it's like it's like the same thing when china was
3043.52s: touting their six gen fighter which is a glorified fifth gen fighter so the and complete with stolen
3050.16s: technology right i mean yeah yeah but all right you got to run you got some stuff to do absolutely
3056.88s: awesome connecting it's always just fascinating you know having a chance to pick your brain a little
3061.12s: bit learn about the world around us obviously people can find you at your website um anywhere else
3066.40s: that you would like to send people to check out your stuff just doonberg.com d-o-o-m-b-e-r-g um everything we do
3073.28s: is there we are one-stop shop Eric always a pleasure one thing that we uh we never fail to do is to
3078.88s: speculate and and to uh and to have a lot of fun brainstorming so i always appreciate coming on
3084.16s: because you ask great questions and we always have a great discussion awesome thanks for coming to
3088.24s: hang out there ready
