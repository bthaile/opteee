 What's up, outliers? Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I'm a friend, Duneberg, and the timing for this is beautiful because as per usual, there's no shortage of crazy things going on. I always find my inability to fill out the stock market and economic bingo cards to be pretty hilarious. I never really get that far. How's the year starting off for you? Well, it must be said that Donald Trump is nothing if not fantastic for the newsletter business. I was joking with my wife about that because it's like to your exact point, if nothing else, you have no shortage of constant streams of clips of things to talk about because I was watching him signing like a bunch of different executive orders and he's given like a press conference while he's signing these things. You know, we have a good friend, Sir JJ over at Market Fives, a new sub stack. I like a lot. He's an old school trader 50 years in the pit. And a recent piece that he published under his master's head. He had an interesting comparison, which is FDR's fireside chats, you know, in a way. Trump is playing the media in the same way that FDR did, totally accessible to all of his faults and believe me, he has many. The man has stamina and endurance and is never afraid of the microphone and the contrast between four years of a staff trying to hide Joe Biden from the public and Donald Trump on a bashfully afraid to talk to a bunch of microphones that, two in the morning on a return flight from California, is really quite something. It's a stark contrast. So talk to me a little bit about from an overall lens, how the year is starting off were things so far in line with expectations where there are new injects to the mental models in terms of just how you expected things to go. And I'm not really isolating to one level of analysis, economic markets, political, really just anything in general. The main reason I'm asking it this way is that I want to get a sense from your paradigm. What's sticking out to you so far this year? Yeah, the only thing that matters is the speed and efficiency with which Trump is hitting the ground and smashing the opposition. Whatever your views are, whether you are a, you know, right leaning, left leaning, Donald Trump had four years to ponder what went wrong, how he quote unquote lost 2020, how his first administration was sidelined by distraction after distraction and perhaps sabotage from within. And he had four years to plot his revenge. And he ascended to the presidency on January 20th. And it is just simply undeniable that he is flooding the field with all manner of good policy, crazy policy, insane statements. The new cycle can't keep up with whatever it is he's rolling out. And you know, he's deputized Elon Musk to do a variety of things and he's getting his nominees through the Senate, making crazy statements with Netanyahu at this press conference like it. He's just a whirlwind. And again, whatever your views on the man or his politics or his morals, he is a tornado. That is, that is impacting everything. He's impacting stocks. He's impacting geopolitics. He's impacting war. He's impacting peace. He's impacting the tax code. He's impacting the federal government budget. He is just a steamroller, the likes of which the US frankly, I don't think has ever seen. And history will record Trump regardless of how his term ends as a tour de force. Whether it ends up being net positive or negative, of course, depends on future events and depends on your perspective coming into these events. But the man is undeniably just an energizer bunny of just unlike we've never seen it. Maybe it's just the contrast between what Trump would characterize as the sleepy Joe administration. But he just really is something to be hold in. Frankly, we are having trouble keeping up with it all, trying to chronicle it and trying to bring some sense to it. But it's nothing if not interesting to be sure. Yeah. So so far, you bring up a really interesting point about just how much is going on of the just litany of policies, executive orders, statements that are being made. Are there any specific items that he's been talking about that really stick out to you and if so why? So there's the assault on USAID, depending on your perspective. And that is really just going right at the juggler of the power structure of the Democratic National Committee. And somebody gave Trump really good advice before he came into the presidency a second time around. So there's the proactive things he's actually doing. And look, that's a scandal. Like I mean, I think that is is really going to be a major story for months to come. As we see all of these foreign quote unquote newspapers and media outlets, something going on a business because they were actually just paid fronts of the Democratic Party of the United States. Opposition, media and Hungary, for example, is just one example where Victor Orbán was tweeting about recently. So there's the things he's doing, but then there's the things he's not doing, which I think are just as important and just as profound, which is what we're trying to get our hands around to write a few pieces on, which is he really doesn't want anything to do with Ukraine. I mean, I think this is Biden's war. Don't forget Trump was impeached over Ukraine in 2019. It's not like he's unaware of what's really going on over there and how this all came about. And he would like to just wash his hands of it, turn the keys over to Europe, which of course is akin to losing the war because there is no way in which Ukraine could sustain itself in the absence of continued US support. And he just doesn't actually want to talk about it. The stuff he does say when asked is mostly wrong, sort of indicates to us that he's not really studying the issue all that closely. It's kind of like that that issue in the back of your mind that you know is there that you wish would just go away as you don't spend much time thinking about it, which is sort of consistent with Trump's personality, because he gravitates towards winning and strength and all of those things like we're losing that war, NATO will lose that war, Russia will win that war. And he's kind of just trying to drop the bags on Europe. And one of the pieces we're working on right now is how you know this amazing interview that Marco Rubio gave with Megan Kelly where he all but says that the US will retreat to a sphere of influence slash you know multiple of world. There's no scenario in which the European Union survives an American retreat in that regard. And that's what's coming. Rubio Albutzigolet trumps absence of forceful you know for all the talk of I'm going to solve the war today and I'm going to call Putin and we're going to deal. He's done none of those things. And I don't I can understand why he was dealt with losing hand. We've said many times in our articles and on podcast appearances that one of the reasons why you avoid picking fights is you might lose them. And this is especially true when the when the cost of defeat is larger than the prize on offer. You know and so he just wants to ignore Ukraine. And every day that he ignores Ukraine you know the Russian army continues to sort of roll up the parts of Ukraine that it and now considers Russia. And so once he gets more and more desperate it's a real fiasco one for which the blame lies at the feet of the Biden administration to be clear. I think with a high degree of certainty that Trump statements that the war would not have happened if he had won in 2020 or absolutely true. We would not be involved in this war. And so it's not just what he's doing but what he's not doing. And he is really taking an assault a frontal assault on the vast waste and fraud and mismanagement of public money that has occurred in Washington under the auspices of both democratic and Republican regimes. In our view there's team DC and team Trump and DC is about to get rinsed. A couple of things here. The first one going back to the Ukraine war two questions. The first one is your hypothesizing that Russia is likely to win when you say when what does that mean? Like how would you define Russia winning this conflict? Russia will impose its objectives by military force and there is nothing that Europe or the US can do about it. That is my definition of winning. It will secure the quote for regions. It will degrade Ukraine's military capabilities. It might not be able to enforce upon Ukraine that the Russians that live within what's left of Ukraine get you know the rights to speak their language and go to church and all of those things but the broad important military objectives will be achieved by force which is sort of the ultimate definition of winning in a military conflict. As I'm sure you more than anybody would be aware. And the following one is why do you think Trump is taking such a passive position on it? Obviously understanding the context of being dealt kind of a difficult hand to work with but that also seems like a really great potential win for him and his platform. He doesn't have the leverage to win and Trump hates to be seen as losing. I mean I don't want to be like armchair psychologist but he is a relatively straightforward person to understand. He is I think a very empathetic person, a very patriotic person, a very bombastic person, he enjoys a good negotiation, the art of the deal, wrote a book on it and I think has very good intuition for when he is walking into a situation where he doesn't have the leverage and since he didn't create this situation but he only inherited it. I think the motivation, like in his first 100 days he wants to be seen as winning as much as possible and this is just a losing hand. And so I just think passive aggressively he wants to ignore it. What makes you think so much that it's a losing hand? I know I've been studying the day-to-day line of combat moves and what both sides are telling themselves internally for propaganda and body counts and all the things that you would want to study to get your own independent analysis of what's going on in the ground and this is very hard. We wrote a piece a year ago called Mapping the War and we opened that piece with the difficulty involved in cutting through propaganda and one of the things we have learned to do which I think serves us very well is we read the propaganda of all the sides because even just learning what they're telling each other is a very valuable input into what's possible and what's likely happening. And we're seeing, look it's just the mathematics of it are very clear. You have a giant country next to a relatively small country. You have a vast industrial machine that the West radically underestimate and I don't know why for centuries invading armies always underestimate the industrial capacity of Russia. Their supply chain is far closer to the line of combat than ours. It is viewed internally within Russia and is spun as much within their propaganda as an existential threat to the country. It's a nice to have war for us. You go to the Midwest and you go to the mall and you ask a hundred people do you care about your crane. I bet you wouldn't find a single yes. If you go to the same mall in Moscow it's an existential threat. So you have one side fighting it extensively, the Russians for whom their entire industrial base is right there and then the US through its sort of proxies in the EU with very long extended supply chains much of which has been outsourced to China by the way who is allied with our opponent in this war. If this is highlighting huge weaknesses in the US military industrial complex which I think Trump is is motivated to fix and in many ways this has opened the eyes of I think the Department of Defense which is we would sort of view Washington as the DOD largely pro Trump and CIA Wall Street largely not pro Biden. The DOD recognizes the holes in the supply chain doesn't really want to escalate the war in Ukraine and sees that it's just a fight that we can't win. We've spent how many tens of billions of dollars on this war and if you just go to the deep state mapping project and play the video of the movement of the line of combat over the last year it's very clear that it's in one way traffic. And so Russia's armies never been bigger it's never been better equipped. The head of NATO just admitted that Russia is producing three times as many weapons as the entirety of the NATO countries integrated by factor three. We're not going to win this war. We're not going to go to we're not going to resort to nuclear war. You know weapons that's pretty clear and so if one of the reasons why you don't pick a kinetic conflict with nuclear superpowers unless you're willing to use your nuclear weapons or not much use to you. So I just think writings on the wall and especially if Trump pulls away you know we've cut off funding and a few other things like it won't be long and and so I just think sometimes you just got to take the take the L and Trump is probably willing to take that L because by the way it's very hard like how would you win this war from here if you were in charge Eric I'd be curious like I don't see how we can do it. We've exhausted a huge amount of our weaponry we're more concerned about China really than Russia and I think Trump is provably more concerned about China than Russia. So I just don't see it and by the way if you're going to lose and once everybody sort of understands that you're going to lose these things and collapse pretty quickly. Yeah no I think you have an interesting perspective I think the the only follow-up I would have there then is why is the war still going? If Russia is this behind superpower it's super close to the line of conflict it has this industrial complex it can steam really Ukraine and yet the war is going on. So two reasons from the Russian side Putin is genuinely interested in minimizing Russian casualties so slow steady don't leave troops outrun your your drone coverage you know and by the way he has he has stated his military objectives which is the four regions which they're he now considers Russia and then on the Ukrainian side Solansky has no room to maneuver right I mean you have this far right bender right portion of Ukraine which has zero desire for compromise and would rather sort of die trying to push the Russians out and the moment Solansky takes a step towards compromise I think his personal position would be very precarious losing wars is hard like if you just look through history admitting that you have been defeated early enough to salvage something reasonable from the situation is almost impossible and putting leaders in such positions is a no-win situation for them. And so a slow grind that ultimately inevitably ends in total defeat is sort of a boiled frog you know situation for those on the losing side of war. Again picking wars we should have a very very high barrier to like getting involved in wars because you could lose them and it as Columpal says if you don't have a plan upfront for overwhelming victory what are you doing? We had no such plan from the beginning there was no scenario where we were going to impose a kinetic defeat on Russia from afar maybe we were not even enough to think that from the beginning but after the first few months it should have been clear that that was unlikely to happen certainly after the large counteroffensive from Ukraine was defeated by Russia at that point like you know the war is over and again if you just go back through history Eric like Napoleon you know pick your favorite like people roll into Russia and then what happens they get ground down to a pulp the Russia is not afraid to fight a war of attrition and to win them. So that's where we are I think that's by the way not a controversial opinion anymore we may have been early to that opinion but I think that's broadly if you just read the economist in the financial times and the British papers are starting to come around to the fact that maybe this war is not winable and we should begin to sort of salvage what's left but it's very difficult to lose the war losing a war you know way that minimizes the totality of negativity on your country takes a level of statesmanship that is very very rare and by the way its statesmanship involves convincing the people you need to go along with it and sometimes it's just impossible so you know it again it's a terrible situation the biggest losers in all of this by far like scandalously so are the people of Ukraine you know the US can wash his hands if it Trump could wash his hands if it and there might be some mile political price to pay in the US but compared to what has happened to the people of Ukraine this has been a calamity true calamity one for which people should be held to account. In one last question on this one while we're on it I I'm trying to understand your perspective on Trump's reference to potentially let this one go with it being such a massive global focus in such a massive part of his campaign I would see it hard to look at it any other way than a colossal failure on Trump's on Trump's scorecard. Yeah yeah go ahead. No that's I think you got it. Yeah so first of all it's early for him right and if he puts some of W's on the board maybe he can wash away an L or two but I actually think more likely is for all the talk of a Trump Putin meeting I think there's going to be a Trump Putin G summit where big broad spheres of influence are delineated and Trump gets concessions in other areas and seeds Ukraine and again anybody from Ukraine listening to this will be quite angered by me characterizing it in this way and I fully understand that I'm just trying to get into Trump's head I'm not telling you what I would do now I think there's going to be some grand bargain look what is Trump focused on since since he became president Ukraine Panama Canada Colombia Mexico Venezuela Western hemisphere spheres of influence Monroe doctrine Ukraine's not on the board um it's it's a true tragedy I'm not trying to to downplay it it is a catastrophe but in a world where Trump and G and Putin get together and decide the world for the next four years it's not like we're going to be able to convince Putin to to to to turn around and just hand back Ukraine to to Europe it's just I just don't think it's going to happen and I think as traders as investors as analysts you have to see the pieces on the board as they as they are and play them accordingly or yeah one last question on this one and then um I actually want to pivot to talk to you a little bit about the whole tariff game that's happening but on the on the war as it sits what are your thoughts specifically on the way new technology is essentially reshaping the ability for smaller forces to be able to compete because obviously as you're doing your research on the battle lines I'm sure you're coming across no shortage of actual live videos or recorded videos of the conflict as it sits and you see two thousand dollars of drones knocking out fifteen million dollars of equipment so then it starts to call into question the industrial capacity and the ability to produce you know large weapons able of reaching far a lot of these missile systems and stuff like that the drones have changed all of that so how does that how does that yeah how does that fit into your analysis yeah so I would say look I mean full credit to Ukraine I mean they are the second strongest military in Europe today by a wide margin through the cold room of having to fight right um the technological development and the necessity of doing so in order to sort of stay one step ahead of your competitor has made both Russia and Ukraine far stronger um technologically than almost any other military in the world and it's only because Russia is so much bigger and has such a stronger military industrial complex to rely upon and frankly more people to uh in ties to join its army um in ties being sort of a a say purposely broad term um like Russia is a far stronger military force today out of necessity than it was when what Putin would call the special military operation commenced in 2022 far stronger than America um today and I think China has been studying this situation very carefully like Russia has a million plus strong army or you know military not just army um and they have been sort of you know trial by fire in the most like brutal disgusting horrifying way possible which is like a war in which a bunch of people die every day I think like both sides are suffering hundreds of casualties a day we see the latest um evolution of fiber optic controlled drones out of Russia have you seen these where these super thin wires like basically a giant fishing line that spans kilometers and these drones basically can't be interfered with using you know electronic um weapons and so they just are flying now with full autonomy all over the battlefield and I think this has been the most recent of the sort of technological developments that is changing the pace of change on on the front line because if you can't really use you know electronic interference weapons to distort the path and in aiming capabilities of these drones and now you literally have a hard wire drone flying through the air with a super thin fiber optic cable controlling it um that's just the latest innovation that would never have happened if the won't if this war hadn't been you know fought for the past that three years it's amazing by the way that we're coming up on three years um it's really sad actually it's a real indictment of of the current slate of western leaders that we've allowed this thing to go on that for as long as we have but yeah huge amount of technological development old weapons that cost millions of dollars a pop totally obsolete right um and then you know beyond that sort of missile development the a rejnic missile which doesn't get much press in the west but I think really shocked and open the eyes of of NATO yeah I mean it necessities the mother of invention and there's nothing more necessary than trying to win a war and we're seeing an amazing adaptation of AI and and drone technology and and all the things that should scare people you know autonomous robot technology I've seen some films of by the way I should say you don't want to watch too many of these films because there's a lot of like actual real people dying in horrific ways in the footage that you can see online and every person that you see dying as somebody's kid somebody sibling somebody's cousin somebody's friend and it's a really human tragedy and and it can yeah one thing you don't want to do is ever get sort of normalized to watching such things because it's it's quite sad can be yeah definitely can be really interesting I enjoy here in your perspective there's a lot of nuance to it there's a lot of things um yeah that I think are just a very interesting lens to apply but I'd love to pivot now and pick your brain a little bit on the the game of tariffs that's a foot is that how did you think that that was going to play out and how is it trended so far not sure if you saw but we just wrote about it um yes you're okay um and so it was top of mind for us um we have a lot of friends and connections to Canada and and we actually take Trump on on this issue we take Trump at face value um the fentanyl crisis is a real issue we're losing 100,000 people a year to overdoses in the country which is almost certainly a significant underestimation um 80 percent of those overdoses are from fentanyl a lot of those fentanyl overdoses are from people using other drugs not knowing that fentanyl has been cut in and so they overdosed by accident and they die this is a chemical war declared upon the US by China that largely targets military aged adults in the country and it's long past time that we get serious about trying to stop it most of the fentanyl that finds this way into the US comes in via Mexico or Canada and Canadians were shocked and angered and bewildered at being lumped in with Mexico as co-equal participants in this sort of fentanyl trade but as we rode in our piece undeclared there's strong circumstantial evidence to support Trump's claims and the main counter sort of arguments that the Canadian media and the Canadian government have been putting forward don't really pass mustard and don't stand up to to close scrutiny and you'll notice um you know the sort of this theory that Trump is just a economic arsonist or a madman and orange man bad and all this stuff um when he campaigned he said over and over and over and over again i will make fentanyl a top priority and how we use tariffs to convince mexico china and canada to do something about it that's what he does if you actually read the executive order that um lazy groundwork for these tariffs it begins with fentanyl within 24 hours after he announced the tariffs um both mexico and canada pledge to do substantially more on the fentanyl issue and Trump says okay let's delay the tariffs until we can negotiate a permanent settlement like it's very clear he he called a shot he explained why he was doing it he did it the moment he got movement on the main issue that was a driving force for the tariffs he relented like fentanyl is a real issue we we're losing more people of fentanyl than we lost in the battlefield of world war two like that was shock people to look at that statistic we lost 400,000 soldiers dead in world war two for the entirety of the war and we've lost that many people of fentanyl last four years five years like it's a big deal um it's destroying families and communities across the country look there's a demand side argument to be made uh and i get that um but there's more that canada and mexico and the us could do um and trump is is well within his his rights and frankly we applaud to him for finally making this uh an issue uh of the highest priority for the US federal government like it if not this than what you know like we're we're losing a hundred thousand people young people um it's a big deal and um there's far more fentanyl being producing canada than the canadiens would like to admit and beyond that the chinese gangs in canada excel um at you know uh money laundering and they've they've embarked upon a synergistic collaboration with the mexican cartels to help them turn their drug profits into money good and and and this is real and trump is uh should be applauded for for recognize now look the bluntness of tariffs and trump's sort of style and statements leave a bad taste in some people's mouth but on this particular issue um we find ourselves wholeheartedly supporting the president yeah i just like the way you framed the the modality because i agree it definitely can rub people all different kinds of ways one of the one of the things that i have to agree with you on broadly though is that in order to move things quickly you kind of have to do things that are a little i don't know brash is the right term but definitely a little heavier handed than the standard bureaucratic process of call a summit have leaders come talk about it and so on and so forth because to your broader point think of how fast there are now you know mexico setting what is it 10,000 troops you know to the mexicoside of the border just is a loose example safe with gandhi yeah yeah and that and that happened over the course of you know 48 hours so you don't really get speed like that unless you do something a little more drastic now i find an interesting exercises to think about what the next month might look like though and specifically the element that i think your expertise will probably lend in in understanding a lot better is let's say 30 days go by and they're unable to arrive at a conclusion or a deal i mean my expectation honestly is that they would because i think it's an everybody's benefit but just you know playing the scenario that maybe maybe they don't what do you think about the implementation of tariffs then the retaliatory tariffs from canada and how that might shape the broader economic picture at least in the near term three six months ish here's why deal has to happen exports from canada to the us account for 22% of canadian gdb and exports of the us to canada account for 1.5% the us should be there's just no leverage on the canadian side like trump will dictate the terms and canada will follow them that is the outcome that is in everybody's economic interest and if they don't the tariffs will come on he'll probably put them up to 50% there will be a revolution of some kind in canada and there'll be a new partner for trump to negotiate with on this one i again i have many many close friends and other associates in canada and our piece provoked all manner of responses on this one canada would be wise to be seen as doing as much as possible and by the way it's an easy off-rand like who could be opposed to rolling up fentanyl labs in rural version Columbia who could be opposed to tightening the border crossings across the rural western part of the country you're going to pay all those soldiers who have monitored the border anyway and and who could be opposed to cracking down on td bank and the money laundering that they've been accused of doing to enable a fentanyl trade like fentanyl is a dastardly drug that all law-abiding citizens should be fully supportive of of of eradicating from our our collective societies canada to by the way they canada you know loses three to four thousand citizens a year to fentanyl overdose it's not quite at the same pace even correcting for relative population than we see in the u.s but it's still material every one of those is a tragedy every one of those deaths is somebody's kid and and it should be eradicated and and the mexican cartels and the chinese cartels are deeply evil people like and we should be fighting them um mexico for example has just huge potential runway which is a piece we're pondering writing for a variety of reasons if they could just get their cartels situation on a control and i know it's been that way for decades and it's a hard problem but like the same thing in canada like look we have very strong evidence that there are dangerous chinese organized criminal elements satirating british clombian and the city of toronto mostly interfering with canada elections causing all manner of crime um blowing the property bubble in van koover in toronto like used to be that you can say such things without being accused of you know xenophobia but it's true it's real everybody knows it's real let's get a handle on it like again one of the things about trump is he just sort of has a knack for saying sort of loudly and sometimes and appropriately all the things that everybody's thinking quietly let's just go ahead and put it on the table and get it fixed so then to summarize that it sounds like your overarching expectation is arrive at a deal it's impossible impossible they wouldn't Eric i mean come on i mean 22% of your gdp i mean i mean we say that in it to be clear i actually agree with you but i mean what's the point of even starting then with retaliatory retaliatory tariffs uh you know trutos lame duck wants to be seen as strong this is an injection of uncertainty into an election campaign that was imminent and looked likely to be a deep defeat for the liberals if trump if trutos could be seen as standing up to the bully and fighting for canada then maybe whoever replaces him on the ticket stands a better chance of of minimizing the defeat that they look set to suffer to the conservatives i mean there's you know people optimize for all kinds of outcomes in situations like this and look it gave trutos a chance to be relevant again for one thing and to his credit i think he did actually a pretty good job of handling the situation certainly being portrayed as such in the Canadian media which i follow closely and you know that the as we articulated in the piece which we thought was pretty balanced this this move by trump sparked a rare moment of national political unity across canada which is not to be ignored and and isn't in consequential and so it changed the game like that the least happy person is pure polar bear you know like waiting to ascend to the throne of prime minister of canada then some of the entire rules of the game change that's not good when you have a winning hand you want stability and this is a deeply destabilizing event when you have a losing hand uh instability is a potential opportunity and so and look trutos handle it well he relied on you know there's these sort of council of us relations within canada and and lord knows within canada the stance and negotiation towards the united states is probably the most important political issue on the board and and trutos again to his credit handled this situation quite well and look i'm no fan of trutos like we've written very critically about trutos over the years especially his sort of uh totalitarian instincts around the freedom convoy and all that stuff but in this particular case isolated to the event at issue um trutos comes out looking pretty good in my view one of the things i noticed when the the tariffs are coming out i have a bunch of people in my audience that are canadian and you could definitely tell that there's a lot of people that were just kind of like pissed off about it right yeah yeah it felt like our neighbor is being lame and why is it like this and one of the arguments i saw opposed that was pretty interesting um was the fact that canada represents a really significant portion of this is right up your alley of us heavy oil imports so not crude but sand oil and the us doesn't really have deep production of that in place just yet i think that there are different ways that the us would manage through it but just to play out the scenario because it's an interesting thought exercise is tariffs let's say 30 days for whatever reason the impossibility does occur and they don't arrive at a in agreement maybe it's political maybe it's part of the to your to your broader point part of this broader election whatever the scenario is and let's just say that the scenario escalated somehow to where canada says we are going to cut sending you heavy oils now i i think that that's kind of suicide for canada but just for the lens of us how does something like that impact the us and how do you think the us would navigate through that kind of decision i'm going to give you an answer that'll surprise you um Canadians are vastly vastly overestimating the leverage that we sell the us heavy oil brings to them um refiners who are optimized to refine heavy crude prefer to refine heavy crude because they have made the investments necessary to take sulfur out of heavy crude and heavy crude tends to be cheaper that doesn't mean that they can't refine other crude and so there's this thought that if canada shuts off the spigots that somehow the us will find itself in a refined products crisis and that's just not true um we export we the us i live in us um the us exports light crude and imports heavy crude because the newest refineries out there prefer to refine light crude and the old refineries here prefer to refine heavy crude it doesn't mean they couldn't make do with the light crude that we have it be suboptimal um you know they might not run at full capacity and some of their operational units might be idle but in the long run the us which has by the way massive stores of these refined products and who go many many weeks um with you know while the refiner is retooled and and work through the inventory they have online like this is um compared to the 22% of your GDP being reliant on us exports this is no leverage at all and these are the happy stories you tell yourself when you have an leverage again i'm sort of reminded of Ukraine um the us would be in a far better place to handle a a slowdown in the imports or even a complete cessation of the imports of heavy crude from canada it would be suboptimal people wouldn't make as much money but the us gas pumps would not run dry uh you know um and by the way um it would accelerate the necessary investments needed to optimize the us refinery fleet for light grades which would then permanently reduce any leverage leading as it might be that canada might have and so when i see such commentary in the media cringe because it tells me that the people actually don't know what they're talking about and that it might uh inform political leaders to make decisions based on leverage they think they have that doesn't actually exist um you know the us petroleum industry is exceptionally sophisticated and they aren't trapped in some like oh my god we need canadian heavy crude we'd like to buy canadian heavy crude at a discount wcs as a discount and why should i pay up to buy this light crude um that others in foreign lands are willing to pay up for when i could buy my um cheap crude here and capture a bigger spread when i sell my gasoline and my jet fuel and my diesel that there's a vast difference between economic optimization and economic necessity and this is a card that i think is is wildly over exaggerated uh in the canadian media today to the canadian instrument yeah yep i fully agree with that one and the the other part that i was doing a little bit of research on is just even if we needed if the us needed to find some sort of short term replacement there are other places that produce heavy crude as well it's not globally traded yeah right it's globally we would just turn the spikets on in Venezuela i mean you know mexico but like it's produced all over the world it's it's it's floating around in cargo ships if we truly needed it we could just pay up and buy it um the us is not going to run out of gasoline diesel or jet fuel because canada turns off the taps just isn't yeah the us is a global energy superpower and the reorientation of the system given the price disparities that would temporarily materialize would only further your road canada's leverage over time right now speaking of energy and just what that might look like for the year we obviously talked last time about some of trump's policies about you know drill baby drill and the the different things that we might expect to see from an energy evolution standpoint but i'd love to get an update on any key energy themes that you guys are seeing and expect to play out this year yeah i mean you know Chris righteous you know elevated to the secretary of energy which was a big vote that we were watching very carefully earlier this week he's taking aggressive action to implement trump's agenda i'm looking at the board right now and i see wti at seventy dollars and fifty cents you know basically at the low end of opax desired managed range um sari rabia needs 95 to 105 to balance its budget that's for the the financial break even price of sari rabia opay is on its back foot um i note with great interest that the envoy that trump sent to venezuela seemed to have pretty good success in freeing some us hostages in air quotes i don't know what they were up to in venezuela but they have since been released um and other concessions being made by venezuela i'd keep a close eye on chevron's desire to get a license renewed to continue to operate in venezuela trump seems to be playing the mineral doctrine um this whole concept that we need to increase production in the us for trump to achieve his objectives which is forty dollar oil to sort of put pressure on food and maybe get a better deal in the ukraine um misses the fact that there are other ways for trump to increase global oil production right here in the western hemisphere giana venezuela um argentina i'd keep a close eye on columbia which seems to be taking a pretty uh combative stance towards trump and i wouldn't be surprised if we see regime change there um sometime this year that very interesting situation to follow um so there's plenty to do at home and trump has signaled that he's interested in doing those things at home um and it's not just the us i mean if exon mobile radically increases drilling and production in giana how is that different than the permeant basin increasing production right i mean it's an american company you know um leading uh a joint venture which actually by the way includes a chinese company um increasing global supply of oil the chinese are interested in lower oil prices too um and so you know i i just think looking at the board right now oil hugging the bottom end of the preferred managed range of opak hard to see what the catalyst are for significant upside from here interesting and i know they get a run in a couple minutes one two more questions the first one is looking at the global stage right now obviously there's so much talk about you know canada mexico russia ukrain and you mentioned earlier an important player that just has seemed to have kind of been a little more quiet until the tariff conversation earlier this week and that's china so where does china fit into the broader mix the broader global and geopolitical scale as you can see um just from like a current thematic perspective i think china is playing its cards exceptionally well as it always does i think it's a serious error to underestimate your geopolitical opponents i think if marco rubio is indeed out there talking about spheres of influence and multi polarity um this is music to chinese ears um they have been the arsenal in support of russia's imminent victory in ukrain and between those two countries and the great catastrophic geopolitical disaster of driving them together that happened in the last four years which is something the us has tried to avoid for decades by the way this strong cohesion between russia and china is going to be a formidable competitor to the us in a new multi polar world and i think china is emboldened to gradually take back tiawan and the way that it wants to which is without armed conflict um and i don't know what trump can do um in a world where where that begins to happen because it's not like we can project uh enough power from here to there especially when china controls so much of our military industrial supply chains and especially as we've learned in russia that proximity to the battlefield is is really determinative and there's nobody closer to tiawan than china i mean by definition it's right there um so um g is sitting back um the nice thing from china's perspective not necessarily for my hours but if you're china um you you don't have an urgency you know you don't have that for your electoral cycle you don't have the need to be seen as doing something consequential in your first hundred days china thinks in decades it has all the cards by doing nothing it continues to win i expect that to keep doing nothing like why would it provoke a war over tiawan now when it could just continuously and gradually and incrementally achieve with objectives in a way that doesn't disrupt its economy and doesn't force it to fight and next thing you know wake up one day in a checkmate um and i think that's what they're going to do um i think g would certainly attend a summit between putin and trump uh if for no other reason that they would know that it's two on one and i think china and russia have a pretty good read on trump by the way his ego and uh what drives him and and what his needs are and how they could jujitsu those needs for their own objectives i mean i you know if you're just being objective and you take a step back like trump is not really a complicated guy um and so it's going to be fascinating to see we are of course are nothing more than interested observers but i think china um has its own challenges internally and people point to them all the time although the same people point to various challenges in russia and never seem to materialize in anything meaningful um demographics and the property boss and all that other stuff uh i don't know it kind of reminds me of the peachy bow guys um you know anxiously looking for well-depletion rates in the premium for proof that we're about to fall off the cliff in global oil production um but nonetheless i i would say that um my own personal history in dealing with and being in and around china uh in my industrial career um they're not to be taken lightly um they play the game on a horizon that is longer than ours they're infinitely patient um they're more than happy to take the free weeks you know the free the freebies um as we as we toss them up and then wait for the next one and uh and and we shall see but i i think um the odds of a sort of kinetic conflict over ty one i think are growing down with each passing day as it becomes apparent that that would just be sort of a losing battle so um and i think that's their objective you know like uh nobody should want war um the chinese haven't really started a war that i can remember in modern history and so why would they want to sort of provoke one now uh over the ty one issue definitely and i think well i agree with the element of like supply change and stuff like that that that actually is one of the the hallmarks of us military is our ability to project power and we we've spent a lot of a lot of resources developing carrier strike groups and things like that and that's not to weigh in whether or not that's the deciding factor between winning a conflict wrapped around ty one or not but to your broader point that's just the path of more resistance for everybody and it looks like in the us we're starting to try to incentivize more domestic chip production and if that happens then the stake in ty one from the us perspective starts to wane and you know it's on and so forth so let me ask you questions you think a us carrier strike group could resist an orasnic missile attack today and you think that right you you actually think that i could be interested to see i i don't um we could agree to disagree um but if if if they can't that's a game changer you would agree right like um if certainly yeah if hyper sonic missiles can penetrate the anti missile shields of us carrier groups then us carrier groups become a lot less relevant so i mean you would certainly have more experience in this space than i do but i i would be let's put this way if russian china believe that they can't i think that we're heading for a conflict right yeah yeah well it's like it's like the same thing when china was touting their six gen fighter which is a glorified fifth gen fighter so the and complete with stolen technology right i mean yeah yeah but all right you got to run you got some stuff to do absolutely awesome connecting it's always just fascinating you know having a chance to pick your brain a little bit learn about the world around us obviously people can find you at
