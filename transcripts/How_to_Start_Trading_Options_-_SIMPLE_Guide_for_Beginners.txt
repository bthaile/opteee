0.08s: how to start trading without the BS the
2.08s: goal of this video is to walk you
3.56s: through the exact advice I would give
5.68s: myself if I were to start trading again
8.40s: or if I could talk to myself back in
10.44s: 2007 when I first started
19.80s: trading what the idea here is to share
23.48s: the most pertinent details I think to
27.00s: get off to a good start because most
30.00s: most people don't I know I didn't so
32.28s: this is an opportunity to learn from
34.12s: other people's mistakes what's up
35.60s: everybody Eric K welcome back to the
37.12s: outliers and a shout out to the patreon
38.84s: family you guys make content like this
40.44s: possible for everybody else and let's
42.76s: get straight into it so how to start
44.96s: trading there's three things we're going
46.48s: to cover we're going to cover
47.68s: motivations landscape and then the
49.96s: specific advice I would give myself so
51.48s: what is motivations simple make money
53.28s: that's why we trade there are different
55.20s: kinds of money we want to make some of
56.72s: us want to make a whole bunch of money
58.12s: some of us just want to make enough
59.44s: income some of us want to be able to
60.96s: quit our 9o5 but that is the entire
62.92s: reason to start this why would I spend
65.20s: the time talking about this because this
67.96s: is a massively important psychological
71.44s: undertone that you have to be aware of
73.84s: as we go through this whole process
75.56s: because we all want to make money fast
78.28s: there's a lot of desperation depending
80.04s: on your individual scenario to make
81.88s: enough money there is a lot of
83.44s: psychological forces that impact this
86.36s: entire two-word line that you have to
89.20s: integrate into the rest of this
90.44s: conversation so what's the landscape
92.56s: well in short there's two primary groups
95.08s: of people there's retail Traders which
96.68s: is you and I and then there's
97.72s: institutions this is known as the smart
99.48s: money these are the broker broker
101.24s: dealers market makers hedge funds
103.04s: Pension funds d d d here's the cut and
105.28s: dry retail has pretty much all
108.04s: disadvantages there's a handful of very
110.12s: small advantages that we do have but
112.12s: most of it is disadvantaged we are
114.00s: competing in an insanely competitive
116.84s: space that we have no advantages in so
119.16s: it is so so important again to keep that
122.24s: in the back of your mind because if
124.64s: that's the case how can we be successful
127.60s: well that's kind of what we're going to
128.88s: talk about but if you want to understand
130.20s: a little bit more about this retail
132.12s: versus institutions concept I'll throw a
134.28s: link in the notes below so you can check
136.08s: out a video that I did diving pretty
138.08s: deep into detail on this exact thing so
140.12s: let's take a look at what this looks
141.28s: like for us because realistically it's
143.40s: not good most Traders lose there are a
146.64s: lot of studies that elucidate this point
148.88s: I'm not going to run through each one of
150.32s: them and you might be thinking Eric why
152.80s: are you saying this if the idea is to
154.68s: talk about how to start trading it is
156.72s: because I think the biggest mistake
158.60s: people can make is that they don't fully
161.12s: understand the landscape that they're
162.28s: stepping into which has a lot of
163.96s: carry-on negative effects if you going
166.12s: to climb Mount Everest don't you want to
168.64s: know how difficult it is how long it
170.76s: typically takes what gear you need all
172.72s: of those sorts of details so that you
174.64s: can then put in the right amount of
176.48s: research the right amount of training to
178.44s: ultimately be success successful and
180.64s: Conquer a very difficult Endeavor it is
183.24s: the same thing with trading pretending
185.28s: as if this is easy that with this one
187.08s: magic indicator you can learn everything
188.96s: you need to know it's all there
191.88s: is no easy money out there the sooner
194.92s: you can accept that the sooner you can
197.16s: put in the requisite amount of work in
199.64s: order to be successful I make no mistake
202.64s: about it I have spent thousands
204.68s: literally tens of thousands of hours
206.76s: doing this and it's because I became
209.08s: that committed over time but I didn't
211.36s: necessarily start like that so let's now
214.68s: talk about this specific advice the very
216.80s: first thing I have here is to define the
219.76s: objectives that I have so why does this
222.92s: matter so much well first let's start
225.24s: with the why why do I care about trading
227.84s: the reason why I'm taking this step off
229.36s: to the side is because the reason why
231.92s: I'm interested in trading will directly
234.08s: impact the objectives of my trading so
236.88s: what's the average net worth for the
239.36s: typical typical American well if we take
241.44s: a look at this chart for my age group
243.44s: which is 32 younger than 35 the average
245.76s: is
246.36s: $76,000 the median is $144,000 that's
252.44s: awful and to kind of make this even
255.12s: worse I grew up poor I know what it's
258.72s: like to not have money I know what it's
261.12s: like to stress over everything because
263.72s: you can't handle any surprise expenses
266.28s: that come up I remember there were days
267.76s: that I would go to school without enough
269.32s: lunch money and if it wasn't for the
271.48s: lunch ladies who took pity on me
273.40s: literally pity that gave me food for
275.56s: free I would not have eaten how it goes
278.92s: so the average person does not live a
282.04s: super lavish life they live a pretty
283.76s: uncomfortable life and if you look at
285.52s: even more statistics like the most
287.16s: common argument points between married
289.04s: couples it's typically money that's one
290.68s: of the biggest ones so anyways let's
292.20s: continue just understanding why this
294.28s: matters so much if we look down here the
297.36s: average annual expenditures for the US
299.12s: household is $73,000 compared to the
302.04s: average earnings in 2022 which is
304.44s: $94,000 we're not saving anything so
307.12s: think about how long you would have to
309.40s: work in order to save up for a
311.40s: retirement this entire concept just is
314.24s: so unappealing to me the idea that you
316.44s: have to work 50 years in a job that you
318.84s: may or may not like hopefully you like
320.44s: it but most people don't to then just
322.88s: enjoy the last bit of your life that
325.36s: sucks man plus I also had some bigger
328.12s: pressures Weighing on me I a single mom
330.56s: that she sacrificed so much to try to
333.04s: raise me and my brother's best she could
334.92s: and I have to take care of her that's an
336.68s: obligation that I've taken upon myself I
338.56s: cover her expenses now because of the
340.52s: outcome of this stuff but that is a big
343.12s: part of the motivation behind it so
345.20s: let's take a look at how this all comes
347.24s: together the why summarized if I look at
350.08s: a compound growth calculator which you
352.32s: can check out this exact one on my
355.44s: website which I will link in the notes
357.40s: below we can see that some good savings
359.96s: habits can make a giant difference I
362.00s: started trading when I was in high
363.36s: school so I was just tinkering with
365.44s: different numbers to see where I could
367.20s: get in what time frame and I realized
370.32s: that from $220,000 starting amount which
372.84s: that's not what I had I literally had
374.04s: like 2500 bucks but I knew that I was
376.32s: going to go into the Marines as an
377.80s: officer I knew that I was going to be
379.04s: able to save so this is just part of my
380.72s: planning I saw $20,000 with additional
383.64s: $750 on average which ideally it would
386.84s: be more than this in the long run but
388.88s: that's just on average and when you
390.56s: first start your career you're going to
391.96s: have a much smaller amount you can save
393.76s: over 20 years at a 15% return it yields
397.84s: $1.25 million that's not too bad for
401.32s: becoming a millionaire before
403.16s: essentially you're 40 I was able to
405.68s: greatly accelerate this by Saving far
408.44s: more aggressively than this and having a
410.28s: much better return than this but this is
412.40s: to share the power of
418.40s: trading
421.36s: if you can be an outlier and one of
424.44s: those small groups of people that can
426.44s: make this work for you you can
428.44s: drastically change your life so with
431.72s: that as the why let's talk about these
434.76s: objectives because this is where the we
437.04s: get down to the details this is where
438.68s: the rubber meets the road so these are
440.80s: kind of the first primary objectives
443.08s: that I think Traders should have when
445.60s: they first start out this is exactly
447.28s: what I would tell myself the very first
449.00s: one is is to develop the skill set the
450.76s: second thing is to avoid draw Downs why
453.36s: avoid draw Downs easy if you take a look
455.92s: at this up here which my editor will be
458.76s: kind enough to zoom in for you you got
460.68s: it pal you can see the impact of draw
464.04s: Downs on these different portfolios so
466.44s: if you can create consistent returns you
469.88s: can increase your leverage logically and
472.80s: by avoiding draw Downs you are not
474.88s: moving your starting point so far to the
477.24s: left because if you look at this side
478.80s: over here the Lost recovery you'll see
481.64s: that big draw Downs require big positive
485.64s: returns in order to compensate
487.72s: inordinately large and again this is
490.20s: also on my website if you want to
492.12s: download it so that you have it as a
493.56s: reference I think these things are
495.28s: really important to keep in mind notice
497.20s: how I have save here saving is so
500.36s: important I cannot say it enough this is
503.36s: probably your biggest determining Factor
506.00s: how successful you'll be early on
507.64s: because guess what your ensity to take a
510.36s: very small amount of money and to trade
512.36s: it into your future wealth is next to
514.96s: zero not impossible but it is so
518.28s: improbable that to me it wasn't worth my
521.12s: effort so what was worth my effort was
523.52s: saving super aggressively and then once
526.40s: we get through these three primary
528.88s: objectives this is where you get to
530.56s: outline the rest of your objectives for
532.52s: me it was return at least 15% per year
535.52s: and then I set different draw down
537.32s: specifications that I could withstand so
539.64s: those are the primary objectives this is
542.08s: the second thing I would say to myself
544.16s: after that after we go through these
545.76s: objectives is how serious are you about
549.20s: this because trading is not a hobby it
553.08s: is not a good hobby this is one of the
556.16s: easiest ways to lose a bunch of money if
559.24s: you are not dead set on making this work
562.12s: and fully applying yourself to see if
564.20s: you can make it work just switch over to
566.20s: buy and hold you can do great with that
568.68s: approach you can still become a
570.36s: millionaire much earlier than if you
572.08s: don't do that especially if you couple
573.84s: it with aggressively saving not as
575.76s: quickly as you can if you're a really
577.44s: good Trader but still quickly enough and
580.16s: if you are not in the right mindset to
581.72s: take this as seriously as you need to
583.56s: your life literally literally depends on
586.36s: it so now we need to create a timeline
588.56s: for me this is what I would tell myself
590.36s: in year one paper trade that full first
593.52s: year this is to assess our skill set
596.36s: which we'll talk about later year two
598.36s: the goal would be be profitable so this
600.48s: is when we start scaling in with real
602.16s: money and the only objective I have is
604.00s: to make money and avoid draw Downs year
606.36s: three would be to Pace the market year
608.44s: four year five is where we start
609.96s: outperforming the market year five plus
612.36s: is when we're getting super consistent
615.12s: in our work so once we have the timeline
618.08s: we have our objectives guess what you
619.60s: just started whether you realize it or
621.12s: not your trading plan this is probably
623.72s: the most revolutionary thing that I
625.40s: integrated into my Approach and hands
628.20s: down what I contribute My Success to I
630.40s: have a video in the notes below that
632.52s: goes through this in Intimate detail
635.04s: it's like a 25-minute video but the
636.88s: whole point of a trading plan and
638.68s: trading log is to create documentation
640.88s: so that you can test what works validate
643.32s: with quantitative information and then
645.60s: overtime refine your approach so that
647.24s: you can be more successful next up is
649.40s: super simple once this is all started
651.40s: which literally can take a day that's
653.20s: why it's listed out in this order this
654.80s: should take about a day it's something
656.20s: that will evolve over time but it
657.56s: doesn't take a bunch of time start
659.56s: putting your money to work immediately
661.28s: even just getting into Buy and Hold in
663.48s: the S&P 500 because if you go all the
665.64s: way back to the first thing the whole
667.20s: impetus for starting to trade is to make
669.16s: money so there's a sense of urgency
671.48s: whether it's conscious or subconscious
672.96s: it exists so by doing this while you're
675.48s: taking this first year to paper trade
677.80s: you're not wasting that time there's not
680.16s: that psychological pressure that oh I
681.88s: have to figure this out super fast
683.36s: because you're putting yourself in a
685.28s: great spot your money is working and
688.04s: realistically this is what most people
690.16s: should end up doing anyways in my
691.52s: opinion is this so you're just getting
693.56s: started early you don't have that same
695.60s: psychological pressure now why do I
698.32s: think about paper trading for the first
699.88s: year and would I follow this myself God
701.92s: honest probably not I don't think I
703.56s: would I think a realistic Target would
705.40s: be to paper trade at least for 6 months
707.72s: that I think is reasonable the whole
709.48s: reason why I talk so much about paper
711.08s: trading is because it is probably the
712.84s: most efficient way you can learn this
715.16s: early on there's so many stupid mistakes
717.84s: you're going to make that that there's
719.72s: no reason to start lighting money on
722.68s: fire because you're that impatient you
724.88s: are not doing yourself any favors you're
727.52s: not accelerating your time frame by
729.60s: starting trading real money too fast
731.52s: you're not the only thing you're going
732.72s: to do is lose money and the only thing
734.72s: that does is slide your starting point
737.76s: back now the critics will say oh my God
740.32s: Eric this is the critic Voice by the way
742.24s: oh my God Eric real trading is Never
744.80s: replicable by paper trading yeah no
747.36s: Sherlock but that doesn't mean there's
749.20s: still not a ton of value to derive from
751.56s: paper trading a lot of people will say
753.36s: it's not the same as real trading it's
754.72s: not it'll never be fully the same but if
756.68s: you can't take paper trading seriously
759.00s: because you lack that discipline you're
760.40s: not going to magically grow discipline
762.40s: when real money's on the line it's the
764.20s: worst possible way to think about
766.16s: trading if you cannot take paper trading
768.68s: seriously you have no business actually
770.64s: trading because that amount of work is
772.56s: requisite you have to do it so to
775.04s: summarize how I would start trading in a
777.28s: nutshell Define my objectives create a
779.72s: reasonable timeline start my trading
781.76s: plan with those first two bullet points
783.64s: get my money into the S&P 500 with a
786.00s: really really really aggressive savings
788.04s: rate month over month and then get into
790.32s: paper trading to start building that
791.64s: skill set start building a data set that
793.64s: I can analyze and overall commit to the
796.88s: process because in order to succeed here
800.00s: you have to be a statistical outlier so
803.48s: that means you have to put in the work
806.24s: that others aren't willing to do being
808.84s: outlier I'll see you later
