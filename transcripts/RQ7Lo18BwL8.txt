0.00s: We have a gift from the Volga
3.00s: today the Seabull launched the
7.00s: one day VIX and for those
9.00s: that don't know the VIX VIX
12.00s: typically looks out 30 days.
14.00s: So I want to talk to you about
16.00s: this product, what it is, how
18.00s: it works, and then how you can
20.00s: use it. What's up, everybody?
21.00s: Eric here. Welcome back to all
23.00s: the outliers. Shout out to the
25.00s: Patreon family. Thank you guys
26.00s: so much for the love. I cannot
28.00s: tell you how awesome it is.
29.00s: Why do we need or why do we
31.00s: now have a one day volatility
33.00s: index and it's because of demand.
35.00s: And I'm going to show you a
37.00s: chart in just a second that
38.00s: shows you the disposition of
40.00s: zero DTE SPX utilization by
44.00s: traders and it's massive. But
46.00s: this is what we have now.
48.00s: This is kind of like this
49.00s: standard, which is VIX. And as
51.00s: I mentioned, this is a 30 day
53.00s: future volatility of SPX.
56.00s: Now it's important to note that
58.00s: because it looks out 30 days, it
60.00s: loses a lot of sensitivity in
62.00s: super short term time frames.
64.00s: So there's two things that
65.00s: coalesce here. We have a gap
67.00s: for that kind of product and
68.00s: we have a dramatic rise in the
71.00s: use of short term options. I
73.00s: want you to take a look. This
74.00s: is from Goldman Sachs and
76.00s: this is from March or April.
78.00s: And I want to show you guys
81.00s: actually of this year. I lied
83.00s: to you because this shows us
84.00s: Q123. So yeah, this is super
86.00s: recent. And as you look at this
88.00s: dark blue, this is less than
90.00s: 24 hours of SPX volume. Notice
93.00s: what it was back in 2011.
95.00s: It was what like two, three
97.00s: percent, something like that.
99.00s: Notice word is now. And this
101.00s: is all kind of kicked off post
103.00s: COVID when we first had COVID
105.00s: back here. You can see a
107.00s: dramatic increase. And then
108.00s: it's just been parabolic since
110.00s: whereas now it's literally over
112.00s: 40% of SPX volume. And
115.00s: this is a huge amount of
119.00s: time frame. So there's a giant
121.00s: demand for short term offerings
123.00s: here, but we don't have anything
125.00s: at least before today that gave
127.00s: us an intraday view to align
129.00s: with this increased demand. So
132.00s: let's talk about how it works.
134.00s: It's a non-tradable product.
137.00s: It's just like the VIX one
139.00s: year for those that have seen it.
140.00s: So here today is the 24th of
143.00s: the year. We're going to talk
145.00s: about the quality of how this
147.00s: moved because everybody's
149.00s: baffled with what happened
151.00s: today and how it behaved. But
153.00s: that is a little bit later. I
155.00s: want to show you the product
157.00s: itself. So if we go over here to
159.00s: trade, notice it has no options.
161.00s: It has no bid, no ask. So this is
163.00s: merely a calculation. And I'll
165.00s: show you the computation in a
167.00s: second. And for those that don't
169.00s: know because a lot of people think
171.00s: that VIX one year is the same
173.00s: exact thing, but it just goes out
175.00s: for a you guessed it full year. So
177.00s: if you go in here to trade, no
179.00s: bid, no ask, no options. Same
181.00s: exact thing. It's not a tradable
183.00s: product. It is literally just
185.00s: something for us to observe and to
187.00s: use as a tool. Now does this mean
189.00s: that the VIX one day would never be
191.00s: tradable? Maybe, maybe not. Who
193.00s: knows? They could make it a tradable
195.00s: product. But based on the press
197.00s: released from the sea, both
199.00s: and in the last video. So with
201.00s: the next look, I'll show you a
203.00s: couple of things. I want to go
205.00s: first. And I want to show you a
207.00s: couple of things. I want to show you
209.00s: a couple of things. The one day
211.00s: VIX is not a single thing. It's
213.00s: really not as crazy as it looks.
215.00s: Essentially, it's using an
217.00s: aggregate of weighted prices from
219.00s: zero in one day to expiration,
221.00s: SPX options that expire in the
223.00s: afternoon. Calls and puts. That
225.00s: But nonetheless, this is what I think you guys should definitely take a look at.
230.72s: And this is from the Seabull.
232.44s: Like I said, I'll throw a link to this.
233.92s: But if you go down here to the bottom, you can see where it says the index methodology
238.16s: paper, which is very well written.
241.04s: And it walks you through exactly how this thing works.
244.44s: So and it walks you through in steps.
247.32s: So I'm not going to go through all of this in detail because you have access to it.
250.32s: If you have any questions on it, make sure you let me know.
253.12s: But the cool part about this product and the way that we can use it is it gives you
258.88s: much better fidelity on short term volatility.
263.44s: And it's because today we had nothing that really told us in today unless you calculated
267.64s: it yourself, what you can.
269.36s: But now for most people that don't want to do that, you have something that is going
275.00s: to give you the calculation by itself.
277.80s: So if we take a look at the VIX one day by itself, we can start to chart and create relationships.
288.16s: This is one of the first ways I would use it between the VIX one day and SPX, the biggest
292.60s: products in the SPX so that you can understand when this thing moves, how other things move.
298.76s: Because what I will tell you is the market movement that we saw today was a little bit
305.00s: tricky compared to what the VIX one day showed us.
307.92s: And what I mean by that is if I pull up SPX and let's zoom in from this to let's do it today one
316.24s: minute. So you can see the intraday volatility here.
319.84s: The percentage move today was 0.6%.
323.08s: The five day daily range is 0.68%.
327.32s: And then the 30 day average true range is smaller than that.
330.16s: That calculation is wrong.
331.96s: I have to check the formula here.
333.16s: Don't look at that.
334.04s: But this is correct.
335.60s: The five day average daily range.
338.16s: So as we look at the way it moved today, we had an open at 4132, high of 41 42, a low of 4117.
347.16s: So this was a pretty inside day.
349.24s: There wasn't anything remarkable about this, especially if we look back over a longer time frame.
356.68s: Where we can see definitely some larger movements, intraday going back, you know, the last three days.
363.44s: So the reason why this is important is because this tells me that the VIX one day, the computation, the way it's getting the data,
370.20s: it's still kind of figuring itself out.
372.08s: And I think that's an important note.
373.80s: I wouldn't use this for any sort of significant trading decisions just yet until we understand how it behaves,
381.04s: how the market behaves around it, what it correlates to, how strong those correlations are.
386.68s: One of the things that I think pretty much all traders need to consider is how something works before you trade it.
396.44s: You can figure it out pretty quick, but today,
399.64s: parts from what most of us would have expected this thing to do.
402.96s: So that is an important note because most of us obviously need to observe a little bit more on how this product is going to behave longer term.
410.84s: So the little too early, we're an information gathering mode, but what I would ultra highly recommend is take a look at how this behaves over the set time frame, whatever you want to do the next week, two weeks.
421.28s: And then take a look at the SPX definitely maybe one of the other indices like the Russell, but then pick a handful of individual stocks from within the S&P 500.
431.00s: And then you can start creating pairs correlations between them, which can be a really interesting trade idea.
435.84s: So too early right now, but something for the back pocket, if you have any questions on it, let me know all those links in the notes below, be an outlier.
442.04s: I'll see you guys later.
