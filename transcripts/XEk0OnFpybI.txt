1046.00s:  I
1048.00s:  am
1049.00s:  very common. Then if you take a look at the 28 March, you can see 123 percent vol. That's
1055.56s:  actually heavy vol on a comparative basis. Now, this is absolutely something I'm going to
1062.20s:  trade this week on the coverage strangle that I have in GameStop. I'm going to adjust it
1068.12s:  to trade the earnings vol because it's so heavy. And with the coverage strangle, I'm effectively
1072.84s:  trading short call, short put, which is a standard earnings play. But in the scenario of
1079.40s:  the coverage strangle, I really don't care which way it goes. I don't have to worry about taking it
1083.40s:  down and just realizing the vaults. I'll leave side of the trade. There's another element of
1087.56s:  the position. So I'm definitely going to trade this vault because it's very high. Now, if we take
1092.68s:  a look at the total positioning, I don't believe that this is correct. 2000 against 3000. I don't think
1101.64s:  there we go. That's more correct. 571 against 175. Now, let's take a look in the 28 March, 41 against 10.
1110.04s:  So that's roughly, roughly, 4 to 1, not quite. 21 March is 110 against 30. So still very heavy
1120.84s:  in the front expiration, very heavy in the front expiration. And I don't see any sort of anomalous
1127.48s:  heavy call versus put volume or open interest leading into earnings compared to everything else.
1133.72s:  It looks like it's generally just kind of spread across the board here. So that informs me that it
1140.12s:  doesn't look like there's a bunch of people positioning right now heavily into the earnings move.
1145.08s:  That's all. Sometimes you can pick up small cues like that leading into earnings. If something has
1151.56s:  anomalous put call skew or in terms of open interest or big heavy volume leading into earnings,
1158.84s:  which typically would start about last week through this week. If people are going to be positioning
1163.88s:  heavy, you know, with some sort of expectation of a move, but that's not happening right now.
1169.24s:  So just kind of a standard earnings release. We'll see how it goes. So all that stuff aside,
1174.84s:  do you guys have any questions on GameStop specifically just the overarching landscape that we're in,
1182.28s:  anything like that. And then if not, I'm going to pivot us over into the DD library. So I'll
1188.44s:  give you guys a second if you have anything that you want to take a look at.
1193.48s:  I haven't gotten any emails about GameStop in a while. So my sense of things is that
1201.72s:  the longer term GameStop holders are kind of hunkering down here and just continuing to hold.
1208.84s:  And I think a lot of the more transient people that kind of get super interested when things are
1216.28s:  super active. I get the sense that a lot of that is starting to fall off and strip away.
1222.28s:  The other thing I've been noticing is I used to get a lot of emails with different expectations
1229.72s:  and different theories around GameStop and you know, the cycles and all that stuff. And I've
1235.80s:  all about stopped getting those kinds of emails, which again leads me to believe that a lot of
1240.52s:  people are starting to see that the theories aren't necessarily playing out. So yeah, just to
1248.28s:  give you brought our context on what I'm seeing from my perspective. Oh, let's get into the DD library.
1256.68s:  forgot where we left off. I know that we did
1259.96s:  lower. I think we might have done this one, the iceberg order. Yeah, we did this one for sure.
1265.48s:  So I think we have this one next, which is the Moas preparation guide by Socrates. That's
1272.92s:  actually really great. H says on the coverage triangle adjustments, are you taking everything
1277.88s:  down and shuffling to the closest DTE post earnings? And what are you basing your delta's on?
1283.16s:  Great question. So what I'm going to do is evaluate what I have out, which I actually don't know.
1290.84s:  I'll tell you right now. Right now I'm dominantly out in 17 April. So I have some short puts out there
1301.96s:  that I almost expect to be able to roll them in time, meaning come in and time. So if we take a
1310.92s:  look at 28 March, I have the 23s and the 21s. The 23s are at the money. And let's see what those
1320.04s:  are trading for right now. So they're trading for two 15 ice sold them for two.
1327.24s:  So those are losing 15 cents. So what I might do is just take them down for a 15 cent loss.
1335.40s:  Just take it on the chin, eat it, and then take it into the 28 March and actually reestablish
1344.04s:  somewhere in here, probably like the 22s. But what I would do is size them up a little bit. So I
1350.12s:  would move from a five lot to a six lot, I think. And then I also have the 21s that are here in
1356.92s:  17 April, the 21s are currently trading for a small discount than what I got them for. I sold
1364.36s:  them for 153. They're trading, call it like 112. So for that one, I'll probably just take those
1372.52s:  down. I'll take those down for a tiny profit. And then I'll scoot them in as well. So I'll use that
1379.88s:  too lot to size up the the 23s that I'm going to take down for again, like a probably a $15
1387.64s:  loss. And then I'll fully establish the short puts in this expiration cycle. And then on the call
1395.56s:  side of things, I literally just adjusted those. But I have the 17 April, the 28s. And those were
1405.64s:  out for a dollar. So those were already in profit. So I'll take those in as well. Oh, wrong one.
1411.56s:  I was going to say that seemed way too fast. The 28s. Yeah. So those are trading about break. So
1420.28s:  what I would do for these is probably after the weekend, a little bit will come out of these.
1425.24s:  And hopefully with the vol siphoning into the front expiration, a little more vol will come out.
1431.48s:  So I'd be able to take these down close to a scratch. And then I will move those in as well. So those
1438.52s:  will come into 28 March. And then I'll probably re-center those on.
1445.96s:  Guess in like the 26s, the danger with the 26s is my basis right now is 28. So I wouldn't want to get
1454.68s:  too deep on the basis, especially around earnings, because things can move pretty heavily. But I
1460.04s:  would feel comfortable with the 26s. I think that that's completely fine. Unburdened croissants
1467.48s:  says was dexter into coverage triangles. It's funny that you mentioned dexter because I
1475.00s:  never really watched the show. I think I watched maybe like one episode because the idea sounded
1480.20s:  kind of entertaining. And I just remember the scene where he essentially like made a kill room,
1489.40s:  right? Like you put up all the plastic and stuff to do his thing. And what sticks out to me,
1495.88s:  unburdened croissant is I was literally just talking with my mother-in-law. She's an artist.
1503.32s:  She makes different paintings. I don't really care that much about art, to be honest. But like,
1508.68s:  because it's from my mother-in-law, I just love it. I love her skill. Like this, she did this.
1514.92s:  That's actually of my actual car. I kind of can't see the whole thing. But like she painted that.
1521.00s:  So everyone's in a while. I'll hit her up and see if I can convince her to do something new.
1526.12s:  Long story short, she just got new carpet in. And I used that same reference effectively. I was
1533.40s:  just like, oh, we're going to have to set you up with like a dexter room. So I think it's kind of
1538.28s:  wild that there's been two dexter references within like three days for a show that's old as
1545.00s:  fuck. And I don't think anybody watches. So that made me chuckle. And to take a guess at that,
1555.24s:  I have to think so, right? Because I think he did like the plastic bag, which is exactly what that
1560.92s:  is. So yeah, I think you're right. I think you're dead on the money. Dead on the money.
1569.24s:  H, does that answer your question though with respect to what I'm basing the Delta?
1575.72s:  The Delta is always just based on the kind of risk that I want the position to have.
1580.84s:  With bringing them in so far, these options are going to have a ridiculous amount of gamma
1585.72s:  comparatively. So that means that the Delta is going to change super, super fast. And
1592.84s:  that's just kind of what is expected for something that moves as heavy as game stop.
1599.08s:  But that's also why I wouldn't trade naked earnings with something like game stop.
1604.68s:  Normal earnings place to play the volatility contraction is like selling a straddle,
1609.24s:  selling a strangle. But a big way that you manage risks in those kind of positions is through the
1615.00s:  sizing of the trade. But unfortunately, the sizing itself wouldn't be enough in this kind of
1622.68s:  trade for me at least. So what I do here is I would either spread off the risk or I would force
1633.80s:  a absolutely the smallest position I could think of. And the reason for that is because through
1641.00s:  earnings, you can have things that really start to bounce around and move a lot. So you can have
1647.24s:  a really dangerous position, kind of like holding a little bit of a hand grenade through
1652.20s:  an earnings release. So there's ways to do it responsibly in something like this. If I wanted to
1655.64s:  trade earnings outright, I would cap the risk. I would buy the wings somewhere. But because the
1662.28s:  covered strangle it already is a covered position. So it doesn't matter to me. Cool. Let's now take a look
1672.04s:  at I actually think we might have read this one. Okay, yes. So we read the old one. I remember
1681.00s:  seeing this one. So they're talking about the Moas preparation guide, which it's good to be prepared.
1690.44s:  They're talking about what they're going to do. Having, yeah, so this is all stuff that we've seen.
1705.64s:  Yeah, I mean, unless there's anything in particular as I flip through this, that's interesting to
1709.88s:  you guys that you want to look at. There's really nothing to there's really nothing to highlight.
1725.96s:  Do you feel bad that I don't think they had I don't think they got their move yet?
1734.68s:  Okay. I remember seeing a little bit about this one a little while ago when we read the original
1746.36s:  one and it's fine. The thing that I appreciated about it is that it was talking about planning.
1751.64s:  And anybody that knows me and what I do as a trader, like I actually really respect the planning
1757.24s:  side of things, but I mean, a lot of it's just kind of I don't know. It's hard for me to put a word on it.
1764.44s:  So yeah. Hey, yo, why not? What up? Age says that does been starting to get my port adjusted to
1773.56s:  have more short theta against it. And I've enjoyed learning about the thought presses for your videos
1779.80s:  and these streams. That's awesome. Yeah, that's that's literally one of my primary objectives for
1785.24s:  showing you all the coverage strangle and literally using my own money and a small allocation for
1790.28s:  it because for those that don't know what I did is I pulled the community and I said like, what's
1796.12s:  an average size for game stop holdings for people? And that's how we arrived at using $25,000. So I
1803.64s:  just took 25k and then I put it into a coverage strangle allocation to trade game stop and to use it
1810.28s:  as an opportunity to show people like different ways to use that kind of strategy, which I really do
1816.76s:  think are highly relevant to you. And the reason why I think it's so relevant is I think we have it
1823.48s:  in here. Are these the latest? Is this 90? Yeah, this is the latest. So the reason why I think it's
1831.80s:  relevant is because if we take a look at the move in game stop from when I started this exercise,
1840.36s:  I tracked the price from when I started the exercise, which was 2431. And the current price,
1847.08s:  this is saying is 2305. So that represents a 5% decline, a 5.2% change. If you take a look at the
1857.48s:  portfolio as it sits, I am literally sitting on an unrealized loss right now. And even though the
1867.80s:  stock itself is losing 1,300 bucks, this is in the open trade that sits that 1,300 bucks is still
1877.32s:  being overwhelmed by the rest of the money that's being made from here, here, here, and here.
1886.52s:  There's 2540 right now in total option premium that's either realized or open right tied to the
1896.20s:  broader trade. So the reason why this matters is because even though the trade itself is slowly working,
1910.52s:  it's not doing exactly what we wanted to do just yet, but that's kind of how she goes. With that,
1917.80s:  as the case, the position itself is still profitable for me. Based on the capital that I have in the
1924.20s:  trade, it's actually a 7.5% up, 7.5%. While the broader market is down for the underlying, I'm trading
1932.60s:  of 5.2%. That's the whole point of the coverage triangle. The coverage triangle isn't going to look
1938.20s:  super sexy when the market's going straight up. That's when you have to increase your shares.
1943.00s:  But with the market doing what it is now, that's why I've pivoted so hard where the stock
1948.28s:  requirement is so very light and the cash secured put requirement is much heavier. It allows me to do
1955.08s:  this. And again, this is nothing crazy. It's nothing to write home about. I'm not sitting here saying,
1960.84s:  like, wow, this is the coolest stuff on earth, but this is what I implore people to remember. This
1967.48s:  is a sustainable way to use options to amplify in equity position. Again, I know that the
1978.28s:  sustainable path isn't necessarily the sexiest path, but it's working. It's something to think
1987.08s:  about. Because right now, in terms of a realized PNL of 1478 from when I started, I can now buy
1997.08s:  $1,500 more of GameStop than when I first started. And the person that just bought
2004.68s:  inheld equity right now, their overall value is down 5%. So that's the big difference here.
2011.32s:  And that's why I think that this is something I hope that you find useful. I don't know if you
2017.32s:  guys can hear that there's a helicopter flying over my house. Let's see if I can figure it.
2028.12s:  Teach 53.
2032.12s:  All right, spider says I picked up some call options yesterday. GameStop may second second.
2039.08s:  Oh, hold on. GameStop may second 24. Execution price 238. What do you think?
2048.28s:  I assume spider that you bought them. Is that a correct assumption? And if anybody else has a
2058.92s:  position that you want to look at in GameStop, now's a perfect time to happy to do it. Like we can
2064.04s:  go back and forth between the DD and what you all have going on. Let's see. You're out in 2 May.
2071.00s:  Drake price is 24. I mean, I don't like it. I don't like to trade at all personally.
2085.64s:  Yeah, I think that I think that that's a really tough trade.
2091.88s:  The spider says why I curious. Yeah, happy to, happy to expand. I don't like just saying like,
2103.96s:  don't like it and leave it at that. But I also don't like overvalenteering my opinion if people
2108.12s:  don't want it. So yeah, happy to explain a bunch of things. The first thing. I don't like using
2115.40s:  the weekly explorations because take a look at the bid-ass spread. It's almost a dollar wide.
2122.36s:  It's absolutely atrocious in terms of the liquidity that you're getting here. So let's take a look.
2129.96s:  This is a really great exercise. What the hell's all this stuff? Get to that later. This one we can,
2138.76s:  this can all move. Over there. I want to show you something.
2146.84s:  So if we take a look at your position, which is, let's take a look at today.
2156.60s:  And then you're in 2 May. You're looking at the 24 strike. The bid right now is 1.8. The
2165.24s:  offer is 2.62. So let's just get some context here on what this is.
2179.40s:  So this is your strike price. This is the bid. This is the offer.
2185.56s:  If we take a look at the bid-ass spread.
2199.48s:  It's 82 cents. If we take that 82 cents and normalize it.
2206.92s:  It
2214.92s:  into a ratio. The back ratio. It's not really a term. I just make it up. All I'm doing is I'm saying,
2224.44s:  okay, based on the strike price, how wide is this bid-ass spread? So there's, I mean,
2233.32s:  it doesn't really matter which way you choose to do the ratio. I normally do the spread itself as
2238.28s:  a percentage. So the spread itself represents a 3.42. It's 3.42 of the strike that you're trying to
2248.68s:  trade. And that doesn't mean anything to you. And I don't expect it will. But let's take a look at
2254.28s:  something else for a comparison. Just for a benchmark. Let's take a look at Apple. We'll use
2261.48s:  the same expiration to start and we'll use the same at the monies.
2268.68s:  So for this Apple trade using the same expiration, the strike here that we're looking at is the 215.
2275.72s:  So 215, these are offered at 930. I'm sorry, bid at 930, offered at 980.
2283.16s:  And then these we can just drag them down. Let's take a look at them by comparison. What do you
2287.64s:  notice? What jumps out at you right from, right from the get go? What's the difference here?
2299.72s:  Absolutely massive liquidity difference. Literally a tremendous liquidity difference. So when
2309.80s:  traders like you unknowingly go into these kinds of options literally like genuinely the only
2318.36s:  thing you're doing is giving the market makers an egregious amount of money. And that's not to
2324.36s:  make you feel any type of way. This isn't to put you down. I hope it doesn't come off like that.
2327.72s:  This I'm hoping that this is educational. I want the lesson to stick because it's a really
2332.52s:  important lesson, especially for people that trade something like GameStop. This isn't the market
2337.64s:  makers to be clear. This isn't the market makers just trying to hurt GameStop traders. That's not
2343.64s:  it at all. In this context, GameStop is massively volatile. Anything that has massive volatility
2353.08s:  is immediately going to have wider bid aspect because it's more dangerous for a market maker literally
2358.12s:  to trade those things. And we see it right when they're getting caught off guard in a gamma squeeze
2363.56s:  that's painful for them. So that's the first thing is literally based on the bid aspect
2372.60s:  alone, you are overpaying in obscene amount. The next thing is if we take a look at theta,
2382.20s:  let's take a look at theta as again, we'll do theta to premium.
2394.36s:  The premium you said that you got was, let me find it again, 238. Let's take a look back at your
2418.20s:  option. Let's take a look at the theta on that. It's a three cents. So you're losing $3 per day
2427.88s:  in holding it. And $3 a day that doesn't, I mean, that doesn't sound like a lot, right? It's
2435.48s:  $3. That's not crazy. But again, everything here is relative. If we take this theta and we divide
2442.52s:  it by the premium and then we put this as a percentage, this means that every single day
2448.92s:  for the near future, you're losing one and a quarter percent of your original investment every day.
2455.80s:  It just goes away. One and a quarter percent gone. Here's why this matters to you so much. And again,
2461.72s:  this is another point that I really, really hope to drive home is if we analyze buying this option
2470.36s:  to simulate your position. And let me get rid of these. Don't need those. I want you to pay
2480.52s:  attention to something. If we got these for 238. And again, we can see that our theta right now
2490.12s:  is 281. So it rounds up to three. That's why it's .03, but 281 here. I want you to pay attention
2500.60s:  to this purple line relative to the blue line. The purple line represents today. The blue line
2508.04s:  represents at expiration. I want you to pay attention to what happens if price goes up,
2515.56s:  meaning this direction. With the purple line where it sits right now, if price goes up,
2523.08s:  you notice that you start enjoying that profit faster, almost immediate. It goes up as soon as
2532.04s:  the direction of the trade accommodates. But let's take a look what happens if we fast forward time.
2539.16s:  What I'm doing right now, two things. I want you to pay attention to two things as I click this
2543.88s:  button. What I'm doing is I'm fast forwarding time. I'm simulating time passing. I want you to pay
2550.04s:  attention to this red hash line. That red hash line represents the break even today for your option.
2558.84s:  Pay attention to the red hash line where it goes. The second thing I'm going to zoom it in more.
2563.56s:  The second thing I want you to pay attention to is the purple line relation to the blue line.
2570.92s:  Let's do this. Let's see what you see. I'm going to fast forward a week. We'll go
2576.20s:  five trading days. I'm going to go through the weekend. Today and tomorrow. Then I'm going to go
2581.16s:  five days from there. This is simulating past tomorrow. Now let's go five days. This is Monday,
2589.96s:  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. This puts you into the next trading week.
2595.64s:  What did you notice? What just happened there? Two things happened that are very, very important to
2602.36s:  you as the long option holder here. What did you see? I'm going to open door for.
2611.56s:  Mr. Spider, what did you see in that display? I'm doing this for you. So I want to make sure that you're following.
2632.20s:  Age says the break even is moving up surprisingly fast. So that's a super phone, a friend moment from
2638.84s:  age. That's correct. Spider, does that make sense? The reason why I'm
2649.00s:  spider says losing money is what I saw purple is getting closer to blue. That's correct. Good.
2653.16s:  That's good. The reason why I'm honing in on this so much is because it literally pains me to see
2660.52s:  so many new options traders trading something as nuanced as GameStop and just losing money.
2668.36s:  I really hate to see that because I know the people that are losing the money or the people that
2673.08s:  don't really have the money to lose. When I see influencers online that are joking around about
2678.52s:  trading options, I don't care at all because I know that they have tons of money and it doesn't
2682.68s:  matter. It's just a game. But I know a lot of the people that are trying to trade GameStop like this
2686.84s:  are actually trying to make some money to better their lives in some way. And it's just not happening.
2691.16s:  And it's not the market's fault. It's entirely our fault as the trader, but it's a knowledge issue.
2697.16s:  So just for the context on why I'm spending the time on this with you is because this is not
2701.56s:  unique to you. This is literally endemic to GameStop options traders across the board.
2708.52s:  So what I'm doing right now is I am grabbing a video for you that goes through all of this.
2723.08s:  I just got to find it.
2729.00s:  Here.
2731.72s:  So spider, this video is for you. But I want to recap what just happened and there's just a really
2738.92s:  important function of what happened right now. As soon as the stock is above 2334,
2746.36s:  your option is profitable. You would be making money. If I fast forward time like I did,
2752.28s:  before and we move this forward a week and change, you now need the stock to hit 2390
2760.12s:  in order to get just to break even. So the reasons why I don't like your option.
2767.64s:  First is because you're trading a weekly expiration, which is supremely liquid.
2775.64s:  The second thing and what I mean by that is if you just take a look at the primary
2779.16s:  expirations, take a look at the difference here. This is 40 cents wide. It's even further out in time
2786.36s:  than your 48s. So typically as you go further out in time, bit us spreads wide and more. But
2793.48s:  literally it's 40 cents wide. It's what half the gap of what you paid for these 48 DTE options.
2803.16s:  The second thing that I don't like is because you are within the 60 day window,
2809.40s:  these options are going to decay insanely fast. And I want to show you this. That's that red line
2817.16s:  moving to the right. But I want to show you quickly and then we'll move on how this will work.
2822.76s:  Right now, the theta that you're looking at is three cents. If we fast forward a week over the
2830.76s:  course of that week, your theta remains three cents. So no change, still the same three cents,
2836.20s:  but notice that your premium is less. So what that means is even though the theta is not accelerating,
2842.68s:  the theta as a ratio to the premium left in the option is absolutely accelerating massively.
2850.36s:  And again, we can use it as an example here. So the midpoint on these right now is 211.
2857.32s:  So let's just take a look at what happens if we go from 238 to 211. And again, remember,
2863.96s:  we're looking at the theta relationship relative. So right now your theta is essentially 1.26%
2871.16s:  of your premium. So now let's go to 211, which is what your options would be worth in a week.
2876.44s:  It's now 1.42. So we went from 1.26 to 1.42%. So again, what this means is it exacerbates that
2886.52s:  scenario I showed you earlier that the longer it doesn't give you the move you need, the bigger
2891.80s:  move you need. So it makes it very difficult to make money like that. So then let's go in just
2897.48s:  another couple weeks. So if you go into 17 April, well, shit, the option is now worth less.
2905.24s:  And theta just stepped up to now 0.04. So this problem becomes parabolic. That's what I want you to
2915.48s:  take away from this. So what that means is by buying an option literally during like the
2922.44s:  main section of the decay curve, this is just like a slide deck that I built to give references like
2928.20s:  this. It's like a random smattering of shit. But this, this is where you are in terms of the theta
2936.12s:  decay curve. Do you notice how when you're further out in time, the theta decay curve really is not
2941.72s:  that steep, pretty mellow. But if we plot the slope once you get within 60 days, I mean,
2949.56s:  really from 90 to 60 really starts to steep and up, but not crazy. But as you get in from 60,
2957.00s:  it literally goes parabolic. So all of this summarized, the reason I don't like that option is because
2964.52s:  the bit as spread is terrible. And because with the long options selected, these are going to decay away
2972.52s:  insanely fast. And unless you get the move that you need very quickly, you will not have much to
2979.80s:  show for it. Unfortunately. So yeah, that's why I hope that the information at least itself is
2986.12s:  useful on that like it makes sense. This is something that I just see, you know, GameStop
2991.56s:  option traders do a lot. And as you can tell, it really is like, it's like painful for me because
2997.24s:  I hate seeing people lose money like that. It just sucks because it's so preventable. It's so
3003.40s:  preventable. But it is just a, it's just a knowledge gap, unfortunately. So I hope that explains it.
3014.84s:  Spiders says, thanks. I will hold for a week and get out. Yeah. And the thing is, is the other
3019.40s:  thing you could consider is you could spread it off. If you wanted, that's okay. And that'll
3025.48s:  salvage the position where it is. But yeah, if this were me and that was my position, I would
3032.68s:  personally want to manage it quickly. But if I still have that same idea, make sure you watch
3040.60s:  that other video I sent, but what I would do is I would go further out in time, actually.
3046.12s:  I would go out to something like this, 125 days. And I would go deeper in the money,
3053.24s:  like a 68 delta. The options are more expensive here. But if you take a look at the theta for
3058.92s:  these options, it's two pennies. Even if they slide to add the money, it's two pennies. And again,
3066.28s:  remember the ratio here, this is two pennies again, something that's almost twice the price of what
3073.16s:  you have. So it means that the total impact to the trade is much, much less than what you will face.
3082.28s:  So yeah, a couple of ways to think about it. All right, let's take a look at another one of these
3087.48s:  DDPs. DTCC is finished. Okay.
3105.48s:  The naked trading scandal is much worse than you may have first believed. I think, well,
3109.32s:  I think we all believe that it's probably notably bad. The real shares in your account hold
3117.80s:  the same exact rights as any other, but behind the curtain DTCC has historically covered up
3122.52s:  the FTDs and mass naked shorting using CBE counterfeit electronic book entries. This is the DTCC
3130.92s:  ways of maintaining this reverse Ponzi scheme. This is why a non-standard dividend would ruin them.
3137.96s:  That's actually kind of interesting as they cook books for everyone that DTCC is in trouble.
3145.24s:  I actually kind of like that because this goes back to even the function that we see of
3157.96s:  the voting rights around proxy votes, right? Like the fact that there's so many extra votes happening
3169.80s:  that shouldn't exist. So I actually kind of like this idea.
3179.72s:  Let's see how's the cards extraordinate inside into the inner work as a DTCC.
3185.40s:  Okay. If you haven't read his letters, DTC, I have a, all right. Let's see.
3193.64s:  So they're going to use NSS for naked short selling, system-ac issue for years. This is correct.
3199.48s:  There were some changes that didn't impact anything that's correct.
3203.48s:  Naked short setting was meant to curb the fraud and protect investors.
3206.76s:  Argue that the pump and dumps would riot without the ability to sell shares that couldn't borrow.
3212.04s:  Like the leady shareholder advocates are generously offering their services in the fight against
3216.20s:  pump and dumps. They're offering to step up volunteer. They're generously volunteer to take the
3221.80s:  investors money in exchange for seed artificially raising the supply. This of course immediately
3226.92s:  does damage to the investment. Okay. Okay. So it says after naked shorting is done what now,
3235.32s:  the would be victim in the shareholder advocate now fundamentally of goals that are opposite.
3239.32s:  The buyer wants the stock to go to the moon. The naked short seller wants this business to go bankrupt.
3243.96s:  Thanks. The question, why would an entity volunteer to protect against fraud still take money
3248.36s:  of the investor? Okay. The maximum amount of shares that can legally be sold short is governed by
3256.52s:  the number of shares that can legally be borrowed. NSS ignores this mechanism. We know this.
3262.36s:  DTCC enables this further due to the fact that the share can be lent up multiple directions.
3267.00s:  We know this. This is the reason for FTDs and hundreds of percent. Yeah. That's exactly spot on.
3272.60s:  So how does this play in a game stop? Okay. So they're saying how do you know if you have shares effectively?
3283.16s:  The thing is one thing to note here is that there's a difference between like your shares and whether
3290.12s:  or not they're quote unquote real and then what might be happening on the back end with your shares.
3297.08s:  But depending on your view of ownership, one of the ways that you can do this is I mean,
3307.24s:  pretty much what a lot of people did with their shares, which is direct registration. If you
3313.16s:  lock them up, then they can't be moved around like that. But it doesn't really change the back end
3320.28s:  issue because effectively what we're saying up here is that they and this is true is like they don't
3325.72s:  need your shares necessarily, right? Because each share can be loaned out in multiples. So they
3333.08s:  literally don't even need yours technically. Okay. Imagine let's see if I hold on to shares,
3341.32s:  it's the same as one share. I have legal rights. Okay. Okay.
3348.12s:  Let's see. You thought you were buying shares from a real shareholder. You see in the number of
3360.04s:  shares, your brokerage account, why would you even think for a second that the shares aren't even
3363.48s:  there? Well, again, like this is another like misconception to be honest. The idea that like
3371.00s:  this is the same thing that if if you put a million dollars into the bank and if you go to the
3377.00s:  bank and you're like, can I go look at my million dollars? They're going to tell you no. They're
3381.80s:  going to tell you that the money's not there. They're going to tell you that if you want to withdraw
3385.96s:  a million dollars for the bank, you literally have to give them like a week's notice. It's crazy.
3391.80s:  So that's because the like your physical money isn't sitting in the bank. They're loaning it out.
3397.64s:  The money is out doing things. That's how the bank makes money. So it's the same thing when it comes
3402.76s:  to the shares. Like just as I go to the bank, I have rights to that money. It's still my money,
3408.84s:  but it doesn't mean that it's just sitting there parked in the bank. The bank is going to do stuff
3412.12s:  with it. That is what happens with your shares unless you opt out of it. So the fact that if you open
3418.44s:  up your account and you see shares, it doesn't inherently mean that like your shares are sitting
3423.56s:  there parked in the account for you. It just means that you have rights to those shares. And this
3429.72s:  is also why it's really important for people that invest to actually read the broker agreements.
3436.68s:  The broker tells you all this just like the bank tells you all this if you actually read
3440.52s:  the bank documents when you're putting your money into the bank. So it's the same thing here.
3445.16s:  So just the thing to note is that like in this case, you don't, it's not even expected that
3452.92s:  the shares are there. Like we don't expect again, the broker tells you that the shares
3459.56s:  aren't going to be sitting there unless again, you opt into that. So
3468.04s:  let's see. Seeds that the DTCC do not represent what you think of shares. They're packed. Okay,
3474.68s:  so literally just talked about that. Okay, so because the DTCC are complicit in ensuring that
3482.36s:  this fraud is covered up every time a shareholder tries to exercise the rights and attach to only
3487.24s:  real shares. These are not real shares. Do not have the rights. Okay, however, they have to maintain
3496.84s:  the illusion that they have these rights to not expose the fraud. I think this is conflating two
3505.24s:  different issues personally. I think that this is tying in the rights of share ownership
3513.88s:  and I think it's tying in naked shorting, which are two disparate issues to highlight. But let's
3522.76s:  continue. DTC won't turn around and say you can't sell. Yeah. So what happens if a non-standard
3528.92s:  dividend is issued, the DTCC can't cook the books and are forced to reconcile the float back down
3534.12s:  to its issued amount. Sure, it's have to close their positions. They need everyone to cancel out
3539.56s:  their fake borrow. What if no one sells? Okay. Because I, oh, that was it. My bad. I thought there was
3548.36s:  because I actually don't disagree with this. Well, I don't disagree with the concept here that if
3554.76s:  they forced a special dividend, it does force a reconciliation. Now, I don't know actually the
3562.52s:  back end well enough to intelligently speak and definitively say that they're forced to reconcile
3570.92s:  the float back down to its issued amount. That I don't know. And it's because it wouldn't surprise me
3579.00s:  if there's ways to circumnavigate that and simply just to get the special dividend to the actual
3583.32s:  shareholders. Because they know who the actual shareholders are. But yeah.
3592.12s:  Interesting. I actually like this one. I don't think that the DTCC is finished, but I do like what
3598.84s:  they're talking about and I get it. This is cool. I like just clicking on this one quick. I like
3604.68s:  this one because it's an Oberos. Yeah. There it is. So for those that don't know, I have a tattoo
3610.04s:  on the left arm of an Oberos, which is super cool. I'm glad that they have one in there. It's neat.
3616.84s:  All right, let's take a look at this one. Home Depot Hank.
3622.84s:  Six nine. Kind of a fun name. Let's see.
3633.56s:  Oh, geez. Okay. I mean, this one's okay. This one just has like a lot of fluff.
3643.56s:  All right. Let's see. Okay. Good. Enough choking around time to get serious. Perfect. That's
3649.16s:  where I'm at. There's been absolute slew of data about FDD's dark pools rule changes,
3653.88s:  which still so interesting to me is that we continue to demonize dark pools and don't actually
3659.72s:  fully understand them. I think I now understand how all this fits together and have thus made a
3667.56s:  GME theory of everything. Okay. Let's see.
3673.72s:  Essentially, FDD cycles the idea that because shorts have continually shorted GME,
3677.96s:  covered it with borrowed shares and used naked shorts, the short exposure is multiple
3682.04s:  hires than the actual shares of GMEs and existence. Yep. Because of this.
3687.80s:  And the SEC rules force them to cover every 35 days. They're a predictable price and volume
3692.84s:  hikes on the chart, which I think we've identified as not fully accurate, right? Is that
3700.92s:  the general consensus across the community? Because that's definitely been my observation.
3705.24s:  That's what we've talked about. But I don't know if that's like widely adopted across the
3710.28s:  community net community yet or not. So if you could fill me in there, that would be super helpful.
3717.56s:  As every FDD cycle passes, prices to cover get more and more expensive.
3724.20s:  And more and more shares are required to maintain their position, which makes it progressively
3728.36s:  more expensive and progressively increases their position. Why? Why? Can somebody explain that to me?
3738.68s:  I don't know why they're drawing that conclusion. I get up in the door.
3747.80s:  I don't know why we're saying this definitively that as every FDD cycle passes, the prices
3760.84s:  to cover get more expensive and that they have to get more shares.
3768.52s:  I'm sure that it's something in one of the prior posts, but I just don't see the mechanics of that.
3773.72s:  Yeah, I just, I think that that's a big leap that's being made because it doesn't like, there's
3782.44s:  no underlying forcing function from the market that would cause that to be the case.
3788.12s:  But anyways, let's continue. Because heavy naked shorted probably started in 2020.
3794.20s:  Each passing month or exposure increases drastically because naked short gives them double
3798.04s:  the obligation they must cover the short and the naked created share.
3803.32s:  This is why I believe that the current short position is multiples higher.
3808.68s:  Again, this is also making a like a really, really, really big leap.
3813.48s:  G.C. says one thought, I got you. He just laid down in his bed.
3817.08s:  But no.
3824.60s:  Now I did just trim up his face.
3829.00s:  So you can see his eyes now. Check out those eyeballs.
3833.32s:  He's a little on the grumpy side because it's pre-dinner right now. He would like his dinner.
3839.16s:  Is that correct? But Mel's not here and I'm in here. So he's having to to keep it real.
3846.76s:  But I mean, he's here. He's doing the thing. You see him? He sees his eyeballs.
3851.16s:  He's good. Check this out.
3853.96s:  Oh boy. Who knows how to do that? He also does face licking. That happens too.
3861.40s:  He's good little dude.
3866.20s:  We'll feed him in a hot minute. You got it G.C. I know what it's like.
3870.04s:  Anytime I remember when I was in college. I love dogs. So anytime I had a chance to see a dog,
3874.92s:  I was always stoked. So all right, let's continue. This why I believe the current position is
3880.76s:  multiple hires. I just think that's a giant assumption that's not really based on
3885.16s:  something we can prove. Similar to the January squeeze, eventually the pressure would be too much
3890.36s:  forced out. Yeah. I mean, I think we're honestly, I think we're based on a faulty premise, to be honest.
3904.60s:  This is another thing is like the the flow trading off exchange that doesn't suppress the buying
3910.76s:  pressure technically. And this is the other thing. See, like this is the thing that
3919.48s:  this is the thing that I think is interesting because we talk about we talk about the basics
3929.64s:  like here about like they're reading tons of posts about dark pools. But then we're citing the
3935.96s:  dark pools here as if it's even remotely close to the same as internalization. And relevant to
3944.76s:  suppressing of the buying power, like the reality is that again, like dark pool orders hit the
3950.28s:  consolidated tape within 15 seconds, typically a couple seconds after the transaction. So this isn't
3958.68s:  this isn't actually that. Okay. ETF shorting, we know this. All right, let's see how they're saying
3973.88s:  how it all fits together. FDD cycle, dark pool, OTC activity, ETF shorting, upcoming rules that
3981.08s:  benefit us. First dark pool, OTC data indicates what we already know hedge funds are in a giant
3989.64s:  fuckery hole in a bicep. They borrowed shares covered those borrowed shares borrowed share.
3996.12s:  I don't think it proves this. They've been repeating this forever, which is why the price of
4001.96s:  GME is still so high and volatile. I don't think that's it either. They do most of the covering
4007.80s:  in dark pools to suppress buying pressure. This is again incorrect. Transactions that occur in
4014.44s:  dark pools, they don't suppress buying pressure. It still hits the consolidated tape. And do
4019.56s:  other shady things in this dark pool. So it goes unnoticed. Yeah. More over GMEs,
4026.28s:  unbalanced volume is always perplex me. How could OBV still be this high post squeeze?
4031.88s:  The DD on dark pools explains that they are covering in dark pools to suppress buying pressure
4036.12s:  and OBV shows that. It won't show that. This means that apes did not sell post squeeze.
4043.56s:  And that the hedge funds did indeed use negative shorts to create artificial selling pressure.
4048.76s:  I do believe that that absolutely can be the case. I'm not convinced that it's hedge funds.
4054.52s:  I don't think we can definitively say hedge funds. But I do think I'm not saying it is or
4061.08s:  isn't. I'm just saying I don't think we can isolate them and say it is them.
4066.12s:  OTC data also explains the low volume. The funds are covering. Again, this is not correct.
4075.00s:  So volume being low is nothing to do with the transactions going on in dark pools.
4078.76s:  Again, it hits the consolidated tape. I'm not trying to like keep saying that point,
4082.92s:  but like I'm just literally going through this piece by piece and reiterating where it applies.
4087.56s:  This also explains the random one PM jumps in buy volume that I noticed in a previous post.
4092.84s:  It doesn't explain that. So one of the things that you'll notice in buy volume at specific
4097.40s:  times throughout the day, it's typically the first hour of the day and the last hour of the day.
4102.04s:  You'll almost always see that trend. And that's where broad market liquidity occurs. This happens
4107.96s:  in every ticker. So if we take a look at a five day 15 minute chart, that's actually we need a
4117.32s:  little more compressed time. Let's take a look at a I'm going to zoom this out to be like a five
4122.76s:  day though so that we can see more iterations of it. This will be a five day five minute.
4127.40s:  What I want you to notice is take a look at the volume, typically at the start of each day
4133.80s:  and then at the end of each day. There will be spikes throughout the day as different entities to
4138.76s:  choose to transact at those times for different reasons, but at the beginning of each day and at
4143.56s:  the end of each day, you're going to see the same spike. This is not unique to GameStop.
4149.72s:  The last comparison we use was Apple. If we look at Apple spike in the beginning of the day,
4154.36s:  I get the end of the day. If we take a look at spy, the S&P 500 index ETF, I can be getting
4161.24s:  in the day. I get the end of the day. This is always the case. This is for two broad reasons. I
4167.00s:  actually have a video that goes over the details of market liquidity and why you see this trend.
4176.04s:  I'll show you that video here, but it has everything to do with when different
4185.08s:  periods open up in the market that other activities are going on. That's exactly why,
4192.36s:  beginning of the day, end of the day, it is trains never late. It's always there.
4197.64s:  So anyways, back to this. This, the random jumps at 1 p.m. That's way more likely to be an
4205.72s:  individual entity that's processing their orders at that point for some reason. That can be for
4211.00s:  a lot of different reasons. That's why you notice in all those others tickers that we looked at,
4215.24s:  their absolutely your periods where it just shoots up. And it's typically one volume bar,
4220.04s:  whether it's five minutes, 15 minutes, it's typically tied to a small number of traits because
4224.68s:  it's so easy to be excessive volume in those more quiet periods as compared to the total volume
4232.60s:  of the busier periods or the total volume of the day. Okay, furthermore, dark pool,
4239.08s:  OTC data provides almost irrefutable evidence that there's still fuckery of foot with GameStop.
4243.80s:  Again, I have no idea how dark pool does that. The shorts have indeed dug themselves into a hole
4248.92s:  that they cannot get out. I do not see how it proves that. The exposure that the short
4253.96s:  funds have is astronomical. Again, I, and I'm not saying this to just say like I don't agree with
4259.48s:  it. I like I genuinely don't see how OTC data or dark pool data are proving any of these
4267.08s:  definitively. Unless for some odd reason, all apes sell the moas will in fact happen and it will
4273.56s:  happen big. I don't agree with that either. Like I don't think that these things lead to that
4283.08s:  scenario. And the other thing I will continue to remind the apes of, I think that apes need to hear
4288.76s:  this for their own good is that if broad market entities interfered with the prior squeeze that
4299.16s:  we had by turning off the buy button, why would in any world going forward, they not intervene again
4312.52s:  and just allow it to go further. Right? Like it doesn't make sense. So one of the the massive
4322.36s:  inconsistencies I see with these kind of DDs is we say things like there's massive fuckery going on
4331.96s:  and that the game is rigged that everybody's in cooots with one another that everything is fake
4337.72s:  artificially suppressed. But then we think that there's going to be this uncontrolled squeeze that's
4344.76s:  just going to go. Right? Like it just logically doesn't make sense. So the argument I'm posing here
4354.52s:  is that because there are clear there is clear evidence that manipulation occurs in different
4364.20s:  ways. FTD is one of the main one of the main vectors that occurs in and we can see it. It is there.
4370.12s:  It is bullshit. There's no way that you should be able to have more than 100% of the float short.
4377.64s:  Right? It just doesn't fucking make sense. So absolutely. Then we can also see the incestuous
4385.16s:  relationship with a place like Citadel that somehow has a hedge fund arm that's making directional
4393.08s:  bets and ideas and also has a market making arm as if there's not going to be a crossover between
4400.44s:  those. That's utter bullshit. It's the same thing with fucking Congress trading as if the decisions
4408.04s:  Congress is making when they're placing their individual stock trades is not somehow based
4414.68s:  on information that they have access to. Right? Like it's just insane to even suggest that.
4421.40s:  So those things aside, I think that if there is that scale of manipulation,
4429.72s:  it doesn't really then reconcile why we think that this kind of massive painful move for those very
4438.28s:  same entities would occur. It's kind of, I mean to me it's just counterintuitive. That's all I just
4447.40s:  haven't seen a good explanation for how that how that relationship
4454.84s:  makes sense or how it would play out. I just broke my pen so I'm trying to
4460.68s:  it's the worst. Keep myself for that.
4463.40s:  What is that? What the fuck?
4475.88s:  Guys, I just I just fucked up bad.
4482.60s:  This is the thing has to be here.
4484.92s:  Okay. I think I got the nope. We'll figure that out later. That's a fun game.
4500.68s:  All right, let's continue.
4504.52s:  Edge funds are indeed in a deep hole, not covered, trading in high volumes and dark pools.
4510.36s:  Yeah, and I don't really agree with that.
4514.28s:  GMEs insanely hard to borrow and there's very little demand for it. I do agree that it was very
4518.68s:  hard to borrow. That was actually one of the most interesting elements of GameStop
4522.76s:  that unfortunately has changed a little bit with the recent at the markets. But I do fully agree
4530.36s:  that GameStop being in a place where
4539.96s:  I mean, I don't know. I think if it is, GameStop was super well positioned while it was hard to
4545.56s:  borrow to cause this broader context, like this broader confluence of things to occur. So that
4552.84s:  I actually fully agree with. I think that that's completely accurate. So yeah, on the same point
4559.24s:  there, figured out how to fix my pen, by the way. That's called OCD where you can't stop thinking
4565.16s:  about something until it's done, but it's done. OTC data adds credence to the idea that FDD
4574.68s:  cycle is getting more and more expensive. Okay, so let's see if it expands on that.
4580.04s:  Why isn't some whale coming in to take advantage, benefit at the squeeze, there would be new rules,
4584.60s:  D.D. coming to play because Wall Street has access to better, more accurate data.
4589.88s:  Why else would the DTC see put all these rules liquidation bankruptcy and oversight after the GME
4594.44s:  squeeze? I don't that unfortunately didn't expand on that in the way that I hope it would,
4601.16s:  because I still don't understand that point. I don't see the evidence behind it.
4607.40s:  Inclusion four, whales have purposely side-lined themselves and are waiting for the proposed
4611.24s:  regulatory rules to take effect so the squeeze doesn't destroy the financial system.
4615.48s:  The courts are using dark pools to suppress buying pressure to drop the price by rapidly
4619.80s:  trading between each other that doesn't make sense. The squeeze will happen once the availability
4633.96s:  of shares to borrow is completely dried up, which seems to be rapidly approaching, which obviously we know.
4641.08s:  With the benefit of hindsight, it wasn't wrapped.
4643.16s:  FDD cycle is persistent and exemplifies the naked shorting problem. I do agree that it identifies
4651.56s:  elements of the naked shorting problem. I don't think that it exemplifies the details of it,
4656.52s:  because I actually think that FDD cycle is just one measure that helps us look into it, but I don't
4663.24s:  think there's more to it.
4673.88s:  This is always bad practice. This is saying each of these days is between T33 and T35.
4680.84s:  What we're doing is very standard statistical flaw in analysis, and this is called overfitting.
4687.96s:  We're essentially looking at a period of interest historically, and then we're trying to figure out
4692.76s:  how the data fits. I've ran broad data analysis on GameStop, both pre and post at the market
4702.60s:  offerings to see literally every variation of time-based cycles that I could find.
4710.92s:  Literally, that's everything from T plus 0, T plus 1, T plus 2 all the way out. Then it was also
4716.44s:  with calendar variations to see what the correlation is between these various durations and subsequent
4723.40s:  stock price movement. It's generally broadly not correlated. That's just from a higher level.
4733.48s:  It would be true. I want to emphasize not my opinion. I love many possible catalysts.
4745.48s:  Yeah, okay. It's talking about potential reasons, which I think are all fair. We can
4749.72s:  postulate different catalysts, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
4756.04s:  FDD cycle slowly chewing away at shorts. Obviously, we've not seen that.
4760.36s:  And again, the dark pull data does not confirm that.
4771.32s:  If you have FDD read this, I do want to read this, because I do not, again, the thing that I
4777.40s:  want to continually remind everybody of, my goal is not anything related to hype things up or
4786.04s:  break things down and to diminish the potential impacts. My entire lens, generally of the world,
4794.28s:  but particularly markets, is the best attempt I can possibly conjure up at objective analysis.
4802.84s:  That is literally my goal standard. It's because it's how I trade. It's the only way to make money
4808.60s:  in markets. If I approach markets, what's the lens of what I want to see? That's a really great
4814.76s:  way to lose money, because the market doesn't give the slightest fuck about what I want to see.
4820.84s:  The market is going to do whatever the market's going to do. So anyways,
4825.80s:  they know more than us. There's no way there's no way they'll let this happen again. It's been
4829.40s:  trading sideways. Yep. What's happening to GME is not normal. 100% cracked. At the highest level,
4839.72s:  that is one of the easiest takeaways to always circle back to in that the performance of GameStop
4846.92s:  is not normal. That is completely correct. This is completely correct. I completely,
4853.72s:  completely, completely agree with this. This is one of the best points they've made in this.
4862.68s:  Interesting. Yeah. I mean, I liked the overall intent behind the piece and I
4869.72s:  liked the way that they were trying to think things up. Again, I think that there's a lot of
4873.48s:  misunderstandings at a fundamental level, but I mean, I still enjoyed it. I thought that it was
4879.48s:  at least like again, I always appreciate an honest, sincere attempt at rigorous analysis,
4885.96s:  and I can appreciate it as that. So I enjoyed looking at that one. So interesting. Yeah.
4891.80s:  Pretty cool stuff. I think that wraps me up for today. As always, if you guys need anything,
4897.16s:  let me know. I'm going to go feed Thor and I'll see you all around on the next stream on the next
4903.00s:  time where we're hanging out in the discord, whatever it is. But if you need anything in the
4906.12s:  meantime, you can always reach out via an outlier, be an ape. See you later.
