990.00s: you
1021.00s: you
1022.00s: you
1050.00s: Then if you take a look at the 28 March, you can see 123% vol.
1055.56s: That's actually heavy vol on a comparative basis.
1059.60s: Now this is absolutely something I'm going to trade this week on the coverage strangle
1065.08s: that I have in GameStop.
1066.32s: I'm going to adjust it to trade the earnings vol because it's so heavy.
1071.32s: And with the coverage strangle, I'm effectively trading short call, short put, which is a standard
1076.96s: earnings play, but in the scenario of the coverage strangle, I really don't care which
1081.04s: way it goes.
1082.04s: I don't have to worry about taking it down and just realizing the volatility side of the
1086.48s: trade.
1087.48s: There's another element of the position.
1088.32s: So I'm definitely going to trade this vault because it's very high.
1092.16s: Now if we take a look at the total positioning, I don't believe that this is correct.
1098.60s: 2000 against 3000.
1100.44s: I don't think that's right.
1101.96s: There we go.
1102.96s: That's more correct.
1103.96s: 571 against 175.
1106.64s: Now let's take a look in the 28 March 41 against 10.
1110.28s: So that's roughly roughly four to one, not quite.
1115.76s: 21 March is 110 against 30.
1118.80s: So still very heavy in the front expiration, very heavy in the front expiration.
1124.76s: And I don't see any sort of anomalous heavy call versus put volume or open interest,
1131.68s: leaning into earnings compared to everything else.
1133.84s: It looks like it's generally just kind of spread across the board here.
1137.88s: So that informs me that it doesn't look like there's a bunch of people positioning right
1142.36s: now, heavily into the earnings move.
1145.36s: That's all.
1146.36s: Sometimes you can pick up small cues like that, leading into earnings if something has
1151.60s: anomalous put call skew or in terms of open interest or big heavy volume leading into
1158.52s: earnings, which typically would start about last week through this week.
1162.76s: If people are going to be positioning heavy, you know, with some sort of expectation of
1166.60s: a move, but that's not happening right now.
1169.48s: So just kind of a standard earnings release.
1171.64s: We'll see how it goes.
1173.24s: So all that stuff aside, do you guys have any questions on GameStop specifically just the
1179.84s: overarching landscape that were in anything like that?
1183.48s: And then if not, I'm going to pivot us over into the DD library.
1188.40s: So I'll give you guys a second if you have anything that you want to take a look at.
1193.60s: I haven't gotten any emails about GameStop in a while.
1197.24s: So my sense of things is that the longer term GameStop holders are kind of hunkering
1205.08s: down here and just continuing to hold.
1209.44s: And I think a lot of the more transient people that kind of, you know, get super interested
1215.76s: when things are super active.
1217.72s: I get the sense that a lot of that is starting to fall off and strip away.
1222.48s: The other thing I've been noticing is I used to get a lot of emails with different expectations
1229.76s: and different theories around GameStop and, you know, the cycles and all that stuff.
1235.08s: And I've all about stopped getting those kinds of emails, which again leads me to believe
1240.12s: that a lot of people are starting to see that the theories aren't necessarily playing
1243.96s: out.
1245.16s: So yeah, just to give you broader context on what I'm seeing from my perspective.
1252.68s: Cool.
1253.68s: Let's get into the D2 library.
1256.92s: We're out where we left off.
1258.12s: I know that we did lower.
1261.08s: I think we might have done this one, the iceberg order.
1263.84s: Yeah, we did this one for sure.
1265.76s: So I think we have this one next, which is the Moas preparation guide by Socrates.
1272.96s: That's actually really great.
1274.28s: H says on the coverage triangle adjustments, are you taking everything down and shuffling
1279.04s: to the closest DTE post earnings?
1281.92s: And what are you basing your delta zone?
1283.32s: Great question.
1284.52s: So what I'm going to do is evaluate what I have out, which I actually don't know.
1291.08s: I'll tell you right now.
1294.12s: Right now I'm dominantly out in 17 April.
1298.16s: So I have some short puts out there that I almost expect to be able to roll them in
1306.72s: time, meaning come in and time.
1309.68s: So if we take a look at 28 March, I have the 23s and the 21s.
1314.88s: The 23s are at the money.
1319.32s: And let's see what those are trading for right now.
1321.96s: So they're trading for two 15 ice sold them for two.
1327.40s: So those are losing 15 cents.
1331.16s: So what I might do is just take them down for a 15 cent loss.
1335.88s: Take it on the chin, eat it, and then take it into the 28 March and actually reestablish
1344.04s: somewhere in here, probably like the 22s.
1347.08s: But what I would do is size them up a little bit.
1350.08s: So I would move from a five lot to a six lot, I think.
1354.08s: And then I also have the 21s that are here in 17 April.
1357.92s: The 21s are currently trading for a small discount than what I got them for.
1364.12s: I sold them for 153.
1365.68s: They're trading, call it like 112.
1368.36s: So for that one, I'll probably just take those down.
1373.36s: I'll take those down for a tiny profit and then I'll scoot them in as well.
1378.84s: So I'll use that two lot to size up the 23s that I'm going to take down for, again,
1386.16s: like a probably a $15 loss.
1390.08s: Then I'll fully establish the short puts in this expiration cycle.
1394.80s: And then on the call side of things, I literally just adjusted those.
1398.80s: But I have the 17 April the 28s.
1404.60s: And those were out for a dollar.
1407.00s: So those are already in profit.
1408.92s: So I'll take those in as well.
1410.92s: Oh, wrong one.
1411.68s: I was going to say that seemed way too fast.
1414.20s: The 28s.
1417.48s: Yeah, so those are trading about break.
1419.92s: So what I would do for these is probably after the weekend, a little bit will come out of these.
1425.28s: And hopefully with the vol siphoning into the front expiration, a little more vol will come out.
1431.60s: So I'd be able to take these down close to a scratch.
1435.04s: And then I will move those in as well.
1438.28s: So those will come into 28 March.
1440.84s: And then I'll probably re-center those on.
1445.20s: Guessing like the 26s, the danger with the 26s is my basis right now is 28.
1453.04s: So I wouldn't want to get too deep on the basis, especially around earnings,
1458.04s: because things can move pretty heavily.
1459.80s: But I would feel comfortable with the 26s.
1462.56s: I think that that's completely fine.
1465.44s: Unburdened croissants says was dexter into coverage triangles.
1469.80s: It's funny that you mentioned dexter, because I never really watched the show.
1477.00s: I think I watched maybe like one episode, because the idea sounded kind of entertaining.
1482.36s: And I just remember the scene where he essentially made a kill room, right?
1489.64s: Like you put up all the plastic and stuff to do his thing.
1493.20s: And what sticks out to me, unburdened croissant, is I was literally just talking with my mother-in-law.
1502.36s: She's an artist.
1503.36s: She makes different paintings.
1505.40s: I don't really care that much about art, to be honest.
1508.20s: But like because it's from my mother-in-law, I just love it.
1511.32s: I love her skill.
1513.08s: Like this, she did this.
1515.00s: That's actually of my actual car.
1517.12s: You kind of can't see the whole thing.
1518.40s: But like she painted that.
1521.12s: So everyone's in a while.
1523.20s: I'll hit her up and see if I can convince her to do something new.
1526.24s: Long story short, she just got new carpet in.
1529.08s: And I used that same reference effectively.
1533.32s: I was just like, oh, we're going to have to set you up with like a dexter room.
1537.28s: So I think it's kind of wild that there's been two dexter references within like three days
1542.88s: for a show that's old as fuck.
1545.92s: And I don't think anybody watches.
1547.84s: So that made me chuckle.
1551.96s: And to take a guess at that, I have to think so.
1557.56s: Because I think he did like the plastic bag, which is exactly what that is.
1561.52s: So yeah, I think you're right.
1565.92s: I think you're dead on the money.
1568.52s: Dead on the money.
1571.32s: H, does that answer your question though with respect to what I'm based on the Delta?
1575.76s: Because the Delta is always just based on the kind of risk that I want the position to have.
1581.04s: With bringing them in so far, these options are going to have a ridiculous amount of gamma
1585.76s: comparatively.
1587.00s: So that means that the Delta is going to change super, super fast.
1590.72s: And that's just kind of what is expected for something that moves as heavy as GameStop.
1599.20s: But that's also why like I wouldn't trade naked earnings with something like GameStop.
1605.04s: And then the normal earnings place to play the volatility contraction is like selling
1608.64s: a straddle, selling a strangle.
1611.40s: But a big way that you manage risks in those kind of positions is through the sizing of
1615.96s: the trade.
1616.96s: But unfortunately the sizing itself wouldn't be enough in this kind of trade for me at
1623.92s: least.
1624.92s: So what I do here is I would either spread off the risk.
1631.72s: Or I would force a absolutely the smallest position I could think of.
1638.56s: And the reason for that is because through earnings you can have things that really start
1643.56s: to bounce around and move a lot.
1646.32s: So you can have a really dangerous position kind of like holding a little bit of a hand grenade
1651.44s: through through an earnings release.
1653.08s: So there's ways to do it responsibly in something like this.
1655.20s: If I wanted to trade earnings outright, I would cap the risk.
1658.76s: I would buy the wings somewhere.
1661.92s: Because the covered strangle it already is a covered position.
1665.84s: So it doesn't matter to me.
1667.92s: Cool.
1669.92s: Let's now take a look at I actually think we might have read this one.
1678.92s: Okay, yes.
1679.52s: So we read the old one.
1680.72s: I remember seeing this one.
1682.72s: So they're talking about the Moas preparation guide, which it's good to be prepared.
1690.68s: We're talking about what they're going to do having.
1694.44s: Yes.
1695.44s: So this is all stuff that we've seen.
1697.68s: Yeah.
1700.68s: I mean, unless there's anything in particular as I flip through this, that's interesting
1709.68s: to you guys that you want to look at.
1711.16s: There's really nothing to.
1714.92s: There's really nothing to highlight.
1716.72s: Do you feel bad that?
1728.72s: I don't think they had I don't think they got their movie yet.
1739.72s: Okay.
1740.72s: I remember seeing a little bit about this one a little while ago when we read the original
1746.40s: one and it's fine.
1747.40s: The thing that I appreciated about it is that it was talking about planning and anybody
1752.24s: that knows me and what I do as a trader, like I actually really respect the planning side
1757.60s: of things.
1758.60s: But I mean, a lot of it's just kind of.
1762.00s: I don't know.
1763.00s: It's hard for me to put a word on it.
1764.64s: So yeah.
1765.64s: Hey, yo, why not?
1767.64s: What up?
1768.64s: Age says that does.
1771.96s: I'm starting to get my port adjusted to have more short theta against it.
1777.56s: And I've enjoyed learning about the thought presses via videos and these streams.
1780.68s: That's awesome.
1781.68s: Yeah.
1782.68s: That's literally one of my primary objectives for showing you all the coverage strangle
1787.04s: and literally using my own money and a small allocation for it because for those that
1792.44s: don't know what I did is I pulled the community and I said like, what's an average size for
1798.24s: game stop holdings for people?
1800.56s: And that's how we arrived at using $25,000.
1803.36s: So I just took 25k and then I put it into a coverage triangle allocation to trade game
1808.64s: stop and to use it as an opportunity to show people like different ways to use that kind
1814.88s: of strategy, which I really do think are highly relevant to you.
1820.04s: And the reason why I think it's so relevant is I think we have it in here.
1826.44s: Are these the latest?
1827.44s: 90?
1828.44s: Yeah.
1829.44s: This is the latest.
1830.44s: So the reason why I think it's relevant is because if we take a look at the move in
1835.88s: game stop from when I started this exercise, right?
1840.44s: I tracked the price from when I started the exercise, which was 2431.
1845.68s: And the current price, this is saying is 23 or five.
1849.52s: So let's correct.
1851.52s: And so that represents a 5% decline, a 5.2% change.
1855.96s: If you take a look at the portfolio as it sits, I am literally sitting on an unrealized
1864.06s: loss right now.
1866.60s: And even though the stock itself is losing $1,300, this is in the open trade that sits,
1874.94s: that 1,300 bucks is still being overwhelmed by the rest of the money that's being made
1882.98s: from here, here, here, and here.
1886.90s: There's 2540 right now in total option premium that's either realized or open, tied to
1895.74s: the broader trade.
1897.66s: So the reason why this matters is because even though the trade itself is slowly working,
1910.70s: it's not doing exactly what we wanted to do just yet, but that's kind of how she goes.
1916.82s: With that as the case, the position itself is still profitable for me.
1922.86s: Based on the capital that I have in the trade, it's actually a 7.5%, it's up 7.5%.
1928.46s: While the broader market is down for the underlying, I'm trading a 5.2%.
1933.90s: That's the whole point of the coverage triangle.
1936.94s: The coverage triangle isn't going to look super sexy when the market's going straight
1940.18s: up.
1941.18s: That's when you have to increase your shares.
1943.42s: But with the market doing what it is now, that's why I've pivoted so hard where the stock
1948.30s: requirement is so very light and the cash secured put requirement is much heavier.
1953.74s: It allows me to do this.
1955.46s: And again, this is nothing, nothing crazy.
1958.42s: It's nothing to write home about.
1959.98s: I'm not like sitting here saying like, wow, this is the coolest stuff on earth.
1963.58s: This is what I implore people to remember.
1967.50s: This is a sustainable way to use options to amplify in equity position.
1976.30s: And again, I know that like the sustainable path isn't necessarily the sexiest path,
1982.46s: but it's it's working, right?
1986.38s: And it's something to think about because right now, in terms of a realized PNL of 1478,
1993.46s: from when I started, I can now buy $1,500 more of GameStop than when I first started.
2003.22s: And the person that just bought and held equity right now, their overall value is down 5%.
2009.90s: So that's the big difference here.
2011.46s: And that's why I think that this is something I hope that you find useful.
2016.02s: I don't know if you guys can hear that.
2018.06s: There's a helicopter flying over my house.
2019.78s: Let's see if I can figure it out.
2028.34s: Teach 53.
2032.22s: All right, spider says I picked up some call options yesterday.
2036.34s: GameStop may second second.
2039.46s: Hold on, GameStop may second 24.
2042.94s: Execution price 238.
2045.02s: What do you think?
2045.94s: I assume spider that you bought them.
2053.54s: Is that a correct assumption?
2057.66s: And if anybody else has a position that you want to look at in GameStop, now's a perfect
2061.66s: time to happy to do it.
2063.50s: Like we can go back and forth between the DD and what you all have going on.
2067.78s: Let's see, you're out in 2 May.
2073.26s: Drag price is 24.
2077.46s: I mean, I don't like it.
2079.10s: I don't like to trade at all personally.
2083.10s: Yeah, I think that I think that that's a really tough trade.
2094.54s: Spider says why I curious.
2099.42s: Yeah, happy to expand.
2102.02s: I don't like just saying, like don't like it and leave it at that.
2105.30s: But I also don't like overvalent hearing my opinion if people don't want it.
2109.38s: So yeah, happy to explain a bunch of things.
2113.58s: The first thing, I don't like using the weekly explorations because take a look at the
2118.86s: bid-ass spread.
2119.86s: It's almost a dollar wide.
2122.66s: It's absolutely atrocious in terms of the liquidity that you're getting here.
2128.82s: So let's take a look.
2130.14s: This is a really great exercise.
2131.86s: What the hell is all this stuff?
2134.86s: Get to that later.
2137.14s: This one we can, this can all move.
2143.22s: Over there.
2144.22s: So I want to show you something.
2147.10s: So if we take a look at your position, which is, let's take a look at today.
2156.86s: And then you're in two May.
2160.62s: You're looking at the 24 strike.
2163.54s: The bid right now is 1.8.
2165.30s: The offer is 2.62.
2170.98s: So let's just get some context here on what this is.
2179.66s: So this is your strike price.
2181.82s: This is the bid.
2183.70s: This is the offer.
2189.74s: If we take a look at the bid-ass spread, it's 82 cents.
2203.26s: If we take that 82 cents and normalize it into a ratio, the back ratio.
2219.18s: This is not really a term I just make it up.
2223.06s: All I'm doing is I'm saying, okay, based on the strike price, how wide is this bid-ass
2231.50s: spread?
2232.70s: So there's, I mean, it doesn't really matter which way you choose to do the ratio.
2236.54s: I normally do the spread itself as a percentage.
2240.18s: So the spread itself represents a 3.42.
2244.30s: It's 3.42 of the strike that you're trying to trade.
2249.62s: And that doesn't mean anything to you and I don't expect it will.
2253.46s: But let's take a look at something else for a comparison, just for a benchmark.
2257.94s: Let's take a look at Apple.
2260.26s: We'll use the same expiration to start and we'll use the same at the monies.
2268.94s: So for this Apple trade using the same expiration, the strike here that we're looking at is the
2275.02s: 2.15.
2276.02s: So 2.15, these are offered at 9.30.
2279.54s: I'm sorry, bid at 9.30 offered at 9.80.
2283.46s: And then these we can just drag them down.
2285.50s: Let's take a look at them by comparison.
2287.50s: What do you notice?
2289.10s: What jumps out at you right from the get go?
2294.86s: What's the difference here?
2299.74s: Absolutely massive liquidity difference.
2304.62s: Literally a tremendous liquidity difference.
2308.62s: So when traders like you unknowingly go into these kinds of options, literally like genuinely,
2317.90s: the only thing you're doing is giving the market makers an egregious amount of money.
2323.50s: And that's not to make you feel any type of way.
2325.58s: This isn't to put you down.
2326.58s: I hope it doesn't come off like that.
2328.14s: I'm hoping that this is educational.
2330.34s: I want the lesson to stick because it's a really important lesson, especially for people
2335.30s: that trade something like GameStop.
2336.94s: This isn't the market makers to be clear.
2339.10s: This isn't the market makers just trying to hurt GameStop traders.
2343.38s: That's not it at all.
2345.26s: In this context, GameStop is massively volatile.
2350.18s: Anything that has massive volatility is immediately going to have wider bid aspect.
2355.30s: Because it's more dangerous for a market maker literally to trade those things.
2359.70s: And we see it right when they're getting caught off guard in a gamma squeeze, that's painful
2364.30s: for them.
2367.46s: So that's the first thing is literally based on the bid aspect of loan, you are overpaying
2376.66s: an obscene amount.
2378.90s: The next thing is if we take a look at theta, let's take a look at theta as again, we'll
2390.06s: do theta to premium.
2394.70s: So the premium you said that you got was, let me find it again, 238.
2416.34s: Let's take a look back at your option, GME.
2421.10s: And let's take a look at the theta on that.
2423.10s: It's a three cents.
2425.14s: So you're losing $3 per day in holding it.
2429.78s: And $3 a day that doesn't, I mean, that doesn't sound like a lot, right?
2435.34s: It's $3.
2436.34s: That's not crazy.
2437.66s: But again, everything here is relative.
2440.58s: If we take this theta and we divide it by the premium and then we put this as a percentage,
2445.98s: this means that every single day for the near future, you're losing 1.25% of your original
2454.26s: investment every day.
2456.02s: It just goes away.
2457.02s: 1.25% gone.
2459.62s: Here's why this matters to you so much.
2461.50s: And again, this is another point that I really, really hope to drive home is if we analyze
2468.18s: buying this option, to simulate your position.
2474.66s: And let me get rid of these.
2476.70s: Don't need those.
2478.90s: I want you to pay attention to something.
2482.54s: If we got these for 238.
2487.14s: And again, we can see that our theta right now is 281.
2494.14s: So it rounds up to three.
2495.94s: That's why it's .03, but 281 here.
2499.26s: I want you to pay attention to this purple line relative to the blue line.
2504.46s: The purple line represents today.
2507.46s: The blue line represents at expiration.
2510.30s: I want you to pay attention to what happens if price goes up, meaning this direction.
2517.78s: With the purple line where it sits right now, if price goes up, you notice that you start
2524.62s: enjoying that profit faster, almost immediate.
2529.98s: It goes up as soon as the direction of the trade accommodates.
2534.70s: But let's take a look what happens if we fast forward time.
2539.42s: What I'm doing right now, two things.
2541.62s: I want you to pay attention to two things as I click this button.
2544.94s: What I'm doing is I'm fast forwarding time.
2546.82s: I'm simulating time passing.
2549.38s: I want you to pay attention to this red hash line.
2554.06s: That red hash line represents the break even today for your option.
2559.10s: Pay attention to the red hash line where it goes.
2561.86s: The second thing, I'm going to zoom it in more.
2563.78s: The second thing I want you to pay attention to is the purple line relation to the blue
2570.46s: line.
2571.46s: Let's do this.
2572.46s: Let's see what you see.
2573.46s: I'm going to fast forward a week.
2575.38s: We'll go five trading days.
2577.86s: So I'm going to go through the weekend.
2579.26s: So today and tomorrow, and then I'm going to go five days from there.
2582.26s: So this is simulating past tomorrow.
2584.82s: Now let's go five days.
2586.34s: So 16.
2587.34s: So this is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
2594.26s: This puts you into the next trading week.
2595.86s: What did you notice?
2596.86s: What just happened there?
2599.02s: Two things happened that are very, very important to you as the long option holder here.
2606.30s: What did you see?
2609.30s: I'm going to open door for you.
2624.50s: Mr. Spyder, what did you see in that display?
2627.66s: I'm doing this for you.
2629.46s: So I want to make sure that you're following.
2632.30s: H says the break even is moving up surprisingly fast.
2635.22s: So that's a super phone, a friend moment from H.
2640.54s: That's correct.
2643.54s: Spyder, does that make sense?
2646.46s: The reason why I'm, Spyder says losing money is what I saw.
2651.10s: Purple is getting closer to blue.
2652.38s: That's correct.
2653.38s: Good.
2654.38s: That's good.
2655.38s: The reason why I'm honing in on this so much is because it literally pains me to see
2660.38s: so many new options traders trading something as nuanced as GameStop and just losing money.
2668.46s: I really hate to see that because I know the people that are losing the money or the
2672.66s: people that don't really have the money to lose.
2675.62s: When I see influencers online that are joking around about trading options, I don't care
2680.58s: at all because I know that they have tons of money and it doesn't matter.
2683.06s: It's just a game.
2684.06s: But I know a lot of the people that are trying to trade GameStop like this are actually
2687.42s: trying to make some money to better their lives in some way and it's just not happening
2691.22s: and it's not the market's fault.
2693.30s: It's entirely our fault as the trader but it's a knowledge issue.
2697.38s: So just for the context on why I'm spending the time on this with you is because this
2701.26s: is not unique to you.
2703.18s: This is literally endemic to GameStop options traders across the board.
2708.74s: So what I'm doing right now is I am grabbing a video for you that goes through all of this.
2722.66s: I just got to find it here.
2732.02s: So spider, this video is for you but I want to recap what just happened and there's just
2738.50s: a really important function of what happened right now.
2742.46s: As soon as the stock is above 2334, your option is profitable.
2748.50s: You would be making money.
2750.22s: If I fast forward time like I did before and we move this forward a week and change,
2756.38s: you now need the stock to hit 2390 in order to get just to break even.
2763.82s: So the reasons why I don't like your option.
2768.18s: First is because you're trading a weekly expiration, which is supremely illiquid.
2775.86s: The second thing and what I mean by that is if you just take a look at the primary
2779.18s: expirations, take a look at the difference here.
2781.78s: This is 40 cents wide.
2784.86s: It's even further out in time than your 48s.
2788.38s: So typically as you go further out in time, bid us spreads wide and more but literally
2794.14s: it's 40 cents wide.
2796.18s: It's what half the gap of what you paid for these 48 DTE options.
2803.38s: The second thing that I don't like is because you are within the 60 day window, these options
2810.46s: are going to decay insanely fast.
2814.70s: And I want to show you this.
2816.10s: That's that red line moving to the right.
2818.34s: But I want to show you quickly and then we'll move on how this will work.
2823.06s: Right now, the theta that you're looking at is 3 cents.
2828.38s: If we fast forward a week over the course of that week, your theta remains 3 cents.
2834.42s: So no change, still the same 3 cents, but notice that your premium is less.
2839.14s: So what that means is even though the theta is not accelerating, the theta as a ratio to
2845.70s: the premium left in the option is absolutely accelerating massively.
2850.58s: And again, we can use it as an example here.
2853.34s: So the midpoint on these right now is 211.
2857.50s: So let's just take a look at what happens if we go from 238 to 211.
2862.70s: And again, remember, we're looking at the theta relationship relative.
2867.06s: So right now your theta is essentially 1.26% of your premium.
2872.02s: So now let's go to 211, which is what your options would be worth in a week.
2876.66s: It's now 1.42.
2878.82s: So we went from 1.26 to 1.42%.
2884.02s: So again, what this means is it exacerbates that scenario I showed you earlier.
2888.46s: That the longer it doesn't give you the move you need, the bigger move you need.
2893.22s: So it makes it very difficult to make money like that.
2895.94s: So then let's go in just another couple weeks.
2898.50s: So if you go into 17 April, well, shit, the option is now worth less.
2905.50s: And theta just stepped up to now 0.04.
2911.34s: So this problem becomes parabolic.
2914.86s: That's what I want you to take away from this.
2917.34s: So what that means is by buying an option literally during the main section of the decay
2924.62s: curve, this is just like a slide deck that I built to give references like this.
2930.02s: It's like a random smattering of shit.
2932.98s: This is where you are in terms of the theta decay curve.
2937.38s: Do you notice how when you're further out in time, the theta decay curve really is not that steep?
2943.38s: Pretty mellow.
2945.14s: But if we plot the slope once you get within 60 days, I mean, really from 90 to 60,
2951.86s: really starts to steep and steep and up, but not crazy.
2955.14s: But as you get in from 60, it literally goes parabolic.
2959.38s: So all of this summarized, the reason I don't like that option is because the bit-ass spread is
2965.38s: terrible. And because with the long option selected, these are going to decay away insanely fast.
2974.58s: And unless you get the move that you need very quickly, you will not have much to show for it
2980.42s: unfortunately. So yeah, that's why. I hope that the information at least itself is useful on that
2986.74s: like it makes sense. This is something that I just see, you know, GameStop option traders do a lot.
2992.90s: And as you can tell, it really is like, it's like painful for me because I hate seeing people lose
2998.98s: money like that. It just sucks because it's so preventable. It's so preventable. But it is just a,
3006.66s: it's just a knowledge gap unfortunately. So I hope that explains it.
3011.94s: Spiders says, thanks. I will hold for a week and get out. Yeah. And the thing is, is the other thing
3019.54s: you could consider is you could spread it off if you wanted. That's okay. And that'll salvage the
3026.50s: position where it is. But yeah, if if this were me and that was my position, I would personally want
3034.10s: to manage it quickly. But if I still have that same idea, make sure you watch that other video,
3041.38s: I sent, but what I would do is I would go further out in time, actually, I would go out to something
3048.18s: like this 125 days. And I would go deeper in the money, like a 68 delta, the options are more
3055.54s: expensive here. But if you take a look at the theta for these options, it's two pennies. Even if
3062.66s: they slide to add the money, it's two pennies. And again, remember the ratio here, this is two pennies
3069.62s: again, something that's almost twice the price of what you have. So it means that the total impact
3076.34s: to the trade is much, much less than what you will face. So yeah, a couple of ways to think about it.
3084.98s: All right, let's take a look at another one of these.
3088.50s: DDPs.
3093.06s: DTCC is finished. Okay.
3105.54s: The naked trading scandal is much worse than you may have first believed. I think, well, I think we
3109.86s: all believe that it's probably notably bad. The real shares in your account hold the same exact
3118.58s: rights as any other, but behind the curtain DTCC is historically covered up the FTDs and mass
3124.42s: naked shorting using C EBE counterfeit electronic book entries. This is the DTCC ways of maintaining
3132.18s: this reverse Ponzi scheme. This is why a non-standard dividend would ruin them. That's actually kind
3138.58s: of interesting as they cook books for everyone that DTCC is in trouble. I actually kind of like that
3149.30s: because this goes back to even the function that we see of
3158.02s: the voting rights around proxy votes, right? Like the fact that there's so many extra votes happening
3169.78s: that shouldn't exist. So this, I actually kind of like this idea.
3179.70s: Let's see how's the cards extraordinate inside into the inner work as a DTCC.
3185.38s: Okay. If you haven't read his letters, DTC, I have a, all right. Let's see.
3193.62s: So they're going to use NSS for naked short selling, system-ac issue for years. This is correct.
3199.46s: There were some changes that didn't impact anything that's correct.
3203.46s: Naked short setting was meant to curb the fraud and protect investors.
3206.74s: I argue that the pump and dumps would riot without the ability to sell shares that couldn't borrow.
3212.10s: Like the leady shareholder advocates are generously offering their services in the fight against
3216.18s: pump and dumps. They're offering to step up volunteer. Yeah. They're generously volunteer to take
3221.62s: the investors money and exchange for seed artificially raising the supply. This of course immediately
3226.90s: does damage to the investment. Okay. Okay. So it says after naked shorting is done what now,
3235.30s: the would be victim in the shareholder advocate now fundamentally of goals that are
3238.98s: opposite the buyer wants the stock to go to the moon. The naked short seller wants this business
3242.58s: to go bankrupt. Thanks. The question, why would an entity volunteer into protect against fraud still
3247.78s: take money of the investor? Okay. The maximum amount of shares that can legally be sold short is
3256.02s: governed by the number of shares that can legally be borrowed. NSS ignores this mechanism. We know
3261.86s: this DTCC enables this further due to the fact that the share can be lent up multiple directions.
3267.22s: We know this. This is the reason for FTDs and hundreds of percent. Yeah. That's exactly spot on.
3272.66s: So how does this play in a game stop? Okay. So they're saying how do you know if you have shares
3280.42s: effectively? And I mean, the thing is one thing to note here is that there's a difference between
3288.02s: like your shares and whether or not they're quote unquote real and then what might be happening
3294.10s: on the back end with your shares. But depending on your view of ownership, one of the ways that you
3304.26s: can do this is I mean, pretty much what a lot of people did with their shares, which is direct
3311.94s: frustration. If you lock them up, then they can't be moved around like that. But it doesn't really
3319.22s: change the back end issue because effectively what we're saying up here is that they and this
3324.34s: is true is like they don't need your shares necessarily, right? Because each share can be
3330.42s: loaned out in multiples. So they literally don't even need yours technically. Okay. Imagine,
3338.50s: let's see if I hold on to shares, it's the same as one share. I have legal rights. Okay.
3346.82s: Okay.
3354.10s: Let's see. You thought you were buying shares from a real shareholder. You see in the number of shares
3360.26s: you're brokerage account, why would you even think for a second that the shares aren't even there?
3364.42s: Well, again, like this is another like misconception to be honest. The idea that like this is the
3371.62s: same thing that if if you put a million dollars into the bank and if you go to the bank and you're
3377.78s: like, can I go look at my million dollars, they're going to tell you no, they're going to tell you
3382.26s: that the money's not there. They're going to tell you that if you want to withdraw a million dollars
3386.74s: for the bank, you literally have to give them like a week's notice. It's crazy. So that's because
3394.18s: like your physical money isn't sitting in the bank. They're loaning it out. The money is out
3398.42s: doing things. That's how the bank makes money. So it's the same thing when it comes to the shares.
3403.46s: Like just as I go to the bank, I have rights to that money. It's still my money, but it doesn't
3409.30s: mean that it's just sitting there parked in the bank. The bank is going to do stuff with it.
3412.90s: That is what happens with your shares unless you opt out of it. So the fact that if you open up
3418.58s: your account and you see shares, it doesn't inherently mean that like your shares are sitting
3423.86s: there parked in the account for you, it just means that you have rights to those shares.
3429.22s: And this is also why it's really important for people that invest to actually read the broker
3436.10s: agreements. The broker tells you all this just like the bank tells you all this if you actually
3440.02s: read the bank documents when you're putting your money into the bank. So it's the same thing here.
3445.22s: So just the thing to note is that like in this case, you don't, it's not even expected that the
3453.06s: shares are there. Like we don't expect again, the broker tells you that the shares aren't going to
3460.74s: be sitting there unless again, you opt into that. So let's see. Seeds that the DTCC do not represent
3472.82s: what you think of shares. They're packed. Okay, so literally just talked about that.
3476.90s: Okay, so because the DTCC are complicit in ensuring that this fraud is covered up every time,
3484.18s: a shareholder tries to exercise the rights and attach to only real shares.
3489.62s: These are not real shares. Do not have the rights. Okay. However, they have to maintain the
3496.98s: illusion that they have these rights to not expose the fraud. I think this is conflating two
3505.22s: different issues personally. I think that this is tying in the rights of share ownership.
3513.94s: And I think it's tying in naked shorting, which are two disparate issues to highlight. But let's
3522.74s: continue. DTCC won't turn around and say you can't sell. Yeah. So what happens if a non-standard
3528.90s: dividend is issued, the DTCC can't cook the books and are forced to reconcile the float back down
3533.86s: to its issued amount. Sure, it's have to close their positions. They need everyone to cancel out
3539.62s: their fake borrow. What if no one sells? Okay. Because I, oh, that was it. My bad. I thought there was
3548.42s: because I actually don't disagree with this. Well, that I don't disagree with the concept here
3553.86s: that if they forced a special dividend, it does force a reconciliation. Now, I don't know
3561.94s: actually the back end well enough to intelligently speak and definitively say that they're forced
3570.10s: to reconcile the float back down to its issued amount that I don't know. And it's because
3577.86s: it wouldn't surprise me if there's ways to circumnavigate that and simply just to get the
3582.10s: special dividend to the actual shareholders because they know who the actual shareholders are.
3586.26s: But yeah, interesting. I actually like this one. I don't think that the DTCC is finished, but I
3597.94s: do like what they're talking about and I get it. This is cool. I like just clicking on this one
3604.18s: quick. I like this one because it's an Oberos. Yeah, there it is. So for those that don't know,
3608.90s: I have a tattoo on the left arm of an Oberos, which is super cool. I'm glad that they have one
3615.38s: in there. It's neat. All right, let's take a look at this one. Home Depot Hank
3622.90s: 69. Kind of a fun name. Let's see.
3633.62s: Oh, geez. Okay. I mean, this one's okay. This one just has like a lot of fluff.
3645.54s: All right, let's see. Okay, good. Enough joking around time to get serious. Perfect. That's where I'm at.
3650.18s: There's been absolute slew of data about FDD's dark pools rule changes, which still so interesting
3655.62s: to me is that we continue to demonize dark pools and don't actually fully understand them.
3664.02s: I think I now understand how all this fits together and have just made a GME theory of everything.
3669.14s: Okay, let's see.
3673.70s: Eventually FDD cycles the idea that because shorts have continually shorted GME,
3677.94s: covered it with borrowed shares and used naked shorts,
3680.66s: the shorter exposure is multiple hires than the actual shares of GMEs and existence. Yep.
3685.94s: Because of this. And the SEC rules forced in the cover every 35 days. They're a predictable price
3692.26s: and volume hikes on the chart, which I think we've identified as not fully accurate, right?
3700.18s: Is that the general consensus across the community? Because that's definitely been my observation.
3705.22s: That's what we've talked about. But I don't know if that's like widely adopted across the community
3710.82s: net community yet or not. So if you could fill me in there, that would be super helpful.
3717.54s: As every FDD cycle passes, prices to cover get more and more expensive.
3722.82s: And more and more shares are required to maintain their position, which makes it progressively
3728.42s: more expensive and progressively increases their position. Why? Why? Can somebody explain that to me?
3738.66s: I don't know why they're drawing that conclusion. I get up in the door.
3747.78s: I don't know why we're saying this definitively that as every FDD cycle passes, the prices
3760.82s: to cover get more expensive and that they have to get more shares.
3768.58s: I'm sure that it's something in one of the prior posts, but I just don't see the mechanics of that.
3773.70s: Yeah, I just, I think that that's a big leap that's being made because it doesn't like, there's
3782.42s: no underlying forcing function from the market that would cause that to be the case.
3788.10s: But anyways, let's continue. Because heavy naked shorted probably started in 2020.
3794.18s: Each passing month or exposure increases drastically because naked short gives them double
3798.02s: the obligation they must cover the short and the naked created share.
3803.38s: This is why I believe that the current short position is multiples higher.
3808.74s: Again, this is also making a like a really, really, really big leap.
3813.46s: G.C. says one Thor, I got you. He just laid down in his bed.
3817.06s: But no.
3824.58s: Now I did just trim up his face.
3828.98s: So you can see his eyes now. Check out those eyeballs.
3833.30s: He's a little on the grumpy side because it's pre-dinner right now. He would like his dinner.
3839.14s: Is that correct? But Mel's not here and I'm in here. So he's having to to keep it real.
3846.74s: But I mean, he's here. He's doing the thing. You see him? He sees his eyeballs.
3851.14s: He's good. Check this out.
3853.94s: Oh boy.
3854.90s: Who knows how to do that? He also does face licking. That happens too.
3861.38s: He's good little dude.
3866.18s: Well, feed him in a hot minute. You got it G.C. I know what it's like.
3870.02s: Anytime, I remember when I was in college. I love dogs. So anytime I had a chance to see a dog,
3874.90s: I was always stoked. So all right, let's continue. This why I believe the current position is
3880.82s: multiple hires. I just think that's a giant assumption that's not really based on
3885.14s: something we can prove. Similar to the January squeeze, eventually the pressure would be too much
3890.34s: forced out. Yeah. I mean, I think we're honestly, I think we're based on a faulty premise, to be honest.
3904.90s: This is another thing is like the flow trading off exchange that doesn't suppress the buying
3910.90s: pressure technically. And this is the other thing. See, like this is the thing that
3919.54s: this is the thing that I think is interesting because we talk about
3928.26s: we talk about the basics like here about like their reading tons of posts about dark pools.
3934.66s: But then we're citing the dark pools here as if it's even remotely close to the same as internalization
3942.90s: and relevant to suppressing of the buying power. Like the reality is that again, like dark pool
3949.54s: orders hit the consolidated tape within 15 seconds, typically a couple seconds after the transaction.
3956.10s: So this isn't actually that.
3965.14s: Okay.
3969.70s: ETF shorting. We know this. All right, let's see how they're saying how it all fits together.
3976.10s: After the cycle, dark pool, OTC activity, ETF shorting, upcoming rules that could benefit us.
3983.06s: First, dark pool, OTC data indicates what we already know.
3986.66s: Edge funds are in a giant fuckery hole in a bus. They borrowed shares, covered those borrowed shares,
3994.42s: borrowed shares. I don't think it proves this. They've been repeating this forever, which is why
4001.30s: the price of GME is still so high and volatile. I don't think that's it either.
4006.50s: They do most of the covering in dark pools to suppress buying pressure. This is again, incorrect.
4012.82s: Transactions that occur in dark pools, they don't suppress buying pressure. It still hits the
4017.14s: consolidated tape and do other shady things in this dark pool so it goes unnoticed.
4023.62s: Yeah. More over GMEs, on balance volume is always perplex me. How could OBV still be this high
4029.94s: post squeeze? The DD on dark pools explains that they are covering in dark pools to suppress
4035.38s: buying pressure. OBV shows that. It won't show that. This means that apes did not sell post squeeze
4043.54s: and that the hedge funds did indeed use negative shorts to create artificial selling pressure.
4048.74s: I do believe that that absolutely can be the case. I'm not convinced that it's hedge funds.
4054.50s: I don't think we can definitively say hedge funds. But I do think I'm not saying it is or
4061.14s: isn't. I'm just saying I don't think we can isolate them and say it is them.
4066.18s: OTC data also explains the low volume. The funds are covering. Again, this is not correct.
4075.06s: So volume being low is nothing to do with the transactions going on in dark pools.
4078.74s: Again, it hits the consolidated tape. I'm not trying to keep saying that point, but I'm just
4083.70s: literally going through this piece by piece and reiterating where it applies. This also explains
4088.50s: the random one PM jumps in by volume that I noticed in a previous post. It doesn't explain that.
4094.50s: So one of the things that you'll notice in by volume at specific times throughout the day,
4098.66s: it's typically the first hour of the day and the last hour of the day. You'll almost always
4103.70s: see that trend. And that's where broad market liquidity occurs. This happens in every ticker.
4109.54s: So if we take a look at a five day, 15 minute chart, that's actually we need a little more
4117.94s: compressed time. Let's take a look at a, I'm going to zoom this out to be like a five day though,
4123.54s: so that we can see more iterations of it. This will be a five day, five minute.
4127.46s: What I want you to notice is take a look at the volume, typically at the start of each day
4133.78s: and then at the end of each day. There will be spikes throughout the day as different entities to
4138.74s: choose to transact at those times for different reasons, but at the beginning of each day and at
4143.54s: the end of each day, you're going to see the same spike. This is not unique to GameStop.
4149.94s: The last comparison we use is Apple. If we look at Apple spike in the beginning of the day,
4154.42s: I get the end of the day. If we take a look at spy, the S&P 500 index ETF, I can be getting
4161.30s: the day, I get the end of the day. This is always the case. And this is for two broad reasons. I actually
4167.30s: have a video that goes over the details of market liquidity and why you see this trend.
4176.26s: And I'll show you that video here, but it has everything to do with when different
4185.14s: periods open up in the market that other activities are going on. And that's exactly why,
4192.50s: beginning of the day, end of the day, it is trains never late. It's always there.
4197.62s: So anyways, back to this. So this, the random jumps at 1 p.m. That's way more likely to be an
4205.70s: individual entity that's processing their orders at that point for some reason. And that can be
4210.82s: for a lot of different reasons. That's why you notice in all those others tickers that we looked at,
4215.30s: their absolutely your periods where it just shoots up. And it's typically one volume bar, whether
4220.26s: it's five minutes, 15 minutes, it's typically tied to a small number of trades because it's so easy
4226.34s: to be excessive volume in those more quiet periods as compared to the total volume of the busier
4233.30s: periods or the total volume of the day. Okay, furthermore, dark pool, T.C. data provides almost
4240.66s: irrefutable evidence that there's still fuckery of foot with GameStop. Again, I have no idea how
4245.14s: dark pool does that. The shorts have indeed dug themselves into a hole that they cannot get out.
4250.42s: Do not see how it proves that. The exposure that the short funds have is astronomical. Again,
4256.50s: I, and I'm not saying this to just say like I don't agree with it. I like I genuinely don't see
4262.26s: how OTC data or dark pool data are proving any of these definitively. Unless for some odd reason,
4269.86s: all apes sell the moas will in fact happen and it will happen big.
4277.70s: I don't agree with that either. Like I don't think that these things lead to that scenario.
4284.34s: And the other thing I will continue to remind the apes of, I think that apes need to hear this
4289.54s: for their own good is that if broad market entities interfered with the prior squeeze that we had,
4300.74s: by turning off the buy button, why would in any world going forward, they not intervene again
4312.82s: and just allow it to go further? Right? Like it doesn't make sense. So one of the massive
4322.42s: inconsistencies I see with these kind of dds is we say things like there's massive fuckery going on
4332.02s: and that the game is rigged that everybody's in cooats with one another that everything is fake,
4337.70s: artificially suppressed. But then we think that there's going to be this uncontrolled squeeze
4344.50s: that's just going to go. Right? Like it just logically doesn't make sense. So the argument I'm
4353.06s: posing here is that because there are clear, there is clear evidence that manipulation occurs
4363.78s: in different ways. FTD is one of the main, one of the main vectors that occurs in it. We can see it.
4369.22s: It is there. It is bullshit. There's no way that you should be able to have more than 100%
4376.74s: of the float short. Right? It just doesn't fucking make sense. So absolutely. Then we can also see
4383.70s: the incestuous relationship with a place like Citadel that somehow has a hedge fund
4391.14s: arm that's making directional bets and ideas and also has a market making arm. As if there's not
4399.06s: going to be crossover between those. That's utter bullshit. It's the same thing with fucking
4404.10s: Congress trading. As if the decisions Congress is making when they're placing their individual stock
4410.90s: trades is not somehow based on information that they have access to. Right? Like it's just insane
4419.62s: to even suggest that. So those things aside, I think that if there is that scale of manipulation,
4429.70s: it doesn't really then reconcile why we think that this kind of massive painful move for those
4437.86s: very same entities would occur. It's kind of, I mean, to me, it's just counterintuitive. That's
4446.34s: all I just, I haven't seen a good explanation for how that, how that relationship
4453.86s: makes sense or how it would play out. I just broke my pen. So I'm trying to,
4460.66s: it's the worst. Keep myself for that.
4469.14s: What is that? What the fuck?
4475.86s: Guys, I just, I just fucked up bad.
4478.34s: I guess this thing has to be here.
4490.90s: Okay. I think I got the, oh, we'll figure that out later. That's a fun game.
4500.74s: All right, let's continue.
4502.66s: Yeah.
4504.66s: Headphones are indeed in a deep hole, not covered, trading in high volumes and dark pulls.
4511.38s: Again, I don't really agree with that.
4514.34s: GMEs insanely hard to borrow and there's very little demand for it. I do agree that it was
4518.50s: very hard to borrow. That was actually one of the most interesting elements of GameStop
4522.74s: that unfortunately has changed a little bit with the recent at the markets. But I do fully agree
4530.42s: that GameStop being in a place where, I mean, I don't know, I think of it as GameStop was
4543.30s: super well positioned while it was hard to borrow to cause this broader context, like this broader
4549.62s: confluence of things to occur. So that I actually fully agree with. I think that that's
4555.94s: completely accurate. So yeah, on the same point there, figured out how to fix my pen, by the way.
4562.58s: That's called OCD where you can't stop thinking about something until it's done, but it's done.
4571.86s: OTC data adds credence to the idea that FDD cycle is getting more and more expensive.
4576.66s: Okay, so let's see if it expands on that. Why isn't some will coming in to take advantage,
4582.10s: benefited the squeeze. There would be new rules, DD coming to play because Wall Street has
4586.58s: access to better, more accurate data. While it's with the DTCC, put all these rules liquidation
4592.66s: bankruptcy and oversight after the GME squeeze. I don't that unfortunately didn't expand on that in
4599.78s: the way that I hope it would because I still don't understand that point. I don't see the evidence
4604.18s: behind it. Inclusion four, Wales have purposely sideline themselves and are waiting for the
4610.90s: proposed regulatory rules to take effect so the squeeze doesn't destroy the financial system.
4615.54s: The courts are using dark pools to suppress buying pressure to drop the price by rapidly
4619.78s: trading between each other. That doesn't make sense. The squeeze will happen once the availability
4632.02s: of shares to borrow is completely dried up, which seems to be rapidly approaching, which obviously
4639.06s: know. With the benefit of hindsight, it wasn't right. FDD cycle is persistent and exemplifies the
4647.46s: naked shorting problem. I do agree that it identifies elements of the naked shorting problem. I don't
4653.70s: think that it exemplifies the details of it because I actually think that FDD cycle is just one measure
4660.18s: that helps us look into it, but I don't think it's, I think there's more to it.
4669.14s: This is always bad practice. This is saying each of these days is between T33 and 35.
4680.82s: What we're doing is very standard statistical flaw in analysis and this is called overfitting.
4688.02s: We're essentially looking at a period of interest historically and then we're trying to figure out
4692.90s: how the data fits. I've ran broad data analysis on GameStop, both pre and post at the market offerings
4703.70s: to see literally every variation of time-based cycles that I could find. Literally, that's
4711.54s: everything from T plus zero, T plus one, T plus two all the way out. Then it was also with
4717.06s: calendar variations to see what the correlation is between these various durations and subsequent
4723.38s: stock price movement. It's generally broadly not correlated. That's just from a higher level.
4739.46s: It would be true. I want to emphasize not my opinion. I love many possible catalysts.
4746.02s: It's talking about potential reasons, which I think are all fair. We can postulate different
4750.66s: catalysts and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Ftd cycle slowly chewing away.
4758.18s: At shorts, obviously, we've not seen that. The dark pool data does not confirm that.
4765.30s: If you have fun, read this. I do want to read this because I do not, again, the thing that I
4777.46s: want to continually remind everybody of. My goal is not anything related to hype things up or
4786.02s: break things down and to diminish the potential impacts. My entire lens, generally of the world,
4794.34s: but particularly markets is the best attempt I can possibly conjure up at objective analysis.
4802.90s: That is literally my goal standard. It's because it's how I trade. It's the only way to make money
4808.58s: in markets. If I approach markets, what's the lens of what I want to see? That's a really great
4814.82s: way to lose money because the market doesn't give the slightest fuck about what I want to see.
4820.90s: The market is going to do whatever the market is going to do. So anyways,
4825.86s: they know more than us. There's no way there's no way they'll let this happen again. It's been trading
4829.70s: sideways. Yep. What's happening to GME is not normal. 100% correct. At the highest level, that is
4840.10s: one of the easiest takeaways to always circle back to in that the performance of GameStop is not normal.
4847.94s: That is completely correct. This is completely correct. I completely, completely,
4854.18s: completely agree with this. This is one of the best points they've made in this.
4862.74s: Interesting. Yeah. I mean, I liked the overall intent behind the piece and I liked the way that
4870.18s: they were trying to think things up. Again, I think that there's a lot of misunderstandings at a
4874.66s: fundamental level, but I mean, I still enjoyed it. I thought that it was at least like, again,
4880.42s: like I always appreciate an honest, sincere attempt at rigorous analysis and I can appreciate it as
4887.30s: that. So I enjoyed looking at that one. So interesting. Yeah. Pretty cool stuff. I think that wraps
4894.66s: me up for today. As always, if you guys need anything, let me know. I'm going to go feed Thor.
4899.38s: And I'll see you all around on the next stream on the next time we're hanging out in the
4904.18s: discord, whatever it is. But if you need anything in the meantime, you can always reach out.
4907.70s: Be an outlier. Be an ape. See you later.
