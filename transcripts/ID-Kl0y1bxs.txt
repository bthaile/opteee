505.00s: You know, directly happy to, but if you'd rather keep that offline,
508.48s: more than happy to do that, I just want to talk about some of the concepts
511.70s: behind the dialogue that we had.
513.98s: Then I want to walk through a little bit more of the AMA questions that I got
518.16s: for last week that I didn't get to.
520.92s: And before all of that, one of the things I want to start doing on these beginner
527.20s: trading sessions is recapping the markets, not from me, from you.
534.48s: So to start us off, I would love everybody that's watching and able to throw
542.52s: into the chat one thing that you saw this week can be something interesting,
548.60s: can be something you didn't understand.
550.60s: It can be something that was a first for you.
553.92s: It could be something that you thought was going to happen and happened.
557.08s: It could be literally anything related to the markets.
561.00s: The reason why I want to start this process is because one of my underlying
565.52s: assumptions is I would guess most of you may not have a specific cycle or
575.32s: habit to reconcile what happened in the market on a daily basis.
582.40s: If I had to guess a lot of people will go through the look at the markets
587.16s: every day, which is awesome.
589.40s: But my guess is we're not taking the time to synthesize what happened and
596.20s: kind of acknowledge what happened for our minds to cling onto because there's
600.32s: a ton of learning that happens when we very meaningfully go through and review
606.56s: what happened in the military we call it an AAR after action review or
611.60s: report if you're writing it like an officer does, which is super annoying.
615.08s: They're not fun.
616.16s: But it's the process of analyzing things but very purposefully.
621.36s: So let's see.
623.52s: We have Jimmy saying GME going down, down and down sort of.
629.52s: I mean, I did a video right before this looking at GameStop and it actually
633.24s: didn't, it didn't create her too far.
635.28s: I think it's when I look at GME, I actually view this as running sideways,
641.52s: consolidating.
642.44s: So maybe that's a good first starting point for us.
645.72s: Right? Because when I think about GME going down, I would think of GME approaching
650.16s: near term lows.
651.68s: And I'm sure some of what you're saying is just ingest, right?
655.08s: That it's not necessarily going the direction we want, which I totally get here
658.60s: for here for that.
659.92s: But just to again, clarify, I actually don't think GME is going through in this
665.80s: case right now.
666.68s: It looks like it's actually consolidating pretty well.
669.32s: Now to your broader point, if this does start rotating over, that does start
675.00s: looking like downside to me.
676.72s: Now, if we think about analyzing a chart, again, I'm going to use these as learning
680.84s: experiences for everybody.
682.64s: If we're analyzing a chart, what's one of the first things we can do to identify
687.84s: if something is in an uptrend, downtrend consolidation?
691.80s: And you'll notice that within this single chart, depending on the aggregation
695.76s: period, you'll notice actually all of those.
697.88s: But what do we look for?
699.24s: There's a couple very simple things.
706.76s: Actually, yeah, let me caveat that question with I want the most simple
710.48s: variations you can think of.
711.76s: I'm not looking to be super complex.
716.40s: Reese says linear regression channel sloping.
718.48s: That's great.
719.00s: So these are standard deviation channels, but linear regression channel,
722.52s: standard deviation channels either or totally cool.
725.04s: I think both of those are correct.
727.24s: That's actually one of the beautiful parts about these broader statistical
731.08s: measures of price movement is that it inherently gives you a trend, right?
735.32s: Straight up.
736.12s: So first, good.
739.84s: Anything else?
742.36s: Coming to an apex.
743.72s: Okay, I like that.
745.08s: Let's talk about that.
746.76s: If I were to classify the primary indicators of a general trend,
754.08s: linear regression channel, standard deviation channels, either of those,
757.24s: immediately shows it to you.
758.40s: Literally, it makes it undeniable what it is.
761.96s: I can see it based on the slope of these lines.
765.40s: What's even more important to me to determine trend is the relative position
771.20s: of highs and lows.
773.04s: Sometimes I'll call them terms.
774.44s: Sometimes I'll call them swing.
775.76s: It's because I'm lazy.
776.84s: I use them interchangeably.
778.80s: But let's take a look.
781.64s: We have a high here.
784.44s: Then we go down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, we have a low here.
789.92s: Then we go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, we have a higher low here.
795.76s: Then we go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, then we have a high.
801.28s: What do you notice about this high compared to the other high that I showed you?
808.44s: Jesse is already all over it.
811.28s: So we have a lower high, a lower high.
815.28s: From the lowest perspective, we have a low higher low, lower low.
824.28s: So one of the things that you should identify here is that it very rarely is a clear
829.28s: and very clear.
830.28s: So one of the things that you should identify here is that it very rarely is a clear
837.28s: and very clear.
838.28s: It's very rarely is this beautiful, higher highs, lower lows stacked without ever
844.28s: having again, higher lows that then turn into lower lows.
849.28s: So when we're talking about the world of analyzing technical analysis and the price
854.28s: movement of things, context is so important.
857.28s: So that's why we tend to use multiple indicators.
860.28s: We use other things to help us understand context.
865.28s: To which Lauren says, UG, Lauren, why UG?
870.28s: Feel like that's fair.
872.28s: Don't agree?
876.28s: Or we don't like that.
879.28s: But that is the reality of things is that we have to pay attention to the positions
884.28s: of lows and highs.
886.28s: That's one of the easiest ways to determine trends.
891.28s: So,
892.28s: next, let's take a look at another thing.
897.28s: Well, first, what timeframe is this?
901.28s: What timeframe are we looking at?
905.28s: It's up here three month daily.
908.28s: So what will we call that timeframe?
910.28s: Is that a long time, a short time, a medium time?
915.28s: How do we think about something like a three month timeframe?
920.28s: Like a three month chart?
927.28s: What do we think?
936.28s: Jimmy says, learn something new from all your videos.
938.28s: Good. That's what I love.
940.28s: That's exactly the goal.
941.28s: Especially for this video, I specifically spent a lot of time trying to teach concepts
945.28s: in the Friday session.
946.28s: So that's fantastic to hear.
949.28s: Joey says depends on the trade.
951.28s: It doesn't actually.
952.28s: It's a good guess, but it actually doesn't depend on the trade at all.
956.28s: Time is objective.
959.28s: Like one day is objectively one day.
962.28s: Now, I understand your concept regarding the thesis of the trade
966.28s: and the way that you choose to trade.
968.28s: That could be a long term timeframe or a short term timeframe.
971.28s: 100% completely agree with you.
974.28s: But if we're thinking of this in the context of exactly,
978.28s: the potato is exactly on the money for what I'm highlighting here
983.28s: with respect to the duration.
985.28s: Think of it this way.
987.28s: Think of the weather, right?
989.28s: So if I today Southern California, it was a little San Diego.
994.28s: So it was a little, we had a little bit of marine layer coming in towards the end of the day.
998.28s: It was like low 70s, high 60s, sunny.
1001.28s: There was a little bit of a breeze.
1003.28s: So I don't know, maybe just Californians
1007.28s: might have found a little cold.
1009.28s: I throw that out there because we're just trying to get by here, right?
1012.28s: And Southern California that's it's we're just one day at a time.
1015.28s: It's very difficult for us.
1017.28s: So while we're going through our very challenging high 60s, low 70s,
1022.28s: moderately cloudy weather.
1025.28s: If I am to analyze what is what's a higher probability play for the weather tomorrow?
1032.28s: If I need to guess what it is, what I look at the weather today,
1036.28s: what I look at the weather six months ago.
1039.28s: Any guesses?
1042.28s: It's pretty self-explanatory, right?
1045.28s: The best predictor of the weather tomorrow is the weather today.
1049.28s: So what I'm looking at with respect to a chart is that as you add time,
1057.28s: the susceptibility to new factors in new market,
1061.28s: new market movement enters the equation.
1065.28s: Now, I have to be abundantly clear because I do not what again,
1071.28s: I find this all the time with people is that they take the inverse of what I'm saying,
1074.28s: which is a it's a common logical fault that people have.
1078.28s: I'm not suggesting that short term timeframes are more predictable
1084.28s: in the sense that a lot of people interpret that to mean, meaning in a really short term timeframe,
1090.28s: it's a fucking crap shoot if something goes up or down, it's a crap shoot.
1095.28s: I'm not suggesting that short term timeframes are predictable to that degree.
1100.28s: What I'm highlighting is that if I were to analyze the expected price performance of GameStop on Monday when the market opens,
1110.28s: my guess is that it's going to be something around here that we'll see.
1115.28s: Whether it's up or down, I do not know.
1119.28s: How far in this range it goes up or down, I also do not know.
1124.28s: Now, as we think about the probability of news coming out over the weekend to influence GameStop,
1133.28s: right, there's two days until the market opens.
1136.28s: Okay, that's time for things to change things to happen.
1139.28s: Now, if we think about if it's a trading week, the difference between day to day,
1144.28s: it's much less, right, it's less than 24 hours that we can experience new information coming into
1151.28s: change things.
1152.28s: It's a lower window for new material information to enter the equation.
1156.28s: As we stack more and more time, we stack bigger and bigger windows for new information to enter the equation.
1164.28s: This is exactly why when we look at stuff like a probability cone, let's take a look at
1173.28s: this probability cone.
1176.28s: What do you notice?
1178.28s: Don't worry about the teardrop function of it.
1181.28s: You can ignore that for now.
1183.28s: But what do you notice about the shape of this teardrop cone?
1188.28s: And for that's not a teardrop cone, by the way, I'm just trying to make it more accessible to people.
1193.28s: This is a parabola.
1194.28s: It's a probability projection using one standard deviation move.
1199.28s: But what do you notice the further out we go?
1203.28s: If this is the expected high range, this is the expected low range.
1208.28s: As I go further out in time, what do you see about the expected high range low range compared to if I look at something 20 days out,
1218.28s: the expected high range low range compared to something that's.
1224.28s: What do you notice about how this looks wider?
1229.28s: Jesse's on it.
1232.28s: Much wider.
1234.28s: So as we add duration to things, we add time for new things to enter into the pricing models and then to move price.
1244.28s: So the way that we look at something like a three month chart.
1250.28s: Now, from again, to Joey's earlier point, for your perspective as a trader, that could feel like a really long time.
1257.28s: If you're an intraday trader, three months can feel like an eternity.
1261.28s: Or if you're an investor, three months doesn't even register on your fucking radar.
1266.28s: It doesn't matter.
1267.28s: You move in years, not months.
1270.28s: So there's a relative component based on the style of the trader.
1274.28s: But there's a objective component based on the ingestion of information and the probabilistic movement of things that expands over time.
1283.28s: So if I take a look at 90 days here, I can tell you the expected range over a 90 day period within one standard deviation.
1295.28s: If I do the probability of a touch over 90 days, we're looking at a within a one standard deviation move.
1301.28s: We're looking at 37 to 10 and three quarters.
1306.28s: If I look at that over a one week move, we're looking at 25, which is 12 points lower to 17, just seven points higher.
1317.28s: That is objectively a massive difference.
1322.28s: So in this time frame, there's the probability for way more information to enter the equation, thus moving price.
1330.28s: So three months is actually a moderate length of time, right?
1335.28s: Because as we look at, if we plotted the changes day over day, you'll notice that the relationship is somewhat linear, but not purely.
1347.28s: So there will be periods where over a five day period that's from 50 to 60 days, there might be a slightly different change in the overall price range expectation, then a shorter five day period, but in a total of 10 day period, right, total 10 day window.
1366.28s: So what's the takeaway for all of this?
1369.28s: We need to understand the context of timing in the light of how information is integrated into price and thus the subsequent movement of price.
1381.28s: That's the first part we need to take away from this section.
1385.28s: The second part we need to take away from this section is it is very important for a trader to align their trading concepts, strategies, thesis, profit mechanisms, and strategies with corresponding time frames.
1404.28s: Now, again, my guess, if I had everybody pull out their trading plans right now for a pop quiz, my guess is less than a quarter of you would have a trading plan to produce.
1418.28s: And that is in the context of people in our community who know that I beat this concept to a fucking just a bloody pulp.
1429.28s: It's like taking the horse to water and drowning it. I beat this concept so much yet it will still be again, if I were to do a statistical analysis of this, I'm guessing a minority that will have that done.
1442.28s: This isn't a pick on anybody. I'm just talking about the realities of this thing that we do is trading this is what it is doesn't bother me. It is what it is.
1450.28s: But if we had traders first break out their trading plans, it would be a minority that has them.
1458.28s: And then if we go into the trading plan, we zoom in a click and then we start trying to analyze how many traders have really solid alignment between trading strategies, profit mechanisms, in time frames, my guess is that number cuts even further for who has that done.
1479.28s: And it's because a lot of people don't think about it. It's not because it's a big secret or anything, but that's part of building a trading plan. I didn't realize that I was going to be talking about trading plans, but you know I'm always fucking happy to get on that soapbox.
1491.28s: So here I go. But that is one of the beautiful parts about making a trading plan is that as you're trying to think through how this thing might work, it naturally starts to beg the question of how long do I hold things?
1506.28s: How do I find these things? It matters a lot. So I'll give you an example. If I think about trading something like a momentum strategy, I can tell you from a quantitative perspective, I know this objectively to be true because I've studied it.
1525.28s: I know that prices stocks that are experiencing larger 52 week price movements are more likely to exhibit continuation of that price movement over the next month, then to something that has a high three month price movement.
1545.28s: That matters to me a lot. That information is going to tell me a lot. It's going to tell me based on the profit mechanism momentum. I now need to understand the traits, how it behaves, the way it works. You all have already seen this and you all know that I'm always happy to bring out my abomination of a slide deck.
1570.28s: I literally just added more to this, by the way, so it really is becoming like this gross abomination. But you already know about the big four strategy process that's literally what I'm describing right now.
1585.28s: So the way that all of this comes back into time frames is because when I look at something like a profit mechanism that I'm trying to extract, I need to figure out what time frames are most suitable one for the profit mechanism itself, but then also to analyze the presence of it and the corresponding indicators.
1604.28s: So that is the starting point here.
1609.28s: So literally all of that came off of one person's singular observation, but as you know, I'm always happy to go down rabbit holes, but let me go back up.
1622.28s: I want to grab a couple others that you all saw.
1627.28s: I see Reese says oil rallied oil did rally. That's a good observation. Let's talk about the rally and oil really fast. That's actually one of the things we're going to talk about today because I have a trade in here that is going to be one of the case study trades.
1641.28s: But what about oil? What do we what do we see here? Like what what's going on here? Does anybody know the context behind oils move?
1653.28s: Now I want to be clear. The context behind oils move doesn't actually matter that much. The reason I'm looking up, by the way, as I've screen up here, I'm just looking at futures.
1665.28s: War that's a big part of it. So when Iran and Israel started kicking off with one another. It definitely moved oil, but it already started to base here.
1678.28s: Right. So that was a massive catalyst. But then what go we have to go further, right. So the impact of in Israeli Iran conflict.
1688.28s: It's spider webs like most things in the market.
1692.28s: So then when we're trading something there's a reason for this rabbit hole, by the way.
1700.28s: So if we're trading something like this. When we're trying to chart out the movement of something, what our price targets are, how we think something might behave.
1712.28s: Those details matter quite a lot actually in my opinion.
1718.28s: So when we think about identifying the origin of the move, the catalyst here being war big initial catalyst, then we have to click in a few layers to understand how pervasive is the catalyst, how much of this does how much of this comes down to Saudi and OPEC essentially releasing too much oil in the beginning start driving price down because they miscalculated.
1744.28s: How long does that last? Those kinds of details can be baked into a strategy. Now I want to be also very, very clear.
1755.28s: You don't even need to know any of that to trade a movement. You don't need to know any of it.
1762.28s: So the reason why I'm giving you these two different scenarios is because it's up to you as a trader to figure out how much information you need in order to pull the trigger on something.
1775.28s: And I see especially in the mentoring program, I see a gamut. I see people who jump into the things light years before the ready in my opinion.
1786.28s: And then I see other people that probably understand something better than I do. And they still won't make the fucking trade because they want to look at it even more, right? It's completely personality dependent and it's hilarious to me. How varied it is.
1802.28s: But going back to and tying this back to the first component we were discussing. If I wanted to come up with a six month thesis for crude oil.
1815.28s: If for whatever reason, I'm looking for a six month thesis. How much research. What I probably have to do compared to if I'm just trading this recent surge and fully expect to just get out when it reverses.
1832.28s: What would you, how would you vary the amount of research that goes into those?
1840.28s: First mango orange is down. That happened quick. That happened real quick. Damn.
1850.28s: I have a second one, but now the question is, do I do the second mango orange already or do I do the lemon, seltzer water and slow down?
1859.28s: I think I rage and go for second mango orange.
1864.28s: Reese says almost none versus all the time in the world fair. Jesse says you'd be looking at price action and volume over macro news.
1872.28s: Jotato says you can look at a chart instantly compared to the history of barrel prices seems a bit extensive.
1882.28s: So there's a bunch of different ways to look at it, but what I can tell you unequivocally is that no matter what you do, there's going to be more analysis tied to a six month thesis compared to the amount of analysis that we need to do to trade the momentum of something over a short term duration.
1908.28s: Now, this is a very interesting kind of trade.
1913.28s: Thor looks so disenfranchised. I brought him to the vet today. So he had to get his rabies and they also had to take blood and he looks like he's been through it.
1924.28s: I'll grab him real quick before I let him out because he is.
1931.28s: He's looking he's looking real rough.
1935.28s: I'm going to come.
1942.28s: He is moving.
1955.28s: He's got a flipped ear and everything. He is grabbing my arm. Let me.
1965.28s: Thank you.
1968.28s: Thank you.
1970.28s: He wasn't he wasn't into me fixing his ear.
1974.28s: So here he is. He's a little.
1977.28s: He's a little disenfranchised. He's not.
1981.28s: He's not like fish. We give him salmon a lot. So that's kind of why we have a little bit of fish going on here.
1986.28s: How are we doing?
1988.28s: Are you ready for? Do you try to go as a lady for dinner? Is that what you want? Let you go.
1995.28s: Apparently he was a little bit of a shit head when they try to take his blood and they they tried to take it from his arm and he wouldn't let them.
2005.28s: So they ended up having to take it from his fucking neck.
2009.28s: I didn't know that that was a thing.
2011.28s: So I think I think overall tough experience for the dude today.
2015.28s: So he appreciates all the.
2029.28s: Is it. He just looks like he's seen some shit.
2032.28s: Like he just has that. He has that look.
2035.28s: That's so funny.
2038.28s: Lauren says Thor is always wearing a tie. Yeah, we call it a tuxedo.
2043.28s: We always say even though he wears nothing, he's always better dressed essentially than all of us.
2048.28s: Because he is he literally has a straight up tuxedo. So he's very formal.
2056.28s: All right.
2058.28s: Jotato says distinctly gentleman exactly. He is.
2063.28s: Uh oh.
2065.28s: This the maintenance.
2068.28s: Tomorrow. Okay, so this will happen during the GME live stream.
2071.28s: So this is going to crater. I see.
2075.28s: Okay, so back to this.
2078.28s: And the idea of aligning thesis with profit mechanism with strategy.
2083.28s: The summary of this section so far before we go into the trades and all this stuff will do that in a little bit.
2089.28s: But when I take a look at the longer term price movement,
2096.28s: you'll notice that this actually is kind of bucking the trend, right?
2101.28s: So for me, if you're trading something via a breakout strategy,
2106.28s: this clearly isn't the continuation of something because over the last year,
2110.28s: I'm coming down pretty hard.
2112.28s: So we'll talk about the trade itself in a little bit,
2116.28s: but I want you to start thinking more carefully about the amount of research that's being done.
2121.28s: And then the corresponding trade period that aligns with that.
2128.28s: And it's I guess I should actually reverse that right?
2131.28s: The trade period then the corresponding amount of research.
2134.28s: Because if I'm trading something on a really short term timeframe,
2137.28s: it's a giant, it's a giant miss. It doesn't make any sense.
2140.28s: So you have to make sure that those things are aligned is the punch line.
2145.28s: Potato says Eric and a stream with Yahoo Finance charts tomorrow.
2148.28s: That's exactly it. We go to Yahoo Finance charts for that one.
2155.28s: Cedric says, did you see all the wrinkles of RC?
2164.28s: I don't know what that refers to. Confuses me.
2168.28s: Jimmy says, why are you always so thirsty?
2171.28s: It's because I intermittent fast.
2174.28s: So now is typically when I start feeding and consuming way more liquid.
2182.28s: So like throughout most of the day, I actually don't drink a ton.
2186.28s: I mean, I drink a lot of fluid, like always, because like I'm even though I have a fucked up back right now,
2193.28s: and have sciatic on all this bullshit, like I'm still as active as I possibly can be.
2197.28s: So I always make sure I'm hydrated.
2199.28s: Like there's never a good reason to be dehydrated.
2201.28s: So I do drink a lot for that.
2204.28s: But especially in the evenings, it picks up because what I end up doing is I stop consuming fluids
2212.28s: at around like 2100, like 9 p.m. my time to so like it's all got to be done by then.
2219.28s: So here's another sip.
2223.28s: The other thing when I'm doing live streams like this, and just kind of talking a lot, my mouth gets dry.
2229.28s: So it naturally benefits that as well.
2232.28s: Oh, interesting.
2234.28s: Jotato says RC tweeted a pick of his forehead.
2238.28s: That's hilarious.
2241.28s: It's very him. That sounds exactly, exactly right.
2245.28s: generational capital says you have a joke dope side job podcasting with your dog while making money all on stock all while in your boxers.
2253.28s: Yeah, that's that's kind of the idea.
2258.28s: Now, I think Thor is he's real tricky, you know, is like a value add.
2266.28s: I do try to like understand the work streams that he owns and what he delivers.
2271.28s: And sometimes it's hard to see, but it's kind of like you just have to accept the intellectual property that he provides and like the guidance.
2280.28s: You know, so yeah, I it's difficult to tie him down to like specific KPIs.
2285.28s: You got to let him just be a part that you just accept his value that way.
2292.28s: Santo says Eric, if the chart is not clear, do you still make a trade if the premium is good?
2297.28s: Oh, great question. Santo, show me show me what you're looking at.
2301.28s: And we can take a look at it together.
2304.28s: Because my guess is it might be more clear than we might think I find people in general just don't like to be decisive.
2315.28s: So yeah.
2318.28s: Native gamers says what's drinking too much?
2324.28s: What do you mean like consuming too much fluid?
2327.28s: It's really hard to do that. It's like really, really hard to do that.
2330.28s: You can get into what is that hyponotremia?
2332.28s: If you drink too much water, but like you had to drink a shit ton of water.
2336.28s: So that's like super hard to do.
2340.28s: But it's like I like I would wager that the average person is probably under hydrated.
2348.28s: Like that would be my under just base guess is dehydration is so easy for people that aren't thoughtful about what they're doing.
2358.28s: Okay.
2359.28s: If the chart is not clear.
2363.28s: Okay.
2370.28s: So let's talk about it.
2373.28s: Let's talk about let me see if I can find in my.
2380.28s: Abomination.
2383.28s: Here. No. Is this it? Yes. This is it. Beautiful. That's convenient.
2391.28s: Okay.
2394.28s: Reese says if you're annoyed by how often you pee, then you're dehydrated.
2400.28s: Well, you just look at the color of your urine. Like that's that's it, right? It should be straw color.
2405.28s: It shouldn't be clear. It shouldn't be dark yellow. Your urine should be straw color.
2409.28s: And if it's and that's not the urine that's in the bowl, that's the urine as it leaves the body for women.
2415.28s: I don't want to fucking tell you I don't know how that works for women. I don't know how y'all do it.
2419.28s: But I do know that for dudes you just look at the stream and then look at the color.
2426.28s: Because women it's a little more fucking complicated. I mean, that's that's kind of on brand for just the women bodily functions.
2433.28s: You gotta get a sit. You gotta fucking use paper towel or fucking toilet paper. So whole fucking thing sounds like a lot of work.
2443.28s: So when we're looking at this kind of opportunity, the thing that we have to start with is what's the basis for this trade.
2452.28s: So for santo while looking at Google walk me through walk me through the big for trade process as you see it.
2462.28s: Because again, my guess is it's probably more clear than you might think the problem is is people don't leverage these kinds of guidelines.
2471.28s: Both from a strategy perspective and a trade perspective. And these naturally back me into decisions.
2478.28s: Right. So for example, are we trying to fit a portfolio need that Google fits the portfolio really well somehow for some reason? Is that the case?
2488.28s: Or is it the case that Google just happened to cross across our path for whatever reason? And that's a completely other instance.
2499.28s: So santo, let me know which one of those it is and I'm going to take some more drugs.
2519.28s: Nothing from santo.
2521.28s: Okay, well then let's just take a look at this. Let's just say that there's no portfolio need. And let's say Google popped up on our radar for something.
2530.28s: Now, there's a few ways that I would look to trade something like this. This looks like it's a little bit range bound following this V bottom.
2543.28s: And if I look in a longer term time frame.
2547.28s: It's definitely trending up. I see a big volume node here.
2555.28s: And I see another volume node here.
2559.28s: Santo says Google chart the uptrend is on. I want to hold it for long. Not sure if I'd have time to initiate a covered call. Well, if it's a long term holding, then it doesn't really matter.
2574.28s: Right. Like the nature of investing in like buy and hold stuff for long term durations like multi year periods.
2584.28s: That's based way more on the expectation of the company to grow. That's like essentially what it boils down to.
2591.28s: If you're holding for something greater than a year, that's your trade thesis.
2595.28s: Is you think the company is going to grow? That's the only reason why the stock price would go up in that time frame.
2601.28s: It's the only thing that ultimately matters in that circumstance is price go up.
2608.28s: In that scenario, if it's a long term holding, then the way I would look at it is they doesn't actually matter that much.
2614.28s: What it's doing on a day to day basis provided that from a fundamental perspective, you believe that to be the case from your analysis that in a year from now, it will be worth more as a company than it is today.
2626.28s: So then the stock price would then match that value. That's how I think about that kind of thing.
2632.28s: So it's a good like it's a good differentiation, I suppose, but at least from my perspective, long term holdings are based so much more on fundamental components, not saying that you have to go in and do what most people think about with respect to fundamental analysis, like you don't have to in my opinion, you don't have to sit there and like go through.
2658.28s: And analyze all of the financial statements and stuff like that, like you could do that, you could choose to make your own discounted cash flow model, like you could do all that if you were so inclined, but I don't think there's an imperative to what I think is it comes down to just a like very high level, do I think this thing is going to be worth more in the future than it is today. That's how I would think about that.
2685.28s: Sam says the premiums are good for CSP, but again, middle of trend, would you initiate a CSP? So the last possible thing I would ever do is decide to buy stock from the perspective of a cash secured cash secured put or even a covered call like any of that.
2707.28s: Right, because you're telling me the thing I can tell you is that like it's not I already see like misalignment right so you're saying I want to hold it for long.
2718.28s: Okay, so then if you want to hold it for long, then what are we doing?
2723.28s: If you are worried about this short term trend because you want to hold it for long, then do you actually want to hold it for long?
2731.28s: My guess is probably not if that doesn't align. So I think in your case, the first thing actually would be reconciling those components because I don't think that those two ideas align at least from like a general analysis lens.
2747.28s: Just don't see it makes sense there. You want to hold it for long, then I would hold it if I don't want to hold it for long because I'm nervous about this short term trend, then don't hold it.
2758.28s: So.
2760.28s: Re says if a trade goes away with the CSP, you'll never own it. Yep. So that's another I have a couple videos that talk about the wheel and some of the big drawbacks of the wheel.
2771.28s: So this is actually pretty old at this point. I think I might have to refresh this video at some point that video.
2779.28s: But that's a massive drawback of the wheel. And that's actually why I think a big part of it comes down to just literally gaining exposure to the underlying itself.
2793.28s: If you want exposure to the underlying itself, and then if you don't want exposure for whatever reason, right, like it's in the middle of a trend, you're not convinced on what direction it's going to go. Then to me, it tells us a slightly different story.
2805.28s: It's not time to enter until it clearly defines what way it's going for your strategy and your timeframe. But yeah, I just see a little bit of a misalignment there as far as I can see.
2818.28s: Cool. So let's jump over now to this conversation I was having in the discord.
2826.28s: So this is with one of our discord members and essentially they were saying that they think they got out a little early on the MCL trade.
2836.28s: It hit a high of 7557, which would have been about four times the profit realized probably should have set up some sort of trailing stop.
2843.28s: Now, there's a bunch of things I want to highlight about this again from a broad perspective. This isn't to pick on anybody. This is to help people learn.
2853.28s: So the very first thing is I noticed the first mention of crude oil in this case earlier today.
2866.28s: Right. So this isn't something that was based on at least from what I saw.
2872.28s: Some sort of long term analysis that then led to a head where it's like, ah, now I have my entry. I didn't see that.
2882.28s: So this from the origin looked like an impulse trade. It looked like crude oil was moving. We wanted to participate in the move so that we got into crude oil.
2894.28s: That's the first thing. And I think that as an origin for a trade is a bad trade entry.
2901.28s: So when I think about when I'm placing a trade, whether a trade is good or bad does not tie to if it's profitable or not profitable.
2916.28s: A good trade can lose money. A bad trade can make money.
2921.28s: What makes a trade good or bad is the foundation for the trade itself. That is what is most important because if we don't do that, then we immediately over prioritize the outcome of an individual trade, which in the grand scheme of things does not matter.
2947.28s: It does not matter. Having one trade unless it's, you know, this biggest trade of your entire life. And then you never trade again. It's kind of like hitting it at the casino and then never going back.
2959.28s: Sure. That scenario. Okay. If that's the game plan that's still a plan, but it's kind of like hitting the lot of pretty low probability.
2966.28s: So for most of us that are trading based on systems, meaning the application of something over time, the outcome of an individual trade does not matter.
2976.28s: It should be nearly fully deprioritized. The parts that matter the absolute most are the conditions and the strategy in how that's managed.
2988.28s: The reason why that matters is because that's what leads to a replicable thing over time that you can then do again and again and again with some idea on outcome potential.
3003.28s: So in this case, we didn't even think about the trade ahead of time, right? And then when we get into the trade because it went further, then we're like, ah, shit, I should have done something else.
3016.28s: That's the exact opposite way that these should be done.
3023.28s: If we wanted to trade crude oil because it was moving cool trade crude oil because it's moving.
3029.28s: But we should have a defined strategy that we're using here, right? So for me, the profit mechanism for crude oil is breakout. That's again, it's literally one of the traits that I have on right now.
3040.28s: And I guess this is a good segue to talk a little bit about that first and then we'll talk about this CVS trade.
3047.28s: But for crude, I entered on 30 step in one oct. These are not my actual trade sizes. I reduce them down to the smallest component just for ease.
3059.28s: So the trade is not this size. The trade is quite a bit larger than this as it sits now.
3064.28s: So let's look at those two entries 30 step one oct. Why those two days? Let's go to crude oil.
3074.28s: And then let's go in to a three month. So 30 step is right here.
3084.28s: One oct is right here. Why these days?
3093.28s: A bunch of reasons. This was catching a falling knife. This was a prospecting entry on an expected eventual turnaround that was entirely based on the risk side of the equation.
3115.28s: I entered four for every one that I entered on the first of oct.
3122.28s: So the reason why I started with four here, even though this was obviously a speculative entry was entirely because I viewed the risk worth it.
3136.28s: I viewed it as a lower risk entry because what I care about is the downside, not how much I think I'm going to make.
3145.28s: I care about the risk side of the equation first. So then I say, OK, we had a little bit of a consolidation. We dipped down.
3155.28s: We had a massively strong by day here. We had a second day where it held the same level slightly, slightly falling below the close of the prior day, but we didn't continue this downtrend yet.
3170.28s: So when I entered here, was it in my mind that we're not going to continue this downtrend?
3176.28s: I have no idea. Literally have no idea. I view it as a probabilistic assessment.
3184.28s: So if I see something that's been in a big downtrend, I perceive a floor at some point with something like crude oil. It's a commodity.
3193.28s: Even if there's a lot of supply or other periods where there's a lot of demand, it's still a physical commodity that has to move.
3201.28s: So then I say to myself, OK, and this is before I entered the trade way before I entered the trade. I'd been watching crude for some time.
3209.28s: So as crude fell down here, I wanted to know how far is it going to go before it starts to grab a bite.
3216.28s: So I saw the next day I grabbed a bite. So then I was curious, OK, does it grab here and then fall right similar to this down down down grabbed then fell.
3227.28s: That does not mean that it couldn't fall just didn't hear. So then I create a probabilistic guess.
3235.28s: I say, OK, do I think it's more likely to start reversing here or my actual expectation was consolidation first. That's what I expected.
3246.28s: Do I think it's going to consolidate and then break one way or the other. That was my best guess.
3253.28s: But from a risk side of the equation, where do I view my downside risk? What like 65 here?
3264.28s: So then if I enter here with bulk size for what the exposure is that I want.
3276.28s: And I'm perceiving an initial floor something around here at 65. What do I think about that risk? How can I size this trade so that risk makes sense?
3286.28s: And then can I contextualize this low? So I'm only looking at three months. So then let me go out to six months. Where's the low?
3293.28s: I don't see anything here. I have to go out further. Where's the low on the year? I don't see anything here. I have to go out further.
3302.28s: Where do I see the low on three years? Interesting. I see the low that generally lines up over here.
3314.28s: So I created that initial guess on a floor. Then I had to zoom out to figure out if there's any reference point for this floor.
3324.28s: And I can see that it broke down here. I can see that it pop below here. But what do I notice about these periods?
3331.28s: This was a poke below. This was a poke below. If I go out to here, what do I notice? A poke below? A poke below? A poke below?
3342.28s: So I view this as essentially a three year floor. Again, does this mean crude oil can't fall through a three year floor? It can.
3353.28s: But what I can also look at is that it didn't hear. It didn't hear. It didn't hear. And it didn't hear.
3361.28s: So I'm okay taking the risk on that trade. As long as I size it appropriately, that is okay. This is a low risk entry for me.
3371.28s: Then if we get the breakout, this is why I started adding to the trade on the first. It's why I didn't wait until the second, the third or the fourth.
3382.28s: I saw this massive breakout start. So then it was time to enter with the rest of the position. And it's why I haven't added more into it because I'm at size. The trade is fully sized for what I have allocated to it.
3397.28s: So notice how I use different time frames. Notice how I use the thesis of a near term floor to gauge the potential risk in the trade.
3411.28s: Santos says Eric is that also not the car at low car.
3425.28s: I don't know what you mean by car.
3428.28s: But is that also not the car of low at 6527. Why didn't you initiate the position that day because it's still going lower.
3436.28s: There could have absolutely have been a potential entry here on the 11th, but that's still too early. So the only entry in this time frame that makes any sense for me is the 12th and I did trade the 12th, but I got stopped out here on that position.
3453.28s: So I took this small move. So now after stopped out here, it's essentially just wait and see because that's exactly what I'm going to do again. Again, you can see where my stops are. This is a little tight. It wouldn't be here. The stop would be something closer to this to let it go.
3471.28s: And somewhere between there is what I would take it down. So I would realize profit here.
3478.28s: Set another alert, above or below, and then let it go and then get back in if it starts to continue breaking up above.
3485.28s: So this case, I did trade here on the 12th. I had, I want to say I had some position on the 11th, but I don't think it was much.
3494.28s: I can double check because I don't remember.
3499.28s: Give me one second. But anyways, that part, I guess that part doesn't even matter. The part that matters is I did trade this move, but I just got stopped out.
3508.28s: So then I didn't reenter right away. I waited for another entry point is the idea there.
3517.28s: Corey says leaps no, I'm just trading futures. I purposely use MCL in this case.
3522.28s: And I talk about that in general, like I prefer the micros because you can get very specific with your sizing.
3528.28s: Right. Because if you're using the larger futures crude oil and stuff like that, my account size can definitely handle it.
3537.28s: But it's not so much whether or not the account size can handle it. I am very much a scaling trader.
3544.28s: I like to have the ability to move into and out of things.
3548.28s: So if you look at crude oil futures by themselves, they're relative or their notional exposures like 73 grand or 74 grand per future.
3558.28s: So in this case, typically, and a lot of times I'll do this with stuff like this. If I feel convicted, I would have started the entry with regular crude.
3571.28s: So forward slash CL. And then I would add additional via MCL to get exactly where I want to be as I'm scaling in.
3580.28s: But I did not have a ton of faith in this position.
3585.28s: So even as we were moving on the 30th, I was scaling in throughout the day on the 30th.
3591.28s: Because when I first started to enter, I started very light because I wanted to see if it was going to start breaking down because you can see this downwick that it had didn't know how far that was going to go.
3601.28s: So that's why in this case, I started with MCL right from the jump, even though the position would have been better suited for CL.
3607.28s: I could have done fewer contracts and I could have just done a handful of contracts to CL versus multiples of MCL.
3615.28s: But it didn't allow me to scale the way that I wanted to be able to scale to follow the price movement.
3621.28s: Because again, this was a very tentative entry. It had two big drops before starting to oscillate sideways just a little bit before catching a bite.
3630.28s: So San to let me know if that answers your question with respect to enter on the 25, the 65 27. I'm not trying to bottom dip, right?
3641.28s: I don't know if it's going to break down below that or not. But what I know in this instance is that it's moving that direction very strong.
3648.28s: So I'm not going to step in front of it. That's like the very standard bargain buying approach. I want to see how it behaves around those levels.
3655.28s: And then if it behaves, then again, in this case, I did trade this movement here because I like that move.
3662.28s: But one of the biggest things retail traders have to get out of the habit of doing is when we have something that is going down that we get into it with a long trade while it's still going down.
3678.28s: It's just it doesn't make sense, right? Like if you think about that in a really, really simple way, it kind of is like, yeah, okay, why would I buy something if it's going down?
3689.28s: It's completely logical to think of it that way, but a lot of people don't.
3693.28s: So yeah, that's the thought there. I have to call Mel really fast to get her to order her food because otherwise she's going to get left behind.
3704.28s: I think we're going to do boneless wings tonight.
3714.28s: Um, Joey says I was I was going to ask how you can hedge against an overnight gap risk. It's futures, man. I don't hedge.
3725.28s: One, I sized the trade appropriately to I just rest orders. That's that's why for stuff like commodities and it's why even for equities.
3739.28s: It's why I really like trading futures.
3744.28s: For instance, you're using patterns or more so candlesticks neither I don't use either heavily. I use candlesticks to analyze what the movement was, but I don't care if it's bearish engulfing, bullish engulfing like I don't really do any of those.
3761.28s: So I look at candlesticks to help me understand what the flavor was for the day. So for example, we can look at some near term stuff to give you ideas like this here.
3773.28s: So this big red candle, we opened, we had a little bit of a rally that died and got pushed all the way down.
3781.28s: And then we ended up essentially closing near the low of the day. That's a lot of selling pressure that causes that this is a different scenario where we have a battle where something wants to go higher enough.
3795.28s: Seller step in there like nope too high will take it down and then the same thing to the other side.
3801.28s: So that tells me that there's active participation from both buyers and sellers.
3806.28s: If I see these big blocky candles like this, it tells me that it's a one sided kind of day.
3813.28s: Joey says, what if it gaps past your resting order? Maybe I'm a little confused. Yeah, that's that's they trade 24 seven.
3820.28s: So like right now it could get they don't trade 24 seven. I'm sorry, that's hyperbole.
3825.28s: They trade near 24 seven. So futures are closed right now and then they'll open Sunday.
3830.28s: So there could be gap risk from now to Sunday and that's always handled via sizing the trade logically.
3837.28s: But the standard throughout the week is there is they trade after hours. They'll close for a little bit and then they'll open back up.
3848.28s: And then all night they trade that's why you guys will see me in the discord sometimes post trades at 11 o'clock at night before I go to bed.
3855.28s: I'll be tweaking a few things before I crash out.
3860.28s: So yeah, the gap risk is only when futures are closed, which is a small window, essentially now.
3866.28s: And the gap risk there is managed just like the gap risk is managed in literally everything else we trade size size the trade correctly.
3874.28s: And you have something set up way too big and you're not ready for a larger move one way or the other than your fact.
3882.28s: So that's always first line of defense.
3889.28s: Cool. So anyways, that's that trade, which we can skip over now. And then so the last thing though that I want to where is this other thing here.
3900.28s: So the last thing that I want to highlight from this is before we start trading something, we have we have to understand what we're trying to trade and then trade a system around it.
3917.28s: Have to know if ands or butts about it.
3922.28s: So the idea of putting something on and then being upset because when we could have made more money, it tells me we didn't analyze well and it tells me that we were just kind of doing things on the fly.
3936.28s: Right now in comparison, the trade that I have on at this point, you can already see what my approaches for managing it.
3946.28s: You can literally see all these different levels that I set as it moves up that I would start either pairing the position down or take the whole thing down and it's really context dependent.
3957.28s: I don't decide that ahead of time.
3959.28s: But for something like this, as I'm entering, I already know what I'm doing.
3963.28s: If it goes down, I'm resting the order hits the order done out until it starts to behave. Then I might get back in depending on how it's moving.
3972.28s: If that doesn't happen and it starts to rally, then I'm going to watch the rally.
3978.28s: So there will be periods where it'll hit a stop point, but I don't man, I don't automatically exit, right?
3985.28s: Because I always talk to people about the idea of using two stops. I have a mental stop, then I have a hard stop for something like this.
3991.28s: A lot of times I'll rest the hard stop.
3993.28s: But for the mental stop, I want to see the movement about the level so that I can understand if I think it's actually starting to move through or is it just a slight extension over a specific price level.
4007.28s: So.
4011.28s: Santos says futures not a staple for beginners. I am assuming. Yeah.
4017.28s: Futures, if it's like equity futures, then it's fine. Right. So if you're trading something like crude oil or corn or hogs or soybeans.
4028.28s: Stuff like that has a really different nuance to it that you have to understand some of the production cycles. I think.
4036.28s: So that you're not at like a pretty significant information disadvantage. But besides those.
4044.28s: Like if you're trading equities via futures, then I honestly, I think you're kind of, I think you're kind of fine.
4052.28s: You just have to monitor sizing, but it's essentially just like buying that's actually one of my preferred aspects about futures. It's why I use them for drift exposure.
4063.28s: Is because even back when I would trade the coverage strangle a lot in I WM for long term holding that was a core approach of what I did simply because I WM doesn't expire.
4075.28s: And as I'm working and as I'm doing things like active duty in the Marine Corps and all that kind of stuff, like I don't have time to, you know, make sure that at this exact point where it's the optimal role for my futures to try to minimize carry.
4088.28s: Then I'll use that as the base, but I'll still trade futures during those periods when things are trending.
4094.28s: And then I'll come out of them, you know, when I can't monitor them more closely. So for something like futures products, they offer you delta one exposure to something.
4107.28s: And options give you leveraged exposure, but there's a lot of nuance with options, right? We have things like theta decay and all the all the Greeks that come along with non delta one products derivatives in that case break out into two components, right?
4124.28s: So we have options and futures up. Well, there's more than that, by the way, but those are the two that most retail will be concerned with.
4130.28s: And options have their tool in the toolkit, but they also add a lot of other components because of how they're constructed as a derivative futures are slightly different because futures are delta one products.
4142.28s: So you can trade them just as a delta one. So if I want to be long spy I WM Russell, my preference would be to go into futures and do it because I gain the leverage that I would in options.
4153.28s: I don't have the same complexity around options and more importantly, they still give me good tax treatment. That's a massive part of these.
4161.28s: So if I'm trading things like spy I WM QQQ QLD, triple Q's SSO, all of those different kinds of ETFs, they're not section 1256 tax code.
4175.28s: So I'm going to get hit at my tax rate, which is bad. The highest tax rate I can have. So I lose a lot of money to taxes.
4184.28s: So if I trade something like the indices themselves, SPX, XSP, RUT, those kinds of products, they give you section 1256 tax code, but you can't buy and hold SPX.
4199.28s: There is no SPX to hold. It's a cat. It's literally just an index. So then the next best place futures because futures give you delta one, they give you leverage, they give you section 1256.
4214.28s: Now there's downside to futures, not all that glitters is gold. So futures they you're going to pay carry more often than not. And it's because there's a convenience offer to it.
4225.28s: And they're also way, way, way more expensive in terms of commissions than something like options, which is how it goes. So yeah, it's all a game of finding the stuff that fits best. But yeah, for me, futures are a big part of the overall portfolio for those reasons.
4244.28s: Joyce says, did you negotiate futures commissions? You know the answer to that is yes, I negotiate everything 100 100%.
4252.28s: Joyce says, do you usually do you generally use defined resistance or percentages of stop I essentially never use percentage. I don't care about a percentage of stop.
4261.28s: I care about where I define support and resistance. So I have a video that I put out not too long ago. Let me see if I can find it.
4277.28s: No, don't remember where it is.
4282.28s: There's a video about risk, I think.
4288.28s: Yeah, I think this one.
4292.28s: There you go.
4295.28s: The video, it talks about essentially the process that I'll use to manage risk in trades. But the way I look at percentages is they're completely arbitrary. It doesn't mean anything to me if a stock drops 6% 8% 12% 2%
4311.28s: like that that's it's secondary. What I care about is where do I think something might trade to without going through and then move back up and out.
4322.28s: Now I have to make sure that whatever that is as defined still makes sense. So what that means is let's say for example, I wanted to enter crude oil here.
4332.28s: But if I look at crude oils entry here, I can see that essentially it's traded below these levels, right, very near term. It was below below this 67 handle here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.
4348.28s: So there's a lot of recent instances where crude dropped below that near term support. So then I have to set up wherever I would consider support to be where it is. I already walk through that whole process why I set it up about where it is around 65.
4364.28s: So then my entry is as a completely different shape because my entry now is at 74 with the expected support down at 65 as compared to entry at 68 with expected support at 65.
4383.28s: So entries here can be done, but then they have to be sized completely differently. The size that I pick for a trade in terms of overall risk has to make sense based on what these relationships look like.
4396.28s: So for example, this trade here, I was able to size up way more because I view near term support as it is. So it gives me essentially again a lower risk entry.
4408.28s: Whereas if I wait to enter until here, I can't go at the same size because if I'm using the same support level, it's a much bigger drop to get there.
4418.28s: So they have to marry with one another so that it makes sense. It's a good question.
4427.28s: Santo says, when you enter the order for futures, do you also enter exit orders? The ones in soft stops. Is it already like entered together? You just play it out? What kind of proportion? No.
4441.28s: So if I'm trading something soft spot soft stop is not going to be entered that's almost always a mental stop for me to review. I very often will exit on a soft stop.
4452.28s: But yeah, that's just a mental exit. And then or hard stops there either entered or I'm just going to exit when they hit there. It depends on if I'm around the computer or not.
4466.28s: So if I'm going to be out moving around and I wouldn't be able to monitor get on my phone real fast if it's triggered, then I would go in and enter it. But otherwise, I would rest it now. There is a big difference though, because if I'm resting a hard stop, I'm already giving it a lot of room to move essentially the grace that I would give it somewhere else. So for example, a soft stop here for this example would look at something like below the 66.
4496.28s: That would be a soft stop for me again using these entry days as the example.
4501.28s: And the reason why it's a soft stop is because I would want to see how it behaves as it penetrates below those levels. But it's gone down below those levels a couple times and is siphoned back up.
4514.28s: So I wouldn't want to rest in order there because that becomes an unnecessary stop. So that's why soft stop in this case is mental.
4522.28s: The hard stop is entered below that level. And then I typically give it a little extra room so that it is an undeniable move that would stop me out in the equation. So I do not rest orders on the soft stops hard stops a little bit different.
4542.28s: If I'm resting in order on a hard stop, then it needs to be essentially completely outside of where the acceptable range would be.
4554.28s: James says futures are nastily the same as as any equity, but you need to understand how points works. So you don't get caught off guard with how fast they move in dollars. Yeah, definitely.
4568.28s: So futures they they move in points and ticks. They don't move in dollars.
4573.28s: So like as we look at crude oil, this technically is not $74.45 because the multiplier in something like these different futures are different. So like if we use for slash ES.
4587.28s: This is not 57 95 50. The first thing you'll notice that it only moves in 25 tick increments.
4597.28s: So the only price that this can be is 95 50 95 75 95 25. So on and so forth.
4607.28s: It can't be 95 55. It doesn't move in that increment. So the tick is the smallest size that it'll move in this case. It's 25 0.25.
4617.28s: You can call it 25 cents if that's just easier to wrap the head around. But the value of that tick is different. So every time that this moves this 95 50.
4629.28s: If this goes from 95 50 to 95 75 that represents one tick, which is 0.25. That's the move.
4639.28s: But the value of that is $12.50. So if this moves by that quarter, the PNL moves by 12.50.
4650.28s: So essentially it's just like anything else with options, how you have to remember to like move the decimal and stuff. You just do the same show with futures. You can have like a reference for yourself.
4659.28s: That's you know easy to look at until you memorize most of the stuff that you're trading. But yeah, that's exactly how it works. It's not linear.
4669.28s: I the futures markets are fascinating because I genuinely I feel like the financial systems very often are set up like to make it more difficult to enter. I really do believe that it's like why the fuck does it have to be this confusing. I don't see like a big value.
4687.28s: Of course, says what's your strategy when taking profit. Do you have profit targets when you enter a trader's assesses you go both do both.
4696.28s: The reason is the way that I manage profits in a trade depends entirely on these details.
4706.28s: It matters entirely on what the strategy is built around and then how I trade that strategy. So for example, if I'm trading something like short puts.
4717.28s: I have a different rules set that I'll follow in terms of taking profits as compared to if I'm trading something like ratio called diagonals. They're very, very different in terms of how they behave, how they work.
4729.28s: So if we have a ticker. I'm going to go into scan and I'm going to pick a random ticker. I just want to look at something I don't look at a lot. Perfect. Quad sees.
4747.28s: This kind of looks interesting to the downside.
4752.28s: This would be I'm setting a couple alerts is this actually looks interesting to the downside.
4763.28s: So let's just say I wanted to sell puts in here. I don't but let's use it as an example again. I just want to look at something I don't look at a lot.
4774.28s: So let's say that actually let's go into paper trading and then let's go back here. So we're going to trade a favorable period in here. So this is 15.
4787.28s: Ogg 26 let's go to 15.
4798.28s: Here we go 15 on beautiful.
4803.28s: And let's say that the idea here is again we're bullish for whatever reason. I'm overfitting. I'm looking at a period that I know how it works just because I want to show an example.
4817.28s: Corey says what the fuck are those volume notes it's exactly at their volume notes. So volume profile essentially plots where things trade at price levels.
4827.28s: So it essentially takes all of the volume that you see down here. It turns it on its side and it doesn't care anymore. It's not based on a time series. So it's not based on date.
4839.28s: The volume here is based simply at where it's transacted at.
4846.28s: So let's oh I see what you mean sorry you're asking like what what were the I see sorry I thought you were asking like what the what the indicator was my bad.
4860.28s: Okay cool yeah so this is all loaded up we can look.
4866.28s: So we're going to go to the next one.
4869.28s: We guys think this is 49 and a half this feels okay feel like I'm a little less slouching like this this feels better.
4881.28s: Let's take a look at two things.
4885.28s: Again I don't care how liquid it is and stuff I'm just going to force a trade on so we can look at the example.
4894.28s: Let's take a look at the perfect the 36 DTE.
4902.28s: Now for me I literally have a matrix setup based on DTE.
4910.28s: Dazed expiration from entry so I also track DIT days in trade.
4918.28s: And I created a matrix based on a broad data set that I manage and I literally just look at it as it's kind of like a directions at this point.
4931.28s: And the way it works is based on whatever DTE I have via entry so this case 36 DTE is the entry based on X numbers of days in trade I then accept different amounts of percent max gain because these are again defined profit the way I manage to find profit trade is completely different than the way that I would manage undefined profit because again let's take a look at this example.
4960.28s: So this is 36 days to go.
4970.28s: I'm curious if it's going to plot it for us that would be great if it did.
4978.28s: Right now it shows me as pre buffering which I always have an issue with that what the fuck is pre buffering could we not just say buffering feel like that's the same thing.
4988.28s: Okay so it's not showing it which is okay it doesn't matter let's see if it shows it if I trade it though.
4997.28s: Okay let's see if I can just get filled at the natural.
5005.28s: Maybe try running it.
5010.28s: Let's just do a market order.
5013.28s: Okay no feel whatever it doesn't matter.
5018.28s: We'll just cancel it and we'll leave it here.
5021.28s: You all know what a short put looks like in here right.
5024.28s: I don't know if there's like I forgot I think I had a thing at one point where I could draw on the screen.
5030.28s: I think I might have got rid of it but you all know what a short put looks like in here right.
5045.28s: Yeah I imagine I was just trying to see if I could find real quick the.
5051.28s: Like a program so I could draw on the screen might be easier.
5059.28s: I have whatever.
5062.28s: Just show you here super fast for those that don't know that might be too nervous to speak up for some reason.
5069.28s: This is what it looks like.
5074.28s: So here's you know here's time for I'm sorry price.
5084.28s: So it'll have a point and this should be flat.
5087.28s: But it'll have a point where you're at max profit is up here.
5092.28s: So then this would be at expiration.
5096.28s: And then before expiration it would look like this.
5104.28s: So then as time passes this line approximates to that line.
5111.28s: That's what that tells us.
5114.28s: Okay so now let's go back to the example that my artwork is complete.
5120.28s: I think it's I feel like that's really well drawn personally.
5124.28s: I'll just take credit for it.
5126.28s: And we have this trade on now.
5130.28s: And let's fast forward time.
5133.28s: Let's put on another trade while we're at it just for an example.
5139.28s: That's a good question.
5142.28s: Let's pretend we're bullish.
5144.28s: Let's not worry about if we actually are not.
5147.28s: Let's pretend we're bullish.
5149.28s: What expiration do we choose here 64 or 55.
5159.28s: Also fun fact.
5160.28s: I just got the new iPhone.
5163.28s: And so far it's good I like it.
5165.28s: But I learned that they put like this coding on it.
5168.28s: That makes it very difficult to like slide your thumb.
5171.28s: And I like to use the swipe text thing.
5174.28s: So yeah, I don't know.
5177.28s: There's any moral to that story, but just so you know.
5183.28s: All right so for this.
5186.28s: For me it's between these two 64 and 155.
5190.28s: I actually would prefer something around like 90.
5193.28s: I would like to go to as of late bringing it further and further in time.
5197.28s: Just as markets move.
5199.28s: So we'll grab this 64 for now because theta on them is so light.
5204.28s: Anyways because it's so cheap.
5207.28s: We can go deep in the money here.
5209.28s: And we'll just pretend that we buy one.
5211.28s: Oh, that shows up.
5213.28s: But that doesn't what a hater what a hater.
5218.28s: That's kind of fun.
5219.28s: How it's all squiggly to.
5220.28s: All right, let's fast forward time.
5222.28s: So we're going to go forward two days.
5225.28s: For the example.
5228.28s: So it starts moving up as expected.
5233.28s: So in our scenario, we started entering here, I think.
5240.28s: I think we picked one of these days and it's starting to move up.
5243.28s: Now let's take a look at the options specifically.
5248.28s: What we sold.
5251.28s: Here's the option that we sold.
5254.28s: So move a couple days.
5256.28s: The option that we sold is about the same right.
5259.28s: We sold it for 50 cents.
5260.28s: It's trading for actually a little bit more even though it moved in our favor,
5264.28s: which is super annoying that happens sometimes because of volatility.
5267.28s: But then let's fast forward a few more days.
5269.28s: We go forward four more days.
5271.28s: What it does.
5274.28s: So now we have 28 DTE on our short puts.
5280.28s: Let's see what they're trading for now.
5291.28s: We're just working through the good old free buffering.
5294.28s: There it goes.
5297.28s: So now there were even more, which is super annoying.
5303.28s: But we've had a couple down days.
5305.28s: This is just telling us volatility is expanding.
5307.28s: That's exactly why that's happening.
5308.28s: So it's an interesting example.
5311.28s: But if we take a look at the call side though, those are making money.
5314.28s: So the calls we paid $2.5 and they're up 32 bucks right now.
5321.28s: So that's pretty that's pretty fun.
5326.28s: Now let's move time forward a bit more.
5329.28s: I'm going to go with a bigger adjustment.
5331.28s: We'll go to like the 30th maybe.
5334.28s: Did I fuck the date up?
5336.28s: I thought it had like this big rally.
5339.28s: What is this 26?
5340.28s: Let's see what it looked like on the 26th.
5346.28s: What I'm hoping to show you is based on different price move.
5352.28s: Oh, maybe we'll just go back and trade this one.
5354.28s: This is way better of an example.
5356.28s: Let's go back to nine July.
5358.28s: Yeah.
5359.28s: Okay, let's do that.
5360.28s: This will go way faster.
5363.28s: So we're going to go back to nine July is right here.
5367.28s: What I'm trying to show you is that depending on how the underlying is moving,
5372.28s: that should and will inform what makes sense in terms of profit taking.
5377.28s: So this goes all the way back to Corey's question.
5380.28s: It's just slow going as it sits now.
5387.28s: Let's see what this loads us in that.
5392.28s: I'll be able to fast forward it way more.
5412.28s: So now this has 16 aug so 38 days in 101.
5417.28s: So something like that again, we're just going to pretend that these are liquid.
5420.28s: So looking at these, we would sell them for 25 cents.
5425.28s: And it is a 38 day trade.
5429.28s: So let's analyze that.
5430.28s: I'm going to kill these other ones super fast just to keep the example simple.
5436.28s: And then let's fast forward now to like the 18th.
5440.28s: So remember, it's a 38 day trade.
5443.28s: And I'm going to go to the 16th actually.
5446.28s: 28 day trade.
5451.28s: So now if we go into the trade tab again, we would have sold them for 25.
5456.28s: I'm just using the midpoint between the bit and the ask I don't know how well these are going to adjust because they're so strange and illiquid.
5464.28s: But we'll see.
5465.28s: I think the example is still work.
5467.28s: Okay.
5469.28s: And in the meantime, actually, I can get my I can get my drawing on.
5479.28s: I'm going to skip the CVS trade for now.
5484.28s: Just so that we can take a look at some of the other AMA questions and stuff.
5488.28s: I'm hoping to get through most of those.
5491.28s: Okay.
5492.28s: So we sold to open for 0.50.
5497.28s: And this was 38.
5500.28s: D.
5502.28s: Cool.
5505.28s: Now, let's call it 37 cents.
5510.28s: It wouldn't be 37.
5511.28s: So you know this.
5512.28s: So this is just a artifact of this thing being like super, super liquid.
5517.28s: This is exactly what I get.
5519.28s: For picking something I don't know.
5522.28s: Amon.
5524.28s: Okay.
5527.28s: I'm going to find something better for the example.
5530.28s: Sorry.
5531.28s: I wanted to explore the space.
5533.28s: This will work just fine.
5534.28s: So let's do this is great.
5536.28s: Let's do Tesla 26.
5539.28s: June.
5545.28s: Yeah, this is perfect.
5547.28s: This will prove the same idea.
5555.28s: 26.
5557.28s: So actually before I before we go through the example though, what are you expecting to see?
5562.28s: Like as you hear me kind of loosely talking about this concept, what do you what do you expect?
5569.28s: Any good scientist should have some ideas hypothesis as it were.
5576.28s: So let's do this.
5582.28s: About what you might expect to see from an experiment, which is what we're doing.
5585.28s: We're experimenting right now.
5587.28s: So what do you expect?
5589.28s: Perfect.
5590.28s: So let's do this 51 DTE.
5592.28s: This is ideal.
5595.28s: And this is great.
5596.28s: So let's say we sell these 170s.
5598.28s: Perfect.
5599.28s: We get 510.
5601.28s: So 51 DTE.
5605.28s: We're going to sell the 170s.
5611.28s: At 510.
5614.28s: Cool.
5619.28s: Reese says I had a cook dinner and I got lost.
5621.28s: So I'm not expected shit.
5622.28s: That's perfect.
5623.28s: It's like a jack in the box.
5624.28s: You'll just expect a surprise then.
5626.28s: So before I show you the answer though, I'm actually like I genuinely am very curious.
5630.28s: Let's let's talk about what we think might happen.
5633.28s: I showed you already what the PNL graph looks like.
5640.28s: Right.
5641.28s: So if we have PNL.
5644.28s: And then we have stock price.
5646.28s: We know it goes like this.
5648.28s: This, then this.
5650.28s: Try to make it a little more level.
5652.28s: I don't know what it is about that motion.
5654.28s: That's destroying me.
5655.28s: But there.
5656.28s: And we know that before expiration.
5662.28s: It looks like this.
5663.28s: And then let's just call spot price here.
5667.28s: Like this.
5669.28s: Okay.
5670.28s: So in this context.
5673.28s: We know that as time passes.
5676.28s: This line goes to this line.
5678.28s: Now we also know that our PNL increases like this.
5686.28s: As the stock price moves this way.
5689.28s: Right.
5690.28s: So if current price in this case, I didn't even look at what Tesla was in the example.
5694.28s: I have no idea.
5695.28s: But let's pretend that now.
5699.28s: When we get this next view.
5702.28s: It will be here.
5705.28s: So do you notice how the PNL from your short put is not just the passage of time.
5711.28s: But if you get an accommodating price move like this.
5715.28s: You can realize more money faster.
5718.28s: So then we have to think about the logistics of this.
5721.28s: So is at 170 and stock was at 193.
5725.28s: So now let's fast forward.
5727.28s: Let's just go to the fifth.
5730.28s: Of the following month.
5732.28s: July.
5734.28s: Should be a big move up.
5736.28s: There it is.
5737.28s: I'm actually going to go back one day just to remove any instance of volatility.
5742.28s: Which would be the third.
5745.28s: It was close on the fourth.
5750.28s: Joey says we should be close to the max profit with a lot of time left in the trade so we can take it down faster.
5755.28s: There we go.
5756.28s: So now we're starting to think perfect.
5758.28s: That's exactly on target.
5760.28s: So for somebody else in the chat.
5762.28s: Corey or Lauren since I've seen both of your names fairly recently.
5767.28s: Do you understand what Joey just said?
5770.28s: The reason why I'm asking this is because this concept is so important.
5774.28s: And this concept that we're going through from a premium selling perspective is exactly why the idea of profits profit or you don't go broke taking profits.
5785.28s: Doesn't make sense in trading.
5787.28s: It literally doesn't make sense in trading.
5789.28s: It's a terrible adage that does not relate well to trading.
5796.28s: It's completely broken.
5798.28s: So Lauren says that she's on target with us.
5803.28s: Okay.
5805.28s: So now.
5807.28s: Let's take a look at our position.
5809.28s: It's worth one 17 and it's three July.
5813.28s: So we now have 44 DTE.
5821.28s: The same position is now at one 17.
5828.28s: So what do we think?
5835.28s: What's happened here?
5837.28s: Well, let's just do a little bit of math.
5839.28s: And before I show you how to do the math.
5842.28s: You tell me what math do you think we should do?
5845.28s: Again, this is a hopefully an interactive learning experience versus dictatorial.
5850.28s: So I want the brains working.
5853.28s: So we fast forward at time.
5856.28s: Right.
5857.28s: So that's pretty easy.
5858.28s: And in this case, we literally just went about a week.
5862.28s: Right.
5863.28s: So this to this.
5865.28s: Is the passage of one week seven days.
5868.28s: So I'm actually going to move that down here.
5870.28s: So this is seven days in trade.
5875.28s: And trade it.
5880.28s: Joey asked what's the intrinsic value of the option?
5882.28s: There is none.
5885.28s: So now.
5887.28s: In this case, we're seven days in the trade.
5890.28s: Our option is going to be showing a profit.
5893.28s: So we have five, ten, less the one 17.
5898.28s: Three, ninety three.
5900.28s: So we have one 17 left to go.
5903.28s: We have three, ninety three in the bag.
5910.28s: So in this case, this is one 17.
5915.28s: This is three, ninety three.
5916.28s: And this is one of the biggest problems people who sell premium will run into their entire
5920.28s: trading careers because they are going to fuck this up every single time.
5924.28s: Almost guaranteed.
5926.28s: Because the impulse here, what's the impulse?
5929.28s: You tell me.
5931.28s: So as we look at this right now, what's the impulse?
5949.28s: Take some profit.
5951.28s: Kong says roll interesting.
5953.28s: Joey says let it ride to eat out more.
5955.28s: Okay.
5956.28s: So actually, this is perfect time for a pull.
5958.28s: Because I already see different answers.
5961.28s: So let's take a look at our Tesla trade, Tesla trade.
5966.28s: 44, we have seven debt seven days in trade.
5971.28s: We made one 17 or no, we have one 17 remaining.
5977.28s: Made.
5980.28s: Three, ninety three.
5984.28s: Seven days in trade of 51, ETE.
5995.28s: Take trade down.
5998.28s: Let trade go.
6001.28s: And for this case, it's a one lot.
6003.28s: So there is no take some profit.
6005.28s: I'm just removing that for simplicity.
6007.28s: There is no choice to take some of it down because we've sold one.
6013.28s: So let's see what the answers are.
6016.28s: I'm actually very eager to see these responses.
6021.28s: Because from the first few, I actually already saw like some differences that I didn't expect.
6031.28s: So right now we're 60 40 split with five votes.
6034.28s: We need a couple more people to vote.
6036.28s: There's 41 outliers here, 42.
6040.28s: Somebody just joined.
6041.28s: And we're going to be able to vote for the next one.
6044.28s: So let's see if we can get.
6045.28s: Ideally, I would love 15 responses.
6047.28s: 15 is again, that's like a statistically significant number for the for the stats brand people.
6054.28s: So we're almost there.
6055.28s: We got nine.
6056.28s: We're still hovering about split, which is fascinating.
6061.28s: And just five more.
6066.28s: We're literally 50 50 split.
6068.28s: That's crazy.
6070.28s: This is.
6073.28s: This is crazy.
6075.28s: Like everything about this is different than I holistically would expect.
6088.28s: Two more votes, please.
6090.28s: And then we will move on.
6099.28s: 13.
6101.28s: We have 62% say take it down.
6104.28s: 38% say let it go.
6113.28s: I'd rather be skiing said I voted.
6115.28s: Thank you for clearing your name.
6117.28s: We have 14 just one more.
6119.28s: One more voter, please.
6121.28s: And then we have our statistically viable sample.
6124.28s: Thank you, whoever number 15 is.
6125.28s: You're the real homie.
6127.28s: Okay.
6130.28s: 60 40 split.
6132.28s: And the 60 40 split is.
6135.28s: I didn't expect it to be that tight at all.
6138.28s: I think somebody voted literally at the last second as I was closing it.
6141.28s: Yeah, so there was 16 votes.
6143.28s: 62 37.
6144.28s: Great.
6145.28s: Great split.
6146.28s: Not expected remotely.
6149.28s: So let me grab.
6152.28s: This really fast.
6153.28s: And let's take a look at this.
6176.28s: What I'm showing you is a study that I cite all the time called the behavior of individual investors.
6180.28s: You can look it up at your own leisure.
6183.28s: And the chat essentially identified the same disposition effect where we tend to like selling winning investments.
6191.28s: Right.
6192.28s: So my expectation from that exercise was that the vast majority of people were going to like I didn't even think it was going to be that close.
6199.28s: I thought it was going to be almost across the board.
6201.28s: Everybody would just say take it down.
6203.28s: Take the money and move because that is the general impulse people would have.
6208.28s: Now.
6210.28s: Let's let's talk about the details here though.
6213.28s: Originally.
6216.28s: We stood to make five ten.
6220.28s: We've now made three ninety three.
6223.28s: We have one seventeen left to go.
6225.28s: We now have forty four days left to go.
6228.28s: So how can we.
6230.28s: How can we conceptualize this?
6232.28s: Even without a model.
6235.28s: We can understand what's optimal.
6238.28s: What's a way that we can conceptualize this?
6241.28s: How can we make this make sense?
6244.28s: Because if we think about the situation we have on hand.
6248.28s: We've made three hundred and ninety three dollars.
6252.28s: We have the ability to make another one hundred and seventeen dollars.
6256.28s: However, we have forty four days left to go for that to happen.
6262.28s: We've made a good bulk of the profit.
6266.28s: Tommy says if trading plan says take down at eighty on short put trading to the upside would have to wait.
6273.28s: And what I'm working through with you now is how do we build something in a trading plan that makes sense?
6280.28s: So in this case we're at three ninety three of five ten.
6287.28s: So we're at seventy seven percent seventy seven point one percent max profit.
6294.28s: Seventy seven point one percent max.
6301.28s: Joey says forty four days is a lot of time for a trade to reverse two.
6306.28s: It is and this is exactly why it is such a tricky prospect because I'd rather be skiing highlights the other side of that.
6313.28s: It could keep going.
6316.28s: So then how do we analyze this?
6318.28s: How do we come up with the response that makes logical sense because both what Joey says and I'd rather be skiing say absolutely matter because guess what there's another two factors that we have to consider.
6332.28s: The first factor is what was the probability in this case I don't remember what the delta was I think it was what like.
6343.28s: Let's just call it a thirty delta I don't think it was I think it was a little less let's just call it a thirty delta.
6350.28s: And then here we can take a look at the delta of the option really quick.
6357.28s: It's a five delta.
6367.28s: So the probability of this trade working out meaning probability of being out of the money is like seventy percent.
6375.28s: Now the probability of this trade working out is like ninety five percent.
6379.28s: So what's happened well we've made a bunch of money in seven days.
6385.28s: Right we have three hundred ninety three dollars here that we've made in seven days.
6391.28s: We only have one seventeen left to go most traders look at this and say no brainer we've made the bulk of the profit in very little time take the trade down make the money and then move on to the next.
6407.28s: The issue with that is your probability in the trade has just increased massively you've got a twenty five percent bump there's a ninety five percent chance now.
6420.28s: That you make this remaining one seventeen.
6423.28s: What's the downside well it's a five delta.
6428.28s: So now this one seventeen without price movement is going to be slow.
6438.28s: Because if we think of theta now since it's further out of the money let's take a look if we go back to where we entered the trade for the example which I think was the twenty six.
6451.28s: Here was about a week.
6454.28s: Oh it was a week.
6456.28s: I mean it is.
6458.28s: It was a twenty two delta.
6461.28s: So now if we go back here what's our theta on the one seventy six cents.
6473.28s: So our theta is contracted pretty meaningfully forty percent.
6479.28s: So per day you now make less money.
6485.28s: White the conundrum.
6487.28s: So what's the right answer is the right answer to take the trade down is the right answer to let the trade go.
6499.28s: So now I'm going to do the poll one more time.
6515.28s: Okay.
6521.28s: So now you have a couple of other factors to consider.
6525.28s: You have the factor of probability being integrated.
6529.28s: You have the factor of theta slowing down.
6532.28s: Those are two of the big changes that have happened here.
6535.28s: You have the factor of you have less money that you can make on the residual time remaining.
6541.28s: So let's see what the choices are.
6544.28s: Now what I like to do is actually first start by taking that five ten and then divide that by fifty one.
6552.28s: Obviously your theta in that case again would have been ten dollars a day.
6556.28s: We already know that from what we looked at before.
6558.28s: So we have in this case.
6563.28s: Ten dollars a day in theta now we have six dollars a day in theta.
6573.28s: Tommy is looking at a good part, a good answer.
6577.28s: I think Tommy says maybe there's a better place for my money now.
6580.28s: So we start.
6581.28s: That's a consideration.
6582.28s: We need two more votes.
6584.28s: So we have forty six percent.
6586.28s: We're literally split fifty fifty now.
6591.28s: There we go.
6592.28s: We have our sixteen votes.
6593.28s: Thank you guys very, very much for voting.
6597.28s: And so we have fifty six that take it down.
6600.28s: We have forty three percent that let it go.
6602.28s: Here's the correct answer.
6604.28s: It depends.
6606.28s: The answer entirely depends on the way that you trade this strategy.
6613.28s: It depends in its entirety.
6617.28s: Why would it depend?
6626.28s: Why would this depend?
6632.28s: Because the people that said that they would take it down are not wrong.
6635.28s: And the people that said that they would leave it on are not wrong.
6638.28s: Literally not wrong in either scenario.
6641.28s: Both of those scenarios are completely completely fine.
6647.28s: Ray says you rascal.
6649.28s: Yep.
6650.28s: You had to know that that was coming.
6652.28s: I don't think I said depends yet in this whole thing.
6656.28s: The reason why it depends is because expected return.
6662.28s: Do you guys remember the conversation about expected return?
6666.28s: And kind of how it works.
6668.28s: First let me throw a video in here for you and then we'll look at an example together really fast.
6681.28s: Ah, this is the video that I wanted to show you.
6684.28s: There it is.
6687.28s: Perfect.
6689.28s: So we have to value expected return.
6695.28s: Which, oh yeah, I forgot.
6697.28s: We built a little calculator together.
6699.28s: We did this as a group.
6701.28s: Tell us.
6709.28s: Okay.
6714.28s: Oh, I don't know what we did with it.
6718.28s: I don't know all that is.
6721.28s: This is all old Eric's that what the fuck is this?
6725.28s: This was some sort of example that we did.
6728.28s: Oh, this was looking at that strategy from that dude.
6731.28s: Okay, got it.
6732.28s: I was just trying to figure out what the fuck I was looking at.
6736.28s: So let's take a look.
6739.28s: We start this equation where our profit is 510.
6747.28s: The probability of profit in this case was 88% because I remember it was a 22 delta.
6754.28s: And then if we're not managing the loss, let's figure out what the loss would have been.
6759.28s: We'll just ballpark.
6762.28s: Let's say we got in on the 16th.
6766.28s: For the 26th, my bad.
6768.28s: Let's say that our exit was going to be at 165.
6782.28s: I don't think it shows the short.
6786.28s: So I'm just going to have to do like the synthetic thing that I do.
6789.28s: I'm just going to have to do like the first.
6792.28s: You'll just have to bear with me for a second.
6795.28s: So let me go back.
6799.28s: To the 26th.
6803.28s: This is going to move up and then essentially we have to pretend that price moves.
6809.28s: And then I'll just adjust the option by it and figure out what the loss would be.
6813.28s: So we got into this for 5.1.
6820.28s: And then.
6824.28s: There it goes.
6826.28s: Okay.
6827.28s: We got in for 5.1.
6829.28s: And we're planning our loss.
6832.28s: What did I say at 165.
6839.28s: So we have it's trading at 193.
6842.28s: We're planning loss at 165.
6845.28s: So this equals this minus this.
6847.28s: So at 28 point move.
6850.28s: Our strike is the 170.
6855.28s: So now we need to essentially look at a surrogate strike.
6859.28s: So this will equal this plus this.
6862.28s: 198.
6864.28s: So essentially our strike would look like this.
6866.28s: So we got in for 5.10.
6869.28s: And ours would be trading somewhere closer to this.
6874.28s: So let's call it 17.
6878.28s: I think that that's probably fair.
6882.28s: So this equals this minus this equals this times 100.
6888.28s: 1190.
6890.28s: All that makes sense.
6891.28s: Super simple, right?
6894.28s: I partially chuckle because I know that for a lot of people what I just did probably is super fucking confusing.
6899.28s: If you have questions on it, let me know.
6904.28s: But yeah, anyways, we can use this number minus 1190.
6912.28s: Lost probability is 12.
6917.28s: Yeah, go for it Lauren.
6919.28s: There are dumb questions.
6920.28s: I'm not going to lie.
6921.28s: I'm not going to say there are no dumb questions.
6922.28s: There's lots of them.
6923.28s: But I'll still answer it if it's a dumb question.
6925.28s: So I mean, we have that going for us.
6930.28s: But yeah, what's the question?
6934.28s: What I did was for those that are curious what that whole process was like in a quick synopsis.
6939.28s: I essentially used a surrogate option to figure out what hours would look like in a circumstance.
6944.28s: Because the PNL graph doesn't work.
6947.28s: So.
6949.28s: That Lauren says you're talking about selling puts and calls.
6952.28s: You can pull out of those when you want 100% correct.
6955.28s: Yep.
6956.28s: So puts and calls any sort of those options, whether you bought or sold, you can buy or sell them any time into expiration.
6965.28s: So definitely you can you can exit those whenever you would like.
6974.28s: So here.
6976.28s: Our expected return is really solid on the trade.
6980.28s: It looks good.
6981.28s: Now the problem that we run into is that if we look at the expected return, this is for an individual trade.
6989.28s: If we change this to be the expected return of a strategy, we run into an interesting conundrum.
6997.28s: Because if we start changing the probability or the the profit levels or the probability of profit, if we start changing them too much.
7007.28s: Then it can actually start decreasing our expected return potential.
7014.28s: So the original trade here looks great.
7017.28s: And I can even tell you the adjusted trade with the adjusted probabilities also looks great.
7021.28s: This is a great trade across the board.
7024.28s: Now if you're able to find other trades like this, then we're good.
7027.28s: If not, then circumstances change.
7030.28s: So going all the way back to the it depends comment.
7034.28s: It depends entirely on the kinds of things you trade the short put with.
7039.28s: If it's a naked short put, we don't want to take assignment.
7043.28s: The way that you have to build your matrix for profit taking is not super complex.
7051.28s: But it has to be done in the context of not decreasing your overall profitability potential and not getting to the point where we're taking profits too fast.
7064.28s: And if we take profits too fast, then we have a smaller total profit that we take.
7071.28s: So this can start nuking your overall expected return.
7076.28s: So kind of a lot.
7080.28s: The way that I would think about it to simplify to start is that you don't want to take profits too fast.
7089.28s: If you're taking profits within 50% max profit, that sometimes can be okay.
7097.28s: That's if you make 50% max profit on in this example of 51 DTE trade.
7103.28s: If you make 50% max profit in a week, then you could start thinking about it.
7108.28s: The problem with that is you typically lose total profitability.
7114.28s: Because let's say for example, that was our rule.
7118.28s: Our rule in this case is to take profit at 50%.
7123.28s: Well, guess what?
7125.28s: You take profit at 50%.
7128.28s: You would have taken profit much earlier in this trade.
7134.28s: So you have to reconcile that with you.
7138.28s: In the way that you think about the movement.
7143.28s: This doesn't look right.
7144.28s: I thought it moved more than this.
7146.28s: You have to go to it.
7147.28s: Oh, that's right.
7148.28s: Wait.
7149.28s: This doesn't look right.
7151.28s: There it goes.
7152.28s: It like didn't show it for a second.
7154.28s: So in this case, if we look at it and we said we're going to take 50% max profit from here.
7159.28s: You're out here.
7161.28s: You're out of the trade there.
7163.28s: So then when you stood to make 510, you now only made your 50% on that.
7170.28s: You made your 205.
7174.28s: So in this kind of context, we have to decide if the naked share.
7183.28s: The naked short put is being traded to capture theta.
7189.28s: Or if we're trying to capture a directional move.
7192.28s: Because for me, if I'm trading a naked short put to capture some sort of directional move.
7197.28s: I'm simply going to follow the move.
7200.28s: I'm not going to worry so much about the percentage of remaining theta.
7204.28s: I'm going to focus more on following the move in and of itself.
7214.28s: If I'm trading for theta.
7218.28s: Completely different story.
7223.28s: So if I put this trade on to provide positive theta for the portfolio.
7228.28s: And I was expecting to take in 510 total.
7232.28s: Theta dollars over the life cycle of the trade.
7235.28s: Then essentially nothing has changed here.
7237.28s: I still have a.
7239.28s: The only thing that's changed is I've had a much better probability of making that money.
7243.28s: Now I do have the option if I'm so inclined to roll the trade to try to make more money to take advantage of a strong trend.
7252.28s: But otherwise there's no real change that's required in the strategy.
7257.28s: Because if that's the context that I put it on, I want to make 510 over the course of the 51 days.
7264.28s: If it happens faster, it just increases the probability of me making the 510.
7269.28s: The entire point of the context on this is to decide ahead of time.
7274.28s: Because the last possible thing you want to do is make that decision up on the fly.
7280.28s: Because then your probability to fall prey to that exact disposition effect we looked at together not too long ago is exceedingly high.
7288.28s: And that decreases overall profitability for sure.
7294.28s: So kind of a fun example to work out.
7303.28s: That Lauren says, who pays me when I stay in after by a call.
7313.28s: Sorry. Could you run that by me one more time?
7317.28s: Who pays me when I stay in after buying a call?
7324.28s: This might be easier.
7333.28s: I like I like visuals. I'm a I'm a simple man.
7339.28s: Lauren, what color do you like?
7342.28s: We have different kinds of yellows.
7345.28s: We have green. We have this pink or purple.
7350.28s: We have some blues red. We kind of like a rust.
7355.28s: And then we have some oranges.
7359.28s: You like blue.
7361.28s: All right.
7363.28s: Blue. It is.
7365.28s: So here.
7368.28s: You have you.
7371.28s: Lauren, are you taller short?
7374.28s: And are your legs and torso proportional or not?
7378.28s: You have like orangutan arms or do you have like normal human proportions?
7386.28s: I have like I'm guessing something like this slightly longer torso.
7392.28s: Maybe your head's not that big.
7396.28s: And I feel like you're happy.
7399.28s: Do you get a smile?
7401.28s: And then.
7404.28s: Lauren's tall.
7408.28s: Okay.
7411.28s: There is Lauren.
7420.28s: Now she wants to buy a call.
7432.28s: And we have the normal height people.
7437.28s: Compared to somebody like Lauren.
7441.28s: And these guys are probably a bunch of nerds.
7444.28s: So they'll have glasses.
7448.28s: And they probably like little stumpy arms.
7454.28s: This person here.
7458.28s: Is a market maker.
7461.28s: And then we have another person over here.
7465.28s: Not quite as tall as Lauren.
7467.28s: A little bit of a football head kind of reminds me of hey Arnold.
7470.28s: So maybe I'll.
7472.28s: Finish that they got dropped on their head.
7477.28s: So they actually have X's on their eyes.
7480.28s: And they're not super happy.
7484.28s: But they also have arms.
7488.28s: So now this is.
7491.28s: Other person.
7498.28s: Lauren says I want to buy a call.
7501.28s: She whips out her cell phone.
7507.28s: And starts tapping stuff.
7511.28s: She sends an order.
7516.28s: And she says I want to buy a call.
7522.28s: Buy to open.
7526.28s: One.
7529.28s: Call.
7533.28s: At.
7535.28s: One dollar.
7539.28s: So now Lauren.
7542.28s: She has a lot of zeros.
7550.28s: She buys this call.
7552.28s: Her cash and sweep now moves.
7556.28s: To a millie.
7564.28s: She sends this order.
7566.28s: Technically speaking.
7569.28s: And so the first thing I want to do is.
7579.28s: The last thing you're going to do is.
7583.28s: You're going to be routed to an exchange.
7586.28s: The vast majority of instances.
7590.28s: Your order is going to go to the little midget.
7593.28s: So the little midget here.
7596.28s: So in this instance, you bought to open a call.
7600.28s: He's sold to open.
7602.28s: And now he's short your call.
7607.28s: So now what this little guy wants to do.
7610.28s: Is when he can.
7613.28s: He wants to get rid of this call that now he's short.
7618.28s: So if this other person over here.
7622.28s: They're trying to figure out what they want to do with their life.
7627.28s: He the midget market maker.
7630.28s: He needs to buy to close this.
7632.28s: He needs to get rid of this open trade.
7634.28s: So if this person is trying to sell to open.
7639.28s: Then in this case.
7641.28s: He can.
7643.28s: Buy to open here.
7646.28s: To give them that trade, which then cancels out this trade.
7651.28s: So then he becomes flat.
7654.28s: And then this guy over here might eventually hold your trade.
7659.28s: Now the majority of instances.
7662.28s: It's not that clean.
7664.28s: Unfortunately, the market maker would love for it to work that way.
7667.28s: But he doesn't typically doesn't.
7670.28s: And in this case.
7672.28s: He would hold inventory.
7675.28s: So he would buy your call.
7677.28s: If this person is trying to sell to open.
7681.28s: He would buy to open from him and inventory that call.
7685.28s: Until he can essentially unwind them to other participants if he can.
7691.28s: So now let's get back to the original question.
7699.28s: Lauren says.
7701.28s: I buy a call.
7703.28s: Someone is selling who pays me.
7706.28s: Nobody pays you.
7709.28s: Right? Because if you buy a call, you're paying for it.
7715.28s: In this case.
7717.28s: You bought to open one call for a dollar, which is $100.
7723.28s: You've paid that money.
7728.28s: So nobody pays you.
7732.28s: Think of it this way.
7734.28s: And then the next time you BTO.
7737.28s: This is a debit.
7740.28s: Which is money out.
7745.28s: Every time you STO sell to open.
7748.28s: This is a credit.
7751.28s: This is money in.
7760.28s: Lauren, does that make sense?
7763.28s: So in this case, nobody.
7767.28s: Nobody pays you anything.
7769.28s: Even though you have fucking tall ass legs that can like step over buildings and stuff.
7774.28s: Here's a building.
7776.28s: As a window.
7778.28s: You could easily step over that if you wanted because you told me you have fucking.
7782.28s: Or Genshin ass legs.
7784.28s: Now, well, you said tall.
7787.28s: So I interpreted that as gargantuan ass legs.
7790.28s: And taller legs.
7795.28s: Like that.
7800.28s: So nobody pays you.
7803.28s: In this instance, you bought to open the call.
7807.28s: You pay $100.
7809.28s: And now you hold the call.
7812.28s: That's what you bought with your money.
7817.28s: Now, are you talking about the inverse when you sell your call?
7827.28s: Let's are you talking about like when you exit your trade?
7830.28s: Because if so, we can talk about that as well.
7835.28s: But I want to make sure that you understand.
7839.28s: That Lawrence is okay.
7841.28s: So I bought a call last week for $10 and made $265 who paid that first question.
7845.28s: Is the call still open?
7854.28s: Let me get rid of that.
7857.28s: Is the call still open?
7860.28s: So now Lauren is down here.
7867.28s: With her tall legs.
7871.28s: And the scenario continues.
7875.28s: So she bought to open.
7879.28s: This one call at a dollar.
7881.28s: She told me she bought it for $10.
7885.28s: So it would have been $10.
7888.28s: $10.
7890.28s: Yeah, Lauren's still happy.
7895.28s: And she pulls out her cell phone.
7900.28s: And she starts tapping away.
7903.28s: She's like, yo.
7906.28s: Now I need to sell to close my one call.
7911.28s: And I'm going to do it for $2.65.
7915.28s: That's what it's trading at right now.
7921.28s: Let's call it $265.
7924.28s: She submits this order sell to close.
7929.28s: This order goes back to the market maker.
7937.28s: Who has glasses.
7942.28s: So now he's going to be long.
7947.28s: One call.
7949.28s: And he's going to pay you.
7952.28s: $265.
7954.28s: $265.
7957.28s: So now.
7966.28s: We have the conclusion of the scenario.
7969.28s: We're out of space.
7971.28s: That's annoying.
7972.28s: We have the conclusion of the scenario.
7976.28s: Where.
7979.28s: Oh, I forgot.
7980.28s: I have colors.
7982.28s: I'm going to be using this.
7985.28s: Because.
7988.28s: A gold chain.
7991.28s: With diamonds on it.
7996.28s: And she has a gold bracelet.
8000.28s: And now she's counting her stacks of money.
8006.28s: Because in this case.
8010.28s: I'm going to be using this.
8013.28s: Open.
8016.28s: For $10.
8020.28s: So to close.
8022.28s: For $265.
8026.28s: You know.
8030.28s: 255.
8033.28s: Less commissions.
8039.28s: That's how the trade played out.
8042.28s: And that's where the money goes.
8045.28s: Because for the market maker.
8049.28s: He's happy to pay you.
8053.28s: For this.
8054.28s: Option at $265.
8057.28s: He doesn't care.
8060.28s: Because the market maker is trying to play.
8063.28s: When you're option traded for $265.
8066.28s: And you'll see.
8076.28s: Here.
8083.28s: I thought it would be here.
8085.28s: Is it up here?
8086.28s: There it is.
8088.28s: Difficult to see, but it's here.
8091.28s: So.
8100.28s: So in this case, let's just pretend.
8103.28s: I'm going to modify the market here.
8111.28s: And let's pretend.
8117.28s: That we're buying them.
8121.28s: Here's the bid.
8124.28s: Here's the offer.
8127.28s: So we're buying them.
8129.28s: For two.
8131.28s: I probably would offer you 260.
8135.28s: And then maybe I'm offering them at $275.
8142.28s: And my goal is the market maker.
8145.28s: And to buy them from you.
8148.28s: I get them from you at $265.
8151.28s: Because you play the mid price like a smart person.
8155.28s: And then I'm looking for somebody to sell them to.
8158.28s: So I can sell them to this person for $275.
8161.28s: Because they're also smart.
8163.28s: First 270.
8164.28s: Because they're also smart.
8165.28s: And they play the bid as difference.
8168.28s: And here.
8170.28s: They made $5.
8174.28s: They're not looking for things that they like.
8177.28s: They're not looking for things that they don't,
8180.28s: but they don't know how to where to end.
8182.28s: But then they're not looking for things that they do.
8185.28s: They don't know what price it is.
8187.28s: It doesn't matter to them.
8189.28s: They want to get it added obviously as advantageous of a value
8192.28s: to themselves as possible.
8193.28s: But they're indifferent.
8196.28s: Because their goal is to give it to somebody else as soon as
8201.28s: Lauren says, now I get it.
8204.58s: Perfect.
8205.68s: That's great news.
8208.74s: It's why we need to draw things and it's why when I draw things, I'm highly accurate
8214.34s: to the details given so that I can directly express reality as it sits.
8223.18s: And Lauren can now enjoy her gold chain with diamonds, gold bracelet and her stacks of
8230.10s: money.
8231.10s: It's exactly where we're at in life.
8233.02s: Nice job, Lauren.
8234.02s: We love to see it.
8235.82s: Beautiful.
8237.22s: So this is where the money goes.
8240.38s: This is exactly how it works.
8243.06s: This dude provides liquidity.
8246.62s: That's his job.
8248.50s: He's connecting buyers and sellers by playing an intermediary and that's how they make
8257.66s: their money.
8264.34s: Every once in a while you need a good stick figure drawing to get us through.
8272.50s: That's a really solid question though and I hope that the overall explanation there
8279.58s: made sense.
8283.30s: I'm going to run through a couple more of these.
8285.22s: I don't know if I'm going to get to them all tonight but I just, people took the time
8290.30s: to send them in so I don't want to leave them hanging.
8298.18s: Reese says do ETF, do smaller ETFs exhibit P.
8301.98s: No.
8302.98s: Because if you think about post earnings announcement drift ETFs aren't going to have them.
8309.70s: You can have a RE or something like that that might have post earnings announcement drift
8313.94s: but ETFs themselves they won't they won't exhibit post they don't have earnings.
8320.94s: Okay.
8325.70s: So let's rocket through some of these super fast.
8334.94s: What was the most challenging period in your trading career and how did you overcome it?
8339.66s: Oh man, that's a deep question to like just fucking quickly pivot to.
8344.78s: I think the most I think the most over like the most challenging to there's two periods.
8353.50s: The first one is feeling completely overwhelmed by the amount of information and the way that
8359.02s: I overcame that was by slowly starting to learn a little bit and being comfortable with
8367.34s: the incremental progress.
8368.90s: So that's the first period and then the second period I think was when I realized after
8377.06s: how much time and effort I spent learning how much work I needed to do to build something
8382.90s: that works.
8384.58s: That's kind of really frustrating because if you think about what you learn in school
8389.02s: and how you learn in school, you learn something you take a test.
8393.58s: But the difference is is like there is no test that's not how you make money in trading.
8398.46s: The way you make money in trading is the practical application of the skill set which is a far
8404.22s: departure from simply taking a test and being able to remember things.
8409.82s: It's the practical application side of things is really tricky.
8413.18s: So the way that I overcame that was by starting to test a lot of things.
8417.50s: That's when I started getting really obsessed with paper trading so that I could test ideas
8426.58s: and then build a corresponding data set so then I could actually study the ideas.
8434.42s: The next question was how has your approach to emotional discipline changed over the years
8439.42s: and what advice would you give on managing emotions in trading?
8443.46s: There's a lot to this one but it really comes down to a really high overview.
8452.06s: The piece here on what advice would I give on managing emotions is do your best to train
8462.58s: yourself to have decreased emotions.
8467.98s: What I mean by that is anybody that's in the discord if somebody starts talking to me
8474.14s: about how much money they made and how happy they are, I always try to work with them on this.
8480.30s: Because while it's good to feel excited and happy, the problem with that in trading is that
8486.66s: if you feel excited and happy when things go your way, you're going to feel super shitty
8491.78s: when they don't.
8493.50s: You don't get one of those without the other.
8496.38s: So the way that I try to think about it to people is I focus so much on the application
8504.42s: of the process and less on the outcome and that makes it so much easier to decrease overall
8513.66s: emotions in trading.
8515.50s: But the first thing is getting in the habit of not letting yourself be happy or sad about
8522.82s: the outcome of a trade.
8524.54s: I try to get right of that as soon as you can.
8529.10s: And it sounds sad, right?
8530.38s: It's like, oh man, but I want to be happy when I win.
8533.06s: Again, if you're happy when you win, you're going to be really upset when you lose.
8537.22s: So to me, the way that I look at it is I focus on the application of the skill set and the
8544.34s: process.
8545.58s: As long as I do that, I can be happy with myself.
8549.06s: I can say I executed exactly as I'm supposed to, regardless of the outcome, that I can
8555.18s: always reward myself for.
8558.26s: But if you reward yourself on the outcome of trades, that's an emotional roller coaster
8562.70s: that I think is just a terrible, terrible process.
8567.62s: So yeah, that's an interesting question.
8571.10s: But next to what specific or habits have helped you improve as a trader.
8578.10s: This is literally as simple as it gets.
8581.38s: Trading plan, trading log, strategy outlines, that's it.
8586.98s: The thing when it comes to improving as a trader is completely getting over the fact that
8592.78s: there is no, there literally is no fucking way that you are going to remember all relevant
8598.66s: details objectively and make good decisions off of them.
8603.34s: So the specific thing that changes everything is when you force yourself to think through
8609.94s: things before you do them and you ignore impulse, you manage impulse and do the correct thing.
8617.38s: Then once you place a trade, it's putting it in your trade log.
8621.02s: And then when it's in your trade log and the trade resolves, we don't just delete the
8626.02s: trade out of the trade log because it went in or favor or didn't.
8630.02s: We input the data so that we can track it.
8633.18s: Something to like that habit is essentially the biggest one that matters.
8638.30s: It's not like what kind of shit you choose to look at it a daily basis.
8641.54s: It's not, you know, making sure that you're never buying when things are going down.
8645.38s: Like those things matter.
8647.14s: But if you're tracking what you're doing, you can see all of those other bad habits
8652.14s: objectively because our ability to objectively analyze as human beings is really not good.
8661.40s: And if you are not hypersensitive to it, I'm hypersensitive to it.
8665.60s: And if you're not hypersensitive to it, it's so easy to have a litany of bias creep
8672.60s: into the thought process.
8675.32s: So it is unequivocally required.
8679.12s: I'd rather be skiing says it can help you spot when you're off track and not following
8682.24s: your system's rules.
8683.24s: That's exactly correct.
8684.84s: And here's the rub.
8687.16s: It's so easy.
8688.32s: This is one of my big frustrations when people say something like, oh, build a plan
8691.92s: and always trade your plan never deviate.
8694.96s: And I always think like, yeah, no fucking shit.
8697.76s: Like if you have a plan that you really, really believe in and trust, why would you deviate?
8704.56s: Right?
8705.56s: But you have to like break that down into what it is because the trader gurus that want
8711.64s: to sound smart say that shit all the time.
8713.80s: Like never deviate from your plan.
8716.36s: The problem is is that comes with the assumption that we have a trading plan that we've built
8722.48s: and have ultimate confidence in, which is the biggest fucking, that's the biggest difficulty
8729.36s: in this process is to build that.
8732.20s: So the fact that like people to sound smart just take that as granted and they're just
8736.60s: like, oh, just trade your plan.
8738.36s: It's like bitch, make the plan.
8741.04s: How do you make the plan to then trust and trade?
8744.84s: That's the hard part.
8746.28s: It's not hard to trade something that you trust.
8749.28s: If you think it's good, it's just so frustrating to me because it's so disingenuous.
8754.88s: So to me, the biggest part about this is to figure out how to build a plan that you trust.
8764.32s: Because if you think about what causes people to deviate from a plan, for example, if I
8771.24s: gave you instructions and my instructions were very clear, it was concise.
8777.80s: If you told me like, if you're like, hey, I'm trying to go to the EOS gym, right?
8784.52s: The one that's right here by me.
8786.08s: Okay.
8787.08s: Here's how you get to there.
8788.64s: I go there every day.
8790.56s: Here's how you get there.
8791.76s: You go to this, this, this, and if you take these back streets, it's a little bit faster.
8797.20s: That's one series of instructions.
8799.88s: Here's another series of instructions.
8801.92s: I'm another person.
8802.92s: You say the same question.
8804.20s: How do you get to EOS?
8805.72s: Oh, man, I've never been there.
8808.40s: I've heard of it before.
8809.48s: I think it's over in this region if I'm not mistaken.
8812.04s: So if you go to this road and then you go to that road and I'm not positive, it's a left
8817.56s: or a right, but I think you go right and then you'll be there.
8822.08s: Which set of those instructions would you follow?
8826.96s: If I gave you those two, two different people gave you those instructions, which set would
8832.92s: you follow?
8835.36s: Probably the first set.
8840.44s: Which set of those instructions are you more likely to deviate from?
8848.24s: The second set.
8850.12s: Why would you be more likely to deviate from that second set of instructions?
8854.48s: Because you don't trust the fucking source.
8857.32s: The person didn't sound confident.
8858.84s: They said they've never been there before.
8861.04s: So then you're like, well, I don't really, maybe I'll trust my own intuition over there.
8866.04s: That's when you override a plan and do your own shit because you don't trust the plan
8872.32s: as it's laid out.
8874.84s: The biggest problem traders are going to have is not following their plan because you're
8881.88s: not going to, you're naturally not going to follow something that you don't trust.
8887.04s: The hardest part traders are going to have is building a plan that they trust.
8893.24s: If I gave you a plan that you understood inside and out, you know it from A to Z, you understand
8899.80s: all of the inputs.
8901.44s: There's nothing in there that you have questions about.
8904.96s: And it's the plan to trade profitably every day.
8910.00s: You go through it.
8911.84s: There's no questions.
8914.00s: You understand how each piece works.
8917.08s: You understand all the indicators, the signals.
8920.32s: And there's a broad swath of data that shows that it makes money.
8925.56s: You understand the ins and outs of it.
8928.68s: Your probability of trading that plan without deviating is massively high, massively high.
8939.00s: Because you understand it.
8941.60s: You believe in the outcome.
8943.56s: So then your reason for deviation is about gone.
8948.04s: You know it works to the best of your ability.
8951.68s: Then as you start to trade it and you start having some losing trades, but they resolve
8956.84s: in winning days.
8958.60s: And the outcome of the strategy is as described, you're going to follow it.
8965.92s: You're going to follow it every single time because you know what it is and you trust
8970.24s: it.
8972.00s: The difficult parts are when you have a plan or a strategy that's cobbled together.
8979.32s: And it's like, well, maybe I'll take profits at 50% on that short put.
8983.96s: But you don't know if it's right because we haven't done the research.
8987.36s: We don't trust if that's the right answer because we understand that it's decreasing
8991.56s: total profitability, although increasing win rate.
8995.96s: And if you don't know the answer, then you kind of deviate from it.
8999.56s: The only solution here is to build your own shit that you trust.
9006.20s: It's the only solution because there have been studies done.
9009.04s: I've referenced this before and it's hilarious where if people are given a, in a test,
9016.44s: a black, a black box strategy, meaning you don't know how it works.
9020.28s: You don't see it.
9021.52s: It's essentially just a set of rules that you follow and you're supposed to follow under
9025.68s: the context of it's profitable.
9027.80s: People deviate from those all the fucking time.
9031.16s: And it's because they do not trust it.
9034.40s: So trusting in the plan, it's non-negotiable.
9040.28s: How do you maintain consistent in your trading when the markets become volatile?
9043.48s: Yeah, no difference.
9045.80s: The way I look at the markets is my job is to see what the markets are doing and get
9050.32s: in where I fit in.
9051.92s: So I don't care if the markets are volatile, not volatile.
9055.28s: I essentially just continue to trade my strategies and apply the strategies that work in those
9061.96s: conditions correctly.
9062.96s: That's all.
9063.96s: That's a pretty easy one.
9067.12s: That Lawrence has ever had to revamp your plan and pivot tons of times.
9071.20s: I view plans as like evolving tools.
9075.68s: I don't really view plans as like these static things because markets change.
9080.64s: Lots of things change.
9082.76s: So I definitely don't view them as things that are stuck in the mud.
9088.08s: But the process of changing pieces of a plan have to be well thought out.
9095.04s: And if you start with a well thought out plan, then the burden for what's required in
9100.96s: order to logically change the plan is higher.
9104.92s: The biggest issue is just changing a plan because this is super common.
9110.60s: Let's say that you're trading a strategy and let's say you're trading something that's
9117.16s: supposed to have a high win rate.
9118.64s: You're selling iron condors and it's like 70% win rate or something like that, probability
9123.44s: of profit.
9124.64s: And then you go through a streak where you start losing four trades in a row, five trades
9128.44s: in a row, six trades in a row.
9130.16s: And you're like, well, damn, like this is statistically improbable.
9134.84s: That's going to test how well you trust that strategy.
9139.24s: And if you don't trust it well because you just kind of picked something that you saw
9143.88s: somewhere, your likelihood of abandoning that strategy in the middle of executing it is
9148.68s: a astronomically high is soon as things start getting ugly.
9153.08s: And then you actually never know the performance of the strategy because then we deviate.
9159.56s: You're like, oh, well, I thought this sounded good, but these last few didn't really go,
9164.68s: well, I don't really like these anymore.
9166.28s: I'm out of here.
9168.92s: You don't even give the system or the strategy like a fair look.
9174.12s: And it's because we are so short-sighted and impulsive with the way that we do things.
9180.84s: Where it's like, if you have one of the things that I use as an example is like,
9186.92s: if you're trading something that has a 90% win rate, you're still going to lose
9191.64s: 10% of the time.
9193.32s: What happens if you get 10% of the time in a streak?
9197.72s: It's all in a row.
9201.00s: A lot of people get shaken out in those instances.
9203.40s: And it's because we don't know what we're doing.
9204.84s: We haven't looked at the application of that strategy.
9208.12s: And the only way you can do that is through the process of testing.
9212.20s: And this is a beautiful segue to motherfucking paper trading.
9218.84s: Because for a lot of people, they're not going to pay to buy a bunch of data because it's expensive.
9224.84s: And it's difficult to find good back-testing stuff that you trust.
9230.04s: So the easiest way you can start doing this is by paper trading.
9234.52s: And it's by creating your own data right in that video.
9238.84s: That video there talks through the process of testing.
9242.84s: It talks about paper trading, back-testing, live-testing.
9248.12s: But that's the idea here.
9251.40s: Joey says, how do you know when it's time to replant any specific metrics?
9256.76s: Yeah. The primary metric is when the performance of the strategy drastically deviates from the
9261.56s: expected performance of the strategy. So if I have something that has a 70% win rate,
9267.64s: and I go through a path where I have, let's say, 70% win rate over a month or something,
9273.64s: just picking an example. And let's say I look back over the application of that strategy for
9279.48s: the month, and it's a 30% win rate. That's a pretty big deviation. That's a problem.
9286.68s: So then in order to understand that deviation, I have to understand the strategy more.
9291.80s: So for example, if I look at the historic data that I have on this strategy that I should have
9298.76s: before I trade it, and I see the worst period that it ever had before then was a 58%
9308.12s: losing month or something. Well, then that tells me I need to maybe pause that strategy
9316.28s: and see what's going on, because the standard deviation from the expectation is so high
9321.80s: that there's a problem. The inverse example is let's say I have a 70% win rate. I'm supposed to win
9327.32s: 70% of the trades on the strategy over the course of this month. At the end of the month,
9331.48s: it comes in at 62%. But then I look back at my data because I've done the correct steps and I have
9337.32s: the data, then I can say, well, okay, it hasn't hit 62% before. But over the past period of losing
9346.68s: months, I've seen the strategy come in at, let's say, you know, supposed to be 70%, then it came in
9353.40s: at like 68, 69, 64, 66, 63, 66, 62. Right. So it starts like, mirroring itself down.
9363.80s: That's kind of a trend that I've picked up on for some time now.
9368.92s: So that's exactly why paper trading is not negotiable. Because it is the only way
9377.56s: to objectively make decisions. Otherwise, it is all fucking guessing. And then there's no shock
9386.28s: why people don't trust their guesses. Why would you? I wouldn't trust my own guess. It's just a
9393.40s: fucking guess. And I know it's a guess because I didn't do the work. But if you do the work,
9399.08s: then you can lean on something way more heavily. This is why when people will ask me like, Eric,
9404.68s: do you have like FOMO? And it's I literally don't have FOMO in trading. I don't care if somebody
9412.76s: like Praureen Kitty is making hundreds of millions of dollars trading GameStop. I literally love that
9419.56s: for him. It's so awesome. But I know what I'm going to do. And I know what I'm capable of doing.
9427.24s: So I don't care if he's doing that. I'm stoked for him.
9431.72s: Would I try to integrate elements and use some of what I can learn to make my ship better?
9436.84s: Absolutely. Absolutely. But it's also a matter of reconciling with myself, what I'm comfortable with,
9444.28s: what my risk tolerance is are, and what I'm not. Am I comfortable risking most of my wealth on
9450.28s: an individual trade via options? No, because I'm in a different scenario. I have people that
9455.88s: depend on me. My mom being one of them. I understand the concept of survivor ship bias.
9461.16s: Like I know all these things. So I'm comfortable taking a lower profit potential and a longer road
9469.16s: than somebody like Roen Kitty because it fits my circumstance better. And I'm going to build stuff
9473.80s: that fits my circumstance. So that's why I don't have FOMO because I'm trading my circumstance,
9480.36s: not somebody else's. And I'm using things that I know work because I've tested them. And I have
9486.44s: over 16 years of live data that I had to build admittedly for the first part of my trading.
9492.84s: Because I didn't keep logs at all. I literally had to go back through my old bank state,
9497.72s: well, the broker statements and essentially build what I could for a log for those periods.
9503.32s: So they're not direct logs. They're because I didn't log in the beginning. It's a giant mistake.
9508.44s: But this is I'm coming up on my 17th year of doing this. So yeah, I kind of I know how this all
9514.92s: gets down at this point. So what I do is the same shit and it's stuff that I've built over time.
9521.48s: So it's why I don't have FOMO. It's why when I'm making decisions on managing a trade or
9527.16s: managing a system, I know how to do it objectively. And it's going to be done through data.
9532.68s: That's the only correct answer through data.
9537.72s: All right, game time for me to go grab some dinner. Absolutely great time hanging out chat
9542.52s: and trading tomorrow. We have GME. Sunday we have outlier pro live stream market prep talking
9548.12s: trading. As always, if there's anything you need, let me know. Feel free. If there's anybody that
9552.84s: you want to invite to the sessions, because we didn't hit 69 tonight, which is a giant bummer.
9557.24s: I want to get more people in the beginner session if at all possible. So that's the new
9561.88s: term goal. If you need anything, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
