0.00s: What's up, outliers? Let's talk about building a trade log. If you've heard me on YouTube at
6.00s: all I've talked about this because it is one of the most important things you can possibly do as a
10.48s: trader. So I'm going to walk you through a process of what this whole thing is, how it looks,
16.16s: and why you should consider it. And then I'm going to walk you through an actual example in Google
21.20s: Sheets right now. So you can see exactly how to go about building your own. Now a couple things.
27.60s: The first thing is one of the absolute best outputs of building a trade log is the process
34.96s: of building it. It's the same thing for building a trading plan. The process of building the
40.16s: log is really useful because it brings you closer to your strategies, closer to the information,
45.52s: and it makes you think analytically and forecast the kinds of things that you might want to track.
52.24s: The other thing about building a trade log is you don't need to have the final solution to start.
58.00s: My trade log continues to evolve. I just wrapped up my 18th year of trading. I went through a phase
64.24s: where it was handwritten. Then I realized handwritten kind of sucks because you can't conduct data
69.60s: analysis on it. So then it went into manual input, but that kind of sucked because it was taking me
74.88s: a long time to input all the things that I was trying to input. Then I went to full automation. I was
80.40s: using different kinds of integrations to pull all the information into a single spot with literally
85.20s: not having to input anything. That kind of sucked because it started moving me further away from
91.04s: the individual trades I was placing. Now we've gone essentially full circle, not full circle,
96.32s: partial circle. I'm back to generally using manual inputs, but rather than the second step where I
103.92s: was trying to track everything, I've become really specific with what I track. We're going to talk
109.28s: about that entire process. The first thing, why a trade log? Why is it that so many traders trade
117.92s: without a trade log? Well, the reason why they don't genuinely is because they're lazy. The reason
123.36s: why they're lazy is a lot of us start trading thinking that this is going to be fast easy money.
128.40s: Then as soon as you put something in front of somebody building a trade log where you have to
132.80s: track things, that sounds like work. That sounds like the antithesis of the expectations of when we
137.60s: started this thing. The sooner you can get over that, the better off you're going to be.
141.84s: So the trade log is designed to complement the trade plan, which I have a video that talks about
148.40s: both of those in detail. I'll throw that in the description below. But the trade plan is where we
154.72s: outline our ideas as we think we're going to do something. We include our research, how stuff is
161.68s: worked based on back testing, that kind of stuff. Then the trade log is where we actually see the
168.32s: results. We track the results. Now, one of the cool things about a trade log is I use the same
174.32s: trade log for tracking things that are both live trades, but then paper trades variations. Yes,
180.56s: what that does. It gives you a massive amount of information to make decisions off of because the
188.32s: second and third bullet points in this section over here, you have a unbelievable amount of cognitive
195.84s: biases in the way that you perceive information, reactive information, digest and analyze things.
201.52s: Some of them will be conscious. You will be aware of it. Some of it you won't. So the way we use a
206.80s: log is to short circuit those to make sure that we're not applying Goldilocks analysis and saying,
213.84s: oh, yeah, I thought I made some money on that trade. Then when you go back and look,
218.16s: including fees, it was a loss. Or if you're an options trader and you're rolling options for six
223.20s: months and you're like, man, I'm so glad I got out of this thing out of profit. But then you realize
229.28s: once you calculate the total returns over that six month time frame, you're like, well, crap,
234.80s: I have essentially nothing to show for it. Sure, I got out of those series of roles for a small
239.76s: profit. But then if I look at the overall return on that money for that time frame, it's not good.
244.96s: So coming to reality with stuff like that is very important. Now, the last point here is designed
251.36s: to frame a thought for you. Building a trade log can be overwhelming. But if you're planning to
257.60s: trade for a long duration of time, a trade log is essentially bookkeeping. This is what businesses do.
264.40s: This is how businesses make decisions and survive in last. The sooner that we accept that there's
271.28s: work to be done as a trader. And if we embrace this work and get over it and get on board with it,
276.80s: the faster you're going to see results. So the how, what kind of things belong in a trade log?
283.92s: The way that my mind buckets it is there are things that we need to track for every individual
292.80s: kind of log we might build. Then there are elements that are going to be highly specific to the
300.72s: individual strategies that we're building. So let me show you what this looks like.
306.08s: What I do is use different tabs for different strategies. So strategy one gets its own tab strategy two
314.40s: gets its own tabs G3 gets its own tab paper trading strategy one gets its own tabs own and so forth.
321.20s: And then I summarize all of these individual sheets within the tab itself.
326.80s: And then also I pull out the requisite details into a C2C tab C2C in the military stands for
333.52s: command and control. But I want to show you take a look at our sample log that I'm going to be showing
339.04s: you. So we have a coverage strangle tab here. If you're following the coverage strangle videos
343.52s: that I've been doing, you will have seen a lot of these. Then I have things for single options.
348.48s: Then I have another tab for box spreads. But the C2C tab is going to collate all of them
355.20s: into one visual spot for me think of it like a dashboard. So what you'll notice is that these
360.32s: different strategies will have things in common, but then these different strategies will have
365.12s: unique elements that matter for the strategy itself. So the way that I think about building this
372.32s: is the C2C tab gets built as you go along because you'll get a sense of the things that you might
377.76s: want to include. Then where the individual strategy tabs before you start building anything,
384.72s: trying to figure out the layouts, we want to keep a few things in mind. The first thing is we want
390.48s: to make sure that we can conduct actual data analysis to see what's going on to track trends.
398.16s: So we want to keep that in mind in terms of how we set things up. What doesn't work well for data
405.12s: analysis is if you have an individual cell like this and you do something like today, I sold
412.40s: five puts for two dollars in GameStop and made one dollar, right? Like you can't do anything with
422.40s: this. This is effectively useless. So we want to think about the data points that matter to us
428.40s: based on the strategy and then create a format to pull them out. The other thing is you want to
435.04s: make sure that you keep it consumable. In the beginning, you will probably overtrack things and
441.84s: that's okay. The reason why it's okay is overtracking in the beginning is part of the process of
448.00s: clearly identifying the things that actually matter for what you're doing. Then once you get a sense
455.28s: of that, you start to dial in what things actually matter for the individual strategies, which you'll
460.64s: get a sense of. So I think or the outlier approach to trading, which we leverage things like the
468.80s: outlier strategy process and the outlier trade process, I will throw links to both of those
474.00s: videos that's available for everybody. They're just frameworks to think about trading. I'll throw
478.56s: links to those in the description. But based on those, you will be familiar with these things,
482.96s: things like profit mechanisms, profit mechanism qualities, profit mechanism signals. Based on the
489.44s: individual strategies and its requisite details pertaining to these topics, I can think of different
498.24s: different metrics that will be relevant to the individual thing that I'm trying to try.
504.48s: So the last thing is try and be efficient. So when I'm setting up the sheets, as you'll see in a
514.96s: minute, I try to make it so that it's a light lift easy to move, easy to replicate, easy to adjust.
522.88s: If you make it to be really, really annoying, then it'll be a bear to deal with and you probably
528.24s: won't want to. So let's take a first look at the covered stringle strategy. This is the summary tab
537.36s: for an individual strategy. In this case, the covered strangle. And again, you all will have seen
541.76s: a bunch of different versions of this. For those that are unfamiliar, I'm doing a subset of my
546.32s: broader portfolio and I'm trading the covered strangle in these four different names, TQs,
551.04s: Upro, Ibit, GameStop. And I'm essentially using this as an example to just show a bunch of
556.56s: things about trading in my approach. So what you'll notice is on the top, I have overall aggregate
563.36s: level details. I want to see how much premium is open at a given point in time. I want to know
569.04s: what the total PNL is. I want to know how many trades are open. I want to know our distance off
574.16s: of 52 week highs. Why do I care about the distance off of 52 week highs? Because in my trade plan
580.00s: for these strategies that informs some of my sizing decisions, I have a column here for
586.08s: notional value. The reason why I have notional value is because TQs and Upro are leveraged.
591.76s: So what that means is if I have a total dollar utilization and T triple Qs of $44,000,
598.64s: $665,000, that's not really the risk that that represents. It represents broader risk because it's
606.40s: three times leveraged. Do I track that here? Then we have overall dollar utilization. So how much
613.36s: money is tied up in the trade right now? So that includes both cash secured puts and long shares.
620.00s: And you can see that I break that out here so that I can say, okay, right now I'm only actually
626.64s: a little bit in equity outright for T triple Qs and I'm mostly in cash secured puts.
632.08s: Does that reflect what I want to have right now? Then I start with, I don't know why I naturally
639.52s: went right to left. I think that shows how backwards my brain is. But the starting point here is
644.96s: the allocation. So what I do is I say of the portfolio, how much money do each of these
650.88s: individual trades get for this strategy? So for TQs, it got 100,000, you pro 200,000, I bit 125,
658.48s: game stop 25 so far. And again, these are subsets of the broader portfolio, but this is the same
665.20s: process I follow across the broader portfolio. So now let's take a look at one of these. And I'm
670.96s: actually in my actual log, these are all linked, right? So it takes me right to it. The links break
677.04s: when I copy and paste it. It's kind of annoying. But that's what these are. So if we take a look at
682.40s: T triple Qs, you can see that this is the total log here. And based on this total log, I have about
689.12s: all of the details I use to make decisions. I summarize things on the left hand side for the total
697.76s: position. And then I track all of the individual stuff here in the center. I split short puts,
705.36s: short calls that are open. And then I have sections to track the closed versions of those trades.
712.24s: Then you might ask, well, why don't I just put the closed up here below this section? Well,
718.88s: it's because I tend to trade more puts than calls. So then this would push the call section down
725.52s: too far over times. So I have to scroll a lot. Again, even though I prefer manual inputs,
731.84s: I have to be thoughtful about what I'm doing and how I input things so that it's sustainable.
737.92s: So then the other thing you'll notice is that there are some sections that are coded in green.
742.64s: That represents elements that require my physical input. Then there are these sections over here,
749.36s: which are automatically going to calculate based on these inputs over here. So my goal is to make
755.92s: it really, really easy for me to see where I need to input information and what information needs
763.12s: to go there. So if we take a look, you can see for the covered strangle, I'm tracking things like
767.84s: entredate, stock, expiry, strike, delta premium, lots. Now notice how I'm not tracking something
773.68s: like data and I'm not tracking something like Vega. And the reason is because although I care about
781.12s: those metrics and they're actually part of my trading plan from a tracking perspective,
786.88s: those don't really impact the breadth of what I'm doing. Even something like volatility,
793.84s: which is in my trading plan in terms of how I think about selling, but it's a secondary input
800.96s: in terms of how I think about selling. My primary input for what I think about selling is
806.00s: what is the total amount of money this position gets? How much am I using right now? How much is
811.36s: in stock? How much is in cash secured puts? Does that align with what I want it to be today?
817.36s: And if it does great, if I take a look at my utilization and my utilization is low, I don't really
823.92s: care what volatility is too much because I need to get the utilization to be what it should be
830.00s: based on what my disposition is. And then the difference between buying stock out right or cash
835.60s: secured puts, again, is an artifact of my disposition, not so much what volatility is. There can be
841.84s: periods where volatility is low and I'll sell more sometimes because that's more advantageous.
846.56s: Sometimes if volatility is high, I might sell more than it's based more on the utilization
852.48s: than trying to capitalize on volatility. That is for this specific strategy, the coverage
857.20s: triangle, which I'll throw a playlist for it in the notes below. But this is really an entire
863.12s: strategy based around optimizing an underlying buy and hold equity position. So the options are
870.48s: ancillary here. These are secondary. The primary position are going to be the long equity component.
877.28s: So this is the log as it sits. Now, another thing you'll notice in the coverage
881.12s: triangle log is I've built is I actually keep a little rolling option calculator off to the
886.16s: side here to help me analyze something like it's going on right here. So we can see that this trade
892.08s: was actually adjusted. So this trade started at a two lot. The opening premium that I gave it was
899.84s: 256. The closing premium when I took the trade down was 825. So then I opened up a new trade,
906.24s: another two lot. These should be the same format as this. The opening premium for these were
913.44s: 8.5. So now this tells me exactly what I need this new option to be trading at in order to hit
920.96s: break even. So what that means is this option right here, which is at an 850 premium. Once it hits
929.04s: $2.81, that tells me that I will be at a break even. So then if I close this trade for
936.16s: $2.81, it will net outwash this prior trade. So I use that when I'm making adjustments.
944.72s: Everything in here is designed for a purpose. So this is the covered strangle
951.28s: tab. And you'll notice that there's multiple covered strangles in here. It's the same thing,
955.60s: just several times. And then I aggregate it up at the top. Now we can take a look at single trades.
962.32s: Single trades is something that shorter term in nature. And this can be simple stuff like
970.56s: trading something directionally. That's mostly what I find in here. For things like trading volatility
977.20s: and whatnot, I have separate tabs for those. Now the way that this one's built is also very
983.28s: purposeful. You'll notice that I have all these different strategies up top. And then it aggregates
988.96s: all of the total data based on the strategies. This is the section for open trades. Then this is
995.04s: the section that collates all the closed trades. So now the way this works is let's say today's
1002.08s: 16 Jan, I have stock XYZ. It's at 10 bucks. It's a five lot. I'm going to look at the 21 Feb
1007.92s: expiration. It's a 15 strike. I want to buy calls. Well, what I do is I find a call. I find a 55
1015.60s: delta call. The total premium to get into that call is $2.50. Now one of the things you'll notice
1023.12s: right out of the gate is it does a bunch of math for me off to the side. And it actually helps me
1028.72s: codify what the strategy is right out of the gate. This is just with a formula. So then what I do is
1033.84s: I say, okay, what's the margin requirement for this trade? A lot of times I'll just use the total
1039.04s: cost right because when you're buying options, that's typically what it'll be. And then for short
1046.40s: options, I'll use whatever the broker tells me the margin requirement is then I'll input whatever
1051.12s: my risk is the risk is defined at entry. This is where I say when am I going to get out of this trade
1058.64s: based on the chart. So if I'm trading a long call, it's based on a breakout wherever I decide
1063.44s: based on my analysis where if it breaks down below that level, I would get out. That's what gets
1067.36s: input here. So let's say at that point, I lose 500 bucks. That's my total risk. So now this is
1075.68s: the open trade as it sits. And you can see that there's a gray section here. This is what I input
1080.88s: when I'm actually exiting the trade. So let's say it's the 16th of Jan. The stock goes up to $12
1088.24s: and then let's say that I closed this for $2.75. Great. So now I have a sense of what the actual move
1097.20s: was. But when I look at this, well, I see 2625. That's way too high. So what happened here?
1102.88s: Really simple. We have to pay attention to the signage that we use in whatever we codify into
1108.16s: our plan. So for me, if it's a debit, I use negative numbers, meaning money has gone out. Now,
1114.08s: all of a sudden, the PNL is accurate. It makes sense. So we just take this. This trade is closed.
1119.60s: We copy it, paste it down here. And then you'll notice that it'll start to aggregate all these
1124.72s: different trades. And you can make this as customizable as you want. Let's say that I'm trading a ratio
1129.76s: called Agno where I have a long option leg and then a short option leg easy. I literally just
1135.68s: copy and paste this down, whatever it is. And instead of doing a five lot since we normally do a
1140.72s: ratio, maybe it's a two lot. And normally we sell these closer in time. So maybe we do this for
1146.00s: 17 Jan instead. And the strike price will typically be a little bit different than the long call
1153.04s: will be a little further out of the money. So maybe this is like 25. And let's say that the short
1156.88s: call is like a 30 delta. Well, I want to know though that this is part of a ratio called
1161.60s: diagonal, not a long call and a short call. So all I do is drop a dash in there, drop a dash in
1166.24s: here. The dash tells me that there's another component to this trade, another leg, but this is
1172.96s: the base leg. So this is the base leg for this line item, which is the long call. This is the
1178.32s: base leg for this line item, which is the short call. And you can see that it automatically changes
1183.52s: the strategy to be what I want ratio called diagonal. So this is the process for singles. And then
1189.28s: I have another one for box spreads. There is a video that I have that talks about this. This
1194.32s: sheet itself is available to those in the Patreon. You can go download it from the shop for free.
1199.60s: And yeah, so this is like a really easy tool to help me track box spreads. Let's take a look at C2C.
1205.36s: C2C, I have a couple different sections. Now this is a really broken down version of what I have
1211.12s: just because mine is very noisy. But I'm giving you some ideas on tools that you might want to
1215.60s: include in yours. This section represents portfolio level tracking metrics. So these are things like
1222.32s: what's the beginning value of the portfolio, how much money have I made, how much is my current
1226.72s: theta, a comparison against a reference return of some sort is designed to be a drop down in my
1232.56s: main one where it'll say based on whatever this percentage is, it'll do the math here based on
1238.56s: the portfolio value. And it'll just tell me what the overall sizing would be. I can also just
1243.44s: input it manually. I can say, well, I want to put on a $5,000 trade. And this will tell me how much
1248.72s: that is of the total portfolio. So just little tools like that to help the day to day stuff
1255.28s: be a little bit easier. Then I have a total section that collates everything from the sub-sections
1262.32s: down here. So this section is going to use all of these different details to summarize. So right
1268.16s: now I can see of my $600,000 portfolio right now, I'm using $748,000 in terms of allocation.
1276.80s: In terms of actual utilization, I'm only using 532. The difference between allocation is how much
1282.48s: money I'm setting aside to do something. Utilization is how much I'm using at a given point in time.
1287.36s: Then I purposely have a section that takes out box spreads. The reason why I want to take out box
1292.08s: spreads is because a lot of times box spreads are tied to other trades, but it's a place that I
1296.64s: park cash to be more efficient. Then we have noional exposure. The reason why you have noional
1302.72s: exposures because if I'm trading leveraged underlines, I want to know what my actual risk is. So a
1310.16s: good example of that is here in the coverage triangle because as I showed you, we're trading
1313.84s: Upro and TQs. So when I'm figuring out what my total exposure is, I don't want to just use my
1321.20s: actual dollar utilization because even though this is the max I could technically risk at a given
1327.44s: point in time, the notional exposure will help me understand how leveraged I am and give me some
1334.48s: sense of the total risk there. Again, this is an aggregate level tab. Then I have just some
1340.56s: standard market tracking stuff. How far we are off of highs and off of local highs for different
1347.20s: indices, a watch list and stuff to do and then just some basic calculators over here.
1353.36s: Then this is where I would continue building out other sections. This would actually be input
1359.44s: in here. So I took it out to make it look a little easier to see, but the way that this would
1364.80s: actually look is this would go down here. Then all of this would slide up into this.
1373.20s: And then all of this would be filled in and I would apply the same lines and all that stuff to
1377.52s: make it easy for me to see. And each of these would go to the individual tabs to pull together
1383.76s: the futures tab, everything that's going on in the futures trading space, the ratio diagonals
1388.96s: and so on and so forth. This is literally a step-by-step process on how you build a log.
1394.64s: You start by the individual tabs. You track the things that you need, but you make it so that you
1401.04s: can conduct broader analysis. What I typically do is you'll notice that I set space off to the side
1406.96s: here so that I can write different formulas to test different ideas. I don't bother with graphs
1412.56s: and stuff like that. I know people like those kind of visuals. I think they're fine, but I don't
1416.96s: need it. It's just stuff that gets in the way I can just see the numbers. But if you like
1421.68s: graphs and stuff, you can build all of those off to the side or appear if you're so inclined.
1426.48s: But the idea is to outline what you need. Then figure out a format that allows you to input the
1432.88s: details that you need efficiently. And you start a little bit by overtracking, but then you back
1440.40s: off of overtracking. The reason why you back off is so that you'll actually adhere to the process.
1446.64s: If you have too much in here, you simply won't do it. That's not a good approach.
1451.20s: Then the other thing to note is you can input comments in here. If you're filling in something,
1457.84s: you're like, oh crap, I forgot what this acronym means or what I meant when I said percent
1462.96s: capture, which for me, it's just how much of the actual premium did I capture, stuff like that.
1468.80s: So if you have any questions, let me know. Go out there and build a log. It'll help you a lot.
1476.72s: I literally, literally promise you that building this will at least give you more information
1484.00s: to make better decisions as a trader. You know, I'll see you later.
