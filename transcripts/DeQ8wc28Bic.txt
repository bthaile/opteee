0.00s: super quick video for the eight
2.00s: outliers out there to fund not
4.00s: to share. So at zero nine,
6.00s: we have Warren Kitty dropping
8.00s: Woody with obviously the
10.00s: dog stock. That's what this
12.00s: clearly represents not so
14.00s: cryptic in this sense back
16.00s: into the toy box. And so
18.00s: would we know? Well, we know
20.00s: probably that he's closing
22.00s: if not exited the entire chewy
24.00s: position. And then the other
26.00s: interesting thing is that if
28.00s: we take a look at what's happened
32.00s: today in the options market, I can
34.00s: show you that there's one point
36.00s: one two million dollars that went
38.00s: into the 13-Sept
40.00s: 22 and a half calls.
42.00s: Who knows who it is? I don't.
46.00s: But I do know some people that
48.00s: tend to move in this kind of size
50.00s: around this position. And then
52.00s: if you take one look below that
54.00s: at eight forty two, we see another
56.00s: six hundred and nineteen
58.00s: thousand dollars same strike
60.00s: same expiration. So to me, it
62.00s: looks like there's a little bit
64.00s: of a shift going on. And right
66.00s: now the phone is freaking out
68.00s: because I have a bunch of trades
70.00s: that are moving around as they
72.00s: should be because if we take a
74.00s: look at games.
76.00s: Game stop is now up
78.00s: over six percent already and
80.00s: we're leading into earnings. This
82.00s: is exactly what I've been talking
84.00s: about with respect to. As soon as
86.00s: there's a catalyst, the stock
88.00s: starts to move and right now it
90.00s: looks like the catalyst is very
92.00s: much likely to be the cat.
94.00s: If we take a look through time
96.00s: in sales now, it's flying off
98.00s: the shelf. If we take a volatility
100.00s: the front vol is now over four
102.00s: hundred percent. This is where
104.00s: things start to get real
106.00s: interesting because there's a
108.00s: lot going on now, especially as
110.00s: this news gets out moves around.
112.00s: People are going to be looking at game stop pretty pretty hard because for a while people are started to get a little
114.00s: disenfranchised thinking that you know
116.00s: maybe DFV moved on but I think most of
118.00s: the community was pretty resolute
120.00s: that he was doing his thing probably going to come back. I think that's what the vast majority of people probably
126.00s: thought. And I mean you can just see
128.00s: we're flooding in now.
130.00s: So if we take a quick look at the open or the volume for today,
134.00s: you'll see that there is a hundred and
136.00s: thirty one thousand contracts traded and then if you take a look
140.00s: over here at this box which represents
144.00s: the thirteen step, the twenty two and a halfs
148.00s: thirteen thousand three sixty three
150.00s: twenty two and a halfs. So those are slightly in the money. That's a slightly different move.
156.00s: Then we've seen previously but can't help but enjoy the show up over
160.00s: eight percent now in two and a half minute three minute video. So
164.00s: I mean we just got to keep an eyeball on this.
166.00s: I'll do a bigger video later
168.00s: today kind of recapping what goes down but too exciting not to share
172.00s: it's up almost nine percent already.
174.00s: So watch the fireworks in joy. See you all later.
