 I'm going to be back. What's up everyone? Welcome back to the All-Ir podcast. I have a familiar face. My friend Matt Caruso from Crucio Insights, which is a fantastic game, by the way. I use a similar name for my newsletter. Great minds. Think alike. Good to see you, my friend. How are you? I'm good. Thanks for having me back Eric. Appreciate it. And I have to the blast. So we were just talking about how there's so much money flowing out of your pockets that you just can't get into and obviously I say that in in just for people. But it reminds me. Did you see that comment that warm buffet made pretty recently about some of the stuff that he's trying to do with his money? One of the, I think at the shareholders meeting, they were saying like, you know, why do you have so much money and cash? Because it's a few billion dollars. And his response was perfect. His response was, I don't think anybody knows what to do with a billion dollars. So. You know, it's interesting. You also had another interesting comment because I didn't watch the whole thing by the kind of like the highlight really, I guess, you know. And someone asked him if you were younger or if you had less capital, what would you do? And it kind of goes back to what you and I were talking about like the highest rate, the consistent returns is that, you know, you're limited by scale at a certain point. But he was saying he's confident that he could go around and find like a lot of goods like small, but like, you know, these 30, 40, 50% per year return. But they're small. You, you can't scale. And like, I don't even say in the tens of millions of billions or billions. Definitely not billion. But, you know, things are out there if you hustle, you know, but when you got a few billion, it's a different. You know, people like the kind of chastise that the big hedge fund guys or what? But when you're trading, you know, a few thousand, a few hundred thousand, a few million and you're trading five billion, it's a, it's a different volume. Yeah, it's one of those things that I feel like traders don't really think, I know I didn't, I didn't think enough of it. And again, like we were right before we were talking, we were talking a little bit about scale. And I think that's what I really wanted to say. I think that's what I said. I didn't think enough of it. And again, like we were, right before we were talking, we were talking a little bit about scale. And it's not like I'm, I'm trading at this massive scale, even shadow of what those guys are. And I still run into liquid, especially in the options markets. I mean, that is, that's one of the really tricky parts actually about derivatives is a lot of people to talk about. Oh, like, you know, what should I trade? What should I look at? And it's just like, once you're kind of at scale, there's only a workable universe available to you. So it's, it really is quite naturally limiting by itself. Now, I imagine for your progression from kind of the really small stocks and to other things that fit the portfolio better, that there are probably more suitable alternatives. Or is that overselling it, you think? What do you mean by that, or can you be free? That when you go from your kind of small group of, you know, smaller stocks and you start looking at like the next level of market cap that fits the portfolio. Is there a lot to pick from? Or is it that starts scoping down really fast? I think if you're like an individual investor, there's still like a large amount of scope. I think once you start kind of getting into like the hedge ones, like situation it changes, liquidity become, I mean, I think that's why like, look, you know, in video, like in all these AI stocks, mega has that have been running so hot, like this disparity between those and everything else. Like, I think they're getting like multiple tailwind. Like, one is obviously the whole AI theme and what that could do, but I think the look at the market, the market, the market is going to be a lot of things that you can do. But I think the liquidity part is pulling them in. I mean, if you're a hedge fund guy or whatever, anyone, big fund, and you want to have like exposure to the space, I mean, video is like you don't get more liquid than that. So, you know, they also get like the liquidity premium and all of that. So definitely, definitely health. But if you're if you're a smaller investor, there's still like a wide space that you can play with for sure. Yeah, I imagine. And talk to me about that so far. I think we connected, like, first quarter of this year, I tried to do like quarterly with it is like people like you that I like. And just see like how the years playing out. And I think if I recall correctly, you know, towards the beginning of the year, it was a little bit of kind of back and forth, like trying to find good opportunities. How has that played out since last week's spoke? So I ended up getting positioned a lot of good names. So that's a really good great action. Actually, it's fine. We were talking last call about using options to hedge for a lot of these things, which I was using. And kind of in a good way because the earning season was not kind. I think I counted just recently, like nine out of about 11 stocks, like, gap down on earnings for me. So, you know, I know it's he was a bad luck. But I hate luck. I feel like if you think bad luck, you start to you start to invite it into your life. It's really just, you know, the probability curve. I just on the, I'm on the wrong side of the bell curve. Yeah, it's past. But, you know what? Like, thankfully, I mean, jokes aside, the earnings hedges made it like, okay, it was, I mean, it's not the, you know, it was frustrating because like the way I like to kind of build exposure, build positions, it takes me a lot of the way I want to build exposure, build positions. It takes some time to do that together. So, if you get kind of knocked out of a lot of positions in earning season, and then markets were still strong, it's a little more difficult to like, immediately reposition. So, it was kind of unfortunate that they didn't kind of like, gap and run our way, which would have been fantastic, but then also kind of forcing the repositioning. So, it's been tricky. But, you know, it's one of the main tools I rely on is like the net highs, net lows that tell me like what kind of environment we're in. I use it all the time. And it's been super helpful because like, there's been a lot of, I mean, just recently, I had this leg up in the eye, like that kind of propelled everything. But besides that, if you're a trend follower, which is where I fall, like the past two, three months have been like deadly chopped. So, like, thankfully, like, I was able to kind of sidestep all that chop and all that kind of frustration. So, you know, I can't complain too much. I went on when I hit the, the opposite of the, the bell curve of earnings reports, it'll be a different conversation. Have you, one of the things I noticed because that's actually one of the early connecting points I think between you and I, net highs lows, I haven't found like a ton of people that used it. And it's something I've always used. The, that like, accumulation distribution, tick and train, like those kinds of things. I've always liked those for breadth indicators. And one of the things I noticed really interesting for net highs lows was the disparity between NASDAQ and the NIC, the New York Stock Exchange. What do you make of that? So, you know, it's, I think it's a really versatile tool that I think people may be like, sometimes misinterpreted or they don't get all everything they can out of it. I think right now, there's a really, there's a really, there's a really really, really nice way of thinking about it. I think right now, some people kind of clump it all together to get a reading. I like having them separate because the, the NASDAQ and NIC stocks, they really kind of reflect like the different types of trends in the market, like the more speculative versus the more mature. That's the way I like to look at it. And so you can see, like, lately, it's been very weak on the NASDAQ side of things because I really apart from the large caps, everything else has been pretty weak. But you know, it's more of like an easy money hard money indicator. Because that's really what I think. Because I mean, you know, it's not nothing's perfect. Sometimes, you know, we could have a few net loads and we kind of turn around. We bounced the other way or there's net highs and we roll over. But like the way I look at it is just like, if you look at any environment, if you have net highs, it's probably like a much easier money environment. Because it, because what it's really measuring is, is measuring like net liquidity flows. You know, if more stocks are making 52 week highs and lows, like you have net money coming into the market. If it's the opposite, like, I mean, now, just recently, I think that's really, I mean, I think that's really, I think that's really really, really good. And in the few large caps, I mean, it's great. You're not complaining. But most other stocks have really been struggling. So I think a lot of people will look at a vast decline. I mean, in all these kind of things and just like, take a hard stance of like, I need to be a bearer. I need to be a bull. That's dangerous, man. Because if you look at, for example, the vast decline line, another like a breadth indicator people like. Like that top to 1998. And the market top in 2000. So if you were just like, screaming at the screen saying, you missed a whole dot com round. Like, who wants to miss dot com, you know, so like what I also like, and that's kind of what I like about net highs, lows to a little more than like, just a pure divergence, like a vast decline. Is, you know, at vast decline, like that divergence can, can stay active for a long time, while the trend persists. Like now we've had a bit of a disparity between net highs and that lows in the market. But usually that disparities very short live. Because if it is a healthy market, you'll get a few more stocks making new highs. It'll turn the corner much, much quicker. So I find it's a more versatile tool. But you have to put in context instead of it being like this. I think it's like we're all trained from sports. Like we all have like our home team that we like. You know, either I'm a bull or I'm a bear. And like people like really identify as that when that's their viewpoint. I think just be more flexible. I think it's like easy dollar environment or hard dollar environment. So how do you want to play? I think the, the part also that I would tack on to that is I find the long run in markets. The more I find people really are just interested in. I think it's a very simple explanation. What's the one thing I can look at that gives me all the information? Right? And kind of to your point that that one thing isn't it's not there. Maybe stock price maybe right up down. That's that's one thing. But yeah, I feel like whenever I talk to people about those kinds of things, I find that same lack of nuance. And to me, that's actually where a lot of the opportunities kind of emerge. Because especially for me, the way I will use any sort of breath indicator net highs lows, whatever it is. It's not like a binary choice for me. It's positive or negative. I'm long. I'm short exactly as you're outlining. It's more of kind of an informative tool against the rest of what you see. Because you can still find plenty of periods. I run a massive study that overlays net highs lows with the price of all the different indices and sectors. Just to see how well they line up. And so like any sort of oscillator-ish indicator. There's a lot of noise in it. And understanding how to interpret those periods of noise becomes really important. And I always think like overlaying it with what you're seeing on the actual charts and the rest of the market tends to be a pretty good exercise. When you're thinking about analyzing, let's say right now, for example, the NASDAQ, the net lows, not super crazy low, but definitely not super low. But definitely trending below zero for a little while now. What do you look for in that data, especially against when you look at something like the S&P 500, which just made essentially new highs again? How do you kind of layer those two? So you always want to find like what's what's the trend of this cycle? So like you're, to me, it's an important data point because it just kind of like a cut through the noise. 52 week higher lows and important event. It's not like I'd vast the client like it's any stock up yet. And nickel today or down nickel and accounts that can up or down. So I mean, like generally more stocks are breaking down, but this and this cycle is just it's kind of odd where. It just so happens at the stocks that are like exploding happen to be the largest market cap stocks in the world at the same time. So anyone kind of stepping back if you're just forcing trades. So if you look at this, you know, a blind see but the market's up. So I need to be long, but you're forcing trades in all the wrong groups. You're getting run over the chop is immense. If you're trying to buy breakouts and anything that hasn't been working. So for me, it's just kind of like, okay, we're in this hard dollar environment. At least let me figure out where the money is flowing. And once you see that, then you can kind of piece together the stories not always easy at the beginning of a trend. But I think it's been pretty clear for like a few weeks. If you're if you were throwing money at anything except AI large cap tech. I mean, you're not getting anywhere. I mean, in fact, if you look at a lot of industrial stocks and the rest of the day, you know, they've been like already in some, you know, decent size corrections. So for me, it's just it's really just about. Understanding what's really going on in the market because the indexes. They're not as descriptive as the use the concentrations too high. Like it's weird. I never thought I would say this, but like the Dow 30. The Dow industrials 30. Because it's like a price weighted index. Probably gives like a better like the diversified look at stocks than like the Nasak RS and P. I was actually. I was having this national friend of mine recently. I was like, if you're like trying to bring a new fund to market. And and you want to sell to retail. And you tell like the product officer like, Hey, but you know what? Like I have like three stocks at 30%. He's going to say like you're too concentrated. I can't you know, we can't offer that to retail. But then after like the stock market itself has like basically, you know, three stocks being 2526% of the total index. So the concentrations off the charts. I mean, how far along the last hard to know. I mean, as interesting because because then after always the. I know I'm kind of going off topic, but people always kind of say like, maybe this time is different. Maybe like the large companies will like dominate unlike before. You know, it's always the young upstarts and ultimately kind of up. I mean, if you kind of look at this current cycle, how was this all kicked off? It was all kicked off with open AI. And I mean, they kind of like it's just that, you know, then I'll all these other stocks are benefiting from the infrastructure play. But it was like this new upstart who kind of shook up. What AI in turn into like a gender of AI we can all use. So I mean, I mean, other than the largest group in the world, they'll probably keep keep doing well and growing because they have such a long inroads. But I still, I still look to see who the next big players are going to be to kind of shake things. That's where the really monster percentage needs will be. Especially from your perspective of stock trading. I mean, like trying to make sure that yeah. That's it's actually funny listening to that. It reminds me that I kind of probably play the game a little bit. It's easier mode just in that one single sense options are by no means easier to be clear for most people. They add a tremendous amount of complexity. But the one good part is you can create leverage out of thin air. Essentially, this kind of there. But so when you're kind of looking through trying to find these different leaders now. What's that looking like for you? Where are they? There's only one place. It's all it's been the AI. Yeah, large. And not that everything else is broken. I mean, like there's still like you could look around a lot of stocks that are healthy. They're basing. But they haven't had any momentum like moves for months. Like they just been stuck sideways with general markets. It's been. I mean, there's there's someone I follow Jason go for these from sentiment reader. I don't know if you. If you know the company, but they do great kind of like technical research work and all the rest. And he had some great tweets because you know people will like anyone who says like you know all this market is a bit narrow people like all you're just angry because you're not invested super long. But like statistically, I mean like there's no other market on record that's had such a disparity between the few and the many, you know, so. So look for next leaders. I mean clearly like the AI space has been hot. We had big reversals today, which look like maybe at least a short term. I mean, momentum can carry higher anyways, but typically it could be possibly a short term top. But besides that there's other still healthy looking things, but you need. You need to come out of their bases and show that moment and ignition again or else they can just kind of chop side ways for we're in summer now they can chop side was for a couple of months easily. And the next question I have then is when you try to think about the impact of the new regime on the capability for these different kinds of companies to grow. Do you think that we're at like the early stages of where you might start catching parabolic growth. Do you think that this is kind of where most of these smaller companies might be trying to get all their stuff together. I think we're like in a year from now is where you would actually start to see them taking off. How do you think about that timeline for them? Yeah, you know, and this is I think it's a mistake on my part that I wasn't a little. I wasn't a much more focused on the large cap things because I kind of saw the AI come and said, OK, and video is going to be the chip player who else is going to win. But I think the perfect playbook to answer your question is really the 90s in the internet. So the first wave really was if you think about it was infrastructure, even things like Microsoft like windows like windows is not really a product is just it's just like the interface you use to access the other products like no one's known using windows are using stuff on windows or you know compact came out of the laptop. You know the portable computer and all the rest so I think we're really in that infrastructure wave. Which which can be a good way for me as we can see, but the really, but the infrastructure stocks, although they can have good sizeable moves, they kind of get weighed down by the fact that there are a large companies in terms of percentage returns. So if you look at the whole 90s bull market for internet, the wildest and craziest percentage moves things like Yahoo and all the rest. I mean, those were those those weren't the infrastructure plays they were the the people who were able to deliver the new experience to people. So I think there's there's you know a whole new wave a good friend of mine was somebody recently he was looking at why combinator who's sorry I just hit my my moving desk here sorry. You just got a little bit taller. Yeah, that's it. That's it. So a good friend of mine was telling me why combinator, which they they helping to be all these new startups like 95% of the new startups in the past year are a I related. So I mean, just think of the amount of ways that there's going to be new implementation of this technology and new outcomes, even things like biotech you can find diseases better developed drugs better faster. You can look a machinery could be more there's me so many outputs. I think it's these new young companies they're going to have the like eye watering moves like stuff we haven't seen in the generation. So I'm still I'm still very excited. I think it's early days and I think it's really is the real deal. It's not a buzzword. I mean, an AI. I think we don't see all of the output today, but like when people say well, how do you know what's real. Well, I look at just the amount of capital that people are investing in the space. I mean, like you're talking like I mean, I think Elon was talking about how they're spending four or five billion a year with Nvidia just in chips. Then there's the racks and all the rest like that's just one company. So like combined companies are spending tens of if not hundreds of billions of dollars. Like you don't spend a hundred billion dollars unless you have a real path to how you're going to be able to monetize this stuff. You know, so. Like if it was just hype, I think before the invested a hundred billion dollars collectively, plus they would they would make sure there's a real path to kind of use case for all this stuff. So I think it's a real revolution. It's going to bring on a whole bunch of interesting things and the companies are going to come out. I think you're going to be it's going to be the opportunity of a lifetime. I think in the next five years. It's funny. Say that I've kind of echoed that in a couple different senses. I think one of the things that you brought up though that makes me chuckle a little bit was the idea of, you know, not necessarily investing that much without a clear pipeline. But then I can't help but think of the metaverse was people were going and droves into the metaverse and I don't see that much is much anymore. I'm actually curious from your perspective. Is that anything that you think of at all? Well, you know, so the metaverse. Yeah, I mean, I don't think it was at all like as broad based or the kind of capital. Definitely not. And also like that was it was kind of a bet on a new way for people to want to like operate like I mean, maybe it's my age now consider myself an old person, but like I find a weird to have to live in a digital world. I think I can actually find like having my phone on me all the time annoying and I'm sure maybe the younger crowd will disagree, but I think to AI's strength is that it can just be used in like a countless number of ways. It's not about like trying to like transform your physical space into a digital and like you have to adapt this new environment like AI can. You know, like I said, it can help someone find a drug quicker can help like operate your your vehicles more efficiently. There's like so many ways it could be incorporated like I think we're just scratching the surface. So I think it's just there's. It's a much broader scope of applicability, which is going to make it easier to scale and all kinds of countless ways. I think that's probably one of the most exciting things actually for my opinion as well as funny. I was doing a podcast with another buddy. I was doing a podcast with a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more like a guy who was a little bit more Like a guy who was a little bit more like an idiot together. When you listen to Brian Patel that you're so pretty. And then you listen to Brianaczego like that you're this with we have already. I mean, man, how far can this go? So this leads to the follow on question for you. When you're thinking about playing this kind of move with this much opportunity and breadth, we talked about a little bit of the infrastructure side of things that seems like a near term play that could make sense. What's the what's the follow on for that playbook then? Because obviously we can kind of forecast the way we think this might go where it might have greater impact than others. And I imagine that would probably impact your positioning decision. So I think it's going to come out of two ways, the indirect and the direct way. And so like the indirect way is going to be all the companies where I mean, like this we'll talk about like the unfortunate side things that people are scared of. But like, you know, for example, they were showing how I forget who was showing it, but basically they had like two phones. One was like an AI that calling to order food and like the other was like an AI, like receptionist tools like taking the order and they're both having what sounded like two realistic people conversations. So basically, yeah, the call centers, you won't need all those people. That's a huge cost saving. So everyone's always scared for jobs. But I think that's a misplace like every technological of all the new jobs are found better jobs. So I think you know, in the short term, maybe it's a bit of pain, but overall it should sort itself out. But so all the companies who figure out how to leverage it, you're going to see like a big boost to the bottom line for a lot of companies who get that right. Just like like anyone who you know, figure out how to leverage the internet and I mean, think about people before like like the way things were shipped, the way things were ordered. I mean, think if you got to have receptionist to take orders, I mean like it's really, I mean, if you should by today's standards, it's ridiculous that we did everything so manual. So those people will all get like the bottom line boost, I think. And then the more direct ways and then people are going to come out just like with completely either never thought of before products and services, which is an option or even just sometimes having a more streamlined AI driven software or product can append like big company like you know, a lot of times we look at these big companies like like, oh, they're untouchable, they're so big. But like try and get a new product or a new process through a big company. All the committees you have to go through then there's the like the legacy investments we just spent so much on this, how can we just like throw away this investment. So like we'll do it partially and then you have these small upstarts that just like run ahead and take and eat your lunch, you know, like the Netflix examples like the common one that you know blockbuster could have seen what was coming. So I think so those who kind of leverage it directly and those like indirectly within the current ecosystem. And I think there's a lot of ways a different, we would we would speak of the internet, but you could think of like the nuclear bomb, like how that kind of changed things, it was the energy and then the whole like you know, space race and uranium stocks and in the 60s, there's all the like rocket booster stocks and aviation that took off that was like a big thing. Or you could think of even the car, how that kind of revolutionize everything for domestic travel. I remember it's funny if you look at early reports, I like to study like technological revolutions. Like a lot of people like you can see culture people be like, oh, a car will never be as you know as useful as my horse, my horse can go everywhere like now you look back at that, you're saying like what a what a narrow view. I mean like you know for him, maybe in his world where he saw like just like an open metal, the horse is more more useful, but as a society like the car obviously is far, far better or there were trains before then trains how they change everything. So every I think this is another one of those cycles where you know strap yourself in, it's going to be interesting. And all of those cycles didn't last a year. They all lasted for a decade or two. Like I mean big transformations. So it's I mean, and we look at the 90s as the internet transformation, but really you can even almost extend it into two that I mean Google came out was 2004, you know, so like it wasn't all just as internet dominating the 2000s, but I mean meta with 2000s, Apple really kind of got super innovative in the 2000s even though they were around before. So I mean the 2000s are really kind of the second act of like what was the 1990s. It's funny that you segue into that because I know that you study a lot of the a lot of the just histories of markets and kind of different reference points. So that was going to be my next question for you actually, which was looking at AI, what's the closest historical comparison you can think of for what we're seeing and what we can see. Obviously you gave an overview of what it potentially will look like in total scope, but do you have a reference benchmark that comes to mind for it? I think the internet's the best the best one because because what was different about the internet, like I mentioned cars and cars, you know cars were like they got better, but the car remained the car. Like I think the internet's a good example of where the internet provided this base layer for a platform that like, you know, mutated in many unforeseen possible directions. So like that's why I think the internet's probably the best kind of comparison that we have kind of thing, you know. Yeah, and the way it had that like you had multiple it's interesting because in the end, it even had even multiple layers of infrastructure plays. So like the early infrastructure winners, like in the 80s and early 90s, were different than let's say, Nortel, like at the end of the 90s, who was like doing the fast internet, like the technology moves so quick, you need like another infrastructure rebuild 10 years later. So it's going to be I think that's the best probably study. And it's similar like how, you know, yeah, who was the portal, the initial portal, like Google was like the updated version of like better search. And then, you know, like the iPhone was like the updated version of like the web browser, like it's in your phone, this app store. So you have these like reinventions along the way. So the only thing is with AI and I think there's everything in general now, everything happens faster. So like where stuff happened like, you know, over let's say to call that 20 years from 90 to more really like, you know, like Microsoft came out mid 80s. So call it let's say 20, 25 years like that cycle, maybe this strings to 10 or to 7 or 8 where you get like this massive wave of like unbelievable productivity. I mean, something's coming. I think I think we'll see what it is. I think that that's like a really adept comparison, honestly, and it leads me to another thought, which is when you typically play at least a lot of your search criteria for the stocks you're looking for and stuff like that kind of exhibits a certain pattern, it'll, you know, surge base, or like that kind of thing. And when you look at the kind of potential roadmap, something like this could have and the investments in this could have, does that adjust the way you search for stocks because that timeframe can potentially be compressed so much or is it something as you think that the model that you employ now is rigorous enough that it would adapt to that new scenario equally as well. I think it's rigorous enough because, you know, it's interesting. If you take like the recent Nvidia weekly chart or let's say arm, which had a big move recently, and you can compare it to like these same leading stocks in every cycle. It's just so, it's so interesting. Like you could look at these leading, these, these stocks, and they turn to these leaders and it lasts for like that six months to a year and a half, typically, is like the cycle. And the charts just have a look. Like the way their volatility, you know, comes down and they trend and so like even in past cycles, even though it lasted longer, you had a lot of stocks that I mean think of dot com, right? They came out and was like, boom, boom, boom, like just like these fast spikes and moves and then those are certain styles of stocks. So the fast wild stuff has been seen in different ways. So it depends how adaptable you are. But like I don't think the compressed timeframe is going to change the dynamics of how they operate. I mean, you can see even arm recently came out IPO, being a nice base, had that explosion move. Same within video, all the rest, you went up, you based, you went up, you based and you went up again. So recently, I was trading Taiwan semi similar. You kind of broke out, you pulled back your averages and you like you, you had this last late move. So I think the patterns are going to be the same. I think that's the strength of like this process. I, you know, it's a, you know, like, you know, can slim growth investing. It's not like a big secret. I think it works. The hard part is just bringing everything together. Like there's no secret. There's no like super secret. It's just, it's just hard like to balance everything and everything always looks easier in hindsight. It's like an athlete. You can look at like a baseball player and say, okay, I can hit a baseball. Yeah, I know with the guy's story at 102 miles an hour, like it's a different than when someone's lobbing it to you and like the home field and you're knocking it out. You know, so it's one of those things like seems easy on the surface, but it just takes a lot of effort to make sure that every part of your system works cohesively. So you don't, you don't kind of mess it up at any point because if you get one part wrong, like let's see, risk management is no good or position size is no good or market trend is no good. It's like, you're screwed up. It's like a car and your brakes don't work or your accelerators don't, your accelerators don't work. Like one piece can't be broken or it's not going to work. That's the hard part. You're a great way to frame it. And especially for a system like yours, which is kind of predicated on consolidated positioning, but looking for big moves has kind of the past year been difficult or have you adjusted your sizing at all or has it been kind of similar entry size protocols as you typically would run? So it's pretty similar. Just there's been a lot of chop. So it's, you know, again, if you look at the like the NASDAQ 100, it looks easier in the past year than for what the experience is for most other stocks out there that haven't had the large cap feel. So there's been a lot of chop under this like everyone forgets like last March, there was a banking panic and all this other stuff that was like going on that people forget about, you know, because like the market's been strong lately, but there's been a lot of chop, you know, so I typically try and stay with normal positioning, but if I'm a little bit less like certain or the market's been a little more difficult, I just like cut them into a few smaller buys. But I still like, so like, you know, when I start a position, I want to get at least 10% into a position. If I'm uncertain with markets, I'll start at five, six percent, but I force myself that's going my way to get to where I need to get to. So I don't just get smaller and stay smaller. Maybe I'll start smaller, but then I'll force my way in if it's working. That way, at least if it's a chopping environment, you're not just getting cut the pieces. Yeah. And so when you're thinking about your buy campaigns, what's the timeframe that you're employing between like your first entry at 10% or whatever the desirable is, and then the subsequent entries that you're using. So I like to kind of build into a stock over, let's say, one or two weeks, typically. And when you get things right, like usually I found that the markets move in these nice like three to five month cycles, where like you'll get these big, powerful moves and the stocks go crazy. And then the good stocks will base and have another one again, some will just top and you won't hear from them anymore. So that's so like my personal like ideal favorite. And it doesn't always capture the whole move, but my ideal favorite is kind of build over one to two weeks. You know, we'll do that over a few stocks when the markets coming out of a correction. And then three to four, five months later, you're selling most of that stuff off. Like if you look back historically at all the bull markets, you get these strong waves and these small, these corrections and then another wave. And it really comes in these waves. Did you show me a little bit about the way that you might play something like arm historically? The reason why I ask is because one of the things I find honestly so fascinating about the way that you trade is, well, I think a lot of traders in general, you eventually turn the corner where you're not afraid to buy something that's gone up, right? That's kind of like a base level. You got to get that sooner. It kind of thing. But what I find really interesting about the way that your trading is for me, like the process of doing that over like a week or two weeks, I would struggle with that. But I imagine my my holding time is probably way shorter than yours. So I imagine that's why there's like that dissonance in my mind. But yeah, I was just curious if maybe we could take a look at arm or really whatever else. I can grab anything that you want. And I just want to explore what that that looks like. So this is a good one because this is one I actually put on recently. So if you kind of, if you can move the chart a little more to the left, like at the IPO period, you want to go further back in time? Yeah, further back. Let's say last fall, last October, one. Okay, it's a little bit of a scrunch chart. Do you want to go all out and zoom in over here? Yeah, that area up until let's say February. I don't know if you can yeah, like that would be great. Yeah, I don't know if you can adjust the scale on the right or make it a lot longer. Yeah, okay, that's better. Yeah. So, you know, and you bring up a good point too because a lot of people will ask me like, you know, Matt, you are a market maker, you're a day trader, like you must have these great insights from like intraday and and it brought a lot of help because I could see how why patterns form. Like it's one thing to learn the theory, but to really see why they form that way. But to your point, it took me a long time to go from like making 200 trades in a day to like holding a stock for three months. Like for us, you know, people who never scraped the shorter term side, it's like, wow, it was three was three months. But when you're used to like being in and out over and over and over to like sit with a stock and you have this open profit and you're just watching it like bobble up and down. It's like psychologically, it's a very hard. Yes, transition to make, but that's a discussion for another day, I guess. So, so this example here, so you can see how we looking at like that see that low at 46 in a half there that's sticking out. So that was kind of the corrective phase. And as we kind of start to work up the right side, yeah, until like I think I'm not what averages are those Eric that let's see that. You mean the moving averages or the yeah, so there's probably more than we need. But there's like a 10, 20, 50, and then a 150, this really dark one. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, so when we ran up to that 50 the first time, you can see like yeah, so like yeah, so that's kind of where I put my first initial positioning on. And then after as I kind of consolidated for a few days and we had that other like kind of large candle that broke high or I kind of added to the position. And then we went up one more time when we kind of had that sideways consolidation, we kind of put that handle on the right side of the base. And so as I broke out of there on that, I kind of finished off the buy. So this, this is actually I told you earlier, like I think nine out of 11 stocks gaped down for me like on the recent earnings the season, this is one that gaped up for me. So I this this kind of ran up at the earnings that had puts for protection. And I actually have an IPO sell rule that I used, first of us from experience and I went back to study and I saw how it was helpful. But basically if I buy a stock coming out of a recent IPO and it goes up, let's say 80 to 100% from about the middle of the base, I'll just sell it into strength. Because then typically you have the, you know, the the lock up expiry comes and you have people who have stocked from pennies who just want to take their big profit and buy their mansion. So just naturally you get that bad break a couple of months later and it has to reset up like like arm ended up doing. So I kind of built that up in those stages on the way up. And then after coming out of that earnings, actually that first big candle that launched that of earnings, I sold that into like the one 15 120 area. And then two days later, the next morning I was happy when it opened back at 100 and then the next day I was miserable. So I went to 160. But then ultimately I think it fell back down to like 80 something and now we had another another recent leg up again. Yeah. So then that so this bad break you can see there that that's most IPOs if you look here if they're successful longer term, there's always like after that initial like double that really nasty break where insiders like they if you bought if you got a stock as an employee at a dollar. And you know, you suddenly have this multi million dollar like are do you care if you're selling at 120 or 110 or 105 you just want to take the money before this appears. So they end up having this really aggressive seller that comes to market after an IPO. And then does your original thesis maintain are you looking to then enter back in or do you view this as it made my move I'm going elsewhere? No. So I mean like the young stocks are usually the nice stock. So once it has that like bad post IPO break, it can set up again. Just needs to kind of set up a nice structure. This was a bit odd because it kind of had that bad break into April and then just kind of like roll back up to new high. So it wasn't like a traditional way way to typically do. I mean there's always a random variation. So I didn't catch the second way. I was playing with it a couple of days and I got knocked out of it and ended up pulling without me. But they can set up again and have like nice continued legs. You just want to avoid that first nasty bad break after the IPO. Yeah, it's actually really interesting to hear the way that you played it because this was where I ended up getting in. But well not nice, right? As I listen to you getting in here and then doubling right I'm getting pennies on the dollar like a freaking peasant. But I guess that's that is the beauty of trying to find derivatives is you don't need quite as much of a move in order to be happy with it. But it's not always especially in stuff like this like newer products. Sometimes they don't offer derivatives. Sometimes they're not liquid. So you kind of get priced out of some of those moves. Now when you're looking at this, what would be the way you view reentry? Is this something that is kind of like on a watch list that you revisit until it sets up and it's lower on your priority list because there's other stuff that's kind of at a more advantageous stage of its growth. I'm curious how you kind of cycle through your stable of stocks that you conducted your original analysis on. You'd like it. You traded it. You got your exit. But the overall thesis may be the essentially the same. Yeah, so I keep like a general list. Like now there's about 100 stocks on it where like there's two like like there's two criteria. Like I want those that have a good fundamental story behind them and or that they're showing really great relative strength. So I feel like the ones that actually trade have both. But you know, if you don't keep them on a list and watch them, sometimes things change and you just miss them. So I keep this big list. So for example, arm is one where it's ever since I traded state on my list as a watch because the fundamentals, the growth that trajectory is all fantastic, but it had that bad break. So then you're looking for other opportunities, but you're still a daily weekly review is still coming up in your process. It makes sense too, especially because the way that you explain what you think that break comes from to me, that would be a non factor then, right? If it's just a bunch of insiders that are wanting to unwind their position, I mean, I don't care. That doesn't change the fundamental picture of it. If that's the. You know, it's my speaking to like what we spoke about before I was saying people asked, like, you know, did your experiences of market maker and stuff help? Like I think that's somewhere like a situation like that helps because you can see the impact of like, you know, again, like you go to school and everyone talks about efficient market and like rational investor and like then you've seen like you're like trading short-term, you see fills where people are just like selling a stock but at a ridiculous way. I mean, like saying, why don't you take your time? You would have gotten like such a better exit because for some people their motivation is not about best price execution. Their motivation and you see that it could be an institution needs to liquidate or I mean, I've seen all kinds of crazy stuff over the years where like their forced liquidation or what where sometimes it's not best price is not the priority. It's just get me out now. I want it now because I want to vote or because I'm forced to visit a legal proceeding or whatever. So it's interesting. So for some people like they can't understand like why would somebody do that? Everyone has their their their pushes and a lot of time it's not the rational investor mindset, you know, and I always joke like I know like investors aren't rational because I've been irrational myself enough times that I've broken the I've broken the model. So the market can't be that that efficient. Well, it's funny too. I've been following the whole GameStop saga just from specifically to rotas perspective. It's been absolutely fascinating. And somebody they asked me a question about like the there's GameStop right now is at like 2559 and they were asking about these 125 calls that expire tomorrow that expired tomorrow. Are they worth it? And they're massive open interest in these 125 calls that yes, I'll hold on I'll show it to you because it's amazing. It's hilarious. I hope it's at least worth pennies. I mean, I hope it's literally it's big. It's been at a penny offered at two. It's to come all the way down here. Look at this. 113,000 OI on this 125 call. First of all, you can still get I feel like that's a free penny. I mean, obviously, I like and what I try to explain to people, you know, they're really fascinated by the implied volatility of these really far out of the money options. And I try to explain to them one, this is telling you that if you're buying this, you are buying this at a crazy price relative to what it is. The second thing is this kind of can be indicative from a market making perspective, how they view their risk, right? Because if you look at something like Apple, it'll still have kind of a crazy smile where if I close this down, like you can still see even in a near term expiration, it'll have a big smile, right? Where the out of the money puts there are over 2000% IV. But you don't typically see, you know, the call side quite as high. But GameStop is one of those crazy, crazy products that it's just been wild to watch. I mean, from a market making perspective, that is going to be like a field day. Yeah, it's wild. I mean, it can be dangerous. A lot of guys get a lot of stuff like that because, well, now people understand, but like, and I know everyone was reeling on the guys who were short. And I think they were like abusing the short perspective. Like they really were. They still are. Yeah, they still are. So like they're wrong in that perspective. But like you can't, I mean, assuming the person's not like abusing their power as a short, like I've seen like Mark and make your sometimes they just get on the wrong side. They have no idea stories coming and they get run over. And like the poor guy was just like, oh, he's just putting his trade on. He's not trying to manipulate markets. And the guy trying to make a market months of work because of some random, you know, like so I've seen both sides. I could have some sense of, you know, sadness for the market maker sometimes. You know, I've seen that side of things. Well, especially from the retail side on this thing, I think there's a little bit of, you know, just angst towards like the institutions. And the market makers, they can play games. I'm sure you know that, right? But I mean, it's to the extent order flow still dictates the vast majority of their day. So yeah, it's this kind of thing's really interesting to watch. But pivoting out real quick, when we first spoke, well, two times ago, we were talking about the Fed and what the Fed was doing interest rate environment. Then the last time we spoke, I think the market was still looking at three cuts, still pricing in three cuts. Big change. And now the market's looking at two, Fed's still talking about one. What do you make of the rate environment and the impact? I think, well, I look, I always like to say that the Federal Reserve, the Federal Fund's rate should just fall the US two-year yield. Like ultimately, that's always where it gets to. And if they're too far below it, like they were like in post-financial crisis, it's like you're creating an asset bubble. If you're too far above it, like you were going to the financial crisis or like other periods, like you're creating like economic weakness. So, you know, you have this big board of people, which really all they should just do is let the market decide the right interest rate, which is the capital is free market way and the right way to do it. But if you look at, so if you look at the current way, like the two-year yield is as come off and it's quite, it's about, I think it's three quarters of a point below Federal Fund's more or less. And I think again, so much is adjusted or is affected by this large cap tech rally because if you look anywhere else, I think you can really see the economic weakness building. So if you look at the Canadian market, it's soft. If you look at even US market equal weight or small caps or even S&P equal weight, I mean, it hasn't done a whole lot for a number of months. If you look at European markets where they have like no technology sector, like France, I think last week fell like 10% Germany fell 6, 7% Italian markets fell more. So I mean, like obviously, it's a completely different type of economy. But if you want to look at like the non tech component, like just pure economy, it's probably a better representation just for the fact that it doesn't have that distorted effects of Nvidia Microsoft Apple. So I think, and I think that's why ECB cut a quarter point, why can't it cut a quarter point? Because I think they're starting to see like, you know, when trying to balance the risks of inflation and economic weakness, it's not so clear a distinction anymore that inflation is the only the biggest problem. Like inflation is getting closer to 2%. But and I think at the same time, there's not necessarily like we are actually getting weakness, you know, by the time like it comes through, it's always late, you know, before it would realize it, but I think you are seeing that I think most stocks are reflecting that. It just so happens that, you know, the cohort of seven, you know, magnificent seven stocks are in a world of their own and that distorts things. But everything else, I think, is starting to reflect the economic weakness. And so I think from that perspective, looking at the two-year yield, I think the Fed is probably becoming a bit slow to kind of remove the restrictive stance. I know it's like from Powell's and this is from Powell's perspective. If you put yourself in his shoes, it's easier and he said this, it's easier to revive a weak economy than it is to stop inflation, as we've seen. Inflation is very sticky. So I think he would rather, and if you put yourself in his shoes, it kind of, I probably would want to do the same thing. You're a little more willing to like make things break a little bit, you can say, okay, here's some QE, here's some lower rates, everyone we're, we're fine. That's a lot easier to stop than once inflation gets inside people's minds and it's just self-fulfilling prophecy. So I think they probably see that things are starting to soften, but they're willing to, to play to the risk that the economy weakens without having inflation get away from them. Yeah, I agree with that. And the other thing I was thinking about anyways is just the timeline, right? Like if we, if the market is still pressing into cuts, which is what I saw last time from the bond markets or the, the bond futures, and I just, I think we're running out of time for that, man, because when I'm considering the way that the Fed has played this so far, they've obviously been kind of slow rolling and kind of for a lot of the reasons that you were just outlining. But then I look at, whenever they make their first cut, the probability of there being a second cut in the very next meeting, I have to imagine is very low, unless the economy is showing massive signs of weakness. When you think about laying the potential cut, well, is that anything that you are looking to play? Anyways, it sounds like it might not even be necessarily a big impact to the stuff you're trading, but I'm curious if you have a play around it. Well, yeah, just like for myself, I mean, so like most stuff I do is kind of growth-related, but I'm starting to look at some of like just, you know, there's different accounts that I have. Like, so I think some of the high dividend payers are going to be attractive, because I think if the economic slowness comes in and those of these stocks have not done great, but I imagine a lot of them will start to kind of get a bid, as interest rates fall, the yield will become even more and you're going to get that kind of realignment. I think you'll get like that cap, but basically it's like a bond proxy. And I think you're trying to see like even the TLT, which is like another bond ETF, trying to make that higher low. So I think that's probably the way you play it. I think if the market does correct, but then after ultimately this drop in rates is going to support the more speculative side of the market as well, because like all this time, that's why it's been large-cast because what high rates anything speculative is under pressure. And and so I think when rates fall, that'll be another kind of notch in the belt for more speculative growth as well. So I'm starting to kind of look to see who would win coming out of that. And that's kind of the bond proxies and that is just a treat I'm looking at as well. Yeah, yeah, it's funny. It's it's so whenever I talk to you, man, like there's so many parallels, we just have a slightly different way of like approaching markets. But I've even in the beginning of this year, I was long small caps. I was long bonds trying to front-run a little bit of that uptick that we first thought the cut was going to be a march. Then they moved it. Then they moved it. Then I was just like, all right, man, fine. I'll take the trays a lower. I'll move the capital somewhere else. I'll go be a D Gen and load up and T triple Q's. Y'all twist my arm. But yeah, just the way that you're thinking about it is honestly very, very similar to mine. I think what I found interesting so far has been the dissonance between the market and what the Fed has actually done. Because I typically think the Fed and the market align a little more closely based on historic references that I saw in terms of kind of like policy messaging and then follow through. And this seems like a pretty big disparity. Last question for you. When you're looking at the rest of the year, what are you most interested in falling long? I think the election is going to have a big impact. Interesting. I don't want to get into politics. But I think, again, whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, I always try to talk from an economic perspective. From an economic perspective, lower taxes is just better for the economy and the stock market. Because I think lower taxes, economics 101 is taxes. There's a dead weight loss to a tax. The government kind of has to tax you and their poor allocators of resources than the individual is who actually earned it. So I think cutting tax will help. I don't know if Trump gets reelected, but I know Biden is not popular. I think if there is a change, I think people will, whether it's whether Trump gets a nomination or whatever. I think just from an economic perspective, that'll probably put a jolt I think into the economy. And I think that's why in 2016, he had his big tax cut plans, which he did put through, which helped the economy and all that. I think if you look at Canada where we've had like higher taxes, there's raised a capital gains tax. And like, I always like to say, these things, like people think these are long term things or you know, it's not to want to help others, but I think it's, does this service to everyone because look at its productivity is the worst of the G7 now. We are one of the best and now we're dead last in the G, I mean, Italy's doing better than us. You know what I mean? Like all these countries that you would think that you wouldn't think of as having stronger growth economies are doing better in terms of productivity in the rest. So you better be careful throwing shade at Italy because if I'm not mistaken, you might be checking them out soon. Yeah, exactly. I'm going down in July. I'm going to do my economic inspection. That's why I'm going. Yeah, well, you better be careful over there. You might run into a few dudes. Be high. I have some families, some areas. I have to make sure not to go to the local towns. I'll I'll get I'll get thrown out. But you know, so like, but these economic policies have a real impact, like maybe not week to week, but looking over a year, two years and the market's going to respond. And so I think that could be, I think if you get the catalyst, I mean, if you look at a perfect world of like, let's say taxes coming down or, you know, and I think this is where even, you know, Trump, I think his policy, he was a big, big, big spender. So you know, that that was maybe a negative. The government spends too much to become too big a part of the economy. So that's not, I'm not saying I'm a rating fan of either side, I was trying to stay politically neutral and in talks, but just at least it on the tax side, if you figure if you get like any help from tax, then after you get falling interest rates and you get a technological revolution, I mean, you have three things like pushing in the same direction and you get inflation under control. So you get like back to stable currency, lower rates, hopefully better, better taxes and a technology, that like sets up like a really promising 2025. So like, I think in a perfect world, because we've had a big run to indexes, because of the big cat tech, you were acting to September, October, and then you get all of these catalysts at once, like Fed cutting and I think I think 2025 could be a really exciting year. You heard it here first. Plus also everybody, don't forget to clip that part about Matt talking trash about Italy's productivity. Gotta make sure that gets out there. But Matt, as always, man, absolute pleasure hanging out with you, chat and markets with you is one of my favorite things. It's always really enlightening. I love the historical references, honestly, that you bring, because markets obviously evolve, but there's always a lot of similarities. So thanks for sharing a lot of your experience with us today. As always, I'll throw links to your website, to your ex or Twitter, whatever I'm supposed to call it in the notes below. But is there anywhere else that you want people to go check out? YouTube as well. I can check Rousseau. I've been putting you, I put a video whenever I give a chance to put something together. Yeah, perfect. I'll tag you in this too, so it'll pop up on yours. Awesome. All right, guys, we will see you all later on.
