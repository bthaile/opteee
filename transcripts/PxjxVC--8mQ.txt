0.00s: I'm going to be back.
2.00s: What's up everyone?
3.00s: Welcome back to the
4.00s: All-Ir podcast.
5.00s: I have a familiar face.
6.00s: My friend Matt Caruso from
8.00s: Crucio Insights,
9.00s: which is a fantastic game,
10.00s: by the way.
11.00s: I use a similar name for my
12.00s: newsletter.
13.00s: Great minds.
14.00s: Think alike.
15.00s: Good to see you, my friend.
16.00s: How are you?
17.00s: I'm good.
18.00s: Thanks for having me back Eric.
19.00s: Appreciate it.
20.00s: And I have to the blast.
21.00s: So we were just talking about
23.00s: how there's so much money
25.00s: flowing out of your pockets
27.00s: that you just can't get into
29.00s: and obviously I say that in
31.00s: in just for people.
32.00s: But it reminds me.
33.00s: Did you see that comment that
34.00s: warm buffet made pretty
35.00s: recently about some of the
36.00s: stuff that he's trying to do
37.00s: with his money?
38.00s: One of the, I think at the
39.00s: shareholders meeting,
40.00s: they were saying like,
41.00s: you know, why do you have so
43.00s: much money and cash?
44.00s: Because it's a few
45.00s: billion dollars.
46.00s: And his response was perfect.
47.00s: His response was,
48.00s: I don't think anybody
49.00s: knows what to do with a
50.00s: billion dollars.
51.00s: So.
52.00s: You know, it's interesting.
53.00s: You also had another
54.00s: interesting comment because I
55.00s: didn't watch the whole thing
56.00s: by the kind of like the highlight
58.00s: really, I guess, you know.
59.00s: And someone asked him if you
60.00s: were younger or if you had less
61.00s: capital, what would you do?
62.00s: And it kind of goes back to
63.00s: what you and I were talking about
64.00s: like the highest
66.00s: rate, the consistent returns
67.00s: is that, you know,
68.00s: you're limited by scale at a
69.00s: certain point.
70.00s: But he was saying he's
71.00s: confident that he could go
72.00s: around and find like a lot of
74.00s: goods like small,
75.00s: but like, you know,
76.00s: these 30, 40, 50% per year
78.00s: return.
79.00s: But they're small.
80.00s: You, you can't scale.
81.00s: And like, I don't even say
82.00s: in the tens of millions of
84.00s: billions or billions.
85.00s: Definitely not billion.
86.00s: But, you know, things are out
87.00s: there if you hustle, you know,
88.00s: but when you got a few
89.00s: billion, it's a different.
90.00s: You know, people like the
91.00s: kind of chastise that the big
92.00s: hedge fund guys or what?
93.00s: But when you're trading, you
94.00s: know, a few thousand, a few
95.00s: hundred thousand, a few
96.00s: million and you're trading five
97.00s: billion, it's a, it's a
98.00s: different volume.
99.00s: Yeah, it's one of those things
100.00s: that I feel like traders
101.00s: don't really think, I know I
102.00s: didn't, I didn't think enough
103.00s: of it. And again, like we were
104.00s: right before we were talking,
105.00s: we were talking a little bit
106.00s: about scale.
107.00s: And I think that's what I
108.00s: really wanted to say.
109.00s: I think that's what I
111.00s: really wanted to say.
112.00s: I think that's what I really
113.00s: wanted to say.
114.00s: I think that's what I really
115.00s: wanted to say.
116.00s: I think that's what I really
117.00s: wanted to say.
118.00s: I think that's what I really
119.00s: wanted to say.
120.00s: And again, like we were right
121.00s: before we were talking, we're
122.00s: talking a little bit about
123.00s: scale.
124.00s: And it's not like I'm trading
125.00s: at this massive scale, even
126.00s: shadow of what those guys are.
127.00s: And I still run into liquid,
128.00s: especially in the options
129.00s: markets.
130.00s: I mean, that is, that's one of
131.00s: the really tricky parts
132.00s: actually about derivatives
133.00s: is a lot of people
134.00s: to talk about.
135.00s: Oh, like, you know, what should
136.00s: I trade?
137.00s: What should I look at?
138.00s: And it's just like once
139.00s: you know, what should I do.
140.00s: And it's like, you know, the
141.00s: thing that is really
143.00s: really is quite naturally
144.00s: really is quite naturally
145.00s: limiting by itself.
146.00s: Now, I imagine for your
147.00s: progression from kind of the
148.00s: really small stocks and
149.00s: other things that fit the
150.00s: portfolio better that there
152.00s: probably more suitable
153.00s: alternatives or is that
154.00s: overselling it you think?
156.00s: What do you mean by that
157.00s: there, I mean, you could
158.00s: rephrase that when you go
159.00s: from your kind of small
160.00s: group of, you know, smaller
162.00s: stocks and you start looking at
164.00s: like the next level of
165.00s: market cap that fits the
166.00s: portfolio is there a lot to
167.00s: pick from or is it
168.00s: Or is it that starts scoping down really fast?
171.36s: I think if you're in an individual investor,
174.72s: there's still a large amount of scope.
177.60s: I think once you start getting into the hedge funds situation,
181.20s: it changes liquidity become, I mean, I think that's why,
183.52s: in video, in all these AI studies,
185.96s: mega has that have been running so hot,
187.60s: this disparity between those and everything else.
190.24s: I think they're getting multiple tailwind.
192.32s: One is obviously the whole AI theme and what that could do,
195.20s: but I think the liquidity part is pulling them in.
198.80s: I mean, if you're a hedge fund guy or whatever,
200.60s: anyone big fund and you want to have exposure to the space,
204.56s: I mean, Vitya is like, you don't get more liquid than that.
206.72s: So they also get liquidity premium and all of that.
209.24s: So definitely, definitely health,
210.80s: but if you're a smaller investor,
212.24s: there's still a wide space that you can play with for sure.
216.20s: Yeah, I imagine.
217.16s: And talk to me about that so far.
219.12s: I think we connected, like, first quarter of this year,
221.56s: I try to do quarterly with,
223.36s: is like people like you that I like.
226.24s: And just see, like how the years playing out.
229.20s: And I think if I recall correctly,
230.80s: you know, towards the beginning of the year,
232.48s: it was a little bit of kind of back and forth,
234.72s: like trying to find good opportunities.
236.76s: How's that played out since last week's spoke?
239.44s: So I ended up getting positioned a lot of good names.
242.60s: So that's a really great action.
244.88s: Actually, it's fine.
245.72s: We were talking last call about using options
247.84s: to hedge for a lot of these things, which I was using.
249.92s: And kind of in a good way,
251.80s: because the earning season was not kind.
253.72s: I think I counted just recently,
255.20s: nine out of about 11 stocks,
256.96s: like gap down on earnings for me.
258.52s: So, you know, I know it's,
260.32s: if you say bad luck, but I hate luck.
263.08s: I feel like if you think bad luck,
264.28s: you start to invite it into your life.
266.20s: It's really just, you know, the probability curve.
268.24s: I just, I'm on the wrong side of the bell curve.
271.08s: It's a bad order.
272.36s: But, you know what, like, thankfully,
273.68s: I mean, jokes aside, the earnings hedges
275.80s: made it like, okay, it was, I mean, it's not the,
277.84s: you know, it was frustrating because, like,
280.36s: the way I like to kind of build exposure,
281.92s: build positions, it takes some time to do that together.
284.60s: So if you get kind of knocked out of a lot of positions
286.80s: in earning season and then markets were still strong,
288.96s: it's a little more difficult to like,
290.52s: immediately reposition.
291.96s: So it was kind of unfortunate that they didn't kind of like,
294.24s: gap and run our way, which would have been fantastic.
296.36s: But then also kind of forcing the repositioning.
298.96s: So it's been tricky, but, you know,
301.64s: it's one of the main tools I rely on
303.56s: is like the net highs and that lows
305.04s: that tell me like, what kind of environment we're in.
307.08s: I use it all the time.
308.40s: It's been super helpful because like,
309.92s: there's been a lot of, I mean,
311.04s: just recently, I had this leg up in the eye,
312.56s: like that kind of propelled everything.
314.04s: But besides that, if you're a trend follower,
316.16s: which is where I fall, like the past two, three months
319.12s: have been like deadly chop.
320.48s: So like, thankfully, like I was able to kind of
322.28s: sidestep all that chop and all that kind of frustration.
325.24s: So, you know, I could play too much.
326.52s: I went, when I hit the opposite of the,
328.68s: the bell curve of earnings reports,
330.24s: it'll be a different conversation.
332.96s: Have you, one of the things I noticed
334.88s: because that's actually one of the early connecting points,
337.72s: I think between you and I's net highs and lows,
339.56s: I haven't found like a ton of people that used it
341.56s: and it's something I've always used.
343.48s: That like accumulation distribution,
345.76s: tick and train like those kinds of things.
347.20s: I've always liked those for breadth indicators.
349.60s: And one of the things I noticed really interesting
351.68s: for net highs lows was the disparity
353.96s: between NASDAQ and the NYC, the New York Stock Exchange.
357.80s: What do you make of that?
359.76s: So, you know, it's, I think it's a really versatile tool
362.68s: that I think people may be like sometimes misinterpreted
364.76s: or they don't get all everything they can out of it.
366.36s: I think right, some people kind of clump it all together
368.52s: to get a reading.
369.48s: I like having them separate because the NASDAQ and NYC stocks,
373.64s: they really kind of reflect like the different types
377.00s: of trends in the market, like the more speculative
378.64s: versus the more mature, that's the way I like to look at it.
381.40s: And so you can see like, lately it's been very weak
383.56s: on the NASDAQ side of things
384.80s: because I really apart from the large caps,
387.20s: everything else has been pretty weak.
389.44s: But you know, even rather than kind of think of it
391.28s: like as a bull market, bear market indicator,
393.44s: for me it's kind of, it's almost more of like
395.32s: an easy money, hard money indicator.
397.32s: Because that's really what I think,
398.60s: because I mean, you know, it's not nothing's perfect.
400.44s: Sometimes you know, we could have a few net loads
402.00s: and we kind of turn around, we bounce the other way
403.64s: or there's net highs and we roll over.
405.16s: But like the way I look at it is just like,
406.88s: if you look at any environment, if you have net highs,
409.56s: it's probably like a much easier money environment
411.84s: because what it's really measuring
413.96s: is measuring like net liquidity flows.
416.00s: You know, if more stocks are making 52 week highs and lows,
418.40s: like you have net money coming into the market.
420.72s: If it's the opposite, like, I mean now,
423.08s: just recently if you've been in a few large caps,
425.04s: I mean, it's great, you're not complaining,
426.76s: but most other stocks have really been struggling.
429.48s: So I think a lot of people will look at a vast decline.
432.60s: I mean, in all these kind of things
433.96s: and just like take a hard stance of like,
436.12s: I need to be a bearer, I need to be a bull.
438.44s: That's dangerous man,
439.32s: because if you look at, for example,
440.52s: the advanced decline line,
441.96s: another like a breath indicator people like,
444.88s: like that top to 1998 and the market top to 2000.
448.64s: So if you were like screaming at the screen saying like,
451.16s: you know, we have more declares than available.
452.84s: I mean, you missed a whole dot com round,
454.36s: like who wants to miss dot com, you know?
455.96s: So like what I also like,
458.12s: and that's kind of what I like about net highs lows too,
460.28s: a little more than like just a pure divergence,
462.16s: like a vast decline is, you know,
464.68s: at vast decline, like that divergence can stay active
467.40s: for a long time while the trend persists.
469.64s: Like now we've had a bit of a disparity
471.40s: between net highs and net lows in the market,
474.32s: but usually that disparities very short live
477.12s: because if it is a healthy market,
478.40s: you'll get a few more stocks making new highs.
480.20s: It'll turn the corner much, much quicker.
481.92s: So I find it's a more versatile tool,
484.28s: but you have to put in context.
485.44s: Instead of it being like this,
487.00s: I think it's like we're all trained from sports.
488.56s: Like we all have like our home team that we like,
490.28s: you know, either I'm a bull or I'm a bear
492.04s: and like people like really identify as that
494.52s: when that's their viewpoint.
495.88s: I think just be more flexible.
497.28s: I think it's like easy dollar environment
498.80s: or hard dollar environment.
499.68s: So how do you want to play?
501.32s: I think the part also that I would tack on to that
504.24s: is I find the longer I'm in markets,
506.32s: the more I find people really are just interested
508.68s: in simple explanations.
511.12s: What's the one thing I can look at
512.60s: that gives me all the information, right?
514.16s: And kind of to your point that one thing isn't,
516.68s: it's not there.
517.52s: Maybe stock price maybe, right?
518.84s: Up, down, that's one thing.
521.20s: But yeah, I feel like whenever I talk to people
524.40s: about those kinds of things,
525.56s: I find that same lack of nuance.
528.24s: And to me, that's actually where a lot of the opportunities
531.04s: kind of emerge.
533.12s: Because especially for me,
534.20s: the way I will use any sort of breath indicator
538.12s: that has lows, whatever it is.
540.12s: It's not like a binary choice for me.
542.84s: It's positive or negative.
544.32s: I'm long, I'm short.
545.60s: Exactly as you're outlining,
547.16s: it's more of kind of an informative tool
549.36s: against the rest of what you see.
551.40s: Because you can still find plenty of periods.
553.84s: I run a massive study that overlays net highs lows
558.52s: with the price of all the different indices and sectors,
562.16s: just to see how well they line up.
564.56s: And like any sort of oscillator-ish indicator,
568.40s: there's a lot of noise in it.
569.68s: And understanding how to interpret those periods
572.80s: of noise becomes really important.
575.20s: And I always think like overlaying it
578.04s: with what you're seeing on the actual charts
580.60s: and the rest of the market tends to be a pretty good exercise.
584.60s: When you're thinking about analyzing,
588.00s: let's say right now, for example,
590.36s: the NASDAQ, the net lows, not super crazy low,
595.48s: but definitely trending below zero for a little while now.
601.12s: What do you look for in that data,
603.48s: especially against when you look at something
605.68s: like the S&P 500, which just made essentially new highs again?
609.92s: How do you kind of layer those two?
612.12s: So you always want to find like,
613.16s: what's the trend of this cycle?
614.88s: So like, to me, it's an important data point
619.00s: because it just kind of like, it cuts through the noise,
622.20s: 52-week higher lows and important event.
624.04s: It's not like I'd vast the client,
625.44s: like any stock of yep, and nickel today,
627.36s: or down, and nickel, and that counts,
628.52s: they can up or down.
629.88s: I mean, like generally more stocks are breaking down,
631.88s: but this cycle is just, it's kind of odd where
635.04s: it just so happens that the stocks that are like exploding
637.56s: happen to be the largest market cap stocks
639.40s: in the world at the same time.
640.48s: So anyone kind of stepping back,
642.40s: if you're just forcing trades,
643.96s: so if you look at this, you know,
645.24s: a blind see, but the market's up,
646.32s: so I need to be long,
647.16s: but you're forcing trades in all the wrong groups,
650.44s: you're getting run over.
651.44s: Is that the chop is immense?
653.08s: If you're trying to buy breakouts
654.32s: and anything that hasn't been working.
655.64s: So for me, it's just kind of like,
656.48s: okay, we're in this hard dollar environment.
658.92s: At least let me figure out where the money's flowing.
660.68s: And once you see that,
661.52s: then you can kind of piece together the stories.
662.80s: Not always easy at the beginning of a trend,
664.64s: but I think it's been pretty clear for like a few weeks,
667.04s: if you're throwing money at anything except AI large cap tech,
670.84s: I mean, you're not getting anywhere.
671.96s: I mean, in fact, if you look at a lot of industrial stocks
673.92s: in the rest of the day,
674.92s: they've been like already in some, you know,
676.48s: decent science corrections.
678.32s: So for me, it's just,
679.36s: it's really just about understanding
681.80s: what's really going on in the market,
683.40s: because the indexes,
685.00s: they're not as descriptive as these.
686.64s: The concentration's too high.
688.12s: Like it's weird.
689.64s: I never thought I would say this,
690.84s: but like the Dow 30,
692.28s: the Dow industrial is 30,
693.64s: because it's like a price weighted index,
696.36s: probably gives like a better like diversified look at stocks
700.24s: than like the Nasak or S&P.
701.52s: I was actually,
702.36s: I was having this special with a friend of mine recently.
704.40s: If you're like trying to bring a new fund to market
707.52s: and you want to sell it to retail,
710.20s: and you tell like that the product office,
711.88s: you're like,
712.72s: but you know what,
713.56s: I have like three stocks at 30%.
715.20s: He's gonna say like you're too concentrated.
716.56s: You know, we can't offer that to retail.
718.36s: But then after like the stock market itself has like basically,
722.16s: you know, three stocks being 25, 26% of the total index.
725.84s: So the concentration's off the charts.
728.16s: I mean, how far along the last, hard to know.
731.08s: I mean, it's interesting,
731.92s: because then after it always the,
733.72s: I know I'm kind of going off topic,
734.92s: but people always kind of say like,
735.76s: oh, maybe this time is different.
737.04s: Maybe like the large companies will like dominate
739.16s: unlike before.
741.24s: You know, it's always the young upstarts
742.40s: and ultimately kind of,
743.72s: I mean, if you kind of look at this current cycle,
745.52s: how was it all kicked off?
746.60s: It was all kicked off with open AI.
748.32s: And I mean, they kind of like,
749.32s: it's just that, you know,
750.32s: then all these other stocks are benefiting
751.64s: from the infrastructure play,
752.72s: but it was like this new upstart
754.04s: who kind of shook up what AI
757.04s: and turned it into like a generative AI we can all use.
759.12s: So I mean,
760.16s: the other, the largest group in the world,
761.68s: they'll probably keep, keep doing well and growing
763.76s: because they have such a long inroads.
765.44s: But I still,
767.64s: I still look to see who the next big players
769.64s: are going to be to kind of shake things.
770.56s: That's where the really monster percentage needs will be.
774.16s: Especially from your perspective of stock trading.
777.80s: I mean, like trying to make sure that, yeah.
781.16s: It's,
782.16s: it's actually funny listening to that,
783.56s: because it reminds me that I kind of probably play
785.88s: the game a little bit on an easier mode,
788.88s: just in that one single sense options
791.00s: or by no means easier to be clear for most people,
793.92s: they add a tremendous amount of complexity.
796.20s: But the one good part is,
798.56s: you can create leverage out of thin air,
800.44s: essentially, just kind of there.
803.60s: So when you're kind of looking through trying to find
807.20s: these different leaders now,
811.56s: what's that looking like for you?
813.20s: Where are they?
815.04s: There's only one place.
816.04s: It's been the AI,
817.84s: yeah, large,
818.60s: and not that everything else is broken.
820.20s: I mean, like there's still,
820.88s: like you could look around,
821.72s: a lot of stocks that are healthy, they're basing,
823.76s: but they haven't had any momentum, like moves for months.
827.32s: Like they just been stuck sideways with general markets.
829.92s: It's been,
830.80s: I mean, there's someone I follow,
832.36s: Jason Gofford, he's from Santa Mintreator.
834.52s: I don't know if you know the company,
837.68s: but they do great kind of technical research work
839.88s: and all the rest.
840.92s: And he has some great tweets,
842.48s: because people will,
843.40s: like anyone who says,
845.00s: like, you know, all this market is a bit narrow,
846.84s: people like,
847.68s: oh, you're just angry because you're not invested super long.
849.92s: But like statistically,
851.00s: I mean, like there's no other market on record
852.56s: that's had such a disparity
853.96s: between the few and the many, you know?
855.44s: So,
856.44s: so looking for next leaders,
857.44s: I mean, clearly like the AI space has been hot,
859.44s: we had big reversals today,
860.56s: which look like maybe at least a short term,
862.80s: I mean, momentum can carry higher anyways,
864.60s: but typically it could be possibly a short term top.
868.28s: But besides that,
869.12s: there's other still healthy looking things,
870.56s: but you need,
871.56s: you need to come out of their bases
872.92s: and show that momentum ignition again,
874.60s: or else they can just kind of chop side ways for,
876.84s: we're in summer now.
877.84s: The chop side was for a couple of months easily.
881.64s: Yeah.
882.80s: The next question I have then is,
884.72s: when you try to think about the impact
888.80s: of the new regime on the capability
893.24s: for these different kinds of companies to grow?
896.28s: Do you think that we're at like the early stages
898.68s: of where you might start catching parabolic growth?
901.32s: Do you think that this is kind of where most of these
904.20s: smaller companies might be trying to get all their stuff
906.40s: together?
907.24s: And then this is the kind of thing
908.24s: we're like in a year from now,
909.88s: is where you would actually start to see them taking off.
912.16s: How do you think about that timeline for them?
914.36s: Yeah, you know, and this is,
915.20s: I think it's a mistake on my part
917.08s: that I wasn't a little,
918.44s: I wasn't a much more focused on the large cap things
920.96s: because I kind of saw the AI come and said,
922.52s: okay, and then he's going to be the chip player,
924.12s: who else is going to win?
925.64s: But I think the perfect playbook
927.32s: to answer your question is really the 90s in the internet.
929.76s: You know, so the first wave really was,
932.92s: if you think about it, was infrastructure.
935.00s: Even things like Microsoft, like Windows,
936.80s: like Windows is not really a product.
938.24s: It's just like the interface you use
940.08s: to access the other products.
941.36s: Like no one's using Windows,
943.16s: they're using stuff on Windows,
944.36s: or you know, Compact came out of the laptop,
947.24s: you know, the portable computer and all the rest.
949.28s: So I think we're really in that infrastructure wave,
953.00s: which can be a good wave.
954.60s: I mean, as we can see, but the really,
956.68s: but the infrastructure stocks,
959.28s: although they can have good sizeable moves,
961.40s: they kind of get weighed down by the fact
963.04s: that there are already large companies
964.28s: in terms of percentage returns.
965.56s: So if you look at the whole 90s bull market for internet,
970.00s: the wildest and craziest percentage movers,
972.96s: things like Yahoo and all the rest,
975.08s: I mean, those were, those,
976.64s: those weren't the infrastructure plays.
977.96s: They were the, the people who were able
980.56s: to deliver the new experience to people.
983.32s: So I think there's, you know, a whole new wave,
985.60s: a good friend of mine was somebody recently,
986.92s: he was looking at Y combinator, who's,
989.04s: oh, sorry, I just hit my, my moving desk here, sorry.
993.52s: That's good, you just got a little bit taller.
995.72s: Yeah, that's it, that's it.
996.80s: So a good friend of mine was telling me Y combinator,
999.84s: which they, they helping to be all these new startups,
1001.52s: I think like 95% of the new startups
1003.76s: in the past year are AI related.
1005.40s: So I mean, just think of the amount of ways
1009.20s: that there's going to be new implementation
1011.56s: of this technology and new outcomes,
1013.68s: even things like biotech you can find
1015.40s: that these is better developed drugs better faster,
1017.84s: you can look a machinery, it could be more,
1019.44s: there's going to be so many outputs.
1021.28s: And I think it's these new young companies,
1023.16s: they're going to have the like eye watering moves,
1026.36s: like stuff we haven't seen in the generation.
1028.56s: So I'm still, I'm still very excited.
1030.56s: I think it's early days,
1031.60s: and I think it's really is the real deal.
1034.00s: It's not a buzzword, I mean, an AI,
1035.92s: I think we don't see all of the output today,
1037.88s: but like when people say, well, how do you know what's real?
1040.32s: I look at just the amount of capital
1042.20s: that people are investing in the space.
1043.76s: I mean, like you're talking like,
1044.92s: I mean, I think Elon was talking about
1047.04s: how they're spending four or five billion a year
1048.60s: with Nvidia just in chips, then there's the racks
1050.88s: and all the rest, like that's just one company.
1053.60s: So like combined companies are spending tens of,
1056.12s: if not hundreds of billions of dollars,
1058.04s: like you don't spend a hundred billion dollars,
1059.92s: unless you have a real path to how you're going to be able
1061.96s: to monetize this stuff.
1063.16s: You know, so like if it was just hype,
1065.40s: I think before the invested a hundred billion dollars
1067.56s: collectively, plus they would,
1069.36s: they would make sure there's a real path
1071.04s: to kind of use case for all this stuff.
1073.36s: So I think it's a real revolution.
1075.52s: It's going to bring on a whole bunch of interesting things
1077.76s: and the companies are going to come out.
1079.04s: I think you're going to be,
1080.12s: it's going to be the opportunity of a lifetime
1081.64s: to think in the next five years.
1084.00s: It's funny you say that I've kind of echoed that
1087.08s: in a couple different senses.
1088.76s: I think one of the things that you brought up
1091.60s: though that makes me chuckle a little bit
1093.52s: was the idea of not necessarily investing that much
1098.44s: without a clear pipeline,
1100.16s: but then I can't help but think of the metaverse.
1102.76s: What people were going and droves into the metaverse.
1106.96s: And I don't see that much is much anymore.
1110.40s: I'm actually curious from your perspective,
1111.76s: is that anything that you think of at all?
1116.88s: Well, you know, so the metaverse,
1118.36s: yeah, I mean, I don't think it was at all
1120.24s: like as broad-based or the kind of capital out there.
1122.52s: Definitely not.
1123.68s: Definitely not.
1124.52s: And also like that was,
1125.76s: it was kind of a bet on a new way for people
1129.36s: to want to like operate.
1130.68s: Like I mean, maybe it's my age,
1133.00s: not all considered myself an old person,
1134.48s: but like I find it weird to have to live in a digital world.
1137.92s: Like I find actually finding like having my phone
1139.84s: on me all the time's annoying
1141.08s: and I'm sure maybe the younger crowd will disagree.
1143.40s: But I think to AI's strength is that
1147.84s: it can just be used in like a countless number of ways.
1151.44s: It's not about like trying to like transform your physical space
1154.40s: into a digital and like you have to adapt this new environment.
1156.88s: Like AI can, you know, like I said,
1158.80s: it can help someone find a drug quicker,
1160.64s: it can help like operate your vehicles more efficiently.
1164.36s: There's like so many ways it could be incorporated.
1166.72s: Like I think we're just scratching the surface.
1168.52s: So I think it's just there's,
1170.96s: it's a much broader scope of applicability,
1173.36s: which is going to make it easier to scale
1174.72s: and all kinds of countless ways.
1176.88s: I think that's probably one of the most exciting things
1178.96s: actually for my opinion as well.
1180.36s: It's funny I was doing a podcast with another buddy
1183.60s: earlier this week about the impact of AI
1186.48s: and he has a little bit of the null opinion
1189.80s: which I find interesting, which is more of the,
1192.36s: he thinks it might be a little bit overdone,
1194.40s: oversold, have massive, massive expectations
1199.12s: it has to live up to in order to even justify
1202.24s: the current valuations that we're seeing.
1204.40s: And I sit here and I look at it,
1207.04s: not saying that you disagree with either of those,
1209.00s: but it sounds like as you're,
1210.52s: as I hear you talking about it,
1212.12s: I fall way more in line with your general thought process
1214.48s: where I truly view this as one of these,
1219.08s: once in a lifetime events,
1220.44s: it's almost like when we saw the internet come out,
1222.60s: that was a big deal.
1224.04s: And I don't view this all that differently
1227.32s: than that, they're different, right?
1228.60s: You can't do a direct comparison,
1230.84s: but if I think about the potential impact
1232.92s: on top of the current infrastructure we have already,
1236.60s: I mean, man, how far can this go?
1239.56s: So this leads to the follow on question for you.
1242.56s: When you're thinking about playing this kind of move
1245.48s: with this much opportunity and breadth,
1249.92s: we talked about a little bit of the infrastructure side of things
1252.80s: that seems like a near term play that could make sense.
1257.28s: What's the follow on for that playbook then?
1259.24s: Because obviously we can kind of forecast
1261.04s: the way we think this might go
1262.28s: where it might have greater impact than others.
1264.48s: And I imagine that would probably impact
1266.04s: your positioning decision.
1268.00s: So I think it's gonna come out of two ways,
1269.56s: the indirect and the direct way.
1272.16s: And so the indirect way is gonna be all the companies
1275.00s: where I mean, we'll talk about the unfortunate side,
1278.32s: things that people are scared of,
1279.40s: but like, for example, they were showing how,
1282.92s: I forget who was showing it,
1284.04s: but basically they had like two phones.
1285.44s: One was like an AI, they calling to order food
1287.72s: and the other was like an AI,
1289.20s: like receptionist who was like taking the order.
1291.00s: And they're both having what sounded like
1292.36s: two realistic people conversations.
1294.16s: So basically, yeah.
1295.36s: Yeah, the call centers, you won't need all those people.
1299.08s: Like that's a huge cost saving.
1300.44s: So everyone's always scared for jobs,
1301.96s: but I think that's a misplace,
1304.56s: like every technological evolution,
1306.32s: you jobs are found better jobs.
1307.80s: So I think on the short term, maybe it's a bit of pain,
1310.36s: but overall it should sort itself out.
1313.40s: But so all the companies who figure out how to leverage it,
1317.32s: you're gonna see like a big boost to the bottom line
1319.52s: for a lot of companies who get that right.
1321.96s: Just like anyone who, you know,
1323.80s: figure out how to leverage the internet
1325.24s: and I mean, think about it, people before,
1326.80s: like the way things were shipped,
1329.08s: the way things were ordered.
1330.08s: I mean, think about if you got to have receptionist
1331.68s: to take orders, I mean, like it's,
1333.00s: I mean, if you should, by today's standards,
1334.64s: it's ridiculous that we did everything so manual.
1336.80s: So those people will all get like the bottom line boost, I think.
1339.60s: And then the more direct ways,
1340.72s: and people are gonna come out just like,
1341.80s: with completely either never thought of
1345.36s: before products and services, which is an option,
1347.40s: or even just sometimes having a more streamlined AI-driven
1351.72s: software or product can append like big,
1355.48s: like you know, a lot of times we look at these big companies,
1357.12s: like like, oh, they're untouchable, they're so big.
1359.48s: But like try and get a new product
1361.04s: or a new process through a big company.
1362.80s: All the committees you have to go through.
1364.16s: Then there's the like the legacy investments,
1366.20s: we just spent so much on this,
1367.72s: how can we just like throw away this investment?
1369.64s: So like we'll do it partially.
1371.52s: And then you have these small upstarts,
1373.40s: they just like run ahead and take and eat their lunch,
1375.36s: you know, like the Netflix examples,
1376.60s: like the common one that, you know,
1378.32s: blockbuster could have seen what was coming.
1380.88s: So I think so, those who kind of leverage it directly,
1383.00s: and those like indirectly within the current ecosystem.
1386.12s: And I think there's a lot of ways,
1389.24s: a different, we would, we would,
1391.24s: we would speak of the internet,
1392.08s: but you could think of like, you know, nuclear bomb,
1394.16s: like how that kind of changed things.
1395.36s: It was the energy and then the whole like, you know,
1397.40s: space race and uranium stocks,
1399.64s: and the 60s are all the like rocket booster stocks
1402.92s: and aviation that took off, that was like a big thing.
1406.36s: Or you could think of even the car,
1407.72s: how that kind of revolutionized everything
1409.68s: for domestic travel.
1411.40s: I remember it's funny, if you look at early reports,
1413.20s: I like to study like technological revolutions.
1415.96s: Like a lot of people, like you could see culture people
1417.80s: be like, oh, a car will never be as, you know,
1419.72s: as useful as my horse, my horse can go everywhere.
1422.04s: Like now you look back at that,
1423.68s: you're saying like what a, what a narrow view.
1425.48s: I mean, like, you know, for him, maybe in his world,
1427.08s: where he saw like this, like an open metal,
1428.84s: the horse is more, more useful,
1431.12s: but as a society, like the car obviously is far, far better.
1434.44s: Or there were trains before then,
1436.32s: trains how they changed everything.
1437.48s: So every, I think this is another one of those cycles
1440.80s: where, you know, strap yourself in,
1443.24s: it's gonna be interesting.
1444.08s: And all of those cycles didn't last a year.
1447.08s: They all lasted for a decade or two,
1448.96s: like I mean, big transformations.
1450.76s: So it's, I mean, and we look at the 90s
1452.52s: as the internet transformation,
1453.88s: but really you can even almost extend it into two,
1456.32s: I mean, Google came out was 2004,
1458.68s: you know, so like it wasn't all just as internet
1461.36s: dominating the 2000s, but I mean, meta,
1463.96s: but 2000s, Apple really kind of got super innovative
1467.68s: in the 2000s, even though they were around before.
1469.56s: So I mean, the 2000s were really kind of the second act
1473.56s: of like what was the 1990s?
1476.60s: It's funny that you segue into that
1479.28s: because I know that you study a lot of the,
1482.24s: a lot of the just histories of markets
1484.48s: and kind of different reference points.
1487.00s: So that was gonna be my next question for you actually,
1490.16s: which was looking at AI.
1493.76s: What's the closest historical comparison you can think of
1498.00s: for what we're seeing and what we can see?
1499.72s: Obviously you gave an overview of what it potentially
1502.24s: will look like in total scope,
1503.72s: but do you have a reference benchmark
1505.16s: that comes to mind for it?
1508.36s: I think the internet's the best, the best one
1510.84s: because what was different about the internet,
1513.36s: like I mentioned cars and cars were like,
1516.84s: they got better, but the car remained the car.
1520.24s: Like I think the internet's a good example
1522.64s: of where the internet provided this base layer
1525.68s: for a platform that mutated
1530.00s: in many unforeseen possible directions.
1533.04s: So that's why I think the internet's probably
1535.52s: the best kind of comparison that we have kind of thing.
1543.12s: And the way it had that, like you had multiple,
1545.36s: it's interesting because the internet
1546.56s: even had multiple layers of infrastructure plays.
1550.28s: So like the early infrastructure winners,
1552.16s: like in the 80s and early 90s were different than,
1554.76s: let's say, Nordtel, at the end of the 90s,
1557.36s: who was doing the fast return ads,
1558.88s: like the technology moved so quick,
1560.68s: you need another infrastructure rebuild 10 years later.
1563.32s: So it's gonna be, I think that's the best,
1566.12s: probably study.
1567.32s: And it's similar like how, yeah,
1569.16s: who was the portal, the initial portal,
1570.80s: like Google was like the updated version of better search.
1574.16s: And then the iPhone was like the updated version
1577.20s: of the web browser, like it's in your phone,
1578.96s: there's the app store.
1579.72s: So you have these like reinventions along the way.
1582.36s: So the only thing is with AI,
1584.52s: and I think there's everything in general now,
1586.12s: everything happens faster.
1587.56s: So like where stuff happened like,
1589.88s: let's say to call that 20 years from 90 to more,
1593.80s: really like Microsoft came out mid 80s.
1596.24s: So call it, let's say 20, 25 years, like that cycle,
1601.00s: maybe this shrinks to 10 or to seven or eight
1603.72s: like this massive wave of like unbelievable productivity.
1606.64s: I mean, something's coming.
1607.52s: I think we'll see what it is.
1610.56s: I think that that's like a really adept comparison,
1614.00s: honestly, and it leads me to another thought,
1616.92s: which is when you typically play at least
1621.56s: a lot of your search criteria for the stocks
1624.32s: you're looking for and stuff like that,
1625.76s: it kind of exhibits a certain pattern,
1627.56s: it'll, you know, search, base,
1629.28s: or like that kind of thing.
1630.84s: And when you look at the kind of potential roadmap,
1634.28s: something like this could have,
1637.16s: and the investments in this could have,
1639.76s: does that adjust the way you search for stocks
1643.76s: because that timeframe can potentially be compressed so much?
1647.72s: Or is it something as you think that the model
1650.72s: that you employ now is rigorous enough
1654.04s: that it would adapt to that new scenario equally as well?
1657.56s: I think it's rigorous enough,
1658.64s: because, you know, it's interesting.
1661.44s: If you take like the recent Nvidia weekly chart,
1664.28s: or let's say arm, which had a big move recently,
1667.36s: and you can compare it to like these same leading stocks
1670.16s: in every cycle.
1671.08s: It's just so, it's so interesting.
1673.32s: Like you could look at these leading,
1675.56s: these leading stocks, and they turn to these leaders,
1677.32s: and it lasts for like that six months
1679.56s: to a year and a half, typically, as like the cycle.
1682.48s: And the charts just have a look.
1684.52s: Like the way their volatility, you know, comes down
1688.16s: and they trend, and so, like even in past cycles,
1692.92s: even though it lasted longer,
1695.56s: you had a lot of stocks that, I mean, think of Dotcom, right?
1697.84s: They came out and was like, boom, boom, boom,
1699.32s: like just like these fast spikes and moves,
1701.80s: and then those are certain styles of stocks.
1703.48s: So the fast wild stuff has been seen in different ways.
1706.72s: So I mean, it depends how adaptable you are,
1709.20s: but like I don't think the compressed timeframe
1713.16s: is gonna change the dynamics of how they operate.
1715.36s: I mean, you could see even arm recently came out IPO,
1717.64s: being nice base, had that explosion move,
1720.12s: same within video, all the rest, you went up, you based,
1722.16s: you went up, you based, and you went up again.
1724.00s: So recently I was trading Taiwan semi similar,
1726.80s: you kind of broke out, you pulled back your averages,
1728.68s: and you had this last late move.
1730.92s: So I think the patterns are gonna be the same.
1733.20s: I think that's the strength of like this process.
1735.28s: I, you know, it's a, you know, like, you know,
1738.44s: can slim growth investing, it's not like a big secret.
1742.48s: I think it works.
1743.32s: The hard part is just bringing everything together.
1745.20s: Like there's no secret, there's no like super secret.
1747.64s: Just, it's just, it's just hard.
1749.48s: Like to balance everything,
1751.80s: and everything always looks easier in hindsight.
1754.36s: It's like an athlete, you can look at like a baseball player
1756.28s: and say, okay, I can hit a baseball.
1757.76s: Yeah, I know, but if the guy's story had 102 miles an hour,
1760.28s: like it's a different than when someone's lobbing it to you
1762.68s: in like the home field and you're not gonna doubt, you know?
1765.68s: So it's one of those things like seems easy on the surface,
1768.60s: but it just takes a lot of effort to make sure
1770.80s: that every part of your system works cohesively,
1775.00s: so you don't, you don't kind of mess it up at any point.
1777.40s: Cause if you get one part wrong,
1778.88s: like let's see your risk management is no good
1780.36s: or position size is no good or market trend is no good.
1783.24s: It's like you're screwed up, it's like a car
1785.04s: and your brakes don't work,
1786.48s: or your accelerators don't,
1787.32s: your accelerators don't work.
1788.36s: Like one piece can't be broken or it's not gonna work.
1790.92s: That's the hard part.
1792.72s: A great way to frame it.
1793.72s: And especially for a system like yours,
1796.80s: which is kind of predicated on consolidated positioning,
1799.96s: but looking for big moves,
1802.80s: has kind of the past year been difficult
1806.00s: or have you adjusted your sizing at all,
1808.64s: or has it been kind of similar entry size protocols
1811.20s: as you typically would run?
1813.80s: So it's pretty similar.
1815.84s: Just there's been a lot of chop.
1817.64s: So it's, you know, again, if you look at the,
1819.64s: like the NASDAQ 100,
1820.84s: it looks easier in the past year than for what the experience
1824.24s: is for most other stocks out there
1825.88s: that haven't had the large cap feel.
1828.24s: So there's been a lot of chop under this,
1829.76s: like everyone forgets like last March,
1831.36s: there was like a banking panic and all this other stuff
1833.48s: that was like going on that people forget about, you know?
1835.56s: Because like the market's been strong lately,
1837.28s: but there's been a lot of chop, you know?
1838.60s: So I typically try and stay with normal positioning,
1841.28s: but if I'm a little bit less like certain,
1843.56s: or the market's been a little more difficult,
1845.52s: I just like cut them into a few smaller buys,
1848.96s: but I still like, so like,
1850.12s: you know, when I start a position,
1851.04s: I wanna get at least 10% into a position.
1853.44s: If I'm uncertain with markets, I'll start at five, six percent,
1855.72s: but I force myself that's going my way to get to where I need to get to.
1859.32s: So like I, I don't just get smaller and stay smaller.
1862.12s: Maybe I'll start smaller,
1863.24s: but then I'll force my way in if it's working.
1865.28s: That way, at least if it's a chopping environment,
1867.48s: you're not just getting cut the pieces.
1870.08s: Yeah, and so when you're thinking about your buy campaigns,
1876.64s: what's the timeframe that you're employing between like your first entry at 10%
1882.56s: or whatever the desirable is?
1884.92s: And then the subsequent entries that you're using.
1888.28s: So I like to kind of build into a stock over,
1890.68s: let's say one or two weeks, typically.
1894.68s: And when you get things right, like usually I found that the markets move
1899.56s: in these nice like three to five month cycles,
1902.00s: where like you'll get these big powerful moves and the stocks go crazy.
1906.00s: And then the good stocks will base and have another one again.
1908.64s: Some will just top and you won't hear from them anymore.
1912.60s: So that's so like my personal like ideal favorite,
1915.84s: and it doesn't always capture the whole move,
1917.72s: but my ideal favorite is kind of build over one to two weeks,
1920.92s: you know, but do that over a few stocks when the market's coming out of a correction.
1924.56s: And then three to four or five months later,
1926.08s: you're selling most of that stuff off.
1927.52s: Like if you look back historically at all the bull markets,
1930.24s: you get these strong waves and these small,
1932.20s: these corrections and then another wave and really it comes in these waves.
1936.08s: Did you show me a little bit about the way that you might play something like arm historically?
1942.88s: The reason why I ask is because one of the things I find honestly so fascinating
1947.92s: about the way that you trade is, well,
1951.40s: I think a lot of traders in general,
1953.00s: you eventually turn the corner where you're not afraid to buy something that's gone up, right?
1957.20s: That's kind of like a base level.
1959.04s: You got to get that sooner. It kind of thing.
1961.88s: But what I find really interesting about the way that your trading is for me,
1967.60s: like the process of doing that over like a week or two weeks, I would struggle with that.
1972.88s: But I imagine my my holding time is probably way shorter than yours.
1977.04s: So I imagine that's why there's like that dissonance in my mind.
1980.36s: But yeah, I was just curious if maybe we could take a look at arm or really whatever else.
1983.84s: I can grab anything that you want.
1985.76s: And I just want to explore what that that looks like.
1988.56s: So this is a good one because this is one I actually put on recently.
1991.40s: So if you kind of if you can move the chart a little more to the left, like at the IPO period,
1997.20s: you want to go further back in time?
1998.68s: Yeah, further back.
1999.48s: Let's say last fall, last October, one.
2003.76s: Yeah. Okay.
2004.20s: It's a little bit of a scrunch chart.
2005.88s: But do you want to go all out and zoom in over here?
2010.60s: Yeah, that like that area up until let's say February.
2013.88s: I don't know if you can yeah, like that would be great.
2015.80s: Yeah.
2016.84s: Yeah, I don't know if you can adjust the scale on the right or make it a lot longer.
2022.80s: Yeah. Okay.
2023.20s: That's better.
2023.84s: Yeah.
2024.96s: So you know, and you bring up a good point too because a lot of people ask me like,
2027.80s: you know, Matt, you are a market maker, you're a day trader.
2029.80s: Like you must have these great insights from like intraday and and and it brought a lot of help.
2034.76s: Cause I could I could see how wide patterns form like it's one thing to learn the theory,
2038.32s: but I really see why they formed that way.
2040.64s: But to your point, it took me a long time to go from like making 200 trades in a day to like holding
2047.00s: a stock for three months.
2048.04s: Like first, you know, people who never.
2049.32s: It's crazy.
2049.88s: The shorter term side.
2051.36s: It's like, wow, it was three was three months.
2053.08s: But when you're used to like being in and out over and over and over to like sit with a stock
2057.20s: and you have this open profit and you're just watching it like bobble up and down.
2060.48s: It's like psychologically, it's a very hard.
2063.72s: Yes, transition to make, but that's a discussion for another day, I guess.
2067.96s: So, so this example here.
2070.00s: So you can see how we looking at like that, see that low at 46 and a half there that's sticking out.
2075.48s: So that was kind of the corrective phase.
2077.72s: And as we kind of start to work up the right side, yeah, until like I think what averages are those
2084.24s: Eric that let's see that.
2086.48s: You mean the moving averages or the yeah.
2089.44s: So there's probably more than we need.
2092.48s: But there's like a 10, 20, 50 and then a 150 this really dark one.
2098.28s: OK, yeah, that makes sense.
2099.68s: Yeah, so when we ran up to that 50 the first time, you can see like a yeah, so like a, yeah, so that's kind of where I put my first initial positioning on.
2108.68s: And then after as a kind of consolidated for a few days and we had that other like kind of large candle that broke high or kind of added to the position.
2114.92s: And then we went up one more time and we kind of had that sideways consolidation.
2118.84s: We kind of put that handle on the right side of the base.
2121.28s: And so I was a broke out of there on that.
2123.64s: Yeah, I kind of finished off the buy.
2125.72s: So this, this is actually I told you earlier, like I think nine out of 11 stocks gaped down for me, like on the recent earnings the season.
2132.84s: This is one that gaped up for me.
2134.44s: So I this this kind of ran up at the earnings I had puts for protection.
2138.16s: And I actually have an IPO sell rule that I used.
2141.48s: First of all, it was from experience and I went back to study and I saw how it was helpful.
2144.40s: But basically if I buy a stock coming out of a recent IPO and it goes up, let's say 80 to 100% from about the.
2150.88s: Middle of the base, I'll just sell it into strength because then typically you have the, you know, the shirt, the lock up expiry comes and you have people who have stock from pennies who just want to take their big profit and buy their mansion.
2162.36s: So just naturally you get that bad break a couple of months later and it has to reset up like like arm ended up doing.
2169.16s: So I kind of built that up in those stages on the way up.
2172.92s: And then after coming out of that earnings, actually that first big candle that launched that of earnings, I sold that into like the one 15 120 area.
2180.88s: And then two days later, the next morning I was happy when it opened back at 100 and then the next day I was miserable as I went to 160.
2186.68s: But then ultimately I think it fell back down to like 80 something and now we had another another recent leg up again.
2193.60s: So then that so this bad break you can see there that that's most IPOs if you look here if they're successful longer term, there's always like after that initial like double that really nasty break where insiders like they, if you bought a few out of stock as an employee at a dollar.
2208.64s: And you know you suddenly have this multi million dollar like are you care if you're selling at 120 or 110 or 105 you just want to take the money before this appears so they end up having this really aggressive seller that comes to market after an IPO.
2223.84s: And then does your original thesis maintain are you looking to then enter back in or do you view this as it made my move I'm going elsewhere.
2234.44s: So I mean like the young stocks are usually the nice stock so once it has that like bad post IPO break.
2240.84s: It can set up again just needs to kind of set up a nice structure that this was a bit odd because it kind of had that bad break into April and then just kind of like roll back up to new high so it wasn't like a traditional way way to typically do I mean there's always a random variation so I didn't catch the second way I was playing with it a couple of days and I got knocked out of it and ended up going without me.
2261.28s: But they can set up again and have like nice continued legs you just want to avoid that first nasty bad break after the IPO.
2270.88s: Yeah it's it's actually really interesting to hear the way that you played it because this this was where I ended up getting in but well not nice right as I listen to you getting in here and then doubling right I'm getting pennies on the dollar like a freaking peasant.
2287.12s: But I guess that's that is the beauty of trying to find derivatives is you don't need quite as much of a move in order to be happy with it but it's not always especially and stuff like this like newer products sometimes they don't offer Dorado sometimes are not liquid so you kind of get priced out of some of those moves now when you're looking at this what would be the way you view reentry is this something that is kind of like on a watch list that you revisit until it sets up and it's lower on your price.
2317.12s: So I'm going to start with the list because there's other stuff that's kind of at a more advantageous stage of its growth. I'm curious how you kind of cycle through your stable of stocks that you conducted your original analysis on you like it you traded it you got your exit but the overall thesis maybe the essentially the same.
2337.12s: So I keep like a general list like now there's about 100 stocks on it where like there's two like like there's two criteria like I want those that have a good fundamental story behind them and or that they're showing really great relative strength so I feel like the ones actually trade have both.
2351.84s: But you know if you don't keep them on a list and watch them sometimes things change and you just miss them so I keep this big list so for example arm is one where it's ever since I traded state on my list as a watch.
2361.68s: Because just the fundamentals the growth that trajectory is all fantastic but it had that bad break so then you're looking for other opportunities but you're still.
2369.68s: The early weekly review is still coming up in your process.
2372.96s: Got it it makes sense to especially because the way that you explain what you think that break comes from to me that would be a non factor then right if it's just a bunch of insiders that are wanting to unwind their position.
2383.92s: I mean I don't care that's that doesn't change the fundamental picture of it if that's the.
2389.60s: You know what's my speaking to like what we spoke about before I was saying people asked that you know did your experiences of market maker and stuff help like I think that's somewhere like a situation like that it helps because you can see.
2400.08s: The impact of like you know again like you go to school and everyone talks about efficient market and like rational investor and like then you've seen like you just like when you're like trading short term you see fills where people are just like.
2410.72s: selling a stock but at a ridiculous way I mean like saying why didn't you take your time you would have gotten like.
2416.00s: Such a better exit because for some people their motivation is not about best price execution their motivation and you see they can be an institution needs to liquidate or.
2423.36s: I mean i've seen all kinds of crazy stuff over the years were like a forced liquidation or what where sometimes it's not.
2429.28s: Best price is not the priority is just get me out now I want it now because I want to vote or because i'm forced to because of a legal proceeding or whatever.
2436.32s: So it's interesting like so for some people like they can't understand like why would somebody do that there's everyone has their their their pushes and a lot of time does not.
2445.48s: The rational investor mindset you know and I always joke like I know like.
2448.84s: Investors aren't rational because i've been irrational myself enough times that i've broken the i've broken the model so the market can't be that that efficient.
2456.96s: Well it's funny too i i've been following the whole game stop saga just from specifically to rotas perspective it's been absolutely fascinating and somebody they asked me a question about like the there's.
2469.52s: Game stop right now is at like 2559 and they were asking about these 125 calls that expire tomorrow.
2478.56s: That expired tomorrow are they were and they're.
2482.08s: Massive open interest in these 125 calls that yes i'll hold on i'll show it to you because it's amazing it's hilarious i hope it's at least worth pennies i mean i hope it's literally it's big it's been at a penny offered at two.
2497.68s: To come all the way down here look at this 113,000 oh i on this 125 call.
2504.72s: First of all you can you still get i feel like that's a free penny i mean i'm.
2508.72s: i like and what i try to explain to people you know they're really fascinated by the implied volatility of these really far out of the money options and.
2517.12s: i try to explain to them one this is telling you that if you're buying this you are buying this at a crazy price.
2524.56s: Relative to what it is the second thing is this kind of can be indicative from a market making perspective how they view their risk right.
2532.96s: Because if you look at something like apple it'll still have kind of a crazy smile.
2539.60s: Where if i close this down like you can still see even in a near term expiration it'll have a big smile right where the out of the money puts there over 2000% i.v.
2550.96s: But you don't typically see you know the call side quite as high but GameStop is one of those.
2557.84s: Crazy crazy products that it's just been wild to watch i can't i mean from a market making perspective that is going to be like a field day.
2567.28s: Yeah it's wild i mean it can be dangerous you know a lot of guys get product like that because.
2572.00s: Well now like people understand but like and i know everyone was was railing on the guys were short and i think they were like abusing the short perspective like they really.
2580.56s: They still are yeah really short they still are so like they're wrong in that perspective but like you can i mean.
2586.96s: Assuming the person's not like abusing their power as a short like i've seen like market maker sometimes they just get on the wrong side they don't have no idea stories coming.
2594.80s: And they get run over and like the poor guy was just like i was just putting his trade on he's not trying to manipulate markets and they're trying to make a market.
2601.04s: Months of work because of some random you know like so i've seen both sides i i could i could have some sense of you know sadness for the market maker sometimes you know i've seen that side of things.
2612.88s: Well especially from the retail side on this thing i think there's a little bit of um you know just angst towards like the institutions and the market makers they can play games i'm sure you know that right but.
2625.12s: I mean it's to to the extent order flow still dictates the vast majority of their day so.
2632.80s: Yeah it's the this kind of things really interesting to watch but pivoting out real quick when we first spoke well two times ago we were talking about the Fed and what the Fed was doing interest rate environment.
2647.16s: Then the last time we spoke i think the market was still looking at three cuts still pricing and three cuts.
2654.32s: Big change and now the market's looking at two feds still talking about one.
2660.48s: What do you make of the rate environment and the impact.
2665.28s: I think well i look i always like to say that the Federal Reserve the Federal Funds rate should just fall the US two year yield like ultimately that that's always where it gets to and and if they're too far below it like they were like in you know post financial crisis.
2679.36s: It's like you're creating an asset bubble if you if you too far above it like you were going to the financial crisis or like other periods like you're you're creating.
2687.00s: Like economic weakness so you know you have this big board of people which really all they should just do is let the market decide the right interest rate which is.
2694.40s: The capital is free market way in the right way to do it.
2697.12s: But if you look at so if you look at the current way like the two year yield is as come off and it's it's quite it's about i think it's three quarters of a point below federal funds more or less.
2705.84s: And I think again so much is is.
2710.48s: adjusted errors affected by this large cap tech rally because if you look anywhere else I think you can really see the economic weakness building.
2719.68s: So if you look at the Canadian market it's soft if you look at even US market equal weight or small caps or.
2725.36s: Russ even s and p equal weight i mean hasn't done a whole lot for for a number of months if you look at European markets where they have like no technology sector.
2733.04s: Like friends I think last week fell like 10% Germany fell six seven percent Italian markets fell more.
2739.12s: So I mean like obviously it's a completely different type of economy but if you want to look at like the the non tech component like just pure economy is probably a better representation just for the fact that doesn't have that distorted effects of.
2751.28s: In video Microsoft Apple so I think and I think that's why.
2756.00s: ECB cut a quarter point why can't it cut a quarter point because I think they're starting to see like.
2761.04s: You know when trying to balance the risks of inflation and economic weakness is it's not so clear.
2766.56s: A distinction anymore that inflation is the only the biggest problem like inflation is getting closer to two percent.
2772.72s: But and I think at the same time there's not a say like we are actually getting weakness you know by the time like it comes through it's always late you know before we realize it but.
2780.00s: I think you are seeing that I think most stocks are reflecting that just so happens that you know the cohort of seven you know magnificent seven stocks are in a world of their own and that distorts things but everything else I think is starting to reflect the economic weakness and so I think from that perspective looking at the two year yield I think the Fed.
2799.44s: It's probably becoming a bit slow to kind of remove the restrictive stance I know it's like I'm from Powell's and this is from Powell's perspective if you put yourself in his shoes.
2808.80s: It's easier and he said this it's easier to revive a week economy than it is to stop inflation as we've seen inflation is very sticky.
2816.96s: So I think he would rather and if you put yourself in his shoes it kind of I probably would want to do the same thing you're a little more willing to like make things break a little bit you can say okay here's some QE here's some lower rates everyone we're fine
2828.48s: that's a lot easier to stop than once inflation gets inside people's minds and it's just self-fulfilling prophecy so I think they probably see that things are starting to soften but
2837.44s: they're willing to the plate to the risk that the economy weakens and without having inflation get away from them.
2844.56s: Yeah I agree with that and the the other thing I was thinking about anyways is just the timeline right like if we if the market is still pressing in two cuts which is what I saw last time from the bond markets or the
2854.56s: the bond futures and I just I think we're running out of time for that man because when I'm considering the way that the Fed has played this so far
2865.28s: they've obviously been kind of slow rolling and kind of for a lot of the reasons that you were just outlining but then I look at
2872.40s: whenever they make their first cut the probability of there being a second cut in the very next meeting I have to imagine is very low unless the economy is showing massive signs of weakness.
2888.08s: When you think about playing the potential cut well is that anything that you are looking to play anyways it sounds like it might not even be necessarily a big impact to the stuff you're trading but I'm curious if you have a play around it.
2900.64s: Well yeah just like for myself I mean so like most stuff I do is kind of growth related but I'm starting to look at some of like just you know there's different accounts that I have like so I think some of the high dividend payers are going to be attractive because I think if the economic slowness comes in and those
2915.00s: these stocks are not done great but I imagine a lot of them will start to kind of get a bid as interest rates fall the yield will become even more and you're going to get that kind of realignment I think you'll get like that cap
2924.12s: basically it's like a bond proxy and I think you're trying to see like even the TLT which is like another the bond ETF trying to make that higher low so I think that's probably the way you play it I think if the market does correct
2936.28s: but then after ultimately this this drop in rates is going to support the more speculative side of the market as well because like all this time that's why it's been large cast
2944.36s: because with higher rates anything speculative is under pressure and and so I think when rates fall that'll be another kind of notch in the belt for more speculative growth as well so I'm sorry I'm sorry to kind of look to see who would would win coming out of that and that's kind of the bond proxies and that is it's just a treat I'm looking at as well
2961.80s: Yeah yeah it's funny it's it's so whenever I talk to you man like there's so many parallels we just have a slightly different way of like approach you markets but I've even in the beginning of this year I was long small caps I was long bond
2974.36s: trying to front run a little bit of that uptick that we first thought the cut was going to be a march then they moved it then they moved it then I was just like all right man fine I'll take the trays a lower you know I move the capital somewhere else I'll go be a D Gen and load up and T triple cues y'all put twist my arm but yeah just
2992.60s: the the way that you're thinking about it is honestly very very similar to mine I think what I found interesting so far has been the dissonance between the market and what the Fed is actually done
3003.88s: is I typically think the Fed and the market align a little more closely based on historic references that I saw in terms of kind of like policy messaging and then follow through and this seems like a pretty big disparity last question for you
3018.52s: when you're looking at the rest of the year what are you most interested in falling long
3027.80s: I think I think the election is going to have a big impact interesting I mean I don't want to get into politics but you know I think
3037.80s: again whether you're a Democrat or a Republican it's why I always try and just like talk to an economic perspective like from an economic perspective lower taxes is just better for the economy
3046.68s: and the stock market because I think lower lower taxes like economics 101 is taxes there's a dead weight loss to a tax you know the government kind of like has to tax you and they're they're poor allocators of resources then the individual is who actually earned it so I think cutting tax
3065.24s: tax will help I don't know if Trump gets reelected but I mean I know Biden's not popular I think if there is a change I think people will whether it's whether Trump gets the
3074.28s: nomination whatever I think just from an economic perspective that'll probably put a jolt I think into the economy and I think that's why in 2016 he had his big tax cut plans which he did put through which helped us the economy and all that I think if you look at Canada where we've had like higher taxes there's raise a capital gains tax and like I always like to say like these things like people think these are long term things or you know it's not to want to help others but I think it's does this service to everyone because look at this productivity is the worst of the G7 now we are one of the best and now we're we're
3104.28s: dead last in the gym I mean Italy's doing better than us you know what I mean like all these countries that you would think that you wouldn't think of as having stronger growth economies are doing better in terms of productivity in the rest so
3113.56s: you better be careful throwing shade at Italy because if I'm not mistaken you might be checking them out soon yeah exactly I'm going down in July I'm going to do my economic inspection that's why I'm going
3123.88s: yeah well you better be careful over there you might run into a few dudes be hey I have some families some areas I have to make sure not to go to the local towns I'll get I'll get thrown out
3134.44s: but you know so like but these economic policies have a real impact like maybe not week to week but looking over a year
3140.12s: two years and the market's going to respond and so I think that could be I think if you get the catalyst I mean
3145.00s: if you look at a perfect world of like let's say taxes coming down or you know and I think this is
3151.40s: where even you know Trump I think his policy he was a big fist big spender so you know that that was
3156.84s: maybe a negative the government spends too much to become too big a part of the economy so that's
3160.92s: not I'm not saying I'm a rating fan of either side I always try and stay politically neutral and in talks but just at least
3167.40s: it on the tax side if you figure if you get like any help from tax then after you get
3171.88s: falling interest rates and you get a technological revolution I mean you have three things like pushing in the
3177.72s: same direction and you get inflation under control so you get like back to stable currency lower rates
3183.24s: hopefully better better taxes and a technology that like sets up like a really promising 2025 so like
3192.20s: I think in a perfect world because we've had a big run to indexes because of the big cat tech
3196.68s: you were erected in September October and then you get all of these catalysts at once like Fed cutting and I think
3202.68s: 2025 could be a really exciting year you heard it here first plus also everybody don't forget to
3210.28s: clip that part about Matt talking trash about Italy's productivity gotta make sure that gets out
3216.20s: there but Matt as always man absolute pleasure hanging out with you chat and markets with you is
