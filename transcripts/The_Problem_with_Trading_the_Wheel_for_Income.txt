0.08s: trading the wheel for income we just had
3.28s: a great conversation about that on a
4.92s: live stream you should check them out we
6.36s: stream daily but I want to walk you
8.84s: through an actual practical example of
11.16s: this and why there is some really
13.16s: important nuances you have to be aware
14.68s: of if you think you're going to trade
16.84s: the wheel for income especially in some
19.28s: an index spy now one of the big issues
22.20s: people have with the wheel is it sounds
24.32s: so good it sounds like a win-win win-win
26.60s: right you sell cash secured puts you get
28.04s: assigned at a cheaper basis you collect
30.00s: premium to do it you sell calls collect
32.04s: premium against the shares that you hold
33.56s: and then you hold shares that appreciate
34.88s: in value it sounds great across the
36.60s: board and I am actually an advocate of a
40.20s: very close cousin to the wheel that I
41.88s: think is far superior which is a covered
44.44s: strangle some slight nuances between
46.80s: them I'll throw a link in the notes
49.36s: below that walk through that strategy
51.20s: and why I really prefer it over the
53.32s: wheel but they're not that far apart now
57.08s: the main thing is when we approach
60.00s: trading we have to approach it with our
62.36s: eyes wide open that means we can't focus
65.32s: just on the elements that sound good or
67.44s: the pieces that we like we have to walk
70.60s: through the reality of what it can look
73.40s: like in general the markets look good
75.72s: they exhibit positive drift and that's
78.08s: awesome you can make money holding index
80.40s: ETFs but if we look at a year like 2022
83.64s: it can go through periods that don't
85.04s: look as good so if you're thinking that
87.60s: you're going to trade something like
88.80s: this for income and it's just going to
90.44s: be smooth sailing no problems you're in
92.92s: for a really really really upsetting
95.72s: video but it's a reality that you have
98.44s: to see because if you go into this with
101.36s: such a skewed perception and then you
103.36s: start seeing things going arai that's
106.28s: typically when our strategies unravel
108.76s: and we make bad decisions and we're not
110.92s: in a good spot for it so we can
113.12s: proactively think through then how we
115.56s: intend to manage this sort of thing
117.84s: based on what the market does so let's
120.88s: start with the wheel so first things
123.96s: first I'm going to grab the tracker here
127.56s: this is just like a scratch tracker we
129.12s: don't really need the short put side
130.84s: because the wheel typically starts with
132.76s: cach secured puts until you're assigned
135.04s: and once we get assigned we'll just have
137.92s: our shares so I'm going to use the
141.32s: current price of S&P 500 is
144.92s: 45753 and this is starting the study on
147.92s: 10gan 2022 10 Chan 22 just for reference
153.04s: so let's now go through and take a look
157.08s: at what this whole thing ends up being
159.12s: I'm adding another cell down here which
161.32s: helps me track the performance as we
164.28s: move along and then as we compare it to
166.44s: current spot price this is using a
168.44s: prospective $100,000 allocation so the
171.40s: first step in our process is to sell
173.36s: cash secur puts until we're assigned and
175.60s: we have $100,000 to do so so let's go in
178.80s: here and let's find we'll just start
181.68s: with like a 30 Delta something really
183.36s: really simple we'll collect 714 because
186.28s: the market is already falling very very
188.88s: volatile and let's figure out how many
191.72s: of these we can sell there's
194.64s: $443 is the strike price so that tells
197.60s: us if we sell two of them we're
199.80s: essentially going to be using
201.48s: 886 so that's pretty much what we're
204.96s: going to end up doing here so right now
206.48s: it's 18 fb22 the stock at entry as we've
210.56s: already identified
213.32s: 45753 the expiration date is going to be
216.36s: 18 Feb 22 the strike price that we're
220.00s: looking at is the 443 I'm just moving
223.88s: this out of the way so that I can go a
225.08s: little bit faster 443 the Delta is.3 the
229.60s: premium that we're going to get is
231.72s: 714 and it looks like we can sell two of
234.28s: them because we're going to use
237.68s: 88.6% of the portfolio at that point
240.24s: just to show you what this all looks
241.68s: like with things input we're tying up
244.40s: 886 we're going to collect
247.76s: 1428 we're going to achieve a 1.6%
251.12s: return on invested capital for a pretty
255.12s: shortterm trade
258.12s: this is wrong obviously like I said this
261.32s: should be 10 Jan 22 and then this column
264.96s: is going to be completely ruined because
266.16s: it's using uh today as compared to so
270.00s: not a bad return on invested capital for
271.60s: a 30-day trade if we annualize that
273.72s: that's really healthy so let's fast
275.36s: forward I'm going to take us straight to
277.04s: expiration just so that we can move
278.96s: through this a little more efficiently
280.92s: so we need to go to 18 Feb and let's see
284.60s: where we're at for these I normally use
287.00s: the chart because it populates faster
289.32s: this is using thinker swim on demand it
291.00s: lets us go back and trade back in time
293.72s: as things were so we can see that the
295.84s: market here looks like it's trading
297.52s: around 435 our strike is 443 so we
301.08s: should be able to take this down for a
302.52s: full profit up here you can't see it but
304.92s: it says pre-buffering it's done now and
308.36s: that looks like not the case because I
314.00s: mixed up my numbers so our strike is 443
317.36s: not 435 so yeah our strike is 443 the
320.76s: stock is trading at 435 so in this case
322.84s: we essentially would just take
324.20s: assignment so this closing price would
327.56s: be zero the stock at exit right now is
332.36s: 435 like this and now let's add the
337.96s: shares so to do that we take this down
341.92s: because we do realize that entire profit
344.44s: which is great we're done on the call
347.16s: side and now on today which is the
351.32s: expiration day of 18 fb22 18
355.88s: Feb 22 we're going to buy to open 200 of
359.44s: these and then our basis was the strike
362.84s: price which is
365.36s: 443 so now you can see up at the top
368.56s: here we're in for 200 shares at a basis
372.00s: of 443 total cost of
374.32s: 88,2 so as the underlying sits right now
378.20s: at
379.60s: 435 you can see that the p&l on the
382.64s: stock is negative 1,600 bucks so we're
384.96s: net negative including the premium
387.28s: received and now is when we would look
389.72s: to try to sell some calls so let's do
392.04s: that as part of the wheel so let's go
394.88s: out 28 days to the next primary
397.04s: expiration our basis is 443 so we can
400.36s: easily sell stuff above our basis so
402.84s: we'll just default to like a 30 Delta
405.16s: here and we can sell two of these so I'm
409.76s: going to input this into the sheet and
411.16s: then I'll show you after it's done so 15
412.92s: fb22 current stock price is 435 the
416.24s: expiration date is 18 March the strike
418.68s: price that we're looking here is 449 the
421.80s: Delta is a.3 the premium that we're
424.00s: going to get is
425.64s: 455 and we can do two of these we have a
427.92s: two lot
431.44s: so this is what we're looking at now
434.44s: again the reason why this looks all
438.48s: messed up for like the return on
440.68s: invested capital and then the p&l for
444.08s: the return on invested capital is just
445.72s: because of the dates we're missing a
447.12s: days in trade so don't worry about that
450.04s: that has everything to do with using
451.96s: historic dates so now we fast forward
454.80s: and we see how we did so let's do that
457.16s: we're going to go from 18 Feb and we're
459.76s: going to go straight to the expiration
461.60s: of March which is 18 March so let's see
465.88s: how these two calls did it doesn't
468.12s: matter to adjust that here just tracking
469.84s: it for our use and
472.36s: convenience and it looks like the stock
475.52s: is trading at 437 here our strike would
478.88s: be 44 9 so we should be in the clear
481.64s: this should show us a full profit yep so
484.80s: these come down for a penny I'll just
487.40s: say that we choose to EMP exit it a a
490.32s: little bit early just so that we don't
492.60s: have anything lingering and we can add
495.56s: more over the weekend that's the more
497.40s: important part because if you take it
499.96s: all the way to expiration and allow it
502.04s: to expire that's fine but then you don't
506.44s: have the opportunity to lay them out
509.08s: again over the weekend which is
511.92s: suboptimal so here's our trade from the
514.16s: call perspective we'll take this down
517.24s: this we'll go into our little call
518.96s: section down here this is nothing we can
521.16s: clear that out and let's take a look at
524.40s: the trade as it sits so the stock is
526.32s: currently trading at
528.72s: 439 so if we had bought outright at 457
533.60s: we would be down
536.08s: 4.1% but our position is actually up up
540.20s: just a little bit which is really cool
542.68s: that's one of the benefits of trading
545.32s: something like the wheel where we can
547.12s: have satellite positions like these puts
549.20s: like these calls to make a little bit of
551.12s: money as we move along so let's continue
554.52s: the experiment today's date in the thing
558.00s: is 18 March 22 and then the stock at
562.20s: entry will be the same as the stock is
564.00s: exit for the last position and I'll move
566.16s: this out of the way so again I can go a
567.92s: little quicker and let's go out here to
570.36s: 14 April so we'll do 14 April
573.92s: 22 let's see if we can get another 30
576.36s: Delta that's above our basis we can so
578.80s: this is 452 our basis is 443 so that's
581.92s: fine so our strike price is going to be
585.36s: that 452 Delta is.3 again the premium
588.84s: we're going to get is 4.11 lot size will
591.24s: be two and let's forward now one of the
596.92s: reasons why I'm taking you through the
598.36s: fast forwarding and everything so that
599.88s: you literally can see how to do this for
603.44s: yourself because the ability to run
606.04s: through and test ideas like this is
608.00s: massive it helps so much with developing
612.36s: a better understanding of how things
615.36s: look during different market conditions
617.60s: how we might manage things and there's
619.24s: also a reason why I insist on using a
621.80s: manual input process I used to have
624.12s: everything fully automated and then I
626.40s: realized that by fully automating stuff
628.80s: you become a little more detached from
630.92s: it and more detached than I cared to be
633.80s: so this will come down for a penny which
635.40s: is great the underlying is currently
638.56s: trading at
641.60s: 441.87
643.64s: let's move this trade down here so now
647.76s: from the call side we've realized 1,700
650.60s: bucks from the put side we've realized
654.36s: 1428 and with the stock at
658.24s: 441.87 we are showing a stock loss
661.60s: unrealized of 240 so we are now in the
665.48s: black officially showing a profit so 14
668.76s: April 14 April
672.40s: 22 now let's get our next series of
676.04s: short calls out this will take us to 20
680.80s: May 22 strike price again let's see if
684.72s: we can get that 30 Delta we should be
686.36s: able to that's above our basis 455
688.60s: that's great so our strike price in this
691.12s: case will be 455 which is again a 30
693.36s: Delta Premium that we're going to take
694.68s: in is 364 we'll have another two lot
697.64s: that goes out and you know what's next
701.44s: we going fast forward let's go now to 20
704.04s: May next
705.08s: expiration and let's see how we
708.48s: do so now it looks like the stock is
710.92s: dropping pretty heavy it's down to 397
714.16s: 98 on here so this is going to look fine
718.84s: this will will essentially be able to
720.08s: come down for a full profit but the
722.96s: underlying position is going to look a
725.24s: little bit unhealthy so we can
728.44s: see this is essentially we would take
732.12s: that down for a penny or zero just let
734.52s: it expire let's take it down for a penny
736.64s: so that we can try to add something else
738.20s: out there and then the current
739.72s: underlying is
741.12s: 387 so let's take a look at
743.88s: 387 and let's drop
747.12s: this down here for the side of things
751.00s: because I copy this over from another
752.80s: the formatting gets a little me messed
754.60s: up but we can fix it just like that and
758.00s: now let's update the price for what it
760.04s: is which is 387 so now the stock is
762.56s: showing an $1,200 unrealized loss so we
766.16s: are now very very clearly losing money
769.32s: let's go to 20
771.12s: May 22 which will be our entry date at
775.00s: 387 and then let's see what we can find
778.64s: there's a potential that we might not be
780.68s: able to find anything within a
782.04s: reasonable amount of time let's try 28
783.84s: days first our basis is 443 so you can
787.72s: see as we go out to something above our
789.68s: basis we essentially collect like 15
791.60s: cents so you have a choice here you can
793.52s: either sell below your basis and play in
795.04s: a manage it or you can accept that
797.36s: you're not really going to collect a
798.44s: bunch of money or you can go further out
800.48s: in time those are your series of choices
803.00s: so let's see what the 443 is will get
805.32s: you out here which is 56 57 it's not lot
810.88s: not a lot at all here's how I do it my
813.84s: preference is if I'm going to sell below
815.56s: my basis I'm going to be much closer in
817.72s: time if I'm going to sell at my basis
820.36s: and there's not a lot in it I'm going to
822.08s: be much closer in time the reason is
824.68s: because I want to maintain as much spot
826.56s: price sensitivity as compared to getting
828.84s: stuck with a long expiration and then if
831.32s: the stock starts moving up I'm kind of
833.24s: stuck I don't really want that so let's
836.28s: go here and let's just pretend we're
838.36s: going to keep it at our basis following
840.64s: like the standard approach a lot of
842.04s: people do there's a more advanced
843.76s: version of this of selling below the
845.20s: bases which is what I would do if you
847.36s: guys are interested in that let me know
849.04s: we can do a video on it at some point
851.52s: that's something that we've done a
853.04s: couple focused topics on for the patreon
856.72s: because it is a little bit nuanced but
858.36s: it's very doable so now let's take a
860.28s: look at a strike price of 443 our Delta
863.32s: is going to be quite low of a
867.40s: 0.02 premium 14 cents lots too so let's
873.20s: fast forward one more time and then I
875.76s: just want to show you what's going on
878.56s: here with the wheel in this scenario we
882.96s: got to go to 17 June which is here and I
886.44s: want to talk about a couple ways to
888.04s: enhance what's going on if you find
890.36s: yourself in this scenario because now
891.72s: the stock is plummeting even more down
894.40s: to 362 so let's see what this shows up
898.84s: at
899.68s: we should be in a pretty healthy spot in
902.12s: terms of the calls being essentially
903.72s: worthless so we can start actually
906.04s: filling that in I'm pretty sure there'll
907.68s: be like a penny
909.00s: minus1 just call it that and let's see
912.72s: what the underlying itself is trading at
916.40s: yeah so it's essentially a penny and the
918.24s: underlying now is at 364 so let's grab
922.48s: that workbook again
926.40s: 364 so we essentially made 26 bucks
930.28s: there not much to write home about it's
933.36s: something and the underlying itself
936.84s: right now is at 364 so let's update this
940.44s: 364 so we are we are deep deep in we're
944.96s: down 15,800 so if we had $100,000
948.52s: allocated to this trade this might be a
950.16s: good time to kind of use the rest of it
952.20s: now my general approach is a little more
953.84s: nuanced I would scale in in different
956.24s: time frames and whatnot but let's just
959.04s: say that we're going to come in at
961.20s: 36411 and the purpose of doing this is
963.56s: to help reduce our basis a little bit
965.72s: and we have the ability to use what a
968.36s: little under um well a little over 10K
971.16s: so let's take a look at starting with
972.88s: like a 50 lot not quite let's do like a
975.72s: 30 lot that's closer maybe 35 lot just
980.72s: too much so we'll keep it at like a 30
982.64s: lot we'll use
984.40s: 9,523 so that now reduces our basis to
987.24s: 432 a pretty meaningful basis adjustment
990.20s: All Things Considered however if we take
993.04s: a look and we go out 28 days we go to
994.88s: that 432 you're now only making like 10
998.56s: cents you're just not making money so
1001.60s: this is one of the limitations of
1004.20s: trading the wheel for income income
1007.20s: specifically because if your approach is
1010.12s: to trade this for income if we take a
1012.56s: look at the overall duration that we
1014.60s: into this whole thing we started on 19
1016.64s: Jan 22 the date that we're at in here is
1019.92s: 17 June we're about halfway through the
1022.04s: year and our overall p&l is much better
1027.52s: than if we had just bought outright it's
1029.24s: about half but you're still down 12%
1031.84s: that's still not good that's not good
1033.44s: enough and this is one of the reasons
1035.60s: why I like the coverage strangles so
1037.16s: much more than this is because we use
1039.64s: calls and puts as satellite positions
1042.60s: around the underlying itself and we get
1045.40s: much better adjustments out of it but
1048.32s: the main issue with this idea of trading
1050.68s: something like spy via the wheel for
1052.68s: income is that if you go through periods
1054.92s: like this you have to have another
1056.40s: approach otherwise you just you don't
1058.76s: really have income coming in once we get
1061.44s: into this right so like the last couple
1064.36s: short calls that we traded we made $26
1066.84s: on those and we just don't have a lot to
1071.92s: show for the risk that we're putting out
1074.28s: and I think what did we get on these up
1077.84s: here yeah the 26 bucks so here's a
1082.96s: couple things to keep in mind if we're
1084.64s: trading the wheel for income the first
1086.24s: thing that you can do is the biggest
1087.56s: favor to yourself is don't use the
1089.76s: income for the same month or even the
1091.52s: same year my advice is if you're trading
1094.12s: for income essentially pad at least one
1096.88s: full year of your required income that's
1099.48s: padded meaning you give it a buffer so
1101.80s: that this way as we're going through a
1103.68s: negative period like this we can stomach
1106.36s: it the fact that we're only taking $26
1108.92s: in wouldn't be sufficient for income but
1111.36s: if I'm able to trade other things at the
1113.44s: same time I'm doing this to take
1114.76s: advantage of the current market
1116.04s: conditions and then eventually this
1117.60s: recovers and start to show a profit that
1119.36s: compensates for the loss then that
1121.88s: pluses back up where I need to be for my
1126.40s: 12mon buffer of income I actually would
1130.28s: do no less than 24 months two years
1132.36s: personally because the market can have
1134.20s: prolonged down periods and this is one
1135.88s: of them if we continue this exercise
1137.76s: it's the same thing for the next six
1139.60s: months you're just not able to collect
1141.16s: much we've used all the money so now
1143.56s: it's sitting and waiting which can be
1145.12s: problematic so this is not to disparage
1149.16s: the wheel or using this as a way to make
1152.24s: money or to make income it's just to
1154.28s: make sure that we're going into this
1155.56s: with eyes wide open as always if you
1158.00s: have any questions let me know if you're
1159.84s: in the patreon you have access to
1161.84s: templates for stuff like this if not
1164.16s: just literally recreate what you see
1166.08s: here if you don't have an idea of where
1167.76s: to start I re recommend at least
1169.56s: something like this this is a super
1170.96s: simple one be an outlier I will see you
1173.16s: all later
