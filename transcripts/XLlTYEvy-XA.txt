571.00s: You
580.00s: you
584.00s: you
591.00s: and
600.00s: again. Take a look at this. What what what what am I doing wrong here? G M E maybe I'll just click it.
612.16s: Okay, so you just can't hit enter. That's good to know. It was like why am I looking at the same
616.88s: thing over and over again? So if we take a look at the just last 12 quarters, right? And we poke
625.44s: through we see the expected ranges have been quite volatile and there's if I were trading this
632.64s: for earnings, this would be a tough one for me for two reasons. One because it has really big
642.64s: severity of moves and they're in both directions up and down. And when it's reporting earnings
652.40s: normally, you can see even when it's within the expected range, the majority of instances,
659.76s: it's at the very end of the range. So here here here here here it's like at the very end of the
666.00s: range. There's not a lot of money to be made from a whole perspective on something like this,
670.88s: which is difficult. Now the cool part is since I'm trading a coverage strangle in it,
678.96s: then I'm essentially already in the position. So it doesn't necessarily matter a whole lot to me.
684.64s: And I think still even right now I'm pretty much all in options. Yeah, I'm just in puts that are
691.28s: in 20 June. I'm in the 28s. So those are probably coming up due on time to exit, but not quite yet.
703.76s: If we get a decent price move, I probably would consider just starting to build an actual equity
712.24s: position. I've been slow in general on building equity positions in my coverage strangle just because
718.64s: of the way that the market is positioned. It's not really worth the cost to carry.
726.64s: Right. And when I say cost to carry, I don't mean outright in terms of like financing costs
733.68s: and stuff like that. I literally just mean the opportunity costs of holding the position. And also
738.00s: shame on me. I haven't even said hi to you guys yet. Sorry, just like I got excited. Just jump
742.80s: right into it. Looks like we got he's Tanner. Dookie pie. There we go. Sounds right. H.
751.68s: A nod. Oh no, there's an end there. Oh shit. This is going to be one of those ones. We're going to
756.72s: go back to that one. Lauren Matthew in Scott. Get to see all of you. The fuck do I say this name?
762.64s: I feel like I've done this one before. And
769.52s: a non a non a non that's my best guess. A non. I feel like I've done this before.
778.40s: Every once in a while I come across names and hear that are just very
783.60s: very
787.84s: just as I said that just as I was literally saying I come across names and hear that can be very
793.12s: difficult to say. The next comment that pops up in the chat is from very fat cow.
801.52s: That's awesome. Runs me like Xbox gamer tags.
804.40s: If you play Xbox you know what I'm talking about those gamer tags are fucking wild.
811.92s: So Matthew says you're using thinkorswim for looking this up. I'm watching from my phone. So
818.48s: listen via audio. No, this what I'm doing right now is I'm using unusual whales.
822.88s: Thinkorswim has the same thing. The only difference in thinkorswim is it's not as neat of a display.
830.40s: And I also don't think it plots this here which is like the the actual expected move.
836.24s: It just plots the implied vol realize vol and then price movement. So it's a slightly
841.76s: different view. This one is just a little more convenient because it puts everything in one spot.
846.96s: One of the things I found with like using different trading platforms and stuff is for the longest
852.32s: time I was so reluctant to to pay for anything. And it's because I would always say like oh it's
858.32s: available. I'll just do it myself. And I did that for a really really long time. The thing is
870.56s: there's like a lot of stuff right? So the thing is that's like a really poor person's mindset
878.24s: which is fine. That's how I grew up. But it actually is a limiting factor.
885.76s: So what ends up happening is the amount of time it takes me to build all of the different things
892.56s: that I otherwise could pay and access and use is completely different. Now you guys all know I
899.44s: have an affiliation with them. So I have a deal with them the platform and stuff like that.
905.76s: They're not sponsoring any of this stuff. But it's literally like a tool that I use. So
913.92s: those kinds of relationships I always feel like work well because it's like a natural again.
920.64s: This is a natural thing that I would use. I'm actually in the process of trying to get back into
926.24s: either some sort of terminal. I don't know if I want to go and grab a Bloomberg terminal.
931.84s: They're really not that crazy expensive. They're more than what would be reasonable for most people.
939.12s: But the thing is is like they're kind of fun for the information that they provide.
944.88s: But in terms of like how it actually would impact my functional trading, it would be about NIL.
953.12s: However, the amount it would impact content creation would be massive because there's a ton
957.68s: of really cool information in there. But then there's also other versions. Other like tier platforms
963.68s: like that kind of like icon and stuff like that. There's also S&P global IQ. Those ones are pretty
971.76s: solid. But this has most of what I need. And from earnings and stuff like this, this is pretty good.
979.84s: H says, Scarelli is trying to build a competitor. Another terminal. Yeah, that's cool. I think
985.68s: that's good. I think the more competitors you can get in the space, the better, especially what's
990.88s: stuff like this because information really like it really is a premium. And there's a lot of
1004.16s: I don't want to say withholding, but it's pretty damn close to that. There's a lot of gated
1009.84s: information. Now I'm okay with that by the way. That's okay because I also think people have
1016.24s: gotten so spoiled where we just think everything should just be free for us, especially retail traders
1021.92s: were the worst. We think everything should be free and it's psychotic because as soon as even
1028.96s: as soon as you set up an entity to trade through, if it's an LLC or something else, you have to pay
1035.28s: for shit. You have to pay for quotes for streaming. Like you have to pay for normal stuff that most
1040.32s: other entities have to pay for. It's just retail traders have gotten so used to this Goldilocks deal
1046.40s: and as always, you should pay attention to why that would be. Why is it that if I have an entity
1057.36s: that's registered to trade, I have to pay for all this shit except for retail so much of that
1065.44s: shit is free. Why would that be? It tells you a lot about the infrastructure. It's really funny
1073.28s: because there's a lot of these small subtle cues like that that show the reality that people
1078.64s: just go straight over the head. They don't even notice it. H says the brokers are just generous,
1087.20s: right? Exactly. Just great people. They just want everything. They just want the best for you.
1094.56s: It's hilarious. For those that aren't out of curiosity, actually genuinely out of curiosity,
1101.12s: do you know what I'm talking about? I'm curious as I'm joking around who is unaware of what I'm
1112.00s: actually talking about here because it's not like an inside joke but people genuinely might not know.
1120.24s: H says we couldn't possibly be cattle like liquidity sort of. I actually wouldn't say that's
1126.32s: the main thing because the liquidity provided by retail is not insignificant, especially depending
1131.84s: on what the underlying is. So there definitely is an element of liquidity but it's actually even more
1138.08s: broad than that. There you go. Matthew says free equals you are the product such revenue source.
1148.56s: Fucking bingo. What a perfect way to frame that. For those that don't know how this works.
1154.16s: So you have a broker and they provide access to markets. So let's just pretend these are all
1163.84s: like streaming quotes. They provide access to markets. And there's some brokers like IB for example.
1171.44s: They have institutional level clients that still use them as in actual brokers. So it's not just
1178.16s: all retail brokers. But if you're using something like Schwab, it's generally retail broker. There
1184.00s: still are some institutional level clients through there. So if you have retail and then if you
1191.04s: have institutional and again, institutional means a ton of things. This isn't just like the people
1196.08s: that most people don't like like market makers and stuff like this. This is this and by the way,
1199.92s: there's not really a ton of reasons not to not like market makers but that aside. The retail side of
1207.20s: this equation, we have completely different access to the broker and then to the exchanges
1214.00s: than an institution. So if you think of things like streaming, which is literally just getting
1221.44s: live data, this is free. This is paid for them. And it goes on and on with a lot of different things
1230.24s: in this way. However, it's super important to understand the relationship between broker and retail
1238.64s: because exactly as Matthew sniffs out the reason why retail has provided this access is for
1246.08s: a couple very specific reasons. One, retail typically equals smaller. Typically. And this will even
1257.44s: be used at this kind of logic in really well known research papers where, for example, if you
1264.56s: read the latest paper on zero DTEs SPX, they essentially are assuming that if you trade more than
1272.16s: a one lot, your institutional or if you're trading naked options, your institutional, which is
1278.00s: funny because I don't consider myself institutional, but I absolutely would fall into that categorization
1284.32s: there. So anyways, the assumption is smaller. So this means less money.
1291.20s: So less money means that in order to pay for things like quoting streaming stuff like that for
1297.92s: general access, that cost money, that amount of money can be prohibitive that can literally stop
1304.56s: your ability to access. Let's say if you're starting with a $5,000 account and you've got to pay
1309.28s: what's called $200 a month in access, this is a meaningful amount of this is what 4%
1316.72s: the meaningful amount of your money just just for access in a month. So the broader point here is
1323.04s: it tells you a few things. One, it tells you that retail typically isn't making the fucking money
1329.20s: because if they were making the money and it was relatively easy to make the money and people
1333.44s: know you can make the money, then this initial startup cost is palatable. But we know that not
1339.92s: to be the case. We know that most fail. So the reason why the broker gives you this beautiful access,
1346.40s: the reason why they give you really cool stuff like education is because they want you to trade.
1354.72s: They want you to trade as often as possible. They want you to interact with the platform as much
1362.56s: as you humanly can. And it's because what they're doing is they make a little bit of money
1369.44s: off of you. When you send your order through, you might have a commission if it's an options contract,
1375.92s: if it's equity, that's essentially gone at least on the front end. Then as they route your order,
1381.60s: it doesn't typically go directly to the exchange. Oh no, there's a break right here.
1388.08s: And this break right here starts with them pooling orders. You get a bunch of different orders
1394.00s: in here. Then there's literally firms, market making firms, other entities that will straight up
1404.24s: buy this order flow. And then they will complete the circuit. Why the fuck would they buy your order
1414.64s: flow? Again, you can deduce exactly what's happening here. So going all the way back to this mindset
1423.28s: that retail traders have everything should be free, it's such a broken way of thinking. And it
1429.52s: literally is just part of the same poverty, stricken mindset because the only reason why shit is
1438.16s: free for you is because they are making money off of you. That's why it's because they're making
1443.76s: money off of your order flow. Your broker side, the broker of arrangements and agreements that
1449.12s: they have with the various firms that they partner with. There's I.B. agreements that you have to
1453.76s: look at. Then the market making firm is able to either make money by just making money, making
1460.80s: markets for the order flow, but they can also take directional bets based on whether or not it seems
1466.96s: informed order flow. It's crazy. It's really, really cool. Now, and notice how I say that,
1475.60s: it's really cool. The reason why it's so cool is because this provides an insane amount of access
1483.12s: that otherwise would not be there. You just have to accept the world as it is and just learn to
1491.20s: maneuver through it. Just because this is the case doesn't mean that any of this is necessarily
1496.08s: out to get you. It means that we live in the structure that we live in. If retail traders somehow
1501.68s: magically got good at trading, some of this absolutely would change because that actually breaks
1508.40s: this. They don't want this shit anymore. Same thing for anybody that internalizes your trade.
1513.92s: Like they don't want it because they're internalizing an informed trade that they know they're
1519.36s: probably going to fucking lose on. So they have to hedge it all the way through in order to make
1523.68s: the fractions of a penny on the back end. So that kind of stuff would all evolve pretty quickly.
1529.68s: So this is another reason why you should be thankful that trading is hard and why most people
1536.40s: fail at it. It is the only reason why there's an opportunity here that's all there is to it. So
1544.96s: anyways, back the game stop and back the earnings. My guess is earnings will probably be pretty
1556.00s: be pretty mellow. So if we take a look at EPS estimates, they were expected at nine cents
1568.40s: in Q1, Q2, they're expected at eight cents, Q2 year over year, Q2 estimate was down at dime. So
1578.08s: I mean, this is what the path to profitability looks like, right? Negative, scratch,
1589.60s: scratch, it's like positive, positive. Now another estimate for positive. This is the path to
1596.24s: profitability. It's not super sexy, but this is a company that has a big turnaround that they
1604.88s: need to navigate now. So when we're coming into earnings, my full expectations is probably pretty
1616.24s: mellow, probably sideways, unless there's some sort of broad market catalyst, which you guys all
1621.92s: know, it's always one fucking tweet or X or truth or whatever the fuck around the corner that
1628.48s: you can think of. We're seeing, you know, a beautiful marriage being just broken down shotgun style
1637.28s: in front of our faces, which is hilarious. Just the way that the whole thing is going is so entertaining.
1645.84s: I don't know, it's so funny to me like when I see people that are watching like dramas on TV or
1653.60s: stuff like that. It's like literally just watch the news. You'll learn a little bit about the world
1658.72s: around you and this shit's even crazier. It's literally insane. It's awesome. There's always
1663.60s: stuff to look at. So let's take a quick look at what the options look like in here.
1679.84s: And there's a couple things that we should peek at. First thing is let's just take a look at the
1688.32s: general chain. Pretty quiet.
1701.84s: The 20 June cycle is setting up to be pretty big based on the broad OI that I see.
1709.04s: They're still pretty meaningful call OI skew. But as per usual, a ton of these are super, super, super,
1721.84s: super far out of the monies. So let's take a look at 20 June here. I mean, all the monies in the
1728.32s: call side for mill and call premium who 69 on put. So I mean, just huge skew skew skew skew skew.
1742.32s: This is the very standard, the very standard upside expectation that people are paying,
1749.68s: paying through the nose for. This is interesting. That's really interesting. Oh, I think this is
1755.28s: a lot of that position we saw getting built out a while ago. Yeah, on the tails, there's a little
1762.88s: bit more on the put side, but in terms of expiration, but pretty much all the premiums on the call
1773.68s: side, that's without a doubt. Let's see if there's any interesting trades. I already looked at this,
1784.32s: but I'll look at it with you guys. All our filters are off. Okay.
1801.44s: So, I'm trying to see if there's anything new from when I looked last. Lots of like the put side is
1812.32s: pretty busy. I'm going to turn that off for now so I can see easier. And then
1821.52s: let's get rid of the sales. One of the reasons why you're going to see tons and tons and tons of
1828.16s: calls being sold is because for those that have shares, the ball is still heavy and it's still
1838.88s: typically worth selling on the call side. So if you take a look at 20 June, this ball is very rich,
1845.44s: very, very rich. It's not outpacing the put side at the tails, but at the more usable strikes where
1854.88s: people are going to be in the proximity of spot price. So if you're looking at like a 15,
1860.48s: 15 strike on this side, we'll just take a look at an example. So if we take a look at a 15 strike,
1865.92s: that's still a one Delta. So let's go to like a 20 Delta, something that's still pretty far out
1870.24s: of the money. 21 Delta, Val here is 81 seven 81.7 21 Delta here. Val is 126 62. So what I'm showing
1886.88s: you is it's why when you use the volatility surface, you have to be perceptive slightly because even
1893.76s: though the tail looks like it's so much higher than the call side and that could lead somebody to
1900.72s: inaccurately be like, oh, this has like crazy putt skew. There's just not much in the calls.
1905.44s: It's just not the case. There's a ton. There's a ton in the calls, especially when we normalize
1911.44s: based on Delta for again, things that are within a certain bandwidth of at the money, whatever that
1919.12s: is, which is right now it's like 29.5. So we actually have pretty significant callsque
1926.56s: in those closer strikes in terms of all. So the like the wall surface is so unbelievably useful
1936.08s: for understanding the way that the market is expecting things to move and in what severity.
1942.56s: It's not always cracked, but it gives just incredible starting point, I think.
1949.76s: And it's something that I literally use all the time because it gives you just a super streamlined
1959.04s: view. Now with something like GameStop that's so prone to skew across a ton of different factors,
1968.88s: it can be a little more difficult to perceive everything there because things can be so weird.
1975.76s: But nonetheless, this looks like generally standard coming into earnings. Like that's kind of
1985.52s: what I see. There's not like crazy huge trades coming in. 20 June op X is absolutely going to be
1992.24s: busy. And that's because there's a ton of premium in that cycle that's going to have to do something.
2001.76s: So we'll get we'll get a look at it and see how it ends up flushing out. But what I'm mostly going
2014.24s: to be looking at is how do things shape up into earnings. So the next couple days is a perfect time
2021.84s: to keep an eye out for things like any sort of big unusual options activity and stuff like that
2028.88s: because that'll show like specific earnings driven positioning. So this is a really good time,
2036.00s: like a really good window. Just keep an eye open to see if anything catches your eye so far, not so much.
2044.00s: All right, let me grab the DD library because I'm on a timer here. So I want to at least get through
2053.28s: hopefully a couple of these. I have to figure out where the fuck we are. I think we did this one.
2062.96s: I think we might be on this one. Does that sound right?
2071.12s: Maybe this one.
2074.24s: So did it all securities been fine 58 times for violating finra reg show SEC several instances
2082.72s: of document is willful naked shorting in d's 2020 they reported an increase in their short
2089.36s: positions 127 year over year calling bullshit. Okay.
2094.32s: Let's see.
2106.32s: I'm just trying to see like what the let me start at the back and go go the other way.
2113.04s: Sometimes starting with the conclusion is helpful for me. It's kind of like reading the abstract
2117.68s: of a paper. I just want to know like what what are they posing to us right now?
2125.04s: Where's the conclusion?
2129.20s: Can't tell who's responsible for the flash crash and game stop. I don't think anybody can.
2135.68s: This just wasn't market manipulation is laughable.
2138.96s: All right. Here we go. The pressure being placed on hedge funds to deliver has been higher
2148.24s: and the shift storm of corruption is coming to a head. Unfortunately the dirty tricks and
2151.76s: Fud will continue. There's several catalysts coming up.
2158.08s: However, desperate times that for measures.
2160.48s: Okay. So this seems like this person is more just expressing frustration.
2172.16s: And I don't see a lot relating to.
2183.60s: I don't see a lot relating to
2186.08s: like the broader theory on game stop and stuff.
2196.40s: Okay.
2202.24s: I do want to take a look at this part though.
2205.68s: Did it else a conglomerate? Yep. We know this. Managing a lot of money.
2216.40s: The value of those options changed dramatically in short amount of time. Yep.
2225.36s: Okay. So this is just saying that they're in a lot of stuff.
2237.20s: Well, COVID we've all heard stories of brick and mortar going bankrupt become very profitable to
2242.96s: bet against the continuity of these companies. So big fox like Citadel decided to up their
2247.52s: portfolio by 127 and a half. So this is not true. In terms of like the implication that they're
2259.60s: trying to arrive at. I just realized the bottom of this is cut off. You guys sorry.
2264.48s: Squeeze it up. The implication that they're trying to allude to here. So think of it this way.
2270.96s: When we think of brick and mortar stores going bankrupt during COVID. Well, let's
2277.76s: as always rather than speculate. Let's investigate. So in the US, how many publicly traded
2292.00s: and non publicly traded.
2294.96s: Companies.
2302.24s: When bankrupt during COVID. Let's see.
2313.44s: And we're using. We're using our buddy Gemini. Let's see what we get.
2324.72s: And I'll tie this back. Don't worry.
2330.48s: Total of 21 655 business bankruptcies. 110 publicly traded. So for context,
2339.44s: if you think of publicly traded companies, there's 6,000 a little over that.
2347.76s: 6,000 to 7,000. So the total that actually went bankrupt was very small as a total amount.
2357.20s: The reason why I'm saying this is just because again, I have absolutely no love for Citadel at all.
2365.44s: I just so heavily prioritized trying to be as objective in analysis. Again, the thing I will
2374.56s: always remind you all is that if you are more objective in your analysis, you will be able to
2380.48s: find more and more meaningful things that you can do stuff with. So this, there's not like a ton of
2389.84s: profit that they were going to draw from small businesses going bankrupt because the vast majority
2394.96s: of them are small businesses that are not publicly traded that they can't get a position on into
2400.56s: short. So the thing to keep in mind is most of the time during really volatile markets,
2410.24s: market making firms provided they can keep their shit together. They can make so much money.
2421.44s: And it's because of standard market behavior that we all, at least I think most of us know about.
2430.40s: I'll show you. Remember market makers most often they're trying to collect the bid-ass spread.
2439.84s: So if you have a bid and you have an ask or what we refer to as the offer. So let's say that this is
2445.60s: a normal period of time. The markets are like we see right now. So let's say that something is
2453.76s: two pennies wide. What that means is that the total spread represented between the difference
2459.44s: here is two pennies. So in order for them to make money, they're essentially grinding away.
2466.64s: And when I say market making firms, by the way, I'm referring to the algorithms that they run.
2470.80s: This isn't like physical dudes clicking the button. So what ends up happening during highly,
2479.36s: volatile periods is this spread becomes something like this. And it literally can go from two pennies
2487.12s: to a dollar, a dollar plus. It can be all over the place. So what ends up happening is during these
2494.40s: periods provided they can manage their risk, look at how much more money they make per trip
2501.36s: provided that they can manage their risk appropriately. Blocking funds. So that's one of the big reasons
2510.88s: why you will see institutions specifically those with market making arms do really, really well
2519.04s: during super volatile periods. They'll make a lot more money. Lauren says shorting amplifies a
2526.00s: problem in a company already in distress, but it doesn't necessarily cause bankruptcy in my opinion.
2532.16s: Yeah, no, it definitely wouldn't, that's correct. And I agree with that. I think you have to
2540.48s: think about the pressure it adds, which is significant. So it definitely, and I think the
2546.40s: way you framed it is exactly correct, amplifies a problem. I think that that's super fair.
2552.64s: And this is why I think it's important to go back to like the idea of just basic market dynamics,
2558.32s: right? If you're trying to short something that is fundamentally really sound and people can see
2565.52s: that, the shorts typically get their face ripped off. And it happens pretty regularly. It's why
2571.20s: there's a name for it short squeezes because they might try to proxy into something that might be
2576.96s: kind of weak. And then somebody else might say, I don't think so. I think it's pretty strong. And
2582.56s: enough people have that counter position. All of a sudden you get some buy pressure. Shorts have
2587.04s: to close. They end up buying into the own rally. And then boom, you're off to the races with a
2592.00s: pretty disadvantaged position that they have to try to manage is very difficult.
2597.76s: Joseph says the dude on the other side of the trade loses on a non passive participant.
2607.04s: Could you explain more? The dude on the other side of a trade. The person that's most often on
2613.60s: the other side of your trade is a market maker. So they don't really care what happens.
2622.72s: In terms of whether or not their passive or not passive, we don't know.
2626.56s: Joseph says, meaning you buy the offer, you're down right away on the spread from the bid.
2637.28s: Yeah. So that's typically the case. So depending on how the market moves, right? The market doesn't
2645.44s: stay static. So as your trade gets filled, if things slide that can happen or if they stay static,
2654.24s: then you might show no change at all because that just might be where the market is at that point.
2661.76s: The other thing you'll find on your portfolio is that you'll typically be quoted against the
2666.32s: midpoint, not necessarily the bid or the offer, which might be more appropriate based on
2672.48s: where you might get a fill or how wide something is. I find that a lot when I'm trading things
2677.44s: like ratio-called diagonals that are further out in time and less liquid, it can show a much
2682.00s: better profit than is actually there. Okay, cool. Let's check out another one.
2693.28s: This one.
2698.72s: Jesus. I don't know what this is, but I love it.
2706.24s: Do you guys know where is this from? Something that I just don't know?
2712.64s: This is fucking hilarious.
2719.52s: Oh, I love this. I have absolutely no frame of reference for what this is from, but the hostage
2725.52s: situation would be over in this circumstance. That's for sure. God, that's funny.
2732.40s: Okay.
2733.44s: Sid does. Hostages explaining why the moass is taking so long. How the January spike was stopped.
2740.00s: Robin Hood's motives for trading haunt and the mysterious silence of the SEC.
2747.44s: What does TA mean? I know TLDR. What's TA?
2754.88s: The January moass is delayed because citadel took hostages. They figured out how to ensure
2759.20s: others would be squeezed before they were. Oh, curious.
2767.04s: They all took trading because of relationship.
2772.08s: Oh, you guys are way more normal than I am. H says transfer agent,
2778.56s: Lauren says technical analysis. I was thinking like too autistic didn't read or like too long didn't
2785.20s: read TA. I went the wrong way, I guess. They figured out how to ensure others were squeezed before
2796.00s: them. They halted trading because their relationship with citadel turned them into a hostage moass,
2801.92s: waits until regulators soon the hostages.
2804.00s: Okay.
2810.80s: Hey DK, let's read more.
2814.96s: Citadel wasn't going to be squeezed in January. Robin Hood was citadel took hostage
2819.52s: to figure out how to ensure that others were squeezed before they were.
2824.88s: Robin Hood halted trading after game stoppers on the threshold list 35 days, 35 failures to
2830.56s: deliver broker becomes responsible for delivering the security to the customer. The moass is taking so
2834.80s: long because citadel managed to figure out how to make their short position other people's problem.
2841.84s: This is why citadel seems to have so many people protecting it, willing to lie for it.
2849.36s: Okay. These ones are tough because it's like very entrenched in a position. So I'm not going to
2858.32s: like bother going through it. I'm just going to accept it as what it is and see what we can learn from
2863.36s: here. So let us continue. Theory Robin Hood halted trading the day they became liable for delivery
2875.76s: of GME shares, citadel sold to their customers. Okay. I think Robin Hood halted trading because they
2886.48s: were required to purchase games up shares and deliver to customers past orders. Okay.
2895.28s: We know this. Robin Hood customer buys shares that are cleared by citadel. Their delivery is not
2903.12s: a problem unless it takes longer than 35 days. Okay.
2916.48s: So if I wanted to sell a share on the market, then I do not want to sold share directly to the buyer
2923.28s: of that share. You send my sell order into the market via my broker, send that off to the market
2928.88s: center where it's executed by market maker, sell my share to the market maker executing the trade.
2938.40s: They sell that share to the broker, then sells that share to the buyer.
2946.96s: This is partially correct. Yeah. I suspect citadel had been failing to deliver GME shares to
2963.44s: Robin Hood for an extended period. I don't know where this relationship or like the tie that they're
2970.88s: making between citadel and Robin Hood. But my expectation is that it would actually be potentially,
2981.20s: I don't know who their IVs are with. So my expectation is that this would be even more complicated
2987.20s: actually than this. Give me one set. Got to pop the door for the old boy.
3000.88s: A bad. So anyway, let's continue.
3031.84s: Robin has to buy the shares they expected citadel. Where is this? Do you guys have any context on where this
3040.40s: where this relationship is like very like unilateral relationship?
3046.64s: He's been thought out. I don't fully understand why they're
3051.20s: thinking this. But it might be more founded.
3061.84s: Age says back then apex apex was Robin Hood's clearing firm confirmed from last year in FGF
3068.32s: that they do the same on things around lending shares to brokers before they have possession of them.
3072.40s: Yeah, that definitely I agree with. Age says the large group of traders were trading reverse
3079.68s: stocks split rounding at the time apex would give shares that weren't supposed to exist on paper
3087.44s: to folks the next day after. Yep, I think that that's. Yeah.
3095.20s: I think that that all makes sense to me. And I definitely would think that that that happens.
3100.40s: So is it the case where they're thinking?
3105.36s: Yeah, that's right.
3106.40s: So that's what we're seeing.
3108.40s: Anyways, let me continue.
3110.40s: The Del still owns Robin Hood shares at some point Robin Hood has to deliver to their customers now.
3115.84s: Okay.
3119.12s: You expected to be relationship between Robin Hood Halt.
3127.28s: Number of users pointed out the purchase prices and dates incorrectly reported while transferring
3131.76s: from Robin Hood to other brokers. This is because Robin Hood initially sold their user shares
3138.40s: based on delivery promises made by Citadel and failed to fulfill this I struggle with.
3152.16s: This might help why my analysis is 605 data found the proportion of GameStop order executions
3157.20s: done through NASDAQ spikes in February. This can make sense. I agree with this.
3161.92s: Despite being almost non-existent. Yeah, I think that that's absolutely.
3167.44s: I think there's something to that because the market plumbing is really important. And actually
3171.60s: Dave Lauer and I talked about this a little bit on a podcast we did a little while ago.
3175.84s: That was a pretty good conversation about why orders would be routed between exchanges in
3182.64s: different capacity. So I could absolutely get behind that.
3189.44s: Robin Hood wasn't the only one that halted trading. It's difficult but not impossible for
3193.44s: Citadel to have orchestrated this behind the scenes. See, this I feel like starts just going too far.
3198.56s: I think the probability that Citadel was like the mastermind behind all of this, it really doesn't
3206.00s: even register for me. Mostly because the fact is I don't think the market actors broadly
3216.32s: were going to allow the stock market to potentially explode due to this. So I think there's a point
3224.88s: regardless of whether it's Citadel or another entity regulator that decides to step in and fully halt.
3232.96s: Simply to stop it from going overly parabolic, which can happen. It absolutely can happen.
3240.40s: And this goes back into the idea of like Moas, I don't think is as appealing of a thing as people
3248.80s: think it is. Simply because you can't make money if the thing that you're making money in goes away.
3257.60s: So you might be showing some sort of great profit until it literally just goes away.
3263.36s: Then there's not like some massive settlement where people would just get whatever their
3268.08s: account was at. There would be a broader settlement of distributing of what's left. So
3277.84s: the other thing I will continually remind people of is the squeeze was stopped already.
3287.44s: Right. So if we go back, the squeeze was stopped. So what ends up happening is regulators,
3297.12s: again, regardless of who it is, they step in and they say, this isn't going to go any further.
3302.00s: This needs to stop here. And when that happens, they've already made the choice to put the ceiling
3311.84s: on. So there's not really a world that I see where we go into the future. And then the regulators
3319.44s: at that point are instead now like, let's just let it go. They've already shown where the line is.
3326.48s: The line was here. We saw it. We saw when there was that fraction of a game stop share that
3331.36s: traded for what? A few thousand bucks. So like we could very clearly see where the line is.
3337.04s: So the reason why this matters is more for like the actual investor. It's not because, you know, I have
3346.48s: a hope or dis-hope. I don't know if that's a word of this happening. I'm indifferent to it because
3352.88s: I would trade it either way. But the reason why I spend the time talking about these things on
3358.72s: these streams, especially with like the ape community and the game stop folks, it's not to try to
3364.88s: discourage people. You should again, do whatever is right for you. But it would be really frustrating
3372.08s: if people go into this with an expectation not understanding the broader reality and making an
3378.80s: informed decision, right? An informed decision being, let's say you have 500 shares of game stop.
3385.28s: And let's say game stop starts making this parabolic run up. And then you're in the mindset because
3393.36s: you heard somebody on, you know, Reddit somewhere say, well, I'm not, I shouldn't sell until there's
3398.40s: telephone numbers. Okay. Well, what's really shitty is if you wait for that. And then it's now down
3407.28s: here because the buy button got turned off, regulators stepped in and literally forcibly stopped
3413.76s: the squeeze. That sucks. Now, the way that I would think about taking profit in an event like this
3420.00s: is the way it's literally what I did, which is the standard scaling. So it's starting with a
3427.92s: certain size position. As the move starts to heat up, it's phasing out slowly, keeping smaller
3436.08s: bits on as runners so that you can enjoy the maximize the amount of the move that you can get.
3444.32s: Now, as I'll always point out, this is from a trader lens, right? That's what I am. I'm a trader.
3452.72s: So that means that I need to move in and out of things. This is very different than the total
3458.32s: lens, which is also completely viable. The problem with the hotel lens is that you lose the ability
3466.80s: to make money on the market, the interim market movements that then can allow you to build in
3474.08s: even bigger position. That's the main thing I try to make people aware of again, at least a
3480.32s: consideration. So let's say, let's say that you have 500 shares. The way that I would think about
3493.28s: it is maybe one to 150 become total. This means that they don't move, right? And this is 100, by the
3501.92s: way. These don't move. These will stay in the portfolio. There's no doing anything with them. These
3508.80s: are the ones that you're saying I want to hold all these. But then what that does is it gives you
3515.84s: something to work with, 350 to 400 shares, that allow you to play these interim moves, right? So
3526.24s: let's literally just look at a hypothetical to hopefully display the impact here.
3536.16s: This we can get rid of. That's fine. We'll just go down here.
3546.72s: So let's say that you have your 500 shares and let's say 100 gets locked up.
3554.40s: Meaning you're not going to do anything with what basis do we want to use for the 500 shares?
3557.84s: You guys tell me we can use whatever you want. I want to start the scenario from back here,
3562.24s: though. So this is going to be adjusted, split adjusted. So I'm thinking like 375 or 4 bucks,
3570.32s: kind of the high point. I'm not like bottom taking it. So we'll call it 4 bucks.
3576.16s: Unless you guys have a number you want to use instead, you'll tell me.
3580.96s: So we got 500 shares at 4 bucks. It means we have 2 grand invested at the onset.
3589.68s: So what we're doing is we're saying we're going to take 100 of those shares. Same basis.
3597.28s: And we're just saying I want this to just essentially be on its own, be removed from the sample.
3605.04s: So then that leaves us our 400 shares at the same basis.
3611.04s: $1,600 cost. So now let's say during this up move and this is using a weekly candle.
3625.28s: So there's a lot of sub-movement that goes on in here. We'll actually zoom in a little more
3632.24s: nuance so that you can see it more specifically. We got to go back.
3636.80s: Really? That's too far. It doesn't matter.
3655.92s: Okay.
3658.40s: So let's say that you started with your basis around 4, meaning you had gotten in some time
3665.84s: in this time period. Then you get your first leg up and now it's trading around 10.
3674.08s: So for people that are holding game stop like double in change, that's really not that's not that much.
3681.84s: Doesn't matter quite that much. So maybe not offloading here, but maybe setting a stop below.
3690.16s: And let's say that the stop would sit somewhere around 824.
3694.64s: So placing the stop below this near term support. So then what that does
3702.32s: is we have a new spot that we are entertaining being stopped.
3709.04s: So in this case, our stop would be 840, I think I said.
3713.76s: Close to that, whatever.
3719.68s: So then what we do is we can say, well, all right, if I get stopped here, I'm going to unwind maybe
3730.48s: a third, 20%. You can pick whatever amount makes sense. But what I'm showing you is,
3738.48s: like, this is a way to steadily scale into and out of a move.
3744.48s: And I'm just going to spitball it really fast. But there's an important lesson that I just
3750.08s: want you to keep in the back of your minds as we go through this. So let's say we run 20% position sizing.
3764.16s: So we would take 80 shares down at this basis.
3769.68s: So then that takes us
3780.32s: 352 bucks. So this is what we have now. First starting in our profit pile.
3790.08s: And we can see our residual shares
3793.12s: that tinker with are now down to 320. Okay. So now let's say you get your next big leg up.
3805.52s: And let's say during this bit of a down move, you decide to scale a little bit more out
3812.56s: as it's hitting, let's say just below the high here, whatever, I'm just kind of picking numbers.
3818.48s: But let's say 1640. Okay. So now
3836.80s: I'm going to lock this one so that we can just drag and drop.
3839.60s: So now we decide that we want to do another 20% scale. That means we're going to take 64 shares out.
3855.84s: So now our total PNL.
3869.20s: is 1145. This is realized of our initial money. We have a 57% gain.
3883.76s: So by all accounts, incredible return. But again, I know the way that this works for people that
3893.20s: are doing this where most people are thinking, well, this isn't enough. I really want more.
3900.16s: I'm looking for again, to have like life changing wealth. The problem with this is if you do that,
3910.56s: then there's a chance you start to miss opportunities, which I'll show you.
3914.96s: So then it starts skyrocketing up. You get like this big massive gap up. And on this big
3921.12s: massive gap up, it starts trailing back down. But so let's say on the way down here, you decide to
3930.00s: eventually get out. And I'm going to pick 70. I'm literally just picking a really low number relative
3935.52s: to where it opened to start. So then we have another scale out. And in this case, we might run
3943.20s: again, another 20% scale out. In this case, maybe 25% because it's up so big.
3951.44s: So we increase our scale out amount a little bit. So now we're going to take 64 shares down at 70.
3964.24s: That nets us 42 hundred bucks. That gives us 53 69. We've made 268% return.
3973.28s: Okay. So now next day market opens.
3984.32s: And it opens here at 66 and it starts going down on the day. Obviously it had this massive shot up.
3996.00s: So let's say that there's two more exits that we take, maybe one above a hundred.
4003.60s: And let's say the second exit would be below the low of this day. So let's call that 62.
4014.48s: So when it's all the way up at 100.
4020.40s: Let's say we might scale out 50% of the position at that point because again, remember,
4026.96s: this isn't the whole position. You still have the total shares that are being used.
4032.72s: So you're not getting full out of the position. But in this case, you just made nine grand.
4044.00s: And then when we have this residual down move again, where we get out at 62,
4050.88s: maybe we scale this down again to like 25%.
4062.80s: So here we're going to peel off.
4083.28s: We got to move this one down. This times this. We're going to peel off another 24 shares.
4100.40s: So that gives us another 1392.
4103.20s: So we're going to do residual position 72 shares.
4110.16s: Okay. So next day, rallies back up. It opens gaps up here to 95.
4117.84s: And then let's say you start scaling out again here when it's at like 86.
4124.40s: And let's say that you're now getting a little more aggressive with trying to tailor this position down.
4139.84s: That means we're going to drop 18 shares on those 18 shares. We make 1476.
4148.40s: One of the things I want you to pay attention to here is look at how much money the account has
4154.56s: made. The assumptions that I've made so far have never been top-ticking it. It's always been taking
4161.28s: towards the lower end of the days. So I'm not like purposely overfitting tremendously. I'm overfitting
4168.40s: because I we know it happened. But I also didn't I'm just scaling out at a regular set cadence fluctuating
4176.72s: between 20, 25 and 50% sizing. Now notice how your account has actually grown 872%. You've made money.
4190.80s: Now your residual stock position here is 54 shares. And let's just say that we get rid of
4201.76s: 80% of it here at 56. This is more so just to wrap the example up so that it doesn't go forever.
4220.40s: So here we would unwind 43 shares.
4223.60s: Get 2246. One of the things I want you to pay attention to is how you're not having to unwind huge
4234.24s: pieces of the portfolio in order to make a lot of money. So then let's say as it gets back down here
4243.12s: and let's say when it closes here at 1317, you finish your exit.
4253.12s: So on that residual position there, you make 396. You still have your 150 shares.
4267.52s: But or your 100 shares. Here's the important thing. Now as game stop, let's say comes down here,
4276.56s: sub sub 10 sub 11. Let's say in here, you decide that you want to start grabbing shares when it's
4284.00s: at like 11 and change. Take a look at how much money you have. You just made 20 grand. So if we take
4295.36s: a look at what we can get into based on the money that we made, you can get 1800 shares.
4306.64s: Take a look at what you were able to start with at your $4 basis with 2 grand.
4314.80s: Right? You were able to pick up 500 shares total. But by taking profit as things are moving,
4322.80s: you can now, even though it's a higher basis, you can get 1800 in 26 shares.
4329.76s: You can build a much bigger position. And over the course of this, for the person that chose to hold
4337.92s: again, you got to do it's right for you. But their PNL would have looked massive.
4345.92s: But it's an unrized PNL that's going to continue to move as long as the position is open.
4352.32s: So the tricky part here is you kind of have to find what's right for you. But the main thing that I
4360.32s: would look to at least put in front of you is the concept of doing both. You can absolutely sequester
4372.56s: and hold part of the portfolio. But with something as volatile as game stop, there's so much money
4379.20s: to be made based on these interim movements that can make a huge difference in your life.
4387.92s: And I know what most people are doing. They're holding this 500 shares, hoping that they can sell it
4392.96s: for $1,000. Or more, maybe even more. Who knows. But even if we take a look at your $1,000 sale,
4402.08s: less your cost to get in times how many you have, it gives you 500 grand. Like that's if you
4409.12s: timed it perfectly. It's a lot of money. But the probability of you getting to this price point
4415.36s: is small. And then your ability to perfectly time your exit at that is also small. We can see that
4422.56s: in this scenario, the highest it got was like 120 in change. So that puts you at 58 grand.
4429.68s: That's if you top ticked it, you got out at the very top. So the point here is
4438.48s: you have to think through what actually helps you the most. And there's definitely something to
4446.32s: be said about holding for sure. There's also nothing that says that you can't hold the shares
4452.48s: and trade options around it. That's another choice. The problem though that I will remind you of
4459.12s: is let's say this scenario happens. And it goes up to 120. Your 500 shares are showing a profit
4465.44s: of 58 grand. That's huge. And then time passes. And then it's back down to where we were here at
4472.32s: 1317. Well, now what just happened? You're still making money, which is great. But you've literally
4483.36s: made a fraction and it's still unrealized. So the way I would be thinking about your ability to
4492.88s: position here is not just the process of like buying and selling for the sake of buying and selling,
4501.52s: but you can literally also internalize it as what this allows you to do in terms of your ultimate
4507.92s: objective. Even if you're one of like the stone cold hardcore apes, which I actually imagine most
4513.44s: of you here probably aren't exactly that because I also know that there's a pretty big aversion to
4519.28s: things like options and whatnot, which is obviously a big part of what I do. So that's just an
4523.76s: assumption. I'm sure a lot of you are apes in that you've been around for a long time. But
4528.72s: I would imagine most people here at least generally open to different approaches and ideas. And
4537.76s: the beautiful part here is that with something like GameStop, you can make an insane amount of money
4546.64s: while still ultimately pursuing your objectives. Because if you are one of those stone cold hardcore
4553.44s: apes, and your goal is just to accumulate as many shares, well, guess what happened in this scenario
4558.88s: that includes us trading in and out. You've gone from 500 shares. You're able to add 1826 in
4567.60s: addition to the 100 that you held. So which one of these is achieving that goal more deeply?
4574.96s: Well, this scenario you have three times the position that you had in the first scenario.
4582.96s: So as always, my objective is never to tilt the way you do things one way or the other.
4592.32s: I view my mission in this space to simply provide information so that people can make the best
4602.40s: possible choices for themselves. That fits your scenario as unique as your scenario will be.
4610.24s: So that's my TED Talk for today. Anything else we should take a look at before I wrap up. You could
4619.20s: throw it in the chat. Happy to take a look at one or two things real quick before I got a bounce.
4626.80s: And then in the meantime, I'm going to get my dinner order rocking and rolling.
4640.64s: Hems. We could take a look at Hems.
4651.60s: Or Gems. A fun one, I actually think from the last one.
4657.92s: One was I think it was this we were looking at.
4667.76s: And it was funny because oh no, this doesn't.
4671.68s: Was this it? No, magic. I think it was empty. No.
4679.36s: Mind madness. This is it. This was funny because we were literally just talking about this during
4684.56s: a stream pretty recently. And we were just looking at the price behavior. And we had talked about
4691.12s: how it did seem like this was in general, favoring upside,
4698.88s: upside movement, right? Like that's it looked like it was at an interim spot. So I thought that this
4704.16s: was actually pretty interesting that it ended up breaking the way that we were talking about.
4708.72s: And I mean, it's still just respecting this broader trend pretty well.
4714.56s: Anyways, I said I would look at Hems. Let's do that.
4718.48s: Very sideways still like very much in consolidation. I would say,
4725.12s: I think it still gets I've been setting alerts. My last one got triggered. That's why it was gone.
4732.64s: But near term, it really needs to beat.
4738.08s: It needs to beat this upside. And the good part is the consolidation looks like it's holding
4744.32s: the elevated levels here actually quite well. So the way that I typically treat stuff like this
4751.68s: is monitoring how well it continues to do this. And then if we start to get some tightening of the
4759.12s: range, which generally will proceed a more explosive style breakout.
4765.36s: The options chain have pretty significant call side skew, which I'm not so sure that I had that
4778.16s: in my bingo cards. Yeah. But we'll take a quick look and see
4795.60s: how that actually materializes because I'm unsure in terms of total premiums.
4806.48s: Let's see.
4825.44s: One mil, a bit. I mean, there's still definitely still call side in terms of overall positioning.
4838.64s: We take a look at the ball surface.
4846.08s: See, this is a good example as compared to what you saw in GameStop of how there's just way
4851.12s: more put skew. The calls are not trading super, super rich comparatively.
4861.60s: So if we look at like a 31 delta here, you're getting 96% vol.
4868.96s: Here at a 29, you're getting 90% vol, 90.82. So you're still getting a little bit of skew
4878.16s: out a little bit further, but just not that much. A few points.
4888.56s: So right now to me, Hymns just needs to figure out the consolidation.
4897.44s: We're out. We actually have to click.
4899.84s: So three point three against four six. So much tighter in Hymns.
4924.40s: 7 to 4, 5.
4933.28s: So there definitely is still like, there's still coffin up.
4937.84s: Still definitely coffin up for the calls, but yeah, it's not like at an exceeding pace compared to the puts.
4946.40s: The 60 handle, so pretty close to add the money than the 69s, that's funny.
4963.44s: And it looks like there's some puts being built out.
4970.56s: Yeah, it looks kind of sideways here to me.
4975.12s: That's like the broader, that's the broader trend that I see it will have overhead resistance that it has to get through.
4987.60s: And a big part of that is because of again, like this group in here. That might be,
4996.80s: they might be willing to hold longer, but my guess is there will be a certain cohort that top
5004.24s: tick this that we'll want to be getting out. These kinds of things, they look different to me when
5011.04s: they have all this overhead that they're going to eventually have to get through as compared to stuff that
5020.40s: less so. So like, if this was, if this giant you didn't happen,
5029.84s: but it had good earnings, and I think part of what you're seeing here is post earnings announcement drift.
5039.92s: Yeah, overall, pretty interesting. All right, game. Time for me to hop. Absolutely great hanging out with everybody as
5049.68s: per usual. Be an outlier. You guys are.
