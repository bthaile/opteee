 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you I show you you And change this stock again. Take a look at this. What, what, what, what am I doing wrong here? GME, maybe I'll just click it. Okay, so you just can't hit enter. That's good to know. It was like, why am I looking at the same thing over and over again? So if we take a look at the just last 12 quarters, right? And we poke through. We see the expected ranges have been quite volatile. And there's, if I were trading this for earnings, this would be a tough one for me for two reasons. One, because it has really big severity of moves. And they're in both directions up and down. And when it's reporting earnings normally, you can see even when it's within the expected range, the majority of instances, it's at the very end of the range. So here, here, here, here, here, it's like at the very end of the range. There's not a lot of money to be made from a whole perspective on something like this, which is difficult. Now, the cool part is since I'm trading a coverage strangle in it, then I'm essentially already in the position. So it doesn't necessarily matter a whole lot to me. And I think still even right now, I'm pretty much all in options. Yeah, I'm just in puts that are in 20 June. I'm in the 28s. So those are probably coming up due on time to exit, but not quite yet. If we get a decent price move, I probably would consider just starting to build an actual equity position. I've been slow in general on building equity positions in my coverage strangle just because of the way that the market is positioned, it's not really worth the cost to carry. Right. And when I say cost to carry, I don't mean outright in terms of like financing costs and stuff like that. I would really just mean the opportunity costs of holding the position. And also shame on me. I haven't even said, how do you guys yet? Sorry. Just like I got excited. Just jumped right into it. Looks like we got he's Tanner. Dokey pie. There we go. Sounds right? H a nod. Oh no, there's an end there. Oh shit. This is going to be one of those ones. We're going to go back to that one. Lauren Matthew in Scott. Get to see all of you. A fuck do I say this name? I feel like I've done this one before. And a non a non a non. That's my best guess. A non. I feel like I've done this before. Every once in a while, I come across names and hear that are just very very. Just as I said that, just as I was literally saying, I come across names and hear that can be very difficult to say. The next comment that pops up in the chat is from very fat cow. It's awesome. Runs me like Xbox gamer tags. If you play Xbox, you know what I'm talking about. Those gamer tags are fucking wild. So Matthew says you're using think or swim for looking this up. I'm watching from my phone. So listen via audio. No, this what I'm doing right now is I'm using unusual whales. Think or swim has the same thing. The only difference in think or swim is it's not as neat of a display. And I also don't think it plots this here, which is like the actual expected move. It just plots the implied vol realize vol and then price moving. So it's a slightly different view. This one is just a little more convenient because it puts everything in one spot. One of the things I found with like using different trading platforms and stuff is for the longest time I was so reluctant to pay for anything. And it's because I would always say like, Oh, it's available. I'll just do it myself. And I did that for a really really long time. The thing is. There's like a lot of stuff, right? So the thing is that's like a really poor person's mindset, which is fine. That's how I grew up. But it actually is a limiting factor. So what ends up happening is the amount of time it takes me to build all of the different things that I otherwise could pay and access and use is completely different. Now you guys all know I have an affiliation with them. So I have a deal with them. The platform and stuff like that. They're not sponsoring any of this stuff. But it's literally a tool that I use. So it those kinds of relationships I always feel like work well because it's like a natural again, this is a natural thing that I would use. I'm actually in the process of trying to get back into either some sort of terminal. I don't know if I want to go and grab a Bloomberg terminal. They're really not that crazy expensive. They're more than what would be reasonable for most people. But the thing is is like they're kind of fun for the information that they provide. But in terms of like how it actually would impact my functional trading, it would be about nil. However, the amount it would impact content creation would be massive because there's a ton of really cool information in there. But then there's also other versions, other like tier platforms like that kind of like icon and stuff like that. There's also S and P global IQ. Those ones are pretty solid. But this has most of what I need and from like earnings and stuff like this, this is pretty good. H says, Scarelli is trying to build a competitor, another terminal. Yeah, that's cool. I think that's good. I think the more competitors you can get in the space, the better, especially what's stuff like this because information really like it really is a premium. And there's a lot of. I don't want to say withholding, but it's pretty damn close to that. There's a lot of gated information. Now I'm okay with that by the way. That's okay because I also think people have gotten so spoiled where we just think everything should just be free for us, especially retail traders were the worst. We think everything should be free and it's psychotic because as soon as even as soon as you set up an entity to trade through if it's an LLC or something else, you have to pay for shit. You have to pay for quotes for streaming like you have to pay for normal stuff that most other entities have to pay for. It's just retail traders have gotten so used to this Goldilocks deal. And as always, you should pay attention to why that would be. Why is it that if I have an entity that's registered to trade, I have to pay for all this shit except for retail so much of that shit is free. Why would that be? It tells you a lot about the infrastructure. It's really funny because there's a lot of these small subtle cues like that that show the reality that people just go straight over the head. They don't even notice it. Each says the brokers are just generous, right? Exactly. Just great people. They just want everything. They just want the best for you. It's hilarious. For those that aren't out of curiosity, actually, genuinely out of curiosity. Do you know what I'm talking about? I'm curious like as I'm joking around who is unaware of like what I'm actually talking about here because I don't it's not like an inside joke, but people genuinely might not know. Age says we couldn't possibly be cattle like liquidity sort of. I actually wouldn't say that's the main thing because the liquidity provided by retail is not insignificant, especially depending on like what the underlying is. So there definitely is an element of liquidity, but it's actually even more broad than that. There you go. Matthew says free equals you are the products such revenue source fucking bingo. What a perfect way to frame that. For those that don't know how this works. So you have a broker and they provide access to markets. So let's just pretend these are all like streaming quotes. They provide access to markets and there's some brokers like I B for example, they have institutional level clients that still use them as in actual brokers. So it's not just all retail brokers, but if you're using something like Schwab, it's generally retail broker. There still are some institutional level clients through there. So if you have retail and then if you have institutional and again, institutional means a ton of things. This isn't just like the people that most people don't like like market makers and stuff like this. This is this and by the way, there's not really a ton of reasons not to not like market makers, but that aside, the retail side of this equation, we have completely different access to the broker and then to the exchanges then an institution. So if you think of things like streaming, which is literally just getting live data, this is free. This is paid for them. And it goes on and on with a lot of different things in this way. However, it's super important to understand the relationship between broker and retail because exactly as Matthew sniffs out the reason why retail is provided this access is for a couple very specific reasons. One, retail typically equals smaller, typically. And this will even be used at this kind of logic in really well known research papers, where for example, if you read the latest paper on zero DTEs, SPX, they essentially are assuming that if you trade more than a one lot, you're institutional or if you're trading naked options, you're institutional, which is funny because I don't consider myself institutional, but I absolutely would fall into that categorization there. So anyways, the assumption is smaller. So this means less money. So less money means that in order to pay for things like quoting streaming stuff like that for general access, that cost money, that amount of money can be prohibitive that can literally stop your ability to access. Let's say if you're starting with a $5,000 account and you got to pay what's called $200 a month in access, this is a meaningful amount of this is what 4% the meaningful amount of your money just just for access in a month. So the broader point here is it tells you a few things. One, it tells you that retail typically isn't making the fucking money, because if they were making the money and it was relatively easy to make the money and people know you can make the money, then this initial startup cost is palatable. But we know that not to be the case. We know that most fail. So the reason why the broker gives you this beautiful access, the reason why they give you really cool stuff like education is because they want you to trade. They want you to trade as often as possible. They want you to interact with the platform as much as you humanly can. And it's because what they're doing is they make a little bit of money off of you when you send your order through. You might have a commission if it's an options contract, if it's equity, that's essentially gone at least on the front end. Then as they route your order, it doesn't typically go directly to the exchange. Oh no, there's a break right here. And this break right here starts with them pooling orders. You get a bunch of different orders in here. Then there's literally firms, market making firms, other entities that will straight up buy this order flow. And then they will complete the circuit. Why the fuck would they buy your order flow? Again, you can deduce exactly what's happening here. So going all the way back to this mindset that retail traders have everything should be free. It's such a broken way of thinking. And it literally is just part of the same poverty, stricken mindset because the only reason why shit is free for you is because they are making money off of you. That's why it's because they're making money off of your order flow. Your broker side, the broker of arrangements and agreements that they have with the various firms that they partner with. IB agreements that you have to look at. Then the market making firm is able to either make money by just making money, making markets for the order flow. But they can also take directional bets based on whether or not it seems informed order flow. It's crazy. It's really, really cool. Now, and notice how I say that, it's really cool. The reason why it's so cool is because this provides an insane amount of access that otherwise would not be there. You just have to accept the world as it is and just learn to maneuver through it. Just because this is the case, doesn't mean that any of this is necessarily out to get you. It means that we live in the structure that we live in. If retail traders somehow magically got good at trading, some of this absolutely would change because that actually breaks this. They don't want this shit anymore. Same thing for anybody that internalizes your trade. They don't want it because they're internalizing an informed trade that they know they're probably going to fucking lose on still. They have to hedge it all the way through in order to make the fractions of a penny on the back end. That kind of stuff would all evolve pretty quickly. This is another reason why you should be thankful that trading is hard and why most people fail at it. It is the only reason why there's an opportunity here. That's all there is to it. So anyways, back to GameStop and back to earnings. My guess is earnings will probably be pretty mellow. So if we take a look at EPS estimates, they were expected at nine cents in Q1, Q2, they're expected at eight cents, Q2 year over year. Q2 estimate was down a dime. So I mean, this is what the path to profitability looks like. Negative scratch, scratch, it's like positive, positive. Now another estimate for positive. This is the path to profitability. It's not super sexy, but this is a company that has a big turn around that they need to navigate now. So when we're coming into earnings, my full expectations is probably pretty mellow, probably sideways unless there's some sort of broad market catalyst, which you guys all know, it's always one fucking tweet or X or truth or whatever the fuck around the corner that you can think of. We're seeing a beautiful marriage being just broken down shotgun style in front of our faces, which is hilarious. Just the way that the whole thing is going is so entertaining. I don't know. It's so funny to me like when I see people that are watching like dramas on TV or stuff like that. It's like literally just watch the news. You'll learn a little bit about the world around you and this shit's even crazier. It's literally insane. It's awesome. There's always stuff to look at. So let's take a quick look at what the options look like in here. And there's a couple things that we should peek at. First thing is let's just take a look at the general chain. Pretty quiet. The 20 June cycle is setting up to be pretty big based on the broad OI that I see. They're still pretty meaningful call OI skew. But as per usual, a ton of these are super super super far out of the monies. So let's take a look at 20 June here. I mean, all the money is on the call side. Four mill in call premium, who's 69 on put. So I mean, just huge skew skew skew skew skew skew. This is the very standard, the very standard upside expectation that people are paying, paying through the nose for this is interesting. That's really interesting. Oh, I think this is a lot of that position we saw getting built out a while ago. Yeah, on the tails, there's a little bit more on the put side, but in terms of expiration, but pretty much all the premiums on the call side. That's without a doubt. Let's see if there's any interesting trades. I already looked at this, but I'll look at it with you guys. All the filters are off. Okay. So I'm trying to see if there's anything new from when I looked last. Lots of like the put side is pretty busy. I'm going to turn that off for now so I can see easier. And then let's get rid of the sales. One of the reasons why you're going to see tons and tons and tons of calls being sold is because for those that have shares, the vol is still heavy and it's still typically worth selling on the call side. So if you take a look at 20 June, this vol is very rich, very, very rich. It's not outpacing the put side at the tails, but at the more usable strikes where people are going to be in the proximity of spot price. So if you're looking at like a 15, 15 strike on this side, we'll just take a look at an example. So if we take a look at a 15 strike, that's still a one Delta. So let's go to like a 20 Delta, something that's still pretty far out of the money. 21 Delta. Vol here is 81.7, 81.7, 21 Delta here. Vol is 126.62. So what I'm showing you is, it's why when you use the volatility surface, you have to be perceptive slightly because even though the tail looks like it's so much higher than the call side and that could lead somebody to inaccurately be like, oh, this has like crazy putts, you there's just not much in the calls. It's just not the case. There's a ton. There's a ton in the calls, especially when we normalize based on Delta for again, things that are within a certain bandwidth of at the money, whatever that is, which is right now, it's like 29.5. So we actually have pretty significant callsque in those closer strikes in terms of vol. So the vol, like the vol surface is so unbelievably useful for understanding the way that the market is expecting things to move and in what severity. It's not always correct, but it gives just incredible starting point, I think. And it's something that I literally use all the time because it gives you just a super streamlined view. Now with something like GameStop that's so prone to skew across a ton of different factors, it can be a little more difficult to perceive everything there because things can be so weird. But nonetheless, this looks like generally standard coming into earnings, like that's kind of what I see. There's not like crazy huge trades coming in. 20 June op-ex is absolutely going to be busy. And that's because there's a ton of premium in that cycle that's going to have to do something. So we'll get a we'll get a look at it and see how it ends up flushing out. But what I'm mostly going to be looking at is how do things shape up into earnings. So the next couple days is a perfect time to keep an eye out for things like any sort of big unusual options activity and stuff like that because that'll show like specific earnings driven positioning. So this is a really good time, like a really good window. Just keep an eye open to see if anything catches your eye so far, not so much. All right. Let me grab the DD library because I'm on a timer here. So I want to at least get through hopefully a couple of these. You have to figure out where the fuck we are. I think we did this one. I think we might be on this one. Does that sound right? Maybe this one? So did it all securities been fine 58 times for violating finra reg show SEC several instances of document is willful naked shorting in these 2020 they reported an increase in their short positions 127 year over year calling bullshit. Okay. Let's see. I'm just trying to see like what the let me start at the back and go go the other way. Sometimes starting with the conclusion is helpful for me. It's kind of like reading the abstract of a paper. I just want to know like what what are they posing to us right now? Where's the conclusion? Can't tell who's responsible for the flash crash and game stop. I don't think anybody can. This just wasn't market manipulation is laughable. All right. Here we go. The pressure being placed on hedge funds to deliver has been higher and the shift storm of corruption is coming to a head. Unfortunately the dirty tricks and Fud will continue. There's several catalysts coming up. However, desperate times, desperate measures. Okay. So this seems like this person is more just expressing frustration. And I don't see a lot relating to like the broader theory on game stop and stuff. Okay. I do want to take a look at this part though. Citadel is a conglomerate. Yep. We know this managing a lot of money. The value of those options changed dramatically in short amount of time. Yep. Okay. So this is just saying that they're in a lot of stuff. Well, COVID we've all heard stories of brick and mortar going bankrupt become very profitable to bet against the continuity of these companies. So big fucks like Citadel decided to up their portfolio by 127 and a half. So this is not true. In terms of like the implication that they're trying to arrive at. I just realized the bottom of this is cut off. You guys sorry. We squeeze it up. The implication that they're trying to allude to here. So think of it this way. When we think of brick and mortar stores going bankrupt during COVID. Well, let's. As always, rather than speculate. Let's investigate. So in the US, how many publicly traded. For and non publicly traded. And companies. When bankrupt during COVID. Let's see. And we're using. We're using our buddy Gemini. Let's see what we get. And I'll tie this back. Don't worry. Total of 21 655 business bankruptcies. 110 publicly traded. So for context, if you think of publicly traded companies, there's 6000. A little over that. 6 to 7000. So the total that actually went bankrupt was very small as a total amount. The reason why I'm saying this is just because. Again, I have absolutely no love for Citadel at all. I just so heavily prioritized trying to be as objective in analysis. Again, the thing I will always remind you all is that if you are more objective in your analysis, you will be able to find more and more meaningful things that you can do stuff with. So. This there's not like a ton of profit that they were going to draw from small businesses going bankrupt because the vast majority of them are small businesses that are not publicly traded that they can't get a position on into short. So the thing to keep in mind is most of the time during really volatile markets, market making firms provided they can keep their shit together. They can make so much money. And it's because of standard market behavior that we all at least I think most of us know about and I'll show you. Remember market makers most often they're trying to collect the bid as spread. So if you have a bid and you have an ask or what we refer to as the offer. So let's say that this is a normal period of time the markets are like we see right now. So let's say that something is too pennies wide. What that means is that the total spread represented between the difference here is two pennies. So in order for them to make money, they're essentially grinding away. And when I say market making firms, by the way, I'm referring to the algorithms that they run. This isn't like physical dudes clicking the button. So. What ends up happening during highly highly volatile periods is this spread becomes something like this. And it literally can go from two pennies to a dollar, a dollar plus. It can be all over the place. So what ends up happening is during these periods provided they can manage their risk. Look at how much more money they make per trip. Provided that they can manage the risk appropriately. Walking on. So that's one of the big reasons why you will see institutions, specifically those with market making arms do really, really well during super volatile periods. They'll make a lot more money. Lauren says shorting amplifies a problem in a company already in distress, but it doesn't necessarily cause bankruptcy in my opinion. Yeah, no, it definitely wouldn't. That's correct. And I agree with that. I think you have to think about the pressure it adds, which is significant. So it definitely and I think the way you framed it is exactly correct amplifies a problem. I think that that's super fair. And this is why I think it's important to go back to like the idea of just basic market dynamics, right? If you're trying to short something that is fundamentally really sound and people can see that the shorts typically get their face ripped off and it happens pretty regularly. It's why there's a name for it short squeezes because they might try to proxy into something that might be kind of weak and then somebody else might say, I don't think so. I think it's pretty strong. And enough people have that counter position. All of a sudden you get some by pressure shorts have to close they end up buying into the own rally and then boom. They're you're off to the races with a pretty disadvantaged position that they have to try to manage is very difficult. Joseph says the dude on the other side of the trade loses on a non passive participant. Could you explain more the dude on the other side of a trade the person that's most often on the other side of your trade is a market maker. So they don't really care what happens. In terms of whether or not they're passive or not passive we don't know. Joseph says meaning you buy the offer you're down right away on the spread from the bid. Yeah. So that's typically the case. So depending on how the market moves right the market doesn't stay static. Because your trade gets filled if things slide that can happen or if they stay static then you might show no change at all because that just might be where the market is at that point. The other thing you'll find on the port on your portfolio is that you'll typically be quoted against the midpoint not necessarily the bid or the offer which might be more appropriate based on where you might get a fill or how wide something is. I find that a lot when I'm trading things like ratio called diagonals that are further out in time and less liquid it can show a much better profit than is actually there. Okay cool let's check out another another one. This one. Jesus. I don't know what this is but I love it. Do you guys know where is this from something that I just don't know. This is fucking hilarious. Oh I love this. I have absolutely no frame of reference for what this is from but the hostage situation would be over in this circumstance that's for sure. God that's funny. Does hostage is explaining why the moass is taking so long how the January spike was stopped Robin Hood's motives for trading haunt in the mysterious silence of the SEC. What is T. A mean I know T LDR. What's T. A. The January moass is delayed because citadel to costages they figured out how to ensure others would be squeezed before they were. Oh curious. They all to trading because the relationship. You guys are way more normal than I am. H says transfer agent Lauren says technical analysis I was thinking like too autistic didn't read like too long didn't read. EA. I went the wrong way I guess they figured out how to ensure others are squeezed before them they halted trading because the relationship. Citadel turn them into a hostage moass waits until regulators soon the hostages. And he came let's read more. Citadel wasn't going to be squeezed in January Robin Hood was Citadel took hostage to figure out how to ensure that others were squeezed before they were. Robin Hood halted trading after game stop was on the threshold list 35 days 35 failures to deliver broker becomes responsible for delivering the security of the customer the moass is taking so long. Because citadel managed to figure out how to make their short position other people's problem. This is why citadel seems to have so many people protecting it willing to live for it. These ones are tough because it's like very entrenched in a position so I'm not going to like bother going through it. I'm just going to accept it as what it is and see what we can learn from here. So let us continue. Theory Robin Hood halted trading the day they became liable for delivery of GME shares Citadel sold to their customers. Okay. I think Robin Hood halted trading because they were required to purchase games upstairs and deliver to customers pass orders. Okay. So if I wanted to sell a share on the market. I do not want to sold share directly to the buyer of that share send myself order into the market via my broker send that off to the market sensor. Where it's executed by market maker sell my share to the market maker executing the trade. They sell that share to the broker. This is partially correct. Yeah. I suspect citadel had been feeling to deliver GME shares to Robin Hood for an extended period. I don't know where this relationship or like the tie that they're making between Citadel and Robin Hood. But my expectation is that the it would actually be potentially I don't know who their I be is or with. So my expectation is that this would be even more complicated actually than this. I think it's really one set got to pop the door for the old boy. So a bad. So anyway, let's continue. Robin has to buy the shares they expected citadel. Where is this? Do you guys have any context on where this. Where this relationship is like very lat like unilateral relationship. Has been thought out I don't fully understand why they're. Why they're thinking this. But it might be more founded. It says back then apex apex was Robin Hood's clearing firm confirm from last year in FGF that they do the same on things around lending shares to brokers before they have possession of them. Yeah, that definitely I agree with. Each says a large group of traders were trading reverse stocks split rounding at the time apex would give shares that weren't supposed to exist on paper to folks the next day after. Yep, I think that that's. I think that that all makes sense to me and I definitely would think that that that that happens. So is it the case where they're thinking. Anyways, let me continue. The Del still owns Robin Hood shares at some point Robin Hood has to deliver to their customers now. Okay. You expected to be a relationship between Robin Hood halt. The other users pointed out the purchase prices and dates incorrectly reported while transferring from Robin Hood to other brokers. This is because Robin Hood initially sold their users shares based on delivery promises made by Citadel and failed to fulfill. This I struggle with. I hope why my analysis is 605 data found the proportion of GameStop order executions done through NASDAQ spikes in February this can make sense I agree with this. Despite being almost non existent. Yeah, I think that that's absolutely. I think there's something to that because the market plumbing is really important and actually Dave Lauer and I talked about this a little bit on a podcast we did a little while ago. That was a pretty good conversation about why orders would be routed between exchanges and in different capacity. So I could absolutely get behind that. Robin Hood wasn't the only one that halted trading. It's difficult but not impossible for Citadel to have orchestrated this behind the scenes. See, this I feel like starts just going too far. I think the probability that Citadel was like the mastermind behind all of this. It really doesn't even register for me mostly because the fact is I don't think the market actors broadly we're going to allow the stock market to potentially explode due to this. So I think there's a point regardless of what it's whether it's Citadel or another entity regulator that decides to step in and fully halt. Simply to stop it from going overly parabolic which can happen it absolutely can happen and this goes back into the idea of like moass I don't think is as appealing of a thing as people think it is simply because you can't make money if the thing that you're making money in goes away. So you might be showing some sort of great profit until it literally just goes away. Then there's not like some massive settlement where people would just get whatever their account was at there would be a broader settlement of distributing of what's left. So the other thing I will continually remind people of is the squeeze was stopped already right so if we go back the squeeze was stopped. So what ends up happening is regulators again regardless of who it is they step in and they say this isn't going to go any further this needs to stop here. And when that happens they've already made the choice to put the ceiling on so there's not really a world that I see where we go into the future and then the regulators at that point are instead now like. Let's just let it go they've already shown where the line is the line was here we saw it we saw when there was that fraction of a game stop share that traded for what a few thousand bucks so like we could very clearly see where the line is. So the reason why this matters is more for like the actual investor it's not because you know I have a hope or dis hope I don't know if that's a word of this happening I'm indifferent to it because I would trade it either way. But the reason why I spend the time talking about these things on these streams especially with like the ape community and the game stop folks it's not to try to discourage people you should again do whatever is right for you but it would be really frustrating if people go into this with an expectation not understanding the broader reality and making an informed decision right in informed decision being let's say you have 500 shares of game stop. And let's say game stop starts making this parabolic run up and then you're in the mindset because you heard somebody on you know red it somewhere say well I'm not I shouldn't sell until there's telephone numbers okay well what's really shitty is if you wait for that and then it's now down here because the buy button got turned off regulator stepped in and literally forcibly stopped the squeeze. That sucks now the way that I would think about taking profit in an event like this is the way that's literally what I did which is standard scaling so it's starting with a certain size position as the move starts to heat up it's phasing out slowly keeping smaller bits on as runners so that you can enjoy the maximize the amount of the move that you can get. Now as I'll always point out this is from a trader lens right that's what I am a trader so that means that I need to move in and out of things this is very different than the hotel lens which is also completely viable the problem with the hotel lens is that you lose the ability to make money on the market the interim market movements that then can allow you to build. To build in even bigger position that's the main thing I try to make people aware of again at least a consideration so let's say. Let's say that you have 500 shares. The way that I would think about it is maybe one to one fifty become hold all. This means that they don't they don't move right and this is 100 by the way these don't move these will stay in the portfolio there's no doing anything with them these are the ones that you're saying I want to hold all these but then what that does is it gives you something to work with 350 to 400 shares. That allows you to play these interim moves right so let's let's literally just look at a hypothetical hopefully display the impact here. This we can get rid of that's fine we'll just go down here. So let's say that you have your 500 shares and let's say 100 gets locked up meaning you're not going to do anything with what basis do we want to use for the 500 shares you guys tell me we use whatever you want I want to start the scenario from back here though so this is going to be adjusted split adjusted so I'm thinking like three seventy five or four bucks kind of the high point I'm not like bottom taking it. So we'll call it four bucks unless you guys have a number you want to use instead you'll tell me. So we got 500 shares at four bucks. It means we have two grand invested at the onset so what we're doing is we're saying we're going to take a hundred of those shares same basis. And we're just saying I want this to just essentially be on its own be removed from the sample so then that leaves us. Our 400 shares at the same basis. 1600 dollar cost so now. Let's say during this up move and this is using a weekly candle so there's a lot of sub movement that goes on in here will actually zoom in a little more. New wants so that you can see it more specifically we got to go back really that's too far it doesn't matter. Okay. So let's say that you started with your basis around four meaning you had gotten in sometime in this time period then you get your first leg up and now it's trading around ten. So for people that are holding game stop like double and change that's really not that's not that much doesn't matter quite that much so maybe not offloading here but maybe setting a stop below. And let's say that the stop would sit somewhere around eight twenty four right so place in the stop below this near term support so then what that does. Is we have a new spot that we are entertaining being stopped so in this case our stop would be eight forty I think I said close to that whatever. So then what we do is we can say well all right if I get stopped here I'm going to unwind maybe a third twenty percent you can pick whatever amount make sense but what I'm showing you is like this is a way to steadily scale into an out of a move and I'm just going to spit ball it really fast but there's an important lesson that I just want you to keep in the back of your minds as we go through this. So let's say we run twenty percent position sizing. So we would take eighty shares down at this basis. So then that takes us. 352 bucks so this is what we have now first starting in our profit pile and we can see our residual shares. The tinker with. Are now down to three twenty okay so now let's say you get your next big leg up and let's say during this bit of a down move you decide to scale a little bit more out as it's hitting let's say just below the high here whatever I'm just kind of picking numbers but let's say sixteen forty. Okay so now. I'm going to lock this one so we can just drag and drop. So now we decide that we want to do another twenty percent scale. That means we're going to take sixty four shares out. So now our total P and L. Is eleven forty five this is realized. Of our initial money we have a fifty seven percent gain. So by all by all accounts incredible return but again I know the way that this works for people that are doing this where most people are thinking well this isn't enough I really want more. I'm looking for again to have like life changing wealth. The problem with this is if you do that then there's a chance you start to miss opportunities which I'll show you. So then it starts skyrocketing up you get like this big massive gap up and on this big massive gap up it starts trailing back down. So let's say on the way down here you decide to eventually get out and I'm going to pick seventy I'm literally just picking a really low number relative to where it opened to start. So then we have another scale out and in this case we might run again another twenty percent scale out in this case maybe twenty five percent because it's up so big. So we increase our scale out amount a little bit. So now we're going to take sixty four shares down at seventy. That nets us forty two hundred bucks that gives us fifty three sixty nine we made two hundred sixty eight percent return. Okay so now next day market opens. And it opens here at sixty six and it starts going down on the day obviously it had this massive shot up. So let's say that there's two more exits that we take maybe one above a hundred. And let's say the second exit would be below the low of this day so let's call that sixty two. So when it's all the way up at a hundred. Let's say we might scale out fifty percent of the position at that point because again remember this isn't the whole position you still have the hotel shares that are being used so you're not. You're not getting full out of the position but in this case you just made nine grand. And then when we have this residual down move again where we get out at sixty two maybe we scale this down again to like twenty five percent. So here we're going to. We're going to. We're going to move this one down this times this we're going to peel off another twenty four shares. So that gives us another thirteen ninety two. Residual position seventy two shares. Okay so next day rallies back up it opens gaps up here to ninety five. And then let's say you start scaling out again here when it's at like eighty six. Let's say that you're now getting a little more aggressive with trying to tailor this position down. That means we're going to drop eighteen shares on those eighteen shares we make fourteen seventy six. One of the things I want you to pay attention to here is look at how much money the account has made the assumptions that I've made so far have never been top ticking it. It's always been taking towards the lower end of the days. So I'm not like purposely overfitting tremendously I'm overfitting because I we know it happened but I also didn't I'm just scaling out at a regular set cadence fluctuating between twenty twenty five and fifty percent. So twenty five and fifty percent sizing now notice how your account has actually grown eight hundred seventy two percent you've made money. Now your residual stock position here is fifty four shares. And let's just say that we get rid of eighty percent of it here at fifty six. This is more so just to wrap the example up so that it doesn't go forever. So here we would unwind forty three shares. Get twenty two forty six one of the things I want you to pay attention to is how you're not having to unwind huge pieces of the portfolio in order to make a lot of money. So then let's say as it gets back down here and let's say when it closes here at thirteen seventeen you finish your exit. So on that residual position there you make three ninety six you still have your hundred fifty shares. But are your hundred shares here's the important thing now as game stop let's say comes down here sub sub ten sub eleven. Let's say in here you decide that you want to start grabbing shares when it's at like eleven and change. Take a look at how much money you have you just made twenty grand. So if we take a look at what we can get into based on the money that we made you can get eighteen hundred shares. Take a look at what you were able to start with at your four dollar basis with two grand. Right you were able to pick up five hundred shares total. But by taking profit as things are moving you can now even though it's a higher basis you can get eighteen hundred in twenty six shares. You can build a much bigger position and over the course of this for the person that chose to hold again you have to do it's right for you. But there piano would have looked massive. But it's an unrealized piano that's going to continue to move as long as the position is open. So the tricky part here is you have you kind of have to find what's right for you but the main thing that I would look to at least put in front of you is the concept of doing both. You can absolutely sequester and hold part of the portfolio but with something is as volatile as game stop there's so much money to be made based on these interim movements that can make a huge difference in your life. And I know what most people are doing they're holding this five hundred shares hoping that they can sell it for a thousand dollars. Or more maybe even more who knows but even if we take a look at your thousand dollar sale less your cost to get in times how many you have. It gives you five hundred grand like that's if you timed it perfectly it's a lot of money. But the probability of you getting to this price point is small and then your ability to perfectly time your exit at that is also small. We can see that in this scenario the highest it got was like one twenty and change so that puts you at fifty eight grand that's if you top ticked it you got out at the very top so the point here is you have to think through what actually helps you the most. And there's definitely something to be said about holding for sure there's also nothing that says that you can't hold the shares and trade options around it that's another choice. The problem though that I will remind you of is let's say this scenario happens and it goes up to one twenty your five hundred shares are showing a profit of fifty eight grand this huge. And then time passes and then it's back down to where we were here at thirteen seventeen. Well now what just happened. You're still making money which is great but you've literally made a fraction and it's still unrealized so. The way I would be thinking about your ability to position here is not just the process of like buying and selling for the sake of buying and selling but you can literally also internalize it as what this allows you to do in terms of your ultimate objective. Even if you're one of like the stone cold hard core apes which I actually imagine most of you here probably aren't exactly that because I also know that there's a pretty big a version to things like options and what not which is obviously a big part of what I do so that's just an assumption I'm sure a lot of you are apes and that you've been around for a long time but I would imagine most people here at least generally open to different approaches and ideas and. The beautiful part here is that with something like GameStop you can make. And insane amount of money while still ultimately pursuing your objectives because if you are one of those stone cold hard core apes and your goal is just to accumulate as many shares well guess what happened in this scenario that includes us trading in and out. You've gone from 500 shares you're able to add 1826 in addition to the 100 that you held so which one of these is achieving that goal more deeply well this scenario you have three times the position that you had in the first scenario so as always my objective is never to tilt the way you do things one way to get that. You do things one way or the other I view my mission in this space to simply provide information so that people can make the best possible choices for themselves that fits your scenario as unique as your scenario will be. So that's my Ted talk for today anything else we should take a look at before I wrap up you could throw it in the chat happy to take a look at one or two things real quick. Before I got a bounce and then in the meantime I'm going to get my dinner order rock and rollin. Hems we could take a look at him's. For gims a fun one I actually think from the last one. Was I think it was this we were looking at and it was funny because no this doesn't. Was this it no magic I think it was empty no. This was funny because we were literally just talking about this during a stream pretty recently and we were just looking at the price behavior and you know we had talked about how it did seem like this was in general. And we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that we were just talking about the fact that I wanted to let you know you would have been clear about the fact of... The fact of reading to you, it was pretty amazing. The fact of reading you would just put me in the shoes to do this and then if we start to get some tightening of the range which generally will proceed a Yeah. But we'll take a quick look and see how that actually materializes, because I'm unsure in terms of total premiums. Let's see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One mil again. A bit. I mean, there's still definitely still call side in terms of overall positioning. We take a look at the wall surface. Well, there we go. Thank you. This is a good example as compared to what you saw in GameStop of how there's just way more put skew the calls are not trading super, super rich, comparatively. So if we look at like a 31 delta here, you're getting 96% ball. 90% vol 90.82. You're still getting a little bit of skew out a little bit further, but just not that much. A few points. So right now to me, him's just needs to figure out the consolidation. We actually have to click. So 3.3 against 4.6. So much tighter in him's. 7 to 4.5. So there definitely is still like, there's still coughing up. Still definitely coughing up for the calls, but yeah, it's not like at an exceeding pace compared to the puts. The 60 handle. So pretty close to add the money than the 69s. That's funny. And it looks like there's some puts being built out. Yeah, it looks, it looks kind of sideways here to me. That's like the broader. That's the broader trend that I see. It will have overhead resistance that it has to get through. And a big part of that is because of again, like this group in here. That might be. They might be willing to hold longer, but my guess is there will be a certain cohort at top tick this that will want to be getting out. These kinds of things, they look different to me when they have all this overhead that they're going to eventually have to get through as compared to stuff that less so. So like if this was, if this giant you didn't happen, but it had good earnings. And I think part of what you're seeing here is post earnings announcement drift. Yeah. Overall, pretty interesting. All right, game. Time for me to hop. Absolutely great hanging out with everybody as per usual. Be an outlier. You guys are
