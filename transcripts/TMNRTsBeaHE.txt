0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.68s: I'm going to walk you through some of my favorite ways
4.40s: to use the Analyze tab in Thinker Swim.
7.20s: Actually came up during a workshop today,
8.96s: so I figured this would be a good reference video for folks.
12.08s: So there's a bunch of different things
13.88s: in the Analyze tab on the top.
15.60s: It's just outside the windows, you can't see it,
17.48s: but I'll read them off to you.
18.88s: There's ad simulated trades,
20.76s: so this is kind of like paper trading.
22.20s: There's the risk profile, probability analysis,
25.32s: economic data, think back, fundamentals and earnings.
29.56s: We're going to go through all of them.
30.76s: Now simulated trades is kind of just paper trading for today.
33.76s: I don't really use this much myself,
35.96s: but it's in there in case you want it.
38.44s: Then the risk profile I use all the time.
40.52s: And this helps us understand how a certain position
43.72s: is set to perform in a few different ways,
47.40s: and I'll explain how.
48.68s: So the Y axis here is representing the P and L for the position.
53.20s: This is your zero line.
55.00s: Anything above this is positive returning.
57.80s: Anything below negative.
59.20s: You can see this goes from 1,000, 2,000, 3,000,
61.52s: so on and so forth.
62.36s: Same thing to the downside on the negative side.
64.92s: Now the X axis shows us different prices for the underlying.
71.44s: So you'll see it's essentially just increasing
74.12s: from left to right.
76.28s: So you can zoom this in or out as you want,
78.72s: as you can see just by clicking and dragging,
80.72s: I can change the scale of things.
82.84s: So I can compress things down super far,
85.24s: or I can spread them out so that they make
87.44s: a little bit more sense for what we're looking at.
89.68s: So that's this.
91.20s: Now these different vertical lines,
93.84s: you can control to be whatever you want.
96.64s: As you can see down here,
98.68s: I have them currently as different standard deviations.
102.48s: So I have plus one, plus two, plus three,
104.32s: minus one, minus two, minus three.
106.16s: And then this middle one is the spot price.
109.64s: So we can tell 36, 79, which is right here.
112.84s: It's telling us the current spot price, which is this one.
115.60s: So this is this line here.
118.32s: So then as you move out, this is minus, well, quick pause.
123.84s: This is whatever, essentially, you want it to be.
127.16s: You can set this to be whatever price.
129.56s: So you'll also notice down at the bottom here,
132.00s: I have a couple other prices that are key coded in,
134.96s: one at 3190, one at 4434.
137.88s: Why is that?
138.56s: Well, for this trade example that we were looking at,
141.52s: those were the stops for the trade that we were looking at.
145.56s: So in this case, the 3190 here,
148.56s: and then the 4434 here actually represents those two positions
153.96s: so that I could easily see what the P and L would be at those.
158.04s: So then in order to find the plus one and minus one standard deviation,
162.20s: you have to go out here and here.
164.36s: And you'll notice it gives you the probabilities up here.
167.20s: So this says 15, 8, 5%.
169.84s: This says 15, 8, 7%.
171.40s: So it's automatically giving you the probabilities on top of them.
174.52s: And then so on and so forth for the rest.
176.96s: So you can change these.
178.12s: Actually, you can change them by going over here
180.16s: and by hitting set slices.
182.24s: You can do some sort of percentages is really, really common.
187.24s: There's another really common one that I like to use,
190.24s: which shows like 5% steps in the underlying like this.
195.48s: You can essentially make it whatever you want.
197.36s: I find standard deviations to be most useful.
199.56s: Again, I'm kind of a statistic minded myself.
202.64s: So then if you click the default, it'll give you plus one minus one.
206.32s: And then if you want to add more, you can just hit this plus button
209.52s: on the right hand side.
210.72s: Change these by clicking on them.
213.00s: And then I can add my plus two minus two and then so on and so forth as much as I want.
219.64s: So the other thing you'll notice on this is that as you look at this position,
224.88s: you notice that there are two lines that actually can be even more.
228.16s: We can have four lines if there were four legs,
233.08s: but in this case, there's not four legs.
235.12s: There's technically only two legs.
237.72s: So what are these different lines?
239.16s: Well, if you'll notice over here, they give you three different dates.
243.72s: So what these are showing you are the P and L
247.44s: for these specific combination of positions at different points.
252.84s: So in this case, 816, that's today.
255.04s: It's showing you the P and L for your trades today.
258.04s: And then 9-7, it's using the first exploration for the closest expiring leg.
264.56s: So in this case, there's one leg in this trade.
267.20s: This is, I think a ratio called diagonal.
269.00s: Oh, no, this is calls inputs.
271.20s: I just picked random stuff for the example.
274.04s: So in this case, though, the put side is in six set.
279.88s: So that's what the blue line is.
281.88s: It's showing you when that leg would expire.
285.20s: But again, the blue line is still the entire position combined.
289.08s: It's just giving you the date variance or whatever the first leg expires at.
296.64s: And then the 1019 shows you the rest of the trade,
301.04s: the longer expiration leg when this whole trade would look like
306.56s: when that comes up to expiration.
308.88s: So obviously, at that point, the short calls would be,
311.60s: or in this case, the short puts would be gone.
314.08s: So the other thing you can do is click into these
316.72s: and remove individual legs if you just want to see
321.04s: how something would perform, which is kind of cool
324.56s: by isolating the individual legs.
327.68s: A couple of notes, you can change those different lines.
331.88s: You can do it based on the passage of specific days,
336.12s: changes in volatility.
337.84s: It's really up to you.
339.32s: You can also change the metric.
341.08s: So it's showing the total PNL, the PNL on the day,
344.60s: the individual, the Greeks, so that you have a sense of how
349.80s: the position behaves as it moves around.
353.04s: Now, for probability mode, I like to use the probability of a touch
357.24s: because for most of the stuff that I use,
360.16s: it is predicated on management as things get to different levels,
364.28s: which is based more so again on touch.
366.76s: Because when we look at probability of in the money or out of the money,
369.12s: that really refers to at expiration.
371.28s: So I typically will use touch.
373.52s: And then the probability range is adjustable.
376.32s: So this is using a one standard deviation range.
378.56s: You could do two standard deviation or three standard deviation
380.88s: ranges.
381.96s: And then you can also use different times,
384.92s: again, based on the steps that you're using for the data here.
389.00s: So right now, it's defaulting to the long leg,
393.40s: the longest expiration leg as the ultimate date,
396.32s: but you can change that if you want.
398.32s: So you'll notice as I hover over it and move around,
401.88s: that in the middle, it shows you the price at the P&L of the underlying.
407.64s: So that's what it is right in the middle.
409.08s: Then down at the bottom, it shows you the price of the underlying.
412.72s: And then on the left hand side, it shows you the P&L
415.32s: at those different points in time.
417.56s: So then down here, you'll see it shows you the position delta gamma theta
421.36s: Vega for each of those points.
424.64s: And then it also shows you the P&L for the individual day
429.64s: for open, what the net liquidity would be,
432.04s: and then the expected margin requirements.
434.08s: So there's a ton, a ton of details in here.
437.72s: Now a couple other small things,
439.68s: you can tinker with the interest rate down here
442.00s: or you can lock it so it doesn't change.
444.08s: You can change the volatility pricing model.
446.72s: So you can use kind of their proprietary method
449.44s: that they kind of adjust slightly.
451.36s: You can use binomial black sholes, whatever you want.
454.04s: You can group the symbols into different things.
456.88s: There's literally a ton of other things
458.60s: that's really quite a lot of people don't know,
460.24s: is you could look at the entire portfolio
462.68s: as compared to one individual ticker, which is kind of nice.
466.40s: So another note here is that if you click this little cog
470.60s: on the side over here, you can change the stock price
474.16s: in here as you want, or more importantly,
477.64s: you can change the volatility.
479.48s: And if you hit this thing over here, more parameters,
481.88s: you can change the volatility for individual legs if you want.
486.20s: This just helps you see how things move.
488.52s: So that's a general walkthrough of this.
491.32s: There's kind of some more corky little things in there
493.68s: but I think that's kind of a good overview.
495.32s: Now, probability analysis gives us a projection of future price.
501.04s: So in this case, it's taking the volatility of the underlying.
504.56s: So in this case, 77.36%.
507.48s: And then it's projecting out in this case a cone.
510.56s: So this really a parabola.
512.20s: And it's using again a one standard deviation range.
515.16s: Now you can change this to be from probability of touching,
518.68s: to be the probability of in the money.
520.72s: And then you'll notice that our little crosshair
523.16s: has two numbers on it.
525.56s: So it's showing you the probability above and below
528.20s: whatever number you're hanging on.
530.20s: So what that means is on the y-axis is the price of the underlying
535.24s: and the x-axis is the date.
538.16s: So this is date zero today.
540.28s: And then this is 10 days away, 20 days, 30 days,
542.76s: 40 days, 50 days, so on and so forth.
545.24s: And then this is showing you the price of the underlying.
547.96s: This is obviously showing you essentially
549.68s: where the current spot price is.
552.12s: So what I like to use again is the probability of a touch
555.16s: because that's typically what I'm managing by.
557.96s: And you can see what the probability is
560.84s: of your position being touched at different price levels.
564.76s: So for example, you can tell right out of the gate
568.20s: for this 20802 and this 47, again, this cone
573.00s: is a one probability.
574.16s: So that'll be about a 16% probability of a touch.
577.40s: And if I change this from a one standard deviation to two,
581.20s: you'll notice that it now represents
583.12s: like a two and change percent probability.
585.36s: So these are just using standard deviations
588.12s: for the probability calculation.
591.16s: What's really useful here is you can use the options chain
594.92s: for this information, but it's also really simple
596.92s: to just look it in here.
597.84s: So for example, if I have this trade down here,
601.24s: that just happens to be short 34 puts.
603.96s: And I'm like, okay, what's the probability of us hitting 34
607.44s: by six September?
608.88s: I can look at six September.
611.24s: I can find the date.
612.24s: Again, you can zoom it in as much as you want.
614.56s: And then I can say, what's the probability of us hitting 34?
617.92s: The probability of hitting 34 is like 69.99% probability.
624.00s: So now I know that for whatever reason
627.40s: I'm looking for that, whether I'm trying to calculate
629.40s: expected return or zone and so forth.
632.00s: So super, super useful tool.
634.68s: And then again, you can adjust the volatility
636.76s: for the parameters down here if you would like.
639.40s: I use both of these literally all the time.
642.16s: Now economic data is actually another really
644.64s: underutilized tab where you can take a look
647.44s: at different broad economic indicators
650.40s: and it literally plots them for you.
651.96s: You can pick the format that you want.
654.40s: You can change the ranges.
655.84s: This is essentially coming from Fred,
658.04s: which is the Federal Reserve economic data.
660.64s: There's a ton of great details in here.
662.32s: So the, yeah, I mean, tons and tons
666.28s: of different things you can tinker with in here.
668.44s: Think back is essentially the on-demand feature,
671.40s: but it's just in the normal portal, right?
673.32s: So you can pick a stock that you want to look at.
675.64s: You could pick the date you want to go back into.
678.00s: And then you can take a look at the options chain,
679.80s: the chart at that time, all those kinds of details.
682.92s: And then the last couple of things, fundamentals,
685.12s: exactly what it sounds like.
686.88s: You can see what different rating agencies
689.40s: feel about the underlying.
690.88s: The cool part about it is you can download their reports
694.00s: where you can see, you know,
695.72s: when new reports are launched,
697.24s: so you can see actually what they're saying.
699.60s: You can just get a quick update about the parameters,
703.44s: or I'm sorry, the like background
704.88s: of the company, not the parameters.
706.64s: And then you can go to the website for the company here.
710.08s: You can look at some of standard valuation metrics,
712.76s: so annual or quarterly.
715.08s: And this is another really cool tool
718.20s: because I feel like a lot of people
720.16s: don't fully utilize it.
722.32s: Because one of the other things I think a lot of people
724.68s: aren't familiar with is if you scroll down
727.08s: for some companies, not all,
729.12s: it'll give you a lot of details about the valuation of it.
732.84s: And then it'll actually even give you a breakdown,
735.60s: essentially of the company's market cap
738.56s: or the estimated value.
740.44s: So you can click into it and then get trends
743.28s: within that specific segment.
745.88s: So right now looking at Boeing,
747.64s: we can look at the global services arm,
750.24s: which obviously comprises 43.9% of the market cap
754.72s: and you can see what the revenue looks like in there,
757.68s: what they're actually selling, what the competitors are.
760.36s: The detail in here is actually like really, really good, I think.
764.04s: So there's that context for you.
766.92s: And then the last thing I use all the time is for earnings.
770.04s: So this gives me context about the underlying price
774.84s: before and after the release.
776.80s: So you can see the release date is in the center.
779.28s: We can look at implied versus historical volatility,
781.80s: the pricing of the straddle,
783.08s: and then how the actual versus estimates
787.36s: line up with one another.
788.64s: Now this is kind of the last eight quarters together.
792.44s: You can zoom in a little bit more.
795.08s: So this gives you a little more granularity
797.48s: in terms of what time frames you're looking at.
799.80s: Then you can also compare them across different quarters.
803.60s: So this is comparing the IV, the HV, the straddle price,
808.28s: and then the stock price, again, pre-imposed release.
810.72s: So you can see down here,
811.64s: center shows earnings announced.
814.32s: And then it shows you five days before
815.96s: with all those parameters and then five days after you can zoom
819.04s: in a little bit if you need.
821.28s: It is again, just another really, really cool tool, I think.
825.56s: You can also change the specific quarters
828.88s: that you want to compare out of curiosity.
831.60s: So yeah, just another absolutely awesome tool
835.32s: in my opinion that I use all of the time.
839.08s: As always, if there's any questions,
840.32s: just let me know, be an outlier.
841.80s: I'll see you guys later.
