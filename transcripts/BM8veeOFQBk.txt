312.00s: you
314.00s: what's up outliers happy Friday
316.00s: welcome to the very first
318.00s: iteration
320.00s: of our new live stream
322.00s: the
324.00s: goal for this stream is to provide a little bit of a continuation of the beginner side accept the meat
328.00s: different
330.00s: differences
332.00s: not going to be quite as
334.00s: structured in terms of
336.00s: topic over time
338.00s: i'm going to
340.00s: purposefully bounce around a little bit
342.00s: and
344.00s: the primary reason for doing one of these is as a stop gap
348.00s: until we get into our next major series
350.00s: but i want to prioritize and make sure that we have time set aside
356.00s: to do
358.00s: beginner and
360.00s: beginner friendly stuff
362.00s: so as always let's see who's hanging out here on a Friday i see Reese Kirk Ocinano
368.00s: i see Lauren Shrej i see familiar names
372.00s: it's great to see everybody i hope you all had a really really awesome week
376.00s: past week was interesting
378.00s: from a market lens you can see that i've been looking at bitcoin a little bit
384.00s: from some of its behavior which i'm not going to say is
388.00s: confounded me but i definitely find it intriguing
392.00s: and across the broad market there's been a lot of really really interesting behavior
398.00s: but you can see that
402.00s: generally speaking we are slowly cruising
406.00s: towards all time highs
408.00s: this move here is really really important but notice
412.00s: what this move looks like in context let's zoom this in a little bit
416.00s: and notice this level here is the one that i was talking about we very
422.00s: specifically need to get above this obviously
426.00s: in order to post a new high but more importantly the way that we behave around this
430.00s: prior term high is important in terms of determining a differing trend
436.00s: which that's what this looks like at this point very weak so
440.00s: but still there this is a good example uh we were talking about this i want to say
444.40s: yesterday that i before where you can have instances where the equity
450.00s: sale volume on the days actually kind of high but still have an update
454.00s: and yesterday's literally a perfect example or yesterday today is a perfect example
460.00s: of how that can be the case sometimes little quirky but that's how she goes
466.40s: what i want to do is start with a quiz
472.00s: and this is a two question quiz because normally when i do more questions i realize
477.60s: that we don't then have enough time to actually talk about the nuances and concepts
483.20s: so here's our first quiz question
488.00s: if the trader wants more vague exposure
493.20s: should they go out 30 days to expiration a 90 days to expiration b 180 days to expiration c
506.56s: what do you guys think recessy
513.20s: what are the guesses do we have you could just throw the corresponding letter
518.64s: in the chat tcm says c
531.20s: brain says b no one says c
537.84s: from of the crops says a this is a standard test there's no talking to the test
544.16s: meaning you can't reason with the test you got to pick the best answer that you can find
549.92s: so that means there is in situation dependent it is just pick the best general answer
555.76s: that's by design this way tcm says d that's the best answer so far
562.80s: Lauren says a figured this is actually exactly what i was expecting to see
569.68s: which is a shotgun blast
575.60s: regi says does it matter buying versus selling no
580.08s: because whether or not you buy yourself you'll have more vague exposure in the same spot
586.72s: Kurt goes with a
590.24s: all right this is actually this is actually kind of fun you guys are more split than i thought
594.96s: all right let me count d one two three four for c
603.20s: one for b four for a so we're literally about tied between c and a that's fun that's kind of
615.44s: what i expected to see brain says it depends on val term structure doesn't it not really
622.00s: know technically now right now we have four for a four for c one
635.60s: hundred my pen stop one for b one for d
643.20s: let's take a look shall we
645.44s: notice i'm not giving you the answer yet i want you to see it for yourself and i will simply
656.56s: be a participant with you let's find a spot in here that we can do a thing
666.24s: this this looks good this looks like a good space main is good is any
670.80s: and let's do um so we looked at thirty nine d and then what was the last one i said one eighty
681.12s: something like that and then let's take a look at delta let's take a look at a strike
687.44s: we'll do two versions of this we'll do one based off of delta
691.20s: yeah this is fine we'll do a fifty delta because that's where we know x-transit value is the highest
703.60s: so we'll get a sense of what that is across
709.92s: you
718.40s: I'm going to move this
722.00s: and we will
726.64s: take peek will you spy just because we're in there
733.20s: so I said thirty i see a twenty eight day here
738.40s: and we'll just do a fifty delta call
741.76s: arvega on the fifty delta call
746.08s: is 0.755 on the 90
754.96s: this one 50 delta oh there's a 50 on the nose that's fun
760.72s: you don't really that's like the fucking 11 11 shit that's cool
765.60s: 1.308
770.00s: and then the 180 here
776.64s: 50 delta 1.83 right
785.60s: you heard it here first
790.40s: great a plot
800.72s: we don't need a plot delta
808.32s: what do we see
811.36s: what do you guys see
820.96s: where is Vega
825.76s: the highest
827.76s: the highest
841.84s: see 180
845.92s: 180 okay
848.40s: so then what answer does that give us
850.80s: see Vega is higher
859.84s: as you go further out or none
862.96s: that's just how it works
865.36s: the reason why I asked this question is because I expected a lot of people
871.20s: to get a little bit tripped up
875.12s: in terms of different ways that you can value this
880.32s: Kirk says Vega as a percent of premium would show different results let's take a look the good science experiment
888.48s: so now let's add premium
892.88s: because as you know Kirk this is actually one of my favorite lenses to use
897.12s: is to normalize off of premium
901.36s: and let's go we're out here at the 180 so let's take a look at these to star i'm going to call that
907.52s: 2077
911.76s: and then we'll go back into the 90s those are
918.00s: 1828
924.72s: 18
928.16s: fuck I keep hitting 2
934.00s: and then let's go to the 30 days
938.00s: that gives us
945.76s: now let's take a look at
948.16s: our new
951.52s: new lenses well
953.52s: so this will be
955.60s: Vega
956.64s: to premium as a percentage
960.16s: a good old VIP percentage
962.40s: and let's see what we see
969.84s: exactly what Kirk would expect to see
974.80s: which is good
976.00s: what this means is as you get closer in time
981.36s: you'll actually find this
985.36s: for pretty much all the Greeks this is how the majority of them behave with respect to time
990.32s: if you think of
993.84s: any sort of time series based view of options
1000.64s: and let's say that this is zero d to e let's say that this is 180
1005.92s: where is gamma
1008.80s: the highest relative to your premium
1012.88s: here it's higher there where is theta
1016.64s: highest relative to your premium
1020.08s: here where is Vega
1023.68s: highest your relative premium here
1027.44s: why is this
1029.68s: it's for a really really intuitive
1032.56s: reason
1033.84s: as you get closer in time options have to do a lot of stuff
1038.00s: they have to make a lot of decisions
1040.16s: and this is actually where the Greeks
1042.80s: become amplified
1044.40s: as you get closer
1045.76s: expiration
1047.36s: this is also why as you go further out in time
1051.36s: options behave more like stock replacement
1055.12s: now again
1056.96s: there's relative nuanced to all of this
1060.56s: which is exactly why I wanted to use this as an example
1064.72s: because when we talk about where is Vega the highest
1068.96s: Vega is always the highest
1071.28s: as you go this direction every single time no matter what
1074.32s: here it
1078.88s: yet
1081.84s: the way that volatility changes across the curve
1086.00s: is also very different
1088.08s: you can have instances where the total Vega impact can
1093.44s: absolutely and frequently does
1095.92s: favor the front
1098.24s: even though it has a lower Vega
1102.40s: its total volatility impact can most
1106.72s: certainly be pretty high
1109.92s: easy to easy for that to occur
1114.08s: the reason why these little tests and getting your brain used to
1118.64s: thinking of options this way
1121.12s: is the more you can frame stuff like this the easier you can make
1124.72s: good decisions
1125.84s: because you understand how the things behave
1129.68s: relative to your expectations because there was another comment
1132.80s: about whether or not we're in contango or backwardation
1136.48s: which funny enough that actually doesn't matter
1139.76s: because if we look at a term structure here
1146.56s: and we say that this instead is volatility
1151.52s: and let's say that this is 30 day and then 60 day
1154.40s: and let's say 30 day is here and 60 days here
1158.08s: so deer worn contango with respect to where we would
1162.72s: anticipate valbean
1165.04s: this variance doesn't inherently mean that Vega is higher here
1170.16s: actually more frequently than not it won't be higher here
1173.84s: more often than not Vega as a number will still be higher here
1178.24s: not always but very frequently will be so
1181.92s: and that is very simply to do with one factor
1187.28s: these have way less
1190.72s: I'm premium
1193.04s: these still have more time value
1197.04s: so even though all might be slightly higher here than here
1201.60s: it doesn't inherently mean that Vega will be higher here
1204.96s: because it's working with less overall extrinsic value
1209.12s: and extrinsic value is where your volatility lives
1214.56s: it's not intrinsic intrinsic is simply how far an option is in the money
1218.08s: it's in your extrinsic value and you have less of that here compared to here
1222.88s: so it was a good thought process for people to go through for sure
1226.64s: but that's why whether or not you're in contango or backwardation
1231.12s: actually I'm sorry, backwardation here
1233.84s: I think I said contangable force sorry
1235.60s: it doesn't matter which of those circumstances that you're in
1244.08s: now we have one more question
1250.24s: what does skew
1253.84s: tell us how expensive all is
1257.76s: how volatility is priced relative to different
1260.32s: explorations, volatility levels compared to cross strikes
1264.96s: A, B, or C
1273.68s: what do you guys think?
1277.76s: I just crushed a water-loo tropical fruit super good
1281.92s: and now I'm moving on to a mango orange spindrift
1286.40s: which these are a fave?
1289.76s: no guesses so far or all you guys cheat and right now?
1292.96s: I know the latency ain't that bad
1296.48s: B, C, C, C
1303.68s: C, C, C, C, B,
1312.32s: B and C were a toss-up that's fair
1315.04s: this realistically
1318.96s: is just a no-manclature thing
1321.84s: it doesn't really matter
1323.52s: so this one I want to talk about it just because it opens up an important conversation of volatility
1330.08s: but if I was like working with somebody
1334.16s: and they were like yeah the skew is this and I knew that they were talking about something else
1338.56s: I wouldn't give a fuck it doesn't it doesn't matter this
1341.68s: there are some things you will find I am extremely
1345.60s: pedantic about and more often than not it genuinely is for a reason
1349.84s: sometimes it's not admittedly so but more often than not it's for a reason
1353.52s: when I'm like very specific about terminology
1356.40s: but on something like this it really doesn't matter
1359.68s: because when you're talking to somebody if they understand the terms
1362.88s: they will understand the context and what you're inferring
1367.92s: let's take a look at two things
1371.52s: actually this would be a little more fun to plot
1374.48s: let me own second
1377.76s: I think this would be more fun to do in here
1383.52s: I'm going to move this again
1385.92s: and let's create a slightly different plot
1390.88s: I'm going to do a 25 delta 50 delta 75 delta
1395.60s: and then I'm going to do
1402.88s: 10 days 30 days
1407.20s: 60 days
1409.36s: actually now we'll do 10 30
1411.44s: fuck I don't want the gaps to be that big
1414.40s: I'll just do 30 again 30, 60, 90 that's good
1418.64s: I don't want to skew it too much because of the raw size of the gaps
1422.64s: 30, 60, 90
1424.72s: 120 that's good
1433.68s: what I'm going to do now is take a look at the implied volatility
1438.32s: let's start with the 30 days to expiration which we're in
1444.64s: and we'll do the out of the money
1448.56s: options are only so we'll do 25 delta puts 50 delta calls 25 delta calls
1461.52s: so the 25 delta puts ball here is 25.9
1469.20s: 50 delta 48.3
1473.76s: 25 delta call
1482.16s: 24.5
1487.60s: and I'm just going to do 30, 60, 90 versus the 120 as well
1491.60s: I think you guys will see it with the 33 by 3
1496.64s: 60 days
1498.24s: 25 delta puts
1500.40s: 16.97
1505.20s: 50 delta call
1508.00s: 47.8
1512.16s: 25 delta
1515.76s: 23.35
1518.56s: and more for the 90s
1524.88s: now I have to add strikes yeah
1530.32s: 25 delta
1533.52s: fuck nice fucked up
1535.92s: 27
1538.08s: 2772 percent
1541.52s: 50 delta
1544.32s: 47.4 percent
1547.20s: last one 25 out of the monies
1551.84s: puts us here
1554.64s: we get 23.4
1559.68s: we have our data
1562.40s: now let's do an experiment
1572.40s: much like really curious how this is going to attempt to chart it
1577.52s: yeah I figured that it might
1580.24s: I figured that it might struggle a little bit
1589.84s: 2194
1595.04s: there you go
1597.76s: guess what you're looking at here
1601.68s: what is this x?
1603.68s: 24 and 27 we don't want that to supply
1606.32s: so
1616.32s: like this
1635.68s: This is a false surface.
1640.68s: Exactly what you're looking at.
1642.68s: When I pull this up and think or swim,
1644.68s: it is the exact same thing that you're looking at.
1647.68s: We have two different things that we can measure.
1650.68s: Three, technically.
1652.68s: We can measure volatility across terms.
1655.68s: We can measure volatility across strikes.
1660.68s: And we can measure volatility across strikes and terms.
1664.68s: When we're looking at skew, skew again,
1672.68s: pedantically, but skew technically is within a term.
1677.68s: So what that looks like in this scenario is this specific,
1685.68s: let's say 90 delta or 90 DTE.
1691.68s: I wish you could highlight it.
1692.68s: That would be nice if you hovered over and you can highlight it.
1696.68s: But it doesn't let you.
1698.68s: Let me see.
1699.68s: I'm going to change the scale just a little bit that may be easier to see.
1710.68s: Yeah, okay.
1711.68s: That's fine.
1716.68s: Just a yellow kind of fucking disappears on you.
1719.68s: That's way better.
1722.68s: This gives you relative volatility in a couple different ways.
1727.68s: It gives you relative volatility across the strikes within an expiration across the strikes in different
1735.68s: different expiration and then across the expiration themselves.
1739.68s: When we're referring to skew, that's like looking at the individual lines.
1745.68s: The 30 DTE, the 60 or the 90, and just looking at how the ball changes across the curve of a single term.
1755.68s: And when we're talking about across terms, that's term structure,
1762.68s: which probably tells you a little bit of like mental association.
1772.68s: Term structure is across expiration.
1777.68s: More importantly, again, than the words, the words genuinely don't matter that much.
1782.68s: But realistically, a lot of times you'll actually hear traders just refer to it as a skew.
1786.68s: And then you just know in the context of the conversation if it's within a term or cross terms.
1794.68s: But you can learn a lot from something like skew.
1799.68s: Let's take a look at spy and let's take a look at ball.
1804.68s: I'm going to look at out of the money.
1806.68s: The reason why we just look at out of the money is because we don't really care about the in the money options.
1813.68s: There are balls are going to be slightly, I was trying to think of a different word, but skewed.
1820.68s: So we use the out of the money's one word looking at stuff like this.
1825.68s: This is a useful visual.
1827.68s: Now the downside with the visual like this is you can kind of get lost.
1832.68s: And unfortunately, think or swim doesn't like you scale this that well, which is kind of annoying.
1838.68s: Being honest with you, I really would like it if you could like limit strikes and stuff.
1843.68s: That would be a great version of this tool so that you can explore stuff because right now what's happening is the 19Ds.
1851.68s: These insanely far out of the money puts, which are always going to have massively high vol are just crushing any relative difference that you can see between these.
1862.68s: So if I get rid of that, you'll see these come more alive and you'll get a little more context.
1869.68s: That's also why realistically speaking I use tools.
1872.68s: I don't have it pulled up right now, but there's a few of them.
1876.68s: I use and again, full disclosure, I'm going to fill it for I think all the ones I'm going to show you.
1881.68s: They're not paying for me to promote any of this.
1885.68s: I literally just use them.
1887.68s: So this one is good.
1889.68s: I like I like this one because it lets you view,
1894.68s: you've all in a bunch of different ways.
1898.68s: So you can look at the smile, which is just a term that we use to describe skew.
1906.68s: More often than not, vol will have a smile, a smirk, and that's just the relationship that you see here.
1918.68s: That's all.
1921.68s: So this is one way that you can visualize it really in a bunch of different manners.
1926.68s: They even have a vol surface, which I actually think is pretty cool that they do this to turn it into 3D.
1932.68s: The reason I like this is again because you can get rid of the strikes that you don't want to see.
1937.68s: So you can focus on the strikes that matter to you.
1940.68s: So let's say that you're doing like 20% up and down from spot price.
1945.68s: You can meaningfully drag these in so that you can see what's more relevant to what you're attempting to trade.
1954.68s: And let's say that you're not interested going 700 days out.
1958.68s: Let's say that you want to know what the structure looks like in a much near term window.
1962.68s: Maybe like within 100 days.
1965.68s: It's just because it's what what this picked up.
1968.68s: You can literally get a sense of where vol is cheap, which is clearly right here.
1975.68s: And then you can get a clear sense of where vol is very elevated.
1981.68s: And this is again, just a way to visualize volatility.
1986.68s: Another tool that I told you guys I just started working a little more closely with Chris from Moon Tower.
1992.68s: And I'm trying to actually help him a little bit with the tool.
1999.68s: His tool is really cool, but I would be absolutely shocked if it doesn't have spy.
2008.68s: Let's see.
2013.68s: Yeah, I was going to say that just doesn't make sense.
2018.68s: So his tool is again, giving you a different way to visualize that very same thing.
2025.68s: This is just looking at the difference and changes in vol.
2029.68s: So in this case, this is showing you a ratio between delta's and time.
2034.68s: And then you can just look at how vol actually changed in terms of clicks, meaning like individual increments.
2043.68s: Then you can visualize the term structure using this is using 50 delta options.
2049.68s: And then it's just showing you the spread between.
2054.68s: That expiration and whatever other expiration you're looking at.
2058.68s: So in this case, we're looking at the 10 D's to the 15 D's.
2063.68s: And we're comparing the 50 delta option in 10 D's to 15 D's.
2068.68s: And again, to give you an intuitive understanding.
2071.68s: This is giving you 11.7.
2074.68s: So let's just take a quick look together.
2077.68s: Let's go to I have had eight concussions.
2081.68s: So I already forgot the expiration's 10 D's and 15 D's.
2086.68s: There's 15 there's 10.
2089.68s: Let's go to something close to a 50 delta.
2092.68s: That's going to give you like 10 point four.
2096.68s: So we'll log that down.
2100.68s: 10 point four percent.
2104.68s: And then let's go out to the 15.
2107.68s: Again, the 50 delta's in here.
2110.68s: It's like 11.5.
2112.68s: We'll call it.
2117.68s: So now the question is well, what oh shit.
2120.68s: The question is well, what is 11.7.
2123.68s: That's literally just the difference between these as a percentage.
2128.68s: It's giving you a sense of how different the skew is.
2132.68s: So when we see this, we can immediately tell that the back is at a premium to the front,
2141.68s: just standard.
2142.68s: We would expect to see that.
2144.68s: But then something like this tool you would use to spot differences and gaps and
2149.68s: shit like that.
2151.68s: You can also visualize the skew in different timeframes for different days to expiration options.
2159.68s: So you can change like the look back period.
2161.68s: This one actually really like this is probably one of the coolest parts of this by far, I think,
2166.68s: is the realized versus risk premium.
2169.68s: So anyways, this is another way you can visualize it and then another tool that does this is.
2177.68s: O rats.
2178.68s: I'll show you theirs.
2180.68s: Here's what I'm doing.
2182.68s: I'm just literally showing you all different ways that you can visualize wall, which is a really,
2187.68s: really, really big part of what you do when you're trading options, whether you fully realize it or not.
2197.68s: So in this case, you can plot it a couple different ways.
2202.68s: I normally would just look inside the options chain for a little bit easier.
2206.68s: So in this case, it's literally again just plotting the walls.
2211.68s: And it's giving you the walls.
2213.68s: This is a wall surface.
2214.68s: It's just a slightly different format because we have our walls here.
2220.68s: And then we have our dates as the x-axis.
2224.68s: So now you can go through here and again, play the game of look for stuff that you're interested in.
2231.68s: The reason why all this wall stuff is really, really important is because with respect to trading and when you become a,
2239.68s: just more savvy options trader, whether or not you choose to like really focus on wall somebody that obviously really focuses on wall that you guys have heard a lot is you and some clear he clearly the focus is on wall full full stop.
2255.68s: But that's not the only way to trade and I include wall.
2261.68s: Hevely as part of what I do, but it's not the only thing I do.
2264.68s: The reason for that is you're never going to get astronomically good returns with wall and that's trading short wall long wall you have a better chance at.
2274.68s: So in this context, I'm specifically revering to short wall, which is just trading different discrepancies across the term structure.
2281.68s: We'll really, I should say across the surface.
2285.68s: And a good example of what that can look like is if you paper trade this stuff for a while again, even if you just trade paper trade earnings for a quarter and get a sense of how those tend to behave.
2298.68s: You'll get a pretty good idea of what longer term performance might look like for you with short wall.
2306.68s: And if I were to just take a like put a random number on it and again take this with a grain of salt, but it's likely generally accurate.
2316.68s: I would say anywhere from like 18 to 35 ish percent per year.
2323.68s: I think it's very reasonable for a short wall book.
2328.68s: Now the downside to that is that you miss a lot of the upside years.
2333.68s: Like I've already told you guys this year I'm on track for my third best year and my last.
2340.68s: A are update that I shared with you guys the portfolio is up 78.9% 85 technically 78.85% on the year.
2350.68s: Like that's not going to happen with short wall. You're just not going to get there.
2355.68s: Part of that comes down to what do you like to do and how effective are you at doing whatever the specific thing is that you're doing.
2364.68s: One of the most common misunderstandings with trading short wall is like just going out on the market, finding stuff with high implied volatility percentile and selling wall.
2373.68s: That is not good.
2375.68s: I'll repeat that that is not good.
2379.68s: And I think that confuses a lot of tasty traders unfortunately.
2383.68s: A lot of tasty traders are used to that approach.
2387.68s: The reason why that's not a good approach is that a lot of times you're actually going to sell wall that's not price well.
2396.68s: And you are taking asymmetric risk.
2400.68s: You have to pay attention to that asymmetric risk.
2403.68s: When you're selling wall, you have a defined profit.
2406.68s: And if you're doing it in a peer sense, you have undefined risk.
2410.68s: If you do it with defined risk, now you're really really diminishing how much money you can make in total by a lot, not even like a little by a lot, a whole lot.
2420.68s: A good example of that is in like the zero DTE stuff that I do.
2425.68s: And naked versus not it literally annualizes eight to 12% difference.
2431.68s: It's massive.
2433.68s: And that's because if you want to sell wall, but you also want to protect yourself, which, again, it's a logical thought.
2440.68s: But who wouldn't do that?
2443.68s: You just sell wall and protect yourself and make a bunch of money doing it.
2448.68s: Who the fuck wouldn't do that?
2450.68s: That's the point.
2452.68s: And not quite built that way.
2454.68s: And it's because markets are generally efficient.
2457.68s: So anyways, these are just a few different ways to view wall.
2462.68s: Now let's tie these to tradable concepts.
2465.68s: That's mostly what I'm interested with respect to the quiz.
2468.68s: And then I want to talk a little bit about the rest of the topic for the day, which is like scanning for ideas, which, again, this is, well, the second part is part of that.
2480.68s: This is fundamental knowledge that you have to know.
2484.68s: You have to know this because if you're trading just about anything, you want to understand the risk that you're taking in how what you're trading behaves.
2498.68s: Without that, you find yourself in this circumstance where you put something on and shit starts moving and you don't know why or you're confused.
2506.68s: And it doesn't make sense.
2508.68s: This is the very stereotypical, if you buy a call, the option goes in your direction and you lose money.
2514.68s: That's, again, typically attributable to some combination of wall and theta.
2520.68s: But that can confuse people because you can say to yourself, well, shit.
2524.68s: It literally did the direction thing that I wanted it to do.
2527.68s: Why did I get fucked up?
2529.68s: Which leads to a couple very key takeaways.
2533.68s: The first one, if I'm putting on an option, trade, long or short, and I want to increase my overall volatility exposure.
2545.68s: There's two important things.
2547.68s: There's Vega, which is how sensitive our position is to evolve, but then there's also the term and how much the term,
2554.68s: the term, the term, that's a form of change.
2557.68s: A great example of that is here.
2560.68s: If we take a look at how evolve has changed across these different terms, it looks very different.
2567.68s: If we look at the 7-day Vault, for example, it went from 24 down to 9, and it did that over a few days.
2577.68s: move 30 day ball went from 22 to 15 and 60 day
2586.02s: ball went from 20 to 15.7.
2594.76s: What this is telling you is you absolutely are
2601.30s: finding yourself responding differently your
2605.04s: position to how your ball is behaving.
2608.98s: Blackbom is says $200 credit spread with
2611.80s: 40 delta is equal to a hold on I'm
2615.28s: fucking already lost.
2617.24s: A $200 credit spread with 40 delta with
2622.56s: 40 delta what wings is equal to a $50
2626.80s: spread.
2628.56s: Or delta 10.
2631.60s: Sorry I'm not totally following.
2636.60s: But what I can guarantee you is that last statement
2639.76s: that you're making is wrong which is reduced
2643.00s: risk reduced significantly without giving up any
2645.48s: profit that's not a scenario.
2647.68s: What you might mean is that you're not giving up a lot
2650.92s: of profit and unfortunately you're probably
2653.60s: giving up more than you think.
2655.44s: But there is no scenario where you're not going to
2658.20s: give up any profit.
2659.84s: If you're doing any sort of spread you are immediately
2662.36s: giving up profit period and it's not just profit in
2666.92s: the credit you receive which also confuses traders a lot.
2671.56s: It's also through where you get your fills especially
2675.16s: if you're not lagging in even if you are lagging in
2678.00s: you're now transacting two times more and that's
2681.44s: if you're only transacting on entries and then
2685.08s: going to expiration.
2690.00s: Black mom says I mean 200 equals 50 by four.
2694.68s: Can you explain that concept?
2697.40s: Sorry, do you mean $200 wide of a credit spread
2702.96s: versus $50 wide in doing four of those?
2708.52s: Because the delta part confused me.
2713.48s: I think instead of selling four 10 delta
2717.08s: or $50 each versus $140 delta for $200.
2722.60s: Now I'm super confused because that's
2729.84s: y'all got my fucking head in a blender now.
2733.60s: If yeah, Black mom if you could.
2736.48s: Yeah, no one says where is a great question.
2738.96s: I'm trying to figure it out too.
2741.12s: Black mom if you could just give like an example of the
2743.40s: spreads that you're comparing that would.
2749.80s: Because Kirk says a 10 delta put could be 50
2756.84s: sell four that's 200.
2760.20s: Yeah, that's it's not a credit spread.
2762.64s: Are you mean buying buying to 10 delta?
2768.08s: He's talking naked, not spreads.
2771.60s: Oh, Jesus Christ.
2774.00s: That's like a massive, the massively important piece
2779.20s: of that statement.
2780.28s: Kirk shout out to you.
2781.96s: I don't know how the fuck you're able to decipher that
2784.84s: but shout out to you.
2785.96s: That's like that we'll call you the trade whisperer.
2789.00s: It's actually funny.
2790.60s: I was talking with a extremely seasoned option
2794.44s: straighter this week, just a friend of mine.
2797.24s: And he's on the institutional side.
2799.36s: He has spent very, very little time on the retail side.
2802.88s: And I was talking to him about some different stuff.
2805.04s: And I had brought up the wheel and how the wheel is
2807.48s: like really, really common for retail traders.
2810.32s: He's been trading options for 35 years.
2813.28s: Maybe I think it's more like 38, but well over how long
2816.88s: I've been alive.
2818.36s: And he literally, I was just like I brought up the wheel.
2821.76s: He literally was just like what the fuck's the wheel?
2825.36s: I thought that that was the funniest thing on earth
2827.40s: because it just shows how different we're talking here.
2830.96s: Like the difference between what retail traders
2832.92s: are doing, thinking and looking at versus institutions.
2836.00s: I thought that that was super, super funny.
2840.60s: All right.
2841.76s: Black Mama says instead of selling SPX, zero DTE,
2847.00s: 6850, 6860 credit spread, 40 delta.
2852.48s: Okay.
2854.84s: So we are talking spreads.
2863.52s: Yeah, I literally, I thought the same thing you guys did.
2866.28s: I was just chocalling.
2867.28s: It didn't surprise me in the least, but I thought it was so funny.
2870.52s: He literally was just like, what the fuck is that?
2872.32s: And I was like, yeah dude, that's what I'm
2876.68s: fucking working with here is I am trying to bridge that gap,
2880.36s: which is difficult to say the least,
2883.32s: especially for like the retail side.
2885.80s: Obviously, he, I explained it to him.
2887.92s: It was actually hilarious.
2889.20s: His response when I explained it to him is just like,
2892.20s: people think that's a strategy, which is hilarious.
2895.76s: But yeah.
2898.00s: Okay.
2898.84s: So Black Mama says why won't a trader sell 6880,
2904.12s: 6890 for $50 wide,
2909.48s: 10 delta, 10% probability,
2916.16s: 6850.
2918.92s: Let's take a quick look in SPX just so that I can try to
2924.48s: visualize what you're talking about.
2926.96s: In a nutshell, what I can tell you,
2929.04s: this is going to be a factor is in terms of how much money
2931.92s: you're making.
2932.84s: That's pretty much it.
2939.48s: Let's do, we can't do zero DTEs because they're none of
2944.00s: them here.
2946.00s: Black Mama says please explain the difference to an
2948.48s: institutional trader, please.
2950.76s: Yeah.
2954.80s: Okay, Black Mama says just an example.
2956.60s: Don't have the chain.
2957.28s: Okay, that's super helpful.
2958.48s: Thank you.
2959.64s: Okay, so I think I'm following better now.
2962.56s: What effectively I'm seeing is,
2968.64s: I understand now.
2970.16s: Well, you're taking way more risk.
2972.52s: That's why if you put on one of the
2978.08s: 6850, 6860, so a $10 wide spread,
2981.76s: I mean, we could use the three days for this.
2983.32s: This will be easy enough.
2985.08s: And you said a 40 delta, you pick your,
2988.68s: pick your delta.
2989.88s: So here's your vertical spread,
2991.48s: your $10 wide and you're collecting $275.
2996.40s: So 10 points wide means you're risking $7.25.
3002.64s: That's your total risk on this trade.
3005.20s: If you do that other scenario at the 10 delta,
3008.40s: so the 6805 to the 6875,
3012.24s: you're risking $10, but you're making 60 cents.
3018.44s: So now your risk is up to $9.40.
3022.00s: That's for a one lot.
3023.72s: Your scenario is saying, why wouldn't we do
3026.28s: four of those to get the same amount of money?
3029.72s: Now your total risk is $9.40 times four,
3036.80s: compared to the total risk in this one,
3040.08s: which is seven, seven in change.
3045.08s: That's the difference.
3046.20s: It's a completely different amount of risk
3048.80s: that you're taking.
3052.04s: Black Mama says agreed,
3053.40s: but where comes the probability?
3058.32s: You mean in terms of what?
3060.64s: The, what we would expect is this one out here
3064.16s: that's super far out of the money is to win a whole bunch.
3067.48s: This is the very, very standard,
3069.48s: super high win rate strategy,
3071.88s: but you just need one losing trade
3076.20s: and then you're wipe out how many wins, right?
3081.20s: So let's just do the math on that.
3083.08s: We said that you're risking,
3085.00s: you're making 60 bucks,
3087.56s: but you're risking 940.
3091.92s: So what is it?
3092.56s: 6.4 times.
3094.00s: If you lose one, so you get rid of six,
3097.48s: that's the reason.
3099.24s: Now let's go back to a zero DTE in here,
3104.60s: and let's see what the,
3105.72s: off fuck the Delta's are all shit.
3109.84s: Emma.
3114.04s: I don't know, I think.
3117.28s: I was hopeful that the Delta's would at least be okay.
3124.92s: Okay, these kind of look,
3127.08s: these kind of look normal.
3133.16s: That, oh.
3137.16s: All right, you had the Delta's rough fuck.
3140.04s: That ends up being the, the rub though.
3142.40s: That's the, the drawback to it is that is the quintessential
3147.08s: very high probability strategy,
3149.48s: but if you're wrong a few times,
3151.72s: you undo all the wins.
3154.68s: And that's where timing becomes important,
3158.72s: what that kind of stuff, if you have a good way,
3161.00s: the sample volatility and whatnot.
3164.76s: I wanna talk now a little bit about
3167.24s: for the last few minutes.
3168.72s: I wanna talk about the, actually,
3173.24s: I think we should just stay on vault at this point,
3175.92s: just because we're kind of fucking deep in here, boys.
3179.60s: We've been on this ball stuff for a hot minute.
3183.32s: So we'll just stick on volatility,
3188.68s: a little bit of a catfish,
3190.20s: but just go and work follows.
3193.96s: Like promises, I'm trying to build
3196.52s: a statistical thesis.
3199.28s: If we run this type daily,
3201.08s: even if you get caught in the wins,
3203.00s: should mitigate losses.
3206.44s: Yeah, it's the kind of thing that you would ultimately
3209.36s: have to test and see what you get.
3213.12s: The, my instinct is that it would underperform.
3217.72s: It would probably underperform pretty significantly.
3220.16s: Let me take a look really quick.
3221.44s: I have a couple,
3224.64s: I literally have a couple tools running right now
3228.36s: that I can ask it to do a super quick comparison for us.
3234.12s: Let's do,
3237.08s: first let's do like just 30 delta,
3241.88s: short, and this will be in SPX
3245.56s: from one day, these were launched until yesterday.
3248.76s: There's some other small details,
3255.48s: but it doesn't really matter for the comparison.
3258.48s: So this is looking at just a 30 delta, short triangle.
3264.04s: The compound annual growth rate from 2022,
3268.04s: may 16th, which is when daily's were launched
3270.28s: until now is,
3275.84s: oops.
3277.68s: Is 5.3%.
3285.52s: And on these, let's add wings.
3288.80s: Let's turn it into a vertical.
3299.48s: So now I'm doing 30 delta, short wings.
3304.36s: Or I'm sorry, 30 delta short for the base,
3307.80s: buying 20 delta wings.
3311.60s: Remember our compound annual growth rate for the first
3314.48s: was 5 in change, our compound annual growth rate now
3318.88s: goes to 2.6.
3322.28s: And let's take a look at the super far out of the money stuff.
3326.08s: So you said a 10 delta and doing 10 strikes,
3331.44s: 10 strikes, why?
3335.00s: Let's start there before we scale anything.
3344.20s: And let's see what this does to us.
3351.48s: 0.6% compound annual growth rate
3355.52s: with really bad drawdowns, really really bad drawdowns.
3360.64s: The, yeah, the drawdown in this is much worse than the,
3369.88s: there's on a relative basis.
3374.40s: And when I say relative, it's relative
3376.12s: to how much you're making.
3378.72s: Your best year with this from start was in 2023
3384.00s: with a 0.83% return.
3388.72s: So very little.
3394.84s: Black mom says delta 10 40, 1.5% by 80 are wins.
3401.32s: I ran a few tests this on Jesse AI.
3405.16s: Yeah, I mean, if you trust whatever that thing is,
3407.44s: I haven't used it.
3408.48s: So if you trust it, then paper trade it for a while
3411.60s: and see how it works.
3413.44s: But I know I absolutely trust my tool
3416.80s: because I built it.
3419.08s: Mom says, can you share the screen?
3420.64s: I cannot.
3421.80s: There's way too much specific details
3425.48s: in the, in the tool itself that I use.
3428.28s: So I wouldn't share it unfortunately.
3430.36s: I wouldn't want to give up some of the,
3434.48s: the secret sauce they're sorry.
3436.96s: But yeah, if you, if you think that the Jesse AI thing
3440.84s: whatever that is, if you think that's good
3443.08s: and you trust what you're seeing,
3445.44s: then in that scenario, what I would do
3448.68s: is just paper trade it a little bit
3450.68s: and see, see what you think, right?
3455.16s: And see if it logically makes sense.
3457.52s: But what we know is as a base approach,
3461.16s: it's gonna underperform meaningfully, very meaningfully.
3464.40s: And we would expect it to, right?
3467.00s: The reason why we would expect it to
3469.44s: is because no matter what,
3474.56s: if you have something that wins a lot,
3477.68s: there's a cost to that thing.
3480.08s: There's always gonna be a cost to that thing
3482.92s: because you're gonna win a lot.
3484.12s: That's the benefit.
3485.68s: There is no, have your cake eat it too.
3490.08s: If we think of,
3493.32s: black mom says I agree that returns are not good enough
3495.80s: to run it on Algo.
3498.00s: Oh, I mean, it would probably net lose.
3501.04s: The versions that I just looked at there,
3502.96s: I don't have any friction component to it.
3505.64s: So that's assuming you get good fills
3507.60s: and that's assuming you take it to expiration.
3510.20s: As soon as you start adding any of that in,
3512.80s: I mean, you're immediately looking pretty ugly to start
3516.28s: if even positive at all.
3519.68s: So yeah, I think with that kind of thing,
3522.28s: the best approach you could do is see
3524.48s: if maybe you can add some filters that logically
3526.92s: makes sense to yourself,
3528.52s: but you have to strike a really careful balance
3530.60s: because you don't wanna get rid of too many samples.
3532.68s: If you do that,
3533.52s: then you're effectively dismantling the strategy.
3536.60s: That's a really big part of trading
3539.00s: any sort of more processed based,
3541.80s: vol type strategies like that.
3546.04s: Very delicate balance doable,
3547.88s: but definitely delicate balance.
3554.20s: Any other questions on that?
3559.68s: That's a good conversation at least.
3562.08s: Hopefully, I think the biggest thing for you there
3565.04s: is paper trading at realistically
3567.72s: and getting a sense of how it behaves.
3576.52s: Mama says, a back test may be a fly.
3580.04s: Yeah, yeah, and that's a good way to do it, right?
3582.64s: Tinker with different setups and stuff.
3585.12s: The reality is, if you move that far out,
3589.52s: you're gonna really struggle to make any money.
3592.36s: One of the biggest pieces of advice
3594.68s: that I could give you is when you're testing,
3597.04s: try different spots on the curve.
3599.92s: There's just not a lot to make out there.
3603.96s: And your returns at that point
3607.56s: become really, really, really, really path dependent.
3610.40s: Do you happen to get a good path?
3614.04s: Or do you happen to get a bad path?
3617.16s: So what that means is the performance of the strategy
3619.76s: comes way less down to the skill of the operator
3623.32s: or how well built the strategy is.
3626.60s: And instead, we're effectively relying on luck,
3631.60s: how lucky are we in terms of how the market
3635.32s: happens to behave?
3637.40s: Generally speaking, slightly less advised,
3640.92s: I think then something that's a little bit more robust.
3646.28s: This is the way I think about it.
3652.00s: Sweet, us a super fun conversation on Wall.
3656.60s: If you guys have anything else related to Wall,
3659.00s: that you wanna explore and throw it in the chat,
3661.28s: still got a few minutes, and then if not, just let me know.
3665.32s: But yeah, the cool part specifically to keep in mind
3670.84s: when we're talking about Wall
3673.04s: is that it is a part of every single trade you do
3679.32s: no matter what always.
3681.72s: And there are ways that you can mitigate it
3684.32s: if you want to minimize how much Wall
3686.80s: or how much the other Greeks affect your option straight
3691.68s: or the inverse.
3692.80s: You can pick things that purposefully have more exposure
3697.24s: based on ultimately what you're attempting to target.
3703.12s: The piece I think that catches a lot of traders
3706.00s: is specifically not aligning any sort of view
3711.64s: of term volatility behavior against the term
3716.80s: that they're trading.
3718.24s: That I think is completely foregone
3723.48s: and leads to a lot of people being upset
3726.40s: because they don't know how much the term
3729.84s: that they're trading is compared to what position they have.
3738.88s: There's an easy way by the way to fix that.
3741.32s: You don't even have to pay for fancy tools.
3744.56s: One of the easiest ways to fix that is measure something
3751.20s: like the previous moves.
3753.40s: So if I look at the price performance
3756.12s: or even better, the average true range average daily range
3761.24s: any combination of any of these,
3762.96s: specifically the true range day range
3764.84s: would be better places to start.
3766.92s: If I look in there and I ball how much something is moving,
3771.92s: that'll give me an intuitive sense
3776.04s: for volatility relative to time.
3779.32s: And I'll give you an example of what this means.
3784.16s: If I look across a five day period,
3788.16s: the daily range is 0.6, true range would be better
3792.16s: because volatility does care about overnight.
3795.84s: For a five day period, true range is 0.7%
3802.72s: if we go all the way out to 20 days,
3806.68s: 20 days compared to five trading days, four times.
3811.04s: Notice how the range is not four times.
3815.64s: The difference, the variance in this duration.
3818.72s: That's telling you a lot that's giving you a relative
3823.72s: understanding of how volatile the five period is
3827.72s: against the 20 period.
3829.40s: Now again, this is historic.
3831.00s: This is backwards looking.
3832.92s: So you have to make a couple general assumptions
3836.24s: like is volatility in S&P priced pretty close to fair.
3841.52s: And the answer to that is yes.
3843.68s: So then you can make an inference
3845.96s: that implied vol would be priced a little heavier
3849.88s: in the front relative than for the backterms,
3854.00s: based on how much of these pieces.
3859.12s: And the broader factor
3866.28s: when you're trying to at least have an understanding
3869.68s: of the vol and how the vol is behaving
3872.72s: against the term that you're in
3874.88s: is just so that you don't find yourself buying
3877.72s: really expensive vols or unwinding stuff
3882.96s: that you don't specifically want that risk to at that time.
3887.96s: You can isolate things pretty well if you want.
3890.24s: Some ways you can isolate vol
3892.64s: and isolate other stuff realistically.
3894.64s: If you want to decrease what your overall vol risk is,
3899.20s: is you can go further out in time
3901.52s: and you can go further in or out of the money
3905.28s: because if we plot Vega across the term,
3911.28s: within a term, you'll see that vol will be pretty low
3917.20s: when we'll use the out of the money stuff.
3920.48s: It also depends on if there's put skewer, call skew.
3925.96s: If we go out 195 days, you'll see vol is high
3930.96s: when we're at the money,
3932.72s: it's because there's the most extra in the value.
3937.40s: Then if we go further out, we see vol tends to collapse.
3942.12s: Sometimes it'll start to peak up pretty well at the tails,
3945.56s: but the other thing to keep in mind
3946.72s: is that the vol relative to the premium here
3948.76s: is astronomically high.
3950.72s: Now, where this always starts to change in big indices
3955.56s: is on the put side.
3957.04s: The reason why the put side you'll see vol's going up
3960.36s: is that's why there's put skew so dominant in the indices
3965.20s: and it's because of hedging activity.
3966.84s: Lots of people are coming in there relatively
3968.80s: price and sensitive willing to overpay.
3972.04s: And there is absolutely folks that are willing to sell,
3976.16s: but they're going to take their pound of flesh
3978.24s: and it's for the same reasons we were talking about before.
3981.48s: Somebody is willing to sell this five delta option
3985.56s: at the 500 that's 195 days out.
3989.68s: The thing with this is that it is a really, really high probability,
3993.20s: but let's just take a look at what this thing will look like
3997.84s: in a few different scenarios.
4000.60s: Let's say that S&P goes down to 400.
4005.68s: On this one lot that the trader was trying to make 383 bucks,
4013.20s: they're going to lose 10 grand,
4014.96s: which you might say, well, that's it going all the way down to 400,
4018.44s: which is true.
4020.00s: It's a huge drop, but that's the point.
4023.04s: That's tail risk.
4024.24s: Is the probability of it happening is quite low,
4027.44s: but the compensation that you're getting for it is not good.
4032.44s: How goes?
4034.24s: Fin says, do you have rewards that best describe your love life
4040.48s: of an awesome wife?
4042.32s: So have awesome wife, bam, there you go.
4047.32s: Oston, on Ocez, do you use volatility skews
4050.44s: a decision criteria for short straddle
4052.24s: for strangle when trading earnings?
4054.44s: No, the skew itself doesn't really matter that much
4058.64s: around actually placing a systematic based ball strategy,
4066.20s: but the way that I trade earnings can be informed
4070.48s: by the skew.
4072.04s: There's a lot of information you can derive from skew.
4076.64s: That part, it takes a little while
4081.68s: to develop the intuitive understanding for it,
4085.16s: but when you do, it's actually really, really useful
4090.76s: in terms of finding some level of opportunity and stuff.
4095.56s: The downside, the broader downside at least,
4098.60s: is you really have to come up with
4103.60s: or have to develop a pretty well-defined methodology
4108.76s: for analyzing skew.
4110.88s: Otherwise, you can find yourself like chasing ghosts
4115.08s: pretty easily.
4116.00s: What I mean by that is just being in stuff
4118.96s: that doesn't work the way that you want,
4122.64s: they're very, very easy.
4127.80s: Black Promise says, it's unreal.
4130.12s: Is it even probable, spite of 400?
4132.76s: It's 25% down as options traders
4135.76s: would should we even think about this extreme?
4138.08s: Definitely.
4139.20s: You have to think about that extreme.
4141.32s: That kind of extreme is tail risk,
4145.52s: like that is tail risk in a nutshell.
4149.76s: One of the most important factors to keep in mind
4152.40s: is that the worst day for us as traders is ahead of us.
4158.00s: That means the biggest market collapse
4159.96s: is still probably ahead of us,
4162.80s: but we just haven't seen it yet.
4165.80s: There can be pretty profound moves
4168.92s: in terms of a size over short durations.
4172.80s: And that's what causes those kinds of positions strife.
4180.28s: So yeah, you absolutely want to consider
4183.08s: those kinds of moves even though they're improbable
4185.68s: if you're playing in the tails,
4187.44s: because that's the risk that you're fighting against.
4190.48s: You're not really fighting against much Greek risk
4192.72s: because you're so far out of the money.
4194.52s: You're not fighting against standard moves
4197.04s: because you're so far out of the money.
4199.40s: That risk in the tails is the risk
4203.60s: that a tail trader is managing.
4207.76s: And there's ways to manage the risk.
4210.08s: But again, the crux there is that most people,
4215.44s: when you trade for a while, you'll find
4218.04s: that how much you're making for that risk
4221.24s: isn't that attractive as a risk reward profile.
4225.20s: And it's just because, again,
4227.16s: let's just take a look at that one scenario.
4229.92s: That was, what was it?
4232.08s: It was three, let's just call it 325 bucks
4236.36s: and losing 10 grand.
4241.92s: So you can see really, really fast
4247.04s: how that becomes a not ideal risk reward profile.
4254.20s: You're really facing a significant multiple,
4260.48s: like 31 times.
4264.40s: So yeah, that's definitely the risk that you're looking at.
4269.48s: Kirk says like a Russell Iron Condor Tail Risk,
4272.52s: the unrealized P&L's harder mentally
4274.92s: than a quick binary event.
4276.92s: That definitely is, and I have a feeling
4280.28s: I know why you're using that example.
4282.32s: And it's accurate.
4284.20s: The other thing is just in terms of like an expectation, right?
4288.64s: Because if we're not at least acknowledging what might happen,
4293.64s: then if something even tangentially related does happen,
4298.24s: you kind of find yourself completely off guard
4300.48s: and not ready to make some sort of good decision
4304.32s: around that thing.
4305.16s: Which is just this scenario and say that the traders
4307.20s: account sizes 10,000 bucks.
4310.28s: And they think that the probability of them losing
4313.72s: their entire account on this one trade
4315.32s: to make through in 20 bucks is super low
4317.12s: and it is until that risk is realized.
4320.68s: I think the main issue for people there is like,
4324.52s: there's a lot of survivorship bias in the markets.
4328.36s: And especially people from like the game stop community,
4331.12s: that's a big one.
4332.04s: Because if you think about what the cat did ruin kitty,
4336.20s: it's magnificent.
4337.68s: There's a couple very key things that he did.
4340.16s: I think that ultimately enabled him one of them
4343.72s: is he was using a yellow account, right?
4345.76s: He was playing with a smaller amount of money
4347.56s: that he was comfortable risking,
4348.92s: wholeheartedly compared to a lot of,
4351.40s: compared to a lot of traders who aren't doing that.
4354.80s: And unfortunately, they're trading like real money.
4357.40s: And that's no good.
4359.72s: The other thing is there were a series
4367.56s: of very fortunate events that
4372.60s: coupled with his disposition led to the outcome,
4376.64s: which means that there's luck involved.
4378.76s: And it's not an insignificant amount of luck.
4382.24s: I've tried to quantify the luck aspect of my trading
4386.68s: and it's very difficult, very, very difficult
4388.80s: to actually isolate what I would attribute to luck,
4392.72s: which is again, like what happens to happen.
4395.64s: But it's noticeable.
4398.16s: Like there is a metric I can see it every single year
4401.40s: a call at the luck metric to just have an idea.
4404.80s: I know it's not accurate, but it gives me a sense of what it is.
4407.56s: And there's no shortage of luck
4412.88s: that went into what happened for him.
4415.32s: And if somebody is curious how that could be,
4419.16s: just think about how many thousands
4421.76s: and tens of thousands of other people tried to do
4426.44s: and replicate some of what he did.
4428.52s: And you've only heard of one person
4430.88s: that came out of that almost a fucking billionaire,
4434.88s: which is crazy.
4436.96s: It's really, really,
4440.08s: yeah, really, really improbable.
4443.44s: Oston Anos says there's interesting studies
4446.64s: about the overstatement of skill versus luck.
4449.64s: Yeah, definitely.
4451.00s: That, and it's important to acknowledge,
4453.00s: I think, even when you're trading.
4454.80s: And I mean, the reality is, most newer traders
4459.20s: completely fucked that up, like bar none,
4462.52s: they will absolutely over attribute stuff,
4466.64s: which is just a really, really common behavior.
4470.76s: It's manageable, but it's difficult to manage,
4474.48s: because especially as a newer trader,
4476.36s: you really don't know what you don't know.
4478.12s: So that becomes challenging to navigate through that.
4482.96s: But it's definitely navigable.
4486.28s: Yeah.
4488.72s: Awesome.
4490.20s: Time for me to hop off.
4491.52s: Great hanging out.
4492.60s: We will have our meme stock live stream tomorrow
4495.60s: to see what kind of high flying out there,
4497.88s: stuff that's super mobile.
4499.64s: So looking forward to seeing whoever comes out there
4503.24s: that feels like it.
4504.20s: And the next pro plus workshop is on the 15th.
4508.36s: I'll probably have one or two seats
4510.64s: that I'll open up to you guys,
4512.04s: so keep in eye out for that.
4514.88s: You know what I'm like?
4515.72s: See you guys later.
