0.52s: what's up outliers quick update on
2.92s: GameStop and chewy today as I already
5.76s: told you last week I'm going to start
7.28s: doing just one or two stocks during
8.96s: these because on the YouTube live
11.20s: sessions I'm doing every day at 5:00 P
12.68s: p.m. Pacific time you can join in for
14.88s: the broader market update stuff so
17.96s: taking a look at GameStop however this
20.36s: going to be a short video because
21.92s: there's not a ton going on here we're
23.76s: still trending very much sideways
26.00s: although we are seeing ever so slight
29.28s: positive drift like if I scale this up
31.20s: so that you can see it a little bit
32.28s: better there is some element of positive
35.12s: drift going on which is is good I want
36.88s: to be super clear about that because
39.16s: when I'm looking at something like
40.24s: GameStop what I don't want to see is
42.84s: really light volume like we've had and
45.12s: it's still Contracting day over day but
47.92s: having the stock drifting down during
50.20s: that time frame that becomes kind of
51.88s: ugly which that's not what we're seeing
54.08s: right now thankfully so yeah I think in
57.64s: terms of price action we're still in a
61.00s: bit of a holding pattern and then when I
62.96s: take a look over at chewy it's I'm sorry
66.88s: let's take a look at the options first
68.48s: taking a look at the gme options chain I
71.76s: was poking through out of curiosity just
73.80s: to see for things that were 10 Lots or
76.48s: higher if there was any kind of you know
78.28s: repeat stops if any bigger positions
80.92s: were going on and it's just a mixed bag
84.12s: this isn't anything that I would take
85.60s: away too heavily but for example I can
88.44s: see these 25s
90.48s: getting hit a little bit out in 23
93.36s: August but these are all
96.24s: still relatively small positions for you
99.16s: know what we've historically seen and
101.36s: what GameStop seems to start thriving on
103.80s: when we get movement so just not seeing
106.32s: a whole lot there as far as the options
109.56s: volume today very light
111.88s: 120,000 calls against 21,000 puts so big
115.96s: call skew on the volume but this isn't
118.12s: surprising cuz this looks like a ton of
120.00s: people that are just establishing
121.68s: positions for this week now this was one
123.80s: of my Curiosities when we were getting
125.40s: towards expiration of last week There's
127.56s: over 200,000 options that just you know
129.60s: came undone so in this case what I'm
132.16s: curious about is what's happening with
134.04s: these positions are we going to roll out
136.32s: to the next expiration to the next
138.28s: primary expiration are we going to let
139.76s: them expire and what ended up happening
142.04s: is we took them in to expiration and
144.28s: then it looks like broadly there's
146.56s: reestablishing going on so the 23 a had
150.28s: 12,000 contracts traded the um 25s had
155.52s: 12,400 the 23s were
158.28s: 12,800 the 24 said 7,900 so you can see
162.48s: where everybody's trying to play this
164.56s: it's all very near the money which is
167.68s: actually better than hyper centralizing
170.04s: in these super far out of the monies I'm
171.56s: glad to see more of the activity going
173.08s: on here I honestly just don't know if
175.76s: there's going to be enough movement for
177.56s: these folks to to make some money I I
180.28s: still am currently just holding shares
182.72s: with some short calls against the shares
185.48s: and it's because we're trending sideways
187.32s: so I'll start positioning using options
190.36s: when I start seeing movement and it's
193.96s: just not happening to a big degree in
196.28s: here just yet so it's a waiting game we
199.32s: need to wait and see what the next
200.60s: primary catalyst is going to be and
203.28s: there are definitely positionings
205.80s: positions being put on on the buy side
208.16s: so if you take a look at the volume for
209.52s: today
210.28s: 40% of it we're at the ask or above so
213.60s: people are buying and people are selling
215.28s: puts so there's definitely a general
217.32s: bullish disposition in terms of single
219.52s: options being put on but it's just
222.68s: generally light for what we tend to see
226.08s: right now there's 482,000 total call oi
229.68s: against 254,000 put oi and for this
234.24s: front expiration let's take a quick look
236.84s: at what's in here so far 63k against 16
240.56s: so very light this should expand after
242.92s: today after that new volume will be
245.24s: brought in from the transactions that we
247.24s: were just talking about but still pretty
250.04s: light is what it boils down to now
252.92s: pivoting over to chewy quickly because I
255.84s: do have something on in here and it's
258.36s: just because we started breaking out so
260.40s: you can see where my stop is I'm very
262.52s: very hesitant with earnings coming up
265.00s: I'm not expecting to hold this trade
266.32s: through earnings but it looks like
268.04s: there's some general bullish
270.28s: uh disposition coming into earnings that
272.80s: again whether or not it turns into
274.24s: anything big I don't know but there's a
276.24s: couple things I see going on here the
277.84s: first one is volume is actually
280.16s: expanding Beyond both a five and 20-day
285.20s: average volume which is important to me
288.64s: because this indicates increased
291.56s: participation so today it was 65% buy
294.96s: volume at 3.7 mil transacted and the
298.52s: 5day volume average is 4.3 million the
301.76s: 20-day volume average is 4.3 million so
304.76s: you can see that the buy volume alone
307.00s: today essentially almost paced total
310.84s: daily volume for both previous 20 days
313.16s: and the previous 5 days so it just tells
316.40s: me there's interest and it doesn't
318.04s: surprise me it's I'm not suggesting that
320.40s: that's interest driven from any crazy
323.20s: activity but I do see one coming up
325.60s: which is earnings I see earnings coming
327.92s: up and people like playing earnings
330.36s: so when I take a look at chewy options
334.00s: if we take a look at the volume for
336.24s: today it was 47,000 calls against 9700
341.44s: puts and open interest is
344.52s: 228k calls to 164k puts now for me I'm
349.08s: out here I'm in the my pass through
351.00s: account that's why there's no position
352.20s: marked but I'm out here 60 DTE as you
354.88s: guys know my standard way of buying
356.64s: options if you're unfamiliar with that
358.40s: I'll throw a link at the end end of the
359.92s: video so that you can go learn about
361.68s: buying options a little bit smarter so
363.80s: that not not just lighting money on fire
366.44s: every single expiration cycle but when I
369.36s: look at open interest for this week it's
372.44s: light 20,000 calls to 7800 puts in 30 H
377.12s: similar story six similar story 13 step
380.64s: similar story 20ep is 53 to 45 so
385.20s: there's a little bit more activity there
387.84s: it has earnings coming up on the 28th so
391.40s: normally I would expect to see the
393.52s: expiration cycle that contains earnings
395.60s: to be elevated like this right here
397.80s: notice how this front expiration is at
399.88s: 106% Vol then we have 118 this is very
404.00s: high relative to what's ahead of it and
406.12s: after it so that tells me something's
408.40s: going on there and in this case it's
410.16s: earnings pretty clear obviously because
412.60s: we also know that so this looks like a
416.20s: slightly more active play right now cuz
419.00s: I can also see some really big positions
421.00s: being built out so in this case you can
423.04s: see these 32s got hammered they
426.40s: absolutely got hammered and they were
429.48s: kind of spread out throughout the day so
431.28s: it looks like slightly different people
432.96s: potentially participating but like this
435.16s: right here I think this is the same
436.72s: person and we can see 496 on this one
440.12s: 495 here both at 75 cents those are not
443.36s: insignificant sized positions so this is
446.52s: in 30 Aug so you can see that there's
448.88s: some play happening here with the 32s
451.60s: between 30 and 23 a that's my guess is
453.88s: that there's some calendars potentially
456.04s: going on and again this doesn't surprise
457.96s: me with earnings so I'm not sure that
460.96s: these are direct you know just trying to
463.80s: play this to the upside long call style
466.04s: plays these look like it could be a
467.76s: little bit of both going on is what I'm
469.56s: seeing but there's just a little more
471.48s: activity going on here so right now
475.32s: position on and chewy position on and
477.12s: GameStop still technically but I'm
478.68s: trading chewy a little more
479.92s: directionally with options at the moment
481.44s: cuz it's showing some activity and then
483.80s: GameStops a little bit of a holding
485.20s: pattern and then later today we will
487.24s: dive into the broader market so as
489.16s: always if you need anything let me know
490.32s: be an outlier I'll see you guys later
