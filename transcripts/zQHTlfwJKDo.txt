340.00s: and game stop today.
343.00s: So it looks like the copy went all right.
347.00s: It's just going to take a hot minute for it to load
349.00s: because the document is pretty large.
352.00s: So we're going to take a couple of minutes
354.00s: and talk about where game stop is today,
358.00s: how things look,
359.00s: and then we'll continue down the path of this document here,
366.00s: which is analyzing the theories,
369.00s: planning the stream to be probably about half hour, something like that.
372.00s: And let's get right to it.
374.00s: Charlie, hope everybody is having an awesome weekend.
377.00s: And I still get the sense it feels like things are quiet
381.00s: from the ape community.
384.00s: It definitely feels like things have quieted down.
387.00s: I can kind of tell from a few different vectors,
390.00s: obviously the game stop videos that I put out.
392.00s: They always provide a proxy for how many people are actively engaging
397.00s: in the stock and then also,
399.00s: honestly, the number of emails that I get
401.00s: with people asked me to look at things,
403.00s: which is always actually very, very fun for me.
405.00s: But yeah, it seems pretty quiet.
408.00s: And it doesn't surprise me because I mean,
410.00s: if we think about a game stop has been essentially
413.00s: in a downtrend for two months now.
416.00s: So this downtrend started, I'll show you,
419.00s: after we had a bit of a peak here,
423.00s: we saw that in the beginning of January.
425.00s: Things were actually looking really good, really healthy.
428.00s: And then it's been slowly tailoring down from there.
432.00s: Now, I think the main question,
435.00s: at least in my mind, and probably everybody's mind,
438.00s: is where's the floor?
440.00s: Where does it actually seem like game stop is likely
445.00s: to gain some traction?
446.00s: And we can see that that's sort of happening here.
450.00s: I can get rid of this value.
453.00s: I'll keep that value area for now,
455.00s: because I want to talk about it actually briefly.
457.00s: We can give it to that one.
458.00s: And we still have this pretty well-defined
462.00s: descending channel.
464.00s: So as things sit today with game stop,
468.00s: the stock itself has been sitting on really,
472.00s: really quiet circumstances.
475.00s: There's really not a lot of news coming out.
477.00s: There's not a lot of buzz about what they're doing.
481.00s: There's not a broad overarching narrative
487.00s: that I'm seeing pushed out currently about game stop.
489.00s: There's definitely some glimpses that we've seen,
491.00s: and I've actually talked about this in a couple previous videos,
494.00s: with respect to Cohen.
497.00s: And he's alluding to things here and there,
501.00s: but nothing firm, obviously.
504.00s: And the broader market itself is also struggling right now.
510.00s: So if we take a look at the broad market,
513.00s: and I just look at total performance,
516.00s: let me tell you right now,
520.00s: IWM small caps is down 3.7% year to date.
527.00s: Spy is up just 0.81%,
530.00s: queues is down 1.2.
533.00s: So in Bitcoin, Ibit, just add a curiosity is down 12.8.
539.00s: Bons are up slightly, VIX is up slightly.
543.00s: The reason why I bother telling you these metrics
547.00s: is because it gives us a little bit of context around
551.00s: how the broader market is behaving right now,
553.00s: which is still part of what game stop fits in,
556.00s: which is the broader market.
560.00s: And I continue to see a lot of different theories and ideas
563.00s: around the price movement.
565.00s: It seems like people are still very, very interested
567.00s: in crack that code and I don't blame them.
569.00s: It's a very, very curious problem to try to analyze.
573.00s: But based on what I've seen so far,
575.00s: I still haven't seen any of these key theories panning out.
580.00s: And we've spent, again, this is the 16th episode
584.00s: of looking at the top theories themselves.
588.00s: And I approach the problem set from a really advantaged position.
594.00s: And that's simply because I'm not in here trying to prove my own theory.
598.00s: I don't really have one beyond the stuff
600.00s: that I've already talked to you all about with respect to price and volume.
604.00s: So the reason why I say it's an advantaged position
607.00s: is because it's always easy to look at other people's ideas and poke holes,
610.00s: but not give your own.
612.00s: And that's not really the aim of what I'm doing.
615.00s: I'm actively trying to see if I can identify any instances
620.00s: where it looks like there might be this broader underlying function
626.00s: that we may or may not be aware of or actively see.
630.00s: And in general, don't really see a lot of it to be completely honest with you.
636.00s: There are elements that I continue to see in terms of FTDs.
643.00s: I definitely think that we can point to some of these things
646.00s: naked shorting and identify things that are interacting with the system very clearly.
652.00s: That I think we all are aware of.
655.00s: The game is trying to identify how those things influence the system.
663.00s: And then is there a way to trade some sort of repetitive function
670.00s: that's an artifact of these other things that are impacting the system?
675.00s: And so far, I've not seen it.
678.00s: Now, I'm eager to continue going through the DD library with you all and see what pops up.
683.00s: What else might be in there?
685.00s: We have a lot to uncover still.
687.00s: But that's just kind of like where things sit as of now based on the,
691.00s: I mean, many hours that we've spent at this point looking at the stuff together.
696.00s: Now, to take a look at GameStop itself.
699.00s: A couple things really stuck out to me.
703.00s: The first thing that stuck out to me was the behavior in this value area here.
709.00s: Now, I originally would have anticipated a little stronger price activity in this range
717.00s: that simply didn't happen.
719.00s: And it's just because we can see that price has interacted with this general range several times
727.00s: before just kind of bouncing right through it.
731.00s: Now, GameStop has been consolidating sideways for about four days straight.
737.00s: So a lot of people are now trying to figure out what is the actual price level
744.00s: that the market thinks GameStop deserves to sit at.
749.00s: And I think a lot of that really is predicated on the market's perception
754.00s: of what Ryan Cohen might be thinking to do.
759.00s: And we simply don't know that yet.
761.00s: We know that they do have really strong positioning in terms of their cash.
765.00s: We've talked about that a million times.
767.00s: But the cash alone is not enough.
770.00s: You need more than just cash.
772.00s: It's a business.
773.00s: They're not a bank.
774.00s: They're not in the game of essentially borrowing from the federal government
779.00s: and then loaning out the money that they get from the federal government
782.00s: and capturing a spread like big banks can do.
785.00s: That's not what GameStop is.
787.00s: So while I will always reiterate the point, I see people talk about,
792.00s: oh, well, they're collecting interest on that money.
796.00s: They are collecting interest on the money.
798.00s: That's for sure.
799.00s: But again, that's not a viable business model.
802.00s: It's simply not.
803.00s: Now, the latest that we've seen from Cohen does start to make me think
811.00s: that there is a potential for involvement in cryptocurrency.
819.00s: And I'll show you why.
825.00s: So if we take a look at some of his general posts that we were looking through, right?
831.00s: So this came on the seventh of Feb.
833.00s: And we all know what sailor tens to embody,
838.00s: which is Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.
841.00s: And then if we take a look at his replies, there is this where the striveset management CEO
852.00s: essentially told Cohen that he should adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset using the five billion.
858.00s: And then he responds, let it received.
860.00s: There's a reality here that the only reason why he would bother responding here
868.00s: is to fuel that general idea that GameStop might be getting involved in cryptocurrency.
874.00s: There's no other reason for him to respond to this other than that.
881.00s: This is essentially a way to make a public statement.
884.00s: Now, again, what that actually means, I really don't know,
890.00s: because even if GameStop gets involved into Bitcoin,
895.00s: that still isn't a business model.
899.00s: It's not.
901.00s: And for those that look at something like MicroStrategy,
904.00s: MicroStrategy is a completely different beast that is effectively a Ponzi scheme.
910.00s: Because using that convertible debt is soon as the stock price dips for some reason or another
916.00s: below some of those convertible rates, the price levels that they would be converted at,
922.00s: they now have a massive problem.
924.00s: So it's kind of holding a ticking time bomb.
926.00s: I know Sailor talks about it very eloquently in terms of intelligent leverage and he's not wrong.
932.00s: Sailor knows all about that stuff.
934.00s: He knows more about that stuff than I do.
936.00s: There's no doubt in my mind about it.
938.00s: But there's also the reality of what these convertible debt, what these convertible securities are.
946.00s: And so anyways, I make that point clear because for people that are looking at MicroStrategy
952.00s: and saying, oh, Bitcoin can do what they do.
955.00s: It's a terrible idea.
957.00s: Sooner or later, MicroStrategy is going to reap what they sell.
960.00s: It's just a matter of how long and who makes enough money on other funds as they come in.
966.00s: I genuinely hope GameStop would not go that route because I still think that they have the potential
974.00s: to make a meaningful change in their business model, which is effectively what has to happen here.
980.00s: I think that that is the case.
982.00s: So that's the latest as far as I see it with GameStop.
985.00s: It's kind of not a whole lot new.
987.00s: Like that's really what that amounts to in my opinion.
990.00s: There's not like a ton of stuff that I'm seeing.
992.00s: It doesn't have earnings until the middle of this month.
995.00s: So we still have a little ways to go before earnings will kick off for GameStop.
1000.00s: I don't know if you guys agree with that.
1002.00s: I don't know if you're seeing something different than what I'm seeing.
1005.00s: But in general, that's kind of the the broad opinion that I have.
1009.00s: I think that there's a little bit of buzz around cryptocurrency.
1014.00s: And I'm not saying I think it's bad if they got involved in cryptocurrency.
1017.00s: I think it could be fine depending on how much they use and what the game plan is.
1020.00s: I'm not inherently against that.
1022.00s: But I just don't I don't think that's enough.
1024.00s: Like that that's just a piece of a puzzle.
1029.00s: But the company still has to be a company.
1032.00s: Still has to be a business and it still has to drive revenue.
1036.00s: Because a lot of people forget that if you get involved in something like Bitcoin,
1041.00s: which can be completely okay.
1042.00s: I have trades on in cryptocurrency for sure.
1045.00s: But if you get involved in Bitcoin, you also are involved in this, right?
1052.00s: Which is your balance sheet cratering from the start of the year effectively.
1058.00s: Where the beginning of the year, it's essentially hovering right around 99.5.
1062.00s: And now it's at 84, 830.
1066.00s: That's a pretty big unwind of your assets just because you're holding something that is incredibly volatile.
1073.00s: So again, not against it at all.
1076.00s: But I do think we have to look at it with not rose colored glasses and do our best as objective thinkers.
1084.00s: And to conclude what the impact could be of doing something like that.
1089.00s: And if you do that with a meaningful part of their cash, right?
1094.00s: So say they're sitting on five billion, say they put in three billion in a Bitcoin.
1097.00s: You might be super stoked on that.
1099.00s: Well, if they're actually going to try to use that five billion to reinvent the business,
1103.00s: to reinvest in itself, maybe to acquire a business.
1106.00s: And you're eyeballing something.
1108.00s: And then you're expecting to be able to use that money to acquire a business.
1112.00s: But then all of a sudden, you're buying power just collapses because of where spot Bitcoin is.
1120.00s: That's a tough fucking scenario to do business in.
1123.00s: And I mean, the reality is I can't imagine the world where they would actually get involved with Bitcoin using money
1133.00s: that they might have earmarked for a transaction because of how volatile that is.
1139.00s: I just I couldn't see the logic behind that.
1142.00s: I don't think they would do that just functionally doesn't make sense.
1146.00s: Lauren says I don't see them buying crypto alone as a business strategy moving forward.
1150.00s: That doesn't make sense to me.
1151.00s: But our C is up to something.
1152.00s: I just have no idea what it is.
1153.00s: I think that's fair.
1154.00s: And I also think a lot of us absolutely hope Cohen is up to something.
1160.00s: And right now it is based primarily on hope.
1164.00s: Like let's again, also keep it.
1167.00s: Keep it a buck.
1168.00s: There's nothing that we're seeing right now in terms of tangible information that lets us know that we are working on something or what we are working on.
1177.00s: And I actually don't think there's anything wrong with having an inherent level of trust for the CEO and their vision for the company.
1185.00s: Now sooner or later, we need to see it, right?
1189.00s: Because trust isn't something in this context that's just extended into perpetuity with nothing to show for it.
1198.00s: But right now, I think most of us myself included are giving Cohen plenty of grace and extending that trust to him because.
1210.00s: I mean, I personally think he's, I really do think he's very smart.
1214.00s: And I think that he knows what he wants to do.
1219.00s: I imagine he has a pretty firm game plan in terms of what he would attempt to do.
1223.00s: Now it's just a function of do the conditions, present themselves for him to be able to do what he might be thinking of.
1228.00s: But the other reality is that they have been sitting on this five billion for a little while now.
1238.00s: This isn't something that like just cropped up.
1242.00s: So is time goes on.
1245.00s: I do think the pressure starts to present itself a little bit more.
1249.00s: Whereas it's like, okay.
1252.00s: What is the actual plan?
1255.00s: Because we have been sitting on this cash for a while and would like to see it materialized.
1260.00s: But until that point, it's essentially a function of trust.
1264.00s: And I think that's the most trusting Cohen that he has an idea of what he wants to do.
1267.00s: The conditions probably are not right for it yet.
1269.00s: And once they are, I imagine we'll hear something.
1272.00s: At least that's the way that I typically look at it.
1274.00s: Apex says if you wait a few weeks, he will likely get a great price for Bitcoin.
1278.00s: You're absolutely correct, though.
1280.00s: At some point, a business model needs to arise.
1282.00s: Yeah, well, and that's the thing, right?
1284.00s: Is the nature of holding Bitcoin, I completely agree with you.
1288.00s: Even if you started getting into Bitcoin now, I think over a long term timeframe,
1293.00s: I think what you get Bitcoin for now is probably good, right?
1296.00s: Like if we're talking a long enough time horizon, I think even if you top ticked it at 100,000
1301.00s: before the drop, if we're talking about a five year horizon, I still imagine that's probably a pretty good price
1307.00s: compared to what it'll be at some point in the future.
1310.00s: But exactly to reiterate that point, if you get it now at a great price,
1314.00s: but then it takes five years for it to like really show a return on that price even three years.
1322.00s: That's a long time to hold the currency as a business and really not have a whole lot to show for it.
1330.00s: So I think even if it gets into Bitcoin again, like that's cool,
1336.00s: but unless they're going to do something to monetize the actual Bitcoin holdings,
1342.00s: they're at that point just holding a volatile asset, which is okay, right?
1349.00s: Again, there's nothing inherently wrong with it, but that's not a business model.
1352.00s: That's just holding a volatile asset on the balance sheet until you decide what you want to do,
1359.00s: you know, with the rest of the capital, which is what I think most of us,
1363.00s: at least for me, like that's what I'm very keen to get a better understanding of.
1368.00s: And I do believe when the time is appropriate, I do think we'll see it, right?
1375.00s: I do think that he'll start communicating more around it.
1378.00s: At least that's my hope.
1381.00s: My last ceilium says I hope he doesn't invest in Bitcoin.
1385.00s: Yeah, and it definitely is a mixed bag, right?
1387.00s: Like there are definitely people like that.
1388.00s: I don't blame him because again, if one of the best things I saw in one of the videos is the one of my videos talking about this similar thing,
1399.00s: and it genuinely is my exact same opinion.
1403.00s: And it was a person that commented they were like, if I wanted Bitcoin, I would buy Bitcoin.
1408.00s: Right?
1409.00s: Like that's not why people are buying GameStop.
1411.00s: People aren't buying GameStop to buy Bitcoin.
1414.00s: When you buy GameStop, you're buying a completely different business model than that.
1419.00s: But Lauren says I hope there was a bit more guidance next earnings, but he's not known for that.
1425.00s: To be completely honest, I naively thought that we would have gotten more guidance in the last earnings release.
1433.00s: And the fact that we didn't there leads me to believe that the previous guidance that you heard is probably going to be the same guidance going forward.
1442.00s: Because it's not like that they raised the money and just said nothing, right?
1445.00s: If we go through the earnings transcripts, they absolutely have talked a little bit about what they're loosely.
1454.00s: Looking to do so let's take a look really quick.
1457.00s: We're in my looking form trying to find something really quick.
1480.00s: No, not here.
1498.00s: I was trying to find there was a couple things that I saw not too long ago.
1502.00s: It's last earnings release.
1503.00s: Obviously was essentially pretty sparse.
1506.00s: It was just about the actual performance of the company.
1509.00s: There wasn't a lot of forward looking guidance in it.
1512.00s: And that's like that's the fucking tricky part here, right?
1515.00s: So like if you go through their earnings release, when you go through their their actual investor relations, filings here, you typically let me give you another example.
1528.00s: A typical earnings release.
1541.00s: Where is it?
1548.00s: Oh, I don't want to.
1553.00s: So if for for a comparison, if you take a look, a normal company, when they report their earnings, they essentially have a press release, they typically have a call.
1568.00s: And it's during these things that you get a sense of what the company is about, what the company is thinking, what they're actually doing.
1581.00s: There's some qualitative elements around the earnings release.
1586.00s: If you look at GameStop by comparison, this is what GameStop gives you.
1595.00s: Which again, objectively is trash.
1598.00s: Like this is for an investor, for a standard investor.
1602.00s: This is not what I want to see.
1604.00s: Like what I want to see is the actual company talking about what they're about, what they're doing, what they're planning.
1612.00s: And GameStop notoriously does not really provide that.
1617.00s: GameStop is a lot more, you know, quiet.
1623.00s: They kind of move behind closed doors.
1627.00s: And there could be a reason for that.
1629.00s: Now, my hope is again, that we would see a little bit of a differing perspective, but like you can get, I don't know if this will work.
1643.00s: Let's see, because this is the closest thing that we got to something like that.
1656.00s: This, anyways, I can't click into it because it's not, they don't have like the recording there.
1661.00s: But you can, like that's where you can get a little bit of that qualitative information about the company.
1668.00s: So do keep I says GameStop is trash.
1671.00s: Actually, don't agree with that.
1673.00s: I think GameStop is a really interesting company.
1677.00s: I think, I mean, objectively speaking, they're not the best performing company out there by far.
1682.00s: Right? Like that's, it's not like a controversial statement that is exactly what it is.
1687.00s: But I also think that it's the kind of company that does have the potential to have a pretty strong turnaround.
1695.00s: And that kind of strong turnaround can, like things like this can drive tremendous amounts of value if the turnaround is done well.
1710.00s: And that's kind of the cool part, I think, is that, and that's more for like the value side of things for the near term side of things a lot of is the volatility.
1720.00s: Like the entire, the implied volatility percentile right now for GameStop is 23%.
1724.00s: The implied volatility outright is 87%.
1728.00s: So what that shows you is that with implied volatility is high is 87% and the implied volatility percentile is low is 23%. Supervolta.
1740.00s: Which from an option trading perspective is actually really attractive.
1746.00s: Lauren says, I believe our C's mentor did the same preferred news to come out via legal filings.
1752.00s: Is that the case?
1754.00s: Because it wouldn't surprise me like this does have an also did he, I didn't follow Chewie.
1761.00s: Did he have a similar, because that would be interesting to be honest.
1765.00s: If he had the same, if he had like the same approach with something like Chewie as well, where, well, let's see if we can find their old, the old statements that would be kind of interesting to me.
1783.00s: I'm going to find some of two result statements.
1804.00s: So obviously their new stuff they have press releases and stuff.
1809.00s: But let's go back. When was.
1813.00s: Co in the CEO.
1827.00s: 2018.
1828.00s: So 2011 to 2018. So let's go back.
1833.00s: Damn.
1835.00s: Haters. That's annoying.
1838.00s: I would have liked to have seen if he maintained the same, the same thing, but this only lets us go back to 2020.
1846.00s: Companies regularly do this because they try to shelter themselves a little bit.
1853.00s: But you can see they just started earnings presentations.
1857.00s: They just use to just be press releases.
1861.00s: And the financial docs.
1863.00s: So that's for even Chewie.
1866.00s: So yeah, I mean, there's a really good chance that they probably had a similar, similar approach.
1874.00s: Apex says GameStop has potential. I haven't touched it in quite a while in all honesty, but I think if they integrated somehow with like, matter or something, you know, yeah, I agree.
1882.00s: And that's kind of the cool part about GameStop is that they have a really captive base.
1889.00s: And again, like I'm always super straightforward with you guys.
1894.00s: GameStop is a very small part of my portfolio.
1898.00s: And it's because like I trade for a living. It's how I make money.
1904.00s: So I need to trade things that I can consistently move around and find really good opportunities relative to the risk that I'm taking.
1914.00s: With GameStop, I really am more, I more participate out of respect for the the ape community more than anything.
1925.00s: And because like trading games, not just fine, but like there's plenty of things I can trade that move very similarly.
1933.00s: But none of this stuff also is like the same story and the same characters, including people like the cat who we haven't seen from in a hot minute.
1943.00s: But he's also always just a wild card that's very fun.
1948.00s: The just see how he interacts with stuff. You just you just don't know, which is very entertaining.
1954.00s: All right, we don't have a whole lot of time left. So I want to click into this and let's see what we got.
1961.00s: So we read the Sun never sets on Citadel part one last time that's where we left off.
1966.00s: So now we are in three July of 2021 reading part two.
1970.00s: And let's see. So they're correcting. I need to apologize.
1977.00s: I run honestly said Citadel was a market maker across E you in part one. I found conflicting sources in Citadel is a market maker in Ireland, but I should have clarified.
1988.00s: Yeah, okay, got it. Okay, so I'm going to try to zoom this in. Can I zoom this in? No, I forgot it doesn't let me zoom in slightly.
2001.00s: Okay, so we're on the game stop price artificial thing.
2007.00s: Citadel being a massive play in the market, which fun fact.
2014.00s: Fun fact, um, Ken was at Trump's cabinet meeting.
2020.00s: So the I'm not bringing that up because I know people are all over the place politically couldn't possibly care less.
2027.00s: Just saying regardless of who the president is or that person to be meaning Ken to be in a cabinet meeting with whoever the president is is telling that they're obviously at the highest echelons of power within the US.
2049.00s: And Ben says is GME like the white whale of options world. No, not really. I don't think so. I mean, I honestly think most like the vast majority of actual options trader know very little about game stop.
2063.00s: And it's because like in options trading, there's just there's so many things to do.
2069.00s: So this like full time options traders just move between opportunities as they exist.
2075.00s: So like the reality is the vast majority of options traders don't know a whole lot about the majority of the companies that we trade because we know most of the information is going to be baked into the options chain.
2087.00s: So now there will be certain companies that are just you know larger than life so to speak and game stop is one of them because I have a good friend that I met through another friend who runs like ETF funds.
2105.00s: And then I met this other friend through the ETF guy that is a market maker and he's worked at most of the large institutions and then he's opened up his own shop.
2117.00s: And I regularly just hit him up to bullshit with him. He's a little bit older, but he has a insane amount of experience of making markets and then also being an institutional prop firm style of options trading.
2132.00s: Because options portfolio solutions for other kinds of portfolios like you know that are external to his fund to help streamline because one of the main uses for options is actually hedging risk and kind of providing that keel of a ship.
2147.00s: So I speak with people like him about this stuff and like he's generally familiar with game stop because of the just insane fervor that we went through back in 21 and then also you know more recently in May of last year.
2164.00s: But beyond that he's not like plugged into all the nit-noying new ones details of it. It's just not really what would appeal to them.
2173.00s: They're again mostly looking for opportunities and moving in and out through things. I am very much an anomaly in that case with the level of interest that game stop has spurred in me for a lot of different reasons.
2188.00s: And yeah, I mean, as you get like obviously I spent a lot of time on this shit and it's not because this is the best place for me to spend my time to make money like I know that I willingly know that and I don't care.
2200.00s: I'm just interested in it. It's like a fun side project for me. And it also I've said this a million times, but it helps me learn a lot about market plumbing, which is again for most options traders not really that important objectively speaking is just not that important.
2217.00s: But it's interesting to me. I have an obsessive personality over things in game stop is become a very curious vector for me to learn a lot about the market, which I enjoy.
2232.00s: Lauren says I like that when they integrated card grading they moved quickly as a company to implement it completely agree. And that's the cool part right is when they do find something that they like it they they make moves son, which is cool.
2246.00s: So that's why I think Cohen does have other tricks in the bag because he's clearly doing things throughout the path as they make sense on the way. Yeah, completely agree.
2258.00s: It picks us. I have not traded options. You look for a lot of things. I know that is it true that you try to build into a position while volatility is lower along with a thousand other things not inherently know.
2272.00s: Yeah, no, definitely not. It is entirely relative volatility being high or low is simply an input into the model of what am I trying to accomplish with the position.
2285.00s: It's not volatility is low need to build positions because you can also build positions when volatility is high that either capture the movement subsequent or try to capture the collapse of volatility.
2297.00s: There's a ton of shit that you can do. So I would I would offer it's much less of a volatility is low build a position. It's much more of a volatility is low. How does that factor into the trade that I'm trying to put on like that kind of thing.
2314.00s: Okay, well Wall Street bets take over as costs the shorts and estimated 30 billion that's awesome. There's also been a monster payday for Wall Street's market makers and the free trading platforms they pay off.
2328.00s: Back the envelope we are looking at about 350 million in trading costs just for the four main stocks target it. Yep, that's exactly correct. And this is also why very frequently people I think misunderstand.
2343.00s: The intentions of market makers. I think a lot of people think that market makers have like these absolutely terrible terrible.
2356.00s: I don't know like like incentives and intent towards other entities and traders like it just I don't really see that more broadly now again as always that doesn't mean market makers wouldn't attempt.
2373.00s: To take advantage where they could of course they would because it is a for profit thing but I always feel like if you understand the motivations of people and in just accept what they are you can have a healthier relationship with them. It's kind of like these people that think that that have a pet tiger that the fucking tiger is their friend the tiger is their friend as long as you fed them and keep them happy and you understand.
2397.00s: That that tiger is a fucking predator and as long as you interact with it understanding its intentions you can be fine with the tiger.
2406.00s: But if the tiger starts to get kind of hungry and there's no food around and you're not doing a good job taking care of it a fucking tiger will eat you.
2414.00s: So it's kind of like the same thing with market makers they think that in general their incentives are very clear like the way that they're making money in this case is right here you see what's this average spread percent.
2427.00s: They're not going to be paying off the spreads and that's why they might have an opinion in terms of direction sometimes and they might absolutely try to influence price movement if they can hear in there.
2440.00s: But it's not like the market makers are just behind the scenes like pulling these strings making stock a go up and stock B go down.
2448.00s: It is a little bit too large to work that way and that's what it's kind of a good thing but there can be pockets where there's price manipulation and I do believe there are clear instances that we can see it in something like GameStop.
2463.00s: So again sometimes when I talk about this stuff people take binary positions and then they misinterpret what I say because I operate very much within the gray scale of things if this is an absolute left and right.
2475.00s: I typically find to the best of my analysis what what the gray scale is whereas most people they'll say exactly stuff like this right.
2485.00s: If you go to the front it says the price of GM is artificial.
2489.00s: It's not artificial it can have manipulated elements it can have misreportings at times but to just blanket sweep say at all times now GameStop prices artificial.
2501.00s: It just it doesn't really make sense and I think people in general would be better off if they step away from like the binary evaluation of things and say well you know the market's completely rigged.
2518.00s: That's not like they're absolutely are disadvantages and they're absolutely our periods where the market might be rigged in certain ways.
2526.00s: I think a great example of that is naked shorting what the fuck is naked shorting that shouldn't be a thing there should never be a case where a stock can have over a hundred percent of its fucking float shorted it just doesn't make sense.
2541.00s: But that aside and even though that that fuckery is a foot it doesn't mean that everything everywhere is now all of a sudden manipulated and you can't trust anything and it's all bullshit right like again there's a gray scale here just because this one thing exists that absolutely should not exist does not mean everything else is a facade in this bullshit.
2566.00s: And naked shorting shouldn't exist though it's that's fucking ridiculous.
2573.00s: All right.
2575.00s: Let's continue so market makers made an estimated bunch of money.
2580.00s: We know that the market makers also took the full income of the shares they sold since they were selling blood shares and never delivered completely agree and that that is bullshit like this should not be a thing.
2592.00s: The the fail to deliver mechanism especially as it pertains to market makers is complete and utter fucking bullshit the ability to use locates as shares that's that's literally like me going to the casino losing $200,000
2611.00s: and then being like yo this this piece of paper I owe you will work right like this is good enough same same word chill.
2621.00s: I know the fuck it's not so yeah completely agree with that point that's fucking crazy absolute bullshit.
2629.00s: This illustrates how the market makers generate off of any volume they do this with nearly any security or transaction they make a market for yeah I mean that's correct again like going back the other direction that's not the same thing.
2641.00s: The point of market makers is they provide liquidity and then they're compensated to provide the liquidity so yeah I think that this is correct.
2652.00s: So the same activities that empower apes to create the moass also provide market makers with more resources to prolong the arrival of moass this is actually inaccurate it's not correct because they're essentially saying that what would prevent moass in this case or slow moass is.
2671.00s: The amount of money that a market maker has and that's really not it the thing that leads to moass is a constrained underlying meaning it's not readily available and then you have the confluence of a short squeeze coalescing with the gamma squeeze like that's what leads to at least the nearest thing that I can conceive of with respect to moass I know that they probably have.
2698.00s: A very specific version of moass in their brain and the difference is is that I find most of the people that hypothesize about moass from the game stop community I find it to be way more from a theoretical perspective right people saying like oh the stocks going to 100,000 per share.
2716.00s: And I mean theoretically I'm not even in a position to argue that one way or the other set like I genuinely don't understand the economics of it in that capacity I don't know but what I do know is it's not going there.
2726.00s: And the reason why it's not going there is because during the last squeeze the main squeeze when they turn off the fucking buy button they stepped in front of it market forces institutional forces and again I actually don't even I don't fully disagree with it because although it would be really cool to see hedge funds that are naked shorting something get blown up and I actually I'm completely in favor of that I'm not super jazzed on the entire financial.
2756.00s: System potentially collapsing or the entire market potentially collapsing because of this little black hole that forms so I think it's fine to let the companies go insolvent that should go insolvent but the broader point is for the for the expectations of moass that's a tricky one because they've already stepped in front of it and stopped it so I don't see a world where they would allow moass to go further in the future than what it did previously.
2786.00s: Because they already said that there's a risk to the financial system here and I don't see them now saying at the risk is less let's just let it go to 100,000 and see how it goes and you just don't see that scenario so anyways back to the original point because it's not constrained by capital that's why I don't agree with this that I think that the market makers capacity to create resources and make money that doesn't stop moass from happening in its form what the market is going to be.
2815.00s: What would stop moass from happening is from the stock being readily available and from short interest contracting massively because that loop is really what is required to then coalesce altogether to cause a significant short squeeze there's plenty of short squeezes that occur it's just nowhere near to the same magnitude that what you would have seen in game stop but.
2843.00s: Anyways let's continue volume is king once a firm hits critical mass of transactions becomes impossible not to deal with that firm yeah I agree with this.
2854.40s: That can grip from quotes took out to me we manufacture money okay.
2860.60s: I have a background in operations manufacturing logistics okay.
2866.80s: You can think of the financial industry is one that manufactures transactions in the same way the automotive manufacturers vehicles.
2874.40s: Manufacturer transaction requires a buyer seller a product.
2879.60s: And is produced in a venue.
2884.30s: The national supply comes from the collection of different factories.
2888.60s: Okay just try not understand their point your market maker you already provide raw materials for the buyer seller and what would you do next if you wanted to grow okay so they're just talking about how market makers or institutions are incentivized.
2906.60s: That expand their role in markets like that's what this essentially means.
2911.20s: I don't know why my screen keeps doing that by the way.
2920.20s: Okay so they're kind of just furthering their analogy.
2928.20s: The buyer is interested in one thing ease of access I mean that's literally completely wrong.
2936.20s: This is completely wrong.
2939.20s: What is a buyer interested in if you go to a store and let's say let's say you needed to grab a toothbrush and the toothbrush was the most easily accessible toothbrush in the entire store.
2957.20s: You don't even have to get out of your car they actually bring the toothbrush to you but that toothbrush costs $500.
2969.20s: Does the ease of access to that toothbrush.
2974.00s: Overcome the cost of the toothbrush and the answer is unequivocally no it does not so.
2984.80s: It's just a really important differentiating point for this corner three analogy of a buyer a buyer is not interested in one thing being ease of access.
2994.80s: If we were to talk about the one thing a buyer is interested it's getting something at a good price to invert the example.
3004.80s: Let's say that you could get a collectors item and let's say it's a Pokemon card is a shout out in a salute to my boy Richard Newton.
3015.80s: And let's say that you go get this Pokemon card is super super valuable and it's being sold really cheap. Let's say the card is worth $10,000 and you can get it for 30 bucks.
3028.80s: Guess what happens.
3030.80s: You don't really give much of a fuck what you got to do to go get that card.
3036.80s: If you have to drive six hours to get it you drive the six hours. If you have to get on a plane and go fly to get it you get on a plane and go fly to get it provided that the cost of the flight accommodations and getting it when you get there is cheaper than the card itself.
3049.80s: The point is value is what buyers care about it's not ease of access. Now that's again it's not binary that's not to say people don't care about ease of access.
3061.80s: They absolutely do. But if it's a choice between ease of access and value value wins every fucking time without a doubt.
3071.80s: Okay.
3073.80s: Yeah, see he hits it here acceptable prices. That's that's the most important part. It's not just ease of access.
3080.80s: Okay, we will continue.
3083.80s: Volume is king citadel does so much volume that it's considered securities wholesaler citadel is a massive network of sales connections through market maker presence that exchanges. Okay.
3094.80s: Citadel has ease of access advantage. They absolutely do.
3100.80s: Citadel has a privacy and pricing advantage they do. I agree.
3107.80s: So guess what citadel wants to do.
3111.80s: Citadel doesn't need a venue citadel the venue citadel is internalizing a substantial volume. Okay.
3120.80s: So they're essentially talking about how citadel is consuming more and more of the space which I agree with.
3126.80s: Citadel is moving beyond monopolizing the market maker role is captured a massive portion of all securities transaction is moving them off exchanges for an unisqually portion of transactions citadel is the same.
3136.80s: Yeah.
3139.80s: Sort of the the moving moving volume off exchange isn't because of citadel by the way moving volume off exchange is from a buyer preference.
3155.80s: And the reason why dark pools exist is to facilitate order flow and one other really common misconception about dark pools is that dark pools still hit the consolidated tape.
3174.80s: This stuff that is moved off exchange and does not hit the consolidated tape are things that are internalized that won't hit the consolidated tape.
3186.80s: Really important distinction and something I commonly commonly see misunderstood now the point that this is really important is that the decision to move orders off exchange is really more so for larger institutions.
3200.80s: It's why dark pools were invented and it's because people confront run order flow.
3205.80s: So then if I'm trying to put in a really big block order and I can see it getting chunked up because there's not enough liquidity at a certain price point.
3213.80s: I confront run that order flow like a lot of other smart traders do me myself Eric and there's institutions and high for consider trading firms that are poaching these orders.
3222.80s: Essentially to front run the order flow because we know that there's a big order that's trying to get pushed through so essentially we can buy into that and then buy into it here and then sell into that same order flow as it's moving up.
3234.80s: So the point of dark pools is to prevent that kind of behavior which I do understand.
3239.80s: But again, just an important differentiation.
3245.80s: Citadel's overall volume market position are prohibitive to new competition and also drives way all but the largest competitors.
3253.80s: Sort of.
3256.80s: It's not prohibitive but it definitely is challenging like any large institution that becomes an incumbent like I do agree with that is like if you think of something like Amazon.
3269.80s: Really difficult to compete with Amazon if you're something else like that's not easy to do so I do get it and I do agree with the general sentiment.
3287.80s: Everyone's room knew about naked shortings Citadel primary cope. Yeah, yeah, be up.
3293.80s: Citadel's defaulting is the equivalent of the entire economy getting full blown aids and spinal cancer at the same time knocking out the immune system functional response this leaves market vulnerable to violent price swings that can instantly bankrupt other players.
3309.80s: Which is why the DCCC is so concerned about member defaulting and transferring assets and another reason why Moise is taking so long every player in the economy needs to do assets to remain attacked stabilize.
3320.80s: Yeah, well again, the other thing to remember it's it's it's why Moise in the form that I'm assuming this person thinks of it and is is overwhelmingly likely not going to happen.
3334.80s: And it's again the same intervention that happened during 2008 when things are so off sides.
3343.80s: I mean it even happened during the intervention during covid right like when when the market in general starts to see really large skew one direction or another in terms of risk they tend to step in to try to stabilize it.
3359.80s: And it's because it's not worth the entire financial system or a segment of the financial system or so on and so forth to literally collapse not it's not a commensurate value problem.
3372.80s: So.
3377.80s: Yeah, and then I think the next one on here is Dave Lauer so I have to hop off but I need to where is that I'm excited to look at Dave Lauer's.
3391.80s: I actually was just talking with him last week you know we're bullshit a little bit and I think we're doing a episode for Irvin next week so yeah looking forward to connect them with him again.
3405.80s: I think one of the things I might do when we continue going through this honestly is.
3411.80s: I think it could be kind of cool to sort this the other way to because a lot of these are different versions of themselves really what's the latest version that was uploaded 23 really what happened apes.
3428.80s: What the fuck 17 April 23 we haven't been active in two years on making these things.
3438.80s: The fuck that's bullshit I like these these are fun.
3445.80s: Yo, y'all got to get to work talk to talk to some friends whoever fucking does these things this is cool is shit I don't even know how to do this like make these magazines and stuff it's cool as fuck.
3458.80s: Damn.
3460.80s: Y'all got me depressed.
3463.80s: Not that.
3465.80s: I thought at least up until like 24.
3468.80s: Damn.
3470.80s: That's how she goes sometimes.
3472.80s: Any questions anything you guys want to hit before we wrap up.
3478.80s: Apex says we're the most shorts currently lying game stop in your opinion like where would it squeeze all time highs.
3484.80s: Fucking a bro.
3488.80s: Ain't that the fucking question that's a great question.
3492.80s: Fucking a though I have no conceivable idea.
3497.80s: My underlying instinct is if we look at a price of game stop and we think of areas right so the idea of shorting.
3511.80s: Shorting can happen at a lot of places now game stop was obviously heavily shorted during this period at lows which is really dangerous.
3523.80s: Then as it starts to to peak and spike up.
3527.80s: The shorts are starting to cover because this is dangerous.
3532.80s: This is a hand grenade that is in the process of detonating and we have to try to throw it.
3537.80s: Before it takes our hand off again talking from the perspective of the shorts.
3542.80s: But then as it returns back down to this level you can cover you can cover most of your risk and it's not really at a terrible loss because the other reality is it is insanely unlikely that they were short coming into this.
3559.80s: Buying into this and then did not have shorts coming through this.
3569.80s: The very high probability is that they also would have profited massively from this down move even though that the net impact of their position could be detrimental because of the overall shorts that they held coming into it and had to cover through it.
3584.80s: So all of that aside I don't think shorts right now.
3592.80s: One I don't think they're in a really dangerous spot because the stock is readily available the stock is everywhere.
3599.80s: One of the things that made this such a unique circumstance and why it ran the way it did is because at this point.
3607.80s: Game stop was starting to be completely locked up the float was small.
3613.80s: And with such a small float with the majority of it being locked up it makes the stock itself very, very difficult to get in order to close positions if you're short.
3624.80s: Not so much the case anymore.
3626.80s: So there are plenty of shares around for people to close out positions and the thing is is that anybody that has these massive open short positions.
3636.80s: I guarantee you they're hedging around it with options and derivatives.
3641.80s: There's no reason for them not to guarantee you that they're doing that.
3645.80s: So it's not like they're going to be eating just taking it the shots in the face with the movement against them and just kind of like grip in the wheel holding it works out like institutions are sophisticated.
3660.80s: They're not like retail traders when something goes against us. We just kind of like hold hold out for hope like hope is not a strategy for professional traders hope can be there like it's nice to have it but that's not a fucking strategy.
3676.80s: So the reality is to summarize that random me entering of thoughts.
3683.80s: I would imagine the shorts are a lot of different places. I do not imagine there are many shorts that got top ticked.
3689.80s: I do not mean that kind of bottom tech like I don't think that there's going to be a ton of shorts down here.
3694.80s: And if there were they would have been closing out.
3697.80s: So and that's part of the movement that we saw by the way in this case and that's also why this movement didn't go as haywire as it did before is because I think they were much wiser to the game this go around and this go around.
3712.80s: So I imagine the shorts that exist now probably have hedges in place.
3718.80s: And I think that they would continue to hedge and increase the ratio of their hedge if there is a big move against them and I think that they have access to the underlying.
3727.80s: So where they are I'm not really sure but I also don't think it matters that much.
3734.80s: Ben says is it not possible that they figured out the deal with GME and other there could be a spike but there would never be a push to all time highs again.
3741.80s: Yeah, that absolutely could be the case. Absolutely.
3744.80s: I think that it's well, I think it's much more likely that game stop would approach all time highs through a fundamental reinventing of the business than another short gamma squeeze combined.
3758.80s: That's what I think.
3762.80s: Dark Gen says think game stop can hit 40s in the foreseeable future without big hype. Yeah, I think so.
3769.80s: I do think he can get into the 40s.
3771.80s: I think the again, I think at least in my mind, most of the primary price movement that you're going to see in game stop is going to be a reflection of the actual business like the actual underlying business and the operation of the underlying business, which I don't think is a bad thing.
3786.80s: Right, because to trade through shorts, which I do when they happen, it's very difficult.
3793.80s: And the liquidity typically is a pretty big problem.
3797.80s: So I think the company being in a position where it can actually reinvent itself and make fundamental changes and change its value that way.
3811.80s: I think that that's good. And I think that it's highly, highly likely because that's what this whole move was here.
3819.80s: This wasn't on a bunch of hype this move up here that we saw to the low 30s. That was on fundamental value.
3827.80s: And I think that you're likely to see this kind of movement again once the company starts to sort itself out because one of the things that I try to
3837.80s: you guys in the use in my analysis is that after the company made its raises of capital, it then starts to beg the question, well, where's the floor and how are we pricing the floor.
3851.80s: And it's because they're in a better position now than they were here objectively.
3857.80s: So then the real question becomes how do they use the money and then do investors see the future in terms of future cash flows of how they're going to use the money.
3871.80s: That's the big question now because I'll be honest with you, I've GameStop invests in some terrible business that everybody's like, oh, that fucking business is dying to that doesn't boat well for the company.
3882.80s: But if GameStop invests in something and they have a great direction that looks to be able to capitalize on its current assets, both tangible and intangible.
3895.80s: Then I think people start to say like this company could turn around and then that starts to lead to people taking speculative positions in the company.
3904.80s: Right, because then it becomes from a value traders perspective, which is a lot of how big funds are going to operate long term positions in this.
3911.80s: The way that they look at this is from the context of risk to reward.
3915.80s: If I think the floor and GameStop based on the breadth of my analysis speaking from the lens of an institution is 20 and a half something like that because I think with the amount of cash that they have the intellectual property and just the physical real estate blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I think it might be this whatever it is.
3932.80s: Then you start to say to yourself, well, if I get in here when it's 25 and I think the floor is 20 and a half and five points of risk, where is based on the companies that it's investing in and how those companies are growing and the expectation of future cash flows, I think the company could be valued at $50.
3956.80s: So then you're essentially taking five points of risk at a shot of 25 points of risk or reward, depending on the analysis and then the subsequent probabilities.
3967.80s: So that's why this concept of value is really important because traders, we come and we go, we're unfaithful as fuck, we're in, we're out, we're moving in between things trying to find money.
3978.80s: The things that cause persistent price trends of things are new investors coming in and leaving their money in the company because they believe in the future.
3987.80s: That's what has to happen here and I do think that that's absolutely a potential because it already started to happen here, which is super cool.
3995.80s: But you need earnings, you have to have earnings that are growing.
4001.80s: And right now the company is struggling with that, but if you have a company that has growing earnings, growing revenue, growing sales, that becomes really attractive to a lot of people, especially if it's at a good value, entire thing we talked about earlier, the thing that investors and traders really care about value.
4021.80s: If it's at a good value, then they'll absolutely start to speculate with it for sure, good risk or reward ratio.
4029.80s: Then says, I would figure they just don't shares that makes them rich. Who's they?
4038.80s: It's not possible to figure it out the deal with GameStop.
4042.80s: I'm not sure who they is if you're talking like the funds and stuff. The thing to remember though, GameStop.
4051.80s: You mean like the company? The game GameStop is a business. They don't want to over dilute. That's not good either.
4061.80s: Lauren says, what's your opinion about institutions growing their position? I think it's good. Actually, we can take a quick look at a chart. Let's see.
4080.80s: I want to see if I can find a natural. I like this better.
4103.80s: Let's see. Yeah, like you can take a look. A bunch of these are building their positions. Let's see what's decreasing.
4115.80s: Vanack, Renaissance, closed a lot. JP Morgan closed a bit. Let's see look at expanding.
4125.80s: Yeah, like they took a leverage position.
4132.80s: So the reality is I think institutional sponsorship is really important in tracking institutional sponsorship is really important because this is effectively how the company is going to grow longer term.
4148.80s: You can see that net movement is positive. Right. Like most people are extending and expanding their positions are holding them only 89 a small subset goes to close out.
4161.80s: So I think institutions building their positions is really important. Again, this is talking about the long term viability of the company and like the future of the company. That's the lens that I use for this and why I think that's the case.
4175.80s: So yeah, it's exactly what I think. It's pretty interesting. Yeah, I think it's I think expanding institutional ownership is good. That's what I think.
4189.80s: All right, gang. Awesome hanging out. Got a bounce. Let me know if you need anything as always being outlier being an ape. Be whatever makes it happy. See you all later.
