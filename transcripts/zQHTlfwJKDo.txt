300.00s:  you
312.00s:  you
314.00s:  What's up, everybody? I'm here. I'm in the process of trying to copy a calculator, because
335.68s:  I wanted to spend a little time actually analyzing some of the recent price movement in GameStop
342.36s:  today. So it looks like the copy went all right. It's just going to take a hot minute for it to
349.24s:  load because the document is pretty large. So we're going to take a couple minutes and talk about
357.00s:  where GameStop is today, how things look, and then we'll continue down the path of this document
366.04s:  here, which is analyzing the theories, planning the stream to be probably about half hour,
370.68s:  something like that. And let's get right to it. Charlie, hope everybody is having an awesome
376.44s:  weekend. And I still get the sense it feels like things are quiet from the ape community. It
384.28s:  definitely feels like things have quieted down. I can kind of tell from a few different vectors.
390.36s:  Obviously, the GameStop videos that I put out, they always provide a proxy for how many people
395.80s:  are actively engaging in the stock. And then also, honestly, the number of emails that I get with
401.16s:  people asked me to look at things, which is always actually very, very fun for me. But yeah, it seems
407.40s:  pretty quiet. And it doesn't surprise me because I mean, if we think about it, GameStop has been
412.52s:  essentially in a downtrend for two months now. So this downtrend started, I'll show you after
421.08s:  we had a bit of a peak here. We saw that in the beginning of January. Things were actually
425.96s:  looking really good, really healthy. And then it's been slowly tailoring down from there.
432.76s:  Now, I think the main question, at least in my mind, and probably everybody's mind is,
439.24s:  where's the floor? Where does it actually seem like GameStop is likely
445.64s:  to gain some traction? And we can see that that's sort of happening here. I can get rid of
451.96s:  this value. I'll keep that value area for now, because I want to talk about it actually briefly.
456.68s:  We can get rid of that one. And we still have this pretty well-defined descending channel.
464.12s:  So as things sit today with GameStop, the stock itself has been sitting on really, really quiet
473.96s:  circumstances. There's really not a lot of news coming out. There's not a lot of buzz about what
480.04s:  they're doing. There's not a broad overarching narrative that I'm seeing pushed out currently
488.44s:  about GameStop. There's definitely some glimpses that we've seen. And I've actually talked about this
492.60s:  in a couple previous videos with respect to Cohen. And he's alluding to things here and there,
501.32s:  but nothing firm, obviously. And the broader market itself is also struggling right now.
510.20s:  So if we take a look at the broad market, and I just look at total performance, let me tell you
518.04s:  right now, IWM small caps is down 3.7% year to date. Spy is up to 0.81%. Q's is down 1.2.
534.04s:  So in Bitcoin, Ibit, just add a curiosity is down 12.8. Bonds are up slightly, VIX is up slightly.
542.92s:  The reason why I bother telling you these metrics is because it gives us a little bit of context
550.52s:  around how the broader market is behaving right now, which is still part of what GameStop fits in,
556.04s:  which is the broader market. And I continue to see a lot of different theories and ideas around
563.32s:  the price movement. It seems like people are still very, very interested in trying to crack that
567.40s:  code and I don't blame them. It's a very, very curious problem to try to analyze. But based on what
574.20s:  I've seen so far, I still haven't seen any of these key theories panning out. And we've spent,
581.88s:  again, this is the 16th episode of looking at the top theories themselves. And I approached the
589.80s:  problem set from a really advantaged position. And that's simply because I'm not in here trying to
597.08s:  prove my own theory. I don't really have one beyond the stuff that I've already talked to you
601.24s:  all about with respect to price and volume. So the reason I say it's an advantage position is
607.16s:  because it's always easy to look at other people's ideas and poke holes, but not give your own.
612.04s:  And that's not really the aim of what I'm doing. I'm actively trying to see if I can identify any
619.56s:  instances where it looks like there might be this broader underlying function that we may or
626.92s:  may not be aware of or actively see. And in general, don't really see a lot of it to be completely
634.92s:  honest with you. There are elements that I continue to see in terms of FTDs. I definitely think
644.44s:  that we can point to some of these things naked shorting and identify things that are interacting
650.68s:  with the system very clearly. That I think we all are aware of. The game is trying to identify
659.72s:  how those things influence the system. And then is there a way to trade some sort of repetitive
668.92s:  function that's a artifact of these other things that are impacting the system. And so far,
677.08s:  I've not seen it. Now, I'm eager to continue going through the DD library with you all and see
682.76s:  what pops up, what else might be in there. We have a lot to uncover still. But that's just kind of
687.64s:  like where things sit as of now based on the, I mean, many hours that we've spent at this point,
695.08s:  looking at the stuff together. Now, to take a look at GameStop itself, a couple of things really
701.08s:  stuck out to me. The first thing that stuck out to me was the behavior in this value area here.
709.48s:  Now, I originally would have anticipated a little stronger price activity in this range
717.72s:  that simply didn't happen. And it's just because we can see that price has interacted with this
725.24s:  general range several times before just kind of bouncing right through it. Now GameStop has been
732.76s:  consolidating sideways for about four days straight. So a lot of people are now trying to figure out
741.08s:  what is the actual price level that the market thinks GameStop deserves to sit at.
749.64s:  And I think a lot of that really is predicated on the market's perception of what Ryan Cohen
756.84s:  might be thinking to do. And we simply don't know that yet. We know that they do have really strong
763.16s:  positioning in terms of their cash. We've talked about that a million times. But the cash alone
769.16s:  is not enough. You need more than just cash. It's a business. They're not a bank. They're not in
774.92s:  the game of essentially borrowing from the federal government and then loaning out the money that
780.76s:  they get from the federal government and capturing a spread like big banks can do. That's not what GameStop
786.84s:  is. So while I will always reiterate the point, I see people talk about, oh, well, they're collecting
794.04s:  interest on that money. They are collecting interest on the money. That's for sure. But again,
800.12s:  that's not a viable business model. It's simply not. Now the latest that we've seen from Cohen
807.48s:  does start to make me think that there is a potential for involvement in cryptocurrency. And I'll
819.64s:  show you why. So if we take a look at some of his general posts that we were looking through,
830.28s:  right? So this came on the seventh of Feb. And we all know what sailor tends to embody, which is
838.44s:  Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. And then if we take a look at his replies, there is this where
846.68s:  the Strive asset management CEO essentially told Cohen that he should adopt Bitcoin as a reserve
855.64s:  asset using the five billion. And then he responds, let it received. There's a reality here that the
862.76s:  only reason why he would bother responding here is to fuel that general idea that GameStop might
872.84s:  be getting involved in cryptocurrency. There's no other reason for him to respond to this other than that.
881.40s:  This is essentially a way to make a public statement. Now, again, what that actually means,
889.00s:  I really don't know, because even if GameStop gets involved into Bitcoin, that still isn't a business
899.00s:  model. It's not. And for those that look at something like MicroStrategy, MicroStrategy is a
906.04s:  completely different beast that is effectively a Ponzi scheme. Because using that convertible debt
912.60s:  is soon as the stock price dips for some reason or another below some of those convertible rates,
919.00s:  the price levels that they would be converted at, they now have a massive problem. So it's kind
924.12s:  of holding a ticking time bomb. I know Sailor talks about it very eloquently in terms of intelligent
930.12s:  leverage. And he's not wrong. Sailor knows all about that stuff. He knows more about that stuff than
935.16s:  I do. There's no doubt in my mind about it. But there's also the reality of what these convertible
942.84s:  debt, what these convertible securities are. And so anyways, I make that point clear because for
950.12s:  people that are looking at MicroStrategy and saying, oh, Bitcoin can do what they do. It's a terrible
956.20s:  idea. Sooner or later, MicroStrategy is going to reap what they sell. It's just a matter of how long
961.56s:  and who makes enough money on other funds as they come in. I genuinely hope GameStop would not go
968.84s:  that route because I still think that they have the potential to make a meaningful change in their
976.60s:  business model, which is effectively what has to happen here. I think that that is the case.
982.28s:  So that's the latest as far as I see it with GameStop. It's kind of not a whole lot new.
987.24s:  Like that's really what that amounts to in my opinion. There's not like a ton of stuff that I'm
991.80s:  seeing. It doesn't have earnings until the middle of this month. So we still have a little ways to go
997.96s:  before earnings will kick off for GameStop. I don't know if you guys agree with that. I don't know
1002.68s:  if you're seeing something different than what I'm seeing. But in general, that's kind of the
1008.04s:  broad opinion that I have. I think that there's a little bit of buzz around cryptocurrency. And I'm not
1015.24s:  saying I think it's bad if they got involved in cryptocurrency. I think it could be fine, depending
1018.52s:  on how much they use and what the game plan is. I'm not inherently against that. But I just don't
1022.92s:  I don't think that's enough. Like that's just a piece of a puzzle. But the company still has to
1031.16s:  be a company. Still has to be a business. And it still has to drive revenue. Because a lot of
1037.56s:  people forget that if you get involved in something like Bitcoin, which can be completely okay,
1042.44s:  I have trades on in cryptocurrency for sure. But if you get involved in Bitcoin, you also are involved
1049.80s:  in this, right? Which is your balance sheet cratering from the start of the year effectively,
1058.92s:  where the beginning of the year, it's essentially hovering right around 99.5. And now it's at
1064.84s:  84.830. That's a pretty big unwind of your assets, just because you're holding something that
1071.40s:  is incredibly volatile. So again, not against it at all. But I do think we have to look at it with
1078.44s:  not rose colored glasses and do our best as objective thinkers and to conclude what the impact
1086.36s:  could be of doing something like that. And if you do that with a meaningful part of their cash,
1093.40s:  right? So say they're sitting on five billion, say they put in three billion in a Bitcoin,
1097.64s:  you might be super stoked on that. Well, if they're actually going to try to use that five billion
1102.20s:  to reinvent the business to reinvest in itself, maybe to acquire a business and you're eyeballing
1107.56s:  something. And then you're expecting to be able to use that money to acquire a business. But then
1112.84s:  all of a sudden, you're buying power just collapses because of where spot Bitcoin is,
1120.44s:  that's a tough fucking scenario to do business in. And I mean, the reality is I can't imagine the
1127.08s:  world where they would actually get involved with Bitcoin using money that they might have earmarked
1135.32s:  for a transaction because of how volatile it is. I just I couldn't see the logic behind that. I
1141.48s:  don't think they would do that just functionally doesn't make sense. Lauren says I don't see them
1147.08s:  buying crypto alone as a business strategy moving forward. That doesn't make sense to me, but Rc is
1151.72s:  up to something. I just have no idea what it is. I think that's fair. And I also think a lot of us
1157.24s:  absolutely hope Cohen is up to something. And right now it is based primarily on hope. Like let's
1164.76s:  again, also keep it, keep it a buck. There's nothing that we're seeing right now in terms of
1170.60s:  tangible information that lets us know that we are working on something or what we are working on.
1177.64s:  And I actually don't think there's anything wrong with having an inherent level of trust for
1182.44s:  the CEO and their vision for the company. Now sooner or later, we need to see it, right? Because
1189.72s:  trust isn't something in this context that's just extended into perpetuity with nothing to show
1196.76s:  for it. But right now, I think most of us, myself included, are giving Cohen plenty of grace
1207.16s:  and extending that trust to him because I mean, I personally think he's, I really do think he's
1212.68s:  very smart. And I think that he knows what he wants to do. I imagine he has a pretty firm game
1220.44s:  plan in terms of what he would attempt to do. Now it's just a function of do the conditions,
1225.32s:  present themselves for him to be able to do what he might be thinking of. But the other
1230.12s:  reality is that they have been sitting on this five billion for a little while now. This isn't
1238.44s:  something that like just cropped up. So as time goes on, I do think the pressure starts to
1246.68s:  present itself a little bit more. Whereas it's like, okay, what is the actual plan? Because we
1255.24s:  have been sitting on this cash for a while and would like to see it materialized. But until that
1261.16s:  point, it's essentially a function of trust. Just trusting Cohen that he has an idea of what he
1265.96s:  wants to do. The conditions probably are not right for it yet. And once they are, I imagine we'll
1270.60s:  hear something. At least that's the way that I typically look at it. Apex says, if you wait a
1275.56s:  few weeks, he will likely get a great price for Bitcoin. You're absolutely correct, though,
1279.48s:  at some point a business model needs to arise. Yeah, well, and that's the thing, right? Is
1284.20s:  the nature of holding Bitcoin, I completely agree with you. Even if you started getting into
1289.08s:  Bitcoin now, I think over a long term timeframe, I think what you get Bitcoin for now is probably
1295.72s:  good, right? Like if we're talking a long enough time horizon, I think even if you top ticked it
1300.04s:  at 100,000 before the drop, if we're talking about a five year horizon, I still imagine that's
1305.96s:  probably a pretty good price compared to what it'll be at some point in the future. But exactly
1311.24s:  to reiterate that point, if you get it now at a great price, but then it takes five years for
1316.92s:  it to really show a return on that price even three years, that's a long time to hold the currency
1326.12s:  as a business and really not have a whole lot to show for it. So I think even if it gets into
1334.36s:  Bitcoin, again, like that's cool, but unless they're going to do something to monetize the actual
1340.92s:  Bitcoin holdings, that point just holding a volatile asset, which is okay, right? Like there,
1349.16s:  again, there's nothing inherently wrong with it, but that's not a business model. That's just
1352.84s:  holding a volatile asset on the balance sheet until you decide what you want to do with the rest
1360.36s:  of the capital, which is what I think most of us, at least for me, like that's what I'm very keen
1366.20s:  to get a better understanding of. And I do believe when the time is appropriate,
1373.08s:  I do think we'll see it, right? I do think that he'll start communicating more around it. At
1378.36s:  least that's my hope. My last helium says, I hope he doesn't invest in Bitcoin. Yeah, and it
1386.04s:  definitely is a mixed bag, right? Like there are definitely people like that. I don't blame him
1389.88s:  because again, if one of the best things I saw in one of the videos is the one of my videos
1396.60s:  talking about this similar thing and it genuinely is my exact same opinion. And it was a person
1404.20s:  that commented they were like, if I wanted Bitcoin, I would buy Bitcoin. Right? Like that's not why
1409.72s:  people are buying GameStop. People aren't buying GameStop to buy Bitcoin. When you buy GameStop,
1415.56s:  you're buying a completely different business model than that. But
1421.08s:  Lauren says, I hope there's a bit more guidance next earnings, but he's not known for that.
1424.52s:  To be completely honest, I naively thought that we would have gotten more guidance in the last
1431.96s:  earnings release. And the fact that we didn't there leads me to believe that the previous guidance
1438.52s:  that you heard is probably going to be the same guidance going forward. Because it's not like that
1442.92s:  they raised the money and just said nothing. Right? If we go through the earnings transcripts,
1447.48s:  they absolutely have talked a little bit about what they're loosely looking to do. So let's take
1455.24s:  a look really quick.
1472.92s:  Lauren, are you going to find something really quick?
1495.88s:  No, not here. Okay. I was trying to find there was a couple things that I saw not too long ago.
1502.44s:  It's last earnings release. Obviously was essentially pretty sparse. It was just about the
1508.44s:  actual performance of the company. There wasn't a lot of forward looking guidance in it.
1512.68s:  And that's like that's the fucking tricky part here. If you go through their earnings release,
1518.04s:  when you go through their actual investor relations, filings here, you typically,
1525.24s:  let me give you another example.
1532.92s:  A typical earnings release.
1541.24s:  Where is it?
1548.12s:  Oh, I don't want to.
1553.00s:  Yes.
1553.56s:  So for a comparison, if you take a look, a normal company, when they report their earnings,
1563.56s:  they essentially have a press release. They typically have a call. And it's during these things
1572.92s:  that you get a sense of what the company is about, what the company is thinking, what they're
1579.00s:  actually doing. There's some qualitative elements around the earnings release.
1585.88s:  If you look at GameStop by comparison, this is what GameStop gives you.
1595.00s:  Which again, objectively is trash. Like this is for an investor, for a standard investor,
1602.52s:  this is not what I want to see. Like what I want to see is the actual company talking
1608.44s:  about what they're doing, what they're planning. And GameStop notoriously does not really provide
1615.96s:  that. GameStop is a lot more quiet. They kind of move behind closed doors. And there could be
1627.32s:  a reason for that. Now, my hope is again, that we would see a little bit of a differing perspective.
1635.32s:  Like you can get, I don't know if this will work.
1643.32s:  Let's see, because this is the closest thing that we got to something like that.
1656.44s:  This, anyways, I can't click into it because it's not. They don't have the recording there.
1661.24s:  But you can, that's where you can get a little bit of that qualitative information about the
1666.76s:  company. So, do keep, I says GameStop is trash. Actually, don't agree with that. I think GameStop
1674.36s:  is a really interesting company. I think, I mean, objectively speaking, they're not the best
1680.44s:  performing company out there by far. It's not like a controversial statement that is exactly what
1686.68s:  this. But I also think that it's the kind of company that does have the potential
1692.68s:  to have a pretty strong turnaround. And that kind of strong turnaround can
1701.88s:  things like this can drive tremendous amounts of value if the turnaround is done well.
1709.88s:  And that's kind of the cool part, I think, is that, and that's more for like the value side of
1715.72s:  things for the near term side of things a lot of is the volatility. Like the entire, the implied
1721.08s:  volatility percentile right now for GameStop is 23%. The implied volatility out right is 87%.
1728.44s:  So, what that shows you is that with implied volatility as high as 87% and the implied volatility
1734.36s:  percentile is low is 23%. Supervolta. Which from an option trading perspective is actually
1744.28s:  really attractive. Lawrence says, I believe our C's mentor did the same preferred news to come
1750.28s:  out via legal filings. Is that the case? Because it wouldn't surprise me. Like this does have,
1757.56s:  and also did he, I didn't follow Chewie. Did he have a similar, because that would be interesting
1763.72s:  to be honest. If he had the same, if he had like the same approach with something like Chewie as
1769.16s:  well, where, well, let's see if we can find their old, the old statements. That would be kind of
1773.56s:  interesting to me. We used to have to find some of Chewie's old statements.
1793.88s:  Okay.
1799.88s:  So obviously their new stuff, they have press releases and stuff.
1809.80s:  But let's go back. When was
1811.40s:  this co-in the CEO?
1826.76s:  2018. So 2011 to 2018. So let's go back.
1832.92s:  Damn. Haters. That's annoying. I would have liked to have seen if he maintained the same
1841.72s:  this same thing, but this only lets us go back to 2020. Companies regularly do this because they
1848.12s:  try to shelter themselves a little bit. But you can see they just started earnings presentations.
1857.32s:  Used to just be press releases and the financial docs. So that's for even Chewie. So yeah,
1866.44s:  I mean, there's a really good chance that they probably had a similar approach.
1873.32s:  ApexS GameStop has potential. I haven't touched it in quite a while in all honesty,
1877.24s:  but I think if they integrated somehow with like, meta or something, you know, yeah, I agree.
1881.56s:  And that's kind of the cool part about GameStop is that they have a really captive base.
1889.40s:  And again, like I'm always super straightforward with you guys. GameStop is a very small part of
1897.00s:  my portfolio. And it's because like I trade for a living. It's how I make money. So I need to trade
1905.88s:  things that I can consistently move around and find really good opportunities relative to the risk
1912.84s:  that I'm taking with GameStop. I really am more I more participate out of respect for the
1922.04s:  the ape community more than anything. And because like trading GameStop is fine, but like there's
1929.40s:  plenty of things I can trade that move very similarly. But none of this stuff also is like the same
1935.80s:  story and the same characters, including people like the cat who we haven't seen from in a hot
1941.88s:  minute. But he's also always just a wild card that's very fun to just see how he interacts with
1950.44s:  stuff. You just you just don't know, which is very entertaining. All right, we don't have a whole
1955.16s:  lot of time left. So I want to click into this and let's see what we got. So we read the son never
1963.16s:  sits on Citadel port one last time. That's where we left off. So now we were in three July of 2021
1968.12s:  reading part two. And let's see. So they're correcting. I need to apologize. Oh shit.
1977.24s:  I runeously said Citadel was a market maker across EU and part one. I found conflicting sources
1983.72s:  in Citadel is a market maker in Ireland, but I should have clarified. Yeah, okay, got it. Okay,
1989.80s:  so I'm gonna try to zoom this in. Can I zoom this in? No, I forgot it doesn't let me zoom in slightly.
1998.44s:  Okay, so we're on the GameStop price artificial thing. Citadel being a massive play in the market,
2012.04s:  which fun fact, fun fact, Ken was at Trump's cabinet meeting. So the I'm not bringing that up,
2022.92s:  because I know people are all over the place politically couldn't possibly care less.
2027.48s:  Just saying regardless of who the president is, or that person to be meaning Ken, to be in a cabinet
2035.16s:  meeting with whoever the president is, is telling that they're obviously at the highest echelons of power
2043.40s:  within the US. Ben says, is GME like the white whale of options world? No, not really. I don't think so.
2055.32s:  I mean, I honestly think most like the vast majority of actual options trader know very little
2060.36s:  about GameStop. And it's because like in options trading, there's just there's so many things to do.
2067.96s:  And most like full-time options traders just move between opportunities as they exist.
2074.44s:  So like the reality is the vast majority of options traders don't know a whole lot about the majority
2079.96s:  of the companies that we trade, because we know most of the information is gonna be baked into the
2085.48s:  options chain. Now there will be certain companies that are just you know larger than life,
2091.88s:  so to speak. And GameStop is one of them because I have a good friend that I met through
2099.64s:  another friend who runs like ETF funds. And then I met this other friend through the ETF guy
2108.76s:  that is a market maker. And he's worked at most of the large institutions and then he's opened
2114.76s:  up his own shop. And I regularly just hit him up to bullshit with him. He's a little bit older,
2120.28s:  but he has a insane amount of experience of making markets. And then also being an institutional
2127.32s:  prop firm style of options trading. And he also does options portfolio solutions for other kinds
2135.72s:  of portfolios like you know that are external to his fund that help streamline because one of the
2140.92s:  main uses for options is actually hedging risk and kind of providing that keel of a ship.
2147.40s:  So I speak with people like him about this stuff. And like he's generally familiar with GameStop
2155.24s:  because of the just insane fervor that we went through back in 21 and then also you know more
2161.24s:  recently in May of last year. But beyond that he's not like plugged into all the nit-noying new
2167.88s:  ones details of it. It's just not really what would appeal to them. They're again mostly looking
2175.16s:  for opportunities and moving in and out through things. I am very much an anomaly in that case
2181.08s:  with the level of interest that GameStop has spurred in me for a lot of different reasons.
2188.68s:  And yeah, I mean as you get like obviously I spend a lot of time on this shit. And it's not because
2194.68s:  this is the best place for me to spend my time to make money. Like I know that. I willingly know
2199.64s:  that and I don't care. I'm just interested in it. It's like a fun side project for me. And
2205.56s:  it also I've said this a million times, but it helps me learn a lot about market plumbing,
2210.84s:  which is again for most options traders not really that important. Objectively speaking,
2216.36s:  it's just not that important. But it's interesting to me. I have an obsessive personality over things
2223.40s:  and GameStop has become a very curious vector for me to learn a lot about the market which I enjoy.
2229.72s:  Lauren says I like that when they integrated card grading. They moved quickly as a company to
2237.08s:  implement it completely agree. And that's the cool part, right? Is when they do find something
2242.60s:  that they like it they they they make moves son, which is cool. So that's why I think Cohen does
2250.04s:  have other tricks in the bag because he's clearly doing things throughout the path as they make
2255.64s:  sense on the way. Yeah, completely agree. It picks as I've not traded options, you look for a lot
2261.24s:  of things. I know that. Is it true that you try to build into a position while volatility is lower
2268.12s:  along with the thousand other things? Not inherently no. Yeah, no, definitely not. It is entirely
2275.40s:  relative. Valtility being high or low is simply an input into the model of what am I trying to
2283.80s:  accomplish with a position? It's not volatility is low need to build positions because you can
2288.92s:  also build positions when volatility is high that either capture the movement subsequent or try to
2295.08s:  capture the collapse of volatility. There's a ton of shit that you can do. So I would I would offer
2303.32s:  it's much less of a volatility is low build a position. It's much more of a volatility is low.
2308.92s:  How does that factor into the trade that I'm trying to put on like that kind of thing?
2316.76s:  Okay, while Wall Street bets take over as costs the shorts and estimated 30 billion that's awesome.
2322.44s:  There's also been a monster payday for Wall Street's market makers and the free trading platforms
2327.24s:  they pay off. Back at the envelope we are looking at about 350 million in trading costs just for
2333.00s:  the four main stocks target it. Yep, that's exactly correct. And this is also why very frequently
2340.68s:  people I think misunderstand the intentions of market makers. I think a lot of people think that
2348.44s:  market makers have like these absolutely terrible terrible I don't know like like incentives and intent
2360.28s:  towards other entities and traders like it just I don't really see that more broadly. Now again,
2370.04s:  as always that doesn't mean market makers wouldn't attempt to take advantage where they could. Of
2374.84s:  course they would because it is a for profit thing. But I always feel like if you understand the
2380.68s:  motivations of people and in just accept what they are you can have a healthier relationship with
2386.36s:  them. It's kind of like these people that think that that have a pet tiger that the fucking tiger
2391.24s:  is their friend. The tiger is their friend as long as you fed them and keep them happy and you
2396.04s:  understand that that tiger is a fucking predator. And as long as you interact with it understanding
2402.04s:  its intentions you can be fine with the tiger. But if the tiger starts to get kind of hungry
2407.32s:  and there's no food around and you're not doing a good job taking care of it a fucking tiger will
2412.52s:  eat you. So it's kind of like the same thing with market makers. They think that in general their
2417.48s:  incentives are very clear like the way that they're making money in this case is right here.
2423.00s:  You see what's this average spread percent they're making money off the spreads. And that's why
2430.76s:  they might have an opinion in terms of directions sometimes and they might absolutely try to
2435.56s:  influence price movement if they can here and there. But it's not like the market makers are
2440.76s:  just behind the scenes like pulling these strings making stock a go up and stock b go down.
2446.84s:  It just the market is a little bit too large to work that way. And that's what it's kind of a
2452.76s:  good thing. But there can be pockets where there's price manipulation and I do believe there are
2458.52s:  clear instances that we can see it in something like GameStop. So again sometimes when I talk about
2464.60s:  this stuff people take binary positions and then they misinterpret what I say because I
2470.76s:  operate very much within the gray scale of things if this is an absolute left and right.
2475.96s:  I typically find to the best of my analysis what the gray scale is. Whereas most people they'll
2482.36s:  say exactly stuff like this right. If you go to the front it says the price of GMIs artificial.
2488.60s:  It's like it's not artificial. It can have manipulated elements. It can have misreportings at times.
2495.32s:  But to just blanket sweep say at all times now GameStop prices artificial.
2502.76s:  It just it doesn't really make sense. And I think people in general would be better off if they
2510.28s:  step away from like the binary evaluation of things and say well you know the market's completely rigged.
2518.84s:  That's not like they're absolutely our disadvantages and they're absolutely our periods where the
2524.36s:  market might be rigged in certain ways. I think a great example of that is naked shorting. What the
2529.64s:  fuck is naked shorting? That shouldn't be a thing. There should never be a case where a stock
2535.24s:  can have over a hundred percent of its fucking float shorted. It just doesn't make sense.
2542.76s:  But that aside and even though that fuckery is a foot it doesn't mean that everything everywhere
2549.96s:  is now all of a sudden manipulated and you can't trust anything and it's all bullshit.
2555.00s:  Again, there's a gray scale here. Just because this one thing exists that absolutely should not
2560.52s:  exist does not mean everything else is a facade in this bullshit.
2568.76s:  Naked shorting shouldn't exist though. That's fucking ridiculous.
2573.64s:  All right, let's continue. So market makers made an estimated bunch of money.
2581.16s:  We know that the market makers also took the full income of the shares they sold since they
2585.56s:  were selling pledge shares they never delivered completely agreed and that that is bullshit.
2590.44s:  This should not be a thing. The fail to deliver mechanism especially as it pertains to market
2596.76s:  makers is complete and utter fucking bullshit. The ability to use locates as shares that's literally
2606.04s:  like me going to the casino losing $200,000 and then being like, yo, this piece of paper I owe you
2616.20s:  will work, right? Like this is good enough. Same, same. We're chill. I know the fuck it's not.
2623.32s:  So yeah, completely agree with that point. That's fucking crazy. Absolute bullshit.
2629.08s:  This illustrates how the market makers generate off of any volume. They do this with nearly any
2633.88s:  security or transaction. They make a market for it. Yeah, I mean, that's correct. Again,
2638.76s:  like going back the other direction, that's the point of market makers is they provide liquidity
2645.88s:  and then they're compensated to provide the liquidity. So yeah, I think that this is correct.
2650.68s:  So the same activities that empower apes to create the moass also provide market makers with more
2657.00s:  resources to prolong the arrival of moass. This is actually inaccurate. It's not correct
2663.88s:  because they're essentially saying that what would prevent moass in this case or slow moass is
2671.00s:  the amount of money that a market maker has and that's really not it. The thing that leads to
2678.04s:  moass is a constrained underlying, meaning it's not readily available. And then you have the
2685.96s:  confluence of a short squeeze coalescing with the gamma squeeze. Like that's what leads to at
2693.40s:  least the nearest thing that I can conceive of with respect to moass. I know that they probably have
2698.60s:  a very specific version of moass in their brain. And the difference is is that I find most of the
2705.40s:  people that hypothesize about moass from the game stop community, I find it to be way more from a
2710.84s:  theoretical perspective. People saying like, oh, this stock is going to 100,000 per share.
2716.20s:  And I mean, theoretically, I'm not even in a position to argue that one way or the other,
2720.36s:  because like I genuinely don't understand the economics of it in that capacity. I don't know.
2724.20s:  But what I do know is it's not going there. And the reason why it's not going there is because
2729.64s:  during the last squeeze, the main squeeze, when they turn off the fucking buy button,
2734.60s:  they stepped in front of it market forces institutional forces. And again, I actually don't even,
2740.12s:  I don't fully disagree with it. Because although it would be really cool to see hedge funds that are
2747.40s:  naked shorting something get blown up. And I actually, I'm completely in favor of that.
2752.60s:  I'm not super jazzed on the entire financial system, potentially collapsing or the entire
2758.04s:  market potentially collapsing because of this little black hole that forms. So I think it's fine
2766.20s:  to let the companies go insolvent that should go insolvent. But the broader point is for the
2772.92s:  expectations of moass, that's a tricky one, because they've already stepped in front of it and
2777.80s:  stopped it. So I don't see a world where they would allow moass to go further in the future than
2784.76s:  what it did previously. Because they already said that there's a risk to the financial system here.
2791.32s:  And I don't see them now saying, yeah, the risk is less, let's just let it go to 100,000 and see how it
2796.60s:  goes. And you just don't see that scenario. So anyways, back to the original point, because it's not
2803.64s:  constrained by capital, that's why I don't agree with this, that I think that the market makers
2808.20s:  capacity to create resources and make money, that doesn't stop moass from happening in its form.
2815.24s:  What would stop moass from happening is from the stock being readily available and from short
2821.32s:  interest contracting massively. Because that loop is really what is required to then coalesce
2830.28s:  altogether to cause a significant short squeeze. There's plenty of short squeezes that occur.
2836.60s:  It's just nowhere near to the same magnitude that what you would have seen in GameStop. But
2843.00s:  anyways, let's continue. Volume is king. Once a firm hits critical massive transactions,
2847.24s:  becomes impossible not to deal with that firm. Yeah, I agree with this.
2854.44s:  That can grip from quotes took out to me, we manufacture money. Okay. I have a background in operations,
2862.52s:  manufacturing logistics. Okay. You can think of the financial industry as one that
2868.52s:  manufactures transactions in the same way the automotive manufacturers vehicles.
2874.28s:  Manufacturer transaction requires a buyer seller or product and is produced in a venue.
2884.20s:  The national supply comes from the collection of different factories.
2891.32s:  Okay. Just try not to understand their point. Your market maker and you already provide raw
2896.28s:  materials for the buyer seller and what would you do next if you wanted to grow? Okay. So they're
2901.08s:  just talking about how market makers or institutions are incentivized that expand their role in markets.
2909.48s:  That's what this essentially means. I don't know why my screen keeps doing that by the way.
2919.96s:  Okay. So they're just furthering their analogy.
2927.24s:  The buyer is interested in one thing, ease of access. I mean, that's literally completely wrong.
2936.52s:  This is completely wrong. What is a buyer interested in? If you go to a store and let's say,
2946.84s:  let's say you needed to grab a toothbrush and the toothbrush was the most easily accessible
2955.08s:  toothbrush in the entire store, you don't even have to get out of your car. They actually bring
2959.08s:  the toothbrush to you. But that toothbrush costs $500. Does the ease of access to that toothbrush
2973.80s:  overcome the cost of the toothbrush? And the answer is unequivocally no, it does not. So
2982.68s:  it's just a really important differentiating point for this corner three analogy of a buyer. A buyer
2989.32s:  is not interested in one thing being ease of access. If we were to talk about the one thing a buyer
2996.92s:  is interested, it's getting something at a good price to invert the example. Let's say that
3006.04s:  you could get a collector's item. And let's say it's a Pokemon card as a shout out in a salute to
3013.80s:  my boy, Richard Newton. And let's say that you go get this Pokemon card is super, super valuable.
3020.68s:  And it's being sold really cheap. Let's say the card is worth $10,000 and you can get it for 30
3026.76s:  bucks. Guess what happens? You don't really give much of a fuck what you got to do to go
3035.40s:  get that card. If you have to drive six hours to get it, you drive the six hours. If you have to
3041.40s:  get on a plane and go fly to get it, you'd get on a plane and go fly to get it provided that the
3045.64s:  cost of the flight accommodations and getting it when you get there is cheaper than the card itself.
3050.36s:  The point is value is what buyers care about. It's not ease of access. Now that's again,
3056.84s:  it's not binary. That's not to say people don't care about ease of access. They absolutely do.
3063.08s:  But if it's a choice between ease of access and value, value wins every fucking time without a doubt.
3071.32s:  Okay. Yeah, see he hits it here acceptable prices. That's the most important part. It's not
3078.44s:  just ease of access. Okay, we will continue.
3084.36s:  Volume is king. Citadel does so much volume that it's considered a securities wholesaler.
3089.40s:  Citadel is a massive network of sales connections through market maker presence at exchanges.
3093.40s:  Okay. Citadel has ease of access. Advantage. They absolutely do.
3101.24s:  Citadel has a privacy and pricing advantage. They do. I agree. So guess what Citadel wants to do.
3111.72s:  Citadel doesn't need a venue. Citadel the venue. Citadel is internalizing as substantial volume.
3117.96s:  Okay. So they're essentially talking about how Citadel is consuming more and more of the space,
3125.64s:  which I agree with. Citadel is moving beyond monopolizing the market maker role is captured a
3130.60s:  massive portion of all securities transactions is moving them off exchanges for an unisclosed portion
3135.32s:  of transactions. Citadel is the market. Yeah. Sort of. The moving
3146.68s:  moving volume off exchange isn't because of Citadel, by the way.
3150.92s:  Moving volume off exchange is from a buyer preference.
3156.68s:  And the reason why dark pools exist is to facilitate order flow. And one other really common
3165.80s:  misconception about dark pools is that dark pools still hit the consolidated tape. This stuff
3175.88s:  that is moved off exchange and does not hit the consolidated tape are things that are internalized.
3183.80s:  That won't hit the consolidated tape. Really important distinction in something I commonly
3189.32s:  see misunderstood. Now the point that this is really important is that the decision to move orders
3195.72s:  off exchange is really more so for larger institutions. That's why dark pools were invented.
3203.00s:  And it's because people can front run order flow. So then if I'm trying to put in a really big
3208.44s:  block order and I can see it getting chunked up because there's not enough liquidity at a certain
3213.56s:  price point, I can front run that order flow like a lot of other smart traders do me myself Eric.
3219.16s:  And there's institutions and high frequency trading firms that are poaching these orders
3223.48s:  essentially to front run the order flow because we know that there's a big order that's trying to
3227.16s:  get pushed through. So essentially we can buy into that and then buy into it here and then sell
3232.36s:  into that same order flow as it's moving up. So the point of dark pools is to prevent that kind
3237.72s:  of behavior which I do understand. But again, just an important differentiation.
3246.52s:  Citadel's overall volume market position are prohibitive to new competition and also drives
3251.80s:  way all but the largest competitors sort of. It's not prohibitive but it definitely is challenging
3262.76s:  like any large institution that becomes an incumbent like I do agree with that. It's like if you
3267.48s:  think of something like Amazon, really difficult to compete with Amazon if you're something else.
3274.04s:  Like that's not easy to do. So I do get it and I do agree with the general sentiment.
3282.68s:  Everyone in this room knew about naked shortings. Citadel primary culprit. Yep. Yep.
3293.32s:  Okay. Citadel's defaulting is the equivalent of the entire economy getting full blown aids
3298.12s:  and spinal cancer at the same time. Not getting out the immune system and functional response.
3302.84s:  This leaves market vulnerable to violent price swings that can instantly bankrupt other players.
3307.72s:  Which is why the DCCC is so concerned about member defaulting and transferring assets.
3314.20s:  And another reason why Moas is taking so long every player in the economy needs Citadel assets
3318.44s:  to remain intact stabilize. Yeah. Well, again, the other thing to remember it's it's it's why Moas
3326.92s:  in the form that I'm assuming this person thinks of it and is is overwhelmingly likely not going to
3333.48s:  happen. And it's again, the same intervention that happened during 2008 when things are so off
3342.60s:  sides. I mean, it even happened during the intervention during COVID, right? Like when when the market
3349.32s:  in general starts to see really large skew, one direction or another in terms of risk,
3356.20s:  they tend to step in to try to stabilize it. And it's because it's not worth the entire financial
3362.60s:  system or a segment of the financial system or so on and so forth to literally collapse. It's
3368.36s:  not it's not a commensurate value problem. So
3378.60s:  yeah. And then I think the next one on here is Dave Lauer. So I have to hop off. But I need to
3387.40s:  where is that I'm excited to look at Dave Lauer's. I actually was just talking with him last week.
3393.80s:  You know, we're bullshit in a little bit. And then I think we're doing a episode for Irvin next week.
3399.48s:  So yeah, looking forward to connecting with him again.
3406.20s:  I think one of the things I might do when we continue going through this honestly is
3411.88s:  I think it could be kind of cool to sort this the other way too. Because a lot of these are
3417.64s:  different versions of themselves. Really, what's the latest version that was uploaded?
3423.48s:  23 really? What happened? Apes? What the fuck?
3431.72s:  17 April 23. We haven't been active in two years on making these things.
3439.32s:  The fuck. That's bullshit. I like these. These are fun.
3445.16s:  You know, you all got to get to work. Talk to talk to some friends. Whoever fucking does these things.
3451.08s:  This is cool as shit. I don't even know how to do this. Like make these magazines and stuff. It's cool as fuck.
3459.00s:  Damn. Y'all got me depressed. I thought that I'd at least up until like 24.
3469.32s:  Damn. That's how she goes sometimes.
3472.52s:  Any questions? Anything you guys want to hit before we wrap up?
3477.96s:  Apex says, we're the most shorts currently lying games. Stop in your opinion. Like where would it squeeze all time highs?
3486.44s:  Fucking a bro. Ain't that the fucking question? That's a great question.
3493.24s:  Fucking a though. I have no conceivable idea.
3497.48s:  My underlying instinct is if we look at a price of GameStop and we think of areas.
3507.40s:  Right? So the idea of shorting. Shorting can happen at a lot of places. Now GameStop was obviously
3517.72s:  heavily shorted during this period at lows, which is really dangerous. Then as it starts to peak and
3525.64s:  spike up, the shorts are starting to cover because this is dangerous. This is a hand grenade that
3533.48s:  is in the process of detonating and we have to try to throw it before it takes our hand off. Again,
3540.12s:  talking from the perspective of the shorts. But then as it returns back down to this level,
3545.64s:  you can cover. You can cover most of your risk and it's not really at a terrible loss because the
3552.68s:  other reality is it is insanely unlikely that they were short coming into this,
3561.56s:  buying into this and then did not have shorts coming through this. The very high probability is
3573.08s:  that they also would have profited massively from this down move, even though that the net impact
3578.36s:  of their position could be detrimental because of the overall shorts that they held coming into
3583.40s:  it and had to cover through it. So all of that aside, I don't think shorts right now,
3593.00s:  one, I don't think they're in a really dangerous spot because the stock is readily available.
3598.28s:  The stock is everywhere. One of the things that made this such a unique circumstance and why it
3604.52s:  ran the way it did is because at this point, GameStop was starting to be completely locked up.
3612.20s:  The float was small and with such a small float with the majority of it being locked up,
3617.96s:  it makes the stock itself very, very difficult to get in order to close positions if you're short.
3625.08s:  Not so much the case anymore. So there are plenty of shares around for people to close out
3631.64s:  positions. And the thing is, is that anybody that has these massive open short positions,
3637.32s:  I guarantee you they're hedging around it with options and derivatives. There's no reason for
3643.00s:  them not to guarantee you that they're doing that. So it's not like they're going to be eating just
3649.00s:  taking it the shots in the face with the movement against them and just kind of like grip in the
3657.16s:  wheel holding it works out. Like institutions are sophisticated. They're not like retail traders when
3662.84s:  something goes against us. We just kind of like hold, hold out for hope. Like hope is not a strategy
3670.60s:  for professional traders. Hope can be there. Like it's nice to have it, but that's not a fucking strategy.
3677.32s:  So the reality is to summarize that random meandering of thoughts. I would imagine the shorts are
3685.08s:  a lot of different places. I do not imagine there are many shorts that got top ticked. I do not
3690.68s:  have meaning that kind of bottom tick. Like I don't think that there's going to be a ton of shorts
3694.28s:  down here. And if there were, they would have been closing out. So and that's part of the movement
3699.72s:  that we saw, by the way, in this case. And that's also why this movement didn't go as haywire as it
3705.08s:  did before is because I think they were much wiser to the game. This go around than this go around.
3713.16s:  So I imagine the shorts that exist now probably have hedges in place. And I think that they would
3721.00s:  continue to hedge and increase the ratio of their hedge if there is a big move against them. And I
3726.20s:  think that they have access to the underlying. So where they are, I'm not really sure, but I also
3731.16s:  don't think it matters that much. Ben says, is it not possible that they figured out the deal with
3738.68s:  GME and other, there could be a spike, but there would never be a push to all time highs again.
3742.44s:  Yeah, that absolutely could be the case. Absolutely. I think that it's, well, I think it's much
3749.16s:  more likely that GameStop would approach all time highs through a fundamental reinventing of the
3755.96s:  business than another short gamma squeeze combined. That's what I think.
3761.16s:  Dark Gen says think GameStop can hit 40s in the foreseeable future without big hype. Yeah,
3768.68s:  I think so. I do think it can get into the 40s. I think the, again, I think at least in my mind,
3775.96s:  most of the primary price movement that you're going to see in GameStop is going to be a reflection
3780.36s:  of the actual business, like the actual underlying business and the operation of the underlying
3785.32s:  business, which I don't think is a bad thing, right? Because to trade through shorts, which I do
3791.08s:  when they happen, it's very difficult. And the liquidity typically is a pretty big problem.
3798.04s:  So I think the company being in a position where it can actually reinvent itself and
3806.52s:  make fundamental changes and change its value that way. I think that that's good.
3813.96s:  And I think that it's highly, highly likely because that's what this whole move was here.
3819.80s:  This wasn't on a bunch of hype. This move up here that we saw to the low 30s. That was on
3825.08s:  fundamental value. And I think that you're likely to see this kind of movement again once the
3831.40s:  company starts to sort itself out. Because one of the things that I try to remind you guys in the
3838.20s:  use in my analysis is that after the company made its raises of capital, it then starts to beg the
3846.68s:  question, well, where's the floor? And how are we pricing the floor? And it's because they're in
3853.24s:  a better position now than they were here objectively. So then the real question becomes
3861.40s:  how do they use the money and then do investors see the future in terms of future cash flows
3869.40s:  of how they're going to use the money. That's the big question now. Because I'll be honest with you,
3874.44s:  if GameStop invests in some terrible business that everybody's like, oh, that fucking business is
3880.28s:  dying too, that doesn't bode well for the company. But if GameStop invests in something and they have
3885.88s:  a great direction that looks to be able to capitalize on its current assets, both tangible and
3894.52s:  intangible, then I think people start to say like, this company could turn around. And then that
3901.08s:  starts to lead to people taking speculative positions in the company, right? Because then it becomes
3906.52s:  from a value traders perspective, which is a lot of how big funds are going to operate long-term
3911.40s:  positions in this. The way that they look at this is from the context of risk to reward.
3916.20s:  If I think the floor in GameStop based on the breadth of my analysis, speaking from the lens of
3921.72s:  an institution, is 20 and a half, something like that. Because I think with the amount of cash that
3926.76s:  they have, the intellectual property and just the physical real estate blah, blah, blah, blah,
3931.24s:  I think it might be this, whatever it is. Then you start to say to yourself, well,
3936.44s:  if I get in here when it's 25, and I think the floor is 20 and a half and five points of risk,
3944.68s:  whereas based on the companies that it's investing in and how those companies are growing and the
3950.44s:  expectation of future cash flows, I think the company could be valued at $50.
3956.92s:  So then you're essentially taking five points of risk at a shot of 25 points of risk or reward,
3964.36s:  depending on the analysis and then the subsequent probabilities.
3968.12s:  That's why this concept of value is really important because traders, we come and we go,
3973.72s:  we're unfaithful as fuck, we're in, we're out, we're moving in between things trying to find money.
3979.48s:  The things that cause persistent price trends of things are new investors coming in and leaving
3985.80s:  their money in the company because they believe in the future. That's what has to happen here.
3990.20s:  And I do think that that's absolutely a potential because it already started to happen here,
3994.76s:  which is super cool. But you need earnings. You have to have earnings that are growing.
4002.12s:  And right now the company is struggling with that. But if you have a company that has growing,
4006.36s:  earnings, growing revenue, growing sales, that becomes really attractive to a lot of people,
4010.76s:  especially if it's at a good value. The entire thing we talked about earlier, the thing that
4017.80s:  investors and traders really care about value. If it's at a good value, then they'll absolutely
4024.60s:  start to speculate with it for sure. Just a good risk reward ratio. Ben says, I would figure they
4031.40s:  just dump shares that makes them rich. Who's they? It's not possible to figure it out, the deal with
4041.56s:  GameStop. I'm not sure who they is if you're talking like the funds and stuff. The thing to
4047.56s:  remember though, GameStop. You mean like the company? The GameStop is a business. They don't want
4056.36s:  to over-dilute. That's not good either. Lauren says, what's your opinion about institutions
4065.16s:  growing their position? I think it's good. Actually, we can take a quick look at a chart. Let's see.
4075.16s:  I want to see if I can find a natural. I like this better.
4098.12s:  Let's see. Yeah, you can take a look. A bunch of these are building their positions. Let's see
4111.96s:  what's decreasing. Vanack, Renaissance, closed the lot. JP Morgan closed a bit. Let's see
4121.96s:  you look at expanding. Yeah, they took a leverage position.
4136.28s:  The reality is I think institutional sponsorship is really important. Intracking institutional
4143.40s:  sponsorship is really important because this is effectively how the company is going to grow
4148.68s:  longer term. You can see that net movement is positive. Most people are extending and expanding
4157.80s:  their positions or holding them only 89, a small subset goes to close out. I think institutions
4164.68s:  building their positions is really important. Again, this is talking about the long-term viability
4170.20s:  of the company and the future of the company. That's the lens that I use for this and why I think
4175.16s:  that's the case. Yeah, that's exactly what I think. Pretty interesting. Yeah, I think it's
4183.72s:  I think expanding institutional ownership is good. That's what I think.
4190.52s:  All right, gang. Awesome hanging out. Got a bounce. Let me know if you need anything as
4196.20s:  always being outlier, being an ape. Be whatever makes it happy. See you all later.
