0.00s: What's up, outliers? Let's talk about option early exercise and or assignment. We're going to look at it from both sides of the perspective.
9.00s: And we want to talk about some really key themes. First, we're going to start with some common myths. Then we're going to talk about what early assignment or exercise actually is. Then we're going to talk about why it happens.
21.00s: We're going to talk about the process, how it functionally works. And then we're going to talk about how to manage early assignment risk both.
30.00s: We're buying and selling perspectives. Now this typically is more eventful for the seller side of the equation because sellers are the ones that are obligated to deliver and they're not really in the driver's seat meaning we don't get to decide if we're a seller when an option is exercised.
47.00s: It's different if you're a buyer. So let's first start with some common myths. And my goal for these common myths is I want to be able to very clearly articulate the answer to these at the end.
62.00s: So we're not going to answer them up front. I want to share these myths. And then at the end of the video, you should be able to answer these for yourself.
71.00s: So the first common myth is an option that falls in the money is likely or going to be exercised.
80.00s: So if we take a look at an options chain for an example, that means in something like this in VLO, it means that with the stock now trading at 139.63, these 139s are now in the money.
96.00s: So some people mistakenly believe that once these fall in the money, they are now going to be exercised and you will learn why that is a myth.
107.00s: The second common myth is all in the money options are exercised at expiration. This is another myth and we'll talk about that.
119.00s: So first, let's circle now to what is early assignment. That's really really straightforward. So early assignment is when a long option holder chooses to exercise their option.
134.00s: And the short option holder is now required to deliver on their obligation, which is different. If you are short calls, it means that you have to let go shares, meaning you have to sell somebody shares.
149.00s: And if you're short put, it means you need to take on shares. You have to buy somebody's shares.
155.00s: So there's a really key difference between American and European style options. American options can be exercised at any point or any reason. Now very frequently it doesn't make sense to exercise your option, which I will explain why with an example in just a few moments, but keep that in the back of your mind.
177.00s: With that being said, European style options can only be exercised at expiration. So there's this wild card aspect to American style options, meaning you can be paired with a holder that decides to randomly exercise their options just because they want to.
195.00s: Now, from a seller's perspective, it doesn't really matter because there can be scenarios where a buyer might choose to exercise and it can leave you with a profitable position as a seller, but it can still occur.
207.00s: So early assignment is simply when we have a buyer that chooses to exercise their option before expiration for a few different reasons.
220.00s: So let's talk about some of those reasons right now. The first one is if we have an option that is exceedingly low extrinsic value, specifically options that are in the money, they are at risk of early exercise.
236.00s: And the other scenario specific to call options is if there's a call option that has a dividend coming up that has little extrinsic value, specifically less extrinsic value than the upcoming dividend, those options are at high risk of early assignment.
257.00s: So let's take a look at that dividend scenario. We have VLO right here and VLO is trading for 139.63 and let's say we have these 129 calls, let's say we sold these 129 calls.
272.00s: Well, these 129 calls are in deep risk of early exercise and I will show you why because you can see that VLO does have a dividend and the dividend amount is $1.13 and the ex dividend date is the 30th of January, which is coming up.
291.00s: So here's what happens. The person that bought that option is saying to themselves, well, I can exercise this option. That means I'm going to buy 100 shares or however many contracts they have of VLO at 129 when it's trading at 139.
310.00s: So they're going to get it much cheaper than what it's currently at, which is great. That's the intrinsic value. And then they might say, well, I don't want to give up the extrinsic value, but if we actually take a look at how much extrinsic value is in these options, we can do the math.
328.00s: So we can say these 129s, they're essentially $10.63 ish in the money. So let's say that these are trading for 1090 and the midpoint. And if we take that $10.90, that's the price midpoint of these options and we take out the intrinsic value.
349.00s: And again, the intrinsic value in the scenario is $10.63. Well, if you take 1063 away from 1090, it leaves you with 27 cents. That means that 27 cents is less than the dividend of a $1.13.
366.00s: So in this scenario, the holder of that option actually will make more money if they exercise hold through X dividend and give up that remaining extrinsic value.
382.00s: Now, I want to make clear this idea of giving up the extrinsic value. And I want to talk about why early exercise doesn't happen too frequently and it has everything to do with X, transic value. So let's look at an example.
398.00s: We have VLO above my head. You don't really have to see the options chain, but I want to walk you through a couple transactions here.
405.00s: So let's say in another scenario that we chose to buy to open one of the 135 calls. And let's say that we got it for $7. I'm just picking a number. It doesn't really matter.
417.00s: Let's look at two scenarios in scenario one. We decide that we want to exercise this option. So our options in the money, right? If we bought to open the 135 and the stock is at 139, our options in the money.
432.00s: But if we choose to exercise, let's take a look at what happens. We're going to buy to open 100 shares at our basis of 135.
442.00s: And then we're going to sell to close in order to realize the profit, the 100 shares at 139, 63, which is the spot price.
451.00s: So at face value, this is a profitable transaction. What's the problem? The problem is if we take a look at what we paid for the option and actually in this case, what the option is currently worth.
465.00s: If we look at what we paid for the option, the premium $7, we also have to factor that into the equation.
472.00s: So that means we would be able to sell the shares at 139. We take out what we paid 135. And we also have to take away what we paid for the option because we're giving that up. We're exercising. So the extra the value of the option just goes away.
487.00s: So in this scenario, you lose $237. However, if we look at a slightly different scenario, where instead of exercising, we instead sell to close the option at spot price, which is right now 875 or so.
504.00s: Now we're literally just transacting with the option. There's no movement of the underlying. So we get to sell the option for 875 that we bought for $7 that gives us $175 profit.
519.00s: So this is an example of how early exercise can literally take a winning position and turn it into a losing position because of giving up the extrinsic value.
531.00s: So that's going to be a big part of what you have to keep in mind as we continue to move through these examples.
538.00s: So how does it work? Well, from a functional perspective, options that are in the money are typically going to be auto exercised by the broker only at
547.00s: expiration. If it's before expiration, the holder has to manually choose to exercise them.
558.00s: And a lot of times your broker might even reach out to you and say, hey, if you exercise these, it doesn't make sense.
563.00s: You're going to lose money just like the example that I sent you. But again, the holder always has the choice. It's their choice.
570.00s: So here, as we just reviewed, they can pick to even though it very likely is suboptimal in most circumstances.
580.00s: And then from the last perspective, if the long holder does choose to exercise, they're going to be randomly paired with a short from the other side of that trade.
591.00s: And then whoever is short on the other side of the trade has to complete their side of the bargain.
597.00s: So how do we manage early assignment risk? Well, for sellers, it's really simple.
603.00s: We have to monitor positions with really low extrinsic value, especially if their short calls with a dividend coming up.
609.00s: And if we want to maintain exposure to a position, we would roll the options out in time to gain more extrinsic value or just close the position.
617.00s: And then from a buyer perspective, you just need to make sure that you're assessing how much extrinsic value you're giving up and what you get in compensation for that.
627.00s: So for example, if you're long a put and you want to exercise it, there is essentially very few scenarios where it would be profitable to do so from an early exercise perspective versus just trading the option outright.
640.00s: But let's go back to the seller perspective and let's take a look at this scenario.
645.00s: So let's say that you same scenarios we were looking up before the 129s, we have a dividend coming up that's a dollar 13 and let's say that you still want to be short VLO for whatever reason.
655.00s: But you know that you're at risk of early assignment. What can we do here? Well, again, we know that this option is trading for 1090 and we know that there's only about 23 cents of extrinsic value.
665.00s: And for those that don't know, there's a quick way you can assess extrinsic value of an option and it's by looking at the corresponding out of the money option.
674.00s: So if we're looking at in the money call, we would look at the out of the money put and you can see it's close. It's not exactly correct, but it's close. It's just a back of the napkin way to do it.
683.00s: And if you're looking at it in the money put, you would look at the corresponding out of the money call. Just for a quick eyeball of extrinsic value.
691.00s: A lot of platforms let you put it up here as well or you can always just do the math, take the intrinsic value out.
696.00s: So 1090 is what this is currently trading at and we know again, there's very little extrinsic value.
703.00s: So if we chose to close these at 1090 and let's say that we rolled them out 54 days.
710.00s: First we can see where can we get $10.90? We can get them here at the 130s and still get a credit.
718.00s: But most importantly, take a look at the extrinsic value of these options. These options are $9 in the money.
726.00s: There is at least $3 of extrinsic value.
732.00s: $3 of extrinsic value is more than the upcoming dividend.
737.00s: These options would be at very little risk of early assignment because it financially doesn't make sense to do so.
744.00s: So the way that we pay attention to it is by monitoring for things like that.
749.00s: Now one other admin note is that it's not relegated to just calls that have a dividend coming up.
756.00s: If you have an option that's really deep in the money, it can be exercised specifically if extrinsic value starts to dwindle pretty significantly.
767.00s: What does that look like? I would generally consider if an option is trading for a nickel or less at a fair risk of early assignment.
774.00s: It's also relative to how much the underlying costs.
779.00s: But if you're looking at something that's one penny, two pennies, that's a pretty high risk of early assignment for multitude of different reasons that you have to be aware of.
788.00s: But avoiding it is really simple in general if you just pay attention, but you can't always completely avoid it because if you sell options, the holder can choose to exercise at any point for any reason.
800.00s: You now know why options that fall in the money are more often than not, not going to be exercised. It doesn't make sense.
809.00s: And then the second scenario is all in the money options at expiration are automatically exercised by the broker typically, but a holder can still choose to say, I don't want to exercise it.
822.00s: Now that would be a giant mistake if you take it all the way in the expiration and do that because then you lose both intrinsic and extrinsic value. That's not a good scenario to be in, but it's not always the case.
836.00s: So the way to think about this is in general options are unlikely to be exercised higher probability scenarios that if you're holding short calls that are in the money where the extrinsic value is less than the upcoming dividend.
849.00s: Any option that is trading for a nickel or less is at a moderate risk of early assignment. If you manage all of those factors from a seller's perspective, you can slide away from the majority of early assignments, still not all of them because it could still happen from a buyer's perspective.
865.00s: You just need to assess the value of extrinsic that you're giving up and decide why you're doing that if there is an actual rational reason to do so if not, then typically it's better to just trade the option.
879.00s: As always, if there's any questions, let me know, be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
