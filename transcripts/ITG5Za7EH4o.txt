0.00s: the best option strategy for busy traders.
3.64s: I went through a pretty significant portion of my trade and career on active duty in the
7.40s: Marine Corps, which as you probably can guess meant that I had very little control over
11.16s: my schedule.
12.16s: Yet I still traded for those six and a half years on active duty and it's by doing a lot
16.68s: of this.
17.68s: So I want to walk you through the strategy that I used and then I want to specifically
22.28s: get into details on how we can structure it so that it is super simple but still effective.
27.56s: What's up everybody?
28.56s: Eric here.
29.56s: We'll come back to all the outliers.
30.56s: Let's talk about trading some options.
31.56s: Okay.
32.56s: So the very first thing like I already discussed is the concept for this trade is we are
37.00s: willingly sacrificing optimization for simplicity.
41.76s: And what I mean by that is once you set up this strategy, which does take time after hours,
46.88s: you can literally deploy it within 60 seconds of having access to a computer for whatever
52.96s: the trading period is that you choose, which is the next bullet point here that it is
57.32s: flexible.
58.32s: So you can choose something as far out as six hundred eighty days plus or you could select
65.12s: something that's in the weeklies or something that's eleven days out.
69.36s: So you can select a time frame that fits your trading opportunity.
73.88s: What I will tell you is we want to try and keep them within 60 days.
78.32s: That's our typical window that we're looking for and I'll explain why.
82.40s: And in case you couldn't tell from the preamble here, the strategy we're going to be talking
87.36s: about is the coverage triangle.
89.92s: So the very first thing I want to follow up with there is I'll throw a link in the video
94.24s: description below on how I trade the coverage triangle in depth because this is going to
98.72s: be a surface level overview.
100.96s: This is going to be way more of me telling what I think works best for me and less of
106.60s: the optimization aspect, which takes a lot more time because there are different ways
110.64s: I would trade the coverage triangle if I had more time in front of a computer.
114.24s: But this video is not for that circumstance.
116.76s: It's for the one we're talking about the business people.
118.60s: Alright, so what does this look like?
120.44s: We need to select a ticker up front.
122.16s: Again, I'm not going to go into scanning, screening, picking the best tickers.
126.36s: We're keeping it simple here.
127.64s: So for me, I would pick anything that you already like for buy and hold.
132.52s: So if you have a typical buy and hold portfolio that you're looking to optimize or enhance
137.52s: just a little bit through options, this is really the kind of product that I would be
141.46s: selecting.
142.46s: So for me, I used index ETFs, IWM, anybody that follows the channel knows that I trade
147.16s: IWM a lot and there's a handful of reasons for that.
150.04s: I'll link to that in the video description below as well.
153.24s: But I also would venture into individual tickers.
155.80s: I have a few on right now actually today is too fed and I have the coverage triangle on
161.88s: in Tesla and Amazon.
163.64s: So I stfizer.
164.64s: I still trade it in individual tickers as well.
167.08s: I'll explain that in a minute.
168.08s: But really, we just need something that has options.
169.76s: You're not going to be interacting with it super much unless you choose to.
181.20s: So liquidity becomes less important.
183.48s: Most of the trades are going to be taken to expiration.
185.56s: So you're not worried about a ton of adjustments.
187.68s: When we're talking about selecting the option, there are a few criteria that are important
192.76s: to us.
193.76s: I already mentioned the days to expiration.
195.36s: The reason why I like to keep them within 45 days is multiple fold.
200.20s: The first one is if you take a look on a relative basis.
204.04s: So let's say this 45 day trade, this is using TD Ameritrade's on demand feature by the
209.24s: way.
210.24s: So this is back in time.
211.24s: Really right now we're looking at the market on four March 2019 because I want to walk
215.36s: through an example with you all.
216.64s: So anyways, just so that this stuff is going to look different than what it is today because
220.36s: this is back in time.
221.36s: So anyways, back in March, if we pick something that's 45 days out and let's call it a 30
226.52s: delta, this 151, you're going to get $1.94.
230.00s: If we look at something that's 32 days out at that same 30 delta, it's a dollar and 62
235.92s: cents.
236.92s: So you can see that there's really kind of an incremental loss and time value as we
241.32s: come further and further in.
242.88s: The real difference is you're moving slightly closer and closer to the money.
245.88s: So what's the point here?
247.08s: Data decay accelerates the most once it gets within that 60 day window.
251.08s: So it's important for us to try to take advantage of that when we can.
254.48s: However, there were plenty of periods of time where I traded cover strangles that were
258.48s: out 90 days plus because I was at a training exercise.
261.32s: It wasn't a choice.
262.32s: So it's not an optimal outlay, but it's as good as I could get and that happens.
266.16s: The other thing to keep in mind is once you go beyond this 45 days, notice what happens
269.68s: to the expiration.
270.68s: So we have something we have weak lease here, then we go to monthleas and quarterleas.
274.96s: As you go further out in time, liquidity in just the number of options, chains available
279.36s: to us changes.
280.36s: So the short answer here when it comes to DTE and Delta and strike for days expiration
285.12s: for both the short put and short call, I'm going to be looking ideally 60 days in typically
290.04s: somewhere between 20 and 30 or I'm sorry, 20 and 40 or Delta and strike on the short put.
296.04s: It's going to be something between a 15 and a 35 delta more often than not.
300.24s: The reason why I select those is to capitalize on the variance risk premiums.
304.28s: There are slight differences based on the expiration, but we're keeping it simple.
308.32s: So anything between there is fine.
309.88s: And the strike price, I'm talking about this more specifically for the short calls.
314.20s: I'm less concerned with the Delta on the short calls once the trade is on because once
318.32s: we have the short calls against long stock, I'm not really using Delta to select my strike.
324.32s: I'm using the strike price against whatever my basis is, which I'll show you the beginning
329.24s: of an example, which we'll get into later, but let's say if I buy 100 shares of or 200
334.60s: shares of IWM at $100 and I sell a one, I'm picking this 105 call based on the relationship
342.68s: to my basis here.
344.00s: I'm not picking it because it's a whatever Delta.
346.40s: The main thing is I don't want to have upside risk.
349.28s: So I'm going to avoid selling short calls below my basis because they just turn into a problem
354.72s: more often than not.
355.72s: Again, we want this handspray relatively easy.
358.60s: The overall way that this strategy can roll out is once you refine it, literally you put
363.68s: the trade on, you come back after expiration, you see what happened, and then you adjust.
368.84s: That is it.
369.84s: So that's why I select the Delta's and the strike prices based on that.
373.76s: We'll talk about management in just a second.
375.72s: I want to talk about some of these optional components.
378.00s: So like I said, we are prioritizing simplicity.
380.40s: When I'm laying out here is probably one of the absolute simplest versions of this strategy
384.88s: that we can have.
385.88s: But if you have a little bit of time, you can start layering in just a little more detail.
392.56s: It's a little more time consuming, but it can have really significant impacts on our profitability
397.16s: and the strategy.
398.16s: So for example, we can integrate things like using moving averages, linear regression
401.56s: channels.
402.56s: So to follow that example through, if I pop over to the chart and I say, okay, I see
407.24s: the 150 day in the 50 day, these are really the more important moving averages again for
412.00s: a simpler strategy for me.
413.80s: I, as you can tell, I use four moving averages because in my day to day, normally I have
418.68s: more time I can do this.
419.96s: So I am a little more specific on what I like.
423.16s: But in this case, again, keeping it simple, I would use 50 150.
426.84s: If the underlying specifically falls below the 50, I come to a pause, meaning I may not
432.36s: add more risks.
433.36s: If it falls below the 150 or 200, I would consider either flattening or waiting to add
439.24s: risk until the 50 flat ends out.
442.60s: So if we follow that move here, so we have the 50 that's trending, it fell below the
446.92s: 50.
447.92s: So right now, let's just pretend we were now paused, whatever position we have on were
451.08s: paused.
452.08s: And then price falls below the 150.
454.00s: Now I'm not really wanting to add risk until I see the 50 flatten out.
458.52s: And as you notice, it's not flattening out, it's not flattening out.
461.12s: And then in here, it starts to flatten out.
462.76s: So a couple of things happen.
463.84s: You're going to have some risk on for this move unless you flattened, which is a choice.
467.20s: But it essentially keeps you from getting ran over on the way down.
470.60s: Now, we didn't bottom ticket.
472.64s: What I mean by that is we hit the low and you miss out on this move from 125 81 all the
478.20s: way back up essentially to 140.
480.72s: That is the lack of specificity, but that's why it's so simple.
485.28s: There's a trade off here.
486.40s: We're picking very simple moving average protocols, but there's going to be a little bit
491.28s: of delay in when they, when they trigger the other thing is linear regression channels.
494.76s: So one of the things I like to do is in the same exact example, I would integrate once
499.44s: it starts getting below a minus one and especially a minus two linear regression channel, I probably
506.44s: would add a little bit of risk and the way that I modulate that risk is through scaling.
512.24s: And I'll talk about that in a second, but you can use technical analysis just like that
516.12s: in really, really simple ways to help optimize the performance with just a little extra time
521.32s: added or you could say, I don't have time for that.
524.08s: And that's also fine.
525.08s: It will still work just fine.
526.28s: And then the last one is rolling.
530.40s: You can choose to roll options.
531.80s: I have plenty of videos on that where you could choose not to.
534.36s: It really doesn't matter, but that is another way you can optimize the profitability of
538.72s: these trades.
539.72s: I just rolled a trade recently to increase my overall profit potential by a few hundred
544.56s: dollars.
545.56s: I have the time, so I did it, but you don't have to if you don't have the time.
548.08s: Let's talk about how this actually looks, the management.
550.72s: So we talked about identifying the ticker that we like, right?
553.76s: So we have that.
554.76s: We're going to sell a cash secured put.
556.12s: There's two scenarios that happen.
557.92s: Either you get a sign on that cash secured put or you do not.
561.32s: That's it.
562.32s: If you don't get assigned, you can just sell another cash secured put.
564.60s: If you do get assigned, there's now two more choices available to us.
568.08s: We can sell an additional cash secured put if we want to add more risk or we can sell
573.52s: an uncovered call provided we can sell that short call above our basis.
577.40s: You know what you're saying?
578.40s: Eric, why uncovered?
580.08s: It's because we don't want to cap our upside potential.
583.72s: So our P&L graph of a normal covered call will have a flat top at some point when your
589.32s: long shares are equal to the short shares tied into the short call.
593.88s: By doing an uncovered call, our upside looks like this.
597.80s: It remains an upward slope.
599.48s: It means that we don't have a max profit potential on the trade.
602.80s: It's unlimited.
603.80s: When you're using a hands-off strategy, not capping your upside is very, very important.
609.44s: This is such an important detail that a lot of people miss because they'll say, well,
613.52s: covered calls, they don't keep pace with the market.
615.72s: What the hell?
616.72s: They can if you're smart about it.
618.72s: And this is one of those details that makes a big difference.
620.92s: And then on that uncovered call, if you're assigned, it just means you're going to sell
624.08s: the shares at that price.
625.48s: And then you just go back to selling cash secure puts.
627.64s: If you're not assigned, you can choose to continue selling uncovered calls.
631.32s: You may get to a point where you can't collect enough premium in order to, or I'm sorry,
636.48s: you might not be able to sell a short call that gives you really any premium that's above
641.04s: your basis.
642.04s: In that case, that's when selling additional coverage, cash secure puts, or buying additional
646.28s: shares to reduce your average basis is really useful.
649.28s: Okay, last thing I want to talk about are these couple scenarios.
652.96s: And then I want to give you an example.
654.32s: So in these scenarios, if the stock lands between your strikes, meaning the short call
658.24s: and short put, you just keep doing what you're doing.
660.24s: You just reload, come on back.
661.56s: If the stock is above your short call, you're going to lose the shares, go back to selling
665.64s: more short puts to get the risk back out there.
667.84s: If the stock is below your short put, you're going to buy additional shares at that strike
672.20s: price, keeping the premium.
673.64s: That's it.
674.64s: That's how this whole thing works.
675.64s: So this is one of the best possible ways to optimize a buy and hold portfolio.
679.84s: So let's take a look at an example here.
681.56s: Let's say we have a hundred thousand dollar account, IWM's training around a hundred bucks.
684.96s: We decide to include some scaling.
687.04s: I think it's a really smooth way to make sure that you have room to adjust your basis if
691.68s: we're in a prolonged down move.
693.16s: So or examples, some scaling protocols you might consider, you could have an initial
697.48s: outlay of 70% and then you can have whatever scaling details you want on the way down, but
702.56s: the main thing is the initial.
703.84s: So what this means is on this one hundred thousand dollars account, you can use up to 70%
709.36s: on your first trade.
710.96s: That's if we are greater than 20% away from all time highs in the underlying.
715.96s: Why do I select this?
717.36s: It's because the propensity when we're near all time highs is you have much farther to
721.56s: move down than when you're near all time lows.
724.32s: But this is important to remember using the moving averages is part of this thought process
729.28s: because something that is decreasing can keep on decreasing for a long time before it
733.92s: slows down.
734.92s: So you don't want to run out of money too fast.
736.52s: So the other thing you could do is if we're not greater than 20% off of all time highs,
740.64s: your initial trade is up to 50%.
742.40s: So that means you can use up to 50,000 dollars on your initial trade.
745.16s: Okay, great.
746.16s: That's just an idea.
747.16s: I have slightly different variations.
748.16s: I've used this in different market environments based on volatility, but this is just a, again,
752.72s: very simple back of the napkin.
754.16s: Here's an idea.
755.16s: Let's talk about the outlay here.
756.16s: So on the initial trade, we're going to buy 200 shares at $100, 20K.
759.20s: Then we're going to sell to open two of the 95 puts at a dollar.
762.92s: So we're going to collect 200 bucks and then we're going to wrap up another 19K.
766.40s: Essentially, we're just taking whatever the cash security amount is for this.
770.32s: That gives us that $200 credit.
771.88s: Then I'm going to sell one one oh five call.
774.72s: The reason why it's only one is because we have 200 shares and I want uncap profit potential.
779.80s: So I'm going to only do one.
781.80s: There's a trade off here.
782.80s: The more short calls I sell up run, the more money I get, the lower my future profit potential.
788.24s: The other thing, the closer my short call strike is to my actual basis, the more money I'm
794.36s: going to collect up front, but the less total profit potential the trade will have.
797.84s: You got to pick whatever's right for you.
799.28s: The next thing is that'll bring in a dollar.
801.76s: So it's a $100 credit.
802.76s: So overall, I brought in $300 in total credit on the initial outlay of $39,000.
809.12s: And then we have the profit potential for another $500 in capital gains.
812.80s: So overall, you're looking at about a 2% return on your money in a month.
817.12s: Now that's 2% on 39.
819.28s: So what do we do with the remaining money that's not being tied up in the trade?
823.48s: So we have $61,000 that's tied to this that we're not using.
826.72s: You have some choices.
827.72s: You could use more of it.
828.72s: If again, if you're a typical buy and hold investor, you're using most of it anyways.
833.60s: Because if you're a buy and hold investor, you have to buy the stock and that's all the
837.72s: capital being outlaid.
839.04s: So it's same, same.
840.52s: The other thing you could do is if you have the time, you can set up box spreads.
844.08s: You can use box spreads on the remaining $61,000 in this scenario to earn the risk-free rate
849.44s: while the rest of it's being used.
850.80s: There are lots of ways to structure this, but the name of the game is keeping it simple.
854.12s: You should be able to log in to the platform.
855.92s: You should place your trades.
856.96s: It takes less than 60 seconds straight up.
858.64s: You come back not midweek, not mid month after expiration.
862.72s: If it's set up like this, it doesn't matter what happens.
866.16s: You just come back to see what happened so that you can make the necessary next steps
870.28s: in the strategy.
871.28s: If you want to be a little more involved, that's when we look at things like having more
874.96s: detailed scaling protocols based on volatility off of all time highs, moving averages,
879.72s: technical analysis, things like that.
881.20s: You can also start integrating rolling to make sure that you're increasing your absolute
885.44s: maximum profit potential.
887.16s: But all of that optimization starts to add a little bit of complexity here and there, which
890.72s: may or may not be for you.
892.12s: Overall, you don't need it.
893.36s: You can trade something just like this pretty effectively.
895.72s: I doubled this with my ratio leap diagonals and those are most of the strategies I trade
900.80s: while I was on active duty in the Marine Corps because I didn't have the time.
904.00s: So if you made it to the end, don't forget like, subscribe, be an outlier, see you all
906.64s: later.
