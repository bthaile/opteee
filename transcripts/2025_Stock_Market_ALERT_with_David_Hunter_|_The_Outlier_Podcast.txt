2.20s: what's up outliers welcome back to the
4.44s: outlier podcast I have David Hunter back
6.44s: I think this is like episode six or I
8.32s: don't even know anymore we've we've uh
10.40s: connected pretty much every quarter like
12.24s: pretty consistently for a couple years
13.76s: now and I would love first to just start
18.32s: with a quick recap of 24 because when we
21.64s: connected in the beginning of 2024 you
24.00s: had an expectation of this really strong
26.40s: rally the Melt up and then leading
29.40s: eventually into to the global bus and
31.16s: originally we were thinking that that
32.92s: might be happening towards the tail end
35.04s: of last year obviously circumstances
37.72s: continue to change that's actually a
39.04s: follow-up question I have for you for a
40.88s: little bit but I would love to just get
43.44s: an an overview from you on 2024 what
46.92s: were the key themes that stuck out to
49.44s: you yeah well certainly um yeah we had
53.24s: bought we had had a a pretty good
55.28s: correction going into the fall of of 23
58.36s: came out of that uh in October early
61.36s: November
62.68s: 23 um and it it took until I think
67.36s: February if I remember right before we
69.28s: started taking off uh maybe that was
71.84s: just the medals but um I had raised my
74.84s: target to 7,000 I think in January of
79.28s: 24 um and you know we had we had a run
84.56s: and we had a correction another run um
88.80s: and uh and then August hit and we had
92.32s: the the big probably the biggest story
94.20s: of of 24 was the Japanese Yen carry
98.76s: trade uh
100.80s: unwind and it didn't take very long but
103.64s: it was pretty pretty um sharp and scared
106.64s: a lot of people and had a lot of people
108.20s: turn bearish there and yet it bottomed
110.68s: in early August you know uh was almost a
114.40s: one day selloff there there was some
116.60s: weakness leading up to it but the
118.56s: biggest selloff was a one or two-day
120.44s: deal um and then we basically had a
125.20s: pretty good run into the election uh and
128.88s: the week after the election and and then
132.96s: um another kind of holiday run after
135.36s: Thanksgiving or into Thanksgiving and
137.32s: Beyond and then we thought we were gonna
140.20s: have urine rally and really from mid
142.68s: December and for the Russell early
145.32s: December we had topped and and corrected
148.20s: right into your end so
150.48s: um it surprised people I think a little
152.80s: because everybody assumed we'd have a
153.92s: urine rally but that's the market you
156.96s: know when everybody assume something
158.32s: you're gonna probably get the opposite
160.52s: um and you know we're we're starting off
163.40s: this year uh kind of choppy so it's what
167.04s: what has been amazing is it has rebuilt
169.32s: the wall of worry you know the it
172.44s: doesn't take a lot to have people they
175.32s: got they got on board because of what
177.40s: the market did in the fall when they saw
180.24s: you know the S&P go above 6,000 all a
183.52s: sudden you everybody rais it you know
185.44s: their numbers for 2025 they their year
188.68s: and 25 Wall Street strategist year and
191.72s: 25 estimates all jumped up uh you know
195.32s: 6500
197.12s: 6600 a couple of them were at 7,000 or
200.52s: 7,100 uh and this was from a crowd that
204.08s: you know a group of people who had
205.60s: fought the rally all the way up from
207.92s: 3500 you know they just didn't I think
209.96s: it had legs and it kept moving they were
213.04s: skeptical the whole way until you know
215.96s: really the last you
217.84s: know just leading into the election and
220.60s: Beyond um and and then just as we get
224.48s: there and they climb on board the bull
227.20s: bandwagon we get this correction um and
230.88s: I think you know for the S&P it was a
234.12s: less than 5% correction for the NASDAQ
237.40s: 6% or six and a half perc and for the
240.56s: Russell was over 10 but um it's amazing
245.12s: to see that once you lose that momentum
248.68s: and I had said this ahead of time yeah
250.60s: they're bullish but they're bullish
252.32s: without any conviction they're bullish
253.84s: because they're going with the momentum
255.36s: of the tape you lose that momentum and
257.96s: they're right back on the bear side or
259.64s: at least skeptical side and uh that's
262.44s: what you've seen here very
265.16s: recently and if you look if you look at
267.80s: individual sentiment because I just saw
270.32s: this number the Bulls are down to like
272.36s: 20 I think 24% and the Bears are up to
276.60s: 40% uh and that had been the opposite
279.92s: you know just a few weeks ago so it's
282.68s: amazing how quickly you know a little
285.36s: bit of a pullback can cause sentiment to
288.52s: change absolutely and it's one of the
291.12s: things I wanted to follow up there with
293.24s: is your original expectation of a melt
297.92s: up meaning a really sharp parabolic move
301.32s: up how does this change in sentiment
304.12s: feed into that because it does seem like
306.96s: things have stalled quite a lot and
309.16s: exactly to your point I actually found
310.80s: it generally interesting where
313.36s: essentially from December it just seemed
316.12s: like the market was kind of waiting for
317.72s: the shoe to drop which I surprised me a
319.92s: little bit because if we're expecting
323.20s: this really big rally right it seems
325.64s: like it would have to be supported by a
327.48s: ton of capital of some sort coming in so
331.32s: two questions there the first one is
333.32s: what do you think about the current Mark
336.48s: condition and how does that feed into
339.08s: the melt-up
340.56s: concept yeah well first of all just to
343.60s: kind of um clarify melt up and parabolic
347.24s: melt up are two different things so okay
349.24s: sorry the Melt up um we've really had a
352.04s: melt up you could argue depending on how
355.24s: wide you want to make the how wide
357.68s: perspective you want to have if you
359.16s: broaden the market out to 20 year charts
361.68s: you'd see the Market's pretty vertical
363.56s: from um 2022 from the lows in October
367.92s: 2022 to now some people think that was
371.24s: that whole thing that melt up but we did
373.36s: we did have a pretty long correction in
376.24s: the summer into the fall of
378.76s: 23 um and then bottomed in October 23 so
382.80s: I I really think the Melt up is from
386.12s: about October 23 until now is we're in
389.64s: the Melt up the parabolic part of the
392.32s: Melt up is that last stage into the top
397.80s: and uh I have thought it was starting uh
401.72s: I had thought it had started after the
403.64s: election I said at least possibly you
405.72s: know that 5% run in the week of the
407.88s: election look if it had sustained itself
410.60s: was the beginning of what I think we're
412.24s: going to see which is you know very fast
414.56s: steep run to the top but it's stalled
417.08s: out and we've kind of gone you know ways
420.08s: since so uh and sideways to down so um
425.28s: so that wasn't the beginning of the
426.76s: parabolic I think the parabolics just
429.08s: ahead of us and I you know I think you
432.24s: could cover 30% in the S&P in a matter
436.00s: of two or three months maybe it'll take
438.08s: longer maybe it'll take four or five but
440.24s: that's a lot of return in a hurry huge
443.92s: and um so that just to clarify those two
446.96s: then got it then uh if you could refresh
449.84s: my memory on your questions I'm curious
452.56s: how the current market Behavior feeds
454.92s: into that broader Theory yeah I I mean I
457.92s: view it as we're we're in that process
461.00s: you know we're we're so
463.00s: spoiled because we haven't had big
465.68s: pullbacks we're you know we're getting
467.36s: these four three two three four five
470.36s: percent pullbacks and those seem now to
474.56s: be big pullbacks they're not in you know
477.08s: his historically we just haven't had
479.56s: this kind of a straight up market so you
482.88s: know people are more conditioned to have
485.24s: seven or eight or 10% Corrections now if
488.00s: we get a a four or five percent
489.92s: correction people are saying what's
491.36s: wrong with the market I this is just the
493.96s: market refreshes itself you know it's a
495.88s: stair step process and each time it
498.48s: pulls back it causes sentiment bare
502.16s: sentiment to increase um obviously
505.20s: investors act on that sentiment a lot of
507.40s: the time so that means they're getting
509.80s: more defensive they're raising more cash
512.64s: it's it's
513.88s: rebuilding the skepticism that you need
516.96s: to keep going higher what you have to
519.56s: worry about is when sentiment gets so
521.32s: bullish that everybody's in agreement
523.56s: that this thing's going so much higher
525.96s: that means they've acted on that and
527.64s: you're already at the top so that's
529.92s: coming but we're not there at all
532.48s: now leads to an interesting follow on
535.40s: based on your comment around per ception
539.68s: around pullbacks and like severity what
542.28s: I find really interesting is on some of
544.76s: these exactly to your point lighter
546.64s: pullbacks were actually seeing the vix
549.16s: Spike not crazily but pretty
552.00s: meaningfully and what does that mean to
555.12s: you then is it like just broader
558.32s: institutional support of that theory
560.48s: where we've become so complacent where a
563.52s: 4% 5% pullback is seen as vix needs to
567.08s: go to 25 now because of this small small
570.52s: pullback which we typically wouldn't
572.36s: necessarily see to that degree yeah I
575.28s: can't remember when that last Spike was
577.56s: where the vix went up up above 30 I
579.96s: think or got to 30 um yeah it looks like
583.88s: that happened on the 18th of December
587.24s: and the vix hit a high of
589.68s: 2832 and then the last yeah and then the
592.52s: last time it was above 30 was during
594.48s: that August pullback where everything
596.32s: kind of rolled over a little bit Yeah
598.52s: the August one for sure was you know
600.96s: people panicked and that was you know
602.76s: people were so sure that we were heading
605.04s: straight down you had a lot of estimates
606.68s: of you know big
608.72s: drops they thought that was just the
610.64s: start of something much bigger a high of
614.00s: sorry I was just gonna throw out there
615.52s: vix hit a high of 65 intra day there
619.04s: yeah that and that's that's the sign of
622.00s: real Panic the one in December I can't
624.40s: even you know it's funny I can't even
626.40s: remember what it was that triggered the
629.76s: the pop uh there had to be some news
632.64s: event um but that coincided with or it
637.96s: came soon after the top of the market
640.56s: because the market to or or the market
643.08s: topped right around there because it was
645.80s: before um and I I can't remember what
649.36s: the news event was um do you remember I
654.16s: I can't it's funny yeah but there had to
657.16s: be something there yeah it's kind of it
659.72s: may have been it may have been the the
662.84s: Popp in interest
664.36s: rates um because interest rates had had
668.04s: gone up from
669.40s: 360 up to three uh to yeah to 420 or 430
676.52s: and then started come back down maybe
678.28s: even up to 440 started to come back down
681.64s: and then I think we might have gotten a
683.12s: bad CPI report or yeah that's what I
686.48s: think it was it was
688.00s: inflation and and that spooked to
690.84s: everybody and yields went from three you
694.04s: know they had come back down from 340 to
696.20s: I think 320 next thing you know they
698.36s: were at 360 on their way to 380 on the
701.48s: tenure so I think that was if I remember
704.44s: right that was what triggered it was
707.28s: Fe the the 18th was also the I'm pretty
710.52s: sure there was a Fed meeting around
711.68s: there a Fed announcement yeah and it was
714.60s: right in there yeah because the CPI may
716.16s: have come out just before that and then
718.68s: the amazing thing was Paul's press
720.92s: conference right I remember that being I
723.80s: remember that being so noteworthy I was
725.44s: just like the market is crashing on him
727.20s: essentially saying the same thing yeah
729.32s: he it was you know he basically telling
731.52s: you we we we um cut rates in September
735.64s: we cut again in November and December
738.24s: and we may have to sit for a little
740.24s: while and wait for the data to tell us
742.68s: what to do next I thought we knew that
745.28s: going in why is everybody panicking but
748.16s: that was yeah that was that was the
750.20s: story so again there's a case where
753.56s: right around there going into that you
756.60s: had was was when people were giving you
759.00s: their yearend 2025 numbers you know the
761.88s: strategists on the street are telling
763.76s: you about the next year and starting to
765.96s: give you the yearend numbers and so they
768.68s: had they had raised all their numbers
770.72s: right before that and which I guess is a
773.92s: sign that they were too comfortable you
777.48s: know had had gotten pretty bullish
780.44s: um like I said without conviction but
782.16s: they were bullish because the tape was
783.60s: up and and they just didn't have there
786.60s: was no resilience in the market for bad
788.52s: news and they interpreted whatever he
791.24s: said as a change and it wasn't really
793.48s: but um and and along with that was a
796.68s: narrative we were seeing in some of the
798.92s: data that the economy was better than
801.36s: expected was starting to show more
803.20s: resilience not rolling over you know and
806.72s: um and that inflation was ticking up
809.76s: so even though none of that concerned me
812.56s: it your concern the street leads to a
815.60s: follow on this is one that continues to
817.72s: confound me I just wrapped up my 18th
820.84s: year of trading which I mentioned to you
823.12s: because it's funnier than anything
824.68s: you've been in markets more than double
826.40s: that um but I find it so interesting
829.96s: because my my general expectation is
833.20s: that institutions are pretty smart they
835.20s: probably have people that are close to
837.16s: Powell in some capacity you know that
839.12s: they're probably hearing things being
840.40s: talked about here and there um not to go
843.00s: so far as inside our information
844.24s: necessarily but also probably not off
846.08s: the table it's just so surprising to me
848.92s: to see when the FED comes out and they
852.48s: essentially reiterate similar guidance
855.08s: to see the market shuck that hard and
858.00s: vixs fly that hard in my mind I'm like
861.32s: well I just I struggled to believe that
863.96s: institutions were caught that far off
866.80s: sides but like so what causes that from
869.96s: an underlying Market perspective you can
872.72s: probably understand this even better
874.24s: than I can being a Trader it's all about
877.52s: positioning in short-term sentiment and
879.96s: short shortterm positioning too I mean
882.28s: they're they're going in with and
885.12s: Traders are by definition more fickle
887.92s: right uh you know they're they can have
890.32s: one opinion one day and a totally
892.00s: different opinion the next day whereas
894.28s: my opinions haven't changed much in two
896.20s: years you know so um or maybe even five
899.96s: years but um so it's a lot of it is
904.44s: they're looking they're parsing every
906.04s: word they're looking at everything for
908.40s: any potential change and whether any of
911.48s: them want to admit it or not they're
913.96s: driven by the tape so if he had said the
917.48s: same thing and the tape had gone the
919.92s: other
921.36s: way that wouldn't have been anything
923.60s: they would look at it it's the
925.56s: combination of their positioning and
928.20s: what then soon begins to happen at the
930.32s: margin if it starts then they say oh you
933.08s: know his rhetoric seemingly is
934.92s: indicating we might be done with cuts
936.80s: for a while I gotta get out you know and
940.16s: and then once you drove yield so fast it
943.28s: spooked the market I see interesting now
947.84s: another thing I noticed with like
949.00s: near-term positioning to to follow along
950.92s: on that and continue putting you out of
952.68s: your comfort zone talking about
953.96s: short-term stuff I find it so
956.76s: interesting that it seems like the mark
958.96s: Market is digesting any sort of
961.96s: inflation level data and it seems like
964.76s: it's like hyper sensitive to the
967.44s: downside but it's not really showing
969.80s: that to the upside right like when we
971.84s: got the the slightly lighter CPI
974.08s: yesterday the market went up but it's
976.72s: not like flying up whereas it seems like
978.96s: if that came in a little hot the
981.08s: probability in my mind is that the
982.36s: market was probably going to show up a
984.36s: pretty big hand to the downside so what
986.56s: do you think about like that General um
989.04s: function right now as it sits yeah
990.64s: that's that's good Insight because I I
993.08s: do think it it's indicative of the
996.28s: nervousness that's still built into this
998.56s: Market it confirms for me it's certainly
1001.64s: not you know it's not where I spent most
1003.56s: of my I mean sentiment is important to
1005.76s: me but I don't spend a lot of time
1008.08s: trying to um analyze it day to day but
1011.36s: it certainly it does kind of confirm for
1015.52s: me
1017.36s: that people are
1019.36s: still one foot out one leg out the door
1021.72s: you know they they are they are more
1024.40s: comforted by the market having shown
1026.92s: resilience and they may talk a good game
1029.48s: about having higher numbers you know
1032.32s: higher
1033.64s: targets but they're scared as hell
1036.00s: they're wrong you know and so the
1038.64s: minute and for you know maybe I'm you
1042.08s: know not I don't want to overstate this
1044.44s: but I I was talking about a global bust
1047.56s: you know five or six years ago
1049.52s: saying not that it would happen right
1051.40s: then although it you know could have
1053.16s: happened a lot sooner than I we are now
1055.84s: but but I always said you know we'll
1057.76s: have a melt up in then global bus and I
1059.80s: Define that bus long ago and now you see
1062.76s: a lot more people using the term bus
1064.60s: that never did before um some misusing
1067.80s: it but some using it like I'm intending
1070.08s: that it's bigger than you know much
1072.04s: bigger than a normal
1073.64s: recession I think I planed to see in a
1077.04s: lot of people's heads and then others
1079.24s: that may be saying the same thing now or
1081.64s: doing too that there's this fear in the
1084.64s: in the market unlike you know going into
1088.20s: lots of our recessions they don't you
1090.36s: know we don't go into every recession
1091.80s: saying oh my God the Market's gonna you
1093.76s: know the economy is gonna blow up bigger
1095.60s: than it's ever blown up this is unusual
1097.84s: you know we had it in 20089 so that's
1100.00s: part of it is we have that fresh in our
1102.28s: mind but it's also because of the setup
1105.08s: because of the massive
1106.60s: leverage um you know my forecast been
1109.04s: out there for a long time that this
1111.08s: isn't going to be an ordinary downturn
1113.08s: that when it goes we can have the
1115.92s: biggest financial crisis in history we
1118.40s: can have some you know is one way to put
1120.56s: it we can have something bigger than
1122.04s: 20089 which another way to put it and
1124.68s: then I accompany that by saying we could
1127.04s: see an 80% bare Market biggest since
1130.84s: 1929 those things are out there and
1133.36s: again I'm not trying to take credit for
1134.96s: everything and saying I'm the only one
1136.32s: thinking that way but I was the first in
1140.12s: terms of thinking in those kind of
1141.64s: exaggerated terms who saw this cycle in
1144.76s: those kind of terms um I do think that's
1148.52s: in a lot more both institution and
1151.48s: Retail Minds than in previous cycles
1155.36s: that it's not only are we rolling over
1157.68s: are we going into a bare Market it's
1160.16s: they're scared to death that this could
1161.84s: be the big one you know and there may be
1164.68s: other reasons they're scared of that too
1167.12s: it's not just my you know the view I put
1169.76s: forth but but I do think that's in the
1172.16s: whether it's me or was other things I
1174.56s: think in the back of an awful lot of
1176.28s: Institutional Investor Minds is when
1179.24s: this goes g it's gonna it's gonna come
1182.04s: at us very fast and it's going to be
1183.56s: very steep so they don't want to be late
1186.12s: there's this real fear of being late
1188.76s: more so than in most
1190.80s: Cycles I see and given that fear and
1194.76s: then the implication then for kind of
1197.84s: near-term
1199.76s: positioning how does that then lead into
1203.04s: the Melt up because typically when I
1205.40s: think of the the actual melt up portion
1208.48s: of this where things start to get more
1210.24s: parabolic in nature at some point I I
1212.88s: continue to go back to like I'm curious
1214.76s: what the Catalyst then would be and it
1216.52s: looks like the next Fed rate cut isn't
1219.48s: really priced in until the summer it's
1221.60s: like June and it's only like just over
1223.80s: 50% so it's real real light at this
1225.96s: point so then I'm thinking that coming
1229.12s: up but not until summer so then does
1232.72s: that impact the timeline that you would
1234.48s: expect for this melt up or is there
1235.88s: another Catalyst that could contribute
1238.64s: here could be another Catalyst but I
1240.72s: don't even think it's another Catalyst I
1242.40s: think there that's that's that's the
1244.64s: narrative today that can change to the
1246.32s: narrative that causes this thing to go
1248.52s: in other words if people are if people
1250.64s: are now convinced that there's no Cuts
1252.68s: coming for six months um and if we get a
1256.72s: weak you know we start getting man
1258.68s: facturing certainly weak we got a very
1260.52s: weak um um you know the most recent New
1265.16s: York reading on you know Manufacturing
1268.28s: Index the manufacturing was very weak
1270.84s: right um if we start seeing weak data
1274.84s: you know ISM has still been negative
1278.20s: most the time it was a little stronger
1279.56s: recently but if we start getting
1282.24s: negative data again people are right
1284.28s: back on the side of a narrative that
1286.04s: says weak economy and if inflation I'm
1288.88s: here again again I don't know this but
1291.96s: um I saw something today where PCC pce
1294.92s: and people can take CPI and PPI
1298.44s: PPI I don't do it um but some of the
1301.24s: economists claim they can pretty much
1303.84s: give you what pce will be and there's
1305.96s: numbers out there of something under
1308.92s: 2% um you know maybe well under 2% I've
1312.20s: seen 1.9 I've seen even lower um if that
1317.24s: if people get convinced that inflation
1319.24s: is not ticking up but actually still
1322.20s: trending down and if the economy you
1325.32s: know data points start showing uh data
1328.00s: releases start showing the economy is
1330.80s: slowing more um I think you'll be right
1334.32s: back in The Narrative of you know we
1336.48s: could have three or four Cuts this year
1338.40s: you know it'll start with I see it'll
1340.68s: start with you know yeah those two cuts
1343.04s: look pretty pretty uh you know I'm
1346.16s: confident in two cuts again instead of
1348.28s: what you know there's starting to be
1349.64s: talk about no Cuts you know or even
1352.76s: people even though they don't think it's
1354.28s: high probability talking about the
1355.88s: possibility to Fed raising again I think
1358.28s: that's not going to happen um I think
1360.68s: we're likely to get four Cuts this year
1362.92s: I don't even you know number of cuts to
1365.40s: me is you know a game I don't I don't
1367.44s: worry about that but it is a it is part
1369.72s: of measuring a narrative which you know
1371.88s: where's a there two cuts the four
1374.24s: whatever but but personally I think the
1376.64s: bigger story is going to be
1379.00s: that this economy is going to slow
1380.60s: faster than people expect maybe maybe be
1383.72s: in recession much sooner than people
1385.80s: expect uh and then from there you know
1389.36s: see even worsening from that and and
1391.72s: that inflation is actually we may be
1394.08s: finally getting to the point where
1396.08s: because shelter was a net help this this
1400.20s: time around in terms of inflation lower
1402.64s: I think it came in below expectations we
1404.96s: may be finally at that point where
1406.56s: shelter starts going he starts you know
1409.68s: recognizing the weakness in shelter
1411.56s: because it was such a lagger that was
1413.56s: for a long time it was kind of propping
1415.32s: up numbers so I I think we may be at
1418.36s: that point where you get the opposite
1419.68s: where shelter's actually contributing to
1421.80s: the weakness in CPI and in um you know
1425.76s: inflation and you know I think you're
1429.64s: gonna you're gonna have to in other
1430.88s: words it's almost like you're gonna have
1432.08s: to win that your back uh for the markets
1435.24s: if if numbers are starting to come in
1436.96s: below expectation
1439.80s: really interesting so it's almost like
1441.88s: the the bad news becomes good news in a
1444.84s: way absolutely I I have said for a long
1448.12s: time I think the much more likely way we
1450.24s: get to a top is weakness in the economy
1453.56s: not strength um you know I I think
1457.08s: contrarian I think the likelihood is
1459.64s: that the this The Narrative that we have
1462.40s: as we move to the top is going to be we
1466.28s: softer economy I don't I don't mean it's
1468.96s: bust but softer economy maybe even
1472.20s: recession nearby um lower
1476.24s: inflation and fed ease you know fed is
1479.56s: back on the ease story and in fact maybe
1482.44s: the FED has to catch up now you know
1484.80s: because they they still are behind the
1486.36s: curve in terms of tightening and people
1488.48s: don't I don't even talk about it a lot
1490.80s: because it's hasn't happened yet but we
1493.60s: keep talking about fed ease in terms of
1495.92s: rates and this is a as long as I the FED
1498.92s: which is 50 years um that has been part
1502.76s: of how Wall Street sees things true ease
1506.40s: is the money supply is the fed's balance
1509.20s: sheet the fed's been tightening even now
1513.00s: they they've been shrinking in the
1514.08s: balance sheet so you know true ease is
1517.44s: when um they're printing money when
1520.16s: they're expanding their balance sheet
1521.60s: again we're not we're not seeing that at
1524.08s: all so the FED is still tight and
1526.60s: tightening um and yes rates have come
1529.72s: down but that's not ease although you
1532.56s: know in Wall Street language it's ease
1535.48s: but um it's it's really the rates are
1538.16s: following the market
1540.52s: down what do you make of the
1542.36s: relationship still between small cap and
1546.20s: large cap I thought it was noteworthy
1549.28s: seeing the Russell contract as heavily
1551.32s: as it did in December and as compared to
1554.28s: things like large cap which has started
1556.56s: at least a little bit maybe it's just a
1557.96s: releas rally it still looks like it's in
1559.64s: a downtrend again from a Trader
1561.36s: perspective but small Cap's kind of just
1564.08s: been hovering sideways here so I thought
1566.80s: the weakness there was just generally
1568.28s: noteworthy do you make anything of that
1570.88s: um I think it is noteworthy it's more of
1573.24s: the same in terms of what I said before
1575.48s: about um kind of um how positioning
1580.48s: leads to what you get it leads to a
1583.40s: correction um I think so many people
1587.20s: finally jumped on you know so many
1588.88s: people fought the Russell for a long
1590.32s: time and said the Russell's you know um
1594.24s: dog poop you know it looks yeah looks
1596.72s: like it's never gonna go again and I had
1599.04s: those questions on Twitter forever um
1601.92s: and then it all of a sudden lifted its
1603.44s: head and had that big run uh you know it
1606.40s: outperformed in the summer and then I
1608.88s: went to sleep underperformed all the way
1611.32s: into the election I think and then and
1614.00s: then it had that run after the election
1616.68s: where it um it double top you went to it
1619.60s: back to its all-time highs and then and
1622.36s: then kind of topped out in early
1624.08s: December and like I say corrected 10 or
1627.52s: 11% much more than the other indexes I
1630.96s: think that was because that
1633.96s: run uh first in the summer and then the
1637.68s: second one into early December had
1641.04s: people jumping on the bandwagon saying
1643.32s: yeah small caps are coming alive yeah
1645.72s: small cap and you heard you heard on you
1647.80s: know if listen to CNBC or anywhere you
1650.56s: heard portfolio managers coming out
1653.12s: talking up small caps saying yeah I
1655.80s: think the markets which which I've been
1657.72s: saying for a while is the market was
1659.20s: going to broaden down but you had more
1661.16s: and more people saying yeah with Trump
1662.84s: coming in it's going to be you know
1665.04s: better for the economy and uh better for
1667.80s: the domestics and that really favors
1669.76s: small cap um and all that so so you had
1674.72s: um kind of bullishness rise up for the
1677.80s: for the um increase for the Russell and
1681.44s: it just meant it's time it's time to put
1684.28s: those people in their place and get that
1685.76s: wall of worry back up because
1687.08s: everybody's jumped on that bullish small
1689.36s: cap bandwagon and that's that's what I
1691.84s: think it took was a bigger correction
1693.92s: and then I mean I saw in the last couple
1697.32s: weeks ah the Russell's awful what how
1700.16s: can you tell me the Russell's going to
1701.68s: 3300 there's no way you know that's that
1705.24s: that index should be you know taken out
1707.40s: and buried you know they really were
1710.16s: getting upset with it because it it
1712.12s: obviously had disappointed them so I I
1715.36s: see this as nothing other than that it's
1717.52s: more the the game with sentiment and
1720.12s: positioning and now it's starting to
1722.92s: come out of that hole you know three or
1724.64s: four days ago at bottom came it came
1727.48s: right down to the 200 day moving average
1729.96s: on Monday I think um and turned and I
1734.72s: think we've seen the bottom and I think
1737.72s: you know I think 3,300 is likely so it
1740.72s: it got below 2200 got down to 2160 I
1744.16s: think 2160 70
1747.52s: um yeah 21670 so 3,300 2200 to 3300 is
1754.52s: 50% so from there was basically a little
1757.56s: more than 50% that's what I think in
1760.72s: this parabolic that's what you're gonna
1762.92s: get if you can get 50% if the parabolic
1765.28s: truly is first half of this year whether
1768.68s: it's three months four months five
1770.28s: months I don't know but if you get that
1773.36s: and you get a 50% move in the Russell in
1775.48s: that time frame that's that's pretty
1778.60s: historic I
1780.12s: think yeah well especially if I think
1783.08s: again going back to your broader
1785.16s: comments around what would drive this
1787.32s: because it seems like we would need to
1789.28s: see economic data starting to show
1791.88s: weakness is that the main thing that you
1793.56s: would see for the Russell specifically
1795.52s: or does it follow the broader narrative
1797.60s: that you're talking talking about before
1799.24s: yeah it's basically for the whole Market
1801.08s: I think I think you're going to have
1802.96s: lower interest rates weaker dollar um
1807.44s: and you know of course the Russell is
1809.32s: also more financial so I think they will
1811.52s: benefit from all of that um and and so
1815.32s: will domestic and and and it's you know
1818.68s: I talk less about it because it's not
1820.12s: really the macro story but having Trump
1822.88s: come in as of next Monday and pushing a
1827.00s: pro capitalist
1828.92s: Pro US
1830.68s: policy is very much very much favors to
1834.76s: Russell I see literally beautiful segue
1838.04s: to so we saw an initial rally obviously
1842.84s: when Trump won the election itself do
1846.64s: you think that there's going to be a
1848.20s: sympathetic follow through when he
1850.28s: actually takes office or do you think a
1851.96s: lot of that stuff's already been priced
1853.48s: in based on the stuff he's been talking
1855.32s: about his policy expectations and stuff
1857.80s: like that I don't think it's priced in
1860.20s: because I think everybody kind of got
1861.88s: distracted by the yield curve you know
1864.64s: rates with rates moving up and the
1866.16s: dollar moving up people kind of got
1868.52s: caught up in the bearish side of the
1870.52s: story so I I think you had you had that
1874.16s: initial spurt right after the election
1875.80s: when he won um and then really you know
1879.76s: a little bit more into December but then
1881.80s: after that it's been all negative so not
1884.80s: because of him so much but more um more
1888.00s: focus on well there is there is a
1890.52s: narrative that has been a negative
1892.64s: Narrative of for Trump and that
1895.48s: regarding Trump and that was the idea
1898.60s: that tariffs are
1900.20s: inflationary the idea that his
1903.20s: policies um you know CBO and and um you
1907.04s: know various Wall Street economists are
1908.80s: all pushing this idea that you know he
1912.08s: relative happened before the election
1915.00s: you know IED against it back then but um
1917.72s: that
1918.80s: his policies were more um inflationary
1922.40s: and and would cause higher deficits than
1925.88s: Kos would and and certainly more than
1929.08s: Biden's and I disagree with all of that
1931.64s: the pro the problem is that most of
1934.80s: those that score these
1936.84s: policies um hate supply side economics
1939.64s: don't believe in supply side economics
1942.00s: do all of this stuff in a static model
1944.32s: meaning they don't give you any credit
1946.84s: for lower lower tax rates leading to
1949.52s: higher growth and higher growth leading
1952.04s: to higher tax revenues it's been proven
1954.64s: it was proven in the Reagan tax cuts it
1957.00s: was proven in the first Trump tax cuts
1959.32s: when you do large tax cuts across the
1962.16s: board like they did um it does boost the
1966.12s: economy all things being equal the
1968.28s: problem is you know at the end of the
1970.08s: Trump Administration all things weren't
1972.28s: equal we had a pandemic and so you know
1975.60s: we had the early stages of having to
1978.28s: Prime Pump and push all kinds of new
1980.84s: fiscal money out the door so so it kind
1984.40s: of short circuited what would have been
1986.60s: growing revenues and lower spending or
1989.16s: or not you know not bigger spending um
1992.36s: but the problem is in deficits is
1994.12s: spending our problem is not tax cuts if
1997.16s: you cut taxes you're going to get higher
1999.32s: revenues and so but partially because
2003.72s: they don't believe in them partially
2005.28s: because they don't you know partially
2007.40s: because I think a lot of these people
2009.24s: scoring have
2010.48s: TDS um you know I think the combination
2013.80s: of those two things you you end up with
2016.60s: assumptions that are I think very faulty
2019.56s: and so my belief is his his policies
2022.88s: will not lead to higher inflation will
2025.68s: not lead to bigger deficits that all
2029.12s: being said I do know my forecast which
2030.96s: is that we are going to have much higher
2033.48s: inflation after the bust because of the
2037.48s: you know the massive money that gets put
2039.20s: into the system not just here but around
2041.92s: the globe but that's not because of
2043.96s: trump policies so um so the initial
2047.24s: response I think um once he gets elected
2051.28s: is that you are going to get another you
2053.12s: know Big Boost to the
2055.28s: market do you think the conversations
2058.36s: he's having around increasing tariffs
2061.60s: with big trade Partners like Canada
2065.40s: Mexico also him trying to increase just
2070.48s: domestic production because you know all
2073.96s: this way better than I do but my
2076.32s: expectation of some of those policies
2078.40s: depending on how they're implemented in
2080.16s: my mind I was expecting short-term pain
2084.08s: that might lead to longer term relief
2088.08s: but it sounds like you're thinking when
2089.88s: you're talking about not being super
2091.68s: inflationary what what time frame is are
2095.16s: you using for that and then do you see
2097.12s: any short short term issues based on
2100.36s: some of those policies that would then
2101.84s: alleviate longer term or do you think
2103.28s: that there would be essentially none
2105.04s: right out of the gate yeah so so I have
2107.76s: to talk about reality versus you know
2111.52s: what what I think will happen in the
2112.96s: real world okay versus what I think the
2115.28s: narrative is going to be so in other
2118.08s: words Under My bust forecast it's not a
2122.08s: given it's my forecast right where I say
2125.04s: we're going to have the biggest um
2127.20s: downturn turn in the post World War II
2129.68s: era we're going to have the biggest
2131.32s: financial crisis maybe ever globally um
2135.88s: and leading to maybe 20 trillion in fed
2139.92s: expansion um and likewise proportionally
2143.12s: around the world that jump starts an
2145.56s: inflation cycle like no other you know
2147.44s: we'll see a uh we'll see 25 in my
2150.04s: opinion I've said this to you before
2151.88s: we'll see 25% inflation by early next
2154.80s: decade if I'm right about that um
2158.36s: so I'm not saying Trump isn't going to
2161.60s: be living you know that we're not going
2162.96s: to be seeing inflation the balance of
2165.32s: this decade I think we're gonna see
2167.20s: deflation first and the and the response
2170.04s: to that deflation is gonna cause
2171.72s: inflation but that's that's a macro
2174.96s: story that doesn't that's not anything
2177.16s: to do with Trump's policies so and we
2180.48s: don't know that that's going to happen
2182.00s: yet and if we're if we're going into a
2184.16s: period where we're going to have more of
2186.08s: a euphoric stage where everybody's
2187.92s: excited that Trump's policies are more
2190.56s: Pro capitalist more
2192.64s: progrowth um inflation's Coming Down The
2196.48s: Narrative of the next six months is
2198.64s: likely to be very bullish so they're not
2202.64s: going to be they're not gonna be focused
2204.56s: on because it won't even be evident at
2207.04s: that time they're not gonna be focused
2208.96s: on oh Global bust and a response to the
2212.68s: bus is going to be inflationary if if if
2216.60s: things start popping up that say Global
2218.68s: Bus the focus will be deflation right
2221.44s: not inflation I I you know step ahead
2225.20s: and talk about what happens in terms of
2228.00s: response and things that's not how the
2229.76s: street works you know the Street's going
2231.24s: to be focused first after the
2233.96s: inauguration on Trump's policies and um
2238.32s: those being positive for growth and
2242.28s: bullish for the stock market and then if
2247.04s: um they start seeing signs of bust
2250.12s: they're we focused on deflation which
2252.20s: means even lower rates which even means
2254.96s: even more fed EAS right so there's a
2257.88s: period here for the next three to six
2260.40s: months and I don't know whether it's
2261.76s: three four five six um where I think
2266.04s: most of the narrative is going to be
2268.52s: towards lower rates lower dollar lower
2272.12s: growth lower
2274.48s: inflation higher much higher stocks
2279.12s: somewhere in there whether it be April
2282.08s: May June I think it will will be in a
2286.08s: euphoric period where it will behoove
2289.32s: people to start looking past that
2291.88s: Euphoria to the fact that um there are
2296.88s: there are storm clouds on the horizon
2299.76s: that could come pretty fast meaning
2301.92s: Europe's starting to look like dog poop
2305.92s: you know um Canada's in trouble
2310.64s: economically um Asia's you know China's
2313.84s: struggling etc those those kind of
2316.00s: things could be out there by mid year uh
2319.24s: and and maybe our economies you know
2322.36s: moved into recession and as I say the
2325.52s: the reason I'm going for a bust is
2327.40s: because we've got massive leverage on
2330.20s: that system much bigger than
2332.76s: 20089 that's really the story of why it
2335.56s: turns a recession you know ordinary
2338.00s: recession it's something worse but the
2340.92s: first step is to get into that
2343.28s: recession I see now speaking of
2347.68s: different policy changes and
2349.16s: expectations what are your thoughts
2351.40s: around energy and metals what they might
2354.28s: look like kind of decoupled from the
2357.60s: Melt up and bust itself which is kind of
2360.16s: talking about the performance
2362.44s: expectations of energy and metals given
2365.16s: the the policy expectations then
2367.68s: obviously we can mold them together with
2369.68s: how they interact with the Melt up and
2371.24s: bus so so let's start with oil you oils
2374.20s: had this run from you know the mid-60s
2376.72s: to the high 70s in the last I don't know
2379.84s: what couple months um I think that run
2383.84s: should be over or very close to over um
2387.20s: it ticked down today but who knows um
2390.20s: I'm still of the belief that we're
2392.04s: heading for
2393.08s: 60 um It's Not Unusual to have a run you
2396.40s: know we came down from 130 back in 22
2400.48s: came all the way down to the
2402.36s: 60s and then back up into the 80s mid
2406.28s: 80s I think and then back down to the
2408.92s: you know mid 60s again and now up to the
2411.36s: high 70s I think it's part of that stair
2414.52s: step you know it plays out over many
2416.80s: months but it's it's what I think's
2418.72s: going on I think the next step is
2420.76s: another run down to even lower lowers
2423.36s: lows than the mid-60s so probably you
2425.48s: know 60 or high 50s
2428.12s: um and that coincides with the economy
2430.56s: getting softer as we move towards midye
2433.32s: again doesn't mean soft the next set of
2435.56s: data points I'm not trying to tell you
2437.60s: it happens in the next two weeks you
2439.36s: know or three weeks or four weeks but
2441.64s: over the course of this first half of
2443.72s: this year I think we're GNA see a softer
2445.48s: economy lower demand and of course
2447.72s: worldwide Germany's in negative GDP now
2450.96s: China is in deflation now um so you're
2455.08s: going to see worldwide demand for oil I
2457.04s: think continue to slip at the same time
2461.16s: Trump's coming in and talking about you
2464.60s: know drill baby drill right from day one
2468.84s: so how fast that all plays out I think
2471.76s: it's in it's in the narrative right away
2475.36s: that oil supply is going up and my
2478.92s: belief is oil demands coming goingon to
2480.88s: continue to soften that leads to weaker
2483.80s: prices so um that's what I think the
2486.64s: next several months is and then I've
2488.96s: said in the bust if if I'm right that
2491.32s: the bus happens later this year in the
2493.80s: bust I expect o to go to $30 so I think
2496.88s: we've pretty much seen the high water
2498.68s: mark or close to the high water mark in
2501.20s: oil you know watch it watch it next week
2503.56s: go to 85 but but I think we're in the
2506.68s: you know last stages of any uh strength
2509.64s: in oil and I think it's just begins a
2512.44s: downtrend from there before before we go
2516.04s: into metals for the the oil component
2518.56s: just out of curiosity do you think
2521.04s: softening demand would then lead to
2523.96s: production slowing or do you think that
2525.52s: we would start um storing I'm just
2528.64s: wondering how those two different things
2530.76s: come together well yeah my my guess is
2534.28s: and I don't know this obviously but my
2536.16s: guess is Trump Trump's of a mind to get
2539.40s: oil up right he's he's not saying he's
2542.48s: not trying to predict the oil price in
2544.04s: the next six months he's just looking
2545.64s: and saying you know if I were president
2548.28s: the last four years we would have had
2549.92s: even more Supply and we gotta get oil up
2552.72s: and he's focused really on us being
2555.32s: totally independent of of Supply coming
2558.08s: in from you know our our adversaries or
2561.72s: anybody you know that we we are
2563.52s: self-sufficient in oil so he's he's
2565.92s: looking and he's looking at it as lower
2568.80s: oil prices lower gasoline prices helps
2571.08s: the economy helps the consumer um higher
2574.76s: oil production helps you know
2577.20s: Pennsylvania helps oil companies Etc so
2580.80s: I think he's he's not going to be all
2583.32s: focused on what's the price of oil going
2585.28s: to be in the next six months so so I
2587.44s: think the likelihood is at least for the
2590.40s: next several months he's going to be
2592.92s: encouraging more drilling now what the
2594.76s: oil companies do in terms of their focus
2597.88s: they may be a little more focused on you
2600.72s: know we want to hold back some of that
2602.12s: Supply because you know the Market's
2604.16s: weakening so it's not you know his
2606.56s: policy May not go one for one right into
2609.32s: a big increase in Supply because you
2611.52s: know it's got to be done by the
2613.24s: companies themselves but I think in
2615.08s: general The Narrative of the next six
2617.28s: months is going to be towards higher
2619.00s: Supply or towards you know more drilling
2622.16s: I see got it okay cool yeah thank you
2624.04s: for the clarification there and I know
2626.00s: we're coming up on time here but I
2628.04s: there's just a couple other things I
2629.24s: wanted to run by you definitely did ask
2631.24s: about the metals if you want I was G to
2632.68s: ask if we could cover Metals yeah yeah
2634.52s: it's kind of key um I think the metals
2637.40s: look great here okay you know silver
2640.96s: first of all gold I mean gold is coming
2643.36s: out of a a consolidation over the last
2645.76s: several months where if you look
2647.56s: particularly if you're look at a monthly
2649.44s: you know kind of came into a wedge
2651.88s: technically and it's breaking out of
2654.00s: that wedge as we speak so we're not far
2656.56s: from highs um I think we'll push through
2659.64s: the old high of last year and you know
2663.44s: my target is 3,400 and I think I'm very
2666.48s: comfortable with 3,400 if it exceeds
2668.48s: 3,400 it won't won't surprise me um and
2672.24s: that's again first half of this year
2674.92s: probably um could spill over from there
2677.96s: but I think it's most of it's this first
2680.16s: half um silver has been the lagard of
2683.88s: the two um particularly the miners of
2688.20s: silver but um but I think silver is also
2692.28s: showing it's coming out of consolidation
2695.36s: you know it um got up to 35 and a half I
2698.52s: think in it's you know run early you
2701.52s: know last year whatever towards the end
2704.04s: of last year um and it's corrected down
2707.52s: to you know just below 30 and now trying
2711.52s: to turn around and get going here I
2713.88s: think we'll be back above 35 pretty
2715.80s: quickly I don't know whether it happens
2718.12s: in you know the next month or takes two
2720.48s: months but my guess is it's the next
2722.68s: month and on its way to the mid 40s and
2726.24s: then from the mid 40s I have a Target 75
2728.84s: so again it's coming from farther back
2732.08s: so it might take longer um in terms of
2735.96s: it may take more than six months but it
2737.84s: can also get going fast and could be you
2740.40s: know most of that move could happen in
2741.84s: the next six months so that's a hell of
2744.36s: a move if we go from 30 here or 30 31
2747.84s: here to 75 and that's kind of what I
2750.36s: expect um by the way the the um gold
2755.32s: silver ratio which had rolled over last
2758.20s: year because silver did pretty well for
2759.76s: a while um and gold had had you know
2764.12s: Consolidated some of their run uh silver
2767.12s: just goes faster when it goes it's
2768.92s: percentage wise moves faster so in the
2771.04s: Bull Run we had brought the gold silver
2774.16s: ratio down from 80 or 885 90 I don't
2777.08s: remember where it topped out there um
2780.28s: and then it turned around here in this
2782.60s: most recent correction because silver
2784.16s: corrected more and went back towards the
2786.64s: high
2787.48s: of that
2788.72s: ratio I'm you know if if you divide
2791.84s: 3,400 by 75 I think it takes you down
2794.88s: towards 40 um and let's see yeah I think
2799.56s: it takes you down towards 40 45
2801.60s: something like that on the ratio from up
2804.08s: over 80 or 85 um so what that means is
2808.96s: as that ratio drops that favors silver I
2811.88s: means silver is out performing gold and
2814.44s: that's exactly what you get in both
2816.12s: markets in the so I expect that the
2819.04s: miners themselves which have lagged by a
2821.40s: lot I think it's just a matter of people
2823.92s: need to gain confidence that this isn't
2826.48s: going to be another one of those failed
2828.00s: rallies in the medals you know they go
2830.56s: and then they stop particularly silver
2832.24s: you know they they look like they're
2834.04s: lifting out of a consolidation and then
2836.12s: they stop and correct again and I think
2838.96s: that's just discouraged the minor
2841.52s: investors and um so they're they're
2844.96s: they're more show me investors you know
2846.60s: it's like they're they're going to come
2848.04s: in later they're just not gonna jump on
2850.52s: the bandwagon so
2852.24s: quickly do you think cryptocurrency or
2855.12s: Bitcoin has any interaction in this
2858.16s: conversation with the performance of
2859.76s: gold and silver I know a lot of people
2861.44s: have mixed feelings I know there's like
2862.96s: the metal die hards that you know no
2865.40s: interaction I think there's some people
2867.76s: that are thinking Bitcoin is going to
2869.36s: overtake it at some point in terms of
2871.16s: being a currency or just a um
2873.92s: preservation of value just really really
2877.20s: curious if you think that cryptocurrency
2879.32s: Bitcoin fits into this in any way yeah
2881.56s: I'm not saying we didn't lose some
2883.28s: investors that used to be traditional
2885.32s: Metals investors to bitcoin I'm sure
2887.36s: there are you know people think it's um
2890.36s: you know it's uh digital gold or
2892.92s: whatever right so I'm I'm not saying
2895.52s: that hasn't happened at the micro level
2898.68s: on a macro basis what we're seeing gold
2900.96s: and silver is gold and Silver's own
2902.64s: problems you know or particularly
2903.92s: Silver's own problems it's not I think
2906.44s: Bitcoin has little to do with any of it
2909.64s: and and not going to hold back gold and
2912.44s: silver now or post bust you know you my
2916.88s: target on gold is 20,000 by early next
2920.40s: decade my target on Silver is 500 uh so
2925.52s: clearly I'm not thinking Bitcoin is an
2927.60s: issue uh and I don't know what Bitcoin
2930.08s: is in that you know maybe it flies to or
2932.52s: maybe it doesn't go I you know it could
2934.96s: be you I I have no opinion on what
2937.88s: bitcoin's going to look like after the
2939.36s: bust or frankly it's got to prove itself
2942.36s: in the bust before you can have any idea
2944.80s: what it's going to look like what it
2946.08s: does yeah yeah um awesome one last
2949.36s: question before I let you run
2951.88s: the when I think about a lot of the
2955.16s: technology that's coming out there's
2957.60s: expansion of artificial intelligence
2959.84s: General robotics we're now starting to
2962.24s: talk about Quantum Computing although
2963.80s: that still seems like it's a bit of a
2965.64s: ways down down the path here do you
2968.72s: think from a Commodities Metals
2972.36s: perspective that there could be some
2974.84s: sort of larger production of some of the
2977.48s: materials that ultimately feed into
2979.96s: those broader systems so things like
2982.40s: lithium for example kind of going to
2984.32s: like the the battery side of things just
2986.60s: thinking that from a commodity's
2988.84s: perspective if there's going to be this
2990.24s: really big technological Revolution it
2992.60s: needs to be um supported by you know in
2996.72s: underlying Hardware infrastructure of
2998.44s: some sort do you see any specific
3001.52s: Commodities anything like that that is
3003.88s: more friendly more likely Poise to
3006.24s: benefit from that
3007.40s: movement yeah for sure I think silver is
3010.36s: a good one I me Silver obviously in in
3012.56s: EV and solar panels and in lots of tech
3016.48s: technology areas it it's increasing the
3020.36s: need for silver and the demand for
3022.64s: silver so I think yes lithium silver
3026.16s: some of those
3027.20s: metals are going to see increased demand
3029.52s: because of technology and we're gonna
3031.92s: obviously see increased power needs
3034.28s: because of
3035.32s: Technology um so you know benefits oil
3038.36s: later on down the road um so yeah I
3041.80s: think I think for sure um on the other
3045.00s: hand what I would say this isn't really
3047.20s: your question but post bust if the
3050.68s: environment is what I think it's going
3051.96s: to be which is unlike the last 42 years
3055.44s: where interest rates ratcheted down from
3058.36s: 15 or 20% down to almost zero um the
3063.24s: next cycle post bust they're going to
3066.00s: ratchet up from zero um to 20% and
3070.68s: higher um that is not an environment for
3073.92s: gross stocks so there there will be
3076.36s: gross stocks that can outpace that kind
3078.76s: of move in interest rates and you know
3081.20s: the effect it has on PE multiples Etc
3083.80s: there'll be you know things probably in
3085.48s: the AI field
3087.08s: maybe quantum physics Etc um but
3091.96s: generally whereas growth was the name of
3094.92s: the game for many you know for the last
3097.12s: several decades the name of the game in
3099.76s: the next cycle post bust is going to be
3103.68s: resources it's going to be
3106.04s: Commodities um because there's going to
3108.16s: be a real scarcity partly for what you
3110.56s: just asked about you know that that
3112.88s: feeds into that same thing where
3114.28s: demand's going to far outstrip Supply
3117.08s: and there's only way one way for prices
3119.20s: to go if theand outstrip Supply by the
3122.16s: amount it's going to and that's straight
3125.00s: up got it okay one one last question I
3128.36s: promise I I lied to you before I was
3129.84s: just thinking about this as you're
3131.00s: talking um nuclear energy do you think
3134.36s: that that starts to take a larger role
3138.04s: in providing energy at this point do you
3140.40s: think that there's a a feeder
3142.00s: opportunity there I think so I mean you
3145.52s: you definitely have improved the
3147.12s: technology and they've you know they've
3149.04s: rethought it so it's no longer these
3150.72s: Greenfield plants that take 15 years in
3154.20s: the planning and so the the supply comes
3156.60s: online 20 years from now or 18 years
3159.00s: from now it's not realistic um so now
3162.80s: you have these smaller um nuclear plants
3165.76s: that can be built pretty quickly and and
3168.56s: you know don't don't have to cross so
3171.28s: many regulatory hurdles um and I think
3174.92s: that's the way to go um so for sure
3178.16s: we're going to have a shortage of energy
3179.72s: there's no question that's you know just
3182.56s: like Commodities energy is going to be a
3184.24s: commodity that demands far out stripping
3187.32s: Supply you know we've we've constrained
3189.76s: Supply in all those areas in energy and
3192.48s: all our Commodities and and then all of
3195.28s: a sudden you have this huge massive
3199.36s: fiscal and monetary uh pump you know
3203.56s: stimulus you know 20 trillion from our

3215.40s: thing going on around the world you're
3217.24s: just going to have this huge spike in
3219.56s: demand for things uh you know here it's
3222.64s: going to be the story is going to be
