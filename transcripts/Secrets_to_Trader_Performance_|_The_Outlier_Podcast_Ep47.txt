0.06s: hi guys welcome we're here with another
3.72s: chat with Traders I'm here with Eric
5.76s: from the es invest Channel and I will
10.26s: link his channel in the pin comment also
13.26s: in the description and for people on
15.90s: Eric's Channel my name is David Jaffe
17.64s: and I'm with best stock strategy and um
20.82s: I want to go over we're going to discuss
23.52s: like options trading and our mutual
26.40s: experience and common mistakes and
28.80s: things of that nature this is going to
30.24s: be a very valuable chat so kindly watch
33.24s: until the end and leave a comment below
35.34s: and let us know any questions that you
37.02s: have and any valuable feedback I think
40.44s: it will be worthwhile if we started with
43.16s: our backgrounds and Eric if you could
45.96s: also like introduce yourself
48.00s: um your channel as I as I did quickly
50.52s: previously but you know introduce like
52.56s: your channel and also your background
54.12s: and then I'll do the same afterwards
56.10s: yeah for sure this one's awesome so
58.02s: first off thanks for putting this
59.04s: together I I really really enjoy these
60.90s: kind of conversations they're always fun
63.18s: to me to explore you know different
64.86s: approaches and different ideas so I
66.60s: appreciate you kind of uh starting the
69.06s: dialogue there but
70.80s: um yeah my name is Eric I am a 16 year
74.40s: retail Trader I started back in 2007
76.86s: when I was in high school
78.84s: um like most people that started trading
80.58s: I grew up super poor I had a single mom
82.56s: and I was working a bunch of odd jobs
85.08s: split wood worked at a bowling alley all
87.12s: that kind of stuff like most of us do
88.50s: and I had a teacher in high school that
91.50s: saw that I was working a lot and he was
93.12s: asking what I was doing with my money
94.50s: because he knew my background he knew my
96.06s: brother and I essentially just don't
98.64s: have a saving like I didn't know what
99.84s: else to do he's like you need to look
100.98s: into investing and that that literally
104.46s: that one sentence sent me down a
106.68s: completely different life trajectory
109.56s: so I started learning about investing I
112.56s: went up to the library you know first
114.00s: read books then I started checking out
115.50s: on the computer and long story short I
118.32s: came across options after I traded
121.08s: equities for a little bit and I saw some
123.48s: early success I was super fortunate and
126.12s: I started realizing like oh like this
128.52s: can actually make a difference for me
130.46s: and I kind of kept at it so even when I
133.68s: went to my undergrad which was very
136.26s: statistics heavy I started integrating a
138.60s: lot of bats you know what I was doing
141.48s: um and then even when I was on active
143.28s: duty in the Marines I was a marine
144.54s: officer for six and a half years I kept
147.00s: trading I just kind of kept modifying
149.04s: what I was doing and during that time
150.42s: frame I came across a retired army guy
153.60s: online actually that became like a huge
156.48s: mentor of mine he never asked for
157.74s: anything he never sold me anything we
159.12s: didn't care he literally was just
161.10s: helping me and it's because I was taking
163.08s: the time to probe him I was taking the
164.94s: time to learn and he was willing to
166.74s: facilitate that so you know fast forward
169.56s: I'm 32 and I'm super fortunate the kind
172.32s: of life that I'm able to live I pay for
173.76s: my mom's house I pay for her expenses
175.50s: and this all came from essentially two
179.10s: different people in my life sending me
180.54s: down a very specific path so that's part
183.24s: of the reason why I like doing these so
184.68s: much because I think the idea of just
186.36s: promulgating good authentic information
188.64s: for people and not asking them for
190.62s: anything is massive because you never
192.66s: know what will click for them so yeah
194.28s: that's just a quick background on me and
195.60s: then the YouTube channel I started that
197.40s: back during covid
199.14s: on the same exact line because I don't
202.44s: belong on a camera I have a face only a
204.36s: mother can love I'm not good at editing
206.34s: like I'm not good at any of this but I
209.16s: felt compelled because I had people that
212.04s: helped me anyways so long story short
214.14s: all of my Marine friends they were stuck
216.54s: at home they weren't going on to base
218.28s: because of covid so I always talk about
221.52s: impactful things to my life to try to
224.10s: help share information and I found
226.68s: myself doing these phone calls with my
228.36s: friends about finance and I was just
229.92s: saying this same over and over
232.38s: again I was like you gotta have an
233.52s: emergency fund what's an emergency funds
235.20s: you know six to 12 months of expenses so
237.60s: anyways I made a couple videos and I
239.94s: said here watch this video so that when
242.28s: we talk on the phone it's more
244.20s: productive for everybody right right so
246.18s: you're not repeating everything exactly
248.22s: it's not it's not a good use of
249.36s: anybody's time and then the video
251.52s: started randomly getting views and I was
253.62s: like this is super weird because it was
255.90s: like recorded from a laptop I think I
257.64s: was wearing a tank top like it's you
259.98s: know it's just going for it and the
262.44s: channel is kind of slowly been grown
264.24s: ever since and I'm here for it I don't
266.28s: really have any specific objectives for
268.62s: the channel although I like to get
270.00s: better at things and I'd like to think
271.68s: that I've gotten far better at this than
273.36s: when I started I can't help but want to
275.40s: improve but overall my main objective is
277.92s: to share information so yeah that's
279.66s: where I'm coming from
280.86s: one thing that you said that I wanted to
283.02s: probe a little bit you mentioned that
285.48s: you you grew up very poor what do you
287.94s: think is the determining factor between
290.28s: because I I believe that like mindset
292.74s: and also work ethic is extremely vital
295.02s: between climbing up the social hierarchy
297.66s: and not feeling like you're a victim
299.10s: because you grew up poor and still
301.02s: having faith in the system that if you
303.06s: worked hard that Opera and you have
305.22s: value to provide other people then
307.44s: opportunities will be provided for you
309.42s: however from my experience and I I
311.76s: didn't grow up for it but I actually
313.08s: grew up in a very poor area in
314.94s: Monticello New York in the Catskills and
317.76s: um
319.20s: you're from where Newburgh New York so
321.78s: I'm from the Hudson Valley I'm literally
324.50s: I used to have a girlfriend okay so I
327.24s: met a girl
328.32s: um her name's Danielle in Poughkeepsie
330.84s: at like a nightclub and then I used to I
333.42s: used to go to Newburgh
335.46s: um like on the waterfront and she had
336.96s: like a jewelry store there her parents
338.46s: there so I used to um so I used to
340.50s: actually like date her and I would drive
341.70s: like 40 minutes there so it's a lot of
344.64s: the it's weird that you said Newburgh
346.38s: because some of the gangs from Newburgh
348.06s: have actually migrated to Monticello and
351.18s: um now the high school is like
352.38s: significantly like more more dangerous
354.30s: than it used to be but um but yeah it's
357.00s: a that's actually very very ironic
358.68s: hilarious so what do you and I remember
360.78s: like the new we used to play soccer for
362.70s: like Newburgh against Newburgh Free
364.14s: Academy and they would destroy us like
365.64s: you guys were amazing at soccer like NFA
368.52s: um yeah
370.14s: he actually didn't even know that you
371.88s: were that you went to Newburgh that's
373.08s: very very but yeah that's that's
375.00s: interesting um so I guess it's even like
377.04s: more relevant like how what do you think
379.68s: separated you because I think both of us
381.66s: know like a lot of people who they
383.70s: didn't grow up wealthy but they also had
385.80s: a lot of potential you know like just
388.44s: they were very smart if they studied at
390.84s: all they would have gotten A's they
392.34s: might have didn't they might have done
393.78s: naturally well on their SATs but they
396.72s: still felt like a little bit angry at
398.46s: the world that you know they grew up
400.92s: like disadvantaged or maybe they didn't
402.42s: have like the best clothes or maybe they
404.16s: were picked on a little bit during High
405.66s: School why do you think you have like a
409.62s: positive mindset and you've been able to
411.72s: to overcome like your like where you
414.78s: grew up and growing up for to become the
416.76s: person that you are now
418.32s: I think it's two things it's a great
420.30s: question too because it obviously causes
422.28s: a lot of self-reflection but I think the
424.50s: first part is
426.84s: um I've never really allowed myself to
430.02s: resign myself to circumstance and it's
431.94s: because I can't control circumstance I'm
434.70s: a big believer in stoicism I'm a huge
436.62s: practicer of it so I think as a kid my
439.44s: objective was to do as good as I can no
442.02s: matter what and whatever happens will
444.66s: happen I will be able to look at myself
446.70s: and say like I did my best and I
449.16s: actually that was one of the things that
451.14s: was super fortunate early on is I got
453.06s: around a good crowd even in NFA which
455.70s: was a pretty I walked through metal
457.20s: detectors every day like it's not a good
458.70s: school and but I got into all honors
461.82s: classes and it's because like I just
463.62s: wanted to do well and then it's this
466.62s: kind of innate drive to perform I am
469.50s: obsessed with performance so I think
471.24s: that's the first thing and then I think
473.22s: the second thing was good mentors people
475.50s: that at a young age because I had dad
478.74s: like I knew him he was an alcoholic he
480.66s: you know he died pretty early but he
483.54s: wasn't like the worst guy but he also
485.40s: wasn't like a giant mentor of mine he
487.98s: did Mentor me not to you know take
490.26s: credit away from him but one of the
492.48s: beautiful things about growing up with a
494.64s: single mom is that whole idea of like it
497.64s: takes a village is exactly what happened
500.16s: my neighbors knew I didn't have a dad so
502.20s: my neighbor across the street taught me
503.88s: how to snow blow in the winter then my
506.22s: uncle taught me how to work on cars long
508.44s: story short the idea is as all of these
510.66s: people understood my circumstance they
513.18s: helped me they helped me out of
515.22s: literally the goodness of their hearts
517.44s: and I think that that High School Mentor
520.32s: of mine I call my stepdad now he's one
522.18s: he's he's like I'm so close with him
524.28s: because he changed my whole life and
526.74s: then that other Mentor so I think those
528.18s: are the two things I think the first one
529.62s: is kind of worrying about what I can
533.34s: control and focusing on my own
535.32s: performance so that I can look myself in
537.54s: the mirror and say like I'm confident
539.04s: and comfortable with what I did here and
541.02s: then the second thing is being receptive
543.12s: to input and having mentors that were
545.64s: willing to provide input I think those
547.08s: are the two main things
548.52s: you also mentioned stoicism which I
550.74s: think is incredibly important I I love
552.84s: the quotation from stoicism you know
554.76s: like Marcus Aurelius and I also
556.74s: subscribe to a bunch of YouTube channels
558.72s: and in a way it's like it's a little bit
560.82s: negative because you're kind of like
562.76s: pondering like sometimes you're
564.48s: meditating upon your ultimate demise and
567.96s: then you realize that like everything
569.22s: that we do here is not super important
571.68s: so in a way it kind of brings peace to
573.96s: you when you think that something is so
575.76s: vital but one quotation that I mentioned
578.52s: um that I was talking about earlier is
580.38s: um do what you can with what you have
583.08s: where you are and I think that that's
585.60s: something that's incredibly important
587.04s: because it puts you kind of similar to
589.32s: like what Eckhart Tolle say about about
591.06s: like The Power of Now like with where
593.58s: you are right now do your best with
596.82s: everything you have like with all the
598.80s: information that you have at this
600.54s: specific moment but do what you can with
603.06s: what you have where you are so
604.68s: essentially you know do your best at
606.54s: this specific moment and it kind of
608.16s: brings thieves and as long as you do
610.44s: that and you give a hundred percent then
612.66s: you don't necessarily have to be outcome
614.40s: dependent because you did your best
616.20s: based upon the information that you had
618.36s: available at that specific moment when
620.34s: you made the decision
622.08s: I literally love that like I I literally
624.48s: love that and I think that you highlight
626.88s: another really important part which is
628.86s: you know the idea of with the
630.36s: information that you have at that point
631.56s: in time because I look back and a lot of
634.38s: the ways that I've been able to navigate
636.00s: has been due to information injections
638.88s: from people exactly to your point
641.52s: um if that didn't happen who I I
643.32s: literally have no idea where I would
645.24s: have landed like I wouldn't have gone to
646.62s: college because that same Mentor is the
649.26s: one who encouraged me to apply for a
650.76s: Marine Corps scholarship I wouldn't have
652.56s: gone that route I probably would have
653.76s: enlisted which would have been the best
654.96s: thing I could have done to be honest I
656.52s: think for people that grow up in
658.50s: slightly maybe disadvantaged positions
660.78s: going through the military is one of the
662.76s: best possible things you could do in my
664.14s: opinion because it gives you a great
667.14s: structure I've always liked structure
669.00s: but it gives you like a really great
671.82s: Network to immediately tap into and
673.62s: completely change your circumstance
674.88s: which is funny so you're from Monticello
678.84s: um yeah I obviously would love to hear
680.52s: about your background a little bit yeah
682.86s: so my um my dad was a doctor and then he
686.52s: was an i he was an eye doctor in
688.08s: Monticello and my uncle was actually an
690.42s: eye doctor in Goshen which is actually
692.22s: like closer to you yeah like near like
694.50s: the Galleria Crystal Run and um so I I
698.04s: was in honors classes but the classes
701.46s: like our school was so bad that the
703.32s: teachers were almost expected to give us
705.00s: A's so frequently like during Junior and
707.88s: Senior High School
709.62s: um I would skip class and then go like
711.90s: bowling or like go to Walmart and things
713.88s: like that and as long as I didn't get in
715.80s: trouble then the teachers would still
718.08s: give us A's and I did well on my SATs I
721.86s: did I did go to a good school and I
723.66s: think that the the SATs they they
726.00s: allowed me to get into Cornell but the
728.52s: ironic thing is that even though my high
730.92s: school was so bad
732.36s: I I was so far behind all like majority
736.08s: of the other kids at Cornell but even
738.24s: though my my high school was bad it only
740.46s: took me one semester to catch up so
743.88s: basically I was behind for about three
746.70s: to four months and then I was on par
749.64s: after that first semester and a little
751.44s: bit of hard work with all the kids who
753.72s: went to like private school or all the
755.34s: kids who went to amazing schools in like
757.02s: Westchester or Long Island so I think
759.66s: the takeaway is that as long as you
761.94s: maintain a good attitude and you're
763.50s: willing to put the work in even if you
765.90s: go to like a relatively bad High School
768.06s: like Monticello or you know I don't want
770.28s: to like label it but it's not like
771.84s: Monticello wasn't like the best school
773.64s: just like NFA it doesn't have like a
776.16s: reputation for academic Excellence when
778.26s: you compare it to like Westchester or
780.48s: Long Island but if you are currently
783.42s: going through that situation as long as
785.76s: you put the work in then you will
787.98s: definitely catch up with all the other
789.90s: kids who might have had a more Advantage
791.88s: background so I worked really hard in
794.34s: Cornell
795.66s: um I I was just I've always been like
797.22s: very competitive and I was very
799.14s: fortunate to get an investment banking
800.64s: job I interned at Morgan Stanley and
803.04s: then I actually finished
805.20s: um you know I finished all my coursework
806.94s: at Cornell in three and a half years
808.86s: because I took summer classes at both
811.02s: Sullivan County Community College and
812.34s: also at uh at Orange County Community
814.32s: College and it allowed me to graduate in
816.96s: three and a half years I then worked at
819.06s: CIBC world markets in their industrial
820.92s: work and services and Investment Banking
822.84s: and um
824.64s: I don't know why anyone will go into
826.62s: Investment Banking it's just like it's
828.96s: such a horrible experience like
831.14s: they treat you so they just burn you out
834.24s: like you would work until two o'clock in
836.34s: the morning and then you're expected to
837.66s: be in the office at 9 30. uh but much
840.72s: worse than that they treat you so hardly
842.64s: like you're less than human and yes like
844.56s: you are making really good money and it
847.08s: definitely depends what group you're in
849.00s: but my first group at CIBC World Markets
851.94s: was really really bad and I was thinking
854.46s: about quitting Investment Banking but
856.26s: then I switched groups and I eventually
859.56s: did banking for about four to five years
861.78s: and then I was simultaneously working in
864.90s: Nightlife as a promoter and um I was
868.74s: always interested in the stock market
870.14s: and probably similar to yourself I
873.72s: gravitated towards like trying to learn
875.88s: technical analysis and day trading which
877.80s: I was never successful at and then you
880.44s: know I was just I realized that options
883.20s: selling options gives you a statistic
884.64s: physical Edge so then I started trading
887.70s: options and then over time I started
890.40s: learning how to like manage and
892.20s: eliminate the tail risk because even
894.24s: though you can win like 95 of your
896.28s: trades that doesn't necessarily mean
898.44s: that you're going to be profitable if
900.78s: you fall into or if you're unlucky
902.94s: enough to you know get hit with like a
905.04s: black spawn event like you know December
907.14s: 2018 February 2018 March 2020 Etc so um
912.36s: so yeah
913.98s: I do have a question for you it's
915.54s: something that I spent a lot of time
917.28s: thinking about and talking with my wife
918.90s: about it's just fascinating to me you
921.78s: brought up you know kind of your
923.58s: experience in high school and how you
925.56s: would like skip school sometimes and
927.30s: like go bowling and stuff like that
929.16s: why why do you think it seems to be and
933.42s: this might be a little myopic of me but
935.76s: it does seem to be a lot of instances
938.28s: where people who seemingly have a better
941.16s: starting point they have like their own
943.68s: sets of friction points that are
946.20s: difficult for them to to like overcome
948.36s: like if I look back at my experience I
950.76s: would say okay like I went to NFA not a
953.28s: good school I should have you know
955.38s: essentially done the same thing whatever
956.58s: the case is but I kind of went down
958.38s: another path but I can't tell you how
960.36s: many times I come across people who seem
962.28s: to have these really advantageous
963.96s: backgrounds whether it's affluent
965.52s: parents go to a decent School whatever
966.90s: it is and then they still have like
969.00s: their own series of struggles to me it
971.28s: almost seems like if you grow up in an
972.96s: advantage scenario that comes with its
975.36s: own disadvantages is that like something
977.34s: you've come across or I I always think
980.22s: about that to try to understand it
982.26s: I I do think I I think that I can talk
985.38s: about like for myself and then I can
987.00s: also speak about like things that that
988.44s: I've noticed like especially like at
990.36s: Cornell
991.44s: um where there were people who had a lot
993.54s: more money than me I think for me I um
996.54s: I've always kind of been like uh someone
998.76s: who kind of walks on the line but
1000.62s: sometimes I could like potentially step
1002.54s: over it and I think that as I got older
1004.94s: then I pulled back like I'm married I
1007.46s: have children and my wife is like really
1009.20s: good she's like the type of person where
1010.82s: if she goes to Whole Foods and then my
1013.04s: daughter like puts something under the
1014.36s: carriage and she doesn't see it she'll
1016.22s: like freak out and then go back to the
1017.78s: cashier and say she'll like drive back
1019.82s: to Whole Foods and say hey you didn't
1021.80s: charge me for this so I think it's just
1024.02s: basically like in my own makeup where I
1027.50s: kinda I wouldn't necessarily say like
1029.54s: I'm like a like a Rick James like
1031.28s: habitual line stepper but in the past
1034.34s: like you know especially in high school
1036.20s: I would kind of like push the envelope
1038.12s: and see like what I could get away with
1039.98s: just because I was always interested in
1041.78s: like you know analyzing like people's
1043.82s: reactions and things of that nature so I
1046.40s: think that from that perspective at
1048.44s: least for me I I just
1050.90s: I've always been the type of person
1052.58s: especially when I was younger who was
1055.40s: overly optimistic and thought okay like
1057.86s: yeah I'll do that and I'll take the
1060.08s: chance because things will work out but
1062.60s: as I've gotten older I realized that
1064.82s: relying upon luck and doing stupid
1067.52s: things is a really bad strategy and I've
1070.70s: significantly cut back on and curbed my
1073.52s: risk seeking Behavior by smart as far as
1076.46s: like other people I do think that
1079.28s: if you if you are born with a lot of
1082.64s: things and your parents or you know your
1084.98s: your um or whether you have one parent
1086.78s: or both if they give you things and they
1089.06s: don't make you work for it then you kind
1091.94s: of
1092.78s: you you don't necessarily recognize how
1095.54s: much sacrifice is required in order to
1098.00s: earn a lot of money and if you're given
1100.76s: things then without having to build up
1103.22s: that strong work ethic then I think that
1105.62s: could be very detrimental to people in
1107.54s: the future and um I also think that a
1110.48s: lot of it has to do with luck I mean you
1112.46s: have very brilliant people who have
1115.46s: strong work ethics and then they like
1118.28s: hurt their knee playing basketball then
1120.08s: they go in for a routine surgery they
1122.30s: get addicted to opioids and then it
1123.86s: completely destroys their life so let's
1125.96s: not disregard the the luck aspect that
1130.52s: success you know that that we're in
1132.38s: right now like currently like there are
1134.06s: multiple paths that I could have gone
1135.38s: under that were you know I might not be
1137.60s: here right now and I'm sure the same
1139.04s: thing for you where you might have done
1140.90s: some things in your past where you know
1142.82s: maybe you were driving too fast or you
1145.10s: know you could have like gotten into a
1146.48s: car accident or something like that like
1147.98s: luck plays a big Park but you know I
1150.14s: think for me personally I've always been
1151.70s: a little bit of a risk risk Seeker even
1153.56s: though I'm not so much right now but I
1156.08s: also think it's very important if I had
1158.24s: to choose between outworking someone or
1161.12s: being a little bit smarter than someone
1162.98s: a hundred out of a hundred times I would
1165.50s: always choose the out working someone
1168.14s: because that's something that you
1169.58s: control that's in your own power whereas
1172.52s: I know that um my one of the um my
1175.94s: friends who is actually my roommate at
1177.20s: Cornell his name is Arby and he was
1180.20s: brilliant like even by Cornell standards
1182.36s: but he he doesn't really he never really
1186.14s: worked that hard and you know he is he's
1189.26s: okay like he's like successful he works
1191.72s: at Capital IQ but he definitely didn't
1194.24s: accomplish his goals and he definitely
1196.10s: didn't accomplish like max out at his
1198.38s: full potential and he's brilliant
1201.02s: yeah yeah I agree with you I think that
1203.48s: unless you're in like a hyper technical
1205.46s: field the hustle can I call it the
1207.26s: Hustle but it's exactly what you're
1208.34s: talking about like this work ethic to
1209.90s: stock ethic that it could take you super
1212.12s: far it's like the same people that I
1213.92s: meet I have a couple friends from high
1215.24s: school that started like Construction
1217.28s: they even go to college you know what I
1219.02s: mean and they're they're doing great and
1220.88s: so exactly to your point like being a
1224.54s: little bit street smart but
1226.64s: I think work ethic can take you a really
1228.98s: long way I think that's an interesting
1230.96s: and one quick thing before we get into
1233.06s: like more so like options trading in my
1235.40s: opinion I feel like like intelligence is
1238.16s: vastly overrated I live in South Florida
1240.08s: and you can be a multi-millionaire by
1243.74s: opening up like your own HVAC company
1246.50s: like the HVAC I had people come here to
1249.98s: service my my HVAC units my air
1252.50s: conditioners Etc and I pay them like 700
1255.32s: and I paid them BSL so you know they're
1258.26s: probably not reporting everything
1260.24s: um so maybe they report like 200 or 300
1262.52s: at night but the reality is that if you
1265.40s: have a very good work ethic and let's
1266.96s: say you don't necessarily enjoy like
1268.58s: memorizing everything or you know a lot
1270.80s: of the crap that they teach you in high
1272.24s: school
1273.20s: um as long as you have a good work ethic
1274.76s: and you learn a trade you can become a
1277.58s: millionaire very easily you can work in
1279.86s: you know even like power washing
1281.48s: driveways or being or owning like a
1283.22s: roofing company or construction or HVAC
1285.92s: things of that nature you don't
1287.42s: necessarily have to gravitate towards
1289.46s: things that that like Society tells you
1292.34s: or like very high social status like
1294.38s: working as like an engineer or you know
1296.54s: AI or like trading or things of that
1298.46s: nature you know will you bring up a good
1300.92s: point I actually questioned my whole
1302.48s: life's existence I was watching a
1304.16s: YouTube video by Caleb Presley he does
1306.80s: kind of like these fun interviews
1308.24s: they're called Sunday conversations and
1310.76s: he did one with this this girl called
1312.74s: bad baby who exactly it was imagine
1314.90s: she's an only fans model and she's from
1317.84s: Florida and she has like a hundred
1320.36s: million dollars and in the process of
1323.24s: the dialogue though you know Caleb was
1325.46s: asking her like Florida you know it's a
1327.92s: peninsula like what does that even mean
1329.42s: she didn't know what the word Peninsula
1331.34s: was and then later on in that
1333.50s: conversation he asked her like oh so you
1335.66s: like reinvest into the business and she
1337.88s: essentially was just like I don't know
1339.56s: what that means and I was sitting here
1341.42s: thinking like God where did I go wrong
1343.40s: my I need to start an only fans ASAP
1345.74s: because I mean obviously she has good
1348.26s: work ethic man because she's made a ton
1350.84s: of money I was like bro yeah to your
1353.90s: point A lot of times just being being a
1357.44s: hustler it can it can take you a pretty
1359.60s: far away provided you're willing to put
1361.34s: in the work
1362.36s: the one thing on that is it's always
1364.52s: easy to look at the exceptions you can
1366.38s: say like like oh this person made like
1368.78s: 100 million dollars and doesn't know
1370.28s: like like basic you know basic knowledge
1372.50s: but I think that for every one of her
1375.86s: there's probably like 10 000 people who
1379.28s: actually are more attractive than her on
1381.44s: on only fans who are probably making
1384.38s: like a few hundred dollars every single
1386.30s: month so for for people who watch her
1388.76s: and then you know and also you don't
1390.74s: know like what's going on in her life
1392.96s: like maybe there are a lot of people who
1395.18s: become rich and I'm sure that that you
1397.52s: know it's pretty common knowledge that
1399.20s: winning the lottery for many middle
1401.18s: class people or or lower income people
1403.52s: for many of them it becomes like the
1405.44s: worst thing that happens to them they
1406.76s: develop like like you know addictions
1408.80s: like gambling or drug addictions and
1411.08s: things of that nature so I wouldn't be
1413.12s: and I know that you didn't say this in
1414.86s: order to so for us to say oh wow like
1417.02s: we're envious of her but I would just
1419.06s: say that for every one of her there's
1421.40s: probably 10 000 people that are
1422.84s: struggling there always has to be like a
1424.76s: Kim Kardashian or someone like that to
1427.22s: like get clicks or for the media to make
1429.14s: a big spectacle out of but um you know
1431.84s: you also just because someone might
1433.34s: people might have a lot of money that
1435.20s: doesn't necessarily mean that they have
1436.82s: all their together you just don't
1438.32s: know
1439.46s: definitely she clearly doesn't if she
1441.68s: doesn't know what the word
1442.64s: Peninsula means and she lives on one
1445.30s: but yeah you actually remind me of the
1447.80s: book uh outliers by Malcolm Gladwell he
1450.62s: talks about like all of those kinds of
1452.18s: things which I yeah I completely agree
1453.68s: with still makes me super mad that she
1455.90s: has 100 million dollars I went wrong man
1457.70s: I should have opened and only fans or
1459.44s: something but you know
1461.92s: how about um we transition and talk a
1464.72s: little bit about like our favorite
1465.92s: preferred trading strategy
1468.68s: yeah
1469.88s: um I think for trading for me I really
1473.96s: avoid the idea of falling in love with
1476.84s: the strategy the way that I think about
1478.52s: it is I have a tool kit my job is to
1482.90s: look at the stock market and figure out
1485.30s: the correct tool to apply so what that
1488.06s: means is I have a grouping of strategies
1490.60s: that I almost always run so like the
1493.76s: first one is a covered strangle which
1496.22s: for the options Traders out there it's
1498.02s: very similar to the wheel but I have
1500.42s: some pretty specific tweaks that I use
1502.58s: with it one of which I always run the
1504.50s: short calls at a ratio to the long
1506.18s: Deltas the second thing is it adds
1508.70s: additional cash secured puts out and
1511.04s: normally I kind of double dip so I'll
1513.50s: have money tied
1515.24s: to that trade and then you know I I have
1518.54s: portfolio margins so the broker they
1520.82s: don't make it cash secured right so I
1522.98s: still have that excess cash available
1524.60s: and then I'll put that in like box
1526.10s: spreads or something because right now
1527.66s: box spreads pay really well they're like
1529.04s: 5.4 annualized returns so it's a way to
1532.04s: kind of I call that my core core
1534.26s: allocation of the portfolio and then in
1537.32s: the speculative allocation of the
1539.00s: portfolio which is kind of exactly what
1540.68s: it sounds like that's where I'm gonna be
1542.18s: a little more
1544.22s: um focused on seeking specific
1545.96s: opportunities and for the speculative
1549.38s: allocation that's where I'm going to
1550.70s: trade things like variance risk premiums
1552.56s: so I'm going to use short straddles
1554.42s: strangles iron flies stuff like that and
1557.06s: then the other big strategy that I use
1558.68s: is ratio diagonals those are my
1560.60s: directional strategies it's either going
1563.18s: to be ratio call diagonal if I'm bullish
1565.40s: ratio put diagonal if I'm bearish and
1568.70s: those really make kind of the broad
1571.04s: Ensemble of what I trade if I'm trading
1574.34s: volatility Mansion I still trade the
1576.92s: straddles and strangles typically
1578.54s: straddles I would do and I would just
1579.98s: buy it
1581.78s: so
1583.40s: I'm sorry go ahead do you primarily
1585.98s: trade on individual underlyings or spy
1588.86s: SPX or or do you mix both of them yeah
1592.16s: definitely all of them so it's yeah
1594.86s: depending on the strategy so like
1596.12s: specifically if I'm trading like box
1597.62s: spreads those are going to be in SPX and
1600.08s: European options are a really important
1601.70s: part of the safety of that strategy
1603.20s: actually being risk-free for the covered
1605.84s: strangle that's almost always in an
1607.70s: index ETF I like iwm a lot for that and
1611.90s: then for the speculative allocation
1614.12s: sometimes it's in indices less so unless
1617.36s: it's the variance risk premium trades
1618.98s: otherwise it's going to be in individual
1621.08s: names more often than not
1623.42s: forgive my ignorance because I know that
1625.40s: I've looked at iwm before but which um
1628.10s: which that's is that a sector ETF
1630.62s: no it's the Russell
1633.64s: 2000.2 000 small cap stocks okay
1637.82s: that's awesome I it seems like you have
1639.80s: a plethora of
1641.12s: um of like different trading strategies
1642.74s: and do they I'm assuming that the answer
1645.02s: to this is yes but I also don't want to
1646.94s: put words in your mouth
1648.50s: does it vary your allocation on which
1651.20s: strategy you you use based upon like the
1654.80s: implied volatility rank or what Bix is
1657.02s: trading at or your directional uh or
1660.50s: your like thoughts regarding the future
1662.36s: direction of the market
1664.22s: um how do they vary based upon like you
1666.26s: know where the biggest is trading or
1667.70s: your perceptions of like where the
1669.08s: Market's going to be trading in like 30
1670.46s: days
1671.30s: it's a great question
1673.10s: um in a nutshell the way that I dull
1675.62s: Capital out between
1677.30s: or allocation and speculative first
1679.34s: comes down to I'm gonna try to make my
1681.62s: primary returns which for the longest
1683.78s: time was 15 per year that was my Target
1685.96s: and I held that for you like 12 years
1689.36s: and then over the last four or five
1691.46s: years I've been ratcheting it down
1692.96s: considerably
1694.58s: um just because I'm favoring a different
1696.74s: return profile for the markets and so
1702.40s: you're trying not to decrease your
1704.54s: overall portfolio volatility as opposed
1706.34s: to maximizing your return
1708.14s: that's exactly I'm not really looking to
1710.06s: aggressively grow the portfolio at this
1711.98s: point I'm kind of content with where it
1713.78s: is I'm still growing it and it's
1715.64s: actually funny this year was the first
1716.96s: year that I guided myself down uh
1719.66s: somewhere between like a six and eight
1721.34s: percent return and when I just did my
1723.56s: last YouTube live session right now I'm
1725.66s: like just shy of a 30 return on the year
1727.88s: so obviously it's kind of a different
1730.94s: run for me the way I think about that
1732.92s: part at least is if I am at my targets
1737.60s: I'm just very cautious and selective on
1740.90s: where I deploy but I I don't like stop
1743.06s: because who knows like next year could
1745.52s: be awful so but when I'm thinking
1748.34s: between core and speculative if I can
1750.74s: make the primary return in my core
1752.90s: allocation that's great and I'll run
1755.78s: that at the smallest size I need in
1758.78s: order to maintain my track to the annual
1761.72s: Target and then the speculative
1763.82s: allocation really comes down to
1765.32s: opportunity if I see opportunity I
1769.28s: always keep a portion of the portfolio
1771.68s: open to speculative plays but if I see a
1775.16s: lot of opportunity coming up I'll open
1777.32s: up more of the allocation to the
1778.82s: speculative place so like if we're going
1780.14s: through an earnings cycle for example I
1783.26s: have way more speculative trades on
1784.76s: during that time frame than I typically
1786.50s: would and it's because I I need a lot of
1789.14s: occurrences in order for variance risk
1791.18s: premiums to pay me out appropriately and
1793.28s: to withstre withstand you know the
1795.02s: eventual drawdowns forgive me for for
1797.60s: speculating but I actually like I I know
1801.38s: I can tell that you're like very very
1803.12s: intelligent so I I love this because
1806.30s: um yeah I I just love like like picking
1808.58s: your brain and speaking to you about
1810.50s: this when you say
1812.48s: um speculative in the money like a
1814.28s: speculative place are you referring more
1816.62s: so to like buying like in the money call
1819.14s: options and that's that's been leading
1822.14s: um has that been like one of the main
1823.46s: drivers of like the 30 return that
1826.82s: you're that you're currently tracking
1828.14s: for or is there something else that this
1831.08s: year has significantly contributed to um
1834.08s: to like the out performance that you've
1835.94s: experienced
1837.08s: definitely the ratio diagonals so and
1839.96s: it's the ratio diagonals are funny that
1842.78s: way in that they obviously offer you
1846.26s: know directional leverage and there's
1848.90s: been no shortage of movers this year so
1852.62s: I think that that's been a pretty
1854.54s: significant portion of it and then also
1856.52s: just the prevailing variance risk
1858.86s: premiums on this year have been pretty
1860.72s: fat at least fatter than we saw last
1863.12s: year which has allowed pretty reasonable
1868.16s: performance and then the other thing in
1870.38s: addition to all of that
1871.94s: is you know when I'm trading box spreads
1874.52s: now you really you have the ability to
1877.70s: double dip money so if I have cash
1879.86s: allocated to the covered strangle
1882.14s: because again the broker they don't care
1883.88s: but I track it personally I need to know
1886.10s: where the money's going and so I'll I'll
1889.28s: have the money allocated to iwm covered
1891.92s: strangle but then I can still put it in
1894.86s: something like a box spread and make a
1897.20s: meaningful return on the money whereas
1899.18s: you know during covid and really when I
1901.52s: first started the YouTube channel I
1903.32s: wasn't doing many of that right because
1904.88s: rates were near zero you you they would
1907.46s: almost ask you to pay them to take your
1909.86s: money so it's just like yeah this is a
1911.54s: complete waste of time but I think those
1914.00s: three things coalescing together have
1916.64s: really led to a very productive year and
1918.62s: there hasn't been like any sort of giant
1922.30s: sharp moves and that's generally what
1926.18s: slows me down is if one of those occurs
1928.46s: and I get stuck in the middle and I have
1930.02s: to work my way out but most of the time
1932.06s: I'm very careful with positioning and
1934.34s: watching Market breath so for the last
1936.80s: two and a half weeks I've been net short
1938.96s: Deltas in iwm which is rare for me
1941.72s: normally I I have some sort of bullish
1943.70s: trade in there but I've essentially
1945.38s: rotated the position from a covered
1948.14s: strangle I just had cash secured puts
1949.94s: out and I turned it into a ratio put
1953.12s: diagonal because I just saw overall
1955.40s: breath changing and kind of following
1957.56s: the market Trend so the fact that the
1959.12s: Market's rolling in these Cycles is
1961.52s: actually really good for me it I can
1963.26s: trade those very effectively
1965.00s: and one huge advantage of collecting
1967.34s: premium and selling options is that
1969.14s: especially now where you have short-term
1971.24s: rates at about five and a half percent
1972.74s: you can collect that premium and then
1975.50s: reinvest it in short-term t-bills or
1977.72s: Bonds in like in three or six months and
1980.54s: then you can collect you know five or
1982.64s: six percent every single year which just
1985.04s: last year you were collecting like close
1986.54s: to zero so that's that's amazing and
1989.00s: then um that's spot on
1991.46s: and one more quick question about um
1993.62s: about your do you have like a Target
1995.48s: based exploration that you usually like
1997.94s: to uh that you that you typically like
2000.64s: to to trade around
2002.20s: yeah it obviously varies quite a bit so
2005.26s: if I'm trading variance risk premium
2007.12s: strategies those are so if I'm trading
2008.98s: like short straddles in SPX or if I'm
2011.38s: trading earnings those are all going to
2013.24s: be zero to four or five DT right if I'm
2017.08s: trading the covered strangle I have kind
2019.36s: of a chart that I use based on just
2022.90s: current implied volatility for iwm
2025.42s: trending compared to Historic volatility
2027.82s: and then how far we are off of near-term
2030.88s: Highs but for that it's generally
2033.34s: something between two weeks and 30 days
2036.64s: something like that in there and then
2038.86s: for the ratio diagonals the long leg is
2042.70s: pretty much always at least 90 DTE vast
2046.96s: majority of the time 180 plus and then
2049.36s: the short legs are typically around 20
2051.46s: DTE
2053.38s: awesome as far as my trading strategy I
2057.46s: primarily look at
2059.20s: look I have a watch list of about 10 to
2061.72s: 15 stocks and then I get comfortable
2063.58s: with their recent trading range and then
2065.80s: when something I believe is overbought
2068.14s: or oversold then if it's overbought then
2071.38s: I'll sell a call Credit spread that's
2073.66s: out of the money if it's overbought then
2076.12s: or if it's oversold then I'll sell a put
2078.34s: credit spread additionally I do like to
2081.70s: sell like one DTE options on the SPX and
2087.40s: um furthermore I I'm very big on
2089.68s: mitigating tail risk and reducing
2092.14s: overall portfolio volatility so
2093.82s: especially during times when vix is
2096.34s: trading below 15 and I think just a few
2098.32s: weeks ago it hit a low of about like 12
2100.24s: and a half
2101.86s: um you know during those times I will
2104.02s: load up on put options in order to that
2107.74s: will protect my portfolio for oftentimes
2109.96s: years to come and I know that it is very
2112.42s: expensive when you're actually making
2114.22s: that trade and buying like SPX that it's
2116.50s: like two or three years out but at the
2118.30s: same time it provides you with
2120.10s: protection when the vix is trading at
2122.26s: about 12 or 13 or even slightly higher
2124.42s: like 13 or 14 because you know that the
2127.54s: vix isn't always going to be trading
2128.98s: below 15 it can go from trading at 12 to
2131.98s: trading to 28 and like literally like
2134.32s: two or three days we've seen that
2135.88s: multiple times so that's basically my
2138.70s: strategy in a nutshell and that's
2140.44s: actually helped me um like during August
2143.38s: where the market I think it's still down
2145.12s: around like four percent
2147.46s: um you know I've actually like
2149.02s: outperformed the market by about five
2150.70s: percent in total where we're up this
2152.44s: year I think it's extremely extremely
2155.38s: important and you hinted at this not to
2158.74s: Chase
2160.02s: maximizing your gains because if you do
2162.94s: maximize your gains without taking into
2165.52s: account minimizing the tail risk then
2167.98s: you're always going to be at the whim of
2169.96s: the market and if the Market's going up
2171.94s: then you're going to be doing well but
2173.80s: the if the market pulls back and there's
2176.38s: a saying that the bull takes the stairs
2178.78s: up but the bear jumps out the window you
2181.24s: need to make sure that at all times
2182.86s: you're protected against the bear
2184.84s: jumping out the window and you don't
2186.94s: want to lose all of your hard-earned
2188.86s: gains if the market has like a March
2191.98s: 2020 because in March 2020 when the
2195.10s: market fell I think like 36 in 33 days
2197.70s: many people were forced to close out
2200.14s: their their positions only to then see
2202.66s: the market rebound and recoup all of its
2206.38s: all of its losses in just like two
2208.60s: months but if you were forced to close
2211.12s: out those positions because you traded
2212.86s: too large then that rebound is not going
2215.98s: to help you so slow and steady is
2218.14s: extremely extremely important
2220.36s: yeah and you bring up a bunch of good
2222.88s: points I agree with you specifically on
2225.64s: the idea of managing risk via size I
2229.00s: think I do think Traders get too wrapped
2231.88s: up in this idea of hedging and they're
2234.04s: afraid of variants and they're afraid of
2236.20s: risk and I think that that a lot of
2238.66s: times comes to their own detriment like
2240.88s: when I was going through the phase of
2243.10s: aggressively growing my portfolio I was
2245.44s: very frequently levered like naked
2247.42s: levered where if the market took a crap
2249.82s: I would have been in huge huge trouble
2252.24s: if I did nothing but that's kind of the
2255.88s: beauty of trading options is when we
2258.46s: would inevitably get these kinds of down
2260.38s: moves there's so many products in so
2263.20s: many ways that we can start offsetting
2265.66s: risk very quickly once it starts hitting
2268.12s: metrics so I agree with you there
2269.68s: specifically on the idea of controlling
2272.32s: risk and even if you're levered right
2274.96s: that's you can't be levered without
2277.78s: controlling risk otherwise you are going
2280.78s: to blow up it is literally just a matter
2282.58s: of time before a move happens that
2284.62s: you're not ready for and then you are in
2286.96s: a giant giant problem one of the things
2289.42s: I wanted to ask you is you were saying
2290.74s: that you're hedging your portfolio with
2294.04s: SPX puts and I'm curious why do you use
2297.46s: that as compared to something like vix
2300.34s: or like vix futures or something
2303.46s: I primarily like SPX because it offsets
2307.00s: some of the zero and one DTE trades that
2309.16s: I make so from a portfolio margin
2311.38s: perspective it does help with with that
2315.58s: um additionally with vix because from my
2319.00s: understanding of vix it's essentially
2320.38s: like a math equation where you know that
2323.02s: iFix is trading at 30 then it's only a
2325.12s: matter of time where it's going to then
2327.04s: contract and there's going to be a
2328.96s: volatility crush more so to the mean I
2331.42s: actually one part of my strategy which I
2333.76s: really like doing is when vix is trading
2336.16s: over 30 I will sell calls on VIXX with
2340.72s: you know a 30 to 60 day or even 90 day
2343.36s: expiration but in general I I prefer
2347.10s: buying the SPX long dated options just
2350.80s: because it's something that one there's
2352.78s: a lot of liquidity also you can go as
2355.30s: far as like five years out and I just
2358.30s: it's just something that I feel
2359.74s: comfortable with I've been doing it for
2361.30s: a while and maybe it's just a habit but
2363.58s: you know you can you can definitely uh
2366.64s: you can definitely hedge with vix as
2368.26s: well because but also remember that when
2370.42s: you are when you're buying those puts in
2373.30s: in SPX there is obviously like a large
2376.36s: vix component because the option pricing
2379.12s: is going to be factored in and the vix
2381.10s: measures the volatility on the SPX so
2384.10s: whether you're hedging with vix or
2386.56s: you're hedging with SPX or spy it's very
2390.28s: it's extremely highly correlated
2392.62s: yeah definitely and that's actually why
2394.24s: I bring it up because for for people
2396.64s: that are buying really long-term
2398.26s: protection you know against the
2399.82s: portfolio if you're beta weighting your
2401.20s: Deltas going with volatility a lot of
2404.32s: times again to your point if the vix is
2407.50s: elevated it's not a great time you're
2408.94s: already too late but if the vix is not
2411.34s: elevated at that point it's actually uh
2414.28s: I I would say a more efficient trade
2416.86s: than going with long SPX puts and it's
2420.34s: specifically because if you buy SPX puts
2424.24s: let's say you know SPX is trading at uh
2428.58s: 43.87 right now and let's say over the
2431.68s: next four months it Trends up it Trends
2434.68s: up it Trends up it Trends up now the
2437.74s: deductible on your puts are it's now
2440.50s: massive because the distance between
2443.08s: where you entered and where it is now is
2444.58s: very different whereas that's kind of
2446.26s: the beauty if you use vix volatility of
2448.66s: some sort if you're beta weighting your
2450.10s: Deltas because as you know if you get in
2452.56s: in when vix is 15. if the market trends
2456.16s: up Trends up Trends up the vix is still
2457.90s: at 15 maybe 14 maybe 13. right yeah
2460.90s: there's always going to be a fourth
2462.16s: especially like maybe the before the
2465.64s: floor is going to be like around 12 I
2466.96s: mean I I've heard the vix has gone below
2469.24s: 10 but it's never there for an extended
2471.34s: period of time yep exactly and so it's
2474.10s: just I found that that actually adds a
2476.92s: lot of
2478.24s: um efficiency behind the Hedge because
2481.06s: then you don't have to keep sliding it
2482.68s: up and eating a loss in order to
2484.54s: maintain your deductible on the puts
2486.22s: especially if they're longer term so
2488.26s: yeah just throwing you know ideas out
2490.18s: there because I I tested both of them
2491.68s: pretty extensively and in general I
2494.14s: actually really prefer the vex
2500.10s: okay so Vic's Futures and you would
2503.38s: prefer Vic's Futures as opposed to
2505.00s: buying long dated vix calls like in the
2507.58s: money calls you do either yeah I I would
2510.94s: argue either is completely fine it
2512.56s: really just comes down to the size that
2514.18s: you're trading and you know
2515.92s: um what kind of protection you're
2518.02s: wanting to outlay for and I also one of
2521.20s: the other things that I do talk to
2522.46s: people about if you if we do use vix
2525.34s: options specifically calls is you can
2528.64s: even enhance your risk profile pretty
2531.40s: significantly if you start with in the
2533.38s: money calls to your point that will
2535.18s: provide the primary hedge but that you
2537.34s: can add some some teeny options some
2539.38s: kickers that are really far out of the
2540.94s: money they're low extrinsic value
2542.68s: anyways right so Theta Decay is going to
2544.54s: be inherently slower no matter what days
2547.06s: to expiration and being far out of the
2548.74s: money but then those can compound really
2551.68s: quickly and they can actually pay out
2553.24s: like pretty damn nice in a big pullback
2555.88s: so so yeah I think combining both of
2558.34s: those is actually really slick those
2560.74s: would basically be like lottery tickets
2562.36s: right
2564.16s: um not in this instance so much like
2565.96s: they they're really a hedge but to your
2568.48s: point
2570.34s: we are just connected oh let me pause
2575.86s: all right we got disconnected quickly
2577.96s: the you know I guess Zoom got too
2579.58s: excited about us talking about vix calls
2581.50s: but uh we're back at it yeah so my
2584.68s: question was when Eric was discussing
2586.84s: like buying those um so I'm assuming
2589.48s: like those out of the money fixed calls
2591.76s: then they would essentially act as like
2593.44s: lottery tickets is that correct yeah
2595.90s: it's it's I guess it depends on what we
2598.48s: mean by lottery tickets but yeah it
2600.82s: would serve as a highly compounding
2605.02s: portion of your hedge is the way I would
2607.30s: think about it so if the vix is trading
2610.24s: down at 13 and then you buy let's say
2613.72s: you know
2614.80s: um we could look at the actually the vix
2616.84s: right now and so if we go out 238 days
2621.76s: and you buy some teeny options that are
2624.34s: down at like uh you know 10 Delta if
2628.12s: you're gonna pay you what like
2632.26s: a few dollars if that but if you get the
2635.74s: move that we're trying to protect
2637.84s: against those obviously compound very
2641.08s: quickly so they can in a big move they
2644.86s: can actually really enhance your overall
2646.96s: hedge but to your point I still think
2649.00s: the primary portion of that hedge is
2650.68s: going to come from the deep in the money
2651.94s: because that's going to move dollar for
2653.62s: dollar faster so whenever I'm hedging
2656.56s: with something like that I almost always
2658.96s: add the Teeny options because they're
2660.88s: cheap enough and if you can get the
2662.86s: compounding they pay for themselves for
2664.66s: the next four times you run them but
2667.00s: yeah
2668.26s: and then for our viewers if you are
2670.96s: going to trade the future I believe that
2673.30s: you would have to trade forward slash
2675.40s: vix and if you're going to buy the
2678.82s: option I think that the preferred way
2680.98s: would be to trade VXX is that accurate
2684.04s: or am I incorrect so for vix Futures it
2687.82s: depends on your platform but for like
2689.32s: thinkorswim it's forward slash VX not
2691.42s: vix okay and then for options you could
2695.74s: use VXX or you can use vix it really
2698.50s: depends on your preference between the
2700.60s: product tracking I think I've had good
2704.14s: success with both of them the other
2706.66s: thing you can do that I've gotten kind
2708.22s: of cheeky with before and if you want to
2709.90s: be efficient is you can use a levered
2712.06s: ETF the downside of that yeah
2715.98s: exactly the downside of that is there is
2719.62s: drag but the drag on those returns it's
2723.52s: so overplayed by people that completely
2726.04s: write it off as you can't ever hold
2728.02s: these for longer than a week because the
2729.88s: drag is so bad and it's really not that
2731.86s: drag simply materializes as tracking
2734.98s: error so if it says if it's you know
2736.96s: three times levered the move you get is
2739.24s: like 2.6 times not quite that three
2741.52s: times that's the drag you see so yeah
2744.22s: it's just another way to do it for uvxy
2747.16s: and svxy I think they actually like
2748.92s: reconstituted or recalculated it on like
2752.20s: February 5th or February 6 like 2018
2754.48s: because I remember I was flying to
2757.24s: Cartagena Colombia with my wife and then
2759.48s: those like the I forget whether it was
2762.46s: uvxy or SPX I think it was spxy it
2765.22s: basically like blew up it went from like
2767.46s: 140 to like 12 in like an afternoon in
2770.86s: like four hours
2772.48s: um so yeah so yeah like using those but
2775.66s: yeah now it's a lot more stable and I
2778.00s: think that the drag is is less but I I'm
2780.82s: definitely going to I definitely
2782.62s: appreciate
2783.94s: um your thoughts because I know that
2785.08s: you've done like a lot of research on
2787.06s: the pros and cons of SPX versus vix and
2791.26s: I think just without without me like
2793.66s: doing a lot of research it just it does
2795.76s: make a lot of inherent and intuitive
2798.40s: sense where you know that the vix if
2800.98s: it's at 15 yes maybe it drops to about
2803.50s: 12 but you know it's not going to drop
2805.54s: to about like six or seven whereas with
2808.84s: the stock market you actually don't
2810.40s: necessarily know where the bottom is
2812.74s: going to be so you are inherently
2815.26s: protected if you buy those in the money
2817.90s: elongated vix calls because you know
2820.96s: that like if you buy it around 14 then
2824.26s: you're buying close to
2826.56s: relatively close to the bottom even if
2828.82s: it drops like 12 and a half like it did
2830.68s: a few weeks ago but right now it was
2832.12s: trading at about 17. yep that's exactly
2835.24s: right and the beauty is as we know the
2838.06s: market exhibits positive drift it's just
2840.64s: way more efficient because you don't
2842.20s: have to keep managing it to you know
2844.60s: manage your deductible when I'm saying
2846.16s: you know for the viewers when I'm saying
2847.84s: manage the deductible again if if you
2850.00s: buy puts for a hundred dollars when you
2852.10s: know spy is trading at 110 just for
2854.20s: Simplicity and the Spy now rallies up to
2858.06s: 190. well the protective power of those
2861.28s: puts has decreased exponentially you
2863.86s: have a huge drop and they're now a giant
2866.56s: loss so you have to roll them up to
2868.96s: maintain your protection and it's
2870.88s: expensive because you're doing it at a
2872.44s: loss outlaying more money so it's a way
2874.96s: to go around that but it is important to
2877.90s: understand that it is different right so
2880.00s: if you're trading products making sure
2882.28s: that you're tracking the tracking error
2884.74s: because if you do use vix calls for
2886.78s: example the Spy can have a four percent
2889.36s: drop and the vix calls might not even
2892.18s: respond they might not even wait up so
2895.24s: the idea of using the you know options
2898.38s: especially iFix is already elevated the
2901.60s: market can drop like four percent over a
2903.70s: week and you can see VIXX not even move
2905.62s: at all
2907.02s: exactly right it happened a lot last
2909.40s: year where Vicks was trading like close
2911.32s: to 40 and then the market would you know
2913.36s: yeah yeah so and that's why it's
2916.18s: important it's not like a one-size-fits
2918.34s: all always do this but it is if you're
2921.04s: looking for protection it's like the
2922.72s: same thing right like the best time to
2924.58s: get a roof repaired is when it's not
2926.14s: raining same exact thing when you're
2927.82s: buying portfolio protection
2930.04s: another advantage that I can see is
2932.08s: because of the low cost of vix you can
2934.84s: get much more granular where you don't
2937.18s: necessarily have to spend thousands of
2938.92s: dollars on SPX or even like hundreds of
2941.26s: dollars on spy because iFix if it trades
2944.56s: at like you know 12 or 13 then it allows
2947.62s: you and affords you the opportunity to
2949.24s: be more granular and to hedge off some
2951.70s: of the risk
2953.08s: um and um you know without without
2954.88s: investing tons of money on like SPX or
2957.94s: even spy yeah and I and I honestly I
2960.94s: normally turn it into kind of its own
2962.50s: little trade like if I'm buying let's
2964.30s: say for example deep in the money vix
2965.92s: calls I'll sell short calls against it
2968.68s: in vix shorter term time frame I just
2970.78s: keep it at a ratio right because
2972.04s: otherwise you get rid of your protection
2973.54s: you're fighting yourself but it is a
2976.00s: really again easy way to kind of
2977.80s: subsidize some of the long-term holding
2979.54s: costs of it and to your point if we're
2982.06s: doing it right we're going like 80 Delta
2983.86s: plus we're super far in the money Theta
2986.08s: Decay is small overall Theta extrinsic
2989.14s: value of the options is small so you
2991.54s: don't necessarily have to do a bunch of
2992.98s: short call campaigns to cover a
2994.66s: meaningful portion of the cost you just
2996.88s: have to be super careful to do it at a
2998.26s: ratio otherwise you cap your upside
2999.88s: potential or even induce upside risk
3002.52s: that's not good right because now you're
3004.44s: literally just losing on your primary
3006.00s: position losing on your hedge we've now
3007.86s: just completely undone that
3009.84s: and when you sell the out of the money
3011.88s: calls on the the long calls that you on
3015.06s: the long and the money calls I'm
3016.62s: assuming that you're going like
3018.00s: somewhere like 7 or 14 days out right in
3020.40s: order to feel like something okay that
3021.84s: makes a lot of sense yup that's exactly
3023.76s: right so essentially what I'm doing is
3025.44s: I'm just turning it into a ratio called
3027.00s: diagonal and just using the offsetting
3029.10s: Deltas the manage broader beta weighted
3031.68s: portfolio risk is
3033.84s: and you know the interesting part of
3035.40s: that is because the Deltas are so
3037.98s: different where you're buying the you're
3040.86s: buying the high Delta in the money fall
3042.66s: you can actually sell a little bit more
3044.58s: out of the money calls I wouldn't go
3046.50s: crazy with that but if you let's say you
3048.78s: bought like five in the money calls you
3051.48s: can actually probably sell like eight
3054.30s: maybe maximum of 10 with a shorter
3056.46s: duration because you know that if vix
3058.86s: spikes up you're going to profit dollar
3060.36s: for Dollar on the long calls whereas
3062.88s: you're not going to lose nearly as much
3064.44s: on the out of the money calls that you
3066.78s: sold so um yeah yeah that's interesting
3069.78s: I definitely would consider that to be
3071.64s: ultra risky in the concept of a hedge
3074.16s: right because then we definitely would
3075.90s: induce upside risk but it's a standalone
3077.82s: position I think that could absolutely
3079.74s: work just fine
3081.90s: what are um what are some mistakes that
3084.30s: you see new Traders make
3087.06s: uh I think it's two two things pretty
3089.46s: simply I think the first one is
3090.78s: approaching trading as a hobby and then
3093.06s: the second one I think is having busted
3095.88s: up expectations like we all start with
3097.74s: right we all want to get rich fast and
3100.14s: that reads typically leads to getting
3102.60s: poor fast it does not work well with the
3105.18s: markets and then definitely I I think
3107.82s: trading is probably one of the worst
3109.98s: possible Endeavors to approach it as a
3112.62s: hobby it is nothing but uh pretty sure
3115.80s: fire way to lose money
3118.32s: I think for me
3120.30s: um to kind of echo what you said I think
3122.16s: sizing is really important and also
3125.06s: expectations I mean we all see on
3127.38s: YouTube where you have a bunch of
3129.42s: creators who try to create clickbait and
3132.06s: say that they can turn like 500 into
3134.10s: like five million dollars and when you
3137.04s: have someone who's like really young and
3139.38s: they have a little bit of money
3141.48s: it it attracts them and they think that
3143.82s: they're going to be able to buy some
3145.38s: like some really far out of the money
3147.36s: call options on Meme stocks and turn
3149.52s: like 500 into fifty thousand dollars but
3152.10s: I think that it's very important for
3154.14s: people to play the long game and to
3156.84s: build really good habits and I'm sure
3158.58s: you know that you would probably agree
3160.50s: especially as someone who went to the
3162.66s: Marines where habits are are basically
3165.06s: everything like they tell you that you
3166.56s: have to make your bed that you're that
3169.08s: things have to be spotless because they
3171.24s: want to groom you to make sure that they
3173.28s: create the that they mold you into a
3176.34s: great person in the future as well and
3179.04s: if you're the type of person as a new
3180.54s: Trader who's going to take low
3182.10s: probability trades that has an expected
3184.68s: probability of profit that's going to be
3186.24s: significantly negative then you're not
3189.42s: really teaching yourself anything
3190.62s: instead you might as well you'd probably
3192.54s: have a better time playing blackjack or
3194.94s: roulette at the casino as opposed to you
3197.52s: know gambling in the stock market
3199.56s: I agree with you and I and I think that
3202.02s: I like to say habits are who you are if
3204.60s: you have somebody who's undisciplined in
3206.70s: their diet I can guarantee you if you
3208.80s: look at their life their own disciplined
3210.36s: in other areas the same thing for
3211.80s: trading like if somebody is an
3214.02s: undisciplined Trader I can look at other
3216.06s: aspects and probably identify where
3218.52s: they're also not I do think the idea you
3222.42s: know
3224.40s: the idea of integrating different payout
3227.16s: profiles I think has been one of the
3228.96s: most important things and this actually
3230.88s: something would be fascinating to kind
3232.62s: of understand more of your perspective
3233.88s: on because when I was trading a lot of
3236.40s: vertical spreads
3238.44s: I did not make a lot of money like
3240.84s: especially after including costs it was
3244.02s: a lot of work and not a lot of payout
3246.78s: and I think one of the things that I
3249.18s: would encourage option Traders
3251.58s: specifically to do is to not fall in
3254.46s: love with buying or selling Theta gang
3257.94s: or Vega like don't get too wrapped up in
3261.24s: an individual Camp because if one style
3264.60s: of options trading had an inherent Edge
3267.36s: that was extractable long term
3272.78s: and I like that you integrated you know
3275.76s: because like I know that you were
3276.84s: talking about trading spreads a little
3278.16s: bit in verticals and it's definitely not
3280.02s: my go-to but it can be done successfully
3282.36s: and I also like that you integrate ideas
3285.00s: of creating a range right because now
3287.40s: you're overlaying some discretionary
3288.96s: components to it that absolutely can
3291.54s: increase our our efficacy but
3294.12s: I I'm curious what has kept you with
3297.18s: vertical spreads versus kind of
3300.06s: venturing into other stuff
3301.98s: well I think that would spreads I
3303.78s: actually don't I would choose a strike
3305.82s: on the short put side where I actually
3307.20s: don't mind taking ownership of it so on
3310.38s: one of my accounts I'm using portfolio
3311.88s: margin so I could trade a little bit
3313.62s: larger and then in the worst case
3315.42s: scenario because I'm trading on very
3318.30s: highly liquid large cap stocks like
3320.70s: Amazon where if I sold a spread on
3323.04s: Amazon let's say it's like 90 by 80 and
3326.34s: I know that last year Amazon hit a low
3328.74s: of like 82. in that situation I'll
3331.44s: actually take ownership and go long
3333.24s: Amazon just because I feel like you know
3335.64s: on a net basis being long Amazon at 88
3338.76s: where just like a few months earlier I
3340.92s: was trading at like 185 then I think
3343.86s: that the risk to reward from the upside
3346.08s: perspective is pretty damn good so I'll
3349.80s: sell spreads and then I actually don't
3351.48s: mind taking ownership of it and also
3353.64s: because I will sell spreads on things
3355.86s: that I perceive to be oversold than the
3358.68s: implied volatility rank on that specific
3361.02s: underlying is actually hired because you
3363.66s: know the stock has fallen from where it
3365.76s: was previously trading so therefore I'll
3367.74s: collect a little bit more premium and I
3370.92s: would say spreads comprise about like 30
3374.10s: to 40 percent you know similar to you I
3376.62s: will integrate different strategies
3379.08s: based upon like where volatility is how
3382.20s: much credit I'm receiving
3384.24s: Etc so I think it's just one of the
3387.00s: strategies that I'll use but it's not
3389.34s: something that but I agree with you
3390.78s: especially during periods when
3392.04s: volatility is low and if you're using
3394.50s: regulation T margin and if you're
3396.96s: trading something which you know which
3399.54s: is a pretty narrow spread then
3401.04s: oftentimes if you're picking up like 25
3403.14s: cents or 25 dollars for every contract
3406.38s: that you sell you know when you factor
3408.00s: in commissions oftentimes it's not
3410.04s: really worth doing so you have to make
3411.96s: sure that you have multiple strategies
3413.76s: at your disposal
3415.38s: yeah I agree with that and I also like
3418.14s: the fact that you trade spread
3419.84s: semi-discretionally and directionally
3421.62s: also makes a little bit more sense to me
3423.66s: in terms of just including a floor
3425.46s: because I see people who trade you know
3428.28s: the Theta gangers they trade verticals
3430.44s: and I tried to like conceptualize why
3434.46s: this would make any sense because their
3436.02s: whole premises were selling premium
3439.26s: because it's overpriced and it's high
3441.48s: logical but then
3443.88s: then they're buying it they're buying
3445.92s: the very thing that they're selling
3447.12s: because it's hot and they're buying
3448.86s: something that's too expensive then so
3450.78s: that part confuses me a little bit but I
3453.30s: see definitely more of the way that
3455.22s: you're employing it it's it's
3456.18s: interesting to me
3457.86s: you know one of my close friends on on
3459.60s: YouTube he's kind of against like using
3462.90s: any type of discretion in your trading
3465.78s: um and I never necessarily understood
3467.70s: that it's kind of like oftentimes people
3469.92s: think that and this kind of goes into
3471.42s: what we were discussing earlier or like
3474.00s: on on email and we're going to touch on
3475.86s: it in this call as well about like Ai
3477.72s: and Bots I do think that it is important
3480.30s: to have some discretion in your trading
3483.12s: because if if you don't have any
3486.06s: discretion then just like you said
3487.56s: you're really not going to be collecting
3489.54s: that much premium and you're not going
3491.64s: to be able to know when to allocate and
3494.10s: when to use different strategies based
3496.20s: upon the market conditions so I know
3498.60s: that discretionary trading or you know
3501.06s: using different strategies at your
3502.50s: discretion can oftentimes be looked down
3504.42s: upon but I think that it's worthwhile
3507.36s: you know if you have something like um
3509.64s: like earlier today I made a trade on
3511.86s: BlackRock because BlackRock it was
3514.68s: trading you know at one point it was
3516.48s: trading over 900 and recently it's been
3519.30s: trading around 670. so I think that
3521.88s: selling a put a vertical credit spread
3524.16s: with like a 520 by like 460 is not that
3527.58s: bad considering that in the worst case
3529.26s: scenario I can roll that position into a
3532.20s: naked if I wanted to take ownership roll
3534.72s: it down to like 460 and then simply take
3537.00s: ownership of like 100 or 200 shares and
3540.06s: I think that from a long-term
3542.10s: perspective that's not necessarily a bad
3544.44s: trade considering that I would be able
3545.94s: to take ownership of BlackRock at less
3548.82s: than 50 percent of where some people had
3551.22s: previously purchased it but you know we
3553.74s: don't know like BlackRock can fall below
3555.42s: 300 but I think that statistically the
3558.00s: odds of you know of taking ownership and
3561.66s: owning BlackRock at like 460 to 480
3564.00s: that's not it that's not a bad trade
3566.88s: well I also think that's the whole point
3568.62s: of you doing the spread right because it
3571.38s: in it includes some sort of risk
3573.30s: management inherent because to your
3574.68s: point like if you wanted to if you were
3576.84s: creating it as a cash secured put you
3578.82s: wouldn't put the spread you would just
3580.26s: trade you would make more money but I
3583.56s: think that by you trading those kinds of
3585.96s: things that spread at least gives you
3587.82s: some optionality and to your friend's
3589.92s: point I find that fascinating because
3592.38s: I think
3594.72s: without discretion in trading there is
3598.38s: essentially no Alpha like I don't I
3600.84s: don't see a retail available automated
3604.80s: trading approach that can produce Alpha
3607.74s: I I'm open to it I would love to I
3609.78s: genuinely would love I would pay for it
3611.82s: if it existed but I genuinely do not
3615.30s: believe that that's going to exist
3617.70s: probably at all and it's again as soon
3620.58s: as that exists I would buy it I would
3624.24s: lever it and then that's it I would I'm
3627.30s: not so attached to the art of trading
3629.46s: what I tell people is like I'm a
3631.44s: businessman first I'm here to make money
3634.26s: so if there's something that can make
3636.90s: money more efficiently than I can I
3638.70s: wouldn't be like oh but this is what I
3640.50s: do and this is what like grew all of
3643.38s: that if there is this non-discretionary
3646.32s: system that is reliably profitable I
3649.50s: would 100 use it so yeah that's it's
3652.32s: interesting but
3654.12s: also to your friend's point and the
3655.92s: reason why discretionary trading gets
3657.54s: looked at down on a lot I think is
3659.82s: because there's there's levels to think
3662.10s: right like if you do Jiu Jitsu there are
3664.32s: certain moves that are looked down upon
3666.30s: for new people and it's because they
3668.04s: dork it up all the time but for the
3670.32s: seasoned people they do it all the time
3672.24s: because it's effective I find the same
3674.28s: thing with discretionary trading the
3675.66s: reason why I think it's looked down on
3678.06s: is because most Traders take that to the
3680.40s: extreme or they're just shooting from
3682.26s: the hit man like they have no plan they
3683.94s: have no logs they have no way of
3685.44s: tracking and optimizing and then they
3687.36s: wonder why they fail so yeah it's it's a
3690.30s: really fascinating part of trading I
3692.34s: think
3693.54s: I think I grew through 100 and I wish
3696.80s: that someone would prove me wrong and
3699.60s: maybe in the future
3701.04s: um we will be proven wrong that they'll
3703.20s: be able to remove the discretion from it
3704.64s: but I don't think that it's where it is
3707.22s: right now where you can program a bot or
3710.16s: an AI and we'll we'll talk about this a
3711.84s: little bit later but I don't think that
3713.76s: Ai and Bots and removing all the
3716.46s: discretion is where it is was where it
3720.00s: needs to be right now in order to have
3722.64s: it produce Alpha and I do believe that
3725.22s: some of the reasons why people want to
3727.02s: remove the discretion from their trading
3729.30s: is because if you remove all the
3731.52s: discretion and then the trade goes
3732.90s: against you then suddenly it's not your
3735.06s: fault it's the fault of the rules or the
3738.18s: fault of the bot but suddenly like
3740.94s: you're absolved from any responsibility
3742.74s: oh it's not my fault it's the bot it's
3745.44s: you know it's the robot it's the the
3747.66s: rules that I programmed it with so you
3749.76s: know hey if you want to earn Alpha if
3751.68s: you want to make money then I do believe
3754.02s: that taking personal responsibility and
3756.18s: owning it and educating yourself and
3758.28s: making the right decisions is probably
3759.84s: your best way of actually achieving that
3762.06s: and I think what you said earlier before
3764.10s: we started recording also holds really
3766.80s: true here is like who doesn't want easy
3769.20s: money like I want easy money like that
3772.32s: sound it really sounds good to me so the
3774.72s: idea of being able to program rules into
3776.64s: a bot and let it go make money for you
3778.50s: it sounds very easy and it's I think the
3780.78s: idea of like these rules based or
3783.18s: systems based trading it's so funny it's
3785.88s: nefarious because it sounds really
3788.22s: intellectual it sounds so smart why
3790.98s: wouldn't she want to cut out the human
3792.36s: emotion why wouldn't you want to cut out
3794.28s: the variance in your execution like that
3796.92s: sounds super smart to me but
3799.26s: unfortunately that last part where we
3802.32s: actually applied discretion again in my
3804.48s: opinion that's where Alpha is otherwise
3807.36s: I would program the same exact robot man
3809.84s: yeah a few things before we wrap up I
3813.30s: want to talk about
3814.68s: um zero DTE I want to briefly talk about
3817.32s: although we kind of already did like
3819.90s: um Ai and Bots but we can touch upon
3821.82s: that a little bit and then you have a
3823.86s: very unique
3825.00s: um perspective which I didn't used to
3827.40s: agree with but now I do agree with about
3829.38s: rolling so I also want to share that
3831.72s: with the audience can you share with me
3833.58s: like your thoughts about like zero and
3836.04s: one DTE Trading
3838.56s: yeah
3840.48s: um it's a
3842.94s: it's a tricky place to operate so in in
3846.24s: short
3847.38s: there are a lot of opportunities in that
3850.02s: space in Long the vast majority of
3853.44s: retail Traders lose money in that space
3855.54s: and it's not what I always encourage
3858.06s: people to check out is ssrn it's a place
3861.54s: where you can find peer-reviewed studies
3863.58s: on all of this stuff because I have a
3867.12s: like really comprehensive data set at
3869.64s: this point to be honest because I've
3871.02s: been tracking for 15 years now however I
3875.04s: always encourage people like I'm just a
3876.78s: dude talking on the internet you in no
3879.12s: way should take what I say as some sort
3882.54s: of law you should look up peer-reviewed
3885.60s: work on this stuff and there's some
3888.00s: really really really great zero DTE SPX
3892.22s: studies on this exact thing and I have a
3894.96s: couple videos that talk about it but the
3897.06s: punch line is once you get through
3900.00s: essentially when zero DTE options were
3902.70s: launched which was what 11 May 21 or 22
3906.24s: and after that time frame when we had
3909.66s: daily expirations essentially and in
3912.60s: that time frame retail Traders were
3914.58s: profitable net fees for about four
3917.10s: months and then once we look both net
3921.36s: and gross p l it's huge down huge down
3925.88s: so I think that it's an interesting
3928.86s: place to play there's a lot of slop in
3931.92s: the pricing which is something that I
3933.96s: don't think retail Traders fully
3935.22s: appreciate
3936.26s: isn't a lot of the reasons why and I
3939.00s: think I've read some of the research
3940.14s: reports a lot of in my understanding
3942.42s: please correct me if I'm wrong because
3943.62s: you're more educated about this than I
3945.42s: am but a lot of it has to do with the
3947.04s: slippage and the commissions that
3948.72s: comprise uh um the vast majority of
3951.18s: their losses is that accurate or am I
3953.58s: incorrect that's that that's exactly it
3955.98s: and so there's a study that's actually
3958.32s: like really recent that I like it's
3960.54s: called Retreat uh and I'll give you the
3962.88s: link to it too just so that people can
3964.38s: check it out but it's called Uh retail
3966.54s: Traders love zero DTE options but should
3969.60s: they and it's by Beck Mayer bringer and
3972.60s: geda this was done in 13 April 2023 and
3976.32s: it talks about literally quite literally
3978.68s: exactly what you just said because
3981.24s: retail Traders have actually gotten okay
3984.56s: at integrating aspects of volatility
3988.26s: assumptions into their trading which is
3990.96s: positively predicting that's a good
3992.88s: thing however even now
3996.06s: once you look at gross returns they're
3998.88s: not doing a good enough job at it so
4000.98s: they're getting that part wrong and then
4002.42s: once you add net we start adding the
4004.64s: fees it's massive massive daily losses I
4008.90s: think retail Traders using slim options
4010.94s: meaning those are that's I don't I'm not
4013.04s: sure if you're familiar with the the
4014.18s: process but it's like a price
4015.50s: improvement process for 10 Lots or less
4017.36s: so you can kind of typically identify
4019.16s: retail traders in that space and of
4021.92s: those options like there's a hundred and
4024.74s: thirty three thousand dollars being lost
4026.54s: every single day by retail traders in
4029.60s: zero DTE options doing that in the
4031.28s: aggregate so it's just a massive massive
4035.48s: Perpetual loss that they're facing so I
4037.88s: think they're good and I think they have
4039.44s: their place I like them but I always
4042.56s: remind people it is a minority of what I
4045.50s: do it might be five percent ten percent
4048.20s: maybe of my total volume but there's
4051.26s: opportunity but yeah it's very tricky
4054.34s: and what are your thoughts regarding
4056.66s: rolling I think this is very very
4058.88s: valuable
4060.92s: um rolling to me is it's fake it's a
4063.50s: fugazi it doesn't mean anything
4065.96s: um I think retail Traders essentially
4067.76s: deploy it as a way to avert losses
4070.58s: that's a giant behavior of retail
4072.98s: Traders has lost aversion and what I try
4075.68s: to explain to people is rolling is super
4077.54s: simple we close a trade
4080.36s: and we open up a brand new trade that's
4083.30s: what a role is we're simply attempting
4085.88s: to tie the accounting to one another but
4089.18s: none of that matters in any material way
4092.00s: your broker doesn't care your broker
4094.16s: includes it because you like it and
4096.44s: their job is to perform a service so
4098.96s: they're like retail Traders like the
4100.46s: idea of rolling options and sure it does
4102.44s: add some Simplicity here and there I
4104.42s: roll options to be very clear I roll
4106.46s: them but I am under no confusion that
4110.60s: typically when I'm rolling an option I
4112.28s: am closing a trade for a loss I am
4114.62s: realizing a loss and I'm opening up a
4117.38s: brand new one that could overwhelm the
4120.44s: loss of the previous trade but there's a
4122.54s: big difference between realized p l and
4125.48s: unrealized p l so yeah rolling trade
4128.54s: super simple closing a trade opening up
4130.40s: a new one
4131.36s: I think your video on Lost aversion and
4135.20s: rolling was one of the better videos on
4137.18s: option trading that I've seen in all of
4138.74s: YouTube and um oh I appreciate it I'm
4141.86s: definitely going to hopefully I remember
4143.72s: to link to that video in the in the
4146.36s: description
4147.62s: um because it was amazing I I definitely
4150.20s: think that rolling has a little bit to
4152.36s: do with people's ego where especially
4154.40s: when you're selling options and you know
4156.80s: hey I do it myself I'm like oh you could
4158.54s: win up to like 98 of your trades but the
4161.00s: reality is you have to be completely
4162.80s: comfortable
4163.82s: losing that two to five percent of your
4166.70s: trades and almost to counterbalance the
4170.72s: the the you know the psychological
4172.88s: dependency that we have or the
4174.32s: psychological fallacy that human beings
4176.18s: are are um cognitively biased towards
4178.94s: for the loss aversion it's almost like
4181.28s: we should seek we should be loss seeking
4184.34s: if we have a bad trade go against us to
4186.98s: counteract that loss aversion it's
4189.20s: almost in your best interest to be law
4191.30s: seeking where if you have something go
4192.86s: against you it's completely okay just to
4195.80s: close it out take a small loss and
4198.14s: recognize that you'll make it back on
4200.60s: your on your next Trace but where you
4203.48s: won't make it back is if you add
4205.64s: increased risk to that trade you
4207.44s: increase the number of puts or you
4209.00s: increase the number of calls if your
4210.68s: call side is challenged and then you
4212.42s: turn a small loss into a big loss
4214.70s: because you can still win 95 98 of your
4218.24s: trades but if that two to five percent
4220.40s: of your losses
4221.96s: are if they overwhelm your gains because
4225.38s: you didn't want to Simply accept that
4227.54s: loss then you can actually end up losing
4229.46s: money by trading options even if you
4231.50s: have a high win rate
4233.48s: it's it's such a powerful way to frame
4236.48s: it but I I couldn't frame that any
4239.66s: better myself that we should be seeking
4241.76s: long yeah
4244.64s: yeah the the way that I think about it
4246.68s: is the vast majority of successful
4248.96s: traders that I know they might win about
4251.66s: 50 if they're good the idea of these
4254.96s: really high win rates is exactly to your
4257.48s: point it appeals to two things it
4259.64s: appeals to Ego and it appeals to loss
4262.94s: aversion because we're scared of losing
4264.86s: Capital but what I try to remind people
4268.04s: is that I would rather win 51 of my
4271.10s: trades but manage risk well and have a
4273.86s: good return Then when ninety percent of
4276.62s: the trades and then after friction not
4278.06s: have any money to show for it I yeah
4280.58s: being being wrong quickly is a is a
4283.58s: really good methodology and the other
4285.08s: thing I'll add to that quickly is just
4287.24s: the way to kind of embrace that I think
4290.00s: is to not take losing trades as some
4293.06s: sort of like value assessment of you as
4296.12s: a human being if you have a losing trade
4298.16s: it doesn't make you a loser yeah you're
4300.50s: not a failure you're in a losing
4302.42s: position if you play basketball you're
4304.70s: gonna miss some shots it happens but the
4307.52s: idea is in aggregate does this make
4309.92s: sense do we have positive expected value
4311.78s: that's what matters
4313.40s: the big your video like I said before
4315.50s: was amazing and the biggest takeaway
4318.14s: that I took from your radio because you
4320.00s: really hit hard into like the the
4322.34s: fallacy the psychological dependency
4323.90s: upon lost aversion the biggest takeaway
4326.18s: that I took away from that video was man
4327.86s: I should really be risk seeking I should
4330.38s: actually lean into my losses and the
4333.32s: trades that I feel uncomfortable about
4335.00s: and which are showing me like a 3X loss
4338.24s: of like the credit received instead of
4340.34s: hoping that they're going to turn around
4342.50s: and that they're going to show me a
4343.88s: profit it's actually in my best interest
4346.22s: to just simply close them out and just
4349.28s: move on be loss seeking that was the
4352.40s: biggest takeaway that I took because
4353.84s: that's going you almost have to
4355.52s: overpower and over correct for the
4358.64s: inherent psychological Fallout protein
4360.86s: for the inherent psychological
4363.20s: um you know like whatever the word is
4364.88s: but the psychological fallacy that you
4367.22s: have to be lost to be loss of her loss
4370.52s: aversion you almost have to over correct
4372.56s: for that in order to over comment I
4375.02s: completely agree with you and it takes a
4376.70s: while because all of those undertones
4379.22s: exist and a lot of it comes from healthy
4381.86s: Detachment of capital all those kinds of
4383.90s: things but exactly to your point I I
4386.30s: have losing trades very frequently and
4388.34s: at no point do I look at them and say
4390.08s: this is it for me this is the end and a
4392.96s: big part of that is if you're sizing
4394.52s: trades efficiently and if you're
4396.86s: deploying in a broader system that has
4399.56s: positive expected Edge in the long run
4401.66s: losses are part of the game it's just it
4404.42s: is just part of the journey it's like
4405.74s: again if you do Jiu Jitsu you're gonna
4407.60s: get tapped out it's gonna happen you're
4409.58s: gonna lose but the idea is to get tapped
4412.04s: out quick enough so they don't break
4413.30s: anything and then you learn and move on
4416.48s: and the final thing which we touched
4418.52s: upon earlier regarding your thoughts for
4420.80s: like Ai and Bots and removing discretion
4424.52s: um you know I I Echo what you said
4426.56s: earlier where I just don't think I think
4428.78s: that everyone wants to make easy money
4430.28s: and they want to remove the discretion
4432.56s: they want to remove the decision making
4434.06s: process because therefore it's one less
4435.86s: decision they have to make because hey
4437.54s: look making decisions can be stressful
4439.22s: and we're all overwhelmed and overworked
4441.26s: but I don't think that right now now I
4444.86s: can't tell the future so maybe in the
4446.36s: future the technology will improve or
4448.70s: the you know what you can do with with
4450.92s: building out the bot Etc might
4452.72s: potentially improve but in my opinion I
4455.24s: just don't think that that it's
4456.80s: worthwhile right now and you made a
4458.36s: great point when you said that the alpha
4461.06s: is in the discretion and in the
4464.00s: decision-making process so um what are
4467.30s: your you know I kind of summarize it but
4469.28s: do you have anything to add yeah no I
4471.38s: think you nailed it I think it's
4472.52s: important for retail traders to respect
4474.74s: and understand how professionals and
4477.62s: institutions operate but part of that is
4480.92s: to clearly understand the difference in
4482.54s: our in our structure so one of the big
4484.82s: things that institutions and that
4486.80s: includes market makers in this kind of
4488.48s: parlance is they they have a giant
4491.48s: leverage benefit that that we don't have
4494.06s: and we'll never see and essentially that
4496.46s: allows them to offset a lot of risk as
4498.86s: they're making books and as they're
4500.84s: managing their broader book and
4503.00s: obviously they have much much less
4505.28s: friction than we do so the idea of high
4508.04s: frequency trading or Arbitrage where
4510.44s: we're finding things that are mispriced
4512.12s: and then pricing them back in it's
4514.16s: accessible to those people for those
4516.68s: reasons and I actually think it's good
4519.02s: for retail traders to try to mimic
4521.90s: what's successful if you want to be good
4524.18s: at Jiu Jitsu you should look at what
4526.10s: Gordon Ryan is doing and try to pick up
4528.14s: something it's the same thing for retail
4530.24s: Traders however
4532.64s: you're not Gordon Ryan right so like you
4535.04s: have to acknowledge some of the
4536.54s: differences between the two and I think
4537.86s: that's important for retail which is
4539.24s: exactly what you the idea of like
4541.34s: tinkering with and playing with AI or
4544.46s: automation parts of your trading is
4546.20s: smart I automate parts of my trading I
4548.42s: scan that's automation I plug in rules
4551.48s: that apply to my strategy to quickly
4554.00s: just run through a bunch of stuff to
4556.64s: reduce what I have to look at I automate
4558.74s: parts of what I Define opportunities but
4561.44s: then but at the end of the day you're
4562.88s: the one who is sifting through let's say
4565.22s: there were a thousand and then you use a
4566.84s: scan in order to narrow it down to like
4568.52s: 20 or 30 but then you choose what you
4570.68s: perceive to be the best like three or
4572.18s: four and then you make a trade out of it
4573.68s: right that's that's exactly it and one
4575.90s: of the things that yeah one of the
4578.12s: prevailing traits of successful traders
4580.16s: long term again I encourage you the
4581.72s: study is called
4582.92s: um the behavior of individual investors
4584.72s: it's an older one but it's fantastic and
4587.36s: one of the traits of successful Traders
4588.98s: is pattern recognition it's our capacity
4592.16s: to look at data long term and come up
4595.46s: with different assumptions and the cool
4597.38s: part about pattern recognition is once
4599.78s: you do it for long enough there's a
4602.60s: giant subconscious component to it where
4605.96s: you look at something and you might
4607.82s: consciously be saying okay the the
4609.38s: moving averages are doing this the
4610.70s: linear regression channels are doing
4611.78s: this but your mind is running through
4613.82s: the role at dexmat if you look through
4615.92s: thousands of charts it's overlaying and
4618.02s: looking for patterns subconsciously
4619.94s: which is such a powerful mechanism a lot
4622.22s: of times that manifests itself as Ah
4625.34s: that's the pit of my stomach I'm
4626.78s: following my gut here something feels
4628.52s: weird believe it or not your stomach is
4631.28s: not telling you jack that is the
4633.68s: subconscious processing part of your
4635.54s: mind that is just filing down tons of
4638.72s: information and giving you cues that you
4641.72s: may may or may not realize are there so
4643.64s: yeah pattern recognition is massive
4646.34s: I think pattern recognition is extremely
4648.68s: important in everything that you do if
4650.54s: you look at someone like LeBron James
4651.86s: one of the best basketball players ever
4653.60s: whether you think he's ahead of
4654.68s: Jordanian like one or two you know he's
4656.96s: he's one of the best if you if you
4659.36s: listen to him talk he has the ability of
4662.48s: remembering specific plays even from 10
4665.18s: or 15 years ago and because of that even
4667.82s: though he's older now I think he's about
4669.44s: like 38 years old he's able to position
4671.84s: himself and make the right basketball
4674.42s: decision where even though his physical
4677.36s: his physical characteristics have
4679.16s: declined a little bit he's still a top
4681.08s: 10 player in the league just simply
4682.94s: because of what you said pattern
4685.10s: recognition and being able to distill
4688.10s: tons of information down to its most
4691.76s: important takeaways where he can
4693.38s: actually act upon it and use it to
4695.36s: benefit them and there's really no
4697.22s: difference about what he's doing versus
4698.84s: what we're doing as Traders where we're
4700.64s: looking at patterns we're looking at the
4702.80s: best opportunities and then we're acting
4704.72s: upon it to hopefully achieve Alpha based
4707.66s: upon our experience
4709.82s: it's literally a beautiful summary I
4712.16s: completely agree
4713.78s: awesome so honestly this is one of the
4716.06s: better chats that I've had I I think
