0.00s: What's up everyone? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. We have our fan favorite kind of it's like a mini green Hulk.
8.00s: It's like similar color, but we got Doomburg back to talk about the markets, the economy, some geopolitics probably.
15.00s: It's great to see you. Hey Eric, great to be back. I bring the green. You bring the muscles.
21.00s: It's like, it's between the two of us. We probably can get up one Hulk out of the two of us.
26.00s: That you could be. Wouldn't be a good look at Hulk with me in it, but you know.
32.00s: So we've been catching up, you know, like every quarter or so, just touching based on how things were going.
39.00s: And I thought it would be a really great spot to start with your current broad analysis of the US landscape, specific thinking about economy, energy,
52.00s: the markets. Any of those if you want to dive into one surface level on another totally cool.
57.00s: I just want to start with like, what are you seeing from your view? What's most interesting to you?
62.00s: Sure. Obviously, a lot going on. One of the challenges of being an analyst in the Trump era is the speed and violence of the new cycle.
76.00s: Every day is in the story. And much of macroeconomic analysis is really measuring flows.
84.00s: And netting out the flows can be really challenging if there's a lot of flows, right?
89.00s: And so in February, our industrial context started raising alarm about recession supply chains,
96.00s: and then it started raising up on just the threat of tariffs.
102.00s: Basically, that's a really important signal in our view.
107.00s: And then one of the challenges of measuring the government data, which is actually really where I was going with this, is because people are front running things.
117.00s: You're going to get wild measurements across multiple data, like people front running the tariffs on the Sun you see a sort of imports.
125.00s: Well, that affects the measured GDP number. Does it really reflect authentic, sustainable economic activity?
132.00s: Liberation day happens. Shocked everybody.
135.00s: Trump is playing his hand. He has one card to play, which is to get as much of his agenda down as quickly as possible.
144.00s: Ripped the bandade off. While he still has political capital, he needs to have the economy turning around and on the upswing by next summer.
155.00s: And the gamble is that a combination of tariffs, tax cuts, foreign direct investment and cheap energy prices will be enough to catalyze a manufacturing boom in the US.
167.00s: The big question is whether he can bridge between the clearly unworkable, unsustainable old state and a disputable weather. It would be workable new state.
177.00s: But to be fair to Trump, it's exactly what he can't paint on and he's kept his promises to a T.
183.00s: And so it's a fascinating thing to watch.
186.00s: You know, his trip to the Middle East was actually quite remarkable.
190.00s: And in our own private investing, we're seeing the beginnings of a huge wave of interest from sovereign wealth funds to capitalize investments that have, you know, a manufacturing base or the potential for one in the US.
209.00s: And that will create a boom.
211.00s: It will with all booms, there will be frauds and, you know, people who lose a lot of money and people who make fortunes.
219.00s: And so it's, it's just really hard. So, but I would say on the energy side, which is what we care about the most and right about the most.
227.00s: Trump has declared that he wants $50 oil and he seems likely to get it.
231.00s: And the Saudis have seen willing to help Trump pull it off.
237.00s: I think it matters far less than Russia now than it would have if we had pursued that strategy three and a half years ago.
246.00s: But that that's my sort of overall view. Energy's cheap money is flooding into the US.
253.00s: Terrific or a bit of a mess. That's the way Trump operates. There's almost always a master plan.
258.00s: It's not always clear.
260.00s: And just as we were joking before you hit record as fascinating and frustrating a person that you can imagine trying to cover when you're writing a newsletter with a four day editorial cycle.
274.00s: As you're going through that I literally have like six questions that I need to follow up with you on all go and order.
283.00s: The first one you mentioned early on in that the just the macro analysis that you guys do.
293.00s: And I imagine it's such a difficult system to accurately forecast with how many variables come in and how far away.
303.00s: And how far away.
306.00s: And how far away.
309.00s: How do you manage that?
311.00s: So first of all, nobody bats a thousand.
315.00s: And you have to begin the management of that with humility.
321.00s: We try to communicate to our subscribers that we are lateral thinkers.
327.00s: And you don't come to doumburg for traditional straight news.
332.00s: Who what when were why fact based reporting.
335.00s: You come to doumburg to be provoked.
337.00s: You come to doumburg to think.
339.00s: And you come to doumburg hopefully for at least one good choco piece.
343.00s: And that's our brand ambition.
345.00s: We will be provocative without being polarizing.
348.00s: We will be funny without being silly and we will teach without being self-indulgent.
352.00s: And lateral thinking requires that you have the ability to not have to know why a model is working.
359.00s: And trust that it just is and then discard it the moment it's not.
363.00s: So for example, we made one of our best calls of all time in December.
367.00s: When long before Mark Karni was a contract you could bet on on polymarket.
372.00s: We predicted correctly that not only would he replace Justin Shuddo before the election,
377.00s: but he would be a formidable candidate to against the conservatives with the help of the notoriously planned media in Canada and low and behold now he's the prime minister.
387.00s: We came to that prediction based on a mental model that we like to use, which is just make a wild assumption.
395.00s: And then play it forward and look at the data and evidence and see whether or not that assumption is valid.
401.00s: And a wild assumption that we settled upon that led to that piece in late November.
406.00s: And it's that Trump wanted Karni to be prime minister.
410.00s: And Trump didn't like the conservative candidate.
415.00s: And once you have that as an axiom against which you can measure the news flow and see how well it fits, we started to notice things.
424.00s: So once you have that as an axiom, the 51st state and governor Trudeau talk makes sense.
432.00s: And so that's an example, but in our business, if you are the only thing worse in our business than being wrong is having no opinion.
442.00s: And one of the things that we're always very careful to do is shower homework.
446.00s: Here's the link, here's why, here's why we think that here's evidence that would prove our theory wrong.
454.00s: And let smart intelligent investors who subscribe to DOOMberg use our work as an input to their grand mosaic and maybe they make an investment decision or maybe they doubt, but it's their portfolio and they're smart and they're independent.
468.00s: And they're adults and they're capable of reading things that they might sometimes disagree with as long as it's interesting.
474.00s: And it's not polarizing and it's not, you know, to self-intelgent.
479.00s: I love focusing, it's almost like a little bit of a process-based focus like on like what we're talking about, what we can learn, what details can we extract, understanding the fact that it's a shifting world.
491.00s: And coming up with like big macro views is really challenging and literally any day there can be a completely new inject that.
500.00s: Yeah, everything.
501.00s: And, honestly, look, we had made a call, earlier in the year, for example, that we wrote a piece literally called the US is not broke.
511.00s: Then liberation day happened and through the whole economic situation into a mass.
519.00s: And now we see the big beautiful bill is, you know, not exactly physically responsible.
526.00s: So while the US is certainly not broke, even still.
530.00s: And the core arguments of that piece, whole true, we're still heading towards being broke because of political choices and behaviors.
540.00s: And so our readers might look at that and say, well, you got that one wrong.
543.00s: I would say, perhaps.
547.00s: But things changed.
549.00s: And when you publish, you know, 90 plus times a year, like we do, nobody bats a thousand.
554.00s: So one of the things we do is about every three or six months, you know, once a quarter, a couple times a year,
560.00s: we'll just write a piece that looks back at five or six of our calls.
565.00s: And, you know, we have a pretty good hit rate.
568.00s: You know, the ones that were clearly right, the ones that were clearly wrong and ones that were a little more nuanced.
572.00s: And just fast up to it.
575.00s: People love that.
576.00s: I think one of the problems with the mainstream media is arrogance.
581.00s: And just, you know, confidence is an absolute measure and arrogance is a relative one.
586.00s: And we're absolutely confident in our abilities and we're proud of our work.
592.00s: And, you know, we measure ourselves against our own standard.
595.00s: And I think that comes through.
597.00s: Yeah, I love that.
598.00s: It's funny too, because even more in like the trading side of the world where I exist,
602.00s: it's the same thing, right, where everybody's so interested in trying to figure out who was right on this news headline.
609.00s: And it, I always find it's missing the force for the trees.
612.00s: And I like that process based each piece regardless of what ends up happening will have stuff in it.
620.00s: That's usable.
622.00s: That provokes thought.
623.00s: And it's awesome.
624.00s: And look, trading world 53% is amazing.
627.00s: Right.
628.00s: You give me 53% success rate.
630.00s: I'll give you the bank role management and we'll make millions.
633.00s: And look, it, one of the things that is authentically true with every single thing.
638.00s: With everything we write is the moment we present everybody on the team 100% believes every word in that piece.
646.00s: That's a moment in time.
648.00s: Five minutes later, do information could come that radically changes our views.
653.00s: But the moment we present, there is not a doubt that we, that is our best, most informed opinion.
661.00s: And the wonderful thing about sub-stack and the free market in general.
666.00s: It's every time we publish or every time we do a podcast appearance.
670.00s: Our business depends on it.
672.00s: So if we get more things right, we get more subscribers or we keep the ones that we have.
680.00s: And if somebody happens upon this podcast and says, well, I, that guest was interesting.
686.00s: Let me go and sign up for free and see what this is all about.
689.00s: Well, that's a pretty strong form of engagement and they're more likely to end up subscribing.
693.00s: If somebody listens to this podcast and they hate what I say, they're unlikely to pass.
700.00s: And that's what the wonderful thing about the markets.
703.00s: Like we are 380 pieces into this.
706.00s: And we've lost no motivation for them whatsoever.
711.00s: Because we try to produce the very, like, very best product every time.
716.00s: And I, we wouldn't publish a piece if we weren't like,
721.00s: it's not quite achievable.
723.00s: But our objective is every piece is a candidate for the best piece we've ever written.
727.00s: I see.
728.00s: Yeah, it's like we want it to be at that level.
731.00s: And you know, sometimes they just don't land, that's fine.
735.00s: But like there's no typos, very few typos.
739.00s: We've, we do rigorously fact check as much as we can.
743.00s: There's nothing worse than getting a minor detail wrong in a story that collapses the credibility of the whole piece.
749.00s: Right.
750.00s: And it happens, you know, but you know, you get somebody's name wrong or you get a date wrong.
756.00s: You know, fact checking is actually much harder than you would think.
760.00s: Especially when you're charging people, like once we turned on the pay wall,
763.00s: it just brought the business to a whole different level of responsibility for us.
767.00s: Like people are paying to consume this product.
771.00s: And that, that never leaves my mind.
774.00s: Like we're not going to just put garbage out.
777.00s: Like people are paying for this and we're going to earn their business.
781.00s: Yeah.
782.00s: Yeah.
783.00s: Makes a lot of sense.
784.00s: And speaking of earning business, the US is trying to earn more manufacturing business.
791.00s: What do you make of the various arguments circulating around that?
797.00s: Some saying like, this is good for these reasons, national security, bringing jobs, other people will say things like.
805.00s: Americans don't want some of those jobs. So why would we bother bringing low skill jobs back.
811.00s: What's your opinion on, on short more manufacturing?
816.00s: On a bash of the 100% for it, Trump deserves full credit for trying to get it.
823.00s: The US and capital markets in general do a very poor job of pricing national security risk.
831.00s: And I think failed immigration policy has driven down the wages of such jobs with point where Americans can't really make a living doing those jobs, at least compared to their neighbors.
843.00s: And I think Trump is mostly right on a lot of stuff.
847.00s: I have some issue with some of Trump's tactics and some of Trump's language and some of Trump's social media posts.
855.00s: But I actually don't have a doubt his authenticity and look at all the things everybody says he is including his critics, right?
862.00s: Like yes, Trump University was the scam.
865.00s: Like the same person who did Trump University was just treated like a king in the Middle East and worked tirelessly to bring trillions of dollars of foreign direct investment into the United States.
876.00s: I genuinely believe that Trump wants to catalyze a manufacturing of Renaissance, especially in the Midwest and I live in the Midwest.
885.00s: I've seen the devastation and the consequences of financialization and globalization.
890.00s: First hand participated in it when I was in corporate.
895.00s: So all of those things are true and also Trump coin is a scam.
900.00s: I don't understand the valuation of truth social.
905.00s: All of it is true and I think it's okay to say that we can measure them in holistically.
914.00s: Do I think that it is ethically dubious that Don Jr is going around the world and pumping various investments and foreign investors are curing favor directly?
925.00s: I mean how is that radically different than Hunter Biden?
928.00s: I don't really think it is and Trump fans will get annoyed.
931.00s: I'm sorry if I'm going to trigger some people in your comments, but it's okay.
935.00s: Like the Washington sees full of corrupt politicians.
940.00s: And so at least this one seems to be trying to do things for the working people.
948.00s: And I can tell you I live in an area where Trump held a rally about 30 miles from where I live and I decided to just drive around and get the vibe.
959.00s: And like because you know you do in little in person recon right.
965.00s: Nothing like boots on the ground and eyes on and so shocking.
970.00s: And so in the politician in the in the modern era that connects with regular people in the way Trump does.
976.00s: And your view of that depends on your view of regular people.
980.00s: I happen to take the views of regular people seriously.
983.00s: What is Trump saying and doing that has caused this billionaire from New York, flamboyant billionaire from New York to become their champion.
993.00s: Like it's don't ignore that.
996.00s: And you know and it's it's too fluently rushed aside by the sort of coastal leaps.
1005.00s: And this Trump placed this all time and then the last thing I'll say Trump has a magic trick which I must say Scott Jennings on CNN is the one who.
1013.00s: Open my eyes to this trick.
1015.00s: He picks positions on really easy issues 80 20 support in the country.
1022.00s: And he takes the 80% side loudly and all the Democrats who hate him so much viscerally for whatever their justifications.
1030.00s: They are forced to argue the 20% position and he's just crushing them.
1034.00s: Like over and over and over and over and over and over and just crushing them.
1038.00s: And so he's a talented person.
1041.00s: And so when you see a man, yeah.
1043.00s: It's almost always on purpose.
1045.00s: Again, it's not how I operate.
1047.00s: You know, my personality in Trump's personality in between the two of us is everybody else.
1051.00s: But that's fine.
1052.00s: Like I'm people who have tried to look objectively measure.
1055.00s: You know.
1057.00s: So then how does Trump is working for the average worker and trying to advocate for them.
1067.00s: And the on-shoring then of manufacturing jobs seemingly would be primarily to their benefit.
1073.00s: Is that the broader idea?
1076.00s: Everyone in Trump's mind is going to benefit.
1078.00s: Every people are going to get on the really rich out of this.
1080.00s: I mean, let's be honest.
1082.00s: You can't bring in a trillion dollars of foreign money without a whole bunch of people on Wall Street and executives and investors and venture capitalists and private equity firms coming out way better than they were.
1094.00s: Will some of it trickle down?
1097.00s: I hope so.
1100.00s: To your point, like do people really want to do these jobs?
1103.00s: I mean, I think they do.
1104.00s: Many of them do.
1105.00s: I mean, there's still a hardcore group of Americans who would like to provide for their family and are willing to do an honest days work for an honest days pay.
1114.00s: But I don't kid yourself.
1116.00s: I mean, if just one thing, the sort of money class of US knows how to do is to catch money.
1123.00s: And there's an awful lot of money coming in.
1129.00s: But before you'd mention fruit oil and trying to drive oil down.
1135.00s: One of the things I've been trying to understand a little bit better is been OPEC stance on a lot of this and they've seen way more accommodating than I originally would have expected.
1147.00s: How do you view their lens on what's going on?
1152.00s: Yeah, we read a couple of pieces on this and I think we've gotten this one mostly right.
1156.00s: There was a deal cut.
1157.00s: Look, whenever you have Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States sitting around negotiating with each other for weeks at a time, history tells us that when the three largest or producer's like that get together, whatever the headline reason is for them to be meeting is almost never really what it's all about.
1176.00s: And so for weeks we had the whole Ukraine thing talks were hosted in Saudi Arabia.
1182.00s: We believe a broader more consequential deal than just settling the war in Ukraine, which of course is very consequential, especially for those who live in Ukraine.
1191.00s: Something else is going on back channels.
1194.00s: And I think a deal was cut, who knows what was given in return.
1198.00s: We have some speculations in that regard.
1200.00s: But OPEC is suddenly doing Trump's bidding.
1203.00s: Let me let's just be honest.
1206.00s: And they're masking it as though they're punishing Kazakhstan for cheating.
1210.00s: She needs me going on an OPEC for F who we kidding.
1213.00s: A deal was cut.
1215.00s: And then after all of that, Trump goes to Saudi Arabia and you just watch the footage.
1219.00s: I'm sure you've seen it.
1221.00s: Like, the Middle East is changing.
1226.00s: And Trump, again, treated like a hero in the Middle East.
1234.00s: Did you see the standing Ovation he got when he announced that they were going to lift the sanctions on Syria, which is all other ball-awaks?
1241.00s: And the tsunami of cash committed to back Trump.
1247.00s: I think a lot of it has to do with a want Trump to succeed.
1251.00s: They want JD Vance to win in 28.
1253.00s: They want what Trump is trying to do in America to work.
1258.00s: And then there's a whole broader thought around Trump's civil war with the deep state.
1264.00s: And Pimple Malgrim wrote a really fascinating piece of which I could remember the title.
1269.00s: Basically saying that he's getting the help of these countries to stare down the deep state.
1275.00s: And if you model the U.S. as currently being in a civil war, then all of this can make a lot more sense.
1281.00s: Lord knows the CIA has messed around in the Middle East for an awful long time.
1285.00s: And people have probably pretty tired of it over there.
1287.00s: And look at what he's doing with Harvard in this regard.
1291.00s: I have to give a head tip to Mike Benson's great work on Twitter.
1295.00s: I'm sure you follow it, or you've seen it.
1298.00s: You know, the attack on Harvard, which some judge just issued a temporary restraining organization
1303.00s: Why it already hours later, to Trump's move to Bar Harvard from accepting foreign students.
1310.00s: That's actually an attack on the intelligence community because it's just part of their giant grift.
1316.00s: So there's lots of ways we can go with that, but I'm just fascinated to watch all of it like we've said.
1322.00s: So in what do you think the primary incentives would be for OPEC to want Trump and his policies to succeed?
1333.00s: Well, they unified Middle East, buffered from outside interference and the forever wars and the war would arand.
1344.00s: And the war in Syria.
1347.00s: If they could settle all of that and be left alone to enjoy their riches, that's a prize worth suffering or a few quarters of declining profits for.
1359.00s: I honestly think that there's a deeper, again, when you look at how the, you know, the dropping of the gold standard was covered in the 1970s.
1371.00s: There's a little talk at a petro dollar and the contemporary reporting of what was going on.
1378.00s: There's something going on behind the scenes. We're not.
1381.00s: Private to it.
1383.00s: But it's never what it's being presented that's actually what's happening whenever you have momentous, decade, shape shifting type moves like we're seeing now.
1392.00s: And so my hope, my suspicion, is that Trump has a grand plan of settling the war and you're going to be a great.
1400.00s: Settling the war in Ukraine, driving peace in the Middle East and reaching data on with China.
1410.00s: Cutting back on Middle Thursday spending in the long run because we don't need a trillion dollars a year.
1416.00s: And shepherding a US manufacturing renaissance with all of the assets of the Western Hemisphere there for for development.
1427.00s: And the Hemisphere is way more than self-sufficient and I think the sort of multiple world that Trump envisions.
1434.00s: That is the US's fear of influence.
1437.00s: And I think that's the grand plan.
1439.00s: And look if you get to the thundish you give them a double piece price.
1443.00s: Three of them.
1445.00s: But we'll see.
1446.00s: Lots of people in the US don't want any of those objectives to get done.
1451.00s: So.
1452.00s: Why do you think that is?
1454.00s: Because there's a racket.
1457.00s: And when you're in the bomb making business pieces of working capital problem.
1461.00s: And and I think much of US foreign policy post 1970 or Limbargo was shaped by the erroneous view that Peacoyle was real in the US was running out of it.
1474.00s: And so we went around the world in what amounts to resource force.
1480.00s: And so the solution has radically changed that.
1483.00s: For more than self-sufficient or net energy exporters we were fine way more finished products than we need.
1488.00s: Yes, we have a mismatch between the type of oil that a refiner's like to refine versus the type of oil that we are producing out of scale.
1496.00s: All that will be fixed over time with investment.
1499.00s: But by and large the US need not go abroad.
1502.00s: In search of resources anymore it has more than enough to eat at home.
1507.00s: So that changing axiom hasn't really worked its way through the sort of state department.
1514.00s: Typimac class and look the giant griff machine that is DC is very lucrative.
1520.00s: Every dollar of deficit spending ends up in the private sector pocket of somebody.
1527.00s: Right?
1528.00s: There's a lot of conservation of mass here, right?
1532.00s: Like the dollars go somewhere.
1534.00s: So if you have a billion dollar jet program, well there's a shareholder on the other end of that billion dollar investment.
1541.00s: And so the system was working very well for a very small number of people.
1549.00s: Those are the people that are going to be the most resistant to see that system change.
1555.00s: You'd mentioned earlier touched on it quickly, but I always think it's worth discussing because I think the way it's been flowing is
1563.00s: been very different than pretty much whatever but you might have thought which is the Russian-Korean conflict.
1570.00s: Obviously Trump had talked about solving it essentially as soon as you got in.
1575.00s: And then reality comes in.
1578.00s: How do you think that spend progressing and where do you think we go forward with respect to the conflict?
1586.00s: I don't think the conflict can be solved in any other way other than militarily.
1593.00s: And the terms that Russia has been consistently laying out there have not changed and only get more aggressive with each square kilometer that the Russians occupy.
1609.00s: They would say liberate.
1611.00s: Ukrainians would say occupy.
1615.00s: And I noticed with some interest overnight that Putin has declared that a new goal of the Russian army is to create a buffer zone in northern Ukraine in the Sumi region because of a wave of hundreds of drones that were fired at Moscow.
1633.00s: And if you have hundreds and hundreds of drones fired at Moscow, well you could see with each drone.
1642.00s: And I'm just sharing that strike.
1644.00s: More and more we're getting through as the sort of early anti-missile defenses were being overwhelmed.
1652.00s: And so I think last reports I saw like 60 out of 500 drones or so and don't quote me but got made it into the Moscow area, which is quite alarming to the Russians.
1663.00s: And it's going to provoke a response of pushing for their back.
1668.00s: Last time I was on the show, I made statements to the effect that I believe the war was lost.
1675.00s: And that it would be in Ukraine's interest to make peace and I know that that probably triggered some people because it's just not how the war is being reported in the West and the Western legacy media.
1685.00s: The strongest proof I could say that validated my last appearance is that the winning side doesn't demand ceasefire.
1691.00s: And which side is demanding a ceasefire right now.
1694.00s: It's the NATO side.
1697.00s: What makes you say that the winning side doesn't demand ceasefire?
1700.00s: The winning side has no need for a ceasefire. The winning side is fine to keep marching.
1706.00s: It's right Ukraine needs a positive VR and they've been very like my crown and Starmer have been very a word about this.
1714.00s: That's have an unconditional ceasefire.
1717.00s: No restrictions on arm supply to Ukraine.
1719.00s: We're going to fly in some British and French troops as trip wires.
1723.00s: And then we're going to army cranes of the team.
1725.00s: It gives me a better chance to fight after the ceasefire.
1728.00s: And the Russians have openly and consistently said we're not going to play that game anymore.
1732.00s: We've been fooled by that before.
1733.00s: Now again, no matter what you're using the war, I'm just telling you,
1736.00s: when you look at the area that the Russians are curing in the pace of area in May,
1741.00s: which is of course they're getting out of the muddy season.
1744.00s: And the tanks can now roll without getting stuck in the mud.
1748.00s: They're going to go all in for a military victory.
1752.00s: And absent a large appropriation from the US Congress,
1757.00s: which looks very unlikely.
1759.00s: There was no talk of weapons for Ukraine in a big beautiful bill.
1764.00s: I don't know how it ends in any other way out of the military.
1768.00s: And again, this session they had in Istanbul was a, yeah, in Turkey in Istanbul.
1777.00s: I think the Russians took a tough line.
1781.00s: And it's not, look, it's totally tragic situation.
1785.00s: It was totally avoidable.
1788.00s: Trump is caught in a trap.
1792.00s: He, I think correctly, leaves that if he had won the 2020 election,
1796.00s: there would not have been a war in Ukraine.
1799.00s: And so he doesn't feel like it's his war.
1802.00s: But the US is a party to the war.
1807.00s: So he can't really be a mediator.
1810.00s: Because the moment the US stop supplying weapons and intelligence,
1814.00s: it's going to be very difficult for Ukraine to hold back the Russian army.
1819.00s: The heroic defense they've been able to put up has been underwritten by US weapons,
1826.00s: US intelligence, US generals.
1828.00s: And every day that Trump continues to provide that,
1833.00s: which he is doing because he doesn't want to see sort of a Vietnam style collapse,
1838.00s: which is understandable.
1840.00s: And the loss of the war would be pinned on him.
1842.00s: But every day that he continues to provide those things,
1846.00s: it becomes his war.
1848.00s: And losing worse is hard.
1851.00s: That's why you don't get into them.
1853.00s: So, but anytime we talk about Ukraine, we annoy some people,
1856.00s: and it is what it is.
1858.00s: But I think we've been proven mostly right on what we've said.
1861.00s: And the information is all there.
1865.00s: But you have to understand that every piece of information you're getting is propaganda.
1870.00s: And you have to have a mechanism to read everybody's propaganda.
1875.00s: And then observe developments as you unfold and go back to the sources that predicted various things,
1880.00s: and see which one was mostly right.
1882.00s: And then you sort of add more credibility weight to that source over time,
1886.00s: as they're more and more right.
1888.00s: And lastly, I'll say, is almost no Western media outlets,
1893.00s: and very few consumers of news in the West actually read what the Russians are writing,
1899.00s: or listen to what they're saying to understand what their positions are.
1905.00s: And if they did, they would probably have a different view.
1908.00s: So I think it's okay to read both the key of independent and task.
1914.00s: The English versions of both of those.
1916.00s: And this event happened.
1921.00s: This is how the Ukrainians are describing it.
1924.00s: This is how the Russians are describing it.
1926.00s: Let's wait through four days and see which side is more accurate.
1929.00s: Sometimes the Russians are blatantly pedaling disinformation,
1933.00s: not my favorite word,
1935.00s: but sometimes Ukrainians are spreading propaganda.
1939.00s: And sometimes it's a synthesis of the two that is probably right.
1943.00s: So for example, the whole reporting around the massage drone attack on Moscow
1947.00s: was reported wildly differently between the Russians and Ukrainians.
1951.00s: You see that enough times.
1953.00s: So for example, if the Russians claim that every single drone was shot down
1957.00s: and then you're seeing video footage of explosions along the path from Moscow,
1961.00s: well then you know, maybe that Russian minister defense was,
1967.00s: was fibbing a little bit.
1969.00s: Okay, you have to put that into back of your mind.
1972.00s: And so again, it's very hard, especially with war.
1975.00s: Because the closer your art to it,
1977.00s: and the more emotionally you get about it.
1979.00s: And emotion is never good for objective analysis.
1983.00s: We can't have said a better.
1986.00s: I think in it's one of those conflicts that does have a lot to it
1991.00s: that escapes a lot of more casual observers of it.
1996.00s: Yeah, every time that I talk to some of my military friends
2000.00s: and we're trying to dive deeper and deeper into it.
2003.00s: You realize how tangled really that whole region is.
2006.00s: But there's a lot of history.
2008.00s: Look, Victor Orban of Hungary.
2012.00s: Correctly described this as a slow-vacce of a war.
2015.00s: Right.
2016.00s: So I actually I care a lot about your military bodies, right?
2020.00s: And I have children of military age, draft eligible.
2026.00s: And I also have friends in other countries.
2029.00s: And I had particularly close one from Canada during the whole Trump,
2032.00s: Mayn't yet.
2034.00s: And you know, the whole Orange Man bad stuff.
2037.00s: Aren't you worried?
2039.00s: No, I'm not worried.
2041.00s: And we had text exchange.
2043.00s: You could in about Ukraine.
2045.00s: Okay, let's get us a firefighter.
2048.00s: Two kids, two boys.
2050.00s: And I said,
2052.00s: When did you begin to care about who rules the Russian speaking part of the dumbass?
2059.00s: And why do you care about it?
2061.00s: So you could talk on this question, right?
2063.00s: And would you send your boys to go fight to decide who gets to rule the rest in speaking part of the dumbass?
2069.00s: And then I said, there's a war in the Congo right now.
2071.00s: This is a war in the Congo right now.
2072.00s: Thousands and thousands of people being killed every day.
2075.00s: You never hear about it.
2076.00s: What do you care about it?
2077.00s: Why don't you care about the Congo and would you send your boys to go fight in the Congo?
2080.00s: Now, if you're in Russia or you're in Ukraine, that sounds like a cold way to view the question.
2086.00s: But I'm not in Russia, I'm not in Ukraine, and I'm not in you.
2089.00s: And I'm not in you.
2090.00s: And I'm not in your military bodies.
2092.00s: So, after 9-11, I understand why you're going to Afghanistan.
2101.00s: Because the US was attacked, like that was a legitimate response.
2107.00s: But the Russians, speaking part of the dumbass, is part of some broader geopolitical game that the European is
2112.00s: care much more about than we do.
2114.00s: I don't know, I just don't get too excited about it.
2118.00s: There's no, it's existential to Russia.
2122.00s: It's obviously existential to Ukraine.
2125.00s: It's geopolitically important to the US to weaken Russia, I guess.
2132.00s: I just, when you read enough history, and you do it, we do.
2137.00s: It's hard not to get cynical, openly confess to being cynical.
2142.00s: I'm unabashedly isolationist.
2144.00s: I think that a part of defense should not be misconstrued as the Department of Proactive Offense.
2151.00s: I think the US has amazing resources, economic potential, two oceans buffering us from hostilities.
2158.00s: Nobody would ever dare attack us.
2160.00s: Every home in the country has guns in it.
2162.00s: Good luck occupying it.
2164.00s: We're capable of defending ourselves.
2166.00s: Let Europe defend Europe.
2168.00s: That's sort of my view.
2170.00s: And I know some people are going to be reacting negatively to that.
2175.00s: But I think there's a lot more people, like if you go to the back to the Joe Sixback and why people,
2179.00s: one of the reasons why Trump was so popular because he had no wars.
2182.00s: And you ran on that.
2183.00s: There were no new wars.
2185.00s: Started under Trump.
2187.00s: It's proud of that.
2188.00s: It correctly says there would not have been a war in Ukraine if he had won in 2020.
2191.00s: Who has the war in Ukraine benefited?
2194.00s: Not Ukraine.
2195.00s: Arguably not the rest in soldiers who were dying.
2198.00s: Certainly not the foreign mercenaries who were there.
2201.00s: Who the rest in their treating as though they don't have, you know,
2205.00s: a standard of rights and they're killing them on spot.
2209.00s: It's a mess.
2210.00s: The disaster.
2211.00s: Worst bad.
2212.00s: Worst terrible.
2213.00s: Worst should be avoided.
2215.00s: You need a strong military as a deterrent.
2218.00s: You don't deter by proactively getting entangled overseas.
2222.00s: And my view.
2223.00s: That's just my view.
2224.00s: It's fascinating.
2225.00s: It really is really interesting to learn the,
2228.00s: the, the broader thought process behind the isolationist position and what not.
2234.00s: And it's interesting.
2236.00s: It really is interesting to me.
2238.00s: The big thing you learn in the military,
2240.00s: things like we call defense and depth and layering.
2244.00s: So it's really interesting to like,
2246.00s: to think about those two, right?
2248.00s: Like how, how far is depth in the global scale?
2253.00s: And obviously for the US, it's global.
2255.00s: Potions.
2256.00s: Yeah, but, but look at, but if you're Russia,
2258.00s: so that's just let's do the analogy.
2260.00s: Chinese gangs have set up shop in Mexico and are firing drones
2265.00s: that are approaching Washington DC.
2269.00s: How would the US respond to that?
2271.00s: Now, Ukraine's would say,
2273.00s: well, they invaded Mexico in your scenario.
2275.00s: And, you know, they're just fighting for their sovereignty.
2277.00s: You know, that's fine and true and, and justifiable.
2281.00s: But, um, the latest situation in Indian Pakistan is a great example.
2287.00s: Like, JD Vance had the correct take on it.
2290.00s: We would like to avoid civil war,
2292.00s: but we don't care about this war
2294.00s: to send American troops to the Indian Voltaugh.
2296.00s: Right?
2298.00s: There's always conflict in the world.
2300.00s: The world's a ugly, dangerous, violent place
2303.00s: as you probably know way better than me,
2305.00s: viscerally.
2306.00s: Um, the Stabos are high-trust society at home and protected.
2311.00s: We have, we have two oceans, talk about layers.
2315.00s: Um, you know, if China takes Taiwan,
2318.00s: does that really meaningfully change your life?
2321.00s: That's a civil war from the 40s, still being fought.
2326.00s: I mean, when you get entangled in four of the fairs,
2330.00s: that the founding fathers had this right,
2332.00s: and, um, we're putting a piece out on Tuesday on Estonia,
2338.00s: and the whole situation in a Gulf of Finland,
2341.00s: and the piece is called Tripwire.
2343.00s: Estonia is a country of 1.4 million people.
2347.00s: It might come as a surprise to the small subset of the 335 million Americans listening to this podcast,
2354.00s: that you and I have an article five obligation to defend Estonia.
2359.00s: And Estonia is using a small subset of its eight Navy ships in total,
2367.00s: to try to board and otherwise seize tankers containing Russian oil
2374.00s: that is flowing through the E.E.Z in the Gulf of Finland.
2379.00s: And, um, we're really going to go to war because Estonia got,
2385.00s: you know, a fighter jet, a Russian fighter jet buzzed the situation in that
2389.00s: caused the Estonian Navy to beat a hasty retreat.
2393.00s: But there's pure escalation going on right now,
2397.00s: amongst the European quote unquote allies,
2400.00s: that is designed to trigger an article five incident
2404.00s: and rope the US into a broader conflict with Russia.
2407.00s: Is that, is that okay? Is that normal?
2410.00s: Estonia is like, three quarters of the size of West Virginia
2414.00s: and has 1.4 million people in it, and the US because of the NATO expansion
2419.00s: has agreed that if Estonia is attacked,
2423.00s: it will go to war on behalf of Estonia.
2425.00s: I don't think many Americans know that.
2428.00s: The George Washington famously warned about foreign entagaments and Thomas Jefferson did the same,
2435.00s: and we quote both of their cautious and appease.
2438.00s: Secure the homeland, engaging commerce,
2441.00s: invest in a high trust society,
2443.00s: education, good jobs, prosperity, cheap energy.
2449.00s: The things that Trump talks about, whether he gets them, whether he means it,
2452.00s: that's why he's popular.
2454.00s: It's not the rich people who fight the wars, right?
2456.00s: I mean it.
2457.00s: So, you know, yes, I'm isolationist.
2463.00s: I don't know. There was a dude I saw on the barracks that had a Lamborghini,
2466.00s: so his parents were pretty rich.
2468.00s: They must have had pissed at him.
2470.00s: It was one of the funniest things I've seen in my entire life,
2474.00s: because the enlisted Marines, when they're juniors,
2477.00s: they have to be in the barracks, and they have all the stuff that you have to have.
2482.00s: And the dudes like trying to figure out how to put his kit in a Lamborghini
2486.00s: to take to go drive where he has to go to like start a hike.
2489.00s: You should have fair I want to put this pack, because it doesn't fit the trunk.
2493.00s: He's truly the exception that proves the real.
2496.00s: Very much.
2497.00s: That he was so memorable.
2498.00s: She'll show you how rare he was.
2500.00s: It's so comical.
2502.00s: Now, you were talking a little bit earlier about energy, cheap energy.
2507.00s: We know you want to spend a while talking about nuclear power,
2510.00s: how important that is to this.
2512.00s: Obviously, Trump has come out recently with some updates on his policies,
2517.00s: towards nuclear energy.
2518.00s: What do you think of those?
2519.00s: Yeah, we're waiting for the formal executive orders that could drop any minute,
2523.00s: and might even drop before you publish this podcast.
2525.00s: We wrote a piece yesterday called Exerereal Examinations,
2529.00s: where reading the team that he says we try to do,
2532.00s: we believe that what's going to happen is that the US military is going to be leveraged
2536.00s: to circumvent civilian obstacles to the deployment of nuclear reactors
2542.00s: to power artificial intelligence data centers.
2546.00s: I think you're going to see Google and Facebook and then
2549.00s: video setting up on military campuses, leveraging the defense production
2555.00s: powers act or whatever it's called.
2559.00s: And basically stripping the energy of the ability to block
2564.00s: impede or otherwise veto the development of safe nuclear power,
2567.00s: while Trump sets about the task of cutting the energy and rebuilding it
2572.00s: back in his image.
2573.00s: And I think he and Chris Wright and Dr. Bergam and the whole American energy
2579.00s: dominance committee knows inherently that the energy has been the
2586.00s: log jam.
2587.00s: And we talked about why that isn't that piece.
2588.00s: We can get into it if you'd like.
2590.00s: But to cut the Gordian knot, Pete Hegson is going to unstick US nuclear energy.
2599.00s: And if you'd have told me when we started to do Berg that my favorite Fox and
2604.00s: friends weekend host was going to be the catalyst for unsticking US nuclear energy.
2611.00s: I could hardly have believed you, but to be fair and to be clear,
2615.00s: I have great respect for Pete Hegson.
2617.00s: I think he has done his tours of duty.
2621.00s: He's in American hero.
2622.00s: He's a smart intelligence, handsome, tele, you know, looks great on TV.
2627.00s: All the things Trump likes.
2629.00s: And if he can do it, God bless him.
2631.00s: He will have carved out a legacy far superior to his predecessors.
2636.00s: So I do think it is shameful how hexits military services minimize and his lack of
2647.00s: quote unquote qualifications for the job by the traditional elite measurements is
2654.00s: continuously highlighted by those who oppose him or a post Trump.
2657.00s: And you only need to look at how the troops respond to him when he works out with him in
2662.00s: the morning to get a true understanding of the leadership potential of Pete Hegson.
2666.00s: It's really interesting because the military is an institution that obviously highly
2671.00s: values hierarchy, but one of the largest complaints you'll hear from military members
2677.00s: is often how that hierarchy just slows everything down to a snail's pace in terms of
2683.00s: innovating, trying new ideas.
2686.00s: So we, the bureaucracy chokes out innovation and there's no bigger bureaucracy than the
2693.00s: Pentagon.
2694.00s: I can only tell like, don't worry, it's a very small team.
2698.00s: You can count the contributing members of Dubbergon one hand with multiple fingers left over.
2703.00s: And we joke internally that if we hire 10 people, we'd be 50% as productive in total
2710.00s: because you spend all your time managing with 10 people.
2713.00s: It's okay to just do things yourself.
2717.00s: Just go and do.
2719.00s: Don't ask.
2722.00s: The last thing you want to do is get an opinion of a lawyer.
2726.00s: Like lawyers advise and leaders decide, go, point, pull the trigger.
2732.00s: This is why, by the way, I've never been in the military.
2736.00s: I read a lot of military history and I have a lot of respect for people that they don't
2739.00s: know, sorry.
2741.00s: Pushing power to the field commander level is always better than headmothers, right?
2747.00s: And so like the lowest rank and when I was an executive, I always try to do this.
2751.00s: When I was leading large teams and you have what's called span and control.
2756.00s: Like, so I'm sure you know, very similar in corporate world as to the military, accept
2761.00s: this less death.
2764.00s: How many people can a manager actually manage and how many layers between you and the field.
2772.00s: And all of my conversations with my leaders as I grew up with the corporate chain was,
2777.00s: here's your accountability.
2779.00s: Here's your control.
2781.00s: Let's start by describing both of those and make sure that there's no mismatch.
2785.00s: Because there's nothing worse than having more accountability than you have control.
2788.00s: Because you can't complete the mission.
2790.00s: And if you have more control than you have accountability, that's not so good either.
2793.00s: So my goal was always clear goal writing and matching accountability with control.
2799.00s: You have the authority to hire, to fire, to promote, to develop.
2804.00s: But this is the substance decisions I need to be consulted on.
2808.00s: It's a classic race, responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed.
2811.00s: And if you spell that out and you have good leaders and you trust them.
2815.00s: And their successes theirs and their failures are ours.
2821.00s: And if you know that your leadership has that mindset, then they will do wonders for you.
2825.00s: It's got to be the same thing in the military.
2827.00s: I'm sure this is very familiar to you.
2829.00s: When you have to go back to the Pentagon for every decision.
2832.00s: And you see the consequences of that decision is not just money lost.
2838.00s: It's your friend died.
2840.00s: That's very bittering.
2841.00s: I would assume.
2843.00s: And so, I think back to Hegseth, like the way in which he was treated after being nominated,
2849.00s: was shameful.
2852.00s: I feel like it's the standard thing, right?
2854.00s: Everybody's trying to figure out what they can try to poke holes in no matter what the resume is.
2858.00s: So.
2859.00s: Yeah, but you know, they didn't do that to Rubio because he's a senator and he's a member of the club.
2864.00s: So I, he's not always that way.
2867.00s: Going back to energy.
2870.00s: What's something that you would consider to be like a current state under appreciated risk
2877.00s: with respect to just the energy supply chain risk to supply or risk to price because they're the opposite side.
2885.00s: I would say to the supply chain to the actual provision.
2888.00s: Yeah, more than the Middle East obviously, but that's why they appreciated.
2894.00s: I think terrorism against choke points.
2901.00s: A well-informed bad actor could do significant damage to the global economy with a very, very small repertoire of weapons.
2912.00s: I'm guessing that almost nobody listening to this podcast has ever heard of the words,
2918.00s: Ross Tenerra before.
2921.00s: Probably you haven't.
2922.00s: How definitely have not.
2924.00s: Yeah, Ross Tenerra is home to the world's most important energy production site.
2930.00s: Tiny island of Qatar.
2934.00s: Qatar produces, you know, enormous amount of natural gas that ends up on ships, most of it.
2942.00s: And it's fed to places like Japan, Korea, Europe now.
2947.00s: And it's a very small area in the middle of the Middle East.
2950.00s: Well within the hoothies range.
2953.00s: And it wouldn't take much in the way of a concerted effort to destroy that facility, to disrupt the global economy.
2960.00s: There's two pipelines that connect Russia to Turkey.
2968.00s: That Russia has accused and I think Turkey has quite agreed.
2973.00s: Ukraine has been trying to blow up.
2975.00s: The North Stream pipeline, I think, was a catastrophe.
2979.00s: Exploding that pipeline was a disaster because it normalizes the wanth and destruction of critical energy infrastructure.
2985.00s: And once we go down that road, a lot of the outcomes.
2988.00s: So all the land pipelines connecting Russia to Europe no longer flow gas.
2996.00s: And Nord Stream no longer flows gas and three of the four pipelines are blown up.
3001.00s: There are two large pipelines that connect Russia to Turkey that then go on to feed gas to places like Hong Kong.
3008.00s: And it'll be a big disaster for us to places like Hong Kong, and Slovakia, Italy, and broader Europe.
3015.00s: And if we wake up one day and you hear that either Turks Dream or Blue Stream has been damaged or destroyed in a terrorist attack, all bets are off.
3025.00s: But the thing about energy is you gain efficiency at scale.
3032.00s: And scale necessarily means concentration.
3037.00s: You have concentrated risks. And so I think terrorism is it.
3044.00s: It could happen in the US.
3046.00s: Freeport LNG had a mysterious explosion shortly after the whole North Stream affair.
3050.00s: And there was a lot of rumors that maybe this was Russian cyber attack that who knows, back to propaganda and disinformation.
3059.00s: You start taking out LNG export terminals.
3062.00s: So you're going to flood the US with LNG and sorry with natural gas and it's going to stint all production and all kinds of issues.
3069.00s: And so that's a big risk.
3072.00s: I think the long term consequences of the Nord Stream attack hold the potential to be severe.
3084.00s: And when countries get desperate, I think Ukraine is desperate, understandably so.
3090.00s: Losing wars is hard.
3093.00s: If it's existential, you will need to do anything.
3097.00s: And so there was an attack on the Turks Dream compressive stations that apparently the Russian air defense is a managed knockout.
3107.00s: If that attack had been successful, ironically, the Europeans would have been in a world of hurt.
3111.00s: Now, summertime, the risk is a little bit less.
3114.00s: You see that pipeline go out in November. It's a whole different story.
3121.00s: This is probably a pretty ignorant question, but I'm curious about it.
3126.00s: In the world of nuclear power adoption, what kind of role do you think AI think is a little easier to wrap your arms around the potential impact?
3138.00s: But what about something like quantum computing, which is a little further off, is there any tie-ins from your lens with respect to those two systems?
3147.00s: And how can impact? I'm mostly thinking nuclear, but maybe energy more broadly.
3152.00s: So the cutting edge of computing, the very cutting edge of computing, while it's being developed doesn't actually need that much energy and is willing to pay effectively anything for it.
3161.00s: So I don't think that the development of quantum computing is tied to a world of nuclear energy, for example.
3170.00s: But I think AI will certainly help the development of quantum computing.
3174.00s: And AI is about to transform, I mean, everything, a really scary piece today on a subset I read, friend of mine, authors at Algato, Algato Mato.
3187.00s: He wrote a piece about how the internet is going to be unusable in a year.
3194.00s: Right, and I don't want to take a quantum computing question and turn it into the internet's going to be unusable in a year, but it's what I'm thinking about today.
3201.00s: Right, and so, you know, AI in general is a derivative of energy.
3208.00s: And AI, like what we're seeing now is not the cutting edge of research of AI.
3211.00s: It's just being deployed. It's very cutting edge compared to standard computing.
3214.00s: I'm a firm believer. I'm participating in the private markets on salt.
3220.00s: But to the specific question, I mean, quantum computing research is real. It's being pursued.
3227.00s: The Chinese are just as far advanced, if not further than we are.
3231.00s: And, um, Kurzwell is going to be proven right.
3237.00s: What do you think of the other way? Do you think that there's an impact that the advancement of AI and or quantum computing can have on the future of energy?
3249.00s: Yeah, in the short term, it is bullish for demand.
3254.00s: And in the intermediate term, it's bullish for supply.
3258.00s: But there is going to be a gap.
3261.00s: And I happen to interview a CEO of a nuclear startup for a private meeting at the request of a friend, which I'm always happy to do.
3273.00s: And he was telling me about the demand forecast just in Texas.
3279.00s: They need another grid in the next eight years.
3283.00s: And they have no track record of materially growing the grid.
3288.00s: What did you help me? I don't understand the scale of that. It sounds big, but I don't know how to make it.
3294.00s: So if they have 80 giga lots of installed capacity today, they need 200.
3300.00s: And you need to meet future demand.
3303.00s: Just unbelievable numbers.
3306.00s: To the point where you're going to run out of gas turbines, and there's a shortage of those, and you're going to run out of transformers, and there's a shortage of those.
3312.00s: And this is why we believe that a piece we wrote last year will prove prescient.
3318.00s: The piece was called E-reconcilable differences where we predicted that AI is intapetable with the grid. Why?
3328.00s: The grid is useful to society incredibly so, but only if it's at least three nines reliable and cheap.
3336.00s: You can't put AI into the existing culture and architecture that we use to build maintain and manage the grid and succeed with the speed that AI demands.
3348.00s: Without radically driving the price higher, which crushes everybody in society, especially Joe Sixpack.
3354.00s: So this is why I think distributed SMRs natural gas goes in one side.
3359.00s: Data comes out the other. Fission happens on one side of the building and data comes out the other.
3364.00s: Is this solution where you don't have to worry about grid connections you aren't creating demand?
3369.00s: Because like these companies will pay way more than you and I like to pay, or industry likes to pay for electricity.
3374.00s: And we need you and I and we need industry, because ultimately AI is supposed to be in service of us and not the other way around.
3382.00s: So I think that's the trend doesn't mean that the friction of the transition from where we are on, you know, this directs you were on today to that realization isn't going to be let's say interesting.
3395.00s: Another that we're at time I had one more question if you have a moment sure.
3399.00s: Yeah, also I'll keep it quick.
3401.00s: When we're looking out over the rest of the year and you're thinking of the interplay of literally everything that's going on today.
3410.00s: Like if you were to pick two or three primary themes your most interested in remainder of the year, what are those.
3418.00s: Yeah, Trump's response to Russia's continuation of the war in Ukraine.
3426.00s: Whether Trump falls into the trap of going to war in Iran.
3432.00s: And whether Trump can achieve a date on with China over the Taiwan issue.
3438.00s: And if he succeeds in avoiding escalation, especially in the last two, he will be a pretty consequential president in my view.
3456.00s: And I think you know, Trump is kind of like the last person I spoke to kind of guy like if you get Trump he's going to.
3464.00s: He's a people person he's very high EQ right.
3467.00s: And so he just spent a lot of time in the Middle East and got noticed that he didn't stop in Israel, which is interesting.
3475.00s: So that that's what I'm watching.
3479.00s: If we go to war in Iran, I think it'll sink his presidency.
3483.00s: I think he knows that intuitively.
3484.00s: There's a lot of people in Washington want to go to war in Iran and many of them work in his administration.
3489.00s: So, you know, Russia Ukraine is sort of it is Biden's war and Trump's at least trying to end it.
3496.00s: And you could plausibly say that it wasn't really his fault.
3501.00s: But if Iran happens, that's him and if China happens, that's him.
3507.00s: And war is always a failure of diplomacy and it would be Trump's failures.
3510.00s: And so I quite literally pray that he navigates the situations in a voice conflict.
3517.00s: Really interesting.
3520.00s: Very last one I promise if you were to attach a probability to those different outcomes.
3526.00s: How are you weighing the odds?
3529.00s: Or that Trump's going to walk away from Ukraine.
3532.00s: And the narrative will be the sort of classic stab in the back narrative and it would be Trump's fault that Ukraine collapsed.
3538.00s: And if only we hit we the US had, you know, ship more weapons or give more intelligence or help on longer the Russian and cognitive collapse.
3545.00s: History will decide all of that.
3547.00s: I think Trump is pretty fed up with that whole situation and wants to wash his hands of it.
3551.00s: I give it 8020 cuts a deal with Iran.
3557.00s: And and 6040 cuts a deal with China.
3561.00s: That's my just got, you know, yes, my question on my feet.
3564.00s: That's my gut.
3565.00s: Yeah, of course we'll get it on polymarket and then we'll see how it goes.
3569.00s: As always, it's honestly so fun hanging out chat with you.
3574.00s: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and thank you for just sharing stuff for people to noodle.
3579.00s: Right, like we talked about before the podcast.
3582.00s: The goal isn't to say things that people like or dislike.
3585.00s: It's to talk about things as they are and then let people noodle on it, right?
3589.00s: And then admit, admit when you're wrong.
3591.00s: Yeah, and look, I mean, if we wanted to create a clickbait newsletter, I don't know how to do that.
3596.00s: It's not what we're in for.
3597.00s: So I always appreciate our conversations.
3598.00s: They're serious, they're flexible. They're stimulating and always look forward to coming back on and always happen to see a request to do so hit our inbox.
3607.00s: Beautiful. Well, thank you for hanging out.
3609.00s: Yep.
