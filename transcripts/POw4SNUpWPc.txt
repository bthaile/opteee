0.00s: Options are really informed markets. We can glean a lot of information even if you're
5.46s: not an options trader, but if you are all the better. The goal is videos to walk you
9.20s: through three of my absolute favorites, options analysis tools, so that you can make better
14.76s: informed decisions because at the end of the day, leveraged markets are almost always
19.74s: going to bring in a lot of really smart, a lot of very smart, a lot of very smart money.
30.94s: Okay, it's not all smart money. You will find degenerates that find their way into options,
38.22s: but don't let this represent our illustrious community. There are a lot of smart money
44.56s: and traders involved in options markets. It's actually where a lot of interesting phenomena
51.68s: and effects can be found. Take for example, something like this. If we take a look outside
57.24s: of our friends at Wall Street Bet and we look at something like insider trading, what's
62.02s: smarter way is there to make money than insider trading? Take for example, our very own
69.08s: icon, somebody like Nancy Pelosi, who clearly is not insider trading, but her portfolio
74.92s: is returned over 700% in a decade. That's pretty impressive. It must just be really
80.16s: good at analyzing stuff. Joking aside, insider trading is actually a pretty smart expression
87.24s: for people. And the reason why people will use options to try to chase down insider
91.44s: information is because of the leverage. We can also look at option pricing and its
97.24s: informative of market moves. We can look even in really big indices like the S&P 500
104.32s: and we literally can extrapolate where probabilistic moves might be based on options positioning
111.12s: and it tends to be pretty damn good. The reason this all comes together is because if
116.60s: you have an educated opinion and you're trying to monetize it, most people who are strongly
122.28s: convicted in that educated opinion are going to look for leverage because you can make
127.12s: more money. So let's talk about how we can use some of these different tools to make
133.84s: us more money in trading options. We're going to start with very basic probabilities.
139.88s: Now probabilities derived from options trading are actually highly informative. So let's
145.16s: take a look at something like lunar and we can see this is what's called a probability
149.64s: comb probability analysis from think or swim. There's different tools that plot this in
153.08s: different ways. You can even make your own if you don't have access to this platform.
156.52s: You can do it in Excel. I've done it a bunch of times. What this does is on the X axis
161.56s: shows you based on different days to expiration duration. The Y axis shows different prices.
167.84s: And right now I have it fit to be probability of a touch within a one standard deviation
172.80s: range. So what this means is let's say what do we think the probability of lunar hitting
177.52s: 15 is within the next two weeks 14 days. Well rather than guessing or going off of some
183.92s: janky assumption that you have because you feel it in your left ventricle and you think
188.84s: that that's your heart's telling you the right direction your heart's probably aligned
191.84s: to you. But we could take a look at the 15 strike in 14 days and you can see it's a 24.71
198.00s: percent probability of hitting that you literally can quantify the probability of these things
202.00s: happening. This really feeds into our ability to structure trades informatively because
207.48s: then we can look at things like expected returns based on the probability of this price
213.44s: being hit within our time frame. And then we can look at what our P and L would be at
217.72s: those points and make an informed decision. We can use delta as an approximation for an
224.64s: option being in the money at expiration. But it's only an approximation and I'll show
230.36s: you why that's the case because the probability of an option being in the money or out of
234.52s: the money actually have their own calculations. For those that geek out over this stuff
240.20s: as much as I do, you can actually check out this video which I realize this is the wrong
245.68s: one because if you go there, you're going to find a bunch of formulas and stuff and most
249.56s: people are going to click off and never come back. I'm just kidding. For those that are
252.40s: actually interested in why delta is used as an approximation for probability of in the
258.28s: money, you can check out this video, throw a link to the description below to it. And
264.88s: suffice it to say that the calculation for delta is very similar to the probability of
269.52s: an option being in the money or out of the money similar. They're not the same. And
272.72s: let me show you exactly how this works. So we'll stay in lunar for our example. We'll
276.88s: go into the trade window here and let's just pick this nine days expiration. If we take
282.76s: a look at delta, which is this column on the call side, we take a look at this 39 delta
286.52s: option. Well, actually, let's start with the 48 delta option. With the 48 delta, we
291.36s: would expect there to be a 48% probability of this option being in the money at expiration.
296.60s: If we take a look at the out sugar calculated probability, it's 41.34%. So it's actually
302.24s: a pretty big difference. It's six points in change. Why is it so different? It's so different
308.76s: because volatility really exacerbates this phenomenon. So if you take a look at something
315.72s: like Apple for a quick near term example, nine days expiration. And we take a look at
322.36s: the 50 delta, you notice that the 50 delta probability is actually 48.91%. So it's actually
328.80s: pretty close, right? Like not not too far off. Well, even for something that is lower volatility
334.40s: a little more evenly priced markets, if we go far enough out in time, let's just pick
338.60s: this 191 days expiration. We'll do this 46 delta. The 46 delta option has a 39% probability
347.80s: of being in the money. So you notice as you go further out in time, the variance between
352.00s: delta is an approximation in the actual calculation, widens. You'll also notice that it's really
357.68s: dependent on volatility. So if we have more volatile stock like lunar and we go further
362.92s: out in time, let's take a look at this 40 delta. This is actually a 26.2% probability of
370.96s: being in the money, even though it's a 40 delta. So when you use delta, it can work just
376.72s: fine in near term stocks, meaning near term expirations for those stocks. And then also
382.52s: stuff that's not quite as volatile, but just know that there are limitations and it's not
386.36s: perfect. You can also use these probability cones that are just simply baked into the
391.72s: expiration cycle. So you'll notice that we can see what's the probability of lunar within
398.32s: the next nine days, falling within a 1.62% or 1.62 dollar range. And it's a one-stand deviation
408.00s: probability of being in there. So we can use all these different probabilities to inform
413.80s: our trades. The next piece here is volatility. We can use different elements of volatility
420.36s: to inform what we think might happen. If you're familiar with the things that I do for a lot
425.60s: of the more meme slash growth style stocks like lunar like game stop, we use volatility
431.00s: a lot. So let's take a look first at this idea of smile and surface. Now again, for those
438.24s: interested in going a little further into detail, I have two videos for you. I have one
442.64s: that talks about volatility, volatility surfaces, IV rank, IV percentile, all those kinds
447.44s: of things here. And then this one talks about volatility surfaces and smiles. Now I'm
452.12s: just going to give you a quick synopsis again for those that might not be interested in
455.92s: all the nerdy details. We can go back over to the option chain and we can plot the implied
463.04s: volatility for different options in different expiration. So all of these different lines
469.60s: represent a different expiration different this purple here is 13Ds, this kind of I don't
475.88s: know what color that is pink ish is 27Ds and so on and so forth. So if we clean this up,
480.52s: just pick a couple of the main explorations to make it a little more clear. We can visualize
485.32s: what the volatility is for different strike prices at different points in time. And why
490.84s: is this informative? Well, very often you'll find this kind of configuration where the
496.28s: out of the money puts have much, much, much more expensive implied volatility compared
500.96s: to the out of the money calls. This is standard. Now what happens if you see this flipped?
507.28s: What happens if you see the call side have way more implied volatility than the put side?
512.04s: Well, that means that the market is actually a little more nervous about something going
516.20s: up and it's pricing in the probability of an upside move a little more heavily. And
521.48s: a decent example of this typically, I don't know if it is right now, but actually we
525.80s: do see it right now in GameStop. So if we take a look specifically at this 20Ds expiration,
531.44s: take a look at that. We can see that it's actually pricing the out of the money calls way
536.60s: more richly than the puts, which is not normal. That means that there is an expectation of
542.56s: an upside move, which is why these are being priced more richly. We can also see which strike
547.44s: prices are being priced more richly compared to other ones. Like for example, the 36 handle
553.20s: is here is definitely priced more richly compared to the 37 handle stuff like that. So that's
559.32s: more for more specific options trading and volatility traders. Now implied volatility percentiles
566.92s: a really important concept. This plots the volatility, the implied volatility for a stock
574.28s: against itself. Now there's a difference between implied volatility percentile and implied
579.76s: volatility rank suffice it to say that other video will go way further into detail on the
585.48s: differences, but implied volatility percentile is typically a better metric. The reason why it's
591.16s: better is it's less prone to skew. So if we go back to GameStop, we can see that the implied
597.44s: volatility percentile is 61, but the implied volatility rank is only 20%. Why is this?
604.32s: implied volatility percentile plots the current IV and it literally looks at out of the past year,
613.48s: how frequently is the volatility higher or lower than where we are today? So what this means in
621.40s: this case is 61% of the time, volatility is lower than where it is right now. So it means
628.40s: volatility is actually quite elevated. Why does implied volatility rank only show it at 20?
633.60s: It's because this metric is very prone to skew. It uses the extremes. So even though we're
641.00s: definitely on a higher relative volatility over the past year, something like implied volatility rank
647.12s: is going to include these kinds of moves when we have the squeeze back in the spring slash
652.64s: summer. So that metric is going to be skewed in here until that data point falls off. This is
657.36s: why I prefer implied volatility percentile. This tells us on a relative basis how volatile something
663.44s: is. Then we also have implied volatility versus realized or historic volatility. This again is more
670.88s: for the volatility traders out there, but this is how we can capture things like variance risk
676.64s: premiums. So what we want to see is how frequently is implied volatility running overstated relative
683.28s: to historic volatility. All this means in simple terms is the market is pricing in bigger moves
690.32s: than are actually happening. And as you guessed it, I have a video that dives deeper into detail on
695.76s: that. All the links to these will be in the description for you to check out whenever you feel like it.
700.48s: Why does that matter? Well, because if you're buying options, it means that you're typically buying
705.52s: options more expensive than what the moves tend to be. And then if you're selling options, you might
709.76s: be able to monetize that. Now we can also look at things like expiration volatility and skew. What
716.08s: does that mean? Let's take a look. First, we'll crunch that down pop over here. Expiration volatility
722.72s: gives us ideas on what might be happening in different time frames. So if I just eyeball through
727.76s: this, I can see that this 116 percent IV is much higher compared to the relative ones right before
734.56s: and after it. Why is that the case? It would be a bunch of different things. It could be partially
738.96s: because it's a primary expiration. It could be that there's an event expected going on here.
744.48s: More often than not, when you see a higher level of volatility further out in time than near-term
750.88s: stuff, it tends to mean something. We don't always know what it is. This is really useful for
756.64s: trading things like biotech stocks and whatnot. Now we already went over volatility skew in terms
762.48s: of out of the money puts versus calls in the way that that works on the volatility smile.
767.92s: But we can also take a look in the options chain itself to visualize puts skew. We can take a look
774.08s: at the individual implied volatility for these different strike puts right now. We're looking in
779.60s: GameStop 37 days expiration. And we can see, like for example, that these strikes are actually
786.56s: really, really cheap compared to something that's closer and further out of the money. So what am I
790.80s: showing you? These are trading at a 79% vol. 22. But if we take a look at the 26, it's an 86%
797.68s: vol. And if we go way out here to the 11, it's 151% vol. So we can take a look at which strikes
804.80s: themselves have anomalous volatility either higher low. And then we can also look at the volatility
810.88s: relative per delta and compare puts to calls. So a 30 delta option on the put side here is an 80.7%
819.92s: vol. We go to a 30 delta on the call side. And we take a look at the vaults 135% vol.
826.32s: That tells you a lot because typically there's what we call puts skew. The market tends to price
832.88s: puts more expensively than calls because the market fears the downside. But this case, it's
838.72s: inverse again, that's indicating that the market is expecting some sort of upside move.
845.68s: Now, the last thing on our list is a general tool volume and oh, we can use this to identify
852.48s: things like liquidity. And we can also use this to identify interesting options positioning.
859.76s: So let's take a quick look at what this looks like. First things first liquidity. So we can look at
866.08s: which of these contracts have really high volume and open interest. What you will almost always
872.96s: notice are the contracts that end in zero or five will have the highest open interest. This is
878.80s: just natural human tendency to like those kinds of round numbers. This will be across pretty much
885.28s: all products. So if I take a look at the 20 strike, there's 17,000 open interest. If I take a
890.56s: look at the 25 strike, it's 26,000 open interest. Everything in between it much smaller. Almost
895.52s: always the case. You'll also find that more often than not, most of the volume and open interest
901.60s: is going to be in primary expiration cycles because there's more liquidity there.
908.08s: Now, we can look to see if there's concentration at these different levels. And we can kind of
914.56s: use that to inform ideas. So one of the things you'll see me do is first find where we are in terms
920.56s: of explorations. So right now, when I look at the call options and put options in GameStop,
928.16s: I can see that most of the open interest is actually out in 17 Jan 25. There's a lot of cases
935.04s: where this will invert and we'll see it in near term explorations. That's the market expecting
940.88s: a near term price movement for some reason or another. That's usable information for us.
946.48s: I also like to see the total skew between call open interest and put open interest because
954.80s: when we see way more calls than puts, that tends to mean that the market is expecting an upside
961.20s: movement. That's why people are coming in here to buy calls. So we can also detect kind of
968.72s: standard activity, something like hedging behavior. So if we go into spy, you'll notice that the
975.60s: puts are really, really heavy. 12 million puts compared to 6.2 million calls. Why is that? Well,
981.68s: it's because a lot of entities will use spy or SPX to hedge a broad basket of stocks because
989.44s: there's a lot of things in the S&P 500 index. They might have individual holdings and individual
995.60s: companies. And then they'll come in here and they'll use this to hedge the whole portfolio.
1000.48s: Why does that matter? Because the context matters a lot. Because if you look at this outright,
1004.88s: you might say, wow, they're expecting a market crash. That's why there's so many excess puts
1010.24s: compared to calls, but it's not so much the case. You'll typically see it like this. Now you can
1015.04s: track the actual ratio. And when that starts to move, then it becomes a little more interesting.
1022.08s: So right now two to one puts to calls from tracking is I can tell you it's not that excessive.
1026.80s: But if we see something like four to one, five to one puts to calls, that's people really ramping
1032.40s: up downside protection for some reason or another. So these are three of my absolute favorite
1041.12s: options analysis tools. Let me know if you'd like to see a part two because this is the tip of the
1045.68s: iceberg. We can go way deeper in detail. And I would also love to know if you learned something
1051.28s: in this that's of genuine interest to me. So let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
