0.80s: things are heating up in GameStop if you
3.60s: can see up here after hours we're
6.88s: getting a little bit of a run I don't
8.28s: want to be too hyperbolic this isn't the
11.12s: end of days kind of move but this is
13.44s: also not an insignificant kind of move
15.64s: like I continue to remind you guys my
18.00s: goal is not to spread hyper fud it's to
21.88s: call it as best as I can see it and you
24.64s: can see it being really active right now
27.72s: after hours more so than usual it is
29.96s: covering right around 292 it almost
32.00s: cracked 30 I'm not sure if it actually
33.68s: got above 30 or not I wasn't following
35.60s: it the entire time but it was really
37.60s: close I was actually going to do this
38.96s: video when it broke above 30 and I
41.60s: haven't seen it do it yet but maybe it
44.08s: will while we're on here or maybe it
46.64s: already has and it will again who knows
49.60s: but let's talk about what's going on in
52.96s: GameStop the very first thing I notice
55.96s: is this drift continues and it's
58.52s: accelerating like pretty me y so we
60.92s: still have this chm low on the 1st of
62.72s: July and we've just been slowly rotating
66.00s: up and out just like this the other
69.32s: thing that's important to note take a
72.04s: look at our volume it's expanding and
75.16s: today it's now above essentially a two
78.76s: we reference range that's what this is
80.80s: this is a twoe average and you can see
84.24s: we are now tracking up above it which is
87.28s: not insignificant and the majority
91.00s: of this is buy volume 20% of the volume
94.48s: today was sale volume and yesterday it
96.80s: was a pretty light percentage of sale
99.44s: volume here as well so there's buying
102.64s: going on we can see that we can also see
105.68s: this starting to rotate up and there's a
108.56s: couple things that kind of line up
111.04s: really well here I want to as always
114.00s: give a shout out to my friend Newton
116.68s: who's he does a tremendous amount of
119.08s: work on this thing and he's like just so
122.36s: so so well-versed on all the background
125.00s: he and I have been talking at least
126.64s: touch and base most days just sharing
129.00s: some ideas back and forth and his sheet
132.04s: is really useful to kind of get an idea
134.68s: of some of these different timing
136.60s: components and he does a great job
139.64s: keeping this thing up to dat with things
141.80s: like xrt volume with things like
145.24s: ftds also with things like tracking
148.84s: creation and this column here is
152.72s: actually really useful in case you're
154.52s: not paying attention to it because he's
158.00s: trying to forecast out what the price
162.16s: behavior in GameStop might be like
164.92s: predicated on all these different forces
166.88s: and cycles and this is getting really
170.08s: interesting because there's a mix of
171.80s: things going on that I can see from the
173.68s: sheet I don't want to pretend like I
175.48s: know anything about this anywhere near
177.16s: to the degree that he does so he's the
180.48s: Arbiter of Truth go watch his stuff
183.12s: about this it's fantastic I just follow
185.44s: along with the two cuz I find it
186.72s: fascinating and the punchline as far as
189.96s: I see it right now is there are some
192.44s: interesting relationships going on with
196.00s: respect to FTD cycles and Redemption
198.28s: cycles that seem to be feeding into some
201.28s: of the price activity that we're seeing
204.00s: now getting back closer to my sphere
207.24s: which is options here's what we got
209.12s: going on huge call volume today as let
212.40s: me open this up to encapsulate all
214.84s: strikes you'll see that there is
217.20s: 344,000 calls traded today against
221.56s: 89,500 puts so massive call SK in terms
226.92s: of OI I mean in terms of volume sorry to
229.44s: be specific actually I bet you it's in
231.44s: terms of OI as well let's take a look
233.92s: also in terms of OI not anywhere near as
236.32s: extreme though because we're looking at
237.92s: 891 th000 calls to
240.80s: 5,000 or I'm sorry 500,000 puts so it's
244.96s: still a pretty big call skew but not
247.16s: quite as much in oi as volume as we take
251.08s: a look across these expirations the
253.32s: Lions share this 344,000 lives in this
257.24s: front expiration this is crazy
261.08s: 24,500 all for this week case you guys
264.00s: didn't know it's uh Tuesday got a couple
266.68s: days left here 3 days it's not
268.68s: necessarily A ton of time ah great those
271.68s: short calls are in the money as I was
273.60s: actually talking to some folks in the
274.84s: Discord really all we needed was me to
277.68s: offer some short options against my long
281.08s: options in Long stocks in order to get
283.04s: the rally I forgot right that's how the
284.84s: market is no matter what you put on
286.52s: it'll find a way to make you wrong so I
289.32s: mean honestly I should apologize to
291.56s: everybody because all I needed to do was
294.60s: to add some short options against the
297.04s: long deltas and then obviously it would
299.48s: rip my face off why wouldn't it why
301.24s: wouldn't it do that and it's doing it so
305.12s: my bad for not just doing that earlier I
306.96s: forgot that that's all I needed to do
309.88s: and and the funny part is if I would
312.08s: have just left long options on we all
314.24s: know this would be a completely
315.32s: different video about how for whatever
316.96s: reason GameStop was getting punished to
318.68s: the downside and all my long Deltas were
320.92s: worth nothing you know it's it's just
322.56s: how it goes in this business so anyways
326.76s: they they are in the money we're going
328.04s: to have to figure that out in a couple
329.04s: days that's a future Eric problem can't
330.48s: worry about everything at once here's
332.64s: what we need to look at this right here
335.60s: is very topical very topical
342.12s: 73,9 open interest at these 30s
348.40s: 57,6
350.56s: 47 volume on these big
356.32s: volume if these fall in the money this
360.00s: gets real interesting real fast even
363.60s: this after hours move that we're
365.44s: starting to see gets interesting the
368.16s: reason why this gets interesting is as
371.12s: these get closer to falling in the money
372.92s: which they are right now as we're
374.04s: talking as you can see up here as these
376.76s: get closer and closer to falling in the
378.28s: money market makers have to do something
380.40s: with their position to hedge their risk
381.96s: in the event that these are in the money
384.60s: come expiration because then they're on
386.64s: tap to start delivering shares so that
389.00s: means that they need to find them
390.44s: somewhere so if that does start to
393.84s: happen that likely will lead to some
396.08s: sort of buying pressure on gme how high
399.04s: does it launch from there it really
400.44s: depends on how many people scale into
402.16s: this because there's a lot of weakness
404.08s: after this strike like again let's just
405.68s: keep it a buck after the 30s the 30 and
408.44s: a hals are dry the 31s are small the 31
412.56s: and a Hales are dry the 32s start to
416.20s: offer something but still not a ton 33s
419.32s: are light 34s are light it doesn't start
421.48s: getting bigger until the
423.24s: 35s so it would need to find a pretty
427.36s: big breath of fresh air and have enough
429.96s: one of its back even if it does fall
432.56s: into the 30s for all of that buying
434.20s: pressure to move us five points from 30
436.16s: to 35 can happen absolutely can happen
438.44s: want to be clear about that but it
441.00s: wouldn't necessarily be quite as simple
443.28s: as this buying volume if these je fall
446.12s: in the money immediately means we go
448.24s: there it probably would require ire a
450.36s: little bit broader participation and
452.88s: stuff like that we'll have to see so the
455.24s: other thing I want to look at super fast
457.52s: is the volatility here so let me open up
460.04s: all series we're going to take a look at
461.36s: the implied volatility we're going to
462.52s: look at the out of the monies as per
463.92s: usual and interestingly enough I'm going
467.84s: to kill it to just these two so it's a
469.52s: little less noisy notice all these Kinks
471.44s: showing up that happens when there's a
473.76s: big change in volatility when the market
475.96s: is trying to synthesize new information
478.80s: new data coming out new behaviors you'll
481.88s: see this happen right here and this is
485.64s: pretty interesting because again as I
488.08s: always say it's tradable but more
489.76s: importantly than that as we typically
491.40s: see the put side is growing pretty
493.40s: massively as per usual and the call side
496.72s: is expanding but not quite to the same
499.24s: degree and from an expiration cycle
502.16s: these two are popping a lot this is now
504.76s: broke above 200% this is broke above
507.60s: 175%
509.56s: but if I'm not mistaken looking out to
512.48s: something like the 26
516.64s: July these look pretty
519.08s: quiet well the call side has huge
522.12s: implied volatility but that's not what I
523.44s: was looking at I wanted to talk about
525.24s: the open
526.32s: interest yeah 77,000 to 28 so they're
530.04s: there but it's lighter these Opex weeks
532.96s: are really important because these are
534.40s: way more liquid and this is where a lot
536.68s: of activity is going down and we don't
539.24s: have another big opportunity here until
541.76s: 16 a which is 31 days away from here if
544.52s: we take a look at the oi for 16 a it's
547.16s: 162k versus 89 so already positions
550.84s: being built there but not necessarily
554.16s: huge huge positions just yet so lot of
558.12s: volume today a lot of it centered in the
559.88s: 19 July people are getting very very
561.96s: active out here with like the 19 July
563.96s: 30s like I said 57,000 of those came
567.16s: through today so if we take a look at
569.20s: the
570.20s: 19 July 32 calls 3,000 of those came
573.48s: through at
574.84s: 98 not a massive position but not an
578.00s: insignificant position to kind of help
580.00s: people see this more clearly people tend
582.24s: to see this side a little better which
584.72s: is totally understandable I get that let
587.60s: me get rid of these puts we're just
589.32s: going to look at the call side coming in
592.92s: at the offer or above and we can see
596.96s: 57100
600.52s: trade came on for the N9 August
605.44s: expiration so this a little further out
607.36s: 16 August still getting hit October 18th
610.44s: getting hit 26th July getting hit so
613.28s: there's a lot of this bigger exposure
615.44s: being added in these further expirations
618.44s: so as I limit this to this coming
620.48s: expiration cycle it's not as active
624.60s: which I find a little interesting to be
626.08s: honest with you I would have expected
628.00s: with the price movement we've been
629.08s: seeing the last few days to see more
630.68s: people coming into these near-term
632.08s: expirations but this also does line up
635.40s: with some of the Redemption cycles and
637.92s: the delivery cycles that we've been
640.64s: discussing on the Saturday live streams
642.84s: with Newton which we have another one
644.16s: this coming Saturday don't forget to
645.48s: tune in it's already up on the channel
647.64s: for you to go check out and set an alert
649.96s: for when it launches but I would have
652.16s: expected to see more of this in these
653.80s: near-term expirations but they're all
655.76s: over the place people are building
657.16s: positions out which is I mean this is a
660.00s: lot of money here right all the way down
662.32s: here is the first the first cycle that's
665.32s: less than $100,000 so essentially this
667.76s: entire page almost is over $100,000
670.28s: trades this is completely different than
672.64s: what we've been seeing lately again like
674.56s: if I go back to the 9th of last week and
678.80s: we take a look there we had one trade
681.44s: that was 200k everything else sub
684.24s: 100,000 the vast majority in 30 and
686.40s: 20,000 who cares about that you know
688.88s: just peasant money over there we active
693.44s: out here on the 16th now looking at
696.48s: Millie being thrown around between these
698.32s: two positions right here you have a
699.40s: million bucks and then you probably have
702.24s: another million in change in this series
705.36s: so there's money coming into this thing
707.28s: which is very exciting to watch now a
710.96s: little bit early I think to read too far
713.20s: into it because a lot of things need to
714.96s: align in order for this to really start
717.20s: accelerating but I think a big big part
720.20s: that will be useful to see is the
721.56s: Redemption cycle coming up and the
723.08s: creation cycle and how that impacts the
726.92s: the underlying we see these building out
729.84s: more so the 30s out in 16 a 2400
734.12s: contracts were added net over yesterday
736.16s: with another 5,800 volume today out here
740.04s: at the 40s there's 12 12,000 oi 1500
743.52s: added 3677 volume today so people are
747.20s: scaling into these positions like that's
748.92s: very very clear to me and it's
751.68s: centralized in these standard expiration
754.36s: Cycles 19 July 16 August that's where
756.56s: most of the stuff are as you guys can
758.40s: tell I tend to put my positions a little
760.08s: further out I took the 18 Octobers down
762.28s: today because they showed a sizeable
765.56s: profit CU I went very deep in the money
767.60s: I had those for a while now as you can
769.00s: tell I'm not using the pass through
770.40s: account for this one mostly because I
771.76s: wanted to make the joke about this hey
774.56s: we don't like that these were deeper in
777.20s: the money before boo boo went these 29
780.12s: and halfs need I want this to be buried
782.64s: I want these shorts to be so far in the
784.68s: money that they get exercised early and
786.84s: it causes a massive problem for me
788.76s: that's what I want mostly for you guys
790.88s: it'd be a giant headache for me if those
792.60s: get exercise early if you're on the
794.08s: other side of those calls do me a solid
795.56s: don't exercise those please just let me
797.36s: close them out if you would be so kind
799.44s: because I'm not trying to deal with
800.80s: being
801.60s: short GameStop short shares on GameStop
804.32s: is I mean I have the I have long shares
806.68s: to offset it but I want those shares I
808.16s: don't want those to get taken away way
809.36s: so whoever's out there on the other side
811.48s: of these 29s whoever bought the 29's
813.56s: just chill if you would be so kind let
816.00s: me close this out and then feel free go
818.60s: Haywire go crazy exercise till your
820.40s: heart's content just just let your boy
822.40s: get out of this I mean look hook a homie
824.64s: up would you all
827.08s: right I am pretty excited I'm excited to
830.12s: see where this goes I'm excited to see
831.56s: this after hours movement it's not
833.72s: insignificant we need to keep a close
835.76s: eye on things I see volume expanding
838.60s: it's to see this isn't a log chart so
840.80s: this kind of skews stuff so much it
842.76s: makes this look really really compressed
844.96s: but it's not like if we move into to
847.24s: something that's much closer this is a
848.68s: 5day five minute chart just to give a
850.24s: different sense of magnitude this thing
852.40s: has been running for some time now so I
856.28s: am eager to see where it goes from here
857.92s: you can see where my alerts are set to
859.44s: the downside where I would be
861.00s: reconsidering the position SL adjusting
863.36s: my long Deltas to make sure I'm not
865.56s: stuck holding again it's different with
867.68s: options they're decaying assets so I
869.68s: can't just hold options if the Market's
871.96s: going against me because then I'm just
873.44s: bleeding money everywhere and that's not
876.68s: the idea believe it or not in the
878.00s: business the idea is to attempt to make
879.92s: money so that's what we're working
881.80s: towards maybe we'll see as always if
884.20s: there's any questions anything you want
885.36s: me to take a look at let me know be an
886.76s: outlier I'll see you guys later
