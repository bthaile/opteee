0.27s: all right everybody Eric here with part
3.84s: two of my favorite strategy which is the
7.35s: cash secured strangle I already
9.24s: introduced it in a previous video talked
11.37s: about kind of how I like to set it up
12.78s: when I look for those kinds of things
14.33s: now what I want to jump into next is how
17.70s: do we manage the trade so let's jump
20.67s: over to the main screen here and work
22.26s: through it first and foremost if you
25.67s: recall we kind of did a little bit of a
29.10s: management tree on how the trade works
31.50s: out so let's do that again real quick
32.91s: just to recap first I'm gonna sell to
35.46s: open a put of some sort and then one of
38.31s: two things is going to happen the put is
40.14s: either going to remain out of the money
42.48s: in which case I'll close for a profit
45.48s: and then sell another put and continue
47.43s: to do this circle here now the other
50.28s: scenario is we can end up in the money
52.77s: if we end up in the money there again is
55.74s: a branch of two possibilities the first
58.56s: one is we can roll the trade and based
62.13s: on how we choose to roll the trade it'll
65.76s: either end up out of the money or it'll
67.98s: end up in the money which we will
70.08s: continue this process here we can roll
72.42s: for some time I've rolled for over a
74.88s: year before so you can roll for some
76.68s: time or you can choose to allow
80.03s: assignment
82.16s: now if we allow assignment this
85.37s: essentially equals we now have a long
88.22s: position we own shares of whatever we
91.58s: sold the put on so now there's another
95.18s: kind of two lane approach here what'll
98.33s: happen is we're gonna create a covered
101.03s: call
102.90s: for the long shares so this is where
105.18s: were long shares and then we sell a call
112.13s: against these shares and then in this
115.88s: scenario one of two things will happen
117.65s: this will fall in let's keep the side
121.67s: out of the money started just to keep it
123.17s: the same so this will fall out of the
125.24s: money and if the calls remain out of the
127.82s: money we just sell another one and then
130.13s: continue that loop here or the calls
133.13s: will fall in the money
135.72s: in which case we'll be assigned and then
139.17s: we we will lose the lungs so then what
143.73s: will happen is the call will fall off
145.53s: we'll keep that profit and then the long
147.96s: stock is sold so we're going to sell the
149.97s: stock or sell the underlying
154.37s: at your strike price now let's go all
157.58s: the way back up here we're also going to
161.09s: sell another put
164.44s: and then this put here follows this put
169.80s: structure these two it's the same thing
172.63s: so I'm just moving this one down here
174.46s: now in which case one of two things will
176.56s: happen out the money in the money and it
178.30s: just follows down this tree so this is
180.67s: kind of our assignment tree or our our
182.23s: management tree in an individual so
185.62s: let's talk about the easy one let's
188.40s: first talk about this I'm gonna
191.71s: underline them so that they're kind of
193.00s: easier to see the different stages
194.35s: because I know the arrows might be a
196.51s: little confusing well let's just
202.19s: with those on our lines great okay so
205.01s: first let's talk about this out of the
207.08s: money position here this guy if we are
211.58s: out of the money the very first thing is
214.28s: if at any point in the trade I have a
217.40s: 60% profit I'm gonna look to take it
219.44s: down doesn't mean I always well but I'm
220.97s: gonna look at it I want to consider it
222.26s: very strongly now if I ever have a
225.50s: scenario where I have 80% of my max
228.08s: profit with greater than 50/50 percent
231.79s: based expiration on the original trade
234.41s: left I will take that down so let's say
238.19s: if I saw something with 40 days to
240.14s: expiration and then at 21 days to
243.92s: expiration we have 80% or higher max
247.31s: profit I'm gonna take that trade down
249.20s: the other scenario that can happen here
252.56s: is if I make 30 to 40% of the trade in
256.88s: less than 2 days I potentially will take
261.26s: that trade off now the way that I
263.27s: approach the out of the money management
265.19s: depends a lot on the current market
266.84s: conditions how I feel about the market
269.03s: at that point in time if I feel that the
271.67s: market is stable kind of continuing to
273.77s: climb that sort of thing like we've seen
275.66s: the last few years very likely would
277.79s: just leave a position on longer but if
280.10s: we're more in a market that we see now
282.17s: I'm less inclined to do that I manage
284.69s: positions a little more regularly so I
287.21s: can continue to realize profits and
289.25s: lower my outstanding risk so that's kind
292.64s: of that out of the money that handles
294.65s: this leg right here now let's talk about
299.09s: in the money so this is this leg right
302.72s: here
305.70s: and what I want to specifically talk
307.62s: about is this rolling portion which is
310.47s: this side right here
312.66s: so we already did this out of the money
314.64s: now we're assuming we're in the money
316.29s: and I'm not going to take assignment I
318.48s: want to roll
320.71s: I always know that the best role
324.25s: opportunity is going to take place when
326.05s: the strike price equals my short strike
329.77s: so if I sell a put at a 10 strike when
334.24s: the stock or when the underlying is
336.70s: trading around $10 is my best time to
339.31s: roll the reason being is because you can
342.82s: still typically roll out of the money at
345.34s: that point but I have some rules on how
349.72s: I approach this first and foremost I
352.18s: always always always make sure I get a
354.91s: credit for the roll always if you don't
356.86s: get a credit you're gonna make this a
358.93s: very difficult trade to manage for the
361.72s: long term the second thing is I monitor
366.19s: the size of my trade because when we
368.89s: roll we know we're closing the front
371.98s: position and we're establishing a
374.62s: further out in time position that should
378.67s: cover the cost of closing this front
381.13s: position so based on my assessment of
385.39s: the market my current thoughts I will
388.69s: look and adjust my size accordingly for
392.47s: example if I have a position that I put
396.49s: on with 40 days to expiration and with
399.22s: 35 days left to go it falls in the money
402.07s: I'm not gonna do anything the reason
404.98s: being is I like to wait until about 20
407.89s: days to expiration so that market just
410.71s: closed so that I
414.38s: able to maximize my use of weekly
417.56s: contracts and not have to roll out an
420.53s: entire month I try to roll out is little
423.38s: in distance as possible typically so if
427.34s: my strike is slightly in the money and
432.25s: there's 20 days left to go something
434.93s: like that I likely will roll that out to
437.87s: reestablish a new position you know 40
440.18s: 45 days to expiration however instead of
443.87s: selling a 5 lot I might only sell a 4
447.23s: lot but keep it at the same strike I
450.05s: might take some of my position off
452.09s: removing some risk from the trade let's
456.08s: say same scenario I sold a 40 day to
459.80s: expiration option we're at 22 days left
461.99s: to go and all of a sudden my option is
465.68s: far in the money so I if I roll out in
469.37s: time I'm collecting a very small credit
472.25s: in that scenario I might add some of the
476.78s: allocation I set aside for the trade so
479.78s: that I can add additional short puts and
483.43s: allow myself to roll closer to the money
487.09s: so in that example let's say if I sold 5
491.39s: puts at a 10 strike and I might have i'm
496.61s: the new position I establish might have
499.31s: six puts at a nine strike or an eight
503.12s: strike the goal is to move closer or out
506.12s: of the money so size can be adjusted to
510.20s: add risk or reduce risk depending on
512.81s: what the objectives are at that point in
514.58s: time
514.93s: now the duration for the rolls I hit on
518.24s: a little bit to start if I am wary of
522.65s: the market and concern that it might
524.63s: come down or if I feel there's it's
526.40s: bottom heavy like I do right now I try
529.04s: to let it get as close to expiration as
531.68s: I can so that I'm leeching all of the
534.80s: theta out so I'm not buying back a whole
536.75s: bunch of theta when I roll the position
538.46s: and once I get you know 1415 days to
543.20s: expiration in in a market like this I am
546.50s: gonna try to roll out
547.91s: time as little as I need to in order to
550.85s: roll down as well so if I want to roll
555.17s: out and down I might have to go two
557.63s: weeks or three weeks instead of just one
560.47s: if I am thinking that the you know
564.41s: position is on the dance floor I'm close
566.54s: I might just roll out to the same strike
569.48s: a week later and then the last kind of
572.66s: broad scenario is if I want to roll and
576.50s: I want to make sure I get out of the
579.08s: money I might have to go further out in
580.97s: time I might have to reestablish a new
582.92s: position in order to collect a new
585.17s: credit you know all the way at forty to
586.88s: forty-five days it's expiration
588.77s: something like that and again I'm gonna
591.44s: do a scenario for most of these because
593.42s: I know I'm talking about a lot of
594.59s: hypotheticals and it might be confusing
596.21s: so don't worry if what I'm talking about
599.15s: sounds a little abstract we'll do an
600.65s: example not on this video but the next
602.45s: one okay so let's jump over to kind of
605.75s: if we're gonna allow assignment this
607.43s: one's pretty quick so once we get to the
610.34s: 20 day window let's say again we sell to
613.31s: open five puts at the ten strike and
615.35s: we're at the twenty data expiration
617.36s: window we choose we want to allow
619.25s: assignment great we're gonna let the
621.47s: underlying continue to move towards its
624.89s: expiration now the week of expiration or
629.50s: whenever I see the extrinsic value of
632.48s: the option hit and nickel I'm always
634.52s: going to reevaluate one more time I'm
636.95s: gonna say okay do I really want to let
638.90s: this go to expiration and be assigned or
641.03s: do I want to potentially roll this now
643.21s: so that's kind of my last evaluation
646.25s: let's say if it hits that point we say
648.56s: nope I want to own the underlying pool
651.04s: once we own the stock I like to sell a
654.41s: covered call so what that means is I
656.75s: will take assignment I'm now along
658.91s: shares and I will sell a call above my
662.51s: basis always so if I'm assigned at ten
665.54s: I'm always gonna sell at ten or above
668.57s: there may be times where I can't sell
670.88s: and collect a premium above my basis
673.34s: that's fine
674.36s: I will wait because if you go back all
676.46s: the way to the beginning I already know
678.71s: I pick something I like to own so I will
680.93s: wait
681.45s: and then at the same time I will always
684.48s: outlay an additional put below my strike
688.20s: so if I'm at a short strike of ten I
691.40s: might sell an 8 foot or a 6 foot or 5 or
696.90s: 7 whatever something below my basis so
700.47s: what this does is it allows me to scale
702.51s: into the trade still collect a premium
705.84s: and then if I'm assigned again if I
708.39s: choose to allow assignment again then in
711.18s: only then my cost basis will reduce as
715.08s: my size increases so if we sold that 5
718.50s: lot and then now we're long 500 shares
720.69s: and then if we sell a 3 lot cheaper well
724.74s: now we're going to be long 800 shares
726.75s: but at a lower price so that's why I
729.12s: like to sell the additional put and then
731.91s: that's it we're just gonna repeat the
734.37s: put management until it's it's assigned
738.42s: again or we're rolling or out of the
740.91s: money just like the original diagram I
742.77s: shared or we're gonna keep going until
745.41s: that covered call is called away
747.92s: whenever the covered call expires
750.03s: worthless or is very close to expiring
752.76s: worthless I might take it down and sell
754.83s: another one and just keep doing that
756.69s: over and over again so this is my
758.67s: favorite strategy the cash secured
759.90s: strangle it's nothing to to manage it
762.63s: there's a lot of management that goes
764.28s: into it but it's not frequent you know I
767.10s: might put a trade on that has 40 days to
768.90s: expiration and adjust it once every 2
771.93s: weeks so it's there's a lot of thought
774.75s: that goes into the management but it
776.52s: makes the execution very easy and
778.62s: systematic so the next video I'm gonna
781.95s: do are a few different examples of
784.47s: either historical trades I've done or
787.17s: I'll share some of the trades I have on
788.76s: now so that we can see what this looks
790.62s: like in practical application so I hope
792.87s: this is helpful and I'm looking forward
795.03s: to exploring the strategy more with
796.29s: everybody talk to you guys later
