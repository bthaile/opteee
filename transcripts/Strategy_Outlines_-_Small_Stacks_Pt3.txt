0.72s: hey everyone eric here with part
3.04s: three of the small stack segment and
5.36s: this one i want to outline my strategies
7.28s: kind of what i'm looking to
8.96s: employ here so nothing new
12.48s: it's going to be cash secured puts to
15.04s: covered calls to cache secured strangles
17.68s: diagonals and maybe some verticals so
20.64s: let's walk through what i'm looking at
22.96s: the cast secured put covered call
25.04s: coverage strangle i bucket those all
26.64s: together because they're very
28.16s: defined this is going to be essentially
30.48s: my staple strategy
32.16s: for the put side i'm going to be looking
33.84s: at 0.2 to
35.20s: 0.3 deltas and it's because i want to
38.40s: balance
39.04s: probability of being assigned i want to
40.96s: avoid assignment but i also don't want
42.88s: to roll that much
44.64s: so to work around that that's why i'm
47.36s: looking at 0.2.3 deltas
49.92s: i would like to add to this make sure
52.72s: that i'm getting at least
54.64s: one percent return on invested capital
58.16s: and once i am assigned for the covered
60.96s: calls
61.44s: i i'm gonna make sure that the short
63.28s: strike is above my basis period so if
65.68s: there's a point where
66.64s: i can't sell calls above my basis i'm
70.08s: just gonna hold
71.20s: unless it hits my downside management
73.84s: which is going to be
75.36s: anything greater than a 10 drop
78.64s: would be a candidate to sell
81.92s: i will take a look at it if i still have
83.84s: strong convictions
85.04s: then i will likely hold on to the
87.12s: product longer term
88.64s: but once i hit 10 percent draw down
92.32s: i'm going to take a look if i am long
94.48s: stock
96.64s: or either the puts or calls i'm going to
100.40s: look at managing
101.52s: 55 max profit or once i get within that
105.20s: 20 days to expiration probably closer to
107.60s: 17 18 days
109.04s: so i'm going to want to try to squeeze a
110.40s: little bit more out of these
112.16s: now the other thing for managing unlike
114.72s: my regular account in this scenario i'm
116.88s: going to make sure that i can find
118.48s: a suitable replacement that is going to
121.44s: provide me
122.16s: a larger dollar amount than
125.52s: what is left in the current trade so for
127.68s: example
128.88s: if i sell put for 50 cents
132.72s: and there's you know 22 cents left on
135.68s: the table
136.80s: if i can find a trade that's going to
138.32s: give me more than 22 cents and i like it
140.64s: then i can manage this and enter another
142.96s: trade
143.68s: but i need to have a replacement in mind
145.76s: otherwise
146.88s: whether i hit that 55 or greater i'm
149.28s: gonna leave the trade on
150.72s: the reason why i've minimized rolling
152.24s: here is i
154.00s: smaller accounts don't have a lot of
155.20s: capital so if i continue to roll puts
158.24s: too much you have to remember each time
160.00s: you roll a put you're gonna
161.68s: book a loss and on smaller accounts that
164.24s: loss can add up
165.84s: and a lot of folks get confused where
168.64s: money goes
169.44s: but in short you have your net
172.56s: liquidating value which is your account
174.40s: if you neutralize everything and then
175.68s: you have your cash and sweep
177.52s: and when you roll your net liquidating
180.48s: value goes down because you're booking a
182.32s: loss
182.88s: although your cash and sweep will go up
185.04s: as long as you're pulling in a credit
187.60s: so sooner or later you can find yourself
189.36s: in a scenario where your net liquidating
191.52s: value
192.24s: is zero even though your cash to sweep
194.24s: can have a bunch of money in it because
195.60s: you've been rolling for a long time that
197.12s: sort of thing we want to avoid that
198.64s: i want to avoid that so that's why i'm
201.28s: going to
201.68s: roll cautiously that doesn't mean i'm
204.00s: not going to roll at all
205.44s: the reason why i say minimize it is
207.20s: because in my current portfolio
209.28s: i'll roll trades forever so i'm not
212.64s: gonna apply
213.44s: that thought process so this is a
215.76s: general rundown of those strategies
217.92s: i obviously have them in my options what
220.40s: 301
221.12s: segment so you already can
224.32s: you know see a thorough rundown of these
226.96s: this is just some general
228.48s: outlines next for the diagonals
231.60s: mostly going to trade them like a
232.80s: covered call i'm going to be looking for
234.56s: the long to be at least
236.32s: 90 days to expiration i find that this
238.96s: is a good
240.16s: return on the extrinsic value
243.68s: and it's gonna make sure that the trade
246.40s: has a little bit of time to work out i
248.16s: likely will be targeting
249.68s: six months at a true minimum or
252.80s: a leap the long is going to need to be
255.76s: at least
256.72s: a 80 delta i am going to look closer to
259.36s: 85 or 90
260.80s: depending on price and um
264.40s: just overall i'm an expiration the
267.04s: reason why i
268.00s: like such a long well such a
271.04s: high delta for my long is because i want
274.00s: to minimize
274.96s: slash eliminate upside risk i want to be
277.60s: able to sell calls
278.80s: aggressively so i can collect more money
281.12s: in order to eliminate that upside risk i
283.28s: gotta make sure i have a high delta on
284.80s: the long otherwise sooner or later
287.12s: short call delta will overwhelm the long
289.28s: delta if it's a short
290.96s: if it's if the long delta isn't high
294.08s: enough and then that's where you find
295.84s: upside risk
297.20s: the other thing is i want to pad myself
299.52s: in case the underlying moves a little
300.96s: bit against me
301.76s: i don't want to find myself in a
303.12s: scenario where
304.88s: i then cannot sell short calls close to
308.08s: the money because of this
310.00s: i also am going to look too short at a
312.72s: ratio
313.36s: so the short strikes i want to uncap
316.80s: my upside essentially and
320.32s: the other thing that's not on here is
322.08s: scaling in
323.36s: i want to pick products that i can sell
326.64s: i'm sorry that i can buy at least two
329.28s: leaps
330.56s: and well not necessarily leaps two longs
334.48s: and i will look to establish with
338.08s: half up front and then add that other
343.44s: long option you know sometime in the
345.52s: future depending on what the market
346.96s: throws at me
348.40s: and then the last piece is i'm gonna be
350.64s: looking at things that on a three month
352.96s: or six month chart
354.00s: are trading around or a little bit lower
356.40s: than their mean
357.52s: yet are still strong so fundamental
360.00s: analysis
360.88s: is going to be important for this
363.44s: strategy
364.72s: and then lastly verticals probably not
366.96s: going to trade many if any
368.80s: and essentially the only time i'm going
370.72s: to look to put these on
372.24s: is if i have a strong short assumption
375.44s: that i want to play out
377.36s: and for these i am going to make sure i
379.60s: have good expectancy
381.12s: probably wouldn't trade larger than a
383.28s: dollar wide
384.16s: and on those i'm going to collect at
385.60s: least 30 cents
387.20s: so i might be looking at trading a 40
390.24s: 40 delta and down but
393.28s: again i'm not expecting to see a lot of
395.52s: these however
396.96s: not writing them off completely so that
399.92s: wraps up a general overview of the
401.60s: strategies i'm looking to use
403.44s: if you have strategies that you like to
405.20s: use in your smaller account that i
406.32s: didn't cover let me know
407.84s: again that's the point of all this so
409.28s: that we can learn from another all right
410.72s: catch y'all later
