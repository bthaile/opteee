0.68s: what's up outliers a quick gme update
3.08s: keeping the Cadence alive here this
4.80s: should be a fast one because well a a
6.88s: couple things happened but none of it is
9.28s: super great in my opinion unfortunately
11.92s: so we did see GameStop have a fair down
16.04s: day 5% down and it hovered right around
20.80s: 22 a halfish right now after hours it's
23.52s: at 22 54x
25.80s: 58 and we have now fallen below at least
29.04s: what iew viewed as some near-term
32.68s: support so now the question becomes in
36.08s: my opinion how far down does it go you
38.04s: already see from the recent conversation
39.76s: we have this would be the next Target I
42.32s: see online which would be about 21 and
44.84s: that's just trying to find where people
46.68s: are transacting in the stock but
48.28s: unfortunately you can see here that this
50.88s: is where it corresponds on the volume
52.60s: node about right there and the volume
55.00s: node just waines and this is where it's
57.16s: actually the lightest which is at like
58.84s: 18 and A2
60.56s: so what that tells me unless buyers step
63.00s: in in some sort of really meaningful way
65.84s: uh I wouldn't be overly surprised if the
68.80s: selling continued is really what go down
70.60s: to as much as I don't like saying that
72.88s: the other thing is if I look at the
74.24s: volume for today you can see if you look
76.64s: right at this spot when I bring it over
78.32s: today you'll see that the uh the sale
80.72s: volume today was 96% so buyers were not
83.76s: really out here and it was very very
88.24s: much controlled by by Sellers and the
91.08s: part that bothers me with this is that
93.16s: it accelerated so if you take a look at
95.64s: this volume graph behind my head here do
98.76s: you notice how essentially it starts
102.56s: drifting up so let me get myself out of
105.68s: the way so you see how it's kind of
107.56s: bottoms here and then it slowly drifts
110.76s: up that matters actually to a pretty
113.48s: significant degree and the reason why it
115.44s: matters is because that tells me that
117.76s: even though there's a whole lot of sale
119.48s: volume today that more people are
121.44s: stepping in to conduct this selling so
123.88s: that's what that looks like to me now
126.28s: taking a look over at the options chain
130.28s: I see the put side starting to come in a
132.76s: little bit heavy here so we're now
135.24s: looking at a total put oi of 373,000
138.16s: against 650 calls we were just getting
141.76s: to a point where is about 2 to1 calls to
144.00s: puts but that has changed a little bit
147.48s: now the other thing that I am continuing
149.52s: to not is this here this is not unique
153.92s: but it is important to see is these 125s
157.12s: continue to be built out in the call
159.08s: side and for the kind of more reasonable
162.60s: strikes closer to the monies the 30s and
165.88s: most of the activity we're seeing is
167.44s: being built out in 16 a and this is
169.48s: something I've talked about before this
170.68s: is fully expected but the takeaway from
172.76s: this is to me that's where things start
176.52s: getting more interesting because we have
179.24s: way way more options in this expiration
182.80s: cycle if we take a look at the two a
186.24s: it's 112 calls to 49,000 puts nine OG 37
191.32s: calls 16k puts and in case you couldn't
195.16s: tell he 37,000 it's not just 37 it's
198.20s: more than that uh 16 OG is 215 to 110 so
203.28s: there's just way more activity going on
205.52s: in the next primary expiration cycle so
208.16s: what am I looking at going forward here
209.60s: well I'm still keeping a really close
211.28s: eye on the options chains and today I
213.80s: just did not see a whole lot that
216.12s: excited me to any significant degree I
219.20s: did see this position roll through but
223.48s: overall it's still just not that massive
228.04s: of a trade so if we take a look at this
232.16s: it's a little over $200,000 but this is
234.44s: on the sale side so somebody sold 2,8
240.56s: 47 of the two Aug 23 calls so they are
245.48s: looking to pull in a lot of Premium on
248.20s: these options on a relative basis that's
250.36s: a ton of money for what this wraps up in
254.16s: capital again on a relative basis on the
256.64s: call side I I'm sorry in terms of the
258.84s: buy side people buying options I don't
262.00s: see a whole lot I see a ton of these
265.00s: teeny options that are further out of
266.72s: the money right so we had 500 of the 33
270.24s: that are worth a nickel
272.32s: 489 of the 28s that are worth 8 cents
275.44s: right these are all just little options
277.24s: now this gets a little more interesting
280.16s: 392 of the CH 5S so that I'm kind of
285.16s: keeping a really close eye on the
286.88s: buildout of options chains where are we
289.40s: seeing options chains being scaled into
293.20s: that matters to me quite a lot so
296.36s: overall quiet day not a whole lot to
299.36s: walk through my short calls against my
301.92s: long shares a lot of people get confused
303.52s: when I'm talking about short calls it's
305.48s: I'm selling calls against shares it's a
307.28s: way for me to manage the downside of the
309.40s: position so on days like today where my
312.12s: Shares are not happy the short calls are
315.72s: so it offsets some of the holding risk
317.80s: of the position it's you know a
319.96s: something that I'll do at a ratio to
322.08s: never cap the upside potential but it
324.64s: allows me to handle smaller downsides
326.96s: like this so that's what I'm seeing
328.92s: today I'll see you all on the live
330.76s: session in a little bit be an outlier
332.72s: see you guys later
