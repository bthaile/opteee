0.00s: Man, oh man, what a busy week for this guy.
3.84s: You guys have sent me so much material to take a look at asking me to explore these different
8.28s: thesis and hypothesis and cycles that people think may or may not be happening.
13.16s: And I've been spending dozens of hours consuming and trying to understand and synthesize the
18.74s: data set.
19.74s: So I was watching the video from Biggie Smalls from Reddit.
23.08s: I've been watching a bunch of different Richard Noons video.
25.80s: I got one pulled up right now.
27.64s: And man, how fun is the puzzle?
30.48s: I'm having a blast from somebody like me that's been in markets for so long.
34.20s: I'm in my 17th year of trading.
36.96s: Finding really interesting things like this to try to dissect is very entertaining for
41.56s: me.
42.56s: It's just a cool thought exercise to run through.
46.04s: So what I'm working on now is actually a model that takes the different rulesets that
51.12s: they're outlining in terms of their assessment of when a cycle kicks off and some of the
55.32s: different things that might emerge over the course of a cycle and seeing if we can project
61.76s: forward any of it.
63.52s: Because the guys are doing a great job, specifically trying to stay as objective as possible.
67.28s: Nobody's like pontificating this is what's happening.
69.72s: Most of them are saying things like if this is the case, if this is true, which is massive.
74.08s: That's really important for you people that watch the videos because what you don't need
78.68s: are people that are skewing the way you receive information as you can tell them very
82.96s: against that.
84.12s: I want you guys to be able to make your own inferences based on the data that we can
87.88s: find and they're doing a great job at that.
90.04s: So I'm hopeful that maybe I can help pitch in in a really small way, but I'm mostly learning
95.04s: from them in terms of these theories.
97.88s: They're incredible.
99.20s: Now I'm not ready to dive into any of that yet.
102.20s: It's way too early.
103.20s: I need to collect a much larger data sample.
105.20s: I did a bunch of different money, Carlos simulations to get an idea of what this could
108.72s: look like using some historic data to shape the model.
111.84s: But it's way too early.
113.52s: I don't want to throw noise out there when we're really trying to solve a puzzle.
118.04s: So until I have something a little more concrete, I'm going to continue sticking to what I know
122.56s: to do, which is looking at options, markets, looking at markets in general and seeing what's
126.88s: going on.
127.88s: And today is the 23rd of June and we are back at another interesting weekend.
133.72s: So what I'm doing now is comparing the options chain from 21 June to 23 June.
140.96s: And I'm looking at a few different things.
142.48s: I'm tracking this expansion of volatility for each expiration cycle across all of them,
149.92s: essentially going all the way out the full options chain.
153.48s: And I want to see what the variance or the delta and volatility is between the 21st and
158.84s: the 23rd.
159.84s: I want to see how they're calculating that on a vol per day remaining.
164.56s: And I'm kind of building this out in parallel because one of my ideas is market makers
170.64s: are pretty smart.
172.08s: So if this is something that we on the retail side are starting to get a glimpse at, my
177.64s: hypothesis is the market makers already know all of this.
180.80s: I have to make that assumption because they get to see all this data.
183.80s: We're piecing it together from all these other pieces.
186.52s: And yet they already have the picture because they're pretty much the ones executing it.
191.56s: And especially in biggie small idea in terms of them internalizing orders.
196.40s: There's a lot of questions I have with that just in terms of the sourcing of the shares
199.80s: and stuff like that.
201.24s: But again, I'm not looking to add a bunch of conjecture out there.
203.92s: I'm just looking to understand right now, right?
206.80s: Just like our boy, what was it?
209.20s: Seven habits of highly successful people seek first to understand then to be understood.
214.04s: So I'm very much in that first phase seeking to understand now when I look across the
219.92s: options chains.
221.56s: The very first thing I'm noticing is that the absolute gross variance in volatility per
227.56s: day is essentially happening 19 July and in because that takes us even to 20% or 0.2%
238.28s: vol variance on a per day basis going out 2060 to and then it really starts to drop off precipitously
245.56s: beyond that.
246.76s: So what that tells me is that we're still seeing relatively more action in these near term
252.72s: explorations, which is very common.
254.36s: That's nothing super novel with options in general.
258.00s: The front explorations to rivetives really across the board.
260.72s: We'll see way more activity in the front explorations are going to be more liquid and
264.32s: more active stuff like that.
265.92s: So nothing in here screaming at me as strange.
271.04s: What is strange to me though is looking at the variance variance in volatility between
276.72s: this coming week and the next week.
279.08s: This is very big.
280.72s: So the change that we've seen so far in volatility from the 21st to the 23rd for this 28
286.88s: June expiration cycle is not insignificant.
290.00s: So 27.7 point variance in vol, which is 5.55% vol per day as compared to everything else
298.72s: which is sub 1%.
300.48s: So again, this goes back to kind of this standard game of hypothesizing what's going on.
306.88s: And one of the things I noticed right out of the gate, let's look at the out of the
310.64s: monies is that we're seeing the same massive call implied volatility skew.
319.68s: So again, the reason why I put the cursor here is so that you can see where it caps out
324.48s: on the put side, which is right now like 4748 something like that.
328.96s: And on the call side, we have vols all the way out at the 128s.
333.76s: That's like 580.
336.04s: And again, we can confirm it by going out here.
338.52s: We could pop out to those 128s.
340.20s: Take a look at the current vault 580 right on the nose.
342.84s: So a few things going on here, the first one, there's a lot of activity in these really far
347.08s: out of the monies.
348.12s: And this is probably a lot of people throwing their money away, genuinely speaking.
351.88s: And I don't want to see that.
352.92s: And I say it that way because I made a video that a link in the description below for you to
358.36s: check out on how to buy call options specifically and things like GameStop smarter.
363.00s: Because what's happening is the market makers are juicing up these really far out of the money
369.00s: premiums. And again, this isn't necessarily to like screw it to the retail traders.
374.44s: It's because if they assess risk, that's where they're going to try and cover their risk.
379.64s: And what that means is as they're trying to make a market way out here in the nose bleeds,
384.44s: they have to carry this crazy inventory that again for something like GameStop,
389.72s: there's always the puncher's chance that this thing just flies off the handle and you don't know when
394.92s: yet waiting to see how much headway we can make on these different cycle hypothesis.
401.16s: But right now we really don't have a concrete understanding of when they kick off for now.
406.68s: And I actually one of the things one of the reasons why I'm tracking volatility like this is I
411.16s: actually think we might be able to see the market makers pricing it in if they know it's going to
415.72s: happen before it happens.
417.56s: Now it's kind of difficult because sometimes with these really far out of the money strikes,
421.32s: there will be kind of flash orders that could send out there by the market makers.
424.60s: And that's because they don't want to expose their volatility calculations if there's no
428.68s: market being made right now. So essentially what that means is they'll rest orders
433.24s: at a wall that they don't actually think it is right now. But if people start coming in to kind
438.68s: of trade on the market, they would update their orders. And this is more of competition between
443.48s: market makers as compared to you versus them. But anyway, you should know that that's a thing as well.
449.96s: So when I am looking at this chain, I'm seeing a ton of really far out of the money options.
456.36s: Now this becomes really, really important. If big if if GameStop starts rising like crazy,
467.00s: if GameStop starts flying up, this creates massive buying demand from market makers because
474.92s: here's the deal right now, even for these right here. For example, there's 14,600 volume
482.60s: at the 30s it looks like. And there are only a 21 delta. So right now, the market makers aren't
489.40s: super incentivized to carry a full hedge. They probably maybe uses a bettics the way that they do
496.44s: their businesses, obviously, discrete to them. I don't know. But we know kind of the general
501.48s: approaches that they will take. What we do know is that there's no incentive for them to have 100
506.36s: shares in their account to cover this 21 delta position. We know that. The reason why it becomes
511.88s: really interesting if there's a big price increase is because as these get closer to at the money,
518.12s: the market makers need to accumulate more shares unless they can internalize the order,
522.92s: meaning provide from their own inventory. That creates buying pressure. The more that that
529.40s: happens, the more that they have to hedge. This is exactly what a gamma squeeze is. That's the
534.68s: primary differentiator between a gamma squeeze and a short squeeze is a gamma squeeze is driven
540.76s: by market maker activities. They're just trying to hedge their position to capture the bid-asks,
544.84s: spread and go home with the money that they made on the spread. But in order to do that, they need
550.04s: to get rid of and scrub off the excess risk. Because the thing is for options that are further in
554.92s: the money, especially like 60 delta plus, they already have most of the position if not all of it
560.36s: hedged, especially as it gets closer to expiration. But for these out of the money, they're not at that
566.04s: point because they're more likely than not going to expire out of the money. But if for whatever
571.16s: reason, there's a catalyst that starts driving price, then they're forced to start hedging these
577.40s: in a really short term time frame. That is where things start to get very interesting.
582.52s: Does that mean that's going to happen this week? We have no idea yet. We literally have no idea yet.
586.60s: When I take a look at the price action overall in GameStop, take a look, let me get my head out of
593.00s: the way. Take a look at the volume. It's just become anemic. And the other thing I find interesting is
600.28s: the amount of sale volume that came in on the 21st. That also very interesting to me.
607.88s: There could be a theory that the market was trying to scrub the price below the 24 handle.
615.00s: Why would they want to do that? Because then the 24s then expire worthless. And that's close enough,
620.28s: but that's not outside the realm of possibility. Now, especially with something that had really low
626.92s: relative volume, there's 28 million shares on the 21st. So going into this week, what I'm really
633.80s: wanting to keep a close eye on is how does the front wall play? I want to keep an eye on this smile
642.36s: because my expectation if this week follows anything like last week is the put side is going to
648.36s: start jacking up, which again for options traders, that's a tradable event. You can trade the
653.24s: expansion and put side wall compared on a relative basis to the call side wall. Or both of them in
659.48s: conjunction, which is probably even more likely the case in this scenario because we saw both the
664.60s: put and call side wall for the far out of the money is jack up into the expiration this past week.
671.32s: The other thing I want to keep a really close eye on is the order flow. So I have a bunch of
675.24s: different alerts and scans set to track both large orders and total flow. So that one, I can see if
685.08s: any anomalous purchasing starts occurring or two, if there's any big pricing opportunities that
692.36s: emerge from what we're seeing so far at least, that's what we got for today. If there's any
698.52s: questions or anything else that I should follow up with, let me know. I love seeing what you guys
702.52s: are sending me. So any of these different videos post anything like that that you think is worth
706.68s: taking a look at, let me know because again, I've said it a million times, you guys know this stuff
711.40s: way better than I do. I am getting caught up. I know options really well. That's my space,
717.32s: but getting into all of the lore and the background behind this product and the history behind it is
722.20s: kind of what I am in the drinking from the fire hose phase, getting caught up as fast as I can.
727.40s: All right, you guys. Be an outlier. Enjoy your weekend. See you all later.
