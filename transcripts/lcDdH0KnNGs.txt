451.00s:  so
452.00s:  God
455.98s:  what
474.98s:  am I
477.00s:  don't
478.00s:  But because I noticed that even when we were in Norway, we went over this massive overpass
484.44s:  and we came up to this region that was like literally covered in snow.
487.96s:  We were just down somewhere where it was like 65 degrees and you go up this super steep
492.28s:  incline and then at the top, you're literally in a spot that's completely frozen.
498.48s:  It's all snow and it looks like Tatooine.
500.80s:  I think that's the ice world.
502.72s:  Poth?
503.72s:  Poth.
504.72s:  That's the right one.
505.72s:  Sorry.
506.72s:  My bad.
507.72s:  I don't hold that against me.
510.12s:  But yeah, I think absolutely stunning, stunning place.
515.32s:  Okay.
516.32s:  So let's talk about the markets super fast.
518.84s:  I'm going to spend very little time on this and then we will move on.
525.36s:  I just want to highlight a couple things that are sticking out to me.
527.92s:  I never know if this stuff is useful for you, but this is useful to me.
532.36s:  This is the stuff that I look at and it helps paint the picture.
535.64s:  For example, the gold trade yesterday, when we were on the live stream, I already had
541.08s:  talked about building a gold trade than somebody mentioned like, oh, gold's moving a little
544.68s:  bit more.
545.68s:  So then I popped over and looked and it was so that I ended up putting on more of a trade.
550.80s:  Somebody might see that and be like, oh, that was a rash movement, right?
557.80s:  Just kind of run through something super fast and not really having a solid game plan
564.12s:  in place, just running into something, which is the exact opposite of what that is.
568.80s:  If you think about the skill set in the art of trading, the process of transactions, meaning
574.92s:  placing trades that that element is minuscule in terms of the overall skill set of trading,
584.12s:  which is analyzing broad swaths of imperfect moving data and building and understanding
592.84s:  of different things to do.
595.48s:  And the way that I was able to make that gold trade last night in a flash is as soon as
599.88s:  somebody told me it was moving and after looking at it, we can go back to the stream.
603.68s:  I don't remember how long it took me to look at it, but it was definitely less than 30
607.16s:  seconds that it decided I wanted to put a trade on it.
610.04s:  So that 30 second decision is preempted by all this other background research that makes
617.20s:  it a 30 second decision because what happens to a lot of other people that don't do that,
622.28s:  it turns into a 10 minute decision or a fucking three day decision where we can't make a
627.48s:  choice or makes no decision if we're completely locked up.
632.36s:  So getting trained to look at the information that's important to then use that to feed
639.00s:  trade decisions and then to be able to make a reasonably good decision in a timely manner
644.44s:  is important.
645.92s:  And trading is unforgiving in that timely manner aspect because sometimes people can falsely
652.40s:  feel like they're rushed and that's dangerous.
655.12s:  You don't want to feel rushed.
656.48s:  Rush is bad, but you also don't want to wait too long because if you wait too long,
663.12s:  then you get stuck in analysis paralysis and you don't really get too far.
668.64s:  That's really what ends up happening here.
671.04s:  So let's take a look at Broad Market overview.
676.24s:  We still have spy hanging near all time highs.
679.20s:  We have a really big by date today and it's hanging inside the prior days range.
685.04s:  So I keep an eye on that in terms of overall volatility is contracting.
689.12s:  Movement is slowing down a little bit.
691.12s:  Massively the case in queues and then I WM is hovering near highs.
697.36s:  I still have a small Russell position on now that looks okay, but I paired down a good
703.20s:  bit of it yesterday and the day before just because it did look like we're starting to stall.
709.28s:  So percentage of stocks in the S&P 500 above the 50 day moving average is 75, 76%.
718.24s:  So this is hanging in there.
719.76s:  So this movement is broadly supported.
721.76s:  Again, even before I go over to the view that I have that looks at all the indices,
726.72s:  I will already know that based on what I see here.
729.52s:  It's generally being more broadly supported.
732.96s:  Chop, chop, this says only put first and third because we've put second.
736.16s:  That's the point, man.
737.60s:  That's exactly how that shit starts.
739.36s:  So somebody decided to put first at one point at one time and then everybody else just started
744.08s:  playing the game. So now you know why people try to write first because somebody started it and
750.32s:  you fell right in line with them in playing the game.
758.08s:  So let's go to
760.96s:  sectors. Let's see.
764.96s:  Financial highs still XLI highs still XLE sideways XLC new highs again XLB highs again.
774.88s:  XLK chopping it up.
778.80s:  XLP trying to grab a bite here.
782.16s:  XLRE seems same. XLU near highs a little bit lower.
786.80s:  XLV sideways at this point on this little tail and then XLY slight drift up.
792.48s:  So this goes back to what I was just talking about.
795.20s:  Broadly supported move.
796.96s:  That's what this is.
797.68s:  This is a broadly supported market move.
800.64s:  So it's hard to tell where weakness starts to creep in and what it's going to look like.
808.32s:  We don't really have a sense of that obviously.
811.52s:  But what I do see here is general strength across most of the market and it is generally being
819.52s:  supported by pretty good earnings. So earning season so far is not really showing up a bunch of
825.76s:  bad stuff. This past week was very, very lucrative from an earnings trading perspective because
832.32s:  things are doing well but it's a more in line with expectations kind of series of earnings moves
842.48s:  as compared to some of what we saw not too long ago a couple quarters a few quarters ago now
848.16s:  where earnings were all over the fucking map. So it's actually kind of nice to see that not
854.24s:  exactly being the case anymore. So that's quick market overview.
858.64s:  Now we have T triple cues covered strangle update.
862.16s:  So let me grab the workbook here because I did make a trade today in the T triple cues log.
868.48s:  I just have to copy it over really fast from my log.
872.16s:  Give me one moment. But we did gain a little bit more exposure today.
882.08s:  Here. Move that down like that.
885.36s:  Here you go.
890.08s:  So this is what's currently on in TQs. I am up to 200 shares at a basis of 7326.
900.88s:  So total cost there is about 14 and a half grand. And this
906.80s:  is
911.12s:  yeah, this looks okay. I'm just checking the formulas as they're getting copied over.
919.76s:  Yep, that's good too. So 200 shares short one put at the moment and then short one call
927.60s:  at the moment. So this is this is how this strategy is really designed to go. It's really not
934.72s:  super busy not doing a lot with it. I added a little bit today just because I want to get
941.68s:  slightly more exposure into TQs with where the market is.
948.24s:  But I don't want to be overexposed because this still is quite tenuous in my opinion.
954.80s:  Just because tech has been bouncing all over the place. So if we come back here to the
959.36s:  2 buy and we take a look at QQQ versus TQs.
968.80s:  Right now Qs looks pretty healthy. All moving averages are ascending. Let me change the study
975.76s:  set on this really fast. This is too small. That's good. So right now we have Qs not quite
990.08s:  at all time highs again. It's not too far off though. And I'm seeing a couple things that
1001.36s:  make me slightly concerned but not overly where we're seeing these really big red days that are
1007.28s:  being supported by the 10 day moving average on a short term time frame. So this just looks like
1012.64s:  a ugly ascent. Like that's what I feel here. Now this looks like it's starting to set up for a
1019.04s:  little bit of a sideways trend could be for a little bit. Obviously we will have to see how it
1024.64s:  plays out. But that's the general gist of where Qs is. So that's why I didn't want to be under
1033.44s:  invested up here in case it does start another leg up. But I don't want to be over invested in
1038.96s:  case it starts another leg down. So that's exactly why right now I'm 42% utilized. But of that
1046.24s:  42% we have a decent chunk of that that's wrapped up in these short puts that would be managed
1056.00s:  because with something like this depending on what the market looks like that will all determine
1061.84s:  how aggressively I'm going to be worrying about trying to roll these puts and the calls if I'm
1067.04s:  getting challenged to the upside. So there's just not a whole lot going on here yet. The trades
1071.12s:  work and find it's 3.72% return on invested capital. I've been in the trade for three days.
1076.24s:  So I'm sure this will look like an absolute mess in the not so distant future.
1082.96s:  The beginning part of this trade is always the easiest because T triple Qs will it will like it
1089.68s:  literally will without a doubt look really ugly at some point in the not so distant future because
1095.68s:  it always does. And that's because if you're not prepared to experience three times volatility
1101.12s:  in something like this three times volatility is not the right choice. But if you are and you're
1108.32s:  ready then it's really not that big a deal. It'll be completely navigable. So that's the TQ
1115.20s:  okay. So next up we now have our quiz. So let's grab the first question. I think I can pace this
1126.00s:  in. I can I'm just going to have to paste it in in two spots. So there's the first question. Let me
1138.80s:  give you the other two. The other two there maybe I'll just put it on here so that you guys can
1145.84s:  all see it in the same spot. That's probably smarter isn't it instead of the chat.
1151.36s:  Here's your first question. And then I'll move it in a little bit. I'll read it out as well.
1159.28s:  So the first question here is what is implied volatility in options trading now to be clear.
1164.64s:  All I did is I went into perplexity and I said give me options quiz with 10 questions. So I haven't
1171.92s:  looked at any of these yet myself. I'm literally going to be taking the quiz with you.
1175.44s:  The other thing though is the first set of questions that it gave me were way too easy. It was
1183.20s:  like terribly, terribly easy. I still got pissed off at it because I thought these were way too easy.
1188.96s:  But you know, I figured that we start off with a couple easy ones and then we will we'll go from
1196.40s:  there. Okay, so I see B across the board. I'd rather be skiing goes off off track and goes with
1210.56s:  an end. Okay, we'll log your answer is N. I'd rather be skiing. That's fine.
1217.68s:  I haven't even read the question. What is implied volatility in options trading, movement,
1222.80s:  forecast, historical stock bid and ask. Okay, yeah. Okay, great. So yeah, awesome. Not to, to be
1230.72s:  honest, nobody should feel good about themselves if you got that right because that is unbelievably
1236.72s:  easy. So let's let's go for another one here and see what this one is in a cover call strategy.
1241.84s:  What is the maximum profit potential? We have unlimited. We have premium received plus difference
1249.28s:  between strike and stock. Chromium received minus stock purchase strike price minus stock purchase
1260.40s:  price. Rich C says I'm late trying to catch up. I'll figure out what people saying B.
1270.64s:  People are saying B because we're taking a quiz homey. So they're giving the answer based on what
1275.92s:  we see. Okay, so I'm seeing Bs across the board again. Yep. That's also correct. Another stupid question.
1291.28s:  Perplexity is not impressing me so far. Nobody should feel good yet. Okay, which Greek measures
1296.80s:  an option sensitivity to changes in IV? I don't like this one either.
1311.60s:  Will this thing give me some fucking decent questions sometime? We'll see. Okay, there's it. Okay.
1319.44s:  I'm seeing Vega Vega DDD. Y'all want the D. I don't blame you. So so does my wife. There's that.
1326.40s:  Okay, great. So next we can move on because that's another stupid question. Let's try this question.
1335.12s:  What is the put call parity principle? This is actually I like this one. This is a good one.
1340.56s:  It's not difficult, but it's good fundamental understanding, I think.
1346.96s:  My guess is this will have a little bit of a breakout in answers.
1367.60s:  All right, Lance.
1369.84s:  Let's start off brave answer coming in with D. I'd rather be seeing coming in with C. This is good. This is what I was expecting.
1382.00s:  This is what I was expecting.
1384.40s:  Okay, so I see DC, CDD, B or C IDK. Jotato says past. Jotato, there is no pass. There is no, there is no
1403.76s:  skip. This is like, what is it? I forgot which one it is. I took them both. The
1412.32s:  what is it? The ACT where like if you answer wrong, you're penalized. But if you don't,
1419.44s:  you're not penalized, I don't fuck her. Remember which one is which, but this one, you're penalized
1423.84s:  if you don't answer. Joey says D. Y'all says B. Jotato comes in with D.
1431.52s:  Okay, I love the answers. Let's go through them one by one because there is a complete breakdown.
1438.88s:  Everybody knows it's not A. So let's talk about this one really quick. Why is it not A? Because
1447.28s:  nobody picked A. So it tells me obviously everybody goes past A.
1451.12s:  What is A? It's just not true. Yep, that's fair. But explain it to me. So saying it's just not true
1464.16s:  is fair, but give me proof that it is not true. A is false. Agree. There have an inverse relationship
1474.64s:  not necessarily in terms of the price of the option that's not exactly correct.
1482.80s:  Ty says puts up a fear element that makes them more expensive intrinsically, potentially.
1487.44s:  It's not always the case, potentially. But what you guys are highlighting,
1493.92s:  the simplest way to think about this like responding to these kinds of answers when I'm exploring
1499.60s:  a little bit more is what's the simplest method to disprove the point? So the point here,
1507.28s:  the price of a call option is always equal to the price of a put option.
1512.80s:  Well, if we look at the strike price for anything, we will actually see the call and the put
1520.16s:  are typically different. So that's how this is disproven. It's not by me just saying the words
1526.00s:  it's false, but I'm giving you an example on how it's false from a logical perspective.
1532.40s:  So that's good. This one's false. Did anybody guess B?
1540.32s:  Nobody guess. Okay, Elon songs guess B. So Elon songs explain to me why you think it's B. You're
1548.32s:  the lone soldier, a lone and unaffraid here. Why do you think it's B? And then for somebody that put
1559.20s:  D or C, explains to me why you think it's not B. So Elon songs is going to explain to us why she
1571.84s:  thinks it's B. And then I want somebody else to explain why they think it is not B.
1579.52s:  The relationship between prices of European put and call options with the same strike and expiration.
1587.28s:  Not a good answer. It seemed the closest to my vague understanding. Okay, so, but based on your vague
1592.80s:  understanding, Elon songs, what element of your vague understanding led you to this response?
1602.16s:  Lian says it's not B because this is Merka. This is why I thought this was Merka. I thought it was,
1608.64s:  if you guys don't know, it's a South Park reference after, uh, stands that gets into like a bunch of
1613.68s:  drunken fights at kid baseball games and the cops are like pulling them away in a car.
1618.48s:  Actually, I grab it really fast because it's, I think it's worth everybody's time. Let me just grab
1624.72s:  this, grab this clip.
1632.48s:  All right, here it comes.
1642.80s:  Before what? I'm going to allow to stand up for myself. I thought this was America.
1647.52s:  Huh? Isn't this America?
1651.04s:  So in that clip, he is drunkenly antagonizing people and that's why that that is actually
1659.28s:  absolutely hilarious. Joey says,
1667.20s:  B, because your American options wouldn't constrain the prices to be equal.
1671.04s:  The cops says the question is nothing to do with the differences between European and American
1674.32s:  settle options. It does though, sort of. Elon songs says the difference in price between European
1682.32s:  and put options. Yeah. Okay. So fun fact, this might be the answer. We'll have to see.
1691.84s:  So going to see put call principle, be or put call parity being the difference between American
1698.96s:  European options, did we have anybody answer that? Rested and I'd rather be skiing. So either
1704.80s:  Reese or I'd rather be skiing. Why do you think it is C? And then for one of the many that put D,
1714.64s:  why is it not C? Okay. I'd rather be skiing says I guess that's a fair answer. But why did you
1720.16s:  guess that one versus guessing a, b or d, which are all other viable guesses? So there was something
1729.04s:  about this one that led you to guess this one. So what was the logic behind the guess?
1736.48s:  You guys already know, you're not going to get off easy here with, oh, I just took a swag. Swags
1742.00s:  are cool, but a swag is still based on something and we need to understand the something.
1750.40s:  Jotato says see like that doesn't even seem like a principle. That's just information. Well,
1754.56s:  it's kind of like laws, right? Like if you think about gravity, you could consider gravity
1761.04s:  just information, but they're actually it's based on a principle. So I don't think that's a great
1768.56s:  a great defense of it. I'd rather be skiing says A is in true. B seemed over explained though I
1774.88s:  like it more now. D doesn't seem true either. That's a, see, that's a completely reasonable way
1780.00s:  to back into see. I don't blame you at all. I'd rather be skiing, but yeah, that's like a completely
1786.48s:  logical way to go about it. I just want you to know from the bottom of my heart, you're dead
1790.80s:  fucking wrong. So that's completely wrong. Okay, on to D. D is the principle that put options
1798.56s:  are more valuable than call options. It seems like a good guess. A lot of people say it.
1804.48s:  So why D chop says because puts you exist, whether it's American or European options. Okay.
1814.00s:  Trey J says it's B because European options are taking an expiration and the relation remains
1818.08s:  constant. American options have div risk early exercise, which breaks put call parity. Shrey J,
1826.64s:  he's just sunned everybody. So
1829.36s:  Trey J gets plus one fake internet point.
1838.32s:  Gray, okay, let me get my low, let me get my low award.
1845.76s:  Oh wrong fucking thing. My bad, Trey J, I tried to tag you my keyboards off. Give me a break here.
1851.92s:  There it is. So this is the Shrey J is 100% correct. So put call parity principle applies to
1861.68s:  the relationship. And the reason why the relationship between put and call options is so important
1869.44s:  is because it opens the door for arbitrage if put call parity is broken. So it's a really
1880.00s:  important theory from a theoretical perspective, but then also from kind of like an institutional
1887.84s:  trading perspective. The way that most retail traders understand put call parity writ large is
1894.64s:  that markets are efficient. That essentially means that there's not a slew of arbitrage
1901.12s:  opportunities due to mispricing the relationship between puts and calls. Now put call parity primarily
1910.00s:  applies to European options, but it also exists for American. There's just a different rules set
1915.20s:  that is applied that has to take into account those other factors that Shrey J outlined.
1922.40s:  Okay, so that's another stupid easy question. Let's do, I think there's one more easy question.
1930.32s:  This is a terrible question. All right, here's the next one.
1933.68s:  The next question is what is a vertical spread in options trading?
1944.88s:  Gotta hate this question.
1951.36s:  A terrible question.
1955.84s:  Buying and selling options, same type expiration, different strikes, buying selling options,
1961.20s:  different expiration, same strike, simultaneously buying call and put, same strike and expiration,
1966.16s:  buying stocks on different market sectors.
1970.72s:  Reese is trying to make my life difficult by not just putting in a multiple choice answer,
1975.52s:  but putting the fucking vert, I don't know what the word picture is.
1982.32s:  I'd rather be skiing started with N on the first choice coming in hard with an S.
1988.48s:  So that's a hell of a choice there. I'd rather be skiing, but we'll see how it works out for you
1993.44s:  and ever know it could be, it could be a trick question. It could be a trick question.
2001.52s:  I'm not sure that it is, but it could be, it could be S. There could be an S on the list that you
2006.32s:  just don't see S on, S on his chest. What's that from? That's a rap song. Put a S on his chest.
2014.32s:  I don't remember that rap song. It's a rap song though. I'm pretty sure of it. I just don't remember
2018.40s:  which one. I'd rather be skiing since I haven't had a drink yet. Honestly, maybe you need one to
2025.04s:  like steady your fucking hands. Maybe that is it. Maybe because you haven't had to drink your hands
2030.24s:  are all over the place. So I see A's, S's and C's. Okay. So somebody that answered A,
2042.32s:  explained to me why it is not C and somebody that answered C,
2049.76s:  explained why it is not A. So I want you not to prove your point. I want you to disprove the other
2060.16s:  popular answer, which right now there's only two of them, ANC. So I would like to see the
2065.20s:  inverse explanation. Now again, I'm not asking this for no reason. The reason I'm asking you to
2073.04s:  explain it this way is because there's a different level of understanding that comes from trying to
2078.08s:  prove your understanding of something versus trying to take the other understanding of something
2085.28s:  and breaking it down into its core concepts and then explaining why it's incorrect. So
2090.00s:  Joey says C is a startle, which I think that's a Pokemon in it. If I'm not mistaken, Joey,
2101.60s:  I think that that's a, I think that's a Pokemon that you have going on there. So the good old
2107.68s:  startle and again, I call it Pokemon, it's ingest. But so yeah, so startle is there simultaneously
2117.20s:  buying call put option with the same strike expiration. Let's see simultaneously buying a call
2124.80s:  and put the same strike and expiration. Exactly. So I'd rather be skiing has a good example of the
2136.64s:  argument. C isn't a vertical spread because it's a call input. So C is incorrect. Who said C
2143.92s:  Cedric, Cedric, you are 100% wrong, 100% wrong, not even close, completely wrong. And straight to
2153.52s:  jail. Just go straight to jail. That's another reference. If you guys aren't familiar with that one,
2161.28s:  I love that one.
2165.60s:  Now Cedric, do you understand the joking aside? Do you understand the the rationale though?
2172.16s:  You're holding hot. Hold on, I got a, here we go. Okay, cool. I just want to make sure you actually
2182.48s:  understood it. All right. So this is what the straight to jail thing is. Where are the
2189.36s:  aren't made in comment to take the protesters away? Where are they? This is going to behavior is
2194.08s:  never tolerating. So this is from Parks and Rec, I think, and he talks about the armed
2201.68s:  presence that exists. They put you in jail right away. No trial or nothing. Journalists, we have a
2208.80s:  special jail for journalists. You're stealing right to jail. You're playing music too loud,
2213.92s:  right to jail, right? So that was the other reference I had going for you guys there. Full of
2220.32s:  references in case you didn't know. Yeah, yeah, we'll stretch out. Joe is the best part of that.
2229.44s:  At the very end of that clip, I'm upset that I closed it. At the very very end of that clip,
2238.96s:  there's another event that comes up and he goes, believe it or not, straight to jail. After he
2244.00s:  goes through like a whole list of other shit that sends people straight to jail. Joe, thank you for
2249.68s:  mentioning that one because that is probably the funniest part of that.
2254.80s:  So yeah, let's take a quick look just to analyze this together. So what this talks about is
2265.28s:  sitamiously buying a call and put option seam strike, same expiration. So this is same expiration,
2272.40s:  same strike. If I buy a call and then buy a put and take a look at what this looks like, I got to
2279.36s:  get rid of all this other nonsense. So this is a long startle if you take Joe's
2288.16s:  options terminology. For most other people, we would call it a straddle, I think either completely
2292.88s:  appropriate. This is the the startle though. And really, it's just the inverse obviously of a straddle.
2301.04s:  So when you're doing same expiration, same strike, really if you're doing anything in that configuration,
2308.32s:  it's going to be a straddle whether it's longer short. Now you can have like ratios so you can have
2314.32s:  one side with you can have more calls than puts, something like that. But yeah, so we have the
2323.28s:  long startle here. The next thing we have, Sedrick, walk me through how I would place a vertical spread.
2334.40s:  Sedrick.
2338.48s:  Obviously, the reason why I'm asking you is just I want to make sure that you feel confident in
2342.96s:  how to how to build it. And then if you have any questions on, I want to make sure that you're good.
2348.64s:  So we're in the 15 know of expiration 28 DT. You can we can go either call or put side either of
2358.40s:  those are completely okay. You can buy or sell a vertical spread to open it whether or not you buy
2366.40s:  that would be for a debit if you sell it's for a credit. There are different configurations in
2371.76s:  terms of width that you can use. Job says debit or credit doesn't matter either or is fine. I was
2379.68s:  going to see if Sedrick is comfortable walking me through setting one up. If not, I'll give him another
2383.92s:  second then I'll walk through it. So let's. Sedrick says I don't trade options but choosing choose
2393.44s:  strikes to play. That's okay. Yeah. So Sedrick, that's totally cool. So when we're looking at
2401.28s:  a vertical spread, it's essentially a way to trade the either a long or short option. It has what
2408.96s:  I call the base leg and then it has a wing. That's how I think about them. So for example, if I wanted
2415.84s:  to buy a put, I can come in here and buy this 75 put. Now if I have a smaller account, that can be
2423.52s:  expensive and I might not want to just buy this 75 put because it takes a lot of money. So then I
2432.56s:  can do something else like cell, a corresponding option and I can create a vertical spread. So the
2443.28s:  vertical spread, if we get rid of the startle, the vertical spread will have the dominant effect
2453.28s:  of the primary leg and then the wing is just to offset risk. Now you can use really wide wings.
2462.96s:  If you're inclined just for margin requirement, we actually talked about this last night on the
2469.52s:  the free pro livestream for everybody. That's a way that you can decrease overall margin requirements
2475.28s:  for positions. So that's a vertical. On we go, chop is trying to fucking strike a chord here talking
2488.16s:  about a really wide credit spread on rut as if anybody would do that. I literally don't know
2495.52s:  anybody that would do something like that personally, not nothing that I could, I can't conceive of it.
2502.32s:  So that sounds like a crazy move to me because something that I have done in my history is a really
2509.92s:  wide iron condor in the rut. Did that seem smart at the time, but credit never, never did that.
2520.08s:  All right, next question's in here. Calculate the break even point for this iron condor. That's
2525.04s:  actually kind of funny. Calculate the break even point for this iron condor strategy. You're
2530.16s:  going to sell the 50 call for three. You're going to buy the 50 call for a dollar, 55 call for a
2538.00s:  dollar. Then you're going to sell the 40 put for two and you're going to buy the 135 put for one.
2544.64s:  This is actually really nice of them to make the numbers so easy and everything is so round.
2551.12s:  This is supposed to be an advanced question. That's literally what I have it listed as in
2555.84s:  perplexity, which perplexity is really let me down here. These are obnoxiously easy.
2564.40s:  Now, let me take a step back though. Again, joking aside, how difficult are these questions for you?
2570.80s:  Because I'm joking about it, but some of these, I definitely think put call parity was more tricky
2577.04s:  for people. And that doesn't surprise me because from a retail trading perspective, put call parity,
2582.56s:  it really doesn't matter that much. It just genuinely doesn't impact the overall approach
2589.20s:  significantly. So that doesn't surprise me whatsoever.
2594.56s:  Reece says, this one isn't easy for me, but I can see the numbers. You honestly don't have to see
2599.60s:  any of the numbers because I told them to you. I told them that you bought the 50 or you sold the 50
2605.04s:  call for three dollars and you bought the 55 call for a dollar and then you sold the 40 put for two
2612.56s:  and then you bought the 35 for one. Wheelstretch Joe comes in with a.
2621.36s:  All right.
2626.32s:  The hot take wheelstretch Joe. Wheelstretch Joe, if I could be so kind, is to
2634.40s:  encourage you to look at another answer is I think that's what I would do. Wow, we're really locked
2645.12s:  up on this one, huh? Let's do it. That's actually good to know.
2658.24s:  Let's clear this stuff out.
2663.68s:  I'd rather be skiing says B. Okay, that's good. Wheelstretch says I only did the top one and answered.
2668.80s:  Well, fucking don't do that. If it's just some random bullshit, save yourself the effort.
2675.28s:  Someone is at my house. Who's at my house? Who are you?
2682.00s:  So let's take a look.
2686.00s:  Hold on. I'm peeping this dude.
2688.96s:  I can't tell because Amazon has like those people that just show up in their cars.
2696.16s:  Yeah, it's an Amazon guy.
2700.96s:  Okay, so we have the 50 call.
2705.20s:  Let's do it in its thought to open.
2715.44s:  50 call at three.
2722.72s:  Joe says A is a good guess. A is not a good guess. He's a bad guess.
2726.80s:  So let's do it.
2728.64s:  Yes.
2734.64s:  So to open.
2738.64s:  55 call.
2742.64s:  For one dollar.
2748.64s:  So the net credit here is two dollars.
2752.64s:  So we'll take a pause on that.
2756.64s:  So far makes sense. Does the concept of the net credit makes sense.
2781.60s:  I had to close my window down.
2787.20s:  Okay.
2790.64s:  So we're all good on this side, which is perfect.
2794.80s:  We're collecting two dollars net credit on this side.
2798.40s:  Next up, we have the put side. So we.
2802.96s:  And I also my bad. I reverse these.
2804.80s:  And then here we're going to sell to open.
2818.08s:  Just as open it's five dollar wide. Fun fact, the width literally doesn't matter at all.
2823.52s:  This could be a hundred dollars wide. It doesn't really matter.
2828.32s:  So let's open the 40 put.
2835.28s:  At two dollar dollar.
2839.04s:  Walk to open.
2843.84s:  The 35 put.
2846.88s:  At one dollar dollar.
2850.56s:  So net credit here is one dollar dollar.
2852.72s:  So how do we think about this?
2862.72s:  Could it be S? It might be S. S could be it.
2869.12s:  That absolutely could be it.
2876.00s:  So let's take a peek.
2879.92s:  Oops. Let's.
2882.96s:  Close this.
2886.64s:  And let's look at something.
2889.68s:  We literally can look at anything and just do.
2895.04s:  We'll stretch us as it's a like I said.
2899.36s:  Is everybody uniform on A or do you want to see an example?
2903.52s:  Do we think it's A?
2907.84s:  Chop says looks like A to me.
2912.88s:  It's C or B.
2920.08s:  These interesting.
2926.32s:  Let's continue and see if we can gain consensus.
2937.12s:  So the next part of this.
2942.72s:  is gonna click that.
2947.22s:  I don't remember which one I'm supposed to click.
2949.12s:  This might get rid of, I'm not gonna risk it.
2956.12s:  Let's see.
2959.48s:  So we have a short strike here at 50.
2966.84s:  We have a short strike here at 40.
2972.96s:  When we're answering the question,
2976.56s:  do we apply one credit to each side,
2986.20s:  or do we combine the two credits?
2989.40s:  Because that's what you collect in total.
2993.20s:  That's the first clarifying question here.
3003.72s:  Combine, yep, it's good.
3007.72s:  So now we have a net credit, read dollars.
3015.72s:  So when we're looking at the break even,
3022.72s:  which part of this do we care about for the break even?
3033.72s:  Does the break even deal with the wings at all?
3048.72s:  How far we can go in the money on the shorts?
3050.72s:  That's exactly correct.
3051.72s:  So it pertains to the shorts.
3055.72s:  So if we have a, I still have room here.
3068.72s:  So if we have a short call at 50,
3075.72s:  and then we have a short put at 40,
3080.72s:  and we have a $3 net credit.
3085.72s:  What direction hurts us on the short call?
3096.72s:  Which way does the stock need to go for the short call up?
3100.72s:  Okay.
3101.72s:  So then this provides a buffer to the upside.
3109.72s:  Chop says no.
3111.72s:  Okay, talk to me.
3115.72s:  What do you see chop?
3120.72s:  Joey says it was S.
3124.72s:  I think you're starting to see it now.
3128.72s:  That's exactly correct. Joey has it.
3131.72s:  So this goes 53.
3135.72s:  This goes 37.
3140.72s:  So what does this tell us?
3144.72s:  What does this tell us?
3147.72s:  What does this tell us?
3150.72s:  It tells us that perplexity is fucking wrong.
3154.72s:  That's what it means.
3158.72s:  I told you, I got these from perplexity.
3162.72s:  When we're looking at,
3165.72s:  when we're looking at things that you know in depth,
3168.72s:  we don't get to the answer by just looking at these
3172.72s:  perplexities.
3173.72s:  That's what we just did.
3175.72s:  Perplexity is completely wrong.
3177.72s:  Perplexity and fun fact.
3180.72s:  Perplexity says perplexity says the answer is B.
3189.72s:  That's not right.
3191.72s:  Not right at all.
3194.72s:  So that's.
3199.72s:  Why can't I undo?
3203.72s:  Oh, because it's being used in something else.
3208.72s:  Hold on, we got to change that.
3211.72s:  That ain't going to.
3213.72s:  So undo is going to see control shift.
3217.72s:  See.
3219.72s:  And then I got to open up waycom.
3224.72s:  For this.
3229.72s:  Undo.
3236.72s:  He stroke will shift.
3242.72s:  No.
3244.72s:  I want to let me do that.
3253.72s:  Okay, hold on.
3255.72s:  Got to change this again really quick.
3257.72s:  I just don't have to have this problem.
3259.72s:  One do from now on will be control.
3265.72s:  He.
3266.72s:  I'm done. I never use.
3269.72s:  Undo keyboard keystroke control.
3278.72s:  Oh, I know what's going on.
3281.72s:  Tricky.
3284.72s:  Little ship Z that will work.
3287.72s:  Then we have to close this.
3289.72s:  Now here we can do full shifts is the.
3294.72s:  Or not.
3295.72s:  I don't know.
3299.72s:  Oh, now we can do it.
3301.72s:  Beautiful.
3304.72s:  All right, we're good now.
3306.72s:  Tricky.
3307.72s:  But we're all set up.
3309.72s:  And now we could pop this sucker back up.
3312.72s:  And we're good.
3317.72s:  I'd rather be senses don't tell me I'm AI.
3321.72s:  Chop it says tell us it's hey, it's not a it's literate.
3324.72s:  The answer is not on here.
3326.72s:  They the it's completely wrong.
3329.72s:  Like all of the answers that perplexity offer to us.
3333.72s:  They're all wrong.
3338.72s:  This ain't going to be it.
3341.72s:  Joey says Eric is going to be a great YouTuber one day.
3345.72s:  I'll fucking.
3347.72s:  I'll fucking live to see that day.
3349.72s:  I'm sure we we all know that ain't happening.
3355.72s:  That's not what I aspire to be.
3356.72s:  Thankfully.
3360.72s:  I'd rather be skin says I knew S would be right at some point.
3363.72s:  Funny enough, I think you were on the right track.
3365.72s:  I think this one was either S or N.
3368.72s:  It's completely correct.
3371.72s:  Okay, so let's move on to the next one.
3375.72s:  Oh, I like this one.
3381.72s:  We'll stretch.
3382.72s:  This how's it not a Joe are you actually.
3386.72s:  If you're curious, we'll do the math.
3393.72s:  I just can't tell if you're playing or not.
3396.72s:  You just it's just because you joke a lot, but I do want to make sure that you get it.
3402.72s:  Okay, so you guys actually think it's a got it.
3404.72s:  Yeah, yeah, let's look.
3410.72s:  Okay, so here's the reason we already have the call side, right?
3414.72s:  So we know that the call side is 47.
3417.72s:  It sounds like there's consensus on that.
3420.72s:  The reason why it's not 43 is because if you sell just get rid of this, pretend this isn't even here.
3426.72s:  That part doesn't matter except for the credit.
3428.72s:  We do care about the credit, which is still $3.
3431.72s:  The reason is because the put side hurts us.
3436.72s:  Actually, it's kind of convenient that this is here to this way.
3440.72s:  Right?
3441.72s:  So if I sell a put here at this point, and then I buy to open a put here at this point,
3449.72s:  and I'm using this time series here for us, the break even for a sold to open put.
3456.72s:  This case, it would be put vertical.
3459.72s:  The break even you get a buffer from the credit you receive.
3464.72s:  In this case, a $3 buffer.
3467.72s:  Your strike in this case is 40.
3472.72s:  Less the $3 credit.
3476.72s:  37.
3478.72s:  That's your break even point.
3481.72s:  Because you get a buffer from that total credit of $3.
3487.72s:  So that's why it's not 43.
3490.72s:  43.
3491.72s:  Say, for example, let me hide this.
3497.72s:  Move this.
3500.72s:  And get back to this.
3502.72s:  So say, for example, we have this 40 short put.
3511.72s:  35 long put.
3515.72s:  If we have 43, if the stock is at 43, that's not your break even.
3520.72s:  That's your max profit.
3522.72s:  Anything above 40.
3525.72s:  In this example is max profit.
3528.72s:  So when you're looking at calculating break evens, an easy way to think about it is which way does the trade hurt?
3536.72s:  Chop says it should be 53.
3538.72s:  No, it should not.
3543.72s:  It shouldn't be 53.
3546.72s:  I'm explaining to you why it is.
3549.72s:  What it is.
3553.72s:  I don't understand it.
3556.72s:  I'm happy to explain it to you.
3559.72s:  But it's not 53.
3561.72s:  I'm trying to explain it to you.
3563.72s:  Here, let's actually look at.
3565.72s:  We'll put it on the platform.
3567.72s:  Maybe that'll be easier.
3570.72s:  So in this case, we'll do a short put at 70.
3576.72s:  And then we'll be long the 65.
3580.72s:  We're getting a $1.15 credit.
3583.72s:  So if we sell to open the 70 put, buy to open the 65 put, we get a $1.15.
3589.72s:  Where's my break even based on your math chop?
3593.72s:  I don't know, 53.
3594.72s:  That's kind of random.
3595.72s:  But based on your original math, you're telling me my break even would be at 7115.
3601.72s:  I'm telling you your break even will be below 70.
3610.72s:  So chop, what's your take here?
3616.72s:  Where do you think the break even is going to be on this when I pull it up?
3622.72s:  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm explaining it to you.
3626.72s:  So where do you think the break even is on this put, short put vertical spread in T triple cues.
3636.72s:  Short put is at 70.
3638.72s:  The long put is at 65 and I'm getting a $1.15 credit.
3645.72s:  So walk me through where you think the break even is on this example.
3650.72s:  And the reason I'm using this example is because I'm getting rid of the call side.
3654.72s:  It doesn't matter other than what you collect for the credit.
3657.72s:  We can add that if we want, but I want to isolate the put side.
3660.72s:  Because what I think you're doing is not adjusting your break even based on the option type.
3668.72s:  That's what I'm thinking.
3670.72s:  But I'm trying to troubleshoot that now.
3681.72s:  So chop, what's my break even going to be?
3686.72s:  Again, short the 70 long the 65 all on the put side.
3691.72s:  I'm getting a $1.15 credit in this example.
3694.72s:  So what's my break even going to be?
3699.72s:  And then the cliff notes version for everybody else is if you collect a larger net credit from an iron condor.
3709.72s:  For example, you can't lose on both sides at once.
3712.72s:  Well, I mean, the market could probably find a way to do that to me, but typically you can't.
3717.72s:  Chop says 1.15 between the first strike.
3720.72s:  Between the first strike and what?
3722.72s:  Between the first strike and spot price?
3731.72s:  From the first strike.
3732.72s:  Okay.
3733.72s:  So you're saying that the break even is going to be $7.15.
3736.72s:  Yeah.
3741.72s:  Is that correct?
3753.72s:  Sedric coming off the top rope at 66 15.
3758.72s:  That's not correct.
3759.72s:  Sedric, by the way.
3760.72s:  Good guess, though.
3765.72s:  But for choppers.
3771.72s:  Oh, fuck, that's a tough name.
3774.72s:  New Jean Kangaroo.
3775.72s:  I like that name.
3776.72s:  New Jean says 68, 68 85 break even is correct.
3780.72s:  That will be the break even.
3782.72s:  But I want to see specifically if chop.
3788.72s:  This fall on a long because the way I'm reading chops prompt there.
3792.72s:  For 1.15 from the first strike, that to me would lead me to believe.
3797.72s:  1.15 below the strike.
3798.72s:  You sold OK, perfect.
3799.72s:  Yeah, yeah.
3800.72s:  OK, great.
3801.72s:  You so you have it.
3802.72s:  That's exactly correct.
3803.72s:  So in this case, your break even right here is at 68.85 if I could get there perfectly.
3810.72s:  It's right there.
3811.72s:  So it's exactly correct.
3812.72s:  That's good.
3813.72s:  So then perfect.
3815.72s:  So now let's go back to this example.
3819.72s:  this put side and do the same exact thing. So if we have, we collected a $3 credit in
3834.72s:  total, right? Because we got $2 from this one, $1 from this one. Do the same thing you
3839.82s:  just did with the $3 instead of any other number. But do the same exact thing you just
3846.24s:  did. And in this case, we sold the 40 put and we bought the 35 put. Where does that put
3854.40s:  us? What is I supposed to do? Was I not supposed to use that pun? There was no way that I couldn't.
3861.68s:  So that just kind of is what it is. Everybody will have to get over that. But I want you
3867.72s:  to do the same exact thing you just did. Chopus and then you will have your answer.
3876.24s:  And then in the meantime, I'm going to start my dinner order.
3906.24s:  We've chopped us another couple of seconds. And then if not, I'll just move along.
3915.88s:  Tedrick says, should be 53 and 37. Perfect. You got it. That's exactly, that's exactly
3924.08s:  correct, man. That is exactly correct. Nice job. So that's why it is what it is, right?
3934.04s:  And before you were looking at what did we have before? You had 53, which is good for
3944.32s:  the call side. That's correct. And then for the put side, but I'm on a phone and it's blurry
3956.32s:  zooming in. No, it's good. You absolutely crushed it. You did a good job. So you have the,
3963.76s:  like, literally, that's exactly what we were looking for. So I'm stoked here. This is good news.
3969.68s:  And if you have questions on it, let me know because now is a good time to kind of dial them
3975.68s:  in if there are any, but it looks like you have it. Cool. Next question from chat GPT. Oh, no,
3984.68s:  this is perplexity. I want to give chat GPT bad fade. This one. I'm going to merge this so
3995.16s:  that it's in one spot. It says in a butterfly spread using call options, what is the maximum
4006.48s:  profit if the stock price at expiration is exactly at the middle strike price? The difference
4015.92s:  between the high and low, the difference between the middle and low strikes price strike
4022.36s:  prices minus the net premium paid. The premium received or unlimited. The only issue I don't
4029.04s:  like with this question is that it's not, it's not clarifying if this is a long or short
4038.96s:  butterfly, which I don't like. I see B. I believe you can be whatever you want to be. It's pretty good.
4059.04s:  Never done a butterfly. Yeah, that's okay. Butterflies. I actually don't hate butterflies. I used to
4074.72s:  trade them quite a lot because butterflies have a pretty good use case, specifically in smaller
4082.32s:  accounts. But it's not, it's definitely not my go to either. And it's because butterflies have
4090.16s:  a lot of drawbacks with them. I'd rather be skiing is guessing that it is C. Yeah, okay. So
4102.72s:  wait, was it butter sold? Yeah, that's correct. It's, it's not differentiating. Technically,
4107.28s:  you can still answer the question without that. But just by inferring what it's saying, but yeah.
4117.20s:  Elon Song says, what is the use case in small accounts? It's kind of a way like you can trade,
4122.56s:  for example, like an iron butterfly. That's something I would use pretty regularly. So let's say that
4128.40s:  we're trading something like SPX, great example. Good pick, Elon Songs. And let's say that we want to
4142.00s:  sell a straddle. And right now I'm in the pass through IRA account. So if I wanted to sell a
4149.68s:  straddle in here, I need $685,000. You essentially have to cash secure the position even though it's
4156.40s:  cash settled. So you need a bunch of money in order to put this trade on, right? So what you can
4163.04s:  do is you can come out and you can buy the wings. So you can come out maybe like this 30 delta on
4168.48s:  this side, 30 delta on this side, turn this one off. And it's kind of like a really wide iron
4179.36s:  condor. But you can consider this iron butterfly. If you have two at the same strike and then you buy
4185.60s:  the wings, this calls it an iron condor. It's all the names are fluid. They're all the same shit.
4193.68s:  Land says it's a witch hat. That's really what this is. Like if we were to figure out what to
4199.12s:  actually call this thing, I think the witch's hat is the correct answer. Probably the best answer
4204.00s:  I've heard so far. Never mind iron condors or iron butterflies or iron other critters. We have
4212.48s:  the witch's hat. I think it's a better, it's more descriptive too, be honest.
4218.24s:  Yeah, way better than a stupid butterfly. Okay, so this one will kind of breeze through because it
4226.16s:  doesn't really matter that much. But I think you guys are close. What does this say?
4235.12s:  Okay. Middle on low strike price minus the net premium pay. Yeah, that's correct. Yeah, it
4244.00s:  is fine. This says be which I'm cool with. All right, let me see if there's any other decent
4251.60s:  questions in here. And then I want to poke through Reddit a little bit with you guys actually
4257.92s:  because I think it'll be fun to see what kind of randomness we can dig up. Let me get this
4264.32s:  dinner order launched off though. Cool. So,
4272.80s:  no, don't really care about that one.
4291.44s:  I don't like that one either. I think I'm going to kill the rest of those questions from
4295.44s:  perplexity. I don't really care about those. So this is, we'll kill that. Cool.
4304.72s:  All right, so quiz is officially done for now. I actually kind of like some of those quiz
4311.84s:  questions. I mean, like they're really, really basic stuff in general, but I like just the fact
4317.52s:  that it kind of generates random stuff for us to look at together, which is kind of cool.
4322.08s:  So, we have like another 20 minutes or so. We can either start hitting anything that you guys
4330.88s:  want to, but the other thing I wanted to do is, like I said, it's just poke through Reddit
4335.12s:  a little bit and see what they're talking about. Reddit is a great place. I say this all the time
4340.08s:  to use as a proxy for like the very standard options trader that is not, is not really well developed.
4350.08s:  The fact of the matter is, is there's very few people that will go around on Reddit regularly
4357.04s:  and interact that know what they're doing. And specifically, it'll be people like me that are in
4363.92s:  content creation, because if you're not into creating content for whatever reason, then there's
4370.16s:  essentially no incentive here to like go through and because you're not going to learn a lot from
4376.00s:  here. So, let's see, let's see what kind of stuff they have.
4390.64s:  Oh, let's read this one. So, this one says, so I've tried a lot of different trading strategies
4398.56s:  from butterflies, condors, debit spreads, put spreads, had some success, but not life changing to
4403.36s:  the point I can make more than I withdraw. I recently have tried a version of a poor man's
4408.16s:  covered call, but not traditional that has made money. This setup is one long call, about three
4412.88s:  months in the spy around $50, then I sell a call and roll up call options, gaining a credit.
4417.36s:  The stock rise is, I keep rolling for credit. If the stock goes down, I roll and collect a credit
4421.52s:  and profit. So, what do you guys think? If you were to respond to this, what would your response be?
4433.36s:  My thoughts as I read this is, it's just a diagonal.
4446.72s:  Patrick says it seems risky. Sort of. I mean, it's really not any risky,
4453.84s:  any more risky than holding shares. This is kind of close to what I actually try to do with
4460.96s:  diagonals. It's a little bit messed up because this is going further out of the money, which I,
4467.76s:  again, they're making the mistake. What will first answer me this? What mistake are they making here?
4473.84s:  And we'll literally, I mean, while we're doing this, we'll fucking draft a response to them,
4477.20s:  because we're already fucking, we're already in here. Might as well share it with them.
4481.92s:  So here I would say a couple, oops, a couple thoughts.
4491.20s:  You don't need to use a strike above spot for the long.
4505.52s:  If you don't want to, the benefit of doing this, the benefit of
4515.36s:  getting a further out of the money strike is it will be cheaper. However, because it's,
4525.12s:  what do you say three months? Three months or more. Out in time, it won't have significant
4534.08s:  gamma relative to a near term. Additionally, it will be all extrinsic value.
4550.64s:  Next one here is selling the call, depending on where you sell it relative to the long,
4569.84s:  is likely to sacrifice upside potential, which is the larger driver of profit in this structure.
4584.08s:  Here, the credits are just in salary, profit mechanism.
4600.40s:  My approach to trading these is called a ratio diagonal. I prefer using
4615.36s:  greater than 50 delta long options to increase dollar for dollar move.
4628.48s:  Downside is they're more expensive and decrease value.
4641.92s:  Correct.
4650.08s:  I also don't like selling one to one short calls against longs and prefer at least three to one
4662.96s:  longs to shorts to preserve upside.
4670.40s:  So what do you guys think? Does this make sense relative to what they're doing?
4674.56s:  Because the problem is, is like their game of rolling the calls and stuff, that's fine.
4678.64s:  It's not going to break anything. But they're not going to make a lot of money doing that.
4683.28s:  They're going to be spending all the time rolling these calls, collecting pennies on the dollar.
4687.68s:  And the longs, they're not really going to help that much.
4695.28s:  Reese says three months isn't even that long. Three months is plenty long.
4699.12s:  I call it a 90 day diagonal. So this case called a ratio diagonal.
4706.56s:  Yeah, because 90 days is fine with a one month hold.
4710.96s:  If I'm trading a 90 day ratio diagonal, I plan to manage the trade within six weeks more
4726.32s:  often four weeks to limit theta decay, ramping up within 60 dt.
4741.20s:  So there's a response for them.
4743.84s:  Nice job team. Next, see if we have anything else.
4748.80s:  Compounding is a way to retirement. Let's see what they have to say.
4757.20s:  I never buy long options on anything with an upward trend, especially it consists in all
4761.84s:  time highs, playing with fire when it comes to spy. I couldn't disagree more with you, Rich.
4766.48s:  I actually think that some of the best possible times you can literally buy option.
4775.28s:  The it sounds like you probably have a little bit of like option bargain buying tendencies.
4784.24s:  That's what what I pick up there. And it's super common. People have that that natural
4790.56s:  disposition all the time. Also, give me one second. I got to pop up in a window now.
4795.76s:  It's now it's too warm.
4796.96s:  All right.
4820.32s:  All right. I have a happy medium now.
4821.68s:  I'd rather be saying the wheel option strategy. I think that's what I thought it was called.
4830.56s:  Which one?
4834.56s:  Because what we were just looking at was a diagonal. Very different than the wheel.
4839.12s:  But yeah, so like a good example of buying stuff near highs is like the trade that I did yesterday
4849.28s:  in in gold. I literally bought it when it was at all time highs.
4857.20s:  Right. I literally bought it at the very, very tippy top that it can go. And I've made good money
4863.28s:  on it so far. So the thing is people have a natural tendency to try to bargain by to look for deals,
4872.48s:  to look for things that are cheap. And when things are cheap, they're typically cheap for a reason.
4880.56s:  So I'm not saying it's always smart to buy things when they're at highs. It's completely,
4888.24s:  it's completely relative to the opportunity.
4893.20s:  Rich says, for example, what's your opinion on rumble? It's been trading relatively low and tight
4899.28s:  earnings in three weeks. It would be the first full quarter and their premium subscription
4902.80s:  has been active. Let's see.
4918.32s:  It looks awful. Would not go long.
4920.72s:  Yeah, this is 100% would not go long.
4934.48s:  To me, this looks like something that had a really great pop. And then it's had declining earnings.
4942.24s:  Which I don't love. And earnings for it are 11. No.
4955.92s:  It looks like most people are playing earnings to the upside. So I would expect.
4976.80s:  I would expect them to at least based on the positioning here, it does look like people are
4982.32s:  expecting it to run up. But we can take a look if there's actually anything that I would consider
4988.40s:  to be an informed trade in there. Let's see. Rich says declining because they didn't have
4994.16s:  subscription active. It doesn't matter. Like that's one of the things to remember as a trader is,
4999.36s:  I actually think it's super important to completely detach from that stuff. Whether, whether
5004.72s:  something is doing good or not and depending on how good or how good it's not doing really
5010.56s:  doesn't matter. What matters is what it's doing. What direction is it going? That's ultimately what
5016.80s:  matters to us as traders. The rationale, the reason behind it is good context. See, like all the
5022.40s:  trades I see in here are tiny. This is 31 K 25 K. Like these are all small uninformed trades,
5030.64s:  at least from October. So let's see September. If there's any informed trades, no. So the volume
5037.36s:  that I see in here is nothing that I would consider to be educated. I see a little bit here,
5043.68s:  but this is already gone. So yeah, when I see this kind of skew, it's important for me to see it
5052.56s:  because it's interesting. But then when I look at the kind of size trades that are going on to
5057.20s:  kind of gauge overall conviction and informativeness of the order, that's not a lot of it. Now,
5062.32s:  I want to be clear, all of this doesn't mean from can't go up. It absolutely can't. Right? Like
5067.12s:  there's no rules. The the the way that I approach trading, anybody who knows me knows what I'm about
5073.84s:  to say. It's not about can this trade work? I can always argue to myself why a trade could work.
5084.16s:  What matters to me is, is this the right place for my money? That's what I care about. So does that
5091.20s:  mean that rum can't go up even though it doesn't look attractive to me? Of course it can. It
5096.00s:  absolutely can. But I'm not worried about any one individual trade working. That's not my focus
5104.32s:  as a trader. You pivot from being kind of an amateur to at least intermediate, more professional
5112.08s:  level when you start devaluing the outcome of individual trades and you worry so much more
5122.32s:  about the system. How does the system perform in the aggregate long term if I continue to apply
5131.04s:  a general rule set to it? So for example, I'd rather be saying says best to follow the trend. Maybe
5139.12s:  I'm not even arguing that myself at all because there are people that trade contrarian strategies
5145.36s:  really, really well. But definitely what I have found and it's based on not just what I've seen
5153.60s:  anecdotally, but based in research is things that are at highs tend to continue making highs.
5161.92s:  So for example, this scan is looking for optionable products, well, equities that have made at
5170.88s:  least a 100% move sometime within the last three months. And if I click through these, take a look.
5180.32s:  This is made a massive move. Absolutely massive move. I don't know what this is. Let me go out to the
5187.20s:  max. It's made, well, shit, it was at 644, that's nuts. But here, it's made an absolutely massive move
5196.24s:  over the last year. It's trading at 52 week highs and then some it traded at 52 week highs the day
5202.64s:  before the day before that the day before that. Then here it didn't didn't didn't did here did here.
5210.56s:  Didn't you get the point? This thing traded at 52 week highs for consecutive periods of time.
5219.12s:  Now again, does that mean that this is going to continue going up into perpetuity? No, of course
5224.88s:  not. There is a chance that this will slow down, stop reverse, just like it did here. And then
5229.84s:  depending on the quality of that reversal, it could just be a consolidation phase before
5234.48s:  resumption of a trend or it could be an episodic pivot where something is now returning back to a
5240.80s:  base value after being snapped out too far. It can be either or the point being when I'm looking
5249.20s:  for trades, I follow a process called stacking strength. So when you show me rum, if I look at trying
5258.80s:  to trade this, I would trade it from a market neutral perspective, because it has really high IV,
5265.84s:  and I see it has really strong variance for its premiums. So I would play this from a market
5271.28s:  neutral perspective by like selling a strangle or something. Now me personally, I wouldn't do it
5275.76s:  just because it's super cheap. So in order for me to gain something that would be even worth
5284.24s:  putting the trade on would be very difficult. It would just, yeah, this would be kind of ridiculous.
5293.76s:  So, but for a smaller account, this can look completely fine for like a variance risk premium style
5298.48s:  play. The issue here is that things with high volatility, they have high
5313.04s:  volatility for a reason. So that means it's likely to move. Now in this case, it still has
5320.40s:  really high risk premiums. So it looks interesting, but this is not something I'm inclined to go long.
5328.64s:  Because if I look at it across a six month time frame, it's declining. If I look at it on a three
5334.88s:  month time frame, it's declining. How's it doing on a 30 day? Slightly upward sloping now given these
5342.40s:  days. So that's good. Moving averages are all over the place. It's not even above its longer term
5347.84s:  moving averages yet. It had a really nice pop that sold off. And this is a little bit too much of
5355.04s:  the consolidation. If you get something that has this kind of pop, but then it pulls back like 5% or so,
5361.28s:  that's still showing strength and acceptance of like a new value. This looks like a little bit too
5366.96s:  much of a return to prior value. So I don't love it from that perspective. So yeah, this for me
5376.88s:  would be unattractive for a long trade with respect to earnings could play it for earnings from
5383.12s:  neutral perspective. But I would have to do a little bit more homework on its prior earnings to
5388.56s:  see if I would do that. Let's take a look at earnings. Looks good there there. Looks good here,
5395.60s:  here, here. Yeah, I would trade this for earnings. This looks good across the board from earnings.
5400.72s:  It's had some type moves, but most of them have still worked out okay. So I would trade this for
5406.00s:  earnings via short premium though. That's essentially it. So yeah, overall interesting, but it's also a
5419.44s:  good example of the process of trying to stack strength and the better job we can do stacking
5426.00s:  strength, the higher the probability is that we'll have trades that ultimately move in our favor,
5431.60s:  which is interesting because if we take a look at the meme stock list,
5437.76s:  there's a lot of things in here that actually look really interesting to me from different time
5442.64s:  frames. I have to come into like three months.
5448.56s:  Rich says my biggest concern is about playing is the low volume in the option chain. Yeah,
5451.92s:  definitely. That should be a concern. But again, it depends on the size that you're trying to
5455.44s:  try to put on. If you're not trying to put on a really big position, then it really doesn't matter.
5460.16s:  They were still liquid enough. They were five cents wide on the primary expiration. So
5465.60s:  like that's completely reasonable, five cents wide. If you're looking to put on you know,
5471.36s:  $100,000 position, then yeah, that's not it. But again, if you're used to putting on positions
5476.16s:  like that, you already know a $5 stock is just not happening. You have to move on to other stuff.
5483.28s:  So ASTS,
5489.36s:  that's a big pullback. This has been running sideways for a while.
5495.12s:  BBY. I think let me take a look real quick. I don't know if I still have a position on any of these.
5504.72s:  I don't. I had a short in BBY. And then I had exited it. So this can come down. This looks
5517.84s:  interesting from a risk premium perspective. BY&D. That's kind of a slow steady uptrend.
5530.00s:  If it holds here and starts moving up higher, I'm going to hold in those lows higher lows.
5536.16s:  ProVon is looked strong. Yeah, it's had a couple of these breakout moves.
5551.12s:  So let's take a look at a couple scans to look for some breakouts.
5556.96s:  Now this is stuff that I typically do on the pro livestreams is we actually spend a lot of time
5562.64s:  looking for opportunities because a big name of the game is translating the theoretical understanding
5571.84s:  into like practical application. So this is looking for stuff that's starting to show strength over
5580.72s:  a day ago.
5585.92s:  And this is looking at optional stocks. That's good. Let's see if we can get.
5593.04s:  Because right now my portfolio is about where I need it to be. I could use like maybe three more
5602.00s:  speculative trades, something like that. But I don't really need a ton at this point.
5608.88s:  And oh yeah, I did want to talk about two prior trades though while this thing is
5613.84s:  sucking wind. Let's take a look at APP.
5618.48s:  APP, you know me. APP, we did this video on not too long ago. Do you remember?
5626.88s:  Let me see if I can find the link to the video.
5632.32s:  I think it was a livestream that we did APP.
5635.28s:  This one.
5640.08s:  From the 10th.
5642.96s:  A key.
5648.32s:  And APP came on in an hour and 20.
5652.40s:  And I want to see.
5653.76s:  Oh, that's loud.
5655.44s:  I gotta turn that down.
5657.68s:  So I think APP
5664.56s:  what time did I say it started?
5666.80s:  102.
5668.80s:  So let's take a look at you can watch this whole video here.
5674.72s:  But this trade I literally walk through everything that happened with APP.
5682.40s:  So here, let's listen to a little bit of it on. We'll go fast though. We'll do what?
5689.28s:  Like one and a half time speed. Let's go.
5692.00s:  I don't think I can copyright. I don't think I can get copyright struck for watching my own
5695.92s:  shit. I don't know how that works. We're about to find out though. I think not.
5699.04s:  Thanks. The average daily range was wide. That is how I find stuff that's moving more.
5704.16s:  Right. I'm finding things that are accelerating intraday. The second thing is it popped up
5708.16s:  because of this move here into consolidation period. While this is running, I'm actually
5712.72s:  going to grab another seltzer water. But what I'm walking you through right now is the setup
5717.36s:  that I saw at the point in time. So this is an on demand talking about how I found the stock
5724.56s:  originally and walking through the setup as it developed. So I will be our period.
5730.56s:  So this is going to be for me. I'm targeting the breakout. That's what I'm starting to scope
5735.12s:  here. So now from here, because essentially we ran from 60 to 90 to massive move in a relatively
5741.28s:  short term time frame, especially for something like that didn't fall quite as heavily as the S&P 500.
5747.68s:  It went from 87 to 60. So big, big, big giant move about started consolidating and you can see
5753.60s:  where I set my entrance for. I'm very interested if I can see ideally a close above this level.
5761.52s:  Any questions so far on what I saw and how I saw it? Pretty simple. There's nothing,
5768.00s:  nothing crazy about this. It's literally just looking at something that had a big move and
5771.60s:  started consolidating. A policy says some options have extremely high volatility, but low liquidity.
5775.60s:  Do you ever trade those? I avoid low liquidity. Low liquidity will kill you. It takes any like for your
5779.76s:  example. And also I don't really care if something just has high volatility. High volatility itself
5783.68s:  will not man or an orange. It doesn't draw me. It doesn't make me leave. It's just an input. But
5788.32s:  liquidity has to be there. The reason is you can essentially just the reason the primary reason is
5794.88s:  because most people think about what it's going to be like getting into a trade and they don't
5797.76s:  focus enough on what is like getting out of the trade. So there's a really good function for making
5802.16s:  sure that there's liquidity and what you're looking at. So sometimes I'll trade less liquid stuff for
5805.44s:  sure, but I'm not going to trade those at size and I'm not going to trade something I'm expecting
5808.40s:  to have to touch a lot because again, low liquidity will get up. She says, how do you know if the chart
5812.48s:  might stop moving to the right? The beautiful part is that other than death and taxes, the next thing
5817.44s:  you can add to that list is chart goes to the right. It's kind of the beautiful part because maybe
5821.52s:  you're like me and not good with directions set here at 92 94. That's here where you can see
5826.64s:  at the bottom left there with volume right out of the jump is that if I so now what I'm doing is
5830.80s:  I'm showing the actual day that I entered because this is actually kind of a really cool case study
5836.08s:  that's still going. It's not I'm not out of the trade yet. That's why I wanted to bring it up.
5840.16s:  And I think it's fun to be able to show you something that started. I don't remember exactly
5845.36s:  when I got into this. That's been going though for quite a while now. I take a look at the total
5851.04s:  volume that traded 2.3 million shares at two hours into the open. And then if I look at the 5 day
5854.48s:  average volume, it's 3 million shares. The 20 day averages 3.1 million shares. So what's the next
5858.24s:  thing that you can tell me about the volume that I noticed because that is another super important
5862.00s:  factor when I look at this because when I'm looking for breakouts and things that look like they're
5865.44s:  going to be breakouts. I look for stuff that is super heavy volume that shows lots of people buying.
5869.92s:  So the probability even though the day's not done yet, the probability of this ending with volume
5873.04s:  right down here where you can see in the bottom left there with volume that exceeds the averages is
5875.68s:  exceedingly high because it's already almost pacing them two hours into the day. So this ended up popping
5879.52s:  up on my alert because of two reasons. But the main reason wasn't actually volume. It was just
5883.44s:  entry day move of 5%. So I have a scan that sends me stuff that have options and are moving greater
5886.56s:  than 5%. So this was already on a watch list and essentially just looking. Now I had an alert set
5890.08s:  here at 92.94. That's where I would start scaling in if I got a close above there. So it's still too
5894.08s:  early to enter as far as I'm concerned. But now this is on my second screen, which I essentially just
5897.12s:  start watching. And I'm going to keep my eyes on it. So now if I pass forward another hour and let this
5901.44s:  finish offering, I'll walk you through the next thing that I see here.
5903.92s:  So that's the that's the entry. We don't have to obviously watch this whole thing, not the
5910.00s:  intention here. But I want to like I wanted you to see what I actually saw at the point that led
5917.20s:  to me putting the trade on because that's this is like quite literally exactly how it went down.
5924.16s:  And I walked through a little bit, not much, but I walked through a little bit of the scaling
5931.44s:  protocol. But let's take a look at where it sits today now.
5939.92s:  So what I was showing you in a pp was this day. Now all of the like all the scale is completely
5949.04s:  messed up here because of the the move that it's had, right? Let's see if it looks better on a log scale.
5955.76s:  No, it looks terrible. There it is. So it's like trying to crunch in the different studies. Oh, it
5967.68s:  looks like it's trying to crunch in those standard deviation channels. Let's fix that really quick.
5973.92s:  I don't like it flattened it out that much. Let's grab this standard deviation channel.
5980.00s:  Let's kill the two. There we go. Yeah, we can see a little bit more of the movement now.
5989.28s:  So on a standard deviation channel, you can see that this became super, super range bound broke out.
5997.04s:  And then essentially I've been riding it on this 10 day MA. Now I already took some profit on the trade.
6003.44s:  We talked about all that in that other video. But I do still have some of the position left on.
6008.64s:  And now it's at a point where I'm going to make a decision. What I'm doing is paying really close
6015.68s:  attention to how it behaves. This now looks like a consolidation before another leg. That's what I see
6023.36s:  here. And that's exactly why I haven't exited the trade in full yet. I still have a piece of this
6029.04s:  trade on. And this is literally over a six figure profit. This is a big trade. And it's because
6036.16s:  this is something that was showing strength. Again, if you look at the point that I got in at it,
6041.36s:  this is a five year weekly. But if we pop into a one year daily, when I got in, it was showing
6048.64s:  exactly what I look for, which is this is breaking out one year highs posting.
6056.16s:  Which led to me scaling in based on these different expansion and volume, so on and so forth.
6068.72s:  An example of a trade that's on. Now I want to show you another example of a trade that I'm out of now.
6077.20s:  So this was a original, a similar style setup where I this had a much wider range for its
6085.04s:  consolidation narrowed down a lot and then started to break out. I ended up getting in here.
6091.60s:  And I ended up scaling out most of the trade between these two days and then I accident on this
6097.04s:  day. So this is an example of not failed yet. But this is just a wider consolidation. And it didn't
6104.96s:  fit the broader thesis that I'm looking for. So that's what led to me exiting this one.
6110.32s:  So two different versions of essentially things that popped up from this very same scan. I don't
6116.56s:  know why this thing is struggling hardcore to pull up these. Let's see if we get anything here.
6123.68s:  I don't know what the problem is. It's done this before though.
6142.96s:  Let me try a loser consolidation period.
6148.00s:  And then if this doesn't work, I'm going to try making another scan for this.
6158.00s:  Yeah, this is like completely locked up.
6188.00s:  So I'm asking for complexity to write me a thing script. I'm going to try running a new one really quick.
6218.72s:  Using open and closed prices default is eight.
6228.32s:  Let's see. Let's see what that does.
6232.48s:  Reese says if you're looking at short at a short and the underlying has callsque,
6236.72s:  does that impact your decision? It depends entirely. Does it impact the decision short?
6244.08s:  Does it make or break the decision not so much for me?
6251.52s:  So I would need to know more context. It is a data point that I would care about. But I'm going
6257.60s:  to try this variation of the scan. See if this gets through.
6261.12s:  Yeah.
6267.12s:  Man, this thing is like really stuck. I hate when it does this.
6277.52s:  Whatever.
6293.36s:  Patrick says, how do you feel about the GME consolidation? Yeah, let's take a look at GME.
6297.36s:  We're going to, we have the live, the GME live stream tomorrow. So obviously we will dive deep
6302.96s:  into some game stop tomorrow. But looking at it today, it's very, very quiet.
6313.92s:  That's what I've been overall sensing. Like if we take a look at the average daily ranges,
6321.44s:  those have come down massively. So the average true range from a 90 day perspective is 6.97%
6333.12s:  and then on a five day time frame now is 3.5%. So this is just coming down heavily.
6341.28s:  The volume has been generally siphoned out. It did have a small pop and volume. But I mean,
6348.16s:  that's why I haven't had a game stop update video in a little bit just because they're just
6354.24s:  genuinely from a trading perspective isn't a ton going on. So yeah, to me right now, it looks very
6361.60s:  quiet. What the next catalyst is, I don't know. We did get the news about the PSA grading thing,
6369.36s:  which I think is good. But yeah, the I'd rather be skiing says it does tend to do that before
6376.56s:  a sudden pop. The tricky part is it can do it for a really long time. Right. So if we go back 10
6382.00s:  years and we look at 2014 running all the way through up until 2021, it was super quiet.
6390.48s:  And then after the move that we saw in 21, it gently moved down. These are monthly level
6396.80s:  canals, by the way. And then essentially from, you know, 20 mid late 2023 into 2024, it really
6406.16s:  didn't do much except decline, like five points or something like that. And then obviously it had
6411.84s:  its recent run. And now it looks like it's starting to consolidate again. The cool part about this
6416.56s:  consolidation, I can say is that it's at a much higher level, right? So that part tends to
6422.08s:  bode well in my opinion. But yeah, overall, overall pretty quiet. I agree. Let me see if there's
6431.20s:  another consolidation scan I can run. So this is looking at five days. Yeah, no dice man broken,
6445.92s:  broken broken. All right, gang, well that wraps me up. I'm going to tinker with this
6453.52s:  thingscript for a while. You guys are welcome to hang out. I can stay on the stream, but I just
6457.12s:  need to troubleshoot this and figure out what's going on. So that is what I'm going to do now. But
6463.92s:  for everybody else, YouTube video will be out tomorrow Saturday video release as per always.
6469.60s:  And then we have the GME live stream tomorrow night. The video for tomorrow for those wondering
6475.60s:  is going to be four proven steps to make. I think it should be like the four step process.
6482.88s:  Four step process.
6488.40s:  Rooven four step process. Make money with options. I think that's the move.
6493.92s:  So that's the video that'll be out tomorrow. This will be a recap for a lot of you.
6503.44s:  But I hope that it will be useful. It's about the outlier trading process,
6511.36s:  outlier strategy process, that kind of stuff. All right, so let me, I'm going to keep trying to
6517.68s:  tinker with this though, because this is this is stupid. This shouldn't be that terrible.
6524.16s:  Let me try this.
6536.88s:  No dice though.
6538.76s:  Let me try another scan.
6554.12s:  This is an easy one.
6558.96s:  Oh, yeah.
6562.68s:  So this just looks like it's going through something because this one essentially always
6567.20s:  works.
6568.20s:  Yeah, so they're probably working on it.
6574.16s:  That's my guess.
6576.32s:  That is my guess.
6581.16s:  Annoying, but that's my guess.
6583.80s:  We can delete that one.
6588.44s:  I'm going to try to do that.
6595.44s:  Mason 80 or that's a good one.
6598.44s:  Yeah, so it looks like I'm not scanning now.
6601.24s:  Such as life.
6602.64s:  And you just back to the smart pack.
6607.28s:  Patrick says do you think now is a good time to grab some in the money leads leaps?
6611.16s:  Hmm.
6612.16s:  For what?
6613.16s:  Are you talking about GameStop?
6616.16s:  Are you talking about something else?
6626.60s:  And I have a video for you on GameStop.
6633.96s:  Okay.
6634.96s:  Patrick, that video is for you.
6639.72s:  For me, this is not when I buy options in GameStop.
6643.80s:  The only options I have on, I don't even know if I have them on anymore.
6646.72s:  I think they might have rolled off because I had short calls against my long shares at
6654.64s:  a ratio as per always.
6657.20s:  But yeah, because the problem is is again, like when I'm when I'm trading options, I'm trying
6663.88s:  to trade things that are moving.
6666.16s:  I don't want to trade stuff that's not moving yet because it can go through pro like if you
6671.24s:  do that, right?
6672.24s:  Let's say that you got them back here on the 5th of August.
6676.12s:  Then you're just kind of sitting here holding and from the 5th of August into 18th of October,
6686.60s:  not much has happened here.
6688.64s:  So for me, I wait until there's movement.
6694.56s:  And by doing that, I will never get the best possible value.
6699.08s:  I'll never fully top ticker bottom, tick something.
6702.60s:  But I don't go through periods where I hold stuff for two and a half months and it just
6708.32s:  goes sideways because that money for me is best use other places.
6713.00s:  And that's exactly what I would do in this instance is I would start running that money
6717.56s:  into other like even if I put it in a box spread, a risk free trade, it does better than
6724.80s:  this.
6727.72s:  So yeah.
6732.80s:  So right now shares something like that is okay.
6739.60s:  Rich says I've been buying short term options at close Friday and selling Monday for a profit
6743.72s:  luckily hoping to get lucky in a ring kiddie post.
6746.96s:  That's a tough way to make money, man.
6750.04s:  That's one of the things that always pains me when I talk to the apes is like, I would
6757.36s:  never want my wealth generation to be dependent on that.
6763.96s:  Like you want to talk it's pure chance.
6767.44s:  It's pure pure chance.
6770.04s:  And there's a lot of elements about GameStop that are really interesting to me.
6775.88s:  But it always makes me sad when I see traders that are just trying to put their life savings
6782.68s:  and shit like that into GameStop hoping that something will work.
6787.12s:  Because for me, hope is literally a terrible trading strategy.
6791.64s:  Hope is terrible because it's like it's not the way that I have approached creating wealth.
6799.72s:  That's for sure.
6800.72s:  And I wouldn't be where I'm at today if I had gone off of hope personally.
6806.84s:  I think it's okay to take speculative trades and to take risks and to take things that are
6812.16s:  lower probability about high payout.
6815.16s:  But that needs to be complemented with a suite of higher opportunity trades in terms of
6823.88s:  expected return at least.
6826.72s:  So that's my two cents at least.
6830.28s:  So yeah, I think the I hope you do get lucky with it, Rich.
6834.12s:  I really do hope that it does pan out that way for you.
6838.24s:  I also have to be honest, if that was my approach, I would just buy shares so that I'm
6844.16s:  not losing money on options.
6846.32s:  Because I know that you're saying that you're doing it for a profit.
6849.16s:  I'm sure they're not all for a profit because I can find periods where Monday was less
6855.04s:  than Friday.
6856.04s:  Right?
6857.04s:  So that would tell me it wouldn't be for a profit.
6858.56s:  But sometimes it has.
6860.84s:  So yeah, I hope it works, man.
6866.64s:  I'm going to do.
6873.64s:  Dave says any thoughts on BYNDP time and phase BAMU?
6880.48s:  Yeah, say look.
6882.08s:  So BYND, we looked at not too long ago.
6887.64s:  This looks like it's trending up.
6891.76s:  And it looks like it's starting to set higher lows.
6899.12s:  We'll see how it behaves here.
6903.24s:  Volatility is very high.
6906.16s:  And it has earnings coming up.
6908.00s:  So six know.
6911.40s:  So yeah.
6913.40s:  Rich says you're looking at the day.
6917.96s:  It's generally less 30 minutes and few hours.
6921.12s:  Monday it's brief.
6922.28s:  Yeah, I can still see it though, right?
6925.48s:  Based on high lows, it's not going to escape the rest of the chart.
6930.92s:  I'm not making the assumption off of where it's at the close or something like that.
6938.20s:  So yeah.
6941.52s:  Patrick says I usually buy leaps on GME.
6944.44s:  So you, so you, my money is just sitting there for now.
6946.88s:  And that's okay.
6947.88s:  Like for people that are trying to play a longer term thesis on something like GameStop,
6951.56s:  I think that's genuinely okay.
6954.04s:  The downside to that is there's a few problems with it.
6958.16s:  At least from, I think the perspective that a lot of people try to trade GameStop in,
6962.48s:  one of them is if you do get the move that you're hoping for, you're not going to be able
6966.64s:  to get out at a good price.
6968.92s:  And that's going to be one of the largest drawbacks to those long term options with something
6973.68s:  like GameStop.
6974.68s:  If it does have one of these parabolic moves, whether it's driven from a short squeeze,
6979.24s:  Gamma Squeeze, whatever, Algos, start and go crazy, all that stuff will massively move
6984.20s:  price.
6985.36s:  So you're going to take a massive haircut on where you're getting out, which again, could
6990.04s:  be part of the overall approach, overcoming it via leverage could be okay.
6995.04s:  But that's one of the main issues I see with it.
6999.24s:  From a longer term perspective, I think it's completely okay.
7003.52s:  Like if you are really convicted in something for some reason, funny enough, I was talking
7007.68s:  with my buddy Giggles earlier today about some of his holdings.
7012.00s:  And I actually got in him a little bit because I think he is too much in some single name
7018.24s:  stuff that's not doing what it should be doing for the holding relative to the rest of
7022.24s:  the portfolio.
7024.24s:  He's not as much of a, well, he's not a trader like I am.
7027.16s:  So I'll talk with him periodically and see if we can at least see if we can align on
7034.48s:  something that I think makes sense for him.
7038.08s:  But yeah, the YND looks interesting.
7043.44s:  Hard to say though, that's the case with a lot of these like meme stocks.
7048.12s:  Like until they start really starting to show a lot of volume, late volume, tons of
7054.68s:  putts, you, tons and tons of putts, you that is absolutely one thing I see here for sure.
7065.32s:  Massive amounts of putts, you.
7073.24s:  And then I think you said, E and pH, I actually do want to look at that one.
7078.12s:  E and pH.
7079.12s:  Yeah, this looks like trash.
7085.12s:  What are all these can come off?
7094.12s:  Yeah, I had an alert on this last one to the downside.
7101.00s:  I ended up not putting the trade on just because earnings was coming up, but that would have
7103.96s:  been a nice trade.
7105.96s:  Eight points on the downside.
7110.96s:  Nine points almost.
7112.96s:  Yeah, it looks weak, man.
7115.96s:  Especially coming into earnings.
7124.96s:  Yeah, and it's fallen below.
7126.96s:  Some of these prior important levels like this right here, this volume node.
7132.96s:  I love that.
7135.96s:  I wish I could scan.
7137.96s:  Let me see.
7138.96s:  I'm going to move you guys over to the other screen really fast.
7143.96s:  Here.
7144.96s:  And then I'm going to close the platform and open it back up.
7147.96s:  I actually really would.
7149.96s:  I was planning on doing some scanning tonight because I need to look for some stuff.
7158.96s:  So right now getting ready to.
7162.96s:  It shows me installing update.
7165.96s:  Yeah, it's give me the flag that it's under maintenance whenever, whenever it does this.
7170.96s:  It's one of the downsides.
7171.96s:  Like I'm glad that they do maintenance on it, but like they also do maintenance in a lot of periods where I'm like trying to do fucking research, man, which is.
7181.96s:  Not ideal.
7187.96s:  Let's take a look at this one.
7194.96s:  Just making sure all my account info is down.
7199.96s:  Yeah, we're good.
7201.96s:  All right, let's see if we can get a scan done.
7204.96s:  That would be nice.
7208.96s:  Just try this one.
7209.96s:  Hey, there it is.
7212.96s:  South, CAC, Dad, what up? Good to see you.
7215.96s:  I don't even know what this scan is.
7217.96s:  This looks like looking for downside.
7219.96s:  But I don't even care.
7220.96s:  I was just happy to see something.
7221.96s:  Yeah, this is looking for stuff near lows.
7223.96s:  We can look for some some short delta's.
7226.96s:  I'm down with that.
7229.96s:  Oh, yeah, the other thing.
7231.96s:  Oh, no, I'll talk about this on Sunday, never mind.
7234.96s:  But that's on.
7236.96s:  And then.
7237.96s:  How's this doing?
7238.96s:  Yeah, this started fading back down.
7242.96s:  Okay, let's see.
7252.96s:  I'm going to change this to stocks.
7259.96s:  And I don't care as weakly as I just want stuff with options.
7267.96s:  22.
7271.96s:  What is this 61?
7277.96s:  Citrix says Eric, you ever saw the BBY cult?
7281.96s:  No, I don't know much about that.
7284.96s:  I'd be interested to learn.
7286.96s:  Is there a cool story?
7291.96s:  But yeah, there's nothing.
7293.96s:  There's nothing that jumps out at me there.
7301.96s:  It's insane.
7305.96s:  Really?
7306.96s:  Why?
7307.96s:  That's actually you have my interest.
7310.96s:  What?
7311.96s:  Why is it?
7312.96s:  I don't get it.
7313.96s:  Why is it insane?
7319.96s:  Oh, it's a video.
7322.96s:  I see.
7324.96s:  Yeah, we'll take a look at the video.
7327.96s:  I'm not.
7328.96s:  I don't really care that much to be honest about that kind of stuff.
7331.96s:  I thought I thought there was like details about the like the stock or something that lots of people were really into.
7342.96s:  But I don't really care about the video, the call outright, just being honest.
7349.96s:  We'll take a look at it.
7350.96s:  We'll see if it's any good.
7354.96s:  I need to add this.
7361.96s:  It's a rabbit hole.
7362.96s:  Really?
7363.96s:  Why?
7364.96s:  Is it like more of the seller boxing stuff?
7366.96s:  Now you have me fucking intrigued.
7368.96s:  Because I don't get the, I don't understand the draw to this stuff.
7372.96s:  Sometimes to be honest.
7376.96s:  Because I can see, I can see some of the.
7381.96s:  I can see some of the interest, but I don't really see the broader thesis behind it or like why.
7388.96s:  Yeah, I don't know.
7391.96s:  It just seems like such a fucking hard way to make money to me.
7394.96s:  I think that's the.
7396.96s:  I think that's the cliff notes version.
7398.96s:  Like seems very difficult to make money, which is at the end of the day what I care.
7407.96s:  It's kind of the fall of Ryan Cohen.
7410.96s:  There's a blackberry cult to they think they'll become as big as Crouch Drake.
7415.96s:  What the fuck?
7416.96s:  The meme stock trading space is so unbelievably interesting.
7423.96s:  So talk to me then.
7425.96s:  Give me some details on.
7429.96s:  What we think the like if you were to break down the size of these different communities.
7435.96s:  What is it?
7436.96s:  Like who's the biggest meme stock community?
7440.96s:  And then how far does it go from there?
7458.96s:  I think it's a lot of people that are really interested in a specific stock.
7465.96s:  They kind of only want to hear about that stock, which I mean, as you guys know, it's definitely not the way that I trade.
7480.96s:  I trade lots of things.
7481.96s:  I trade things that make sense to me.
7485.96s:  And things that I think I can make money from.
7488.96s:  But I've definitely seen that before where people really, really prefer like specific like a specific stock, which is just completely different.
7500.96s:  Very interesting.
7507.96s:  I did not realize it was like that.
7512.96s:  Let's look through these.
7514.96s:  These are what is this stuff near a lows.
7518.96s:  Supposedly, yeah, okay.
7520.96s:  Let's look for all.
7530.96s:  What the hell?
7535.96s:  Well, that's not great.
7541.96s:  I guess since it's so cheap, it might be.
7546.96s:  It is that's fascinating.
7559.96s:  Yeah, I don't really care for that one.
7564.96s:  I don't know what earnings.
7568.96s:  Yeah, no.
7572.96s:  No.
7576.96s:  Yeah, cute.
7584.96s:  This gets alert for below.
7591.96s:  It's your.
7602.96s:  No.
7608.96s:  One general note is I've been trying to avoid too many short plays right now to take advantage of this broader.
7617.96s:  This is looking through
7637.96s:  So Im trying to know which one was right.
7641.96s:  This.
7646.96s:  This.
7655.96s:  Damn it, I hit it when it doesn't.
7666.96s:  That needs to be there.
7669.96s:  And this needs to be.
7677.96s:  Yo, what the fuck?
7680.96s:  Why is this thing so terrible?
7683.96s:  There it goes.
7685.96s:  Damn.
7692.96s:  You have to like, I don't understand this game that I have to play.
7695.96s:  I don't know why.
7698.96s:  There it is.
7699.96s:  Finally.
7700.96s:  Yeah.
7701.96s:  That's frustrating.
7707.96s:  Shreys says same have a ton of positive deltas.
7710.96s:  Yeah, I think I honestly think that's the right move right now.
7713.96s:  So do I.
7714.96s:  Like my portfolio is very.
7717.96s:  My portfolio is very long.
7719.96s:  I really don't have many short like let's take a look.
7734.96s:  Yeah, very few.
7737.96s:  I have a couple but very, very few.
7741.96s:  I think the big thing is just trying to run out this.
7745.96s:  And I think this is the right move.
7747.96s:  I think this is a very.
7748.96s:  Generally bull market while it's here.
7751.96s:  So.
7755.96s:  Wow, this looks.
7757.96s:  terrible.
7766.96s:  I like these options a lot.
7769.96s:  I can't.
7770.96s:  I mean, it's completely not tradable for me.
7774.96s:  I can't.
7777.96s:  I'm not going to let them.
7783.96s:  Let's see.
7786.96s:  In our tea.
7792.96s:  This gets a lot.
7795.96s:  Below here.
7803.96s:  Yeah, so this looks like a okay short.
7813.12s:  Especially if it starts dipping below there, it looks like it goes to four.
7818.12s:  Like four and a quarter, unlike that.
7822.92s:  Um,
7824.96s:  Patrick says, can we look at LPSN? Yeah.
7827.08s:  And then cactus MSTX. Yep.
7828.80s:  We can look at both of those.
7830.44s:  South Cactats says, why is it untradable for you?
7833.56s:  It's just too cheap.
7834.64s:  It's too small.
7835.92s:  So for me to be able to put on like a reasonable size position would just be a
7843.88s:  little too much for the options chain.
7846.20s:  Like it wouldn't really work well for me.
7849.40s:  Let's take a look at these really quick.
7851.36s:  Yes.
7854.00s:  Penny stock, not for me, MSTX.
7857.96s:  What the fuck is this?
7871.64s:  What is this?
7872.68s:  It's here.
7878.00s:  So one in three, three quarters long, that's interesting.
7883.00s:  Yeah.
7884.20s:  So it just looks like a slightly levered ETF for MSTR.
7891.60s:  I mean, it looks fine.
7894.00s:  I would just trade MSTR with options and get the leverage that way.
7899.00s:  If I was so inclined.
7904.44s:  But yeah, I mean, if somebody wanted to like buy and hold it or something,
7909.60s:  I would need to see the the prospectus of it.
7913.64s:  To see if I liked it.
7916.76s:  Because the way that they run the fund is going to be really, really important in terms of like the long term drag that it's going to face.
7924.92s:  All right, gang, my dinner's here.
7926.48s:  So I am hopping off great catching up.
7928.84s:  I'll see you guys tomorrow being outlier.
7930.72s:  Catch you later.
