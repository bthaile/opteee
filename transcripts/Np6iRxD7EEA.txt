0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  you
120.00s:  you
150.00s:  you
180.00s:  you
210.00s:  you
240.00s:  you
270.00s:  you
300.00s:  you
330.00s:  you
360.00s:  you
390.00s:  you
420.00s:  you
450.00s:  you
480.00s:  you
510.00s:  you
516.00s:  you
526.00s:  you
527.00s:  you
529.00s:  you
530.00s:  you
532.00s:  you
535.00s:  But that's super helpful because that tells me that we were building this over here,
541.00s:  which I don't, I'm not worried about going through with this one.
544.56s:  I think we got most of the details done here.
549.16s:  I think I just finished going through the formulas and I think that's all that's all that's
555.24s:  here.
556.24s:  Also, I have to be honest, there's like a really good chance my shirt is going to come
561.20s:  off just because it's hot in my office.
563.36s:  I'm trying to maintain decorum, but I literally don't have anything else in here.
568.56s:  I don't have like a tank top.
570.04s:  So this shirt might be coming off.
572.08s:  It's windows are already open.
574.00s:  So we'll see how it goes.
575.44s:  But right now I am slowly starting to heat up.
578.44s:  Okay.
580.44s:  So we've learned where I'm says outlier after dark.
583.44s:  Well, realistically, for most people that have been around the channel for a while, you
586.88s:  all know that's like the OG because I am one of, I'm still, I'm not going to be a
590.88s:  little bit more of a guy.
591.88s:  I'm still, I don't know what it is.
593.72s:  I don't like seeing $1,000 plus utility bills, which is what we get here.
599.36s:  So I don't run the air as much as I should because I just, it's like obviously we can afford
604.16s:  it, but it's just so annoying to pay $1,000 plus for utilities.
609.96s:  So it makes me angry.
611.32s:  So I'd rather just sit here without a shirt on sweating.
614.68s:  And that's how I spent actually a lot of the early videos.
619.04s:  So let's see, maybe if I talk quiet, calm down, maybe I can get body temperature to lower.
625.92s:  Maybe that'll happen.
627.72s:  Okay.
629.32s:  All the joking aside, let's get back over to this.
632.40s:  And my game plan right now actually is to start with this.
636.64s:  I think we should give it a test run.
639.60s:  So we built this specific tracker, the profit mechanism tracker.
646.24s:  And we want to see how it works.
648.68s:  So I think we should essentially test it together.
652.52s:  Now a couple notes with something like this, I, the reason why I like testing it sooner
660.48s:  rather than later is because it'll help us identify if this layout makes sense.
667.64s:  If the flow makes sense, if the format is what we want it to be, those kinds of things,
673.40s:  right?
674.40s:  So this is still in its infancy.
675.92s:  So I suggest that we test it.
678.60s:  So what I'm going to do is ask Syria a couple questions.
683.20s:  So the first, Syria pick a random stock ticker.
695.68s:  Microsoft.
697.68s:  Okay.
703.16s:  Syria pick a random weekday in the last 15 years.
711.24s:  No, don't schedule it.
712.64s:  Pick a random weekday date within the last 15 years.
721.96s:  Here you're breaking my balls.
725.72s:  Are you supposed to be like the fucking smart Siri?
728.32s:  Pick a random year out of the last 10 years.
738.32s:  2012.
746.72s:  Siri pick a random month.
751.48s:  Nothing.
754.48s:  No, I don't want you to schedule.
756.72s:  Jim, it's literally so much more difficult than I thought it would be.
761.32s:  Pick a random month.
762.96s:  Let's do October.
766.48s:  And then everybody in the chat type in everybody in the chat type in a date.
773.16s:  I'm going to go grab a tank top in the meantime.
786.48s:  All right.
813.44s:  All right.
814.44s:  I know that there's ladies in the chat, so I don't like fucking strip and top with them
821.16s:  here.
822.16s:  If it was all dudes like it normally is I wouldn't possibly, I couldn't possibly care less.
829.80s:  I see seven three, okay, in 29 got it.
835.08s:  So we'll do 29 minus seven plus three equals 25.
845.08s:  All right, so that's where we're going, the 25th.
850.48s:  So do you now question?
852.88s:  Do you know why, like that actually wasn't just playing a game with you guys for the
856.56s:  fun of it?
857.56s:  Do you know why I do that?
858.88s:  It's for a very specific reason.
863.72s:  Maybe that's familiar with statistics.
865.08s:  We'll understand what I just did and why I did it.
868.84s:  If you're not familiar with statistics, I want to teach you what I did because, well,
876.84s:  I'll explain why it's important.
878.36s:  That's why that's the because because why it's important.
881.60s:  Well, why did I pick this?
882.80s:  Why pass bias?
883.80s:  That's 100% correct, right?
886.44s:  So last night we spent a while talking about the need for a trade log and we talked about
892.36s:  human bias.
893.36s:  And we actually talked about we did a couple exercises together that even further elucidated
899.88s:  human bias.
901.44s:  So by having you guys pick random days, meaning numbers, and then by applying random
909.32s:  math to it, right, just addition subtraction, it backs me into something that I cannot
915.48s:  pick this, right?
917.48s:  It's it is generally random.
919.20s:  It's not purely random.
920.20s:  It's generally random.
922.24s:  So what I want to do now is go to 25 October 2012.
929.16s:  One of the stocks we are going to look at is going to be Microsoft.
934.16s:  So this is going to be something we are going to look at.
937.28s:  But we're also going to look at a bunch of other names.
940.32s:  We're going to pick a bunch of random things.
942.92s:  Now we already know what we're doing here.
945.84s:  We are looking for price direction up or down and we're looking for drift.
952.04s:  That's the primary profit mechanism.
954.08s:  So when we're looking at something like drift, we're going to bound this to where we think
960.24s:  something is going to go over the next month.
964.40s:  Drift can be longer than that.
966.08s:  The reason why I'm just picking a I'm picking a time frame.
970.08s:  Otherwise, you have to give the game some some bounds.
973.84s:  Otherwise, it's very difficult to actually start the process.
977.12s:  So I'm literally just picking something.
979.28s:  So here's what we're going to do.
980.92s:  We're going to look at Microsoft.
982.56s:  We're going to look at let's call it five other stocks.
986.20s:  And we're going to estimate price next month.
992.12s:  So 30 day window from 25 October is what we're going to do.
995.76s:  So let us buckle up.
999.68s:  I'm trying to think if there's a way for me to be able to look at charts at the same
1004.20s:  time as this.
1009.00s:  We don't have a great solution.
1011.60s:  Oh, I do have a great solution.
1013.88s:  We don't have to use think or swim.
1015.84s:  I'm just used to think or swim.
1017.72s:  We can use what's it called?
1019.92s:  Oh, in case you didn't know, this is actually a picture I took.
1023.00s:  This is not from Google.
1024.84s:  That's from Eric.
1026.16s:  That's Eric picture.
1028.88s:  What the fuck am I thinking of trading view?
1030.96s:  That's it.
1034.60s:  We're going to use trading view.
1037.28s:  Okay, perfect.
1039.00s:  Wait.
1040.00s:  Fuck, we can't use trading view.
1043.80s:  Never mind.
1044.80s:  We have to use think or swim.
1045.80s:  Never mind.
1046.80s:  We could use trading view.
1047.80s:  The problem with trading view is that I'm going to see a bunch of stuff getting to where
1052.72s:  I'm trying to go, which I don't want.
1055.20s:  So I'm going to use on demand here.
1059.04s:  Okay.
1062.00s:  So we said we're going to go to 25, 12.
1076.40s:  And I'm going to move us to the 19th so that we can stay on a primary expiration cycle.
1085.08s:  So we'll go to the 19th instead of the 25th.
1090.80s:  It's not really going to change anything.
1097.28s:  And the first ticker we're going to look at is Microsoft.
1100.92s:  Oh, spicy to start.
1106.24s:  All right, chat.
1108.40s:  What do you guys think?
1111.80s:  This is on a six month chart.
1113.28s:  I'm not going to go through and add everybody shit that everybody likes.
1116.92s:  You don't need it.
1117.92s:  You literally don't need any of it.
1119.44s:  You can use the moving averages.
1121.00s:  Those are pretty common.
1122.00s:  You have volume down here.
1123.72s:  You can use the volume profile if you'd like.
1126.36s:  And then those are standard deviation channels behind it.
1129.96s:  We really don't need a bunch of nibbinochi shit and stuff.
1133.80s:  Like you really don't need all that stuff.
1136.28s:  So what's the general tenor?
1139.40s:  I'll bring us out to a year chart.
1143.56s:  We'll do a year six months, three months.
1149.00s:  So here's your year chart.
1152.20s:  And then in the meantime, let me prep the poll.
1159.20s:  And again, this is going to be over the next month.
1175.28s:  Reese says what's the question?
1176.28s:  The question is we're doing an exercise.
1178.24s:  Pay attention.
1180.68s:  The exercise is to estimate if we think Microsoft is going to be higher or lower in the next
1188.92s:  month.
1189.92s:  I don't even care about a price target yet.
1191.52s:  I don't care about this at all.
1195.16s:  I'm mostly using this as an exercise to test our format.
1201.28s:  That's all.
1202.28s:  We'll go through a couple of these just because it's kind of fun.
1207.36s:  So the entry date here, as we described, let me get rid of these.
1217.00s:  The profit mechanism, I'm just going to move it here to price direction.
1221.80s:  I don't care.
1223.20s:  In this case, up or down, we're going to determine that here.
1227.12s:  So entry date is 19, oct, well.
1236.28s:  Here's Microsoft.
1240.12s:  The price of the ticker right now is 28, 58.
1248.56s:  The two signals that we had talked about is distance off of 52 week highs and three
1254.36s:  moving averages.
1256.60s:  So for determining price direction and drift, we can decide what signals we want to test.
1267.08s:  But first, my recommendation is we literally go through a handful of repetitions of not
1273.52s:  even worrying about signals, literally just up or down.
1278.72s:  And then I'll explain why the main reason is people can get too gummed up on this step
1286.40s:  of trying to figure out the perfect technical analysis details and that kind of stuff.
1292.24s:  And then they're not actually doing the important part of the exercise, which is to look
1296.04s:  at the chart, come up with an assumption, then see what happens.
1300.20s:  The reason why that's so important is because again, you subconsciously are going to be
1307.08s:  using different indicators, signals, all that kind of stuff in your mind.
1312.08s:  It's going to happen naturally.
1313.92s:  So then we can codify them in a little bit.
1316.64s:  Right now, it's literally just an up down estimation.
1320.12s:  That's all.
1324.00s:  And then we will start to build this up a little bit more over time.
1329.60s:  But that's the specific reason why I don't think it's important enough for people to
1336.20s:  get too gummed up on those details and then to not do the thing because that's what happens.
1342.00s:  These people get too stuck on details and then they're essentially they're dead in the
1347.16s:  water when it's a complete misuse of time and effort.
1352.32s:  So that is my stance here.
1354.48s:  Okay, so it looks like we have our estimations.
1358.84s:  And right now I see 62% down, 38% up.
1363.64s:  I'll end the poll there.
1366.88s:  So then the target here is down based on consensus.
1371.32s:  I would agree with that.
1372.56s:  I think target down is fine.
1374.80s:  One month.
1376.80s:  Again, don't worry about entry notes.
1383.80s:  Oops.
1393.28s:  So now we just fast forward a month.
1395.16s:  But before we do that, let's pick another series of random stocks.
1400.36s:  So I'm going to ask perplexity because Siri was kind of honestly, Siri was pretty much
1404.56s:  lacking on that hardcore.
1407.32s:  Pick five random stock pickers that were trading in 2012.
1418.64s:  Let's see.
1434.12s:  So it's picking Amazon.
1440.32s:  I'm not going to pick Amazon because it's too well known.
1442.68s:  It picked Microsoft.
1443.68s:  I'm not picking that because we already have it.
1446.44s:  There's Visa.
1447.60s:  There's Johnson and Johnson.
1448.88s:  I want to get representation from different stuff.
1451.24s:  Things that are like more edge case stuff that people aren't necessarily following in
1456.28s:  mass.
1457.28s:  Maybe I think they were trading.
1462.52s:  That's another stock with a loose relationship, not Pfizer.
1469.28s:  It's got to not be like a lot of large caps.
1471.44s:  I know too many large caps.
1474.12s:  Cat DE.
1475.12s:  Yeah.
1476.12s:  I'm going to avoid those.
1476.96s:  Let's go into.
1477.96s:  I wonder if visualized works.
1484.52s:  It doesn't.
1485.52s:  Okay.
1486.52s:  So let's come out on demand.
1488.48s:  Let's go into like the Russell.
1490.40s:  So because we already have a couple large caps.
1495.12s:  Materials.
1496.12s:  Some.
1497.12s:  I don't know what the fuck some is.
1498.12s:  Some dumb.
1499.12s:  Let's get that.
1500.12s:  So we got some.
1501.12s:  We have Visa, which is financials, energy, materials, heck.
1510.92s:  I think that's pretty good.
1515.52s:  Maybe we'll do one more.
1520.16s:  Couple more.
1521.16s:  We'll do healthcare.
1523.00s:  Let's do a healthcare.
1525.44s:  Let's do.
1530.00s:  Something most of us won't know.
1531.52s:  EVH.
1532.52s:  I don't know if you guys know.
1534.36s:  VH.
1535.36s:  I fucking know.
1536.36s:  EVH.
1537.36s:  They seem great.
1540.80s:  And then let's get one more large cap.
1547.48s:  What about APH?
1550.00s:  Now we already have tech.
1553.84s:  Staples maybe.
1554.84s:  We got to pick a random staples.
1557.56s:  I know all of these.
1558.88s:  So what of these names don't you know?
1563.36s:  KDP.
1564.36s:  TAP?
1565.36s:  That's a kind of a good one.
1568.16s:  I don't know that one.
1569.16s:  KVU.
1570.16s:  I don't know that one well either.
1572.56s:  Maybe KVU.
1573.56s:  I doubt a lot of people know KVU.
1578.00s:  Tommy says tap.
1579.00s:  Yeah, okay.
1580.00s:  I think taps good too.
1581.00s:  Again, I'm purposely trying to pick stuff that I don't have a developed relationship
1587.44s:  with and buy my estimation.
1589.88s:  If I don't have a developed relationship with it, I'm assuming the probabilities of
1594.72s:  you having a developed relationship with it are low.
1598.12s:  Just going off of most people don't spend the same amount of time I do on markets.
1603.56s:  Like CMG, I think a lot too many people know about that.
1613.44s:  Hmm.
1614.44s:  Hmm.
1615.44s:  Lauren, I like EL.
1624.60s:  I don't know no EL.
1625.60s:  We'll add that one too.
1627.60s:  Okay, that's enough.
1630.36s:  So now what we're going to do is go back into on demand.
1633.72s:  So what I'm doing now is a part of how I'm so efficient.
1640.04s:  Now if I wasn't doing this on a YouTube livestream, I would pick like 25 or 50 names.
1645.20s:  I wouldn't just pick like six or whatever we have eight, whatever we stopped at.
1650.40s:  And by doing this, I'm going to get serious repetitions on something.
1656.76s:  We need serious repetitions.
1659.56s:  So one of the things that I like to do for this is either draw a quick highlight on the
1665.20s:  day that I'm looking at.
1668.16s:  And then we can start flipping through these.
1670.12s:  I'm actually going to move the chat over here so that I can keep an eyeball on you guys.
1676.40s:  Yeah, okay, cool.
1678.20s:  And then I can just slide this around a little more easily.
1680.60s:  Okay, so next we have V.
1685.44s:  That's frustrating.
1686.44s:  So this is a split stock of some sorts.
1688.56s:  So we're not going to use that one.
1689.84s:  Some is this one also this one exists.
1695.08s:  That one's not looking promising to you.
1697.72s:  Okay, so we just crossed off V and some those are gone.
1703.60s:  Next up is do you okay.
1706.24s:  Let me just look at all.
1712.52s:  Duck.
1715.52s:  I'm going to grab the poll.
1717.68s:  Duck.
1719.68s:  Up, down.
1720.68s:  All right, please your vote.
1724.52s:  And what I'm doing is just filling in the rest of the same details that apply to all
1730.80s:  of these two votes so far,
1736.84s:  cast your votes, cast your votes.
1742.80s:  Wiggly Worm says what time frame is on the chart?
1745.24s:  This is a one year daily.
1750.52s:  Six votes, 67% up, 33% down.
1753.80s:  Last time we had eight.
1755.80s:  I would love to see eight.
1757.80s:  How many are in here? 18.
1760.16s:  I mean, six is a pretty good sample size here.
1770.48s:  Okay, there's seven.
1773.64s:  All right, 71% say up 29 down.
1777.44s:  So I am gonna,
1779.56s:  I'm gonna keep updating this over here.
1782.28s:  I'm just not gonna keep moving it back and forth
1784.92s:  just to be a little bit faster.
1787.08s:  So we have up.
1790.52s:  And stock price here is 65, 21.
1799.76s:  Okay, next we have EVH.
1804.44s:  If EVH pops up.
1807.64s:  And we ain't got no EVH.
1813.80s:  Next we got TAP.
1816.00s:  Okay, so EVH is off the list.
1820.24s:  TAP, next on the list, adding the poll now.
1825.96s:  TAP, up or down.
1831.44s:  Done, off the shelf, cast your votes.
1835.76s:  What do we think here?
1850.64s:  All right, this one's a little more split.
1852.80s:  Seven votes were at 57% down, 43% up.
1855.80s:  Now we're at 62 down 38 up.
1858.80s:  Okay, so we'll end this.
1860.80s:  We think TAP is going down.
1863.80s:  I disagree with that one personally.
1865.80s:  But we'll see.
1869.80s:  Okay, last one on the list for now is EL.
1872.80s:  And we're gonna have to do this.
1874.80s:  And we're gonna have to do this.
1877.32s:  Okay, last one on the list for now is EL.
1883.08s:  Fuck, we gotta go back, we gotta go back.
1885.96s:  I didn't get the price, 43, 98, 43, 98.
1892.36s:  And then now we go to EL.
1895.48s:  All right, new poll.
1898.60s:  EL, up, down.
1903.88s:  Okay.
1905.88s:  And EL is trading at 63 or 4.
1926.88s:  Seven votes, 86% are saying up 14 are saying down.
1933.88s:  Okay, ending this one, 86% say up, we're gonna go up.
1941.88s:  Okay, so to show you the log for profit mechanisms as it sits,
1946.88s:  this is what it looks like right now.
1948.88s:  So you can see all I'm doing, I'm not worrying about this stuff
1952.88s:  because it would change a little bit based on whatever we're looking at.
1957.88s:  Here we can see what the price direction is.
1960.88s:  We're using one month time frames.
1962.88s:  Normally I would add some notes in here,
1964.88s:  but we're not gonna go through that process, a little too time consuming.
1967.88s:  So now I'm gonna literally fast forward a month.
1973.88s:  So we'll go to November 16th.
1978.88s:  Exit date will be 16, no.
1982.88s:  12.
1991.88s:  And EL, I think that's the last one we looked at, 56, 59.
2005.88s:  I'm gonna leave this over to the side that we're gonna run through them all super quick.
2008.88s:  EL TAP.
2012.88s:  Down at 3995.
2020.88s:  And then we have duck.
2024.88s:  Down at 6057.
2031.88s:  Up.
2032.88s:  You know, lateral move going on here, huh? Microsoft.
2037.88s:  Down also down at 26.5.
2043.88s:  Puts.
2044.88s:  Type that in the wrong spot.
2051.88s:  Okay.
2058.88s:  So.
2060.88s:  I'm actually gonna go into this and we have what four names.
2064.88s:  So we can use this one and just watch them at the same time.
2068.88s:  Okay.
2071.88s:  So now.
2074.88s:  I would finish building in the math for this.
2077.88s:  So good old tit is gonna be this minus this.
2082.88s:  That will be the same for all of them.
2085.88s:  Can you know.
2086.88s:  Okay.
2087.88s:  So now.
2091.88s:  I would finish building in the math for this.
2094.88s:  So good old tit is gonna be this minus this.
2097.88s:  P and L equals this minus.
2100.88s:  Well, it depends.
2102.88s:  So this would have to be a if then formula, right?
2105.88s:  Because the way that I would set this formula for us.
2111.88s:  Would be well, there's two ways you could do it.
2114.88s:  I would either just track the change between ending and beginning, whatever it is.
2120.88s:  And then I would color code it based on a conditional rule off of this.
2126.88s:  Can do that.
2128.88s:  The other way that I would do it is I would just apply two different formulas based on if this is H or if column H is down or up.
2141.88s:  Those are the two different ways you can do it here.
2143.88s:  So the first thing before I go further is I would love for somebody to walk me through how to do the formula here.
2154.88s:  And I already gave you two ways to think about it with a filter, but I'm purposefully having you do the exercise.
2160.88s:  And you can go to chat you Pt.
2161.88s:  This isn't like a test.
2162.88s:  It's an open book test.
2163.88s:  Use your notes.
2164.88s:  Use whatever you want.
2165.88s:  But I want to teach you how to answer these questions for yourself versus me just telling you I already give you the framework on how to answer it.
2173.88s:  But I need somebody to give me the formula to put in O 12.
2178.88s:  And then we'll do it together and see if it works.
2183.88s:  And then the meantime, let me grab the chat again.
2189.88s:  Reses Yikes.
2190.88s:  Yikes is right.
2192.88s:  Sort of Yikes right like still 50 50 right.
2196.88s:  That kind of bears out doesn't it?
2199.88s:  Tommy says broad market downturn indeed.
2202.88s:  Never really know when one of those are going to come down the pike.
2212.88s:  So right now I'm waiting for somebody to give me the formula for O 12.
2232.88s:  You
2263.88s:  know guess is so far.
2272.88s:  Reses this part takes me forever.
2276.88s:  Yeah, I mean, you could use chat GPT.
2283.88s:  So let's work through it together then if folks are uncomfortable here.
2290.88s:  We're just going to use a basic condition.
2292.88s:  So we would do something like here you go equals L minus E divided by E times 100.
2299.88s:  The problem with that is again, we're trying I want the P and L to show based on if we're correct here.
2311.88s:  So in this case, we needed to ask chat GPT a more specific question again that's literally why I'm having us go through this exercise because there's a bit of prompt.
2319.88s:  Engineering here.
2321.88s:  So Liz, what what did you ask chat GPT?
2328.88s:  And I'll show you what you should ask chat GPT next.
2333.88s:  And in the meantime,
2339.88s:  what is the Google she formula for calculating a profit and loss from an entry price sell E X price sell L.
2346.88s:  So I see why it's doing that.
2348.88s:  And it's doing it as a percentage as well.
2351.88s:  And that's just because we gave we gave GPT a very wide open answer.
2357.88s:  So first let me show you how I would calculate it.
2360.88s:  And then I would show I'll show Liz how to ask the question.
2365.88s:  So here literally all we're going to do is start with an if statement.
2368.88s:  And then it's going to be conditional off of H.
2372.88s:  So we can start with if H 12.
2375.88s:  And this way we can drag it down.
2377.88s:  I like to put spaces in between things so that it's easier for me to look at it.
2381.88s:  You absolutely do not have to do that.
2383.88s:  You can pick up or down here.
2385.88s:  I'm just going to pick up.
2389.88s:  Then what we've just done is tell Google sheets or Excel, the syntax here will be very similar.
2397.88s:  The first thing we're doing is telling Google sheets.
2400.88s:  Before you do anything here in O 12, I want you to look in H 12 and see what it is.
2410.88s:  In this case, I want it to check if it is up.
2416.88s:  If it's up, I'm going to tell it to do one thing.
2420.88s:  If it's down, I'm going to tell it to do another thing.
2425.88s:  And it's automatically going to take anything that is not up and apply that second formula.
2431.88s:  That's important to know because if you added a third thing in here that said like sideways, you can do that.
2438.88s:  But then you need to do nested if statements.
2441.88s:  So if in this case, H 12 is up, do this.
2445.88s:  If H 12 is down, do this.
2448.88s:  If H 12 is sideways, do this.
2450.88s:  You would have to nest the if statements.
2453.88s:  So in this case, this is what I would call a dumb formula.
2460.88s:  Yes, Amazon at my house.
2462.88s:  This is what I call a dumb formula.
2464.88s:  And I actually don't like using dumb formulas.
2466.88s:  The reason why I don't like using dumb formulas is because they're dumb.
2470.88s:  And if I mistype something, it's going to automatically apply a different value to it.
2476.88s:  So if this is up, then we want to essentially compare where we would have gotten out with, with where we would have gotten in at.
2489.88s:  This will yield us a positive number.
2493.88s:  Now we can nest another if.
2496.88s:  So then we can say if.
2502.88s:  This equals down.
2508.88s:  Now I wanted to reverse this.
2511.88s:  I wanted to essentially give me the output if we had gotten in here.
2517.88s:  And then we get out cheaper here.
2521.88s:  So then I can close this first one.
2524.88s:  Close the second one.
2526.88s:  And then there's my math.
2529.88s:  Any questions on what we just looked at here.
2537.88s:  So literally all you have to do is think of the logic that you're telling Google Sheets to do.
2545.88s:  Right.
2546.88s:  The cool part is the way that Google Sheets is set up.
2549.88s:  Let's say you're trying to type in another command here for whatever reason.
2553.88s:  So equals.
2555.88s:  I just want to do if.
2557.88s:  If you click this, it literally gives you the syntax that it's literally telling you what to do here.
2566.88s:  So now to go back to Liz's question, if I wanted to answer what I was trying to do here and didn't know this is exactly what I would type.
2575.88s:  Let's say this.
2590.88s:  I'm typing in and that's why I'm quiet.
2605.88s:  I'm trying to type in.
2610.88s:  Tommy says using Excel need a formula to calculate profit and loss based on the cell that has up or down.
2615.88s:  This was my prompt.
2616.88s:  Yeah, you can do it exactly that way.
2618.88s:  If you want again, like a generalized response.
2621.88s:  There's a what I would consider to be something a little more accurate.
2628.88s:  Something like this.
2630.88s:  I'm giving it specific instructions.
2632.88s:  I'm saying in O 12, I want to calculate based on whether H 12 is up or down.
2638.88s:  And then if up, I wanted to do that.
2641.88s:  If down, I want it to do that.
2643.88s:  And that will probably return me a dumb formula.
2647.88s:  That's my guess.
2648.88s:  So then if it returns me a dumb formula, I would then clarify.
2654.88s:  And I would say use nested if for each possibility in H 12.
2666.88s:  So let's give it a whirl.
2668.88s:  Let's see what chat GPT.
2682.88s:  So I'm literally going to copy what I copy what I did in here and see what it says.
2698.88s:  Precisely is expected.
2700.88s:  So now.
2702.88s:  Let's check it out.
2703.88s:  If I use the second thing, I will copy and paste that directly in.
2715.88s:  So this adds an extra piece to it, meaning if it's something else.
2719.88s:  So this is close enough.
2722.88s:  Essentially, this is what we have up to here.
2725.88s:  And then what it's doing is adding another if on top of that.
2729.88s:  You can kill that second if just close the parentheses and then you're done.
2733.88s:  So that's exactly what I would do.
2738.88s:  William warm says I'm following along, but I'm using my program or brain.
2742.88s:  I mean, realistically Python script is not easier than Excel.
2746.88s:  So I that would literally blow my mind if you were more comfortable with Python script than Excel.
2753.88s:  Because Excel is literally it's.
2756.88s:  A very simple representation.
2760.88s:  Anyways, back over to this.
2763.88s:  Let's complete our math.
2765.88s:  So this will equal.
2767.88s:  We'll do our P and L.
2770.88s:  Oops.
2771.88s:  I'm messing it all up.
2775.88s:  I'm just doing essentially one value here.
2779.88s:  These would all be presents.
2782.88s:  And then if we had a profit target.
2787.88s:  We would do a few things.
2789.88s:  I would have like a percent.
2792.88s:  Two profit target just like this.
2795.88s:  And then I would have like a percent off profit target to understand how far off I was.
2800.88s:  So this would be calculated right in the beginning.
2805.88s:  So let's use this as an example.
2807.88s:  And again, this would be nested ifs.
2810.88s:  Right.
2811.88s:  Because if down it we need to do the math differently.
2813.88s:  So it shows as a positive figure.
2817.88s:  So that's what would go in here.
2820.88s:  Now the again, the part that we're trying to get at is now we have a first sample of first base level of things for us to look at.
2832.88s:  I would literally do this for an entire year, like not physically over the course of a year.
2838.88s:  But I would just go through this.
2840.88s:  And I would click it's month by month literally would take you less than 30 minutes.
2845.88s:  You already have the the Google sheet here.
2848.88s:  And for those that are in the the Patreon, I'll pull these down for you.
2852.88s:  And I'll upload them for you so that you have easy access to it.
2856.88s:  But again, like everybody has access to that's not like it's gate kept.
2860.88s:  Everybody can do exactly what I'm doing.
2863.88s:  Walk through it quite literally step by step.
2866.88s:  So here what I would do is then track.
2873.88s:  Price direction.
2876.88s:  Rift.
2880.88s:  Down.
2882.88s:  Price direction drift.
2885.88s:  Up.
2887.88s:  So that you have both of those.
2890.88s:  Now you can cut this up more ways.
2894.88s:  You can also do.
2896.88s:  Direction down direction up.
2899.88s:  You can do drift.
2901.88s:  Right.
2902.88s:  So what I'm saying is you can split these up based on all of the different kinds of profit mechanisms that you put in here.
2908.88s:  And you can write formulas that allow you to test all of them based on whatever inputs you use here.
2918.88s:  So that's essentially what I wanted to go over today.
2922.88s:  I would continue going through it.
2924.88s:  That's kind of what we can do on the next Friday session.
2927.88s:  I just didn't want to leave you all hanging because I wanted to try to get through this during the Friday session yesterday before we got rudely cut off by OBS.
2935.88s:  So I'm going to go kick it for a little bit before the GME live stream in a little bit.
2939.88s:  But like I said, wasn't going to leave you guys hanging.
2942.88s:  If you have any questions as always, let me know.
2946.88s:  I'm going to look at it together.
2948.88s:  But on the next YouTube live stream for beginners, we literally can continue this.
2954.88s:  We can do this for the individual single options, just like we started here.
2958.88s:  This is this is it, right?
2959.88s:  Like this is where all the work is done.
2961.88s:  And this is the part that I think people get unnecessarily stuck on.
2966.88s:  Don't get stuck.
2967.88s:  Just start doing shit.
2968.88s:  And it'll start to materialize as you go.
2971.88s:  So let me know if you need anything.
2973.88s:  I'll see you all later.
