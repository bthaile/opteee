0.08s: 2023 marked my 16th full year of trading
4.32s: so I want to walk you through six things
7.12s: I've learned over my
9.80s: 16year trading career thus far at least
13.24s: provided that I don't blow up soon which
15.48s: hopefully not at this
19.16s: point but what I want to share with you
21.96s: are a handful of Lessons Learned now
24.20s: some of these will be things that I
25.32s: learned early on some of these things
26.84s: will be what I learned a little bit
28.32s: later but I want to specifically focus
31.16s: on some more off-the-wall ideas meaning
34.16s: I'm not going to talk to you about the
35.72s: very basics of what it takes to be
37.96s: successful in trading like managing risk
40.56s: those are Givens so I want to share with
43.48s: you some more of the nuanced Concepts
46.12s: that I've learned over my career trading
48.32s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
49.72s: back to the outlier shout out to the
51.00s: patreon family consider signing up let's
53.44s: get straight into what we got going on
55.28s: so what's the first thing the markets
56.84s: remind me of Nature and what I mean by
59.36s: that is nature doesn't really root for
62.64s: people it doesn't really root against
64.76s: people nature is indifferent if you
67.68s: watch any nature documentary I watch
69.88s: them a lot because I'm fascinated by it
71.88s: the animal kingdom is brutal we think
74.72s: it's brutal however it's really not it's
77.68s: not mean it's harsh but it's indifferent
80.80s: that directly applies to the markets the
83.68s: markets are indifferent to you to me as
88.16s: individual retail Market participants
91.20s: the market does not care about you so
94.04s: what that means is the markets are not
95.80s: actively trying to hurt us they're not
98.08s: actively trying to help us they are
100.12s: indifferent to our existence so that
103.64s: means the markets don't care what's
105.92s: convenient for you they don't care what
107.60s: you want to happen they don't care what
109.08s: you want to trade they don't care that
111.24s: you think if the pattern day trading
113.40s: rule didn't exist that you would be a
115.76s: massively profitable Trader which you
117.76s: probably wouldn't be that sounds right
120.08s: the whole idea here is once you
122.96s: understand the world that we're
125.56s: operating in the better off you're going
127.72s: to be and what I mean by that is very
130.12s: first off the Jump is that if you have a
132.04s: small account like most of us do when we
133.56s: started out I started with less than
134.80s: $5,000 you are disadvantaged right out
137.20s: of the gate that's not because the
138.44s: market likes you or doesn't like you it
140.20s: is simply a fact of the place you are
142.80s: trying to interface with this is similar
145.40s: if you wanted to play professional
146.72s: basketball if you are short you are
149.32s: disadvantage doeses that mean that you
151.08s: can't be Mugsy BOS and somehow figure it
153.56s: out no you can it's entirely possible
156.32s: but you are disadvantaged and you have
158.04s: to figure out another way to succeed so
160.40s: when you're looking at small accounts
161.96s: some of the disadvantages we have are
164.28s: the inability to achieve good
165.96s: diversification you can't put on that
167.48s: many positions you're limited in what
169.52s: products you can trade cuz some of them
171.04s: are too expensive you're limited in what
173.28s: options structures you can use because
175.80s: if you sell a call maybe the margin
177.28s: requirement is too high there are
179.04s: limitations that that you have that you
180.96s: have to learn to work around as best as
183.52s: you can now that should not be confused
187.48s: with adapting to a circumstance so that
190.00s: you can overcome it versus what is best
193.08s: for example many small accounts start
195.36s: with vertical spreads I hate vertical
197.68s: spreads I talk bad about them all the
199.96s: time because in general I do not think
202.00s: they're a great option structure if you
203.88s: are a small account you ain't got that
205.76s: many choices maybe you adopt using
208.32s: vertical spreads to get your feet under
210.76s: you you're not trading them a dollar
212.60s: wide so that you can at least attempt to
214.40s: make some money but just because
216.76s: vertical spreads are what you can trade
218.92s: does not mean that they're what makes
220.68s: sense that's why when I did the small
223.20s: stack segment not too long ago well
225.04s: maybe two years ago so it is a minute
226.44s: ago I use things like ratio called
229.20s: diagonals they were a better alternative
231.28s: to me given the constraints of a $5,000
233.56s: account than trading something like
234.84s: vertical spreads same thing when I trade
236.64s: my favorite strategy the coverage
237.92s: strangle I love that strategy in a small
240.40s: account it is next to impossible to
242.52s: deploy that without using your entire
244.24s: account these are the concessions that
245.88s: we make this is also why you absolutely
249.00s: need to save there's no substitute for
251.08s: saving early on in your trading career
253.04s: smart ideas mean nothing this is our
255.32s: second lesson learned I have come across
258.04s: I cannot tell you how many truly
259.92s: brilliant people in this space I've
261.92s: talken to people that have phds I've
264.04s: talking to people that literally have
266.32s: sold hundreds of millions of dollars of
269.32s: business businesses that they've built
271.00s: what I've learned is that I'm pretty
272.96s:  stupid are you stupid or
275.00s: something but that part aside I've
277.24s: learned something more interesting
279.04s: trading is a balance between theoretical
282.56s: understanding of something and practical
284.56s: application so what that means is you
287.08s: can have somebody that's incredibly
289.08s: smart that's able to piece everything
291.40s: together to build this beautiful
293.12s: narrative on why everything's happening
295.28s: and these nice succinct summaries they
298.36s: might know everything that that's going
299.96s: on might not matter the world of trading
302.60s: is the world of practical application
304.64s: it's where we take a reasonable
307.52s: theoretical understanding of things we
309.68s: see how it actually works in the real
313.04s: world and then we find a way to
314.68s: interface with that one of the things I
316.48s: find is that people who are really smart
318.52s: that want to have an explanation for
320.52s: everything a lot of times they struggle
322.48s: in trading because things are not quite
324.84s: that discreet and even though you might
327.44s: think you are 100% correct and this
330.20s: thing shouldn't have done whatever it
331.68s: did it doesn't matter literally at all
335.40s: what matters is what price does that's
338.40s: what matters some people really struggle
341.16s: to accept that fact that leads into our
344.60s: next point of the process there was a
346.20s: study done that I don't remember the
348.56s: origin of I saw this back when I was in
351.04s: my undergraduate so I don't remember
353.72s: what it was take this with a grain of
355.24s: salt but what I remember reading was
358.32s: that some of the more prestigious style
360.84s: jobs doctors lawyers stuff like that
363.48s: people like that tend to trade poorly
366.64s: and I remember reading about the reasons
370.32s: why and it came down to this idea of ego
373.64s: and it came down to this idea of their
375.96s: ability to cleanly summarize things and
378.36s: then they have the utmost conviction in
380.08s: their summary that then might not be
382.64s: validated by the market removal of ego
385.28s: is a non-negotiable in trading there's a
387.68s: big difference between prediction versus
390.12s: a forecast prediction of something is
392.68s: when you have a high degree of certainty
395.00s: forecast is where you kind of have an
397.16s: idea of what might happen but you're not
399.68s: really Ultra convicted about it now in
402.08s: trading like most things in life it
404.32s: requires a balance between these two
406.32s: because if you attempt to trade off of
408.64s: something that you have no real basis
411.16s: behind it then you're not going to
413.44s: probably want to commit a bunch of
414.60s: capital to it however if you are so
417.00s: wrapped up in your thesis that you fail
420.32s: to acknowledge that it might not work
422.24s: out or when it doesn't work out that it
424.48s: has this really significant emotional
426.96s: impact on your ability to process things
429.44s: all of that is a giant detractor from
432.32s: profitable trading so what I think about
434.60s: here when I talk about even directional
437.20s: forecasts that I have I view them as
440.36s: probabilistic outcomes I might think
442.84s: something as a 60% chance of happening
444.96s: but I acknowledge that 40% chance of it
447.20s: not happening is pretty damn high and it
449.44s: might not happen if it doesn't happen
451.52s: that's okay any one trade that doesn't
453.84s: go in your favor it's not going to kill
455.68s: you when you become a traitor is when
458.52s: you stop
460.40s: overemphasizing each individual position
462.96s: you have on and you favor the process
466.20s: and the systematic application thereof
469.24s: over time that is what leads to profits
473.04s: overall we care about what the truth is
477.28s: regardless of what we think it should or
479.92s: should not be which leads to this exact
482.96s: idea of having an iterative process so
486.08s: the reason why I say iterative is
487.80s: because when I first started making my
489.80s: trading plan way back in 2008 2009 I
494.48s: really had a rudimentary group of things
497.44s: in there that probably would make me
499.96s: laugh today but it's where I started and
502.24s: that's okay so when we look at our
504.96s: application as Traders it's something
507.60s: that we have to build over time now last
510.92s: year as a prime example in 2023 I had a
514.08s: series of variance risk premium plays
516.36s: that I typically use some of the
518.12s: structures that I typically used I
520.00s: noticed in the near-term data started
522.36s: behaving differently than I thought it
524.52s: should have compared to the longer term
526.16s: run rate so then I started doing more
527.92s: testing given the current market
529.56s: conditions and it caused me to make a
531.16s: switch that I'm very thankful that I
532.84s: made because I still continue to run a
535.64s: paper version of the old iteration of
538.20s: the strategies compared to a live
541.04s: version of the updated version of the
543.00s: strategies and they performed much
545.08s: better you have to acknowledge that
546.96s: there's some degree of overfitting that
549.16s: may or may not happen here but if we
551.68s: maintain a good assessment and have
554.44s: varied outcomes moving forward you can
556.92s: minimize overfitting to a pretty
558.84s: significant degree and for those that
560.68s: are unfamiliar with this overfitting
562.56s: concept is it's essentially if you back
564.52s: test something and you cherry-pick the
567.00s: absolute best structure for that given
569.20s: point in time and then in going forward
571.88s: you're not accounting for variance off
573.96s: of that previous movement it's
576.24s: essentially trying to drive forward
578.52s: looking in the rearview mirror we don't
579.92s: want to do that but you do have to
582.24s: adjust to meet market conditions because
584.76s: they change noise I have a really
587.92s: interesting perspective on this in that
590.12s: I genuinely do not listen to anybody
592.60s: else I do not pay attention to what
594.84s: people say is going to happen in the
596.60s: markets on Twitter I do not care quite
599.80s: literally whatsoever there is a
602.40s: difference between gathering information
604.76s: which I do all the time I'm looking at
606.64s: news articles I am seeing what the
608.92s: economists think might happen 6 months
611.52s: from now however none of that is
614.32s: entering my brain as oh I have to follow
618.12s: what this person says because I believe
621.96s: them what you're doing in that case is
625.92s: overemphasizing somebody else's capacity
629.36s: to predict what the markets are going to
631.20s: do over your own ability to apply the
633.64s: skill set of trading you have to learn
636.12s: to be autonomous operate on your own
639.52s: that's exactly why I have my entire
641.64s: Community the outlier Community built as
643.84s: I do I do not want anybody to see me as
647.60s: an oracle because I'm not I'm just a
650.04s:  internet dude but what I want
652.64s: people to do is to build the skill sets
655.88s: to then move themselves forward and
659.16s: evolve as Traders and provide some
661.40s: structure to help them do that but noise
664.08s: gets you nowhere in the markets and
665.48s: there's plenty of it everybody wants to
667.52s: feel smart they want to throw their ego
670.16s: out there because they want that
671.60s: validation this is the same thing when
673.36s: you see all of these different pundits
675.32s: that have the most beautiful discreet
677.24s: synopsis of everything that's ever
679.04s: happened in the markets as compared to
681.00s: what most of us actually know is going
682.68s: on which is we don't have any
684.44s: idea happens in the markets not
687.68s: every move is going to be discreetly
690.68s: described by whatever you think happened
693.56s: maybe whatever you think happened is
695.12s: part of it there's a bunch of other
697.08s: that probably has a seat at that table
699.48s: in terms of what led to that outcome
701.24s: it's important to be aware of that last
702.92s: thing number six this is hands down the
706.92s: most important thing that I've done to
710.64s: completely revolutionize my performance
713.60s: as a Trader is adding structure and
716.40s: organization to my process early on on I
719.48s: did not have a trading plan early on I
721.60s: did not have a trading log without both
724.04s: of those documents you are essentially
726.92s: trying to fly a plane that you can't see
729.12s: out the window maybe because you're in a
730.56s: cloud with no gauges you have no idea
734.56s: what's going on you have nothing to
736.36s: reference you have nothing to create
739.20s: assumptions that you can then tighten
741.08s: over time this is where all of the work
743.84s: of trading is done right here creating
746.96s: the structure creating tracking this is
749.60s: hands down the most difficult aspect and
752.88s: as you might imagine this is where all
755.84s: of the benefit is derived from doing
758.60s: this because you also learn to kill your
761.24s: ego you say Okay I want to trade this
763.28s: coverage triangle I think 21 days works
765.52s: best in this kind of environment but
766.96s: I'll test 30 40 and 12 okay you see what
770.92s: happens you're not throwing your egoo
773.12s: out there and saying I think this is the
774.84s: best because of X Y and Z reason you are
777.24s: literally applying the scientific method
778.84s: method to test what you think works best
780.96s: and then you now have information you
783.20s: can base a decision off of without this
785.88s: you are non-negotiable Flying Blind and
788.56s: I have a bunch of videos that walk
790.64s: through this concept in depth I'll throw
793.16s: them in the notes below for you but
795.52s: please if nothing else do not sleep on
798.16s: this concept if you do not have a
800.40s: trading plan I can damn near guarantee
803.40s: you that within 3 to 5 years you are
806.56s: going to wish you did if you're still
808.96s: trading at that point in time because
810.72s: most people aren't anymore because
812.44s: they've lost their money don't do that
813.92s: don't be like most people be an outlier
815.96s: see you'all later
