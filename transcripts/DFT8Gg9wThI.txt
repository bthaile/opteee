0.00s: What's up outliers?
1.08s: Today we are going to talk about the exact process I would follow
6.08s: if I were to start learning about options again.
9.28s: Now, I already have a couple of videos about how to start
11.56s: trading options and things like that.
13.24s: I'll link to those in the notes below,
14.64s: but I want to actually zoom it up one level
17.04s: because I think if you're anything like me,
19.12s: you probably just started learning about options
21.32s: in trying things where you can
23.00s: and kind of hoping that you can piece it together.
25.12s: And I actually think this is a giant mistake
27.88s: that we all make.
29.40s: So the goal of this video is to walk you through four big
32.40s: guiding concepts that I think you should keep in mind
35.52s: as you go through this process of learning to trade options.
38.64s: And the funny part is,
39.52s: is you're going to notice a lot of it isn't even about options
42.88s: specifically, and I'll explain why.
44.60s: What's up, everyone?
46.08s: Welcome back to the outliers.
47.16s: Let's get right back into this.
48.96s: So the first of our four steps is define profit mechanism.
53.12s: And this is plural.
54.20s: You can have multiple profit mechanisms.
55.92s: Why would I start with this?
57.12s: If I'm talking about learning to trade options,
60.00s: why am I even bothering with a profit mechanism,
62.56s: why am I not diving directly into what calls are,
65.40s: what puts are and things like that?
67.04s: Well, it's because options are simply vehicles
70.96s: to express an opinion.
73.08s: There's no magic in an option.
75.40s: There's leverage, which is kind of magical.
77.20s: There's volatility, also pretty sick,
78.96s: but there's nothing that inherently makes them profitable.
82.04s: And if you're anything like me,
83.36s: when we first start trading options,
85.32s: we start learning all these intricate details about charm,
89.48s: vanna.
90.32s: We want to know about the velocity of gamma.
92.56s: We want to know about theta decay.
94.52s: We want to know about expiration cycles, earnings releases,
97.48s: all these kinds of things, which are important to know,
99.64s: we'll get to that in a little bit.
100.92s: But none of that matters if you don't actually know
104.32s: what you're trying to trade to make money.
106.76s: This is something we almost always all universally overlook.
111.24s: So what I offer is a way to break down
114.92s: this broader problem set into a simpler one.
117.84s: And whether or not you want to trade directionally
121.48s: for price up or down,
123.04s: if you want to trade volatility direction,
125.24s: if you want to trade structural volatility,
127.52s: there's lots of different profit mechanisms
129.92s: that are out there.
130.76s: And if you spend some time digging around SSRN,
133.60s: you'll find tons of them.
134.68s: And if you're in the Patreon,
136.28s: I have an entire archive of hundreds of studies
140.16s: that essentially talk about all these different kinds of things.
143.00s: But it doesn't matter if you know all of the intricate details
147.12s: about selling a strangle,
148.64s: if you sell a strangle in something that's exhibiting a breakout,
151.72s: you're wrong.
152.52s: You're going to lose money,
153.84s: no matter how well you understand those options.
156.52s: So this is the very first step to learning how to trade options
161.16s: is understanding something that makes money.
164.60s: So for example, if we grab the platform
166.92s: and we take a look at Tiva,
168.40s: just kind of picking a random one here,
170.36s: but it exhibits two things side by side.
172.96s: I can show you a price direction breakout here
176.60s: that was fueled by good earnings
178.88s: that then turned into positive drift and momentum over the next quarter.
184.00s: This is representative of a phenomenon called Pied,
188.08s: post earnings announcement drift.
190.16s: It's that is a profit mechanism.
192.32s: So whether you have a system to trade these breakouts,
195.36s: whether you have a system to trade the subsequent drift,
197.92s: whatever it is, whatever the profit mechanism is,
200.52s: doesn't matter, but you need a profit mechanism.
202.56s: So what I'm not worried about with that is,
204.72s: am I going to trade a vertical haul spread
207.48s: or am I going to trade a bold put spread?
209.40s: None of it matters.
210.48s: What matters up front is understanding how you make money.
215.68s: This is the first step unequivocally.
218.44s: So another example here of structural volatility
221.48s: is this concept of variance risk premiums.
223.60s: And if you're unfamiliar with what that is
225.64s: and what IV is, how all that works,
227.60s: I have another video.
228.44s: I will link to down below for you to check out.
230.76s: But essentially, we know that in general,
233.56s: the market over prices implied volatility
236.88s: relative to historic volatility.
238.96s: And the way to visualize that here is the yellow lines
242.84s: or implied volatility.
244.20s: The white lines are historic volatility.
246.92s: Notice how in general, the yellow lines
249.72s: are above the white lines.
251.32s: That just tells us what we already know
252.96s: and it visualizes it for you.
254.64s: That implied volatility tends to be overstated
257.72s: relative to historic volatility.
259.56s: That's another profit mechanism.
261.24s: So again, it doesn't matter in this scenario.
263.64s: If you know all of the intricate details
265.96s: about the new name option strategy,
268.28s: the flying dragon spitting lizard, it doesn't matter.
271.48s: This is ultimately what matters is how can you find
275.00s: things that make money and then how can you measure it?
278.56s: Because whether you're good at trading
281.24s: directly up or down, whether you're good at trading volatility
284.72s: is going to come down to your ability
286.92s: to identify reliably, somewhat, those circumstances.
291.72s: And to find signals that help you see them
295.04s: before it happens because obviously in this scenario,
298.00s: it's so easy to look back and say,
299.32s: yeah, post earnings announcement drift,
300.92s: crushed it on earnings and then it drifted up over time.
303.16s: Yeah, I can see that historically.
305.08s: But the name of the game is,
306.28s: if we're looking at the stock market here,
308.68s: can we make that same inference?
311.20s: So the whole idea is once we define these different
314.64s: profit mechanisms that we want to trade
316.36s: and this is not exhaustive, there's tons more.
318.40s: We then need to measure them, understand how they work
321.28s: and then we need to figure out how to find them.
323.80s: So how do we identify different signals
327.20s: that correspond to them and then create scans
329.96s: that help us find them?
331.04s: So for example, if I go into my platform,
333.68s: I built a scan here that helps me look
336.84s: over variance risk premiums.
338.56s: And then I have a tool here that then helps me sort
341.52s: by stocks that exhibit the most variance risk premiums.
345.16s: So if we take a look at BYND and we pull up in this,
348.20s: you're gonna see those yellow lines
349.92s: way ahead of the white lines.
352.00s: That's variance risk premiums.
353.48s: I can see them, I can look for them.
355.36s: So this is the next step in your process.
358.08s: Notice how I haven't even said the word options yet
361.12s: because again, it doesn't matter if you know
363.48s: everything about options, if you cannot find
366.16s: the conditions to trade them in,
368.08s: which is what most of us do.
369.84s: We jump into this next stage,
373.00s: which is now you get to learn about options.
376.00s: Now is the point where you get to start getting
378.32s: into all the details, your options 101, how they work,
382.04s: how they behave, what basic structures exist.
385.68s: This is where we learn about options.
388.00s: This is where you learn about the Greeks.
389.96s: This is where you pull up the outlier trading,
393.48s: options trading for beginner series,
395.48s: which has been going on every Friday for the past 12 Fridays
398.92s: and learn about options.
400.40s: Here, once you know what kinds of things make money
403.80s: and then how they make money and how to find them.
406.96s: This is where we get to learn about options.
409.24s: Then after we get through this stage
411.68s: of learning about options, we build strategies.
415.44s: And I have a video that goes in depth
418.00s: on how to build trading strategies.
420.60s: So if we look at this in a nutshell,
423.24s: when we're going through these two stages,
425.44s: outlining fitting structures that match the profit mechanism
429.52s: and then building strategies,
431.00s: this is where you start using tools like this,
433.56s: like the trading plan that I offer.
436.44s: Again, this is for the Patreon folks,
438.84s: but I've done videos on this.
440.08s: I'll link to them in the notes below
441.40s: that you can make your own.
442.52s: You can follow along in that video completely
444.28s: for free and do your own.
445.24s: And then if you're in the Patreon,
446.16s: you can just grab an example from here.
447.80s: But this is where we start codifying what we're trying to do.
451.08s: We start tracking creating systems
453.64s: so that we can reliably assess our ability
457.64s: to find profit mechanisms,
459.64s: fit strategies that take the best advantage of them
462.56s: in the context of our portfolio
464.44s: and then build your approach that we aim to sustain over time.
469.68s: So now you might be saying,
470.88s: well, how do I actually learn about options?
473.24s: It's a great question.
474.16s: Once you get to this step,
476.40s: I would recommend hop over to my website.
478.84s: Again, you can go into the Resources tab here
482.40s: and then literally just go to this,
484.08s: the Outlier Options Trading Beginners Guide.
487.64s: You'll see that it takes a second to load
489.40s: because it's kind of a big file,
490.60s: but it'll load within the window here if you're so inclined.
493.40s: I literally provide you a syllabus.
495.88s: I tell you the things that I think make sense
498.04s: to learn in what order, what we should try to learn
501.36s: in each of them.
502.48s: And then I give you some reading materials
505.00s: that I think make sense to read as you go along.
507.84s: And then again, what I offer down at the bottom,
510.76s: if you go to this next page is literally a syllabus
513.92s: or each and every one of those topics
516.72s: with sub topics that I think make sense.
519.00s: This is available to everybody for free.
520.48s: You can go check this out
521.68s: and you can start learning in an organized fashion.
525.12s: But before you even start this process here,
528.32s: we have to do these two.
530.52s: Otherwise, it doesn't matter how well you know options.
532.80s: If you don't know what you're trying to take advantage of
535.20s: or how to find it,
536.24s: you're still just gonna trade options into the wind.
538.40s: And that's not going to bowed well.
540.36s: So this is exactly what I would do.
542.64s: As always, if there's any questions
544.52s: anything they want to see me talk about,
546.08s: hit me up in the comments below,
547.52s: drop me a line, shoot me an email,
548.96s: hop in the discord, it's free to join,
550.56s: be an outlier, and I'll see you guys later.
