0.00s: Hey everybody, so we got Eric here as always we got a super awesome money talks setup for today. So I have David here. He's been in the markets for a hot minute at this point.
16.00s: What is it over 40 years now?
18.00s: Yeah, it's 48 years.
20.00s: So coming up on 50. That's a, that's a big end of.
23.00s: I'm not the old geezers out there.
25.00s: That's a, that's a big milestone, but.
29.00s: So we were just talking a little bit about your background and whatnot, but first, you know, I'd love to just welcome you to the channel. Thank you so much for taking some time to chat with me and in the audience.
39.00s: We really relish specifically these kind of opportunities because folks like you with your kind of experience, like I was saying, I think it's just.
47.00s: It's monumental for other people to try to pull as much of that as we can because, you know, like I said, I started trading in 2007 and I know what I know, which is a snapshot really it's.
60.00s: So I'm really looking forward to just discussing a little bit about, you know, what you've seen over your, your years and get some ideas on what you're thinking looking forward.
72.00s: So first, like I said, welcome to the channel and I would love to just start with a little bit about your background, you know, were you started in just your macro level view of things and, you know, your relationship with the markets.
86.00s: Sure, thanks Eric, thanks for having me on. Yeah, I, I'm not to not to get too caught up in the, you know, the beginnings of this, but I did start as a finance major in college back in, you know, I entered college in 69 so that was Vietnam years and as I joke, you know, hardly anybody was a business major back then people were trying to avoid the draft and most of more.
113.00s: Well, we called hearts and flowers back then, but liberal arts and things just, just taking something to stay in college, but I knew for whatever reason I knew from early on that I was interested in finance and did undergrad finance and MBA with the finance background.
133.00s: While I was working in a bank, I started right out of college in a small bank investment department. So I had I really attribute a lot of my success to that really because I was part of it basically a two man investment bank investment operation where I got to manage bank portfolio as well as trust portfolio seven and I got exposure bonds and stocks.
160.00s: You know, if you go to a bigger place, you usually have to specialize in one or the other. So there was a lot there that gave me kind of access to macro.
168.00s: And then I went to another bank, bigger bank, where I had to choose and I want to trust department because I wanted to do stocks.
176.00s: And in about four years got recruited away or applied for a job as equity pension manager for a fortune 100 company.
185.00s: And that kind of really jumped started the career where I was a sole equity manager within an in house, you know, within the corporation, they managed their pension assets in house.
198.00s: So they had somebody that two people doing private placement, they had a couple of people doing bonds and they had me doing equities and it really gave me again the ability to kind of be on my own not be part of a big team or anything.
218.00s: And as I said, I was chief cook and mild washer where I had to, you know, trade, I had to manage portfolio, I got to do the strategy and all that and I was, I think it was 30 years old when I went in there and it was, it was actually it was text drawn.
236.00s: And then the former CEO had been G William Miller who went on to be Carter's Fed chairman.
244.00s: So he was, he was chairman during the late 70s when inflation took off. He had left by the time I got there and was, you know, Fed chairman, but his legend, he was a very well thought of CEO and really was text from being conglomerate, they were kind of, you know,
265.00s: the rent house stuff was very much private place in Oregon because that's what a conglomerate doesn't buy, you know, assets. So I heard all through when I was recruited, they had very little equity.
276.00s: And then they missed the 1980 oil market so they dropped from a top portal investor down to mid court to L.
285.00s: And so they brought me in, I was counseled by all kinds of people on the streets saying it's a dead end. They don't like equities don't go in there, but I saw this chance to kind of show what I could do.
296.00s: And they, I was, you know, had the report to investment committee, which was the chairman president and a bunch of their group officers who ran the conglomerates, you know, the divisions, they were all in their late 50s, early 60s.
312.00s: And here's this 30 year old kids saying, yeah, I know a G William Miller said about the risks, but I can show you how to do this conservatively and, you know, perform.
322.00s: I look back now and wonder how they ever believed that, but I'd have to go to meetings and, you know, kind of piece by piece sell them because they had 10% of their assets and equities and most of those equities when I came in were almost private placement, you know, small.
341.00s: You know, not heavily traded stocks. And in the five years I was there, I had top percentile performance, the whole five years, I took them from 10% of their assets, equities to 50% because of the performance.
357.00s: And then, you know, I just, you know, from there, I went to the L.D. and then went to I.T. T. Hartford and ran their active equity effort was a C.I.O. of a billion dollar firm in New York.
369.00s: And then the second half of my career was as a macro strategist, which I still do today. So it's kind of a thumbnail sketch of my background anyway.
380.00s: And then, in the thumbnail, it's still far more any far more than any experience I can drum up. So I actually wrote a bunch of questions down just from that that I'd love to just tie into a couple of them.
393.00s: So the first one of the first things you mentioned was, you know, like your post college small bank experience.
401.00s: To me, it seems like there's a lot of value. It almost seems like a startup experience where, you know, you're, you're brought in and you end up doing a lot of things at once.
411.00s: While you were doing different things that, you know, like you said, you were trading looking over, you know, some of the different allocations things like that.
419.00s: What was your interest at that point when you were at the small bank and why, like what did you like working on the most?
428.00s: Yeah, well, it was all investment. You know, it was the, this was in Indiana and Indiana at the time had branching couldn't go beyond county.
438.00s: So this was before, before your time, you know, we never had nationwide banks. We had statewide banks and in some states like Indiana, it was county wise and you couldn't, you couldn't go outside your county.
451.00s: So we had several branches in the county. We were the largest bank in the county. So in a lot of ways you accumulated talent in these small banks that you wouldn't today.
461.00s: You know, today's, today's branches of the big banks, you basically have, you know, people that are following formulas, you know, if you're going to make a loan, you're going to follow formulas, whatever.
472.00s: So I felt very fortunate. This was a fairly progressive bank that had some pretty good talent that came out of bigger city banks to, you know, go out away from the cities and run, runs up themselves.
485.00s: My boss was, I think 30 at the time. So it was relatively young, but he'd come out of an Indianapolis bank and he was pretty progressive. In fact, he helped write some law in Indiana, where state, where county treasurers and town treasurers
501.00s: could do repose, repurchase agreements with the bank and earn higher returns and they could get through normal investments in bonds or whatever.
511.00s: And so he kind of created that for the state.
516.00s: And so I was learning that his kind of his side.
521.00s: And then you know, he'd have me work on portfolios, etc. The other thing I got, as I said, I was doing trust, which is, you know, customer portfolios, but also bank portfolio, which is mostly bonds, mostly government bonds.
536.00s: And I was also sitting on an asset liability committee, which was made up of my boss, the, you know, the head of the bank, the controller, the bank and maybe one other person.
550.00s: But so I was able to kind of understand things that people in bigger banks would never see until they were 10 or 15 years into the business.
561.00s: And so when I went to a large bank that was pretty interesting, because I chose to go the trust side, but I'd still talk to the bank people and they were surprised at, you know, the knowledge I had, you know, five years into the business.
576.00s: And it would just, I think sometimes being a generalist early on can be really, really educational.
585.00s: And that makes a lot of sense to be honest, actually, reminds me when I went on active duty in the Marine Corps, they do a very similar thing where a lot of jobs, a lot of your initial jobs, they can rotate you all different kinds of places.
598.00s: And it's for a very similar reason, because you get to learn how the organization works as a whole, you get some, you know, specific experience with where you are and then as you rotate out.
607.00s: Yeah, when you were mentioning that small bank experience early on, like it's just funny to me, because that to, it seems like that sends you on a very different trajectory than if you went to a big bank, you got really good at one specific thing.
620.00s: So then you talked about going to kind of getting into like pension management.
627.00s: I'm just curious what drew you in that direction as compared to, you know, whatever other moves were available, I assume they were numerous in nature, what would sent you that way.
638.00s: What it gave me the opportunity being in the bank, you're part of a team, you know, there were probably 10 portfolio managers within the bank that I was working at some.
648.00s: And this gave me the opportunity to kind of be my own little thief them, my own little show.
656.00s: And most importantly, gave me the ability to develop a track record, because you're, you know, pension funds, you're tracked performance wise.
668.00s: And I had enough confidence in myself by that, but in the best even though it was my 20 on your old, I've been in the best eight years and I was pretty comfortable as a value manager, if that's kind of how I gravitated that I could manage money conservatively and perform well and you know, was a pretty good stock picker, etc.
690.00s: It was that that, and you know, I was still in a bank that wasn't necessarily given me a fast track. So it gave me the opportunity to get to somewhere where I felt I could, you know, fast track more.
704.00s: And it really worked out in space just because I hit the ground running. It was, I think I went late 81.
716.00s: And I told them to keep their powder dry. We're in the midst of a bear market.
721.00s: And, and then August of 82, which in hindsight was the absolute bottom of the market. I said, it's time we had built, I had built up a list of stocks that I felt would be, you know, by candidate. It's one we were ready to buy.
739.00s: So in August, I went to a committee, the investment committee with my, with the other investment people. And I asked for, I don't remember how much money. But again, the, the portfolios 50 million at the time.
755.00s: And I may have asked for another 50 and they gave me 25 or we may have asked for more and they gave me half of that. But I came out of that meeting again, I was 30 years old and, you know,
767.00s: I was, I was, I came out, I can remember being upset that they cut it in half. And I said, the markets getting ready to go here. We've got to get my boss going, you don't know how successful that was. He goes, you know, you're talking to a group of guys that have been taught through the former chairman, never to go this direction.
792.00s: And he would talk to them into it. So he said, you know, we really made a major step today. So it was that kind of thing for the next several years where I'd asked for something they cut it in half. But my boss, we keep saying we're moving in the right direction. We're really, and like I said, in five years, we went from 10% of assets being equities to half of the portfolio being equities.
815.00s: From 500 million dollar pension fund to a billion dollar pension fund. So I end up going from 50 to 500 million in equities. And, and I was it. I mean, I had, I shared a secretary with the other asset and with a couple of the other asset guys doing, you know, real estate and bonds.
836.00s: And the other now it was me, you know, it was, and so it was fun. You know, you got to, you got to really do the whole shabang.
843.00s: That's pretty awesome. So, yeah, one of the things you mentioned that was curious about was like when you, when you landed there, you kind of were focused on equities. What sent you that direction is compared to something like bonds or real estate.
856.00s: It just was interesting, you know, I don't know. Just kind of, I think a lot of people see equities is more fun.
865.00s: Yeah, yeah, it's one of the reasons why I asked that question is because I think there's a like quite a few bankers that follow my channel a little bit now. And I know a lot of them have a very mixed relationship when they have any sort of interaction with bonds, especially today.
883.00s: You know, it's a very, very different world, I think, you know, compared to what bonds were doing, you know, 70s and 80s. So I, it seems like equities was a lot riskier for you, but that seemed to drive you a little bit. Is that is that probably fair.
901.00s: Equities in general tend to have higher risk attached to them. I don't know that I gave it that much thought it was really just, you know, I had learned both bonds side and equity side and kind of said, this is the side I like better. So, you know, there's, there's probably more variety of what you have to do within that. I mean, bond, bond guys have a lot on their plate too. So, you know, I'm certainly very happy. I went the direction.
930.00s: I did.
931.00s: Right. And then just another, this one's kind of a personal question for me, because it's something I probably will never experience though.
940.00s: What was your relationship and what were the interactions with the investment committee like. So you gave a little overview of just a little bit of, you know, how they were kind of used and used to and set in their ways in terms of how they normally conduct business. You were able to persuade them a little bit to take a little.
958.00s: You know, different direction. I'm just curious in general, what were those interactions like with the committee, were they agreeable while you were discussing with them, where they eager, where they kind of shut off, but then I read.
971.00s: It just seems like a very interesting dialogue to have with somebody, you know, when you're coming with a pretty big ask that is counter to their, you know, typical way of doing business.
980.00s: I should preface that by saying that the money was pulled in house back in the mid 70s, after the 74 bear market, which was worse bear market we had had since the, you know, the 20th I'm crashed.
994.00s: So, you know, 74 into 75 was pretty awful and G William Miller was chairman at the time and he pulled all the money at that time.
1005.00s: Most pension money was managed by the big New York banks, you know, Chase Manhattan, and JP Morgan and city city, city corporate, et cetera.
1015.00s: And it was all concentrated in New York. And it got into the 50 50, you know, the market in the peak in 73 was known as the nifty 50 because it was 50 pretty much 50 big stocks, IBM, general motors, et cetera, at the time.
1035.00s: And they became known as one decision stocks, which, you know, all the portfolio managers in New York to work for these banks would all go the same lunch and buy the same stocks.
1048.00s: And so it became a very narrowly focused market of 50 stocks.
1052.00s: And then when the, when the recession came when the bear market came, they crashed, I mean, they went down strong big.
1060.00s: And then the pension funds really lost a lot of their value.
1064.00s: William, William, William Miller pulled his money, text runs money out of the banks, brought it in house and said, we're not doing that again.
1074.00s: That's why that's why they were taught, you know, equities are a bad thing.
1078.00s: Right.
1079.00s: And never again, do I want to approach some of my executives that are very close to retirement and tell them that they lost half their pension assets, you know, retirement time.
1092.00s: So, so that's why they and from that point forward from the mid 70s till I came in, the idea was, will, will get returns for private placements and through bonds and things that are more stable.
1105.00s: They did very well. They were taught for tile doing that because you know, text run was kind of that way with their private, you know, their company purchases and things.
1114.00s: So they were just kind of following the culture that they were used to.
1118.00s: So I was a step out of that, you know, I was coming in and being very opposite to that culture.
1126.00s: I can remember, I mean, again, you think you're, you think you're eight years in that you got all the knowledge, you know, when I look back and go, holy cow, you know, did li squad at that time, I had a free good idea of how to make money, but.
1144.00s: I can remember one, one of the group vice presidents in particular was kind of on the whole country was pretty, you know, he was, he was very skeptical let's put it that way.
1155.00s: And I think for the whole five years I was there, I knew every meeting that when I presented, I was get, I was going to get from him.
1165.00s: And I was a lot of skepticism about what I was proposing. So, you know, it helped me because I knew I had to kind of be sharp with my answers, no, no, my stuff when I went in.
1175.00s: Right.
1176.00s: And I really credit my boss was well respected and he made sure we knew what we were doing when we went in, we didn't go in unprepared.
1188.00s: But it was, you know, again, it was a fun experience, but it was also I, I knew that, you know, I was kind of pulling them kicking and screaming to where we were going.
1200.00s: That makes a lot of sense. I actually think it's also really cool though that you mentioned your boss and how he was supportive of you because I feel like, you know, that's just a really important part of being able to sway old institutions like that.
1212.00s: The reason why I'm really curious about the conversation obviously is just that event in and of itself is interesting to me, but I do feel like there are some tenants of that that we see now when we're talking about cryptocurrencies coming online and a lot of, you know, places are super resistant, you know, to the idea of that kind of, you know, technology and whatnot.
1234.00s: And it's just fascinating to me how like some of those kind of tendencies can just repeat over time. Obviously different, different overall scenarios, but nonetheless, I've, I just draw parallel between those two when I think about them.
1249.00s: The other question I had just on your experience while while you were still there was you said that you took them to about 50% in equities. Do you know how to curiosity, like when you left to your next gig.
1262.00s: Did they maintain that kind of allocation? Did they, you know, as an institution, change their approach or did they go back to being a little more conservative.
1271.00s: Yeah, I wouldn't talk out of school except it was so long ago.
1275.00s: I can interestingly part of my success there, like I said, I had, if you look at the style boxes or you look at the performance boxes, you know, you have the four quartiles and it was the SEI pension fund equity, pension fund universe.
1294.00s: I was compared against pretty much the pension fund universe in the country. And if you look at the boxes, I was outside the top four tiles outside top percentile, I was, you know, we appear and, and so part of the way I did that and I wasn't necessarily the strategy was the web rip, but I wasn't doing performance reasons other than that was what I thought we should do.
1320.00s: And the, in the early 80s inflation peak, the oil peak.
1327.00s: And I, and I think this is where so much, you know, all the way out to now 40 years later, I see the same mistakes being made by money managers is they tend to manage looking backwards.
1343.00s: So they're extrapolating what's going on. And what I said was, this was 1982. So we were, we were in the midst of a recession, but we had just come through oil going from, you know, wherever it came from to 100 plus dollars.
1364.00s: And we, you know, oil was the darling on the street. So all the portfolios across Wall Street were loaded with oil 30, 30, 35% of the S&P was energy, and particularly oil.
1378.00s: And I had zero weighting in oil. I basically said, if you're looking backwards, yes, that's where you want to be. If you're looking forward, we're basically at the peak point in inflation.
1390.00s: That point was 20% or what had been in 1981. So I said, you know, where most managers were saying we need inflation at stocks. I said, we're at the maximum point for inflation.
1405.00s: Everything going forward, the rate of change, you know, the forward looking change is going to be away from inflation, even though you're going to go maybe from 2018 and then 18 to 16, you know, so you're still getting high inflation, you're moving on a rate of change basis away from inflation.
1424.00s: And I said, basically the Fed will, you know, it's committed to taking inflation down, racking inflation down over time, not over a few years, but over a cycle or two or three.
1435.00s: And so I said, what you want to own, if this is the peak of inflation, is you want to own those things that got beat up by inflation. So that means gross stocks. That means, you know, particularly the consumer gross stock.
1449.00s: I was buying Coca-Cola at book value, I was buying Warner Lambert, which was a big drug company at book value, I was buying Merck at book value, I was buying, I'm trying to think of some of the other names I had, but they were basically, carnation was one, just a food company.
1468.00s: They were things that were really flat on their butts, because inflation had really damages them. And, but I was looking at what was going to happen going forward.
1480.00s: And that two things really helped my portfolio, one was I didn't have the things that became laggard so the things that were dragging down other portfolios, meaning energy, you know, that had peaked and was now over a long period of time that would be distributed.
1496.00s: And I had the things that were beginning to be accumulated. So what happened from 1982 to 1991 is you had some of those gross stocks go through the roof, you know, you had a big long gross stock consumer gross stock cycle where all the brand name companies did exceptionally well.
1517.00s: And when I bought them, they were hated nobody wanted them. So, you know, very early on and I had been before I got to text, I've been contraint, you know, it just comes naturally to me to want to be where other people aren't.
1532.00s: And to want to as as Wayne Gretzkeevs to say, you know, what makes me great or when people ask why he was so good, he said, I, I skate to where the puck's going, not where the puck is.
1545.00s: And it's kind of like that you want to look ahead, not focus on backward or as I call it review mirror investing or sometimes I called extrapolation fever people extrapolate current trends to the to the future.
1562.00s: And a lot of times if you're at a turning point, that's the worst thing you can do.
1566.00s: That it's yeah, I mean, it makes so much sense and it feels like traders, we hear that from so many different places and you know folks that follow the markets and then, you know, there it is everybody's there with like their technical analysis, which is all historic in nature, you know, it's just it's
1583.00s: historic.
1584.00s: It's historic and it's typically momentum driven.
1587.00s: Yep, so if you're if you're an inflection point, that's the last thing you want to do is go with the momentum because it's going to reverse right. Yeah, that's that that's.
1598.00s: I don't know, I look at that and it sounds it's those are the kinds of things that in hindsight, it's like, yeah, that's the obvious move, but I feel like what people don't capture when people like you say those things is just the amount of conviction you had to have to actually
1616.00s: be a contrarian to actually do something that everybody else was kind of nervous to do.
1623.00s: Again, just from like a personal perspective, I would be really curious to just dive into that a little bit more to understand, you know, the the concept behind looking forward, projecting, you know, in terms of your best assessments where the market is going, not where it's been.
1641.00s: But how do you reconcile with yourself in making those decisions when you look left and look right and the trend everybody else is stocking up on oil and you're like, well, you know, I don't know about oil, it doesn't seem like it's going to be the next big thing. Do you think that your conviction was just well, I think this is going to happen to go with it or like how did you get comfortable being that person that is the contrarian in that scenario.
1667.00s: Yeah, in that particular case, it was, you know, I had my certainly my my MBA was in Chicago, so I had a monitorist kind of background coming in.
1684.00s: And you know what the Fed was doing, I really from early on was a Fed watcher and somebody who really was fascinating by macro, so I felt my macro by the time I was, you know, eight or 10 years into the business.
1699.00s: I had a pretty strong macro background, so I had that part of it where I looked at the Fed said they're very committed to inflation, winding out inflation, not quickly, but you know, over time.
1713.00s: So that that was the macro side of it that said, yeah, if you're going to see inflation peak here and ratchet down over time, you want to what benefits from that.
1724.00s: So that's the one side of the coin, the other side of the coin is really the investor psychology side of the coin, which is understanding how much psychology plays a role in investing and how much it plays a role in prices.
1739.00s: And, and being an I always say, I think I'm a natural contrary and in that I would say probably 90% of people are not comfortable.
1750.00s: Marching to their own drummer, they're not comfortable being outside the crowd. They may say they are, but when push comes to shove they're not comfortable if they're way apart from the crowds.
1761.00s: I've never had that problem. It doesn't bother me. If ever, in fact, you know, certainly through 48 years now doing this.
1769.00s: The times when I know on right or when I'm going to have most success is when people are calling me a fool and saying, you know, because psychology has taken over the narrative.
1780.00s: And and crowds, I call it. And so it's, it's when nobody agrees with me that I usually have my best success.
1787.00s: That I, I literally love that it's something that I talk a bit about on at least with my audience is just investors slash trader psychology and kind of really understanding ourselves, but then also understanding that a lot of the models that we use even, you know, in derivatives with the blacksholes model pricing a lot of things are built around people that execute in a very specific lot of things that are really important.
1817.00s: And so that's a logical way. And, you know, a big disjointed function of that is the fact that, you know, the markets really aren't rational all the time. There are plenty of instances where there is like human psychology that's integrated in one way or another.
1835.00s: I feel like that effect can't really be overstated because a lot of folks still look at their models and stuff and say, well, why is this happening? This isn't, you know, right.
1845.00s: And then they, you know, they fail to remember that the markets, even institutions and stuff, they're still people.
1852.00s: And there's still an inject of the human psyche and in, you know, what's going on. I, that really resonates, you know, that part of a message.
1860.00s: The other thing that I think most people don't understand most investors don't understand.
1866.00s: And a lot of even professionals, I think forget is the stock market or any market is a discounting mechanism. So it's discounting things way ahead of the time that it occurs, the stock market in particular will be this kind of things sometimes six months out.
1884.00s: And yet the way people think and it's helped along by the CNBCs of the world is they think that market movement is based on today's new. So because every day they get a some, you know, they get a summation of what happened today and they always tell you the reason why happened.
1901.00s: Except in, you know, in the, in the scheme of things in the longer scheme of things.
1907.00s: What's going on in the market today, maybe discounting what's going to happen, you know, three to six months out.
1913.00s: Because there are lots of things you can, lots of factors you can look at.
1918.00s: What we call.
1920.00s: Second derivative items, you know, raise of rate of change things like that that investors look at or analysts look at. So it's very hard for a retail investors to understand why markets don't don't move the way logically they expect them to so like today or this week.
1942.00s: I had somebody ask me on Twitter just today. Can you explain to me.
1947.00s: Why, you know, Paul's telling us he's going to accelerate taper and do double the taper and and the tightening is going to come sooner.
1959.00s: Why did interest rates go down on that? You know, they can't quite fathom. You know, I thought if he's tightening rates are going up, but I said no, it's, you know, it's a couple of things, but it's, it's the street looking at the fact that if he's tightening, he may actually slow the economy.
1976.00s: And that's, you know, going to help bonds and you can slow inflation. And secondly, his actions are hitting the start market, you know, his comments.
1989.00s: And so it's, you know, basically it's a, they're dividing bonds as a safety, you know, they're looking at a risk of risk of.
1999.00s: Sometimes you have to kind of look further than what's obvious.
2004.00s: But going back to psychology, I get a lot of questions about, you know, because I've been around so long what, what books taught you to do what you do and how, how did you get here? Can I have those books? Can you give me a list of books? And I go, I only recommend basically one book.
2022.00s: And I was at 1977, I was already contrary and at that time, but it really resonated with me that it spoke my language. And it was a book called, at that time it was called the psychology of the stock market by David Dream, David Dream and it been a forms columnist, you know, syndicated forms columnist, but he has written many, you know, it's been revised many times.
2049.00s: And the first revision is maybe 1998 and it's called contrary and investment strategies now. So it's a different title, but I, and I only read the original, but I think it's pretty much same book.
2061.00s: And I recommend that any investor, particularly any retail investor.
2067.00s: And really, he does a very good job of explaining this, how much psychology plays a role in investing and in stock market.
2077.00s: And I think that is the most important lesson that investor need to learn because they, they really can't, they don't understand psychology and how that impacts.
2089.00s: And you mentioned that book because that's that's actually one that I meant to our spoke about a little bit and it's the original version. I actually didn't know that it that it was revised into the contrary and investment strategies.
2100.00s: I, I got to check that one out because he used to share, you know, pieces of the older version with me, but I actually be really curious to see how it's, you know, evolved over time because I think a lot of, I don't know, even the nature of being a contrary and I feel like his changed over time.
2116.00s: And with how far you take the concept of being a contrary and so that's, I'm glad you mentioned that book. Thank you. So I definitely will check that one out.
2127.00s: So then we're moving along in your career a little bit. You ended up shifting kind of to macro analysis macro view of the markets. What drew you that direction.
2141.00s: I was kind of personal sorry, but my daughter became very ill with Lyme disease and missed high school. Basically, she went from top, top student in her class in her grade in a, in a good school system in Connecticut and Olympic development level soccer player wants to play division one soccer.
2164.00s: And the eighth grade that diagnosed with Lyme disease, we didn't realize for several months what was going on. Yeah.
2172.00s: And she ended up missing high school. She missed five years of school because people don't realize, but it's, it's a neurological disease. It gets me nervous system.
2181.00s: And that had really can really, she had severe teeth to the point again, this was a highly tuned athlete. She played basketball softball and soccer and soccer in particular year round.
2195.00s: There were times when I had to carry her up to bed because she didn't have the energy to climb the stairs. So it was a real dramatic change for us. And I just made the choice to stay home and look for answers and get her turned around.
2212.00s: It took a lot longer than I expected, but I had a friend that had covered the wall street. And he said, if you want to be our strategist, come on, you know, come on in.
2223.00s: You can work from home and do your work there. So that, that was really what triggered me going from what's known as the vice side to the cell side in terms of, you know, the social side strategist for a firm in New York.
2239.00s: And that's, yeah, that, that, yeah, good news is she in five years, I became, I mean, to this day, I'm a Lyme disease advocate patient advocate and ran sport groups from 2004 until now to help people.
2258.00s: And, you know, I've been very involved in, and, you know, looking for answers and staying up to speed on research and things.
2268.00s: But she ended up turning around. She got her GD. She, like I said, she literally in this five years of school, got her GD scored really high on her SATs in spite of basically an eighth grade education, plus, plus a few other classes.
2284.00s: And she ended up graduating with an economics and chemistry degree with a 4.0 from a school. So she, you know, she was that kind of kid, which she just didn't give up.
2297.00s: She didn't get her down. You know, took a lot away from her. She, you know, that was my passion. I wanted to play soccer. I never got a chance to even play high school. So, yeah, she had those kind of things, but she, she made the best and she's, you know, she's a mom of three boys now. So she's doing pretty good.
2315.00s: That's awesome. Yeah, sometimes, you know, we might have like a specific projection for life and then life does what life does adds up a pretty good curveball. Just at a curiosity. Did she get lime disease from a ticker. Was it something else.
2328.00s: Yeah, we lived on eight acres and in Connecticut and connect it's kind of the epicenter.
2334.00s: Yeah. And at the time, I didn't know what I know now about line and unfortunately the 99% of the public doesn't know because the establishment doesn't put out good information.
2350.00s: If you catch it early and treat it properly and those are key words because you can treat him properly, even though you catch it early. But if you catch it early and treat it aggressively, you can knock it out and never have a problem.
2363.00s: In her case, we didn't really catch it till a year into it. So it's gotten into a nervous system and really wreaked havoc. I mean, we saw a kid who was really the top student in a class for five years was a special ed student.
2379.00s: For three years, she said, I can read this to you dad, but I can't tell you what it means anymore. I can't follow it. So it's, I will tell you an awful lot of Alzheimer's, an awful lot of dementia.
2391.00s: You see, you see if you go on Cape Cod or somewhere in nursing home, you'll see 45 year old men with dementia. I guarantee it's lime disease undignosed.
2402.00s: A lot of what we're seeing with long haul COVID is kind of what we saw with lime disease.
2408.00s: It's interesting. I just remember, I'm like said, I'm from New York and my dad and I we would go hunting and one time, like we always try to check each other over for text, especially in your back and stuff. And I remember we plucked one off of him, but then like two days later, he had that big old dinner plate red bullseye there and we're like, uh oh.
2426.00s: And he's we're we're Polish in descent. So, you know, making fun of ourselves a little bit, he just said, whatever, you know, just completely ignored it and sure of shit, it started to become a big issue. So that's why it's curious. I just remember in the Northeast, the test when they're.
2444.00s: I'm in the country now, but it's the Northeast is really that percent are in New York's loaded.
2450.00s: You know, no one's loaded. Yeah, but it's but it's down in Texas, it's out in California, it's down south.
2458.00s: And I can't tell you I won't spend time here saying it, but the CDC and the establishment are just so wrong headed on it and they put out stuff that they, you know, this is just, it's really, if people knew what this cause, there's an awful lot of what we call.
2473.00s: A lot of what we call auto immune disease, you know, the MS is the world on awful lot of that is undiagnosed. I say line disease, but it's really tick-borne disease because the tick spring in several different neurological diseases.
2488.00s: And because they don't the CDC will and the infection disease side refused to accept that line can be long lasting as an infection, even if you treated it can evade the treatment.
2504.00s: They they just say three would say in a box if you still say you have line that's in your head, you just imagine it. So, so you really have chronic line disease is a very serious problem that's not really being addressed properly.
2517.00s: It's interesting. Yeah, it's really interesting. It my dad definitely fell in that same category, just where he definitely didn't treat it right looking back at it.
2526.00s: Yeah, there are specials. I always say to people if you have cancer, you go to an oncologist, you don't go to your PCP. Right. It's the same, it's the same thing with this. You can go to what we call line literate doctors that are the ones in the trenches that know how to treat this long term.
2541.00s: And you know, they know the tricks and they know the proper treatments. If you go to your PCP, they're going to give you, you know, standard infectious disease guidelines.
2551.00s: And again, if you catch it very early, that might do it. But if you have an chronic form, it's impossible to treat that way.
2559.00s: Right. Yeah, it needs more robust protocols.
2563.00s: Yeah. Well, it's really good to hear that she, you know, got got her life in a better spot for herself and move forward. That's honestly, those stories are always really awesome to hear in that sense. We get a lot of it, you know, from the military.
2577.00s: And so when you step out through this horrible scenarios, and some of them just find this magical way to rebound, I always find those people just to be really inspirational so thank you, at least for sharing her story to you cause that that is inspirational to hear.
2592.00s: So something that a few of the folks for my audience are like, really curious about is obviously last year with COVID and all that super unique scenario that that we experienced.
2606.00s: throughout this year in a lot of ways, it seemed,
2609.12s: at least for me, a bit of an anomaly
2610.68s: in certain instances, but I'd love to start
2614.72s: to just get an understanding of how you view
2618.16s: the markets in 2020, looking back at the whole year.
2622.28s: What did you see that you were like,
2624.16s: that kind of stood out to you?
2626.88s: Yeah, I came into 2020 with a view
2631.32s: that we were gonna have a meltup,
2633.48s: probably first half of 2020, and then global bust,
2637.80s: and a big bear market.
2641.76s: In February, I said, if you remember,
2645.72s: the market was moving up and up and up,
2648.60s: and I kept saying it's gonna come down
2652.24s: and people started picking on me
2654.28s: because I was for weeks, and I think we're near the top,
2658.76s: it should roll over and it kept going higher.
2661.24s: And they said, no, your meltup is happening now,
2664.56s: and I said, no, I just,
2666.56s: there's too many people on the bandwagon right now.
2669.76s: So in February, I was talking about a 10% correction,
2673.08s: and then we got the 10% correction from whatever it was,
2675.72s: 3,300 down to the 3,000, or slightly under,
2678.92s: is what I was looking for.
2680.56s: And I go, great, I look great.
2681.88s: This is exactly what I called, you know,
2683.68s: and I was, you know, unbeknownst to me
2687.68s: that turned into a 30% or 35% correction.
2691.36s: So I don't claim credit,
2693.16s: because I thought 10% were all we're gonna get,
2695.56s: or maybe a little more than that.
2698.00s: So I get, you know, people were picking on me for,
2700.48s: well, you didn't see this coming, you know,
2702.12s: right?
2702.96s: So I don't suddenly think people that were picking on me
2707.28s: for, or, you know, give me a grief for,
2711.52s: you know, call for a correction that wasn't coming,
2714.08s: now we're gonna give me a grief
2715.32s: because I called for two smaller corrections.
2717.32s: So, but in March of 2020,
2721.52s: when we saw in three weeks,
2723.68s: the market go from that top down 35%, three weeks,
2728.96s: it would have been easy for me to say,
2732.56s: I guess we had our meltup, I guess we had our top,
2735.68s: you know, we're not gonna get the real meltup I expected.
2738.64s: And now we're heading into the bust,
2740.76s: because you know what it looked like then,
2742.84s: it was really a bust.
2744.36s: And it would have been easy for me to switch gears
2747.24s: and say, you know, I guess I was, you know,
2751.44s: a little premature or looking for a little more
2755.84s: than we're getting.
2756.68s: And this thing is rolling over sooner than I expected.
2759.72s: And I got to switch gears and become bearish.
2762.00s: I looked and I said, can that really be the case?
2765.32s: And I looked at my work and I,
2767.72s: there was just a sentiment that turned so negative,
2769.72s: so fast and stuff I still,
2772.24s: and it had broken, you know, from a technical standpoint,
2774.92s: it had broken some important trend lines.
2777.12s: So it would have been easy for me to go bearish.
2779.96s: But I looked and I said, and this comes with, again,
2784.04s: how much I put stock in sentiment.
2787.08s: And I said, the sentiment is rock bottom.
2790.16s: This is the kind of sentiment we see at bottoms, not tops.
2793.76s: And I'm not talking about short term,
2796.00s: I'm talking about important bottoms.
2798.20s: So I said, no, it looks like all we're getting here,
2801.24s: what's the market likes to do, is it to fake down,
2803.36s: that's a fake breakdown.
2805.44s: And so when almost the entire street was calling for lower,
2810.00s: like into the teens on the S&P,
2813.36s: I said, this is the bottom, 2200.
2816.60s: And I am sticking with my meltup target
2821.32s: of something over 4,000 this year.
2824.20s: So I expected we were gonna go from 2200 back up
2828.32s: and see something over 4,000,
2830.72s: maybe before the end of 2020.
2832.76s: It obviously took longer.
2834.88s: But I raised my, I think I had a 4200 target on the S&P.
2841.56s: I then raised that to 4,500.
2846.56s: Then I raised it again, this is over the course of the last 18 months
2849.80s: to 47 in the 800.
2852.60s: And right now I'm at, and then 5,000, right now I'm at 5,300 on the S&P.
2858.08s: So, and it's all been part of that same scenario.
2863.00s: That's the start clock.
2866.08s: Sorry, I was just throwing up a chart
2868.16s: so everybody could kind of follow along some of the price
2870.36s: that you're saying it makes it a little easier.
2872.84s: Sure, yeah.
2873.84s: So from that 2200 back in March,
2876.60s: where you see the waterfall cascade down there,
2880.92s: yeah, I expected that over the course of the next six to 12 months,
2884.92s: we'd get up over 4,000, maybe 4,200.
2888.52s: As we progressed through, it became obvious to me,
2892.04s: particularly with all the money that was being thrown into the system
2895.64s: and all the fiscal expansion that this thing had more legs than that.
2900.40s: So I raised it 4,500.
2903.08s: And I did these, I didn't do it when we got there.
2905.72s: I probably raised it 4,500 before we got to 4,000.
2910.24s: And then I raised it to 5,000 before we got to 4,300, I think.
2915.88s: And people think, somehow that's wrong
2920.44s: that you shouldn't be changing your targets.
2922.52s: And I said, I'm moving it as the evidence points to it.
2925.68s: Right.
2926.60s: I'm not going in the other direction.
2928.12s: I'm going higher.
2929.36s: And I'm doing it well before I reach my original targets.
2932.16s: So, and so I'm now at 5,300.
2935.76s: And I think I'm probably going to end up raising it again.
2939.16s: My expectation is we'll be in a meltup following this,
2943.04s: I called this pullback.
2944.40s: I got beat up in November because it wasn't coming.
2948.00s: I said, you're going to have probably a 6% pullback in the S&P
2952.00s: and maybe a little more in the NASDAQ.
2954.56s: And then I expect a final leg up into a top.
2960.16s: And I called this a 39 year secular bull market top.
2964.04s: In other words, we started the bull market in August 1982,
2967.72s: but I was talking about when I was a tech run.
2969.88s: Yeah, that was the beginning of this secular bull market.
2972.52s: We've had cyclical bull markets through many cycles here.
2977.00s: But the full secular move started in August of 1982.
2981.04s: And I think we'll end in 2022.
2985.40s: Man, that.
2987.04s: So then that's a, every time I zoom out far enough,
2991.08s: I like it anything from 2009 plus.
2993.28s: This just looks just very interesting to me.
2997.00s: Just an absolute bleed up.
3000.16s: So something I'm curious.
3001.60s: Oh, sorry, go ahead.
3002.84s: Yeah, so what happens at the end of a big cycle,
3006.64s: not a cycle like 2009 to now,
3011.12s: but a big secular move.
3013.96s: What happens is as you move towards the end of that,
3018.00s: you go parabolic.
3020.72s: So the smoke gets steeper and steeper.
3023.24s: And that's the last leg of this bull market, if I'm correct,
3028.32s: is going to be almost vertical.
3029.72s: So you will cover, I think, a move from, let's say,
3033.40s: we're around 4500 now on the S&P.
3039.04s: Let's say we move up to 5500.
3045.92s: I think you'll cover that ground.
3047.68s: That's 1,000 points.
3050.36s: In somewhere between three and six months.
3054.08s: And I'm thinking it may be closer to three than six.
3059.44s: What role do you think this is a little bit of a sidestep?
3066.56s: I want to come back to this conversation,
3068.20s: but I just, something I'm really curious about for folks
3071.04s: like you, what role do you see retail traders playing
3076.68s: in the overall market development?
3079.44s: And I say that because I've been reading a bunch of white papers
3083.44s: that talks about the advent of things,
3086.44s: like game of fine trading or game of fine stock buying apps
3090.80s: like Robinhood.
3092.24s: And some folks are speculating that with the just significant
3096.76s: influx of retail trader money as a whole, obviously,
3099.84s: a lot of retail traders as individuals don't really count
3103.60s: for much.
3104.52s: But as an entire group, they start to matter,
3107.44s: you know, at least a little bit.
3109.12s: Do you think that that affects your projections
3113.72s: in terms of the market movement?
3115.32s: Or do you think that, you know, they're kind of just along
3118.12s: for the ride and the market is still going to continue
3120.68s: to move based off of just those bigger volume
3124.28s: and bigger-sized trades, you know, institutions, hedge funds,
3126.92s: things like that?
3128.32s: Yeah.
3128.60s: So my view is as a contrarian, one reason I'm a contrarian,
3133.40s: probably a primary reason is that at bottoms in markets,
3138.44s: whether you're talking stock, sir,
3139.84s: Vaughan, or what have you, at bottoms,
3144.00s: the vast majority of people are bearish, right?
3147.40s: At tops, the vast majority of people are bullish, are bulls.
3151.60s: So I just view what's going on in the retail market
3155.72s: with Robinhood and the MEMS, et cetera, or the MEMS stocks,
3158.56s: et cetera, it's just a sign of how far along we are
3162.56s: in the secular bull market.
3164.64s: It's just, you know, it's more symptomatic of where we're at,
3169.48s: for a long time, investors were skeptical and were bearish.
3173.88s: So for much of the last 10 years,
3176.80s: we've had pundits trying to call tops, you know,
3179.76s: saying we're at a top.
3181.44s: And the retail public was probably because it
3186.80s: would happen in 2008-09 and a lot of things that have happened
3190.28s: since, but they were skeptical and didn't want to commit money.
3193.52s: So they had money market funds have grown to huge amounts.
3197.48s: And a lot of people were in bonds and not in stocks
3201.32s: or were very, you know, lightly invested in stocks.
3205.44s: And in the last year, you've had that change
3208.84s: where the retail public is coming into the market
3211.16s: because it just became too obvious
3213.68s: that they were missing something.
3215.04s: So I do that as a more of a sign that we're getting near the top,
3220.16s: rather than, you know, a driving element of the top.
3223.92s: That's a really, really interesting perspective on that.
3226.68s: I literally hadn't thought about it that way,
3228.28s: but that seriously makes a ton of sense
3230.56s: because if there's enough of a draw for those folks
3233.68s: like going off of your previous comments
3236.28s: on, you know, the parabolic nature of things,
3238.72s: especially it's so difficult to get a, like,
3241.36s: with inflation word is, at least right now,
3243.20s: to get like a positive real rate of returns.
3246.04s: I mean, you pretty much have to go
3248.28s: into equities in some capacities.
3249.92s: If you're doing anything else, you know,
3252.28s: you're bleeding maybe a little more slowly,
3254.52s: but inflation is kind of killing you.
3256.28s: So that's a really interesting way to look at that.
3260.76s: Speaking of inflation, and I know that we're coming up on time,
3264.56s: so I have a few more questions if you have, you know,
3267.36s: if you have a few minutes,
3268.28s: there's a couple others I had for you.
3272.60s: How do you view inflation right now
3276.32s: and just the Fed's approach to managing it?
3280.20s: So we talked a little earlier, you know,
3282.16s: about starting to hint towards maybe tightening policy
3284.96s: a little bit, but just curious your thoughts on that.
3288.36s: Yeah, my view is we printed so much money
3292.64s: and there's a lag to when that money has an impact on inflation.
3296.52s: So, you know, and we print a lot of money in QE1 and QE2
3301.60s: and QE3, but this last thing since March 2020
3307.48s: is off the charts.
3308.44s: I mean, we've never, you know, the Fed balance sheet
3312.76s: in October of 2008 was 875 billion.
3320.44s: Today we're at 8.5 trillion.
3323.04s: Yep.
3323.88s: And most of that 8.5 trillion, more than half of it
3326.72s: has occurred in the last 18 months.
3329.08s: You know, they went from 3.7 to 8.5.
3332.16s: Right.
3333.00s: And it's way to 10.
3334.40s: So, so that money with a lag does create inflation.
3339.40s: And I think that's what we're seeing.
3341.76s: Inflation is breaking out for the first time in, you know, 30 or 40 years.
3346.24s: After ratcheting down from that early 1980s high
3350.24s: and going from 20% inflation down to almost zero,
3354.48s: we're now back up at talking about 6% numbers.
3358.20s: And obviously, and my belief is that we're going to accelerate
3362.20s: from here that we're probably not done.
3364.36s: Even though the Fed's talking about taper
3367.56s: and probably is going to taper,
3370.28s: inflation doesn't react to tightening quickly.
3375.44s: It, you know, that you've kind of built in some momentum here.
3378.48s: So I expect over the course of the next six months,
3381.12s: inflation to go higher.
3384.84s: And I will keep the Fed saying, yeah, we've got to do more.
3387.96s: So, so that's, I think what's going to lead to Fed tightening
3393.24s: and what will lead to the end of this cycle
3396.08s: and what will lead to what I am calling a global bust.
3400.08s: And I define a bust as opposed to recession
3403.36s: as something that's maybe almost as bad as a depression
3408.56s: and some, some magnitude, but happens at the speed of a recession.
3413.12s: So it's not drawn out like the great depression was over a decade.
3417.44s: It's something where you'll have the damage of the recession.
3421.72s: The damage of, you know, we used the term great recession for 2008-09.
3427.68s: I'd say the bust is something greater than the great,
3430.68s: great recession, but not the length of a great depression.
3433.48s: So, so in other words, we're looking at, in my opinion,
3437.60s: the downturn here when it comes has a potential
3441.88s: to be the worst in the post-war war two era
3444.84s: and the worst since the great depression.
3446.96s: So, you know, something pretty bad.
3450.12s: And what happened relatively fast
3453.92s: and the reason I think we get there is we have 300,
3459.52s: I used to say to earn 50, but we have $300 trillion in global debt.
3465.04s: We went from $250 to $300 in just the last 18 months.
3468.08s: So we have 300 trillion in global debt.
3471.68s: We're adding trillions in the tens of numbers
3476.96s: in the matter of a year.
3478.52s: I mean, that's an incredible stuff.
3481.12s: Nobody can, if you ask anybody,
3483.76s: nobody could really give you a hand
3486.72s: and have a handle on what a trillion dollars is.
3489.84s: Right.
3490.68s: And yet we're at 300 trillion global debt.
3494.16s: We're at quadrillions in terms of the social value of derivatives.
3498.48s: Those are both debt and derivatives
3500.52s: are both forms of leverage.
3502.64s: Right.
3503.48s: One's leverage on markets, one's leverage on the economy,
3506.52s: but leverage works both ways.
3509.68s: It enhances returns on the way up.
3512.64s: It really destroys returns on the way down
3514.96s: and it exacerbates things.
3516.88s: So my thing is that what would normally be a recession
3521.76s: turns into something far worse
3523.24s: because of we've never been here before.
3525.40s: We've never had leverage like this.
3528.12s: Not even in 2008-19.
3530.24s: We're not even close to those levels.
3532.52s: We're way beyond those levels.
3534.68s: And we've not had a downturn since 2009
3537.40s: to test what happens with this kind of leverage.
3541.48s: So very simply, I think what might have been a normal recession
3545.88s: turns into something far steeper and worse.
3549.60s: But it happens fast because leverage on wind fast.
3552.88s: And secondly, you've had a pandemic
3557.04s: unlike anything we've seen in our lifetimes.
3560.28s: And that pandemic, I mean, good God,
3563.40s: we had a shutdown of the entire global economy
3566.04s: for a quarter or more.
3569.04s: So what we have is an economy that's far more fragile
3573.36s: because of the pandemic, coupled with an economy
3576.76s: that's far more leveraged.
3578.96s: When you combine that and then you tighten,
3581.92s: you may find that it doesn't take much tightening
3584.28s: to trigger a real big unwind.
3587.44s: And that's my thesis anyway.
3588.92s: That's my expectation.
3590.12s: So I'm calling for a second half of 2022 for the bust.
3595.12s: What role do you think?
3598.40s: So something I saw, I think the financial times
3600.68s: put out a just fascinating chart to me.
3604.40s: And it was like showing a declining graphic
3608.20s: essentially of on market volume.
3612.40s: So meaning that there's a lot of trade volume
3614.96s: starting to happen off exchange.
3617.16s: So via dark pools and things like that.
3620.48s: I'm curious, do you think, so I guess
3623.20s: I'll give you my hypothesis on that.
3624.80s: I think that your expectations in terms of the decline,
3630.28s: although based on probably a much broader amount
3633.84s: of information than what I'm basing mine on,
3636.68s: I have a similar conclusion to you
3639.08s: in that there's likely a rapid unwind in the next 18 months.
3645.08s: And one of the things I was thinking about that
3648.08s: just made me feel like it was going to be something
3651.84s: we hadn't seen before is just the amount of off exchange volume
3655.16s: that is starting to be generated.
3657.08s: Because I just feel like in those instances,
3660.24s: whenever we've seen that happen before,
3662.28s: when the unwind comes, it's typically just vicious
3666.20s: because there is a ton of selling
3668.32s: and then it starts going on market and off exchange
3671.44s: almost simultaneously.
3672.44s: I'm curious, do you have an opinion on just the movement
3676.32s: of volume over time?
3678.00s: Or do you think that the whole,
3679.80s: like your whole projection is bigger than that concept?
3682.96s: Yeah, I would look at it this way,
3685.76s: which is that we've had since 2009,
3689.92s: this onward, no, it's moved.
3693.64s: And so you've had people accumulating stock spawns,
3699.64s: derivatives, what have you all through the last,
3705.36s: what is it, 11 years?
3708.64s: So, and then you have an event that has that unwind
3713.56s: get concentrated in a very short period of time.
3715.80s: So yeah, I can certainly see where off market volume
3721.04s: or off market activity has never had nothing tested.
3726.88s: And so it all becomes basically part of the ill liquidity
3731.48s: that you see in a down graph like that.
3733.60s: And what gives when you have ill liquidity is price.
3737.88s: If you, if you, if everybody's on one side of the ship
3740.52s: and they go to the other side of the ship,
3744.52s: if everybody's moving as a crowd,
3747.60s: it means you're not gonna have much
3749.96s: on the other side of that trade to hold.
3752.48s: And then price just caves.
3754.48s: So I think we're set up because of the length of this
3758.76s: steady, you know, yeah, we had March of 2020
3761.72s: by the last, you know, a month, three weeks.
3765.60s: Yep. We've had some cell loss.
3767.44s: We had December of 2018 or, you know, a few months prior to that.
3772.28s: But, but really we've had this steadiness,
3775.88s: steadily climbing higher and higher and higher.
3779.08s: And then also when you have this, you know,
3781.56s: this one, one time catch up move.
3785.80s: And I think, you know, we've seen it in flash crashes.
3789.08s: This is a flash crash.
3790.32s: This is a bear market.
3792.00s: But over the course of several months,
3794.72s: I can, I can see an 80% bear market.
3798.20s: Interesting.
3799.48s: That's interesting.
3800.32s: So that's peak peak to trough.
3802.00s: Yeah. Now we haven't had a peak to trough market like that.
3805.60s: We, I think we declined 60% in 2008,
3808.64s: 2009 in the S&P.
3810.80s: Yep.
3811.80s: 29, we had a 90% drop 29 to 32.
3816.60s: In 2000 and now it's back dropped,
3819.16s: I think 80 or 90%.
3820.80s: But the whole market didn't, the S&P didn't drop nearly
3824.24s: much at all compared to that.
3826.60s: Right.
3827.44s: This is going to be a global bear market
3831.44s: where the whole globe is going to have big bear markets.
3835.52s: And, and our 80%, when I say 80%,
3838.56s: that's 80% in the S&P 80% in the NASDAQ 80% across the board.
3843.00s: You know, it's not going to take very many prisoners.
3846.04s: Right.
3848.00s: It's, I think your projection is,
3852.36s: it's interesting to me because I have,
3856.08s: especially in 2022, I definitely was expecting a pullback,
3859.88s: but a lot of the information you shared,
3862.56s: even right now has changed.
3863.96s: My thought on it a little bit just in terms of the severity,
3867.48s: because as you start adding more detail
3870.84s: that you're picking up on,
3873.12s: that I hadn't necessarily considered,
3874.84s: it like it does start to paint, you know, a bigger picture.
3877.60s: It's going to be interesting.
3880.96s: The only thing I caution is I am calling for that meltup first.
3884.96s: Right.
3885.80s: And, and right now it's not hard to sell people on the idea
3889.76s: that we're going to have a bust.
3891.24s: Or it's not hard to sell people on the fact
3893.56s: that we're going to have a big bear market,
3895.64s: you know, particularly after, you know,
3897.80s: this most recent sell off.
3901.24s: If we run up 1000 points in the S&P,
3903.84s: and it could be more than that,
3905.00s: but something like that,
3906.00s: and of course it's in the next three to six months,
3909.04s: that's how college is going to be totally shifted around,
3912.04s: where at the top, I can predict right now, at the top,
3917.12s: people are going to call me crazy
3918.68s: for talking about a bear market.
3920.36s: They're going to say, oh no, this thing has legs,
3922.60s: you know, don't you understand?
3924.08s: There's, right.
3925.36s: There's all this stuff going on that's good
3927.32s: in the world and the economy, et cetera.
3929.32s: So just know that it's easy when,
3932.64s: when things are going south to be,
3935.24s: to see the negatives,
3937.36s: it's going to be very hard to see them when, you know,
3940.16s: because the market's not going to be up 1000 points
3942.64s: for no reason.
3943.48s: It's going to have good news with it.
3945.56s: Right.
3947.92s: So one more question.
3950.04s: You've already shared a lot of your thoughts on 2022.
3953.28s: So that was, you know, one of the things I wanted to ask you,
3955.44s: but if you were to bubble up maybe the top two or three things
3961.20s: that you are looking for slash watching for 2022,
3966.60s: what pieces of information, what, you know,
3969.40s: sentiments are most important to you
3971.20s: looking into the next year.
3974.04s: I don't know, it really is watching how,
3977.72s: how the investor evolves with the market.
3980.40s: I mean, if, how the house sentiment evolves with the market,
3983.48s: as you get to the point where you have universal view
3988.16s: of a bull market, you know, the universal bullishness,
3992.28s: that's when you want to start getting nervous.
3996.52s: And, you know, everybody has to kind of choose their own point
3999.80s: at which they, you know, they want to anticipate this
4005.32s: because some people say, you know,
4010.84s: if we're going to drop 80% I want to, I don't want to get out now
4014.08s: because I can't sleep.
4015.56s: What if I'm wrong?
4016.32s: What, you know, what if it happens sooner or whatever?
4018.56s: So some people will not want to be part of that run up to the top.
4024.40s: Other people play right to the edge and some will go over the edge and miss it.
4029.12s: So I mean, it's everybody's going to kind of figure that out.
4031.88s: But ultimately, the things I'm watching for for a top will be,
4036.12s: I mean, obviously the fundamentals will be part of it,
4038.36s: but more importantly, it's a sentiment and the market movement itself.
4043.84s: You know, when I say vertical, I really think this could be,
4047.48s: has the potential to be quite stunning in terms of how much ground gets covered
4053.20s: in a short time.
4055.12s: And that becomes hard to resist.
4057.84s: Yeah.
4058.16s: You know, think about, think about a trade you made somewhere
4061.40s: along the line where you were right.
4064.36s: You got in, you were right on that trade.
4067.68s: And then you said, but I don't want to be a pig.
4069.88s: I'm not going to get slaughtered.
4071.08s: I'm going to, I'm not going to agree.
4072.56s: I'm taking it now and you get out in the market and that,
4076.60s: that thing goes up another 10% the day after you know, the next week after you sell it.
4081.04s: I'm smiling.
4082.40s: What did I do?
4083.24s: Right?
4083.76s: I'm smiling because last year after the COVID drop, um, you know, I was like,
4089.52s: ah, you know, it's just a lot of bad news and things like that.
4092.32s: And most bear markets are, you know, like 250 days plus on average, something like that.
4097.36s: And we definitely, you know, fallen into that.
4099.12s: So I was like nibbling near the bottom and then it just like, just shot up.
4103.96s: And I was like, what the hell just happened here?
4107.52s: It just so that exact scenario happened to me last year.
4111.56s: Yeah.
4111.80s: So easy to beat yourself up and say, well, I was, I, I mean, why was I being so nimble?
4117.12s: Why was I trying to be so careful?
4118.76s: Right.
4119.16s: Whatever, but ultimately, um, you know, it's, it's going to be up to people to figure out what their sleep at night.
4127.44s: Question is, and to know there's a risk reward trade off here.
4131.44s: You know, you can, you can try to get as close to the top as you want, but just know the risk is if you stay in the party too long.
4140.00s: You know, you can watch it all go away and I hurry and I, I think that's going to be the signature of the bear market.
4146.76s: Is I think this bear market, not, I don't use it word crash because I think that implies things happen like in a matter of days.
4155.20s: Right.
4155.60s: I'm not confident that it's going to be a bear market over a matter of months, maybe, you know, I don't know whether it'll be four months, six months, eight months, 12 months, but it'll happen over a period of time.
4167.92s: And there won't be a straight line.
4169.12s: There'll be, there'll be a bear market rally in there, et cetera.
4172.96s: Pretty confident saying all that, but some of those steps down could be, you know, you could lose 30% in a week.
4180.80s: Right.
4181.36s: And, and so those that say, I'm going to ride this and they get caught up in the fundamentals or get caught up in the, the recommendations that'll be there at the top.
4192.04s: And then miss the top.
4194.04s: May, may say, GY, they get greedy after the fact.
4197.44s: So, so you got to kind of be, you know, I can't give advice and I don't have advice to give on that.
4202.64s: It's really just kind of play as it goes along.
4205.36s: But everybody has to kind of make that just the biggest thing they have to do is understand that we're in a later stage of this and that there is a pretty big downside that follows this.
4218.88s: So I told you I had that last question and I apologize because I lied to you.
4224.24s: I've one very last question I promise this time.
4228.48s: So when you talk about sentiment and like monitoring sentiment, what are some of the ways you do that.
4236.56s: Well, probably the one seat of the pants one is on Twitter.
4242.40s: I know when I'm in pretty good shape, when I'm getting a lot of people call me, you know, a tool or a fool.
4249.68s: So, no shortage of criticism on the internet.
4254.00s: I can give you an example because I've been calling for I'm probably baseball on gold and silver on the on the market on the street.
4263.68s: And it peaked out last August, August of 2020, it came out of the March bottom and had a great run.
4272.64s: I thought we'd have a few months of rest and then another big leg.
4276.64s: Well, that few months has turned into, you know, 14 months, I think, 15 months.
4283.12s: So people just want to, you know, say you're an idiot and you know, you've been you're you're broken record.
4289.52s: You keep saying you're bullish and it's going the other way.
4292.64s: But it's the asset out there that I love.
4297.92s: And you know, in terms of what it looks like, it's in my opinion, the most undervalued asset of all things out there right now.
4308.00s: And there are setups that say this thing could go very, very strongly in the next several months.
4315.68s: So, but, you know, it sold off in the last two weeks after having a nice run in October.
4323.36s: And the early November, it's it's been basically selling off.
4327.84s: And I saw that coming by and see it coming quite to this extent.
4332.96s: Right. And so now that it's just having the psychology effect on people, people that have been sitting in gold and silver over the miners.
4342.40s: I feel a lot of pain and they just start, you know, getting angry.
4348.16s: So that's once that's one sign of sentiment is when you see.
4352.72s: As I have said through 40 years, one thing that I feel I understand very well is sentiment.
4359.36s: And I have made the comment over many years that investor psychology is the strongest emotion in the world that's stronger than lover hate that when when something's going against you in a big way.
4376.00s: financially there's no bigger emotion, the emotional effect on people than that.
4383.68s: So I don't take it personally when people start slamming me for, you know, you're just wrong on gold and silver or whatever.
4391.12s: It's, you know, it's very predictable psychology.
4394.64s: And I understand it. I mean, you know, it's at the point at the point they're looking, it looks like it's never going to happen.
4400.96s: Yeah, that's fair.
4402.96s: It's, I'm actually one of those people.
4405.12s: I'm pretty bearish gold right now.
4406.56s: Good.
4407.60s: But I, but again, like with your context, I can see why I think one of the biggest arguments I see that's like bearish gold with inflation word is right now is one part of the equation.
4420.88s: But then also people are starting to conceive cryptocurrencies as like a better substitute to gold.
4430.00s: I'm not there yet myself.
4431.52s: I still think cryptocurrencies are just way too volatile to serve the purpose that gold does.
4436.64s: But yeah, in general to me, it just seems like gold has been having a dog of a time getting its feet under it.
4442.80s: But I'm actually excited.
4443.76s: I'll, I'll be watching it pretty closely going forward.
4446.08s: But I am not going to lie.
4447.36s: I have been fading the crap out of it.
4449.52s: As soon as I see it make a rally, I am hammering it.
4453.12s: Yeah, my, my forecast for gold over the next six months is 2500 really.
4460.16s: My forecast for silver over the next six months is 50.
4464.72s: So, so obviously I'm not bearish.
4467.28s: Yeah, I was going to say I'm going to just pull this up real quick so everybody can see.
4471.44s: So this is a six month daily on gold.
4475.68s: So right now we're hanging like 1780ish.
4478.56s: So you're thinking 25 sometime next year.
4481.04s: Yep.
4482.16s: That'll be, and I mean, if that pairs nicely with, you know, your, your expectation of the drawdown,
4489.84s: you know, that definitely seems within the run.
4492.24s: Yeah, actually not.
4493.76s: This is, this is prior to the bus.
4495.92s: Oh, interesting.
4497.28s: Yeah, so I expect it to come down with the rest of the asset structure in the bus, in the
4503.52s: bear market.
4504.56s: So I think it'll hold up much better than equity.
4509.68s: So equities, let's say 80%.
4512.32s: You know, gold might come back from 2500 back to 1800.
4517.84s: You know, silver might go from 50 back to 30.
4521.20s: So pretty good drop, but not back, not all the way back.
4525.04s: Right.
4525.20s: And then, and then following the bus, because what, what will have to happen in the bus,
4530.80s: and I call this the most predictable part of my forecast or the easiest part to predict,
4536.00s: we will see the, the feds balance sheet grow from 8.5 trillion now.
4541.04s: I wouldn't be surprised if it's certainly 20 trillion, maybe 30 trillion in response to the bus.
4547.36s: Oh, got it.
4548.48s: Yeah.
4548.88s: So if you have that kind of money, you know, that's many times what we saw in the last 18 months,
4554.64s: last 20 months.
4556.08s: If you have that kind of money, it's going to jumpstart inflation cycle.
4559.76s: I fully expect us to retrace fully the last 40 years of inflation, disinflation,
4566.16s: slash deflation.
4568.64s: So if we're in the bus, you could see a little bit of deflation.
4574.56s: You could go from this inflation problem now and actually see a small bit of deflation,
4579.84s: short deflation from there, let's say from 2023 to 2030, I expect we'll go from
4588.00s: zero negative to 20% plus.
4592.56s: That in eight years.
4594.24s: That will be interesting.
4595.44s: That will get silver and gold.
4597.20s: Yeah.
4597.84s: So I fully expect gold to be 10,000 plus could be 20,000 by the end of the decade.
4603.20s: I fully expect silver to be $400.
4606.16s: Man, that's awesome.
4608.40s: I love the way that I don't know, you think about the movement of those things because for me,
4615.44s: again, like my trading window, I don't think it's insignificant, but it is insignificant compared to you.
4622.08s: And even when people talk about inflation now, we're complaining about 6%.
4626.16s: You know what I mean?
4627.12s: And you've already seen 20, you know what I mean?
4629.36s: So it's just, yeah, I'm saying this is the many inflation cycle.
4633.36s: Yeah.
4633.84s: And because of what's going to happen with the bust, it's not a straight line.
4638.08s: That's what I talk about that with commodity.
4640.16s: I go, the next cycle is going to be all commodities.
4643.52s: And so yes, we've broken out here, but you've got to, you've got a bust to be between
4650.48s: this commodity run here and the big commodity run that will follow the bust
4657.36s: because I'm predicting $400 oil now the end of the decade.
4661.76s: So, but before we get there in the bust, I think oil can go back into the 20s.
4667.12s: So you will go from 20 to 425 to 400 in, you know, seven or eight years.
4675.28s: As I say to people who talk about a commodity super cycle, just be careful.
4680.16s: It's like standing on the south rim of the Grand Canyon, looking across to the north rim
4687.60s: and thinking you can walk straight across.
4690.48s: You know, you've got that canyon in between, in this case, a bust that means yes,
4695.76s: you'll have a big commodity cycle, but it's not straight from here.
4698.72s: Right.
4701.20s: Man, that's a super fun part of the conversation.
4704.56s: I literally could just keep going on that.
4707.76s: So I did promise after I lied to you the first time that the last one was actually the last question.
4713.12s: So I will shut up here.
4716.16s: But like I said, this is, I love these sessions so much, especially with folks like you that
4722.48s: have experienced what you've experienced and you know, you take the time to share it, you know,
4726.80s: with people like me and my audience.
4729.76s: Literally cannot thank you enough for taking the time to connect with us.
4733.52s: So first, you know, from that perspective, thank you personally very much.
4737.36s: It's really interesting hearing about your experience.
4741.04s: I love just learning about your background, you know, what you've seen before.
4745.84s: Definitely have a laundry list of more questions, but I'll have to, you know,
4749.68s: bug you some future time to see if I can get you back on.
4752.00s: But out of curiosity, you know, would love to hear, you know, how people can find you.
4757.36s: I know that you're on Twitter.
4758.24s: That's why I found you.
4758.96s: I follow you on there.
4759.84s: But, you know, what's your Twitter handle and what other ways can people reach out to you?
4765.52s: Sure.
4765.84s: Yeah, I'm on Twitter most every day.
4767.36s: So you can reach me there at Dave H. Contrarian.
4772.88s: And be careful there's, there's some phony accounts out there that change the spelling of
4780.16s: contrarian.
4780.88s: And so there's a lot of kind of dummy accounts out there to try to pretend they're me.
4786.72s: They'll have my profile picture and stuff.
4789.68s: So make sure it's Dave H. Contrarian spelled correctly.
4793.28s: Well, what I could do for that is I'll just in the video description.
4796.88s: I'll throw the link to it so that they can go.
4798.56s: Great.
4798.72s: Yeah, that'd be great.
4800.56s: And then I do write a quarterly letter macro letter.
4805.20s: So if anybody is by subscription, you know, there's a manual fee to it.
4810.00s: So if anybody's interested, they can direct message me on Twitter and I'll get right back to them.
4815.92s: Awesome.
4816.40s: Well, like I said, thank you so much.
4817.76s: I like sincerely enjoy this ton and I would love, you know, to do another session with you in the future.
4824.24s: Sure.
4824.56s: Yeah, we'll come back maybe in six months and see how wrong I was.
4827.36s: No.
4827.92s: Well, it's like I tell my audience all the time, you know, if you want to make a bunch of money, just do the opposite of what I do.
4834.64s: And then you'll be all right.
4835.52s: Exactly.
4836.56s: Awesome.
4838.16s: Thank you.
4838.72s: Okay, thanks, Eric.
