0.00s: Let's up, Alias.
1.32s: I'm going to walk you through a quick trade in the Russell was part of our new Tuesday
6.48s: series where I'm just sharing some trades.
9.28s: They're not all going to be winning trades.
11.40s: Actually, a lot of things that I do lose money, but this one was a very simple idea that
16.44s: happened to play out.
17.44s: So I'm going to walk you through it.
18.60s: As you know, we had the Fed cuts rates today's the 10th of December.
24.60s: So coming into this, I opted to place a trade.
29.76s: And I want to walk through the logic behind what I did in why.
35.04s: So first things first, let's zoom out just a little bit further.
39.72s: And I want to show you the performance of the Russell compared to the other indices.
48.08s: The reason why this matters is because the relationship of the Russell has been a little
52.72s: bit lagging, kind of slower.
55.40s: But you can see on the day today that the Russell had an outsized day compared
60.40s: to the others.
61.40s: It was up 1.4% almost.
64.68s: This has everything to do in my opinion with the fact that small caps are typically
71.24s: more rate sensitive than large caps.
74.72s: It also comes down to this other function.
77.48s: This was the primary signal in this trade.
81.04s: We're going to bring a pro internal stream yesterday where we literally just look
85.00s: through the markets a little bit more in detail.
87.92s: We came across this and I'm looking at a historical probability graph.
93.36s: What this is showing us is that as of yesterday, nine December, there was an 88.6% probability
100.20s: of a cut and in 11.36 probability of no cut.
105.84s: Why is that so notable to me?
108.32s: The fact that the market was still that split coming into this overall generally expected
119.88s: rate cut told me a lot.
122.00s: It told me that they're likely we're going to be players that were not fully positioned
129.00s: if the cut did happen.
131.68s: This also led to an expectation that if a cut didn't happen like most of the others that
137.48s: were higher probability that it would be catastrophic that the market would probably
141.88s: react very poorly in the near term.
145.24s: Because of this discrepancy, that led to a two different trade ideas for me.
151.36s: The first trade idea was actually to play the possibility for no cut and then the subsequent
157.52s: drop.
158.52s: I had that playbook ready to go.
160.68s: If it seemed like that was likely to occur.
163.84s: It didn't seem likely to occur.
166.20s: The other scenario ended up being what I ended up playing, which was because this discrepancy
172.84s: was high enough.
173.84s: I didn't feel like this move was going to be fully priced into the market.
178.24s: There's still a not insignificant minority, not a significant amount, but it's not insignificant.
186.68s: Minority of positioners that would need to react to this news in some way.
192.88s: What did I do?
195.48s: I kept it super simple.
197.68s: As you guys know, as part of the AAR process after action review for trades, these are the
201.92s: main things that I'm going to cover.
203.24s: I'm not going to go through them in order.
204.44s: You'll kind of hear them as I go.
206.48s: But this is what I saw.
208.68s: This is a five minute chart in Russell on the day.
212.20s: And my entry took place right there.
215.16s: It's this candle if I zoom in and I'll explain why.
221.88s: The reason why I wanted to capture this part of the move here is we're ended up entering.
231.92s: It was like 1050-ish Pacific time.
234.92s: It was actually a little closer to 1055.
238.16s: What I was attempting to capture here was asymmetric upside.
244.32s: My expectation was that when the rate statement came out, I was anticipating a pretty
251.56s: aggressive up move right after.
254.88s: And because of that, I wanted to get the trade on before the release happened because
260.00s: there's also always going to be early players that get the information just a little bit
263.52s: earlier.
264.52s: So I opted to front run the move slightly.
267.60s: The way that I did that was through futures.
271.04s: It's just a pure directional play.
273.52s: I bought 15 of the Russell futures at around 2332 that took about 220k in margin.
281.76s: And I placed a stop at 2528 and a half, which represents a total loss of 2625.
290.36s: You can see that the total risk here is miniscule, especially compared to the capital
295.56s: being used in the trade.
296.76s: Why is that?
298.16s: It's because in my idea here, I was either going to be right or I was going to be wrong.
305.88s: I didn't want to play a lot of the middle ground.
308.56s: If I was right in my idea, played out, it should not go down.
312.68s: Literally at all.
313.52s: It should just go up.
315.44s: If my idea didn't pan out and let's say it had a down tick and then it ran up, I would
322.92s: got stopped out, but that wouldn't have been my idea.
326.32s: So I still would have been wrong even if it ended up going up.
329.40s: This was a very specific idea.
332.00s: I still gave it a little breathing room as I always do.
336.44s: What that means is I didn't put it on top of where I entered.
340.12s: I still absolutely gave the trade some breathing room.
343.16s: I actually targeted giving it enough room to play with this recent consolidation that
349.16s: it had in Trudeau.
351.00s: And then using this as a general anchor point.
354.56s: So where I would have been getting out would have been like down here.
359.64s: Well with them reason for the idea that I was playing.
363.44s: Now what ended up happening was kind of simple.
367.92s: As I entered the trade, we had a beginning of a move up.
372.88s: This was not as severe as I expected at all.
377.52s: I thought that this first candle was going to be quite a bit more.
382.88s: It wasn't until the second candle that I got more of the move, which ended up giving back
389.48s: some before Powell started to speak here, which had a surge, a drop, and then a continued
397.56s: rally.
399.04s: What I did was simply use a mix of short-term moving averages.
405.48s: That's it.
406.48s: That's how I managed the profit on the way up sliding my stop up.
411.64s: So what that looks like is the stop lived down here first.
415.16s: After these first two candles, I slide the stop up to here.
419.92s: And it needs to be a close on the five-minute candle below, or if it exceeds by a certain
425.08s: percentage threshold, either of those conditions will get me out.
429.00s: Then I'm just sliding it up, sliding it up, continuing to follow the broader momentum.
434.84s: And then if I slide you out to a 15 minute, you'll kind of see a little more clearly the
439.20s: exit that I took.
442.36s: The exit occurred on this candle.
445.24s: So all I was doing was playing this broader continuation.
450.96s: And then as soon as it started reversing, as I was sliding up the stop, that's where I
456.04s: took my exit.
457.04s: It was literally as soon as it started meaningfully moving below these two candles in this
464.72s: consolidation zone.
466.72s: But that led to was exiting the arrow, oh my bad.
473.36s: The arrows in the wrong spot.
474.64s: The arrow should be on the red one.
476.88s: Let me fix that.
477.88s: All right, all right.
479.44s: It moved when I moved the box.
481.92s: But I took my exit there.
483.48s: So I sold to close the position at 2572.9, which led to a total move of 240.9 points,
492.24s: that equals P&L of about 12K.
494.88s: Not a ton of money.
496.80s: The cool part about this capital though is that in terms of idea research, execution,
503.96s: how much baby sitting it needed.
505.52s: And then the time that this money was made, it's insanely high, return on a
512.04s: vesic capital.
513.00s: And I'll give you a sense of what that is.
516.00s: It's a 10-ish percent move in less than two hours.
520.64s: If you roll that out to just be 10% in a day, it's like the annual, I mean,
526.36s: I can't even read you the number on annualized return.
528.48s: It's that big.
530.20s: The key thing here is that this trade was either going to be wrong,
534.40s: quickly, and lose a tiny bit of money, or it was going to be right,
540.60s: quickly, and make also not a ton of money.
544.12s: This move here in Russell wasn't that big.
546.68s: Like this total range is like a percent and a half.
549.36s: So it's not like I was going to make a ton of money here.
552.00s: But the way that I brute force it is with leverage.
555.28s: I used futures very purposely here because I didn't expect some sort of
559.44s: massive 5% move relative.
562.20s: I expected a modest one to 2% move, which were generally right in that
567.12s: range.
568.52s: After the original trade, it just became a function of manage the piano.
574.76s: Let the idea continue until it's invalidated.
578.84s: Anywhere in here would have been completely reasonable for me to manage.
582.80s: I was a little quick on the gun.
584.52s: I didn't choose to scale out or anything because the idea ran its course.
589.00s: I was trading around this very specific catalyst.
592.36s: Do you have any questions?
593.12s: Let me know.
594.12s: Be an outlier.
594.32s: See you later.
