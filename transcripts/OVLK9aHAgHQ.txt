0.00s: Let's start with the hot take.
1.64s: The perfect options trade is not about whether or not
6.48s: the trade itself makes money.
7.92s: I know.
8.72s: Actually, the annoying part here is some of the worst possible
12.96s: trades make money.
14.76s: So what is the perfect options trade?
16.60s: That's what we're going to talk about.
17.72s: So the thing to keep in mind is a good trade is not about luck.
22.12s: It's about precision.
23.60s: It's about timing.
25.04s: And we're going to talk about those two concepts along
28.12s: with how we structure a trade.
30.76s: What's up, everyone?
31.52s: Eric here.
32.04s: Welcome back to the outliers.
33.20s: Let's get right in.
33.92s: So we're going to talk about a few principles.
35.96s: Then I'm going to go through this thing.
37.20s: I call the big four trade process.
38.96s: And then I'm going to walk you through specific decisions
41.80s: that have to be made in order to ensure the perfect options
45.64s: trade is placed.
46.80s: So the very first principle I'm going to introduce you to
49.80s: is this idea of stacking strength.
51.96s: When we're looking for trades, it's common for us to see
55.80s: something that looks generally appealing and then to
58.92s: immediately try to figure out how to put a trade on in it.
61.84s: Let's take a look at an example.
63.20s: If we pop over to the platform, pop into a scan,
65.84s: let's take a look at this LIN.
67.76s: I'm looking for stocks that are near 52 week highs.
71.44s: That's all.
71.96s: And let's say we want to trade a bullish thesis for whatever reason.
75.44s: Do I like this for a bullish thesis?
78.52s: Well, if I look across the six month time frame, it's going up.
81.80s: That looks OK.
82.56s: And then if I look in on a three month time frame, it's going
85.36s: generally up.
86.20s: That's also OK.
87.12s: And if I look in on a 30 day, it starts to flatten out a little bit.
90.00s: Some of this is going to have to align with your timing,
92.40s: your trading window that you're pursuing.
94.68s: Well, let's take a look at something in comparison like XLC.
97.28s: If I want to trade something to the upside, this looks OK.
101.16s: It's definitely moving up.
103.32s: It doesn't have that big pullback like you're
105.64s: seeing in the LIN stock that we were just looking at.
109.04s: What I'm highlighting is we have to come up with multiple factors.
113.56s: So the idea of stacking strength is to look at multiple factors
119.80s: all together in conjunction, but not looking at one specific element
124.44s: and making a decision off of that one element.
127.00s: It's a common mistake.
127.88s: The other thing that we already discussed
130.60s: is that the perfect options trade is not outcome based.
133.48s: It's not whether or not you make money.
135.44s: The ultimate objective is to make money.
137.52s: But you have to remember, there will be some traders that are insanely lucky.
141.84s: And they have one trade that makes them a ton of money.
145.64s: And they're off to the races.
147.60s: They've made all their money.
148.64s: They're good.
149.20s: That's not the case for most people.
150.88s: There's a healthy dose of luck that leads to that style of outcome.
154.88s: So when we're looking at the path for most of us,
157.88s: is we're going to have to trade a lot.
159.16s: We're going to have to do it a lot over time.
161.48s: That's the idea of making sure that we're not so focused on the outcome
165.72s: of an individual trade so that we're breaking all our rules,
168.48s: doing things we know we shouldn't, like letting losers get too big,
171.36s: hoping that it turns around, taking winning trades down too fast,
174.16s: all these different kinds of things.
175.40s: And we focus on, are we putting on trades that follow our plan and our system?
181.80s: That's the objective.
182.88s: Now, that entire concept is predicated on having a system that you're confident in.
187.88s: Because one of the most common reasons for somebody to break a plan
190.96s: is that they don't trust the plan.
192.52s: Why would you follow a plan that you don't trust?
194.72s: Does it make any sense?
195.76s: So the work in trading is done in building a plan that you trust.
200.08s: That's where all the rigor goes.
201.56s: So if we have a plan that we trust and we understand that we're not so concerned
206.80s: about the outcome of any one individual trade because we trust the plan
211.16s: and over time it leads to profitable results,
213.64s: then it's easier to focus on this key principle of focusing on
217.48s: making sure that we're putting on trades that align with our plan
220.32s: and are not over emphasizing the outcome of any one individual trade.
225.28s: The last general principle is looking for nodes.
228.48s: I find traders in general, they go through this process
231.16s: and essentially they're trying to come up with different ways
234.12s: to make something make sense to put it on.
236.64s: I look at it in the inverse.
238.52s: I want to look for things that as I go through my screening criteria
242.48s: that there's no logical reason for me to not place the trade.
246.24s: I find a lot of traders are trying to find an excuse.
249.32s: Something is in this steep, sharp decline
251.84s: and they're like, well, it might turn around.
253.44s: I want to get in now or it might go lower.
256.00s: Who really knows?
257.16s: But the idea of trying to build a trade premise off of essentially
262.24s: confirmation bias, trying to see the things that you want to see
265.08s: for something to go up is a terrible, terrible habit.
267.84s: So I flip that on its head and I look for reasons to say no.
271.56s: And if there are too many reasons that lead me or that lead to no,
274.96s: then it's no trade. That's simple.
276.60s: Let's talk about the big four trade process.
278.60s: This is in a couple different videos,
280.00s: so I'm going to gloss over this quickly.
281.60s: But when we're placing the perfect options trade in my opinion,
285.28s: it follows this exact process.
287.04s: We're going to start by assessing portfolio fit.
289.64s: Is this something?
290.52s: Are we looking for something that fits a specific need for our portfolio?
294.56s: Do we need long delta, short delta, is do we need theta?
297.24s: Do we need more gamma?
298.32s: Whatever it is?
299.24s: Or are we simply looking for opportunities?
302.28s: This origin matters a lot because for example,
305.28s: if I'm looking for a trade, I need long delta
307.92s: is in my portfolio, but then I come across this really great short
311.72s: delta trade.
312.60s: It might look like a great trade, but if it doesn't fit the portfolio,
315.88s: it doesn't fit the portfolio.
317.20s: So this is the foundation for then looking
320.24s: and identifying things that makes sense.
322.24s: So the next part is clearly articulating the profit mechanism
326.96s: in the corresponding signals for that trade.
329.56s: So we're going through this process, we're trying to stack strength,
332.28s: we're not focused on the outcome too much,
334.72s: we're focused on the process, we're ready to look for nose,
337.32s: we're going through our portfolio and we find,
339.20s: eh, we don't really need anything,
340.80s: anything that looks really good to us looks good to us.
343.52s: So then we start scanning.
344.56s: We look for things that look appealing and we find something
348.08s: that catches our eye.
349.76s: For example, let's take a look at Redfin.
352.76s: Redfin's been going down, maybe this is a short thesis.
355.80s: We think that this is something that's going to go down.
357.60s: Well, depending on the time frame that we think it might go down,
360.44s: the very first thing I noticed is that on a three month standard deviation
363.88s: channel, it's actually upward sloping.
365.44s: That's not tremendously bearish to me.
367.56s: So then if I zoom in a little bit further, I go to 30 days,
370.76s: it's still upward sloping.
372.20s: So unless I'm looking to trade a really, really short term thesis,
376.20s: like this is a five day, five minute,
377.80s: all of a sudden it's definitely downward sloping.
380.16s: So if it's a really short term thesis, maybe it makes sense.
382.88s: But when I'm looking for technical analysis,
385.52s: I typically wanted to find the time frame I'm trying to trade and then look
389.08s: at one up, one down in terms of the aggregation period.
392.36s: So if I'm trading something that's super short term,
394.32s: like maybe a couple days, well, then sure,
396.40s: I can use the five day, 15 minute,
398.80s: then I could maybe use a shorter term time frame,
401.04s: a one day, five minute and see how the overall strength or weakness is shaping up.
405.76s: And then I can do something a little bit longer term a few weeks or a month
408.48s: and see how it looks in that period.
410.48s: So if we look at this 30 day period,
412.52s: it's the period that I'm looking to trade here is definitely negative sloping,
416.40s: but it's still within a broader uptrend.
418.28s: So that is a no.
419.76s: And it's an objective no in terms of alignment across all these different time frames.
424.40s: Does that mean that there's no trade potential?
426.04s: No, there still could be,
427.16s: but it's something I have to take into consideration as I evaluate this
430.64s: against other opportunities.
432.12s: The profit mechanism in that case is very, very clear.
434.56s: It's short term bearish direction.
437.64s: It's a continuation of a trend.
439.56s: So then understanding the profit mechanism in the signals
442.60s: allows me to do this next step, which is build the trade.
446.76s: I'm going to build a trade that makes sense off of these things.
449.76s: So for example, if I'm trading something that's bearish direction,
453.60s: it naturally funnels me into a couple strategies,
456.04s: maybe sure calls, long puts,
457.36s: and then depending on what I think the potential price activity
460.16s: looks like for that underlying.
461.64s: So for example, if we go back and let's say that I think that the potential here
465.76s: is there is potential for a massive move for whatever reason.
468.60s: Let's just say I think that to be the case.
470.08s: If I think that as the case and there's a massive move,
472.80s: well, then what I prefer short calls or long puts,
476.12s: I would prefer long puts because I have uncapped profit potential.
479.68s: So if you follow this kind of process,
481.76s: you're making sure everything is in alignment.
485.16s: And then the last step here is just to make sure that we have an after action review.
488.96s: This is where we look through and we already know that information and details
493.52s: we want to collect to make sure that we are following our plan,
497.56s: to make sure that the plan is good, to make sure that the plan makes sense.
500.52s: All of those get captured and tracked in the AAR.
503.88s: So what are the decisions that have to be made?
505.96s: Really simple. It's this list here.
507.60s: We run through all of these different key decisions
511.40s: as we're deciding what exactly the trade should behave
516.16s: in terms of our interaction with it over the lifecycle.
518.88s: And that's what leads to the perfect options trade.
522.60s: It's something that's completely aligned with our portfolio
525.28s: that we clearly articulate the profit mechanisms as signals
528.32s: that we build a trade based on a strategy that we have a plan for and tested
533.08s: and we know it works.
534.04s: And then we have a plan to integrate all of the data into an after action review
538.80s: so that we can track what worked well, what didn't work well
541.40s: and modify our systems as needed going forward.
544.20s: We're going to stack strength.
545.40s: We're not going to focus on the outcome of individual trades to heavily.
548.56s: We're not going to sit there and break all our rules to try to salvage an individual trade.
552.40s: We're going to look for nose and we're going to find opportunities
555.28s: that look so good that we can't say no.
557.64s: This is the perfect options trade in my view.
559.56s: This is not talking about a trade that just automatically goes your direction
562.76s: and looks beautiful the whole time.
564.00s: It's not about whether or not the trade makes money.
566.00s: It's about following a process that we know yields positive,
570.16s: expected return over time and continuing to do that.
573.20s: Be an outlier.
574.20s: See you all later.
