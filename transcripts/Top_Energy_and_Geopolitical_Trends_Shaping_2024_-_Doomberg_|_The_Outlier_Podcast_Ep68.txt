2.16s: what's up everyone welcome back to the
3.84s: outlier podcast I got doomberg here yet
6.40s: again we are going to talk about all
9.00s: things macroeconomic geopolitical and as
12.28s: we were talking about just for a few
13.52s: moments before we started the recording
15.04s: there is literally no shortage of things
17.24s: to talk about so before we dive in
19.16s: welcome back great to have you hey Eric
21.16s: great to be back with you I always enjoy
22.60s: our conversations and looking forward to
24.48s: another great one today I always have an
27.32s: opportunity like I was telling you right
28.80s: before we started to selfish learn a lot
31.28s: so I fully intend to take advantage of
33.16s: that the first thing I wanted to start
34.84s: with um I I don't know we don't have to
36.96s: go super far in the weeds depending on
39.24s: how you guys like to dance around the
40.40s: topics but did you catch the debate last
43.40s: night and was there anything in there
45.56s: that stuck out to you and then just for
47.00s: the listeners really quick we're
48.56s: recording right now on the 28th of June
51.12s: so there was a debate last night between
53.04s: Biden and Trump yeah look we haven't
55.64s: written about the presidential election
57.96s: directly we're not a political um
60.32s: newsletter although on various podcast
62.36s: appearances I have made the the case
65.32s: which I think is just an obvious
66.68s: statement of fact that Joe Biden is seen
68.68s: out and the man is not there um that's a
74.32s: shame for Joe Biden um and it's a
77.36s: scandal I think for the Democratic party
80.68s: and for the Cadre of ablers that have
85.12s: surrounded the president and have
87.24s: decided that they thought that they
89.12s: could trick the American people into
90.88s: thinking that a man who is obviously
92.60s: suffering from serious cognitive decline
96.92s: could not only be president but run for
99.08s: another four-year term and I think um
102.76s: you know um Epsilon Theory um Ben Hunt
107.00s: put out a great piece this morning which
109.36s: basically said that this was a a
111.76s: narrative shifting event um it was a
114.24s: watershed moment in US political history
117.36s: and look this is not a partisan
118.92s: statement
120.36s: like uh Joe
122.36s: Biden's mental
125.36s: decline even in the four years I mean
127.88s: the signs were there in 2020 but in the
130.56s: past year it's become
133.52s: undeniable and he is UN suited to be
136.80s: president of the United States
139.12s: it's if you disagree with that then
142.24s: that's like on you like you you could be
144.60s: a lifelong Dem and many lifelong
146.20s: Democrats were panicking last night
147.76s: based on the reporting that we've seen
150.00s: the commentary on CNN and MSNBC and you
152.72s: know I didn't watch the debate again
154.16s: we're not a political newsletter I'm far
155.72s: more interested in what's going on in
157.80s: the energy world but of course who is
159.52s: president of the United States impacts
161.76s: US Energy policy in a significant way
163.60s: and the US is the world's largest Energy
166.48s: gigap power and so the presidency of the
168.40s: United States of course matters to the
171.04s: work that we do but I I say this like as
174.48s: an outraged citizen like what who who do
177.00s: they think they were like this was
178.20s: obvious to you I assume long before last
180.20s: night that Joe Biden had is not fit to
183.76s: be president and like how is it that in
187.56s: 2024 it took a nationwide televised
191.52s: debate forget Nationwide worldwide
193.80s: televised debate for what has been
196.36s: obvious to anybody who's paying
197.68s: attention to suddenly become the thing
200.16s: that everybody already knows uh to put
202.20s: you know Ben Hunt's language on the
203.60s: situation and so I think it's very sad
206.28s: night um sad for the president um sad
210.28s: for the party sad for the country sad
212.52s: for the world what a joke I mean I
215.64s: there's no other way to describe it last
217.20s: night was a fiasco and the enablers who
220.64s: allowed it to happen ought to be ashamed
222.76s: of
224.48s: themselves now if I'm not mistaken the
227.08s: debate last night actually got shifted
229.88s: originally and I was seeing something
232.68s: and again I'm really not interested to
234.48s: go super far down the the political
236.24s: Rabbit Hole myself but there's a
239.08s: specific macroeconomic tie-in that I'm
242.08s: going to lead us to one of the the
245.40s: thesis I've seen floating around is that
247.48s: we the debate was shifted to potentially
251.56s: highlight Biden may or may not be
253.84s: suitable and to provide time for a
257.24s: replacement if the Democratic party
259.36s: wants to look for a replacement for him
261.92s: now from in macroeconomic view who are
267.08s: the people that you think can have the
270.32s: largest impact on the energy sector that
273.40s: would potentially replace him have you
275.24s: guys gone down that rabbit hole yet are
277.04s: you kind of waiting to see what happens
278.44s: first oh sure of course and we've seen
281.60s: those um I don't want to use the word
283.68s: conspiracy theory because I I don't like
285.32s: that phrase but I I I've seen those
288.52s: hypotheses which would
291.04s: explain why this debate was so early
293.32s: it's pretty rare to have presidential
295.04s: debates before the conventions um and it
299.80s: and it was odd that Biden insisted on
302.44s: having this debate or the people around
305.00s: Biden based on last night it's pretty
306.84s: clear you know who isn't isn't making
310.24s: you know various critical strategic
311.88s: decisions around the Biden campaign um
314.92s: so I I don't
316.64s: doubt and by the way the coordinated
319.24s: response from the sort of left part of
321.76s: the of the media uh sort of universally
325.04s: saying that Biden needs to step aside
327.36s: was was interesting although who could
330.04s: argue based on that performance that
332.08s: that isn't the the the the only logical
334.60s: conclusion that you could make now I'm
336.12s: seeing reports today that Biden has
338.36s: steadfastly insisted that he will remain
340.36s: on the ticket and absent you know
343.08s: intervention uh 25th amendment or
345.28s: whatever it is um there's no legal way
348.76s: for the Democrats to switch jockey at
351.68s: this point in the electoral process and
354.72s: if Biden insists that he will continue
357.12s: to run for president then um see I don't
361.48s: understand absent
363.48s: intervention um and sort of involuntary
368.04s: intervention uh how how anything happens
371.08s: and in fact I was um talking to a few
374.72s: friends you know we obviously everybody
376.08s: just group texting and so on um I don't
379.72s: know how it can be that you are unfit to
383.00s: run for president but you're still fit
384.96s: to be
386.24s: president and so if he's unfit to run
388.88s: for president doesn't he kind of have to
391.00s: resign and he's not going to want to
393.64s: resign and so he's going to run for
395.88s: president that was kind of my deductive
398.44s: reasoning at least as a hypothesis to
400.56s: sort of share with my group of friends
402.84s: as to how to Game Theory this out like
405.40s: how can you not be
407.32s: capable mentally of running for
410.20s: president but still be capable of being
412.24s: president I don't think anybody's
414.08s: thinking about that right now they're
415.44s: all just thinking about well he could
416.52s: just pull out of the race and you know
418.48s: they'll have an open convention not so
420.48s: fast he's still the commander-in-chief
422.44s: of the United States of America right
424.84s: like that's actually more important than
426.40s: running for president being president
428.24s: for the next seven eight months or
430.24s: whatever it is matters we're by the way
432.72s: we're in the cusp of World War I like if
435.68s: it ever were to matter it would be now
438.36s: so I I don't understand like the logic
440.24s: either he can run for president and
441.76s: based on last night I don't know how
444.28s: anybody absent blind partisans could
447.96s: agnostically observe what occurred last
449.88s: night and come to a conclusion that this
451.20s: man is prepared to be president and then
453.16s: leave him in office until
454.80s: January so like if he's not going to
457.16s: resign he's going to run how that I
458.72s: don't see the state in which he pulls
461.48s: back but stays president and I think
464.24s: because that is a constraint he I'd be
466.68s: shocked if he P like they may try to
468.08s: pull it off but if you again if you
470.80s: would like that that's why I think
472.96s: the team Biden whether it's Jill or
475.60s: whoever is making the decision you know
477.92s: behind the scenes um they know that if
480.28s: they don't run they can't stay
484.44s: president now to Steelman the same
487.92s: argument do you think that their focus
490.92s: on staying president would be so
494.80s: powerful that they would risk a higher
497.96s: probability of losing a democrat in
501.44s: office I think if there's anything that
503.72s: we have seen from these 80 plus
506.72s: something year old politicians is they
508.40s: never want to leave
510.64s: it's actually it's funny you bring up
513.12s: that point on the age because the other
514.92s: thing I was going to ask you about is
516.96s: again kind of tying it back to the
519.36s: evolution of
521.44s: energy to me it seems really interesting
523.84s: that we continue to have older Minds
527.20s: even because Trump's not young either so
530.24s: like we have a series of older people
533.36s: that are vying for presidency and I'm
536.20s: curious if that kind of just function of
540.24s: age and Paradigm that comes with that
542.60s: age has an impact on the way you view
546.48s: the next four years of energy as
549.12s: compared to what it could look like if
550.52s: somebody more I don't want to say
552.44s: progressive necessarily ex said has a
553.84s: bunch of different connotations but I
555.84s: guess more just uh temporal in terms of
558.04s: their views of energy and the evolution
559.52s: of energy do you think that the age
562.12s: bracket even that we're talking about
564.00s: has a pretty significant shaping
565.56s: function on what the energy P energy
568.20s: picture looks like for the four years I
570.40s: think the age bracket the the dominant
572.56s: feature of the age bracket is impossible
574.44s: for anybody who's been in Washington for
575.96s: that long to not be
577.20s: corrupt and so um you know in my ideal
581.76s: world and look I get that there's a
584.00s: whole half of the country that think
585.68s: Trump won the 2020 election I think it's
587.60s: important to acknowledge that um that
590.68s: there are important questions in this
592.48s: regard and many people hold strong views
594.48s: that the election in 2020 was not on the
596.64s: up and up and that if that's true and if
598.80s: you believe those things and I'm not
600.16s: saying that I do but I'm acknowledging
602.04s: that some people do and if they believe
603.48s: those things they think Trump deserves
605.60s: another shot and I think if you just
607.20s: look at the dominant way in which he run
610.44s: he he won the Republican nomination it's
612.52s: pretty clear that a fair number of
614.12s: Republican primary voters um must
616.24s: believe that because they sent him back
618.40s: to the ticket despite all of the baggage
620.84s: real invented fabricated or otherwise
622.92s: that the man undeniably has and so he's
625.76s: the Republican nominee and I think that
627.12s: needs to be respected now um in my ideal
630.48s: World which can't exist wouldn't exist
633.52s: we would have had a three-way race
635.40s: between Gavin Nome Ronda Santo and Joe
638.32s: Mansion as an independent and from an
640.76s: energy perspective they all have
642.40s: different views although even Gavin nuum
645.44s: has sort of come around to being
646.60s: pronuclear and I think he's just playing
648.20s: foot seed with the renewable movement in
649.68s: California because of political
651.04s: necessity and that if he were to be the
653.12s: selected candidate to to um replace Joe
656.52s: Biden that he would move to the center I
658.12s: mean he's I wouldn't estimate Gavin
659.96s: Newsome as a national political actor I
662.64s: think he's a very talented politician do
664.36s: I agree with more than 10% of what he
667.44s: proposes in California no but again as
670.40s: an agnostic Observer with no skin in the
672.40s: game I think he's a formidable political
674.56s: candidate and in fact there's a bit of a
676.96s: contrarian view that last night was bad
678.68s: for Trump because it makes it obvious
680.92s: that Biden needs to be replaced and his
682.84s: replacement can only do better um but a
685.28s: three-way race between Newsome u d
688.16s: Santos and Mansion would have done two
692.24s: very positive things for the country one
694.40s: it would have presented the country with
696.32s: a choice among sort of the next
698.84s: generation of political leaders I mean
701.00s: they're not the youngest crowd but
702.52s: they're certainly you know not uh in
705.60s: their 80s but also two all three of them
708.92s: can complete a sentence right and they
710.96s: have like well articulated informed
712.76s: views on important topics like energy
714.84s: and we could have had a civilized debate
717.76s: um and and give the people a set of
720.80s: three relatively talented Next
724.12s: Generation type um presidential
726.60s: candidates to choose from and we don't
729.12s: have that right now we have Trump who
732.40s: half the country believes should be
734.76s: president and half the country believe
736.04s: should be in jail and we have Biden who
738.76s: is basically I think a victim of elder
741.76s: abuse and how is this the
744.80s: choice um is is really
747.64s: befuddling yeah I sh I really share the
751.68s: same sentiment that you do in a lot of
754.24s: different ways you mentioned a little
757.00s: bit earlier and I wanted to ask you
758.72s: about this because the last time we
759.92s: spoke you you discussed this concept of
762.68s: World War III here you're talking about
764.52s: that were on the the cusp of it and then
767.36s: I think last time we were talking you
769.00s: were of the opinion that we we might be
770.92s: even a little bit further potentially it
772.40s: might have kind of already kicked off I
774.48s: would just love an update on that
775.76s: perspective and see if that's still your
778.48s: view if if there's new inputs that
781.60s: factor into your assessment of that cuz
783.52s: obviously for for me with a military
785.08s: background the concept of World War III
786.60s: is very scary it's scary too I hope yeah
789.88s: because you're a sane person who doesn't
791.28s: want to see you or your friends die um
793.92s: well in just a quick caveat off that as
796.24s: well the even as you look at the
798.12s: evolution of warfare from a practitioner
800.52s: standpoint it starts to get kind of
802.72s: terrifying everything that you see going
804.60s: on with Russia and Ukraine the
806.16s: capabilities of these drones the idea
808.64s: that you can have a infantry battalion
811.32s: out there that just gets swarmed by you
814.08s: know a few hundred drones that cost
816.04s: pretty cheap relative to what they are
817.68s: is terrifying yeah look look here here's
820.64s: I think we're way way way closer to
823.04s: World War I than is being reported in
824.76s: the west um I'm not sure if you saw this
826.72s: or know this but um last
829.08s: week um there was an attack's missile
832.32s: that appears to have been partially
834.76s: deflected and
836.72s: exploded and the cluster munitions
839.84s: at least some of them fell onto a beach
842.36s: where civilians were enjoying the sun in
845.00s: cha um which Russia claims to be part of
847.76s: Russia and Ukraine claims to be part of
849.32s: Ukraine and so it is contested territory
851.20s: to be fair um and Russia accused the US
855.36s: of directly being involved and I think
858.40s: it's pretty clear that those attacks
860.04s: missiles require us guidance systems and
862.44s: you know um drones to help pinpoint
864.72s: targeting and and so on and um an
867.32s: amazing thing happened that has been
869.72s: completely ignored by the Western media
872.48s: the Russian foreign Ministry summoned
875.72s: the US
876.96s: ambassador and said in their official
879.32s: readout that they told the US ambassador
882.24s: that they believe the US is now an
884.56s: official party to the conflict in
886.88s: Ukraine and that the US had helped
889.56s: Ukrainian leaders facilitate a war
892.28s: crime and that they should expect Swift
896.44s: retaliatory measures on the part of the
899.64s: Russians um when the Cuban Missile
903.36s: Crisis was unfolding and the world was
904.92s: on the edge of a nuclear exchange it was
908.00s: wall-to-wall coverage in the west how
910.72s: many people listening to this know what
912.88s: I just said would you
915.36s: guess yeah I would imagine the vast
917.36s: majority do not correct everybody in
920.12s: Russia knows it and in fact the feeling
924.52s: in Russia is that Putin is being too
926.16s: weak and too slow to respond to this
927.92s: event and that once again he is not
930.60s: being as Hardline as many in Russia
932.28s: would like him to be now there's this
933.92s: belief in the west that Russia is a
935.52s: one-man show I think that's a false
937.36s: belief um Putin has his own political
940.72s: constraints and by the way like if if
942.64s: there were to be a quote unquote regime
944.00s: change which many in the west would like
945.32s: to see in Russia I suspect that the
946.68s: person who replaces Putin would be
948.36s: harder line and would that would
949.92s: accelerate sleepwalking into the abyss
952.24s: as we seem to be doing so we have this
954.28s: situation we have reports of North
956.08s: Korean troops being sent to fight onside
959.32s: Russia and Ukraine um the Russians have
962.08s: warned that because the US is arming and
965.40s: the west and NATO are arming Ukraine
968.88s: with Advanced missile systems that they
970.52s: will do the same to enemies of the US in
974.00s: various proxies around the world North
975.40s: Korea would be on that list for example
977.12s: given the tensions with South Korea and
980.00s: US bases that are just over that border
982.20s: the houthis the Iranians pick your
985.04s: favorite um there's an important Iranian
987.60s: election happening today
989.88s: and depending on who wins um it looks
992.04s: like there might be a similar treaty
993.32s: signed between Iran and uh Russia that
996.56s: has recently been signed between North
998.24s: Korea and and Russia I wonder how many
1000.84s: people listening even know that um the
1003.32s: rest of the world knows it the rest of
1004.96s: the world sees it they're treating it
1006.48s: like World War II if you read the
1007.60s: Russian propaganda if you read the
1008.96s: Chinese propaganda they believe and talk
1011.32s: as though they were already in World War
1013.12s: II um and they are explicitly saying
1015.76s: they're fighting the US and NATO the
1018.08s: atlanticists as they would call um you
1021.16s: may think that's nonsense but but that's
1023.88s: not that's not what they're telling
1025.00s: their citizens and I think it's
1026.56s: important to know what's being told to
1028.56s: the citizens of our geopolitical
1029.96s: adversaries
1031.08s: look if the president of the United
1033.16s: States which is kind of funny to say
1035.76s: after our our first discussion honestly
1038.20s: believes that the US should declare war
1039.72s: against Russia over the dbas then we
1041.72s: should have a debate in Congress and
1043.00s: declare war and send our troops and
1044.32s: treasure over there and fight for it
1046.48s: this sleepwalking our way in and and
1048.92s: sort of partially doing things but
1050.60s: pretending as though we're not directly
1051.88s: involved is only escalating the
1053.44s: situation I would like for my Congress
1056.24s: person to cast a vote before my draft
1060.24s: eligible children are you know pulled up
1062.64s: and sent to war like that the US
1064.24s: Constitution was designed such that
1066.48s: Congress deed War right you need the
1069.16s: approval of Congress to go to war um we
1071.32s: are in a war with Russia Today I mean we
1073.36s: are in a direct kinetic conflict with
1075.40s: Russia Today a nuclear superpower and
1077.64s: they're warning us that nuclear arms are
1081.08s: not out of the question and that if we
1082.96s: don't pull back from the brink there
1084.40s: will be an escalation which could lead
1086.16s: to an
1088.16s: uncontrolled um explosion literally and
1092.68s: and that's fine if the president
1095.28s: believes that us should formally go to
1098.08s: war over the
1099.68s: dbass um then let's make the case let's
1102.64s: have the debate in Congress we're going
1104.80s: to end up in a war without having had
1107.12s: declared one because we kind of already
1108.88s: are and that's what's really amazing to
1110.64s: me like um we we blew up northstream 2
1114.20s: like we blew up the northstream
1115.28s: pipelines let's just call it like it is
1118.16s: we wanly destroyed a 10 or decillion
1122.08s: dollar energy infrastructure owned 50%
1125.20s: by the
1126.00s: Germans um and then pretended as though
1128.04s: we didn't do it and everybody is sort of
1129.52s: winking and smiling and saying we didn't
1130.92s: do we we blew up those we do we have
1134.20s: conclusive evidence of that I mean you
1135.88s: know how much evidence you need Eric I
1137.76s: mean the president said was going to do
1139.52s: it uh it happened um and magically all
1143.36s: of the intelligence agencies around the
1144.88s: world is like the immaculate destruction
1146.64s: nobody can quite pinpoint who did it
1148.32s: everybody knows who did it and I can
1149.44s: assure you Putin knows who did it xping
1152.20s: knows who did it the Iranians know who
1154.00s: did it uh we didn't I mean I think it's
1156.16s: pretty conclusive at this point um that
1158.48s: the US blew up nor if you look at um
1160.84s: Seymour hs's reporting on the matter and
1163.40s: the complete lack of the ability to
1164.96s: pinpoint who did this desly thing I
1167.24s: think the evidence is there um that that
1169.44s: we did it so just out of curiosity
1171.84s: though like obviously it's a super bold
1173.56s: claim and the evidence that you're
1175.64s: citing there is a lack of evidence to me
1177.96s: that isn't a conclusion like I get the
1181.40s: so Ju Just to be clear just to be clear
1183.28s: okay let let me give you the full
1184.20s: evidence um in the weeks before it
1186.16s: happened and when the war broke out Joe
1188.48s: Biden explicitly said at a press
1190.04s: conference that nordstream will not
1191.60s: happen and we will make sure that it
1192.88s: doesn't happen and when pressed as to
1195.36s: why that would be the case he
1197.36s: specifically said it won't happen Okay
1201.68s: suddenly the pipeline gets exploded and
1205.44s: um there's
1207.76s: reports um by reasonably credible people
1210.72s: that the US did it um the denials have
1213.52s: been relatively flaccid and in the end
1217.24s: if we had strong evidence that any other
1219.28s: actor was actually involved in this
1220.68s: don't you think we would have seen it by
1222.00s: now I think if there was I think if
1224.20s: there was evidence of another actor I
1225.64s: would agree with you but again like I
1227.20s: wouldn't at least just my personal
1229.16s: opinion and you guys are more more
1230.64s: informed than I am I just I don't
1232.84s: disagree with the inference you're
1234.32s: making I just think it's a leap to say
1236.96s: this conclusively happened look I mean I
1239.36s: just think at at some point you have to
1241.12s: decide that at least all the players
1242.92s: involved believe this to be true I think
1244.28s: it is conclusive that Russia believes us
1247.16s: below up the pipeline and you could draw
1248.60s: that conclusion by what Putin said to
1250.92s: Tucker Carlson in their
1252.80s: interview and if Putin believes it the
1255.04s: Chinese believe it and the Iranians
1256.68s: believe it and so we may as well just
1257.92s: assume we did
1259.32s: as the the you know in the scientific
1262.16s: method um the theory that that is
1264.96s: consistent with the evidence and is not
1266.56s: nullified is actually a real thing
1268.64s: that's how science works you propose a
1270.60s: hypothesis you test it against the
1272.48s: evidence if nothing nullifies it that
1274.88s: hypothesis becomes a theory and unless
1276.92s: and until there's definitive evidence
1278.36s: against that theory that is the
1279.96s: operating um Assumption of Science and
1282.20s: so I'm sort of coming at this from a
1283.80s: scientific perspective which is I've
1285.20s: been waiting for somebody to nullify the
1286.76s: hypothesis that the us up pipelines and
1289.44s: there is no evidence that we didn't and
1291.48s: the theory that we did fits all of the
1293.24s: observable data and so until somebody
1295.28s: comes up with a nullification of that I
1296.88s: think we need to operate under the
1298.04s: assumption that we did and so maybe I
1300.36s: was a little looser with my original
1302.44s: characterization of it when we first
1304.00s: went down that road but I think it
1305.08s: matters I think like everybody sort of
1308.36s: winks and smiles and knows that we did
1309.84s: it and certainly the Russians believe
1311.60s: that we did it and if we had any
1313.20s: evidence that anybody other than us did
1314.76s: it and certainly one of our adversaries
1316.28s: did it then we would be screaming that
1318.20s: evidence
1319.52s: um loud and high and we're not and so I
1322.08s: don't know I think it's a pretty safe
1323.12s: assumption for an analyst like you and I
1325.88s: to have as an axiom for for further game
1329.20s: planning yeah and I and I think it's a
1331.56s: fair logical thought process I think
1334.88s: like the the way that you assess it in
1336.92s: the The Logical flow no debates there I
1340.00s: but I think the only other thing to note
1341.84s: is who killed JFK I mean at some point
1345.44s: like I mean who did Kill JFK it's
1348.84s: actually defined to be unknowable which
1350.80s: is a probably a whole other podcast yeah
1353.32s: but that's and that's kind of the point
1354.84s: because I I also think it's really
1356.20s: dangerous to predicate a lot of the
1357.76s: thought process on like what Russia is
1359.80s: messaging or what Russia says to have
1362.60s: happened because if you listen to that
1363.96s: same Tucker cross and podcasts who I
1365.76s: actually think um Putin was very
1368.44s: articulate and I learned a lot about
1370.48s: their perspective but after a fair
1372.88s: amount of digging there's also a fair
1374.48s: number of inaccuracies that he very
1376.68s: right so all I'm saying that for people
1379.80s: listening I think it's important I think
1382.32s: it's completely okay to look at a breath
1384.32s: of evidence and to come up with a
1386.28s: hypothesis about it but when we move
1389.28s: into the realm of theory this is
1390.60s: something that's like repeatably tested
1392.72s: and observable with multiple tests that
1396.48s: yield the same result so right now the
1398.32s: primary tests are somebody said
1400.20s: something it blew up other people say
1402.16s: something that are all aligned with
1403.68s: their individual incentives just from
1406.48s: yeah from a skeptic standpoint want a
1408.76s: lie detector test and said do you think
1410.36s: the US blew up the pipeline I mean I
1411.88s: think you would probably have to say yes
1413.24s: at this point I my genuine answer is I I
1417.60s: genuinely don't know okay well my
1419.36s: genuine answer is I would say yes yeah
1421.60s: and that's fair and that's totally fair
1423.28s: yeah yeah and I and the only reason why
1425.64s: I like going down that thought process
1427.04s: anyways is because I really respect yeah
1429.52s: the way that you form a hypothesis and
1431.64s: the way that you guys look at these
1432.92s: different dots because I think it's good
1434.16s: for people to see different thought
1436.28s: processes and how you connect them so
1438.88s: that I think is really informative so
1440.64s: anyways thank you for diving into I
1442.08s: didn't deril us too far of course no I
1444.00s: enjoyed it and by the way like again if
1446.60s: credible evidence nullifies our current
1448.68s: working hypothesis I would call it a
1450.44s: theory um that the US did this we would
1452.96s: be the first to write it admit we're
1454.28s: wrong understand how we got it wrong and
1456.00s: try to learn from it so I mean we have a
1457.56s: philosophy that mistakes should be rare
1459.48s: admitted to corrected and learned from I
1461.60s: I if you told me I had to bet my
1463.48s: mortgage on who done it um I I think I
1467.40s: would I would
1469.28s: I would sleep pretty soundly on the B
1471.52s: that's that's a fun see that's different
1473.84s: than like who do you think me when I
1476.16s: think who do I think I go with my
1479.08s: genuine feeling but if that was you have
1481.52s: to pick somebody and bet on it that's a
1483.96s: different scenario I like that framing
1485.48s: better that's that's the Trader's
1487.24s: mindset right forces a decision yeah
1489.52s: well the cool part about a Trader's
1490.88s: mindset is I get to pass on anything
1492.64s: that I don't have a formed idea on I can
1495.04s: say that looks weird but then I just go
1497.72s: into something else but
1499.52s: anyways really really interesting so
1502.04s: going all the way back though to kind of
1503.56s: this escalation you were talking about
1505.28s: nordstream before I kind of derailed us
1507.40s: um and you were talking about this just
1510.92s: growing breadth of escalations and
1514.56s: tensions between Russia and us so going
1519.92s: back to this broader World War II
1521.68s: hypothesis I have to then preemptively
1524.44s: ask like do you still do you still view
1527.80s: mad
1528.84s: as a theory a working Theory or do you
1531.68s: think that that's potentially going by
1534.48s: the wayside here because you're talking
1536.00s: about nuclear escalation but to me
1538.52s: obviously then the next logical inject
1541.80s: there would be
1542.80s: mad yeah um so for those that aren't
1545.60s: familiar mad stands for mutually assured
1548.24s: destruction which was a core
1550.68s: foundational sort
1552.24s: of um this strategic ambiguity between
1556.40s: the two sides um allowed that to become
1560.24s: the foundation of day tant until you
1563.44s: know the Soviet Union fell apart um and
1566.52s: I think as perverse as it sounds it was
1569.32s: a system that worked rather well um as
1572.16s: evidenced by the fact that we have not
1574.88s: blown the planet up in a tactical
1577.00s: Nuclear exchange strategic nuclear
1579.12s: exchange
1581.72s: um I get the
1584.36s: feeling that the Russians are far more
1586.84s: serious about well look the war is on
1589.64s: Russia's doorstep not on our doorstep um
1593.24s: the ukrainians and the Russians have a
1594.88s: very long history ukrainians and the
1597.40s: Americans have far less of a history um
1601.08s: from the Russian perspective as
1602.68s: articulated by Putin and everyone else
1605.88s: in the sort of Russian sphere of
1607.92s: influence this in their mind is an
1610.56s: existential
1612.20s: struggle and the US certain leaders who
1615.92s: I find their comons to be rather
1617.76s: dangerous Reckless are saying things
1619.68s: like hey you know we can uh it's a great
1622.00s: return on investment because the
1623.36s: ukrainians are fighting the Russians and
1624.76s: we're weakening the Russians but no
1626.52s: American soldiers are involved and so on
1628.20s: and so on well to the Russians this
1630.00s: sounds all very rather cynical and um
1633.64s: you know we saw the Russian Navy sail to
1636.08s: Cuba this time and dance around a little
1638.52s: bit outside of Miami and who knows how
1640.24s: serious that was it didn't seem to make
1641.64s: much news here um but the what okay
1645.88s: let's take a step back Eric
1648.60s: why do we care about nuclear
1650.40s: proliferation um why do we have
1652.64s: international treaties and we have huge
1655.84s: you know diplomatic efforts to make sure
1657.88s: that countries don't become nuclear
1659.44s: Powers well the primary reason we care
1661.80s: about nuclear proliferation is once a
1664.20s: country obtains nuclear Powers you have
1666.08s: to treat them
1667.76s: differently they hold within their
1672.20s: capability the potential of doing
1677.04s: existential damage to the United States
1679.92s: the reason we don't want Iran to get the
1681.64s: bomb and the reason we don't want North
1683.00s: Korea to get the bomb it's because once
1684.60s: they do we have to treat them
1685.84s: differently Russia has the largest and
1688.20s: most sophisticated nuclear Arsenal on
1689.68s: the planet it's bigger than ours it's
1691.56s: more modern than
1692.84s: ours um there's no scenario where if we
1696.92s: escalate to a nuclear where we're going
1698.24s: to shoot all these things out of the sky
1699.68s: in my view I'm not a military expert I
1701.84s: think it's not certainly not a risk
1703.52s: worth taking right so like the
1709.20s: give you another example the dangerous
1710.56s: analogy that I see going around is that
1712.40s: this is akin to Chamberlain appeasing
1715.20s: Hitler in
1717.16s: 1939 Hitler didn't have nuclear weapons
1720.20s: neither did France neither did the UK
1722.84s: and if the three of those countries had
1724.88s: massive nuclear arsenals I suspect World
1727.32s: War II might have developed
1729.12s: differently right like this is not
1732.04s: Chamberlin you might think Putin is
1734.32s: Hitler but Putin is Hitler with the
1736.68s: world's largest nuclear Arsenal and if
1738.56s: Hitler had the world's largest nuclear
1740.48s: Arsenal I don't think that the war would
1743.08s: have been resolved
1745.24s: kinetically I just don't and that is a
1748.84s: really important thing that people in
1751.60s: the west I believe are being quite
1754.44s: flippant about the Russians are not
1756.72s: being flippant about it the messaging is
1758.92s: very clear this is existential to them
1761.56s: they have nuclear weapons for a reason
1763.20s: if NATO keeps interfering or
1764.76s: participates directly they are not
1766.36s: ruling out using nuclear weap weapons
1768.68s: why have them if you can never use them
1770.68s: we're launching uh we gave approval for
1773.40s: Ukraine to launch Western missiles into
1776.80s: sort of pre
1779.40s: 2014 Russian borders that that was a a
1782.20s: big no no for decades and we wouldn't
1784.40s: tolerate it imagine Russia was providing
1787.48s: missiles to Mexico and they were
1788.68s: launching them into Texas now look if
1790.96s: you're from Ukraine all this is very
1792.52s: enraging to you what I'm saying we don't
1794.80s: have a treaty with Ukraine they're not a
1796.20s: NATO member we might like ukrainians we
1798.80s: might think that Putin is acting in a
1800.76s: dastardly way but unless and until Putin
1803.64s: overtly attacks an article 5
1807.24s: country which then gets back to my ear
1809.76s: Point all fine and good let's declare
1811.76s: war but let's have the debate let's
1813.80s: present it to Congress let's decide as a
1815.80s: country that we're going to overtly
1817.84s: embark on a kinetic war with the nuclear
1819.88s: superpower over the
1822.04s: dbass and people say oh well if you if
1824.40s: you appease him there you're he's going
1825.92s: to roll on Poland and all great let's
1828.72s: have that debate like if we're going to
1830.36s: have a war with Russia to preemptively
1833.64s: defend uh Europe um then we need to have
1837.08s: that debate we're not having that that's
1838.68s: and look at might sound like I'm a
1839.96s: stickler for the rules but look we have
1842.48s: rules we have a constitution we have
1845.04s: Congress we have separation of powers
1847.24s: and like there's a process when Japan
1849.20s: attacked B Harbor what did Roosevelt do
1851.48s: he gave speech to Congress asking for a
1853.32s: declaration of war which Congress
1854.64s: dutifully did great that's the way it's
1857.12s: supposed to work
1858.84s: why aren't we doing that now we kind of
1860.88s: want to have it both ways like we're
1862.20s: going to send money over there but we're
1864.48s: going to do things that the other side
1866.00s: is openly telling us is the equivalent
1868.36s: of declaring war on them the the US
1870.68s: ambassador of Russia was summoned by the
1872.36s: Russian foreign Ministry and told that
1874.52s: there will be retaliation against US
1876.48s: military like that's a major thing we
1879.24s: ought to be discussing it I don't think
1881.04s: that's a partisan thing that doesn't
1882.32s: make us protin doesn't make us pro-
1884.40s: Russian it makes us pro-american like
1886.52s: what are we doing what are we doing last
1889.00s: night's debate is
1891.76s: is is the lens through which we watched
1894.92s: last night's debate is this
1896.76s: lens right like how could we like what
1900.40s: what what are what is Russia and China
1902.40s: and North Korea thinking when they watch
1903.92s: that
1905.16s: debate it's really I mean Eric we are
1907.40s: living in very historic times and it's
1909.96s: amazing to me you watch CBS ABC NBC News
1914.28s: CNN even Fox and nobody's talking about
1918.00s: what happened at the foreign Ministry in
1919.36s: Russia everyone in Russia is talking
1921.24s: about it why aren't we we're just going
1924.20s: to wake up one day and there's a carrier
1926.04s: sunk what do we do then it's not
1929.16s: impossible by the way so I I don't know
1932.00s: I I call me crazy I I I think before we
1935.32s: embark on a kinetic war with a nuclear
1937.24s: superpower we ought to at least have an
1939.08s: open honest public debate about the
1940.84s: risks and rewards and the consequences
1944.16s: of our
1946.12s: actions I think it's a fair point it's
1948.76s: one of those things that kind of
1951.48s: generally imagine a lot of those
1953.24s: conversations are happening but to your
1955.08s: point they're not known and out of
1959.08s: curiosity when you were talking
1960.88s: about um
1962.92s: that derailed missile over the beach I I
1966.24s: just Googled it out of curiosity to see
1968.12s: what would come up and I didn't see any
1971.48s: US news media and like the first 15
1974.84s: result yeah blackout
1978.48s: I I think it really elucidates your
1980.76s: point on where the conversation is
1982.56s: happening and where it's
1984.00s: not it's look I I actually what I
1987.04s: believe happened in that event is
1989.96s: Ukraine launched a series of attackman
1992.08s: missiles into CH into Chia at military
1995.36s: targets and Russian air defense system
1998.80s: either partially deflected or caused the
2000.36s: missile to deflect and unintentionally
2003.40s: exploded over civilian targets which
2004.96s: happens in War I happen to believe
2007.32s: that's what happen the Russians are
2009.24s: openly stating that this was a
2010.60s: deliberate Act of terrorism by the
2012.36s: Ukraine facilitated by the Americans now
2014.72s: I don't happen to believe that's
2016.32s: true I'd be shocked for example if us
2019.88s: were to allow attack's missiles to be
2021.96s: used in that way but that's what the
2024.80s: Russians are telling themselves and we
2026.44s: at lot we ought to at least know that
2029.72s: and Ponder what that means right um and
2032.80s: so I want to be very clear like I I I'm
2035.20s: not judging good guy bad guy I'm just
2038.00s: observing a developing situation that is
2040.60s: very ominous and then observing at the
2042.72s: same time as you just proved with your
2044.00s: Google search that nobody over here is
2045.76s: talking about it that's the part that
2047.32s: amazes me like Putin is Hitler Ukraine
2050.96s: is worthy of our treasure and troops and
2053.04s: our blood great like that those are
2055.40s: positions I could even be convinced on
2057.60s: but we're not having that debate we're
2059.64s: just sleepwalking into the
2062.44s: abyss yeah into your point I'm looking
2065.52s: at a article from the Moscow
2068.40s: times um and it says uh Russia's defense
2071.64s: Ministry said Wednesday and keev bore
2074.92s: responsibility for a deliberate missile
2077.16s: strike on Peaceful residents which it
2080.36s: said used US missile uh us supplied
2083.40s: missiles yeah that cannot be targeted
2086.44s: without us drone technology and
2089.20s: satellites and so on and I also saw that
2091.80s: he has apparently given the goahead to
2093.76s: shoot American drones out of the sky in
2096.12s: the Black Sea which the US would
2099.40s: say is an act of War because they're
2100.76s: flying in international waters and so
2102.68s: you could see the very clear steps in
2104.88s: the ladder of
2106.12s: escalation right like it's coming but
2108.92s: again the thing that's the most amazing
2110.88s: part to me is I would guess less than 2%
2112.84s: of the people listening to this podcast
2114.56s: know knew of anything that we're talking
2116.24s: about before
2117.76s: today that's the part that scares me yep
2121.96s: well and I think that's one of the
2123.00s: interesting components about just
2124.68s: general narratives as you're talking
2126.44s: about both from Russ perspective but
2128.60s: also the US perspective I think that's
2130.56s: the one of the difficult Parts when
2133.08s: trying to keep track with stuff like
2135.40s: this is you guys probably know better
2136.76s: than just about anybody is how intensive
2139.80s: it is to actually identify true
2142.52s: information from wherever media sources
2145.76s: surround you because this is something I
2148.68s: mean reading further on this article it
2150.80s: starts talking about a terrorist attack
2153.08s: and they're opening an
2154.44s: investigation so to your point very
2156.52s: clear narrative being told on their side
2159.24s: um yeah interesting well we wrote a
2162.00s: piece called mapping the war where we
2163.80s: addressed this issue like look
2165.24s: propaganda is thick all around the world
2168.16s: and um especially during times of War
2170.76s: right when um emotions get very high
2173.24s: look I don't know that many ukrainians I
2175.56s: don't know that many Russians I have no
2177.32s: particular
2178.68s: emotional um you know um uh tie to the
2183.56s: war I know war is terrible and I think
2185.32s: what's going on as we said in a piece
2186.80s: recently that I think like Russia
2188.28s: wanting bombing Ukrainian energy
2190.04s: infrastructure is an act war is is a war
2191.84s: crime sorry um but you know Wars are
2196.20s: basically nothing but the integral of
2197.92s: series of war crimes
2200.04s: um but just objectively I'd like to know
2202.80s: what's going on right and you can't know
2204.28s: what's going on by reading The Economist
2205.96s: or the New York Times and you can't know
2208.16s: what's going on by reading the Moscow
2210.20s: times um but there is a whole series of
2214.80s: pro-russian pro Ukrainian and and
2217.72s: mappers who are following the day-to-day
2219.32s: EDS and flows on the battlefield using
2221.40s: geolocations aided by Ai and satellite
2223.80s: data and you know um reporting on the
2226.60s: ground and and telegram channels and
2229.16s: Soldier social medias and all there the
2231.24s: information is leaking out of here so
2232.72s: you can see every day what's going on
2235.12s: and then you compare the reality of the
2237.64s: truth that you begin to assemble
2239.84s: correcting for various biases look bias
2242.40s: doesn't mean U not useful as long as you
2245.52s: understand what the bias is going in you
2247.88s: might assume duberg is biased towards
2249.40s: the fossil fuel industry and you read
2250.76s: our pieces accordingly of course that's
2252.96s: fine like that's normal everybody's
2254.80s: biased nobody's free from it um not the
2256.80s: least of it us but um once you get an
2259.96s: assemblance of what the truth actually
2261.84s: is and then you could observe how it's
2263.32s: being reported and then you see what
2264.88s: happens in the weeks ahead where the
2266.04s: early truth that you learned becomes
2268.36s: reality and and sort of conventional
2269.88s: wisdom at some point then you could
2271.48s: begin to trust certain sources and and
2274.24s: we've developed a Cadre of sources that
2276.64s: we used to follow the and we're only
2278.24s: following the war because of its impact
2279.56s: on the energy um sector and also the
2282.00s: potential that my you know my house
2284.60s: could get destroyed in a nuclear
2285.88s: Holocaust so that's kind of important to
2287.32s: me too um But like after a while you
2290.48s: begin to see like yeah like this paper
2292.60s: is nonsense like the the the economists
2295.60s: and the financial times are reporting
2297.04s: just does not reflect reality sometimes
2299.52s: and then when they actually do reflect
2300.80s: reality that's data too like oh why is
2302.40s: it okay to say that now right like
2305.12s: because again we're we're submitted to
2306.48s: propaganda and propaganda is is a
2308.24s: legitimate tactic of War like we had
2310.84s: huge propagandas in all the wars that we
2312.60s: fought and that's perfectly normal
2313.88s: that's perfectly sensible but as a
2314.96s: freethinking person as an analyst your
2317.56s: objective is to try to sort of cut
2318.96s: through that propaganda and find out
2320.12s: what the truth is to the extent that you
2321.60s: can and in many ways the internet has
2323.76s: made that easier and harder um there's
2327.28s: an enormous amount of signal and there's
2329.00s: just as much more noise and so the
2331.24s: ability to sort of separate the two um
2334.04s: is a skill worth
2336.32s: learning yeah yeah what a great point
2338.48s: and I'm glad that you walk through a
2339.64s: little bit about the process you use to
2342.92s: navigate that because I think that that
2345.04s: does become a a daily skill set for
2347.76s: people so thank you for kind of going
2350.40s: into that a little bit pivoting over
2352.64s: more now to the energy side I was
2355.00s: listening to a couple of your recent
2357.36s: conversations and pieces about
2360.96s: decarbonization and the path you think
2364.76s: we're
2366.00s: taking when you look out over the next
2369.52s: 18 to 24 months might be a little too
2372.28s: short term but starting there what's
2375.40s: your perception of the current road map
2378.64s: we're on and the potential impact
2381.44s: thereof so the world is not
2384.20s: decarbonizing um interesting thing
2386.44s: happened this week you know June 20th
2388.00s: was kind of like a holiday for us here
2389.52s: because the energy Institute released
2392.20s: its um statistical review of world
2395.32s: energy for 2024 which is encompassing of
2398.24s: data from the 70s all the way up to
2400.80s: 2023 and we learned some very
2402.72s: interesting things um one of the things
2405.48s: we learned is that the consumption of
2407.16s: oil set a new alltime record the
2409.72s: consumption of coal set a new alltime
2412.04s: record and the consumption of natural
2414.32s: gas basically tied a record from a
2416.12s: couple years ago but is sitting at an
2418.96s: all-time high and in
2421.68s: fact um this is a stat that will blow
2424.84s: people's
2425.84s: minds especially when measured against
2428.32s: the propaganda around Renewables that we
2430.60s: have been fed um the world added 7.5
2434.60s: exit jewels of fossil fuel energy in
2436.92s: 2023 compared to 2022 and only added
2441.04s: five exjws of renewable energy in 2023
2445.12s: versus 2022 in other words we added 50%
2448.76s: more fossil fuel energy than we did
2450.40s: renewable energy which is not something
2452.40s: you would conclude from reading The
2453.96s: Economist or the New York Times um why
2456.96s: is that
2458.00s: our long-held view is energy is life all
2461.44s: humans everywhere want a better life it
2464.20s: takes energy to improve your standard of
2465.80s: living therefore every molecule of
2469.12s: fossil fuels produced will be burned by
2471.40s: somebody somewhere and local
2472.80s: restrictions against such activities
2475.12s: only change who gets the benefit from it
2478.60s: um most of the Western
2481.00s: countries um well all of the European
2484.20s: countries in the European Union like
2485.64s: they none of them produce any meaningful
2487.04s: amount of fossil fuels so the I mean
2489.64s: Norway and the UK aren't in the EU and
2492.36s: they both produce a meaningful amount of
2494.12s: fossil fuels to be fair um but the the
2497.00s: balance of the EU produces no fossil
2499.56s: fuels therefore their behavior is
2501.04s: irrelevant to carbon emissions because
2502.80s: every molecular fossil fuels produce
2504.40s: will be burnt and since Europe doesn't
2506.88s: produce any they can't stop producing
2508.80s: and therefore they can't really Bend The
2510.08s: Arc of carbon emissions um Indonesia
2512.60s: China India Pakistan Brazil they're
2515.80s: going to develop um and and if we don't
2518.00s: burn oil they will take that oil at a
2520.60s: slightly lower price than would
2521.80s: otherwise be and burn it themselves and
2523.64s: they are and that's what we're seeing um
2525.44s: the world watched what Europe did and
2527.76s: stopped listening to what Europe says
2529.76s: when the energy crisis hit Europe and
2531.20s: they reverted back to the coal mines
2533.52s: with the speed and efficiency of the
2535.20s: evacuation of Dunkirk um and um and they
2538.60s: they took the appropriate lessons um and
2540.64s: so they're burning more coal they
2542.04s: burning more oil um natural gas is you
2545.96s: know and by the way even the US is like
2548.56s: a total hypocrite on this we produce 20%
2550.52s: of the world's oil and 25% of the
2551.92s: world's natural gas in 2023 um who are
2554.64s: we to tell the rest of the world you
2556.64s: know we know that demand is gated by
2558.64s: production and we're producing um and so
2561.80s: I think it's a farce I think the world
2563.36s: is not going to decarbonize we might
2565.56s: slow the rate of growth of the
2568.24s: consumption of fossil fuels but we're
2569.80s: not going to decline we're not going to
2571.60s: stop consuming fossil fuels there's
2574.76s: seven billion people that don't live in
2576.24s: the G7 that would like to have standards
2578.64s: of living that are comparable to the G7
2581.00s: and unless we're going to forcefully
2583.16s: stop their development which I don't
2584.48s: know how we could even do um they're
2587.08s: going to they're going to develop
2588.04s: they're going to burn more they're going
2589.24s: to use more nuclear they're going to
2590.88s: maybe install some wind turbines and
2592.28s: solar panels but if they do it's just
2593.48s: going to be additive it's not going to
2594.68s: displace any fossil fuels it might
2596.68s: displace look Ireland could cut its
2599.76s: emissions to zero and it would be a
2601.84s: measurement error like what Ireland does
2604.08s: what Germany does what France does
2606.80s: really is irrelevant what matters is
2608.72s: what China does and what India does and
2610.68s: what Pakistan does and what Brazil does
2613.80s: and they have been made it very clear
2616.16s: that they're not signing up for
2618.68s: preemptively stunting the development of
2621.36s: the standards of living in their country
2623.76s: in the name of climate change and so um
2626.84s: there will be no decarbonization you
2628.40s: could Mark that
2629.76s: down so what do you think about the
2634.04s: policies that we're seeing coming out
2636.48s: that obviously are messaging that
2638.84s: angle do you think that they're just
2642.56s: kind of positioning a statement more of
2645.92s: trying to Virtue signal almost or do you
2648.68s: think that there's any world where
2650.64s: eventually we get to a point where we do
2653.44s: try to Pivot away from fossil
2656.48s: fuels well there is no scenario where we
2658.64s: pivot away from fossil fuels I mean that
2660.04s: is in our view it's not going to happen
2662.92s: um and I think most of the people
2664.80s: involved who have only ever worked in
2666.24s: government or at a iiv believe what they
2668.28s: say like I just think they're wrong I
2671.12s: mean like I I think there's a core group
2673.84s: of Hardcore malthusians would like the
2675.32s: world to use less energy and and for the
2676.96s: world to have less people on it that's
2679.60s: nowhere near the majority I think the
2680.88s: majority of people were brainwashed in
2682.84s: school went to University work for
2686.00s: government or work in public affairs at
2688.28s: a BDC company where branding is all that
2690.36s: matters and they're not trained in
2691.64s: science and they haven't really thought
2693.44s: through the issues and they they believe
2695.04s: the nonsense that we can um create a
2697.96s: utopian World of Energy abundance with
2699.68s: just solar and
2701.08s: batteries um the grand perpetual motion
2704.48s: machine where battery materials
2706.56s: immaculately appear and don't need
2708.36s: diesel to mine them um and so on like
2711.96s: then you know vast majority of people
2714.84s: have no understanding how the grid works
2716.12s: the difference between base load and
2717.76s: intermittent um why you know
2721.40s: U inertia in the grid is being degraded
2724.28s: by the forced introduction of solar and
2726.24s: this is causing not just the reliability
2728.04s: but the quality of electricity to to
2730.24s: degrade and this is causing end
2732.08s: consumers to have serious problems uh in
2734.88s: their manufacturing and so on um there's
2737.16s: a the giant fallacy which we're
2738.96s: reporting on next um is that the grand
2742.64s: sort of uh conflation that occurs is
2745.84s: that we look at a temporary period of
2747.88s: the cost to produce solar when it's
2749.28s: really sunny and there's too much
2750.40s: electricity and we don't know what to do
2751.56s: with it and the price goes negative then
2753.08s: we can flate that with um the average
2756.24s: delivered cost to Consumers of
2757.80s: electricity and anywhere where solar is
2760.08s: not anywhere but in on average where
2762.16s: there's more solar prices go up solar is
2764.24s: not cheap it's expensive to incorporate
2766.20s: solar into existing grids and you can't
2768.68s: create a grid based on just solar and
2770.64s: batteries that is economical because
2772.16s: batteries are too expensive and the
2773.20s: materials don't exist and so we've
2775.08s: reached this point where we accept a
2777.24s: degradation of the grid so that we can
2779.24s: all sort of slap each other in the back
2780.96s: and pretend like we're doing something
2781.96s: to save the planet when in reality um
2785.08s: The Arc is very clear and I think one of
2787.08s: our predictions is that the energy
2788.64s: Institute will no longer produce this
2790.16s: data because it's too embarrassing to
2792.08s: the green energy transition and they'll
2793.64s: eventually either stop doing it or start
2795.44s: lying um because like it's a truly
2798.20s: embarrassing document for all the
2799.76s: trillions that we've wasted chasing
2801.72s: these energy
2803.00s: unicorns did you see that California is
2806.20s: exploring the idea of a mileage tax
2808.84s: versus a gas tax yeah they have to
2811.28s: because look EV EVS are great for
2813.20s: California by the way I lived in
2814.64s: California and I didn't drive more than
2816.44s: 100 miles I don't have e it's sunny
2819.60s: there all the time it's not winter
2821.04s: batteries don't do well in the winter um
2823.64s: you know but electricity is expensive in
2825.88s: California again we're just running some
2827.32s: analysis like California if there's one
2829.44s: place in the world where solar should
2830.32s: work as California right why enormous
2833.28s: amount of sun lots of land that people
2835.64s: don't live in um and the electricity
2838.92s: demand scales with the solar cycle in
2841.64s: other words because it's hot there most
2844.28s: of the time people run their air
2846.36s: conditioners day and less so at night
2848.52s: and that's when the sun is shining so it
2850.08s: should work in California right
2852.64s: California is the largest producer of
2854.88s: solar in the country as a percent of
2856.92s: their generation of electricity like 40%
2860.72s: plus or minus and they're the second
2863.32s: most
2864.20s: expensive place for electricity for
2866.24s: consumers like if solar were cheap why
2869.12s: are Californians paying the most for
2871.28s: electricity when they have the most
2872.92s: solar it's and that's where it should
2875.56s: work look solar can never work in Maine
2877.96s: because the energy needs in Maine in the
2880.04s: winter come at night when it's cold and
2881.72s: the sun isn't shining and so there are
2884.36s: certain spots of the country where an
2886.40s: electric vehicle and even some solar
2888.08s: makes sense potentially but like to say
2891.48s: that alaskans should be driving electric
2894.28s: vehicles is to admit that you have no
2896.72s: idea what you're talking about like
2899.40s: Canadians aren't going to be driving
2900.60s: electric vehicles in the dead of winter
2902.12s: in Alberta you kidding me it's not going
2904.12s: to happen it's just not going to happen
2906.84s: and by the way these are very large
2908.84s: states and provinces that people drive
2910.92s: long distances all the time and there's
2912.40s: just no substitute for diesel a Long
2914.64s: Haul truck oh maybe you could do some
2916.20s: hydrogen trucks and combustion and all
2917.68s: that stuff but um in reality it's not
2920.80s: going to happen and and the next piece
2924.00s: is tentatively titled no solar isn't
2926.40s: cheap and we're just going to give you
2928.36s: the three arguments you could use that
2929.80s: the holiday dinner table when that
2931.88s: annoying relative of yours struts their
2934.56s: green bonafides
2937.72s: when you think about the evolution of
2940.40s: solar do you think that there comes a
2942.48s: time where we could have enough storage
2946.84s: capability acknowledging that that uses
2949.52s: a lot of fossil fuel to produce and
2951.84s: maintain the storage capability but if
2954.24s: we do have the ability to build enough
2956.36s: storage capability that if we did set up
2959.32s: really large solar Farms that we could
2962.44s: offset a meaningful amount of fossil
2965.96s: fuel use
2967.24s: us so there's a couple of ways in which
2971.48s: it can work in theory and it's important
2975.20s: to acknowledge those because they
2976.80s: demonstrate what's possible and what's
2978.44s: not so Norway gets an enormous amount of
2983.20s: its electricity from
2985.00s: hydro and hydro is yeah they they are
2989.16s: probably the country that has perfected
2991.52s: their energy policy more than any other
2994.16s: um they have hydro a really green grid
2997.36s: they develop their oil resources for
2998.84s: export and they save the profits by
3000.96s: developing those resources for future
3002.44s: Generations in The Sovereign wealth Fund
3003.96s: in a very mature and uh conservative way
3008.28s: so um Norway has enormous hydro and one
3013.56s: of the things about Hydro it's
3015.40s: relatively easy to load follow and so
3018.76s: hydrogen damed or sorry hydroelectric
3021.80s: dams hydrogen dams hydroelectric dams
3024.40s: act as a giant battery you could keep
3027.12s: more water behind the dam or let a
3028.88s: little bit more water out as the es and
3031.44s: flows of the intermittency of
3033.40s: Renewables um demands so that could work
3037.76s: and to an extent it could work with some
3040.00s: of Norway's neighbors because they
3041.56s: export electricity but in a year of a
3043.76s: drought they wouldn't want to export
3044.92s: that electricity and they would put
3046.08s: their neighbors at risk if they were
3047.32s: depending on this giant battery now
3049.84s: that's one scenario where it could work
3051.76s: because that's a huge battery that
3053.64s: doesn't require materials having said
3055.56s: that um we're not going to go about
3058.16s: damning all of these rivers in North
3059.68s: America like we did it in in Quebec and
3061.76s: we killed Untold numbers of caribou and
3064.68s: displaced people and you know um spoiled
3068.56s: um you know indigenous lands on a scale
3070.64s: that would be impossible to imagine that
3072.12s: anybody in the US would sign up for
3073.44s: today so water storage behind a dam as a
3077.96s: battery enables a certain amount of
3080.84s: intermittent Renewables to be introduced
3082.52s: into the grid with minimal disruption
3084.68s: totally see that point in a world where
3087.44s: we make a meaningful dent on us for
3089.84s: example U we would need batteries um now
3094.00s: there has been some interesting
3094.96s: Technologies developed that could again
3097.32s: enable more Renewables which is thermal
3099.16s: batteries um which um take excess
3102.56s: electricity during times where it's
3103.68s: being overproduced and they store it in
3105.16s: the form of heat in a relatively
3106.44s: efficient way and Industry could use
3107.76s: heat so that is again an exception that
3110.96s: proves the rule it it shows you certain
3113.76s: narrow ways in which you don't have to
3116.32s: have expensive batteries with lithium
3119.48s: and you know all the other metals that
3121.20s: go in them that are nickel and Cobalt
3123.04s: and so on um where it there scenarios
3127.68s: where it could do okay and again in the
3130.12s: Sun Belt it's called the Sun Belt it
3132.12s: makes sense to have some solar in the
3133.60s: Sun Belt I think you could um load
3135.92s: follow a lot and your Bas load power
3137.68s: plants are less torqued around now if
3139.36s: you had a bunch of wind that complicates
3140.72s: things because the wind isn't as
3141.84s: predictable as the sun you know um but
3145.68s: there's room if you had to now I don't
3148.08s: think we have to because if we truly
3150.16s: cared about carbon emissions we just
3152.16s: buil nuclear plans um but we don't and
3155.76s: so is there a world where a certain
3157.60s: amount of solar isn't all that
3159.00s: disruptive and might even make a bit of
3160.92s: sense sure we're not absolutists um and
3163.96s: might that be politically worth doing
3165.76s: just to sort of appease the carbon
3168.08s: counters and move on and let industry do
3170.08s: its thing maybe um but I don't see a
3173.04s: scenario where well let's put this way
3175.12s: one of the things we've called for and
3176.16s: other have as well and I should give
3177.64s: credit to uh an outfit called The
3179.24s: Manhattan contrarian who writes a pretty
3181.12s: interesting and and provocative blog um
3183.92s: why don't we just build a city of
3185.12s: 100,000 people and run it just on solar
3187.12s: and batteries and wind and see how they
3188.40s: do like let's do that before we decide
3190.68s: we're going to put the whole country
3191.60s: down this path let's build a city and
3194.76s: design it to run on just
3196.88s: solar and batteries with no imports from
3200.64s: other regions like a standalone
3202.28s: experiment can a city of 100,000 people
3205.84s: in a reasonable part of the country that
3207.24s: gets good
3208.24s: Sun um run just on solar and batteries
3211.32s: and what would that cost and what would
3213.44s: the failure modes be and could industry
3216.08s: Thrive there like I think we should do
3217.52s: that it doesn't even need to be let's do
3218.72s: a 10,000 person City like let's run the
3221.20s: experiment before we do it on a 300
3223.04s: million person scale um why won't we do
3225.84s: that experiment I'd like to see it
3228.96s: hasn't been done
3231.84s: yet so when you think about then the
3235.36s: future of energy obviously very firmly
3239.28s: rooted in fossils fossil fuels I should
3243.24s: say if you were to think about the other
3247.80s: side of your
3249.04s: argument is there a point in time that
3252.52s: eventually you think fossil fuels are
3254.64s: outpaced by some sort of some sort of
3257.52s: other
3258.68s: energy uh
3261.04s: no I mean it to be as simple as as look
3264.76s: um all primary energy is added
3267.36s: and if you look at the percent of global
3269.36s: primary energy demand that has been
3271.00s: satisfied by fossil fuels is unchanged
3273.92s: right I I I put a chart together the
3275.52s: other day I haven't published it yet
3277.60s: which is the percent of primary energy
3279.52s: Satisfied by coal back to 1965 it's flat
3282.56s: line it's a flat line like we set coal
3286.08s: records and proportionately we're
3288.00s: getting 28% of our primary energy from
3290.40s: coal period we just are and we will if
3293.32s: you ask people that question right now
3295.32s: of course how many
3297.56s: the US is burning less coal right which
3300.84s: means it's cheaper by the Coal's a solid
3303.16s: put it on a cheap boat and you can send
3305.20s: it all over the world at at such a scale
3307.92s: that it cost nothing to ship it okay we
3310.48s: burn less coal in the US true so what
3314.84s: happens to that excess coal that is
3316.64s: produced the gating function of demand
3318.52s: for fossil fuels is production right um
3321.28s: who produces coal well the US produces
3322.80s: coal and still exports it which is again
3324.80s: not something that most people know um
3326.72s: Indonesia is a major coal producer um
3329.24s: China Australia Canada all of these
3332.16s: countries could start the Canada and the
3334.36s: US and Australia could put a meaningful
3337.20s: dent on co2 emissions from coal if they
3339.96s: outlawed production they did they
3342.16s: haven't it's a revenue generator it's a
3344.84s: jobs Creator and since they're not
3347.24s: burning it wink wink it's not really
3349.40s: their emissions well it is their
3351.20s: emissions because the gating function of
3352.92s: demand for fossil fuels is production
3355.20s: Canada the US in Australia could
3358.68s: meaningfully
3360.48s: Dent Global consumption of coal now what
3362.96s: would happen if we did that is we would
3364.60s: see
3365.44s: masturvation we would see grid down
3367.44s: scenarios in the developing world we
3369.48s: would see political upheaval we would
3371.60s: see a
3373.12s: Capac um so like we're not really
3376.80s: walking talk here right like the US is a
3379.68s: net export of coal we produce 20% of the
3382.44s: world's oil and 25% of the world's
3384.84s: natural gas and we have 90 nuclear
3387.20s: reactors and all kinds of solar and I
3389.28s: don't see people consuming less energy
3391.00s: because we're adding solar we're just
3392.76s: living Better Lives because everybody
3394.60s: everywh wants a better life so no I
3397.00s: don't think
3399.04s: again the environmentalists are so
3401.32s: opposed to nuclear that that's the only
3402.88s: technology that I think could really
3404.00s: meaningfully Dent things but even
3406.80s: then the world has an insatiable
3409.20s: appetite forage look at AI I mean we're
3412.16s: going to see major disruption to the
3414.00s: world's electricity grids in the West in
3416.68s: the coming years I
3418.40s: mean it's going to happen because of
3421.56s: demand like energy is life um AI it
3426.08s: radically improves some people's
3427.44s: standard of living certainly helps with
3429.68s: our work it's an amazing technology
3433.40s: um the the demand for that is like
3436.72s: saying like we're going to limit the
3437.84s: amount of
3439.48s: iPhones like it's not going to happen
3441.76s: like people are going to use Ai and um
3444.84s: entrepreneurs are going to figure out
3445.92s: ways to divert current energy resources
3448.36s: to serve that by offering a higher price
3451.12s: and that's going to price people out of
3452.28s: the market and that's just going to
3453.56s: create the demand for more energy so no
3455.52s: I I the global demand for fossil fuels
3459.00s: is an upward sloping line with a mild
3462.20s: sort of sinusal wave aspect to it grew
3464.72s: 1.5% last year off a very large base and
3468.44s: if you look at the slope of that line
3469.80s: it's roughly 1.5 to 2% a year for
3472.64s: decades and there's no evidence none
3476.92s: that that trend is going to change
3478.04s: anytime soon and anybody who claims it
3480.76s: has already done so or thinks it will is
3486.28s: dreaming I also think just from a
3488.96s: behavioral standpoint exactly as you're
3491.76s: highlighting it seems humans in general
3494.24s: expand to the space around them so to
3497.12s: your point the probability of us getting
3499.76s: to a point where we say okay you know
3502.20s: I'm good now with all of my energy use
3504.12s: I'll just Plateau here and stop so that
3506.16s: that we can slow down of course look we
3508.28s: wrote a piece called A Part a part of
3509.60s: the seams uh where we talked about how
3511.44s: the energy crisis in Europe might blow
3512.96s: the European Union apart um and we said
3516.96s: we said in the piece like it is
3520.04s: unpopular to force by dictate that
3524.16s: populations should voluntarily or
3526.20s: involuntarily lower their standards of
3527.80s: living in aggregate it's unpopular which
3530.48s: means the green energy transition is
3532.20s: fundamentally incompatible with
3533.80s: democracy because elections are
3535.56s: popularity contests it's in the term
3538.04s: populism populism is the crowd's
3541.52s: response to
3542.76s: unpopular laws and rules imposed upon
3546.56s: them by Central planners that's what
3548.48s: populism is now the media can say it's
3550.96s: far right and it has to do about an
3552.72s: immigration or pick your favorite you
3554.28s: know social issue I believe it has
3556.36s: everything to do with energy even
3557.44s: immigration is about energy if you have
3559.48s: a high degree of immigration then the
3561.12s: GDP per capita goes
3563.08s: down right um and so
3567.88s: like there's no way like what did Joe
3571.48s: Biden do at the first sign of elevated
3573.40s: gasoline prices in the US he emptied the
3574.96s: Strategic petroleum Reserve ahead of the
3576.32s: midterms this champion of the
3578.56s: environment emptied the Strategic
3580.44s: petroleum reserves which made gasoline
3582.40s: price is lower than they would have been
3584.00s: which meant demand was higher than it
3585.44s: would have been if he was willing to
3588.96s: lock the talk he would have embraced $10
3591.92s: a gallon gasoline because in in some
3594.88s: people's minds that would have acceler
3596.16s: at the shift to electric vehicles um he
3599.00s: didn't he emptied the Strategic prol
3600.84s: reserve for political reasons and he was
3604.40s: correct to do so as measured by the
3606.88s: political outcome of the 2022 midterms
3609.80s: right I mean if gasoline was $6 a gallon
3612.88s: heading into October of 2022 the
3615.16s: Republicans would be in charge of the
3617.32s: Senate and the house by wide margins um
3619.92s: he emptied the Strategic petroleum
3621.20s: Reserve cut the price of oil in half
3623.80s: brought the price of gasoline to $3 a
3626.68s: gallon Nationwide which is politically
3628.84s: important and palatable and um the
3631.48s: Democrats outperformed in the midterms I
3634.88s: I think there's a straight line and that
3636.56s: straight line that that example proves
3638.96s: what will happen for example there's a
3641.76s: giant Shale field in California called
3644.52s: the Monteray Shale that nobody knows
3646.72s: about and people don't even really know
3649.32s: how much is there because nobody's
3650.40s: looking because everyone just assumes
3652.60s: you can't really do that in California
3655.00s: at $300 a barrel oil we could do that in
3657.68s: California the pressure to do so will be
3661.04s: uh very very high
3664.16s: so
3666.04s: ultimately the inelasticity of demand
3668.36s: for life is
3669.92s: infinite and energy is life and all
3673.12s: humans everywhere want a higher standard
3674.60s: of living even those of us in the US
3677.36s: that are living a comparatively piggish
3679.20s: lifestyle compared to the six or seven
3681.56s: billion people that are struggling to
3682.76s: make in Meet every day um I think the
3686.40s: BTU per capita use in the US is is
3689.12s: number you amongst the large countries
3691.28s: number one by a wide margin there's a
3692.64s: few small countries that U out consume
3695.48s: us on a per capita basis but
3697.40s: meaningfully we
3698.72s: are between four to 10 times um bigger
3703.04s: energy Hogs than the the average
3706.44s: developing country in the global South
3708.24s: are we going to give that
3710.36s: up
3713.00s: no so I don't know seems like
3717.08s: an awful lot of
3719.92s: um wasted time effort and money to get
3722.68s: to the answer that it's obvious and
3724.24s: dictated by
3726.20s: physics it almost goes back to that
3728.12s: conversation we were having earlier
3729.80s: about going to multiple sources to sort
3734.12s: out the truth right because the
3735.80s: messaging you hear especially I'm in
3737.40s: California so especially the messaging
3739.44s: you hear here is all about how do we
3743.28s: decrease energy use and we're going
3745.20s: green and all that stuff but exactly as
3748.52s: you lay out your case there it's very
3751.04s: clear that there are lots of instances
3753.32s: where people are having a dialogue about
3755.44s: something esoteric and then what we're
3758.64s: doing is what we're doing so you kind of
3761.72s: have to collect data from different
3763.60s: sources to actually see what's going on
3766.12s: yeah I agree look in California is a
3767.84s: unique case for a lot of reasons um you
3771.72s: know blessed with a disproportionate
3774.72s: amount of sort of tech technology
3776.20s: development Silicon Valley and a good
3777.84s: tax base and so on um and an amazing set
3781.20s: of resources but you know California as
3783.96s: we said in our piece here recently um
3787.28s: California has like similar energy
3789.00s: reserves oil and gas reserves to Texas
3791.84s: Texas is a global energy superpower and
3793.72s: California is a flaccid energy vassel
3796.08s: this is political choices right and
3798.80s: California benefits from
3800.60s: Texas um directly and
3803.04s: indirectly because Texas keeps
3806.16s: the perum Basin is keeping a lid on
3809.04s: global and National Energy prices um oil
3813.04s: being the former and and natural gas
3814.52s: being a glut in the US um as the latter
3817.48s: um that's not anything California's done
3820.20s: but The Californians benefit from that
3822.68s: which fine Texans benefit too because
3824.76s: they make more money than they would if
3825.96s: California was developing their
3827.08s: resources at the same rate um but
3829.36s: California the only difference between
3830.88s: California and Texas is politics right
3832.72s: and so um it's certainly not geology
3839.48s: we're about at time here but last
3842.40s: question I want to grow by you is
3845.08s: looking at the tail half of this year
3848.44s: what are you keeping your eyes on what's
3849.96s: most interesting to you I think the
3852.28s: outcome of the November election has to
3854.28s: be top of mine and I think whether or
3857.72s: not things escalate in Ukraine or the
3860.00s: Middle East or China also has to be top
3862.88s: of mine and that's one of our concerns
3864.32s: after watching last night that last
3865.84s: night did not make such prospects less
3868.76s: likely I believe they made them more
3870.28s: likely so both of those events are what
3872.80s: we would call sort of singularities
3874.20s: where the laws of physics or the laws of
3875.64s: Economics break down it's very difficult
3877.08s: to model what comes on the other side of
3879.04s: that um if the US election is hotly
3881.52s: contested in both sides or half the
3884.00s: country believes the other side stole it
3886.40s: um that is a risk there's succession
3889.12s: risk in the US like that us is in a very
3891.92s: bad spot like the Democracy situation in
3894.20s: the US is troubling
3896.16s: um the disparity between the bloat in
