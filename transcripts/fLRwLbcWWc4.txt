0.00s: Hi guys, welcome. We're here with another chat with traders. I'm here with Eric from the ES Invest channel and I will link his channel in the pin comment and also in the description.
14.00s: For people on Eric's channel, my name is David Jaffe and I'm with Best Lock Strategy. I want to go over and we're going to discuss options trading and our mutual experience and common mistakes and things in that nature. This is going to be a very valuable chat.
32.00s: So kindly wash until the end and leave a comment below and let us know any questions that you have and any valuable feedback. I think it will be worthwhile if we started with our backgrounds and Eric if you could also introduce yourself, your channel as I did quickly previously, but introduce like your channel and also your background and then I'll do the same afterwards.
56.00s: Yeah, for sure. This one's awesome. So first off, thanks for putting this together. I really enjoy these kind of conversations. They're always fun to me to explore different approaches and different ideas. So I appreciate you kind of starting the dialogue there, but yeah, my name is Eric. I am 16 year retail trader. I started back in 2007 when I was in high school. Like most people that started trading. I grew up super poor. I had a single mom and I was working a bunch of odd jobs split wood.
85.00s: Worked at a bowling alley, all that kind of stuff like most of us do. And I had a teacher in high school that saw that I was working a lot and he was asking what I was doing with my money because he knew my background. He knew my brother.
96.00s: And I essentially just almost have a saving like I didn't know what else to do. He's like, you need to look into investing and that that literally that one sentence sent me down a completely different life trajectory.
109.00s: So I started learning about investing. I went up to the library, you know, first read books. Then I started checking out on the computer. And long story short, I came across options after I traded equities for a little bit. And I saw some early success of super fortunate.
125.00s: And I started realizing like, oh, like this can actually make a difference for me. And I kind of kept at it. So even when I went to my undergrad, which was very statistics heavy. I started integrating a lot of that.
139.00s: You know what I was doing. And then even when I was on active duty in the Marines, I was in Marine officer for six and a half years. I kept trading. I just kind of kept modifying what I was doing and during that time frame, I came across a retired army guy online actually.
154.00s: That became like a huge mentor of mine. He never asked for anything. He never sold me anything. We didn't care. He literally was just helping me. And it's because I was taking the time to probe him. I was taking the time to learn. And he was willing to facilitate that.
167.00s: So, you know, fast forward. Now I'm 32 and I'm super fortunate. The kind of life that I'm able to live. I pay for my mom's house. I pay for expenses. And this all came from essentially two different people in my life sending me down a very specific path. So that's part of the reason why I like doing these so much because I think the idea of just promulgating good authentic information for people and not asking them for anything is massive because you never know what will click for them. So yeah, let's just quick back on on me. And then the YouTube channel. I started to get a lot of things.
196.00s: YouTube channel. I started that back during COVID. On the same exact line because I don't belong on a camera. I have a face only a mother can love. I'd not good at anything. Like I'm not good at any of this.
208.00s: But I felt compelled because I had people that helped me anyways. So long story short, all of my marine friends. They were stuck at home. They weren't going on to base because of COVID. So I always talk about impactful things to my life to try to help share information.
225.00s: And I found myself doing these phone calls with my friends about finance. And I was just saying the same shit over and over again. I was like, you got to have an emergency fund. What's an emergency funds, you know, six to 12 months of expenses that.
237.00s: Anyways, I made a couple videos and I said here, watch this video so that when we talk on the phone, it's more productive for everybody, right?
245.00s: So you're not repeating everything exactly. It's not it's not a good use of anybody's time. And then the video started randomly getting views. And I was like, this is super weird.
255.00s: Because it was like recorded from a laptop. I think I was wearing a tank top like, you know, it's just going for it. And the channel is kind of slowly been grown ever since. And I'm here for it. I don't really have any specific objectives for the channel.
269.00s: Although I like to get better at things. And I like to think that I've gotten far better at this than when I started. I can't help but want to improve. But overall, my main objective is share information. So yeah, that's where I'm coming from.
281.00s: One thing that you said that I wanted to probe a little bit. You mentioned that you grew up very poor. What do you think is the determining factor between.
291.00s: I believe that like mindset and also work ethic is extremely vital between climbing up the social hierarchy and not feeling like you're a victim because you grew up poor.
301.00s: And still having faith in the system that if you worked hard that opportunity, you have value to provide other people, then opportunities will be provided for you. However, for my experience, I didn't grow up poor, but I actually grew up in a very poor area in Monticello, New York and the cascals.
317.00s: And I'm trapped in Newberg. You're from where? Newberg, New York. So I'm from the Hudson Valley. I'm literally.
323.00s: I used to have a girlfriend. Okay. So I met a girl. Her name is Danielle in Piquipsy at like a nightclub. And then I used to I used to go to Newberg.
335.00s: Like on the waterfront and she had like a jewelry store there. Her parents there. So I used to. So I used to actually like date her and I would drive like 40 minutes there. So it's a lot of the.
345.00s: It's weird that you said Newberg is some of the gangs from Newberg have actually migrated to Monticello. And now the high school is like significantly like more more dangerous than it used to be.
355.00s: But yeah, so that's actually very, very ironic. So what do you and I remember like the new we used to play soccer for like Newberg against Newberg free academy and they would destroy us like you guys were amazing at soccer like NFA.
368.00s: That's where I'm going to be. Yeah, I actually didn't even know that you were the U.N. to Newberg. That's very, very. Yeah, that's interesting. So I guess it's even like more relevant like how what do you think separated you because I think both of us know like a lot of people who.
383.00s: They didn't grow up wealthy, but they also had a lot of potential. You know like just they were very smart. If they studied at all they would have gotten a's they might have didn't they might have done naturally well on their SATs.
396.00s: But they still felt like a little bit angry at the world that you know they grew up like disadvantaged or maybe they didn't have like the best clothes or maybe they were picked on a little bit during high school.
406.00s: Why do you think you have like a positive mindset and you've been able to to overcome like you're like where you grew up and growing up for to become the person that you are now.
418.00s: I think it's two things. It's a great question too because it obviously causes a lot of self reflection, but I think the first part is I've never really allowed myself to resign myself to circumstance.
431.00s: And it's because I can't control circumstance. I'm a big believer in stoicism. I'm a huge practice around it.
437.00s: So I think as a kid my objective was to do as good as I can no matter what.
442.00s: And whatever happens will happen. I will be able to look at myself and say like I did my best and I actually that was one of the things that was super fortunate early on is I got around a good crowd even an NFA which was a pretty I walked through metal detectors every day.
457.00s: It's not a good school. And but I got into all honors classes and it's because like I just wanted to do well.
465.00s: And then it's this kind of innate drive to perform. I am obsessed with performance. So I think that's the first thing.
472.00s: And then I think the second thing was good mentors. People that at a young age because I had a dad like I knew him. He was an alcoholic.
480.00s: He died pretty early, but he wasn't like the worst guy, but he also wasn't like a giant mentor of mine. He did mentor me not to you know take credit away from him.
491.00s: But one of the beautiful things about growing up with a single mom is that whole idea of like it takes a village is exactly what happened.
500.00s: My neighbors knew I didn't have a dad. So my neighbor across the street taught me how to snow blow in the winter.
505.00s: Then my uncle taught me how to work on cars long story short. The ideas as all of these people understood my circumstance.
512.00s: They helped me. They helped me out of literally the goodness of their hearts.
517.00s: And I think that that I school mentor of mine I call my stepdad now. He's one he's like I'm so close with him because he changed my whole life.
526.00s: And then that other mentor. So I think those are the two things. I think the first one is kind of worrying about what I can control and focusing on my own performance so that I can look myself in the mirror and say like I'm confident and comfortable with what I did here.
540.00s: And then the second thing is being receptive to input and having mentors that we're willing to provide input. I think those are the two main things.
549.00s: I also mentioned stoicism which I think is incredibly important. I I love the quotation from stoicism, you know like Marcus Aurelius and I also subscribe to a bunch of YouTube channels.
559.00s: In a way it's like it's a little bit negative because you're kind of like pondering like sometimes you're meditating upon your ultimate demise.
568.00s: And then you realize that like everything that we do here is not super important. So in a way it kind of brings peace to you when you think that something is so vital.
576.00s: But one quotation that I mentioned that I was talking about earlier is do what you can with what you have where you are.
584.00s: And I think that that's something that's incredibly important because it puts you kind of similar to like what Eckhart told me say about like the power of now.
592.00s: Like with where you are right now do your best with everything you have like with all the information that you have at this specific moment.
601.00s: I do what you can with what you have where you are. So essentially you know do your best at this specific moment and it kind of brings peace.
609.00s: And as long as you do that and you give 100% then you don't necessarily have to be outcome dependent because you did your best based upon the information that you had available at that specific moment when you made the decision.
621.00s: I literally love that like I literally love that and I think that you highlight another really important part which is you know the idea of what the information that you have at that point in time because I look back and a lot of the ways that I've been able to navigate is been due to information injections from people exactly to your point.
640.00s: If that didn't happen who I literally have no idea where I would have landed like I wouldn't have gone to college because that same mentors the one who encouraged me to apply for a Marine Corps scholarship.
651.00s: But wouldn't have gone that route I probably would have enlisted which would have been the best thing I could have done to be honest.
656.00s: I think for people that grow up in slightly maybe disadvantaged positions going through the military is one of the best possible things you can do in my opinion because it gives you a great structure.
667.00s: I've always liked structure but it gives you like a really great network to immediately tap into and completely change your circumstance which is funny so you're from Monticello.
678.00s: Yeah, I obviously would love to hear about your background a little bit.
682.00s: Yeah, so my my dad was a doctor and then he was an I he was an eye doctor in Monticello and then my uncle was actually an eye doctor in Goshen which is actually like closer to you.
693.00s: Yeah, like near like the gallery across the run and so I I was in honors classes but the classes like our school was so bad that the teachers were almost expected to give us a so frequently like during junior and senior high school.
709.00s: I would skip class and then go like bowling or like go to Walmart and things like that and as long as I didn't get in trouble then the teachers would still give us a and I did well in my SATs.
721.00s: I did I did go to a good school and I think that the SATs they they allowed me to get into Cornell but the ironic thing is that even though my high school was so bad I I was so far behind all like majority of the other kids at Cornell but even though my high school was bad it only took me one semester to catch up.
743.00s: So basically I was behind for about three to four months and then I was on par after that first semester and a little bit of hard work with all the kids who went to like private school or all the kids who went to amazing schools and like Westchester or Long Island.
759.00s: So I think the takeaway is that as long as you maintain a good attitude and you're willing to put the work in even if you go to like a relatively bad high school like Monticello or you know I don't want to like label it but it's not like Monticello wasn't like the best school just like NFA it doesn't have like a reputation for academic excellence when you compare it to like Westchester or Long Island but if you are currently going through that situation as long as you put the work in.
787.00s: And then you will definitely catch up with all of the other kids who might have had a more vantage background.
793.00s: So I worked really hard in Cornell. I was just I've always been like very competitive and I was very fortunate to get an investment banking job at intern at Morgan Stanley and then I actually finished you know I finished all my coursework at Cornell in three and a half years because I took summer classes at both Salt and County Community College and also at Pop.
814.00s: And it allowed me to graduate in three and a half years. I then worked at CIBC World Markets in their industrial work and services and investment banking and I don't know why anyone will go into investment banking.
827.00s: It's just like it's such a horrible experience like they treat you so they just burn you out like you would work until two o'clock in the morning and then you're expected to be in the office at 930.
839.00s: But much worse than that they treat you so horribly like you're less than human and yes like you are making really good money and it definitely depends what group you're in.
849.00s: But my first group at CIBC World Markets was really really bad and I was thinking about quitting investment banking but then I switched groups and I eventually did banking for about four to five years and then I was simultaneously working in nightlife as a promoter.
867.00s: And I was always interested in the stock market and probably similar to yourself I gravitated towards like trying to learn technical analysis and day trading which I was never successful at and then you know I was just I realized that option selling options gives you a statistical edge.
885.00s: So then I started trading options and then over time I started learning how to like manage and eliminate the tail risk because even though you can win like 95% of your trades that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be profitable if you fall into or if you're unlucky enough to you don't get hit with like a black spawn event like December 2018 February 2018 March 2020 etc.
911.00s: So yeah.
914.00s: I do have a question for you with something that I spent a lot of time thinking about and talking with my wife about it's just fascinating to me you brought up you know kind of your experience in high school and how you would like skip school sometimes and like go bowling and stuff like that.
929.00s: Why do you think it seems to be in this might be a little myopic of me but it does seem to be a lot of instances where people who seemingly have a better starting point they have like their own sets of friction points that are difficult for them to like overcome like if I look back at my experience I would say okay like I went to NFA not a good school I should have you know essentially done the same thing whatever the cases but I went on another path but I was going to do it.
958.00s: I went on another path but can tell you how many times I come across people who seem to have these really advantageous backgrounds whether it's affluent parents go to a decent school whatever it is and then they still have like their own series of struggles to me it almost seems like if you grow up in an advantage scenario that comes with its own disadvantages is that like something you've come across or I always think about that to try to understand it.
983.00s: I think that I can talk about like for myself and then I can also speak about like things that I've noticed especially like a Cornell where there were people who had a lot more money than me.
994.00s: I think for me I've always kind of been like someone who kind of walks on the line but sometimes I could like potentially step over it and I think that as I got older then I pull back like I'm married I have children and my wife is like really good she's like the type of person where if she goes to Whole Foods
1012.00s: and then my daughter like puts something under the carriage and she doesn't see it she'll like freak out and then go back to the cashier and say she'll like drive back to Whole Foods and say hey you didn't charge me for this.
1022.00s: So I think it's just basically like in my own makeup where I kind of I wouldn't necessarily say like I'm like a Rick James like habitual line stepper but in the past like you know especially in high school I would kind of like push the envelope and see like what I could get away with just because I was always interested
1041.00s: in like you know analyzing like people's reactions and things of that nature. So I think that from that perspective at least for me I just I've always been the type of person especially when I was younger who was overly optimistic and thought okay like yeah I'll do that and I'll take the chance because things will work out but as I've gotten older I realized that we're lying upon luck and doing stupid things is a really bad strategy
1069.00s: and I've significantly cut back on and curved my wrist seeking behavior as far as like other people I do think that if you if you are born with a lot of things in your parents or you know you're you're or whether you have one parent or both if they give you things and they don't make you work for it then you kind of you you don't necessarily recognize how much sacrifice is required in order to earn a lot of money
1098.00s: and if you're giving things then without having to build up that strong work ethic then I think that could be very detrimental to people in the future and I also think that a lot of it has to do with luck I mean you have very brilliant people who have strong work ethics and then they like hurt their knee playing basketball then they go in for routine surgery they get addicted to opioids and then they completely destroys their lives so let's not disregard the the use of the ability to do it.
1128.00s: I think that's the luck aspect that that that we're in right now like currently like there are multiple paths that I could have gone under where you know I might not be here right now and I'm sure the same thing for you where you might have done some things in your past where you know maybe you were driving too fast or you know you could have like gotten into car accident or something like that like luck plays a big part but you know I think for me personally I've always been a little bit of a risk of risk seeker even though I'm not so much right now but I also think it's very important
1157.00s: if I had to choose between out working someone or being a little bit smarter than someone 100 out of 100 times I would always choose the out working someone because that's something that you control that's in your own power
1171.00s: whereas I know that my one of my friends who is actually my roommate a Cornell his name is RB and he was brilliant like even by Cornell standards
1182.00s: but he he doesn't really he never really worked out hard and you know he is he's okay like he's like successful he works the capital like you but he definitely didn't accomplish his goals and he definitely didn't accomplish like max out of his full potential and he's brilliant.
1201.00s: Yeah yeah I agree with you I think that unless you're in like a hyper technical field the hustle can I call it the hustle but it's exactly we're talking about like this work ethic this talk ethic that it can take you super far it's like the same people that I meet I have a couple friends from high school that started like construct.
1217.00s: They even go to college you know what I mean and they're they're doing great and so exactly to your point like being a little bit street smart but I think work ethic can take you a really long way
1229.00s: I think that's an interesting.
1230.00s: And one quick thing before you get into like more so like options trading in my opinion I feel like like intelligence is vastly overrated I live in South Florida and you can be a multi-millionaire by opening up like your own HVAC company like the HVAC I had people come here to service my my HVAC units my air conditioners etc.
1253.00s: And I paid them like $700 and I paid them the sell so you're probably not reporting everything so maybe they're important like $200 or $300 but the reality is that if you have a very good work ethic and let's say you don't necessarily enjoy like memorizing everything or you know a lot of the craft that they teach you in high school.
1272.00s: As long as you have a good work ethic and you learn a trade you can become a millionaire very easily you can work in even like power washing driveways or being or owning like a roofing company or construction or HVAC things of that nature you don't necessarily have to gravitate towards things that like society tells you are like very high social status like working as like an engineer or you know AI or like trading or things of that nature you know.
1299.00s: Well you bring up a good point I actually question my whole life's existence I was watching a YouTube video by Caleb Presley he does kind of like these fun interviews they're called Sunday conversations.
1310.00s: And he did one with this this girl called bad baby who exactly is imagine she's an only fans model and she's from Florida and she has like $100 million and in the process of the dialogue though you know Caleb was asking her like Florida you know it's a peninsula like what is that even.
1328.00s: She didn't know what the word peninsula was and then later on in that conversation he asked her like oh so you like reinvest into the business and she essentially was just like I don't know what that means and I said you're thinking like where did I go wrong I need to start an only fans ASAP because I mean obviously she has good work ethic man because she's made a ton of money.
1351.00s: I was like bro yeah to your point a lot of times just being being a hustler it can it can take you a pretty far away provided you're willing to put in the work.
1362.00s: The one thing on that is it's always easy to look at the exceptions you can say like like this person made like $100 million and doesn't know like like basic you know basic knowledge but I think that for every one of her there's probably like 10,000 people who actually are more attractive than her.
1380.00s: I'm only fans who are probably making like a few hundred dollars every single month so for for people who watch her and then you know and also you don't know like what's going on in her life like maybe there are a lot of people who become rich and I'm sure that you know it's pretty common knowledge that winning the lottery for many middle class people or or lower income people for many of them it becomes like the worst thing that happens to them they develop like like you know additions like gambling or you know you're not going to get a job.
1409.00s: You know you're not going to get a job. You're not going to get a job. You're not going to get a job. You're not going to get a job. You're not going to get a job. You're not going to be a gambling or drug addictions and things of that nature so I wouldn't be and I know that you didn't say this in order to so for us to say oh wow like we're ambience and perk but I would just say that for every one of her there's probably 10,000 people that are struggling.
1424.00s: So it's definitely not going to be like a Kim Kardashian or someone like that to like get clicks or for the media to make a big spectacle out of but you also just because someone might be might have a lot of money that doesn't necessarily mean that they have an older shit together and just don't know.
1439.00s: Definitely she clearly doesn't have she doesn't know what the fuck of word peninsula means and she lends on one.
1445.00s: But yeah you actually remind me of the book outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. He talks about like all of those kinds of things which I yeah I completely agree with still makes me super mad that she has a hundred million dollars I went wrong man I should have opened an only fans or something but you know.
1460.00s: How about we transition and talk a little bit about like our favorite preferred trading strategy.
1468.00s: Yeah I think for trading for me I really avoid the idea of falling in love with the strategy the way that I think about it is I have a toolkit my job is to look at the stock market and figure out the correct tool to apply so what that means is I have a grouping of strategies that I almost always run so like the first one is a covered strangle which for the options traders out there it's very good.
1497.00s: Similar to the wheel but I have some pretty specific tweaks that I use with it one of which I always run the short calls at a ratio to the long delta's the second thing is it adds additional cash secured puts out and normally I kind of double dip so I'll have money tied to that trade and then you know I portfolio margins so the broker they don't make it cash secured right so I still have that excess cash available and then I'll put that in like box spreads or something.
1526.00s: Right now box spreads pay really well they're like 5.4% annualized returns so it's a way to kind of call out my core core allocation of the portfolio and then in the speculative allocation of the portfolio which is kind of exactly what it sounds like that's where I'm going to be a little more focused on seeking specific opportunities and for the speculative allocation that's where I'm going to trade things like variance risk premiums so I'm going to use short straddle strangle's iron flies stuff like that.
1555.00s: And then the other big strategy that I use is ratio diagonals those are my directional strategies it's either going to be ratio call diagonal if I'm bullish ratio put diagonal if I'm bearish and those really make kind of the broad ensemble of what I trade if I'm trading volatility expansion I still trade the straddles and strangles typically straddles I would do and I would just buy it.
1580.00s: So I'm sorry go ahead to primarily trade on individual underlines or SPY SPX or do you mix both of them.
1591.00s: Yeah definitely all of them so yeah depending on the strategy so like specifically if I'm trading like box spreads those are going to be an SPX and European options are really important part of the safety of that strategy actually being risk free for the coverage strangle that's almost always in an index ETF I like I WM a lot.
1609.00s: And then for the speculative allocation sometimes it's in indices less so unless it's the variance risk premium trades otherwise it's going to be an individual names more often than not.
1621.00s: Forgive my ignorance because I know that I've looked at I WM before but which which that's this is at a sector ETF.
1629.00s: So it's the Russell 2000 so it looks so 2000 small cap stocks.
1635.00s: Okay that's awesome it seems like you have a plethora of like different trading strategies and today I'm assuming that the answer to this is yes but I also don't want to put words in your mouth.
1648.00s: Does it vary your allocation on which strategy you use based upon like the implied volatility rank or what VIX is trading at or your directional or your thoughts regarding the future direction of the market.
1663.00s: How do they vary based upon like you know where the VIX is trading or your perceptions of like where the market's going to be trading in like 30 days.
1671.00s: It's a great question in a nutshell the way that I dull capital out between or allocation and speculative first comes down to I'm going to try to make my primary returns which for the longest time was 15% per year that was my target.
1686.00s: And I held that for like 12 years and then over the last four or five years I've been ratcheting it down considerably just because I'm favoring a different return profile for the markets and so.
1701.00s: You're trying out to decrease your overall portfolio volatility is opposed to maximizing your return.
1708.00s: Yeah that's exactly I'm not really looking to aggressively grow the portfolio at this point kind of content with where it is i'm still growing it and it's actually funny this here is the first year that I guided myself down somewhere between like a six and eight percent return and when I just did my last YouTube live session right now i'm like just shy of a 30% return on the year so obviously it's kind of a different run for me the way I think about that part at least is.
1734.00s: If I am at my targets i'm just very cautious and selective on where I deploy but I don't like stop because who knows like next year could be awful so but when i'm thinking between core and speculative if I can make the primary return in my core allocation that's great and i'll run that at the smallest size I need in order to maintain my track.
1762.00s: And then the speculative allocation really comes down to opportunity if I see opportunity I always keep a portion of the portfolio open to speculative plays but if I see a lot of opportunity coming up i'll open up more of the allocation to the speculative place like if we're going through an earnings cycle for example.
1782.00s: I have way more speculative trades under in that time frame than I typically would and it's because I need a lot of occurrences in order for various risk premiums to pay me out appropriately and to with start with stand you know the eventual draw downs.
1795.00s: Forgive me for speculating but I actually like I know I can tell that you're like very very intelligent so I love this because yeah I just love like like picking your brain and speaking to you about this when you say.
1811.00s: Speculative in the money like a speculative place are you referring more so to like buying like in the money call options and that's that's been leading is that been like one of the main drivers of like the 30% return that you're that you're currently tracking for or is there something else that this year has significantly contributed to to like the out performance that you've experienced.
1837.00s: Definitely the ratio diagonals so and it's the ratio diagonals are funny that way in that they obviously offer you know directional leverage.
1847.00s: And there's been no shortage of movers this year so I think that that's been a pretty significant portion of it and then also just the prevailing variance risk premiums on this year have been pretty fat at least fatter than we saw last year which has.
1865.00s: A loud pretty reasonable performance and then the other thing in addition to all of that is you know when I'm trading box spreads now you really you have the ability to double dip money so if I have cash allocated the coverage strangle because again the broker they don't care but I track it personally I need to know where the money's going.
1888.00s: And so I'll have the money allocated to I WM covered strangle but then I can still put it in something like a box spread and make a meaningful return on the money whereas you know during covid and really when I first started the YouTube channel I wasn't doing many of that right because rates were near zero you they would almost ask you to pay them to take your money so it's just like yeah this is a complete waste of time but I think those three things coalescing together have really led to a very productive.
1917.00s: And there hasn't been like any sort of giant sharp moves and that's generally what slows me down is if one of those occurs and I get stuck in the middle and I have to work my way out but most of the time I'm very careful with positioning and watching market breath so for the last two and a half weeks I've been net short delta's in I WM which is rare for me normally I have some sort of bullish trade in there but I've essentially rotated the position.
1947.00s: From a covered strangle I just had cash secure puts out and I turned it into a ratio put diagonal because I just saw overall breath changing and kind of following the market trend so the fact that the markets rolling in these cycles is actually really good for me it I can trade those very effectively.
1965.00s: One huge advantage of collecting premium selling options is that especially now where you have short term rates at about five and a half percent you can collect that premium and then reinvest it in short term tea bills or bonds in like three or six months and then you can collect you know five or six percent every single year which just last year you are collecting like post zero so that's amazing and then I'm that spot on.
1991.00s: One more question about about your do you have like a target base exploration that you usually like to that you are you typically like to trade around.
2002.00s: Yeah it obviously varies quite a bit so if I'm trading variance risk premium strategies those are so if I'm trading like short straddles in SPX or if I'm trading earnings those are all going to be zero to four or five DT.
2016.00s: If I'm trading the coverage strangle I have kind of a chart that I use based on just current implied volatility for I WM trending compared to historic volatility and then how far we are off of near term highs but for that it's generally something between two weeks and 30 days something like that in there and then for the ratio diagonals the long leg is pretty much always at least 90 DT.
2045.00s: 90 DT. Vast majority at the time 180 plus and then the short legs are typically around 20 DT.
2052.00s: Awesome as far as my trading strategy I primarily look at look I have a watch list of about 10 to 15 stocks and then I get comfortable with their recent trading range and then when something I believe is over bought or oversold then if it's over bought then I'll sell a call credit spread that's out of the money if it's over.
2074.00s: I'm going to sell the money if it's over bought then or if it's over sold then I'll sell a put credit spread additionally I do like to sell like one DT options on the SPX and for the more I'm very big on mitigating tail risk and reducing overall portfolio volatility so especially during times when VIX is trading below 15 and I think just a few weeks ago it'll allow about like 12 and a half.
2102.00s: You know during those times I will load up on put options in order to that will protect my portfolio for oftentimes years to come and I know that it is very expensive when you're actually making that trade and buying like SPX that it's like two or three years out but at the same time it provides with protection when the VIX is trading at about 12 or 13 or even slightly higher like 13 or 14 because you know that the VIX isn't always going to be trading below 15 it can go from trading at 12 to 12.
2131.00s: trading at 12 to 28 and like literally like two or three days we've seen that multiple times so that's basically my strategy in nutshell and that's actually helped me like during August where the market I think it's still down around like 4% you know I've actually like out before the market by about 5% in total where we're up this year I think it's extremely extremely important and you hinted at this not to chase maximizing your portfolio.
2161.00s: You know you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of
2191.00s: money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money and you're going to be able to get a lot of money freshwater wipes.
2202.28s: That's why they really keep losing money.
2221.00s: And you bring up a bunch of good points.
2223.22s: I agree with you specifically on the idea
2226.16s: of managing risk via size.
2228.44s: I think I do think traders get too wrapped up
2232.04s: in this idea of hedging and they're afraid of variance
2235.44s: and they're afraid of risk.
2237.08s: And I think that a lot of times comes to their own detriment.
2240.64s: Like when I was going through the phase
2242.80s: of aggressively growing my portfolio,
2245.04s: I was very frequently levered, like naked levered,
2248.08s: where if the market took a crap,
2249.80s: I would have been a huge, huge trouble
2252.72s: if I did nothing.
2254.76s: But that's kind of the beauty of trading options
2257.28s: is when we would inevitably get these kinds of downmoves,
2261.12s: there's so many products and so many ways
2263.96s: that we can start off setting risk very quickly
2267.08s: once it starts hitting metrics.
2268.40s: So I agree with you there specifically
2270.28s: on the idea of controlling risk.
2272.84s: And even if you're levered, right?
2275.40s: That's, you can't be levered without controlling risk.
2279.20s: Otherwise, you are going to blow up.
2281.28s: It is literally just a matter of time
2283.00s: before a move happens that you're not ready for
2285.80s: and then you are in a giant, giant problem.
2288.92s: One of the things I wanted to ask you
2290.08s: is you were saying that you're hedging your portfolio
2293.48s: with SPX puts and I'm curious why do you use that
2297.80s: as compared to something like VIX
2300.32s: or like VIX futures or something?
2303.68s: I primarily like SPX because it offsets
2307.04s: some of the zero and one DTE trades that I make.
2309.76s: So from a portfolio margin perspective,
2312.28s: it does help with that.
2315.44s: Additionally, with VIX because from my understanding
2319.32s: of VIX, it's essentially like a math equation
2321.44s: where you know that VIX is trading at 30
2324.32s: then it's only a matter of time
2325.76s: where it's going to then contract
2328.00s: and there's gonna be a volatility crush
2329.64s: more so to the mean.
2330.96s: I actually one part of my strategy
2333.28s: which I really like doing is when VIX is trading
2336.08s: over 30, I will sell calls on VIX with you know
2340.92s: a 30 to 60 day or even 90 day expiration.
2344.44s: But in general, I prefer buying the SPX long dated options
2350.48s: just because it's something that
2352.24s: one, there's a lot of liquidity.
2353.88s: Also you can go as far as like five years out
2357.00s: and it's just something that I feel comfortable with
2360.32s: I've been doing it for a while
2361.68s: and maybe it's just a habit.
2363.16s: But you can definitely hedge with VIX as well
2368.32s: because but also remember that when you are,
2371.12s: when you're buying those puts in SPX,
2374.72s: there is obviously like a large VIX component
2377.40s: because the option pricing is going to be factored in it.
2380.60s: The VIX measures the volatility on the SPX.
2383.64s: So whether you're hedging with VIX or you're hedging
2387.08s: with SPX or SPY, it's extremely highly correlated.
2392.84s: Yeah, definitely and that's actually why I bring it up
2394.68s: because for people that are buying really long-term protection
2398.96s: you know against the portfolio
2400.24s: if you're beta-weighting your delta's going with volatility
2403.64s: a lot of times again to your point
2406.72s: if the VIX is elevated, it's not a great time
2408.76s: you're already too late.
2410.00s: But if the VIX is not elevated at that point,
2413.04s: it's actually I would say a more efficient trade
2417.40s: than going with long SPX puts and it's specifically
2420.92s: because if you buy SPX puts, let's say SPX is trading
2426.92s: at 43.87 right now.
2430.60s: And let's say over the next four months it trends up,
2434.08s: it trends up, it trends up, it trends up.
2436.88s: Now the deductible on your puts are, it's now massive
2441.48s: because the distance between where you entered
2443.68s: and where it is now is very different
2445.48s: whereas that's kind of the beauty if you use VIX volatility
2448.48s: if you're beta-weighting your delta's
2450.88s: because as you know if you get in when VIX is 15
2454.64s: if the market trends up, trends up, trends up
2457.16s: the VIX is still up 15 maybe 14 maybe 13.
2460.64s: Yeah there's always gonna be a fork, especially.
2462.84s: Exactly, like you may be the fork
2465.56s: the fork's gonna be like around 12.
2466.80s: I mean I've heard the VIX has gone below 10
2469.52s: but it's never there for an extended career to time.
2472.52s: Yep, exactly and so it's just,
2474.48s: I found that that actually adds a lot of efficiency
2479.48s: behind the hedge because then you don't have to keep sliding it up
2482.80s: and eating a loss in order to maintain your deductible
2485.52s: on the puts especially if they're longer term.
2488.00s: So yeah, just throwing ideas out there
2490.28s: because I tested both of them pretty extensively
2493.04s: and in general I actually really prefer the VIX.
2496.40s: So using VIX futures.
2498.08s: As far as hedge, okay so that's fine.
2500.76s: Okay so VIX futures and you would prefer VIX futures
2504.32s: opposed to buying long dated VIX calls
2506.96s: like in the money calls.
2508.60s: You do either.
2509.44s: Yeah, I would argue either it's completely fine.
2512.32s: It really just comes down to the size that you're trading
2514.60s: and what kind of protection you're wanting to outlay for.
2519.92s: And I also, one of the other things
2521.64s: that I do talk to people about if we do use VIX options
2525.84s: specifically calls is you can even enhance your risk profile
2531.04s: pretty significantly.
2532.16s: If you start with in the money calls to your point
2534.72s: that will provide the primary hedge
2536.64s: but that you can add some teeny options,
2539.08s: some kickers that are really far out of the money.
2541.48s: There are low extrinsic value anyways, right?
2543.28s: So if theta decay is gonna be inherently slower
2545.88s: no matter what, days to expiration
2547.68s: and being far out of the money.
2549.24s: But then those can compound really quickly
2552.04s: and they can actually pay out like pretty damn nice
2555.00s: in a big pullback.
2556.04s: So yeah, I think combining both of those
2558.44s: is actually really slick.
2560.20s: Those would basically be like lottery tickets, right?
2564.20s: Not in this instance so much like they're really a hedge
2567.76s: but to your point.
2569.12s: Did we, sorry.
2570.52s: We just connected.
2572.32s: Now let me pause.
2576.08s: All right, we got disconnected quickly.
2578.40s: You know, I guess Zoom got too excited
2579.88s: about us talking about VIX calls but we're back at it.
2583.60s: Yeah, so my question was when Eric was discussing
2587.00s: like buying those, so I'm assuming like those
2590.12s: out of the money VIX calls then they would essentially act
2593.04s: as like lottery tickets, is that correct?
2595.56s: Yeah, it's, I guess it depends on what we mean
2598.60s: by lottery tickets but yeah, it would serve as a highly compounding
2605.12s: portion of your hedge is the way I would think about it.
2608.32s: So if the VIX is trading down at 13
2611.64s: and then you buy let's say, you know,
2614.84s: we could look at the actually the VIX right now.
2617.84s: And so if we go out 238 days and you buy some teeny options
2623.92s: that are down at like 10 Delta Irfan,
2628.28s: you're gonna pay what?
2630.76s: Like a few dollars if that but if you get the move
2636.20s: that we're trying to protect against those obviously
2639.76s: compound very quickly.
2642.04s: So they can in a big move, they can actually really
2645.88s: enhance your overall hedge but to your point,
2648.48s: I still think the primary portion of that hedge is gonna come
2651.00s: from the deep in the money because that's gonna move dollar
2653.36s: for dollar fast.
2654.48s: So whenever I'm hedging with something like that,
2658.00s: I almost always add the teeny options
2660.12s: because they're cheap enough and if you can get the compounding
2663.36s: they pay for themselves for the next four times you run them.
2666.64s: But yeah.
2668.44s: And then for our viewers, if you are going to trade the future
2672.56s: I believe that you would have to trade forward slash VIX.
2676.92s: And if you were gonna buy the option,
2679.08s: I think that the preferred way would be to trade VIXX
2683.16s: is that accurate or am I incorrect?
2685.92s: So for VIX futures, it depends on your platform
2688.80s: but for like thinkers women's forward slash VIX not VIX.
2692.52s: Okay.
2693.36s: And then for options, you could use VIXX
2696.60s: or you can use VIX, it really depends on your preference
2699.96s: between the product tracking.
2701.88s: I think I've had good success with both of them.
2706.28s: The other thing you can do that I've gotten kind of cheeky
2708.68s: with before and if you wanna be efficient
2710.32s: as you can use a levered ETF, the downside of that.
2714.32s: But you get via SPX, right?
2716.32s: Yeah, exactly.
2717.28s: The downside of that is there is drag
2720.68s: but the drag on those returns, it's so overplayed by people
2725.28s: that completely write it off as you can't ever hold these
2728.44s: for longer than a week because the drag is so bad.
2730.52s: And it's really not.
2731.40s: That drag simply materializes as tracking error.
2735.52s: So if it says if it's three times levered,
2738.28s: the move you get is like 2.6 time.
2740.68s: Not quite that three times, that's the drag you see.
2743.24s: So yeah, just another way to do it.
2746.20s: For VIXX, by an SVX, I think they actually like reconstituted
2750.04s: or recalculated it on like February 5th or February 6th,
2753.92s: like 2018 because I remember I was flying to Cartagena Columbia
2758.12s: with my wife and then those like,
2761.36s: I forget whether it was VIXX or SVX5, I think it was SVX5.
2765.00s: It basically like blew up.
2766.16s: It went from like 140 to like 12 in like an afternoon
2770.64s: in like four hours.
2772.80s: So yeah, so yeah, like using those,
2775.40s: but yeah, now it's a lot more stable
2777.24s: and I think that the drag is less.
2780.16s: But I'm definitely going to,
2782.12s: I definitely appreciate your thoughts
2784.40s: because I know that you've done like a lot of research
2786.56s: on the pros and cons of SPX versus VIXX.
2790.96s: And I think just without me like doing a lot of research,
2794.88s: it just, it does make a lot of inherent and intuitive sense
2798.68s: where you know that the VIX, if it's at 15, yes,
2802.28s: maybe it drops to about 12,
2804.16s: but you know it's not going to drop to about like six or seven.
2808.24s: Whereas with the stock market,
2809.36s: you actually don't necessarily know
2811.60s: where the bottom is going to be.
2813.64s: So you are inherently protected if you buy those
2817.24s: in the money, long data VIXX calls,
2819.72s: because you know that like if you buy it around 14,
2823.96s: then you're buying close to relatively close to the bottom.
2828.24s: Even if it drops like 12 and a half,
2830.04s: like it did a few weeks ago,
2831.16s: but right now it's trading at about 17.
2834.08s: Yep, that's exactly right.
2835.36s: And the beauty is as we know the market exhibits
2838.68s: positive drift, it's just way more efficient
2841.32s: because you don't have to keep managing it
2843.96s: to manage your deductible when I'm saying, you know,
2846.28s: for the viewers, when I'm saying manage the deductible,
2848.96s: again, if you buy puts for $100 when spy is trading
2853.00s: at 110 just for simplicity,
2855.04s: and the spy now rallies up to 190.
2859.44s: Well, the protective power of those puts
2861.56s: has decreased exponentially.
2863.56s: You have a huge drop and they're now a giant loss.
2867.28s: But you have to roll them up to maintain your protection
2870.40s: and it's expensive because you're doing it at a loss
2872.60s: outlaying more money.
2873.68s: So it's a way to go around that,
2876.16s: but it is important to understand that it is different, right?
2879.52s: So if you're trading products,
2881.60s: making sure that you're tracking the tracking error
2884.60s: because if you do use VIXX calls, for example,
2887.60s: the spy can have a 4% drop,
2890.40s: and the VIXX calls might not even respond.
2892.92s: They might not even wake up.
2894.60s: So the idea of using the...
2896.96s: You know, the existence.
2898.88s: Especially if VIXX is already elevated,
2901.08s: the market can drop like 4% over a week
2903.92s: and you can see VIXX not even move at all.
2906.56s: It's exactly right.
2908.56s: The last year where VIXX is trading like close to 40
2911.72s: and then the market would...
2913.24s: Yeah.
2914.40s: Yeah.
2915.24s: And that's why it's important.
2916.64s: It's not like a one-size-fits-all always do this,
2919.68s: but it is if you're looking for protection,
2922.08s: it's like the same thing, right?
2923.28s: Like the best time to get a roof repair
2925.40s: is when it's not raining.
2926.92s: It's the same exact thing when you're buying
2928.60s: portfolio protection.
2930.20s: But another advantage that I can see is
2932.20s: because of the low cost of VIXX,
2934.36s: you can get much more granular where you don't necessarily
2937.52s: have to spend thousands of dollars on SPX
2940.00s: or even like hundreds of dollars on SPY
2942.80s: because VIXX, if it trades at like 12 or 13,
2946.68s: then it allows you and affords you the opportunity
2948.92s: to be more granular and to hedge off some of the risk.
2952.96s: And without investing tons of money on SPX or even SPY.
2959.28s: Yeah, and I honestly, I normally turn it into kind of
2962.04s: its own little trade.
2963.00s: Like if I'm buying, let's say for example,
2964.88s: deep in the money VIXX calls,
2966.60s: I'll sell short calls against it in VIX,
2969.24s: shorter term timeframe.
2970.36s: I just keep it at a ratio, right?
2971.80s: Because otherwise you get rid of your protection,
2973.52s: you're fighting yourself.
2975.24s: But it is a really, again, easy way
2977.24s: to kind of subsidize some of the long-term holding costs
2979.68s: of it and to your point,
2981.28s: if we're doing it right,
2982.56s: we're going like 80 delta plus for super far in the money.
2985.60s: Fated to K is small.
2987.12s: Overall, theta, extrinsic value of the options is small.
2990.60s: So you don't necessarily have to do a bunch
2992.72s: of short-call campaigns to cover a meaningful portion
2995.36s: of the cost.
2996.44s: You just have to be super careful to do it at a ratio.
2998.52s: Otherwise, you cap your upside potential
3000.28s: or even induce upside risk.
3002.68s: That's not good, right?
3003.76s: Because now you're literally just losing
3005.44s: on your primary position, losing on your hedge.
3007.28s: We've now just completely undone it.
3010.00s: And when you sell the out of the money calls
3012.36s: on the long calls that you, on the long in the money calls,
3016.36s: I'm assuming that you're going like somewhere
3018.32s: like seven or 14 days out, right?
3020.24s: In order to buy some free, okay, that makes a lot of sense.
3023.00s: Yep, that's exactly right.
3023.96s: So essentially what I'm doing is I'm just turning it
3026.04s: into a ratio called diagonal
3027.64s: and just using the offsetting deltas,
3029.88s: the managed broader beta-weighted portfolio races.
3034.08s: And you know, the interesting part of that is
3035.52s: because the deltas are so different
3038.28s: where you're buying the high delta in the money call.
3042.68s: You can actually sell a little bit more
3044.64s: out of the money calls.
3045.88s: I wouldn't go crazy with that,
3047.16s: but if you, let's say you bought like five in the money calls,
3051.16s: you can actually probably sell like a,
3054.28s: maybe maximum of 10 with a shorter duration.
3057.36s: Because you know that if VIX spikes up,
3059.32s: you're going to profit dollar for dollar
3060.96s: on the long calls,
3062.44s: whereas you're not going to lose nearly as much
3064.44s: on the out of the money calls that you sold.
3067.48s: So yeah, I definitely would consider that
3071.24s: to be ultra risky in the concept of a hedge, right?
3074.52s: Because then we definitely would induce upside risk,
3076.84s: but as a standalone position,
3078.56s: I think that could absolutely work just fine.
3082.04s: What are some mistakes that you see new traders make?
3087.44s: I think it's two, two things pretty simply.
3089.76s: I think the first one is approaching trading as a hobby.
3092.76s: And then the second one I think is having busted up expectations.
3096.92s: Like we all start with, right?
3098.24s: We all want to get rich fast.
3099.92s: And that reads typically leads to getting poor fast.
3103.56s: It does not work well with the markets.
3105.56s: And then definitely I think trading is probably
3109.20s: one of the worst possible endeavors to approach it as a hobby.
3113.16s: It is nothing but a pretty sure far away to lose money.
3118.76s: I think for me to kind of echo what you said,
3121.72s: I think sizing is really important
3124.08s: and also expectations.
3126.20s: I mean, we all see on YouTube where you have a bunch of creators
3129.92s: who try to create clickbait and say that they can turn like $500
3133.88s: into like $5 million.
3135.96s: And when you have someone who's like really young
3139.12s: and they have a little bit of money, it attracts them.
3143.00s: And they think that they're going to be able to buy
3145.08s: some really far out of the money,
3147.48s: call options on meme stocks and turn like $500 into $50,000.
3151.76s: But I think that it's very important for people
3154.36s: to play the long game and to build really good habits.
3158.00s: And I'm sure that you would probably agree,
3160.48s: especially as someone who went to the Marines
3163.08s: where habits are basically everything.
3165.44s: Like they tell you that you have to make your bed,
3167.72s: that things have to be spotless
3170.28s: because they want to groom you to make sure
3172.64s: that they create the, that they mold you into a great person
3177.40s: in the future as well.
3178.88s: And if you're the type of person as a new trader who's going
3181.32s: to take low probability trades that has an expected probability
3185.12s: of profit that's going to be significantly negative,
3187.64s: then you're not really teaching yourself anything.
3190.68s: Instead, you might as well you probably have a better time
3193.40s: playing Black Jack or Roulette at the casino
3195.88s: as opposed to gambling in the stock market.
3199.76s: I agree with you, and I think that I like to say habits
3203.04s: are who you are.
3204.24s: If you have somebody who's undisciplined in their diet,
3207.32s: I can guarantee you if you look at their life,
3209.40s: they're undisciplined in other areas.
3211.08s: The same thing for trading.
3212.44s: Like if somebody is an undisciplined trader,
3215.00s: I can look at other aspects and probably identify
3218.28s: where they're also not to.
3219.84s: I do think the idea, you know,
3224.56s: the idea of integrating different payout profiles,
3227.96s: I think has been one of the most important things.
3230.32s: And this is actually something I would be fascinated to kind of
3232.64s: understand more of your perspective on
3234.12s: because when I was trading a lot of vertical spreads,
3238.60s: I did not make a lot of money.
3240.60s: Especially after including costs,
3243.28s: it was a lot of work and not a lot of payout.
3247.12s: And I think one of the things that I would encourage
3250.08s: option traders specifically to do is to not fall in love
3254.84s: with fine or selling, theta gang or Vega,
3258.60s: like don't get too wrapped up in an individual camp
3262.72s: because if one style of options trading had an inherent edge
3267.72s: that was extractable long term.
3270.16s: Everybody would do that.
3271.64s: Yeah, bingo.
3272.64s: So, and I like that you integrated,
3275.40s: you know, because like I know that you were talking about
3277.00s: trading spreads a little bit in verticals
3278.80s: and it's definitely not my go to,
3280.64s: but it can be done successfully.
3282.48s: And I also like that you integrate ideas of creating a range,
3286.52s: right?
3287.36s: Because now you're overlaying some discretionary components
3289.40s: to it that absolutely can increase our efficacy.
3293.12s: But I'm curious,
3295.64s: what has kept you with vertical spreads versus kind of venturing
3300.36s: into other stuff?
3302.20s: Well, I think that with spreads,
3303.44s: I actually don't,
3304.44s: I would choose a strike on the short-put side,
3306.68s: where I actually don't mind taking ownership of it.
3309.56s: So on one of my accounts,
3311.00s: I'm using portfolio margins,
3312.24s: so I could trade a little bit larger.
3314.48s: And then in the worst case scenario,
3316.08s: because I'm trading on very highly liquid large cap stocks,
3320.44s: like Amazon, where if I sold a spread
3322.76s: on Amazon, let's say it's like 90 by 80.
3325.80s: And I know that last year,
3327.72s: Amazon hit a low of like 82.
3330.12s: In that situation,
3331.12s: I'll actually take ownership and go long Amazon,
3333.80s: just because I feel like, you know,
3335.56s: on a net basis,
3336.88s: being long Amazon at 88,
3339.12s: where just like a few months earlier,
3340.84s: I was trading at like 185,
3343.12s: then I think that the risk to reward
3345.16s: from the upside perspective is pretty damn good.
3349.08s: So I'll sell spreads,
3350.52s: and then I actually don't mind taking ownership of it.
3353.00s: And also, because I will sell spreads on things
3355.80s: that I perceive to be oversold,
3357.76s: then the implied volatility rank
3359.88s: on that specific underlying is actually higher,
3362.60s: because the stock has fallen
3364.92s: from where it was previously trading.
3366.76s: So therefore, I'll collect a little bit more premium.
3369.76s: And I would say spreads comprise about like 30 to 40%.
3375.44s: Similar to you,
3376.36s: I will integrate different strategies based upon,
3380.20s: like where volatility is,
3381.80s: how much credit I'm receiving, et cetera.
3384.56s: So I think it's just one of the strategies that I'll use,
3388.24s: but it's not something that,
3389.96s: but I agree with you,
3390.72s: especially during periods when volatility is low,
3393.40s: and if you're using regulation team margin,
3396.16s: and if you're trading something,
3398.00s: which is a pretty narrow spread,
3400.80s: then oftentimes if you're picking up like 25 cents
3404.12s: or $25 for every contract that you sell,
3406.80s: and when you factor in commissions,
3409.04s: oftentimes it's not really worth doing.
3410.88s: So you have to make sure that you have multiple strategies
3413.68s: at your disposal.
3415.60s: Yeah, I agree with that.
3416.68s: And I also, like the fact that you trade spreads semi-descriptionally
3420.84s: and directionally also makes a little bit more sense
3423.32s: to me in terms of just including a floor,
3425.68s: because I see people who trade,
3427.96s: you know, the theta gangers, they trade verticals.
3430.56s: And I tried to like conceptualize why this would make any sense,
3435.36s: because their whole premise is,
3437.16s: we're selling premium because it's overpriced
3440.76s: and it's high, logical,
3442.52s: but then they're buying it.
3445.28s: They're buying the very thing that they're selling
3447.00s: because it's high,
3448.00s: and they're buying something that's too expensive then.
3450.44s: So that part confuses me a little bit,
3452.28s: but I see definitely more of the way that you're employing it.
3455.88s: It's interesting to me.
3458.00s: You know, one of my close friends on YouTube,
3460.56s: he's kind of against like using any type of discretion
3464.00s: in your trading.
3465.96s: And I never necessarily understood that.
3467.88s: It's kind of like oftentimes people think that
3470.40s: and this kind of goes into what we were discussing earlier,
3473.52s: or like on email and we're gonna touch on it
3475.88s: in this call as well about like AI and bots.
3478.56s: I do think that it is important to have some discretion
3482.04s: in your trading,
3483.36s: because if you don't have any discretion,
3486.44s: then just like you said,
3487.76s: you're really not going to be collecting that much premium
3490.40s: and you're not going to be able to know when to allocate
3493.80s: and when to use different strategies based upon
3496.44s: the market condition.
3497.56s: So I know that discretionary trading or using different strategies
3502.04s: at your discretion can oftentimes be looked down upon,
3505.16s: but I think that it's worthwhile.
3507.80s: You know, if you have something like,
3509.88s: like earlier today, I made a trade on BlackRock
3512.76s: because BlackRock, it was trading, you know,
3515.52s: at one point it was trading over 900,
3517.96s: and recently it's been trading around 670.
3520.72s: So I think that selling a put,
3523.00s: a vertical credit spread with like a 520 by like 460
3526.72s: is not that bad considering that in the worst case scenario,
3530.08s: I can roll that position into a naked
3532.52s: if I wanted to take ownership,
3534.40s: roll it down to like 460,
3536.12s: and then simply take ownership of like 100 or 200 shares,
3539.68s: and I think that from a long term perspective,
3542.84s: that's not necessarily a bad trade considering
3545.16s: that I would be able to take ownership of BlackRock
3548.24s: at less than 50% of where some people
3550.84s: had previously purchased it.
3552.88s: But, you know, we don't know like BlackRock
3554.56s: can fall below 300,
3555.88s: but I think that statistically the odds of taking ownership
3561.44s: and owning BlackRock at like 460 to 480,
3564.40s: that's not a bad trade.
3567.04s: Well, I also think that's the whole point
3568.52s: of you doing the spread, right?
3569.80s: Because it includes some sort of risk management inherent
3574.00s: because to your point, like if you wanted to,
3576.12s: if you were trading it as a cash-secured put,
3578.48s: you wouldn't put the spread.
3579.84s: You would just trade the cash-cured put,
3581.32s: you would make more money,
3582.76s: but I think that by you trading those kinds of things
3586.52s: that spread at least gives you some optionality.
3588.56s: And to your friends point, I find that fascinating
3591.08s: because I think without discretion in trading,
3597.48s: there is essentially no alpha.
3599.68s: Like I don't see a retail available automated trading approach
3605.76s: that can produce alpha.
3607.84s: I'm open to it.
3609.00s: I would love to, I genuinely would love to,
3610.64s: I would pay for it if it exists.
3613.32s: But I genuinely do not believe that that's going to exist,
3618.16s: probably at all.
3619.12s: And it's again, as soon as that exists, I would buy it,
3623.80s: I would lever it, and then that's it.
3626.20s: I would, I'm not so attached to the art of trading.
3629.52s: What I tell people is like, I'm a businessman first.
3632.48s: I'm here to make money.
3634.36s: So if there's something that can make money
3637.08s: more efficiently than I can, I wouldn't be like,
3639.28s: oh, but this is what I do, and this is what, like,
3642.28s: through all of that, if there is this non-discretionary system
3647.12s: that is reliably profitable, I would 100% use it.
3651.00s: So yeah, it's interesting, but also to your friends point,
3655.44s: and the reason why discretionary trading gets looked at
3658.16s: down on a lot, I think, is because there's levels to think,
3662.20s: right? Like if you do jitsu, there are certain moves
3664.92s: that are looked down upon for new people,
3667.20s: and it's because they dork it up all the time.
3669.52s: But for the seasoned people, they do it all the time
3672.24s: because it's effective.
3673.56s: I find the same thing with discretionary trading.
3675.44s: The reason why I think it's looked down on
3678.04s: is because most traders take that to the extreme,
3681.24s: where they're just shooting from the hit, man,
3682.84s: like they have no plan, they have no logs,
3684.64s: they have no way of tracking and optimizing,
3686.84s: and then they wonder why they fail.
3688.68s: So yeah, it's a really fascinating part of trading, I think.
3693.72s: I think I grew through 100%, and I wish
3697.16s: that someone would prove me wrong,
3699.20s: and maybe in the future, we will be proven wrong,
3702.20s: that we'll be able to remove the discretion from it,
3704.52s: but I don't think that it's where it is right now,
3708.48s: where you can program a bot or an AI,
3710.48s: and we'll talk about this a little bit later,
3712.28s: but I don't think that AI and bots
3715.00s: and removing all the discretion is where it is,
3718.96s: but where it needs to be right now,
3721.44s: in order to have it produce alpha.
3723.88s: And I do believe that some of the reasons why people want
3726.76s: to remove the discretion from their trading
3729.24s: is because if you remove all the discretion
3731.92s: and then the trade goes against you,
3733.60s: then suddenly it's not your fault.
3735.36s: It's the fault of the rules or the fault of the bot,
3739.48s: but suddenly you're absolved from any responsibility.
3742.80s: Oh, it's not my fault, it's the bot,
3744.92s: it's the robot, it's the rules that I programmed it with.
3748.96s: So hey, if you want to earn alpha,
3751.36s: if you want to make money,
3753.12s: then I do believe that taking personal responsibility
3756.00s: and owning it and educating yourself
3758.04s: and making the right decisions
3759.24s: is probably your best way of actually achieving that.
3762.24s: And I think what you said earlier
3763.72s: before we started recording also holds really true here
3767.16s: is like who doesn't want easy money?
3769.92s: Who like who do I want easy money?
3771.68s: Like that's how it really sounds good to me.
3774.20s: So the idea of being able to program rules into a bot
3777.20s: and let it go make money for you,
3778.48s: it sounds very easy and it's,
3780.12s: I think the idea of like these rules based
3782.92s: or systems based trading, it's so funny,
3785.80s: it's nefarious because it sounds really intellectual.
3789.08s: It sounds so smart.
3790.60s: Why wouldn't she want to cut out the human emotion?
3792.88s: Why wouldn't she want to cut out the variance
3795.04s: in your execution?
3796.40s: Like that sounds super smart to me,
3798.84s: but unfortunately that last part
3801.64s: where we actually applied discretion,
3803.72s: again, in my opinion, that's where alpha is.
3806.72s: Otherwise, I would program the same exact robot, man.
3810.52s: Yeah, a few things before we wrap up,
3813.00s: I want to talk about zero DTE.
3815.60s: I want to briefly talk about,
3817.64s: although we kind of already did like AI and bots,
3820.84s: but we can touch upon that a little bit.
3822.84s: And then you have a very unique perspective
3825.48s: which I didn't use to agree with,
3828.04s: but now I do agree with about rolling.
3829.84s: So I also want to share that with the audience.
3832.68s: Can you share with me like your thoughts
3834.72s: about like zero and one DTE trading?
3838.76s: Yeah.
3840.56s: It's a, it's a tricky place to operate.
3844.68s: So in short, there are a lot of opportunities in that space.
3851.00s: In long, the vast majority of retail traders
3854.24s: lose money in that space.
3856.04s: And it's not what I always encourage people to check out
3859.04s: is SSRN.
3861.00s: It's a place where you can find peer-reviewed studies
3863.68s: on all of this stuff because I have a really comprehensive
3868.92s: data set at this point, to be honest,
3870.52s: because I've been tracking for 15 years now.
3873.80s: However, I always encourage people like,
3876.04s: I'm just a dude talking on the internet.
3878.08s: You in no way should take what I say as some sort of law.
3883.60s: You should look up peer-reviewed work on this stuff.
3886.56s: And there is some really, really, really great zero DTE SPX
3892.56s: studies on this exact thing.
3894.16s: And I have a couple of videos that talk about it,
3896.24s: but the punchline is once you get through essentially
3900.80s: when zero DTE options were launched,
3902.96s: which was what, 11 May, 21 or 22.
3906.72s: And after that timeframe, when we had daily expirations
3910.60s: essentially, and in that timeframe,
3913.40s: retail traders were profitable net fees for about four months.
3918.00s: And then once we look both net and gross P&L,
3923.16s: it's huge down, huge down.
3926.32s: So I think that it's an interesting place to play.
3930.24s: There's a lot of slop in the pricing,
3932.48s: which is something that don't think retail traders fully appreciate.
3936.40s: Isn't a lot of the reasons why,
3938.64s: and I think I've read some of the research reports,
3940.84s: a lot of, in my understanding,
3942.36s: please correct me if I'm wrong,
3943.32s: because you're more educated about this than I am.
3945.72s: But a lot of it has to do with the slippage and the commissions
3948.32s: that comprise the vast majority of their losses.
3951.92s: Is that accurate or am I incorrect?
3954.20s: Yes, that's exactly it.
3956.00s: And so there is a study that's actually like,
3958.64s: really recent that I like.
3960.12s: It's called, and I'll give you the link to it too,
3963.44s: just so that people can check it out.
3965.28s: But it's called retail traders love zero DTE options,
3969.04s: but should they?
3970.12s: And it's by Beckmeyer, Branger, and Gaita.
3972.96s: This was done in 13 April 2023.
3976.00s: And it talks about literally, quite literally,
3978.92s: exactly what you just said.
3980.88s: Because retail traders have actually gotten okay
3985.04s: at integrating aspects of volatility assumptions
3989.24s: into their trading, which is positively predicting.
3992.32s: That's a good thing.
3993.40s: However, even now, once you look at gross returns,
3998.52s: they're not doing a good enough job at it.
4000.64s: So they're getting that part wrong.
4002.08s: And then once you add net, we start adding the fees,
4005.52s: it's massive, massive daily losses.
4008.56s: I think retail traders using slim options, meaning,
4011.64s: those are, I'm not sure if you're familiar with the process,
4014.76s: but it's like a price improvement process for 10 lots or less.
4017.68s: You can kind of typically identify retail traders in that space.
4020.88s: And of those options, like, there's $133,000 being lost
4026.60s: every single day by retail traders in zero DTE options,
4030.52s: doing that in the aggregate.
4032.04s: So it's just a massive, massive perpetual loss
4036.24s: that they're facing.
4037.08s: So I think they're good.
4038.44s: And I think they have their place.
4040.12s: I like them.
4041.44s: But I always remind people, it is a minority of what I do.
4045.68s: It might be 5%, 10%, maybe, of my total volume.
4050.68s: But there's opportunity, but yeah, it's very tricky.
4054.92s: And what are your thoughts regarding rolling?
4057.44s: I think this is very, very valuable.
4060.80s: Rolling to me is, it's fake.
4063.04s: It's a fugazia.
4063.92s: It doesn't mean anything.
4065.84s: I think retail traders essentially deploy it as a way to avert losses.
4070.60s: That's a giant behavior of retail traders
4073.32s: as loss aversion.
4074.68s: And what I try to explain to people is rolling is super simple.
4078.52s: We close a trade and we open up a brand new trade.
4083.00s: That's what a role is.
4084.04s: We're simply attempting to tie the accounting to one another.
4088.76s: But none of that matters in any material way.
4092.08s: Your broker doesn't care.
4093.48s: Your broker includes it because you like it.
4096.20s: And their job is to perform a service.
4098.52s: So they're like retail traders like the idea of rolling options.
4101.44s: And sure, it does add some simplicity here and there.
4104.16s: I roll options to be very clear.
4106.04s: I roll them.
4107.04s: But I am under no confusion.
4110.12s: That typically when I'm rolling an option,
4112.00s: I am closing a trade for a loss.
4114.20s: I am realizing a loss.
4116.32s: And I'm opening up a brand new one that could overwhelm the loss
4120.60s: of the previous trade.
4121.84s: But there's a big difference between realized P&L
4125.16s: and unrealized P&L.
4126.96s: So yeah, rolling trade, super simple,
4129.12s: closing a trade, opening up a new one.
4131.52s: I think your video on loss of version and rolling
4135.56s: was one of the better videos on option trading
4137.64s: that I've seen in all of YouTube.
4139.32s: And I appreciate that.
4141.48s: I'm definitely going to hopefully I remember to link
4144.48s: to that video in the description because it was amazing.
4149.24s: I definitely think that rolling has a little bit to do
4152.40s: with people is ego where especially when you're selling
4154.92s: options and hey, I do it myself.
4157.68s: I'm like, oh, you can win up to 98% of your trades.
4160.56s: But the reality is you have to be completely comfortable
4163.84s: losing that 2% to 5% of your trades.
4166.92s: And almost to counterbalance the psychological dependency
4173.24s: that we have or the psychological fallacy that human beings
4175.96s: are cognitively biased towards for the loss of version.
4180.28s: It's almost like we should seek.
4182.64s: We should be lost seeking if we have a bad trade
4185.48s: go against us to counteract that loss of version.
4188.88s: It's almost in your best interest to be lost seeking.
4191.68s: Where if you have something go against you,
4193.72s: it's completely OK.
4195.28s: Just to close it out, take a small loss
4197.84s: and recognize that you'll make it back on your next trades.
4202.68s: But where you won't make it back is if you add increased risk
4206.48s: to that trade, you increase the number of puts
4208.60s: or you increase the number of calls
4210.20s: if your call side is challenged.
4211.84s: And then you turn a small loss into a big loss.
4215.00s: Because you can still win 95% 98% of your trades.
4218.56s: But if that 2% to 5% of your losses
4222.12s: are if they overwhelm your gains because you didn't want
4226.32s: to simply accept that loss, then you
4228.16s: can actually end up losing money by trading options,
4230.96s: even if you have a high win rate.
4233.68s: It's such a powerful way to frame it.
4236.64s: But I couldn't frame that any better myself
4240.44s: that we should be seeking long.
4242.56s: The way that I think about it is the vast majority
4248.24s: of successful traders that I know,
4250.48s: they might win about 50%.
4252.52s: If they're good, the idea of these really high win rates
4256.20s: is exactly to your point.
4257.76s: It appeals to two things.
4259.44s: It appeals to ego.
4261.16s: And it appeals to loss of version.
4263.28s: Because we're scared of losing capital.
4265.64s: But what I try to remind people is that I would rather
4269.40s: win 51% of my trades, but manage risk well
4273.32s: and have a good return than when 90% of the trades
4276.92s: and then after friction not have any money to show for it.
4280.28s: Yeah, being wrong quickly is a really good methodology.
4284.40s: And the other thing I'll add to that quickly
4286.12s: is just the way to kind of embrace that I think
4290.32s: is to not take losing trades as some sort of like
4293.92s: a value assessment of you as a human being.
4296.76s: If you have a losing trade, it doesn't make you a loser.
4300.00s: Yeah, you're not a failure.
4301.72s: You have a losing position.
4302.80s: If you play basketball, you're going to miss some shots.
4305.72s: It happens.
4306.88s: But the idea is in aggregate does this make sense?
4310.08s: Do we have positive expected value?
4311.88s: That's what matters.
4313.56s: The big your video, like I said before, was amazing.
4316.64s: And the biggest takeaway that I took from your video
4319.28s: because you really hit hard into like the fallacy,
4322.64s: the psychological dependency upon loss of version.
4325.36s: The biggest takeaway that I took away from my video was,
4327.60s: man, I should really be risk seeking.
4329.88s: I should actually lean into my losses
4332.76s: and the trades that I feel uncomfortable about
4335.32s: and which are showing me like a 3X loss of like the credit
4338.84s: received.
4339.68s: Instead of hoping that they're going to turn around
4342.56s: and that you're going to show me a profit,
4344.40s: it's actually in my best interest
4346.64s: to just simply close them out and just move on.
4349.96s: Be loss seeking.
4351.80s: That was the biggest takeaway that I took.
4353.48s: Because that's going, you almost have to overpower
4356.32s: and overcorrect for the inherent psychological foul
4360.32s: for the inherent psychological, you know, like whatever
4364.24s: the word is.
4365.08s: But the psychological fallacy that you have to be lost
4368.92s: to be lost for a loss of version,
4370.84s: you almost have to overcorrect for that
4372.72s: in order to overcome it.
4374.60s: I completely agree with you.
4375.60s: And it takes a while because all of those undertones exist
4380.00s: and a lot of it comes from healthy detachment of capital,
4383.04s: all those kinds of things.
4384.16s: But exactly to your point, I have losing trades very frequently.
4388.00s: And at no point do I look at them and say,
4390.36s: this is it for me, this is the end.
4392.24s: And a big part of that is if you're sizing trades efficiently
4396.32s: and if you're deploying in a broader system
4398.92s: that has positive expected edge in the long run,
4402.08s: losses are part of the game.
4403.44s: It's just, it is just part of the journey.
4405.36s: It's like, again, if you do jitsu,
4407.20s: you're going to get tapped out.
4408.56s: It's going to happen.
4409.28s: You're going to lose.
4410.56s: But the idea is to get tapped out quick enough
4412.56s: so they don't break anything.
4414.04s: And then you learn and move on.
4416.64s: And the final thing, which we touched upon earlier,
4419.48s: regarding your thoughts for like AI and bots
4422.16s: and removing discretion, you know, I echo what you said earlier
4426.76s: where I just don't think, I think that everyone
4429.20s: wants to make easy money and they want to remove the discretion.
4432.56s: They want to remove the decision making process
4434.68s: because therefore it's one less decision they have to make
4436.80s: because hey, look, making decisions can be stressful
4439.24s: and we're all overwhelmed and overworked.
4441.12s: But I don't think that right now,
4444.40s: now I can't tell the future.
4445.56s: So maybe in the future the technology will improve
4448.36s: or the, you know, what you can do with building out the bot
4451.76s: et cetera, it might essentially improve.
4453.40s: But in my opinion, I just don't think that it's worthwhile
4457.12s: right now and you made a great point when you said that
4460.24s: the outflow is in the discretion
4462.76s: and in the decision making process.
4465.68s: So what are your, you know, I kind of summarized it
4469.04s: but do you have anything to add?
4470.68s: Yeah, no, I think you nailed it.
4471.96s: I think it's important for retail traders
4473.84s: to respect and understand how professionals
4477.32s: and institutions operate.
4479.36s: But part of that is to clearly understand the difference
4482.32s: in our, in our structure.
4483.52s: So one of the big things that institutions
4486.40s: and that includes market makers in this kind of parlance
4489.12s: is they have a giant leverage benefit that we don't have
4494.16s: and we'll never see.
4495.44s: And essentially that allows them to offset a lot of risk
4498.64s: as they're making books and as they're managing
4501.36s: their broader book.
4502.60s: And obviously they have much, much, much less friction
4505.76s: than we do.
4506.68s: So the idea of high frequency trading or arbitrage
4510.04s: where we're finding things that are mispriced
4512.08s: and then pricing them back in, it's accessible
4515.36s: to those people for those reasons.
4517.40s: And I actually think it's good for retail traders
4520.24s: to try to mimic what's successful.
4523.16s: If you want to be good at jujitsu,
4525.12s: you should look at what Gordon Ryan is doing
4527.20s: and try to pick up something.
4528.96s: It's the same thing for retail traders.
4530.80s: However, you're not Gordon Ryan, right?
4534.28s: So like you have to acknowledge
4535.96s: some of the differences between the two.
4537.40s: And I think that's important for retail,
4538.80s: which is exactly what you were.
4540.48s: The idea of like tinkering with and playing with AI
4544.00s: or automation parts of your trading is smart.
4546.48s: I automate parts of my trading.
4548.20s: I scan.
4549.08s: That's automation.
4550.24s: I plug in rules that apply to my strategy
4553.16s: to quickly just run through a bunch of stuff
4556.32s: to reduce what I have to look at.
4557.88s: I automate parts of what I find opportunities.
4561.12s: But then at the end of the day,
4562.56s: you're the one who is sifting through,
4564.84s: let's say there were a thousand
4565.92s: and then you use a scan in order to narrow down
4568.08s: to like 20 or 30, but then you choose
4570.16s: what you perceive to be the best like three or four
4572.32s: and then you make a trade out of it, right?
4573.92s: That's exactly it.
4575.36s: And one of the things that, yeah,
4577.60s: one of the prevailing traits of successful traders
4580.04s: long term, again, I encourage you,
4581.44s: the study's called the behavior of individual investors.
4584.92s: It's an older one, but it's fantastic.
4587.00s: And one of the traits of successful traders
4588.96s: is pattern recognition.
4591.04s: It's our capacity to look at data long term
4594.76s: and come up with different assumptions.
4596.80s: And the cool part about pattern recognition
4599.16s: is once you do it for long enough,
4601.52s: there's a giant subconscious component to it
4605.60s: where you look at something
4607.08s: and you might consciously be saying,
4608.72s: okay, the moving averages are doing this,
4610.40s: the linear regression channels are doing this,
4612.28s: but your mind is running through the roll index, man.
4615.04s: If you look through thousands of charts,
4616.84s: it's overlaying and looking for patterns subconsciously,
4620.16s: which is such a powerful mechanism.
4621.88s: A lot of times that manifests itself as,
4624.68s: that's the pit of my stomach.
4626.48s: I'm following my gut here, something feels weird.
4629.08s: Believe it or not, your stomach is not telling you jack shit.
4632.96s: That is the subconscious processing part of your mind
4636.20s: that is just filing down tons of information
4639.60s: and giving you cues that you may or may not realize are there.
4643.32s: So yeah, pattern recognition is massive.
4646.48s: I think pattern recognition is extremely important
4648.88s: in everything that you do.
4650.20s: If you look at someone like the Braun James,
4652.24s: one of the best basketball players ever,
4653.56s: whether you think he's had a Jordan like one or two,
4656.28s: you know, he's one of the best.
4658.16s: If you listen to him talk,
4660.72s: he has the ability of remembering specific plays
4664.04s: even from 10 or 15 years ago.
4666.72s: And because of that, even though he's older now,
4668.76s: he's about like 38 years old,
4670.76s: he's able to position himself
4673.00s: and make the right basketball decision
4675.24s: where even though this physical characteristics
4678.72s: have declined a little bit,
4679.92s: he's still a top 10 player in the league,
4682.24s: just simply because of what you said,
4684.40s: pattern recognition and being able to distill
4688.08s: tons of information down to its most important takeaways
4692.68s: where he can actually act upon it and use it to benefit.
4696.12s: And there's really no difference
4697.56s: about what he's doing versus what we're doing as traders,
4700.08s: where we're looking at patterns,
4701.84s: we're looking at the best opportunities
4703.76s: and then we're acting upon it
4705.44s: to hopefully achieve alpha based upon our experience.
4710.16s: It's literally a beautiful summer, I completely agree.
4713.84s: Awesome. So honestly, this was one of the better chats
4716.40s: that I've had.
4717.24s: I think that you're brilliant.
4718.56s: And I actually didn't know that we grew up
4720.60s: in the same area of the country.
4722.48s: That's amazing.
4724.32s: I would definitely like to do this again in the future.
4726.80s: So I'm going to link to your channel.
4730.64s: And I'll post this probably in around early September
4736.64s: and guys definitely follow ES Invest
4740.24s: so I'll link to his channel below.
4743.08s: And then for Eric's viewers,
4744.32s: my channel is bestdocshratagy.com.
4746.76s: If you guys enjoyed this,
4747.96s: then please leave a comment below.
4749.36s: I would love to do this again.
4751.12s: And thank you so much for your attention.
4753.32s: Eric, do you have anything else to say
4754.80s: before we wrap up?
4756.32s: No, man, Stoke, Taddle Blash, chat with you
4758.20s: and thank you for the time.
4760.12s: Thanks again, guys.
4761.48s: Awesome, take care.
