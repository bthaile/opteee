0.84s: bit of an interesting week ahead for
2.80s: GameStop the shareholder meeting was
5.16s: moved again now I think it's Monday but
7.68s: a couple people sent in a few things
9.76s: from Good Old super ston about options
12.92s: and as you know I'm a dude ready to talk
15.64s: about some options even if it's like 70
18.24s: and sunny here in the middle of a Sunday
20.40s: afternoon in San Diego I'm here for you
22.84s: guys it's mostly just cuz I find this
24.84s: stuff fascinating but the I just want to
27.24s: talk through essentially these two
28.56s: different things people sent in one of
30.12s: them is about implied volatility over
32.24s: the weekend and the other one is about
34.84s: kind of the the Paradox of buying far
37.72s: out of the money options and why it's a
40.12s: bit of a trap in a lot of different ways
42.12s: the goal here is just to give you
43.44s: information so that you can make better
46.00s: educated decisions when it comes to
47.76s: options because they can be tricky the
50.96s: learning curve for them is very steep up
52.56s: front once you know how they work it's
53.96s: kind of like knowing anything else if I
55.84s: I like cars so if you're in auto
57.00s: mechanics it's the same thing when you
58.12s: first look at it you have no idea what
59.20s: you're staring at but then once you get
60.68s: it you kind of get it it's the same
61.96s: thing with options it's really nothing
63.16s: that complex so I'm gonna break this all
65.04s: down Barney style for us all now first
68.04s: let's talk about this this post from
70.48s: Good Old Boss blunts is GameStop implied
73.92s: volatility continues to rise this
75.96s: weekend so they're talking about this
77.52s: option and they're essentially saying
78.92s: hey what's going on over the weekend
81.52s: implied volatility is moving and it may
84.48s: or may not be and in this case it is but
87.68s: it's not and I'll explain exactly what
89.36s: that means so if we take a look at my
92.40s: ugly mug from a screenshot this is a
94.92s: video that I did Friday after the close
98.20s: take a look at the implied volatility
100.40s: for this coming expiration cycle which
102.56s: is 21 June in GameStop the implied
106.04s: volatility for this chain at this time
108.04s: was 234. 71% I kind of blow it out
111.08s: because this is a little bit blurry so
113.64s: in general implied volatility doesn't
115.60s: move that much over the weekend now if
117.24s: we take a look at what it is today
120.28s: there's a pretty big variance so right
122.60s: now the implied volatility is 272.50
150.08s: in this case there's a lot of conjecture
152.44s: going on in the short term a lot with
153.92s: the shareholder meeting and whatnot and
155.76s: we actually can kind of see that so I
157.60s: want to show you what I'm seeing if we
159.76s: take a look at this coming expiration
161.76s: let me scoot this down this might be
163.56s: weird to you up front so let me explain
165.28s: what you're looking at this is looking
167.12s: at the implied volatility for out ofth
169.60s: money options so right now GameStop
172.76s: closed at 2870 so that means that 2870
176.88s: is about right
178.84s: here so everything to the left of this
182.68s: line is out of the money puts everything
185.76s: to the right of current spot price is
188.32s: out of the money calls because this is
190.60s: looking at out of the money options and
193.12s: this goes back to kind of options 101 if
195.48s: we go again just pop open the chain
197.32s: maybe make it a little easier this is
199.36s: the call side this is the put side
201.36s: notice how everything with a strike
203.32s: price above the current price those are
206.16s: out of the money and then on the put
208.56s: side it's the inverse if your strike
210.68s: price is below the current price they're
212.92s: out of the money so it's important
214.88s: because if we take a look at this you'll
216.60s: notice something especially if you trade
218.32s: options with any sort of frequency
220.36s: there's something anomalous here it's
223.64s: just massive call skew massive call skew
227.00s: in terms of volatility and in terms of
229.72s: implied volatility for this reference
231.36s: time frame because notice how much
233.44s: higher this line is for the out-of the
235.64s: money calls relative to the out of-the
237.20s: money puts normally that's the inverse
241.28s: so to show you what this might look like
243.12s: normally let's grab something like
245.12s: SPX and we'll go down to the same thing
248.16s: this looks super noisy right now CU you
249.88s: notice this is using a ton of different
252.28s: expirations so to kind of clean this up
254.64s: a little bit let's just pick something
255.96s: that's a little further out not like
258.20s: that maybe I'm trying to find like a
260.08s: good oh here we go 19 July here we go 16
262.92s: August so if we look at the out ofth
265.80s: money options here in something like SPX
268.48s: notice it's actually quite literally the
270.64s: exact inverse because we typically see
273.88s: puts trading with more V than calls the
277.80s: market
279.36s: overemphasizes downside risk and you
282.24s: will typically see more vs to things
285.40s: that experience downside risk so in this
288.16s: case puts so all these out-of-the-money
290.40s: puts are way jacked up as compared to
292.92s: the calls and again if we go back to
295.12s: GameStop and again let's clear out all
297.44s: this noise we'll look at this near-term
298.68s: expiration it's literally the exact
300.44s: inverts which is really interesting
302.64s: another interesting thing for kind of
304.20s: the options nerds all these little bumps
306.16s: that you see those are tradable events
308.00s: you can trade relative volatility for
310.12s: these positions not going to go super
311.48s: far into that on this I'm just trying to
313.04s: explain a little bit of what's going on
315.16s: here because all of this amounts to the
318.16s: market expects something to happen this
320.32s: week now how big or how small that's TBD
323.48s: and I know a lot of people were really
325.00s: really hopeful for kind of this big
327.12s: squeeze coming on due to the potential
329.96s: of options from raring Kitty
332.16s: unfortunately again based on my best
334.12s: calculations that I can see I don't
335.44s: think he exercised and I'm not here to
337.88s: spread fud I know people are like really
339.76s: really concerned about that rightfully
341.16s: so big institutions are seemingly
344.24s: putting quite a interesting spin on a
346.16s: lot of this data no doubt but I again
348.88s: I'm just trying to call it as I see it
350.28s: and share just straight up information
352.48s: for you to make whatever conclusions you
354.20s: want the reason why I don't think he
355.16s: exercised is because he would have lost
357.32s: millions of dollars to do that he he had
360.16s: not a ton of extrinsic value left but he
362.32s: had enough that it would have been
363.44s: literally like 3 or4 million just vanish
366.44s: so he could have exercise some he could
368.96s: have
369.72s: not to me as of right now it looks like
372.20s: he didn't exercise again it's just my
373.60s: best guess he could have exercised it's
375.08s: no way really to know I have a video
376.84s: actually my last video that talks
378.60s: through that exact scenario the fact
379.88s: that like nobody can actually know but
382.04s: anyways the reason why all that matters
383.44s: is because the fact that we didn't see
386.40s: much of a move on Friday from this and
389.96s: it doesn't look like there's a ton of
391.64s: squeezing happening just yet and
393.52s: sometimes stuff like that can take time
394.96s: to build up what I'm highlighting is
398.60s: that there's no clear massive Catalyst
402.04s: that I can see right now that leads to
405.40s: this so this is interesting to me the
408.64s: reason for that is because this isn't
410.08s: even an earnings release this is
411.56s: literally a shareholders meeting the
414.16s: fact that implied volatility is this
416.32s: high for a shareholders meeting is
420.08s: freaking fascinating to me that is not
422.76s: common at all this is almost like what
424.32s: you would expect to see from a biotech
425.88s: stock that's going through some sort of
427.64s: FDA approval phase really really
429.68s: interesting so who knows but what I can
432.48s: tell you again objectively speaking
434.92s: massive massive call IV skew that's
437.88s: pricing in an upside move that's that's
440.08s: literally what I can see here what that
442.44s: actually means in terms of what happens
443.84s: this week nobody knows absolutely nobody
445.88s: knows and I'm not trying to get
448.08s: anybody's hopes up or put anybody's
449.56s: hopes down again just trying to call it
451.28s: as I see it all right let's talk about
453.32s: this last thing that somebody was cool
455.56s: enough to send in and it's this meme
458.04s: which is actually pretty hilarious as I
459.52s: think about it let me blow it up just a
461.36s: little bit and essentially this is
464.44s: talking about a little bit of the
466.44s: problem with buying far out of the money
468.52s: calls and a lot of new people that trade
471.00s: options this guy is thinking that's a
473.96s: good move but then there are a couple
476.32s: components and actually this isn't fully
478.00s: accurate either and I'll explain why but
481.04s: there's a couple components to this that
483.68s: make this not as appealing as it might
486.12s: seem and I want to explain to you why
488.56s: again so that you can make informed
490.52s: decisions so let's take a look at what
493.80s: this how this goes first I want to show
496.20s: you these two little graphs I guess I
497.52s: can leave them up like that they might
499.44s: look like gibberish don't worry about it
500.76s: I'm going to explain exactly what they
501.76s: mean let's focus on this right now this
504.32s: is looking at something where the spot
506.04s: price is kind of essentially right in
507.88s: the middle here and this is showing you
510.16s: two different expiration Cycles 31 days
512.32s: to expiration 325 notice the longer term
515.52s: expiration cycle has this nice gentle
517.72s: slope and notice how the 31 DTE starts
520.16s: to have this really steep slope and if
522.08s: we look at this coming expiration cycle
523.88s: it's 5 days so it's a very very small
526.32s: subset of this so this would be like
527.96s: almost purely vertical here's what's
530.60s: happening here's what this is telling
532.16s: you options have to make a choice either
536.00s: they're going to be in the money with
537.84s: intrinsic value or they're going to be
539.76s: out of the money and worth nothing at
542.08s: expiration so options that are out of
544.44s: the money are all extrinsic value which
547.16s: is time value and volatility essentially
549.12s: those are the two components for
550.84s: extrinsic value when we look at
552.80s: intrinsic value that's simply how far in
555.00s: the money something is so for the call
557.28s: side again notice this shaded area this
560.24s: is just telling you if you look at the
561.76s: price of GameStop again when it close
564.60s: 2870 all of these strikes that are below
568.20s: GameStop spot price those calls are in
570.16s: the money those have intrinsic and
573.20s: extrinsic value but something happens
576.04s: when we go let me kill some of these
577.60s: strikes so it's a little easier to see
579.88s: when we go further in the money we have
583.00s: more and more intrinsic value and less
586.00s: extrinsic value a quick cheat code you
588.92s: can use that works in most scenarios now
591.32s: GameStop it doesn't work quite perfect
593.52s: or near as perfect simply because this
596.36s: is such a skewed environment in terms of
599.12s: all ility but it's a good general rule
601.76s: that you can use anyways which is if you
603.84s: want to know how much extrinsic value is
606.28s: left for a deep in the money option you
608.32s: can just look across the aisle and look
609.96s: at the corresponding out of the money
612.40s: option so what that typically would look
614.64s: like for this 22 strike if I look at you
617.32s: know this it's obviously a few bucks in
619.48s: the money like $6 or so how much EX
622.44s: transic value do these options have left
624.44s: one you could do the math literally you
626.00s: could just take the difference between
628.00s: spot price strike price price and then
631.04s: refer that to the premium that's
632.80s: extrinsic value or you can just look at
635.88s: this out of the money so this looks like
637.88s: 25 26 Cents of EX transic value left in
640.88s: these options something like that okay
643.76s: deeper in the money you go the less
645.76s: extrinsic value you have now further out
649.72s: of the money you go it's actually the
651.52s: same thing and why it's cu the options
654.52s: are cheaper and cheaper and cheaper
655.92s: there's only 25 cents of extrinsic value
658.48s: in these 105 they're just very very
660.24s: cheap why does that matter well because
663.20s: when Theta decays the Theta Decay curve
666.72s: is highest for options that are at the
669.72s: money because there's the most extrinsic
672.84s: value and Theta Decay actually slows
676.12s: down as you go deeper in the money
678.80s: because there's less extrinsic value and
681.28s: Theta DEC slows down when you go further
683.76s: out of the money because there's less
686.28s: extrinsic value that is at as a
689.80s: gross dollar amount so what I mean is if
692.36s: we look at Theta dek here for the at the
694.68s: Mony is it's like 40 cents if we go
698.00s: super far out of the money you'll notice
699.44s: it's all the way down to like 15 cents
701.68s: it essentially slows down a lot as a
704.08s: gross amount but if you look at it as a
707.84s: percentage of the remaining premium it's
711.40s: massive so if you do what a lot of new
714.68s: Traders do which is see oh I want cheap
717.56s: options I don't have a lot of money
719.36s: these options right here literally would
721.12s: cost me 28 bucks so I'll I'll buy those
724.20s: the probability of you getting a return
725.92s: on this is very very low you need a
728.80s: really big move and you need it fast
731.80s: because you only have 5 days before
733.72s: these are worth nothing and hey not to
737.04s: mention each time a day passes which
740.60s: they Decay is continuous by the way it's
742.44s: not just it's set and then the next day
744.92s: and then it comes out it's literally
746.36s: continuous um Decay on the options it's
748.84s: kind of HTI throughout the remaining
750.56s: time but if you look at this on a daily
754.16s: basis you're going to lose 15 cents out
756.40s: of your 28 so it means literally after
758.80s: one day passes you just essentially cut
761.48s: this in half that means that you now
764.16s: need an even bigger move before you can
766.52s: make money so this is why a lot of times
769.12s: when sophisticated Traders are trading
771.56s: calls we actually don't go super short
774.60s: in time and we don't go super far out of
777.04s: the money unless we're expecting a
779.24s: massive move if so then we would buy
781.20s: them we typically would call them
782.36s: something like kicker options but for me
784.92s: personally if I'm buying options I'm
787.00s: going to go at the very least typically
789.60s: two weeks 3 weeks out that's if it's
791.64s: like super short term for me the vast
794.16s: majority of my premium buying whether
795.96s: it's calls or puts is going to be
797.00s: greater than 60 days and why is that
799.84s: because of this if you notice this is
802.56s: looking at in at the money option how it
806.16s: sta decays over time and notice what
808.72s: happens essentially from 100 to 60 days
812.72s: this slope is not that big but then
814.80s: notice once you get within 60 days to 40
817.48s: 40 to 20 20 to 10 and then all the way
821.24s: in beta starts decaying super super fast
825.60s: on a relative basis to the remaining
827.44s: premium I don't want to get stuck in
829.68s: this because this is the price for your
832.44s: long gamma that's what you're trying to
834.24s: get is rapid appreciation of your option
837.48s: which you might not see so it's a way to
840.88s: not lose a bunch of money but you're
842.84s: probably going to lose a whole bunch of
844.28s: times before you might win once and You'
846.92s: have to manage it very very smartly in
849.00s: order to have a positively expecting
850.92s: scenario so I really really like this
855.04s: post because it's reminding people that
858.12s: what looks really appealing AKA super
860.48s: cheap options actually have a lot going
862.64s: on underneath the surface that make them
864.72s: very difficult to make money with the
866.88s: last thing I'll say is the further out
868.44s: of the money you go the lower your Delta
871.00s: is and for those that don't know Delta
873.20s: is simply the rate of change of premium
876.08s: for one point move in the underlying so
878.32s: what that means is if GameStop goes up
880.12s: by a dollar these 42 calls have a Delta
883.60s: of 24 so if GameStop goes up by a dollar
886.60s: this premium will change by
888.32s: 24 whereas if you pay up a bit more and
891.68s: you're closer to at the money or even
893.32s: slightly in the money now if GameStop
896.48s: moves a dollar you see 50 cents of that
899.64s: move and if you're further in the money
902.16s: again more expensive still but now if
904.44s: GameStop goes a dollar instead of seeing
907.04s: 24 bucks you're going to see 80 bucks 80
910.44s: cents times 100 that's the multiplier
912.32s: for options contracts so it's a bit of a
915.52s: balance that's the cool part about
916.84s: options you get to set them up to be
918.44s: exactly what you want if you expect a
920.28s: big big massive move and you're super
922.40s: convicted you can go further out of the
924.12s: money and play the expansion of those
927.00s: Deltas or you can play a little more
929.44s: conservatively like I typically do I
931.28s: would go slightly in the money pay up
933.84s: for the options I would still have a
935.80s: management plan in place I at no point
938.00s: would expect to just hold these into
940.28s: expiration because then you do run the
942.28s: risk of losing more money if these fall
944.00s: out of the money I wouldn't want that to
946.60s: happen but you can get stuff that's in
948.96s: the money get a better Delta for dollar
951.48s: move based on what you put in a little
953.76s: more expensive and then you could also
955.72s: add a couple kicker options maybe like a
958.12s: 20 Delta something like that in case you
960.12s: get that big move but if you get a bit
962.88s: of a move but not big enough in order to
965.08s: make a bunch of money you can still walk
966.84s: out with a bit of a profit by having a
969.08s: slightly higher Delta it's a completely
971.16s: completely intricate game to play and
973.60s: this is why options are so cool to me
975.56s: because they're a puzzle that you get to
976.96s: solve for yourself depending on what you
978.64s: want to do but this is such a great
983.32s: point if you buy Super far out of the
985.68s: money calls or puts super far out of the
987.40s: money options the vast majority of the
988.96s: the time you were just lighting that
990.00s: money on fire difficult to make money
992.12s: that way so as always if there's
993.68s: anything else you want me to take a look
994.96s: at with respect to options I'm happy to
998.04s: help and jump in as much as I can I'm
