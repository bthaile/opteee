2.36s: what's up everyone welcome back to the
4.36s: outlier podcast I have my friend Joe
7.56s: here and you and I connected what like
9.76s: two years ago or something like that now
11.68s: it's been a while man yeah yeah I I like
14.28s: originally reached out to you when I
15.80s: first started YouTube just to try to
17.88s: like figure out how to not completely
20.32s: dork everything up as I've done anyways
23.08s: you know against your best advice so I
25.44s: guess I am a poor to tutelage in that
28.72s: sense but I am am absolutely stoked to
31.80s: connect with you a little bit and you
33.68s: bring a different perspective than what
35.96s: a lot of my standard audiences used to
37.64s: seeing so as we were talking about right
39.32s: before we started recording a lot of
41.00s: like active trading derivatives style
43.40s: stuff and you spread a pretty wide gamut
46.96s: of things and I know a lot of what I see
50.00s: on your channel is kind of like the
51.04s: dividend investing side of things that
53.16s: seems to be um something your your
55.44s: audience likes a lot so I'd love to
58.20s: start with a general ized backgrounds
61.80s: obviously you spent some time in the
63.60s: Marine crops which is how we came into
66.84s: contact together and then um so I'd love
69.08s: to learn a little bit more about your
70.28s: military experience and then making the
71.80s: transition from there sure sure well uh
74.56s: yeah uh spent time in the Marine Corp as
76.72s: that armor uh got out in 2001 uh you
80.12s: know just before just before it really
81.96s: hit the fan obviously uh and uh you know
85.44s: always knew I
86.76s: liked making my money work for me right
89.48s: you know corpal in the Marine Corp
90.76s: doesn't get doesn't make a whole lot of
92.28s: money so uh so you you got to have that
94.44s: money working for you so I I got really
96.60s: heavy into uh investing of course 2001
99.84s: 2002 this was just as the the real
101.72s: estate bubble was starting to inflate so
104.36s: everybody was getting making money in
106.00s: real estate and and I wanted a piece of
108.00s: that action so I got started um you know
110.32s: went back to school went back to college
112.64s: and um got my degrees there finance and
115.24s: communication studies and you know
117.20s: started on the real estate side as a
118.72s: real estate analyst uh of course that
120.96s: all blew up in 200 um you know 2007 2008
125.40s: and of course it's it's weird because
127.76s: you know my professional career the the
130.44s: career the career path that I thought I
132.16s: was going to take into real estate as an
134.00s: analyst and investor in that blew up
136.44s: just as the uh you know when I just
139.16s: first started investing in
141.16s: 1999 uh you know blew up uh as well so
144.52s: so I seem to to have a knack for finding
146.96s: things making an inflection point in my
148.52s: life and then it just blowing up
150.12s: completely uh so we're still waiting for
152.16s: the the third act on that one but anyway
154.48s: so I you know I spent some time in real
156.44s: estate you know when that all blew up I
158.40s: kind of transitioned into Equity
160.36s: analysis so stock analysis I worked in a
163.20s: venture capital firm for C in a Canadian
166.20s: Venture Capital firm set up their sside
168.08s: division and worked that so I was a
170.04s: professional analyst for for about 10
171.76s: years and then finally decided you know
174.52s: these 80 100 hour work weeks were were
176.84s: for the Bulls uh so you know I I I
180.40s: started kind of freelancing while I was
182.04s: building up my digital assets my my
183.80s: online business with blogs and then
185.72s: finally with YouTube uh really trying to
187.96s: build my own assets and something that I
190.12s: actually owned right because you know
192.32s: anyone that's you know anyone in finance
194.88s: they could tell you they work their
195.84s: balls off but uh they own nothing right
198.80s: so they have to constantly be grinding
200.76s: that wheel so I so I built up my online
203.44s: assets and and here we are you know I
205.24s: love talking about stocks still love
207.32s: watching my money grow and and having it
209.04s: work for me and and I love being able to
211.20s: bring that that professional Equity
212.92s: analyst background to YouTube where you
215.56s: know you don't you don't often get
216.84s: something like that um probably probably
220.40s: a little bit longer term uh investing
222.40s: style than uh than than what a lot of
225.08s: lot of people are I like to I do like to
226.92s: swing trade so you know three three
229.48s: months one year kind of kind of Trades
231.96s: uh but then beyond that kind of try to
234.12s: take it easy and just let let the money
235.68s: work work its way out um you know so I
238.84s: use I use options for swing trading but
241.56s: also for hedging longer term you know
243.60s: and then uh Futures uh probably usually
247.00s: usually Futures only in the Forex sense
250.48s: so you know times like now where the
252.08s: dollar is completely ridiculously
254.40s: overvalued and it has been for for the
256.48s: better part of a year then I'll put on a
258.48s: Futures trade uh you know short the
259.96s: dollar uh into some other stuff but then
262.60s: uh but mostly it's just just stocks you
264.44s: know stocks for the long term growth
266.12s: stocks I do everybody likes to make that
268.64s: cash money on the dividend
270.32s: but uh it's kind of hard to get rich
271.68s: with dividends so uh so I kind of stick
274.16s: to the the gross stocks tech stocks
276.32s: things that are going to multiply your
277.56s: money get that portfolio to the point
279.08s: where you need it so you can be living
281.00s: off your dividends one
282.76s: day bunch of questions um yeah the so
287.08s: the very first one not Market related
289.40s: yet did you think at any point that you
292.64s: were going to like be a YouTuber did
297.20s: that ever cross your mind sure well I
300.24s: mean we didn't even there wasn't a
301.68s: YouTube until 2006 so right you know so
304.24s: I was I was already uh you know 30 years
307.24s: 30 years old before YouTube was a thing
309.80s: right and then uh and even then it was
312.40s: for gamers and I don't know weirdos you
314.96s: know for 14y olds that would 14y olds
317.76s: that would soon become you know the
319.12s: biggest YouTuber in the world right I
321.28s: think Mr Beast had his in 2006 2008
323.60s: something like that uh but uh yeah no I
326.08s: didn't I I started blogging in 2013
329.84s: right when I uh you know finished on my
331.88s: Equity analyst career really trying to
333.52s: start building those online assets and I
336.08s: started the YouTube channel in 2015 but
338.32s: only as a way to uh put videos you know
341.32s: host videos on YouTube so I could put
343.12s: them on my website so people could watch
345.44s: them on the website and you know spend a
346.72s: little bit more time there um didn't
348.28s: really think much of it until you know I
349.96s: saw a huge huge spike in uh in hits one
353.16s: day to my to to the website and what had
355.08s: happened is you know a friend of mine
356.76s: had that with a YouTube channel had
358.40s: talked about one of my one of my my
359.88s: posts and sent massive amounts of
361.84s: traffic so I was like well and this
363.60s: was 2017 by the way two years after I
366.44s: had actually started the YouTube channel
368.56s: hadn't really done anything I think I
369.88s: had 10 videos on it in two years and I
373.08s: thought okay well you know YouTube is a
374.76s: thing I guess so so I started in 201
377.16s: 2017 uh December 2017 really putting
380.00s: videos on there for YouTube sake uh to
382.44s: build that part of the business and it's
384.44s: pretty much all YouTube now you know I
386.00s: love the face to face you get with
387.44s: people on YouTube you just don't get
389.16s: that and vlogging or even in podcasting
391.84s: if you're not you know recording the
393.12s: video and posting it somewhere so I love
395.44s: that sense of community you get with
397.04s: with YouTube really being face to face
398.60s: with people yeah it's fascinating the
401.08s: the reason why I asked that question too
402.44s: is because I find my for forray into
405.24s: YouTube very similar and I'm I'm always
406.96s: wondering how other people came into it
409.68s: quick story that I think is kind of
411.96s: funny we had a be infestation outside my
414.52s: window here so called a beekeeper came
416.52s: out helped us with the bees as he's
418.52s: leaving he like looked at me and he was
420.16s: just like are you like a YouTuber or
422.28s: something and at that point I never
425.32s: touched any social media I didn't even
427.08s: have an Instagram so I thought it was
428.64s: the funniest thing on earth I was like
430.48s:  no like who's on like why do you
432.72s: think I would be on YouTube right like
434.52s: just so crazy to me no by the next
438.28s: year I had started a YouTube channel and
441.20s: had been Off to the Races so this
442.44s: freaking you were but you were you were
445.04s: podcasting right at that point so you
446.52s: had the the setup no you just he just
448.80s: asked if you were that's kind of crazy
450.60s: out of out of the blue yeah the the main
453.08s: thing is like we're fortunate so we live
454.56s: in a nice house in a nice area and I
457.28s: looked a little younger than I do now so
459.68s: I think he saw younger dude in a nice
462.24s: place and he was curious like how that
463.76s: happened right that's pretty common out
466.56s: in in California at least but it's just
468.88s: so funny to me that like I thought that
470.60s: was the most ridiculous thing on planet
472.36s: Earth and should have told him no I just
474.64s: married a sugar mama there you go I I
476.60s: told him I told him I was a prostitute
478.24s: that's my go-to whenever anybody asks me
480.72s: what I do I Pro because if you think
482.24s: about
483.48s: it which is crazy because because that's
486.56s: the more legitimate answer than yeah I'm
488.76s: a YouTuber people still think can you
491.44s: make money on that is that a thing
493.24s: they're like oh yeah that makes sense
494.60s: you sell your body I get it I mean my
497.32s: argument there is I feel like in a
499.36s: nutshell we all are prostitutes because
503.40s: we're exchanging I'm and effort for
506.72s: money just different kinds of effort but
510.04s: okay yeah I think I guess you could make
511.88s: that case for many many other careers
514.48s: but uh you know that they're they're
516.16s: somehow prostituting their anyway that's
519.60s: exactly it but I I just find that so
522.36s: funny because a lot of the people that I
524.64s: find that are doing really cool things
526.08s: on YouTube like you seem to just come
529.12s: across it randomly right like you
530.44s: started your YouTube channel it's two
532.56s: years 10 videos weren't doing anything
534.20s: and then all of a sudden you know your
535.52s: friend dropped you and it started taking
538.24s: off you're like okay I guess I'll do
539.68s: this too like that's so cool I love that
541.92s: it's it's totally random uh and the you
545.40s: know I will say I was fortunate enough
547.04s: to start in7 start relatively early you
549.68s: know even even 11 years after YouTube
551.92s: started it was still relatively early
553.56s: and I had that benefit uh and it's it is
556.16s: more competitive now but it is still
558.84s: really early it feels it feels like you
560.84s: know it there's even even at something
563.20s: like 26 million channels on YouTube uh
566.12s: it is still an early time to start a
567.84s: YouTube channel so for anyone out there
569.72s: that uh you know just wants to be heard
571.44s: wants to make some money uh and wants to
573.40s: have you know wants to build something
574.96s: then YouTube is still the place the
576.84s: place to be yeah I I couldn't agree more
579.68s: with that I mean it's what the second
580.96s: largest search engine right now and the
584.08s: the the cool part about YouTube is even
586.16s: though there definitely is saturation
588.60s: what I've come to appreciate is that
590.80s: there are areas for you to carve out for
593.92s: like your personality your brand and
596.64s: what you do because somebody like you
600.04s: even though YouTube started in ' 06 or
602.80s: whatever and at that point it was brand
604.24s: new you you had already been doing the
606.08s: finance thing for some time before that
608.24s: even started right so like you're coming
609.84s: to a place with a significant amount of
612.16s: experience that even though a brand new
614.72s: YouTuber might have really good
615.92s: marketing now they don't have the
617.00s: experience you do so that that that part
619.84s: always provides a pretty strong
622.60s: differentiation which leads me to my
624.88s: follow on so I would love to know more
628.08s: about your your experience what you did
632.00s: and the overall perception you had of
636.24s: working at the VC firm and Equity
639.08s: analysis so you can start from the very
642.00s: beginning specifically why that place
645.00s: and then just kind of go from there sure
646.88s: sure well Equity analysis I mean anytime
649.12s: you start anybody starting Equity anal
652.32s: as an equity analyst uh you always start
654.28s: as an associate which is basically a
656.00s: peon uh not only are you going to you
658.52s: know the Gopher going to get everything
660.24s: for everyone uh but you're also really
663.04s: just doing cash flow modeling right
664.60s: you're sitting in front of a computer
665.96s: screen um nine 10 hours a day at least
669.92s: minimum uh basically on an Excel
671.84s: spreadsheet and modeling out a company's
674.44s: cash flows right uh you know everybody
676.32s: likes to follow income uh net income uh
679.08s: that's you know PE ratios all that kind
681.16s: of crap that's on CNBC uh it's easy but
684.12s: that's not really where where investment
686.16s: analysis comes from investment analysis
688.64s: uh you know the way they do it is really
691.08s: modeling those cash flows you know how
693.28s: much Ca a free cash flow do the company
695.84s: have how much is it going to be able to
697.40s: spin out to uh to investors uh you know
700.04s: theoretically if it wasn't saving it
701.76s: saving it back for growth um and what's
703.96s: the value of that you know all those
705.36s: future cash flows what's the value of
707.24s: that in the present and how does that uh
709.32s: on a per share basis so you're basically
712.28s: just kind of you know a grunt uh you
714.80s: know to put to put it in a a term we
716.76s: both know you're basically just a grunt
718.92s: uh for on Excel uh for yeah 10 hours a
722.28s: day uh forever forever it seems uh year
725.48s: and a half two years then you get follow
728.36s: so sorry to interrupt you I just want to
729.76s: follow up on that first part first so
732.72s: nine to 10 hours a day working on cash
735.56s: flow analysis can you walk me through
738.36s: like functionally what you're actually
741.16s: doing 9 to 10 hours during the day like
743.36s: are you going to websites are you trying
745.32s: like what are you functionally doing
746.80s: during that time frame sure well at a
749.28s: lot of it goes the financial statements
751.32s: right uh you know and a great if anybody
754.16s: wants to learn real uh real investment
756.92s: analysis you know the way the way they
759.00s: do it uh to be able to to recommend
760.92s: stocks and all that uh pick up at your
763.12s: local library and all all copies of the
765.32s: CFA curriculum right the charter Charter
767.32s: financial analyst uh you you'll go in
769.44s: there and they've got you know
770.64s: everything from uh I mean it's a stack
772.76s: of books like like that right uh for
775.76s: each year there's three levels of it but
777.64s: you can do first level second level uh
779.72s: get those books and they'll walk you
781.36s: through everything from economic
782.84s: analysis macro level analysis all that
785.36s: but the real the real bed bread and
786.84s: butter there is financial statement
788.32s: analysis right it's you go into the the
790.52s: income statement the balance sheet and
792.08s: the cash flow statement uh and really
794.64s: again you're you're looking at what the
796.40s: company has reported in the past you
798.36s: know the past five years or so uh and
800.52s: then you're trying to model out into the
802.60s: future what the future looks like and of
804.60s: course so one you've got management
806.32s: expectations uh what they're saying on
808.76s: uh analyst calls quarterly reports what
811.24s: they're saying in their corporate
812.68s: corporate presentations what they're not
814.16s: saying is a lot of times uh very telling
816.88s: right so and what happens is analysts uh
820.88s: you don't really most people don't
822.24s: realize it but analysts usually only
823.76s: cover maybe a few Industries or one or
826.60s: two sectors right uh because you have to
828.80s: get very good uh at those two those
831.88s: Industries or those sectors right so you
833.60s: might be a consumer staples analyst or
835.40s: you might be a a hardware Tech Hardware
837.92s: analyst or something like that and you
839.88s: get to know everything you can about the
842.24s: tech Hardware industry right um so you
845.36s: you you not only follow that company but
847.24s: you follow all the companies in the
848.56s: industry so five six 10 companies in
851.24s: that industry you learn okay what do
853.16s: they typically talk about uh on their an
855.40s: analyst calls what are the uh what are
857.92s: the metrics that uh really go with that
860.48s: industry you know what kind of growth is
862.20s: average what kind of growth is medium uh
864.16s: what what their inventories look like
865.84s: what their inventory spending looks like
868.04s: and uh and with that you know you get a
869.80s: feel for like I said what they are
871.68s: talking about and what they're not
872.84s: talking about you know if they're if uh
875.32s: all the other all the other competitors
877.60s: in the industry are talking about you
879.60s: know Day sales out outstanding or uh
882.00s: some of the other inventory measures and
884.40s: there it's conspicuously absent in you
887.04s: know whenever management talks about it
888.56s: at this other company then you kind of
890.00s: Wonder okay you know why aren't they
891.56s: talking about it uh and you you research
893.40s: a little bit further so you're looking
895.16s: at financial statements all day you're
897.08s: you're digging through the notes to the
898.36s: financial statements to see how they're
899.88s: accounting for things on those financial
901.84s: statements CU you know even though
903.68s: there's U we call Gap generally accepted
906.28s: accounting principles kind of guidances
908.12s: for how companies need to uh use need to
911.44s: account for different things like
912.84s: revenue and expenses um there's a lot of
915.64s: leeway in there that companies have
917.04s: found you know ways around to make their
919.20s: own uh you know accounts look better or
921.52s: or or or something so you dig you're
924.76s: digging through those uh and then again
927.36s: you you know you're trying to model out
929.08s: what they've done in the past what uh
931.72s: you know maybe maybe your macro people
933.44s: because usually a lot of times your your
935.24s: analysts they're just doing those cash
937.04s: flow models and the financial statement
939.00s: analysis then the firm has you know
941.00s: maybe macr level people so economic uh
943.16s: people that are saying okay the general
944.60s: economy is going to grow this much over
946.60s: the next three to five years uh and
948.64s: you've got kind of models that say Okay
951.04s: um you know if the general economy grows
953.00s: if GDP grows 2 to 3% then uh we can
956.56s: probably see maybe seven to 10% or 15%
960.52s: growth in this industry right uh and
963.52s: you've got other industry analysts uh
965.32s: telling you that as well so you're
966.64s: applying some of those numbers that you
968.28s: have as well as what management at all
970.72s: 10 of these companies in the industry
972.24s: are saying uh and you're trying to model
974.20s: out okay what do I think sales are going
975.80s: to be for each of these 10 companies in
977.48s: the industry uh who's got the better uh
979.60s: expense management what are their
981.16s: expenses are going to be who is uh you
983.20s: know has Capital expenditures that are
985.16s: just running away and uh maybe that's
987.24s: going to deflate their earnings a little
988.76s: bit so you're really trying to get a
990.52s: feel for you know what earnings what net
993.36s: income is going to be over the next uh
995.28s: over the next 5 years you're modeling
997.08s: out their cash flows again very
998.68s: important that you uh adjust the income
1001.16s: statement to their cash flows which is
1003.80s: you know because okay the income
1005.20s: statement is uh all those accounting
1007.20s: shenanigans that everybody everybody
1009.28s: uses and nobody really says anything
1011.88s: until something goes wrong right until
1013.60s: you got a super micro computer and
1015.60s: somebody calls them out on it and the
1017.28s: stock falls apart you know every does
1019.40s: those kinds of accounting Shenanigans
1021.20s: those manipulations uh to make their
1023.00s: revenue look higher their expenses look
1024.76s: lower and make their net income look
1026.16s: better but nobody ever really says
1027.96s: anything because it's a game Everybody
1029.76s: Plays and everybody knows it um so
1032.64s: you're kind of trying to a kind of
1033.92s: trying to think through okay the income
1035.72s: statement has all these accounting
1037.56s: Shenanigans these manipulations on it
1039.28s: the cash flow statement is actual cash
1041.72s: generated by operations cash spent uh in
1045.00s: Investments and that free cash flow that
1046.92s: you know is basically theoretically what
1049.32s: kind of cash the company has left over
1051.76s: after after paying their Capital
1053.04s: expenditures from their operating cash
1054.60s: flow so you're really trying to tie
1056.44s: those two statements together and see
1058.80s: what that cash flow looks like and and
1060.80s: really you know who's which companies
1063.76s: are the better at it in this industry in
1066.24s: your in your industry right so again you
1068.40s: know it's a lot of work you're you're
1070.00s: looking through uh industry reports
1072.08s: you're following if there's any industry
1073.56s: magazines or uh you know industry
1076.48s: research you're following that so it's
1078.44s: not really I mean you're not just
1079.80s: sitting at your desk watching an Excel
1082.20s: screen all day long you're building up
1084.60s: all this information this research that
1086.28s: goes into okay you know what's a uh
1088.64s: what's a good rate of growth for uh for
1090.92s: sales for a company that has this kind
1092.60s: of market share who has the market share
1095.12s: in the in the industry and how is that
1096.76s: changing among companies uh so it's I
1099.56s: mean it that's why that's why Equity
1101.56s: analysts get paid a lot of money right
1103.76s: so uh but it's also it's also a lot of
1105.96s: work you know uh it's reading in the in
1108.44s: the wall Journal uh probably last week
1111.08s: and it kind of kind of brought a lot of
1112.56s: realities or a lot of memories back to
1114.36s: me uh because it was all about you know
1116.68s: the uh the hours of work in in
1119.04s: Investment Banking and Equity anal
1120.88s: analysis and how a lot of these these
1122.52s: Junior bankers and and Junior analysts
1124.56s: are uh being overworked of course we we
1127.36s: never said we were overworked when we
1128.80s: were you know back in the back in the
1130.48s: early 2000s and the the the that time uh
1133.84s: but and how they're coping with it with
1135.68s: you know uh ADHD medic
1139.28s: and Red Bull Red Bull laced with Rin and
1142.84s: all that kind of good stuff um so it's
1145.32s: it's just kind of a fact of life for uh
1147.52s: you know for bankers and for for Equity
1149.36s: analysts um so you know I did that I did
1152.32s: that for a few
1153.48s: years figured out that uh that you know
1155.88s: I wanted a little bit of change I wanted
1157.72s: to in something a little bit uh you know
1160.48s: prior to equity analyst analysis so I I
1163.36s: started uh started looking at Venture
1164.88s: Capital worked on Venture Capital firm
1166.72s: for a couple years and then was hired by
1169.00s: a Canadian Venture Capital firm called
1170.52s: high alert Partners to put together
1172.52s: their cide division so I managed a team
1174.92s: of about six other analysts and we kind
1177.24s: of analyzed stocks and analyzed uh you
1179.48s: know other uh pre-ipo private companies
1182.48s: for the for the owner and and kind of uh
1184.84s: drove drove business that
1187.24s: way
1189.32s: fascinating and so first off thank you
1191.72s: for the detail on just what the the
1194.44s: day-to-day looks like so I think that's
1195.84s: one of the things that a lot of people
1197.20s: that don't work in the industry never
1198.92s: get a sense of unless they have an
1200.96s: opportunity to talk to somebody like you
1202.88s: so I mean you you watch CNBC or or
1206.00s: YouTube I mean I think more people get
1207.84s: their their stock picks and information
1210.00s: from YouTube now than CNBC but but you
1212.08s: watch and you watch these guys myself
1214.12s: included I never go into that much
1215.68s: detail I mean I do a lot of the work
1217.32s: behind the scenes but I don't go into
1218.64s: that much detail as far as okay this is
1220.88s: why I'm picking this stock I've modeled
1222.32s: out these five years of cash flow for
1223.88s: this company I think it looks great I
1225.56s: think it's worth much more than people
1227.08s: are paying for the shares right now so
1228.96s: you can get a sense that it is just that
1230.92s: easy you just oh you know hey look at
1234.16s: the the biggest thing I hate on YouTube
1235.68s: right now is is just the chart board
1237.88s: right people look oh man look at Nvidia
1240.32s: look at that chart right there that
1242.36s: looks beautiful buy that it must be it
1244.96s: must be going that that way in the
1246.32s: future um but that's what a lot of
1248.60s: YouTube is now where it's just that
1249.88s: chart porn that people you know you know
1253.12s: finger finger F in your the the chart
1256.68s: and and thinking it thinking it's going
1258.36s: to could keep on going just like that uh
1261.00s: so so yeah you you people don't get a
1263.24s: sense that of what investing really is
1265.92s: and how you know how how professional it
1268.64s: can actually be if you actually actually
1270.60s: are doing the work behind it yeah but
1273.04s: it's much easier just to be degenerate
1274.60s: and just say stons go up and then just
1276.92s: yeah yeah goad yeah and I I don't know I
1280.04s: mean I I guess I I've benefited from the
1282.96s: ease of having a YouTube channel just as
1285.00s: much as anyone right uh you know you
1287.76s: don't need you don't need experience all
1289.28s: you need is a camera and camera and an
1291.56s: opinion and and that's great to to you
1293.80s: know bring more people give people the
1295.80s: opportunity to have a business of their
1297.72s: own but uh but yeah it's it's not not
1300.88s: the greatest not the best way to uh to
1302.68s: invest if uh if that's all you're doing
1304.68s: is following a chart up or or uh you
1307.88s: know just following easy stuff like the
1309.64s: PE Ratio and saying oh well this is a
1311.64s: cheap stock it must be a good deal which
1314.36s: is interesting are you familiar with um
1316.76s: Wesley Gray's work in momentum
1319.68s: no so he he's uh he's a Marine dude um
1323.08s: solid solid guy and he runs Alpha
1325.88s: architect which is a big ETF fund um but
1329.60s: anyways he is a momentum junkie that's
1333.08s: what he spent a lot of time on his PhD
1334.84s: working on and he's come up with a lot
1339.08s: of different factors with respect to
1341.32s: momentum frog and the pan concept the
1344.00s: cliffnotes version to this whole thing
1346.12s: is one of the dominant factors with
1348.72s: respect to momentum is obviously an X
1352.68s: period lagging return so 6 months 12
1356.16s: months both tend to be pretty
1357.80s: efficacious and they tend to resist the
1361.16s: short-term turnaround effect of other
1363.00s: things that 3 months has a strong
1364.72s: turnaround effect but what they found is
1366.72s: when you overlay that with some of these
1369.76s: fundamental indicators like you're
1370.92s: talking about like PE Ratio or PEG ratio
1373.56s: or free cash flow that it can like
1376.80s: massively improve the performance of the
1378.64s: system which is interesting but funny
1380.36s: enough PE ratio just as you pointed out
1382.68s: is actually one of the the less
1384.64s: informative overlays that you can input
1386.88s: which is interesting that you've also
1388.20s: mentioned in that there well sure
1389.56s: because you know earnings by the by the
1391.04s: time earnings come from the income
1392.80s: statement right and by the time you get
1394.48s: down from revenue all the way down to
1396.12s: earnings you've got so much in
1397.84s: there as far as accounting manipulations
1399.96s: and shenanigans that you don't know what
1401.76s: earnings really are you know there are
1403.84s: all kinds of ways to uh speed up your
1406.24s: Revenue recognition you know as far as
1408.56s: contracts that might be signed or may
1410.88s: may not be signed and and all kinds of
1413.24s: ways to uh you know basically you're
1415.56s: giving out credit where where where you
1417.88s: know you're not going to be paid on that
1419.24s: but you're recognizing that revenue and
1421.48s: anyway there's there's all kinds of ways
1422.96s: to make that earnings look so much
1424.36s: better than it actually is uh so you
1426.64s: know if you want to use maybe a bit
1428.60s: better one it be like price to cash flow
1430.76s: that kind of thing but yeah you know I
1432.60s: agree I don't use technical analysis a
1434.32s: whole lot or or kind of momentum
1436.44s: analysis but a great way to do it is
1439.40s: yeah using that as a buy or sell as a
1441.48s: indicator a buy or or sell point for the
1443.52s: stocks that you've done the fundamental
1444.88s: analysis on and and you know you want to
1447.04s: buy the stock but you want to know okay
1448.72s: when is good when is a good time when is
1450.28s: a good price uh and and that technical
1452.44s: analysis can be a great a great way to
1454.92s: say okay yeah you know uh now now is the
1458.16s: time to to start buying you're going to
1460.08s: have uh the laging returns tend to be
1462.28s: good on that and uh and the long-term
1465.20s: returns are are good on your fundamental
1467.16s: analysis yeah yeah it's it's really
1470.04s: interesting to see the cross-section
1471.44s: between analysis because I always find
1473.52s: it interesting when when both Traders
1475.40s: and investors they'll they'll kind of
1476.84s: poo poo on one or the other they'll say
1478.48s: oh this is trash or this is trash and I
1480.24s: always always think it's like why would
1482.04s: I close one eye when I have two eyes
1485.04s: right like use them both um now going
1489.12s: back though to your transition from
1493.28s: specifically Equity analysis into the VC
1496.92s: build outside of things
1499.24s: what made you make that transition and
1502.08s: what were some of the larger
1504.00s: differentiators in your daytoday between
1507.24s: those two jobs okay well I think you
1509.88s: know I mean first you look at the money
1511.92s: people are making right uh so Venture
1514.04s: Capital uh you're you're getting in much
1516.04s: earlier than uh Equity guys uh right so
1519.64s: you know you're getting in and back then
1521.80s: you early 2000s and that was and mid
1525.24s: 2000s uh I think there were there were
1527.72s: more opportun unities in venture capital
1529.40s: and pre-ipo investing than there are now
1531.60s: right now there there's just so much
1533.12s: money floating around uh that uh
1535.64s: companies are staying private for so
1537.40s: long that it could be you know 5 10 15
1540.40s: years before you get an exit basically
1542.28s: for the lot of these private companies
1543.68s: you're you're investing in a company the
1545.52s: idea is that it's going to uh you know
1548.28s: have maybe four or five funding rounds
1550.36s: uh investment rounds into it and then
1552.44s: they'll look for an exit right either to
1554.24s: uh sell the company to through an
1556.16s: acquisition to a bigger company or
1557.96s: they'll an
1559.08s: IPO and generally you can do uh I mean
1562.20s: very very good returns uh there's a
1564.60s: there's a study by Will University that
1566.80s: uh that looks at Angel Investing
1568.72s: portfolios uh on a rolling you know
1570.92s: rolling uh four-year uh period and uh
1574.80s: and found annualized returns about 24%
1578.36s: uh on those uh so very good and that's
1580.80s: even with about half the portfolio just
1583.12s: completely flopping right that it's one
1584.92s: of the just a fact of life for free IO
1587.48s: angel Venture Capital uh Investments is
1590.20s: that about half of them are just going
1591.36s: to bust uh you know those those
1593.20s: companies are going to going to just go
1594.60s: away uh but then you've got enough that
1596.60s: are 30 40 50 times your money that bring
1599.48s: it up to that 22 24 uh% annualized
1602.52s: return so very strong returns uh anymore
1605.04s: though you know you've got so much money
1607.92s: uh sloshing around just over the last
1610.16s: five years from from all the stimulus
1611.92s: and all that uh and going you know being
1614.28s: available to these pre IPO these private
1616.92s: companies that they're just staying
1619.08s: they're staying private forever I mean
1620.72s: you've got companies like uh you know I
1623.64s: think well you xai you've got uh you
1627.00s: know all of elon's companies right
1628.84s: you've got uh you know the there's a
1631.64s: couple other ones but you $60 billion
1633.92s: market cap hundred billion dollar market
1636.04s: cap uh you know valuation uh which is
1639.12s: just unheard of I mean these companies
1640.84s: you know we used to say a billion
1642.52s: dollars was you know a unicorn and a
1644.44s: good time to try try to go IPO uh and
1647.28s: you got companies just staying private
1648.88s: forever so there's no exit for those uh
1650.92s: for those people but anyway I kind of
1653.20s: digress there back back in the two early
1655.68s: 2000s mid-2000s I mean you were getting
1658.32s: much more frequent um much more frequent
1660.96s: exits for these companies uh and so you
1663.20s: know the investors and the people in on
1665.28s: those deals were making a lot more money
1667.28s: uh so I was kind of watching that you
1669.40s: know decided I wanted wanted to make a
1671.28s: lot more money you know wasn't
1672.40s: necessarily uh wasn't necessarily wasn't
1675.08s: necessarily a starving to death as an
1677.12s: equity analyst but but uh but you know
1679.36s: you're you're you're you're kind of
1680.88s: beating your brains out over that uh
1682.64s: Market return and maybe a little bit
1684.80s: higher uh so so I started looking into
1687.12s: that uh I really liked the idea of
1689.96s: getting in before you know uh everybody
1692.76s: else did right you get in pre-ipo you
1694.84s: get into those private companies uh I
1696.68s: liked the idea of you know a little bit
1698.52s: more a little bit more of a control uh
1702.80s: uh and ownership and and guiding guiding
1705.24s: ownership into the company a lot of VC
1707.56s: firms will will have uh people on as
1709.84s: Board of on the board of directors of
1711.60s: their Investments uh so there's always
1713.48s: an opportunity to join the board of of
1715.64s: one of these private companies and kind
1717.16s: of help guide it help steer it um and of
1719.48s: course that's you know that's always a
1721.12s: paid a paid thing also to be on a board
1723.08s: of directors and uh you know you get
1724.96s: more stock options and stuff like that
1726.60s: as well so I I just liked I liked a lot
1729.16s: of the the things in that uh but it's as
1732.08s: far as the work involved though it is it
1734.12s: is very similar though to an equity
1736.08s: analyst right especially especially when
1738.32s: you uh when you're first starting out as
1740.76s: a venture capital analyst it's it's
1742.60s: going to be very similar because
1744.00s: basically you're just taking taking that
1745.84s: company and uh you know looking at its
1747.60s: financial statements trying to project
1749.12s: something into the future uh but also uh
1752.36s: you've also got a little bit more of a
1753.84s: guiding and managerial uh role right
1756.80s: where you're trying to tell them okay
1758.24s: you know this is what's working in the
1759.72s: industry uh this is what's effed up
1762.44s: about your company right now and what's
1763.96s: holding it back and this is these are
1765.40s: the changes you should make uh so it's a
1767.64s: little bit detail a little bit more
1769.12s: in-depth a little bit more detailed and
1770.64s: managerial focused than an equity
1773.44s: analyst and which did you like
1776.20s: more I'd say the the V The Venture
1778.48s: Capital right uh you know again it gives
1780.92s: you a little bit more of an opportunity
1782.68s: to be uh you know I won't say the
1784.84s: manager because you're not actually
1785.96s: managing the company but you are you've
1787.88s: got your strategy hat on and you're
1789.92s: actually helping them to uh to run the
1791.80s: company better uh find new customers
1794.40s: find new suppliers really make that
1796.68s: company something that that could be you
1798.56s: know someday the next trillion or well I
1800.72s: won't say trillion dollar company but
1802.00s: the next you know the next billion
1803.52s: dollar company the next IPO big IPO and
1806.44s: uh something that's you know going to
1807.64s: pay off big because uh again those the
1811.08s: the big exits are fewer and far between
1813.56s: 30 40 50 times your money but when they
1816.12s: happen you know I mean that's just
1817.92s: that's just like the sun shining out
1819.48s: through the clouds you know 50 times
1821.04s: your money on on an investment uh it
1823.80s: really you know it really shows you why
1825.84s: you're in this business yeah that that
1828.28s: makes a ton of sense it also seems at
1830.36s: least for somebody like you probably a
1832.44s: better use of a diverse skill set
1834.60s: because you apply some of the technical
1836.28s: expertise but you also apply some of the
1837.84s: managerial side of things did you did
1840.40s: you like the managerial side or was that
1842.20s: kind of annoying and you prefer the more
1843.72s: technical stuff
1845.04s: or different than that sure no I liked
1849.16s: obviously when when you're used to and
1851.44s: at this point in my career I was still
1852.72s: fairly new uh you know I had just been
1855.32s: associate in in uh in equity analysis
1858.24s: and and I was still doing you know the
1861.08s: the gr the grunt work in these you know
1862.80s: the Excel spreadsheets the deep deep
1864.84s: research uh so it is it is always nice
1867.40s: to be able to break break out part of
1869.12s: your day to uh to really look at
1870.92s: something a little bit bigger picture
1872.56s: right and you know sit on the board of a
1874.40s: company and and have those that
1876.08s: networking that you have with with those
1877.96s: newer companies and as well as with
1880.44s: investors and and other people in that
1882.68s: industry so it's it's it's always nice
1884.72s: to have you know to do something
1886.40s: different other than staring at a
1887.96s: computer screen all day
1890.28s: sure what were the board meetings like
1894.40s: that you would sit on like what would
1895.76s: you do what would they talk about what
1898.12s: were the ins and outs of that sure well
1900.36s: most of them are very procedural you
1902.36s: know once once something gets to a board
1904.84s: meeting it's it's basically been talked
1907.16s: about and rehashed and hashed and
1909.08s: rehashed uh ad nauseum uh just between
1912.24s: you know the board members and
1913.24s: management and that kind of thing uh and
1915.84s: their advisers you know advisers from
1917.60s: the DC firm and that kind of thing so so
1920.08s: the board meetings tend to be actually
1922.00s: pretty short and procedural you know
1924.04s: because everything's I won't say a
1925.52s: rubber stamp but it's it's again it's
1927.48s: already been talked about hashed
1929.32s: rehashed uh into into basically you know
1932.44s: how the vote's going to come out or you
1934.28s: know a specific project or or an idea um
1937.52s: so the board meetings are are all pretty
1939.36s: pretty easy uh basically it's everything
1941.20s: you do before the board meeting where
1942.64s: you're just talking to management where
1944.28s: you're talking to some of the other
1945.92s: board members where you're talking to
1947.08s: the advisers
1948.36s: um you know just kind of looking at
1949.72s: where the company is going what can be
1951.68s: improved where its weak points are you
1953.68s: know a lot of times uh trying to find
1955.92s: you know trying to figure out if you can
1957.40s: find a better supplier for something
1959.32s: trying to make those network connections
1961.48s: because and that's what it's half of
1963.36s: what uh uh successful Venture Capital
1965.88s: firms are is just really making the
1967.64s: network connections between their
1969.92s: between their companies between their
1971.52s: their invested companies uh together see
1974.32s: who you know who can be a who a customer
1976.20s: of who who can help out you know
1978.44s: somebody else and help who might be a
1980.68s: good merger uh eventually someday so
1983.00s: you're really kind of trying to try to
1984.80s: play that networking a lot with the with
1987.20s: the other board members with management
1989.16s: that kind of thing sure and overall
1992.60s: experience there good bad and different
1995.12s: good really good you know it's uh again
1998.36s: if it wasn't so much you know I was able
2001.16s: to build up uh Investments private
2003.36s: investments into companies myself uh
2005.24s: through that uh but again you know other
2008.04s: than those Investments I I really didn't
2009.64s: own you know a lot of my own my own work
2012.48s: right my own work was for someone else
2014.28s: it was for you know in someone else's
2016.16s: business so if it hadn't been for that
2018.44s: maybe if I could have been like a
2019.80s: partner in that business then U I would
2022.08s: have stayed but again I wanted my own
2024.56s: thing I wanted my own my own assets uh
2027.72s: obviously even even in the the mid to to
2030.40s: late 2000s uh the internet still felt
2033.28s: like something very new uh as far as a
2035.88s: business idea and as far as creating a
2038.76s: business of course you know somebody
2040.32s: born in 1976 it would feel it would
2042.64s: still feel new I'm sure somebody born
2045.20s: you know after 2000 it feels hell the
2047.20s: internet's always been there right right
2049.64s: yeah yeah very different um Switching
2053.20s: gears a little bit now to the actual
2055.48s: practice of fundamental
2057.72s: analysis when you think of fundamental
2060.80s: analysis as a concept what does it mean
2063.80s: to you sure uh well you know try and to
2068.00s: trying just just as I did as an equity
2070.20s: analyst you know trying to find the
2071.84s: present the present value of those
2073.60s: future cash flows and excuse me and uh
2078.16s: and you know where where makes the the
2080.40s: most sense to to place an investment o
2082.68s: over the long term right uh and the
2085.08s: thing is you know there is so much the
2088.96s: there is so much uh sentiment value in
2092.64s: there when you're talking less than a
2094.24s: year right if you're talking stocks less
2096.48s: than a year it's all invest sentiment
2098.44s: it's all the overall market right
2100.08s: wherever where the overall Market is
2101.92s: going to go where investor sentiment is
2104.00s: going to go that's what's Drive stocks
2105.72s: in over under under a year right uh
2108.68s: beyond that so if you take a little bit
2110.48s: longer uh approach a little bit longer
2112.84s: Horizon then it is you know okay which
2115.80s: stocks which companies have that
2117.32s: competitive Advantage okay and you know
2120.12s: that's it's one of those words that's
2121.44s: thrown around so much it really means
2123.48s: nothing but it's um it's a little bit
2126.32s: easier to see you can get Clues to it
2128.24s: from an operating margin from a sales
2131.36s: growth perspective you know again uh
2135.12s: it's a little hard on YouTube because
2136.60s: you're expected to know all stocks and
2138.68s: all Industries uh but again it's it's a
2140.92s: little it's easier to just uh to focus
2142.84s: on one industry so you know okay what's
2144.88s: a good operating margin in that industry
2146.80s: you know that profitability what is a
2149.24s: good sales growth what are the the
2150.80s: companies getting as far as sales growth
2153.08s: and who's getting the higher sales
2154.56s: growth and why you know why are they
2156.04s: able to get uh 20 25% of Revenue growth
2159.52s: each year when the average is more like
2162.00s: 15 you know does that point to a
2164.00s: competitive advantage that they're doing
2166.36s: that you know either their product their
2168.08s: marketing just a brand uh something like
2170.44s: that that they're able to steal market
2172.24s: share from the from the rest of their
2173.92s: competitors right uh and then operating
2176.00s: margin of course you know is there some
2177.64s: kind of a competitive Advantage they
2179.16s: have in the management of that company
2181.08s: of the expenses you know not just not
2183.68s: just uh you know holding off expenses so
2185.52s: not investing in the future but are they
2188.04s: actually you know investing putting as
2190.20s: much money or cash flow you know from
2191.76s: the cash flow statement are they
2193.28s: investing in the future but they still
2195.36s: just you know beat everyone else out in
2197.36s: that operating profitability uh so
2199.64s: that's really you know through that
2200.76s: fundamental analysis um the analysis of
2203.56s: the the financial statements it always
2205.32s: it all goes back to there you know um
2208.36s: where where do you find the companies
2209.76s: that have that Advantage uh and you know
2212.92s: and that's always going to lead to to
2214.52s: better returns in those companies you
2216.36s: know any company obviously
2218.16s: uh it it might seem it's intuitive and
2220.64s: it might seem simplistic but any company
2222.84s: growing sales faster than its
2224.36s: competitors uh any company that has some
2227.08s: kind of a competitive advantage that's
2228.60s: leading to higher profitability uh it's
2231.08s: going to be the better return you
2233.40s: know so if you were to think of three of
2236.56s: your favorite fundamental analysis
2239.40s: indicators it sounds like sales growth
2241.24s: would be one of them what what would the
2244.76s: three be sure sure uh definitely sales
2247.24s: growth uh but that's got it's got to be
2248.80s: in relation to uh you know the other
2251.00s: companies in its industry okay so so
2253.28s: when you're when you're comparing stocks
2254.52s: to buy or when you're looking for stocks
2256.00s: to buy you always have to compare uh you
2258.24s: know a stock against the same com
2260.20s: against other companies in its same
2261.96s: industry not just the same sector but in
2264.00s: the same industry right so you can't
2265.60s: compare Coca-Cola to Nvidia uh okay
2268.92s: because obviously nvidia's sales growth
2270.76s: is just going to you know blow the doors
2272.28s: off Coca-Cola doesn't mean Coca-Cola
2274.32s: isn't a good company isn't a great
2275.72s: company uh it just means it's to
2278.04s: entirely different Industries you got to
2280.20s: compare you got to compare Coca-Cola to
2282.44s: Pepsi and to uh you know Monster
2284.28s: Beverage and that I think the question
2286.64s: there though is does the Coca-Cola CEO
2289.00s: wear an alligator skin jacket ins sign
2292.16s: people's bras right like that that to me
2294.92s: is more what I'm there is there is
2297.68s: definitely a and you know it's it's
2299.08s: funny but there is definitely a uh
2302.72s: a an icon kind of value to a company
2306.72s: okay the the the kind of value that okay
2309.40s: yeah Jensen Lang that Elon Musk adds to
2312.52s: add to their companies uh you know it's
2315.60s: it's it's a it's an in it's a it's a t
2318.60s: intangible value you that you know
2320.96s: whether you add it to the stock or not
2323.32s: uh it's it's kind of weird it's it's
2324.68s: kind of crazy to think of it like that
2326.36s: we I can't I can't really think well I
2328.88s: guess we did you know back in the day
2330.28s: you know we did have CEOs that were uh a
2332.60s: little bit larger than life we had Jack
2334.12s: welcha over at GE you know Bob Iger was
2337.44s: still at Disney but in the old days he
2339.28s: was you know at Disney first and uh you
2342.16s: know these guys were were Larger than
2343.88s: Life they were media you know they they
2346.04s: were I won't say Superstars or even
2348.08s: stars but you know people knew who they
2350.60s: were they were they were uh you know
2352.16s: they were Role Models but they weren't
2354.12s: they weren't the rock stars yeah you're
2356.08s: right that that musk and Jensen Wang and
2358.92s: and uh I mean even I won't say Tim Cook
2362.04s: is really in that League you know uh but
2365.24s: yeah you know so so yeah there's I there
2368.08s: there's there is something to be said
2369.32s: for that Superstar status and and what
2371.64s: that means for the stock price but um
2373.96s: yeah you know you you you got to got to
2375.76s: compare apples to apples right so you're
2378.12s: always looking at uh companies within
2380.16s: the same industry okay what's uh you
2383.00s: know get your get your old spreadsheet
2385.64s: out there and line them all up uh get
2387.88s: the the revenue growth not just one-year
2389.76s: Revenue growth but how have these
2391.12s: companies grown Revenue over the last 5
2392.96s: years you know an annualized return or
2395.08s: an annualized rate uh what's the average
2397.60s: there what's the median uh who's got the
2399.52s: highest ones and and really why is that
2401.84s: you know it's like again like I said
2403.20s: it's a great Clue Into who might have a
2405.44s: competitive Advantage um you know why is
2407.52s: one company able to get Revenue sells uh
2409.92s: so much higher than than the others uh
2412.08s: so it it's definitely something that uh
2414.20s: that you want to look at but only in
2415.64s: comparison with the others operating
2417.00s: margins same thing you know operating
2418.68s: margins basically just your operating
2420.16s: income it's this is all on the income
2421.88s: statement your operating income divided
2423.72s: by sales and it's really that core
2425.56s: measure of profitability right because
2427.48s: uh you know you've got your Revenue
2428.76s: minus your uh Co cost of goods sold
2431.52s: which is basically a lot of factory
2433.00s: expenses uh your supplier expenses
2435.00s: things like that then you've got your
2436.48s: operating expenses which are uh you know
2439.00s: U selling General administrative
2441.08s: marketing things like that uh some other
2443.28s: operating costs uh and that gives you
2445.04s: your operating income right so you know
2448.24s: further down on the income statement
2449.48s: you're going to find your your interest
2451.28s: your taxes things like that that things
2453.08s: that really aren't a part of the
2454.80s: business running the business right so
2456.40s: that's why I like to use operating
2457.68s: income provided by Revenue that gives
2459.32s: you your operating margin it's really a
2460.72s: core profitability for that business
2463.08s: okay so that's uh you know and that's
2466.16s: again compared to others in the industry
2469.68s: how how is one company able to do so
2472.36s: much better uh on that profitability
2474.68s: than the others why you know is it just
2476.44s: better managed uh do they have a little
2478.48s: bit more power over their produ over
2480.32s: their suppliers they're able to get
2481.52s: lower costs um things like that you know
2484.04s: so it's a really good Clue Into how this
2486.12s: company is being managed which might
2487.64s: have competitive Advantage uh you've
2489.64s: also got um just uh you know uh cash
2492.68s: flow you know free cash flow growth uh
2495.88s: um operating cash flow growth you know
2498.12s: for it's a little bit different for
2500.04s: really early stage companies where it
2502.32s: might be negative cash flow negative
2504.32s: earnings things like that you have to
2505.84s: really look at the balance sheet as well
2508.00s: you know is one company is growing but
2510.24s: it's so far in debt or or so far
2512.80s: negative uh cash flow that uh they're
2515.32s: not going to survive you know if they
2517.00s: don't have a big stockpile of cash on
2519.64s: hand but it's really uh you know for for
2522.72s: most for most mature companies it's
2524.60s: really just about that growth and uh and
2526.84s: how they're able to generate it
2529.28s: right now you're talking about for
2532.68s: Revenue growth for example you talked
2534.16s: about using like a 5year annualized when
2536.92s: you're conducting this fundamental
2538.32s: analysis is a broader
2540.60s: process first what do you think about
2544.20s: the relevant time frames for your analys
2547.40s: is I imagine it has to be partially
2549.32s: based on your expected holding duration
2552.32s: is that accurate or how do you choose
2554.64s: what time frames are most relevant for
2557.76s: including prior data points sure sure
2560.60s: well of course yeah if you're if you're
2563.52s: planning on holding it for five or 10 or
2565.60s: 20 years you can look back you know five
2567.80s: years uh of course it's got to be it's
2570.44s: got to be to the point where you're
2572.68s: really kind of looking at uh you know
2574.60s: what happened in those last five years
2576.12s: what were the the the major you know
2578.16s: economic themes right was the government
2580.40s: just throwing money at at everything so
2582.40s: everybody of course everybody had 20 30%
2584.60s: Revenue growth uh so you kind of you
2587.00s: know hedge it against that um so you
2589.60s: kind of have to put it put everything
2590.92s: into perspective but I would say I would
2592.80s: say five years is good uh for maybe some
2595.52s: of the older companies you can go back
2597.04s: you know seven 10 years just to see just
2599.40s: to compare okay so you know Coca-Cola
2601.64s: versus Pepsi over the last 10 years then
2604.12s: over the last 5 years has something
2605.68s: changed uh is is there Revenue growth
2607.76s: over the last 10 years uh in relation to
2610.00s: each other has that changed from 10
2612.12s: years to 5 years you know and why what
2614.36s: what's management doing you know so so
2616.52s: you really have to look at and again
2619.00s: these looking at these it it I don't
2621.80s: want I don't want the sound to sound too
2623.68s: simplistic because you're not just
2625.04s: looking at okay hey this company has the
2627.08s: higher Revenue growth this must be the
2628.48s: better investment no you're looking at
2630.24s: that you're trying to use that as a clue
2632.80s: for okay what should I look at in this
2635.20s: company okay if I found that Coca-Cola
2637.76s: has uh you know 15% Revenue growth
2639.72s: annualized over the Last 5 Years all of
2641.68s: its competitors are you know 3 to 5%
2644.52s: then I want to start looking at
2645.68s: Coca-Cola and I want to start I want to
2647.60s: actually find why you know why is it
2649.92s: Revenue growth is it buying that Revenue
2651.60s: growth that's you know something you
2652.88s: have to look out for for a lot of these
2654.52s: companies just acquiring other companies
2657.20s: yeah their revenue growth is going to
2658.40s: look great because they're buying it
2660.16s: right they're they're probably putting
2661.48s: on mountains of debt to buy these other
2663.56s: companies uh their revenue looks growth
2665.80s: looks great but it's going to come out
2667.32s: and bite them in the ass when you know
2668.84s: when all that all that uh debt comes due
2671.92s: so you really have to you know have to
2673.64s: look into the company say okay is it
2676.24s: because of some kind of strategic uh
2677.96s: genius uh the management has uh is it
2680.36s: some kind of competitive advantage in
2681.80s: the brand in the product in the
2683.68s: marketing uh and can that be you know
2686.08s: obviously is that a durable competitive
2688.12s: advantage that's going to last out over
2689.88s: this five or 10 years uh that's that's
2692.60s: really where you got to take that that
2694.68s: simple you know that those kind of
2696.32s: simple metrics that you can look for you
2698.16s: got to take it to those uh you know to
2700.24s: that level to to Really find those and
2702.96s: the thing is I I mean for that real
2705.44s: long-term uh investing the good thing is
2708.64s: you probably only have to do that maybe
2710.28s: once every couple of years right because
2712.24s: you're looking for something that is
2713.52s: durable uh you know over the next five
2715.60s: or 10 years so basically you're finding
2718.04s: that you're investing in it and then um
2720.56s: you know if the stock doesn't if the
2722.64s: company doesn't do as well over the next
2725.00s: two years 3 years then you might visit
2727.32s: it and see okay what did they do
2728.64s: differently uh is it is it just you know
2731.04s: a hiccup in time or do I need to
2733.32s: re-evaluate all of these but it's this
2735.56s: isn't something you're doing every every
2737.64s: month or even every year uh so so it is
2740.12s: a lot of work but once you find those
2741.88s: companies then you know you can hold
2743.72s: them hold them forever
2746.36s: basically how do you choose sector
2750.68s: because we talked a lot about comparing
2752.56s: within sectors we talked about not being
2754.48s: able to compare the fact that
2757.76s: Nvidia they have a rockstar CEO that's
2760.64s: signing people's bras and I don't even
2763.36s: know the Coca-Cola CEO right now so that
2765.60s: tells you a lot so how do you pick which
2770.60s: sectors make the most sense for you sure
2774.08s: uh well a lot of it comes down to just
2776.04s: your goals right obviously some sectors
2778.08s: are going to are going to grow grow
2780.08s: faster those have have those faster
2782.12s: Revenue growths and and you know should
2785.20s: uh produce better returns so right so
2787.32s: you've got your technology your
2788.68s: communication Services which used to be
2790.92s: all the old telecom stocks but are now
2793.04s: mostly internet stocks and things like
2794.48s: that so a little bit faster growth uh
2796.12s: consumer discretionary tends to be kind
2797.68s: of a growth sector right um as and then
2800.88s: you've got so if you you want that
2802.68s: portfolio growth you would you would
2804.32s: pick one maybe one or two of those
2805.72s: sectors if you want maybe a little bit
2808.00s: more stable uh stable returns uh safety
2810.88s: sectors like utilities like Consumer
2812.88s: Staples like healthcare things within
2815.16s: those uh then you would pick those and
2817.24s: again probably the thing people don't
2819.80s: realize about real investing when they
2821.48s: just watch YouTube and they watch people
2823.20s: pick stocks from all different sectors
2825.00s: and everywhere is again it pays to be uh
2828.28s: very specific in you know your expertise
2831.24s: right so uh what I always say is okay
2834.00s: hey pick one sector or maybe a few
2836.84s: Industries in different sectors so if
2838.68s: you want to pick you know a couple
2839.96s: Industries out of tech a couple
2841.28s: Industries out of uh you know
2843.28s: communication Services uh pick a couple
2845.60s: of those Industries really get to be an
2847.32s: expert and follow the companies in those
2848.92s: Industries analyze the companies in
2850.44s: those Industries so you know you know
2853.04s: which companies are the best stocks in
2855.44s: those Industries you know and that might
2857.16s: only be maybe five or or 10 stocks at
2860.12s: most right that you really think are the
2862.68s: best of the best in their specific
2864.60s: Industries and then to get that
2866.52s: Diversified portfolio that a little bit
2868.00s: more safety uh in your overall portfolio
2871.16s: then youd pick maybe a uh maybe a tell
2874.12s: maybe a whole Index Fund the Spy or the
2876.52s: V that just covers all the stock market
2879.16s: or maybe you just buy the other sectors
2880.84s: in their you know select sector spider
2882.80s: funds right uh so that's going to give
2884.64s: you the you know the market the market
2886.80s: return that's going to give you the the
2888.24s: return in those sectors that you really
2889.72s: don't follow you really don't know
2891.24s: anything about um that's going to give
2893.80s: you a nice smooth return in those and
2896.20s: then those those five or 10 stocks that
2898.92s: you really have studied you really have
2900.88s: researched within those Industries those
2902.88s: will give you that extra return that
2904.20s: extra Alpha right um and and again so to
2908.28s: your to your question how do you pick
2910.32s: those sectors well again it's it's what
2912.32s: do you want to focus on uh do you want
2914.20s: to focus on growth so maybe those five
2916.36s: or 10 stocks they're in those growth
2918.28s: sectors uh the the technology
2920.40s: communication Services consumer
2922.20s: discretionary maybe you overweight those
2924.20s: a little bit in your portfolio so maybe
2926.00s: you have U 20 30% of your money in those
2929.08s: 10 stocks and then the other you know 60
2931.44s: 70% in uh in the overall Market uh so
2935.56s: that would give it a little bit of
2936.80s: growth bent right or you know conversely
2939.12s: if you want more of a dividend Focus
2940.60s: then you would focus on those sectors or
2942.88s: a safety focus on on those sectors and
2945.00s: you would overweight your portfolio
2946.76s: right so you're not just you're not just
2948.40s: picking one sector even even if you were
2951.04s: to become an expert in the technology
2952.84s: sector or in a few Industries in there
2954.24s: you're not still not putting all of your
2955.80s: money in tech stocks that would just
2957.88s: that'd be kind of ridiculous right you
2959.60s: know I mean after the bubble burst in
2961.40s: 2000 uh in tech stocks I mean it took 14
2964.60s: years for the NASDAQ to get back to that
2967.04s: to the level it was in 2000 so to have
2969.36s: all your money in tech stocks uh you
2971.32s: know you're just you're just begging for
2972.64s: that kind of a you know that kind of a
2975.04s: crash um so overweight you know
2978.00s: overweight those sectors that have that
2979.56s: kind of growth or that or not growth
2981.60s: that kind of focus on what you want to
2983.52s: focus on uh but then yeah invest broadly
2986.28s: more broadly across the market in just
2988.12s: you know ETFs and and index funds things
2990.32s: like that if you feel some type of way
2992.56s: about people being overweight in the
2994.60s: NASDAQ I think we just need to sensitize
2997.28s: you to like Wall Street bets where
2999.40s: people are betting their entire life
3001.28s: savings on zero DTE in Nvidia exactly
3005.84s: yeah yeah and you know it's I hate bull
3008.36s: markets I I gotta say I I I hate bull
3010.68s: markets sometimes because because
3013.48s: everyone is an expert and everyone knows
3016.16s: the best investment right you know you
3017.92s: say one bad thing you say one I won't
3020.28s: even say not even a bad thing but you
3022.08s: know the bare case on uh you know on a
3024.28s: hot stock on Nvidia on paler you say how
3027.08s: how it's just crazy expensive uh and
3030.04s: people are like well I've made 300% on
3032.20s: paler so you know on you I must I'm
3035.48s: the expert I I had one comment yeah a
3038.08s: couple weeks ago and I was saying
3040.00s: palente here this is when it was right
3041.84s: around $80 a share and it's back down to
3044.36s: around 6770 I think now but uh you know
3047.36s: I was saying hey I mean to to at this
3050.12s: valuation it would need this kind of
3051.76s: growth for decades out in the future
3054.48s: just to make it uh you know kind of a
3055.92s: breaking even investment and it's just
3058.52s: there's just ridiculous valuations uh
3061.08s: and uh you know somebody came back with
3063.24s: uh you know oh hey 10 years Equity
3065.24s: analyst CFA designation all that uh I
3067.84s: I've got I've got none of that and I
3069.76s: already made 300% in Nvidia so now who's
3072.24s: the um you know and and somehow
3075.36s: this guy is right right because you know
3077.44s: he's made money and and I'm sitting here
3080.20s: saying don't buy paler uh so yeah you
3083.84s: know it's just kind of the it's it's how
3086.12s: the market works one of the things I
3088.52s: always remind people of is in my opinion
3091.96s: I just wrapped up my 18th year of
3093.56s: trading last year and in my opinion the
3097.68s: dominant the dominant display of Mastery
3101.16s: of the skill set is endurance oh yeah so
3104.80s: I'm very happy that he's made 300% let's
3107.52s: come back in a decade and see what it
3109.28s: looks like like and it's not wishing bad
3111.92s: on anybody I want them to make money but
3114.80s: a lot of people I think really confuse
3117.52s: exactly to your point short turn
3119.64s: sequence of returns the path and they
3122.28s: confuse that as strategy and yeah it'll
3125.48s: catch I won't say I Won't Say I'm any
3127.16s: better I mean hell when I first started
3128.72s: investing back with my $1,200 I was
3131.84s: making as a as a Corp in the Marine
3133.52s: Corps you know um I I I was momentum
3136.56s: investing I was buying the hot stocks I
3138.68s: didn't know from Shola as far as uh
3141.76s: stocks or analysis or anything I was
3143.72s: just buying buying what everybody was
3145.36s: talking about right uh you know so so
3147.76s: I've made I made I have probably learned
3150.40s: more from my mistakes than I ever did
3153.16s: learning as you know as an equity
3154.92s: analyst and and Venture Capital analyst
3156.96s: and all that it's just you know when
3158.80s: you've been investing for 25 25 years
3161.84s: now then you you you make a lot of
3164.40s: mistakes and you know if you learn from
3166.24s: them then then that's that puts you
3168.32s: ahead of the 70% of uh investors out
3171.20s: there that either haven't made the
3172.60s: mistakes yet or you made them but just
3174.80s: didn't learn anything and just keep on
3176.52s: repeating those same mistakes over and
3178.04s: over
3178.92s: again a beautiful segue into couple of
3182.88s: my last questions for you um it's always
3185.64s: fun to poke fun when somebody else gets
3188.12s: hurt provided that they're not hurt too
3189.88s: bad so let's talk about the hurt let's
3193.48s: talk about some of the mistakes when you
3195.48s: look back over your your trading career
3198.08s: I I'd like to I'd like you to break out
3200.20s: a handful whatever number you you feel
3202.24s: like but I'd like you to break it out
3204.04s: into two distinct buckets I would
3207.28s: consider there to be beginner mistakes
3209.72s: which is often just not knowing what you
3212.36s: don't know and those are kind of easy
3214.24s: things right once you're educated on
3215.84s: them then you can typically avoid those
3218.16s: so I'd love to start with a couple of
3220.08s: those and then just to prime your brain
3221.72s: and I'll remind you if you need the the
3223.08s: question again for the second part is
3226.12s: what would you consider some of the more
3227.68s: advanced mistakes and these are things
3230.36s: that typically occur later along in your
3233.08s: tenure you have some experience and
3235.92s: there's still something that shows up
3238.16s: that Ops you out of nowhere sure uh well
3241.16s: you know the beginner mistakes are are
3242.96s: just what what you see on a lot of
3244.52s: YouTube right now is just that chart
3246.12s: porn just following following a chart up
3248.76s: and thinking it's always going to do
3250.12s: that um you know investing just because
3253.24s: uh that that happens or really even
3255.32s: saying somebody's saying it happens
3256.88s: there's a lot of YouTubers out there
3258.24s: that basically you know do do no more
3260.40s: analysis than just looking at a chart uh
3263.00s: and and I'm not talking about uh you
3264.76s: know technical analysis and actually
3266.64s: actually knowing the trends and patterns
3268.24s: to look for I'm talking about just
3270.36s: eyeballing a chart and loving that it's
3272.40s: going up and saying hey you know let's
3274.36s: let's ride it till ride it till we fall
3276.36s: off um so that's you know that's
3278.68s: probably the the biggest mistake I I see
3280.88s: new new invest make and I I made you
3282.72s: know myself Way Way Back ago um so I
3286.44s: think that's that's an easy one I think
3288.12s: the the PE Ratio you know following
3290.36s: following the easiest measures that uh
3293.08s: and really not knowing what goes into
3295.12s: them or why why some of the pitfalls or
3297.44s: traps in them so you know again what we
3300.20s: talked about the the earnings on an
3302.36s: income statement and how manipulated it
3304.24s: is uh and why that makes that PE ratio a
3307.24s: little bit a little bit U you know not
3310.92s: not quite what not quite as as valid as
3313.72s: you might think right so so maybe going
3316.00s: a little bit further into you know the
3317.84s: price to cash flow or or some of the
3320.36s: other some of the other measures is a
3322.00s: better bet there um so I think that's
3324.52s: that kind of that kind of uh basic basic
3327.52s: analysis and basic investing I think
3329.32s: it's the biggest mistakes I see people
3330.72s: make you know there's a I think it's I
3333.44s: want to say the dunning's Krueger uh
3336.52s: graph Krueger effect where where uh you
3340.00s: you learn a little bit and you're right
3341.52s: at that Peak that Peak stupidity I think
3344.00s: is where they call it where you know
3346.56s: just enough to to make yourself
3348.04s: dangerous right and I think that's where
3350.12s: a lot of investors find themselves at
3351.84s: they you know they put in you know a
3353.32s: couple hours a week to look at stocks
3355.84s: and uh all of a sudden they think they
3357.88s: you know they think they they they know
3360.28s: exactly where things are going and and
3362.48s: what to do um and it's really only when
3365.16s: you start to usually when you start to
3367.96s: make those mistakes only when you hit
3370.12s: that first bare Market of your of your
3372.20s: investing life and you really start to
3374.12s: see some of the stupid things you were
3376.00s: doing uh that that you really do do
3378.72s: start to learn okay this is what I don't
3380.72s: know this is what I need to learn uh and
3382.72s: that kind of thing so really really it's
3385.88s: un un fortunately I think for a lot of
3387.72s: people it's just that those mistakes
3389.24s: have to be made you know and it would be
3390.84s: great to to be able to say Hey you know
3393.76s: don't just follow a chart up uh don't
3395.80s: just buy what's going up that kind of
3397.48s: thing but it's it's almost like you know
3399.32s: it's almost like my eight-year-old you
3400.88s: can tell them all you tell them all you
3402.56s: want you give them all the advice in the
3404.44s: world but they're not going to listen to
3405.76s: you uh they just have to make those
3407.72s: mistakes uh themselves and you know tell
3410.36s: their eight-year-old when they have it
3412.24s: uh about those about those mistakes uh I
3415.88s: think the maybe a little bit more a
3418.40s: little bit higher level mistake is
3420.60s: learning how to you know watch that debt
3423.16s: watch the debt that a company has uh I
3425.52s: know a lot of us we love a great deal
3427.40s: you know so you look at a stock that's
3428.88s: just falling falling off of a cliff you
3430.72s: think hey it must be a great stock must
3432.64s: be a great deal uh so you just buy the
3434.44s: shares right without looking at okay
3436.36s: well one Market's pretty smart and
3438.16s: usually when a stock is going down so
3439.60s: much it's for a reason you know so so
3441.60s: what does other people what do what do
3443.32s: people see that maybe you aren't looking
3444.84s: at uh and what's the case for the stock
3447.80s: but more importantly is uh you know
3450.60s: watching that watching that stock and
3452.48s: watching the debt on the company's
3454.00s: balance sheet uh the cash flow it goes
3456.40s: really this is where the cash flow
3457.72s: statement comes in handy is okay when
3460.64s: does that debt come due you know what's
3462.52s: the what's the cash flow Trend uh in the
3465.08s: operational cash flow uh and you know
3467.28s: how much cash on hand do they have to to
3469.04s: pay if it's a negative negative cash
3471.28s: flow uh but also how much debt do they
3473.20s: have and what are those interest
3474.56s: payments like because you know even even
3477.52s: a a greatl looking company can get into
3480.64s: a lot of trouble uh if they have too
3482.40s: much debt I mean case in point probably
3484.28s: my biggest loss ever was uh pebody
3487.04s: Peabody Energy Right coal producer this
3489.76s: was uh probably 2012 right and all the
3492.60s: coal producers were just falling off of
3494.28s: a cliff uh you know the the government
3496.52s: was really cracking coming down hard on
3499.32s: on coal producers trying to trying to
3501.64s: move everybody into renewable energies
3503.72s: and uh natural gas and things like that
3506.00s: uh so so yeah the the coal producers
3508.20s: were just dying uh and you know so I so
3511.16s: I saw that and and I thought well hey
3513.92s: yeah you know the future is in renewable
3516.00s: energies the future is in natural gas
3518.00s: but at the time coal was still I think
3520.32s: something like uh you know 37 40 42% of
3524.96s: electricity generation right so it
3527.00s: wasn't wasn't going away anytime soon
3529.24s: right so so I thought okay you know you
3531.56s: look at this industry coal industry uh
3534.08s: who is you know who is the strongest
3536.16s: who's the best house in the shitty
3537.36s: neighborhood right and Peabody you know
3539.44s: it had that size it was one of probably
3541.20s: the largest largest publicly traded coal
3543.80s: producer um so I thought okay here's a
3546.84s: company that yeah it's beaten down just
3549.44s: because the entire Market is beaten down
3551.12s: for for coal producers it's not anything
3553.20s: management did it's just it's just a
3555.16s: horrible environment uh so once that
3557.84s: environment improves once the
3559.20s: environment for coal improves this stock
3561.48s: should go to the Moon uh so I invested
3563.96s: in that and of course you know followed
3566.28s: all the way down one of the big biggest
3568.00s: mistakes an investor can make is you
3569.96s: know that dollar cost averaging that
3571.68s: that isn't a bad idea but that dollar
3573.92s: cost a yeah all all the way down
3576.64s: catching that Fallen knife and of course
3578.84s: they eventually filed bankruptcy uh
3580.88s: because you know even though eventually
3583.60s: and hell you know Cole Cole has been a
3586.20s: great investment over the last few years
3587.88s: over the last five or six years I think
3589.92s: uh but uh but it didn't turn around
3592.80s: enough quick enough for the company to
3594.88s: get out from that Mass massive amounts
3596.56s: of debt uh that it had on the balance
3598.52s: sheet so they just owed too much debt uh
3601.00s: and ended in ended up in bankruptcy so I
3603.04s: lost quite a bit of money from that
3604.60s: actually and uh and yeah you know if
3607.48s: you're going to be if you're going to be
3608.80s: chasing those those value companies that
3610.84s: that have just sold off you know 30 40
3613.56s: 50% uh one you got to you you got to
3616.68s: figure out that bare case and you got to
3618.04s: you got to follow you can't close your
3619.20s: ears just because somebody is saying
3621.00s: something negative about a stock that
3622.56s: you think you might like uh and then you
3624.52s: got to look at that balance sheet you
3625.64s: got to look the cash flows uh and that
3628.92s: debt I love that too because it also
3632.68s: highlights a really common thing in
3634.56s: terms of the temporal relationship of
3637.64s: your assumption with when it actually
3639.52s: ends up playing out because to your
3641.00s: broader point the thesis ended up being
3643.28s: correct but just the the timing yeah the
3646.88s: timing hurt you oh yeah timing is you
3649.20s: know you look at uh well okay one
3651.80s: another one of my my best examples that
3654.16s: I like is everybody loves the movie big
3656.56s: short right uh and and of course Michael
3659.12s: Barry always always loves to point out
3661.00s: that he predicted the the housing crash
3663.64s: well he was trying to predict it in 2000
3665.64s: if you follow that watch the movie and
3667.32s: you actually follow what actually
3668.96s: happened he was trying to predict it in
3670.16s: like 2002 2003 okay so he was about four
3673.52s: years early if you actually watch the
3674.96s: movie he only kept his firm his uh you
3679.60s: know his Capital Capital Management his
3681.88s: firm out of bankruptcy because he just
3683.88s: stopped returning investor money you
3685.52s: know people were asking for their money
3686.80s: back and he said nope I'm I'm suspending
3689.56s: all all withdrawals right now so that is
3692.04s: the only way that he kept his firm out
3693.64s: of bankruptcy uh but he he ended up
3696.40s: being right uh you know so so bully for
3699.12s: him he he became a big star and you know
3702.20s: uh but uh but but yeah being yeah one of
3706.84s: the biggest lessons I've learned is
3708.32s: being early is just can be just as bad
3710.96s: as about as being wrong yeah and
3713.80s: sometimes sometimes it's even worse
3716.00s: because if you're early and you still
3717.36s: have conviction you start throwing more
3718.96s: money at it it's losing and you're like
3721.12s: I still feel this is going to happen
3722.44s: yeah no I literally couldn't agree more
3724.40s: with you there and it it's it's funny
3726.64s: because I always think how razor thin
3729.80s: the margin is between like genius and
3732.72s: idiot and that example is that razor
3736.32s: thin margin he's a genius because it
3738.24s: worked but just I always think of it in
3740.92s: terms of um probabilities that's a lot
3742.88s: of my my background is in stats so it's
3744.88s: like how many other versions of this
3747.60s: happened with other people different
3749.28s: funds that failed on the same idea but
3752.68s: just couldn't make it across that finish
3754.44s: line he was he was so overextended uh in
3757.40s: this one bet that it it almost destroyed
3759.96s: his firm uh so so there's a point where
3762.52s: you got to go back to you know Warren
3763.72s: Buffett's old uh or what's attributed to
3766.48s: him his old saying is just you know rule
3768.24s: number one don't lose money right so you
3771.12s: may feel you may feel you've got the the
3773.52s: inside scoop on the company or a compan
3776.16s: or the economy or the market where it's
3778.08s: going uh but if it means you know
3781.16s: placing bets uh you know placing
3783.00s: outsized bets on One Direction uh and
3786.12s: hoping that turns out you know those
3787.96s: those binary bets like options uh where
3790.36s: you know you could lose everything if
3791.44s: you're wrong then you got to think okay
3794.28s: you know what if I'm what if I'm early
3796.16s: what if I'm really early on this what
3797.56s: what does the future look like for that
3799.56s: uh and then kind of try to try to hedge
3801.28s: some of that and and really you know I
3803.88s: mean it's it's it's not wrong to play
3806.28s: you know directional bets and put
3808.16s: conviction or put money behind your
3809.76s: conviction but uh but again you know
3812.56s: what happens if you're early and what
3814.32s: what does that look like well it also
3816.48s: goes back to the the point we were
3818.16s: talking about before is you know placing
3820.92s: Bets with conviction is one thing but
3823.04s: survival is another and again to me the
3826.32s: ultimate Mark of a seasoned investor
3829.76s: Trader is tenure it's duration so yeah
3833.24s: you you might be worried about getting
3834.40s: that thousand bagger that you're super
3836.20s: convicted in but if you mortgage the
3838.04s: house on it and and you're wrong even if
3840.04s: you win if you apply that methodology
3842.80s: going forward you're going to you're
3844.64s: going to unwind it at some point I
3846.32s: always find that part really funny how
3847.80s: there's a lot of really really really
3850.28s: smart people that have done really great
3852.76s: in the markets there's a couple Super
3854.64s: Famous ones that have done really great
3856.28s: in the markets but then because of like
3858.60s: mistiming and things like that they end
3860.16s: up losing all their money um yeah it'll
3863.24s: get you sooner or later it's like the
3864.56s: casino as long as you keep back you have
3866.28s: to have good bankroll management
3868.44s: eventually yeah well was you know the uh
3871.36s: and this one I I can't remember the the
3874.16s: the the the firm but was what's the
3876.16s: hedge fund that was in uh the the recent
3879.88s: uh GameStop movie right that that kind
3883.16s: ofone huh trone yeah I I think that was
3887.96s: the one that folded the the one that was
3889.52s: played by uh oh Melvin yeah Melvin there
3893.64s: you go Melvin yeah yeah he's a smart guy
3896.40s: he had he had uh you know a history a
3898.96s: history behind him uh and then yeah he
3901.40s: just he just went so far into that one
3904.72s: trade you know Overexposed in that one
3906.92s: thing and that was it you know was
3909.76s: billion dollar loss you know just losses
3912.60s: adding up to where it broke him uh so
3915.44s: yeah you know the uh you can make you
3917.44s: make all the money you want uh but if
3919.00s: you continue to turn investing into
3921.92s: gambling rather than investing uh then
3925.00s: then it's gonna you know like you said
3926.52s: the house is going to win
3928.68s: eventually GG's for them well absolutely
