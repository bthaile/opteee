0.68s: what's up everyone today is all about
2.88s: GameStop I want to run through a little
5.12s: more in depth some of the activity that
7.28s: we're seeing although it is generally
10.04s: Quiet on the Western Front this is a
12.48s: good time to collect different Baseline
15.08s: information for the product so that's
17.12s: what I want to do here because a lot of
19.20s: the conversations that I've had recently
20.88s: about GameStop since we had this pop
23.16s: back in like the middle of May was very
25.68s: centered on kind of really busy markets
28.80s: right like take a look at these volume
30.28s: bars it's just a lot going on there so
32.76s: we're in this little bit of a decline
34.72s: phase right and you can see a few things
36.76s: that I find interesting straight from a
38.36s: chart perspective when I look at the way
42.40s: price was behaving before we had the
45.00s: previous squeeze we can see that volume
47.56s: was real real quiet we saw a little bit
49.40s: of volume expand around earnings as per
52.92s: usual then we have this massive
55.12s: explosion in volume and that's just been
57.80s: coming down real real L let me get me
60.80s: out of the way so you can see right down
62.72s: here so the very first thing that comes
66.32s: to my mind is closely monitoring the
70.88s: volume and the way that the volume moves
73.96s: so what I like to do down here is to
76.52s: just kind of set let me grab this little
78.80s: line for you guys like kind price level
81.56s: so I try to set these different levels
83.16s: like that so that I could see all right
85.64s: this has been the kind of more recent
88.96s: regime h high for volume and we are
92.44s: definitely trailing down below that at
94.44s: this point which is again to be expected
96.44s: it's it's relatively quiet but this
99.84s: becomes informative with how this volume
102.76s: average line and how the volume bars
105.32s: themselves start to behave because I
107.96s: want to keep a really close eye if we
110.28s: start to see a meaningful expansion in
113.00s: volume because that's that's exactly
115.36s: what happened back here when we had this
117.32s: first kind of slight turn day on 3 May
120.52s: we started to see on the second before
124.04s: we had the bigger day on the third a
128.08s: again contextually large expansion and
131.44s: volume the reason why I say contextually
133.08s: is because when you look at this bar you
135.16s: look at this bar and you're like yo that
137.76s: ain't nothing but in this case it is
140.76s: something and the reason for that is
143.08s: because these bars expanded because of
145.36s: earnings there is a clear event you can
147.96s: look at and say we are are higher over
150.68s: here for that reason this makes sense
152.40s: there's more people transacting in the
154.04s: product around earnings okay got it very
156.44s: very normal now it gets a little
158.76s: different though because we have this
161.88s: random higher day here and then all of a
164.96s: sudden there's this day the second it's
167.88s: essentially a completely green bar
171.44s: meaning the overwhelming amount of
174.04s: volume that you saw on this day was by
178.36s: volume interesting
180.56s: I think and then that's before we
183.20s: started seeing the rest of this move
185.28s: coming to fruition so while some people
187.80s: might be slightly dismayed about the
190.80s: volume Contracting down how it is and
192.64s: that kind of stuff which I get but I
194.64s: would also look at it on the bright side
196.48s: where Now you kind of have a really
197.84s: clean slate to identify triggers and to
201.72s: identify interesting buying activity in
204.08s: the underlying if there is any that
206.32s: that's something I think about now a
208.60s: couple of people have asked me about my
210.16s: positions in GameStop I always try to
212.16s: remind you guys that what I do really
214.40s: shouldn't matter and I'm always happy to
216.44s: talk about it but the reason why I
218.52s: preface that is I know a lot of people
220.12s: ask that question to try to Benchmark
222.80s: what they think they should be doing for
224.52s: their own stuff and the only person that
226.32s: can answer that is you whatever you
228.68s: think makes sense for you please do that
231.40s: it's nobody else's decision other than
233.28s: your own but I'm always again happy to
235.56s: talk about so right now I still have
237.72s: shares of GameStop but I've scaled out
240.28s: meaningfully I do not have a big
242.08s: position on at this point and I also
244.20s: have some short calls against them still
247.36s: to try to collect some premium against
249.64s: the shares and essentially I started
251.64s: this campaign back here and here it's
255.28s: scaling out of the product as it starts
258.16s: moving in the opposite direction I began
260.72s: scaling in the shares a few different
262.60s: periods throughout this entire time
264.04s: frame but this more relative period is
266.32s: kind of in here and the basis on the
270.00s: shares that I was getting in at was
271.16s: around 22 which was overall really good
273.48s: basis but the thing about the way that I
276.48s: operate as a Trader is I'm very
278.76s: reluctant to let winning trades turn
281.12s: into losing trades so when I see turn
284.72s: days like this I start scaling out and
287.24s: then when I see is falling below points
289.44s: of control I start scaling out the
291.32s: reason why I'm scaling out is to take
292.68s: money out of the trade I've made money I
294.60s: want to keep the money in my pocket so
296.84s: that I can do more with the money going
298.68s: forward again this is
300.32s: my world is a Trader I know a lot of you
302.72s: have a different approach which I have
304.16s: tremendous respect for which is to Halle
307.32s: and to DRS your shares which is totally
309.60s: cool this is just a different way that I
311.68s: think about playing it now I've already
313.16s: told you guys I will always maintain
315.32s: some level exposure in GameStop just
317.28s: because being part of the story is cool
320.80s: literally that's that is the depth that
324.04s: goes into that so what I'm highlighting
326.12s: is there's a part of me that is
328.24s: participating in the underlying
329.72s: literally to support you guys but then
332.48s: the other part of me the broader part of
334.44s: the position is a Trader and my job is
336.44s: to trade so that's what I'm doing in
338.16s: here now for the shares that I do have
340.96s: on I still have a couple different
342.84s: alerts set to scale me out but even if I
347.12s: essentially get to full scale out of my
349.16s: speculative shares the position that I'm
351.80s: going to maintain just to participate
354.24s: will essentially remain so that's where
357.00s: that is I'm running the short calls
359.32s: because the premiums on them are still
361.12s: good although they've contracted a lot
362.88s: that's actually been one of the things
363.92s: I've been trading in GameStop is a lot
365.84s: of relative volatility positions and
367.96s: then also variance risk Premia in here
370.36s: has been really good but you have to be
372.00s: very careful the way you trade those
373.68s: kinds of things in a product like this
375.28s: because of how it can move you literally
377.24s: can get your face ripped off in just a
379.24s: few seconds so that is not something for
382.76s: the faint of heart you have to have a
384.40s: pretty solid management plan for that so
386.80s: anyways that's just a recap on what I'm
388.68s: doing in here now in terms of my
390.28s: expectations again I'm a Trader I spend
393.16s: very little time making trades off of
396.08s: something I expect to happen before I
398.20s: see it starting to happen so what that
400.28s: means is for example I think GameStop is
402.52s: going to go up do I think it's going to
404.36s: go up tomorrow next week five weeks from
406.40s: now I I genuinely don't know now does
409.48s: that mean because I think it's going to
410.76s: go up that I'm going to start dogpiling
412.48s: money into the product no that's not how
414.92s: I trade and it's because I need it to
417.60s: start showing me that it wants to go in
420.40s: the correct direction because otherwise
422.88s: it's very easy to get wrapped up in
425.56s: periods like this in periods like this
428.28s: where something kind of goes sideways a
430.24s: little bit Trends down and then again
433.04s: from a Trader's perspective there's a
436.04s: massive opportunity cost to tying up a
439.48s: bunch of capital in something that's not
442.20s: really doing a whole lot for a long
444.52s: period of time it's a difficult way to
448.44s: make money again again in my business so
452.12s: what I'm primarily looking for here is
455.68s: it to start showing some different price
458.64s: Behavior this still just looks like
460.76s: consolidation to me we saw a bit of an
463.52s: update today it's up uh well Okay I lied
467.20s: to you it's not up I guess technically
469.28s: it's up come on man so it looks like it
473.16s: closed at 23.95 it's down like a quarter
475.36s: point but after hours it was jostling
478.96s: around just a a little bit higher I
480.44s: thought maybe we'd get that back but no
482.36s: it's up just a little bit on the day so
484.72s: where did it open today
486.96s: 2359 and then it closed at
489.60s: 23.95 so it's up ever so slightly on the
493.04s: day
494.80s: so I view this as a consolidation period
498.72s: it's been exceedingly range-bound
501.32s: between 23 and if you exclude these two
504.36s: popup days with like the broader data
506.88s: set here it's really like 27 but if you
509.48s: include those it's like 28 almost 29
511.80s: maybe 28 and2 that I would consider this
513.84s: range so like 23 to 28 is where it's
515.96s: hanging around in right now and that's
517.24s: okay as long as it continues basing here
519.60s: because the other thing that I still am
521.28s: keeping a really close eye on is this so
525.40s: right now uh let me Zoom this in a
527.24s: little bit more so it's a little easier
528.52s: to see one of the things when I'm
530.40s: looking for something even if it's
531.88s: slowly trending up is standard standard
536.60s: price Behavior higher highs higher lows
539.48s: so when I see something post I call this
541.64s: a term low you know it's I'm excluding
543.72s: the data before this this is kind of
545.20s: like after these really big candles all
547.00s: settle down and the product seems to
549.08s: kind of be settling in a little bit this
551.72s: is like the term low here which is the
553.64s: 1st of July from there we post a low and
557.00s: I'm using the body of the candle not the
559.08s: wick I care about the body because that
561.00s: expresses some level of conviction in my
562.92s: opinion the candles can be really
564.76s: extreme and then things can snap back
567.08s: really quick so uh I pay attention to
569.96s: the Wicks to be clear but in this case
571.80s: I'm worried about the body where it
573.00s: actually was closed out at which was uh
575.80s: 2333 is where it closed here so then I
579.32s: want to make sure that this is not
582.20s: falling below that if this starts going
585.56s: below 2333 which we're close we're real
588.32s: close to that we're like 50 cents away
590.92s: but I care about that because from here
593.20s: we made this low we had a little bit of
595.48s: a pivot here we had a higher low right
599.16s: which which is kind of like this range
600.44s: here before it broke down below it and
602.56s: now we're covering back down here none
604.88s: of this ultimately matters realistically
607.48s: speaking but it tells me the behavior of
610.84s: people participating in the underlying
612.76s: and what they're doing and I do care
614.68s: about that so if we're able to kind of
617.28s: even kind of turn here a little bit and
619.16s: get back into this consolidation range
620.76s: closer to the point of control that
621.92s: would be fantastic I'd love to see that
624.04s: if not it's not something I'm adding
625.88s: money to until it starts doing that and
628.12s: it's just because I I can't park a bunch
629.96s: of money in there waiting for it and
631.56s: that's that's the tricky part with
633.20s: GameStop is you never know when it's
634.88s: going to go but I also find that it
637.76s: doesn't typically just go out of the
640.16s: blue again even this move here up to 65
643.68s: and I think pre-market it was up to like
645.32s: 80 it it didn't just go from 995 to 80
650.36s: it went from 9.95 here it hit a high of
654.36s: 1288 then here it hit a high of 1745 and
658.88s: so you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 days before we had
664.60s: the first launch here and then a second
667.64s: launch after that and it it's the same
669.60s: thing here right so you still have 1 two
671.56s: three four I think I counted that twice
673.80s: there's four five six 7 8 9 10 days of
677.80s: price movement before it starts to pop
680.44s: up here came back down pop back up all
682.12s: I'm saying here is that I have no
685.36s: problem not bottom ticking it right in
687.76s: this case when I started building my
689.52s: position here I I I didn't care that I
692.36s: was building here and not here that
695.04s: that's okay for me again I'm I'm trying
697.52s: to catch the majority of moves and avoid
701.04s: parking money and something until it
702.72s: starts really exhibiting some behavior
704.84s: in a strong Direction now from a company
708.40s: perspective I I really think GameStop is
711.88s: positioned pretty well and I chuckle at
713.64s: that because I look at the other
714.84s: examples for GameStop things like
716.72s: Blockbuster and what they did and Xerox
719.24s: and what they did and like these other
720.52s: kinds of companies that failed to adapt
723.24s: but they have pretty good leadership
725.72s: that I think is really well in touch I
728.36s: think Cohen is really smart dude they
731.84s: made a really wise at the money offering
734.56s: that I know is a little frustrating for
736.12s: people in terms of moaz and a squeeze
738.76s: but position the company really really
741.00s: well without massive dilution so now
743.56s: they have a ton of cash and they have a
745.72s: really cool roadway ahead of them to now
748.28s: innovate and they have the money to do
751.24s: that which is very cool in my opinion so
754.84s: even as a company like I genuinely do
757.00s: not think that this is anything that
759.36s: people should just Overlook that's one
760.80s: of the most frustrating things I have
762.20s: with folks is when they're like oh it's
763.92s: just a meme stock and it's like I I get
766.40s: how people have been trained to think
768.60s: that but you have to be a little bit
770.80s: more of a a thinker around those kinds
773.00s: of Concepts in my opinion in these kind
774.64s: of products because they seem to have
777.48s: really interesting potential at this
778.88s: point
779.76s: so now let's take a look at the options
782.12s: chain today we saw moderate volume again
787.60s: Lower on the call side than typical in
789.88s: terms of what's exciting we're generally
791.96s: seeing stuff that's over 200,000 calls
793.84s: traded in a day now it's 13 uh 132 772
798.28s: but the put side is very light this is
800.52s: an interesting ratio actually today
802.28s: where it's only 38,000 puts to 132 calls
806.12s: if we take a look at oi I see
809.68s: 729k calls against 400k puts so this is
815.44s: getting closer to being 2 to one which
818.44s: again I that's a more bullish
820.80s: positioning for the options than I see
822.40s: in this is compared to what I see now
825.08s: although this is still very bullish this
826.84s: is why it's important to develop a
828.24s: relationship with products because a lot
830.24s: of times people could see this and be
831.48s: like wow 729 to 49 it's going up but if
834.76s: you don't have the context of what this
836.36s: number has been historically and you
837.64s: don't realize that this relationship is
839.36s: actually low on a comparative basis in
841.80s: terms of call skew to the put side now
844.60s: it's still bullish an arrangement right
846.52s: there's a lot of people speculating to
848.20s: the upside here and they continue to do
849.68s: so what I'm seeing though is more and
851.76s: more of this build out in 16 August
854.12s: that's specifically what I what I want
855.64s: to highlight for you guys I'm not seeing
859.56s: a lot of people moving these positions
861.12s: out to two August there's some but not a
864.28s: lot so if we take a look at a bunch of
866.40s: this volume for today there was a ton on
869.16s: on the what is it the
871.84s: 25s for this week and next week my
876.76s: speculation is that some of these are
878.76s: closing positions and moving out to 2
881.68s: August that's my guess we'll know
883.24s: tomorrow it's a pure guess at this point
885.92s: but what I see at these 25s is
890.24s: 13,770 oi with essentially
893.56s: 11,000 volume today it was 88 over
897.64s: yesterday so people started closing
899.32s: positions out yesterday my guess is more
902.16s: of this 13,000 will be closed out
905.00s: tomorrow and a lot of these my guess is
908.44s: that if we go out into next week we'll
910.72s: be reopened here so right now and
913.48s: actually this is already partially
915.00s: confirmed because the open interest on
918.00s: these is only 7930 and the volume is
920.72s: 9108 so immediately this there's
924.92s: adding volume to this so this number
928.52s: will be positive tomorrow with people
930.20s: moving out to essentially to August but
933.84s: that's essentially where I'm seeing that
936.04s: happen the like the vast majority of the
939.64s: remaining activity that I'm seeing is
941.64s: moving us further out into this 16 a so
945.00s: if we take a look at this front
946.32s: expiration there's
948.08s: 178k calls next expiration is
951.76s: 64 next after that is only
954.36s: 23 and then out in 16 it's 197 so what
958.00s: this further expiration for the first
959.88s: time in a long time actually overwhelms
962.24s: the front expirations and this is just
965.44s: telling me that more and more of the
968.84s: interesting Behavior more likely than
970.76s: not is going to start looking at 16
972.92s: August during the Opex and you can also
975.24s: see this just take a look at the the
976.84s: open interest skew here 197 to 107 this
980.80s: is much closer to 2:1 than when we look
983.28s: across the the broader relationship here
987.12s: so overall it looks like that's where
990.40s: most people are starting to kind of
992.40s: position themselves out into now the
994.72s: other thing I want to look at quick is
996.40s: just the order flow as it's been coming
998.48s: in I'm limiting this by 50 Lots or
1000.88s: higher just to find some of the bigger
1002.72s: trades we have the 26 July 35 calls 1,00
1008.00s: of those for 3 cents that's an
1009.72s: interesting trade to me so somebody
1012.24s: bought those and I'd love to know why
1016.28s: it's not a big trade so I don't really
1018.08s: care about it quite that much but I'm
1020.24s: still curious about it because I mean
1023.32s: you got a day left
1025.52s: so
1027.40s: this this is hard for me to make heads
1029.48s: or tails on whether or not this is just
1031.72s: somebody coming out with a crazy YOLO I
1033.72s: wouldn't put it past somebody or if this
1035.76s: is some sort of institutional hedging
1037.96s: it's hard it's really hard for me to see
1040.36s: but I find that trade generally
1042.32s: interesting now same thing with these 22
1044.92s: puts there's 837 of them but 19 cents
1048.00s: like the problem is a lot of these are
1049.28s: just smaller value there are some decent
1051.40s: value trades like the two hog 20 calls
1054.20s: 310 of those at 350 but most of the
1057.04s: volume that we're seeing today is just
1059.48s: lower premium amounts and this really
1062.36s: doubles down on what we've been seeing
1064.48s: lately in GameStop I'm grabbing unusual
1068.24s: wh so that we could take a look at
1069.76s: today's activity
1071.76s: specifically and we can see what the
1073.64s: premiums were cuz I haven't looked at
1075.00s: this yet and this is interesting there's
1078.32s: some activ here so this was today at
1082.20s: 0710 at the ask 500 of the 20 calls out
1087.52s: in September interesting but that's a
1090.40s: $200,000 position so we're starting to
1092.36s: get some positions showing up that are
1094.24s: breaking you know over $100,000 in
1096.48s: premiums they're all purchased calls but
1099.56s: they're across different time frames so
1101.64s: I see the 20s here in two a I see 16 Jan
1105.40s: 26 kind of really far out this is is a
1109.12s: smaller position but just super far out
1111.60s: in time then 23 this is interesting too
1115.84s: I'm surprised that none of these are for
1117.28s: the primary expiration I have to be
1118.68s: honest with you so when I look at this I
1120.88s: would expect more of them to be in the
1122.52s: 16 Aug uh let me put it side by side
1125.00s: like that maybe easier to see this is
1127.20s: the primary expiration and I don't
1129.56s: actually see a lot of activity going on
1132.36s: there which does surprise me let me take
1134.44s: a look real quick at that cycle
1139.92s: Color Me shocked I'm surprised I'm very
1142.64s: surprised I would have expected some
1145.08s: larger trades happening there this is
1147.28s: very interesting to me so there's
1149.64s: definitely people building side I mean
1151.64s: $200,000 again I know it can be kind of
1153.96s: numbing when we're so used to seeing
1155.92s: somebody like roring kitty who's
1157.28s: dropping these just wildly sized
1161.08s: positions so it can kind of skew your
1162.68s: perception of reality but buying
1164.56s: $200,000 in calls is not insignificant
1168.24s: especially they're essentially the ones
1170.16s: building out this strike so if we go to
1172.44s: 6 September which is just a weird weird
1176.16s: expiration it's almost like tasty trade
1178.52s: esque like 45 days out maybe there's
1180.88s: somebody out there yellowing from tasty
1182.60s: trade that would be hilarious and it was
1185.84s: those 20s right no the Am I Wrong the
1188.80s: 20s yeah the 20s they're essentially the
1192.36s: entire volume for
1194.32s: these there's 46 other people but this
1197.48s: one trade is the overwhelming majority
1200.40s: of this
1201.36s: position
1203.64s: and that's interesting to
1207.40s: me I don't know why you pick this one I
1209.96s: really don't know why you picked this
1211.04s: one because again like if I were to look
1212.92s: at this let's just out of curiosity
1214.24s: let's compare let's go to the 20
1215.84s: September let's check out those
1217.88s: 20s and these are 75 cents wide 530 to
1224.80s: 605 these are $1.70 essentially like
1229.24s: just way more liquid way more
1233.08s: liquid that's nuts to me I don't know
1236.92s: why you would pick this it's just what
1239.08s: I'm highlighting here is for putting on
1240.40s: a larger position this is so a liquid in
1243.20s: comparison to something just one week
1245.32s: after it at the same strike if you like
1247.00s: or even something further in the money
1249.32s: these are
1250.16s: $140 but these are just just relatively
1254.20s: so a liquid and they were the only
1255.96s: person playing in there there was just
1258.04s: there's not not a lot of activity
1260.20s: activity activity happening out here in
1263.64s: six sep actually let's take one last
1266.12s: look here at I just want to see what's
1269.60s: out
1276.12s: there nothing like there's just so
1279.00s: little happening out in this
1280.96s: expiration yeah this I mean this this
1283.60s: dude is out there by
1285.04s: himself interesting trade we'll have to
1287.28s: see well as always that's what I'm
1290.32s: seeing right now if there's anything
1291.64s: else you want me to look over feel free
1293.00s: to send it in I love seeing the emails
1294.68s: and seeing what I can talk about or
1296.12s: answer for you guys be an outlier I'll
1298.48s: see you guys later
