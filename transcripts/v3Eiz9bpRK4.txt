0.00s: What's up, outliers? Happy Friday. I hope we all had a absolutely dope week. There's been
7.96s: no shortage of kind of interesting things going on for us to talk about. But as you know,
14.24s: tonight is options trading for beginners. So we have a pretty distinct agenda that I would
23.34s: like to hit and work through with you all. I want to specifically focus this idea of a trade
30.66s: checklist. And I specifically want to explore how we can think about kind of developing
38.74s: a systematic process before we place a trade. However, I would love to start with some
46.54s: broader Q&A or anything that we've covered so far that you have questions about. And
53.22s: I am happy to talk about it. Looks like we have a couple questions from the beginning.
58.34s: I'm going to hit those. But if you have anything that you want to hit in the beginning, throw
62.90s: it in the chat. And we'll spend a little time upfront about Q&A. And then a little bit
69.58s: later is when we'll dive into the specifics of building this trade checklist. How to think
75.02s: about it. Those kinds of details. There are a lot of different things that we can do in order
82.18s: to make something that's usable, but not a little too over the top. That's kind of a really
87.98s: important step in my opinion. Because if things are too arduous for us to fill out, for example,
94.58s: the probability of us actually adhering to that that checklist or whatever else that we're
100.02s: referencing is very, very low. So that is the idea. I got to turn my air up because it is
107.70s: warm in here. We got the air rocking and rolling now. I think we're in a good spot. So before
114.50s: we get too far into the weeds though, you all know exactly how this goes. I'm going to say hello
119.70s: to everybody. I love checking out who we got hanging out here on a Friday to talk about some
125.70s: options trading. Let me move this chat over here so I can keep an eyeball on all of you. And I see
131.86s: we got Shrej J, Ruta Bega, Joey Elon songs, Ian J, Timmy Peparoni, he's fun. This name always
141.94s: slows me down. Grab a terrorist. That's it. Gravitarist, blizzy, M Ram, blizzy. That's a great name.
149.94s: I like that one. I don't know which one is my favorite. I don't see Roaring Titty. That's normally
154.98s: my favorite. I have to be honest. I do play favorites. Second favorite might be, oh, it's either
162.66s: Ruta Bega, Timmy Peparoni or blizzy. It's probably blizzy. Yeah. I think blizzy. I think you
167.06s: want it here, at least for me in my world. That's a pretty good name. And we have a couple
175.06s: beverages to get us through. I got my water, seltzer, watermelon, and then I have the mango orange.
183.38s: This is the good spindrift. In my opinion, all right. Let us begin. So there was a question.
195.06s: It literally disappeared. I don't know where it went. That's actually super annoying.
200.98s: Did it disappear for you guys too, or is it just me?
203.14s: Interesting. There was a question that somebody dumped in that was sitting at the top.
214.90s: It was something about three rules or something like that. But it's completely gone from my screen.
220.26s: If it's gone for you guys, maybe they pulled their question back or whatever.
224.34s: But I do not see it at this point.
227.54s: Ruta Bega says, I saw the comment flashing disappear. I wonder if it's something with like going
231.22s: on. I don't know. Damn it. Well, I'm sorry. Whoever dropped that question and that's kind of
235.38s: a bummer that it's gone. Feel free to drop it back in. I was going to start with that. But
240.26s: since that's the case, let's pivot over and let's get into the heart and soul. So let's talk
245.30s: about a trade checklist. When we think about this idea of a trade checklist, why is this important
252.58s: to us? And I know it's kind of a boring topic. It's not that fun. There's nothing really that
257.06s: quirky about it. It's not super engaging. However, oh, Emram, you the man. Thank you.
264.26s: It says, what are a few rules to live by when trading options? When you are determining your position,
270.82s: positioning into a trade, what are key indicators that you look out for before entering?
274.82s: Thank you so much, Emram, for getting that comment back up. Because I actually thought the
278.82s: question was really good. I felt bad that it had dropped off. Thank you for saving it.
282.34s: Okay, that's a fantastic question. So let's talk about it with this question specifically,
291.70s: if I were to think about a handful of rules to live by when trading options,
297.38s: the very first one is in my opinion, you need to focus on the profit mechanism first.
305.86s: That's one of the most difficult parts with options. Because when we're trading options,
309.70s: we want to start trading options very quickly. And I don't know if people fully understand
316.34s: how misguided that is, in my opinion, the reason why it's so misguided is because options are simply
324.18s: products. There are things we can trade. There are a type of security. If you don't have
331.46s: a good grasp of profit mechanisms, options won't help you. They will not save you. They do not
339.62s: generate some sort of inherent edge that you can tap into and take advantage of. It really is
348.18s: kind of problematic actually. So in my opinion, that's probably one of the biggest initial steps to
356.50s: focus on is to make sure that you actually identify profit mechanisms. So for those that are listening
365.78s: in, what do you think that means? Like what is that? When I'm talking about profit mechanisms like
373.06s: this, how do we do that? So if we think about the process of building a strategy, kind of trying
380.74s: to create success and doing this long term, I talk about this idea of profit mechanisms all the time.
385.62s: So what does that actually mean? How do we do that? There's really a handful of things that you
392.34s: can make money from in the stock market. It's starting there. So for example, if I'm looking at
398.90s: something like SMCI, there's actually a profit mechanism in this stock right here that's going sideways.
405.30s: That's been range bound from 955 down to a low of 716, which 200 points is kind of big. But range
414.26s: bound for the product itself, there's a way you can trade this. And for something like this,
420.90s: I look more towards volatility because it absolutely has a volatility edge that is baked into it
427.78s: in terms of variance risk premiums. So profit mechanism simply put is how does something make money?
437.70s: Options is not a profit mechanism. So the first rule to live by when trading options is to focus
447.14s: first on the profit mechanism. The second rule to live by when trading options is you cannot take
455.30s: a haphazard approach to trading them. You have to go through the process of testing things to see not
463.06s: only what works well in general, but also what works well for you, the trader. You have the last
471.22s: say in terms of what makes sense for you. What doesn't make sense for you? That matters a lot.
476.50s: And I actually just finished a podcast episode with humble trader who was actually very, it was a great
482.18s: conversation. I enjoyed it a lot. And she has a completely different approach to markets than I do.
487.14s: She is essentially looking to trade intraday the vast majority of her book. And there's nothing
495.62s: wrong with that. But it's very different than what I do yet it seems like it's working for her.
502.18s: So does that mean that because it doesn't work for me, that it doesn't work at all? No, it means that
508.98s: we as individual traders need to find what works for us as individual traders. So rule number two in
516.18s: this case is once we identify some sort of profit mechanism that makes sense is you can't take this
522.98s: haphazard approach to things. You have to be pretty methodical in how you're going to try to learn
528.26s: and build strategies. It can't be this shotgun blast of randomly trying something for a little bit
534.58s: and then randomly switching over to something else for a little bit because you're not going to get
539.54s: you're literally not going to get anywhere like that. So let's rule number two. And then I would leave
544.42s: maybe rule number three. And for those that are in the chat, I just dropped a video about like how to
550.98s: create consistently profitable option strategies. And then I think I have another couple videos actually.
558.18s: This one's about like how to create a strategy in how to create a strategy in five steps.
567.46s: A lot of stuff on strategies. Don't I? Huh? Look at me go. And then I think I have one other video that
573.38s: I want to share with you guys that's more broad about essentially trading options.
583.38s: Successfully. Give me one sec. Let me see if I can find it real quick. This one.
595.46s: Perfect. So those three videos I think are reasonable views for you guys on the topic.
601.14s: So that's number two. And then number three is I think you can't be a bullshit artist. And like
607.38s: if I were to boil it down to three rules, that's that's probably it. What I mean by you can't be a
611.46s: bullshit artist is if you are unable to brutally and honestly dissect what you're doing yourself,
621.14s: your decision process. If you cannot, if you do not have the capacity to do that and you find
626.98s: yourself giving yourself excuses or saying, Oh, well, I was tired or oh, this or oh, that.
633.22s: This isn't going to work. It's not going to work. You cannot approach trading, especially
638.34s: something like options, which are so dynamic without taking full in utter responsibility
644.90s: for literally everything about what you're doing. So if I were to think about the three rules,
650.74s: essentially those that's what they are profit mechanisms first, you need a defined approach
656.58s: and you have you have to take responsibility for every step of what you do.
663.46s: I think that's kind of how I would boil it down.
667.38s: Policies they can generate an ordinate risk. They can. And that's that's one of the tricky things.
672.34s: It looks like the mic might be blowing out one second. It looks like it's like kind of loud for
678.10s: you guys. I don't want to kill your ears. So I just turned the mic down a little bit. Let me know
684.18s: if that's better. I can never tell how loud it is, but I don't want to be too loud. That might be,
690.58s: let me know if that's good. I if not you guys can always raise your volume up because my voice
696.58s: changes a lot in terms of how loud I am. So that's not always listen or friendly, but I am I am
702.74s: emphatic about trading options. So that's how she goes. Ruta Biggest says it sounds fine. Great.
709.46s: That's good news. Good news for everybody. So yeah, those are kind of the few rules I would give.
716.98s: Then the next one here it says when you are determining your positioning into a trade,
721.30s: what are key indicators that you look out for before entering? That's actually great. That's like
725.14s: a perfect segue into this idea about trading trading options and creating like a trading checklist.
732.82s: So we'll talk about that a lot. The sheet says you need to reduce the speed to 0.75. That's so
739.14s: funny because when I talk about this stuff, I literally feel like I'm talking actually kind of slow
745.46s: because I try not to go overly too fast. But the way that my brain works with just about everything is
752.58s: I'm like grossly obsessed with efficiency. So I always look at it as more information in less time.
760.26s: If you ever like if you catch me when I'm out walking my dog or whatever, I almost always have
766.34s: my phone playing a podcast or an audiobook and it's literally at least at 2.2 times speed.
772.74s: I typically try to get like to two and a half. Two and a half is really difficult because you
776.98s: have to like focus pretty damn hard. So yeah, it's interesting. But yeah, that's it's a funny joke
788.90s: anyways, I enjoy it. The sheet says I joked on discord. I love the speeches joke. We can always
793.06s: replay. Yeah, exactly that's exactly how I think about it is I try to be mindful of everybody's time.
798.66s: All right, so we will get into the trading checklist in a second. It looks like there's another
803.14s: question from Al Fons. Al Fons. Oh god, yo, these names are so freaking tricky. Al Fons,
814.26s: Z L. Okay, okay, my third grade teacher would say sound it out. Al Fons, ZO and then and then
825.30s: were were fucked because I don't know I don't know how to okay, third grade teacher. How do I
830.50s: sound out something? I don't know how to sound out. Dingo, Dingo, dyngio, dingo, alf, al,
841.38s: joey's helping me here. Alf, on ZO, dingo, alfons, oh dingo. That's weird.
852.02s: Sounds like a dingo, a chababy, alfons, oh dingo. That's from tropic thunder. I love that scene
858.26s: actually. It's absolutely hilarious, but to cross some fucking lines. Okay, so alfons dingo says
865.78s: why the focus on gm e there are plenty of stocks with consistent daily volatility. The gas
870.66s: twins have at average daily volatility of over 6% and every day for years. It's a great question.
877.06s: So first, I'm curious if you guys have an idea why I'm so enthralled by GameStop. There's a few
883.78s: things that feed into it. Trade J has got the joke. I love that. What do you mean you people? What do
889.70s: you mean you people? So what is it about GameStop? I've been trading for, this is my 17th year of
896.82s: trading now. So I'm coming up on 17 years. What is it about GameStop that you guys think I'm so
903.62s: interested in? Because to alfons, alfons, oh dingo to their point, it's clearly not about volatility.
919.54s: Gravitaris says puzzle to solve. That's a, that is the biggest component to it that I can think of.
926.90s: Benoit says it's an expos a human behavior that is also absolutely correct. Yeah. You guys are
933.30s: literally highlighting essentially all of the pieces that make it so special. The punchline is to
939.62s: why is because it is weird. That's what it comes down to. I have spent thousands and
947.14s: literally tens of thousands of hours in markets, tens of thousands. Like I look at this stuff a lot.
954.66s: I've seen a lot over that time frame. It is not common that I come across things, especially at
961.86s: this point in my trading career, that are weird, that are just weird. And something like GameStop
968.42s: is that it's just weird. It has so many things about it that make it weird. It has this
977.62s: element of what I would consider to be market manipulation happening. And again, you guys know that
984.34s: I do everything I can to be objective. I do everything that I can to look at data and call it
990.58s: objectively, especially with the GameStop stuff. Because so many people I find have been in it for
995.86s: so long that they default to everything being rigged and the systems bullshit and the guys
1005.38s: trying to kill the little man and all that kind of stuff, which I get their sentiment. But it's not
1009.86s: my sentiment. I don't align with that fully. I find myself towards the middle because there's
1014.42s: other people that are like, the market's perfect. Everything's perfectly priced. Everything's fair.
1019.22s: That's also kind of bullshit. I don't agree with that either. I'm very much towards the middle.
1027.06s: And when I look at something like GameStop, it has interesting price behavior. It has an
1033.14s: interesting backstory and an interesting community. When I've been thinking the apes and really the
1039.62s: GameStop community writ large for letting me be a guest in their space. Because I've said that a
1044.50s: million times in its to truth, I view myself as a guest in the house. And I love how much people
1052.74s: are willing to share with me about their experience with the product. There's literally an entire
1057.62s: culture around it. Then you add on the layers of seeming nefarious actors from a short seller side.
1066.58s: Then you add on the layer of Ryan Cohen essentially intervening while it's seemingly going
1072.82s: under undergoing seller boxing. Then you add in some random ass dude from the internet that puts
1079.54s: band-aids on his face and starts a live stream, pretending to be dead. And he has hundreds of millions
1085.30s: of dollars and he trades the product the way he trades it. It's like everything about it is a
1092.02s: freaking crazy story. It has all of the elements of an insane story. And if you look at the price
1099.06s: behavior, it moves in such a way that has elements of predictability. I don't know what they are.
1107.38s: And I want to know what they are. That's a big part of this is that there is there is some sort
1114.74s: of solution to this thing because it moves in certain ways, whether it's from settlement cycles,
1120.58s: FDD juggling, whether it's from op-ex tailwinds, whether it's from other ETF creation redemption
1130.50s: cycles, it's hard to say. So the cliff notes version of why I've been very focused on GameStop
1138.58s: from a personal perspective is that there's all of that interest. The second reason and then I'll
1143.70s: leave it here so I'm not on the point for too long, but I think it's still pertinent is I think
1149.62s: GameStop is a fantastic learning vehicle for people, even people in my community that like that have
1157.06s: been with me since I started back in 2020. For people that have been with me over that time frame,
1163.06s: they're mostly options traders. They're trying to become better options traders and that's that's
1167.86s: their angle on this stuff. Now to that end, you can learn so much about options derivatives,
1178.82s: market, literally how the market operates through a vector like GameStop that you don't experience
1186.02s: before that. So for people that are listening from my viewership that did not know about GameStop
1192.10s: much before this conversation, how many of them would be really well versed on something like
1198.10s: FDDs, even what it is, not even well versed, but know about it and know about how it could impact
1204.18s: things or reg show. If you're not in a product like this, you don't see a lot of that stuff. So
1211.22s: there is a ton, a ton of things that really fascinate me about the product on a personal level.
1219.46s: It's something that's extremely, extremely tradable. I've made good money trading this and I intend
1225.86s: to continue doing that. I already told you guys that that's one of the funniest things about this.
1230.18s: Is the way that I stumbled across this, is it popped up on some of my scans for a few days and
1235.06s: then I was just like, I'll speculate in this. And then all of a sudden it starts making these crazy
1241.22s: moves. I'm trading it just because of the way that I look at markets. And then I've started getting
1246.98s: caught up on what was going on, the actors, because when I look at the original move,
1253.78s: which I also trade it, that's like that's the thing is I'm not new to GameStop itself. I've
1258.90s: traded it back here. You can't miss this kind of stuff if you're a trader. Like you know these
1264.10s: things are happening and you try to make money with them. So I'm not new to the product, but I'm
1271.14s: new to the story. That's the way I look at it. So, but it's something you can make a lot of money
1277.14s: trading. Now, I have to admit, for a lot of people that are like solely in on GameStop, it pains me
1283.30s: to see the way a lot of them trade it. It pains me to see people that take their life savings and
1289.38s: they put it on zero DTE super far out of the money calls because of Bloomberg terminal guy on
1296.18s: Reddit says I have super secret squirrel information that will change everything. That that sucks just
1304.26s: from the perspective. I like the reason why I started doing the YouTube channel thing in general,
1309.46s: I say this a lot too. It's not because I have the fucking looks to be on camera. I don't belong on
1314.18s: camera, but it's to try and help people. So it's painful to see people that I would love to try
1320.50s: to help in some capacity still making those kinds of choices. That's always a bit of a bummer.
1325.30s: But one of my hopes and the third thing I will say in terms of why GameStop interest me so much is
1332.50s: I really, really do hope to share at least small tidbits of information that people can learn
1339.22s: and integrate into what they're doing that will be useful to them. That's why I do all of this.
1344.82s: So those are the reasons big answer, but it is a really dynamic product that I can go, I really can
1352.10s: go on and on about this is why I'm doing a live stream with Newton tomorrow. You and I have talked,
1357.14s: I mean, we text each other every day about GameStop and what's going on.
1361.38s: So it's a mix of interest in product. It's a mix of one hell of a story and puzzle.
1370.58s: And it's a mix of a great learning vehicle that you can make a lot of money in. That's how I think about it.
1377.94s: All right, back up to the questions though.
1380.10s: Nick says, how do you typically handle position sizing on options?
1394.98s: Good question. So let's think about that. If I'm thinking about sizing a position,
1404.74s: where do you think the starting point is? Do you guys have any ideas? And I think I have
1410.74s: a question.
1411.22s: I'm not sure if it's in my handy dandy. This thing is becoming a bear, by the way. It's kind of fun.
1418.50s: I'm just going to keep building this thing out until until it's like this disgustingly long.
1424.18s: Can't even read it. There's so much crap in it. Deck.
1429.70s: Paul says two to three percent risk. No, absolutely not. It's a good guess, by the way, but absolutely not.
1437.14s: Any other guesses? I don't know if I have that in here.
1442.98s: Well, we have another one that I have to add.
1453.62s: Truck complain says risk tolerance. That is the closest answer.
1456.58s: Roaring Titty, I will always say your name because I love it so much. Welcome to the stream, by the way.
1461.78s: Not Delta and Jase's allocation close. That's very close. All right, so let's talk about it.
1468.34s: Here's the way I think about it. When I'm looking at sizing a trade, the very first thing I need to know
1474.82s: is what does my portfolio look like and what does it need? Based on that, it's the first step.
1482.74s: So let's pretend I'm in a world where the portfolio can take on any sort of risk, meaning
1490.26s: it's open for anything. It's not restricted in any sort of way.
1494.34s: And let's pretend that I don't care what I put on. I don't have some sort of
1499.94s: strong directional lean and stuff like that. The reason why I'm foregoing all of those nuances
1505.38s: is because they're important to call out. But if I go through them all, the answer is very, very long.
1511.46s: So I'm trying to give you guys the important bits. And I also have a video that literally talks
1521.94s: about this exact thing in depth. So I'll throw that in there for you guys. It's called how I size
1526.90s: option straights. But here's the takeaway. The way I think about it, let's say it's something
1534.58s: like GameStop. Great example. This would fall into the speculative allocation of my portfolio.
1543.38s: So what this looks like is if I show you guys how I think about my portfolio.
1552.34s: This. So when I think about this, I have two buckets. I have a core allocation and I have a
1561.06s: speculative allocation. So when I'm trading something like GameStop, it falls into the speculative
1570.10s: speculative allocation of the portfolio. So with that, it gets a different amount of money
1579.06s: right from the jump. And how much money it gets is completely dependent on the current market
1584.74s: circumstances as annoying of an answer as that is. It is the honest one. It's not a set amount.
1590.50s: But let's say that the general parameters for speculative trades is no more than 25% of the account.
1598.66s: And you might hear that and think that that's a whole lot. It can be a lot. I'm not afraid
1604.18s: of putting a lot of the portfolio into a specific trade. I also give myself a massive,
1610.74s: massive birth to work through. So in general, my speculative trades would get about 10%.
1620.74s: Maybe of the portfolio 5 to 10% probably in terms of risk.
1627.06s: So Nick says, is the PowerPoint downloadable on the paid side of Discord or Patreon? It is not.
1633.54s: The reason why it is not is because it is nowhere near done. I'm using it honestly just as like a
1638.82s: personal reference as I'm doing like different podcasts and I'm working with different platforms
1644.10s: like Irvin and yeah, stuff like that. So it's just a place to reference stuff. I haven't really
1651.46s: built it to be externally available. So anyways, back to the sizing. I'm focusing on the risk
1660.26s: side of the equation. So you can size things based off of how much capital in the account you want
1668.42s: to give something, which is okay, that's fine. That's still part of my equation by the way.
1672.58s: But then there's also the sizing based on risk and it's a they go hand in hand. So let's say for
1678.74s: example, I look at GameStop and let's say that I'm trading what size portfolio do we want to use
1684.34s: for the example? We can use whatever example you guys want and then I'll tailor it to that.
1691.62s: Try it. I would say at least $500. I knew it was going to be something like that. I hate that so much.
1698.50s: Yeah, Reese, I like that number like $20,000. I would say I was going to say at least at least $15,000.
1708.74s: At least. So in worry Titt, roaring titties equation of 500 bucks, like if that's the portfolio size
1718.26s: genuinely, I would just save my money. It's just you're just so you're just so much better off
1724.50s: just saving the money. And I know that that's an annoying answer and I know that that's not
1728.58s: going to move any merch in terms of selling courses and shit, but I don't have a course to sell by
1735.06s: the way. But the point is it's such a disadvantaged amount of capital that the overwhelming
1743.22s: probability in that scenario that you're going to do something productive is so unbelievably low.
1749.62s: I wouldn't necessarily call it zero, but it is damn close.
1754.82s: So I wouldn't do that. Now let's say that we have the $20,000 portfolio. And let's say that we're okay.
1766.74s: In that case, I would be much more careful with how much risk I would allow on individual trade.
1772.90s: I would definitely say I would not allow more than 5% risk. And if I was trading something like
1777.94s: GameStop personally, it would be closer than like 2% risk. It's just because I know the way it moves.
1784.82s: And with that little of an account trading a small account like that, your biggest your biggest job
1792.34s: is to avoid drawdowns. It's not to aggressively grow the account trading because again,
1798.74s: the probability of doing that with the small amount of money is so unbelievably low. And I don't
1805.54s: say that to dissuade anybody. It's the exact opposite of what my objective is, but it's to be honest.
1811.70s: And I've been doing this a while. So I say it with pretty strong conviction that I think for the
1819.14s: vast majority of people trying to trade something like this with a really small account are probably
1824.50s: doing more harm than good to themselves. I would never say don't trade it. It moves very, very
1830.18s: interestingly. So that's why I say in the example of a $20,000 account, let's say that we choose
1837.78s: to give the position maybe 2% risk. Now, the way that you're carrying the rest of the portfolio matters
1845.70s: quite a lot. The reason why it matters so much is because depending on how you're trying to make
1853.06s: your money will be a strong determining factor of how to set this thing up. So to cut through all
1862.10s: of that and to start answering the question succinctly, let's say that you have really, really,
1868.74s: really strong conviction in GameStop. And you absolutely want to have a portion of your portfolio
1877.62s: here. Okay. So then in that case, if my conviction is really strong, maybe instead of 2%, I would take
1884.58s: the total risk allowable maybe to 5%, but at 5%, it's like done. You can't go back in. So I would
1891.94s: try to split that 5% maybe into a couple of different trades knowing the way that this thing can
1897.86s: work. So what that would do is then say of this $20,000, 5% allowable rest takes me to what,
1904.74s: a thousand bucks. If I take 2.5% half of that, then that gives me essentially $500 risk per
1912.26s: opportunity. That's what I would use to size the trade. So in this case, let's say that I wanted to
1920.34s: put on a trade and I know from the jump what my max risk is going to be 500 bucks so that I can
1926.66s: try to take more than one shot at this. So let's say what would that look like? Well, there's another
1933.62s: part of the equation that is to be considered in my opinion. And there's a couple different ways
1941.94s: that you can think about it. But I could say, well, let's just say I think GameStop is going up
1948.74s: from here. I probably would wait personally. Like if I were to play this like right now, I already
1954.42s: told you guys I flattened my options trades back here. Like I'm I took the option trades down and I
1960.02s: just have long shares right now that I'm holding. And one of the main reasons why I'm holding
1964.34s: the long shares is more so just to support the movement is just to try to be a part of it with
1969.06s: you guys. But anyways, so if though I wanted to trade this to the upside and I know that I can
1976.50s: risk 500 bucks, I'm bullish. Then I would go through the strategy selection process figuring out
1982.18s: what I want to put on, what duration, how it fits with the analysis, how it fits with the portfolio,
1986.74s: yada yada yada. All of that though matters. That's why I mentioned it because without going through
1993.30s: that process, it is semi less informed when you're actually getting ready to place your trade.
2001.94s: So in this case, let's say that I decide that I want to go out to 20 September. And I want to
2006.90s: put on a trade that's bullish. So maybe I pick. I hate these options. The reason why I hate these
2018.34s: options is because they're they're like not liquid. Just like
2027.22s: these are not much better. This looks like the best bet right here. Now this is also because the
2033.70s: markets closed and all that kind of stuff. But these are 30 cents wide. So let's just call it these.
2039.86s: And you could put on a trade in these. It would cost you $6.15. If we analyze this trade,
2050.42s: the total risk in this trade right now is $6.15. That does not mean I'm going to hold this
2058.10s: until these are zero. If I do that, I've made a massive error in what I'm doing. And I am straight
2066.66s: up a sleep at the wheel. So in this scenario, I would say, where's my floor per game stop? Where do I
2076.26s: think that I would essentially manage risk to the downside? So let's go to this on the 17th of May.
2084.26s: The reason why I want 17th of May is just to cut this move out so that this part of the chart
2090.42s: has some depth to it. Because right now it's all so flat and congested because of this move.
2096.26s: So what I would do is change the range here. And what did I say May 17th? So we'll go to May 17th.
2105.38s: Until today. And then we can look at it on a daily still. That's fine. I just want the chart to move
2116.50s: a little bit so that I can see things. So in this case, I would determine where I think support is.
2125.46s: And again, this is under the assumption of a bullish trade. So for me, you can literally see
2130.58s: where I think it is, at least as of right now. This is where my initial stop would be set.
2136.10s: 2329, that's where it would be flattened. Cool. Now I know where I would get out. So now I need to go
2144.74s: back. And I need to see where I can size this trade at at 2329, which funny enough, it's literally
2151.54s: like a one standard deviation down move. So right here, this one.
2163.30s: So at that one standard deviation down move, I would lose $100. But I know I'm okay losing $500.
2171.78s: So that means that I can actually increase my trade size. It's going to take up more money
2176.90s: upfront, but I know I'm going to manage it. So in this case, instead of putting on one and using
2182.74s: this as the total risk and the trade, because I know I'm going to manage it, in this case, maybe I
2186.90s: do four. So then as long as the account can handle putting on a trade of this size, I don't know
2193.06s: what this would be as a percentage of the total account. What is it? 615 times 42460. So it's about 10%
2201.22s: a little over 10% capital allocation on the account. And I don't care so much about that.
2209.06s: Now if you're in a capital constrained account, obviously you would care about that. And you have
2214.34s: to be very careful about where you choose to place your money. And you would have to then say,
2219.54s: okay, this would be the maximum allowable size based on my risk management protocols.
2225.54s: Cool. We know the answer to that. However, if we're in a, if we're in a small account that's
2233.54s: constrained by size, then you might say, but I can't put two grand into this position. I need that
2240.34s: money to be able to put into other stuff. So you've created a parameter for yourself right from
2246.10s: the jump. We've looked at what we're able to risk. We've looked at what we can size it at given
2252.42s: risk as the metric. And then we're bouncing it off the portfolio. This is how I would size this
2258.42s: trade. The process that I just walked you through is about the same, but it looks slightly different.
2267.14s: And I need to update the title to this video. Because we just talked a lot about sizing
2275.86s: trades. And I think it's good. All right. Now, the other part of this equation before I would ever
2287.94s: considering hitting the launch button is to validate the expected return of the trade. That's a really
2296.18s: important step in this process. Because when I look at something like GameStop, one of the things
2305.30s: I would need to do is say, okay, I know where my risk is. Right. So if I trade down at my risk,
2311.62s: I know that I'm essentially risking two and a half percent of my portfolio.
2322.66s: That's not an insignificant amount of money. So where do I think it might go and how
2328.90s: reasonable is it that it might go there? Well, it's kind of one of the cool things about options
2335.62s: is we can use that to figure this out. So let's say based on a chart perspective, this looks like
2341.06s: where the ceiling is just about 28 and a half ish. Right. I can see that that's where these two
2348.50s: hovered on. That's where it hit over here. Yada yada yada. Whatever you do for your technical analysis,
2353.94s: let's just say that I think this might be 28 and a half to the upside. Okay, cool. What do I make
2361.30s: at 28 and a half to the upside? I make a thousand and thirty three dollars. So now we're almost done
2370.98s: with this process. I have where is it? Move. Here it is. So in the I'm grabbing excerpt from
2388.98s: an expected return calculator that I have. So let's say that you have one trade that you're
2395.22s: going to put on. And in this case, the profit potential on the trade I told you guys is
2402.90s: 28 and a half at that. It would be worth about 10, 21 ish. So let's say my profit potential is 10,
2410.02s: 21 bucks. And the loss potential is negative. Would we say negative 400 ish? Something like that.
2422.90s: Yeah. So in this case, it would be negative 400. So in this scenario, I'm thinking about putting on
2429.38s: something that might make 10, 21 or it might lose 400. However, there's an important gap in this
2441.46s: analysis. Do you guys know what the gap in the analysis is? And let me see if I can find that
2449.78s: other window so I can just create like a blank slide for us to look at together. This will work fine.
2458.50s: Time. That's part of it. That's not what I'm looking at here, but I like what you're saying. That's not it.
2468.66s: One to two and a half. That's not it either.
2474.90s: As soon as I post this in, you guys will then probably know exactly what it is.
2480.10s: IV. Nope. Probability is trucking plane for the wind. Ding ding ding. That's it. So if I use this,
2487.06s: I actually think I have a video coming out tomorrow about this. Let me double check. Yeah, that's
2491.86s: funny. I literally have a video coming. Man, you guys are so good at like leading me into segues.
2497.54s: There's a video I have coming out tomorrow called managing options positions in expected return,
2502.02s: literally in GME. That's hilarious. But anyways, we can give you guys a preamble here. We're missing
2508.42s: these two things. The probability of making money and the probability of losing money. Just because I say
2515.62s: I'm going to try to make 1021. That doesn't mean I'm going to make 1021. That's not what that means
2522.42s: at all. It just means that's what I'm trying to make. That's what I think is reasonable based on
2526.90s: the chart. But that doesn't mean that that's in reality what this is. So then we need to go through
2534.10s: the rest of the process exactly as you guys outlined. And the video tomorrow will go through the
2540.10s: rest of that process. So I'm actually not going to double tap it here because it goes through
2544.82s: literally the entire thing in depth. So I will share a link to the video that's coming out tomorrow.
2553.14s: And it'll be out in the morning at 715 AM. There you guys go. You won't be able to access it now
2561.46s: because when it's scheduled, I wish YouTube would let me do that by the way. I think it'd be really
2565.38s: cool if the video is scheduled and people could still see it. But for whatever reason when it's
2569.06s: scheduled, you can't see it through the link. It's kind of annoying. That thing would be cool to
2572.66s: like give you guys a sneak really peak. That would be fun. But this is what we need to fill in next
2578.42s: because this is then how we determine the expected return on the position to then finally validate
2584.42s: if this thing makes sense. So good, good point. All right, back into the chat to see if there's any
2593.70s: other questions that we want to hit. Roryn TV says, do you use hotkeys? I'm really struggling to
2598.42s: exit my orders fast enough, fumbling through order tickets. I do not. I do not trade anything that
2603.78s: requires moving that fast. If I traded something that required moving that fast, I, I mean, I probably
2611.22s: just wouldn't do it, to be honest, like if the speed of my execution requiring hotkeys to get
2617.06s: in or out, that means I'm competing and doing the wrong thing in my opinion.
2623.22s: That's a really tough way to make money trading personally. So no, I don't. Not really.
2630.26s: Joey says, this is maybe think I've been too conservative, very likely. I absolutely do not,
2642.18s: I do not doubt that. I think a lot of people have a terrible approach with respect to trade sizing.
2647.46s: That's actually why I shared that other video as well. And it's, it's so important to get it right.
2655.06s: Because if you don't do that, then you essentially don't give yourself an opportunity to make money.
2664.74s: Like that's essentially what it comes up with.
2670.50s: Noah, Noah's Ark, Noah, what up Noah? Noah says, I know you don't like spreading hyperfied,
2676.02s: but I'd love your perspective and prediction on what potentially could happen with GME after
2680.26s: this Max Payne. It's Max Payne. And I'm assuming that you're referring to the video that I made a
2686.34s: little bit earlier today for those that haven't seen it yet. You could check it out here. It goes
2692.66s: into the concept of Max Payne, a little more in depth and how it works. Just because I know for
2698.34s: the GME crowd, the GME folks are like very, very interested in Max Payne. And I actually think
2705.14s: sometimes it can be blamed maybe a little bit too much. But in this case, I do think, especially
2712.90s: today that there's some element of it. But from a probabilistic scenario, the short answer is
2718.10s: normally there's a reversion the week after. That's just citing the output of that study.
2724.34s: So if you're a believer of that, then that's what you would expect. If you have a different way
2732.26s: of synthesizing the recent market transactions or kind of the market trend, then it would be a
2740.90s: slightly different answer because I think a couple of things going on with GameStop right now,
2744.74s: one of which is small caps are down. And that just does not help GameStop. I'm not saying that
2750.74s: that's like the primary profit driver. It's not. But it's also not something that's not
2758.02s: involved in the equation. I don't know if I did the double negative right there. You guys will have
2761.62s: to fact check me. But that is what that is what I think. So because if we take a look at this
2772.66s: and we look at small caps, they're still pretty mixed. They're not doing terribly, but the majority
2779.86s: of them are still negative. They're still bound. So that's a little bit of a problem. And it adds
2786.42s: this just pull specifically to something like GameStop beyond the fact that literally the entire
2792.66s: market was down today, like everything was down a bit today. So that doesn't necessarily help much.
2801.46s: Now it's been running around this point of control for weeks now. We started moving about the point
2810.18s: of control back on the 10th of last month, where it has just been transacting around this over
2818.66s: and over and over again. It's literally just oscillating sideways through it. So people are very
2825.54s: willing to transact here. That's what it tells me. And that's where the overwhelming volume has
2830.90s: occurred. There's not that many people below this. So when I look at this, I do kind of question
2837.62s: in terms of like how low does it go? Because it is struggling to be moved lower.
2846.98s: It's had, I know it's so difficult to see because this chart is so flat because of this move.
2852.42s: We can actually just get rid of it for a second. And I don't know how to slide this thing down though.
2860.10s: And by. So this to this was like a 20% return. So seeing something kind of come down after a 20%
2872.98s: return and I oscillate sideways for a little bit, like that's okay to me. Now I don't think it
2878.82s: necessarily has the wind at its back though. That is one of the problems I think we have here
2885.06s: is when I look at the breadth of the market, this is starting to turn really not great.
2894.42s: So we had net highs running for a while now. Like this is the first time we've seen them run
2901.22s: like this since back in May. And we were definitely starting to gain a lot of steam. We hit a peak.
2910.90s: And I mean, this is like a precipitous down move from this peak. We went from 458 net highs to
2918.66s: 322 to 157 to negative 51. That is a big rotation in companies making highs. That is not insignificant.
2930.82s: And then if we take a look at another index quick. So we don't just have to look at the the NASDAQ. I
2939.14s: like looking at the New York Stock Exchange as well because it's a little more encompassing.
2944.02s: It's just barely hanging in there still as compared to the NASDAQ.
2949.70s: So that's what you're seeing here. It's not anything that I feel like it's not anything that you
2957.54s: can kind of dismiss. And it's something that will serve as a bit of a headwind going on. So
2965.30s: yeah, that's kind of the short term thoughts on what we're seeing here, at least in my opinion,
2971.14s: for whatever that's worth.
2979.38s: Model Blunder says it was a good video on Max Payne. Just watch it. That's awesome. Don't
2982.74s: forget to like it. Helped me show up in the YouTube algorithm. We're still trying to grow, man.
2987.14s: Right now my goal for the year was to hit 25,000 subs. And it looks like we're on track pretty
2994.42s: strong. It looks like we might hit that in the next like maybe four weeks or so. That would be
2998.98s: really, really cool. That has been my near that has been the annual target for a while. So yeah,
3006.18s: anyways, back over to this. Kirby says, what beer are you sipping on? Just curious about your
3014.18s: choice of recap beer. Oh, check out this recap beer. I got you. There she is in all our glories.
3024.42s: Actually, I don't know if does that come through? I can't tell if it gets hold on. There you go.
3033.62s: It like hold on. There you go. There it is in it in all its glory.
3041.94s: Bam, a little bit of spin drift, mango orange. I like this one a lot. It's my favorite.
3047.46s: It's a good one.
3056.34s: Let's see what else you guys got. Nick says we lost the 50 day MA watch for that to hold. That's
3060.82s: probably a pivot point outside of the 200 week SMA. I don't know about the moving averages in GME.
3067.94s: I'll actually take that as a homework item for you guys. I study moving averages on just about
3073.62s: every product that I trade. I don't know them in GameStop. Moving average behavior in GME.
3080.74s: I'll probably look at something like the maybe the nine, the 20, the 50, the one,
3091.30s: 50, and the 200 probably just the 200 not the 150. I'll take a look at that and I will follow up
3098.98s: with you guys. I owe you an answer there. I think for this specifically, it looks like
3109.94s: yeah, it's hard to make heads or tails on how it behaves around right like this. It moves about
3119.30s: it a lot. Nick says 5200 SMA or the best to watch. That is a really stand right. It's called the
3129.94s: Golden Cross and it's called that for a reason. It's a very, very standard. The problem is for
3135.70s: something like GameStop is it has its problems right like if you look at the lagging on the 200,
3143.86s: which is picking up stuff like this. This lag in the 200 makes it difficult right like by the time
3153.14s: you get the quote unquote death cross, which is 50 under 200. This thing will have already moved
3158.74s: down 10 points right. It'd be a massive down move. So yeah, in standard products, I agree with you.
3166.10s: The 50 200 is a very, very standardized moving average combination that's pretty efficacious.
3173.06s: But in something like this, I actually am not sure if I would lean too heavily on it.
3178.10s: I say that on all the videos that I'm analyzing GameStop is that I don't think that this thing
3183.46s: follows a lot of the normal rules. So I always call that out because I think it's important,
3189.54s: at least the way that I perceive its behavior around different technical levels is completely different.
3195.62s: Cool. It looks like I'm caught up on the questions. Let's talk about this trade checklist now.
3206.82s: This is a bit of an older one and I probably need to update it with a few things, but I think
3213.54s: it's a good place to start. The way I look at a trade checklist, there's two pieces to it.
3218.98s: There's a pre-trade checklist and then there's a post trade. I typically call the post trade
3224.66s: and AAR after action review or after action report. This is just a military term, but it's a
3231.70s: post trade checklist. This is the same thing. So if you hear me flow between them colloquially,
3235.46s: that's what I mean. You have the pre-trade checklist and then you have the AAR.
3240.18s: So let's talk about some of the bigger components of it and then we can discuss a little bit about
3248.66s: how to create your own because that's what this is for. I'm going through this to give you guys
3253.54s: ammunition to make your own. So the way that I'm picking this checklist up is that you've already
3261.06s: gone through your trade analysis. You've already found that it fits the portfolio and all of those
3269.86s: kinds of things. We know we want to put the trade on. That's essentially where this is picking up
3273.78s: from. So once that happens, we're going to verify that the product itself fits our general criteria
3282.10s: and we know what's coming up. So the first step in this checklist for me is like a broad screen
3288.02s: of the product and the environment. That's what this is. Then I'm going to make sure that I have a
3293.78s: specific hypothesis. So the reason why this happens all the way down here in the trade checklist
3298.98s: after I'm saying we already know I want to put it on is it goes like this. I'm looking, I know I
3306.02s: want to be long in game stuff. I want to put a long trade on it. Okay. So I already have that idea.
3311.22s: The hypothesis is there. However, the process that I was showing you in terms of building this,
3319.22s: this is the hypothesis. So I have kind of that first stage of I want to be long this product. Okay,
3326.90s: that's like the very high level. I'm going to look more closely at this thing. This is now actually
3332.02s: building the hypothesis. Where do I think it's going to go? What's the probability of it going there
3336.90s: in what time frame? It's why don't you start getting specific about what you're doing. So that's
3342.50s: what's happening in the second step. Third step is based on what I find in the second step. I'm
3351.46s: fitting a strategy that makes the most sense from my toolkit. The way that this works. And I
3358.34s: realize I just need to like make a copy of this trade checklist in here. It'd probably be easier.
3363.22s: But the way that this works is I go to this. Well, I mean, I'll actually go to this. I kind of
3369.94s: know this well enough by now. But this is my stable of strategies. This is essentially 90% of what I do.
3376.42s: If not more is just it's this one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. It's nine things
3386.18s: that is the overwhelming majority of what I do. So I'm going to go to this list and I'm going to
3394.02s: figure out what things fit the idea. What fits my thesis? So in this case, I want to be long
3403.14s: game stop. Okay. Am I expecting a big move or a little move depending on the answer to that?
3408.26s: That will narrow down what kinds of things that I would want to trade. So this the step I'm
3415.78s: outlining now is going through your stable of strategies and fitting what fits your idea. That's
3422.90s: the third step. So first step, we're making sure that the product is suitable.
3428.02s: Making sure that there's nothing coming down the tracks that we don't know about earnings,
3431.46s: stuff like that. Second step, we're quantifying and getting specific about our hypothesis. Third
3437.62s: step is fitting the correct strategy. The fourth step is finalizing the P&L management plan.
3444.90s: So in this case, once we get through the hypothesis, we know it's going to go out. We know the
3449.14s: probability of it going there. We know the expected return on the trade. This is where I am setting
3456.18s: specifically how I'm going to execute the steps. Am I going to set an alert that is just above where
3463.54s: my stop is so that I can exit it? Am I going to set a stop order? I did that today in T-Tribal
3469.86s: Qs because I nibbled a little bit yesterday at a really tight stop on the trade because I didn't
3474.42s: trust it here. I'm getting in what I was considering to be really, really early. So I wanted to take
3479.86s: some of the trade down if it continued to experience a bit of a down move. So this is where I'm getting
3485.70s: into the specific details of how am I going to execute the P&L management, which today I was
3492.10s: stopped out, like almost right after the opening because I said it really, really, really tight
3498.74s: on this, on the close from yesterday. So that's that step. And then the last step, this is where I am
3507.38s: going to go over the whole trade to make sure that it's correct. Now I have to be honest with you,
3512.90s: I don't do this anymore. Like I really don't. This isn't something that's part of my review
3517.46s: process anymore. I spend so little time doing this. I think it's because I have a lot of confidence
3524.90s: in my execution at this point. But I think in the beginning, going through this is important to
3530.90s: make sure that you're not trying to put on a certain trade. And then you're putting on a
3537.38s: completely different thing because you fat fingered it and put on the wrong thing. That's
3540.98s: that's a bad scenario. We want to avoid those. Essentially, it all costs. Those are terrible,
3546.74s: terrible positions to have on. That unnecessarily nuke the return potential. So that's that.
3559.46s: Now the very last thing from the pre-trade checklist is to input whatever it is into your trade
3569.30s: log. So for this, I would need to outline the strategy. In this case, it was a ratio called
3575.54s: diagonal. I actually think I'm going to rotate back in this to just using shares as compared to
3580.82s: the options because the options are a little too liquid. I was noticing. So I like the leverage of
3586.10s: the options. I'm not fully convinced yet on T-Triple Q's if I'm going to stick with the coverage
3590.90s: stringlet or options. But I'm going back and forth because in back testing, I have an idea of how
3598.98s: they both perform and I like them both fine. But the management of the strategy is about the same.
3604.66s: It's mostly about the liquidity of the options. They're not terrible, but they're not good.
3609.70s: So it creates a little bit of a problem when I'm trying to navigate positions like this.
3615.38s: You can look at this. It's a $65 product, this strike, for example. And it's bid 1320 offered 1450.
3623.94s: It's just too wide. So because of that, I'm slowly getting pushed. But then you'll find more
3633.78s: liquid strikes like this. So the 70s that are 20 set. So anyways, a little bit of background
3641.38s: on the product. But the less component of the pre-trade is to track the requisite elements of the
3649.54s: position after we launch it. So let me take a pause there on the generalized pre-trade checklist.
3658.90s: And see if there's any questions. Now for those that are in the Patreon, there's the Patreon
3664.02s: shop that you guys have access to. I have templates for most of this stuff in there for you. I actually
3668.34s: need to update this one for you guys. But you can get an idea there. But for everybody else, literally,
3673.06s: you can just go through the stuff I was just showing you. And you can mirror your own from there.
3679.14s: Alfonso says don't need RK and is use options buys. That's too funny. GME is closed above $30
3691.46s: only six times since 22. All of them after his May 13th reappearance on X.
3698.50s: Oh, I see. Roaring Titty was saying we shouldn't have to need Kitty. Yeah, yeah, I agree with you.
3703.14s: Now with something like GameStop specifically, he is a big part of it. Like there's no doubt
3708.26s: that he is a massive player in the movement of the product. But like as a trader in general,
3714.82s: I couldn't agree with you more. You don't need anybody. That is literally the beauty of being a
3719.70s: trader is even if you're a business owner, you need things because you need to have people that
3726.82s: help you or if it's just you to like build whatever it is you sell. And then you need customers
3732.34s: to then sell to like you need things in trading. You literally need nothing other than access
3740.42s: to markets. Everything else is completely wrapped up in its own thing. You do not have to talk
3746.74s: to anybody. You need nothing. So trading is one of the really cool things where it's like it is
3752.74s: genuinely, genuinely a solo endeavor. Do you participate with other people? But it is a very,
3761.86s: very solo endeavor. That's the cool part about it.
3766.82s: Matt says I bought a couple GME in the money 20s for September. With the recent
3774.34s: Susclose, should I be concerned? Let's take a look at that in a second. Yeah, I'll happily take a
3779.30s: look at that. Let me finish the AR section of this. And then because the AR section is pretty short
3787.38s: and then we can take a look at that. I'm happy to. So this is essentially what I would wrap up
3795.78s: with for the AR process. It doesn't have to be long. It can be whatever you need it to be in the
3801.62s: beginning. As you're going through and thinking about creating a trade checklist and like in AR
3807.70s: process, the first thing that I would ultra mega highly recommend to you guys is that you
3818.18s: make it something that you will follow. It is so unbelievably worthless to build something that
3826.74s: might track every detail or data point you could ever possibly need in your entire life.
3831.94s: It is entirely, entirely worthless if you don't use it. So I cannot recommend enough
3839.22s: that you pick things that make sense for you. This first step is to simply track what happened.
3845.06s: This second step is to look at what happened in the context of the entire strategy system that you run.
3853.06s: So for example, if I'm trading the ratio call diagonal in T triple Q's and I get stopped out today,
3864.74s: I will then not only track the details on that for the individual trade, but I will look at the
3871.62s: performance of the strategy as a whole. I will look at the performance of my interactions with
3878.50s: the individual product. So those kinds of things give me a ton of information about what I'm doing
3887.30s: and it helps me optimize the approach that I'm taking. So that's what that is. And I'm going to let my
3894.42s: dog out really quick. I will be, be our B.
3898.02s: All right, King. We are back in action.
3921.86s: He is just ran into his bed and he's now in like this little tiny, curled puff ball. He's
3929.70s: actually really hilarious when he lays down because he like hugs his back legs with his front arms.
3937.06s: It's a, I mean, he's the most flexible thing I think I've ever seen in my life. It's actually very,
3940.90s: very impressive. So that's essentially what I'm tracking in the second step though is I'm feeding it
3948.58s: back into the strategy. I'm making sure the strategy did what it was supposed to do. I'm making
3952.98s: sure that there's no new data points that I need to take into consideration when I'm running that
3956.82s: strategy in the future. All of those kinds of things. And then the last thing is I'm bubbling it up
3961.62s: one more level to the entire portfolio is my portfolio behaving as it should did this trade fit
3968.98s: and operate within the portfolio as it was supposed to those kinds of things. Now,
3976.34s: notice how I don't do this like what was your emotional fucking feelings when you played like
3982.98s: personally, I don't care about that because I am a entirely grown man and I'm going to manage
3993.06s: my emotions as such. Now that's not to belittle other people that feel like they might need to do
4000.02s: that. If you feel like you need to do that and to track it, then do that. But I would also let you
4005.62s: know that if you feel like you need to do that, you probably have some much bigger problems coming
4012.50s: down the pike with your trading to be completely honest. If you're so emotional as a human being
4017.70s: that you have to track and log your emotions when you're placing trades to not have problems,
4024.18s: like how do you even fucking manage that is what it comes down to. Like to me,
4029.94s: that is such a difficult, difficult way to try to operate with markets. So if that is you,
4036.66s: do what you have to do. But what I'm highlighting is if that is something that needs to be
4041.22s: baked into your process, it would be somewhere up here. And I know that that's really common for
4045.22s: like day traders like right, your emotional well-being or whatever the fuck like I don't know to
4050.90s: me. It's just like be a grown adult and behave like one. And it's okay. If you know that you're
4056.26s: having a terrible day like we all have, I'm not saying I'm emotionless. I have them too.
4060.50s: But if I know if I'm having a terrible day, I'm just not I'm not going to do things in the market
4065.70s: that I don't have to. So yeah, Rointit, he says you get therapy for the reasons you screw up your trade.
4073.06s: Yeah, yeah, exactly. That's actually funny. The I have a dude that I bring on the channel once in a
4079.70s: while that I think is really, really cool. And he does like the cognitive side of trading.
4086.98s: It's very, very fun to interact with him. But I definitely notice a really significant departure
4094.74s: in the way that I think about markets and the way that I think about trading. But I did an
4099.62s: exercise with him on the last podcast I did with him. His name is Richard Freason. He's a great dude.
4104.98s: And the funny thing about that interaction though is that like the exercise he had me do was so
4110.18s: uncomfortable. I hated it. But I wanted to play ball, right? Like that's the whole point is to try
4116.18s: and keep an open mind and try to do things. And there was cool elements of it. I'm always
4122.42s: willing to try things and I'll try to focus on the the specific components. Yeah, truck complaints
4128.02s: as Eric's inner bitch coming out on stream. That's exactly it. That was exactly it.
4131.54s: Fuck, I hated that. But it yeah, the thing is I try to show you guys the different ways to do things.
4141.54s: And I'm willing to try things. But yeah, I mean, it's not like I would go super far down that path.
4151.46s: Yeah, that's kind of what it blows down to I suppose.
4155.38s: Day swag, which if you guys didn't know, the only way to pronounce that is day swag. Don't
4162.66s: don't mess that up. Don't disrespect us out here by calling them like disswag. Like you would
4168.02s: think it's day swag. You guys got to put a little respect on his name. He says as a social worker
4173.94s: and therapist, I love this. Yeah. Oh God, I would I feel like I would be a therapist worse nightmare
4179.62s: at the, be honest. I just can't imagine that it would be a fun conversation with me.
4185.46s: And I mean, I wouldn't blame them.
4188.74s: Cool. All right, let's get over to your questions now. We have, I mean, really, we have a
4193.06s: while left if you guys want. There was a couple other things I wanted to show you guys,
4196.42s: not from a pre post trade checklist. So actually, let me wrap that section up.
4200.66s: Are there any questions on this idea of a pre-trade or trade a our process?
4206.50s: Does what we reviewed generally make sense? And are there any components of it that you want to
4213.22s: discuss further? I have to imagine it's probably like the most boring part of learning about
4221.38s: trading and learning about options, but I'm not here necessarily to entertain you guys, although
4227.06s: I like to have fun. I'm here to share the the way to do this, at least as far as I see it,
4231.94s: and that is part of it. So, gotta share it even though that's not exactly gonna, that's not
4237.78s: gonna get the people jazzed up that we do know. Cool. All right, so it seems like there's no
4242.82s: questions there, which is fantastic. Here we go. Elon Song says, sometimes do a live trade and
4252.82s: walk through it in detail. I suppose I could do that.
4257.22s: Yeah, I suppose I could do that. Like I could record myself placing a trade and share that.
4267.06s: Yeah, I would give that. That's a thing.
4272.50s: Chewie says, do you write in paper? No, I do not. I use a giant Google Doc. So it used to be
4281.30s: a Word Doc, but then I moved into a Google Doc so that I have a little bit more room to move.
4294.10s: So this is what it looks like. The document is massive. You can see it like right now, it's
4300.58s: over 400 pages. This is essentially where I do it. This is essentially where I track almost all
4310.90s: of this stuff, but this is where I track a ton of stuff. But yeah, it's in a Word Doc like that.
4317.94s: Rointitty says you could do it live with us with paper trade. Yeah, I would be completely down.
4322.66s: I'm happy to do that. Rointitty, you know, I can't say no to Rointitty. It's impossible. So
4329.54s: Root of Vegas says you could publish it as a book. Yeah, but it would be like
4332.98s: Marcus Arraileus' Meditations. Most people would read that and be like, what the fuck is this?
4338.34s: Because it's all written for me. It's not really written for other people to consume. So it would be,
4343.78s: I imagine a nightmare to attempt to read for the normal reader.
4349.46s: But yeah, Rointitty, if you guys want to do that now, I'm happy to. It'll take me a minute if
4353.94s: I'm going to do it in detail, which again, I'm happy to do that. If you guys want to pivot to that
4358.74s: now, or we can take a look at any other questions you have, I think somebody is pointing me up to
4365.46s: the top. Who was that? Let me see. Kirby says, don't forget Matt's calls before the next section.
4372.66s: Yeah, where was that? Let me find them. Here it is. Oh, yeah, thank you. Thank you so much for
4378.50s: the reminder. Matt says, I bought a couple of GMME in the money. 20 calls for September. Yeah,
4386.02s: let's take a look at these bad boys. So September and it's the 20s. Okay. Got them right here.
4393.54s: And it says, one for September, one for October. Okay. So we have another one out here. And it
4400.18s: looks like the 20s at both, which is here. Okay. With recent sus clothes, should I be concerned?
4410.18s: And there are new subscribers. Hey, shout out to you. Thanks for subscribing.
4412.66s: That you just moved us one step closer to that 25k. So thank you very much. It takes a village.
4419.14s: And then we get there. So thank you. So I wouldn't be concerned with the quote unquote sus clothes.
4426.02s: I would be concerned with the price behavior. If you want this to go up, it's not going up.
4432.02s: So from my perspective, looking at your question, I would turn it back onto you. And I would say,
4439.14s: where is your predefined profit and loss point? That is the very first step in this. Because whether or
4449.62s: not I think you're in trouble really doesn't matter. Like it genuinely doesn't matter at all.
4454.02s: What matters here is what you think about your own position. And you're approached to managing
4460.82s: your own position. That's what I think at least. Because when I look at that, there's a reason why
4467.30s: I exited my shit here. Right. So that gives you where where I'm at in terms of what I would be doing
4474.10s: with positions. But the difference also is that like I'm a trader. My entire job as a trader
4483.46s: is to find things that are moving the way that I want them to and then to interact with them.
4493.62s: That's what I typically think. So I don't see any follow-ups from him just in terms of the
4502.58s: PNL. That would be the question I have for you though. Matt, if you want to talk about your trade
4506.42s: more, I'm happy to. But I would need to know two more things. I would need to know when you got
4511.46s: into the trade and then what you're predefined profit and loss management protocols are. That's
4518.34s: what I would need to see. Model Blunders alter. What says how far do you go back in your trading
4526.74s: log when just are reviewing how strategies are performing? That's a great question. So I have it all
4532.50s: built out into essentially data infrastructure at this point. So the way that I like I have data
4540.98s: that goes back probably like usable data that goes back probably 14 years, something like that.
4549.22s: I didn't have great logs for like the first four-ish years of what I was doing. So I have data that
4556.10s: goes back that far. And then it's almost like applying moving averages. Like I like to have the entire
4561.46s: population of data available, but I often segment it. So I would I'm much more interested in how things
4568.02s: are doing recently and and stuff like that. That's the answer to that.
4574.26s: Mark Khan says, what's your stop loss percentage? What does this have to do with?
4582.66s: Mark, could you clarify just the origin of the question?
4588.02s: Zach says I got 25 and 30 in October was up nicely but held. Yep, that's the problem.
4594.10s: Especially with the 30s being out of the money out here is just dangerous.
4600.66s: Now the good part is and hats off to you for going far enough out in time. That was actually a
4606.90s: highly educated move. Did you know to do that or did you live did you learn that on the channel here
4613.46s: at a curiosity? Oh, who is this trade by the way? Where was this? Zach, Zach, did you did you go out?
4624.50s: Would you typically go out in October or I learned that from you? Okay, awesome. Well,
4630.18s: one that's one Pat myself on the back, but two, I'm actually really stoked that you did that
4635.30s: because here's the deal. Take a look at your theta. It's three cents. So you're still losing a
4641.78s: large percentage of this without a doubt. But if you compare that to the other people,
4647.94s: what delta are you at? You're at a 50 delta. Compare that to the people here at a 51 delta
4653.86s: and their options are worth let's call it 270. They're losing six cents a day. They're losing a
4661.94s: massive, massive amount of the total value of these options on a daily basis. So they are in the
4670.26s: definition of swimming upstream hardcore, hard for. So I'm actually really, really stoked that
4680.26s: you went out that far. Now, even in your scenario, though, I would like, yeah, I think holding
4689.06s: after this day was a mistake. Personally, while going a swag is out here again,
4695.06s: hitting up the Jamaicans is good. So yeah, that's the thought on that. Obviously, happy to go
4702.42s: further into in the detail. I'm going to get back. All right. Alfonso says in the likely IV
4716.90s: Crush for Max calls September is historically the worst month for stocks in general. I don't know
4723.38s: about the seasonality there. And the seasonality also is slightly dependent. So I wouldn't make big trade
4730.02s: decisions off of seasonality like that personally, because it's not, it's really not,
4737.78s: it's not the most efficacious thing. But it's, it is something to be aware of, I suppose. I don't,
4746.10s: I don't hate being aware of that, but I wouldn't make that a big deal personally. At least the way I
4751.94s: think about it. The next question I see is from Paul. And Paul has a very hypothetical question
4763.30s: here. And Paul's hypothetical is also we have 68 people on the stream. So first off, shout out to
4769.86s: you guys. Second of all, if you guys can invite one more person and no more than that, that would be
4776.66s: the most magical thing. Really, if we could just hover at the magical number for a while,
4781.86s: that I think would make my night. So we might have to vote people off the island if it starts
4787.06s: rising above that. But I mean, we just need to get one more human being in here. I feel like
4791.78s: somebody has a friend that they could just open up their phone and just put it down even if
4796.50s: they're not watching. Oh, damn it. We just lost three. We moved away from the magical number. That's
4801.06s: the worst. You guys got me excited and then ripped it away from me. Unbelievable.
4810.10s: Well, let's go back to Paul's very hypothetical. Paul says, Jimmy leaps from to the April low,
4820.34s: to May 80 run. I'm curious if you sold a call. What that would look like.
4829.30s: I have to read your question again from the April low. Okay, so that's like here ish.
4837.54s: 22 April. And then we held those leaps to 80. We didn't get to 80. So I don't know when this was.
4848.42s: And then. So this looks like the scenario is we bought leaps here, held them through this.
4862.34s: And then now we're looking to sell calls. Am I reading that correctly?
4868.02s: Emory says 80 happened after I was okay, got it. I see. I got it. Let me see real quick.
4876.42s: There's a there's a set in here for good old after hours. That's not it. Where was it?
4890.74s: It's somewhere in here. Oh, no, no. Yeah, man.
4906.10s: Is it in here? Here we go.
4914.18s: Hmm. That's interesting. So I just asked it to show me the extended hours.
4924.98s: And I don't see that move here. Kind of annoying, isn't it?
4930.58s: I wonder what's up with that. Anyways, back to Paul's question.
4941.38s: So Paul, help me understand quickly. If are you looking in the proverbial position, is your friend
4951.38s: looking to sell a call now? Is that the question?
4956.50s: And.
4957.38s: Roingtony says reduce the time frame. Let's try. Do like this. I see. Do we have to go back?
4968.18s: What time?
4971.22s: Um, I'll fart down. Do I have to go? So it has to be like a daily time frame. So we have to look at,
4978.50s: when was this May 14th?
4981.78s: I just want to see it on here. May 14th. And then let's do.
4993.46s: We don't need that. There we go. Like four hours maybe. Let there it goes.
4998.42s: I see it now.
4999.14s: Now,
5000.50s: the Zah. Check that out. Great news.
5006.10s: Great news for us. Thank you. My OCD is satiated. So thank you guys very much.
5017.70s: Uh, Paul, you've, you've, Paul has left the chat. Paul, where'd you go?
5023.70s: Oh, there's Paul. Welcome back, Paul. I thought you, I thought you dumped on me.
5031.06s: So what, what are we trying to do here with this position?
5034.90s: From my understanding, we have leaps from here that we just diamond handed through this
5041.22s: until they're worth nothing. A quick admin note, not that this matters, but it's just so that
5047.38s: the pedantic Reddit police don't get on you guys. When you're referring to leaps, it's leaps.
5056.10s: So it's not like a, a leap or anything. Yeah, it's le ap a le ap s.
5062.74s: And it stands, it's an acronym. It stands for something. Paul says no selling at that peak.
5069.22s: What would the profit be? I see. Okay. Oh, and you're talking about selling a call. You
5074.26s: would get murdered. Or do you mean buying a call?
5082.58s: I have to go back up to Paul's questioning. And the fuck is it?
5086.50s: Jamie leaps. I'm curious if you sold a call. I see what you mean. Okay. Man, that was a trick
5092.82s: you want to get to. So here's what we're trying to do. You're saying in a hypothetical scenario,
5097.38s: if you had gotten leaps at a on this day and you sold them, you top ticked them, you would have
5106.02s: to do it during the normal market hours. So you wouldn't get to 80. We can see what the option
5113.70s: would have been worth. I am now following you. Yeah, we could take a look at that. We got through
5118.18s: it together. It's all right. So let's go back. One was the low. This was on the 16th of April.
5124.10s: April 16th. And I'm going to structure the trade that I would. So I'm not going to ask you a
5133.54s: bunch of insular questions about like how far out what delta's you would use? Like I'm just going
5138.58s: to set it up. How I would set it up. And I personally wouldn't use leaps in this case. I would
5147.62s: I've been trading typically 90 DTE and in. So I'd probably go at most out to 18 October to split
5154.82s: the difference with you. And then I'm going to target something around a 70 75 delta is what I want.
5162.42s: These are a liquid. I don't like that. They're a dollar 10 wide. These are more liquid. I don't like
5167.86s: that more. So these are a dollar 10. So that's about what you're going to get here is what it looks
5173.62s: like. Those are a dollar 15. So yeah, this is this is what it is. And then. So let's say you get in
5179.46s: for these at 340. Let's say that we're talking about a proverbial. Let's say that the trade
5188.90s: allocation is going to get. I'm going to think on like a standard account size using like maybe
5197.22s: like a hundred or a hundred or a hundred fifty thousand dollar account. Let's say that the total
5200.66s: risk on the trade is maybe eight percent. So like a eight thousand dollar loss or something like
5205.94s: that. So where do we think this thing can go to the downside? We have to get rid of this other one.
5217.86s: So we have to pick a downside move to figure out like where the because it's like literally
5222.98s: hitting lows. Go off further. I have to go off further still. This is crazy. Okay, so that's
5232.26s: like lows lows, huh? That's like is low as this baby got. There it is. He's got to go back super far.
5239.78s: So I would pick something like. At or below this.
5253.70s: Oh, that. Let's see what that gets us.
5264.66s: 853. So the way I look at something like this with such a tight stop. I might give it a little bit
5272.10s: more room. Oh, no, it's not. Okay, yeah. So we're at 995. So we have some room to move here. This
5277.70s: is good. This is much better. So let's say at 853. You lose $170. We're willing to lose up to like
5286.74s: 8 grand. So we need to get like maybe 60. No, like 50 of these. Yeah, that's about right. 850,
5296.98s: 8500. That's a little too much. So maybe take it down to like 45.
5300.42s: 850. It takes us 76 hundred. That's pretty good. So yeah, so you would get these for 340. And then
5310.42s: when was the peak of that? Was it May 14th? I said.
5319.14s: Believe it's something like this.
5320.34s: And then I will be right back again. I need to get a refill on salt or water. You guys know how it goes.
5380.82s: All right. We are back in action. We are reloaded ready to rock and roll.
5398.50s: Except we have a new salt or water. We went with coconut pineapple, which I feel like coconut
5404.34s: pineapple is pretty good. It's still not my favorite. I like the watermelon one much more if I'm
5408.74s: being honest, but it's still good. Got to mix it up. I really like those spin drips, but I can
5414.90s: drink too many of them. So we have to swap it out. All right. So day swag is trying to figure out
5423.38s: what Paul is asking. He's just trying to see what these options can be worth. If you get a big
5426.82s: move in your favor. That's pretty much it. And it would be worth $220,400. That's the answer to your
5435.86s: question. So in this case, and this is not necessarily at the peak, it looks like the peak already
5450.66s: kind of happened. No, it's a, yeah, it's sort of been like right at the open. I don't even know if
5455.06s: I can get that close to the open on this. Let's see. So yeah, in this case, you would have laid out
5465.78s: let's do the math. It would be $340 times 45. So you would have laid out $15,300. And then you
5474.98s: would have made $220,000. $220,410. Yeah. So that is, that's where you're at.
5496.10s: Joey says it's a lot of unlikely. Yeah. I mean, the probability of people bottom-ticking and
5503.06s: top-ticking it like that, it's so unbelievably low. Like a pock elliptically low is even how I
5510.58s: would frame it. But I mean, to Paul's point, like it is cool to see what these could do, right?
5517.30s: And to get to get a sense of how they might behave or something like that. So yeah, I like the idea
5524.98s: here. All right, let's get back up. There was several other questions that I want to hit.
5533.94s: And like I said, I'm not in a rush tonight. So I'm happy to run through as much as you guys want.
5541.78s: Okay. Who cares says where did you get the data? I assume who cares that you're referring to
5549.54s: the data for the trade log and the trade log data, the strategy data is my own from my own trades.
5555.94s: And then the broader data that I use to analyze and back test stuff is from SIBO. I buy it from
5561.78s: there. The next question I see here is from I Boy. And they're saying, what makes you enter a trade?
5568.58s: Do you try to scalp based on short-term sentiment? Or do you build positions and companies that
5572.98s: you believe in the long-term value? Not so much either of those, to be honest. My approach to
5578.74s: trading is much less loyal, I would say. So what I mean by that is I have, again, this is why I built
5587.94s: this thing because it is very useful for summarizing lots of stuff. So this is essentially what I do
5596.42s: in options from my perspective is I trade directionally and I use options for leverage and I trade
5605.94s: volatility. I trade both forms of structural alpha and I trade discretionary as well. So I would
5616.42s: consider that more of a soft edge. So really what makes me enter a trade is generated from one of
5624.02s: two places. Either when I'm looking at the portfolio, I will notice one of two things.
5631.22s: The portfolio as a whole, it might need a specific kind of risk, meaning if I have a bunch of long
5639.46s: deltas, I might need short deltas or if I have a bunch of short deltas, I might need long deltas.
5643.94s: That kind of thing. That will then send me down a path in terms of what kind of trade I'm going
5648.58s: to put on. Or I can identify an opportunity and then I can look to trade the opportunity. So
5656.26s: really basing on both of those scenarios is how I end up placing a trade. But it's much less of
5666.10s: I scalp or I trade X, Y or Z. I trade a lot of different things is the short answer. If you want
5672.66s: to dive into any more specifics there, I boy, as you know, I am absolutely happy to dive more
5681.54s: into detail. But that's the kind of the summary. Mark Khan says, if your options are shitting
5688.58s: the bed and don't look good for the future, at what point do you cut your loss? You decide that
5692.58s: before you enter the trade without a doubt. Again, that's why it's part of the trade checklist
5698.42s: and it's why it's part of what I was showing you guys here. And this is part of what you will
5704.66s: learn tomorrow in that video is all of this should be defined ahead of time. Like what one of the
5710.74s: funny things about trading is that if you are a good trader, like a legitimately good trader,
5715.86s: the actual act of trading is fucking easy. And I don't mean that in terms of hyperbole. Like it is
5723.38s: easy because all of the work is done before you enter the trade. The trade for easy part. You just
5730.26s: do all of the shit that you plan to do. So in this case, the easy answer to that specific question
5738.66s: mark is you got it, you have to define that before you enter the trade. There's just no exception
5744.90s: to that. If you're not defining it before you enter the trade, you have a massive problem
5750.50s: that is going to rear its head sooner or later, where traders suffer from things like the disposition
5758.74s: effect, where we don't want to close losing trades because then it realizes a loss and that's a
5763.70s: painful process. So is annoying as an answer of that that that is that is the day.
5776.50s: Gravitaris says, how do you determine whether to take profit or roll to upgrade to lower strike
5782.74s: price? That's easy. One, that's also generally part of my predetermined plan. But two, it depends on my
5792.98s: my sentiment towards the position. So gravitarist for your question specifically, if you give me an
5800.42s: example, I can work through it with you. And then we can work through, yeah, we can work through
5807.38s: it together. And then just so you guys know, if you guys are dropping in new stuff to the chat,
5811.22s: I am not seeing it because I'm way up at the top trying to catch up on these. Paul says, can you put
5816.58s: alerts on an options value? Absolutely. You can put alerts on the options value. And you can also
5824.10s: like place orders that are predicated on the options value, or you can create calculators
5831.06s: essentially that do it for you, which is another really useful tool. So I have this here. I'll show
5838.98s: it with you guys this thing. So kind of from the same Excel book, you can do something like this.
5854.02s: And you can do more, right? Like this was actually just specifically to show people the process
5859.38s: of calculating what an option will be worth at specific stop points with a stock. But
5869.46s: yeah, you can essentially see exactly what the option will be worth that if you want to rest orders
5874.26s: or whatever. Charlie C2 says, been writing cash-secured puts and covered calls on GME, been making bank.
5883.94s: Yeah, the problem is sooner or later, you're probably not going to like what happens.
5890.10s: That's typically what happens with people that trade those. So yeah, I'm glad it's been working
5895.46s: for you. That makes me very, very happy. But I would be very cautious with that strategy at the same.
5902.10s: Kirby says, I think Mark was asking to you normally set trades at a standard stop loss,
5906.82s: or do you have a max of 20 or something? Okay, Kirby, the answer to that is it's not
5914.26s: it's not set standard across the board, but it is adjustable based on the strategy and what the
5920.02s: portfolio needs. That's the way to think about that. All right. Apollo says, do you apply just to
5933.38s: individual trades or strategies campaigns as well? Could you clarify what we were talking about
5939.06s: at that point? I don't remember. Ahmed says, do you use gamma to decide the regime of the market?
5945.46s: Yeah, I don't really use it to decide necessarily the regime, but I absolutely pay attention
5949.94s: what net gamma is. Because if you know the gamma exposure of the market, you can have a pretty good
5957.46s: inference of what hedging behavior will have on the behavior of the product that you're trading
5964.10s: specifically. So yeah, I definitely pay attention to net gamma. It's kind of not like a massively
5970.42s: important component, but it is still something that is important to monitor, I think.
5977.86s: Reese says, what would you consider a relatively safe play for picking options on GME that
5985.86s: wrecks out that expires a few months? Trying to learn from my mistakes today.
5993.06s: Well, I think the first thing is again, defining what you think you want to happen.
6000.90s: And then from there, I would build something that makes sense based on your disposition. So for
6008.02s: example, if I'm looking at GameStop and I want to be generally long GameStop, I don't know when
6014.50s: it's going to explode because nobody does. I don't know if it's going to explode again, but it
6018.42s: probably will. So I want exposure to it, but I don't know how far out to go. Well, you have a
6023.94s: couple of things. One, the easiest solution in the scenario, honestly, is shares. And it saves you
6029.30s: a lot of problems. Now, if you want to use options for the leverage or for whatever other reason,
6036.10s: that's totally cool. And if doing that, I essentially would expect to manage the options as if
6046.50s: it were stock, because again, I'm a trader. I'm not going to just hold this thing in general for
6053.94s: most of the like for the base position. I caveat it, right? Because like I said, I have shares,
6059.78s: but that's that's that's me being an emotional human being. That's not me being a practical
6066.10s: trader. That's actually one of the cool parts about trading is sometimes you can do silly things
6069.62s: like that. Not saying that holding shares is silly. But I'm saying what I'm doing with it is
6073.94s: silly is I'm essentially just holding the shares literally just to participate with you guys.
6080.58s: I think I've given you guys this example already, but to reiterate it, I have shares of AMC
6085.62s: that I bought years ago literally from a bet that I made with somebody on a YouTube livestream
6091.70s: that I told them that I had shares and they're like, oh, when are you going to sell them? And I
6095.78s: think I made a joke saying that like I would never sell them. So I literally I'm going to just have
6100.42s: those shares of AMC in my account until I fucking die because I made a random bet with somebody
6105.54s: on a YouTube live. So not everything is completely pragmatic. And I'm differentiating that, right?
6112.10s: Because the way that I'm trading this to make money is one thing. The shares that I'm holding
6116.34s: is another thing that's literally just like a participation component. Okay. So that whole thing
6123.06s: aside is when I look at this, I would decide where I would want to get out if it breaks below.
6130.98s: Like this is probably realistically where I would be looking. Like if there's some sort of dump
6136.90s: below 18 to I don't think I would want to hold it below that if I were to enter a trade.
6143.54s: Now you can see that I already have a stop that's higher than that. And that's because I would
6148.50s: reevaluate and adjust my position if it starts to fall below this level because things start to
6154.10s: material change in terms of how it fits into the portfolio. So all of that sums up to how I think
6163.22s: about the position itself. And I would say, okay, maybe I have an initial stop here at 2083.
6173.38s: And then maybe I have a hard stop at 18 to something like that. So then if that's the position,
6178.50s: I would then personally, depending on the timeframe, I wouldn't go out 300 days. And it's just
6185.06s: because these are going to be not really liquid. And if you get a big move in your favor, which
6190.58s: would be very cool, you're still going to take a massive haircut on the position just in terms
6197.46s: of liquidity. So I wouldn't want to be that far out. I would probably want to be something like 90 days
6202.34s: out no more than that. And it's literally for the sake of liquidity. So then I would find where I
6208.26s: can find some liquid options. I would expect the 20s. These are probably the most liquid ones. I
6214.66s: know they don't see it, right? I know these are right now. But if the market was open, I would
6219.54s: surmise that it would be these 20s. That would be tighter than the 15 spread here. So that's my guess,
6224.66s: is that would go somewhere like that. And that's essentially how I would think about
6230.98s: isolating where I would want to be. And then I would go through the sizing process, portfolio fit.
6236.34s: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all that stuff. So that's that.
6243.94s: All right, cool. I think I'm all caught up.
6249.70s: Perfect. All right, I'm just getting caught up on now the most recent chats.
6257.22s: Manscaped go. What a name. What a name. I love that.
6267.94s: Manscaped goat says, can you explain the MOC and balance trade? Yeah, could you elucidate or
6273.94s: I'm sorry, could you expand a little bit more on what specifically about that that you want to
6278.82s: talk about? I'm happy to. I just need to know exactly what direction you're trying to go.
6283.14s: Rory and Titi says, how can you be accurate that when the options price change dynamically?
6288.26s: If you're are you talking about I assume you're talking about this, the spreadsheet thing that I was
6293.38s: making in terms of like telling me what the value of an option is going to be at a certain point.
6297.62s: Is that correct? And if so, I can easily explain that.
6305.94s: But I want to make sure I'm looking at the right thing.
6308.98s: I'm looking at the right thing.
6310.50s: I'm looking at the right thing.
6311.70s: I'm looking at the right thing.
6314.66s: I'm looking at the right thing.
6316.02s: I'm looking at the right thing.
6322.42s: In the meantime, while I'm waiting for Rory and Titi for the Manscaped goat,
6326.42s: essentially he's asking about market on clothes and balances.
6331.62s: So it's kind of tricky, but a primary reason why you will see them is when people use market
6343.94s: on clothes orders. It's an order type.
6347.38s: So if I go on to on demand, the reason I'm going into on demand is so that I can pull up a trade
6354.66s: and not flash like my entire account details. Even though the one I'm using right now is my
6360.50s: pass through account. It still has like stuff that I don't need out there.
6364.90s: Well, this is kind of annoying. I thought maybe this would give us decent options.
6369.78s: Oh, I forgot. This is the weird day. Of course.
6372.74s: Let's pick another day. Let's just come not that far.
6380.82s: So
6384.42s: I'm just waiting for this. There it is.
6393.94s: So if we place an order, it doesn't matter which one.
6397.30s: There's different times and forces you can choose and there's complex order types.
6404.02s: So one of the order types you can choose is a market on clothes.
6409.86s: So essentially, if you want to use the closing price for the day for your execution,
6416.82s: that's what you would select. So those imbalances can happen with an influx of those.
6423.54s: They can happen for other reasons as well. But I think
6429.54s: I think the easiest way to think about it is because of just a flush of orders that don't have
6437.94s: sufficient counterparts. So that's what market on clothes is and that's where the imbalances result from.
6448.42s: Let me know if that, if you have any follow-ons for it.
6454.66s: Let me see. Kirby says he's an options trader. He's like a play. He keeps his options open.
6468.58s: Yeah, that's a good way to phrase it. That's kind of the idea.
6471.14s: I think that's the idea of being a trader in general is to just try to find opportunities.
6476.90s: That's the way to make money doing this.
6479.14s: Emoryam says, do you ever catch unicorns like these players that were buying one DTE on
6485.54s: Riven, AVGO crowd at the market clothes the day before their events? Sometimes. It's seldom the case,
6494.34s: but sometimes it's definitely not any sort of primary like profit mechanism that I try to pursue
6502.10s: because it's not consistent to any significant degree. So yeah, in general, probably less so,
6511.06s: but I mean, every once in a while, I'll catch them. A lot of the reasons why I catch them is when
6517.54s: they pop up on different scans or alerts. I actually, that reminds me, I need to build another
6522.34s: alert too. There's another alert I need to update for like sequential stock gaps.
6534.42s: Yeah. So sometimes like for something like crowd, this one popped up on my radar simply because of
6544.02s: this price behavior. So we had three consecutive gaps down that generally will pop up on a scan
6553.14s: that I have. And then what I like to do is sort them by the move from the starts of the gaps to
6559.94s: where it is now to look for severity. So it gives me an idea of like different things I can look for.
6564.98s: This is really interesting too, though, because I feel like this is kind of overdone, to be honest.
6570.58s: But this you can kind of pick up on something squirrely going on here pretty quickly, I think.
6578.98s: Gravitaris says, GME 25 short put a profit on Tuesday and wasn't sure if I should go for 20 call
6588.10s: further out. When you say SP, what does that mean to you, by the way? Because that's,
6594.34s: it's really confusing to use that terminology. I guess I should correct it now for your own good.
6599.22s: SP equals strike price. Yeah, okay. So from like typical nomenclature, that equals strike price.
6605.30s: This equals stock price. Nope, not that one. My bad. This one. Let me delete this other one. So I'm not
6610.26s: confusing people. So K equals strike S equals stock price in normal parlance. Now you'll find some
6619.46s: people my mentors actually one of the people that
6622.66s: switch those. He would use S for strike K for stock. But that's not normal. Normal use would be K
6636.26s: as strike S as stock. So yeah, anyways, back to your question. You had the 25 strike,
6646.90s: had a profit and wasn't sure if you should go for 20 calls out in further August. Are you
6653.54s: comparing the two, the two positions? I'm trying to understand the like what you're trying to
6660.42s: solve for there. Are you talking about if you should have closed the 25s to then move into the 20s?
6667.06s: I guess adding context to the role upgrade question. Oh, I see. Yeah. So I wouldn't even bother with
6676.98s: that to be honest. Like if you have a stock, if you have a position that did what you want and it's
6682.26s: defined, follow the plan for that position. And then if you like it still and you want to put on
6687.46s: another position, put another position on, but I wouldn't necessarily try to roll things on,
6692.90s: yeah, unnecessarily. It just kind of adds a layer of complexity that it probably doesn't have to be
6698.66s: there. Day swag says, I feel like the answer to my question is to keep them out of one-to-one ratio
6709.06s: to ensure that I'm not exposing myself to a ceiling. But I'm still new to understanding your
6714.58s: experience with them. Day swag, are you referring to the covered calls? Is that correct?
6722.42s: And if so, I'll show you the exact problem.
6732.74s: Let me know. Day swag, if you're referring to covered calls there. And then, yeah, obviously I can
6739.62s: answer for you. Man's scaped goat says, what it makes sense to play a strangle into earnings,
6746.58s: best way to play options into earnings or is playing Pied the best way. Pied is different.
6752.10s: So Pied is post earnings. Now leading into earnings, there's a force that typically yields
6760.26s: expanding volatility into the earnings release. So you can see that right here. Here's the earnings
6767.94s: day. The yellow lines here is volatility. So this shows you like about as clear as day,
6773.38s: too. This is a great example because the stock was going up. Normally, a stocks go up. Volatility
6779.14s: goes down, but it didn't. As the stock went up, volatility was going up because starting about two
6786.34s: weeks out, you will see volatility expanding into the earnings release. So that takes you to about
6792.90s: here. And you can see it, especially on the 30 day vol is when it started to slowly climb up and
6800.42s: out. So in this case, if I want to trade the volatility expansion and I don't have a directional
6806.26s: disposition for something like that, I would use even. Did I say without a directional disposition,
6816.90s: if I said without a directional disposition, I would use long straddles. If I have a directional
6824.10s: disposition, I would use long options of some sort, long single options. I don't use strangles as much
6831.14s: for the buildup. I typically use straddles and I try to gamma scalp around them.
6835.86s: So and then for a Pied for those that don't know, that stands for post earnings announcement
6847.14s: drift. And that's a really, really well known market force, by the way. It's highly defined and
6853.30s: it's highly observable. So you can play the post earnings announcement drift either to the upside
6859.46s: or to the downside, but it requires the stock to make specific moves after the earnings.
6866.18s: It has to have a significant enough of an earnings beat. And then it needs to have a specific
6872.66s: size gap that it makes. Let me grab the study for you guys right now.
6877.30s: So this is a fantastic, fantastic study for you guys to check out. And there's this one that
6896.50s: looks at the pre earnings announcement drift. There's a bunch of different studies. These are two of
6903.14s: them that I think are kind of topical here. So this one, it shows this is kind of the part to
6910.34s: highlight into. There's professional investors are looking at Pied. Academic evidence shows strategy
6916.34s: produces abnormal return of 2.6 to 9.37%. So it's kind of talking about the severity of it in what
6923.06s: it looks like. But there's very specific criteria that has to be met in order for post earnings
6930.50s: announcement drift to take place. I don't know if they go into that into the conclusion or let me
6938.10s: see real quick. No, no, here we go. I'm just trying to see if in here it quickly highlights what
6953.78s: needs to happen. It doesn't. So anyways, it's in here though, where it will show you
6967.46s: specifically what criteria have to be met. So it's typically like at least a 10% gap and then
6973.86s: a certain size beat on EPS, something like that. Let me see. Lee says, what's up Eric? What
6994.02s: brokers do you use pros and cons any favorites? Yeah, I use Schwab. I use thinkorswim primarily.
6999.78s: So that's the platform. And the broker is Schwab. I like them so far. I started with TD Ameritrade.
7008.98s: And I started with them out of pure luck. And then I've just stayed with them because I like them.
7012.98s: I've always been able to negotiate my rates with them. I have fair rates that are definitely
7017.78s: competitive for somebody that charges rates. I like the support that they provide the tools. So
7022.26s: I'm so forth. So yeah, I like them.
7026.34s: Yes, Schwab says I was referring to risk management to the coverage strangle and was wondering if
7031.22s: keeping a one to one ratio would help from that previous thing you said about you won't like
7036.66s: when that happens. So maybe when something like when someone else is talking about covered call,
7041.78s: I get we need ratios to survive.
7044.10s: In issue of cap ceiling. Yeah, exactly. So exactly. I avoid the one to one ratios on anything that
7054.42s: I want upside potential on, which is most trades. That's the trade off for placing the position
7060.82s: like when you're holding shares of something like GameStop, there's you have downside risk.
7067.06s: That's the penalty. That's the potential downside of holding the position. So the reward for
7073.46s: the downside that you're exposed to is upward price movement. If you cap that,
7080.50s: you've now taken away the reward for the risk that you're taking. So in this case, I would not
7090.42s: want a one to one ratio. In this case for something like this, let's say I would buy
7096.26s: 500 shares of GameStop, whatever it is. And then I might sell two maybe three calls against it,
7101.70s: probably closer to two for something like GameStop specifically, which is primarily a pretty aggressive
7107.78s: upside style trade. So yeah, that's the general thought there.
7114.66s: Emory, I'm says, how do we feel about net options pricing effect as a relatively new metric? How
7119.22s: do you incorporate it feels like feels interesting as options markets are increasingly
7124.50s: driving the underlying performance? Yeah, that's actually really interesting because I
7130.50s: fully agree with you to a degree. There's a lot of really, really great studies on like the tail wagging
7139.06s: the dog. I would argue that options markets still have an impact, but I don't, I haven't seen
7149.70s: enough research to lead me to believe yet that it's driving the stock price. I'm unsure about that.
7157.06s: Yeah. So at least that's like that's the general thought. Let me see if I can find a couple studies for you.
7175.94s: That's not it. This one I think is it. Yeah, this one.
7186.98s: So this is a study that I think is worth taking a look at.
7201.94s: And we can take a peek at it real quick before it pop off.
7205.70s: Not pop off in terms of like flipping out on somebody. We're not popping off like that,
7210.50s: but we're going to pop off the stream in a minute. And then if you're unaware,
7215.78s: I am doing a live stream tomorrow with Newton. So you should absolutely come hang out for that.
7224.18s: But where's the actual paper? I have to find the paper.
7236.18s: This isn't what I wanted. This is just showing us some of the materials. Where's the paper?
7245.38s: That's kind of annoying.
7260.66s: I'm seeing if I can find the base paper for you.
7266.50s: This is another good one. It's slightly different. It's more about price informativeness.
7280.34s: But.
7289.14s: This one. That's a good one.
7296.90s: And then I think this is the actual paper for that other one we were looking at.
7306.90s: This is it. There we go. Found it. So this is the full version of this paper.
7315.94s: Is this guy? So let's see.
7319.06s: This paper tests the prediction and finds statistically and economically significant
7325.46s: negative relationship between stock return volatility and net purchased option prices of
7331.06s: investors who are likely to head. Hence we provide the first evidence for substantial and
7336.26s: pervasive influence of option trading on stock prices. So these guys find specifically with
7343.62s: respect to hedging the positions. So I think that there is something to be said there. But again,
7349.46s: I think you have to ask the question of severity, which I'm not convinced that there's massive severity yet.
7359.38s: All right, you guys. I am wrapped up for today. Thanks for hanging out. Really, really fun
7366.26s: conversation. I love these. I am going to keep these up probably for a few more weeks and then
7372.34s: just kind of transfer the Friday sessions just into a standard beginner session as compared to
7377.46s: something that has like a set topic each time of some sort like the topics will become more random.
7383.14s: Right now I'm keeping the topic still in a general order that I think makes sense for people
7388.34s: that are learning options. So that's the goal. And we have the other thing I wanted to share with
7394.10s: you guys really fast before I pop off is what is this this one. I've updated this.
7402.42s: So I'm still building this out as you can tell. This was the original version of the syllabus.
7408.26s: This is kind of designed to be a list of videos that I think you should read or read. You should
7413.70s: watch been on a stream for too long if you're talking about reading videos. But that I think you
7418.82s: should watch in order. And then this is a more comprehensive list of subtopics that I believe
7429.62s: belong into a broader list of more topics. So this list is much much longer but this is kind
7437.54s: of designed to be a more holistic snapshot of essentially not knowing anything about investing
7445.70s: to the concept of creating a sustainable practice and spreading into other asset classes.
7450.82s: This spans essentially all of that. So if you didn't know updated version of that there.
7456.82s: Vino says do we have access? Yes. This is free for everybody. So this isn't behind the
7462.26s: Patreon or anything. This is for everybody. It's in I don't know if it's in most of the video
7468.34s: descriptions. Maybe it should be. I don't know if I've done that yet. But there's the link to it.
7474.82s: Everybody's welcome to check it out. Download it. Whatever you want. But that's available for everybody.
7480.42s: All right. You all being outlier. I see you this weekend.
