0.00s:  What's up, outliers? Happy Friday. I hope we all had a absolutely dope week. There's been
7.96s:  no shortage of kind of interesting things going on for us to talk about. But as you know,
14.24s:  tonight is options trading for beginners. So we have a pretty distinct agenda that I would
23.34s:  like to hit and work through with you all. I want to specifically focus this idea of a trade
30.66s:  checklist. And I specifically want to explore how we can think about kind of developing
38.74s:  a systematic process before we place a trade. However, I would love to start with some
46.60s:  broader Q&A or anything that we've covered so far that you have questions about. And
53.22s:  I am happy to talk about it. Looks like we have a couple questions from the beginning.
58.34s:  I'm going to hit those. But if you have anything that you want to hit in the beginning, throw
62.90s:  it in the chat. And we'll spend a little time upfront about Q&A. And then a little bit
69.58s:  later is when we'll dive into the specifics of building this trade checklist. How to think
75.02s:  about it. Those kinds of details. There are a lot of different things that we can do in order
82.18s:  to make something that's usable, but not a little too over the top. That's kind of a really
87.98s:  important step in my opinion. Because if things are too arduous for us to fill out, for example,
94.62s:  the probability of us actually adhering to that that checklist or whatever else that we're
100.06s:  referencing is very, very low. So that is the idea. I got to turn my air up because it is
107.74s:  warm in here. We got the air rocking and rolling now. I think we're in a good spot. So before
114.58s:  we get too far into the weeds though, you all know exactly how this goes. I'm going to say
119.58s:  hello to everybody. I love checking out who we got hanging out here on a Friday to talk
125.02s:  about some options trading. Let me move this chat over here so I can keep an eyeball on
129.94s:  all of you. And I see we got Shrej J, Ruta Bega, Joey Elon songs, Ian J, Timmy Pepper,
137.70s:  Roni always fun. This name always slows me down. Grab, fuck, I remember gravitaris. That's
146.34s:  it. gravitaris blizzy M Ram blizzy. That's a great name. I like that one. I don't know which
151.70s:  one is my favorite. I don't see roaring titty. That's normally my favorite. I have to be honest.
156.82s:  I do play favorites. Second favorite might be, oh, it's either Ruta Bega, Timmy Pepper,
164.02s:  Roni or blizzy. It's probably blizzy. Yeah. I think blizzy. I think you want it here,
167.70s:  at least for me in my world. That's a pretty good name. And we have a couple beverages to get us
175.94s:  through. I got my water, seltzer, watermelon. And then I have the mango orange. This is the good
184.02s:  spin drift. In my opinion. All right. Let us begin. So there was a question. It literally
195.78s:  disappeared. I don't know where it went. That's actually super annoying. Did it disappear for
201.78s:  you guys too? Or is it just me? Interesting. There was a, there was a question that somebody dumped
213.46s:  in that was sitting at the top. It was something about three rules or something like that. But it's
218.98s:  completely gone from my screen. If it's gone for you guys, maybe they pulled their question back
222.42s:  or whatever. But I do not see it at this point. Ruta Bega says, I saw the comment flashing
229.22s:  disappear. I wonder if it's something with like going, I don't know. Damn it. Well, I'm sorry.
233.86s:  Whoever dropped that question and that's kind of a bummer that it's gone. Feel free to drop it
237.14s:  back in. I was going to start with that. But since that's the case, let's pivot over and let's
243.30s:  get into the heart and soul. So let's talk about a trade checklist. When we think about this idea
249.14s:  of a trade checklist, why, why is this important to us? And I know it's kind of a boring topic.
254.50s:  It's not that fun. There's nothing really that quirky about it. It's not super engaging. However,
261.30s:  oh, M. Ram, you the man. Thank you. It says, what are a few rules to live by when trading options?
267.86s:  When you are determining your position, positioning into a trade, what are key indicators that you
273.30s:  look out for before entering? Thank you so much, M. Ram, for getting that comment back up.
278.02s:  Because I actually thought the question was really good. I felt bad that it had dropped off.
280.90s:  Thank you for saving it. Okay. That's a fantastic question. So let's talk about it. With this question
290.34s:  specifically, if I were to think about a handful of rules to live by when trading options,
297.46s:  the very first one is in my opinion, you need to focus on the profit mechanism first.
305.86s:  That's one of the most difficult parts with options. Because when we're trading options, we want
310.34s:  to start trading options very quickly. And I don't know if people fully understand how misguided
317.70s:  that is, in my opinion, the reason why it's so misguided is because options are simply products.
325.14s:  There are things we can trade. There are a type of security. If you don't have a good grasp
332.74s:  of profit mechanisms, options won't help you. They will not save you. They do not generate
340.66s:  some sort of inherent edge that you can tap into and take advantage of. It really is kind of
348.74s:  problematic actually. So in my opinion, that's probably one of the biggest initial steps to focus on
357.78s:  is to make sure that you actually identify profit mechanisms. So for those that are listening in,
366.66s:  what do you think that means? What is that? When I'm talking about profit mechanisms like this,
374.74s:  how do we do that? So if we think about the process of building a strategy, kind of trying to create
381.22s:  success and doing this long term, I talk about this idea of profit mechanisms all the time.
385.62s:  So what does that actually mean? How do we do that? There's really a handful of things that you
392.34s:  can make money from in the stock market. It's starting there. So for example, if I'm looking at
398.90s:  something like SMCI, there's actually a profit mechanism in this stock right here that's going sideways.
405.06s:  That's been range bound from 955 down to a low of 716, which 200 points is kind of big. But range
414.26s:  bound for the product itself, there's a way you can trade this. And for something like this,
420.90s:  I look more towards volatility because it absolutely has a volatility edge that is baked into it
427.78s:  in terms of variance risk premiums. So profit mechanism simply put is how does something make money?
437.70s:  Options is not a profit mechanism. So the first rule to live by when trading options is to focus
447.14s:  first on the profit mechanism. The second rule to live by when trading options is you cannot take
455.30s:  a haphazard approach to trading them. You have to go through the process of testing things to see not
463.06s:  only what works well in general, but also what works well for you, the trader. You have the last
471.22s:  say in terms of what makes sense for you. What doesn't make sense for you? That matters a lot.
476.50s:  And I actually just finished a podcast episode with humble trader who was actually very, it was a great
482.18s:  conversation. I enjoyed it a lot. And she has a completely different approach to markets than I do.
487.14s:  She is essentially looking to trade intraday the vast majority of her book. And there's nothing
495.62s:  wrong with that. But it's very different than what I do yet it seems like it's working for her.
502.18s:  So does that mean that because it doesn't work for me, that it doesn't work at all? No, it means that
508.98s:  we as individual traders need to find what works for us as individual traders. So rule number two in
516.18s:  this case is once we identify some sort of profit mechanism that makes sense is you can't take this
522.98s:  haphazard approach to things. You have to be pretty methodical in how you're going to try to learn
528.26s:  and build strategies. It can't be this shotgun blast of randomly trying something for a little bit
534.58s:  and then randomly switching over to something else for a little bit because you're not going to get
539.54s:  you're literally not going to get anywhere like that. So let's rule number two. And then I would leave
544.42s:  maybe rule number three. And for those that are in the chat, I just dropped a video about like how to
550.98s:  create consistently profitable option strategies. And then I think I have another couple videos actually.
558.18s:  This one's about like how to create a strategy in how to create a strategy in five steps.
567.46s:  A lot of stuff on strategies. Don't I? Huh? Look at me go. And then I think I have one other video that
573.38s:  I want to share with you guys that's more broad about essentially trading options.
583.38s:  Successfully. Give me one sec. Let me see if I can find it real quick. This one.
595.46s:  Perfect. So those three videos I think are reasonable views for you guys on the topic.
601.22s:  So that's number two. And then number three is I think you can't be a bullshit artist. And like
607.46s:  if I were to boil it down to three rules, that's that's probably it. What I mean by you can't be a
611.46s:  bullshit artist is if you are unable to brutally and honestly dissect what you're doing yourself,
621.14s:  your decision process. If you cannot, if you do not have the capacity to do that and you find
626.98s:  yourself giving yourself excuses or saying, Oh, well, I was tired or oh, this or oh, that.
633.22s:  This isn't going to work. It's not going to work. You cannot approach trading, especially
638.34s:  something like options, which are so dynamic without taking full in utter responsibility
644.90s:  for literally everything about what you're doing. So if I were to think about the three rules
650.74s:  essentially those that's what they are profit mechanisms first, you need a defined approach
656.58s:  and you have you have to take responsibility for every step of what you do.
663.46s:  I think that's kind of how I would boil it down.
667.38s:  Policies they can generate an ordinate risk. They can. And that's that's one of the tricky things.
672.34s:  It looks like the mic might be blowing out one second. It looks like it's like kind of loud for
678.10s:  you guys. I don't want to kill your ears. So I just turned the mic down a little bit. Let me know
684.18s:  if that's better. I can never tell how loud it is, but I don't want to be too loud. That might be,
690.58s:  let me know if that's good. I if not you guys can always raise your volume up because my voice
696.58s:  changes a lot in terms of how loud I am. So that's not always listen or friendly, but I am I am
702.74s:  in fat about trading options. So that's how she goes. Ruta Biggest says it sounds fine. Great. That's
709.70s:  good news. Good news for everybody. So yeah, those are kind of the few rules I would give.
716.98s:  Then the next one here it says when you are determining your positioning into a trade, what are
721.62s:  key indicators that you look out for before entering? That's actually great. That's like a perfect
725.70s:  segue into this idea about trading trading options and creating like a trading checklist. So we'll
733.06s:  talk about that a lot. The sheet says you need to reduce the speed to 0.75. That's so funny
739.86s:  because when I talk about this stuff, I literally feel like I'm talking actually kind of slow
745.46s:  because I try not to go overly too fast. But the way that my brain works with just about everything
751.38s:  is I'm like grossly obsessed with efficiency. So I always look at it as more information in less time.
760.26s:  If you ever like if you catch me when I'm out walking my dog or whatever, I almost always have
766.34s:  my phone playing a podcast or an audio book and it's literally at least at 2.2 times speed.
772.74s:  I typically try to get like to two and a half. Two and a half is really difficult because you
776.98s:  have to like focus pretty damn hard. So yeah, it's interesting. But yeah, that's it's a funny joke
788.90s:  anyways. I enjoy it. The sheet says I joked on discord. I love the speeches joke. We can always
793.06s:  replay. Yeah, exactly that's exactly how I think about it is I try to be mindful of everybody's time.
798.66s:  All right. So we will get into the trading checklist in a second. It looks like there's another
803.14s:  question from Al Fons Al Fons. Oh god, yo, these names are so freaking tricky. Al Fons,
814.26s:  Z L. Okay, okay. My third great teacher would say sound it out. Al Fon, ZO and then and then
825.30s:  were were fucked because I don't know. I don't know. Okay, third great teacher. How do I sound out
830.90s:  something? I don't know how to sound out. Dingo, Dingo, dyngio, dingo, alf, al, Joey is helping me
843.38s:  here. Al Fonzo dingo, Al Fonzo dingo. That's weird. Sounds like a dingo, a chababy, Al Fonzo dingo.
855.78s:  That's from Tropic Thunder. I love that scene actually. It's absolutely hilarious, but to cross
860.34s:  some fucking lines. Okay. So Al Fons dingo says why the focus on GME? There are plenty of stocks with
868.66s:  consistent daily volatility. The gas twins have that average daily volatility of over 6%
874.66s:  and every day for years. It's a great question. So first, I'm curious if you guys have an idea why
880.90s:  I'm so enthralled by GameStop. There's a few things that feed into it. Trey J's got the joke. I
887.78s:  love that. What do you mean you people? What do you mean you people? So what is it about GameStop?
893.54s:  I've been trading for, this is my 17th year of trading now. So I'm coming up on 17 years.
900.18s:  What is it about GameStop that you guys think I'm so interested in?
906.66s:  Because to Al Fonzo dingo to their point, it's clearly not about volatility.
916.58s:  Gravitaris says puzzle to solve. That's the biggest component to it that I can think of.
926.82s:  Benoit says it's an expose in human behavior that is also absolutely cracked. Yeah. You guys
932.58s:  are literally highlighting essentially all of the pieces that make it so special.
937.94s:  The punchline is to why is because it is weird. That's what it comes down to. I have spent
945.78s:  thousands and literally tens of thousands of hours in markets, tens of thousands. I look at this stuff
953.38s:  a lot. I've seen a lot over that time frame. It is not common that I come across things,
961.14s:  especially at this point in my trading career, that are weird, that are just weird.
966.66s:  And something like GameStop is that it's just weird. It has so many things about it that make it
975.62s:  weird. It has this element of what I would consider to be market manipulation happening.
982.66s:  And again, you guys know that I do everything I can to be objective. I do everything that I can
988.74s:  to look at data and call it objectively, especially with the GameStop stuff. Because so many people
994.58s:  I find have been in it for so long that they default to everything being rigged and the systems
1003.14s:  bullshit and the guys trying to kill the little man and all that kind of stuff, which I get
1008.02s:  their sentiment. But it's not my sentiment. I don't align with that fully. I find myself towards
1013.38s:  the middle because there's other people that are like, the market's perfect, everything's perfectly
1017.14s:  price, everything's fair. That's also kind of bullshit. I don't agree with that either.
1024.98s:  I'm very much towards the middle. And when I look at something like GameStop, it has interesting
1030.98s:  price behavior. It has an interesting backstory and an interesting community. When I've been
1037.14s:  thinking the apes and really the GameStop community writ large for letting me be a guest in their
1043.54s:  space, because I've said that a million times and it's the truth. I view myself as a guest in the house.
1049.94s:  And I love how much people are willing to share with me about their experience with the product.
1056.42s:  There's literally an entire culture around it. Then you add on the layers of seeming
1063.46s:  nefarious actors from a short seller side. Then you add on the layer of Ryan Cohen,
1069.14s:  essentially intervening while it's seemingly going under undergoing seller boxing. Then you add in
1076.10s:  some random ass dude from the internet that puts band-aids on his face and starts a livestream
1081.78s:  pretend to be dead. And he has hundreds of millions of dollars and he trades the product the way
1087.86s:  he trades it. It's like everything about it is a freaking crazy story. It has all of the elements
1096.10s:  of an insane story. And if you look at the price behavior, it moves in such a way that has elements
1103.14s:  of predictability. I don't know what they are. And I want to know what they are. That's a big part
1110.74s:  of this is that there is some sort of solution to this thing because it moves in certain ways,
1118.74s:  whether it's from settlement cycles, FTD juggling, whether it's from op-ex tailwinds, whether it's from
1126.98s:  other ETF creation redemption cycles, it's hard to say. So the Cliff notes version of why I've been
1137.38s:  very focused on GameStop from a personal perspective is that there's all of that interest.
1142.26s:  The second reason and then I'll leave it here so I'm not on the point for too long but I think it's
1146.10s:  still pertinent is I think GameStop is a fantastic learning vehicle for people. Even people in my
1155.30s:  community that like that have been with me since I started back in 2020. For people that have been
1161.06s:  with me over that time frame, they're mostly options traders. They're trying to become better
1165.94s:  option traders and that's their angle on this stuff. Now to that end, you can learn so much
1176.10s:  about options, derivatives, market, literally how the market operates through a vector like GameStop
1184.82s:  that you don't experience before that. So for people that are listening from my viewership
1190.26s:  that did not know about GameStop much before this conversation, how many of them would be
1196.58s:  really well versed on something like FTDs, even what it is, not even well versed but know about it
1201.94s:  and know about how it could impact things or reg show. If you're not in a product like this,
1207.78s:  you don't see a lot of that stuff. So there is a ton, a ton of things that really fascinate me about
1217.38s:  the product on a personal level. It's something that's extremely, extremely tradable. I've made good
1223.86s:  money trading this and I intend to continue doing that. I already told you guys that that's one of
1228.74s:  the funniest things about this is the way that I stumbled across this is it popped up on some of my
1233.78s:  scans for a few days and then I was just like, I'll speculate in this and then all of a sudden it
1239.62s:  starts making these crazy moves. I trading it just because of the way that I look at markets
1245.62s:  and then I start getting caught up on what was going on, the actors because when I look at
1252.74s:  the original move, which I also trade it, that's the thing is I'm not new to GameStop itself.
1258.66s:  I've traded it back here. You can't miss this kind of stuff if you're a trader. You know these
1264.10s:  things are happening and you try to make money with them. So I'm not new to the product but I'm
1271.14s:  new to the story. That's the way I look at it. But it's something you can make a lot of money
1277.14s:  trading. Now I have to admit for a lot of people that are like solely in on GameStop, it pains me
1283.22s:  to see the way a lot of them trade it. It pains me to see people that take their life savings and
1289.30s:  they put it on zero DTE super far out of the money calls because of Bloomberg Terminal Guy on Reddit
1296.82s:  says I have super secret squirrel information that will change everything. That sucks just from
1304.42s:  them perspective. I like the reason why I started doing the YouTube channel thing in general,
1309.46s:  I say this a lot too. It's not because I have the fucking looks to be on camera. I don't belong on
1314.18s:  camera, but it's to try and help people. So it's painful to see people that I would love to try
1320.50s:  to help in some capacity still making those kinds of choices. That's always a bit of a bummer.
1325.30s:  But one of my hopes and the third thing I will say in terms of why GameStop interest me so much
1331.70s:  is I really, really do hope to share at least small tidbits of information that people can learn
1339.22s:  and integrate into what they're doing that will be useful to them. That's why I do all of this.
1344.82s:  So those are the reasons big answer, but it is a really dynamic product that I can go I really can
1352.10s:  go on and on about. It's why I'm doing a live stream with Newton tomorrow. You and I have talked,
1357.14s:  I mean, we text each other every day about GameStop and what's going on.
1363.30s:  So it's a mix of interest in product. It's a mix of one hell of a story and puzzle.
1370.58s:  And it's a mix of a great learning vehicle that you can make a lot of money in. That's how I think
1375.86s:  about it. All right, back up to the questions though.
1384.34s:  Nick says, how do you typically handle position sizing on options?
1394.98s:  Good question. So let's think about that. If I'm thinking about sizing a position,
1403.70s:  where do you think the starting point is? Do you guys have any ideas? And I think I have,
1412.74s:  I'm not sure if it's in my handy dandy. This thing is becoming a bear by the way. It's kind of
1417.94s:  fun. I'm just going to keep building this thing out until it's like this disgustingly long
1424.18s:  can't even read it. There's so much crap in it. Deck.
1427.78s:  A Paul says two to three percent risk. No, absolutely not. It's a good guess, by the way,
1435.14s:  but absolutely not. Any other guesses? I don't know if I have that in here.
1442.90s:  Well, we have another one that I have to add.
1445.54s:  I'm going to add that.
1453.54s:  Truck complain says risk tolerance. That is the closest answer.
1456.58s:  Roaring Titty, I will always say your name because I love it so much. Welcome to the stream,
1460.34s:  by the way. Not Delta. In Jase's allocation close. That's very close. All right, so let's talk
1466.98s:  about it. Here's the way I think about it. When I'm looking at sizing a trade, the very first
1473.86s:  thing I need to know is what does my portfolio look like and what does it need? Based on that,
1481.30s:  it's the first step. Let's pretend I'm in a world where the portfolio can take on any sort of
1489.06s:  risk, meaning it's open for anything. It's not restricted in any sort of way. Let's pretend
1496.34s:  that I don't care what I put on. I don't have some strong directional lean and stuff like that.
1502.50s:  The reason why I'm foregoing all of those nuances is because they're important to call out,
1507.78s:  but if I go through them all, the answer is very, very long. I'm trying to give you guys the
1516.02s:  important bits. I also have a video that literally talks about this exact thing in depth.
1523.78s:  I'll throw that in there for you guys. It's called how I size options trades.
1528.42s:  But here's the takeaway. The way I think about it, let's say it's something like GameStop. Great,
1535.78s:  great example. This would fall into the speculative allocation of my portfolio. What this looks like
1544.82s:  is if I show you guys how I think about my portfolio. This. When I think about this,
1556.10s:  I have two buckets. I have a core allocation and I have a speculative allocation.
1563.22s:  So when I'm trading something like GameStop, it falls into the speculative allocation of the portfolio.
1574.18s:  So with that, it gets a different amount of money right from the jump.
1580.98s:  And how much money it gets is completely dependent on the current market circumstances as
1586.02s:  annoying of an answer as that is. It is the honest one. It's not a set amount. But let's say
1592.74s:  that the general parameters for speculative trades is no more than 25% of the account.
1598.50s:  And you might hear that and think that that's a whole lot. It can be a lot. I'm not afraid
1604.26s:  of putting a lot of the portfolio into a specific trade. I also give myself a massive,
1610.74s:  massive birth to work through. So in general, my speculative trades would get about 10%.
1620.74s:  Maybe of the portfolio 5 to 10% probably in terms of risk.
1627.06s:  So Nick says, is the PowerPoint downloadable on the paid side of Discord or Patreon? It is not.
1633.54s:  The reason why it is not is because it is nowhere near done. I'm using it honestly just as
1638.58s:  like a personal reference as I'm doing like different podcasts and I'm working with different
1643.38s:  platforms like Irvin and yeah, stuff like that. So it's just a place to reference stuff.
1650.34s:  It's not I haven't really built it to be externally available. So anyways, back to the sizing,
1657.86s:  I'm focusing on the risk side of the equation. So you can size things based off of how much capital
1666.98s:  in the account you want to give something, which is okay. That's fine. That's still part of my
1671.22s:  equation, by the way. But then there's also the sizing based on risk. And it's a they go hand in hand.
1677.86s:  So let's say for example, I look at GameStop and let's say that I'm trading what size portfolio do
1683.86s:  we want to use for the example? We can use whatever example you guys want and then I'll tailor it to that.
1691.62s:  Try it. I would say at least $500. I knew it was going to be something like that. I hate that so much.
1701.46s:  Yeah, Reese, I like that number like $20,000. I would say I was going to say at least at
1707.30s:  least $15,000 at least. So in Rory Titt, Rory Titties equation of 500 bucks,
1716.26s:  like if that's the portfolio size, genuinely, I would just save my money. It's just you're just so
1722.58s:  you're just so much better off just saving the money. And I know that that's an annoying answer.
1726.98s:  And I know that that's not going to move any merch in terms of selling courses and shit. But
1733.94s:  I don't have a course to sell by the way. But the point is it's such a disadvantaged amount of capital
1741.78s:  that the overwhelming probability in that scenario that you're going to do something productive is so
1747.46s:  unbelievably low. I wouldn't necessarily call it zero, but it is damn close.
1757.78s:  So I wouldn't do that. Now let's say that we have the $20,000 portfolio.
1764.42s:  And let's say that we're okay. In that case, I would be much more careful with how much risk I would
1770.66s:  allow on an individual trade. I would definitely say I would not allow more than 5% risk. And if I
1776.90s:  was trading something like GameStop personally, it would be closer than like 2% risk. It's just
1782.98s:  because I know the way it moves. And with that little of an account trading a small account like
1789.46s:  that, your biggest job is to avoid drawdowns. It's not to aggressively grow the account trading
1797.94s:  because again, the probability of doing that with the small amount of money is so
1803.14s:  unbelievably low. And I don't say that to dissuade anybody. It's the exact opposite of what my
1808.98s:  objective is, but it's to be honest. And I've been doing this a while. So I say it with pretty
1816.42s:  strong conviction that I think for the vast majority of people trying to trade something like
1821.70s:  this with a really small account are probably doing more harm than good to themselves. I would never
1826.90s:  say don't trade it. Right? Like it moves very, very interestingly. So that's why I say in the example
1833.22s:  of a $20,000 account, let's say that we choose to give the position maybe 2% risk.
1841.22s:  Now, the way that you're carrying the rest of the portfolio matters quite a lot.
1846.98s:  The reason why it matters so much is because depending on how you're trying to make your money
1854.26s:  will be a strong determining factor of how to set this thing up. So to cut through all of that and
1862.50s:  to start answering the question succinctly, let's say that you have really, really, really strong
1869.94s:  conviction in GameStop. And you absolutely want to have a portion of your portfolio in here.
1877.86s:  Okay. So then in that case, if my conviction is really strong, maybe instead of 2%, I would take
1884.58s:  the total risk allowable maybe to 5%, but at 5%, it's like done. You can't go back in. So I would
1891.94s:  try to split that 5% maybe into a couple different trades knowing the way that this thing can work.
1898.58s:  So what that would do is then say of this $20,000, 5% allowable risk takes me to what, a thousand
1905.14s:  bucks. If I take 2.5% half of that, then that gives me essentially $500 risk per opportunity.
1913.46s:  That's what I would use to size the trade. So in this case, let's say that I wanted to put on a trade
1921.54s:  and I know from the jump what my max risk is going to be $500 so that I can try to take more than one
1927.70s:  shot at this. So let's say what would that look like? Well, there's another part of the equation
1935.22s:  that is to be considered in my opinion. And there's a couple different ways that you can think about
1942.90s:  it. But I could say, well, let's just say I think GameStop is going up from here. I probably would
1950.18s:  wait personally. Like if I were to play this like right now, I already told you guys I flattened
1955.70s:  my options trades back here. Like I'm I took the options trades down and I just have long shares
1960.90s:  right now that I'm holding. And one of the main reasons why I'm holding the long shares is more so
1966.26s:  just to support the movement is just to try to be a part of it with you guys. But anyways, so
1973.14s:  if though I wanted to trade this to the upside and I know that I can risk 500 bucks, I'm bullish.
1979.06s:  Then I would go through the strategy selection process figuring out what I want to put on,
1983.22s:  what duration, how it fits with the analysis, how it fits with the portfolio, yada, yada, yada.
1988.26s:  All of that though matters. That's why I mentioned it because without going through that process,
1995.38s:  is semi less informed when you're actually getting ready to place your trade. So in this case,
2002.82s:  let's say that I decide that I want to go out to 20 September. And I want to put on a trade
2008.02s:  that's bullish. So maybe I pick I hate these options. The reason why I hate these options is because
2019.22s:  they're they're like not liquid. Just like these are not much better. This looks like the best bet
2031.30s:  right here. Now this is also because the market's closed and all that kind of stuff. But these are
2036.74s:  30 cents wide. So let's just call it these. And you could put on a trade in these. It would cost you
2043.54s:  $6.15. If we analyze this trade, the total risk in this trade right now is $6.15. That does not
2055.78s:  mean I'm going to hold this until these are zero. If I do that, I've made a massive error in what I'm
2064.34s:  doing. And I am straight up asleep at the wheel. So in this scenario, I would say, where's my floor
2074.66s:  for GameStop? Where do I think that I would essentially manage risk to the downside?
2081.38s:  So let's go to this on the 17th of May. The reason I want 17th of May is just to cut this move out.
2088.10s:  So that this part of the chart has some depth to it because right now it's all so flat and
2093.86s:  congested because of this move. So what I would do is change the range here. And what did I say,
2101.86s:  May 17th? So we'll go to May 17th.
2111.30s:  Until today. And then we can look at it on a daily still. That's fine. I just want the chart to
2116.26s:  move a little bit so that I can see things. So in this case, I would determine where I think
2124.18s:  support is. And again, this is under the assumption of a bullish trade. So for me, you can literally
2130.26s:  see where I think it is, at least as of right now. This is where my initial stop would be set.
2136.10s:  2329, that's where it would be flattened. Cool. Now I know where I would get out. So now I need to go
2144.74s:  back. And I need to see where I can size this trade at at 2329, which funny enough, it's literally
2151.46s:  like a one standard deviation down move. So right here, this one.
2163.30s:  So at that one standard deviation down move, I would lose $100. But I know I'm okay losing $500.
2171.86s:  So that means that I can actually increase my trade size. It's going to take up more money up
2177.06s:  front, but I know I'm going to manage it. So in this case, instead of putting on one and using this
2183.22s:  as the total risk in the trade, because I know I'm going to manage it, in this case, maybe I do
2187.14s:  four. So then as long as the account can handle putting on a trade of this size, I don't know what
2193.06s:  this would be as a percentage of the total account. What is it? 615 times four 2460. So it's about 10
2201.06s:  percent, a little over 10 percent capital allocation on the account. And I don't care so much about
2207.86s:  that. Now if you're in a capital constrained account, obviously you would care about that. And you
2214.18s:  have to be very careful about where you choose to place your money. And you would have to then say,
2219.46s:  okay, this would be the maximum allowable size based on my risk management protocols. Cool. We
2226.02s:  know the answer to that. However, if we're in a, if we're in a small account that's constrained by
2234.58s:  size, then you might say, but I can't put two grand into this position. I need that money to be
2240.98s:  able to put into other stuff. So you've created a parameter for yourself right from the jump. We've
2247.22s:  looked at what we're able to risk. We've looked at what we can size it at given risk as the metric.
2253.78s:  And then we're bouncing it off the portfolio. This is how I would size this trade. The process
2260.18s:  that I just walked you through is about the same, but it looks slightly different. And I need to
2267.62s:  update the title to this video. Because we just talked a lot about sizing trades and I think it's good.
2276.90s:  All right. Now the other part of this equation before I would ever considering hitting the launch
2289.38s:  button is to validate the expected return of the trade. That's a really important step in this
2298.26s:  process. Because when I look at something like GameStop, one of the things I would need to do is say,
2306.26s:  okay, I know where my risk is. So if I trade down at my risk, I know that I'm essentially risking
2314.26s:  two and a half percent of my portfolio. That's not an insignificant amount of money. So where do I
2326.58s:  think it might go and how reasonable is it that it might go there? Well, it's kind of one of the
2334.42s:  cool things about options is we can use that to figure this out. So let's say based on a chart
2339.54s:  perspective, this looks like where the ceiling is just about 28 and a half ish, right? I can see that
2347.62s:  that's where these two hovered on. That's where it hit over here. Yada, yada, yada, whatever you do
2352.50s:  for your technical analysis, let's just say that I think this might be 28 and a half to the upside.
2359.46s:  Okay, cool. What do I make at 28 and a half to the upside? I make a thousand and 33 dollars.
2368.10s:  So now we're almost done with this process. I have, where is it?
2378.58s:  Move.
2378.98s:  Move.
2383.94s:  Here it is. So in the, I'm grabbing excerpt from an expected return calculator that I have.
2391.54s:  So let's say that you have one trade that you're going to put on. And in this case, the profit
2398.98s:  potential on the trade, I told you guys is 28 and a half at that. It would be worth about 10,
2405.94s:  21 ish. So let's say my profit potential is 10,021 bucks. And the loss potential is negative,
2416.02s:  would we say negative 400 ish, something like that. Yeah. So in this case, it would be negative
2424.82s:  400. So in this scenario, I'm thinking about putting on something that might make 10, 21 or it might
2435.94s:  lose 400. However, there's an important gap in this analysis. Do you guys know what the gap
2446.26s:  in the analysis is? And let me see if I can find that other window so I can just create like a,
2452.42s:  a blank slide for us to look at together. This will work fine.
2458.42s:  Time, that's part of it. That's not what I'm looking at here, but I like what you're saying. That's not it.
2468.66s:  One to two and a half. That's not it either. As soon as I post this in, you guys will then probably
2478.02s:  know exactly what it is. IV, nope. Probability is trucking plane for the wind, ding, ding, ding.
2483.86s:  That's it. So if I use this, I actually think I have a video coming out tomorrow about this. Let me
2490.10s:  double check. Yeah, that's funny. I literally have a video coming. Man, you guys are so good at
2495.38s:  like leading me into segways. There's a video I have coming out tomorrow called managing options
2500.42s:  positions and expected return literally in GME. That's hilarious. But anyways, we can give you
2506.02s:  you guys a preamble here. We're missing these two things. The probability of making money and the
2512.18s:  probability of losing money. Just because I say I'm going to try to make 1021, that doesn't mean I'm
2519.22s:  going to make 1021. That's not what that means at all. It just means that's what I'm trying to make.
2525.14s:  That's what I think is reasonable based on the chart. But that doesn't mean that that's in reality
2530.42s:  what this is. So then we need to go through the rest of the process exactly as you guys outlined.
2536.74s:  And the video tomorrow will go through the rest of that process. So I'm actually not going to double
2542.10s:  tap it here because it goes through literally the entire thing in depth. So I will share a link
2550.02s:  to the video that's coming out tomorrow. And it'll be out in the morning at 715 AM.
2557.94s:  There you guys go. You won't be able to access it now because when it's scheduled, I wish YouTube
2563.62s:  would let me do that by the way. I think it'd be really cool if the video is scheduled and people
2567.14s:  could still see it. But for whatever reason when it's scheduled, you can't see it through the link.
2570.66s:  It's kind of annoying. That thing would be cool to like give you guys a sneak really peak. That would be fun.
2575.70s:  But this is what we need to fill in next because this is then how we determine the expected return
2581.86s:  on the position to then finally validate if this thing makes sense. So good, good point.
2590.10s:  All right, back into the chat to see if there's any other questions that we want to hit.
2595.62s:  Roryn TV says, do you use hotkeys? I'm really struggling to exit my orders fast enough
2599.54s:  fumbling through order tickets. I do not. I do not trade anything that requires moving that fast.
2605.94s:  If I traded something that required moving that fast, I probably just wouldn't do it to be honest.
2612.34s:  Like if the speed of my execution requiring hotkeys to get in or out, that means I'm competing
2619.14s:  and doing the wrong thing in my opinion. That's a really tough way to make money trading personally.
2627.70s:  So no, I don't. Not really.
2635.06s:  Joey says, this is maybe think I've been too conservative, very likely. I absolutely do not.
2642.18s:  I do not doubt that. I think a lot of people have a terrible approach with respect to trade sizing.
2647.46s:  That's actually why I shared that other video as well. And it's so important to get it right.
2655.06s:  Because if you don't do that, then you essentially don't give yourself an opportunity to make money.
2664.82s:  Like that's essentially what it comes up with.
2670.50s:  Noah, Noah's Ark, Noah, what up Noah? Noah says, I know you don't like spreading hyperfied,
2676.02s:  but I'd love your perspective and prediction on what potentially could happen with GME after
2680.26s:  this Max Payne. It's Max Payne. And I'm assuming that you're referring to the video that I made a
2686.26s:  little bit earlier today for those that haven't seen it yet. You could check it out here. It goes
2692.58s:  into the concept of Max Payne, a little more in depth and how it works. Just because I know for
2698.26s:  the GME crowd, the GME folks are like very, very interested in Max Payne. And I actually think
2705.14s:  sometimes it can be blamed maybe a little bit too much. But in this case, I do think, especially
2712.90s:  today, that there's some element of it. But from a probabilistic scenario, the short answer is
2718.10s:  normally there's a reversion the week after. That's just citing the output of that study.
2724.34s:  So if you're a believer of that, then that's what you would expect. If you have a different way
2732.26s:  of synthesizing the recent market transactions or kind of the market trend, then it would be a
2740.90s:  slightly different answer because I think a couple of things going on with GameStop right now,
2744.74s:  one of which is small caps are down. And that just does not help GameStop. I'm not saying that
2750.74s:  that's like the primary profit driver. It's not. But it's also not something that's not
2758.02s:  involved in the equation. I don't know if I did the double negative right there. You guys will have
2761.62s:  to fact check me. But that is what that is what I think. So because if we take a look at this
2772.66s:  and we look at small caps, they're still pretty mixed. They're not doing terribly, but the majority
2779.86s:  of them are still negative. They're still bound. So that's a little bit of a problem. And it adds
2786.42s:  this just pull specifically to something like GameStop beyond the fact that literally the entire
2792.66s:  market was down today. Like everything was down a bit today. So that doesn't necessarily help much.
2801.46s:  Now it's been running around this point of control for weeks now. We started moving about the point
2810.18s:  of control back on the 10th of last month, where it has just been transacting around this over
2818.66s:  and over and over again. It's literally just oscillating sideways through it. So people are very
2825.54s:  willing to transact here. That's what it tells me. And that's where the overwhelming of volume has
2830.90s:  occurred. There's not that many people below this. So when I look at this, I do kind of question in
2837.70s:  terms of like how low does it go? Because it just is struggling to be moved lower.
2846.98s:  It's had, I know it's so difficult to see because this chart is so flat because of this move.
2852.42s:  We can actually just get rid of it for a second. And I don't know how to slide this thing down though.
2860.10s:  And by. So this to this was like a 20% return. So seeing something kind of come down after a 20% return
2873.30s:  and I oscillate sideways for a little bit, like that's okay to me. Now I don't think it necessarily
2879.46s:  has the wind at its back though. That is one of the problems I think we have here is when I look at
2886.82s:  the breadth of the market. This is starting to turn really not great. So we had net highs running
2898.50s:  for a while now. Like this is the first time we've seen them run like this since back in May.
2905.22s:  And we were definitely starting to gain a lot of steam. We hit a peak. And I mean, this is like
2912.10s:  a precipitous down move from this peak. We went from 458 net highs to 32 to 157 to negative 51.
2924.26s:  That is a big rotation in companies making highs. That is not insignificant. And then if we take a look
2932.26s:  at another index quick. So we don't just have to look at the the NASDAQ. I like looking at the
2939.78s:  New York Stock Exchange as well because it's a little more encompassing. It's just barely hanging
2946.26s:  in there still as compared to the NASDAQ. So that's what you're seeing here. It's not anything that
2956.02s:  I feel like it's not anything that you can kind of dismiss. And it's something that will serve as
2962.34s:  a bit of a headwind going on. So yeah, that's kind of the short term thoughts on what we're seeing
2969.46s:  here, at least in my opinion, for whatever that's worth.
2979.46s:  Model Blunder says it was a good video on Max Payne just watched it. That's awesome. Don't forget
2982.98s:  to like it. Helped me show up in the YouTube algorithm. We're still trying to grow, man. Right now,
2987.86s:  my goal for the year was to hit 25,000 subs. And it looks like we're on track pretty strong.
2994.90s:  It looks like we might hit that in the next like maybe four weeks or so. That would be really,
2999.30s:  really cool. That has been my near that has been the annual target for a while. So yeah, anyways,
3007.70s:  back over to this.
3010.74s:  Kirby says, what beer are you sipping on? Just curious about your choice of recap beer. Oh,
3017.22s:  check out this recap beer. I got you.
3020.26s:  There she is in all our glory. Actually, I don't know. Does that come through? I can't tell if it gets
3029.86s:  hold on. There you go. It like hold on. There you go. There it is. In all it's glory.
3041.94s:  Bam. A little bit of spin drift. Mango orange. I like this one a lot. It's my favorite.
3050.42s:  It's a good one.
3056.26s:  Let's see what else you guys got. Nick says we lost the 50 day MA watch for that to hold.
3060.66s:  That's probably a pivot point outside of the 200 week SMA. I don't know about the moving averages
3067.06s:  in GME. I'll actually take that as a homework item for you guys. I study moving averages on just
3073.38s:  about every product that I trade. I don't know them in GameStop. Moving average behavior in GME.
3080.74s:  I'll probably look at something like the maybe the nine, the 20, the 50, the one 50 and the
3092.18s:  200 probably just the 200 not the 150. I'll take a look at that and I will follow up with you guys.
3100.10s:  I owe you an answer there. I think for this specifically, it looks like, yeah, it's hard to
3110.74s:  make heads or tails on how it behaves around right like this. It moves about it a lot.
3122.18s:  So Nick says 5200 SMA or the best to watch. That is a really stint. Right. It's called the
3129.94s:  Golden Cross and it's called that for a reason. It's a very, very standard. The problem is for
3135.70s:  something like GameStop is it has its problems. Right. Like if you look at the lagging on the 200,
3143.78s:  which is picking up stuff like this, this lag in the 200 makes it difficult. Right. Like by the time
3153.14s:  you get the quote unquote death cross, which is 50 under 200, this thing will have already moved
3158.82s:  down 10 points. Right. It'd be a massive down move. So yeah, in standard products, I agree with you.
3166.10s:  The 50 200 is a very, very standardized moving average combination that's pretty efficacious.
3173.06s:  But in something like this, I actually am not sure if I would lean too heavily on it. I say that
3179.30s:  on all the videos that I'm analyzing GameStop is that I don't think that this thing follows a lot of
3184.98s:  the normal rules. So I always call that out because I think it's important, at least the way that
3190.34s:  I perceive its behavior around different technical levels is completely different.
3200.58s:  All right. Cool. It looks like I'm caught up on the questions. Let's talk about this tray checklist now.
3206.82s:  This is a bit of an older one and I probably need to update it with a few things, but I think it's
3213.62s:  a good place to start. The way I look at a tray checklist, there's two pieces to it. There's a
3219.78s:  pre-trade checklist and then there's a post trade. I typically call the post trade an AAR after
3226.26s:  action review or after action report. This is just a military term, but it's a post trade checklist.
3232.42s:  This is the same thing. So if you hear me flow between them colloquially, that's what I mean. You have
3237.06s:  the pre-trade checklist and then you have the AAR. So let's talk about some of the bigger components
3244.42s:  of it and then we can discuss a little bit about how to create your own because that's what this is
3251.14s:  for. I'm going through this to give you guys ammunition to make your own. So the way that I'm picking
3258.50s:  this checklist up is that you've already gone through your trade analysis. You've already found
3265.62s:  that it fits the portfolio and all of those kinds of things. We know we want to put the trade on.
3272.18s:  That's essentially where this is picking up from. So once that happens, we're going to verify
3278.58s:  that the product itself fits our general criteria and we know what's coming up. So the first step
3284.90s:  in this checklist for me is like a broad screen of the product and the environment. That's what this
3290.50s:  is. Then I'm going to make sure that I have a specific hypothesis. So the reason why this happens
3297.38s:  all the way down here in the trade checklist after I'm saying we already know I want to put it on
3302.26s:  is it goes like this. I'm looking, I know I want to be long in game stuff. I want to put a long
3308.18s:  trade on it. Okay. So I already have that idea. The hypothesis is there. However, the process that I
3315.22s:  was showing you in terms of building this, this is the hypothesis. So I have kind of that first stage
3324.58s:  of I want to be long this product. Okay. That's like the very high level. I'm going to look more
3329.30s:  closely at this thing. This is now actually building the hypothesis. Where do I think it's going to go?
3334.98s:  What's the probability of it going there in what time frame? It's why don't you start getting
3339.06s:  specific about what you're doing. So that's what's happening in this second step. Third step is
3347.30s:  based on what I find in this second step. I'm fitting a strategy that makes the most sense from
3355.06s:  my toolkit. The way that this works. And I realize I just need to like make a copy of this trade
3360.82s:  checklist in here. It'd probably be easier. But the way that this works is I go to this. Well, I mean,
3368.58s:  I'll actually go to this. I kind of know this well enough by now. But this is my stable of strategies.
3373.70s:  This is essentially 90% of what I do. If not more is just it's this one, two, three, four, five,
3381.54s:  six, seven, eight, nine. It's nine things. That is the overwhelming majority of what I do. So I'm going
3391.46s:  to go to this list and I'm going to figure out what things fit the idea. What fits my thesis.
3400.74s:  So in this case, I want to be long game stop. Okay. Am I expecting a big move or a little move?
3406.50s:  Depending on the answer to that, that will narrow down what kinds of things that I would want to trade.
3413.86s:  So this the step I'm outlining now is going through your stable of strategies in fitting what
3421.54s:  fits your idea. That's the third step. So first step, we're making sure that the product is suitable.
3428.02s:  Making sure that there's nothing coming down the tracks that we don't know about earnings,
3431.54s:  stuff like that. Second step, we're quantifying and getting specific about our hypothesis. Third
3438.10s:  step is fitting the correct strategy. The fourth step is finalizing the P&L management plan.
3444.90s:  So in this case, once we get through the hypothesis, we know it's going to go out, we know the
3449.14s:  probability of it going there. We know the expected return on the trade. This is where I am setting
3456.18s:  specifically how I'm going to execute the steps. Am I going to set an alert that is just above where
3463.54s:  my stop is so that I can exit it? Am I going to set a stop order? I did that today in T-Tribal
3469.86s:  Qs because I nibbled a little bit yesterday at a really tight stop on the trade because I didn't
3474.42s:  trust it here. I'm getting in what I was considering to be really, really early. So I wanted to take
3479.86s:  some of the trade down if it continued to experience a bit of a down move. So this is where I'm getting
3485.70s:  into the specific details of how am I going to execute the P&L management, which today I was
3492.10s:  stopped out, like almost right after the opening because I said it really, really, really tight
3498.74s:  on this, on the close from yesterday. So that's that step. And then the last step, this is where I am
3507.38s:  going to go over the whole trade to make sure that it's correct. Now I have to be honest with you,
3512.90s:  I don't do this anymore, like I really don't. This isn't something that's part of my review
3517.46s:  process anymore. I spend so little time doing this. I think it's because I have a lot of confidence
3524.90s:  in my execution at this point, but I think in the beginning, going through this is important to
3530.90s:  make sure that you're not trying to put on a certain trade and then you're putting on a completely
3537.86s:  different thing because you fat-fingered it and put on the wrong thing. That's that's a bad scenario.
3542.10s:  We want to avoid those. Essentially, it all costs. Those are terrible, terrible, terrible positions
3547.54s:  to have on. That unnecessarily nuke the return potential. So that's that. Now the very last thing
3561.30s:  from the pre-trade checklist is to input whatever it is into your trade log. So for this, I would
3571.22s:  need to outline the strategy. In this case, it was a ratio called diagonal. I actually think I'm
3576.90s:  going to rotate back in this to just using shares as compared to the options because the options
3582.18s:  are a little too liquid I was noticing. So I like the leverage of the options. I'm not fully convinced
3588.18s:  yet on T-Triple Cues if I'm going to stick with the coverage strangle or options, but I'm going
3593.86s:  back and forth because in back testing, I have an idea of how they both perform and I like them both
3600.74s:  fine. But the management of the strategy is about the same. It's mostly about the liquidity of the
3606.98s:  options. They're not terrible, but they're not good. So it creates a little bit of a problem when
3612.74s:  I'm trying to navigate positions like this. Like you can look at this. It's a $65 product
3618.66s:  this strike, for example, and it's bid 1320 offered 1450. It's just too wide. So because of that,
3630.58s:  I'm slowly getting pushed. But then you'll find more liquid strikes like this. So the 70s that are
3637.54s:  20-sep. So anyways, a little bit of background on the product. But the less component of the
3646.34s:  pre-trade is to track the requisite elements of the position after we launch it. So let me take a
3652.50s:  pause there on like the generalized pre-trade checklist and see if there's any questions.
3660.82s:  Now for those that are in the Patreon, there's the Patreon shop that you guys have access to.
3665.54s:  I have templates for most of this stuff in there for you. I actually need to update this one for
3669.30s:  you guys. But you can get an idea there, but for everybody else, literally you can just go through
3674.02s:  the stuff I was just showing you. And you can mirror your own from there.
3685.06s:  Alfonso says don't need RK and is use options buys. That's too funny. GME is closed above $30
3691.46s:  only six times since 22. All of them after his May 13th reappearance on X.
3698.50s:  Oh, I see. Roaring Titty was saying we shouldn't have to need Kitty. Yeah, yeah, I agree with you. Now with
3703.54s:  something like GameStop specifically, he is a big part of it. Like there's no doubt that he is a
3709.78s:  a massive player in the movement of the product. But like as a trader in general, I couldn't agree
3715.38s:  with you more. You don't need anybody. That's that is literally the beauty of being a trader.
3720.50s:  Is even if you're a business owner, you need things because you need to have people that help you
3727.46s:  or if it's just you to like build whatever it is you sell. And then you need customers to then sell
3733.38s:  to like you need things in trading. You literally need nothing other than access to markets.
3741.46s:  Everything else is completely wrapped up in its own thing. You do not have to talk to anybody.
3747.30s:  You need nothing. So trading is one of the really cool things where it's like it is genuinely,
3754.10s:  genuinely a solo endeavor. Do you participate with other people? But it is a very, very solo endeavor.
3763.22s:  That's the cool part about it. Matt says I bought a couple GME in the money 20s for September.
3773.46s:  With the recent Sus Clothes, should I be concerned? Let's take a look at that in a second. Yeah,
3778.34s:  I'll happily take a look at that. Let me finish the AR section of this. And then because the AR
3785.86s:  section is pretty short. And then we can take a look at that. I'm happy to. So this is essentially
3794.58s:  what I would wrap up with for the AR process. It doesn't have to be long. It can be whatever you
3800.90s:  need it to be in the beginning. As you're going through and thinking about creating a trade checklist
3806.10s:  and like an AR process, the first thing that I would ultra mega highly recommend to you guys
3816.02s:  is that you make it something that you will follow. It is so unbelievably worthless to build
3825.86s:  something that might track every detail or data point you could ever possibly need in your
3830.66s:  entire life. It is entirely, entirely worthless if you don't use it. So I cannot recommend enough
3839.22s:  that you pick things that make sense for you. This first step is to simply track what happened.
3845.06s:  This second step is to look at what happened in the context of the entire strategy system that you run.
3853.06s:  So for example, if I'm trading the ratio call diagonal in T triple Q's and I get stopped out today,
3864.74s:  I will then not only track the details on that for the individual trade, but I will look at the
3871.62s:  performance of the strategy as a whole. I will look at the performance of my interactions with
3878.50s:  the individual product. So those kinds of things give me a ton of information about what I'm doing
3887.30s:  and it helps me optimize the approach that I'm taking. So that's what that is. And I
3893.86s:  got to let my dog out really quick. I will be, be our be.
3897.86s:  All right, King. We are back in action.
3921.86s:  He is just ran into his bed and he's now in like this little tiny, curled puff ball. He's actually
3930.02s:  really hilarious when he lays down because he like hugs his back legs with his front arms.
3937.06s:  It's a, I mean, he's the most flexible thing I think I've ever seen in my life. It's actually very,
3940.90s:  very impressive. So that's essentially what I'm tracking in the second step though is I'm feeding it
3948.58s:  back into the strategy. I'm making sure the strategy did what it was supposed to do. I'm making
3952.98s:  sure that there's no new data points that I need to take into consideration when I'm running that
3956.82s:  strategy in the future. All of those kinds of things. And then the last thing is I'm bubbling it up
3961.62s:  one more level to the entire portfolio is my portfolio behaving as it should did this trade fit
3968.98s:  and operate within the portfolio as it was supposed to those kinds of things. Now,
3976.34s:  notice how I don't do this like what was your emotional fucking feelings when you played like
3982.98s:  personally, I don't care about that because I am a entirely grown man and I'm going to manage
3993.06s:  my emotions as such. Now that's not to belittle other people that feel like they might need to do
4000.02s:  that. If you feel like you need to do that and to track it, then do that. But I would also let you
4005.62s:  know that if you feel like you need to do that, you probably have some much bigger problems coming
4012.50s:  down the pike with your trading to be completely honest. If you're so emotional as a human being
4017.70s:  that you have to track and log your emotions when you're placing trades to not have problems,
4024.18s:  like how do you even fucking manage that is what it comes down to. Like to me,
4029.94s:  that is such a difficult, difficult way to try to operate with markets. So if that is you,
4036.58s:  do what you have to do. But what I'm highlighting is if that is something that needs to be
4041.22s:  baked into your process, it would be somewhere up here. And I know that that's really common for
4045.22s:  like day traders like right, your emotional well-being or whatever the fuck like I don't know to me,
4051.06s:  it's just like be a grown adult and behave like one. And it's okay. If you know that you're having
4056.50s:  a terrible day like we all have, I'm not saying I'm emotionless, I have them too. But if I know
4061.06s:  if I'm having a terrible day, I'm just not, I'm not going to do things in the market that I don't
4066.26s:  have to. So yeah, Rointit, he says you get therapy for the reasons you screw up your trade. Yeah,
4073.62s:  yeah, exactly. That's actually funny. The, I have a dude that I bring on the channel once in a while
4079.94s:  that I think is really, really cool. And he does like the cognitive side of trading. It's very,
4087.46s:  very fun to interact with him. But I definitely notice a really significant departure in the way
4095.62s:  that I think about markets and the way that I think about trading. But I did an exercise with him
4100.66s:  on the last podcast I did with him. His name is Richard Freason. He's a, he's a great dude.
4104.98s:  And the funny thing about that interaction though is that like the exercise he had me do was so
4110.18s:  uncomfortable. I hated it. But I wanted to play ball, right? Like that's the whole point is to try
4116.18s:  and keep an open mind and try to do things. And there was cool elements of it. I'm always willing
4122.66s:  to try things and I'll try to focus on the, the specific components. Yeah, I try to complain
4128.02s:  to Eric's inner bitch coming out on stream. That's exactly it. That was exactly it.
4131.54s:  Fuck, I hated that. But it, yeah, the thing is I try to show you guys the different ways to do things.
4141.54s:  And I'm willing to try things. But yeah, I mean, it's not like I would go super far down that path.
4151.54s:  Yeah, that's kind of what it blows down to I suppose.
4155.38s:  Day swag, which if you guys didn't know, the only way to pronounce that is day swag. Don't,
4162.66s:  don't mess that up. Don't disrespect us out here by calling them like disswag. Like you would
4168.02s:  think it's day swag. You guys got to put a little respect on his name. He says as a social worker
4173.94s:  and therapist, I love this. Yeah. Oh, God. I would, I feel like I would be a therapist,
4178.98s:  worse nightmare, at the, be honest. I just can't imagine that it would be a fun conversation with
4184.18s:  me. And I mean, I wouldn't blame them. Cool. All right. Let's get over to your questions now. We have,
4191.62s:  I mean, really, we have a while left if you guys want. There was a couple other things I wanted to
4195.46s:  show you guys, not from a pre post trade checklist. So actually, let me wrap that section up.
4200.66s:  Are there any questions on this idea of a pre trade or trade a our process? Does what we review?
4207.94s:  We reviewed generally makes sense. And are there any components of it that you want to discuss
4213.70s:  further? I have to imagine it's probably like the most boring part of learning about trading and
4221.78s:  learning about options. But I'm not here necessarily to entertain you guys. Although I like to have fun,
4228.02s:  I'm here to share the, the way to do this, at least as far as I see it. And that is part of it.
4232.98s:  So got to share it even though that's not exactly going to, that's not going to get the people
4238.58s:  jazzed up that we do know. Cool. All right. So it seems like there's no questions there, which is
4244.02s:  fantastic. Here we go.
4250.18s:  Elon Song says, sometimes do a live trade and walk through it in detail. I suppose I could do that.
4257.22s:  Yeah, I suppose I could do that. Like I could record myself placing a trade and share that. Yeah,
4267.46s:  I would, I would give that. That's a thing.
4272.50s:  Chewie says, do you write in paper? No, I do not. I use a giant Google doc. So it used to be
4281.22s:  a word doc. But then I moved into a Google doc so that I have a little bit more room to move.
4294.10s:  So this is what it looks like. The document is massive. You can see it like right now. It's over 400
4301.38s:  pages. This is essentially where I do it. This is essentially where I track almost all of this
4311.30s:  stuff. But this is where I track a ton of stuff. But yeah, it's in a word doc like that.
4318.02s:  Rointitty says you could do it live with us with paper trade. Yeah, I would be completely down.
4322.66s:  I'm happy to do that. Rointitty, you know, I can't say no to Rointitty. It's impossible. So
4329.54s:  Root of Vegas says you could publish it as a book. Yeah, but it would be like
4332.98s:  Marcus Arraileus' Meditations. Most people would read that and be like, what the fuck is this?
4338.34s:  Because it's all written for me. It's not really written for other people to consume. So it would be,
4343.78s:  I imagine a nightmare to attempt to read for the normal reader. But yeah, Rointitty,
4350.90s:  if you guys want to do that now, I'm happy to. It'll take me a minute if I'm going to do it in
4355.06s:  detail, which again, I'm happy to do that. If you guys want to pivot to that now, or we can take a look
4361.54s:  at any other questions you have, I think somebody is pointing me up to the top. Who was that? Let me see.
4370.10s:  Kirby says, don't forget Matt's calls before the next section. Yeah, where was that? Let me find them.
4376.42s:  Here it is. Oh, yeah, thank you. Thank you so much for the reminder.
4379.78s:  Matt says, I bought a couple of GME in the money. 20 calls for September. Yeah, let's take a
4386.26s:  look at these bad boys. So September and it's the 20s. Okay. Got them right here. And it says
4396.26s:  one for September, one for October. Okay. So we have another one out here and it looks like the 20s
4400.90s:  at both, which is here. Okay. With recent Sus close, should I be concerned? And there are new
4410.66s:  subscribers. Hey, shout out to you. Thanks for subscribing that you just moved us one step closer
4414.90s:  to that 25k. So thank you very much. It takes a village and then we get there. So thank you. So
4422.34s:  I wouldn't be concerned with the quote unquote Sus close. I would be concerned with the price
4427.62s:  behavior. If you want this to go up, it's not going up. So from my perspective looking at your
4434.82s:  question, I would turn it back on to you. And I would say, where is your predefined profit and
4442.74s:  loss point? That is the very first step in this. Because whether or not I think you're in trouble
4451.30s:  really doesn't matter. Like it genuinely doesn't matter at all. What matters here is what you think
4456.34s:  about your own position. And you're approached to managing your own position. That's what I think
4462.66s:  at least. Because when I look at that, there's a reason why I exited my shit here. Right. So
4469.30s:  that gives you where where I'm at in terms of what I would be doing with positions. But the
4476.26s:  difference also is that like I'm a trader. My entire job as a trader is to
4486.90s:  find things that are moving the way that I want them to and then to interact with them.
4493.62s:  That's what I typically think. So I don't see any follow-ups from him just in terms of the PNL.
4503.06s:  That would be the question I have for you though Matt, if you want to talk about your trade more,
4506.58s:  I'm happy to. But I would need to know two more things. I would need to know when you got into
4511.70s:  the trade and then what you're predefined profit and loss management protocols are. That's what I
4518.66s:  would need to see. Model Blunder's alter. What up says how far do you go back in your trading log
4527.62s:  when just a reviewing how strategies are performing? That's a great question. So I have it all built
4533.14s:  into essentially data infrastructure at this point. So the way that I have data that goes back
4541.78s:  probably like usable data that goes back probably 14 years, something like that. I didn't have
4549.94s:  great logs for like the first four-ish years of what I was doing. So I have data that goes back
4556.58s:  that far. And then it's almost like applying moving averages. Like I like to have the entire
4561.46s:  population of data available, but I often segment it. So I would I'm much more interested in how
4567.70s:  things are doing recently and stuff like that. That's the answer to that.
4574.26s:  Mark Khan says, what's your stop loss percentage? What does this have to do with?
4582.66s:  Mark, could you clarify just the origin of the question?
4586.02s:  Zach says I got 25 and 30 in October was up nicely but held. Yep, that's the problem.
4594.10s:  Especially with the 30s. Being out of the money out here is just dangerous. Now the good part is
4601.94s:  and hats off to you for going far enough out in time. That was actually a highly educated move.
4609.62s:  Did you know to do that or did you live did you learn that on the channel here? At a curiosity.
4615.54s:  Oh, who is this trade, by the way? Where was this?
4619.70s:  Zach, Zach, did you did you go out? Would you typically go out in October? Or I learned that from
4629.14s:  you. Okay, awesome. Well, one that's one Pat myself on the back, but two, I'm actually really
4634.10s:  stoked that you did that because here's the deal. Take a look at your theta. It's three cents.
4640.18s:  So you're still losing a large percentage of this without a doubt. But if you compare that to
4647.22s:  the other people, what delta are you at? You're at a 50 delta. Compare that to the people here
4652.02s:  at a 51 delta and their options are worth. Let's call it 270. They're losing six cents a day.
4660.58s:  They're losing a massive, massive amount of the total value of these options on a daily basis. So
4669.30s:  they are in the definition of swimming upstream hardcore, hard for. So I'm actually really,
4678.58s:  really stoked that you went out that far. Now, even in your scenario, though, I would like.
4687.30s:  Yeah, I think holding after this day was a mistake. Personally, while going, a swag is out here
4694.58s:  again, hitting up the Jamaicans is good. So yeah, that's the thought on that. Obviously,
4701.54s:  happy to go further into in the detail. I'm going to get back. All right. Alfonso says in the
4716.18s:  likely IV crush from Max calls September is historically the worst month for stocks in general.
4722.74s:  I don't know about the seasonality there. And the seasonality also is slightly dependent. So I
4728.74s:  wouldn't make big trade decisions off of seasonality like that personally, because it's not,
4735.22s:  it's really not. It's not the most efficacious thing. But it's, it is something to be aware of,
4743.78s:  I suppose. I don't, I don't hate being aware of that. But I wouldn't make that a big deal personally.
4751.38s:  At least the way I think about it.
4755.94s:  The next question I see is from Paul. And Paul has a very hypothetical question here. And Paul's
4764.58s:  hypothetical is also we have 68 people on the stream. So first off, shout out to you guys.
4770.74s:  Second of all, if you guys can invite one more person and no more than that,
4775.38s:  that would be the most magical thing. Really, if we could just hover at the magical number for a while,
4781.86s:  that I think would make my night. So we might have to vote people off the island if it starts
4787.06s:  rising above that. But I mean, we just need to get one more human being in here. I feel like
4791.78s:  somebody has a friend that they could just open up their phone and just put it down even if
4796.50s:  they're not watched. Oh, damn it. We just lost three. We moved away from the magical number. That's
4801.06s:  the worst.
4804.90s:  You guys got me excited and then ripped it away from me. Unbelievable.
4810.10s:  Well, let's go back to Paul's very hypothetical. Paul says, Jimmy leaps from to the April low,
4820.42s:  to May 80 run. I'm curious if you sold a call. What that would look like.
4830.26s:  I have to read your question again. From the April low,
4834.90s:  okay, so that's like here ish. 22 April. And then we held those leaps
4844.02s:  to 80. We didn't get to 80. So I don't know when this was.
4851.30s:  And then. So this looks like the scenario is we bought leaps here,
4859.62s:  held them through this. And then now we're looking to sell calls.
4865.30s:  Am I reading that correctly?
4868.02s:  And Ram says 80 happened after hours. Okay, got it. I see. I got it. Let me see real quick.
4877.38s:  There's a there's a set in here for good old after hours.
4886.90s:  That's not it. Where was it?
4890.82s:  It's somewhere in here.
4895.86s:  Oh, no, no.
4901.78s:  Damn it.
4906.10s:  Is it in here? Here we go.
4914.18s:  Hmm. That's interesting. So I just asked it to show me the extended hours.
4924.98s:  And I don't see that move here.
4929.54s:  Kind of annoying, isn't it?
4933.46s:  Oh, I wonder what's up with that.
4935.78s:  Anyways, back to Paul's question.
4941.38s:  So Paul, help me understand quickly if are you looking in the proverbial position?
4949.22s:  Is your friend looking to
4953.86s:  sell a call now? Is that the question?
4957.54s:  Roryntitty says reduce the time frame. Let's try. Do like this. I see. Do we have to go back?
4968.18s:  What time?
4971.22s:  Um, how far down do I have to go? So it has to be like a daily time frame.
4977.06s:  So we have to look at when was this? May 14th?
4983.78s:  I just want to see it on here. May 14th. And then let's do.
4993.46s:  We don't need that. There we go. Like four hours maybe. Let there it goes.
4998.42s:  I see it now.
5000.18s:  Does that.
5002.10s:  Check that out. Great news.
5006.02s:  Great news for us. Thank you.
5009.62s:  My OCD is satiated. So thank you guys very much.
5017.70s:  Uh, Paul, you've, you've, Paul has left the chat. Paul, where'd you go?
5023.70s:  Oh, there's Paul. Welcome back, Paul. I thought you, I thought you dumped on me.
5031.06s:  So what, what are we trying to do here with this position?
5034.90s:  From my understanding, we have leaps from here that we just diamond handed through this
5041.22s:  until they're worth nothing. A quick admin note, not that this matters, but it's just so that
5047.38s:  the pedantic Reddit police don't get on you guys. When you're referring to leaps, it's leaps.
5056.10s:  So it's not like a, a leap or anything. Yeah, it's LEPA, LEP, APS.
5062.74s:  And it stands, it's an acronym. It stands for something. Paul says no selling at that peak.
5069.22s:  What would the profit be? I see. Okay. Oh, and you're talking about selling a call. You
5074.26s:  would get murdered. Or do you mean buying a call?
5082.58s:  I have to go back up to Paul's question again. What the fuck is it?
5086.50s:  Jamie leaps. I'm curious if you sold a call. I see what you mean. Okay. Man, that was a trick
5092.82s:  you want to get to. So here's what we're trying to do. You're saying in a hypothetical scenario,
5097.38s:  if you had gotten leaps at a on this day and you sold them, you top ticked them, you would have
5106.02s:  to do it during the normal market hours. So you wouldn't get to 80. We can see what the option
5113.70s:  would have been worth. I am now following you. Yeah, we could take a look at that. We got through
5118.18s:  it together. It's all right. So let's go back. One was the low. This was on the 16th of April.
5124.10s:  April 16th. And I'm going to structure the trade that I would. So I'm not going to ask you a
5133.54s:  bunch of insular questions about like how far out what delta's you would use? Like I'm just going
5138.58s:  to set it up. How I would set it up. And I personally wouldn't use leaps in this case. I would
5147.62s:  I've been trading typically 90 DTE and in. So I'd probably go at most out to 18 October to split
5154.82s:  the difference with you. And then I'm going to target something around a 70 75 delta is what I want.
5162.42s:  These are a liquid. I don't like that. They're a dollar 10 wide. These are more liquid. I don't like
5167.86s:  that more. So these are a dollar 10. So that's about what you're going to get here is what it looks
5173.62s:  like. Those are a dollar 15. So yeah, this is this is what it is. And then. So let's say you get in
5179.46s:  for these at 340. Let's say that we're talking about a proverbial. Let's say that the trade
5188.90s:  allocation is going to get. I'm going to think on like a standard account size using like maybe
5197.22s:  like a hundred or a hundred or a hundred fifty thousand dollar account. Let's say that the total
5200.66s:  risk on the trade is maybe eight percent. So like a eight thousand dollar loss or something like
5205.94s:  that. So where do we think this thing can go to the downside? We have to get rid of this other one.
5217.86s:  So we have to pick a downside move to figure out like where the because it's like literally
5222.98s:  hitting lows. Go off further. I have to go off further still. This is crazy. Okay, so that's
5232.26s:  like lows lows, huh? That's like is low as this baby got. There it is. He's you have to go back super
5239.62s:  far. So I would pick something like. At or below this.
5260.66s:  About that. Let's see what that gets us.
5263.62s:  853. So the way I look at something like this with such a tight stop. I might give it a little bit more
5272.26s:  room. Oh no, it's not okay. Yeah. So we're at 995. So we have some room to move here. This is good.
5278.18s:  This is much better. So let's say at 853. You lose $170. We're willing to lose up to like eight
5287.46s:  brand. So we need to get like maybe 60. No, like 50 of these. Yeah, that's about right.
5296.18s:  850. 8500. That's a little too much. So maybe take it down to like 45.
5303.54s:  850. It takes us 7600. That's pretty good. So yeah, so you would get these for 340.
5310.18s:  And then when was the peak of that? Was it May 14th? I said,
5317.22s:  I think it's going to be a little bit more than it is.
5321.46s:  I believe it's something like this.
5328.66s:  And then I will be right back again. I need to get a refill on salt or water. You guys know how it goes.
5376.98s:  All right. We are back in action. We are reloaded ready to rock and roll.
5398.50s:  Except we have a new salt or water. We went with coconut pineapple, which I feel like coconut
5404.34s:  pineapple is pretty good. It's still not my favorite. I like the watermelon one much more if I'm
5408.74s:  being honest, but it's still good. Got to mix it up. I really like those spin drips, but I can drink
5415.14s:  too many of them. So we have to swap it out. All right. So day swag is trying to figure out what
5423.62s:  Paul is asking. He's just trying to see what these options can be worth. If you get a big move in
5427.14s:  your favor, that's pretty much it. And it would be worth $220,400. That's the answer to your question.
5442.34s:  So in this case, and this is not necessarily at the peak, it looks like the peak already kind of
5451.06s:  happened. No, it's a, yeah, it's sort of been like right at the open. I don't even know if I can
5455.30s:  get that close to the open on this. Let's see. So yeah, in this case, you would have laid out,
5465.78s:  let's do the math. It would be $340 times 45. So you would have laid out $15,300. And then you
5474.98s:  would have made $220,000, $220,000, $410. Yeah. So that is, that's for your app.
5497.06s:  Joey says it's a lot of unlikely. Yeah, I mean, the probability of people bottom
5502.66s:  taking and top taking it like that, it's so unbelievably low, like a pock elliptically low is
5510.10s:  even how I would frame it. But I mean, to Paul's point, like it is cool to see what these could do,
5516.98s:  right? And to get to get a sense of how they might behave or something like that. So yeah, I like
5524.26s:  the idea here. All right, let's get back up. There was several other questions that I want to
5532.10s:  hit. And like I said, I'm not in a rush tonight. So I'm happy to run through as much as you guys want.
5541.70s:  Okay. Who cares says where did you get the data? I assume who cares that you're referring to
5549.46s:  the data for the trade log and the trade log data, the strategy data is my own from my own
5555.22s:  trades. And then the broader data that I use to analyze and back test stuff is from SIBO. I buy it
5561.62s:  from there. The next question I see here is from IBOY. And they're saying, what makes you enter a trade?
5568.58s:  Do you try to scalp based on short term sentiment? Or do you build positions and companies that
5572.98s:  you believe in the long term value? Not so much either of those, to be honest. My approach to trading
5579.38s:  is much less loyal, I would say. So what I mean by that is I have again, this is why I built this
5588.58s:  thing because it is very useful for summarizing lots of stuff. So this is essentially what I do
5596.34s:  in options from my perspective is I trade directionally and I use options for leverage. And I trade
5605.94s:  volatility. I trade both forms of structural alpha and I trade discretionary as well. So I would
5616.42s:  consider that more of a soft edge. So really what makes me enter a trade is generated from one of
5623.94s:  two places. Either when I'm looking at the portfolio, I will notice one of two things. The portfolio
5633.54s:  as a whole, it might need a specific kind of risk, meaning if I have a bunch of long delta, I might
5640.18s:  need short delta. So if I have a bunch of short delta, I need long delta. That kind of thing.
5645.06s:  That will then send me down a path in terms of what kind of trade I'm going to put on. Or I can
5650.50s:  identify an opportunity and then I can look to trade the opportunity. So really basing on both of
5659.22s:  those scenarios is how I end up placing a trade. But it's much less of a I scalp or I trade X,
5668.50s:  Y, or Z. I trade a lot of different things is the short answer. If you want to dive into any
5673.86s:  more specifics there, I boy, as you know, I am absolutely happy to dive more in a detail. But
5682.66s:  that's the kind of the summary. Mark Khan says, if your options are shitting the bed and don't look
5689.30s:  good for the future, at what point do you cut your loss? You decide that before you enter the trade
5693.78s:  without a doubt. Again, that's why it's part of the trade checklist and it's why it's part of what
5700.82s:  I was showing you guys here. And this is part of what you'll learn tomorrow in that video.
5706.66s:  Is all of this should be defined ahead of time. Like what one of the funny things about trading
5712.26s:  is that if you are a good trader, like a legitimately good trader, the actual act of trading
5718.90s:  is fucking easy. And I don't mean that in terms of hyperbole. Like it is easy because all of the work
5726.26s:  is done before you enter the trade. The trade is the easy part. You just do all of the shit
5732.26s:  that you plan to do. So in this case, the easy answer to that specific question, Mark, is you
5740.02s:  got it, you have to define that before you enter the trade. There's just no exception to that.
5745.62s:  If you're not defining it before you enter the trade, you have a massive problem that is going
5751.30s:  to rear its head sooner or later, where traders suffer from things like the disposition effect,
5759.62s:  where we don't want to close losing trades because then it realizes a loss and that's a painful
5764.10s:  process. So is annoying as an answer of that that is that is the thing.
5774.58s:  Gravataris says, how do you determine whether to take profit or roll to upgrade to lower
5782.50s:  strike price? That's easy. One, that's also generally part of my predetermined plan. But two,
5790.50s:  it depends on my sentiment towards the position. So Gravataris, for your question specifically,
5799.22s:  if you give me an example, I can work through it with you. And then we can work through, yeah,
5806.82s:  we can work through it together. And then just so you guys know, if you guys are dropping
5810.26s:  in new stuff to the chat, I am not seeing it because I'm way up at the top trying to catch up on these.
5815.54s:  Paul says, can you put alerts on an options value? Absolutely. You can put alerts on the options
5820.90s:  value. And you can also like place orders that are predicated on the options value,
5827.78s:  or you can create calculators, essentially, that do it for you, which is another really useful tool.
5835.94s:  So I have this here. I'll show it with you guys this thing.
5846.26s:  So kind of from the same Excel book, you can do something like this.
5851.14s:  And you can do more, right? Like this was actually just specifically to show people the process of
5859.54s:  calculating what an option will be worth at specific stop points with a stock. But, yeah, you can
5870.42s:  essentially see exactly what the option will be worth that if you want to rest orders or whatever.
5875.70s:  Charlie C2 says, been writing cash secured puts and covered calls on GME, been making bank.
5883.94s:  Yeah, the problem is sooner or later, you're probably not going to like what happens.
5890.10s:  That's typically what happens with people that trade those. So yeah, I'm glad it's been working
5895.46s:  for you. That makes me very, very happy. But I would be very cautious with that strategy at the same.
5901.14s:  Kirby says, I think Mark was asking to you normally set trades at a standard stop loss,
5906.74s:  or do you have a max of 20 or something? Okay, Kirby, the answer to that is it's not
5914.18s:  it's not set standard across the board, but it is adjustable based on the strategy and what the
5920.02s:  portfolio needs. That's the way to think about that. All right.
5930.98s:  Apollo says, do you apply just to individual trades or strategies campaigns as well?
5936.74s:  Could you clarify what we were talking about at that point? I don't remember.
5942.26s:  Ahmed says, do you use gamma to decide the regime of the market? Yeah, I don't really use it to
5946.98s:  decide necessarily the regime, but I absolutely pay attention what net gamma is. Because if you know
5952.42s:  the gamma exposure of the market, you can have a pretty good inference of what hedging behavior,
5960.34s:  will have on the behavior of the product that you're trading specifically. So yeah, I definitely
5966.42s:  pay attention to net gamma. It's kind of not like a massively important component, but it is still
5973.70s:  something that is important to monitor, I think. Reese says, what would you consider a relatively
5982.74s:  safe play for picking options on GME that wrecks out that expires a few months, trying to learn from
5990.90s:  my mistakes today. Well, I think the first thing is again, defining what you think you want to happen.
6000.90s:  And then from there, I would build something that makes sense based on your disposition. So for
6008.02s:  example, if I'm looking at GameStop and I want to be generally long GameStop, I don't know when
6014.58s:  it's going to explode because nobody does. I don't know if it's going to explode again, but it
6018.42s:  probably will. So I want exposure to it, but I don't know how far out to go. Well, you have a
6023.94s:  couple of things. One, the easiest solution in the scenario, honestly, is shares. And it saves you
6029.30s:  a lot of problems. Now, if you want to use options for the leverage or for whatever other reason,
6036.18s:  that's totally cool. And if doing that, I essentially would expect to manage the options as if it
6046.58s:  were stock. Because again, I am a trader. I'm not going to just hold this thing in general for most
6054.34s:  of the like for the base position. I caveat it right because like I said, I have shares, but that's
6061.46s:  that's me being an emotional human being. That's not me being a practical trader. That's actually
6066.82s:  one of the cool parts about trading is sometimes you can do silly things like that. Not saying that
6070.66s:  holding shares is silly, but I'm saying what I'm doing with it is silly is I'm essentially just
6076.10s:  holding the shares literally just to participate with you guys. I think I've given you guys this
6081.86s:  example already, but to reiterate it, I have shares of AMC that I bought years ago literally from a
6088.42s:  bet that I made with somebody on a YouTube live stream that I told them that I had shares and
6093.62s:  they're like, Oh, when are you going to sell them? And I think I made a joke saying that like I
6097.22s:  would never sell them. So I literally am going to just have those shares of AMC in my account until I
6102.50s:  fucking die because I made a random bet with somebody on a YouTube live. So not everything is
6108.50s:  completely pragmatic. And I'm differentiating that right because the way that I'm trading this to
6114.02s:  make money is one thing. The shares that I'm holding is another thing that's literally just like a
6117.94s:  participation component. Okay. So that whole thing aside is when I look at this, I would decide
6128.58s:  where I would want to get out if it breaks below. Like this is probably realistically where I would
6134.18s:  be looking. Like if there's some sort of dump below 18 to I don't think I would want to hold it
6140.58s:  below that if I were to enter a trade. Now you can see that I already have a stop that's higher than
6146.90s:  that. And that's because I would reevaluate and adjust my position if it starts to fall below
6152.10s:  this level because things start to material change in terms of how it fits into the portfolio.
6157.86s:  So all of that sums up to how I think about the position itself. And I would say, okay, maybe I
6168.50s:  have an initial stop here at 2083. And then maybe I have a hard stop at 18 to something like
6176.74s:  that. So then if that's the position, I would then personally, depending on the time frame,
6182.58s:  I wouldn't go out 300 days. And it's just because these are going to be not really liquid. And if you
6188.74s:  get a big move in your favor, which would be very cool, you're still going to take a massive
6195.06s:  haircut on the position just in terms of liquidity. So I wouldn't want to be that far out.
6200.10s:  I would probably want to be something like 90 days out no more than that. And it's literally
6204.98s:  for the sake of liquidity. So then I would find where I can find some liquid options.
6210.58s:  I would expect the 20s. These are probably the most liquid ones. I know they don't see it, right?
6215.78s:  I know these are right now. But if the market was open, I would surmise that it would be these 20s.
6221.46s:  That would be tighter than the 15 spread here. So that's my guess is I would go somewhere like that.
6226.82s:  And that's essentially how I would think about isolating where I would want to be. And then I
6233.06s:  would go through the sizing process portfolio fit. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all that stuff. So that's that.
6243.94s:  All right, cool. I think I'm all caught up. Perfect. All right, I'm just getting caught up on now the
6254.42s:  most recent chats. Man's can't go. What a name. What a name. I love that.
6267.94s:  Man'scape goat says, can you explain the MOC and balance trade? Yeah, could you eluce a day or
6273.86s:  I'm sorry, could you expand a little bit more on what specifically about that that you want to
6278.74s:  talk about? I'm happy to. I just need to know exactly what direction you're trying to go.
6283.14s:  Roryn Titty says, how can you be accurate that when the options price change dynamically?
6288.26s:  If you're are you talking about I assume you're talking about this, the spreadsheet thing that I
6293.30s:  was making in terms of like telling me what the value of an option is going to be at a certain point.
6297.62s:  Is that correct? And if so, I can easily explain that.
6305.94s:  But I want to make sure I'm looking at the right thing.
6312.26s:  I'm looking at the right thing.
6322.58s:  In the meantime, while I'm waiting for Roryn Titty or the Man'scape goat, essentially he's asking
6329.30s:  about market on clothes and balances. So it's kind of tricky. But a primary reason while you will see
6340.90s:  them is when people use market on clothes orders, it's an order type. So if I go into on demand,
6351.62s:  the reason I'm going into on demand is so that I can pull up a trade and not flash like my entire
6357.46s:  account details. Even though the one I'm using right now is my pass-through account, it still has
6362.66s:  stuff that I don't need out there. Well, this is kind of annoying. I thought maybe this would
6367.94s:  give us decent options. Oh, I forgot. This is the weird day. Of course, let's pick another day. Let's
6373.86s:  just come not that far. We're going to the 7. So I'm just waiting for this. There it is.
6392.90s:  So if we place an order, it doesn't matter which one. There's different times and forces you
6399.78s:  can choose and there's complex order types. So one of the order types you can choose is a market
6408.26s:  on clothes. So essentially, if you want to use the closing price for the day for your execution,
6416.90s:  that's what you would select. So those imbalances can happen with an influx of those. They can
6424.18s:  happen for other reasons as well. But I think the easiest way to think about it is because of
6434.50s:  just a flush of orders that don't have sufficient counterparts. So that's what market on clothes
6443.38s:  is and that's where the imbalances result from. Let me know if that, if you have any follow-on
6450.82s:  sport. Let me see. Kirby says he's an options trader. He's like a play. He keeps his options open.
6468.66s:  Yeah, that's a good way to phrase it. That's kind of the idea. I think that's the idea of being a
6472.42s:  trader in general is to just try to find opportunities. That's the way to make money doing this.
6480.66s:  Emream says, do you ever catch unicorns like these players that were buying one DTE on ribbon,
6486.18s:  AVGO crowd at the market clothes the day before their events? Sometimes. It seldom the case,
6494.34s:  but sometimes it's definitely not any sort of primary like profit mechanism that I try to pursue
6502.10s:  because it's not consistent to any significant degree. So yeah, in general, probably less so,
6511.06s:  but I mean, every once in a while, I'll catch them. A lot of the reasons why I catch them is when
6517.54s:  they pop up on different scans or alerts. I actually, that reminds me, I need to build another
6522.34s:  alert too. There's another alert I need to update for like sequential stock gaps.
6534.42s:  Yeah. So sometimes like for something like crowd, this one popped up on my radar simply because of
6544.02s:  this price behavior. So we had three consecutive gaps down that generally will pop up on a scan
6553.14s:  that I have. And then what I like to do is sort them by the move from the starts of the gaps to
6559.94s:  where it is now to look for severity. So it gives me an idea of like different things I can look for.
6564.98s:  This is really interesting too, though, because I feel like this is kind of overdone, to be honest.
6570.58s:  But this you can kind of pick up on something squirrely going on here pretty quickly, I think.
6578.98s:  Gravitaris says, GME 25 short put a profit on Tuesday and wasn't sure if I should go for 20 call
6588.10s:  further out. When you say SP, what does that mean to you, by the way? Because that's,
6594.34s:  it's really confusing to use that terminology. I guess I should correct it now for your own good.
6599.22s:  SP equals strike price. Yeah, okay. So from like typical nomenclature, that equals strike price.
6605.30s:  This equals stock price. Nope, not that one. My bad. This one. Let me delete this other one so I'm not
6610.26s:  confusing people. So K equals strike S equals stock price in normal parlance. Now you'll find some
6619.46s:  people my mentors actually one of the people that
6622.66s:  switch those. He would use S for strike K for stock. But that's not normal. Normal use would be K
6636.26s:  as strike S as stock. So yeah, anyways, back to your question. You had the 25 strike,
6646.90s:  had a profit and wasn't sure if you should go for 20 calls out in further August. Are you
6653.54s:  comparing the two, the two positions? I'm trying to understand the like what you're trying to
6660.42s:  solve for there. Are you talking about if you should have closed the 25s to then move into the 20s?
6666.98s:  Yeah, I mean, I've got a lot of different ways to solve this.
6676.90s:  Adding context to the role upgrade question. Oh, I see. Yeah. I wouldn't even bother with that to be
6682.66s:  honest. Like if you have a stock, if you have a position that did what you want and it's defined,
6688.98s:  follow the plan for that position. And then if you like it still, and you want to put on another
6692.98s:  yeah, unnecessarily, it just kind of adds a layer of complexity that it probably doesn't have to be there.
6704.98s:  Day swag says I feel like the answer to my question is to keep them out of one to one ratio to
6709.22s:  ensure that I'm not exposing myself to a ceiling. But I'm still new to understanding your experience
6715.14s:  with them. Day swag. Are you referring to the covered calls? Is that correct? And if so, I'll show you the exact
6725.62s:  problem. Let me know. Day swag, if you're referring to covered calls there. And then yeah,
6738.50s:  obviously I can answer for you. Man scaped goat says what it makes sense to play a
6745.22s:  strangle into earnings best way to play options into earnings or is playing Pied the best way. Pied
6750.82s:  is different. So Pied is post earnings. Now leading into earnings, there's a force that typically
6759.54s:  yields expanding volatility into the earnings release. So you can see that right here. Here's
6766.58s:  the earnings day. The yellow lines here is volatility. So this shows you like about as clear as
6773.06s:  day too. This is a great example because the stock was going up normally a stocks go up volatility
6779.06s:  goes down, but it didn't as the stock went up volatility was going up because starting about two
6786.26s:  weeks out, you will see volatility expanding into the earnings release. So that takes you to about
6792.90s:  here. And you can see it, especially on the 30 day vol is when it started to slowly climb up and
6800.42s:  out. So in this case, if I want to trade the volatility expansion and I don't have a directional
6806.26s:  disposition for something like that, I would use even ssh. Did I say without a directional
6816.26s:  disposition? If I said without a directional disposition, I would use long straddles.
6822.34s:  If I have a directional disposition, I would use long options of some sort, long single options.
6828.82s:  I don't use strangles as much for the build up. I typically use straddles and I try to gamiscalp around
6835.54s:  them. So and then for Pied for those that don't know, that stands for post earnings announcement
6847.14s:  drift. And that's a really, really well known market force, by the way. It's highly defined and
6853.30s:  it's highly observable. So you can play the post earnings announcement drift either to the upside
6859.46s:  or to the downside, but it requires the stock to make specific moves after the earnings. It has
6866.50s:  to have a significant enough of an earnings beat. And then it needs to have a specific size gap
6874.02s:  that it makes. Let me grab the study for you guys right now.
6882.18s:  This. So this is a fantastic, fantastic study for you guys to check out. And there's this one
6896.02s:  that looks at the pre earnings announcement drift. There's a bunch of different studies. These
6902.58s:  are two of them that I think are kind of topical here. So this one. It shows this is kind of the part
6909.46s:  to highlight into. There's professional investors are looking at Pied academic evidence shows strategy
6916.34s:  produces abnormal return of 2.6 to 9.37%. So it's kind of talking about the severity of it in what it
6923.14s:  looks like. But there's very specific criteria that has to be met in order for post earnings
6930.50s:  announcement drift to take place. I don't know if they go into that into the conclusion or let me
6938.10s:  see real quick. No, no. Here we go. I'm just trying to see if in here it quickly highlights what
6953.78s:  needs to happen.
6961.46s:  It doesn't. So anyways, it's in here though, where it will show you specifically what criteria
6969.54s:  have to be met. So it's typically like at least a 10% gap and then a certain size beat on EPS.
6977.22s:  Something like that.
6978.98s:  Let me see.
6991.86s:  Lee says, what's up Eric? What brokers do you use pros and cons any favorites? Yeah, I use Schwab. I
6998.18s:  use think or swim primarily. So that's the platform. And the broker is Schwab. I like them so far.
7007.22s:  I started with TD Ameritrade and I started with them out of pure luck and then I've just stayed
7011.94s:  with them because I like them. I've always been able to negotiate my rates with them. I have fair
7015.70s:  rates that are definitely competitive for somebody that charges rates. I like the support that
7020.90s:  they provide the tools so on and so forth. So yeah, I like them.
7026.26s:  Yes, Schwab says I was referring to risk management to the coverage strangle and was wondering if
7031.14s:  keeping a one-to-one ratio would help from that previous thing you said about you won't like
7036.74s:  when that happens. So maybe when something like when someone else is talking about covered call,
7041.78s:  I get we need racios to survive an issue of cap ceiling. Yeah, exactly. So exactly. I avoid the
7051.94s:  one-to-one ratios on anything that I want upside potential on, which is most trades.
7057.94s:  That's the tradeoff for placing the position like when you're holding shares of something like
7063.70s:  GameStop. There's you have downside risk. That's the penalty. That's the potential downside of
7069.54s:  holding the position. So the reward for the downside that you're exposed to is upward price movement.
7078.66s:  If you cap that, you've now taken away the reward for the risk that you're taking. So in this case,
7087.86s:  I would not want a one-to-one ratio. In this case for something like this, let's say I would buy
7096.50s:  500 shares of GameStop, whatever it is. And then I might sell two maybe three calls against it,
7101.70s:  probably closer to two for something like GameStop specifically, which is primarily a pretty
7106.98s:  aggressive up-side style trade. So yeah, that's the general thought there.
7113.70s:  Emoryam says, how do we feel about net options pricing effect as a relatively new metric?
7119.14s:  How do you incorporate it? Feels like, feels interesting as options markets are increasingly
7124.50s:  driving the underlying performance. Yeah, that's actually really interesting because I
7130.50s:  fully agree with you to a degree. There's a lot of really, really great studies on like the tail lagging
7139.06s:  the dog. I would argue that options markets still have an impact, but I don't, I haven't seen
7149.70s:  enough research to lead me to believe yet that it's driving the stock price. I'm unsure about that.
7159.06s:  Yeah. So at least that's like that's the general thought. Let me see if I can find a couple studies
7168.18s:  for you. That's not it. This one I think is it. Yeah, this one. So this is a study that I think is worth
7191.06s:  taking a look at. And we can take a peek at it real quick before it pop off.
7205.78s:  Not pop off in terms of like flipping out on somebody. We're not popping off like that, but
7211.06s:  we're going to pop off the stream in a minute. And then if you're unaware, I am doing a live stream
7217.30s:  tomorrow with Newton. So you should absolutely come hang out for that. But
7230.26s:  where's the actual paper? I have to find the paper. This isn't what I wanted. This is just showing us
7239.86s:  the some of the materials. Where's the paper?
7248.26s:  That's kind of annoying.
7260.66s:  I'm seeing if I can find the base paper for you.
7269.54s:  This is another good one. It's slightly different. It's more about price informativeness. But
7281.14s:  I think this is the actual paper for that other one we were looking at. This is it. There we go.
7308.58s:  Got it. So this is the full version of this paper. This guy. So let's see.
7320.98s:  This paper tests the prediction and finds statistically and economically significant
7325.46s:  negative relationship between stock return volatility and net purchased option prices of
7331.06s:  investors who are likely to head. Hence we provide the first evidence for substantial and
7336.26s:  pervasive influence of option trading on stock prices. So these guys find specifically with
7343.62s:  respect to hedging the positions. So I think that there is something to be said there. But again,
7349.54s:  I think you have to ask the question of severity, which I'm not convinced that there's massive
7354.50s:  severity yet. All right, you guys. I am wrapped up for today. Thanks for hanging out. Really,
7365.78s:  really fun conversation. I love these. I am going to keep these up probably for a few more weeks
7372.02s:  and then just kind of transfer the Friday sessions just into a standard beginner session as
7377.06s:  compared to something that has like a set topic each time of some sort. Like the topics will become
7381.86s:  more random. Right now I'm keeping the topic still in a general order that I think makes sense for
7387.78s:  people that are learning options. So that's the goal. And we have the other thing I wanted to share
7394.10s:  with you guys really fast before I pop off is what is this this one I've updated this. So I'm still
7403.54s:  building this out as you can tell this was the original version of the syllabus. This is kind of
7408.82s:  designed to be a list of videos that I think you should read or read. You should watch been on
7414.42s:  a stream for too long if you're talking about reading videos. But that I think you should watch in
7420.10s:  order. And then this is a more comprehensive list of sub topics that I believe belong into a
7431.46s:  broader list of more topics. So this list is much much longer, but this is kind of designed to be a
7438.42s:  more holistic snapshot of essentially not knowing anything about investing to the concept of creating
7447.22s:  a sustainable practice and spreading into other asset classes. This spans essentially all of that.
7453.38s:  So if you didn't know updated version of that there.
7458.34s:  Vino says do we have access? Yes, this is free for everybody. So this isn't behind the Patreon
7462.90s:  or anything. This is for everybody. It's in I don't know if it's in most of the video descriptions.
7468.98s:  Maybe it should be. I don't know if I've done that yet, but there's the link to it. Everybody's
7475.30s:  welcome to check it out, download it, whatever you want, but that's available for everybody.
7480.42s:  All right, you all. Be an outlier. I'll see you this weekend.
