0.68s: what is up everyone another GameStop
2.84s: update because the volatility won't quit
6.08s: so this is from the 19th of June I want
8.16s: to walk through what the volatility was
9.84s: yesterday what it's looking like today
11.32s: take a walk through the options chain
12.96s: with you guys and then answer a few
14.56s: questions that I got in from a couple of
16.76s: the last videos that I think are great
18.28s: questions and hopefully they will help
20.52s: us look at options more uh in depth and
23.64s: have a better capability to analyze
25.84s: markets with them that's the idea so 19
28.84s: June volatility was at 20785 after the
31.76s: close right now we have about 13 minutes
33.92s: before the close so Market's not quite
35.52s: closed yet and when I took this
37.56s: screenshot maybe a little less than 10
39.04s: minutes ago the 20 June front expiration
42.48s: volatility was up to
43.96s: 247 again mine blown the fact that this
48.36s: is kind of scorching up that much is
52.04s: still absolutely wild to me look how far
55.44s: out the implied volatility is starting
57.88s: to increase what I like to do is compare
60.60s: the previous chains and see how far out
64.00s: do I have to go before there's not much
66.04s: change and realistically you have to go
68.08s: out 365 days to the 20 June 25s these
72.00s: are 10365 against 10243 so these went up
76.08s: marginally but there's massive massive
78.76s: massive volatility expansion Within
80.36s: These shorter term expirations again
82.36s: this has gone from 207 to 247 this has
85.12s: gone from 161 to 189 we're seeing
87.80s: volatility expand there's no if and or
90.48s: butts about that now you guys had a lot
93.56s: of really interesting ideas in the
94.88s: comments of the last video cuz I asked
96.28s: your opinion why is this happening I'm
97.88s: still trying to figure it out I don't
99.04s: have a definitive answer for you and I'm
100.56s: not going to pretend like I have one I
103.00s: think that's a disservice to everybody I
104.60s: have tons of ideas on what it could be
106.56s: but my ideas don't really matter what
108.24s: matters is what I can objectively see
110.64s: and share that with you guys as you know
113.08s: my goal is not to spread hype or fud
115.48s: it's to share information and then let
117.76s: you interpret it however you so choose
120.84s: so sticking straight to the facts
123.68s: massive expansion in volatility no doubt
126.08s: about it as I look at the volatility
128.24s: smile there's another really interesting
130.08s: function here you'll notice on the put
132.44s: side the volatility cracked above 1,300
136.08s: now it's over 1,500 on the put side now
140.28s: a couple people were talking about this
142.32s: question right here hey something's
144.68s: going on 125 calls IV just exceeded 900
148.84s: great eyeball
151.04s: unfortunately this doesn't mean as much
153.04s: as you think it might I'll explain to
155.32s: you why when market makers are making
158.72s: markets they have to make qualitative
160.72s: assessments about their risk so when we
164.00s: look at really really far out of the
165.96s: money
166.88s: options we price those typically way
170.80s: more Rich because there's way more risk
173.32s: in holding that position so when we go
176.00s: all the way out here to the 125s that
178.20s: are Bid at a p offered it too we're over
181.60s: 1,000% IV now people are thinking man
184.96s: this means that we got to be going up
186.68s: right it actually doesn't that's that's
188.96s: really not what this means what it means
191.20s: is there's absolutely a perception of
194.20s: risk to the extremes this is what we
196.84s: would call fat
198.84s: tailes and in kind of statistical terms
202.56s: we have a normal distribution curve
204.60s: markets do not represent normal
206.72s: distributions they have what we call
208.24s: skew and curtosis this is not a stats
210.64s: class not going to bore you with it the
212.76s: fact of the matter is is we get extreme
215.08s: moves way more frequently than a normal
218.72s: distribution would project for us so if
223.84s: I give you an example of the really far
226.08s: out of the money puts here notice the
227.88s: implied volatility on the super far out
229.56s: of the money puts
231.80s: 1700% that is because there is a
234.72s: perception of way more risk super far
237.72s: out and this is also one of the biggest
240.28s: problems with buying these really cheap
242.72s: far out ofthe money options is because
244.96s: they're so expensive they are priced so
249.76s: rich for what they are and I know that
252.64s: sounds weird because you're like well
253.84s: dude it's a penny and a half how rich is
255.60s: that on a relative basis Super Rich Mega
258.92s: Rich Ultra Rich cannot be more Rich very
262.04s: rich so what I'm highlighting is this is
265.12s: a pricing functionality of markets the
267.24s: market makers are going to get their
269.28s: pound of flesh to take on what they
270.88s: perceive as risk and that's exactly why
273.88s: you will see this in the far out of the
275.96s: money options now to be clear on a
278.68s: relative basis and something else that
280.20s: you guys may or may not know when we
282.44s: come down here and look at the smile
283.96s: it's exactly what I'm looking at I know
285.96s: that some of you guys think that uh you
288.08s: know it's easier to see in the chain and
289.64s: maybe so but when you look at this stuff
291.12s: enough it's exactly what I'm seeing
292.96s: right because if I go to these 125s
294.72s: which are way out here I can see what
296.48s: the IV is it's a, 38% right I can see
300.44s: that that's what the smile shows me all
302.04s: in one spot but the smile also shows me
305.08s: that the put side is way way more Rich
309.32s: this still is noteworthy and this is
311.76s: because of the way that GameStop behaves
315.44s: what that means is it does have the
317.40s: ability to pop to the upside if you go
320.04s: back to some of the videos I did last
321.60s: week the beginning of this week the call
324.24s: side was way more Rich than the put side
327.56s: that means the market was anticipating
329.72s: significant upward movements that it was
331.72s: pricing them into the options but we're
334.60s: seeing this kind of normalization where
336.60s: the puts are way more rich and kind of
338.40s: to help maybe prove this point a little
340.20s: bit more let's go to something like
341.92s: apple apple big company moves around but
344.12s: not like a ton and if we take a look at
346.40s: the super far out ofth money puts
348.72s: they're at 2,000% IV it's the same
351.32s: function if we go to the Super far out
353.16s: ofth the money calls in this case it's
354.32s: only 250 why is that well because on a
357.36s: relative basis the market fears the
360.64s: downside way more in carrying this
362.64s: position so it's demanding a massive
365.00s: premium on how they're pricing the Vols
368.00s: in these super far outof the- money
369.24s: options that's one of the the downfalls
372.00s: of using super far outof the money
373.84s: options is on a relative basis they are
376.52s: exceedingly expensive so now as I take a
380.28s: look at the options chain as I typically
382.28s: do with you guys there's a few things
383.88s: I'm seeing the very first thing I'm
385.60s: seeing is take a look at the number of
387.00s: calls traded today however This Time
389.20s: It's Different different especially from
390.80s: yesterday look at how many of those are
392.92s: being entered in at the offer and
398.04s: above
399.60s: 39% this is bullish skew then if I look
402.96s: at the put side and I see 33% of those
405.84s: puts came in at the bid these are
407.80s: selling puts again also bullish skew so
410.84s: it's not easy to say again definitively
413.72s: what this means to me it just looks like
415.32s: people trying to really take advantage
416.96s: of this crazy high volatility that's
419.00s: what I see
420.08s: as far as the reason for the volatility
421.84s: we're still trying to figure that out
423.36s: there's all these different ideas
424.72s: between the ftds between these other
427.68s: ETFs that might be surrogate shorting
430.40s: GameStop and that has a relationship
432.32s: here potentially all sorts of ideas
434.36s: which are kind of fun to track down and
435.84s: keep an eyeball on just right now
437.40s: there's no definitive answer as far as I
439.08s: can see now the last thing I want to
442.28s: mention is when I take a look at this
444.92s: other question which was a good
446.84s: question is with all the options at 25
449.92s: and 30 expiring tomorrow do you have any
451.40s: guesses what will happen in the stock
452.80s: after hours if it closes above it's a
454.96s: great question and to me there's enough
457.60s: liquidity in the market right now for
459.24s: market makers to be able to cover their
461.32s: positions that's my guess so as I look
463.60s: at the 20s the 25s we can see we're
467.80s: getting a bit of a rally right now it's
469.20s: up a little over 3% but these are
471.56s: already at a 93 Delta a one Delta so
474.12s: what that tells me is the market makers
475.80s: in these kinds of positions they're
477.88s: already going to be essentially fully
479.52s: edged coming in into the expiration now
482.00s: this is if they're not playing the shell
483.84s: game which they might that's hard to say
487.20s: but from a standardized procedure my
490.00s: assumption would be that as these
491.68s: options are getting further further
492.92s: further in the money that the market
494.64s: makers have plenty of time especially in
496.20s: this scenario with the recent Equity
497.64s: offering to scoop up their protection as
499.96s: needed to fully hedge these positions as
502.12s: they would want that's my guess shell
504.56s: game could be going on again really
507.00s: really difficult to tell we have to wait
509.52s: and see exactly how the price behaves
511.92s: going forward so another wild day
515.96s: another really busy day for GameStop in
518.04s: terms of volatility we see again this
520.96s: crazy expansion so I'm going to be
522.80s: keeping a really close eye on it to see
525.00s: where we go from here as always if you
527.44s: have any questions or anything you want
528.64s: me to take a look at let me know I love
530.80s: looking at this stuff with you guys see
532.84s: y'all later
