0.00s: What's up everyone? Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I am here with Nick. It does say I think it's a listen down there. I'm assuming that it's sorts.
13.00s: Even though you might, I mean, you look beautiful, but I'm going to take you for an Alyssa, but welcome to the podcast man. Great to meet you.
22.00s: Yeah, yeah, for sure. I had a I don't have any. My main setup for like all my computers and screens. I have no camera. So and then I have a laptop, but I used to do quant stuff on it and it literally blew up. So now I have to use my wife stuff.
38.00s: Fair enough. And then I mean, at the end of the day, if you blow up her stuff, it's not yours, right? It's just you didn't. It's like, I mean, I paid for it. So I guess I guess it wouldn't be that great after buying a new one.
51.00s: Yeah. Well, I like I was telling you right before we started recording. And then for anybody watching, I don't right now it looks like a little choppy for both of us, but I'm recording it to the clouds. So I think it'll come through. Okay, the audio sounds great. So if it looks a little choppy, don't sweat it. It's on our in not ours or not yours.
68.00s: But it should be legible and you should be able to hear us anyways. As I was telling him right before we start, I mean, like I said, you look great. I don't. So it's not like people watch this to look at me. So I never really think that's a problem anyways.
81.00s: But like I was saying right before we started, I was introduced to you by a long time viewer of my channel who I really respect his opinion of people markets, those kinds of things because he takes a very scientific and programmatic approach to things. And as you were talking about the quant stuff, it obviously immediately made sense to me.
102.00s: Why he's been keeping his eye on you. So I was asking for recommendations for podcasts. And he threw you up in my discord. He's known as dad bod jelly belly, which you always got to love like a good discord or it reminds me of like on Xbox. There's like the random screen names and stuff. It's always the craziest shit. It's all like dad bod jelly belly, but that's what he goes by. So he recommended you and I was super stoked.
132.00s: But that a chance to look up some of your background and whatnot and obviously the fact that you started in, well, I don't know if you started in the UFC, obviously you had a little bit of stuff proceeding that I think you actually had a very non traditional approach in that if I'm not mistaken at 13 you had dropped out of school.
151.00s: And then you started going down obviously a very different route than a lot of standard people go down. So I'm looking forward to dive into that. But you have a very non linear pattern, which is actually very linear for traders.
167.00s: All of us come from these crazy as backgrounds. Some of us very, very make sense and a bunch of us were just literally a band of missments. So you had your early experience went to the UFC. You were wheeling and dealing out there. You fought people. I think you fought Islam, Makachev, which is fascinating.
188.00s: I think I saw Charles Olivera, another pretty big name in the sport. I mean, like you were definitely out there doing doing the thing. And then in the meantime, you decided that like some of us, you have a giant nerd inside of you got fascinated by markets.
205.00s: So we a lot to cover taking us back all the way to the beginning. I want to focus specifically on the point that you dropped out of school because you mentioned something in another podcast that really stuck with me that I want to linger on for other people, which is the way that that impacts our self assessment and the way that we think about ourselves and evaluate ourselves and you've been able to overcome that.
232.00s: So talk us through that point when 13 year old you is like, OK, I'm done with this. And then where did you go from there?
241.00s: Well, what you're saying is not exactly correct. It's actually opposite. So when I was young, when I was younger, I grew up in a house that was full of not so good people.
254.00s: So drug, drug, lots of drug use, lots of alcohol use. And my stepfather was an evil person, essentially.
262.00s: And he sort of dragged on our family and he kind of put my mom in a situation to where she wasn't functioning correctly either.
271.00s: So because of that, like, I went to school, but not that often. So really the first the first 13 years of my life were that I had very little education. So I had almost none.
284.00s: And then eventually, and then eventually what happened is I was taken away from that family. And then I should have shipped up to live with my father.
293.00s: Now I went from the ghetto into like a middle class neighborhood with my father who's a well adjusted proper businessman. And so then I had to get initiated into school with no background really.
306.00s: So did I go to school? I did, but I was abused and my parents didn't care. And so so coming up that way. It's like I was thrown in to high school with none of the requirements.
318.00s: So, so that's the lack of education part. And then my father put me in school. And then, and then I started to learn everything much faster that way.
328.00s: So that's that's how that kind of initially started in the life. So, so it wasn't.
333.00s: So I didn't drop out when I was 13. That's like when I just really first got into it.
339.00s: Right. Okay. And then before that's when you went through like the big transition, you dropped out of like your previous cycle.
345.00s: And then you moved into this new one. Yeah. Got it. And I mean, one of the things that sticks out to you or sticks out to me about you.
354.00s: It's very similar to what we find in a lot of military people is just adaptability, right? Like that right there is starting on the path of adaptability.
362.00s: So you get into this better environment. You start learning and you start building kind of your your base education.
370.00s: And then when do you what do you do after high school? What's after that?
375.00s: So I ended up learning the stuff I needed to in high school very fast.
381.00s: But I was a very depressed kid. So I was very tough because I was used to fighting people my whole life, my stepfather.
388.00s: We live in a very rough neighborhood. So I mean, I fought all the time. So I was a very tough kid, but like deep down I was very depressed.
396.00s: I was I was sad. You know, I didn't I hated myself. I you know, if I looked in the mirror, I didn't see anything I liked because I've just been talked down to my whole life.
405.00s: And so my father decided to initiate me into sports and he started with wrestling. And so he put me into wrestling as sort of like a way to for me to, you know, gain confidence to get in better shape.
419.00s: Like I wasn't super fatter anything, but I was I was in terrible shape. I was just I was just in a very sad kid.
425.00s: And it turned into an obsession of mine, essentially, because I started to get really good at it.
432.00s: And then I went from being unknown to being unknown. I went from nobody caring about me to a lot of people caring about me.
439.00s: And that sort of that initiation into like, if I work hard at this skill, people will pay attention to me. People will like me and it makes me feel better about myself. And so I became a, a very good wrestler very quickly.
454.00s: So I started very late, but by the end of my senior year, I was one of the best wrestlers in Minnesota. And then I went to the university in Minnesota who had the best wrestling in the country at the time.
465.00s: That's how I got into college. So I essentially got into college to be a wrestler with the idea of like competing in the Olympics later in my life. That was kind of the initial why went to college.
476.00s: And then eventually I tried to be a doctor that I was going to go to school to be a doctor.
481.00s: But what I just college just I just didn't like it, you know, like I didn't fit in.
489.00s: I had a hard time relating to a lot of people there. The people in the wrestling team, I always was very good wrestler, but I didn't get along with the actual wrestlers on the wrestling team.
499.00s: And it was the first time in my life that I was really on my own again. So it's like I was on my own when I was young, but then I went and moved with my father.
508.00s: I went back to being on my own all this, this realization of everything I had dealt with as a child started to kick in.
518.00s: So I had trouble sleeping. I had trouble focusing. And then my career in wrestling and my college career started to tank rather quickly, because I needed to like deal with that kind of mental baggage that I had never really dealt with.
532.00s: And that's really interesting. So that's actually a part of your story. I didn't catch in the other podcast that is really curious to me.
543.00s: So how do you get out of that rut? You go through this rapid learning phase. You start seeing success. You start seeing some of the social recognition of your work. That's part of the fuel.
558.00s: And then you start actually kind of going on this little bit of at the climb, which you wouldn't expect given what we know about the rest of your trajectory, right? Like, bumps don't get into the UFC. So something happened somewhere between those two points. What was it?
573.00s: It was just pretty much just my life just fell apart. So essentially like I like I just I really crashed. I became very depressed. I became very frustrated with my father who had taken care of me for allowing me to go through that, even though it wasn't his fault.
589.00s: It was taken away from him, but what I got frustrated with him. I got frustrated with my family. And I sort of just went off the rails for about a year. And it just I had to learn how to deal with it, because really what I did is is when I got to my father, I just sort of like pretended that that that the previous life didn't happen.
610.00s: So like, like it sounds ridiculous, but I really didn't think about it for five years. I just I just I just never thought about it. I just like I was it was like I was a release from a prison camp. I was just like, thank God that's over. Now I'm going on to the next space.
626.00s: But you can forget about something for so long, but it starts to like it's like a shadow behind you. It's always it's always there. And if you don't take care of it, it will start getting into your life. So I started to like really struggle sleeping. I was having lots of nightmares. I started to to people would
644.40s: maybe someone would be slightly offensive to me, but I would take it overboard like like it was like my stepfather trying to attack me or something, you know. And so then I would go overboard aggressive to them. And it's very hard to have relationships in life when you when someone says something small and you blow up, you know.
661.20s: And so essentially my life tanked very badly. And about I ended up having to drop out of college. And I ended up having to move back in with my father, who I was constantly fighting with now.
674.20s: And eventually for for whatever reason I had no money. I had nothing. I decided to try a fight because some guy offered that he would pay me 500 bucks to fight and I needed money.
686.20s: And so I went to a bar and the guy gave me 500 bucks and I went out there and knocked a guy out and like five seconds. And so it's like he gave me the 500 and I was like, okay, well, maybe we could do that again. And I had to then again and again and again. I did it five times. And then I sort of I sort of had this realization that
703.30s: maybe my wrestling career in my background could could somehow make it so I could take this seriously and I could become a professional at this. And it was trying to learn how to fight trying to do the business side that helped me to rebuild the relationships with my father that helped me to rebuild my family.
723.10s: And it gave me my personal worth back. And then I was able to like deal with all the issues that I hadn't dealt with previously. And then one day, like I wake up and it's like, this is my life. Like I'm a professional fighter. You know, like, like I didn't plan it. It wasn't this grand plan. My grand plan was to wrestle in the Olympics. My grand plan was to become a doctor.
743.90s: But I just crashed and burned so hard that one day I woke up and I had nothing again. And I didn't like that feeling. And so I had to fix that. I just didn't know how. And then it probably could have been anything.
756.70s: Whatever job I picked, you know, it's just whatever I had focused on. I could use that to pull myself out. And when you go through a depression like that. And when you go through a life like I had and you have to examine it.
770.90s: You really learn about yourself more than most people do. And in that process of learning about myself, the psychology, you know, like the things that I thought it bothered me that did, you know, like it was.
782.40s: It was a great learning and it gave me a base to really expand into fighting and into a business person. And it gave me a lot of skills that I don't think a lot of people have.
794.90s: Definitely. Yeah. I actually think the best thing to come in from adversity is the ability to work through it. I think one of the largest.
805.30s: It's a gift. It's a gift in disguise, because I didn't probably come from the same background as you, but I had a single mom. I walk through metal detectors every day. I was really bullied at school because.
816.50s: I was a minority there. So I just looked different. And yeah, it was that whole thing, right, which is funny, because as I talk to people in this space, so many of us have such a similar story.
829.70s: And, but I think the way that you addressed the other component is something to linger on for people because just like a lot of military people when you're going through kind of the early stages of your career.
841.90s: You're especially like marine officers, you're supposed to be kind of indifferent to everything, right. So you're not supposed to really show much.
850.50s: And the whole idea behind that is a good example, but much like you that leads to excessive compartmentalization. And then you not really addressing things, but it sounds like you were able to get to a solid point to start working through some of your background and actually turn it and turn those experiences into a strength, which is pretty massive.
870.40s: I have to say, so I have to ask obviously a little bit about your career in the UFC. I've always been a hobbyist trainer. I started back when I was in college for similar reasons is you.
884.50s: And I've I've always enjoyed it a ton. I actually had a chance. I don't know. I'm in San Diego. So we have victory MMA out here who has like Dean Lister, who runs their crap, playing department, which is super cool.
899.00s: Yeah. Yeah.
902.20s: But yeah, so you make this pivot into the UFC, talk to me about your UFC career, what that's like.
912.20s: So we could talk about that for hours, but I'll just can dance it into like a small thing. So so my first initiation into the UFC is I'm very good at what I do. I'm a very good fighter.
925.10s: I'm very skilled. I train extremely hard. And so so the fighting part was never the aspect that I had trouble with.
932.70s: So I did really well. I'm I probably won. I don't remember the exact but I think I won five in a row, which is very rare. And then I had a draw and then
941.90s: essentially I got fired because I wasn't all that exciting. And when they put the camera in front of my face, I was very nervous.
949.90s: So I had all the fighting skills, but I didn't have the presentation skills that are required to be an entertainer. And so
959.40s: So really what held me back in my fight career has very little to do with my talent as a fighter. It was the business side that held me back.
967.70s: And I was able to do quite well. You know, I eventually I was ranked in the top five in the world. And I had a fight with Chad Mendez, you know, if I would have beat him, it was a very close fight.
976.60s: But if I had if I would have beat him, which I didn't, but you know that I'm one fight away from a title shot, you know, but that was as far as I got. And so, but I made a long career. I had I have almost 30 UFC fights is a very rare career to have that many fights.
991.70s: And I did I did well for myself, but the fighting process involves so much more than just being good at fighting.
1001.60s: And when I was younger, I didn't have the skills to interview well. I didn't have the skills because I mean, I come from it. You know, it's it's it's it's funny to me and I don't feel bad for myself, but I come from like a bad shit and saying life.
1015.60s: You know what I mean? Like it's like like I went through a lot of things. And when someone puts a camera in your face and you're like, well, what do you think about this is like, you know, like, you don't really want to know what I think about this. You know what I mean?
1027.60s: Like like like I don't I'm just trying to survive. You know, I got dealt a bad hand. I'm just trying to survive. So this is a way for me to make money and try my best and and stuff like that. So my entire life, I have been very good at the process.
1045.40s: I've been very disciplined. I've been very good at the actual arts, but the business side of life is a little difficult for me. I'm not as personable as some people. I have a hard time with first.
1055.40s: Um, like if I have a reason like here, I have a reason to talk to you. Like like I can be quite open. I can be good at the at an interview. But if we were to just meet outside, randomly, I'm terrible at that. You'd be like, that's just weird.
1071.00s: It's like like like like if I were just at a bar and like it was like me and my wife and you and you're significant on the other half. Like and we're just sitting there. You'd be like, that guy's not social at all. You know what I mean? Like he's hard. He's hard to talk to.
1082.40s: So I that first impression in the fight game was not good. And that sort of held me back a long time. And it and it frustrated me. And it actually I actually lost some fights because of the business side frustrated me so much that it affected my training and it affected my stuff like that. But, but the fighting skills itself. I've always been an exceptionally good fighter.
1103.40s: But mixing those two realms was difficult for me until the end when I got much better at it.
1110.80s: It makes a ton of sense. It's one of those things where I guess like when a kid originally finds out that something like wrestling it or like you know like WWE wrestling and you realize that that kind of like skits right and it's fake. That's super crushing.
1126.00s: I found a similar experience when like you realize a big part of fighting is obviously being a fantastic fighter. But you have to be able to sell fights. And I always really respected mighty mouse.
1139.00s: And I read a lot about his career and he I feel like is another really good example where he was in the UFC and it seemed almost like they were not fully respecting what he had done.
1152.00s: And yeah, and so it's it's a bummer right because part of it is like you really just want to see who's the just just the best right like get rid of.
1161.00s: Yeah, I mean, I mean it's a it's it's it's it's a bummer in a way, but it's a business right you have to sell the product and and I and I'm not bitter about it right like at some points I didn't sell the product.
1176.00s: And so there but there were many situations in my fight career where it's like oh because a lot of fighting is about matchups it like like like the top one guy now might lose to the top 10, you know what I mean just because they don't match up well he might the top 10 might smash him, but he will never get there.
1195.00s: So he that so like but in and the top one can smash two three four five six and make everyone look stupid, but those last four would smash him so it's a lot about matchups and it was very difficult for me to find the right matchups at the right time because it's like it was a very dangerous game because they're like if we put him versus Nick, Nick might win and we don't want that to happen.
1219.00s: Constantly we had this like stream of really hard fights, but when I would win them, they didn't get me the credit that I needed, you know, and so this I'm not complaining because I didn't come equipped to beat a superstar I just don't have the skills to be a superstar, but I am a very good fighter so I some ways I underperformed in that way.
1239.00s: Right yeah, I mean well obviously it's also an incredible perspective that you take on it because it honestly reminds me of trading where traders I find in general they like to find something to blame the market did this to me the market maker who by the way doesn't care at all about you did this.
1257.00s: So you obviously have a very just removed perspective of it's very objective you're saying i'm good at this part this part I needed to work on and the fact that you can even reconcile those two like that to me would lend really well into something like trading so as you're going through your UFC career when did you start trading and how did that come into the picture.
1281.00s: So when I was young things like investing saving these are not things that poor people think about you know what I mean so it's like it's it's not something that was a part of my life so it's something I do nothing about you know I didn't know anything about stock market I didn't even know existed and so as I was getting older and I was never rich but I was starting to pile up some money and I need to do something with it right.
1307.00s: And then that was right in the time when after the financial crisis so the gfc happened right when I got into the UFC and so like it's like I have a little money I see everyone else's money evaporating in the market like I don't want to put it there you know I mean god I would be loaded if I just threw it all in you know.
1328.00s: Perfect timing.
1331.00s: But but but but instead I instilled fear in me because I saw so many people losing their money and I seem to be the only guy with some money and so then I thought about like well I could invest in this and that but there was something one of the things I struggle with in fighting is I'm so obsessive and I train so hard that I over train I overwork so I need I always needed some distraction.
1357.00s: In my life and so what would fill that distraction sometimes is I would be like competitive in a video game or something you know like I play starcraft and I became like very good at starcraft like I became a grandmaster player in starcraft and it's like it's like I'm like.
1373.00s: Ranked 100 on this ladder like I'm pretty good but then like one day I was just sitting there you know playing starcraft for like.
1380.00s: Five six hours straight and I'm like what is this getting me like it's getting me nothing like like I mean it keeps me from training which is good because I over train I get injured I get sick by like I don't.
1393.00s: I don't want to play this freaking game anymore you know what I mean like I want to do something that matters and then I just sort of thought like what what game can I play that could that could make me money or or could be beneficial to my family.
1407.00s: And so first I thought poker black jack things like this and so I tried it and I you know I started like a poker stars account and I did really well I did really well like like I was pretty good at poker and then I was like no this isn't it it's just not it and then I started to think about the stock market and then I was like.
1425.00s: I need to understand this because I do nothing about the stock market and so like I literally put out like a study schedule for like a year and I dedicated pretty much eight hours a day every day for a year to studying stocks to studying how markets work to studying bonds and at first I was just a complete idiot you know what I mean I would like I remember very clearly I read these books and they were talking about investing and they're talking about like that you got to have this much of your portfolio.
1455.00s: I'm trying to do the math and I'm like this makes no sense you can't make seven percent here and then have this bond that pays nothing and get to 15% and I'm like I'm like sitting there like screaming at the books like this makes no sense not realizing they're just old and they're not you know we're not in the Zerp atmosphere so so it took a while but after I did that for about a year I decided to start a trading account and thankfully when I started trading.
1484.00s: I did really well I did really well and so like I kind of got hooked in it and I started studying more and more and more and more and it just it just led to like a lifelong passion of a game I can play that can actually do something valuable in my life.
1502.00s: Yeah that's absolutely awesome it's it's reminiscent I think for a lot of us but your angle on it is actually quite unique in the sense of the original intent which was to find something you could kind of pour some of that obsessive personality into to save some of your other craft that you are working on at the time that's very interesting because like you and like a lot of traders I know I also have a highly obsessive person.
1533.00s: Except I was introduced to the markets funny when you were talking about like poor people aren't really thinking about investing or trading because I didn't know what it was
1542.56s: and I had a high school teacher that's saw that I was working a lot and he was just like what are you doing with your money as I go I'm saving it it's all I know what to do and he introduced me
1551.14s: to the stock market he was like you should learn about investing go to the library long story short that dude changed my life because he introduced me to something I
1560.04s: didn't know about early enough that it made a massive impact on the rest of the trajectory
1565.24s: of my life. Now, you came into it not so much looking at it directly from the perspective
1573.96s: of I need to make a lot of money doing this. Obviously, that's part of it, but it sounded like
1579.88s: a big part of it also was I need another way to direct some of this energy away from this other
1586.68s: thing I'm highly obsessive about, which leads me to my follow on question. How did you find
1592.52s: symbiosis between the two? Because at least for me, I become slightly myopic when I'm in like my
1599.40s: obsessive modes and I can't really function in other things other than that thing I'm obsessed on,
1605.64s: but you're doing like two very skilled things simultaneously. How did you find a balance there?
1611.24s: I don't know how to describe it, but it's like they both feel the same purpose, right? It's like
1624.04s: it's like when it makes sound weird, but the work, the study, it calms me down. It doesn't make me
1633.08s: stressed, you know what I mean? And as an athlete, it's one of the rare situations like my brain can
1639.56s: go forever. I have like a very like I can think I can process things very quickly for a long time.
1645.16s: I'm not going to get tired that way, but my body can't compete with that level of thing. So with
1650.76s: the fighting, you can only work out hard three or four hours a day. That's it. That's max. Now I
1658.52s: would work two three three two up workout two or three times a day. And then like you have a warm
1664.12s: up, you then you train hard, then you have a cool down, then you got to die, you got to go eat,
1668.68s: you know, it's a 24 hour job, but that ability to be distracted in a way that's positive.
1676.28s: There are lots of ways to get distracted as a fighter, right? Women, drugs,
1681.32s: partying, eating, all these things you cannot do because it'll it'll suck the life out of you,
1687.32s: right? So I needed to stay engaged. And that's why I would go to the video games, but then that
1693.08s: that stopped producing the effort, right? Like then that it became like boring to me. It wasn't
1697.88s: challenging enough. It didn't and it didn't get me anything. And so the market just it just sort
1703.32s: of provided that that right thing for me. And and and I think I don't look at it as a negative,
1715.96s: right? But obviously I dealt with a lot of stuff in my past. So initially, the thought process
1723.88s: of staying busy is to stop myself from thinking about that, you know, to like stay ahead of
1730.52s: the demons that I'm running from, right? Like I don't feel good about myself when I think about
1735.80s: that. So what do I do? I get obsessed about the work. And I've been able through the years
1742.36s: to to drop off the bad feelings. I'm not running anymore. I enjoy it. But the initially when it started,
1749.40s: it was me running from my past. It was me running from the things I don't want to think about.
1754.92s: I don't want to feel insecure. I'm good at fighting. So that makes me feel good about myself.
1759.96s: I don't want to think about finances because I grew up so poor. I don't want to be scared about
1764.44s: losing it. So if I keep winning fights, I don't have to be scared about money. So like like there was
1769.80s: all the that's initially how it started. But I've been able to just eliminate the bad parts
1775.00s: that keep the good parts as I've gotten older and why. I see. Yeah. And the sound of like you
1781.88s: found like a really good balance between both of those crafts, which is really impressive. I think
1788.44s: that that's kind of difficult to do. So walk me through a little bit then of your trading career.
1794.76s: When what year did you start trading and what kind of things were you trying in the beginning?
1801.24s: Well, initially, I just started investing and stuff, just trading some index funds and stuff.
1807.88s: Because that's what the book still made it do. But then one day I was just sitting there and I was like,
1812.52s: I want to be a trader. I want to be like a hacker version of a trader. Those two things always
1818.04s: appealed to me like that. Kind of like a computer wizard hacker type thing and like a date trader.
1823.56s: Like those two things were appealing to me. So that's what I'm going to do. And so I studied how to do it.
1828.84s: And I mix up the years sometimes. But I believe that where we had the big Christmas Eve crash
1837.00s: was 2017 going into 18. I might have that backwards or something, but I believe that's what it was.
1842.76s: Because we kind of were in a bear market. And then we crashed in Christmas Eve. And I bought
1849.32s: everything I could. I put my entire net worth in right as January started into the market for trading.
1857.64s: And the market did not go down for months. It went straight up. And so it was like
1863.80s: holy crap. Like I'm good at this thing. And I'm not good. I just got lucky, right? I'm not good at all.
1869.32s: Like I'm terrible. I have no idea what I'm doing. And so then it was stocks.
1874.36s: So I started trading stocks and I did quite well. But I wanted to like learn about how the world works.
1882.76s: And stocks are terrible. Some people disagree with me on this. But I think stocks are
1888.52s: horrible macro assets. They don't respond well to macro events. It's not a macro asset. A bond is
1895.56s: a macro asset. A currency is a macro asset. The sulfur curve is a macro asset. These things adjust
1901.80s: and they make sense when you understand how the world works. Stocks are in their own world all the time.
1908.04s: It's a different type of trading. And so I didn't feel like I had as much of an edge in picking stocks
1915.40s: after I picked the good ones. Right? It's like it's like, oh, I picked some good stocks. What am I going to do?
1920.76s: Sell it and buy. There's no other good ones. I got the good ones. And I'm doing well. But to really
1926.28s: increase the alpha, the really to increase the chance at higher returns, I needed to go to other
1932.84s: markets. And so I dissected and I started learning about what it doesn't exist anymore. I started
1939.88s: learning about Euro dollars. I started learning about the volatility spreads. I started learning about
1947.80s: when it turned to sulfur, sulfur curves. And then I started learning about how to trade bonds.
1952.04s: And once I got those things together, I was able to use sort of this puzzle mindset that I have
1959.80s: to really piece together a better trading system than just trading stocks. Whereas stocks are very
1965.96s: momentum driven. Right? They usually go up together. They usually go down together. You can pick
1970.76s: the right ones. You know, you can kind of adjust it. But just to trade stocks is a very, very difficult
1975.88s: thing to do. It is very difficult to beat S&P if you're just trading stocks. Because S&P is essentially
1982.44s: built as a trend following system. So if you're not in the video this year, you're screwed. Right? I
1987.96s: don't own the video. And I'm doing better than SPX this year. Right? Because I just am not involved.
1994.52s: I just chose not to be involved. And then I don't suffer from the the the the formal. I don't suffer
2002.44s: from the frustration of missing a stock. I have a lot of ways to bet on the thing. And then when I see
2008.84s: value in stocks, I put it in my long term funds. So I love looking at I love breaking down stocks.
2015.88s: I love breaking down finance sheets. I love to find those hidden gems in the stock market.
2020.92s: But that's a whole different game. And that's an investing game. And I don't think trading.
2025.80s: I don't think those two line up as well. At least not from my personality. So that's the that's how I got there.
2031.72s: Yeah. Well, it makes a ton of sense. And I think a couple of things really stick out that thing you
2036.20s: said actually at the very end about personality. I think that's actually a really huge function of
2043.24s: creating success in markets is finding things that do align with your personality, which takes
2048.20s: some time because I've had a really interesting view of my trading career. Because I started back when
2054.44s: I was in high school when I was in two is 2007. And I've seen even from all my documentation on what I
2061.96s: do, how much it's evolved as I change and as my disposition is just a man changes. So I think
2070.04s: that's a really important point that you shared there about finding things that align with your
2074.12s: disposition. So you were talking about a little bit of the evolution of how you tried different things.
2083.32s: How did you start realizing that you were finding the thing that you liked, the thing that did
2089.88s: align with your disposition? Well, there's two things, right? One, you make money. If you make money,
2097.96s: it seems to make everything feel better, right? And so that you're making money. It's hard to be
2102.76s: upset about it. And two, when I'm in the right trade or I have like a really idea with like a
2113.00s: fundamental backdrop and then a technical backdrop and then I do a lot of quantitative measures when
2117.72s: those three things come together and I put that trade on, I know very well I could lose this trade.
2125.64s: But I don't care. You know what I mean? Like I don't care. Like I really, I'm not stressed about it.
2130.92s: If it stops me out, it stops me out. I'm not stressed about it. It's the trades where you do care
2135.40s: about losing that money that you know you're not really in the good one. You know what I mean? And
2139.00s: I was finding a lot of times with stocks. That's how it was. I was good at trading stocks. I was good
2144.44s: at trading options on stocks. But I always had just this level of stress that like that it ate me
2152.36s: away and it made my performance worse. And so a lot. And especially with timing stocks,
2157.48s: when you're trying to time stocks on like with macro knowledge, you're trying to time stock a bit,
2162.44s: it can go very badly. And so I had like a stream where like I had a stream where I made relative to
2170.20s: my money. It's not a lot of money relative, but to me it was a lot of money. I made a lot of money.
2175.16s: And then I started to lose it. And I started to pick stocks and it's like a stock would just go
2181.24s: down for no reason. And I'd be like this makes no sense. And like one time at one point, I had 10
2187.00s: trades on. And the market was up. And all 10 of my things were down. I seemed to own the only 10 things
2194.20s: in the world that were going down that day. You know what I mean? And in a matter of weeks, I lost
2199.80s: so much money I couldn't believe it. Like and everything went up except what I owed. And then I
2206.20s: realized like even if you're great at this, that's going to happen to you. You know what I mean? It's
2211.56s: going to happen to you. And so it just that feeling went away when I felt like I found the right
2219.88s: markets. And if I go in and draw it out now, I'm not too worried about it because I feel like I do
2224.12s: have an edge and it's quantifiable. And I know that it exists. Whereas when I was trading just the
2229.80s: stocks itself, I route the luck wave seemed a lot more present. And so that's how I got into the
2238.28s: market said that I feel like good. As far as money goes, I made a lot of money with the stocks,
2243.80s: but the feeling just wasn't that good. And I felt like I could lose it. And I went through that
2250.44s: that short term stream where I made a ton of money. And then I lost you know 75% of it in a
2256.04s: couple of weeks. It was like holy crap. Like that's I mean, in the grand scheme of things, I made
2261.96s: 25% of our money. So I'm still doing pretty good. But like that losing that money hurt so bad that
2267.96s: like I was like I cannot trade like this. And so I had to find the better method. And then once I found
2272.84s: the method that I like now, if I win or lose money, it doesn't affect me as much.
2279.32s: I think the other important point you're talking about there, those the process of building something
2285.72s: you believe in. And I think a lot of traders that I talked to on on that kind of level, it's
2294.36s: honestly, it's uncanny listening to you talk and just how many parallels there are. And one of
2300.36s: the things that I want to draw out from what you were just talking about is this process of
2305.72s: kind of testing ideas and then finding things that you are comfortable with. Because
2310.52s: markets no matter what are going to experience what we would call path. They're path features.
2315.88s: And they will go through phases of exactly what you're experiencing. And if you don't have something
2321.72s: that you really believe in, it's so easy to say, this doesn't work. I need to switch to something else.
2326.76s: And then as soon as you switch, what you were doing before starts working and what you're doing now
2331.00s: goes through a bad path. And you go through this cycle that's pretty brutal. Now when you're going
2336.60s: through and building the things, obviously you're finding your way into the segments of the market,
2342.04s: the products that makes sense to you. How are you devising what you're doing in those products?
2348.28s: I obviously took a look over your ex Twitter, whatever bird or thing I'm supposed to call this
2354.20s: platform now, big daddy Elon has me super confused, a simple man. But it obviously is very clear that
2361.32s: you also like to tinker with different momentum style strategies. I saw one on there using different
2368.20s: moving average momentum style trades against the SP 500. So walk me through this process of how you
2375.00s: consider building your approach. Okay, so initially, anytime I found a market I wanted to know about,
2384.92s: I reached out to people that were exceptionally good at it on Twitter. So if I, when I wanted to
2391.32s: learn about your dollars and sulfur, I found all the best people at that. And I sent them DMs on
2397.08s: Twitter and I asked if they would teach me. And thankfully, through this process, and I have a good
2402.76s: end because I'm a professional fighter, people are willing to help me. And when they tell me,
2407.88s: hey, do these things and then get back to me. And I come back as an expert in everything they told
2412.76s: me about they're like, oh, crap, this guy's really serious. And he has the mind to do this. And so I've
2418.60s: been able to get four or five mentors that are exceptional. You know what I mean? They, these guys
2425.64s: are world class at what they do. And so I have that advantage that I have great teachers. And so
2433.88s: that's, that's number one, you have to find good mentors in life. You have to find them. And if you
2438.84s: don't, you know, it's going to be more difficult for you. Then the approach, like you said, I do,
2446.12s: I do a mixture of quantitative analysis and like you said, trend following, right? So a lot of it
2451.96s: is price based. I do a lot of, I have a lot of quantitative models that track a variety of spreads.
2459.88s: So like asset spreads versus each other, stock spreads versus each other, you know,
2464.60s: if not in very simple terms, you could use something like ES versus small caps, right? And you
2471.48s: can, you can chart that. You can see which ones are outperforming. Well, I do that on a very more
2476.52s: complex level, but I use that as to create the backdrop. I have like a quantitative scoring system
2485.40s: that tells me which assets should be outperforming during certain times. And then I only trade those
2494.12s: assets if I have a backup. So I use seasonality. I use, like I said, price action. I use trend following.
2503.32s: And if the quantitative and the technicals mix, now I will trade that asset for that period of time.
2511.64s: And now I'm looking in a shorter time frame to trade those markets. And so that's that's that's
2517.56s: really how I, how I've been able to build that process, right? So I have the quantitative part,
2524.20s: which is much more complex than anything I could look at personally. I get the computer to do it.
2529.56s: And then I have the technical analysis aspect more of a trend following system that I built.
2535.32s: It uses a lot of different things, moving averages, fractal measurements of time and stuff like that.
2541.00s: But in its most basic sense, it's a trend following. So when those, when everything aligns together,
2547.88s: then I will trade that asset. And I feel like the wind is at my back. And so if I have a macro reason
2553.80s: then to enter the trade. So that's the most discretionary idea, like, like, oh, I think this currency
2560.68s: will up because of an election, right? Maybe you might be right, right? But if I have the other
2566.84s: backdrops, I have it at my back. And then I'm able to to actually come up with trade things.
2573.56s: And when I come up with a trade idea, if it has the quantitative measurements behind me,
2580.04s: then I take the trade. And so that's sort of like how my system works.
2584.20s: Got it. Yeah. I kind of refer to that general ideas. I call it stacking strength,
2589.40s: which is exactly your kind of referent to it as like the wind at your back. I think that that's
2592.92s: such a great point. Are you trading? It looks like from your, again, flying bird page X,
2602.92s: it looks like mostly futures. Is that primarily the products you're trading?
2607.24s: Yeah, I try it. Well, I trade futures. And then I trade the options on either the ETF equivalent.
2617.80s: Like, so if the option market is liquid in the ETF equivalent, depending on which one I feel
2625.24s: is the better. So with the futures, it's like, obviously, you're leveraged. So if I plan on holding
2633.08s: something longer, I might look for an ETF alternative. That way, I'm not fearing, you know,
2637.80s: like that I'm going to get blasted out for some being over leveraged. But in general, I trade
2643.40s: the futures. I like the futures products. I started with options. I used to think that was better
2648.60s: because it's easier to just, if you want to bet $500 in an option, you don't need to stop, right?
2653.64s: You bet the 500. And then you're good at either works or it doesn't. Whereas with futures,
2658.04s: you have to be very technical. You have to pick the stop. You have to pick when you're wrong. You're
2661.72s: going to be wrong more often. But when you get better at trading futures, it's like, you have more
2669.32s: control, I feel like, over the ending process. And you don't have the drag of optionality of
2674.68s: data and all that other kind of stuff. So I really like the futures markets. And I pretty much
2681.72s: just trade those and I spread trade them against each other. Yeah, I figured I picked up. That
2687.00s: was actually going to be the following question is for the pairs trading. But yeah, I could kind of tell
2690.76s: based on what you're saying that you're using spreads. And yeah, I think the other beautiful part
2695.32s: about futures is really it simplifies things, right? It's a Delta one product. It still has an
2699.00s: expiration. You're still going to deal with contango. So there's still will be drag holding super
2703.32s: long term. But it does simplify a lot of what's going on as compared to options. I'm primarily a
2709.56s: derivative trader. So I trade options in futures. I've done that essentially my entire career.
2715.24s: But futures that there's a specific beauty to them in that. Plus, I mean, a lot of them are
2720.76s: tax advantaged, which is also pretty sick. You get section 1256. So 60 40 long term short term
2727.00s: capital gains tax, which is pretty dope. You were talking about though about the periods of your
2733.32s: trading. So you are spread trading, which makes a lot of sense, especially using futures.
2738.84s: What are the typical timeframes that you're looking at for your positions?
2745.08s: So it's either I trade two timeframes essentially, right? I trade one to three weeks
2755.80s: essentially. And I trade three months to six months essentially. So those are like the two time
2762.84s: frames that I like. The middle ground, I'm not so good at, you know, 45 days stuff like that.
2767.88s: I feel I have a very hard time with that. So if I can push it out six months, I'm pretty good.
2773.16s: Because sometimes I'm early, like I'm always like I have good ideas, but I can be early.
2778.12s: And then on the shorter timeframes, if I'm going to use options, if I'm going to do like,
2782.76s: if I'm in a trading option, I'm looking at 30 days, 30 to 40 days out. And then but I'm looking
2788.04s: for it to pop within a week or two, you know, in a mean like and then get out. And so that's
2793.32s: that's really the time frame. Sort of that five days, you know, if it happens in three, great.
2798.20s: But sort of that five to 10 trading days is the short term. Maybe that can change to 15 if I'm
2804.20s: going to roll or I'm going to have some future or something. And then I cut it off completely
2808.92s: until we get over three months after that. Got it. And I mean, even that makes a ton of
2815.00s: sense just in terms of assessing correlations. Once you get into those middle grounds, which
2819.56s: obviously from your research, you already know this, but for everybody else listening,
2823.88s: almost perfectly with the time frames that you've selected, those midterm periods,
2829.00s: the correlations can behave very strange in there for various products. So you're kind of trading
2834.28s: more persistent correlation and then short term, which is, yeah, that's awesome. I love that.
2841.48s: Now, when you're looking at the way you manage your book, are you, do you have a preference for
2848.04s: the shorter term or kind of like your longer range time frames? Like, how do you split what you're
2852.92s: doing between those two buckets? I just have separate accounts for it. So it's like, and I do
2859.08s: the measurements every day and whatever is hitting at the time I go for it. So you know, the markets are,
2864.60s: they seem to go in patterns, right? Sometimes people are thinking longer terms. Sometimes they're
2868.84s: they're very hypersensitive. In the high ball times, I'm going to be obviously on a shorter time
2873.72s: frame. I don't need as much length to get the juice that's required to make money. And so I'm
2878.68s: going to be shorter time frame. And then really it just has to do with the trade selection and the
2883.88s: product. You know what I mean? Like, like, let's say I want to short the, I want to short USJPY
2891.24s: right now, right? Because I think intervention risk is high. I think seasonality is in the right
2895.64s: time frame. Like, I have a very small starter position in that short JPY, right? Like,
2901.40s: the idea that I'm going to be able to time that to a week basis while everyone has been getting
2907.72s: stopped out for years at this point, you know, trying to do the straight, right? Like the idea that
2913.00s: I've got to just walk in and, you know, nail it within five days. Probably, probably, probably,
2919.64s: probably, probably, right? I'm going to be there with the number one carry trade in the world blows
2924.44s: up in the week. It happens, you know, minimal, minimal chance, right? So, so, so I'm going to have
2930.52s: to extend that trade. I like the trade, but I gave my, you know, I'm going to have, I have one
2935.08s: position that expires in August and then I have another one that's going to go, you know, as we go
2939.64s: into like, you know, kind of November type rage is what I'm thinking about, right? So, it's like,
2944.60s: it's like the August one, it's like, I'm hoping they interview, but it's a small position and if
2949.96s: they don't, and if it doesn't crash, well, then I lose and it's fine, you know, it's a small
2953.96s: amount of money. It makes sense as far as the risk reward. And I'm willing to take it. But
2959.16s: really, the trade itself is what decides the link, right? And so, so whatever I'm looking at, I,
2965.72s: I just, if it fits in one of those two timeframes, I take it, I don't have a preference as to one
2969.88s: or the other. The only thing I have a preference for is if I'm going to buy a stock, like, I want
2975.80s: that to be years that I'm going to hold it. Like, if I'm going to go for individual stocks, I want,
2981.08s: it needs to have, you know, the PE needs to be right, the cash flow needs to be right. I need to have
2987.08s: some kind of reason to own this thing. I'm not trying to trade it because I don't have an edge in
2993.56s: that market. And so, like, I'm really looking to invest in that and that's going to go into a long
2998.04s: term account, you know, that's going to go on my child's college fund. That's going to go on that
3001.72s: thing. And I actually am very good at those things, but those trades don't come along that often.
3006.52s: And so, like, if every day you're looking for those trades, you're going to over trade. And so,
3010.76s: the macro products give me the, the ability to like really be in the markets every day.
3016.36s: Yeah. Yeah. Into your point, there's, there's a lot of movement in them as well in terms of
3022.04s: the relationships and kind of what's hitting what's not. So that, that makes a lot of sense.
3027.48s: When you look at, let's say last year, last year's a kind of a, well, maybe two years ago,
3033.64s: it would be a better example. When you look at the performance of your approach and you kind of
3039.88s: compare it over like 2022 and 2023, when you think about your general approach, how does it
3050.92s: fare in those two different markets? And for everybody listening, the reason I'm asking those
3055.08s: two years specifically is 22. It was a, well, almost a bear market, I guess technically it hit
3059.80s: trial, but the market landed down like 19 and a half ish. And then 23, it was up almost 24.
3067.80s: So what I'm curious about is if you are completely non correlated to S&Ps or if you have kind of a
3077.64s: lead lag relationship with them depending on how S&Ps perform. Okay. So, I hope I don't get lost in
3085.08s: the next kind of explaining my thought process here, but in general, my goal is to be uncorrelated to
3092.20s: S&P 500, right? I have an allocation to S&P stocks, but I want to be uncorrelated. And you can like
3099.32s: them or dislike them or think he made it or not. But you know, there's that radaliotive sense that
3104.36s: the holy grail of trading is to have essentially 10 to 15 uncorrelated assets streams. And then
3113.96s: pretty much if you can do that, that's the trick to investing because you're, they're not related.
3120.36s: It's very difficult to do that. It's almost impossible. I mean, maybe renaissance has done it,
3125.08s: but that's about it. And when it comes to like, that's the goal. The goal is to have uncorrelated
3130.68s: assets streams that you can trade that are not related to each other. And then you can look for
3134.76s: the proper trades because one's not going to screw the other one. And so that's really, that's
3140.04s: always what I'm looking for. I'm looking for uncorrelated assets. Now, do I find that? And he knows,
3145.32s: it's very difficult and they change all the time. You know, I mean, you can have a certain asset
3149.56s: and at least ship that's worked for years that it just falls apart. You know, the most basic one
3153.96s: is the stock bond comparison comparison, right? That has totally shifted from what it used to be.
3160.84s: Now they're court laid. Right? If you look at gold and tips, they're 70% correlated right now.
3168.20s: That makes zero sense. There's no reason that real yields and gold should be, you know, performing
3173.64s: at the same thing. It doesn't make any sense. Right? You have one that's a negative yielding asset.
3178.52s: You have one that's paying you to own it. Those things should not be the same price. But they are.
3185.00s: So you can either fade that or go with it. But I'm looking for those asset streams to put into a model
3192.36s: that can tell me when's a good time to own it and when not. And then I can figure out trades
3197.16s: with that idea. So the entire idea of everything I do is to find uncorrelated assets streams.
3204.60s: It's just an incredibly difficult process to do. And so do I have I succeeded? Yeah, I have succeeded.
3210.92s: But what I'm certainly far from mastering the art. Sure. And to your point, it's something that
3219.64s: kind of continually shifts anyway. So I think the way that you talk about it really,
3227.08s: it sums it up really well because I also like to pay our trade. It's kind of a slower. I use it
3234.84s: almost as like a smoothing function of portfolio returns. And sometimes it's not so smoothing
3241.96s: because of that exact thing because I'll have things that get blown out that I just don't expect to.
3247.40s: And it's just kind of like, okay, sick. Love that for me. Yeah. Yeah. I know that we're coming up
3254.20s: on time here. But I have a couple last questions for you. One of them is when you look across
3262.36s: your evolution as a trader from where you started to kind of where you're at now. The very first
3267.56s: question I want to ask with respect to that is where do you want to go next? Where do you think your
3273.16s: next stage of evolution is? So the goal is going to sound rather ridiculous. But this is always how
3283.24s: involved, how I thought about things. When I started wrestling, I started very late. It's very rare
3291.16s: for someone in Minnesota to start wrestling in high school. It's almost unheard of. And especially
3295.24s: for them to do good. But when I walked in the wrestling room for high school, I remember very clearly
3301.80s: telling those guys, they said, I will be the best wrestler in Minnesota. And they laughed at me.
3308.36s: Like, I, you know what I mean? They totally laughed me out of the room. And I went into,
3312.76s: and then I proceeded to get my ass kicked by everyone in that room that day. Right? So they
3318.36s: can prove the point that I don't belong there. Well, when I finished, I was the best wrestler in
3323.80s: Minnesota. I was. And when I started fighting, they said, you can't drop out of school and start
3329.56s: fighting and make a career under this. Well, I did very well. Right? And with trading, I,
3336.20s: in, and investing, I feel like it's the same thing. And so I, in 10 years, I think I will be
3344.04s: one of the best at this. I will be up there. I will understand markets on a level that very few
3349.96s: people do. I feel like I will be successful. I don't know where that path will take me.
3354.68s: Will it take me into an analyst path? Will it take me into a hedge fund path? Will it, well, I just
3359.00s: be trading my own money. I have no idea. But every year I have, I have exponentially gotten better.
3366.92s: I have gotten much better. And so the end goal is to be one of the best. I plan on being one of the
3372.36s: best. I have the capability of doing it. I have the support structure. I have the, the, the, the
3378.12s: backdrop to do it. It's just can I do it? Can I fail? I failed plenty of times in my life.
3384.36s: The, the, the failures and real option. And in fighting, as I learned, just being a good fighter
3391.08s: wasn't enough, right? A lot of the time. So the business side could be more difficult than I'm
3396.44s: expecting. But I really do feel like in 10 years, I will be one of the better traders in the world.
3403.00s: When you think about the idea of being a better trader, what does that mean to you? Is that the
3409.08s: highest percent returns? Is that the best risk returns? I have many theories on this. You
3416.76s: know, you could talk about this stuff all day. You know, like what, what is alpha? What, what,
3422.60s: are you just doing leverage beta? Is it actually alpha? Are you, if you make 100% like are the
3429.80s: risks adjusted returns? Like are they, you know, and at the end of the day, I think trading is
3434.84s: about making money and money is the scoreboard. And so if, who, who, if I can have an exceptional life
3442.44s: and, and obviously everything I do is to, to reduce risk, right? I don't want the risk. And it drags
3449.32s: on the, the, the portfolio returns. Obviously, if you have less risk, you're going to make less money.
3455.72s: But I don't want to blow up either. I have children. I have a family, right? So, so what makes it the
3461.96s: best? It's, it's, it's an unquantifiable thing, right? For me, what will make me the best is I can
3469.40s: come in here every day and I can take care of my family off of it. I can, I can, we can have an
3475.16s: exceptionally good life. And I don't have to worry about money. If we want to go to fancy restaurant,
3479.96s: we can do it. If I want to do this, I can do it. If I want to do the things that are required of
3484.04s: life, I can do it. And so if I'm able to turn the amount of money I have in now into that,
3490.36s: I will be an exceptionally good trader. So, I mean, that will be the scoreboard. Well, do I want to go
3495.88s: down in history and other people knowing that I'm one of the best traders? I could care less.
3501.08s: I can care less if a person has no idea who I am for the rest of my life. I, I, I did that.
3507.32s: I was in that realm. And if I could fight in people's basements and rich people would pay me to
3512.60s: fight and pits like in best of the best or something, I would have done that over anything, right? I
3517.96s: that the fame or, or, or, or press of trading doesn't appeal to me. The idea that I can take me
3526.44s: and the background I come from and I could sit in front of a computer and I can make money.
3531.16s: That's very appealing to me. And I feel like the knowledge and the wisdom that I will acquire in
3537.48s: that 10 year period will be noticeable and I will be able to judge myself based on where I am in
3543.64s: that scale. Yeah, I think it makes it some of sense. And the reason why I ask that question is because
3549.64s: you, you hit on an important point. I actually argue more often than not that like what quantify
3555.24s: success as a trader really is defined by the trader. I really do believe that. And it's because
3563.32s: there are different objectives and different ways to approach the game to hit those different
3568.76s: objectives. And you know, one of my primary goals, I had like very specific timelines and targets
3576.12s: for things because I knew that I was going to be my mom's retirement. So by the time I was in my
3581.48s: late 20s, I needed to be at a spot where I knew I could start taking care of her. And that was a
3588.36s: big part of my trajectory. So you defining it for yourself, I honestly think is literally the
3594.60s: the pristine answer. The second question I had for you to wrap up with is looking back over your
3603.00s: entire learning process so far, if you were to give yourself a piece of advice starting over again,
3610.60s: what piece of advice would you give yourself? The timeframe, the timeframe of what is possible
3624.92s: in the short term is much smaller than you give it credit for. So you come in with dreams of
3631.48s: making so much money, you come in with dreams of making like I'm going to make 10% a month or
3637.00s: something. And you never really think about the idea that you would own all the money in the world
3641.48s: if you could just do that. You'd be the rich, you could just compound 10% every fucking week.
3648.76s: It's not realistic, right? So on the shorter timeframe, relax. But on the larger timeframe,
3656.92s: when we're talking years, you don't understand what's possible if you just keep the momentum going.
3663.88s: And so at the beginning of my thing, my my my career was like this, whoa, and then I was like this,
3669.16s: and then it was like this, and then it was like this, and then all of a sudden, like, your
3673.80s: couple years in, and you realize that it just kind of looked like that. You know what I mean? It kind
3678.04s: of just went like this, right? And if you just did that, you would have had a much easier life
3681.72s: if things would have been better, right? And so in the grand scale of life that compounding,
3686.36s: if you do the right things, it feels like a long time, but one day, two years, five years or not,
3692.28s: you wake up and if he did it all right, you have a shit ton of money and you have a and you have
3697.96s: a shit ton of freedom and everything just comes together. So I would tell myself, relax on the
3704.52s: shorter timeframe, don't be so stressed about making money now, but don't underestimate what's
3710.84s: possible because great things are possible if you do the right path. And so just keep on that trajectory.
3716.92s: I love that. I literally love that so much. I think that's one of the things actually on my
3724.12s: website that I try to build a visual for people to see that exact thing you're talking about.
3729.72s: The capacity of compounding returns and what that actually looks like as compared to highly volatile,
3734.52s: but very picky returns. So I mean, what a what a great message. I gotta say, man, like,
3741.80s: I absolutely love chatting with you. I love your disposition towards the world. You have obviously
3746.36s: a huge amount of experience to share with people. So first from me and my community, thank you so
3751.56s: much for coming to hang out for a while with us. Now, I'll obviously throw a link to your ex-page
3760.04s: in the video description. Is there anywhere else that you want to share with people if they want
3765.08s: to get a hold of you? Nope, that's it. Perfect. Well, I definitely would love to keep in touch see
3771.64s: that things are going for you. And yeah, man, it's so cool to hear your background. Add it to kind
3778.84s: of the archives I have of all these different trader archetypes, how they find their ways into markets.
3784.92s: It makes it one of the coolest places to be. So thank you for being a part of the community. And
3788.84s: thanks for hanging out, man. Much respect. God bless you guys. Awesome brother.
