0.00s: One of the coolest things about trading options,
2.48s: or even if you don't trade them,
3.80s: but options in general,
5.48s: is that they provide you probabilities for things,
8.12s: because options are probabilistic tools
12.32s: that all of the market uses and it creates a consensus
17.00s: of where we think things might go.
19.36s: So you can literally open up options chain,
22.28s: and some people will use Delta as an approximation
26.08s: for an option being in the money at expiration,
28.12s: it kind of works.
28.96s: So you can do that for really short term stuff
31.36s: less than like 20 days.
32.76s: But as soon as you get outside of a 20 day window,
34.96s: if you take a look at the actual calculation
37.00s: of an options probability of being in the money,
39.24s: versus Delta's, it differs a lot,
41.12s: especially the further out you go,
42.32s: just keep that in mind.
43.60s: But you can use options to say,
45.44s: well, I think a stock might be going to 105,
48.08s: but what's the probability?
50.20s: You can answer that with options.
53.12s: They're really cool, lots of things you can use them for,
55.28s: be an online, see you later.
