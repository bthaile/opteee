0.00s: GME, OpEx, and there wasn't a whole lot going on here except this really interesting
6.56s: number. We close today at 2497. Strange, a strange number I think, especially when you
15.00s: consider that maximum pain was 25. Hmm, weird. The topic of the video is actually going
24.02s: to be maximum pain because I want to level set on what it is, give everybody a quick overview
29.88s: and how it can impact options because for those that follow GME, this product is actually
36.88s: ripe for maximum pain and it's not just from manipulation, although that is very likely
43.84s: a component of it. So let's take a quick look at the options chains. We get a poor one
48.88s: out for the homies because there's over 300,000 options contracts that have expired out
54.56s: of the money worthless gone forever. Shout out to the homies. That value is gone. Now,
61.84s: what am I seeing? A couple of things. The first thing is volatility is cratering. This
65.60s: was above 200 than the high 100s and this is no joke. We are looking at something that
73.00s: has contracted meaningfully. This doesn't surprise me because it's been generally quiet
78.68s: and the market writ large has had a hard few days that's also weighing on GameStop.
84.68s: It's not just GameStop going down as of this moment. The entire market really in a broad
90.20s: sense is rotating over. You can kind of see this. If we take a look at net highs and lows
95.84s: down here, it just turned negative for the first time in a hot minute and the net lows
101.88s: gross lows. I'm sorry is expanding. So net highs is essentially zeroed out and gross
109.08s: highs is moved massively over the last couple days. Right now on the 19th at sitting at
115.24s: 55 yesterday was at 24 in the day before that at 361. It's crater. So this is a broad
124.20s: rotation that we're seeing where things are coming out of the top performing products
130.80s: and moving into some light to equity things. So things like Bitcoin are up, VIX is up.
137.36s: There's secular strength that you can find, but it's really, really isolated. UNG is up.
143.44s: Stuff like IHI medical devices was up. But right now if you scroll through the markets,
150.24s: the vast majority of this is just, yeah, it's coming down. So that weighs on something
157.60s: like GameStop, which is good to be aware of. So if we take a look now at this idea of Max
162.80s: Payne, let's talk about this. What is it? Well, in a nutshell, it's this right here. It's when
169.68s: there's an options expiration coming up, it's the market force where price tends to move towards
177.92s: the strike where the greatest value of options in that cycle would expire worthless.
184.96s: So there's a couple of assumptions that this has that market makers are the opposite side of
190.64s: these trades net sellers and they're hedging their positions. That's an important assumption and
195.20s: I agree with the assumption is broadly true. This also assumes that market makers then are incentivized
202.40s: to manipulate the stock such that this would happen. And that also is a viable estimation. Because
210.48s: when options expire in the money, a market maker has some work to do because into expiration,
218.40s: they need to hold the shares for what's going to expire in the money so that they can then deliver
224.96s: options that expire in the money and are exercised. That means that they have to hold shares.
230.08s: It increases their risk profile. They would much prefer options to expire worthless. So, yep,
235.60s: that also checks out. Now, there is a natural behaviour that is not just from manipulating stock,
243.20s: the stock price, but also from the natural practice of hedging that moves price a bit. And it's
250.64s: important to know that again, I think it's important to be as objective as possible. If we look at
255.60s: things and we just immediately say, yes, it's all completely rigged, there's nothing to be done here.
260.40s: It kind of loses some of its value if you dismiss everything in that way. Although, sometimes
264.80s: it can feel like that. And it's the same thing to the people that say, everything's price perfect,
268.80s: it's all great. There's nothing going on. That's also not so much true. It's kind of our job to be
273.76s: able to identify these gray areas. So, one of the things is their natural hedging behaviour can
279.44s: move price. Now, does that mean that they wouldn't be incentivized to move price or that they wouldn't?
285.84s: They are incentivized to move price. So, I don't actually view those two things as completely
291.20s: separate from one another. So, how do I identify Max Payne? Well, the cool thing is there are some
297.04s: websites that do this for you. Let me find one. This guy right here. I had a look around on all my
303.36s: screens, but there it is. So, this website called MaximumPain.com not affiliated with them in any way,
308.64s: but they do it for you. And they show you where MaximumPain is, where the highest OI strike is,
313.76s: where the highest put OI strike is, where the amounts are. And yeah, it is a pretty clean
320.08s: description of where you can find it. In something like this, think or swim, it also helps us with it,
325.12s: where you can look at the intrinsic value. So, if the options with the most intrinsic value are
332.00s: said to expire worthless, this where MaximumPain is, and you can see it's right where the bottom of
336.00s: this thing is. Right at this dip, which is 25. So, you can look at it for different series.
342.40s: It's going to pertain primarily to the front expiration cycle. Now, the other thing to keep in
347.36s: mind is it moves. MaximumPain is not a static figure. Why is that? Well, as people trade their
356.32s: contracts, this is naturally going to move around. So, an example of this is just from earlier this
363.44s: week. This is looking at GameStop on the 17th of July, right after the open. And I'm showing you
371.20s: where MaximumPain was then. It was like 29. Or 28. Looks like 29 to me. Something like that.
378.08s: So, this was just a couple days ago. So, what I'm highlighting to you is that the figure is not static.
383.20s: And if you're going to use the figure, you're best off really focusing on it on the day of expiration.
390.16s: That's where you'll kind of have the best idea on where this is. A couple other things to be aware of
397.28s: that this effect is most prominent in smaller, more liquid stocks. GameStop falls right into that
406.80s: bucket. It's because price is easier to manipulate in products like that. If you want to manipulate
411.84s: the price in something like Spy, it would take such a massive amount of money because it's such a
417.12s: big market. If you have a smaller market, it's much easier to move price. And again, to keep it
424.64s: objective, there's mixed evidence out there. I'm going to show you this study, which I really,
429.52s: really like. And this leans in the favor of asserting it exists and it's statistically significant,
436.96s: meaning it's something we should pay attention to. I like this study. I also agree with this study
441.52s: broadly. This study helps us become a little more nuanced in our understanding. Now, for those that
447.60s: are interested in learning more about Max Payne, I have a video that goes into the topic in depth.
452.00s: I'll link to that in the notes below. This is more designed to be kind of an overview
455.92s: to help us get familiar with the concept. But let me grab that study for us so that we can review
461.52s: it together. It's this one right here. And I highlighted some sections. This is just from the
465.60s: abstract. If you're not familiar with reading papers like this, it's really easy. You can go
470.24s: on to SSRN and grab them. And really, what you want to do is understand the strengths and
478.16s: limitations of the studies. None of them are perfect. They all use assumptions and things like that.
483.04s: But what I like to do is collude between different studies and kind of compare an aggregate
488.72s: output so that I have a good idea across studies, what seems to be the case. So you can say, see here
495.12s: that they say we construct a measure of maximum pain, gain loss. These sort stocks according to
500.64s: that. And they find that a spread portfolio that buys high Max Payne stocks and sells low Max Payne
507.28s: stocks generates large, positive and statistically significant returns in Alphas. That matters.
513.36s: So you can play Max Payne in two different directions. You can play prices, capacity to trend
518.80s: towards or away from it, depending on where it is relative to current price, which is actually
523.36s: pretty interesting. The other things that are important here. It says our results provide strong
529.44s: evidence of market return predictability at the expiration of options. And that they find the
534.64s: returns reverse after expiration week, also important. And that all consistent with stock manipulation
542.88s: on the part of market participants with short options positions. And the last piece here is
548.40s: especially strong for relatively small, a liquid stocks. So I highly, highly, highly recommend that
556.40s: you read through this become familiar with the concepts. You can look at the way that they calculate
561.52s: Max Payne so that you understand how to do it. You can throw it in Excel yourself. It's really
565.36s: not that difficult. It's a little bit annoying, not going to lie because you essentially have to go
570.48s: through and look at each of these individual strike prices and you have to multiply the strike price
577.52s: by the OI. That would tell you the intrinsic value at expiration. Now you can eyeball it. And you can
584.40s: do that by looking at where OI open interest is the greatest. And that'll give you a good starting
589.84s: point. But it's not perfect because say, for example, the 30s here that have 65,000, let's say that
597.60s: they had 72,000 OI. That would be the most open interest. That would be more than the 70,000 that's
605.04s: out here. But where would Max Payne be in that scenario? Do you know? Go down in the comments.
610.96s: I'll answer you now. If this was at 72,000, you would take 72,000 times 30. And then you would have
617.28s: to take 70,000 times 125. It's much greater out here. So even though this would have a larger OI,
624.56s: Max Payne is still out here. So it's relative. Now again, in general, you could go to where the
629.76s: highest ally is and narrow it down pretty quickly to the top three. And then reason through it pretty
636.24s: fast or you could do the math or you can check out some of these different platforms that really
641.04s: help us understand it inherently. But this to me looks like something weird happened. That's the
648.72s: best I can say about it. This looks too convenient from an expiration perspective for this thing to
655.84s: be kind of just dumped off very, very slowly into the close today. Does that mean that I'm full
662.16s: tinfoil hat saying that GameStop is perpetually always in forever manipulated? Probably to be honest
668.96s: because of the way that this thing moves. But jokes aside, I want to be clear though that it's
675.04s: product specific. There's a lot of nuance is what I'm trying to emphasize there. So make sure that
680.72s: you don't get too wrapped up in one thought process and you stay open to how individual things move.
687.20s: But GameStop is kind of kind of interesting to me to say the least. So I think that wraps up
696.32s: Max Payne writ large if you have any questions on it let me know if there's anything else you
699.60s: want me to take a look at let me know in the comments. And then I will see you on the live stream
703.92s: tomorrow with my boy Newton. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
