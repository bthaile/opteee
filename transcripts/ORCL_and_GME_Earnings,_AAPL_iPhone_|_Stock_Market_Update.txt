0.72s: what's up outliers happy Monday quick
2.80s: market update I got three things on the
5.40s: agenda for today I want to talk a little
8.16s: bit about Oracle earnings because as you
10.92s: could tell it looks really really good
13.52s: they closed today at $139.99 and they're
16.32s: trading at 152 and we'll talk about why
18.60s: that's important the next thing I want
20.32s: to talk about after that is the iPhone
22.72s: and Apple because well you know it's
25.76s: always nice to see us get pitched the
28.12s: same thing over and over again over year
30.44s: and then go buy it for sure so I want to
33.60s: take a look at that and then I want to
35.04s: take a look at GameStop because it has
37.16s: earnings coming up tomorrow so I want to
39.88s: see how we're positioning leading into
42.32s: earnings so what's going on with Oracle
44.72s: and why does this matter well to me I
47.16s: think this is really really important
49.08s: because we can see that it's reporting
52.48s: really really well we'll go through some
54.36s: of those metrics in just a minute but
56.52s: essentially for expectations this is the
59.52s: funny part about markets it was expected
62.12s: at a doll and a nickel and it came in at
65.84s: a139 so that's a really big EPS beat as
69.68s: we've seen with a lot of other tech
71.00s: companies but the market is rewarding
73.20s: them and a lot of what they're rewarding
76.08s: them for again as per usual are actually
79.84s: the way that we're forecasting out into
82.32s: the future and the potential growth
84.92s: opportunities for Oracle which look
87.24s: really really robust so
90.56s: I absolutely recommend taking a look we
92.76s: can take a look through the earning
94.64s: release a little bit later during the
96.08s: YouTube live session if we want but I
98.72s: took a cursory overview and I mean
100.44s: they're they're overall performing
102.68s: really really strong so they are opening
106.24s: this here that I think is really
107.64s: interesting that there's going to be a
109.52s: new partnership that they're launching
111.96s: with Google they really are seemingly
116.08s: being well received here so what this
118.72s: all means in my opinion is it's kind of
121.68s: a breath of fresh air especially after
123.76s: the last week that we had in the markets
126.96s: we saw Tech get a little bit of a bump
129.24s: today but not much we saw the S&P make a
131.76s: little bit better of a rally but still
133.36s: not much and same thing with small caps
135.56s: hanging near the lows here all up on the
138.60s: day but not massively vix came down
141.08s: closing at 1945 so the market is still
144.84s: in my opinion at a very tenuous phase we
147.60s: can see this standard deviation Channel
150.76s: as days drop off the back here and new
153.84s: days are added you can see that the the
156.52s: slope of this is actually gone from this
159.64s: about flat almost on a 3 month so what
162.08s: that tells us is that the near-term
163.48s: price action has been not great so if we
166.56s: don't start seeing spy rotating up and
169.68s: out from here it starts to look more and
171.80s: more like consolidation sideways action
173.72s: until there's some sort of big
175.32s: Catalyst and Tech just looks down from
178.36s: here even on this little tiny update day
180.44s: it was really well bought there was
182.20s: really strong buy volume but it's just
186.00s: not that significant just yet so I feel
189.56s: like the market is at a kind of
191.48s: important inflection point but seeing
194.04s: this come through from Oracle I think is
196.16s: kind of a good sign because we're seeing
198.04s: a company that reported really well for
199.64s: earnings and so far the market likes it
202.44s: which is solid next thing we have is
206.76s: Apple so if we take a look and it looks
211.04s: kind of the same how cool look at that
215.24s: got uh three little cameras how many
217.32s: does mine have I think I have the 15
218.80s: yeah looks about the same it does have a
221.48s: really cool function button apparently
223.68s: that's supposed to be a big deal I'm not
225.04s: going to pretend to be some sort of
227.64s: expert on all the Nuance differences
229.64s: between these I really spend very little
232.12s: time I actually have a buddy that's
234.08s: really interested in them so this is not
235.64s: like a tech gadget review going through
237.52s: the differences and stuff but yeah
240.44s: here's some of the differences for you
242.68s: the reason why I bring that up is just
244.44s: because apple is always at part of the
248.72s: conversation and we can see that it
252.24s: didn't move a lot and again this isn't
254.68s: necessarily a big shock to me feels like
257.28s: the market is kind of used to this
259.32s: annual renewal of things and unless it's
261.32s: a really really big upgrade it doesn't
263.92s: always lead to this big giant movement
266.76s: that's kind of what I see here now let's
270.20s: run over to
271.76s: GameStop and GameStop is starting to
276.04s: catch a bid here so we can see that it
278.48s: hit this kind of term low the low of
281.20s: this day was
283.52s: 1988 in here actually I guess I can
286.04s: delete this old one that's a little
288.32s: little aged as it were we can update it
292.20s: and it's been rallying up up since and
294.64s: right now it's at 2425 which again for
296.72s: GameStop that move might not seem huge
299.00s: but if you think about it that's or
301.72s: essentially like a five-point move a
303.72s: little less four-point move it's that's
305.72s: not insignificant for a product that's
307.76s: priced as Gamestop is so for the people
310.64s: that are out there trading movement
312.08s: there's some movement here it's just not
313.96s: what we're kind of hoping to see which
315.76s: is obviously to the moon now it does
319.44s: have earnings coming up which I feel is
321.56s: important to talk about so if we take a
323.60s: look at what we saw today in total net
327.40s: premium it was 1.3 million
330.88s: so what that tells me is obviously we
333.80s: have people that are coming in to buy
337.00s: obviously and if you look at the put
339.16s: volume call volume it's kind of light
341.48s: right so put volume was 52 call volume
344.92s: was 168 there's not a lot in here that
348.60s: necessarily jumped out at me so if we
351.40s: take a look now inside the trade tab we
354.92s: can
356.24s: see current open interest we have to
358.64s: update this
360.44s: so you can see current open interest is
362.04s: 596k versus 279 little bit light and if
366.00s: we take a look at open interest
367.44s: specifically for this series it's also
369.72s: very light it does have call skew heavy
372.60s: so I'm seeing 105,000 calls versus
374.96s: 31,000 puts that's that's a big ratio
377.68s: between those and normally when you're
379.60s: going into earnings a lot of people are
381.28s: actually hedging the downside because
384.36s: you're kind of you know holding the
386.20s: stock fearful of a gap down so you buy
388.36s: some puts that's super normal and I I
391.44s: just I don't see a massive concentration
394.80s: in here yet but again we can see that
397.28s: there were way more calls traded today
399.84s: except it's a really even split between
402.80s: the bid the offer and then between the
405.44s: market which we can't tell necessarily
407.48s: if those are bought or sold so looking
410.48s: through here there's nothing that's I
412.52s: don't know like really jumping out at me
414.12s: the same things you'll always see
415.60s: beginning of the day busier than end of
417.28s: day or beginning of the day and end of
419.92s: day busier than middle of the day
421.88s: typically that's kind of common but
424.28s: let's take a quick look at any large
427.60s: trades that came through I didn't see a
429.96s: whole lot that stuck out to me yeah it's
432.96s: typically for stuff like this I have a
434.44s: bunch of scans that I typically run and
437.20s: there was nothing that popped today like
438.64s: last week I'll even look between no side
441.32s: meaning things that are in the mid so to
443.68s: see if there's any like big big uh
445.88s: premium trades that rolled through and I
447.44s: just didn't see a lot of those so far as
450.16s: I could tell right now it looks like
452.36s: pretty quiet positioning leading into
454.72s: earnings we can see some put
456.80s: transactions coming in at the ask so
460.08s: people are buying some puts but it's
461.64s: still not much right 491 it's it's
464.00s: insignificant at best so something to
467.24s: keep an eyeball on I'm excited for
469.04s: earnings I'm really really really
471.00s: curious to see one if we're going to
473.96s: come across any interesting information
476.24s: that people tell me that is not coming
478.28s: so I'm not really expecting it but I am
480.56s: still hopeful that maybe GameStop will
482.76s: release a little bit of a outline or
484.68s: game plan on how we're thinking about
487.76s: the capital that's on hand because
489.80s: obviously I'm very interested in that
492.20s: and then the other thing I'm interested
494.28s: in is if we pop in here for earnings we
496.44s: can see that it's had decent earnings
499.80s: and what I mean by that is just in terms
501.68s: of Q2 if I look back over the past q2's
505.40s: it's obviously had some some down ticks
507.60s: but it's nothing that's like
508.68s: catastrophic Q2 and 22 actually rallied
511.64s: up so I don't think Q2 is necessarily
515.60s: like some sort of really bad quarter
517.76s: from what I can see here but it does
520.48s: look like there's an expansion in
522.96s: volatility leading into this earnings
524.64s: release which is kind of interesting um
527.32s: we won't really know what this will look
528.84s: like until the market gets closer to the
530.52s: close tomorrow but it looks like an
533.28s: interesting earnings play I'm definitely
534.76s: eyeballing it from an options trading
536.84s: perspective to look at it for earnings
538.76s: specifically just a little bit harder to
540.88s: structure than I typically like to in
542.60s: something like this which we can spend
543.96s: some time talking about during the live
545.68s: stream
546.92s: so exciting to see as always if there's
550.56s: any questions anything you want to take
551.96s: a look at let me know the entire live
553.88s: stream schedule is now out you can see
556.04s: it on the YouTube channel um we got
558.20s: stuff most days at 5:00 p.m. Pacific
560.00s: time so come hang out be an outlier I'll
561.64s: see you guys later
