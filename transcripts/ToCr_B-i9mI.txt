0.00s: What is up outliers? Today, I am just going to recap some of the GameStop live stream that
8.64s: I do Saturdays at 5 p.m. Pacific time because I actually learned some really interesting
13.00s: things. And because it's a short market week, I'm going to do my standard weekly outlook
18.60s: video tomorrow being Monday because that'll be right before the market opens on Tuesday.
24.24s: So today we'll just be about GameStop. And there was a couple of really, really interesting
28.56s: things that I picked up from the live stream yesterday, which I always remind everybody
33.20s: I have a blast doing those because of this because I have the opportunity to learn
38.20s: a little bit, hopefully share a little bit of my experience and information with others
43.32s: to maybe help them with their process. But I love that it's this beneficial back and
47.52s: forth style interaction, which is super fun because I think it's really informative for
52.56s: everybody.
53.56s: So one of the things I did yesterday was I popped onto DFVs, Rorynkitties, page, unread it.
63.60s: And I went all the way down as far as I could go to the origin. And I found something fascinating,
69.20s: something that I didn't expect to see personally. And when I clicked into this, I can see that
74.72s: we started with $113,962 account. And I can see $13,962 is in cash. And then I can see
82.92s: $100,000 is used. Okay, nothing so special about that. This is what I find semi-special.
92.96s: The fact that his entire portfolio here is in options. I genuinely took the cat to be
102.36s: a stock trader that used options to amplify his position. This tells me otherwise. This
110.20s: is an options trader. Now, again, obviously he trades stock and stuff like that. I'm not
114.56s: saying he's one or the other, most of us are not relegated to being one or the other.
119.68s: But my original perception was that when I went back this far and started looking through
124.08s: these, that I actually would have seen a stock position and then some options amplifying
129.52s: it, not just options. So I found that really, really interesting. And the curious thing is
135.64s: I go through a couple of these different cycles that I can see these different posts.
140.60s: And I pick up another really interesting series of adjustments that go into these positions.
148.32s: So the first thing I want to know is take a look at the fact that we have 1,000 total
157.12s: options in here. And we started with just 50. Then we started with another 50. And notice
164.72s: the time between these trades. So we see from the seventh to the 20th to the 12th to the
170.36s: 18th. So we can see some time passes. We're not scaling in right away. And one of my favorite
176.36s: parts here is we actually get to see a little bit of degenerate behavior. I use that term
181.24s: with all due respect and just love where the dude and what he does. And I also identify
188.04s: as a degenerate. I think that's what most of us are as traders. And I see he starts,
194.04s: you know, with 5 grand, 5 grand, 5 grand, 5 grand. And he, you know, he's buying when
198.80s: it's 60, 75, 55, 50. And then all of a sudden I see a 21 grand block come in. So then
205.76s: he grabs 230. This is the quintessential adding to a losing position, scaling in. Now, again,
215.12s: I say that partially ingest because a lot of the standard methodology you will hear from
221.28s: a lot of traders kind of like the can slim style specifically comes to mind, but others
226.20s: as well. You don't want to add to a losing trades. I myself actually don't fully believe
231.44s: in that. And I think that once you become a slightly more experienced trader, you get
235.68s: to explore these areas of nuance. So to me, I will add to losing positions if it's part
242.44s: of the broader plan. So I don't actually view this as just kind of being, you know, like
246.88s: a lost Yolo degenerate trader. I view this as him scaling into a position. And then when
252.48s: it got really cheap, he liked it at 60, he liked it at 75, he loved it at 30. That's
257.08s: what I took from this. Because the other thing I noticed is that he also scaled back in
261.20s: as it was going up. So this is a really interesting behavior to me specifically because he
267.52s: started so light 50, 50, 50, 50, and then he essentially doubles plus for the rest of
275.00s: these transactions, the smallest transaction after that is 100 lots. So that I can't help
280.88s: but find interesting. Now another interesting thing I find about this is that this is clearly
288.36s: centered on a specific strike. So he's scaling into the same position over time. So if we
295.28s: go back to this first, we can see that this position went on pretty early. And if I hover
302.76s: over this, it should tell me when he posted this, the eighth of September 2019, eighth of
308.52s: September in 2019, take a look at the options he bought. He bought leaps that were out in 2021.
317.00s: So he's playing the long game here. The other thing that this tells me is especially when he
321.48s: first started with GameStop is that this isn't as scalpel of an approach as I thought. Because
329.24s: one more analyzing everything that he's doing, it's so easy to fall into this, I don't know,
335.88s: to this mindset where it's like, yeah, this dude essentially is a time traveler. He knows what's
339.56s: going to happen before it happens. He positions in times it perfectly. And as I look through more of
344.52s: this, again, he's an absolute stud. He's crushed it. But it's not perfect. And again, I use that
351.16s: with all due respect. I'm not saying that he did anything bad or anything like that. It was just
355.40s: that my perception after looking through and reading about him, I kind of built him up to be where
361.88s: everything I thought he did was like, perfect. And as I go back to Sfar, I can actually see
367.96s: elements where again, there's no reason for him to go out as far with leaps if you had a specific
374.84s: date or a specific time in mind for something to happen. So this to me represents him trading
382.20s: this broader thesis of him liking GameStop. This is again, to me, not indicative of him attempting
389.80s: to trade these different FDD cycles and stuff like that in the beginning. Because otherwise,
394.52s: I don't see why you would position it quite this way. But I thought that was interesting. Then if
399.32s: we scroll up a bit, we have to go for a while. Because this is still the same position, all options.
405.48s: We have to scroll up more. This is now 29 November. All options still, no change. Then we go into
415.96s: 11 December. All options still with a couple with one additional trade here. So his account value
422.68s: is declined. It's gone from 113 down to 83. And he added another 100. Lots at the same strike.
431.00s: So now he has 1100. So he's kind of moving and even lot increments. Again, this is all part
436.04s: of the fingerprinting process for me. Then this happens. We now go into a bunch of different
444.76s: explorations. And what I find so interesting about this change is notice how we now have even closer
452.52s: explorations. So we still maintain this eight call position. But then we have July in 2020,
460.92s: April in 2020, Feb in 2020, and then April in 2021. So he's maintaining a deep position. He scaled
470.76s: down this front options position. And he spread some of his capital around fascinating. He took this
478.12s: from over $100,000 position to down to 62. And then he started moving that out into other strikes
484.76s: and explorations. Very interesting. And again, this was really surprising to me because this is all
490.84s: the way out now in 31 December 2019. And there's still no shares at all in this picture. It's all
498.44s: options. Find that very interesting. So then we go out a little bit further. We still have all
506.04s: options. And this is now 14 Jan. We go out further. This should be the end of Jan 2020. All options.
517.72s: Then we have end of Feb 2020. All options. His account has contracted meaningfully. He's down to
526.28s: 44 grand from his start. I don't I didn't catch what his peak was. But from his start was over 100.
533.40s: Now we see shares. So this is the first time that we see shares enter this equation. And it's just
542.04s: $1,400. So his account value is now back up quite a lot. He has 117 in cash, 215 total. So my guess is
552.36s: he deposited a bit of money here. And then obviously made some money potentially off of these
557.24s: options and stuff. But this takes us now to April of 2020 is the first time I see him by shares.
563.56s: So this dude has been trading options really as a leveraged position for some time as he's
569.88s: building out this position in May of 2020. Notice his share equivalent hasn't changed. And he's
576.36s: building out more options. So I thought that was really fascinating. And I learned a lot about the
583.00s: way that he tends to purchase options, what explorations, all of the traits that I've seen him put on
589.08s: as I scroll through this whole saga is not short dated. He's not doing a bunch of stuff that's
595.56s: expiring in like five seconds. Most of the stuff that he's buying are things that are further
600.76s: out in time. And most of them are out of the money. Right. So we can see that in this case, the
607.08s: stock was trading at 401. And we can see that he had the eights, tens, 15s, 20s and 12s
613.64s: across different explorations. These are all further out of the money. So the other thing
619.32s: that I identify as I go through this whole process with him is his preference for strike
627.56s: selection via I'm using it mentally as a surrogate delta. He has a bit of a delta preference.
635.48s: So we can see him now scaling more into shares, more into shares again. And this process continues
642.52s: for him. So I don't know if everybody else knew that. It's probably old news to the vast majority
649.16s: of people out there. But again, I'm new to this. So I'm enjoying learning these different artifacts
655.16s: myself. This isn't something that I've come across a lot of different places. I think one of the
659.00s: reasons why I didn't expect to see this is because when I first started doing the live streams and
664.12s: talking with people like Newton and kind of learning the background, it was explained to me that
668.60s: actually for a long time, Superstunk and like some of these other communities wouldn't even allow
673.40s: the discussion of options, which again, that just led me to believe like, okay, yeah, then you know,
679.80s: since so much of this is modeled after roaring Kitty, I took that to mean that yeah, he obviously
687.88s: used options just as a position amplification, but the majority of his money more often than
692.68s: not would be in stocks. That starts to happen here in July of 2020 as he's moving into more and
698.92s: more of the equity. So really interesting. And I'm really interested to see if we find out soon,
707.16s: hopefully, if he's maintained some sort of game stop position as he's been playing Choui,
713.96s: because as I go through his entire portfolio going back from when he started here,
719.40s: I mean, it's all game stop, right? So I haven't seen him trade other things in here.
726.20s: And I haven't really picked up on this is holiday. I haven't really picked up on that pattern for
736.76s: him. So yeah, I love the way that this dude calls it a straight yellow from the get go. That's
743.48s: essentially exactly what I see here as I watch his account value go from 22 mill to 48 mill to 33
751.96s: mill. And the dude just doesn't care. He's just holding through all of this. I saw the account
757.48s: value go down to 26. I mean, it's epic, absolutely epic. So then we see the ending account value at
763.88s: like 34.4 mill in 2021, final update. This I find interesting that he called it the final update on
770.68s: 16 April. This is interesting. And I would love to learn a little bit about why this as the final
776.76s: update versus April 17th or the end of April, like why here? I don't know if this had to do with the
782.36s: case and stuff like that that was going on and the fact that he was going to have to appear in front
786.28s: of Congress. I don't know if that happened here or if this happened previous to that. You guys
791.80s: got to help me with that because I know that you know the timeline better than I do.
796.12s: But then he comes back obviously to June. And the dude has gone from 34.4 mill to 210.
804.28s: So quarter of a billion. Absolutely fascinating. Learned a lot. So what I want to do in the next
810.76s: GME live stream is actually go through these early trades more in detail and like go back into
816.04s: on demand on thinkorswim and like actually explore these positions. See what they looked like
820.68s: at the time that he was getting in because for me sheer curiosity. This is not something that I'm
826.52s: looking to trade off of. I actually model exactly nothing. What I do after roaring kitty
831.72s: respect him tremendously obviously. But what he does works for him. And I can tell you I've been
837.00s: trading for a long time. But there's no chance that I want to put my entire portfolio into a single
842.68s: position. That's just my my risk tolerance. And I know myself and it's because you know my
848.76s: background with money and like what I'm trying to do is different than what he was trying to do
852.44s: it seems. And that's okay right different people have different objectives. All I'm saying is
856.36s: that because I understand there's a difference in our motivations and the way that we treat risk.
861.00s: This wouldn't work for me. But the overwhelming majority of his success obviously came from his
867.16s: intellect is ability to identify these opportunities. But also his willingness to literally take
873.08s: from the jump is $100,000 portfolio and take $100,000 of that and just put it directly into
878.44s: options. Like that is not an insignificant move to make. So really really cool to see. So yeah
886.92s: that's some of what we learned from the past weekend. I'm looking forward to diving in even
891.00s: further learning more as always. If there's anything I should take a look at, let me know
895.16s: be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
