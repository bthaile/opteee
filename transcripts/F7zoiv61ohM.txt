560.00s: string
561.76s: portfolio
564.88s: $4,3 CONDIT
567.12s: .
568.96s: money slightly. I think we agreed originally on 600k. It's six and a quarter literally just
575.44s: so that I could have 200k for all of these. That's literally the only reason it's so that stuff
581.44s: can be equal weighted because before it was like 225 of this, 175 of this. So I want that to be
590.00s: the same for these three names. TQ's spy and I bet. Notice a big change there.
597.12s: Before when we were doing this previously, we had started with TQ's and SSO. We were looking at
607.28s: managing three times and two times leverage ETF. Then when we had that really hectic market period
613.20s: where things were going, hey, wire, I moved from SSO into Upro so that I could regain some liquidity.
621.92s: SSO is notoriously not very liquid and it also freed up some capital and stuff like that.
627.60s: So that's why we ended up in two three times levered ETFs, TQ's and Upro. That wasn't designed to be
637.68s: the perpetual state going forward. It was actually something that I knew I wasn't going to want to
643.04s: maintain its perpetuity. So with all of that, I made a rebalance today. So what I did was I flattened out
654.16s: the Upro position. So between Upro and SSO, those two combined are marked at down 1212.
666.24s: What this means is the coverage triangle in there is underwater. It didn't fully recoup the cost
673.84s: when I was rolling out. Part of it is because it's month six, right? So halfway through the year,
679.20s: wanted to just make the transition so that we have another six months essentially to look at this
684.24s: new variation. So I'm just giving you all these caveats because there are things in here that I'm
689.60s: doing literally for the purpose of creating content with you. They're not necessarily optimized
694.16s: decisions. So all that aside, that still is a massive performance from when we first got into
704.40s: things like SSO. It's still not back to break even from our original entry into it. And again,
711.52s: this simply stems from where the covered triangle is. We got into SSO when things were trading
718.08s: around 95 and things are still trading at 92. So on an overall basis, it's still outperforming
727.44s: honestly. Again, it's nothing that I would write home about, but for something that otherwise
731.60s: would be down, that's a pretty good performance. So even though SSO would be down about, like I said,
739.36s: a few, a few percent. If we just plot this out really quick in terms of return on invested capital,
747.12s: I forgot what it had maybe like 225 or something. I want to say maybe 225.
754.80s: It's down 0.6%. So again, the covered triangle is still down here across those two, but it's just
762.72s: a lot better than had it just been entered and then bienhold. So the game plan going forward is a
769.68s: little different now. And you can see the big change here again is I equal weighted these. This
775.92s: is again, just for comparison sake. But then I moved into spy. Now my vision for the spy position
782.56s: here is to give you another look. Now this other look is designed the entire purpose of this whole
792.00s: exercise is to give you a visual and practical application of the strategy in different forms.
800.56s: And with the levered covered triangle, there are some nuances that go with it. I already
806.88s: talked to you about a couple of them. For example, we know that three times leverage is actually
811.60s: a little high. It's a little little little more than I would want for a longer term holding.
816.08s: We know something like 2.2 times leverage is actually more optimal for a long time long term
823.12s: bienhold or long term dollar cost averaging. It's based on just a bunch of different research you can
828.00s: look at at your own leisure. So by creating this now balance, if you take a look at these two
839.20s: together, they're all not that different anymore. They used to be way more different. But because
845.12s: spy is so tech heavy at this point, these are actually closer than they are different.
851.36s: So if we take a look at essentially waiting these, this would be three times leverage.
857.60s: This would be one times leverage. And I want these just as regular numbers.
862.88s: So we can figure out what the actual leverage is for these combined positions
875.60s: by doing a little bit of very simple math. And if you know what the answer is, what the
881.28s: combined leverage is, throw it in the chat. I'm going to open the door for Thor real quick.
893.12s: No guesses. One of you knows. One of you knows the answer.
906.80s: I'm convinced.
911.92s: Lauren, what's our answer? Come on now, Lauren. You know what this is.
918.32s: I'm trying to show you actually a really important concept more broadly, which is you have to be
926.96s: pretty agile when you're looking at individual positions versus when you're looking at portfolio
932.16s: level and striking a balance between what those are. There's actually a really, really important
941.20s: important series of trade-offs, but it's actually super simple. What we would do here is simply take
951.04s: whatever number of things we have, the number of positions we would wait it by the total capital
957.28s: and then we would average it. And then we can figure out what our leverage is. Now this one's super
961.68s: simple because it's very straightforward. But let's say this is 200,000.
966.32s: And so is this. So all we would do is take an average of these that would be weighted
978.24s: against whatever the size is. But since they're equal weighted, you in this case just need to
983.60s: figure out what the average is here. So we can just read this one is four, divide by two,
992.72s: so we're sitting right around 2.0 leverage between these two positions. So that would represent
999.36s: our market exposure with respect to total market leverage. So this would be a $400,000
1006.64s: position composite between those two that would be really behaving up to around $800,000.
1014.48s: That's the way to think about it. So if we look at what and again, that's assuming like more pure
1023.52s: relationship, not really the case, right? So again, if we do three times the 200,000 gives us
1031.44s: 600,000. You add the 200,000 gives you 800,000, but it's not going to be that linear because the leverage
1037.04s: actually is a little more shockingly advantageous than that. So you get a little bit of a positive
1043.28s: bump, believe it or not. Does that make sense? Well, we just talked about how to calculate the leverage
1050.16s: when you're looking at two different positions, one levered, one knot to create a composite leverage.
1057.68s: The reason why again, this is useful is because when you're trying to consider what you want your
1063.36s: portfolio to look like longer term, this is absolutely a consideration to make in my opinion.
1070.64s: Because you can set something up that achieves some level of leverage. And again, remember in this
1079.44s: context, the leverage really just gives you more risk. So it's not like this is some super secret
1086.32s: edge that nobody else can see. There's not really an edge here. What you're doing is just taking
1092.96s: more risk. You're taking a higher market beta. But the cool part about it is that from a retail
1099.28s: trading lens, you're not evaluated on your max drawdowns. It's whatever you want it to be.
1105.52s: And if you're risk tolerant, something like this can actually perform pretty well. But again,
1112.56s: you're going to expect it to have some issues. But this is the cool part about trading a covered
1119.60s: strangle. Because if you take a look at the total PNL on T triple cues, the position is up around
1127.36s: five grand. I think this might be in the context of, let me see if I have Roic.
1135.60s: It doesn't look like I have Roic. Give me one sec. So I have return on capital here. But I actually
1143.68s: want to add return on invested capital. So Roic would go here. I want to give you a comparison factor.
1155.60s: Between what the buy and hold equivalent is. So in this case, it would just be the total PNL
1170.40s: divided by whatever the allocation is as a percent 2.54. So again, this isn't like some sort of
1183.28s: super impressive return on invested capital. Actually, if you take a look at worthy and
1188.00s: impressive return on capital is you guys see what I see? It's literally hilarious to me because
1195.12s: it's undeniable. It's absolutely undeniable, which is again, just generally humorous.
1203.36s: When I'm looking at the total performance of GameStop, it is absolutely leading the pack
1214.40s: in a pretty big way, which is actually very cool to see. Because in terms of trading volatility
1222.16s: and stuff like that and the amount of all that's in it, GameStop with out of doubt punches pretty
1228.88s: well above its weight, like solidly above its weight. And it's largely because of how much
1237.76s: volatility there is, which is again, a general function of it. But I don't know if a lot of people
1248.40s: would give it the credit. It otherwise deserves in this context, which is why I'm specifically calling
1254.56s: it out. GameStop is crushing it. Joseph says, Roic equals RoCy sort of, but not quite,
1269.60s: because it depends on the way that you're viewing what you consider capital exposure versus Roic.
1280.08s: So when we look at this, this $200,000, this entire $200,000 is not exposed at really any given
1291.52s: point in time. You can take a look at that right now. We're literally only using 40% or 79 of the
1298.96s: $200,000. So this isn't exposed. This is simply money that's invested into a strategy.
1308.48s: And right now, there's a pretty meaningful actually amount of this capital that's invested
1316.08s: into the strategy that's technically just sitting there. Now, as you guys know, I put it into box
1320.40s: spreads and stuff like that. So it's a completely great question. And the way that I would think about
1328.80s: those two different metrics is, and the reason why I like to use Roic is because it keeps me honest,
1334.56s: right? The better metric, if I wanted to make this look better, the better metric for me to use
1341.84s: hands down instead would be if I take the total utilization and calculate the return on
1350.80s: invested capital off of the utilization, right? So if I show you what that would be just for an
1357.44s: example, if we take the P&L divided by the utilization, we'd go from that 2% in change to 6%.
1364.00s: Huge difference. But it's a disingenuous metric. And I think it's super important to show actual
1371.60s: performance of things, which is exactly why I calculate it this way. It's not the the pretty way
1376.48s: 2.54% on something that's been running for six months is nothing that I would be like, wow,
1382.72s: that's crushing it. But this is what trading is. And for this strategy, especially given the
1390.32s: broader landscape and context, that's completely fine. Again, it's not blowing the doors off.
1396.32s: But I would absolutely take this over the buy and hold equivalent. So
1400.64s: anyways, the reason why I'm running Spy here is because Spy gives us again that other look.
1413.60s: Now when I'm trading the levered ETFs, there is a significant portion of what I do is going to be
1421.68s: trend following. If you'll remember, and if we go back to this period in time, and let's do TQs,
1433.92s: in TQs, we had, well, I had, I should say, I had a position built of long shares. So I had been
1445.60s: accumulating shares into like the second of April here. Somewhere right in here, third of April,
1453.84s: I should say, right here. And then all of a sudden, I start scaling out of the shares. And the
1464.72s: scaling started on February 7th here. And this is as things started getting highly, highly congested,
1476.88s: meaning it didn't really look like this was starting to break out above this. So it was a very
1483.52s: conservative pulldown in the observation of just the broader market performance. And if you take a
1490.88s: look, part of that has to do with the red flags that came from this period here. So what happens
1499.12s: during this period here is the market is rallying, rallying, rallying. And then the market hits
1506.72s: a local high. What do you notice about the net highs lows on the day that that high was made?
1517.36s: They're trending down. That ain't right. That's completely abnormal. When we're seeing new highs
1524.88s: posting, we would expect not necessarily mass participation, but definitely more broad participation
1534.48s: than being net negative on net highs lows. And this was both for the New York Stock Exchange and
1540.88s: the Nasdaq. The funny thing about this is it wasn't even on the day of that it flipped negative.
1546.80s: It was negative for like two days, three days before it posted that high. So anyways, when I see that,
1554.32s: that is a red flag that tells me have to be a little thoughtful here. And to see how this continues to
1563.52s: trend both the net highs lows metric, but also just the market performance. Long story short,
1568.96s: that led to me taking an exit on those shares here. So the reason why I rolled out of the shares
1576.08s: there is because of my standard approach. I can always get back in if I want always. So then as we
1585.36s: start rallying here, again, I take a look at net highs lows. And as we start to see this day here
1598.00s: and this day here. So we rally up. We get two to three semi sideways days. What do you notice about
1606.96s: net highs lows? They start weakening. So on the latter half of these days, net highs lows is coming off
1616.40s: heavy. Why would that be? That's abnormal. So that's why there wasn't a reentry here. Otherwise,
1625.28s: I would have reentered here for sure and just bought shares, but it didn't. So I didn't.
1629.76s: So then anyways, at this point, it's full shore puts. It's all that's being traded. And then you
1634.48s: can see some of the lingering entries and stuff on these days. So anyways, this is what it looks like
1643.52s: with respect to trading a levered ETF. There's a lot of trend following and momentum being applied
1651.76s: because what you don't want when you're trading any sort of leveraged product to the long side
1658.72s: is you don't want to play this game. You don't want to go from there to there because that's an 82% drop
1666.00s: that will absolutely kill the performance of your strategy for some time.
1674.32s: Even with something like the coverage strangle, if you had held through this entire period,
1679.44s: you would end up coming out all right. But there's a really long duration where this wouldn't
1684.24s: look super great. And that's the point of being an active trader is to not do that. Same reason
1690.88s: why I chose not to do it here. It looks like it sucks. Don't want to do it. So anyways,
1698.80s: when trading this in something like spy, it's completely different to completely different game.
1705.68s: Why is it a completely different game? It's because of the way spy moves comparatively.
1711.12s: This drop here is just touching 20%, just touching 20%. And that's still a big drop. But in terms of
1721.20s: overall metrics, that's very easy to work through. So when I'm trading the coverage strangle in
1728.48s: something like spy that moves much more slowly, I actually have a much higher propensity to take on
1737.12s: shares, to take a assignment of things and to wait stuff out and stuff like that. So by moving
1745.92s: and keeping the TQ's position for more of a momentum style, take on the coverage strangle,
1751.44s: and then spy, which will offer a little bit more of like a dollar cost average style,
1757.28s: coverage strangle. It'll give you a couple different visuals on different ways that this can
1762.40s: be built to suit whatever the purpose is that you might have for the strategy. So that's what's
1770.00s: going on there and a ton of context around it. As always, if you have any questions on that,
1774.72s: let me know. Let's talk about the market. So today, as I was saying earlier, the market really does
1781.84s: seem to generally be gathering strength, actually using this net highs lows. For an example,
1786.32s: this is a perfect example. What do you notice the difference is here on net highs lows,
1791.68s: as the market is rallying here, as compared to what net highs lows look like when the market was
1797.60s: rallying here. Significantly better. Significantly better. You can see net highs lows right now, both
1807.20s: gross highs are expanding pretty quickly, but net highs and lows are pretty strong.
1815.84s: In terms of their placement with respect to a standard deviation,
1823.60s: NASDAQ is at 1.3 standard deviation move to the upside for net highs lows. And
1831.20s: NIC is at 0.6 standard deviation. So kind of within the expected bounds for the New York stock
1840.56s: exchange, but not that far off of the upper bound. So this, to me, is showing pretty significant
1850.88s: strength even from a statistical lens coming into it. And as you know, there's a bunch of other
1855.60s: breadth indicators that we can look at things like put call ratios and yada yada yada. These
1862.64s: are all random ones that I'll I'll track. So this is put call ratios for the NASDAQ. Then if we take
1869.44s: a look at put call ratio for the S&P. Here, and then there's also for the Russell. Here,
1885.92s: and what you'll notice is put call ratio for S&P is that 60% 0.6 for the NASDAQ is at 0.58. So
1896.08s: about the same. And then the Russell is at 0.41 way off way way way off. So what would lead
1911.76s: to that big of a discrepancy between put call ratios of NASDAQ and S&P versus something like
1921.92s: Russell is everything to do with forward looking expectations. That's what you're seeing there. That's
1927.44s: what the put call ratio is telling you. It gives you a really, really useful insight to how the
1934.64s: constituents are being placed, meaning the individual holdings within the sectors themselves. You
1940.56s: can look at the actual constituents. And that's why you see here. It's the Russell 2000 constituents
1948.32s: options. I want to be clear on that. This isn't looking at the index. The reason why that matters
1952.16s: is because in the index, generally speaking, you would expect to see just an overwhelming number of
1960.80s: puts typically speaking because of the hedging that's going on. But what you're seeing here
1967.84s: is a big discrepancy between S&P put call ratio between NASDAQ and Russell, which is something that
1981.76s: again, it's never any one of these like quote unquote indicators that tells the story. It's
1987.92s: always the grouping of them. And there's a lot that you can start to piece together. And I'll show
1996.32s: you another piece of this puzzle. VIX. If you take a look at VIX, what do you notice? VIX is still
2005.36s: at 17, even with the market rallying as hard as it is. So with that, what does that tell us?
2018.16s: It tells us that the market is still pricing in a certain level of risk, even with these various
2027.36s: names rallying pretty hard. And again, if you pay attention to stuff like put call ratio, put call
2034.64s: ratio of like 0.4 is really, really low. And when you see put call ratios that low, it tells us that
2046.16s: there's a lot of speculative position in going on to the upside. And this goes exactly what I was
2052.00s: talking about on the stream yesterday. And I've been talking about this for a little while now,
2057.20s: where when you look at small caps from a pot odds perspective, they don't look bad. Again,
2064.08s: who knows how it goes? I still would prefer to go the way by looking at the individual names. That's
2070.72s: what I've positioned in. But I still think this as a general theme is worth acknowledging,
2078.88s: because it looks like the put call ratio that you're seeing in S&P and what you're seeing in
2085.84s: NASDAQ is a little light, but not super light, still upside leaning. But here, this discrepancy is
2093.92s: massive. And this is pretty significant upside expectation. And you have to think of it in the
2100.40s: context of this is likely people just looking at all of these various names in here and just starting
2106.64s: to take directional bets. Because you can see stuff like MSTR, you all know what's up there.
2115.04s: SMCI, IONQ, the tech sector within the Russell is starting to grow. And it's actually starting
2123.60s: to grow pretty significantly relative to the other names that you see in here. And you can see
2129.92s: utilities is just about starting to roll off. That's a little dramatic, but utilities is continuing to
2136.40s: lag. Financial has always been a really big component industrials as well. But IT is starting to
2143.44s: expand as the percentage of the overall index that it takes. IT is expanding everywhere. And it's
2148.56s: because of what IT represents. Look at IT now. Like this is crazy. IT here, plus again, you can
2157.20s: wrap comm services, not the same as IT, but close enough. And if you combine those two in the S&P,
2164.80s: I mean, that is like an insane, insane portion of the index. Actually, let's see.
2170.40s: So if you add IT and comm services, which is 99.76%, it's like 42%. 42% of the S&P 500 now is tech,
2191.36s: overall tech. I don't think this gives us this view for the others, does it? Yeah, I didn't think so.
2197.36s: Kind of a bummer because I love that view that it gives you here. And I don't think it does it for
2202.40s: the Russell. Yeah, unfortunate. Nonetheless, I think that there's a lot of really interesting
2210.96s: plays right now in the Russell, which I actually want to spend a little time looking at. But the
2216.16s: broad market here is showing a couple of those general signs that kind of just walking you through.
2223.20s: VIX still slightly elevated. So let's take a look at a couple of the scans from today.
2231.84s: There was one that I already posted in the discord because it deserves some attention.
2245.52s: This is the one.
2253.12s: So this scan here is me monitoring for moderate size trades and VIX. And I'm looking for stuff
2264.32s: that's at slash out of the money. So stuff that's like very directional, especially in something
2269.76s: like VIX. VIX is super nuanced. If you trade options in the indices themselves, the way that you
2276.32s: trade an option changes completely when you're trading something like VIX because of what
2283.84s: the options, explorations are tied to, which is not spot VIX, it goes pretty deep pretty fast.
2292.32s: And as we just casually, very casually poke through this. And we see a handful of $10,000
2302.56s: plus trades, which by the way is not a ton, but a couple of these are a little more
2308.40s: sized. And some of them are actually fairly near term in nature. So like this here, this is essentially
2316.00s: a month, a month out. And these are the 20 calls we can see that the last was $1.97. And it came
2323.92s: across pretty much right right in the middle of the market. So it's tough to tell discreetly like
2329.68s: what side of the trade that came through on, which is why unusual whales is pretty useful. But
2338.48s: anyways, I want to show you the net change there in VIX because it was interesting to me.
2345.60s: We literally just looked at this yesterday, BB AI reminds me of whatever that thing is from
2365.44s: Star Wars, the BB whatever that robot was, BB AI always makes me think of that.
2372.64s: The fuck was the name of that robot from Star Wars? I can't remember. But when you look at the
2378.88s: overall put volume in terms of premium, pretty big unwind, when you look at the call premium,
2386.64s: starts off accumulation, but then turns into general unwind. This is the market expecting one thing
2393.84s: and seeing something slightly different actually happen, which is kind of cool to see. Then if we
2399.12s: take a look at just overall changes in the OIs. So this is build out. You can see that the put side
2406.96s: really, I mean, had the, let me change this, I was wondering, X here. So you can see that the put
2417.60s: side for like the super high strikes is really the main change. But in the near term, take a look
2424.32s: at these, the 16 and a half, the 16 and a half got actually quite interesting here, quite quickly.
2434.48s: And if we take a look at OI changes here, the put side got active out and know, but then way
2440.96s: out and feb, we see the calls change front, not so much. So what this tells me is that near term
2449.12s: expectation is still playing for expansion and ball. We're not seeing the unwind of these positions
2454.80s: yet, although based on the price action we saw today, I do suspect we'll see some level of
2460.32s: unwind in some of these VIX plays, especially the real near near term stuff. But so ball is not a
2473.20s: sleep yet. Ball is what I would consider to be very, very active. And there's pretty strong
2481.36s: positioning still still going on here. In terms of directional positioning, that's definitely
2488.40s: slowing down a little bit. But in general, I think you can see a pretty strong, a pretty strong
2498.16s: drift in the overall expectation with some caveat in terms of put side ball. But you can see that
2508.24s: some of these trades, especially on the day, they're just massive. Like this was a insane amount
2516.24s: of movement just today, 35 mil in call premium, 23 mil, which is relatively high for something when
2525.36s: the broad market is still making broad, broad up moves. So yeah. Anyways, generally what I'm seeing
2540.16s: from the the broad market. Now let's take a quick look at the individual sectors.
2547.12s: Healthcare still can't catch a bit. Still the place to go looking for fades in my opinion.
2554.56s: Utilities was crushing it, slowing down a little bit. This has become a picking ground for more
2561.36s: neutral style plays. Same thing with real estate. Same thing with staples. The relationship between
2567.76s: staples and discretionary is been chaotic at best discretionary is now rolling off a little bit
2575.20s: compared to staples staples is doing better at recapturing. And then you can see tech
2581.76s: and comm services are are generally leading the pack here. The other thing I want to show you
2588.32s: quickly is the cop report. So here, I don't care about the rest of this. Here, I want you to pay
2603.12s: attention to the positioning. And you can see that large speculators are still running net negative.
2616.00s: And even though large speculators have come up a little bit in terms of net positioning,
2624.80s: they're still that negative, which is funny because I actually view this as one of the very rare
2631.84s: instances that at least for the move as we see it right now, retail called this way better,
2640.08s: way better because you can see small small speculators started phasing in here,
2647.92s: right, buying this massive dip. And sure as shit, so far they're looking priced correct
2658.24s: if they're taking profits quickly because it still seems like this here, right, notice just the
2665.60s: general price behavior. We're seeing the high and then this hasn't really approached the high
2672.24s: yet before already started trailing sideways. And as I showed you net highs lows is looking generally
2679.28s: supportive, but we're not seeing big follow through volume yet.
2688.64s: So if you take a look at overall volume here, you can see that on this day, we had
2697.28s: outsized volume. But from that day into the last two trading days, volume has actually come off
2705.76s: a fair amount, I would say. So volume is not highly supportive here, at least as of right now.
2716.56s: Hey, yo, James, what up? Now, quick question before we go into scanning and just taking a look at
2725.68s: that stuff. I talked about now on the Wednesday session, getting back to doing, you know, a quick
2736.16s: market recap and then a skill development segment. Is there anything that you see on the list or
2743.60s: anything that's not on the list that you might want to do a session on Wednesday for skill development,
2750.00s: if not, I'm always happy to pick. But I try to take a look at stuff that you would like us
2756.72s: to focus on to see if we can make it again a little more personalized and focusing on what's most
2762.40s: relevant to you at this point in time. And then as always, for the pro members on Thursday,
2772.40s: we'll do the deeper dive in kind of the practical application of the concept. So feel free,
2778.56s: just kind of scroll around a little bit to let you eyeball and then throw it in the chat,
2784.16s: looks like Reese is interested in usual options activity. I actually think I have a video I'm
2788.56s: going to do on that at some point. So that definitely could be one of them and open to whatever
2795.20s: else you might want to take a look at. So feel free to let me know and then I'll grab whatever
2799.52s: consensus is. All right. So now this doesn't look like anything. I'm just going through my scams.
2808.48s: These are ones that I haven't had a chance to catch up on for the day. So I'm just going to flip
2815.44s: through a bunch of these really fast. One was this. Yeah, okay.
2825.04s: So this one is looking at funny enough actually unusual options activity.
2835.04s: And this one looks like a pretty decent size play that came through. It looks like a little
2845.68s: closer to the bid. Let's see. Yeah, it looks much closer to the bid. So this looks like unwinding
2869.04s: into the strength. That's what I see. Yeah. I mean, still net. Net volume was strong.
2884.88s: And let's see where this is all positioned. Yeah. So still bullish skew in terms of premium until
2895.04s: you get out until July 25th. And then November 21st, the rest of it's pretty bullish in terms of
2906.72s: overall skew. So this one looks interesting. I already have my alert set in here. It does look
2914.40s: like it's wanting to break out. I don't love the amount of overhead and stuff.
2920.08s: We'll take a look at a couple more GE GE. I've already talked about I have a position in here.
2929.76s: And yeah, I mean, this I talked about for a couple different reasons. This is involved in a lot.
2937.84s: Lauren says I can't see that list. Well, can you do more leaps on a skill dev? Not sure if that's
2945.44s: applicable. When you say more about leaps, you mean talk to me about that idea, Lauren, is this like
2955.92s: I assume it's some capacity of like using leaps?
2961.68s: But give me a little more context on what is it about leaps?
2966.16s: I think there's a couple different ways we could take that one, but I'll definitely add it to the list.
2978.16s: James says plus one to spotting patterns. When you say spotting patterns is this in unusual
2986.40s: options activity or is this just general patterns? James says or I guess getting a better understanding
2993.76s: of what's normal when it deviates from it. Okay, so you mean I assume you mean in terms of
3000.64s: unusual options activity. H says how to identify a regime and how to figure out if ones changed
3010.64s: would be interesting. Yeah, okay. Let's see if we have anything in here on regimes. We don't.
3017.04s: That's great. So we can do identifying market regimes and
3031.04s: botting or like that one. Market regimes are interesting too because there's a million different
3037.60s: ways to classify them. You can classify market regimes based on vol, based on sectors, based on
3044.72s: interest rates based on economic factors. That's actually kind of fun.
3053.44s: James says more general. I see. That's kind of tough. Let me see if I can figure something out
3060.64s: for that one. So this would be like pattern. Because I have pattern spotting. I was going to change it
3065.84s: to like pattern recognition. Yeah, so let me see if I can figure something out for this one.
3074.48s: Pattern, botting slash recognition, developing baseline, and tracking deviation.
3091.44s: Let me think on that one. Because that's an interesting one, but it's really, really difficult,
3097.60s: especially if it's super broad. Like if I were to think about trying to teach somebody about
3105.52s: spotting patterns, it would have to be done in the context of like looking at a certain thing.
3116.00s: And it's just because obviously patterns vary so much. So I think that could be a fun one. I
3123.60s: just have to think about. You just have to think about where to tie it to.
3134.40s: Papa proper says would like to learn more about hedging downside risk with options. My biggest
3141.92s: struggle is that I tend to overhead you my downside protection nearly offsets my gains. Yeah,
3146.40s: that's absolutely going to be the case. That's about synthetic hedges.
3154.40s: Okay, so I have one here. I'll build this one out. And then I'm just going to slot dates in for
3161.28s: these so that we have them. So we'll do patterns.
3175.36s: This one, we could do pattern recognition on 11.
3184.40s: And then we can do unusual options activity. We'll do that one at some point. I don't know if I'm
3190.08s: going to do the video first on that or not. And then for hedging hedging is a tricky one too.
3199.12s: Because I honestly think hedging in options trading. I'm going to zoom this out.
3204.88s: hedging in options trading. I think it's probably one of the most bastardized
3211.36s: concepts that I can think of. Because retail traders really have this like
3219.28s: extremely contorted idea that they're going to be able to
3227.36s: have their cake and eat it too. Like pretty significantly actually, which is
3233.60s: slightly confounding because what you're talking about is exactly correct.
3239.28s: More often than not with hedging, you will find that it's really, really expensive on a relative
3246.16s: basis. Intrating you get paid for taking risk. So then if we start to try an offset too much risk
3259.04s: or even what might seem like not that much risk, but enough of it. And it'll really serve as
3267.04s: drag on your returns. I think one of the most broken narratives I see retail traders have with
3274.08s: respect to hedging is this idea that they're going to put on their hedge. Then they're going to
3279.84s: somehow make money on their hedge and then make money on the base position, which is just so ignorant.
3287.92s: Because in general context, like when you're putting your hedge on, that should be viewed literally
3294.48s: as a cost. The cost of whatever the other position is that you want to put on for whatever reason.
3300.56s: This is not to say hedging is bad or it doesn't have its use. It does. However, I think retail traders
3307.60s: just have a completely broken view of hedging. So I actually really, really like that topic.
3316.56s: That's good. Anything else that you guys can think of for our list or for building out the next
3324.64s: several of these. Because I really like these two topics. Again, the unusual options activity will be
3332.96s: in there somewhere. I'm just not sure if I'm going to do the video on it first or not.
3340.32s: And then in the meantime, if you have any questions or if there's anything that you want to look at real
3344.96s: quick, now's the time, I'm going to let Thor back in, but I got like maybe another four or five minutes.
3353.76s: H says what the most important tools are for a trader, that I love that one. I was literally
3369.60s: just talking with somebody about this. I love this topic. I got to think on it. I don't
3379.04s: think about finding the best tools. This is a great topic. I think the topic is really,
3395.84s: it's so interesting because like your question of most important or
3410.96s: best is really entertaining because in trading, there literally isn't one. It's just not how it works.
3420.88s: So I will, oh man, I love that one. I have to think through this. Oh, shit. You guys didn't tell me.
3430.40s: Joe just told me it's BB eight. That's the fucking robot. Thank you, Joe. He just texted me. Now I
3439.44s: got to look this thing up. BB eight. Yeah. This is what I was fucking talking about. You guys just
3446.88s: straight up left me hanging. This is the dude. It's kind of like a less prone to get stuck R2D2.
3458.16s: It's kind of fun. H says highest impact might be the better term. No, no, no, I actually think
3469.52s: the way that you're phrasing it is like the most commonly way to phrase it. So I actually love that.
3477.76s: The trick is it's kind of like looking for something that doesn't exist. So here, I'll give you
3484.24s: an example. And then again, we definitely can go deeper in a detail, but I literally love this
3490.48s: conversation. This will help me flesh out some of the ideas. If we were to think about
3497.28s: like best or most useful. Here's how I would think about it. The very first thing would be option
3514.96s: prices. The second thing would be price and volume. And then after that,
3533.52s: it's all open. It's all entirely open. The reason is let's say that I'm trading a breakout.
3545.76s: Versus Drift. The indicators that matter to this versus this will be completely different.
3560.64s: And that's what makes it such an interesting problem to solve for. But the cool part is it's
3566.64s: actually not that hard ultimately to solve for. And I'll show you. Because if we take a look
3573.68s: at the absolutely insane deck that I've made, how long is this thing? This is crazy. This thing is
3584.00s: getting nuts. But if we go to the outlier strategy process, notice what step two is.
3592.72s: Profit mechanism behavior in signals. So it's in the signals where we start to think of the tools
3605.28s: that we're going to use to measure in effect in attempt to try to capitalize on the effect and
3612.88s: monetize it. So this one's really interesting. Because there are definitely some tools that are
3623.12s: just generally useful to have. But when you think about finding the best, and again, this was a
3631.76s: question in the discord earlier, which is it's I understand it completely. That's why I don't say
3636.72s: it's a dumb question or anything like that. It's exactly what I would be looking for as well.
3642.32s: The problem is the way to think about like tools, signals, stuff like that is that it needs to be
3651.04s: in service of something that's defined. So the way that I typically would think about it is not
3657.28s: like what tool is the best. But I would literally start from the perspective of what is the profit
3662.08s: mechanism we're talking about. Then I think we can start outlining what tools might be better
3669.20s: than others. And that's where ads and takes a lot of shape is through that definition process.
3678.00s: So I love that as a topic because it's one I think that a lot of people have a very similar question
3684.72s: on it's it's super common. So definitely can do something there. Justin says I'm not sure if it's
3691.36s: on the list, but an overview of all the indicators you use. I think I have a video. Yeah, thank you, James.
3698.72s: Yeah, I think I have a video on I think there's a playlist called like analysis. It's really not a
3704.88s: view of like all of the tools because anybody that's seen the channel long enough, you know I move
3709.76s: in between stuff, depending on what's going on in the market. But I definitely talk about like the
3714.16s: main ones and stuff like that there. A lot of times what you see on the chart, it looks
3720.72s: crazier than what it really is. Like all of these lines are just different moving averages.
3726.00s: This is a standard deviation channel. This is a volume profile. I was pretty much it. That's up
3731.04s: here. Then down here, it's volume average volume. These are kind of the weird ones. I'll give you
3738.56s: and these are more just because I like I like statistics and I enjoy tracking statistics.
3747.36s: So this one is tracking stuff like price deviation spikes. This one is tracking
3754.56s: vol deviation spikes. And that's pretty much it. So yeah, I think if you have any follow-ups on
3764.72s: that, let me know. Wait, all right, gang. It is about time for me to hop off. As always, if you need
3774.24s: anything, let me know. Be an outlier. See you guys later.
