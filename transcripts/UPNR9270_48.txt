0.00s: What's up outliers, Eric here.
2.04s: We're going to talk about zero DTE strategies
5.40s: for small accounts.
7.28s: For those that don't know, I trade zero DTEs
9.84s: literally every single day.
11.28s: It's a big part of my book.
13.44s: And in general, I think they're very difficult
16.28s: to apply in smaller trading accounts,
18.96s: but the goal of this video is to walk you through
21.20s: a little bit about the background of zero DTEs,
23.76s: how it can make sense.
24.68s: And then to give you some ideas on how it might be able
27.92s: to fit into your portfolio,
29.12s: but it's a tight squeeze.
30.32s: That's all there is to it.
31.16s: I'm thinking of this from the context of like a $10,000
34.24s: account and under, but ideally, we would be trading something
38.20s: way more than that and you'll see why that matters so much.
40.68s: So let's dive straight in and get to it.
43.88s: So what are zero DTE options?
45.52s: Well, there are essentially options
47.04s: that expire the same day.
48.36s: So today's the 10th of September,
50.08s: if I traded, which I did, zero DTEs,
52.32s: it means I trade options that are expiring
54.44s: the very same day.
55.32s: That's all.
56.16s: And what's the idea behind this?
57.80s: Well, a lot of people think it's fast, easy money,
60.32s: which I guarantee you it is anything but that.
63.16s: However, there is a significant opportunity available
67.64s: in zero DTE options.
69.76s: So here are a couple studies that you can take a look at.
72.56s: This is called zero DTE trading rules.
74.88s: And then this one is called retail traders love zero DTE
77.20s: options, but should they?
78.52s: And these talk a bit about the phenomenon of zero DTE options.
82.84s: And I'll explain exactly what this is.
85.32s: And for those that are in the Patreon,
87.56s: you can download I have a file that kind of compiles
90.16s: all of these studies for ease,
91.52s: but these are all free and accessible for everybody.
93.68s: You can just look them up on SSRN.
95.56s: So what's the profit mechanism for zero DTE options?
98.72s: In this case, I'm primarily looking at variance risk premiums.
103.36s: What is that?
104.20s: Simply put, it's the tendency for implied volatility
107.36s: to trend over historic volatility.
110.04s: I have a video that goes into zero DTEs in detail
114.12s: that I'll link to below.
115.36s: It's literally an entire playlist,
116.92s: but there's one specifically called master zero DTE options
119.88s: that I'll share with you so that you can learn
122.68s: way more about the background.
123.96s: I want to kind of build off of that spend less time
126.72s: on the theoretical background and talk about the application.
129.32s: So this is essentially variance risk premiums.
132.00s: And what you'll notice is these yellow lines
133.92s: represent implied volatility, which is forward looking.
136.52s: These white lines represent historic volatility,
138.96s: which is backwards looking.
140.00s: And you'll notice that in general,
141.64s: the yellow lines are above the white lines in general.
145.00s: There will be periods that the white lines come above the yellow lines,
148.72s: but it's not always.
150.32s: And you'll also notice some very specific qualities
152.84s: about the lines when it does that,
154.68s: which we'll talk a little bit about more in detail.
157.64s: So what's going on here?
159.28s: Again, not to rehash the other videos,
161.12s: but to get everybody level set,
162.72s: this is simply the tendency for options to be priced
166.16s: too richly with respect to volatility,
168.84s: compared to what the market ends up moving,
172.20s: which again, that's what historic volatility is.
174.68s: So we're expecting in pricing in more movement
177.88s: than is actually happening.
179.64s: And this is very persistent.
181.60s: Again, you can check out those studies,
183.44s: not take my word for it.
184.72s: I will always do my best to connect you with resources
187.16s: that you can look at for yourself.
189.04s: And if we look back over a longer-term timeframe, again,
191.68s: you'll see that this is generally the case.
194.28s: There will be periods where it's not.
195.56s: Again, take a close look at those periods
197.72s: because it's an important factor.
199.56s: So that's in a nutshell, what zero DTE options are all about.
203.72s: So what's the signal?
204.92s: Exactly what we just talked about.
206.44s: Now, that signal can be caused by event-related things.
210.84s: So maybe an FOMC announcement is coming out
213.40s: and that's driving up volatility
214.80s: or just the overall persistence of variance
217.20s: or spring-moms, which again,
218.20s: is a documented phenomenon.
219.56s: Now, one really important admin note here
222.12s: is for people that sell volatility very often here,
225.04s: the idea of, you know, we sell vol when it's high
227.76s: and buy when it's low.
228.72s: That's actually not exactly correct.
231.16s: It's kind of a simple way to create a rule of thumb,
235.00s: but it's not representative.
236.68s: And I'll show you what that means.
238.12s: Really, this signal and what matters in this case,
241.04s: what we're measuring is IV over HV.
243.96s: This can happen if implied volatility is high
246.80s: or this can happen if implied volatility is low.
250.00s: And I'll show that to you.
251.20s: So if we take a look at this period here,
253.72s: we can see over the past year,
256.20s: which this is what's showing you, again,
258.04s: that's what the aggregation is of the chart,
259.84s: you'll see that this is actually the highest period
262.00s: of volatility over the past year,
264.20s: where short-term vol and then for 30-day vol,
266.76s: it's the second highest compared to this period over here.
269.16s: So volatility on a relative basis
270.80s: is very, very high in this instance.
273.08s: Yet, realize volatility or historic volatility is even higher.
277.24s: So this is an example where if you sold volatility
280.40s: when it's high, it didn't matter
282.28s: because you still got beat out by price.
284.28s: So again, the important is the relationship
287.56s: between implied and historic.
289.96s: That's actually what these purple lines plot for us.
293.20s: I can get rid of all these yellow lines
295.08s: and just have these purple lines
296.36s: because it's charting the difference
298.16s: for the same time frames between these.
299.96s: And again, for those that are in the Patreon,
301.76s: there is a download available in the shop
303.72s: that's free for all Patreon members
305.40s: that has this very thingscript for you.
307.48s: It's one that, as you can tell, I use all the time
310.20s: because it helps me visualize this.
311.84s: So that's the signal.
313.12s: Now, when it comes to capturing,
314.68s: I'm gonna use things like short options.
317.00s: I use short strangles or short straddles,
319.16s: but that's not going to work for small accounts
321.56s: because if you are on a regulation T account,
325.36s: it's gonna be probably hundreds of thousands of dollars.
328.16s: If you wanna sell a 20 Delta short strangle, for example,
331.84s: in SPX.
333.16s: So then we have to think about,
334.72s: and for those that are curious
335.88s: in a portfolio margin account, it's like $75,000.
339.08s: So that's gonna be heavy for most smaller traders.
342.56s: So then how can we think about a way to run this approach?
346.40s: Well, I back tested it for us,
347.84s: so that we have some data that we can look at.
350.12s: Again, the way that I do this is ideally built
354.08s: on a process that's deployed long-term.
356.12s: So that's why back testing something like this,
358.80s: it actually doesn't involve a lot of discretion.
360.80s: It's kind of generally running the strategy.
363.36s: And that's why you'll notice I have this concept
365.96s: of occurrence-based and careful discretion
368.76s: because I am still discretionary.
370.44s: There are certain conditions that,
371.76s: based on my personal strategy, will lead me to enter
374.40s: or not enter or delay in entry,
376.32s: but you have to be so careful about it
378.40s: because the performance of all this specific kind of strategy,
382.04s: it's kind of an aggregate numbers sort of thing.
384.80s: As you have more and more occurrences,
387.00s: the output will approximate towards the value of the strategy.
391.16s: So if you start cutting too many occurrences
393.20s: because of discretion that's skewed in some way,
395.88s: that will drastically impact your results.
398.32s: So using discretion is completely okay,
401.00s: but you have to very carefully track it
402.88s: so that you're not killing the output of the system.
406.12s: So let's take a look at a couple studies.
407.56s: Again, the other videos in the playlist
409.52s: have huge study sets on this.
411.80s: So I'm gonna skip through some of the high points.
413.52s: I already know, based on my studies,
415.48s: that the better entry times are later in the day.
418.00s: So this is looking at Eastern Standard Time,
420.44s: essentially 13, 30, or 1400 entry periods,
423.28s: tend to be best.
424.20s: So I carry that through the study.
425.76s: This is just looking at short calls,
427.84s: deltas, long call, short put, long put deltas,
430.68s: the lot size in this scenario is looking at a too lot.
433.36s: And then these are all gonna be zero DTEs.
435.80s: There's no max profit applied to any of them,
438.36s: but there is a stop loss applied.
439.96s: And again, this is based on what I've seen previously
442.00s: that not having a max profit tends to increase the performance,
445.12s: you can again, go back to the playlist that I referenced
447.52s: before that goes to all of this super foreign detail.
450.04s: So this is looking at a 10 delta strangle, 15 delta strangle,
453.08s: 10 delta strangle, 15 delta strangle,
455.40s: at 13, 30, 1400 respectively.
457.44s: And you can see that these are good performing strategies.
459.76s: The reason why I show you the difference
461.32s: in a half hour between these is to show general robustness
464.72s: around the time frame.
465.60s: Then I take a look at adding wings.
467.88s: So I have a 10, 15 strangle,
470.08s: but I'm buying the five delta wings for both.
473.48s: I do that at 13, 30 and then 1400.
475.96s: You could see at 13, 30, it does not do well.
479.00s: You can see one important difference here though.
481.72s: Take a look at the width of the spread,
483.64s: five points versus 10 points.
485.28s: Take a look at the change in P&L.
487.52s: It's much, much, much higher performing
490.08s: at the wider spread with no P&L management applied.
493.72s: Then when we take a look at 1400, which is, again,
497.76s: I'm just picking a time period.
499.04s: I'm not trying to optimize it heavily.
501.08s: I'm just trying to show you a concept.
503.40s: So if we take a look at 10 delta, 15 delta again,
506.68s: doing the entry at 1400,
508.32s: notice that the performance increases massively
510.92s: for the kind of wider iron condors.
513.96s: Well, really for this.
514.84s: But again, take a look at the width of strikes
517.80s: and take a look at the impact of performance.
519.44s: So the first takeaway you can grab from here
521.36s: is that wider is better.
522.84s: Now, this is going to be dependent
524.40s: on what your account can afford.
526.32s: Because if you're doing something
527.88s: like a 15 delta and five delta,
530.24s: we can look at it together really quick.
532.16s: Let's grab, I'll use a 1DTE.
534.24s: It's not going to matter because it's a defined risk trade.
536.48s: But let's sell this 15 delta and buy the five.
540.44s: And then let's do the same thing on this side.
542.44s: We'll sell the closest to 15 and then we'll buy the five.
546.64s: And then let's take a look at what that grabs us
549.32s: for margin requirements for grand.
551.24s: So even if you have a smaller account,
553.80s: again, if you have a $5,000 account,
555.48s: this is now your entire account in a trade
557.28s: that's kind of dangerous.
558.24s: And the other problem you have is if you have a $5,000 account,
560.88s: you're risking $3,265, which is way too much.
564.68s: So you might have to start playing
567.20s: and that's why I show you with a stop loss
569.44s: and you actually notice it really improves
572.00s: the performance of the strategy for both.
574.00s: Now, a really important note,
575.84s: this is in a frictionless environment.
578.24s: This is not including fees.
579.68s: This is not including spread,
581.04s: which would absolutely chew these to pieces.
584.08s: The performance for all of these will contract meaningfully.
587.12s: So one of the ideas is to decrease
589.08s: occurrences number of trades.
590.56s: It's to decrease the number of legs as much as possible.
593.16s: And we want to try and touch the trade
595.68s: as little as possible once it's on
597.44s: because fees are quite detrimental.
599.60s: Now, the last thing I wanted to show you, however,
601.68s: is that the 10 point Y 20 delta did not perform quite as well.
606.76s: It had a decent win rate, but still underperformed.
609.72s: But again, the 20 delta, five delta
612.40s: without profit management absolutely crushed
615.72s: the 15 delta, five delta without profit management.
619.24s: So there's absolutely an important argument
621.92s: to be made for managing profit on the iron condors
625.60s: or their spreads that are being used.
627.44s: But again, in a non-frictionless environment
630.76s: that includes fees and transaction cost,
632.56s: there is absolutely a cost associated with it.
635.36s: So let's talk about a couple other things really quickly.
638.00s: I want to highlight this path dependence.
640.20s: And I actually asked you to pay attention to this earlier.
642.96s: Path dependence is essentially one of the properties
645.96s: you'll find in returns in general
648.00s: and volatility really amplifies it
649.84s: because volatility does this thing called cluster.
652.16s: Where when it goes through a transition,
654.32s: it tends to hang out in a new place
656.08s: for a little while before it transitions again.
658.04s: So if we take a look at short term volatility,
660.92s: which is the white line and the bright yellow line,
663.96s: you'll notice that when it's breached,
666.04s: it tends to be breached for a few days
668.64s: before it comes back down.
670.00s: So for example, in this case, December 20th,
672.92s: it was still okay with slight VRP.
676.04s: Then on the 21st, we actually turn negative.
679.92s: Then if we go to the 22nd, we're still negative.
683.44s: If we go to the 26th, we're negative,
686.28s: go to the 27th, we're coming back to break even.
689.88s: So what I'm highlighting in this instance is for me,
693.08s: if I get stopped out and I know that volatility
696.40s: is starting to expand, I actually might not place some trades.
700.32s: On additional, that's the discretionary portion
702.68s: because I know volatility tends to cluster.
704.48s: It's very infrequent that you'll see
706.24s: where this white line like this here,
707.60s: where historic volatility exceeds implied
710.20s: and it's only for a day.
711.28s: It's infrequent that I see that.
712.72s: So a lot of the times when I'm trading
714.60s: variance risk premiums, I will wait until
717.60s: historic volatility on a short term timeframe
719.76s: is less than implied volatility.
721.64s: Because again, if you just do it ad nauseam,
724.16s: completely indiscretionary, you'll get these results
726.60s: which are still good, you can optimize them a little bit.
729.04s: So zero DTE for beginners in specifically small accounts,
733.76s: I think that they absolutely can be applied,
736.88s: but they have to be very, very, very carefully used.
740.16s: Because for example, even if you have a $10,000 account,
743.08s: and you look at the 15 and fives,
744.80s: and you're like, wow, that's pretty good,
745.96s: $49,000 return on a two lot.
747.88s: Well, here's the problem.
748.92s: The max loss is 1650.
750.68s: So even if you have a $10,000 account,
753.96s: that's way too big of a loss on an individual trade.
757.40s: Because these again are path dependent
760.32s: and you need a number of occurrences
762.60s: in order for the returns to approximate.
764.96s: So if you have a $10,000 account,
767.44s: you might actually have to look at a slightly suboptimal
770.48s: 10 and five wide, so that your max loss
773.16s: is now contained to 860 bucks,
776.20s: which I actually would argue is still a little bit too high.
778.76s: You might have to be even tighter than that.
781.12s: So the main issue that small accounts
783.52s: are going to find when trading something like this
786.04s: is the ability to put on something that is logical,
789.24s: that makes a decent return,
790.60s: that still captures the benefit of what the structure is
794.84s: and what the profit mechanism is
796.32s: without giving up too much profit
798.80s: in order to reduce max risk.
800.80s: That's the main issue that these are gonna run into.
803.00s: Now, the last thing I wanna highlight is for me,
805.40s: if I'm gonna let them go into expiration,
807.52s: it has to be European style options.
809.52s: If it's not European style options,
811.88s: then you have the risk of assignment
814.20s: and that opens a big problem.
816.20s: The other benefit to using something like SPX
819.04s: as compared to other products,
820.68s: you can use something like XXXSP,
823.56s: which is slightly smaller, it's gonna be less liquid
826.00s: and the problems you're gonna face in this
828.20s: in terms of spreads are gonna be exacerbated,
830.16s: but it's also doable,
831.40s: but the other benefit you get is section 1256 of the tax code
835.52s: where 60% of the gains are gonna be long term,
837.92s: and 40% will be short term, which will be at your rate.
840.68s: The last note is that when it starts to suck
843.72s: is when it's important to keep doing the strategy
846.00s: because the way that this works if you follow the math,
849.04s: on your average win, it's $200,
851.84s: for I'm just picking this 10 Delta here randomly.
854.12s: Your average loss is $4.65.
856.64s: So as soon as you have one loss,
858.04s: it's at least wiped out two wins.
860.48s: And again, that's in a frictionless environment.
862.32s: It probably would be a little bit worse than that.
864.32s: If we're looking at the spreads, it's even worse still.
866.84s: If we're looking at the $10 shorts, $5 longs,
870.84s: you have $107 average win with $220 average loss,
875.68s: not terrible, but then if you're doing the 15 and 5s,
878.20s: to 20 average win, 714 average loss.
881.08s: So really, really difficult to make these up
883.24s: without giving yourself enough runway
885.88s: to get enough occurrences on.
887.40s: So another thing that I like to look at,
889.08s: and I can look at in a future study if we'd want,
891.36s: is the propensity for average losing streaks,
895.24s: so that you have an idea of what that looks like.
897.08s: I use that pretty heavily in all of my strategies,
900.00s: so that I can at least have an understanding
901.88s: of what is likely to occur.
903.92s: It's not limited to that.
905.00s: You can always have longer streaks,
906.24s: but it gives me some ideas.
907.40s: So it doesn't feel like I'm flying quite blind.
909.88s: So hope the video's useful,
911.44s: specifically zero DT options for small accounts.
914.00s: It's a tricky prospect, but can be done.
916.76s: SPX again is the preferable tool, in my opinion,
919.80s: but something like XSP is also viable,
923.16s: and it will trade at a tenth the size as SPX.
926.24s: It'll give you similar performance overall
