0.00s: Today, we're going to talk about my absolute favorite bullish options trading strategy, the
6.00s: ratio call diagonal.
8.84s: I've talked about these before.
10.48s: The goal of this video is to refresh what you've heard, maybe integrate some new data
14.88s: points, and then walk you through holistically how the strategy works.
19.80s: So this is what we're going to cover.
22.44s: What the profit mechanism is, how I think about setting it up, how I manage it, and I'm
27.16s: going to give you an example of a recent trade using this exact strategy.
31.96s: So what is a ratio call diagonal?
36.36s: Well, first, let's start with how it makes money, which is just generally a directional
44.40s: strategy bullish in nature because we want things to go up in this case.
50.12s: And it's really designed to be an equity replacement.
55.68s: So rather than buying shares of a stock, I would run this strategy for very similar
62.94s: thesis.
63.94s: So I'm looking for things that are moving up.
66.72s: So what is the structure for the strategy?
70.64s: Well, it's these pieces here.
73.36s: So I'm going to start with buying to open in the money calls that are typically greater
80.16s: than 60 DTE.
82.00s: Let's talk about this one first.
84.20s: Buy in the money because it gives me better movement with the underlying, which I'll explain
90.48s: what that means.
91.80s: How far in the money for me, typically at the very least 60 delta for the long options,
98.00s: if not further very often, or be 70, 80, something like that.
102.88s: So this is the first leg.
104.52s: The second leg would be short out of the money calls that are generally less than 40 DTE.
111.72s: There's kind of very specific criteria that I use in terms of what delta slash what
117.04s: strike I choose, which we'll talk about.
120.16s: And then there's the optional kicker options that I add to the trade.
126.20s: So this is a way to make a little bit more money if the trade moves big in my favor.
133.76s: So the base for this trade is this right here.
137.28s: It is the long calls.
139.64s: The short calls are an ancillary slash enhancement to the trade.
145.44s: And then the kickers are kind of a tertiary add on.
148.76s: These don't always go on.
150.36s: Neither does the short calls right away.
152.88s: These are also typically phased in.
154.84s: I manage them slightly differently.
156.40s: So this is the entire structure.
159.24s: Now I want to walk through how I actually set this thing up so that you can visualize
164.56s: it with me.
166.44s: Let's hop over to the platform and let's start with the long leg, the long call.
172.76s: So typically I would conduct my standard analysis, whatever that looks like for you and what
179.04s: I'm looking for are things that are going up.
183.04s: So in this case, I look at Nvidia and let's say I have a bullish thesis on it.
187.84s: It looks like it's pulling back.
189.40s: Now to be clear, this actually isn't something I probably would trade with this just being
193.12s: honest, mostly because it looks like it's at a bit of a capitulation point.
197.20s: I would want to see it rallying a bit more and it has earnings coming up.
201.08s: But let's just use it as an example.
203.56s: So let's say that we have a bullish thesis in Nvidia.
207.48s: There's a couple of ways you can trade that.
208.56s: You can just buy stock.
210.44s: That's completely okay.
211.84s: You can use this kind of strategy alternatively.
215.40s: So let's take a look first at that initial leg, the long call.
220.24s: Now you'll notice all these different expiration cycles.
223.64s: And the very first thing as I mentioned is that I like it to be at least 60 DTE if not
229.08s: more.
230.08s: Why is it at least 60?
232.44s: It's very simple.
233.44s: It's because I want to decrease the amount of theta that's bleeding out of the options.
240.20s: And then I also want to give the trade more time to work.
244.56s: So what does that look like?
245.56s: Let's take a look at these 60s.
247.20s: Now if you'll recall from some of my one-on-one videos, if you haven't checked out that playlist,
254.00s: you should.
255.00s: It was a YouTube live series that I did, option trading for beginners.
259.48s: And there's a couple of things that we know.
261.48s: The further you go out in time, the slower theta decays, although the more overall theta
267.84s: there is.
269.40s: So theta in this context is just time value.
273.52s: So when we go out 65 DTE, we are at the very beginning worth theta decays faster, really
279.44s: when it starts closing within 60 DTE.
283.44s: Now when I look at these kinds of positions, you can decrease your theta by going further
289.40s: out in time.
290.56s: The other component is the further in the money you go, the more money you pay, but again,
297.24s: the less theta there is, the less time value.
301.44s: There is in the option, why is that?
304.16s: Because the deeper in the money you go, the more intrinsic value it has, which is simply
310.24s: how far in the money it is, and the less extrinsic value it has.
315.32s: And a quick back-of-the-navagan way of looking at this is, let's say for example, we look
320.12s: at these 50 delta calls, the 122s.
324.28s: This is all extrinsic value.
326.28s: These are completely out of the money.
328.20s: Now if we go to, say for example, these 70 delta calls, they're trading, let's just
334.56s: call it $18 for simplicity.
336.92s: Well, that's $18 total.
339.52s: Of that $18, you can see by looking across to the corresponding out of the money option
345.00s: in this case, the out of the money put.
347.04s: And you can see how much of that roughly is extrinsic value.
352.88s: In this case, that's about six bucks.
355.04s: You can also just do the math, so you can take whatever your strike price is, in this
360.64s: case, the 107, you can subtract your strike price from the current price, and that'll
367.44s: tell you how far in the money it is.
369.52s: So in this case, it's like $11 in the money give or take.
374.04s: So you take $11 out of this, that's your intrinsic value, and then the result is your
380.28s: extrinsic value.
381.48s: So in this case, it's pretty close to this.
384.28s: Just a couple of different ways to do that.
386.68s: So we're now decreasing our theta decay in two different methods by going further out
391.78s: in time and further in the money.
393.64s: Now it's important to understand the drawbacks because this is more expensive.
398.04s: And if you get an unfavorable move against you, you have more potential loss than if you
405.48s: buy a cheaper option.
406.64s: So again, for example, if I buy this 50 delta call for $1,000, okay, that's my max risk,
413.56s: whatever I pay.
414.84s: In this case, if I buy the 70 delta call, I'm paying $18, my max risk is now $1,800.
422.48s: The reason why this doesn't bother me is because I'm going to manage the trade.
427.40s: So it's not going to come down to that.
429.56s: But you should know that that exists just so that you understand how the strategy works.
434.20s: So now let's figure out what the theta decay is.
436.28s: In this case, it's $0.9 per day or $9 out of this total value.
443.56s: And just for comparison sake, let's say instead of the 65, we go out to like 190 DTE.
450.56s: Let's look at the same 70 delta call.
453.96s: And you'll notice that the theta decay for these is 5 cents a day.
457.80s: And then just an inverse, let's say we go into this 37 DTE expiration.
463.00s: We look at those same 70 delta calls.
465.64s: And the risk of the theta decay is 13 cents or $13 per day.
470.36s: So this is why I like going at the very least 65 or 60 days out, 65 plus in this case,
477.96s: just because it's the next primary expiration.
480.60s: Now, a couple of the things with respect to expiration selection is I prefer primary
486.60s: expirations, meaning monthly.
489.04s: And it's because they tend to be more liquid.
490.88s: I have another video that talks about option liquidity inside and out and all the ins and outs of it.
496.80s: So you can check that out to understand more of the details there.
499.72s: But suffice it to say monthly expirations will have more liquidity.
503.76s: So that brings us into most of the details around the long option.
510.12s: But there's a couple more that we have to solve for.
514.12s: So let's say we don't want to go to 65 because we know that if we hold it for, you know,
520.00s: two weeks will be in the steeper component of theta decay.
523.88s: So if we're expecting to hold this trade for a month or two, maybe we go out here to the 15.
528.80s: No, notice how I'm integrating how long I think I'm going to hold the trade for.
532.80s: That's the nature of being an options trader.
534.92s: Our positions are time bound.
536.84s: So I'm going to estimate how long I think I'm holding this position for.
540.48s: So if we go this 93 DTE and then we go in to the 71 delta.
546.64s: Why the 71 delta?
548.16s: Well, if you take a look again, it's for liquidity.
551.40s: This is a slightly more liquid strike than the surrounding strikes.
558.08s: So also why this delta, why not these further out of the money delta is that are cheaper.
564.60s: Well, it's because these will move better dollar for dollar with the underlying.
571.76s: So the higher your delta, the more expensive your option is.
575.56s: But it also means you're going to see more of the move at a given point in time.
580.52s: So in this case, if Nvidia goes up a dollar, I'm going to see $71 of a move.
586.00s: So I don't see that full $1, $100 if you're using 100 lots.
590.04s: I don't see that full dollar.
591.24s: I see 71 cents, but I see the majority of it.
594.64s: Whereas if you go further out of the money, if you grab one of these cheaper options,
598.88s: that's a 30 delta.
600.16s: Well, if Nvidia moves that dollar, you only see 30 cents.
604.24s: What's the benefit of these further out of the money options?
607.56s: Well, they typically have higher gamma.
610.60s: Now you'll notice that these options that are really far out in time all have really
614.76s: low gamma.
616.68s: Gamma is the rate of change of delta.
618.96s: This is how you see those options that compound thousands of percent because of gamma.
624.56s: So in this case, I wouldn't look to add those kicker options this far out in time.
631.24s: We'll talk about those in a little bit, but those kicker options are designed to expose
634.84s: us to gamma, that compounding effect.
637.96s: So let's recap this long option.
641.56s: Let's see what it looks like.
643.52s: If we buy 10 of those 15 no of 105 calls that we were looking at, and we look at this
651.96s: option, we'll see that it has defined risk to the downside, and you'll see that it has
658.76s: unlimited profit potential up until the right, generally positively sloping, just like
664.36s: long stock.
666.00s: So this is the base of the position.
668.40s: Now let's compare that to something like buying a thousand shares of Nvidia.
675.88s: You'll notice that just long stock has unlimited downside potential, same upside potential
680.76s: give or take, but notice the difference that the positions cost in order to put on.
687.48s: If we buy a thousand shares of Nvidia at spot, which is 117.29, that means you're going
693.32s: to have to put up a hundred and 17 thousand dollars, two hundred and ninety bucks to put
696.84s: that trade on.
698.20s: If I want to gain access to similar exposure via the 10 105 calls, the amount that I'm
705.80s: putting up for that position is a fraction of that cost.
709.40s: So in this case, it would be 2140 times your 10 times 100, so it would be 21 thousand
718.80s: dollars.
720.04s: So it's much cheaper to put the position on with options.
724.60s: This is where the leverage comes from.
726.36s: I'm controlling essentially the same size position slightly less, and if you know why it's slightly
732.24s: less, throw it in the comments, and then I'll answer why it's slightly less.
736.64s: The reason why is because long stock is Delta 1, meaning this is going to act like 1,000
741.72s: shares right out of the gate.
743.68s: This 10 lot at the 105 is not actually Delta 1.
748.00s: So if we go to 15, no 93 days out, and if we go to these 105s, you'll notice something
756.24s: very different.
757.68s: These are a 71 Delta.
760.00s: So this means that your 1 lot gives you access up to 100 shares.
766.76s: That's if the Delta is a 1, that would be 100 shares.
769.72s: So in this case, your Delta is 71.
772.36s: So that means every 1 lot you have is actually behaving like 71 shares.
778.12s: So in this case, this would be more so like 710 shares of Nvidia versus the 1000.
787.16s: That's why those look slightly different when you compare the risk profiles on them.
792.40s: So small admin note doesn't make a huge difference, but you should know that your exposure whenever
797.64s: you put the trade on in the beginning is going to be relative to your Delta's, not what
802.48s: it can be up to, which is up to controlling 100 shares equivalent per 1 lot.
810.24s: So that's the long option.
812.24s: Now let's take a look at the kicker options.
815.80s: The kicker options get added when I have strong conviction in something's going to move.
821.84s: And the reason is what I talked to you about before because they have the ability to compound
826.16s: massively.
827.76s: So if we go to these closer to at the money options here and you'll see that if I look
834.20s: at like these 32 Delta options that are 27 days to expiration, the 132s here, they have
843.12s: a 2 Delta.
844.56s: So that means that as Nvidia moves in my favor $1, I'm going to see 32 cents of the move
851.76s: and my Delta's are going to grow by 2.
853.80s: So this will go from 32 to 34 and so on and so forth as they get more and more moves
858.80s: in my favor.
860.36s: So by adding the kicker option, it gives your trade a pretty significant compounding
868.32s: capability, but you're holding something that's decaying relatively quick.
873.04s: So for example, looking at these 132s again, if we take a look at the theta decay on those,
879.72s: it's 12 cents or $12.
882.44s: So you're going to lose 12 cents of your $4.35 every single day.
888.00s: And this is because they're still pretty far out in time.
890.36s: As this gets closer and closer to expiration, let's take a look at these nine DTEs, go
894.84s: to like a 30 Delta for an equivalent, notice that the theta decay now is like 20 cents,
899.72s: 22 cents.
901.36s: So these options are like $2.
903.36s: It's like 10% that's decaying away.
906.60s: So you have to be really careful when you're adding kicker options or trading out of the
909.92s: money options like that, it's kind of like playing hot potato.
912.84s: You got to be really, really thoughtful about those positions because they're decaying
916.68s: in front of your hands very quickly.
919.60s: So that's the kicker options in a nutshell.
922.24s: If you really have strong conviction, if I do, I'll add them, but it's a really small
927.72s: part of the trade.
928.72s: It's much smaller allocation than the total trade gets.
932.04s: Then let's take a look at the short option.
934.00s: So if you go back here, you'll remember that we're looking at short out of the money
937.08s: calls.
938.08s: So when do those get added?
939.28s: Well, sometimes they get added at the onset of the trade.
944.28s: Sometimes they get layered on as the trade moves.
947.80s: The way I think about the short calls is that they're again secondary.
952.80s: It helps me offset the cost of theta.
957.00s: So if we take a look at this 20 September expiration cycle, and we go to an option that's
961.88s: out of the money.
963.04s: So maybe like these 134s, I tend to pick something around a 30 delta, 20 to 30 delta,
968.48s: somewhere in there on the initial.
970.88s: And let's take a look at what these do for us.
974.20s: They bring in about $385.
977.96s: So if we think about what the theta decay is on our 15 no one oh fives, and this shows
986.96s: us our theta decay is $0.7 per day.
990.32s: So $7 per contract.
992.56s: We have 10 contracts.
993.56s: So we're losing $70 per day in theta.
997.48s: And if I take a look at these short calls, well, realistically right out of the gate,
1003.56s: one of them, if I collect this $385, we'll cover the cost of my theta, at least for a little
1010.20s: bit.
1012.00s: Not entirely, right?
1013.00s: It's just one day of theta that I'm calculating there.
1016.00s: So but that's just for a one lot.
1018.04s: So if we take a look at what this trade looks like, once we layer in some of these short
1022.72s: calls, it kind of takes this kind of shape.
1026.00s: So one thing you'll notice that's very different about the way that I trade and why they're
1030.16s: called ratio, called diagonals, is in this case, you'll notice that there are 10 of the
1037.12s: long options, but only three of the short options.
1041.92s: Why is that?
1042.92s: Why would I do that?
1043.92s: Well, it's because this short option component, it gives me some money upfront.
1050.88s: It gives me a credit upfront.
1053.52s: So in this case, I would get my $385 times three contracts.
1061.00s: So it gives me some money upfront.
1062.80s: But the downside is you'll notice that it adds this little kink to my return profile.
1070.24s: And you notice that that's right about where that short strike is.
1074.40s: So when I'm collecting this credit upfront, it's at the expense of profitability.
1079.52s: So let's use this 140 handle for an example.
1082.60s: With these three short options against the position, this trade would make $14,894.
1090.88s: If I get rid of that option and I go back to these 140s, the trade makes $17,924.
1097.32s: So you notice that these slow things down a bit.
1100.92s: Now they help me if there's not as big of a move.
1105.68s: So for example, let's take a look at this 120 area ish.
1110.28s: The 120s, I would make about $1550 with the short option.
1115.92s: If I get rid of it and I go to the 120, I make $16.35 if it goes there tomorrow.
1124.56s: If it doesn't, notice how this purple line which represents today and this blue line represents
1129.64s: that expiration.
1131.16s: Notice the difference here.
1132.76s: Each day this purple line is going to move towards the blue line.
1137.92s: So if that move doesn't happen quick enough, I actually would start to slowly lose money.
1142.76s: Notice the difference when I add that short option.
1145.76s: It actually helps me.
1146.92s: My break even is improved pretty significantly because of the money this brings in.
1151.92s: So how do I think about the short option?
1154.24s: It's very simple.
1155.84s: The trade off is do I want to collect more money upfront or do I want to prioritize capital
1163.96s: growth?
1164.96s: Those are the two choices.
1167.24s: If I want to collect more money upfront, I will sell more of these and I can collect
1172.24s: more money upfront.
1174.24s: Notice though how I have to be careful how many I sell.
1177.52s: So if you sell too many, you can actually be too right and lose money.
1183.24s: This is what a more standard diagonal P&L graph will look like.
1187.56s: Where if it goes too far in your favor, you actually can start losing money.
1191.36s: I don't want that.
1192.72s: And that's part of the reason why you'll see me use these ratios and some of the things
1197.32s: I'll show you in a little bit.
1199.00s: Make sure that I have no upside risk in the trade.
1202.08s: I do not want to lose money if I'm too right.
1206.28s: Super, super annoying.
1208.92s: The way I think about it is in general, if I'm putting on the trade for a long thesis,
1215.88s: I want to give the long options the best chance for success.
1220.24s: So that means I'm typically going to air on the lighter side of shorts against the
1225.44s: longs.
1226.44s: Now something I'll do with the shorts is roll them out and up for a credit if possible if
1232.28s: they fall in the money.
1235.48s: If things move too fast, you can't always do that.
1238.80s: So it's important to think about that ahead of time.
1241.48s: So those are the legs, essentially, that I look at.
1245.84s: So now let's talk about the products.
1247.36s: What kind of products do I trade?
1249.76s: Realistically, it's going to require really liquid underlines because one of the things
1254.92s: with liquidity is the further out in time you go, the less liquid the options get.
1261.64s: You'll notice that the bid-ask spreads get wider and wider the further out in time you
1266.12s: go.
1267.36s: So I have to trade things that are liquid.
1270.28s: In general for me, that's going to be S&P 500 stocks.
1273.80s: It's going to be ETFs.
1275.20s: It's going to be sector ETFs.
1277.84s: Things that have really, really strong underlying and then also option liquidity.
1283.28s: And again, you can reference that video I mentioned earlier if you have questions on what's
1287.88s: liquid or how to find something that's liquid.
1290.56s: So that's the first thing.
1292.44s: The other thing I'm going to look for are things that are generally moving up, things that
1297.00s: are showing strength and moving in the direction that I want.
1301.04s: What I don't want to do with this strategy is to try to bottom dip too much because it's
1307.16s: really, really difficult to manage that because you have to have really effective capital
1312.56s: management.
1313.56s: Because again, remember, when I'm going further out in time and I'm spending more money
1319.44s: on the option so that I can get a better delta, I don't want to actually risk all of
1324.68s: that.
1325.68s: I'm going to try to manage it.
1327.32s: So that's why it's so important for me to have a pretty solid management plan in place
1331.32s: for the capital.
1333.00s: So the products really simple, typically S&P 500 stocks, things that have liquid options
1339.80s: chains, ETFs.
1342.00s: It's not limited to that.
1343.32s: I absolutely will trade things that don't necessarily have like weekly option expirations
1347.76s: for example, but in general, that's what I'm going to do.
1352.48s: Now let's talk about the management.
1354.60s: In the overall goal of the strategy, it's to trend follow.
1358.96s: It's to follow something that's moving up.
1362.00s: Now you'll notice that there's a portion where we can have these out of the money calls
1367.20s: that then fall in the money if it goes in our favor.
1371.56s: So for example, going back to this, we have short calls at 134.
1376.84s: So if we get to a point where those short calls are in the money, we now have something
1380.72s: that we at least have to deal with in some capacity.
1384.24s: So there's different ways you can manage those short calls.
1387.20s: You can close them down for a loss.
1389.24s: I do that sometimes if it's a very small loss, not very frequently.
1393.92s: The other choice is to roll them out and up to increase your basis if possible.
1399.84s: I do that pretty regularly.
1403.28s: If you're using the short calls as a way to slowly unwind your trade, what I prefer
1408.44s: to do is as I close the short calls, I will sell long calls to cover the cost of the
1417.64s: short calls.
1419.20s: So what would that look like?
1420.84s: Let's say that I sold these calls for $3.80 and let's say when the underlying is trading
1428.12s: at 140, let's just say that these are now trading at $5.
1431.48s: So I'm losing $1.20.
1433.48s: Well, what I'm going to do is take that $1.20, multiply it out by how many contracts
1438.32s: I have that tells me what the overall loss is going to be times 100 on the trade.
1443.76s: And then I'm going to sell enough long calls to cover the cost of the short calls.
1450.32s: This is a way for me to unwind the position as it's doing what I want and to make sure
1454.72s: that I'm not realizing losses on one part of the trade and not realizing gains on the
1462.44s: offsetting part of the trade because what really sucks is if you take those calls down for
1467.88s: a loss because you want it to go up more because you want to make more money, but then it
1471.40s: goes down.
1472.92s: Now you've made less money on the long calls.
1474.76s: You've already realized the loss on the short calls.
1476.72s: You're creating a problem for yourself.
1478.72s: So the cliff notes version of the short call management is really simple.
1482.32s: In general, I'm just going to try to roll out and up.
1484.88s: If I can't roll out and up, then I will sell long calls to cover the cost of the short
1490.04s: calls pretty much it.
1492.24s: And we need to talk about this thing called the critical strike.
1496.64s: So let's get a better idea of the total profile of what this thing looks like.
1501.96s: This is using another ticker.
1503.40s: This is using rut, which is actually what the example is going to be in.
1507.64s: This gives you an idea of how the overall product behaves.
1511.88s: We talked about a lot of this stuff already.
1514.04s: The main thing here is just to remember that P&L in the trade is managed via technical
1519.32s: analysis for me.
1520.96s: And then I fit positions to it.
1523.12s: So what that means in this case is say, for example, I'm trading in video.
1528.24s: I'm not going to pick an arbitrary loss on my options to get out of the trade.
1532.60s: I'm going to look at the underlying.
1534.28s: I'm going to say, okay, it's starting to rebound.
1536.80s: Maybe I think it's starting to slow some strength.
1538.80s: I'm not positive about it.
1540.52s: But let's say that I think that there's support somewhere around this one 10 handle.
1546.32s: Maybe somewhere 111 ish using one of these volume nodes like right here.
1551.00s: So let's say it's like right there.
1552.64s: I'll get rid of this one to get rid of the noise.
1556.32s: Let's say that becomes my floor.
1558.40s: So that essentially means that the underlying right now is at 118.
1562.36s: And I have like a seven point downside in this configuration.
1565.48s: It'd be really high probability of getting stopped out here.
1568.36s: But let's just say that that's the downside.
1569.96s: So what I would do now is say that's where I think resistance is.
1574.04s: If it falls below that and let's say it cracks below 110 giving it a little bit of extra
1578.24s: room to move, then it's time to get out.
1581.12s: So then what I'm going to do is go into the analyzed tab or just do the math.
1584.84s: You can do either.
1585.84s: And I'm going to see what the PNL would be at 110.
1590.28s: In this case, I would be down 4256 bucks.
1594.08s: And I'm going to say, how do I feel about that?
1596.80s: How does that fit within the portfolio?
1598.28s: Is that too much too little?
1599.76s: Do I have enough capital at risk to make this trade make sense?
1602.40s: Well, I also need to understand another part of this equation.
1605.16s: Where do I think it's going to go?
1606.16s: Where's the upside?
1607.56s: Here, it looks like the first stop is somewhere in here, like maybe the 122 handle.
1614.08s: So then I get to say, what do I make if it hits 122?
1617.44s: We go to the analyzed tab.
1619.36s: We run over here to 122 and we would make 3000 bucks ish.
1626.20s: So what's the probability of me hitting 122 versus 110?
1631.00s: Again, you can either do the math or you can use the options change to solve this or you
1634.84s: can use something like this.
1636.72s: And I could say, okay, well, maybe over the next 30 days, I'm curious what's the probability
1641.36s: of me hitting 111.
1643.24s: In that case, it's 81%, almost essentially going to happen.
1647.16s: That's the probability of me hitting 122.
1649.88s: In this case, it's 83% 0.5, even better than the downside.
1653.92s: So you can see what the expected return is based on your near term and then target projections,
1661.00s: whatever those are.
1662.00s: So you can have a near term target like this.
1663.96s: This looks like where the first stop might be.
1665.92s: And then if it gets through there, it looks like the second stop might be somewhere up here,
1669.40s: like 128.
1670.40s: And you can see based on the probabilistic assessment you have on those directions, what size
1675.28s: makes sense for your portfolio?
1676.72s: This is how I size the trades.
1679.24s: So that's the idea of managing the PNL via TA, then making sure that the size makes sense
1686.48s: for the risk that I have on.
1688.16s: So let's talk about this idea of critical strike.
1690.12s: This is an example of kind of a trade lock that I built for these.
1693.84s: This is available for all the outlier pro members that are interested in it.
1697.28s: And for those that are in there, that's okay.
1700.04s: You can kind of build your own by modeling off of what you see here.
1704.36s: So what I'll do is I'll figure out how much money I want to give a trade, all that
1708.00s: kind of jazz.
1709.60s: Then there's a couple things on here I really want to draw your attention to though.
1713.04s: This first one here is this idea of a critical strike.
1715.64s: What is a critical strike?
1717.24s: Well it ensures that where we sell or short option is not potentially locking in a loss.
1725.08s: So it in the beginning is very easy.
1728.68s: When you first buy your long options in this case, as long as you sell short options that
1735.76s: are essentially out of the money when you come in here, then it'll be okay to the upside,
1742.28s: depending on what ratio you pick, which we'll talk next, but it's not locking in a loss.
1747.00s: Where it starts getting confusing is if in video goes down a little bit.
1751.96s: So let's say instead of it being at 118, it drops down here to 113.
1755.68s: You're still on the trade, but it's going down.
1757.92s: So you have to be a little more careful with what strike price you pick.
1763.00s: Otherwise you essentially commit the equivalent of going into here.
1770.60s: Let me show you.
1772.08s: You commit the equivalent of selling short calls below your long option basis.
1779.00s: Get this up here so you can see it.
1780.96s: So in this example, the long option basis is 117.29.
1785.92s: So what you don't want is then to sell short calls below that basis.
1790.84s: So the whole point of the critical strike is it makes sure that whatever strike you're
1795.52s: selecting keeps you from doing that.
1798.88s: Now there's an easy way to do this as well.
1801.28s: Again, if you have a platform like Thinkerswim, it'll do it for you.
1804.56s: So for example, let's say in video moves around and let's say that we're not looking at
1808.80s: these 134s anymore.
1809.80s: You're like, okay, where can I sell these short calls?
1812.44s: And you're like, well, I want to be really aggressive for whatever reason.
1815.04s: I'll say you wanted to sell these 115s.
1817.08s: You're like, he's like, okay, can I sell these 115s?
1819.84s: Well, if you look at 115, that strike on the P&L graph, that gives you, that's a problem
1827.96s: because it locks in a loss.
1829.80s: Those short calls produce a loss unless you do something about them.
1834.80s: So your platform can help you with that or again, something like this can.
1838.64s: So what I do is I take the long option basis, whatever I got in it at, I take out the
1847.04s: long option value, whatever it's currently trading at, divide that by the long option
1850.92s: delta as it sits right now and I add the current stock price.
1855.40s: So in the example that I gave for the right, this tells me that regardless of where the
1860.68s: rut trading at that point in time, that I essentially need to be above this number in order
1867.64s: to not have upside risk on the short options.
1870.92s: That's all.
1871.92s: So this tells me what strike I can sell the short call at and not have upside risk, not
1876.44s: lock in a loss at where I'm at.
1878.16s: There's two other things in here that matter to me.
1880.92s: The number of short call lots is a really simple formula here.
1885.52s: So I take the number of long options I have times the long option delta.
1889.32s: So literally all that's doing is accumulating my total delta.
1892.16s: And again, your platform will do that for you.
1894.92s: So if I take a look down here, this right here, you see this 71292, it tells you your
1901.28s: total delta.
1903.24s: So in this case, we want to make sure that we never have a scenario that our short call
1909.72s: delta is overwhelmed our long call delta.
1913.00s: So what that looks like here is if I click this and let's say that instead of selling
1916.40s: four, I want to sell a bunch more.
1918.28s: Well, if I sell five, then I have 146 delta's.
1923.12s: If I sell six, now I have 176 delta's.
1927.48s: So you see how this number changes because the other thing you have to remember, again,
1931.44s: with these short options is if I sell them and then the underlying starts rallying against
1940.64s: me, remember, there's gamma.
1943.80s: So if it moves against me $1, then I lose 29 cents.
1948.80s: But I also gain one delta.
1953.04s: So now it's going to be 30.
1954.80s: Then if it moves against me another dollar, now I'm going to gain two delta's.
1959.48s: So one and so forth.
1960.68s: That's what leads the compounding that can cause you problems.
1965.08s: So for example, if this ratio becomes too high, what that tells you is that after a big
1971.64s: enough move against your long options, your short option delta's overwhelm your long
1978.52s: option delta's because the other thing to remember is as these are going against you,
1985.00s: your long options are going to cap out sooner or later, right?
1988.96s: Because they can only go to a one delta.
1991.04s: So there's starting at a 71 delta and I have a little bit of delta that I can gain.
1996.96s: But once they get to a one delta per lot, that's all they can be at.
2001.00s: So the whole idea behind the short call lots is just to make sure that you're not selling
2006.24s: too many so that you're not creating upside risk.
2010.48s: And again, your platform can also tell you this.
2013.44s: And the last thing here is the adjusted long call basis.
2017.32s: This helps me calculate what the current basis is if I'm accounting for in the money short
2024.04s: options so that I make sure as I'm trading around the position, I fully understand
2030.96s: what the actual basis is for the long calls as I'm selling them to cover the short calls.
2038.88s: That's all.
2039.88s: And it feeds into the rest of these numbers slightly depending on what you're trying to track.
2046.96s: But the adjusted long call basis, it lets me know capturing this cost of closing in the
2055.12s: money short options.
2057.56s: And I'm using these long options to cover the cost.
2061.08s: It gives me the adjusted basis accounting for all of that.
2063.84s: And again, your platform can do this for you.
2066.20s: All right, let's take a quick look at an example, pretty simple one actually.
2070.96s: So on the 11th of July, the Russell started to break up and out.
2076.32s: I was waiting for this for a while.
2078.12s: So in this case, I went in and I bought 10 of the 20 September 2050 calls for 120 80.
2085.24s: So again, you can figure out the DTE from here.
2087.84s: This was a shorter duration ratio call diagonal because I expected the move to be pretty
2093.08s: heavy, but I wanted to give enough time to work around, but not a tonne.
2096.72s: And these were over a 70 delta.
2099.36s: So then notice that there's no short call yet.
2102.40s: It's because I was expecting this to be a pretty strong up move.
2106.84s: And my goal was to add the short calls when things slowed down right here.
2113.52s: So from the 11th of July, I did nothing.
2115.76s: I bought these and did nothing.
2117.80s: Then on the 17th of July, I decided to sell to open five of the 16 August.
2124.32s: So about a month, DTE, 2350 calls.
2128.24s: So these are pretty far out of the money.
2130.20s: These were around a 30 delta at the time for 2710.
2134.60s: So notice what I did here.
2136.44s: I bought when it was breaking out and then I waited until it started to slow down.
2142.44s: And that's when I chose to sell the short calls.
2144.96s: Again, remember, the short calls are secondary to the long calls.
2149.32s: So you don't have to automatically put them on at the same time.
2152.60s: There's no forcing function there for you.
2156.40s: So I took in 13,550 from that trade.
2159.88s: Then it was time to hang out for a little bit.
2162.44s: Then the Russell started to play games with my heart and it started to come down.
2168.56s: So I was just like, oh, interesting.
2171.68s: Need to adjust here.
2173.44s: So what I did was, and it's because we started falling down below this support level.
2178.92s: You can see that I draw them as the product moves so that I'm calculating where I'm
2186.08s: watching things.
2187.92s: So I saw it flirting below that level and I wanted to see if we would get a close and
2192.00s: then we actually got an open and a close below it.
2194.68s: So on the 19th, I sold to close five of these 20 September, 2050 calls for 179 that gave
2202.80s: me 29,100 in profit on those options.
2207.20s: So it's essentially taking the move from here to here on the long calls.
2211.04s: And notice, I only took down half.
2213.84s: Then I decided to take two of the 16-Ogged 2350s down for 1040.
2220.40s: This gave me a profit of 3350.
2223.00s: Why did I take down two if I had five?
2224.84s: It's because I want to keep the ratio intact.
2229.56s: Remember that ratio I talked to you about.
2231.36s: I don't want to cap my upside.
2233.04s: I never want short calls to equal long calls.
2236.16s: So in this case, I took five of my 10 down that gave me five long calls left.
2240.68s: I don't want five short calls against five long calls.
2243.80s: I want my upside.
2245.72s: So I take some of these down.
2248.16s: So this gave me a realized PN all at this point of 32,480.
2252.72s: Then on 22 July, it started to move back up.
2256.76s: So it looked like a little bit of a head fake.
2258.76s: I decided to start scaling back into the trade.
2261.76s: So in this case, I bought to open three more of the 20 September 2050 calls for 180, 35.
2267.48s: I picked the same strike because it's a little easier.
2269.32s: Don't have to do it.
2270.32s: It's kind of my preference.
2272.76s: In this case, that took my total debit on this trade of 54,105.
2277.64s: And we're now just cruising along.
2280.88s: Now, one important note as I'm figuring out the sizes for these trades,
2284.56s: like any standard trade, the initial step always includes the initial allocation
2290.32s: and then the scaling.
2291.84s: As I mentioned, I wanted to start with about the max size I was going to give this trade.
2296.44s: So in this case, you'll notice that's why I started with 10.
2298.84s: In this case, I only added three because they're more expensive now.
2302.40s: I'm being very careful to stay within my initial allocation and scaling rules.
2308.20s: So then the unwind on the first of August, we had this big giant red down day.
2313.88s: So the next trade was selling five of the 20 September 2050 calls for 280.
2321.88s: So that was earlier in the day when we were up here, just as we broke below this support.
2328.12s: So that netted 40,000 bucks.
2330.76s: And I closed out the remaining three calls at that point.
2334.04s: Again, going back, I do not want to have three long calls and three short calls.
2339.56s: So I just took the three calls down because I kind of had a suspicion.
2342.88s: I was going to be getting out of this trade based on the velocity.
2345.96s: But at this point, I took a pause and that's where you see this PNL here was up until this point, all this stuff.
2354.28s: Then we fell below the next support level I had, which was right here.
2361.84s: So as soon as we fell below that there, I closed the rest of the position.
2366.28s: So I closed the three that I bought here, closed them down here, and I bought them for 180, 35.
2373.60s: And I sold them for 175, 30.
2376.20s: So I took a loss of 15, 15.
2378.52s: So on the total trade, it takes me to a profit of 76K, 63% return on a vested capital.
2384.12s: This is one of those instances where as you could tell, it's not like this crazy big 3,000% return on the money.
2390.84s: But it's a solid overall gross return.
2394.04s: And a lot of this is fueled by the initial outlays that I gave, which were a little more expensive, right?
2399.36s: $121,000 to put the trade on.
2401.88s: But it's still a solid return on the position.
2404.52s: It's just a slightly different style of trading than trying to compound massively.
2408.12s: So this is just another recent example of the ratio called diagonals.
2412.12s: There's an entire playlist on these.
2414.44s: I'll link to in the notes below for you.
2416.92s: But as always, if there's any questions, let me know, be an outlier.
2420.28s: See you guys later.
