690.00s:  from here, the COT report.
697.20s:  So if you take a look at the COT report, there's an important trend to identify here.
710.40s:  Take a look at large speculators.
715.84s:  What happened today?
717.32s:  For large speculators.
719.16s:  If I move this into a one year, so it's a little easier to see, what do you notice?
724.96s:  Large speculators is the green line plummeted.
730.40s:  So while the market rallied a little bit today, large speculators largely exited future
741.16s:  positions, specifically this one in S&P.
745.12s:  So this is all floating into the small element of residual strength that we saw today.
752.88s:  And yet again, an important context clue.
756.56s:  This is the game of trading.
758.32s:  The game of trading is understanding what typically happens when and then identifying conditions
766.24s:  that start to vary from that.
769.00s:  Funny enough, that's actually one of the things that you and I talked about in the
772.56s:  podcast that I released this last Sunday, where he and I connected the week prior.
778.44s:  And we talked about that exact function.
781.32s:  And it's because that's a really significant part of what we do as traders is we monitor
786.52s:  what tends to happen.
787.88s:  And then when other things happen, they stick out to us.
791.00s:  This is one of them.
792.28s:  The market rallying like it did today and seeing the pretty strong unwind from speculators
800.32s:  is important to keep in mind.
802.24s:  What it tells us is that they're not fully buying the rally.
805.56s:  And this is obviously an expectation of continued downside, which I still think broadly
811.44s:  is likely going to be the case, at least in the near term until we get through the rest
815.68s:  of the whole tariff scenario.
819.24s:  So that's what I'm seeing from a broader sector lens.
825.72s:  A couple of the things that drew my eye, the overall breadth looks bad.
834.16s:  So if we take a look at net highs lows, you can see exactly the game that's going on
840.60s:  today for the NASDAQ, the net is negative 642, which is about the largest it's been.
850.00s:  And then if we take a look at the New York stock exchange, it's negative 228, which
854.56s:  again, if we look at this comparatively, just kind of draw that line across here.
858.68s:  The last time it was at that was on the third of March, which is this day up here.
863.52s:  So market breadth here looks weak.
867.64s:  Now funny enough, Trin is starting to look healthy.
872.52s:  It's another breadth indicator.
874.52s:  I still wouldn't consider this healthy yet, but this is really tied also partially to
880.12s:  what you're seeing from something like the skew index here, which is funny enough, not
888.44s:  as excessive as we might have thought if the market was really gearing up for a potential
896.24s:  like significant unwind.
898.52s:  So Joey says, Tommy says large spec strapped off.
905.28s:  That's exactly right.
906.28s:  Good eyeball on that.
907.28s:  Joey says with such large amounts of uncertainty, why is the move in VIX relatively muted?
913.88s:  Well, because it's, I mean, it's not muted.
917.52s:  That's the thing.
918.72s:  It's just we're not in an environment where VIX would be excessively elevated, necessarily
928.48s:  but if you take a look at where VIX is today, like this, this isn't muted by, by any stretch
935.52s:  of the imagination.
937.04s:  VIX opened today at 24.
939.64s:  And if we look across over the past year, there was one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
949.56s:  eight, nine, ten.
952.28s:  So maybe 12 days total, assuming I missed a couple that VIX even crossed above
958.44s:  that handle, let alone closed above that handle.
963.04s:  So I actually think that's more of a perspective element than anything, but I definitely would
970.44s:  not say that VIX is muted here.
974.84s:  It's, I actually think VIX is appropriately placed here.
977.88s:  I don't think it's, I don't think it's excessive either, but I don't think it's muted.
984.60s:  Derek good to see you.
985.88s:  VIX says question.
988.04s:  Newton said, GME's short interest is 99% in his video this morning.
993.68s:  What's your opinion?
994.68s:  I don't really think there's an opinion on that, right?
997.48s:  Like I think we can just look up short interest and see what it is.
1000.84s:  So let's take a look.
1001.84s:  GME short interest.
1004.32s:  I can tell normally has this.
1009.92s:  This has 7% of float with point eight two days to cover, which is actually a little lighter
1018.00s:  than I would have expected.
1019.00s:  Let's try one other resource.
1020.68s:  We'll take a look at market beat.
1027.00s:  They say 7.2%.
1033.96s:  And let's check out, oops, one more.
1040.48s:  Take a look at Benzingo.
1046.48s:  And Benzingo shows short interest at 7.5a.
1054.00s:  So typically what I do in these is I kind of just eyeball the difference between them
1057.16s:  and pick something towards the middle as long as there's not a massive change.
1061.96s:  So it looks like it'd be in like the mid-sevens as far as I'm concerned in terms of short interest
1067.48s:  as percent of float.
1069.12s:  I'm not really sure the context, Jesse, on short interest being 99%.
1074.96s:  I didn't catch that video.
1077.12s:  But based on the data that we have available, that doesn't look to be the case.
1081.68s:  It looks like it's actually single digits, which does seem a little low to me.
1089.44s:  But it's also really hard to tell with all the synthetics and stuff available.
1093.12s:  So there's probably a little more context behind the statement that I just don't have.
1099.12s:  So yeah.
1100.72s:  Anyways, this is frozen.
1104.32s:  Let's unfreeze.
1106.48s:  Jesse says watches video that he made his morning.
1108.64s:  I probably won't to be honest with you, but yeah, I don't have anything against watching his videos.
1116.20s:  I just have a pretty specific regiment of the stuff that I watch and when it kind of helps me stay focused on what I do.
1127.32s:  But yeah, if you have any more context behind it, I am obviously open to understanding it and seeing what the perspective might be.
1137.96s:  The next thing.
1139.08s:  So there was a couple of people asking.
1143.72s:  There was a couple of people asking, oh, wait, hold on.
1146.44s:  H says I was a bit confused by where Newton got the 99% number as well to be honest.
1151.80s:  I'm assuming, again, without the context, I would assume he's guessing that from including all of the derivatives market on top of it, which I mean, honestly, it's not really how that works.
1162.84s:  But I could see why he might look at it that way if he's looking at it that way.
1167.80s:  But I don't see really a way to get to 99% short flow unless you have derivatives involved without derivatives.
1179.64s:  Right now, at least, I don't see the data, the back it up.
1183.12s:  So that would be my assumption.
1185.44s:  H is that he likely is talking about derivatives.
1187.64s:  But if you drop a comment on his video, he'll probably tell you he's he's pretty responsive.
1193.64s:  Now, a couple of people asked me earlier today about the move that we saw in the market.
1198.08s:  And a lot of folks were trying to contextualize effectively what happened today.
1203.40s:  Because if we take a look at good old SPX, you can see that it actually had a not insignificant gap down that pushed down pretty damn low.
1214.92s:  It hit a low of 5488, which is a not trivial move.
1221.40s:  But then it rallied.
1223.12s:  So then the question people are trying to understand now is why did it rally?
1228.04s:  So let's start there.
1229.16s:  Why do you think it rallied?
1231.32s:  And while you're answering that, I'm going to open the window and pop the door for Thor.
1251.96s:  So what do we think?
1254.04s:  Why did rally?
1257.68s:  Oh, interesting.
1258.60s:  Tommy, what did Tom Lee say?
1260.40s:  I didn't catch what he said.
1265.92s:  Tommy is saying, Rally, people listen to Tom Lee.
1268.44s:  I'm pretty sure he's on.
1271.44s:  The Bloomberg.
1275.60s:  I don't know where NBC.
1279.00s:  I mean, if I list enough, one of them will be correct.
1281.44s:  Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, final answer Yahoo Finance.
1286.80s:  William says the bottom in, in again, is in again.
1290.96s:  You mean that's what he was saying?
1294.80s:  He basically said that April 2 will bring clarity and stocks will go up.
1306.76s:  I mean, I completely agree.
1309.00s:  What can you send me or can you tell me where to find this so that we could watch it really
1311.96s:  quick?
1312.96s:  It might kill a stream, but we'll find out.
1316.84s:  But I mean, that just sounds.
1321.28s:  That sounds a little bit like wishful thinking to me.
1324.72s:  I do fully agree on the clarity element.
1327.60s:  I absolutely, absolutely agree that when we do get the tariffs in like they just come
1336.16s:  out, they hit as they're going to hit.
1338.96s:  I do fully agree that it will add clarity.
1342.32s:  That is for sure.
1344.00s:  But I don't think the clarity itself is going to compensate for.
1354.00s:  Then the follow on, okay, cool.
1355.48s:  Thank you.
1356.48s:  Tommy, I just got it.
1357.48s:  Yeah, let's take a, let's take a look at this thing, shall we?
1362.88s:  Let's take a look at this warlock.
1366.28s:  All right, here we go.
1373.36s:  CNBC, damn it.
1374.36s:  I said, Yahoo Finance.
1375.36s:  I'm an idiot.
1377.88s:  I really don't watch financial media pretty much at all.
1382.12s:  Okay.
1383.12s:  So let's turn on some sound.
1388.52s:  It's if the stream shuts off because of copyright, it was great talking with you all.
1393.84s:  Hopefully it doesn't.
1394.84s:  I had a research at that much.
1396.44s:  I think that some of the undercariffs look like.
1400.32s:  And this week, I think into April 2nd, investors have three things on their mind.
1406.28s:  You know, one is they just don't know what the tariffs look like.
1410.48s:  That's true.
1411.48s:  They absolutely do not know what the tariffs will ultimately look like.
1418.72s:  Now, what is worth noting is that we have an idea.
1424.04s:  And the reason why we have an idea is because Trump has talked about a lot of it.
1427.16s:  Now, obviously, Tom Lee here is a little more nuanced than that, right?
1435.80s:  So he's not suggesting that nobody knows.
1438.20s:  It's just kind of completely out in the open.
1440.32s:  Like it doesn't mean that here.
1441.48s:  He's talking way more nuanced.
1443.04s:  And he's essentially saying like what the actual implementation is going to look like,
1447.76s:  which I do agree with.
1449.92s:  I think we don't know that.
1451.16s:  And that is a big part of the uncertainty we have right now.
1454.20s:  They don't know if it's going to damage the economy and I think third many.
1459.56s:  That I think we do know.
1462.04s:  So depending on how expansive they are, I actually would argue we have a pretty good
1470.28s:  sense that they are very likely to damage the economy in the near term.
1476.32s:  Now, the question beyond the near term opens up a little bit, right?
1482.36s:  Depending on how far the damage extends, but any rudimentary analysis of tariff implementation,
1489.64s:  which again, we're going to go much deeper into detail on history of tariffs and stuff
1493.84s:  like that tomorrow is there's always short term
1499.96s:  disruption.
1500.96s:  We know this.
1502.20s:  So even after the announcement, I don't think that the announcement and implementation
1507.04s:  of the tariffs is it's so funny when people do this.
1512.16s:  Take a journey with me from the start of the tariffs, which the tariffs have already
1518.72s:  started in part.
1521.88s:  Do you think that the path of the tariffs that have already been implemented was
1529.92s:  is super streamlined and everybody knew what was going on.
1536.00s:  I imagine most of you would argue no because that would be my argument as well because
1542.16s:  an objective analysis of how it happened shows that it was not that that there was always
1549.80s:  the persistence of willingness to have ancillary deals.
1556.08s:  So this idea that once the tariffs come out on the second, that everything is just going
1562.52s:  to be clear, everybody's going to know what's going on and it's just going to be smooth sailing
1567.36s:  from there.
1568.84s:  Honestly, it's fucking crazy because if let's say tariffs go out on the second and then
1577.88s:  let's say one of the countries that's about to get a 25% plus tariff dropped on their
1584.08s:  heads.
1585.08s:  They're like, yo, this actually kind of sucks.
1588.08s:  And rather than escalating our tariffs with the US, we're actually going to try to have
1593.44s:  a conversation with them and play the appeasement route and see if there's anything we can do
1598.32s:  on our end to reduce the tariffs.
1602.44s:  Trump is going to be receptive to that because he's already shown some level of receptiveness
1607.96s:  to that.
1608.96s:  The only point I'm making here is that once the tariffs launch on the second, it's not
1613.28s:  like this is all clear and we know what's up.
1616.60s:  It's just not the case.
1618.00s:  We are going to have a layer of clarity at least in the near term, but the long term uncertainty
1625.32s:  isn't just going to evaporate here.
1627.60s:  So I just think that that's a massive miss.
1630.80s:  I don't want to say misunderstanding because I mean, people like this are really smart
1634.68s:  and I would never, I would never position it as if they don't know what they're talking
1638.48s:  about because they do.
1639.48s:  I just think it's like a different perspective on what's likely to happen.
1644.08s:  I think that's a fair way to say it.
1645.56s:  You're just a little terrified of the policies of the White House, but like that right there,
1651.20s:  right?
1652.20s:  He's saying that there's certain entities that are terrified of the policies of the White
1655.40s:  House.
1656.40s:  Well, like that's not gone after two April.
1660.28s:  Just keep that in mind.
1662.24s:  Post Wednesday, I think markets are going to have some visibility and that allows us
1667.08s:  to take some of the selling pressure off.
1668.64s:  So.
1669.64s:  I don't understand that.
1681.44s:  I don't understand that.
1683.00s:  And the reason for the long pause there is I'm trying to game theory in my mind.
1688.56s:  Like does Tom Lee have some sort of vested interest to share this kind of message versus
1696.92s:  another message?
1698.00s:  I don't know enough about him in his background and what he does to immediately put that together.
1706.44s:  But I don't see how you draw those two conclusions or like that conclusion from the prior statement.
1712.56s:  I just don't see that because let's say the tariffs come out on the second and let's
1719.88s:  say that the tariffs then spark.
1724.92s:  Will such as uncertainty is bad for markets, so less of that is not as bad.
1728.84s:  But that's the thing is my what I'm saying is that there is no less certainty.
1734.36s:  It's not going to change.
1735.44s:  It's not like to April comes certainty goes down.
1739.96s:  It doesn't.
1741.40s:  I actually would argue in certain instances certainty will go up because one of the big
1746.92s:  things that we don't know yet is how are all of our trading partners going to respond.
1754.84s:  And I argue that's an even bigger level of uncertainty than what's being captured in
1758.96s:  the implementation of the tariffs, which we know is overwhelmingly likely to occur.
1765.28s:  So it's not like we're going into this with a 50 50 coin flip of do tariffs go on or do
1769.52s:  they not go on?
1770.52s:  That's really not the question that we have here at all.
1775.52s:  Really the question that we have in front of us is what do the tariffs look like in their
1781.16s:  implemented form, which is a fair question.
1783.40s:  And then that is uncertain and there will be more certainty on that post Wednesday.
1788.52s:  I think that that's absolutely the case.
1791.00s:  But I do not think that that clear clarifying of what it looks like in practice.
1799.32s:  Erases the follow on uncertainty of what the rest of the game theory looks like.
1807.44s:  Joe says it does.
1808.44s:  It's a deadline.
1810.44s:  You're still confusing it, man, because one of the things that just because there's a
1816.56s:  deadline doesn't mean that post deadline, we we now know what's going on.
1825.56s:  Joe says, but if we are being that broad, tariffs can go up or down in or out at any time.
1829.96s:  That's exactly correct.
1832.28s:  And we don't know that level and we won't know how the trading partners will respond.
1838.00s:  So yeah, what I'm saying here is I don't think that post to April that there's no certainty
1846.68s:  gained.
1847.68s:  We obviously do gain a little bit of certainty because notice how I said even early with
1851.44s:  the implementation of tariffs, the question right now isn't to April tariffs are going
1858.00s:  to be implemented.
1859.52s:  That's the overwhelming consensus.
1862.24s:  But there could be something that even if it's 99% expected right now, there could be
1867.44s:  a 1% chance that they're not implemented for some sort of reason, right?
1871.68s:  So there still is uncertainty around their implementation.
1874.40s:  It's just broadly expected.
1877.92s:  Now the main thing that he's talking about here though is that once the implementation
1883.08s:  is in place, which I don't think is going to be that clean, I don't think that what's
1891.12s:  implemented on to April is likely to be what's ultimately implemented.
1895.96s:  And I don't think that what's implemented on to April is not going to be adapted at
1902.28s:  some point throughout the path here.
1906.44s:  So because of those, I don't see how he's making the conclusion of post to April, they
1913.64s:  can take the selling pressure off.
1916.00s:  I think that's going to be highly dependent on what actually occurs because I can tell
1921.72s:  you what will add massive selling pressure.
1925.24s:  And this is the problem.
1926.24s:  This is why I don't listen to this stuff, to be honest.
1929.00s:  It's because like talking heads like this, they have to come up with a neat narrative
1935.80s:  and markets are simply not neat.
1939.88s:  Markets have so much going on that the urge that most traders have to bubble this stuff
1945.16s:  up to a really neat, clean, discrete tagline on what happened and what that led to, it's
1952.68s:  nice, it's satisfying, but it's fucking fake.
1956.28s:  It's not how any of this stuff works.
1958.92s:  So to that end, I think I don't know his background enough to understand if he has some sort
1968.12s:  of vested interest in making people think that the market is going to rally or go up or
1972.24s:  be happier after this.
1974.92s:  But what I can unequivocally tell you is that after to April, let's just say that right
1980.20s:  now we're at 80% uncertainty.
1983.76s:  After to April, we don't go to 20% uncertainty.
1986.28s:  It doesn't drop 60 points just using a fake scale.
1990.40s:  After to April, we might lose 5%, 10%, 20% even something like that's pretty fair in
1996.44s:  terms of certainty.
1997.44s:  But then again, it's an evolving system.
2000.72s:  Now if we have another trade partner that says, okay, game on bitch, let's start escalating
2006.44s:  this trade war.
2007.44s:  It's just so that they might have better alternatives with another trading partner and
2011.40s:  they're okay to go that route.
2013.08s:  So then they can start escalating.
2014.84s:  That's not going to relieve the selling pressure.
2016.92s:  Is what I can guarantee you is if on to April, the tariffs are announced and then shortly
2023.00s:  thereafter a bunch of other countries announce more tariffs following at higher yields, that's
2030.16s:  not going to remove selling pressure.
2032.24s:  It's going to be just an insane destruction of trade relationships that's going to take
2038.76s:  a long time to try and repair if it's reputable, which it really, it could be some of this,
2048.24s:  I think you give something a long enough runway and I absolutely think it would be reputable
2053.04s:  and a long enough runway.
2055.12s:  But in a shorter term lens, potentially not.
2059.36s:  All right, let's see what else he's got.
2061.16s:  All of this, by the way, is obviously an open conversation where we're brainstorming
2066.52s:  and sharing ideas.
2068.20s:  None of this is me dictating what things are because I don't fucking know.
2073.36s:  This guy doesn't know.
2074.44s:  You don't know.
2075.44s:  None of us know.
2076.44s:  That's the entire thing to always go back to as a trader.
2080.08s:  We don't know.
2082.08s:  We take educated assumptions based on the breadth of evidence in front of us and we try to make
2087.84s:  money off of those ideas.
2090.08s:  So I respect him.
2092.08s:  I'm sure he's probably smart, but he doesn't know any better than any of you.
2097.52s:  Nobody knows.
2098.52s:  So let's continue.
2099.52s:  Yes, I think it's possible that instead of us breaking down here and seeing markets
2105.72s:  under further pressure, we're actually got the right pieces for them.
2108.44s:  By the way, into this without knowing what's on the other side of it, that is the.
2113.20s:  So there and I actually respect that statement because he's not saying it definitively.
2119.16s:  He's saying it's possible and I also agree with him.
2122.80s:  It is possible.
2125.32s:  Probably I would argue probably not, but that just comes down to a difference of opinion
2129.48s:  at that point.
2130.48s:  Fundamental question that people are sitting around trying to figure out today and tomorrow.
2133.72s:  That's right.
2134.72s:  That's a great question, by the way.
2136.56s:  Effectively, what he's saying is answer.
2140.08s:  Yes or no, what do you really think here?
2142.04s:  It's an interminable wait for people because it is still three days and they're fearful
2145.88s:  that we could have three days of down 2%.
2148.72s:  But I kind of agree with that.
2151.36s:  That in and of itself, in my opinion, would tell you a lot.
2154.48s:  And it also tells you that the market was up today.
2158.28s:  So it's not like three days of down 2% at this point.
2161.28s:  They were thinking that because you could tell where it was at the time.
2163.80s:  The market was down a little bit.
2165.72s:  The thing that's going on here is they're trying to understand what the move might look
2173.88s:  like.
2175.52s:  And that's natural, right?
2177.48s:  He's essentially saying, well, what do we think for the person that's trying to pull the
2182.28s:  trigger and make a decision here?
2183.68s:  You'd be thinking.
2184.68s:  Drew with Larry Fink, I think the US is going to come out of this.
2188.44s:  Okay.
2189.44s:  Fully agree.
2190.44s:  I think that's absolutely the case.
2192.08s:  I am insanely bullish on the US pretty much always.
2197.48s:  And that's not because I just am like a blind dude that just loves our country.
2201.16s:  I do love our country and I am patriotic.
2203.68s:  But I'm also hypercritical of things.
2206.44s:  The reason why I'm insanely bullish is because we are eternal innovators and we continue
2214.32s:  to innovate repeatedly.
2216.48s:  And I think that that's ultimately what drives the expansion of productivity and value that
2221.56s:  we appreciate here.
2222.56s:  And I do think that we're on the precipice of a series of like literally globe changing
2229.56s:  innovations through things like AI.
2231.92s:  So super bullish, longer term.
2234.08s:  I mean, Brexit's an example.
2236.80s:  Brexit happened and the UK economy emerged.
2240.52s:  Okay, it didn't have a huge recession and the stock market did okay.
2244.76s:  So for investors today, over the weekend, we had so many thinking the economy is going
2250.56s:  to completely fall off the rails after Wednesday.
2253.36s:  Well, yeah, I mean, now we're just talking about what other people think and they, I always
2260.64s:  love the they because everybody thinks that we have a better opinion and like the masses
2266.72s:  they are the uneducated ones that are just flouting around.
2270.16s:  By the way, I'm not saying he's saying that just the use of they when we talk in these
2275.32s:  contexts is always entertaining.
2277.32s:  So put those together and you get the next question.
2281.88s:  Yeah, that's death.
2283.68s:  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of distortions of the economy now, right?
2286.92s:  Because we know people are buying cars and wine ahead of tariffs and that's creating inflation.
2292.84s:  Hopefully they're not doing it the same cars in the wine.
2295.80s:  I think it's possible.
2298.80s:  Economists are only dialing in the negative consequences so far, but not the positive.
2303.60s:  Because again, like that kind of statement, I don't really know.
2311.84s:  Tommy says, Tom Lee is a fund manager.
2313.60s:  And yeah, and for those that don't know, it actually like understanding that level of
2318.28s:  what he is and what he represents is important, right?
2321.52s:  Because if you manage a fund and you know you have clients that are watching this, you
2325.28s:  don't want you coming on saying it's going to be doom and gloom because then your clients
2331.28s:  start pulling money out.
2333.68s:  But like what do you, what do you just said there?
2336.32s:  Well, economists are only dialing in the negative consequences so far, but not the positive.
2341.88s:  I struggle with that, right?
2344.08s:  Just as I give him the benefit of the doubt and I think he's smart.
2348.52s:  I also think the economists are smart and I don't think economists would look at this
2353.32s:  and just simply say, well, how is this going to hurt and disrupt things?
2358.00s:  I think they also likely are going to look at the longer term effects of it depending
2363.68s:  on how it goes.
2364.68s:  The problem with tariffs is that it is a very delayed feedback system.
2371.12s:  The fact that the feedback loop is so delayed makes it very difficult because to the defense
2377.08s:  of the economists that he might be referencing here, the near term impacts largely are negative
2381.48s:  across the board.
2382.96s:  Now does that lead to longer term positive impacts?
2386.08s:  I argue in certain industries it will, but in other industries like we talked about during
2391.00s:  the pro market prep live stream yesterday, for example, the automotive industry.
2397.68s:  If you think about the standard margins for an automotive company, it's 10% if they're good.
2403.12s:  If you have 25% tariffs and let's say a part is made in the US, but then it's shipped
2409.76s:  to Mexico and then back to the US or shipped to Canada and then back to the US, which does happen,
2414.80s:  for add on infrastructure or I'm sorry, add on the fuck is the word I'm looking at.
2422.72s:  It's like building.
2424.96s:  When you're refining whatever the part is, it'll typically go to different stages in different places.
2432.72s:  If it goes across the Canada, hits a 25% tariff, comes back to the US, also hits a tariff,
2439.44s:  that's a problem. Automotive companies literally do not have the margins to sustain that kind of thing.
2446.00s:  So it asks that would be beyond catastrophic to that specific industry if it does indeed go that way.
2454.32s:  We don't know yet. Rates are down and gasoline's down and there could be some pull forward
2459.60s:  of demand. So we might end up having better growth. So less stag and maybe the influx.
2466.40s:  Now, one of the things I think he's referring to here is the expectation of growth because across
2470.88s:  the board, even from I shared a thing in the discord with Goldman Sachs, where just about
2478.80s:  every entity is expecting growth to slow, which shouldn't be that surprising.
2490.80s:  It's likely to be a pretty suppressed environment.
2508.08s:  Goldman Sachs had a half a point higher on the PCE than they thought previously, and three and a
2512.40s:  half on the PCE. I mean, yeah, it's interesting because Goldman did raise their inflation forecast,
2519.20s:  but then they're talking about more rate cuts. I know, which is because of growth concern.
2524.00s:  Yes. And I think we'll have a glimpse.
2527.04s:  The other element that they're talking about that is of interest to you.
2534.80s:  Is the bed watch tool for people that prefer viewing things in a simpler format?
2547.52s:  And if we take a look at the probabilities and what we're looking at for the rest of the year,
2555.28s:  you can see what effectively is expected to happen and when and where the terminal rate
2563.84s:  is likely going to be come end of year. So you can see that there's one cut here, one cut here,
2570.96s:  and then potentially another cut here. So the futures market is talking about potentially three cuts.
2579.20s:  The fed is talking one to two. So there's a little bit of bond market calling the bluff of the fed.
2589.20s:  And you can see what I found even more interesting is how
2593.68s:  gets a frenic. The probabilities have been specifically for March. It has been fascinating to watch.
2601.44s:  And this is not something I've been trading, although it is something that I do historically trade
2606.32s:  is essentially the pairs between these. But it's been so schizophrenic that I haven't touched it.
2614.72s:  When it's more of a defined trending thing I can, but when it's literally as chaotic as this,
2621.12s:  it's very difficult for me to do anything. But I think more importantly, the schizophrenia
2627.28s:  and here is something to pay attention to because it is that uncertain right now. And if we go to
2635.36s:  the areas that we have the probabilities of cuts, right? So looking at 30 July and 18
2644.80s:  June, right, you can see that the changes here are significant. So we went from 90% chance no change
2653.20s:  up to 34 down to 21 and a half. Big, big, big delta here. So all of this summarized up literally
2660.56s:  just means it's all up for grabs. Nobody knows. Going back to the original point. Any time you hear the
2667.36s:  really intelligent sounding people pontificating about what's happening directly and why. There's value in
2676.08s:  that. I wouldn't say don't ever listen to it because you can learn a lot by understanding the
2680.56s:  different relationships of things that people like that might talk about. But always remind yourself
2685.28s:  that they don't know any better than you do. Okay. Now to do that exact thing, a lot of people
2693.68s:  were wondering about the rally that we saw today because the market did start super soft.
2700.96s:  And there's pretty good evidence of what I'm about to tell you is not that same scenario where
2708.24s:  we're just kind of talking out of our ass because we can look at the movement today. You can see
2716.24s:  really when the positive move started to happen, which is in here, right? Because leading into this,
2722.72s:  it's still in the gap down. But then you can see as we get out into this range, it's actually in a
2730.00s:  pretty decent rally up and out from this point. So let's take a look at Spy, which will give us some
2737.36s:  volume metrics. And this is important. The reason why the volume metrics here in Spy are important
2745.92s:  is because as you know, as a practitioner of markets, you know that typically you're going to see
2752.40s:  volume spike beginning of day and end of day. That's where we have open outcry. We have a lot of
2758.08s:  auctions going. And this is where liquidity typically is provided. However, you'll notice here,
2764.56s:  what happened here, middle of the day, typically quiet going back to what I was talking to you about
2770.56s:  before that a big part of being a trader is looking for things that just look different. And this
2777.12s:  does look different. So let's do, I don't want it today. We won't sec. I want a one day.
2790.24s:  So if we take a look at the move here, it absolutely started to expand. And the timing for this
2797.84s:  happened to coalesce when we were having some data released, which is particularly why
2806.64s:  happened. And we'll take a look at that data now. Here. So the Chicago business, they have a PMI
2818.96s:  that they put out. And their PMI actually came in pretty healthily. So you can see that it was
2826.72s:  expected at 45.4. The prior was 45.5 and it was expected obviously to be about flat down a little bit.
2834.00s:  And it actually popped. And this is a 16 month high for this. So this started, I believe,
2842.80s:  to move the market a little bit. And then I think there was a couple other things that likely coalesced
2850.00s:  at the same time. But I actually do want to hone in on this Chicago PMI because there's some pretty
2855.20s:  interesting takeaways from this. I'm just getting caught up on the chat. Tommy says recession would
2863.60s:  force Fed hands. That depends really does depend. I do think that if a lot of thoughts obviously go
2877.60s:  through my head that like there's a strong argument that we're in a recession literally right now.
2883.60s:  So starting the conversation from that point then gives us a little bit of context on like what
2889.92s:  the Fed may or may not be quote unquote forced to do. I do think that if a recession, whether or not
2897.52s:  were in one now barred, if it does start to accelerate and look a little more aggressive, then it would
2904.64s:  not surprise me in the least to see the Fed have to position themselves to do something. And that's a
2911.84s:  big part of the central banks essentially. But I think it really depends on what the recession looks
2921.04s:  like and how things are because again, there is a genuine argument that we're sitting in a recession
2926.24s:  right now. It's we can observe the growth of GDP. We can look at the forecast of GDP. So yeah.
2936.80s:  Anyways, let's click through this a little bit. So you can see that it ran up to 47.6. It's the third
2946.80s:  consecutive month again. And it's the highest since November of 23, although it's still in contraction
2952.64s:  territory, just looks a little healthier than it did prior. Now you can see that the move generally
2959.20s:  came from the production side of things. And then secondary movements from employment order backlogs
2965.04s:  and new orders and supplier deliveries contracting a little bit. So this is a pretty useful read for those
2975.12s:  that haven't seen it. I'll actually drop the link in the discord for you guys so that you have
2982.40s:  that available to you key. And then for the pro folks, I'm going to add it to the resources as well
2989.92s:  just for like an archive of things. And a couple things order backlogs still are pretty high.
2999.60s:  What's happening right now is a lot of entities are trying to front run as much production as
3004.96s:  humanly possible ahead of the tariffs. So this general movement doesn't surprise me. We can see this
3013.52s:  hitting most of the expected affected industries. So I definitely think we'll see minor effects from
3022.40s:  that. But you can see production like really ramped here. And I think a big part of that production
3029.36s:  also comes down to the anticipation and positioning for tariffs. So whether or not this production
3038.24s:  is actually something that sustains, I would wager probably not to a degree. And the reason for that
3045.36s:  is because I think once we get through all of this prepositioning to avoid unnecessary cost driven
3052.72s:  from tariffs, I think once the tariffs are in place, it's actually going to stifle things a bit.
3057.44s:  But we will see, right? We don't really know just yet. I'm going to think if there's anything else
3064.00s:  that I've oh yeah, let's talk about this real fast because this is interesting. And then if
3067.36s:  there's anything else you want to hit now is a perfect time to throw it in the chat. But this
3072.56s:  I thought was pretty fun. Now I posted this in the discord as well because I think the move is
3080.08s:  very interesting for a few reasons. So for those that don't know, another company that musk is
3086.00s:  associated with X AI acquired X. And I think this is a really interesting idea. So you can see that
3098.00s:  it was X AI was valued at 80 bill X was at 33 bill. And I think musk, I forgot what musk bought it
3108.16s:  for. I think it's down here. Yeah, down here 44 billion in October of 22. So sold it. A lot of
3115.76s:  people are crying like, oh, you just wanted to pay himself or owe this owe that. But like the dude
3121.12s:  took a decent haircut. The other thing is that there was other money involved in that transaction.
3126.32s:  It's not like all his money, which is important. So if we take a look at why this might occur,
3136.00s:  I can see a significant number of really interesting reasons that I'm actually quite excited for.
3143.76s:  Because one of musks vision originally for X is for it to look a little bit more like we chat.
3150.80s:  And we chat from those that are unfamiliar. It's used in Asian countries, specifically places like
3158.16s:  China. And it's kind of like everything in one. It's messaging, it's social media, it's payments,
3164.64s:  it's Google searching. Well, there are version of it's like everything is in that one app. So this,
3170.56s:  I actually think starts to move X towards that path. And I also think that with the breadth
3177.36s:  of information that moves on X, you can already see it reflected in GROC, which is insanely proficient
3184.72s:  for what it is. I'm actually a pretty big fan of it. So I think the move here is interesting because
3192.40s:  it's likely to really accelerate a lot of what you're going to see in X AI, which is kind of fun.
3201.52s:  So that is just another interesting thing to keep an eye on.
3209.92s:  Tommy says I think he's using X AI to bail out on X and writing to the bottom. Oh, that's interesting.
3215.52s:  I don't, I really don't actually view it that way. The thing to remember it, well, let's find out.
3221.84s:  We'll test chat GPT because I actually don't know the answer. So let's find out. What's
3227.52s:  percentage of the Twitter purchase was funded directly by Elon and what percentage was funded
3242.16s:  by other entities interested in the opportunity? I don't know the answer to this.
3262.88s:  Okay. So it's accurately identifying that it was acquired for 44 billion in October of 22.
3272.24s:  And it says the deal was structured using a blend of personal equity loans and outside
3277.84s:  investors. So Elon Musk's personal equity was 25 billion, which is 57%. Equity co-investors 7.1 billion
3290.24s:  16%, which is Larry Ellison, Sequoia, Binance, Fidelity, bank loans, which is just good debt secured
3300.16s:  by Twitter's assets. Not Musk's personal wealth was 13 billion. And then one billion came from
3307.36s:  margin loans. So the important point here. And again, this is why people don't
3315.04s:  people like simple answers and explanations. People look at this and they think Elon Musk
3320.08s:  personally bought Twitter for 44 billion out of his pocket. And he has just over 50% of it.
3327.36s:  The other thing to keep in mind is of that 50% that he paid for with his personal equity,
3332.88s:  let's see what Elon's current net worth is even with Tesla cratering. So Elon Musk current
3340.64s:  net worth. And this is to discuss Tommy, your your theory on to bail out of X. I don't
3353.92s:  view it as a bailout. I think of it actually as likely an accelerator for AI. So I agree with
3360.64s:  that element of writing like the AI storm. But I don't view it quite as much as bailing out of
3368.56s:  X. So let's let's see chat GTP chat GPT is trying to get its life together for us.
3377.04s:  Oh, interesting. I just got a spam text from Scott Pressler. I need reinforcements in Wisconsin.
3384.80s:  We have ballot chasers. We just need sponsors. I fucking hate these spam texts so much. It's
3390.08s:  the most frustrating thing on earth. All right.
3398.72s:  Okay, Google would have been faster than this. So what is Elon Musk's net worth?
3405.68s:  342.9 billy as of 16 March. So it'd be a little bit less than that at this point.
3416.88s:  So let's see. Yo, just chill out.
3420.80s:  It is. This thing is completely frozen.
3434.88s:  57% he was still 44 billion times point. So 25 billion. So 25 billion divided by
3445.76s:  343. Call it.
3452.80s:  Represent 7% of his money. The point I'm making there is that he doesn't care.
3459.60s:  He could he could light the money on fire if he was so inclined. So
3466.96s:  Tommy says X X AI plus X Y even do the deal. I told you why because I think it's a massive accelerator for X AI
3479.20s:  to be able to use X and also potentially to develop that ecosystem the way that he's talked about
3485.20s:  trying to develop the ecosystem. So yeah, I think from those lenses.
3490.24s:  T.C.M says 60 second thoughts on GME this week with the bond offer and potentially closing tomorrow.
3497.12s:  I don't really know. I haven't looked too closely. Let's see.
3513.20s:  Interesting that it's approaching this 20 and a half handle that we drew before.
3519.84s:  I mean, so the thing about the bond offering is it's not like at the market offering.
3529.84s:  Like that bond offering isn't going to impact the near term price that much.
3534.64s:  So it's more about the sentiment about it. So even if the bond offering, for example,
3540.56s:  to your point T.C.M closes tomorrow, that doesn't say like at the at the market where
3547.68s:  that then he races the sell-side pressure. Well, that's not so much the case here.
3552.80s:  So I think a lot of the initial response that you're seeing here is based on the pricing of
3558.56s:  the debt offering and then the longer term prospects of GameStop. But another thing that I do find
3569.44s:  slightly topical to be honest is that the two standard deviation move bucket for the last six
3577.84s:  months is actually contracted a little. Interesting. Let's see what the options market say.
3590.56s:  Yeah, I mean, not much. Big call skew is per usual.
3596.16s:  A majority of calls sold today.
3604.40s:  Yeah, this front expiration is actually really quiet. 150 to 53 actually is like super, super quiet.
3613.52s:  So the options market's not thinking much either. Yeah, I don't really think that that's going
3617.92s:  to be necessarily a massive market moving event for GameStop.
3623.28s:  It just have you ever looked at convertible bond arbitrage did a bit of digging over the weekend.
3627.12s:  It seems applicable to some of the action in GME. Well, I mean, I'm familiar with convertible bond
3632.88s:  are, but in when you say have you ever looked at it in what context? When you say seems applicable
3641.52s:  to some of the action in GME, that's another that's a whole other ball game. But I'm sure that that
3649.28s:  would be in play here along with a billion other things. I totally could see that.
3660.80s:  But yeah, I mean, GameStop right now is actually kind of quiet. It needs to find its footing.
3665.12s:  It's still in a very clearly defined descending channel. I guess not even using that one at this point.
3679.76s:  What the where'd my line go?
3684.56s:  What was happening here?
3693.12s:  Yeah, so I mean, as long as it remains here, it really needs like this needed to sustain itself
3701.20s:  for any meaningful upside price action, I think, which is just not seeing that right now.
3706.88s:  Kind of reminds me of Tesla, to be honest, because this is the same thing I was talking about
3714.96s:  with the price action that you see in Tesla very likely being a just downside whipsaw rally.
3726.80s:  And now the ball in here from a risk premium perspective has actually been hyper attracted.
3733.84s:  So find that pretty interesting from Tesla. But as you all know, with travel this month for me,
3741.84s:  my portfolio is about as light as it's been and everything's generally buttoned up for that.
3749.92s:  I do obviously still have the coverage strangle going. I need to manage the short calls in those
3755.28s:  sometime this week. And then the short puts in stuff, I will probably kick some of them out
3762.32s:  further. So for example, in TQ's, I have the 17 April 60s. Like those, I'm going to have to do
3768.80s:  something with if we take a look at TQ's. Let's see what those are doing right now.
3777.36s:  Here is. Is it 17 April 60s for 540?
3784.08s:  No, that's actually not going to be that bad of a trade to be pretty mature, but it'll be fine.
3789.92s:  We'll call it 540 on those. Take them out to 16 May.
3795.60s:  The liquid a f.
3800.40s:  The liquid a f. We just play the e liquidity here.
3807.04s:  What are these? 615, 525. So really could take them to like the 57s without adding side.
3818.88s:  So that'll probably be the move for those. And then I have the 2 May 71s. Those are pretty ugly.
3828.64s:  So these, I'm actually going to have to roll before I leave as well, just to reduce early assignment
3839.28s:  risk so that it don't have to worry about it. But those were offered at 780.
3846.32s:  And they're going to come down at 1385.
3857.92s:  And this is a good example of not really being able to roll down without adding more size,
3866.24s:  which I can. I don't know if I will. I might just roll it for a small debit.
3872.08s:  1330 versus 1385. I don't really care about that. But anyways, that's really what's going
3878.40s:  on in my portfolio. And then I do have the game stop coverage strangle still. And I have 16 May
3885.76s:  and 17 April. So 17 April, the 28 calls, but those will be fine to take down really not much there.
3896.48s:  H says, a portion of the sell pressure potentially being participants entering short positions
3902.48s:  to hedge the purchase of the bonds in order to trade future volatility. I don't actually think
3909.28s:  that's likely what they would be doing. And it's because since game stop is hard to borrow
3915.68s:  by taking a short stock position, that's like you're opening yourself up to such a wild margin risk.
3925.84s:  In that scenario, I actually would insanely doubt that they're doing that. They would much more
3931.28s:  likely be using options to do it. And it's because you avoid the carrying cost of the shorts.
3940.64s:  And then you don't have short call or I'm sorry short stock risk and something like game stop
3948.88s:  that those bonds wouldn't necessarily stop you from getting a margin call on a short stock position.
3954.80s:  If it goes parabolic. So I would be highly, highly surprised if a big part of that would be
3967.84s:  what you're seeing in there now, not saying that it couldn't be. I just I think the broader risk
3972.56s:  associated with shorting like something like game stop would make it less appealing.
3976.16s:  Thank you.
3980.16s:  Cool. It's all I got. As always, if you need anything, let me know. You know, I'll see you later.
