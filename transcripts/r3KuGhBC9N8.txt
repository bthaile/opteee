294.00s: you
296.00s: you
304.00s: you
326.00s: I absolutely love that in hedge, joking aside, it's just because the moves are actually
332.08s: a little bit smaller.
333.48s: But I always find the market's ability to find small quirks like that, entertaining.
341.40s: So the agenda for today will be pretty quick, actually.
344.48s: I want to walk through the market at a high level and maybe discuss a little bit about
350.96s: the recent upcoming, specifically the tariff side of stuff, we're actually going to spend
356.54s: time on the pro stream tomorrow digging quite a bit deeper into the tariffs.
362.52s: That will be our deep dive topic because I think there's a lot of ways to play the tariff
368.54s: news.
369.54s: Everything from the volatility of the tariffs to the implementation, the industry impacts.
374.68s: And I think the volatility for the tariffs is going to continue to be like really, really
379.68s: important.
381.00s: And it's because the tariffs continue to evolve and morph as we go forward.
388.32s: So because of that uncertainty, you typically can find some volatility to trade around
393.48s: those kinds of events.
394.56s: So that's the game plan.
396.64s: Let's get us on to the main screen.
399.40s: Futures on the open right now down a little bit, VIX up a little bit, not much.
406.08s: We're seeing it peaked above 22 today and it's clustering so far around 21.
414.12s: We'll see how it behaves in here.
416.64s: But if we take a quick look at SPX and I specifically want to eyeball the volatility here.
429.12s: So I have actually no idea why these are messed up right now.
434.04s: It doesn't really matter because we can go in and we can manually get an idea of what
438.40s: Volis.
439.40s: So it looks like the at the money is like 31 and a half.
444.20s: And then this side is like 25.
448.32s: So definitely at the money on the put side elevated, which would what we would expect.
454.32s: You can see it's really not that elevated around the two April dates.
459.04s: And obviously that's when we're expecting the tariffs to go live.
465.00s: So because of that, the standard suite of vault trading strategies is really the primary
474.24s: direction.
475.24s: I've been playing stuff like this.
476.40s: I don't have anything in particular on for two April just yet.
481.28s: But probably as it gets a little closer, we'll look to do that.
485.48s: Now let's take a quick look at the broad market.
489.60s: There's a couple key themes to highlight from today.
492.92s: The first one is take a look at energy.
497.04s: Energy had a pretty strong day.
499.24s: Now also notice that energy is up and a lot of other sectors are also up.
508.48s: And you see the thing specifically in this context energy, which previously was the flight
515.80s: to quality.
516.80s: That's where people were rotating into things like energy, staples, utilities.
522.44s: We could see that rotation happening.
525.44s: Now with the market rallying today, right?
528.52s: So you can see S&P 500 had a positive day closing above yesterday's close.
534.96s: The cues about tied, not a big move in the cues comparatively and then same sort of scenario
542.64s: with the Russell.
545.12s: But you'll notice that these are the stocks that people have been rotating into on weakness.
550.28s: Now the fact that these still rally today while the rest of the market still saw strength
556.04s: should tell you something very specific.
558.52s: It should tell you that people are continuing to rotate into XLE, XLP, XLU.
566.12s: And when I'm referring to those, I don't necessarily mean those tickers specifically,
570.40s: but the sectors that they represent.
573.24s: So that story is important for you to keep in the back of your mind.
577.40s: Because when you see a little bit of a bounce today, I still, and I've said this for a few
583.36s: weeks now, I still think that the PODOD's favor downside.
589.16s: And it has everything to do with the injection of uncertainty around what we're seeing from
594.84s: tariffs.
595.84s: And you can also see it reflected in a couple different ways.
599.64s: One of the ways is the really, really soft call premiums on the day.
606.16s: And then if we filter this to look at the out of the money's only, then it's about
610.60s: a soft as it possibly could be.
612.80s: So because that, and we're seeing this really persistent, heavier put premium on a relative
618.96s: basis, but notice what's happening right now.
621.96s: You can see that both puts and call premiums are kind of lame today, right?
630.36s: Not really seeing a whole lot.
631.80s: What's that all about?
633.40s: The holding pattern.
634.88s: What's happening right now is the market is essentially saying, I don't really know what's
639.84s: going on.
640.84s: I don't really know what's set to happen on the second.
645.44s: So this shows a lot of participants moving into a cash position, at least partially, to
652.24s: wait and see what's going to happen.
656.12s: And we can also see this reflected in the repo markets.
660.00s: So this kind of positioning is very common around stuff like this, especially for larger
666.04s: players, because it takes time for larger players to build their positions.
671.12s: So this here, completely logical, it doesn't surprise me at all.
676.24s: And it wouldn't surprise me that if we don't have some sort of larger news come out tomorrow
681.60s: in some capacity to see this trend this way into the second.
686.64s: The other thing that's worth noting is actually from here, the COT report.
700.44s: So if you take a look at the COT report, there's an important trend to identify here.
710.44s: Take a look at large speculators.
715.84s: What happened today for large speculators, if I move this into a one year, so it's a
721.44s: little easier to see, what do you notice, large speculators is the green line plummeted.
730.44s: So while the market rallied a little bit today, large speculators largely exited future
741.20s: positions, specifically this one in S&P.
745.12s: So this is all floating into the small element of residual strength that we saw today.
752.88s: And yet again, an important context clue.
756.56s: This is the game of trading.
758.36s: The game of trading is understanding what typically happens when and then identifying conditions
766.20s: that start to vary from that.
768.60s: Funny enough, that's actually one of the things that you and I talked about in the podcast
773.12s: that I released this last Sunday, where he and I connected the week prior.
778.44s: And we talked about that exact function.
781.32s: And it's because that's a really significant part of what we do as traders is we monitor
786.52s: what tends to happen.
787.92s: And then when other things happen, they stick out to us.
791.00s: This is one of them.
792.28s: The market rallying like it did today and seeing the pretty strong unwind from speculators
800.28s: is important to keep in mind.
802.24s: But it tells us is that they're not fully buying the rally.
805.56s: And this is obviously an expectation of continued downside, which I still think broadly is
811.56s: likely going to be the case, at least in the near term until we get through the rest
815.68s: of the whole tariff scenario.
819.24s: So that's what I'm seeing from a broader sector lens.
825.72s: A couple of things that drew my eye, the overall breadth looks bad.
834.16s: So if we take a look at net highs lows, you can see exactly the game that's going on
840.60s: today for the NASDAQ, the net is negative 642, which is about the largest it's been.
850.04s: And then if we take a look at the New York Stock Exchange, it's negative 228, which again,
855.20s: if we look at this comparatively, just kind of draw that line across here.
858.68s: The last time it was at that was on the third of March, which is this day up here.
863.56s: So market breadth here looks weak.
867.68s: Now funny enough, Trin is starting to look healthy.
872.56s: It's another breadth indicator.
874.48s: I still wouldn't consider this healthy yet, but this is really tied also partially to
880.08s: what you're seeing from something like the skew index here.
885.20s: Which is funny enough, not as excessive as we might have thought if the market was really
893.92s: gearing up for a potential like significant unwind.
898.52s: So Joey says Tommy says large spec strapped off.
905.28s: That's exactly right.
906.28s: Good eyeball on that.
907.28s: Joey says with such large amounts of uncertainty, why is the move in VIX relatively muted?
913.68s: Well, because it's, I mean, it's not muted.
917.32s: That's the thing.
918.56s: It's just we're not in an environment where VIX would be excessively elevated necessarily.
928.64s: But if you take a look at where VIX is today, like this isn't muted by any stretch of
935.68s: the imagination.
936.68s: VIX opened today at 24.
939.64s: And if we look across over the past year, there was one, two, three, four, five, six,
948.72s: seven, eight, nine, ten.
952.28s: So maybe 12 days total, assuming I missed a couple that VIX even crossed above that handle,
960.08s: let alone closed above that handle.
963.04s: So I actually think that's more of a perspective element than anything, but I definitely would
970.44s: not say that VIX is muted here.
974.84s: It's I actually think VIX is appropriately placed here.
977.88s: I don't think it's, I don't think it's excessive either, but I don't think it's muted.
984.80s: Derek good to see you.
985.80s: Jesse says question.
987.96s: Newton said, GME's short interest is 99% in his video this morning.
993.60s: What's your opinion?
994.60s: I don't really think there's an opinion on that, right?
997.48s: Like I think we can just look up short interest and see what it is.
1000.84s: So let's take a look.
1001.84s: GME short interest.
1003.28s: I can tell normally has this.
1009.92s: This has seven percent of float with point eight two days to cover, which is actually a
1017.28s: little lighter than I would have expected.
1019.00s: Let's try one other resource.
1020.72s: We'll take a look at market beat.
1027.04s: They say 7.2%.
1033.96s: And let's check out, oops, one more.
1041.84s: Take a look at Benzingo.
1047.24s: Benzingo shows short interest at 7.5.
1054.04s: So typically what I do in these is I kind of just eyeball the difference between them
1057.24s: and pick something towards the middle as long as there's not a massive change.
1062.00s: So it looks like it'd be in like the mid-sevens as far as I'm concerned in terms of short interest
1067.52s: as percent of float.
1069.16s: Not really sure the context Jesse on short interest being 99%.
1075.00s: I didn't catch that video.
1077.96s: Based on the data that we have available, that doesn't look to be the case.
1081.68s: It looks like it's actually single digits, which does seem a little low to me.
1089.48s: But it's also really hard to tell with all the synthetics and stuff available.
1093.16s: So there's probably a little more context behind the statement that I just don't have.
1099.24s: So yeah.
1100.24s: Anyways, this is frozen.
1104.52s: Let's unfreeze.
1106.60s: So Jesse says watch his video that he made his morning.
1108.68s: I probably won't to be honest with you, but yeah, I don't have anything against watching
1115.48s: his videos.
1116.48s: I just have a pretty specific regiment of the stuff that I watch and when it kind of
1123.80s: helps me stay focused on what I do.
1127.68s: But yeah, if you have any more context behind it, I am obviously open to understanding it
1132.92s: and seeing what the perspective might be.
1138.36s: The next thing.
1139.36s: So there was a couple people asking, there was a couple people asking, oh wait, hold on.
1146.64s: H says I was a bit confused by where Newton got the 99% number as well to be honest.
1151.88s: I'm assuming, again, without the context, I would assume he's guessing that from including
1157.88s: all of the derivatives, market on top of it, which I mean, honestly, it's not really
1161.60s: how that works, but I could see why he might look at it that way if he's looking at it
1167.00s: that way.
1168.00s: But I don't see really a way to get to 99% short flow unless you have derivatives involved
1177.20s: without derivatives.
1179.84s: Right now, at least, I don't see the data, the back it up.
1183.24s: So that would be my assumption.
1185.12s: H is that he likely is talking about derivatives.
1187.68s: But if you drop a comment on his video, he'll probably tell you he's he's pretty responsive.
1191.56s: Now, a couple of people asked me earlier today about the move that we saw in the market.
1198.32s: And a lot of folks were trying to contextualize effectively what happened today is if we
1203.68s: take a look at good old SPX, you can see that it actually had a not insignificant gap
1210.68s: down that pushed down pretty damn low.
1215.08s: It hit a low of 5488, which is a not trivial move.
1221.48s: But then it rallied.
1223.24s: So then the question people are trying to understand now is why did it rally?
1228.20s: So let's start there.
1229.20s: Why do you think it rallied?
1231.56s: And while you're answering that, I'm going to open the window and pop the door for
1235.12s: Thor.
1252.04s: What do we think?
1254.12s: Why did rally?
1257.76s: Oh, interesting.
1258.60s: Tommy, what did Tom Lee say?
1260.44s: I didn't catch what he said.
1266.00s: Tommy is saying rally people listen to Tom Lee.
1268.48s: I'm pretty sure he's on the Bloomberg.
1275.64s: I don't know where NBC.
1279.04s: I mean, if I list enough, one of them will be correct.
1281.44s: Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Finance, final answer Yahoo Finance.
1286.84s: William says the bottom in, in again, is in again.
1291.04s: You mean that's what he was saying?
1294.84s: He basically said that April 2 will bring clarity and stocks will go up.
1306.84s: I mean, I completely agree.
1309.00s: What can you send me or can you tell me where to find this so that we could watch it really
1311.96s: quick?
1312.96s: It might kill a stream, but we'll find out.
1316.88s: But I mean, that just sounds.
1321.28s: That sounds a little bit like wishful thinking to me.
1324.72s: I do fully agree on the clarity element.
1327.60s: I absolutely, absolutely agree that when we do get the tariffs in like they just come
1336.20s: out, they hit as they're going to hit.
1339.00s: I do fully agree that it will add clarity.
1342.36s: That is for sure.
1344.00s: But I don't think the clarity itself is going to compensate for.
1354.04s: Then the follow on.
1355.04s: Okay.
1356.04s: Cool.
1357.04s: Thank you.
1358.04s: Tommy, I just got it.
1359.04s: Yeah.
1360.04s: Let's take a, let's take a look at this thing.
1361.64s: Shall we take a look at this war lock?
1366.20s: All right.
1367.20s: Here we go.
1368.20s: CMBC.
1369.20s: Damn, I said Yahoo Finance.
1370.20s: I'm an idiot.
1371.20s: I really don't watch financial media pretty much at all.
1382.20s: Okay.
1383.20s: So let's turn on some sound.
1388.52s: And if the stream shuts off because of copyright, it was great talking with you all.
1393.88s: Hopefully it doesn't.
1394.88s: We had a research that's not that much.
1396.48s: I think that some of the undercariffs look like.
1400.32s: And this week, I think into April 2nd, investors have three things on their mind.
1406.24s: You know, one is they just don't know what the tariffs look like.
1410.48s: That's true.
1411.48s: We absolutely do not know what the tariffs will ultimately look like.
1418.72s: Now what is worth noting is that we have an idea.
1424.04s: And the reason why we have an idea is because Trump has talked about a lot of it.
1427.16s: Now obviously, Tom Lee here is a little more nuanced than that, right?
1435.80s: So he's not suggesting that nobody knows it's just kind of completely out in the open.
1440.32s: Like it doesn't mean that here.
1441.48s: He's talking way more nuanced.
1443.04s: And he's essentially saying like what the actual implementation is going to look like,
1447.76s: which I do agree with.
1449.92s: I think we don't know that.
1451.16s: And that is a big part of the uncertainty we have right now.
1454.20s: They don't know if it's going to damage the economy.
1457.00s: And I think third many.
1459.56s: That I think we do know.
1462.04s: So depending on how expansive they are, I actually would argue we have a pretty good sense
1471.12s: that they are very likely to damage the economy in the near term.
1476.64s: Now the question beyond the near term opens up a little bit, right?
1482.68s: Depending on how far the damage extends, but any rudimentary analysis of tariff implementation,
1489.76s: which again, we're going to go much deeper into detail on history of tariffs and stuff
1493.92s: like that tomorrow is there's always short term disruption.
1500.96s: We know this.
1502.20s: So even after the announcement, I don't think that the announcement and implementation
1507.04s: of the tariffs is it's so funny when people do this.
1512.16s: Take a journey with me from the start of the tariffs, which the tariffs have already
1518.72s: started in part.
1521.88s: Do you think that the path of the tariffs that have already been implemented was super
1531.04s: streamlined and everybody knew what was going on?
1535.96s: I imagine most of you would argue no because that would be my argument as well because
1542.12s: an objective analysis of how it happened shows that it was not that that there was always
1549.80s: the persistence of willingness to have ancillary deals.
1556.08s: So this idea that once the tariffs come out on the second, that everything is just going
1562.52s: to be clear, everybody's going to know what's going on and it's just going to be smooth sailing
1567.36s: from there.
1568.84s: Honestly, it's fucking crazy because if let's say tariffs go out on the second and then
1577.88s: let's say one of the countries that's about to get a 25% plus tariff dropped on their
1584.08s: heads.
1585.08s: They're like, yo, this actually kind of sucks.
1588.08s: And rather than escalating our tariffs with the US, we're actually going to try to have
1593.44s: a conversation with them and play the appeasement route and see if there's anything we can
1598.24s: do on our end to reduce the tariffs.
1602.44s: Trump is going to be receptive to that because he's already shown some level of receptiveness
1607.96s: to that.
1608.96s: The only point I'm making here is that once the tariffs launch on the second, it's not
1613.28s: like this is all clear and we know what's up.
1616.60s: It's just not the case.
1618.00s: We are going to have a layer of clarity at least in the near term, but the long term uncertainty
1625.12s: isn't just going to evaporate here.
1627.60s: So I just think that that's a massive miss.
1630.80s: I don't want to say misunderstanding because I mean, people like this are really smart
1634.68s: and I would never, I would never position it as if they don't know what they're talking
1638.48s: about because they do.
1639.48s: I just think it's like a different perspective on what's likely to happen.
1644.08s: I think that's a fair way to say it.
1645.56s: You're just a little terrified of the policies of the White House, but like that right there,
1651.20s: right?
1652.20s: He's saying that there's certain entities that are terrified of the policies of the White
1655.40s: House.
1656.40s: Well, like that's not gone after two April.
1660.28s: Just keep that in mind.
1662.24s: Post Wednesday, I think markets are going to have some visibility and that allows us
1667.08s: to take some of the selling pressure off.
1668.64s: So.
1669.64s: I don't understand that.
1681.44s: I don't understand that.
1683.00s: And the reason for the long pause there is I'm trying to game theory in my mind.
1688.56s: Like does Tom Lee have some sort of vested interest to share this kind of message versus
1696.92s: another message?
1698.00s: I don't know enough about him in his background and what he does to immediately put that together.
1706.44s: But I don't see how you draw those two conclusions or like that conclusion from the prior statement.
1712.56s: I just don't see that because let's say the tariffs come out on the second and let's
1719.88s: say that the tariffs then spark.
1724.92s: Will such as uncertainty is bad for markets, so less of that is not as bad.
1728.84s: But that's the thing is my what I'm saying is that there is no less certainty.
1734.36s: It's not going to change.
1735.44s: It's not like to April comes certainty goes down.
1739.96s: It doesn't.
1741.40s: I actually would argue in certain instances certainty will go up because one of the big
1746.92s: things that we don't know yet is how are all of our trading partners going to respond.
1754.84s: And I argue that's an even bigger level of uncertainty than what's being captured in
1759.00s: the implementation of the tariffs, which we know is overwhelmingly likely to occur.
1765.28s: So it's not like we're going into this with a 50 50 coin flip of do tariffs go on or do
1769.52s: they not go on?
1770.52s: That's really not the question that we have here at all.
1775.52s: Really the question that we have in front of us is what do the tariffs look like in their
1781.16s: implemented form, which is a fair question.
1783.40s: And then that is uncertain and there will be more certainty on that post Wednesday.
1788.52s: I think that that's absolutely the case.
1791.00s: But I do not think that that clear clarifying of what it looks like in practice.
1799.32s: Erases the follow on uncertainty of what the rest of the game theory looks like.
1807.44s: Joe says it does.
1808.44s: It's a deadline.
1810.44s: You're still confusing it, man, because one of the things that just because there's a
1816.56s: deadline doesn't mean that post deadline, we we now know what's going on.
1825.60s: Joe says, but if we are being that broad, tariffs can go up or down in or out at any time.
1829.96s: That's exactly correct.
1832.28s: And we don't know that level and we won't know how the trading partners will respond.
1838.00s: So yeah, what I'm saying here is I don't think that post to April that there's no certainty
1846.68s: gained.
1847.68s: We obviously do gain a little bit of certainty because notice how I said even early with
1851.44s: the implementation of tariffs.
1853.28s: The question right now isn't to April tariffs are going to be implemented.
1859.52s: That's the overwhelming consensus.
1862.24s: But there could be something that even if it's 99% expected right now, there could be a
1867.52s: one percent chance that they're not implemented for some sort of reason, right?
1871.72s: So there still is uncertainty around their implementation.
1874.44s: It's just broadly expected.
1877.96s: Now the main thing that he's talking about here though is that once the implementation
1883.08s: is in place, which I don't think is going to be that clean, I don't think that what's
1891.16s: implemented on to April is likely to be what's ultimately implemented.
1896.00s: Because I don't think that what's implemented on to April is not going to be adapted at
1902.32s: some point throughout the path here.
1906.44s: So because of those, I don't see how he's making the conclusion of post to April, they
1913.64s: can take the selling pressure off.
1916.00s: I think that's going to be highly dependent on what actually occurs because I can tell
1921.72s: you what will add massive selling pressure.
1925.24s: And this is the problem.
1926.24s: This is why I don't listen to this stuff, to be honest.
1929.00s: It's because like talking heads like this, they have to come up with a neat narrative
1935.76s: and markets are simply not neat.
1939.88s: Markets have so much going on that the urge that most traders have to bubble this stuff
1945.16s: up to a really neat, clean, discrete tagline on what happened and what that led to.
1952.68s: It's nice, it's satisfying, but it's fucking fake.
1956.28s: It's not how any of this stuff works.
1958.92s: So to that end, I think I don't know his background enough to understand if he has some sort
1968.12s: of vested interest in making people think that the market is going to rally or go up or
1972.24s: be happier after this.
1974.92s: But what I can unequivocally tell you is that after to April, let's just say that right
1980.20s: now we're at 80% uncertainty.
1983.76s: After to April, we don't go to 20% uncertainty.
1986.28s: It doesn't drop 60 points just using a fake scale.
1990.40s: After to April, we might lose 5%, 10%, 20% even something like that's pretty fair in
1996.44s: terms of certainty.
1997.44s: But then again, it's an evolving system.
2000.72s: Now if we have another trade partner that says, okay, game on, bitch, let's start escalating
2006.44s: this trade war.
2007.44s: It's just so that they might have better alternatives with another trading partner and
2011.40s: they're okay to go that route.
2013.08s: So then they can start escalating.
2014.84s: That's not going to relieve the selling pressure.
2016.92s: Is what I can guarantee you is if on to April, the tariffs are announced and then shortly
2023.00s: thereafter a bunch of other countries announce more tariffs following at higher yields, that's
2030.16s: not going to remove selling pressure.
2032.24s: It's going to be just an insane destruction of trade relationships that's going to take
2038.76s: a long time to try and repair if it's reputable, which it really, it could be some of this,
2048.24s: I think you give something a long enough runway and I absolutely think it would be reputable
2053.08s: in a long enough runway.
2055.12s: But in a shorter term lens, potentially not.
2059.36s: All right, let's see what else he's got.
2061.16s: All of this, by the way, is obviously an open conversation where we're brainstorming
2066.52s: and sharing ideas.
2068.20s: None of this is me dictating what things are because I don't fucking know.
2073.36s: This guy doesn't know.
2074.44s: You don't know.
2075.44s: None of us know.
2076.44s: That's the entire thing to always go back to as a trader.
2080.08s: We don't know.
2082.08s: We take educated assumptions based on the breadth of evidence in front of us and we try to make
2087.84s: money off of those ideas.
2090.08s: So I respect him.
2092.08s: I'm sure he's probably smart, but he doesn't know any better than any of you.
2097.52s: Nobody knows.
2098.52s: So let's continue.
2099.52s: Yes, I think it's possible that instead of us breaking down here and seeing markets
2105.72s: under further pressure, we're actually got the right pieces for him.
2108.44s: By the way, into this without knowing what's on the other side of it, that is the.
2113.20s: So there and I actually respect that statement because he's not saying it definitively.
2119.16s: He's saying it's possible and I also agree with him.
2122.80s: It is possible.
2125.32s: Probably I would argue probably not, but that just comes down to a difference of opinion
2129.48s: at that point.
2130.48s: Fundamental question that people are sitting around trying to figure out today and tomorrow.
2133.72s: That's right.
2134.72s: That's a great question, by the way.
2136.56s: Effectively, what he's saying is answer.
2140.08s: Yes or no, what do you really think here?
2142.08s: It's an interminable wait for people because it is still three days and they're fearful
2145.88s: that we could have three days of down 2%.
2148.72s: But I kind of agree with that.
2151.36s: That in and of itself, in my opinion, would tell you a lot.
2154.48s: And it also tells you that the market was up today.
2158.28s: So it's not like three days of down 2% at this point.
2161.28s: They were thinking that because you could tell where it was at the time.
2163.80s: The market was down a little bit.
2165.72s: The thing that's going on here is they're trying to understand what the move might look
2173.88s: like.
2175.52s: And that's natural, right?
2177.48s: He's essentially saying, well, what do we think for the person that's trying to pull the
2182.28s: trigger and make a decision here?
2183.68s: We'd be thinking.
2184.68s: Drew with Larry Fink, I think the US is going to come out of this.
2188.44s: Okay.
2189.44s: Fully agree.
2190.44s: I think that's absolutely the case.
2192.08s: I am insanely bullish on the US pretty much always.
2197.48s: And that's not because I just am like a blind dude that just loves our country.
2201.16s: I do love our country and I am patriotic.
2203.68s: But I'm also hypercritical of things.
2206.44s: The reason why I'm insanely bullish is because we are eternal innovators and we continue
2214.32s: to innovate repeatedly.
2216.48s: And I think that that's ultimately what drives the expansion of productivity and value that
2221.56s: we appreciate here.
2222.56s: And I do think that we're on the precipice of a series of like literally globe changing
2229.56s: innovations through things like AI.
2231.92s: So super bullish, longer term.
2234.08s: I mean, Brexit's an example.
2236.80s: Brexit happened and the UK economy emerged.
2240.52s: Okay, it didn't have a huge recession and the stock market did okay.
2244.76s: So for investors today, over the weekend, we had so many thinking the economy is going
2250.56s: to completely fall off the rails after Wednesday.
2253.16s: Well, yeah, I mean, now we're just talking about what other people think and they, I always
2260.64s: love the they because everybody thinks that we have a better opinion and like the masses
2266.72s: they are the uneducated ones that are just flouting around.
2270.16s: By the way, I'm not saying he's saying that just the use of they when we talk in these
2275.32s: contexts is always entertaining.
2277.32s: So put those together and you get the next question.
2281.88s: Yeah, that's death.
2283.68s: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of distortions of the economy now, right?
2286.92s: Because we know people are buying cars and wine ahead of tariffs and that's creating inflation.
2292.84s: Hopefully they're not doing it the same cars in the wine.
2295.80s: I think it's possible.
2298.80s: Economists are only dialing in the negative consequences so far, but not the positive.
2304.60s: Because again, like that kind of statement, I don't really know.
2311.84s: Tommy says, Tom Lee is a fund manager.
2313.60s: And yeah, and for those that don't know, it actually like understanding that level of
2318.28s: what he is and what he represents is important, right?
2321.52s: Because if you manage a fund and you know you have clients that are watching this, you
2325.28s: don't want you coming on saying it's going to be doom and gloom because then your clients
2331.28s: start pulling money out.
2333.68s: But like what do you, what do you just said there?
2336.32s: Well, economists are only dialing in the negative consequences so far, but not the positive.
2341.88s: I struggle with that, right?
2344.08s: Just as I give him the benefit of the doubt and I think he's smart.
2348.52s: I also think the economists are smart and I don't think economists would look at this
2353.32s: and just simply say, well, how is this going to hurt and disrupt things?
2358.00s: I think they also likely are going to look at the longer term effects of it depending
2363.68s: on how it goes.
2364.68s: The problem with tariffs is that it is a very delayed feedback system.
2371.12s: The fact that the feedback loop is so delayed makes it very difficult because to the defense
2377.08s: of the economists that he might be referencing here, the near term impacts largely are negative
2381.48s: across the board.
2382.96s: Now does that lead to longer term positive impacts?
2386.08s: I argue in certain industries it will, but in other industries like we talked about during
2391.00s: the pro market prep live stream yesterday, for example, the automotive industry.
2397.72s: If you think about the standard margins for an automotive company, it's 10% if they're good.
2403.12s: If you have 25% tariffs and let's say a part is made in the US, but then it's shipped
2409.76s: to Mexico and then back to the US or shipped to Canada and then back to the US, which does happen,
2414.76s: for add on infrastructure or I'm sorry, add on the fuck is the word I'm looking at.
2421.08s: It's like building.
2425.00s: When you're refining whatever the part is, it'll typically go to different stages in different places.
2432.24s: So if it goes across the Canada, hits a 25% tariff comes back to the US, also hits a tariff,
2439.52s: that's a problem.
2441.08s: Automotive companies literally do not have the margins to sustain that kind of thing.
2446.12s: So it asks like that would be beyond catastrophic to that specific industry if it does indeed go that way.
2454.40s: We don't know.
2455.40s: Rates are down and gasoline's down and there could be some pull forwarded demand.
2460.16s: So we might end up having better growth.
2463.48s: So less stag and maybe the influx.
2466.52s: Now, one of the things I think he's referring to here is the expectation of growth because
2470.60s: across the board, even from I shared a thing in the discord with Goldman Sachs, where just
2477.76s: about every entity is expecting growth to slow, which shouldn't be that surprising.
2487.80s: It's likely to be a pretty suppressed environment.
2493.00s: Placian stuff is more distorting and so it's not a stack flationary.
2496.92s: You've had the, some of your recent calls that turned out to be Prussian, bullish calls
2503.64s: had to do with inflation because some of the numbers have at least given what Goldman
2508.56s: Sachs had a half a point higher on the PCE than they thought previously and three and a half
2512.64s: on the PCE.
2513.64s: I mean, yeah, it's interesting because Goldman did raise their inflation forecast but then
2519.68s: they're talking about more rate cuts.
2521.20s: I know, which is because of growth concern.
2524.20s: Yes.
2525.20s: And I think we'll have a glimpse.
2527.20s: The, I'm going to stop this here.
2529.12s: The other element that they're talking about that is of interest to you is the bed watch
2538.28s: tool for people that prefer viewing things in a simpler format here.
2547.96s: And if we take a look at the probabilities and what we're looking at for the rest of
2554.20s: the year, you can see what effectively is expected.
2559.08s: It's to happen and when and where the terminal rate is likely going to be come end of year.
2567.36s: So you can see that there's one cut here, one cut here and then potentially another cut
2572.68s: here.
2574.00s: So the futures market is talking about potentially three cuts.
2579.36s: The fed is talking one to two.
2582.28s: So there's a little bit of bond market calling the bluff of the fed.
2589.44s: And you can see what I found even more interesting is how it gets a frenic.
2596.04s: The probabilities have been specifically for March.
2599.04s: It has been fascinating to watch.
2601.76s: And this is not something I've been trading, although it is something that I do historically
2605.72s: trade is essentially the pairs between these.
2610.12s: But it's been so schizophrenic that I haven't touched it when it's more of a defined trending
2616.80s: thing I can, but when it's literally as chaotic as this, it's very difficult for me to do
2622.48s: anything.
2623.72s: But I think more importantly, the schizophrenia in here is something to pay attention to because
2630.20s: it is that uncertain right now.
2634.80s: And if we go to the areas that we have the probabilities of cuts, right?
2639.40s: So looking at 30 July and 18 June, right, you can see that the changes here are significant.
2650.20s: So we went from 90% chance, no change up to 34 down to 21 and a half.
2656.28s: Big, big, big delta here.
2658.24s: So all of this summarized up literally just means it's all up for grabs.
2662.56s: Nobody knows.
2663.56s: But it's all up to the original point.
2665.12s: Anytime you hear the really intelligent sounding people pontificating about what's happening
2673.52s: directly and why there's value in that.
2676.48s: I wouldn't say don't ever listen to it because you can learn a lot by understanding the
2680.56s: different relationships of things that people like that might talk about, but always remind
2684.56s: yourself that they don't know any better than you do.
2687.92s: Okay, now to do that exact thing, a lot of people were wondering about the rally that
2696.52s: we saw today because the market did start super soft.
2701.32s: And there's pretty good evidence of what I'm about to tell you is not that same scenario
2707.76s: where we're just kind of talking out of our ass because we can look at the movement
2713.28s: today.
2714.60s: You can see really when the positive move started to happen, which is in here, right?
2721.40s: Because leading into this, it's still in the gap down.
2725.44s: But then you can see as we get out into this range, it's actually in a pretty decent rally
2732.20s: up and out from this point.
2734.04s: So let's take a look at spy, which will give us some volume metrics.
2739.80s: And this is important.
2740.80s: The reason why the volume metrics here in spy are important is because as you know,
2748.20s: as a practitioner of markets, you know that typically you're going to see volume spike
2753.24s: beginning of day and end of day.
2755.20s: That's where we have open outcry.
2757.00s: We have a lot of auctions going and this is where liquidity typically is provided.
2761.88s: However, you'll notice here what happened here, middle of the day, typically quiet going
2769.04s: back to what I was talking to you about before that a big part of being a trader is looking
2773.96s: for things that just look different.
2776.88s: And this does look different.
2779.44s: So let's do, I don't want it today.
2784.36s: We won't sec.
2785.36s: I want a one day.
2790.48s: So if we take a look at the move here, it absolutely started to expand.
2796.32s: And the timing for this happened to coalesce when we were having some data released, which
2804.16s: is particularly why it happened.
2807.96s: And we'll take a look at that data now here.
2814.96s: So the Chicago business, they have a PMI that they put out and their PMI actually came
2822.76s: in pretty healthily.
2825.68s: We can see that it was expected at 45.4.
2829.08s: The prior was 45.5 and it was expected, obviously, to be about flat down a little bit.
2834.24s: And it actually popped.
2835.76s: And this is a 16 month high for this.
2839.04s: So this started, I believe, to move the market a little bit.
2846.12s: And then I think there was a couple other things that likely coalesced at the same time.
2851.16s: But I actually do want to hone in on this Chicago PMI because there's some pretty interesting
2856.28s: takeaways from this.
2860.52s: I'm just getting caught up on the chat.
2862.48s: Tommy says recession would force Fed hands.
2866.32s: That depends.
2867.32s: It really does depend.
2870.72s: I do think that if a lot of thoughts obviously go through my head that like there's a strong
2880.32s: argument that we're in a recession literally right now.
2883.76s: So starting the conversation from that point then gives us a little bit of context on like
2889.84s: what the Fed may or may not be quote unquote forced to do.
2894.04s: I do think that if a recession, whether or not we're in one now barred, if it does start
2901.00s: to accelerate and look a little more aggressive, then it would not surprise me in the least
2906.68s: to see the Fed have to position themselves to do something.
2911.60s: And that's a big part of the central banks essentially.
2915.80s: But I think it really depends on what the recession looks like and how things are.
2922.80s: Because again, there is a genuine argument that we're sitting in a recession right now.
2927.76s: It's we can observe the growth of GDP.
2932.68s: We can look at the forecast of GDP.
2935.52s: So yeah.
2937.12s: Anyways, let's click through this a little bit.
2941.80s: So you can see that it ran up to 47.6.
2946.28s: It's the third consecutive monthly gain and it's the highest since November of 23.
2950.64s: Although it's still in contraction territory.
2953.36s: Just looks a little healthier than it did prior.
2956.44s: Now you can see that the move generally came from the production side of things and then
2962.28s: secondary movements from employment order backlogs and new orders and supplier deliveries
2968.00s: contracting a little bit.
2969.72s: So this is a pretty useful read for those that haven't seen it.
2976.80s: I'll actually drop the link in the discord for you guys so that you have that available
2983.76s: to you.
2985.08s: Key.
2986.16s: And then for the pro folks, I'm going to add it to the resources as well just for like
2990.44s: an archive of them.
2993.16s: And a couple of things order backlogs still are pretty high.
2999.88s: What's happening right now is a lot of entities are trying to front run as much production
3004.96s: as humanly possible ahead of the tariffs.
3007.72s: So this general movement doesn't surprise me.
3012.04s: We can see this hitting most of the expected affected industries.
3017.72s: So I definitely think we'll see minor effects from that.
3023.32s: You can see production like really ramped here.
3027.40s: And I think a big part of that production also comes down to the anticipation and positioning
3034.16s: for tariffs.
3035.80s: So whether or not this production is actually something that sustains, I would wage
3042.12s: your probably not to a degree.
3044.60s: And the reason for that is because I think once we get through all of this prepositioning
3050.24s: to avoid unnecessary cost driven from tariffs, I think once the tariffs are in place, it's
3055.52s: actually going to stifle things a bit.
3057.80s: But we will see, right?
3059.76s: We don't really know just yet.
3061.28s: I don't think if there's anything else that I've, oh yeah, let's talk about this real
3065.56s: fast because it's interesting.
3067.00s: And then if there's anything else you want to hit now is a perfect time to throw it in
3070.96s: the chat.
3072.28s: But this I thought was pretty fun.
3075.00s: Now I posted this in the discord as well because I think the move is very interesting for
3081.16s: a few reasons.
3082.76s: So for those that don't know, another company that Musk is associated with XAI acquired
3088.36s: X.
3090.08s: And I think this is a really interesting idea.
3097.48s: So you can see that it was XAI was valued at 80 bill X was at 33 bill.
3104.12s: And I think Musk, I forgot what Musk bought it for.
3108.44s: I think it's down here, yeah, down here, 44 billion in October of 22.
3113.44s: So sold it.
3115.56s: A lot of people are crying like, oh, he just wanted to pay himself or owe this, owe that.
3119.88s: But like the dude took a decent haircut.
3123.08s: The other thing is that there was other money involved in that transaction.
3126.48s: It's not like all his money, which is important.
3130.60s: So if we take a look at why this might occur, I can see a significant number of really interesting
3141.24s: reasons that I'm actually quite excited for because one of Musk's vision originally for
3146.72s: X is for it to look a little bit more like we chat.
3151.20s: And we chat from those that are unfamiliar.
3155.32s: It's used in Asian countries, specifically places like China.
3159.32s: And it's kind of like everything in one.
3161.52s: It's messaging, it's social media, it's payments, it's Google searching.
3166.24s: Well, their version of it's like everything is in that one app.
3170.12s: So this I actually think starts to move X towards that path.
3175.00s: And I also think that with the breadth of information that moves on X, you can already
3181.00s: see it reflected in GROC, which is insanely proficient for what it is.
3185.72s: I'm actually a pretty big fan of it.
3188.08s: So I think the move here is interesting because it's likely to really accelerate a lot of
3197.00s: what you're going to see in X AI, which is kind of fun.
3201.76s: So that is just another interesting thing to keep an eye on.
3210.16s: Tommy says I think he's using X AI to bail out on X and writing to the bottom.
3214.44s: Oh, that's interesting.
3215.68s: I don't I really don't actually view it that way.
3218.60s: The thing to remember it, well, let's find out.
3221.12s: Let's ask chat GPT, because I actually don't know the answer.
3224.40s: So let's find out what percentage of the Twitter purchase was funded directly by Elon
3238.56s: and what percentage was funded by other entities interested in the opportunity.
3247.44s: I don't know the answer to this.
3254.48s: Okay.
3265.52s: So it's accurately identifying that it was acquired for $44 billion in October of 22.
3272.44s: And it says the deal was structured using a blend of personal equity loans and outside
3277.84s: investment.
3280.00s: So Elon Musk's personal equity was $25 billion, which is 57%.
3287.80s: We co-investors 7.1 billion 16%, which is Larry Ellison, Sequoia, Binance, Fidelity, bank
3297.08s: loans, which is just good debt secured by Twitter's assets, not Musk's personal wealth was 13
3304.88s: billion.
3305.88s: And then 1 billion came from margin loans.
3309.20s: So the important point here.
3311.16s: And again, this is why people don't, people like simple answers and explanations.
3318.08s: People look at this and they think Elon Musk personally bought Twitter for $44 billion
3322.92s: out of his pocket.
3324.72s: And he has just over 50% of it.
3327.60s: The other thing to keep in mind is of that 50% that he paid for with his personal equity,
3333.16s: let's see what Elon's current net worth is even with Tesla cratering.
3337.84s: So Elon Musk, current net worth.
3342.24s: And this is to discuss Tommy, your theory on to bail out of X.
3352.60s: I don't view it as a bailout.
3355.52s: I think of it actually as likely an accelerator for AI.
3360.04s: So I agree with that element of writing like the AI storm.
3365.00s: I don't view it quite as much as bailing out of X.
3368.96s: So let's, let's see.
3372.12s: Chat G, chat GPT is trying to get its life together for us.
3376.24s: Oh, interesting.
3377.24s: I just got a spam text from Scott Pressler.
3381.04s: I need reinforcements in Wisconsin.
3385.08s: We have ballot chasers.
3386.32s: We just need sponsors.
3387.80s: I fucking hate these spam texts so much.
3390.12s: It's the most frustrating thing on earth.
3395.72s: All right.
3398.92s: Okay, Google would have been faster than this.
3400.72s: So what is Elon Musk's net worth?
3407.80s: 342.9 billy as of 16 March.
3414.12s: So it'd be a little bit less than that at this point.
3417.04s: So let's see.
3419.36s: Yo, just fill out.
3425.44s: This thing is completely frozen.
3435.00s: 57% he was still 44 billion times point.
3440.76s: So 25 billion.
3442.80s: So 25 billion divided by 343,
3449.24s: call it.
3451.08s: It represents 7% of his money.
3454.36s: The point I'm making there is that he doesn't care.
3458.16s: He could, he could light the money on fire if he was so inclined.
3465.24s: So.
3468.24s: Tommy says X X AI plus X Y even do the deal.
3473.24s: I told you why because I think it's a massive accelerator for X AI to be able to use
3479.24s: to be able to use X and also potentially to develop that ecosystem the way that he's talked about trying to develop the ecosystem.
3487.52s: So yeah, I think from those lenses.
3491.24s: TCM says 60 second thoughts on GME this week with the bond offer and potentially closing tomorrow.
3497.24s: I don't really know.
3499.64s: I haven't looked too closely.
3501.60s: Let's see.
3510.24s: Interesting that it's approaching this 20 and a half handle that we drew before.
3522.24s: I mean, so the thing about the bond offering is it's not like at the market offering, right?
3530.24s: Like that bond offering isn't going to impact the near term price that much.
3535.24s: So it's more about the sentiment about it.
3538.24s: So even if the bond offering, for example, to your point TCM closes tomorrow, that doesn't say like the at the at the market where that then he races the sell side pressure.
3551.24s: That's not so much the case here.
3553.24s: So I think a lot of the initial response that you're seeing here is based on the pricing of the debt offering and then.
3562.24s: The longer term prospects of game stop.
3567.24s: But another thing that I do find slightly topical to be honest is that.
3574.24s: The two standard deviation move bucket for the last six months is actually contracted a little.
3582.24s: Interesting.
3584.24s: Let's see what the options market say.
3590.24s: Yeah, I mean, not much.
3594.24s: Big call skew is per usual.
3598.24s: Majority of call sold today.
3604.24s: Yeah, this front expiration is actually really quiet.
3609.24s: 150 to 53 actually is like super, super quiet.
3613.24s: So the options market's not thinking much either.
3616.24s: I don't really think that that's going to be necessarily a massive market moving event for for game stop.
3623.24s: It's just have you ever looked at convertible bond arbitrage did a bit of digging over the weekend.
3627.24s: It seems applicable to some of the action in GME.
3630.24s: Well, I mean, I'm familiar with convertible bond are, but in when you say.
3635.24s: Have you ever looked at it in what context.
3640.24s: When you say seems applicable to some of the action in GME.
3643.24s: That's another that's a whole other ball game.
3646.24s: But I'm sure that that would be.
3651.24s: In play here along with a billion other things.
3657.24s: I totally could see that.
3661.24s: But yeah, I mean, game stop right now is actually kind of quiet.
3664.24s: It needs to find its footing.
3666.24s: And a very clearly defined descending channel.
3671.24s: I guess.
3672.24s: Not even using that one at this point.
3680.24s: What the where my line go.
3685.24s: That was happening here.
3693.24s: Yeah. So I mean, as long as it remains here.
3697.24s: It really needs like this needed to sustain itself.
3701.24s: For any meaningful upside price action, I think, which is just not seeing that right now kind of reminds me of Tesla.
3709.24s: To be honest.
3711.24s: Because this is the same thing I was talking about with.
3717.24s: The price action that you see in Tesla very likely being a.
3723.24s: Just downside whipsaw rally.
3727.24s: And now the ball in here from a risk premium perspective has actually been hyper attracted.
3734.24s: So find that pretty interesting from Tesla.
3737.24s: But as you all know, with travel this month for me, my portfolio is about as light as it's been.
3745.24s: And everything's generally buttoned up for for that.
3750.24s: I do obviously still have the coverage strangle is going.
3753.24s: I need to manage the short calls and those sometime this week.
3757.24s: And then the short puts in stuff.
3760.24s: I will probably kick some of them out further.
3763.24s: So for example, in TQ's, I have the 17 April 60s.
3768.24s: So I'm going to have to do something with.
3770.24s: If we take a look at TQ's.
3775.24s: Let's see what those are doing right now.
3777.24s: Here is.
3779.24s: Is it 17 April 60s for 540?
3784.24s: That's actually not even going to be that bad of a trade to be.
3787.24s: It would be premature, but it'll be fine.
3790.24s: We'll call it 540 on those.
3792.24s: Take them out to 16 May.
3795.24s: Liquid AF.
3800.24s: Liquid AF.
3802.24s: We just play the e liquidity here.
3809.24s: What are these?
3810.24s: 615.
3812.24s: 525.
3813.24s: So really could take them to like the 57s without adding side.
3819.24s: So that'll probably be the move for those.
3822.24s: And then I have the two May 71s.
3826.24s: Those are pretty ugly.
3832.24s: So these I'm actually going to have to roll before I leave as well.
3837.24s: Just to reduce early assignment risk so that it don't have to worry about it.
3842.24s: But those were offered at 780.
3848.24s: And they're going to come down at 1385.
3858.24s: And this is a good example of not really being able to roll down without adding more size, which I can.
3867.24s: I don't know if I will.
3869.24s: I might just roll it for a small debit.
3872.24s: 1330 versus 1385.
3874.24s: I don't really care about that.
3876.24s: Anyways, that's really what's going on in my portfolio.
3879.24s: And then I do have the game stop coverage strangle still.
3883.24s: And I have 16 May and 17 April.
3887.24s: So 17 April the 28 calls.
3892.24s: But those will be fine to take down really not much there.
3898.24s: H says a portion of the sell pressure potentially being participants entering short positions to hedge the purchase of the bonds.
3904.24s: In order to trade future volatility.
3907.24s: I don't actually think that's likely what they would be doing.
3911.24s: And it's because since game stop is hard to borrow.
3915.24s: By taking a short stock position, that's like a.
3920.24s: You're opening yourself up to such a wild margin risk in that scenario.
3926.24s: I actually would insanely doubt that they're doing that.
3930.24s: They would much more likely be using options to do it.
3934.24s: And it's because you avoid the carrying cost of the shorts.
3940.24s: And then you don't have short call or I'm sorry short stock risk and something like game stop.
3949.24s: That those bonds wouldn't necessarily stop you from getting a margin call on a short stock position if it goes parabolic.
3960.24s: So I would be highly, highly surprised.
3964.24s: If a big part of that would be.
3967.24s: What you're seeing in there now, not saying that it couldn't be.
3970.24s: I just I think the broader risk associated with shorting like something like game stop would make it less appealing.
3979.24s: Cool.
3981.24s: So I got as always, if you need anything, let me know you know, say later.
