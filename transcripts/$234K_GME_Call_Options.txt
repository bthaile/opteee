0.84s: I love me a good anomaly in the options
3.88s: market and what better than GameStop we
6.08s: have a really interesting position today
8.56s: and even if you're not necessarily a big
10.56s: GameStop person there's some really
12.76s: important details in here for options
15.24s: Traders RIT large there's a great lesson
18.20s: so today in the 19 July 24 expiration
22.00s: cycle the 30 calls they had pretty high
25.84s: volume and they actually kicked off a
28.76s: couple different alerts
30.56s: that I have except this one was really
33.76s: weird let me show you why if we first
37.56s: start with what is a bid what is an ask
41.40s: the bid is the most somebody is willing
44.68s: to buy something for right now and then
47.24s: the ask is the cheapest somebody is
49.56s: willing to sell for right now so that
52.12s: means that if I want to buy something as
54.60s: a Trader you have to essentially be near
57.64s: the ask to do it right now right the
59.56s: second you can always try to play the
61.20s: mid price that's more of a negotiation
63.84s: process of back and forth typically so
67.16s: if I want to buy something right now
68.80s: this second and get a fill you got to go
70.40s: towards the ask if I want to sell
72.48s: something right now I would have to go
74.92s: towards the bid so what's going on here
79.04s: well this I was looking at the 30s a lot
83.52s: of lot of transactions today and this is
86.28s: filtering by stuff that's 50 lots and
88.24s: over there's way more than this but but
90.00s: these were kind of most of the larger
91.76s: transactions and it's a shotgun blast
94.04s: it's all over the place there's a lot of
95.20s: sells which are red there's a lot of
97.36s: buys which are green and then there's
99.72s: this one at the top right there came
102.84s: through at 12481 Pacific time it was a
107.16s: 4,688 lot fascinating trade
110.64s: size the price it came through at was0
113.80s: 50s came through on the SEO exchange
117.24s: this is the weird part the market was 50
121.28s: bid 49
123.64s: offered this inversion doesn't happen
128.88s: normally this actually represents an
131.28s: Arbitrage opportunity this means that if
133.88s: I could transact actually at these
135.96s: prices I can collect the spread between
139.12s: these essentially risk-free you can be a
141.48s: market maker for a second now the
143.72s: probability of you actually transacting
145.60s: fast enough at those prices is
146.88s: essentially null but as a Scholastic
150.16s: exercise you very rarely will see bids
153.96s: higher than the offers that is
156.56s: inherently
158.12s: Arbitrage that means that if I wanted to
161.52s: sell something I could sell it for 50
163.88s: and then buy it back at 49 I can make
166.60s: money right away now this to me seems
170.16s: like an error of sorts because take a
172.68s: look at
174.16s: this the platform has it labeled red
178.08s: meaning it was something that was so
179.84s: sold and the logic that the platform
182.36s: uses which I can clearly tell is if it's
186.24s: below the bid even though the bid is
188.92s: actually higher than the offer which is
190.48s: very strange so this is classifying it
193.56s: as a sell so then I have to look at some
195.88s: other places to try to see what's going
197.32s: on here so I take a look at unusual
200.20s: whales and I see a ton of different
203.32s: transactions here for today for this
205.44s: specific strike these all came through
207.64s: at 1248 a bunch of them right 10 lot
210.36s: bunch of single lots a seven a 10 a
212.04s: seven and then there's this one the 4688
216.40s: $234,000 trade and they're flagging it
220.52s: as a buy so if I close this out and we
224.16s: take a look at that position up here
226.96s: they are classifying this as a purchased
230.36s: option bullish they're saying that it
232.52s: transacted at or above the ask which is
234.92s: clearly also possible right because
237.12s: they're also showing it bid 50 offered
240.24s: at
241.76s: 49 so then was this bought or
245.44s: sold this opens up a whole other subject
249.20s: which is the fact of the matter is when
252.08s: platforms like this do these different
254.52s: color coding
255.96s: rules how could it be that this one
258.84s: colors it red and this one colors it
261.76s: essentially green for a buy versus a
264.36s: cell they just use different logic
266.76s: orders this one is looking at the bid
270.04s: side first and saying is it at or below
274.00s: the bid if so sell that's what this is
276.04s: telling you however if we take a look at
278.96s: this it's telling you essentially the
281.12s: inverse if it's above the offer then
285.32s: it's a buy even though the bid is 50
288.00s: here as well so then we had to go to an
290.32s: Arbiter a third data source and funny
294.28s: enough bar chart Flags it as green
298.08s: meaning that this was bought
300.56s: however their logic is clearly using if
303.48s: it's above the offer which is 49 it's
305.80s: kind of Bolding in where it thinks it
307.52s: transacted above that which is not wrong
310.28s: here's what I find fascinating look at
312.28s: the size of the purchase that this is
315.00s: showing you
316.24s: 49 offered by
318.92s: 31 here there's a 50 bid at
323.60s: 46.88 So within the bar chart platform
327.20s: there's an inherent discrepancy
329.96s: because this is saying it's above this
331.72s: price but look at the size 4688 against
335.72s: 4688 on the
337.60s: bid so what happened here well there's a
341.00s: couple different ways you could try to
342.28s: decipher the information for me this is
344.40s: actually very important this is probably
346.08s: one of the more important data points in
347.72s: this whole thing is to figure out the
349.84s: sizes because then I can see when it
351.36s: came
352.48s: through
354.04s: but if I look at it on this platform and
357.84s: we take a look at all of these different
359.32s: trans actions that happen these are a
362.16s: lot of buys that are flagged here and
365.08s: then one big giant sell if we use the
368.20s: other two data points I'm not so sure
370.76s: about that so I cannot say definitively
375.44s: what this is my instincts lead me to
378.44s: believe that it would be bought that
380.92s: would be my guess because that also
383.76s: aligns with the incentives of being able
386.36s: to transact because again otherwise
388.44s: there's an Arbitrage opportunity
390.16s: I would expect that to be priced out
391.68s: faster than a human could see
394.04s: it that's my instinct what calls into
397.60s: question my instinct is this right here
399.76s: and this size the fact that the bid size
403.36s: here lines up perfectly with the size of
406.12s: this transaction which lines up with
408.44s: what I see here them tracking it as a
413.00s: cell leads me to believe
415.56s: cell and that overwrites my instincts my
419.20s: instin things think that this is a buy
421.60s: doesn't really matter like if we're
422.92s: talking about all this in the grand
424.24s: scheme of things none of this really
425.72s: matters you're watching somebody right
427.44s: now who's been in options markets for so
430.48s: long that these small little Nuance
433.12s: things are fascinating to me and
435.00s: probably only to me this is like
437.36s: watching somebody like Michael Jordan
439.28s: not that I'm anywhere near the goat but
441.80s: it's like watching somebody like him
443.92s: shoot free throws for somebody like him
446.36s: he's focusing on like how does the ball
448.44s: feel on the pink
450.12s: on the 39th shot compared to the 62nd
453.12s: shot something that's imperceptible to
455.28s: most of us that play pickup basketball
456.96s: that's kind of what I'm doing here but
458.88s: this is fascinating to me so I'm sharing
460.84s: it with you for that reason so I hope
463.56s: other people find this at least somewhat
465.08s: curious because I do I would also love
466.96s: for the platforms to tell me what's
468.12s: going on here so what's going to end up
470.40s: happening is I have another data source
473.08s: that I'm going to download all of the
475.24s: options trades from today and do my best
478.92s: to see what the sizes were that this
481.08s: came through at because if it is this
484.68s: that would lead me to believe sold if it
487.76s: is not this and this is an error for
489.76s: some reason then it would lead me to
491.92s: believe bot which falls in line with the
495.00s: vast majority of other volume that we
498.16s: saw today here but absolutely absolutely
501.84s: interesting especially to see this this
504.72s: is a market unicorn to a degree and
506.96s: something like this this happens in
508.44s: small sloppy product it's not like that
510.96s: special but it is very rare because
513.20s: algorithms are looking for this exact
516.28s: thing and they're very very fast and
519.08s: they can price this out very very fast
521.80s: so the fact that this even printed like
523.60s: that and it's if it's not an error will
526.76s: be very interesting to me so super super
530.92s: interesting trade today I am very eager
533.52s: to see what this actually is but just
536.04s: note despite what a lot of people will
538.04s: say online because they want want to you
540.04s: know share what they know it's it's
542.40s: impossible to tell decisively from this
544.28s: information just because you pull it up
545.68s: on a platform and this one says oh this
548.40s: came in as a buy and we're going to
551.04s: color it like that you got to be careful
553.88s: with data sources because they're
556.12s: processing large Vats of data that's not
560.08s: perfect you still have to be a thinking
562.16s: Trader out here and say wait a minute
564.32s: there's a lot of weird things that
565.80s: happened here again it absolutely could
568.44s: have been a buy it could have been a
570.20s: sale I don't know but I can tell I don't
572.64s: know because of these reasons I don't
574.28s: just see the color and say Yes sale for
577.04s: sure sale but bid at 50 offered at 49
582.64s: taken at 50 very weird I do not know but
587.08s: like I said Instinct I think buy based
589.68s: on the rest of the volume today based on
592.20s: the data I would have to lean towards a
594.56s: sale again leaning primarily on the size
598.20s: offered here matching perfect here so I
601.80s: will have a better answer tomorrow for
603.28s: sure because I will download all of the
605.56s: trades from today and I'll see what size
607.56s: they came through and what the market
608.72s: was offered at that time so yeah again
611.80s: personal little pet project that really
613.84s: doesn't impact much of anything but I do
615.72s: find very very interesting and if these
618.12s: were buys this is a very interesting
620.40s: position because this is out for the
622.16s: next primary expiration at the 30s it's
624.64s: a big position so TBD we'll see if you
628.88s: have any question let me know be an
630.00s: outlier see you guys later
