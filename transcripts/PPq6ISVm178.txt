0.00s: What's up, outliers? Last week we did an update on the T-Trip
4.32s: Accus and SSO coverage strangle. This week I want to do an update on the game
10.96s: stop coverage strangle. It's actually for a pretty funny reason. What I do is
15.88s: track my total performance with the strategy across individual allocations.
23.28s: And you can see what my year-to-date performance was. This is at the end of
28.16s: April. I do a year-to-date performance after action review at the end of each
33.92s: month. Then you'll notice that the core allocation, which is the covered
39.84s: strangle, is contributing a little tiny baby 1% of total portfolio return.
47.36s: Now the portfolio that I share with you all is a subset of my broader
54.12s: portfolio. And this is my actual total portfolio return. Now the interesting
59.08s: thing here is for the core allocation, my position in SSO is currently
66.32s: negative slightly. It's like 0.8% something like that. Return on a vested
71.96s: capital for the allocation itself. And game stop is positive. And not only is
79.20s: it positive, but it's the second largest contributor to the core allocation
87.36s: coverage strangle performance. Yet it is by far the smallest allocation. So what I
96.08s: mean by that is if we take a look at the top here and we break out the
99.96s: specific allocations. Again, this is the subset portfolio. I'm using $600,000
105.20s: and it's in TQs SSO, Ibit and GME, but take a look. Game stop represents a
110.96s: 4% total allocation, which is really, really funny if you think about it. So
120.88s: looking at Game Stop and the performance of the strategy so far down here, you'll
127.64s: see a few things. So from when we started this exercise, Game Stop was trading
133.92s: at 2431 and right now it's trading at 2748. That represents a 13% return,
140.72s: which is solid. However, if you take a look at the return as I'm trading at
146.76s: so far, it's at 22%. That's including realized and unrealized PNL. And it's
154.16s: been really, really interesting trading Game Stop because if you take a look at
159.92s: when we originally started this exercise, it's been behaving really, really
167.44s: sideways. Right? So it's kind of from I forgot exactly when we started it was
172.80s: like end of December, maybe somewhere in here. And it's just been very, very
176.84s: sideways. So this happens to be an absolutely ideal condition for the
183.88s: coverage triangle. And it's because I rotate into different assets and
190.12s: different legs of the strategy based on how the underlying is behaving. And
196.12s: here's what that means. When we look at the coverage triangle, I can actually
201.12s: draw it for you so that it's a little more clear. There are effectively three
207.36s: legs. Leg one is equity. Leg two is cash secured puts leg three is ratio
222.00s: short calls. So what that means is I'm getting my long delta's from these two.
228.40s: And then this is just kind of an ancillary position. This is secondary. It's
231.88s: really to take advantage of environments like this where things are kind of
234.56s: turning sideways or when things are going down to offset a little bit. The
238.60s: ratio short calls are not on unless equity is on or unless there is a large
247.08s: enough cash secured put position that it gives me time to react if things start
252.12s: going up to either by shares or so on and so forth. So what's happened in
258.40s: GameStop is we started with cash secured puts. Then we started layering into
263.80s: equity positions. Then we came out of the equity position and now we're
269.32s: specifically in cash secured puts. And so far, they're performing really, really
276.68s: well. And I just want to talk about the broader landscape for GameStop, the
281.44s: position, how it's evolved. And again, this overall strategy, the entire
286.84s: goal for this as always is to simply try and give more resources, more
293.24s: tools, more ideas on how to do things. So right now, I am 61% utilized in GameStop
305.68s: relative to its $25,000 total allocation, which fun fact, the allocation is
312.36s: actually going up. So I could increase the allocation now to $29,000
318.20s: because we have a realized PNL of $2500. In fact, really, that can get
325.36s: reinvested into this. And then once these come off, that gives me an extra 33,
330.76s: 84 that I could definitely include into this if I wanted. Now, I realized that
340.32s: this was slightly off it needed to be using this cell. So this is the current
345.00s: value, essentially, the total of everything put together, the original position
350.04s: plus what the total PNL represents. So when we look at what's been performing
356.04s: well for the trade, it's absolutely been honestly trading options on it. And a
362.08s: big part of that has to do with how volatile GameStop is. If we take a look
367.28s: inside GameStop, we can see the implied volatility right now is 84.5, which
371.76s: on a relative scale for GameStop is actually super, super light. You can see
376.72s: that with an implied volatility percentile of 19%, which is very low. Now, the
382.20s: reason why this is the case is because it really has been trending sideways,
386.24s: pretty solid around this 27 and a half handle for quite a while. Now, looking
392.00s: inside the options chain, I was just kind of poking through to see if anything
396.84s: stuck out to me. And nothing really has. It's been overall quiet in terms of
402.88s: total net premiums. So I looked through then the flow feed to see if there's
409.88s: any like big trades that were eyeing out at me. This is looking over the last
414.56s: week. And this is the biggest trade that we've seen in a while. But again, it's
419.28s: so far out in time that it kind of is inconsequential. And it's the same
423.52s: thing with these sold positions here. Really is just those are positions
431.08s: doing a lot of different things. But it doesn't fit into some sort of like
436.64s: near term expectation of price movement typically. You can also see where
441.40s: these are relative. These are super high delta. More of the trades that we care
445.28s: about from some sort of directional expectation or things like this that are
450.72s: a little bit out of the money higher premium higher volume over open
455.08s: interest. This is volume over open interest, not volatility. And slightly
460.48s: near term in nature, but those kinds of trades have been quite small. Overall,
465.72s: when I look inside of GameStop. So then when I was going through just trying to
470.32s: get a general understanding of what's been happening, anything jumping out,
476.12s: I did see some really high open interest contracts. But if you take a look,
482.80s: look how far out in time these are. This is actually very different because most
487.72s: of the time really high eye contracts in GameStop tend to be pretty close in
492.64s: time. So the fact that so many of these are 258 days, 958 days, 622 days,
501.88s: those are like pretty long term trades. This isn't just trading some sort of
506.48s: really near term price expectation. These are parts of bigger, longer term
512.32s: positions, which I find generally interesting and encouraging for GameStop.
518.20s: Then I was just going through any specific news and we know that the inclusion
523.48s: of Bitcoin, I think, is solid for GameStop. It's something that it seems like
528.88s: the broader holders wanted them to do. And I'm also happy to see that it's not
533.72s: like this massive amount. It's a modest amount and they're raising it in a
539.92s: smart way, which we reviewed in a video a little while ago. So now let's take
547.12s: a look at one other thing. And I want to show you the term structure as things
552.28s: sit in GameStop. So when I take a look at the out of the money options and we
562.32s: got to get rid of this front expiration, let's just do like the main
565.12s: expiration so that it's a little less noisy. You'll see that the call side
570.28s: has come down huge on GameStop. This used to have really heavy
578.68s: callsque in terms of where most of the vol was priced in. So the fact that
584.68s: this is now assuming a more standard relationship where the put side is heavy
589.84s: compared to the call side, that's standard business as usual kind of stuff.
595.56s: So because that's the case, the market right now is in showing its hand in
599.92s: terms of expecting any sort of like massive near term moves. Now one thing
605.60s: that's worth noting is the call oh, I skew is the biggest we've seen in a long
611.84s: time with 913,000 calls against 2,000, 2,000 puts. That's massive. It's 3 times
618.04s: plus. So really, really big call skew, but it's all over the place, which is
623.84s: slightly different. Most of the time we've seen this big call skew a lot of
627.48s: it has been in the front expirations, which just isn't the case right now.
631.32s: You can see for the volume today, 192,000 calls traded against 54,000 puts,
637.08s: but a lot of the calls were being at the bid. So that's typically calls that are
642.48s: being sold. And that's not necessarily a bearish concept. It's probably a lot of
647.48s: people that might have hold hold shares like an institutional level that are
652.84s: just selling calls against it because it's essentially rotating sideways and
656.12s: based on the term structure. The market isn't showing that it's expecting some
660.24s: sort of massive move pending. So it's just a way to continue to harvest
665.68s: volatility from this. So overall, GameStop continues to be a really solid
671.44s: performer. Again, in my portfolio, the return on a vested capital is over 20%
676.16s: from where we started this a few months ago. It's again, not insane amounts of
680.00s: money is a percent return, but it's something that's been actually really
684.64s: consistent and compliments the broader portfolio really well. So as always,
689.68s: if you have any questions, let me know. Be an hour. See you all later.
