0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market recap. I want to walk through what we're seeing today,
4.32s: because I think a lot of people are starting to feel a little bit of pressure. So I want
7.00s: to talk about that. And then we're going to take a look at a little bit of GameStop,
11.00s: because we had an expiration today. And I will be stepping away from the daily videos
17.00s: for about a week. And then I'll be back online, getting right back after it towards the
21.28s: middle of August. So let's get into detail here. For those that don't know, I'm in the
28.00s: process of going through a rebrand. So you'll notice that the channel is no longer
31.28s: ES invests. It's outlier trading. I'm just trying to remove myself from the center of things,
36.44s: ESR, my initials. And I want it to be about the community. So this whole thing is grown
41.04s: in a completely different direction than I originally started the channel for, which was
44.28s: literally just sharing some information with my military friends. And I'm stoked to see
48.24s: it, but I want to make sure I'm moving with the way that our community is moving. So you'll
53.12s: notice I have a new website outlier trading dot IO. And pretty much everything else is
59.24s: going to be rebranded towards the outlier trading. So yeah, nothing really specific. But
64.16s: in case you need to get a hold of me, new email address, Eric at outlier trading dot IO,
70.04s: that kind of thing. But anyways, let's talk about the markets. So we're seeing broad
75.04s: sell off across the board. And a lot of this in my opinion is stemming from continued
81.52s: general weakness across the market. And the funny part about this is I don't even view
88.52s: things as quite that weak. Like what I'm seeing right now, I'm not saying, oh, whoa, this
95.52s: is crazy. But what I am seeing is non-farm payrolls has absolutely cratered. We can see
104.60s: that unemployment is going up. We can see that essentially the rate that was expected
112.08s: was 4.1, came at 4.3. So this is just continued general broad weakness against what we saw
120.56s: yesterday, which was also a layer of weakness. And there's an interesting thing that you'll
125.92s: notice because of this. If we grab the Fed watch tool here and we compare the probabilities,
132.04s: we'll now notice that the probability of a 50 basis point decrease is now up to 75%
142.28s: for the 18th of September. Why is this happening? Well, it's because as we're getting economic
147.16s: data that indicates economic weakness, the expectation is that big daddy J pow will
153.48s: then be forced to do something a little more drastic, a little faster. Because these
159.80s: kind of weaknesses are just showing cracks. But remember, these are all lagging indicators.
165.44s: So if it's not looking good now, even if we make a change right now, next month, it's
169.52s: not going to look good. The month after that, it's probably not going to look good. And
172.08s: you don't know exactly how bad it's going to get. So to me, that's also another reason
177.12s: why we're seeing the market behave this way. Because we've had one of the strongest
183.36s: first six months that we've ever seen. It was almost parabolic. The market was up the
188.84s: S&P 500 was up almost 20% in six months. That's insane. So when we're seeing some of this
194.56s: weakness coming out, the market already, in my opinion, was at a point where it was
199.24s: very frothy. People were buying hand over fist. Things still were very uncertain, but we
204.20s: were kind of just following the information we had at the time. And now that we're starting
208.48s: to see some weakness, I think you're seeing the market react, essentially as it should.
212.52s: I don't even think that this is an overreaction. If we take a look specifically at spy to
216.84s: start and all of a lot of people use spy people will hit me up when I use SPX and they'll
220.80s: say like, bro, nobody uses that point taken. So looking at the spy, you'll notice four
226.74s: days into the year we hit a low of 466. And then we essentially just went on a parabolic
231.88s: rally up until 522 in the beginning of April. Then we went from 522 ish down to a low of
240.84s: 493. So a very, very minor pullback and then back parabolic up to 565. So we're up almost
248.68s: 100 points on the year low to high. And then now we're down to 532 90. We're not even
254.92s: down 10%. We haven't even entered a correction and people are losing their minds. And part
260.76s: of this is rightfully so we've been in a very straight upwards moving market. But if this
267.32s: recent move is causing you any sort of stress concern your portfolio is behaving in a way that
272.92s: you weren't expecting, take this as a shot across the bow that you have problems. Meaning the way
280.04s: that you're structuring your portfolio, your trades, your risk is not good. Because if this is freaking
286.84s: you out, just imagine if this was actually bad. If we actually had a terrible, hopefully not,
293.80s: but a terrible series of events similar to black Monday, we're down 20% plus in a day.
301.24s: That can happen. So if you were so well positioned because you got overly complacent because the
308.12s: market was showing you one thing, this is good for you. This is a really good time to reassess what
313.96s: you're doing and make sure that your approach makes sense. And always, always remember the market
320.36s: goes to directions the worst day is always ahead of us. We haven't seen it yet. So if you position
325.64s: way too bullish because things are just overall too good because you don't want to miss out. Yeah,
330.28s: well, get ready for the shitty part of that. This is why you'll see me when the market is getting
336.20s: towards highs that I become more cautious because things are at a pretty pricey point there. So I
343.32s: won't compound of the market because I never know when it's going to start to capitulate, but I
347.80s: watch very closely. And anybody that's in the discord, they knows that I've already started
352.36s: rotating out of positions earlier this week. Part of it is because I'm, you know, taking a little bit
356.68s: of a break. But the other reason is just because we're near highs. And that's very standard fair
363.56s: for me. But we need to keep an eye on where these things go. Now, something like NASDAQ has a
369.00s: slightly different experience. And I think it's because it's had an even more aggressive move.
373.24s: It's gone from $3.95 low up to $503. That's a massive, massive move for this product. And from
382.04s: there, it's selling off hard. I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that tech is at a
388.36s: critical point here. And it has been so, so, so overbought with people just speculating upside
396.60s: profit potential, just focusing on the good stuff as they should, typically, I think. But then when
401.16s: we have earnings and we have this broader market weakness starting to show, well, stuff that's
406.68s: high flying typically is going to get burnt a little bit more. So if we take a quick look at
414.68s: what we're seeing, it's kind of just some continued weakness. So yesterday on the first,
419.48s: we had some weak manufacturing data. We had some weak productivity come through. Stuff like that
426.12s: didn't necessarily wow anybody. And then today we had a reinforcing of things like this.
433.24s: Non-farm payrolls cratered. We saw unemployment rate going up from 4.104.3. So the market is at
441.72s: a point now where it's just so interested in how this thing plays out. And you have to remember
446.52s: there's leads and lags. So if we're starting to see this kind of weakness now, the overwhelming
451.16s: probability is that what we see next month is not going to be super great. And until there's some
455.88s: sort of functional change. So the market now is trying to price in what they think big daddy,
461.24s: Jay, I was going to do. And if we take a look at the Fed watch tool, you can see that the probability
465.72s: now of a 50 basis point cut in September is over 70%. That's a massive change to what it was before.
474.76s: So if we compare that literally to just a day ago, that was a 22% probability. It's jumped up to
481.16s: 68.5% probability of this cut. Massive, massive change. And the reason for that is because we're
489.32s: seeing this weakness. And the expectation then is that it's going to force daddy, Jay,
494.04s: how to do something about it. And part of it is now the market is getting a little skittish because
498.84s: we don't know exactly what he's going to do about it. And we don't know how long it's going to
502.52s: take or to what degree. So what that means for me when I look at the broad market now is just
508.44s: cautious with the risk. This isn't a time to freak out. Nothing's gone that terrible yet.
513.88s: It definitely has the potential. We're absolutely at a point now where the queues isn't a correction.
519.24s: It just dropped a little over 10% total from this high. So that bears respect. But take a look,
525.72s: the 200 day moving average is still positive sloping. We're coming in on this giant point of control.
531.24s: Again, that's not to say that I can't go lower. I wouldn't be surprised at all if it did. But
535.80s: this also isn't some crazy bearish configuration yet yet. It can be. It can become. But the idea
545.24s: as me and the way that I look at this as a trader is I'm not going to trade necessarily those
551.00s: projections until I start to see more evidence that they're coming to fruition. Although I will
555.24s: consider them and I'll be ready to adjust to them when they come up. So long story short, market,
562.68s: pullback definitely underway, broad across everything. And this is one of those things that if I take
568.44s: a peek through the various sectors, it is impacting just about everything. There are some slight,
574.52s: slight areas of strength still like XLU. And I go back to this perpetually with you guys. You can
581.56s: see exactly where I was eyeballing getting in. And the thing with stuff like this is there are
589.00s: typically pockets of strength even when there's broad weakness. And I'm showing you one right here.
594.20s: There's plenty of others right now. Believe it or not, you just have to look for them. So there's
598.04s: always opportunity whether you want to go long, whether you want to go short, whatever you want to do,
602.92s: there's stuff in the market that can accommodate those positions. You just got to look a little bit.
607.96s: All right. Now let's get over to what the homies care about. Shout out to my eight peeps.
615.00s: Game stop. Inside day. Very inside day. So it was good to see just, I mean, even minor semblance
624.60s: of a green candle, but I didn't like that it opened below this. We are still in this downward trend.
629.80s: It's continuing. Now, when I take a look at the volume today, I am a little happier to see more
635.72s: of a clean split. So there was 54% by volume against 46% sale volume. That's good. That means that
642.84s: we're starting to get into these levels that people are interested in transacting at. And I've
646.68s: talked to you guys about this quite a few times where I see those currently. We can see this volume
650.92s: node building out right here still. It's not all the way developed, but at 1968. So it looks like
656.76s: something around 20 bucks is interesting to people. And then after that, the next volume node is at
661.56s: like 1798. But what this tells me is that there's still people at least interested in transacting,
666.76s: but we are still negative sloping. Like there's you can't it's an objective reality is I look
673.08s: at this. I know sometimes people don't like hearing that stuff, but I'll reiterate it to you for
677.72s: the millions of time, not here to spread hyperfut. I am just trying to share the information as
683.56s: objectively as I see it. And then you can take with it whatever you will. I see something that's
688.28s: downward sloping from this peak high or this term high I like to call them on 17 July. So what does
697.24s: this mean? Well, we need to see where people are more and more interested in transacting. And
702.76s: right here, you can see some pockets of that, right? The fact that there was 54% by volume mean
708.60s: that there are buyers interested at these levels, which is kind of exactly what I was expecting.
712.76s: Somewhere right around in here. And I think when I look at the prospects for GameStop going forward,
720.36s: the other problem that it's facing right now is just small caps are getting hammered. Small caps
725.40s: are struggling. And I think that people have to keep that in mind as we're looking at their future
733.48s: and their future impact on something like GameStop. So when I look at something like GameStop's
740.76s: options, I see this. The 20 September 22 puts there was 1600 of them bought at 345. 1600 might not
752.84s: seem like a giant trade, but it's not. That's a massive amount of money. So if I'm not mistaken,
759.96s: I think this trade is like over half a million dollars. It's like 552K. So somebody is trying to
768.68s: take GameStop to the downside via some long puts, which is really interesting to me because GameStop
775.64s: puts are still very expensive for what they are. So the fact that somebody's willing to pay up like
781.16s: that, I can't help but find curious. And I feel like the only reason why you put on a position
787.16s: that size with something that's already gone down quite as much as if you expect more. But I have
792.36s: to look at it as, I mean, how much more do you expect it to go maybe down again to like this 18
798.92s: handle before you might look at managing that trade or something, but that's an interesting one
803.56s: that I'm going to keep an eye on. Now, as always, we got to pour one out for the homies because
809.40s: there's a ton of options that expired today. Worthless. Tons of them. Tens of thousands. God.
816.60s: Salute to the homies.
821.16s: It's a Arnold Palmer, by the way, very good. So this again, not shocking at all, kind of
828.68s: standard fare for GameStop where this near-term expiration gets hammered pretty good.
833.64s: Now for total OI, I am seeing thankfully the call side expand, but so is the put side. So we have
840.12s: 723,000 calls to 390,000 puts. And you can see a lot of these puts are being put on. Get it
848.12s: further out in time. So we're seeing much more diversification in terms of the put expiration cycles
853.72s: as compared to the calls. The calls are very centered in 16 aug still. So it looks like next week,
861.16s: nine aug is quiet. It does not look like there's a whole lot going on for the options, chains,
867.72s: voles pretty low, 103.84%. But we can see 16 aug voles already higher there, 109, definitely more
875.32s: active and much more positioned building going on in here. So this is I think where I'm keeping an
882.44s: eyeball on going forward. Now, last thing I want to know really, really quick is when I'm playing
888.36s: something like GameStop personally, I still have the shares. I've talked about them before,
892.84s: but I'm not long any options right now and I'm waiting to go long options. And what I'm doing is
898.36s: as GameStop is going down like this, I like to set alerts like this. And as I see it cross
904.12s: above these different thresholds, then I will consider starting to build out and add a position.
911.24s: But I like to wait until it's starting to move in the correct direction as compared to buying it
916.44s: on the way down. Because I do not know when it's going to stop. But that's me as traitor for other
921.72s: people, the idea is to dollar cost average in on a regular basis and that can work out really,
925.80s: really well. But that's what I'm looking at. As always, any questions, anything, let me know.
931.56s: The next live stream is tonight at 5 p.m. Pacific time. It's outlier,
935.88s: option trading for beginners. We got a bunch of stuff to cover there. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys
940.52s: later.
