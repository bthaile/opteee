0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
65.00s: you
70.00s: you
74.00s: you
77.00s: you
81.00s: what's up
84.00s: outliers we have I think our final
88.00s: options trading for beginners session for today.
93.32s: So I am slightly, I don't know,
99.80s: I mean, we'll still do the live sessions on Friday,
101.88s: but I'm gonna pivot away from like this specific focus
105.28s: necessarily on like a topic.
107.80s: It'll still be for beginners,
109.64s: but I'm gonna leave it to be a little bit more open-ended.
114.80s: So the goal of the session for today is actually
119.80s: to walk through a path forward
123.96s: and to talk about three of the biggest mistakes that I see
129.04s: and hopefully the goal here would give you some ideas
133.20s: on how this trading journey will look like
136.96s: for you going forward.
138.84s: So I am very excited to get into this.
142.16s: I'm also very excited because I have a new self-inflating
146.88s: lumbar support thing so that I can apparently
150.56s: hopefully sit a little more comfortably,
153.08s: looking forward to that.
154.80s: But as you know, we gotta say hello to everybody.
157.64s: Let me grab this chat and let's get right in.
160.96s: So a few things right from the jump.
162.96s: As always, this is a live session.
165.48s: So feel free to jump in with anything that you wanna cover.
170.48s: That is the entire goal.
171.76s: I'm gonna get through some set material first
174.56s: and then we'll go more into like the open-ended side of things,
177.64s: but yeah, come with whatever you wanna talk about.
181.92s: All right, so the starting point for the session today
184.56s: is three common beginner mistakes.
188.24s: And there's essentially an entire listicle series you can do
191.72s: off of this.
192.56s: You can do 10, 15, 20, 50.
193.92s: Like there's a bunch of trade or mistakes.
196.12s: But the goal for this is to talk about it
199.32s: in kind of a broad sense.
202.56s: And the reason why I wanna talk about it in a broad sense
205.68s: is because I think that by covering these broader topics,
212.76s: I think you will have some tools to then build out
217.44s: going forward that cover specifics.
220.12s: So as most of the stuff that I do,
222.68s: you're not gonna get a lot of highly prescriptive things
226.36s: like never do blank.
228.40s: Because guess what?
229.92s: Like I've learned in my trading career
232.76s: that sometimes there is a time and reason to do whatever
236.72s: it is that you're never supposed to do.
238.20s: So I don't really speak in absolutes.
240.76s: So let's talk about where this begins.
245.12s: And it starts on this blank screen,
247.20s: but the first thing I actually wanna start with before
249.60s: I bring up the first item that I think is a really common
253.12s: mistake is I wanna ask you in the chat.
256.20s: So if you were to summarize the top three
261.52s: biggest trading mistakes,
264.44s: focused a little bit on options traders obviously,
268.16s: what would you guess they are?
269.76s: And you can throw one, two, or three.
272.44s: I wanna give you a few seconds to think about that.
275.00s: And while you're answering, my guess is
279.64s: we are going to see a highly varied set of answers.
284.76s: And I want to highlight that,
286.20s: the fact that I'm expecting a highly varied set of answers.
290.88s: Because if I don't see a highly varied set of answers,
296.72s: obviously I would be completely wrong,
298.32s: but my guess is that your answers
302.72s: are actually going to introduce my first point,
306.36s: which I'm excited for.
308.56s: So Rhys says for myself, we're all traders, whatever,
312.84s: it's up to you.
316.20s: Joey says probably a profit versus expectancy
319.28s: that's a really interesting one.
321.72s: Roaring Titty is focusing on changing stops
324.88s: and not thinking about entries and exits, I like that.
328.12s: Brad says expiring too soon,
330.96s: things that are out of the money, I think that's a good one.
333.96s: He long song says not knowing how to roll covered calls,
336.80s: another really good one.
337.92s: So a lot of I would qualify these as kind of tactical levels.
342.36s: So for those that are unfamiliar with like the military
345.56s: hierarchy crap, I just dropped my thing one second,
348.84s: I can grab that.
352.56s: Literally just.
358.80s: I just scared the crap out of Thor
360.40s: because I dropped my little tablet when I was trying to grab it.
364.56s: And Thor was just like, yo,
367.72s: I'm not here for that.
369.52s: He's literally sitting at like alert right now.
382.12s: All right, we had to make sure that the homie was good.
385.28s: So for those that don't know,
386.88s: the military kind of thinks about different layers
391.08s: and levels very specifically with respect
394.52s: to how we organize stuff.
396.72s: So when we talk about trading,
400.64s: a lot of what I do is adaptations of what I've learned
403.56s: in the military.
404.64s: So one of the things here is we have strategic level.
412.80s: Then we have operational.
419.48s: And then we have tactical.
421.64s: So I'm not here to teach you about military history
428.44s: and orders, process and stuff like that.
430.28s: This is all going to be trading focused.
432.12s: I just want these relationships to make sense to you
434.84s: as I use them because it's literally how I talk about this stuff.
438.36s: So just think strategic is like the 30K,
441.44s: even bigger than that probably.
443.00s: Call it like the 100,000 foot view.
446.12s: And then maybe call this like the 30K foot view.
449.68s: And then we would call this kind of like frontline.
456.12s: So essentially a lot of the things that you highlighted to me.
460.40s: So things like probability of profit versus expectancy,
464.12s: I would bucket that here.
466.16s: Something like changing stops, bad entries, exits,
469.80s: I would bucket that here.
471.76s: Something like buying options that expire too soon
474.60s: like Brad's talking about, I would bucket that here.
477.92s: Something like not knowing how to roll covered calls.
480.68s: Very specific.
481.92s: That's very tactical.
484.80s: Taking profits early, which is kind of a dovetail off of Joey,
488.64s: I would probably bucket that here.
492.60s: That Lauren says for getting to look at theta,
495.00s: I would bucket that here.
499.52s: Ricky says taking profits early doesn't seem like a big issue
502.60s: better than watching your trade go red.
505.32s: We have, we now have a really important conversation to have
510.72s: because anybody that knows me is probably,
516.24s: I am going to disagree vehemently with Ricky vehemently.
520.88s: And Ricky's, their position is not unfounded.
525.12s: I understand that mindset.
527.32s: And it's because that's one of the perversions of the trader mindset.
532.12s: Is your thought that that's supposed to be enlightened, right?
535.96s: The idea of take a smaller profit rather than let your trade run red, right?
540.12s: That sounds not greedy.
542.60s: It sounds like you're doing the right things,
545.60s: but it's actually not enlightened at all.
549.04s: Unfortunately.
549.76s: So Ricky, it's a completely reasonable thing to say.
553.76s: I would have said the same thing.
555.80s: Like there's absolutely nothing wrong with that as a theory.
559.76s: The problem is it's a perverted theory that people don't fully understand.
565.64s: So we'll talk about that in a little bit, but ear market because what you brought up
572.04s: is completely fair and it's so common.
575.72s: And I want to make sure we talk about that specifically,
578.28s: but absolutely fantastic point.
583.60s: Vladimir says I close some calls.
586.80s: Reese says Eric might disagree.
588.80s: One of the biggest things I've learned from him.
590.16s: Yeah, exactly.
590.92s: Reese's spot on.
591.76s: I do disagree.
593.08s: Cedric says looking at macro economic events.
595.92s: That's interesting because I actually don't think that's bad.
599.92s: I think over waiting it wouldn't be good,
602.84s: but I would call macro economic events probably somewhere like here.
607.60s: I would call it maybe operational.
609.60s: Maybe a little bit of strategic, but mostly operational level still.
613.80s: Rohingtitty.
615.40s: Rohingtitty, everybody shout out to Rohingtitty.
617.96s: One of the greatest names on earth says, uh oh, triggered.
621.80s: Cedric says I am of the belief most money is lost,
626.68s: not in a recession, but preventing one.
629.48s: It's the same with taking profit, taking on trading.
633.52s: That confuses me a little bit.
636.88s: I think we'll talk about it a little bit,
639.28s: but the idea about profit taking is not.
641.96s: Most people I notice, especially when I'll take a position on something,
645.72s: they'll generally think that if I disagree with a position that then I inherently
651.72s: mean the inverse, which is actually very rarely the case.
655.76s: But I think something like profit taking the way I would bucket it broadly
661.80s: is that it's very, very nuanced, which we'll talk about.
666.68s: And Mike says, hey, fellas, Mike,
670.64s: it's fellas and ladies to you.
673.44s: I would, I will happily let you know, hold on,
676.32s: let me check my YouTube analytics right now.
679.04s: I am overflowing with female audience members.
683.28s: It's like, it's incredible how many, what's your guess?
687.72s: If you were to speculate how many male versus female as a percentage,
692.96s: what's the percentage you would guess here?
696.36s: I'm going to start a poll.
698.68s: What percentage of Eric's audience is male?
714.00s: Less than 10%, we'll do 25% to make it faster.
719.36s: Less than 25, 25 to 50%.
727.68s: I'm going to do like 50, 75%.
742.68s: Okay, so most, all right, well, I realized that the poll is,
745.92s: you guys are all way closer than I was expecting.
748.40s: I thought I might have misled you well enough,
750.12s: so I actually need to reconfigure my poll,
753.24s: because apparently I didn't trick anybody.
755.72s: So we'll do like 80.
759.32s: I think there's actually enough responses in here.
761.04s: I can probably just guess.
764.40s: So I see 80%, 99%, 93%, I see Lauren raising her hand,
772.52s: offering herself as the notification
776.80s: that there is a female.
777.84s: Roryne Titty is letting us know that there is a second female with us.
783.72s: So yeah, fun fact, it is 94.4% male, 5.7% female.
794.48s: And then it looks like the bulk for Brad says under 35,
801.80s: fascinating enough, it's not.
803.84s: So under 35 is 27.4% at 25 to 34,
809.52s: and then 4% 18 to 24.
813.52s: So the bulk of my people, this is actually news to me.
818.32s: The bulk of my people are 35 to 44, 34% with 20% 45 to 54,
825.88s: and then 10%, 55 to 64, and then 4% 65 plus.
833.08s: Fascinating, that was actually kind of fun.
835.32s: I didn't, I wouldn't have guessed some of that myself.
839.80s: Vladimir says, wait, how do you know the gender, Eric?
844.48s: It's a great question, because what do you,
846.48s: what even is a, I'm in California.
849.40s: So I don't even know what a fucking gender is at this point.
852.92s: So yeah, I mean, one of my favorite things to do,
855.60s: I'm not even kidding is when I go places like physical therapy
858.04s: and whatnot, and like you're filling out the forms,
859.88s: I literally will fuck around and I'll say that,
862.56s: oh, I'm obviously a female.
864.32s: Like it's kind of shocking to me that you could
867.92s: think I'm anything else, but, and that's obviously for the people that,
872.92s: you know, are trans or whatever it is,
876.40s: like whatever makes you happy makes me happy,
878.44s: but I also like to play games and fuck around with people,
880.68s: because it's fun.
881.76s: And I think it's completely fair that most people would assume I'm male.
886.08s: It's a, it's a fair guess, but it's very fun in California to,
891.08s: like every time I go donate blood.
895.32s: My favorite thing is if I have the ability to fill out a form before I go.
900.68s: And then I get to, because then obviously they're expecting something,
904.56s: and then normally I'll do, you know, that I'm a six foot,
910.28s: 223 pound female, and I just find that very entertaining.
917.24s: It's very confusing to people, which I'm here for.
921.16s: So, Brad says, what percentage of your audience is non-binary?
927.04s: Actually, it showed 0% as like non-disclosed.
929.72s: I think it calls it not necessarily non-binary, but,
934.56s: Joey says Eric is going to get estrogen by accident one day.
938.00s: That would be hilarious, because actually,
940.88s: if you get some estrogen, it can actually spike testosterone,
947.12s: because testosterone starts to counteract the excess estrogen.
950.64s: So maybe that's the way to do it.
953.68s: Roaring Titty says Native Americans recognize several genders as well.
957.04s: Yeah, definitely.
958.08s: Well, I think the problem is, well, I don't want to get into that debate.
961.12s: But yeah, I think I like telling people when I'm going to an appointment,
967.20s: that I'm female, because I find it funny.
969.04s: But beyond that, that Lauren says, I'm so old that when the
973.76s: one in the ass, I'm in a medical forms, what pro-knowing I know was,
976.16s: I didn't know what it meant.
976.96s: Same.
977.68s: That one's also very funny to me.
979.92s: But I just come from like, just treat everybody with respect,
985.68s: as long as there's mutual respect.
987.36s: I don't give a fuck.
988.88s: That's how I feel.
990.72s: So, back to trading, though, a lot of the things that you all highlighted,
996.08s: in my opinion, fall in this bucket, the very, very tactical level bucket.
1001.44s: And that's okay.
1002.40s: This actually is in line with what I would expect a newer trader to think they should be focusing on,
1011.12s: is the very tactical level of things.
1014.40s: Now, if you know anything about me or the content that I produce,
1018.24s: you're probably going to be a little upset for this video about three common beginner mistakes,
1023.44s: because we're actually going to spend all of the time up here.
1027.76s: And here's why.
1030.08s: If you get the strategic and operational components of trading down,
1036.00s: literally, the tactical level of trading will straight up take care of itself.
1043.60s: It will take care of itself.
1044.64s: And I know that sounds weird assofteric, but it's really not.
1047.68s: It really is not, and you'll see why.
1050.48s: So, the goal here is to try and offer a way to model and think about trading that's sustainable
1058.80s: in does well.
1060.32s: Cedric says strategic guess, valuing the company, even higher level than that.
1066.56s: So, in a trading way, well, it kind of like in a trading language,
1073.36s: the way that I think about the strategic level, that was a fun squeal line,
1077.76s: the way I think about the strategic level is like we're literally talking about things like
1081.84s: philosophy.
1084.24s: We're talking about self-awareness.
1091.60s: We're talking about habits and dependencies.
1096.48s: So, at this strategic level, we're talking about literally what governs everything else we do.
1111.60s: At the operational level is how we trade.
1119.20s: What's our approach?
1120.88s: What do we think we do?
1122.72s: That's operational level.
1124.24s: What's the broad mandates that we follow?
1127.28s: Tactical level is the execution of the skill set.
1135.60s: So, let's now take a look at what Eric seems to believe these three mistakes are.
1144.08s: We'll start with the very first one, lack of structure.
1149.04s: Does this surprise you in the least that I would call this out?
1154.88s: Like, to me, as I think about the very first mistake,
1162.08s: every single option trader makes, myself included, is a complete and utter lack of structure.
1170.80s: 100%.
1172.80s: So, for example, I have another question for the chat.
1176.00s: If you were to tell somebody, these are the first three things you need to learn
1184.64s: in order to be an options trader.
1188.32s: What are those things?
1190.08s: What would you tell them?
1190.96s: And I'll give you a few moments to throw it in the chat.
1193.28s: You can list one, two, or three whatever you want.
1195.76s: But I want to know from each person that's willing to participate, what are the three things?
1201.44s: You would tell somebody that says, hey, I want to be an options trader.
1205.60s: What are the first three things I should do?
1208.32s: What are those?
1210.40s: And again, what I'm going to highlight is something that I don't think most people consider.
1217.12s: So, so far, Cedric says, understand the mechanics of options and why they are used,
1222.00s: completely fair.
1222.88s: I think that that's very reasonable.
1225.68s: Joe says risk management, also completely reasonable.
1229.52s: Elon's song says block some time to learn.
1232.08s: Got to create a space in order to pick up the skill set makes a ton of sense.
1235.92s: Off Putin says paper trade first.
1238.32s: I also think that that's a fair answer.
1241.12s: Roaring Titi says position size stops something, something delta.
1246.16s: Fair.
1246.88s: I don't think anything.
1248.00s: Those are like good foundational concepts.
1252.00s: Paulo says learn technical analysis.
1253.76s: You got to figure out what you want to trade.
1255.84s: That Lauren says learn the Greeks.
1257.52s: We need to know how options behave.
1260.88s: I'd rather be skiing says risk slash money management.
1264.64s: So we've seen that one the very first one twice now.
1267.44s: That's the only thing we've seen twice so far.
1269.68s: Create a plan system.
1271.20s: Create rules to follow that plan and never deviate.
1275.20s: Let's talk about that one just a little bit in a second.
1278.80s: Joey says purpose and portfolio fit.
1280.96s: Got to know what we're trying to do with our money.
1283.04s: So let's.
1286.56s: Brad says learn to control your emotions.
1288.96s: Huge one.
1289.44s: We're actually going to talk about that one.
1291.52s: So let's go to I'd rather be skiing's comment.
1294.56s: Specifically the create rules to follow that plan and never deviate.
1301.76s: So if I were let's let's say a jujitsu player.
1307.92s: And let's say that I'm a white belt.
1310.64s: I'm brand and I actually technically I'm a white belt because I've been a jujitsu dude.
1315.28s: My whole life essentially for like 15 years.
1317.28s: But I've been in a gee like four times.
1319.60s: So technically I am a white belt.
1321.12s: I actually love being able to tell that people with a clear conscience.
1325.04s: So.
1328.00s: If I'm working with a brand new white belt.
1332.56s: Is it fair for me to say.
1336.24s: Is it fair for me to say to a white belt.
1339.76s: Create your own approach to jujitsu and never deviate from it.
1345.04s: Make your own and never deviate from it.
1348.56s: Do we think that that's.
1350.24s: Reasonable.
1351.92s: For me to tell a brand new jujitsu player.
1356.16s: No, doesn't make sense does it.
1360.32s: But we say all the time in trading.
1362.16s: We say it all the time in trading.
1364.32s: We tell new traders.
1366.32s: Make a plan and never deviate.
1370.00s: Because it sounds good.
1371.84s: It makes sense.
1374.00s: But guess what?
1375.36s: They're the last person that's in a place to make something that they should never deviate from.
1382.72s: They don't even know what they don't know yet.
1385.04s: And again, I'd rather be skiing.
1386.64s: There's absolutely nothing wrong with what you said because it makes sense.
1390.32s: That's another thing that you absolutely consider as a new trader because you'll hear that.
1397.52s: But again, it's just not logical.
1401.20s: OMG legend says 15 year white belt.
1403.36s: I think if you're grappling in BJJ for 15 years, you're grappling and not ranked via a belt.
1408.16s: I mean, technically speaking, they still will like we still do belts for no gui.
1413.36s: But it's like non-traditional.
1414.96s: That's why I make the joke.
1415.92s: It's like in a traditional sense.
1418.48s: I literally have been in a kimono like literally less than a handful of times.
1423.28s: So in a traditional sense, I am absolutely a white belt.
1427.68s: But yeah, I mean, I've been grappling the vast majority of my adult life.
1432.56s: It's actually super fun too.
1433.92s: Like I said, it's always hilarious to me.
1435.68s: Like if I'm traveling somewhere and I go to a new gym and they're like,
1438.80s: what level are you?
1439.60s: Again, I can say with a clean soul.
1441.12s: Like I am a white belt.
1443.04s: But that's not my skill level.
1445.44s: I don't think.
1446.80s: But it's my technical level.
1448.64s: So pretty fun.
1451.20s: So anyways,
1454.72s: in this context back to trading,
1457.84s: as you guys could tell, right?
1458.96s: Like the same thing when I'm doing the doctor stuff.
1460.96s: I just like fucking with people.
1462.48s: I just like these little jokes, specifically that denigrate me more often than not.
1467.12s: But I like jokes.
1469.04s: I think it's fun.
1470.24s: Yeah, exactly.
1471.04s: Joey picked up on it exactly.
1472.32s: I just like playing with people.
1473.52s: It's fun.
1474.40s: Another one of my favorite things to do is whenever I donate blood.
1477.36s: And they say like, Oh, are you scared of needles or anything?
1479.76s: I always tell them that I'm fucking terrified.
1482.80s: And every time it's like magic, they end up pairing me with like this really tiny nurse
1488.08s: that's always super sweet and nice to me.
1490.24s: And then every time I stand up after donate, I pretend to pass out to see what they would do.
1494.96s: Fun fact, all of them would let me drop on my fucking face.
1498.72s: But I love doing that too.
1500.56s: It's too funny.
1501.60s: It's way too funny.
1503.84s: So yeah, I enjoy having some fun with people.
1506.56s: It's a good time.
1508.16s: So if we think about though,
1511.52s: exactly what we're talking about
1516.48s: with like a new trader creating their own rules set, very difficult to do that.
1521.04s: So then how do we get there?
1523.12s: Let's say,
1525.36s: Oh, Joey.
1528.80s: I haven't thought of that one.
1530.56s: Joey, that one's actually hilarious.
1533.92s: Joey says whenever I go out to eat, I order something and then when they ask if I have allergies,
1538.24s: I say one of the main ingredients.
1542.40s: I literally love that.
1543.92s: It's like
1546.64s: getting a pizza and be like, Oh, yeah, I'm allergic to flour.
1550.16s: Can't do flour.
1552.24s: I love that.
1552.80s: That's so fun.
1553.68s: All right.
1555.68s: So lack of structure.
1557.20s: Where does this all go with lack of structure?
1559.84s: It's super simple.
1561.36s: The idea is if I were to tell somebody, you need to teach a 10-year-old,
1570.16s: let's just say the 10-year-old is a non-native English speaker.
1576.32s: And you need to teach a 10-year-old how to speak English.
1580.80s: What's the very first thing you would have them learn?
1584.08s: The very first thing.
1585.20s: Throw that in the chat.
1586.88s: My guess is we'll probably find a little bit more of a trend here.
1591.52s: That's my hypothesis.
1597.44s: Run, spot, run.
1600.16s: I'm assuming that's a reference to something, but I actually don't know what that's from.
1605.04s: Alphabet is what Brad says.
1607.12s: Vialobo says picture books.
1614.40s: Follow says common words.
1617.28s: I'd rather be skiing says maybe saying their name in another person's name.
1620.88s: Okay.
1621.36s: So Joey goes with IU, they them us we.
1627.36s: Okay.
1630.24s: I'm not going to lie.
1630.96s: This is more varied than I thought.
1633.52s: But it still highlights an interesting point.
1636.40s: Because I can see some very common threads as I look at this.
1641.36s: So Brad is starting with the alphabet.
1644.64s: What are the letters?
1645.44s: What are the symbols we use to represent noise?
1648.80s: And then other folks like Vialobo,
1652.00s: Paulo,
1654.80s: Vladimir, I'd rather be skiing.
1656.72s: They're going with more the practical approach.
1659.36s: Right?
1660.08s: So those are like two giant differences between the methodology that we literally just
1665.04s: summarized if somebody was to start to learn English.
1668.08s: We have the structural approach.
1672.56s: Alphabet.
1676.00s: And then Joey used like specific words or phrases.
1681.84s: And then there's kind of a more experiential approach.
1689.76s: This is more go watch a movie with subtitles.
1695.76s: This is talk with kids.
1701.76s: Is your you know outplaying with them or whatever?
1707.92s: If we look at this, there's two kind of general approaches here.
1712.96s: But what's common behind all of this?
1717.60s: The main commonality I see is we're starting with basics.
1721.68s: However, we get to those basics, but we start with basics.
1725.28s: Okay.
1726.24s: So now why am I going through this example with you?
1729.68s: It's because I'm trying to highlight a completely different model that we apply in trading.
1736.72s: So one more example and then I promise I'll tie it in.
1740.72s: If I were trying to teach somebody math, right?
1746.48s: Let's say that they're new to math.
1748.72s: What are some of the beginning ways that I would teach them math?
1753.36s: I would probably start with things like derivatives or maybe I'll start with like proofs.
1762.32s: No, obviously not.
1764.88s: I would start with numbers.
1766.96s: I would start with addition, subtraction.
1770.08s: Maybe, maybe hit them over the head with some pendoz.
1774.80s: Maybe then move them to algebra.
1778.64s: Sumoatis is taxes.
1781.60s: That's the last thing I would teach somebody that's new to math because I wouldn't want them to quit on life before they even started.
1787.44s: I feel like that would just be absolutely brutal.
1799.52s: So when we look at the learning process though for something like math,
1805.92s: what I'm highlighting is regardless of your background with math,
1813.68s: there's a general approach you would take.
1815.60s: You would start with some basic shit.
1818.00s: You would then start with some less basic shit.
1820.80s: Then you would go to some moderate shit.
1822.96s: Then some like medium moderate shit.
1825.12s: And this happens like year over year over year.
1829.68s: This happens with a teacher showing you how to do it.
1832.96s: This happens with exams.
1836.00s: This happens with quizzes.
1837.44s: This happens with projects.
1839.20s: Yes, I actually had fucking math projects.
1841.44s: You want to talk about a demoralizing event.
1844.00s: Do a math project.
1846.56s: So when we look at the process of learning math or really anything else,
1852.16s: it's a very building block approach because exactly to Brad's point,
1855.76s: still got to learn numbers.
1856.72s: He's 100% correct.
1857.68s: It's the same thing when we're talking about learning English.
1860.24s: If you're going to learn English to be able to speak, read, and write,
1864.72s: you still have to know the fucking alphabet.
1867.12s: So there's basic things that you learned.
1869.20s: Yet, if I go back up to what you guys told me,
1873.20s: you would tell a brand new options trader they should start with.
1877.60s: I saw things like risk management, which is good.
1880.72s: There's nothing wrong with that.
1882.32s: But that's pretty specific.
1884.16s: I saw something about probability of profit versus expectancy.
1888.32s: I would see a common mistake of not knowing how to roll covered calls.
1893.84s: So if we're talking about first steps, there is stuff like learn technical analysis.
1900.00s: Shit.
1901.04s: What is technical analysis?
1902.72s: If I'm a new options trader, what the fuck does that even mean?
1907.68s: So what I'm highlighting and hopefully delivering together with a bow is that
1913.28s: the first step for a new options trader is to build a fucking structure to learn
1919.52s: because you are in the wild west.
1924.24s: There's nobody out there telling you what to do.
1928.08s: There's nobody out there that's quizzing you on what you've learned.
1931.92s: There's nobody out there giving you practice fucking problems.
1936.08s: It is you, the individual.
1939.28s: It is all you.
1941.28s: So the whole point here, and this is again, why I built this exact thing for us.
1949.12s: And this isn't even what I would consider to be like the ultimate end state.
1953.12s: This is just something to offer somebody so that you have something.
1957.36s: Because I recognize that there's a giant gap for this.
1962.24s: That people want to start talking about things like probability of profit versus expectancy,
1967.84s: which is a really important lesson.
1969.68s: But should that happen before compounding interest is well understood?
1974.72s: And my guess is just like if we all took myself included,
1978.96s: if we all took a basic math test that like a five year old had to take,
1982.80s: we probably would not get all of those questions right.
1985.04s: I would guess because you know how that goes.
1986.48s: Sometimes those kind of math problems can be like really, really specific.
1990.72s: The point is is even people that are really well seasoned traders, my guess is,
1995.44s: if you go through these starting modules like this,
2000.40s: you'll probably find a bunch of shit that you don't know.
2003.84s: Probably.
2004.96s: So even though we're trying to operate down here on using
2009.68s: intraday gecks in zero DTE SPX options to inform entry periods,
2016.96s: we might not know some of the fundamental concepts that govern literally the process of trading
2023.20s: or learning. Notice how the humor of all of this is, and I will continue to reiterate this point
2030.96s: because I think it's very important, is that the question I say is most common option trader mistakes,
2040.32s: I haven't even mentioned the fucking word options yet.
2046.24s: I haven't even said the word because it doesn't matter.
2051.12s: It options themselves are just vehicles. We have to get a lot of other things
2060.00s: solidified first before we even think about options, which leads us to the next common mistake.
2070.56s: It's a broken foundation to options or trading in general because most options traders
2080.72s: immediately start jumping in somewhere like here.
2087.76s: This is where we have an option trader that's relatively new, maybe they've studied options for
2092.96s: a few months or a few years, and they're like, well, let me, this is going to be my strategy because
2097.68s: I'm supposed to make a plan that I never deviate from. So my plan is going to be to buy seven day
2104.96s: options that are at a 15 delta because they're really cheap and it controls my risk.
2110.56s: That's what I'm supposed to do. That's another thing that we covered that is super important,
2115.04s: is risk management. So if I buy these call options, then I'm controlling my risk from the jump,
2121.92s: and then I'm going to exit the trade every single time it's up two dollars because the other
2127.76s: thing I was taught is that I'm supposed to manage my winning trades because I can't let a winning trade
2134.80s: turn into a losing trade. That's another thing that I'm not supposed to do. So I'm doing a good
2141.36s: job now, right? I'm creating a plan that I'm never going to deviate from. I'm managing risk.
2146.00s: I'm not letting winning trades turn into losing trades. Guess what? That trader's going to
2152.56s: fucking fail straight up. That trader that's following all of the rules and doing the right things
2159.68s: is straight up going to fail. And it's because they are focusing on the entire wrong
2166.48s: shit. They're focusing on the entire wrong stuff. It doesn't even matter yet.
2171.36s: And that's why I try to highlight, I'm calling it the big four trade process because in my opinion,
2179.28s: these are the big four steps that have to happen if you want to be a successful trader.
2188.08s: Every single trade, these four steps have to happen. So before I determine if I want to sell
2196.72s: 30 DTE option, 10 DTE option, five delta, or if I want to buy the 15 delta, none of that matters.
2207.68s: If I don't have a completely clear line of sight on what the profit mechanism is,
2215.76s: what is it that I'm making money from? The second step is to create a signal.
2225.76s: We need to measure the profit mechanism as it sits. We need to know when the profit mechanism
2233.04s: exists. And we need to understand the qualities of the profit mechanism.
2242.16s: So that leads us to our next spot. And what do you notice so far? This is again a video
2253.36s: about option trader mistakes. What's the, what's what do you notice? I still haven't even said the word
2260.88s: options. I got through the first mistake with not using the word options. It's in there because
2268.32s: you do need to learn about options once you develop structure, but the mistake of lacking structure
2272.64s: is nothing to do with options. The next thing broke trade foundation. The first things as part of
2280.16s: the big four trade process is not about options at all. Literally at all. You don't get to even
2289.76s: worry about options until you get here. That's all there is to it because here's why.
2300.80s: If I'm worried about if I'm going to buy a 30 delta call or buy a 20 delta call,
2309.60s: that's what I care about. What happens if the underlying goes down? If I buy a 30 delta call
2317.60s: or if I buy the 10 delta call, 15 delta call, what happens? Underline goes down.
2329.44s: Any guesses? Lose money. That's exactly correct. Reese is 100% correct. You fucking lose money.
2339.20s: And Joey adds a little color around it, which is important, right? You lose money depending
2344.00s: on what it is. So the way and the quality that you lose money, the circumstances will be slightly
2349.28s: different. But guess what? You fucking lose money. Same thing to the inverse. Let's say that I'm
2358.88s: deciding if I should sell a put or buy a call. Sell a put or buy a call. Underline goes up.
2366.80s: What happens to my trade? If I sell a put or buy a call and the underlying goes up, what happens?
2381.68s: Any guesses?
2390.24s: Make money defined with put. Cedric says depending on IV, not so much.
2395.52s: Joey says depends not so much. Doesn't
2400.72s: Brad says say it again. I'll say it again for the homies in the back. If I sell a put or buy a call
2408.64s: and the underlying price goes up, what happens?
2413.20s: Roryn Clity says P and L moons potentially on the right path. Roryn Titty says income is capped
2420.40s: on selling the put. Correct. Joey says, well, if the call goes up, if it goes up a little,
2427.28s: the call may lose money. Not in that scenario because we haven't added anything about volatility.
2434.08s: So even we haven't talked about the passage of time. Literally just saying if I buy a call,
2438.96s: underlying goes up. Not adding any other qualifiers. I'm not saying time is past. I'm not saying
2445.12s: volatility has changed. Simply underlying has gone up. Cedric says make money then. It's exactly
2451.20s: correct. The point I'm making here is that if I sell a put or buy a call and the underlying goes
2459.36s: up, I fucking make money. I make money. So what I'm trying to highlight to you is that this is
2470.72s: this is trading. This is trading. I'm going to keep saying this is trading. This here.
2478.80s: This is what trading is. Because once you understand this, then you can figure out how to best fit
2489.44s: what you're doing for your circumstance. But it doesn't matter what you end up choosing if it's
2497.84s: built on a faulty foundation. That doesn't matter. You have to understand profit mechanisms first
2509.60s: signals second. That is unequivocally the case. Because then if I'm a new options trader,
2519.28s: but I'm really good at understanding profit mechanisms, I've put in the time to understand things
2524.96s: like post earnings announcement drift. I understand variance or premiums. I understand the market
2529.76s: exhibits positive drift. I understand that if something crosses below a 50 day moving average
2534.96s: on average for this specific product, it'll fall to a maximum of x percent before after certain
2540.64s: amount of days it rallies back up above it. That's all simple research to do. And once that's done,
2548.32s: then I can either sell the put or buy a call. It doesn't matter. I'm going to make money either way.
2554.16s: So then I can say, okay, I can fairly reliably identify this profit mechanism as it sits.
2562.32s: I understand when it happens because I've tested different signals. I understand the behavior
2570.40s: of the profit mechanism. Then I can figure out what structures generally fit with the profit mechanism.
2578.96s: Again, something goes up short call. I'm sorry short put long call either or totally fine.
2585.20s: And then I can build strategies about those structures that let me maximize things. So for example,
2595.44s: if I'm trading something like let's look at JPM. If I look at something like JPM and I see it
2604.24s: rallying up here, let's just say I'm bullish for whatever reason. I don't have anything in JPM.
2608.40s: Just using it as a random example. So I see a few things, right? Higher lows, higher highs,
2614.64s: bit of a decline, but still a higher low that's now rallying up and out. Let's just say I'm bullish
2619.28s: for whatever reason. If I'm bullish in here, the next part of what I need to do is say how bullish
2626.16s: in and what timeframe do I think that this is going to skyrocket from 211 to 225? Maybe,
2632.72s: maybe I do, maybe I don't. It depends on the individual trader. But what I'm going to tell you
2637.84s: is that if I think it's going to go from 211 to 225 in the next week, I'm going to put on a different
2644.88s: trade than if I think it might take a month to get from 211 to 225. Or maybe I think it might
2652.72s: catch up to this high in here and then stall out. That's still up. I can still make money on it
2659.20s: going up. But instead of buying a ratio call diagonal, maybe I sell puts. Maybe that complements
2667.44s: the portfolio better. But the point is we have to clearly identify what it is we're trying to trade
2676.80s: and then we have to study it so that we understand how it behaves. Another great example is if I'm
2683.36s: running any sort of breakout trade. So here, I'm going to look for things that have consolidated
2690.16s: for at least 10 days and they've stayed within a 15% range. And then I want to see something that's
2699.12s: at least 5% greater than a bar ago. Let's see what we get. This is my bad. I have to fix this because
2707.92s: I want it to be weekly. So it's a smaller population than it's scanning. There's only 12 there.
2712.32s: Anyways, Nike. I don't actually love that. We clear that. Let's see what these 12 were.
2730.00s: Here. This is a good example. I don't know this from a hole in the wall. I'm just giving you an
2736.24s: example. But this is a good example that if I look at this and I say, okay, well, it's been consolidating.
2741.60s: It's been staying within a 15% range. It's now just starting to break out of this consolidation
2746.32s: period. It did have a lower low. Let's just say it was super bullish again. Again, just a hypothetical.
2753.04s: Well, do I favor buying or selling here? Well, it entirely premium, by the way, when I say buying
2759.44s: or selling in this context, it depends entirely on what my thesis is for the move. If I look at
2767.20s: this and I'm like, yeah, okay, based on my research and what I think is possible, maybe using prior
2772.80s: reference moves like here, it consolidated for a while, started marching up and out. Maybe I'll give
2778.00s: it another couple days because based on, again, my breath of experience learning technical analysis
2783.04s: and studying signals, then I'll take a look at, give it another day. See if it continues the rally.
2788.16s: And if it does, then I favor a breakout move to the upside, potentially. Okay. Well, if I do that,
2796.08s: then I would not want to sell puts. I would rather buy calls of some sort.
2802.32s: Then I have to go through the rest of my trade process to see that it lines up. But this goes back
2807.76s: to this. I cannot overemphasize this point enough. I think between these first two, this is probably
2815.84s: the downfall of the overwhelming majority of traders. I genuinely, we feel comfortable saying
2821.28s: that you guys know, hopefully, that I don't like giving bad statistics. I don't like saying numbers
2826.48s: that aren't based on something. So this is, I'm postulating here. But I would feel pretty confident
2833.84s: in that as a measure. I think that's probably pretty damn close, as my guess.
2838.72s: So I'm going to take a pause on the first two, most option, most common option trader mistakes.
2846.80s: Anything jump out at you here? Because there's something that jumps out at me compared to your
2851.76s: answers from the beginning of the session. It shows me at the beginning of the session,
2858.40s: most of you are here looking at individual strategy level decisions.
2867.20s: We're talking about the ways that we manage individual trades.
2871.04s: But from my perspective, I think this accounts for the vast majority of options traders that don't
2885.20s: succeed. Because again, what I can tell you is that if you are good at finding specific profit
2892.64s: mechanisms and you're good at measuring, creating signals, understanding the characteristics,
2898.80s: your probability for failure becomes minute. As long as you maintain good overall trade hygiene,
2906.16s: things like managing risk, as you guys point out, that's massive. You have to manage risk.
2910.16s: Half to manage risk. But you can manage risk perfectly and still fail.
2916.96s: If we can't find things that are doing what we think it may or may not do,
2922.40s: and then building stuff around it.
2926.96s: First two steps. So your action steps here work in progress, but where we're at so far.
2937.20s: First one is for the next, I realize that's right behind my head, sorry. First one here is for the next
2944.88s: three months. You should create a monthly and weekly learning roadmap.
2963.52s: That's your first action item. Now, I would highly encourage you, you don't have to do this,
2980.48s: but I would highly encourage you to pop into the Discord and share.
2990.96s: Share what you think you're going to focus on. We literally have a beginner's,
2996.80s: we have an entire beginner's channel and it's free for everybody that's in the free area.
3004.64s: It's everybody can access it. It's completely free. You can join.
3011.36s: And then you can figure out if what you're focusing on makes sense. But guess what?
3015.28s: Even if you don't want to join the Discord and do that, I'm completely agnostic.
3019.12s: I honestly don't carry their way. You can go to my website because I literally built it for you.
3024.24s: I literally give you a starting point.
3028.64s: But the point is to start getting detailed.
3032.56s: Reece says not to sound defensive, but you ask an options question to the answer did involve
3038.16s: options. No argument at all though. Yeah, that's the point though, right?
3042.08s: is the whole point of asking it in the context of option traders is because option traders forget
3050.00s: this shit because they're not thinking about it. That's exactly the purpose of that question
3056.72s: is because option traders become too focused on options and they put the cart so far in front
3065.20s: of the horse that you can't even see the fucking cart. So yeah, completely agree with you.
3070.96s: That Lauren says, what exactly do you mean by learning road map? You tell me, what do you think
3074.96s: that that means? It's a great question, by the way. But I'm very curious what that means to you.
3079.68s: And if anybody else has any ideas on what they think a learning road map might be,
3083.84s: would feel free to chime in. I'm going to try my super cool back pillow thing.
3093.04s: So far, the back's been pretty good, but I wonder how this... Oh, Jesus. No.
3099.28s: That's like way too much. I don't like that. We're not there yet.
3106.80s: I'd rather be skiing says a structured process to real and intended goal with the success
3112.40s: to reach an intended goal with success potentially. The steps you take to learn a complex system.
3117.84s: So Cedric is on it. So this is a road map. And then again, you can get this on the website.
3126.88s: And then what I do actually is at the bottom, you can take a look at a more in-depth syllabus.
3135.84s: So what I do is I give you a starting point. Again, this is not the whole answer in my opinion.
3140.48s: This is literally a starting point. And the reason why I give this as a starting area is because I do
3146.08s: think you need to take the time and figure out what holes you need to plug, right? Because maybe
3152.72s: you already understand compound interest. Okay, cool. Then you don't really have to spend a lot of
3156.48s: time on that. But my guess is if you for the next three months decided, okay, month one,
3163.92s: I'm going to start with module one. And again, I'm just using this as a framework. You can make
3168.00s: your own. I'm not saying that this is the best solution out there. Comprehensive solution. This
3172.08s: is a starting point. You could say, okay, my first goal for this month. And maybe I go faster.
3179.20s: Maybe I can get through two modules in a month. It's up to you. You can set whatever you want.
3183.44s: But my recommendation is to set structure and hold yourself to the structure.
3188.40s: So you should be able to look at something like this and have solutions for all of them mentally.
3195.76s: Whether or not you want to take notes in a trading plan, entirely up to you, I do, but totally up to you.
3201.52s: But like, for example, setting financial goals, I guarantee you, if I walked all of you through
3208.40s: what I do, the people that are in the mentoring program on the Patreon, I guarantee you,
3215.28s: if I walked all of you through that, you would have completely, completely insufficient financial
3221.84s: goals, completely insufficient. And that's not to dig it anybody. But it's just because it's
3228.08s: something that we don't think about. We just kind of start moving and we forget that we have to
3236.00s: think about this. And some people, they're financial, they think they have financial goals.
3240.64s: But then you ask them, what are the financial goals? Oh, I want to be financially free by the time
3245.20s: I'm 40. Okay, cool. What does that mean? I don't really know. It's just to have enough. Okay,
3252.00s: cool. What's enough? How much is enough? Well, I don't need that much. Okay. Well, that's what you're
3257.92s: saying right now. What if you have a kid? What if you have another kid? What if you decide by the
3263.68s: time you're 40, you want to enjoy life a little bit more and you don't want to eat ramen every day
3268.72s: instead of that? Right. So the point is we as traders want to get so far ahead of ourselves down
3276.56s: to this shit that we completely forsake completing the basics of setting up an absolute rock solid
3286.00s: foundation for what we were trying to do. So again, that's my guess is that if we went through this
3295.60s: in depth, this idea of setting financial goals, my guess is just about every single person in here
3301.60s: would have underdeveloped financial goals. And that's not a dig. Hopefully, it's a shot across the
3307.68s: bow that it's something you probably need to think about probably because again, I've done a bunch
3313.36s: of these mentoring sessions at this point and it is universal across everybody.
3320.48s: So if that's the case, it's probably generally applicable to a much larger sample.
3328.24s: Same thing here, risk profiles and tolerance. Let's do a hypothetical for the chat.
3337.76s: What's your risk tolerance? Just whatever that means to you, what is your risk tolerance?
3350.88s: And I guarantee you for those that answer, there's going to be a common theme. I already know there's
3355.52s: going to be a common theme. Vladimir says, hi. Tommy says 1% draw down. Sam Clements says extreme.
3367.60s: Roy Titty says not good enough.
3370.80s: Cedric says, if I know the value of a company, Elon Song says medium,
3374.56s: Reese says depends on conviction.
3380.32s: So what do you guys notice about essentially all of these answers?
3386.32s: Paul says 1% draw down.
3392.48s: I'd rather be seeing says a percentage of the portfolio based on risk reward of a trade.
3397.28s: Cedric is on it. These aren't numbers. If we're talking about risk tolerance,
3404.16s: whether we think about risk tolerance as a function of total portfolio risk, what you put on
3410.08s: an individual trade again, it's an open ended question by design. But there were two people
3416.24s: that even loosely defined it. And the other thing I can tell you is that for the people that say
3420.64s: 1% draw down a portfolio, that's essentially impossible to trade. Like if you think about
3427.04s: a 1% draw down on the portfolio, that's almost impossible to achieve even in the best
3433.60s: returning assets. So for the people that quantify it,
3440.24s: that's still it's insufficient because if we rationally think about 1% of the portfolio risk,
3449.44s: we would be overutilized as soon as we do anything.
3453.52s: So when I think about something like risk tolerance, this is again,
3461.44s: why setting financial goals is so important and why having this in order is essential.
3470.88s: Because how are we going to go down here and worry about options if we don't even reconcile
3478.80s: with ourselves the way we think about risk and what we're okay with.
3484.88s: How does that make sense? It doesn't. And the reason why it doesn't is because most traders skip
3492.16s: this entire process of building structure, building a solid foundation. Again, the leading mistake
3501.76s: I see options traders make. And again, I don't say this from a whole year than vow perspective.
3506.96s: I did this exact fucking thing. We all do it. I didn't do this in the beginning. I didn't think
3515.76s: to do this. I didn't know to do this. But now looking back at it, I realized that as I was trading
3523.92s: things, when I had the largest percent draw down on my portfolio, I can guarantee you it's because
3530.00s: this I did not strongly consider my risk tolerance and actually think through how I would feel
3536.88s: in different risk on scenarios. So this is again, a generalized starting point that I think new
3549.52s: options traders can leverage for themselves. This is not comprehensive, but I think this is a good
3555.12s: starting point. Then we look at we have our roadmap, we know what we're doing now, we know what we're
3564.32s: focusing on. So now what's our next action item? I gave you your first action item. The first
3571.76s: action item is for the next three months, define what you're going to learn or focus on monthly
3580.24s: and weekly. Again, I gave you a starting point. I literally gave you an example. You don't even
3584.48s: have to make your own. You can make your own. I encourage you to, but I'm giving you something that
3589.36s: you can start with. So then the next part of this is for every, every single thing you think
3604.08s: you're going to trade. You start here. We need to create a trading plan in a trading log
3618.88s: and in that trading plan, we're going to start by listing all profit mechanisms you can think of.
3636.16s: And again, this is all free game, right? Like this is what I do with the people in the mentoring
3640.64s: program. And the reason is because most people, if I ask them, talk about a profit mechanism,
3650.08s: it's such a broad question that a newer trader doesn't even know how to define that for themselves.
3656.16s: So I'll help you. What are some basic profit mechanisms you can think of? You guys start, you
3662.72s: guys tell me first, and then I'll give you some ideas. I'd rather be skiing says, what do you mean by
3669.36s: profit mechanism? It's a great question. What do you guys think?
3684.40s: So for a rather be skiing, that video is for you.
3690.16s: And let's see. Reese says shares. Joey says stock goes up. VRPP. Okay.
3698.48s: Sedric says I look at undervalued company with the turning story and use options as leverage. Okay.
3705.52s: Apollo says directional selling premium volatility. Vladimir off boot and says price movement.
3712.88s: I'd rather be skiing says buy low sell high. Reese says long call short puts.
3719.68s: Cedar says they did K.
3723.52s: So what does this say here?
3731.52s: Might be hard to see. So I'll read it out loud.
3736.56s: What is the specific mechanism that makes money? What is the specific mechanism that makes money?
3749.52s: So for example, Roaring Titty says look for news catalyst. To me, that's a signal.
3771.84s: Something that's providing some sort of news catalyst is a signal. So Roaring Titty expand
3778.40s: on what happens. So let's say Roaring Titty that there's news that comes out
3785.92s: and it provides a catalyst. Then what happens?
3791.44s: The very important step in this process.
3802.32s: Brad is on it, but I'm waiting specifically for Roaring Titty.
3808.24s: I'm going to check out the chart for volume. Nope.
3812.56s: This is exactly why I want to work through this example. I want to make sure that this is
3816.72s: crystal clear. So Roaring Titty, we have news comes out that provides a catalyst.
3825.44s: Then you check the chart for volume or whatever and you see volume expanding.
3830.40s: So far, does any of that happening equal you've made money?
3837.84s: I think we're going to do boneless wings tonight. Come on. I'm feeling some buffalo wild wings.
3845.68s: Cedric says nope. Cedric would be correct.
3850.88s: I'd rather be skeens is not really. That's also correct.
3854.08s: Okay. And Roaring Titty confirms. No. Okay. Great. That's perfect.
3860.96s: So now Roaring Titty says, but you have to think through your trade before you do it, of course.
3867.68s: Absolutely. Absolutely. What again, stay with me here.
3874.00s: We're talking about profit mechanisms and defining profit mechanisms.
3879.44s: So what I'm getting you to do is called a root cause analysis. So Roaring Titty,
3887.36s: keep following me here. You said news catalyst that then leads to volume both completely fine.
3895.60s: But we both agree that that doesn't actually equal profit yet. So then keep going.
3902.08s: Walk me through what gets us to profit. And in the meantime, cheers. I got to take some
3907.36s: aside of benefit.
3918.08s: So Roaring Titty scenario, we have news, we have a catalyst, we have volume that's expanding.
3924.88s: We have faith in the Titty. Let's take a look at this. Let's take a look at Nike.
3943.20s: So Nike had a new CEO. That's news. Right. That's a catalyst.
3952.56s: And then Roaring Titty to your point, we see volume going up. So there's your volume.
3960.24s: The news itself doesn't make you money. Volume expanding doesn't make you money.
3966.80s: So then what happened here that would actually make you money?
3974.80s: It has something to do with the chart itself.
3981.92s: And think about it. If you put in a dollar and the news breaks,
3991.04s: does your dollar change? Doesn't. Roaring Titty says support and resistance close.
3997.36s: That's moving in the correct direction. The thing that makes you money
4002.40s: is the stock moving. So let's use an alternate scenario. Let's say Nike announces a CEO.
4014.16s: Let's say stock volume goes up, but it's highly constrained. Buyers and sellers are on top of
4020.96s: one another. You have news, you have a catalyst, you have expanded volume, you might not actually make
4027.92s: any money. Or you could have news, you could have catalyst, you could have an expansion volume,
4033.36s: and it could go down. You could lose money. So what I'm trying to do
4043.52s: is get all of you to think about the specific mechanism that leads to making money. And we'll go
4052.48s: into a couple examples.
4058.56s: So let's just go into a couple examples.
4063.60s: Mel just got home, so I had to make sure I let Thor run out and go run over to her.
4070.08s: So first, let me take a pause there. Roaring Titty does what I say makes sense. My guess is
4077.12s: you're inherently thinking of that. Like I don't think I'm saying anything that's necessarily
4081.76s: revolutionary, but hopefully the point that I'm driving home is the requirement to break things
4088.80s: out and down into these requisite pieces. That's my goal. I'm hopeful that that's the point
4095.92s: that you will take away. So when we think about a profit mechanism, it is how something functionally
4107.28s: makes you money. So let's think about a few of them. We just covered one of them.
4114.08s: So we have something that can have, let's do profit mechanism.
4123.28s: First one, easy, price direction up.
4129.28s: Another one, price down.
4138.16s: Another one, volatility.
4144.48s: Up, down.
4148.96s: BRP or relative.
4159.36s: Roaring Titty says if something is trading sideways, you can make money selling options. You can.
4163.92s: And the way that you do that is either through volatility or you can absolutely classify that
4169.76s: if you would like. You can absolutely do. I'm value.
4175.12s: Now your time value stuff will almost always have a volatility component, but you can absolutely
4180.00s: break out something like theta decay.
4183.12s: Cedric says yields. That's exactly correct. That's another very good one.
4186.80s: This can be dividends for anything.
4195.84s: Stocks, ETFs, bonds, they have yields.
4200.08s: So all of these are absolutely profit mechanisms.
4205.28s: Now, Cedric says merger. Merger itself is not a profit mechanism.
4211.92s: Right? Because again, and this is why this point is so important.
4216.08s: Is because mentally we conflate things.
4220.56s: A merger can happen that doesn't do anything. The stock cannot move.
4229.04s: That's not the actual mechanism. That's a signal.
4236.24s: Same thing with roaring Titty. So if we think about
4241.52s: signals, so literally just get rid of this and think of it this way. Profit,
4250.40s: mechanism, signal.
4257.28s: What you all are on to now,
4263.20s: Captain Chris says, I'm in public and everyone keeps here and you say Titty.
4266.72s: Yeah, man. Well, we have the Titty in here. So I'm a say her name, loud and proud,
4273.12s: so that everybody there around you knows that we have roaring Titty in the house.
4279.52s: It's actually, essentially, it's vital for our operation here to acknowledge Titty.
4289.04s: And I think everybody here has a strong affinity for Titty as we should.
4296.80s: So now, let's think about what, funny enough, Titty. Let's think about what Titty said, share by back.
4310.08s: So what happens in a share by back? Typically. And as Al Poutin says, not all buybacks are created
4317.60s: equal as chewy holders, which yeah, that's something in it. But it's fair. So anyways,
4328.24s: let's talk about a share by back. Usually move price up. I'd rather be skiing is on this like
4334.48s: white on rice now. So we see price move. That's what that means. So this is
4347.44s: the process you have to follow. And again, I can tell that not everybody has it down still
4353.12s: because like Cedric here, and there's not to pick on Cedric, we're all learning. But here's
4356.96s: Cedric says it's a change in demand. It is a change in demand. But again, a change in demand
4362.40s: is not a profit mechanism. A change in demand is simply a change in demand.
4368.72s: Demand can go up. Demand can go down. And if we don't see anything, then price doesn't
4377.76s: inherently have to move. Same thing with like a merger arbitrage. Price isn't dictated to move
4383.04s: in a merger arbitrage. So the way I want you to think about profit mechanisms is hyper specific.
4393.76s: I want you to think about what a trade does that actually makes you money. So let's take a look
4404.16s: at some examples. And see if we can dial this in. Let's say perfect. Let's say Nike's here.
4422.80s: Okay. And let's say for a change of pace, I, Eric, for once, actually time the market successfully.
4442.08s: I enjoy these hypotheticals. It's a chance that we can play fairy tale. So I can be whatever I want to
4448.72s: be. And in this fairy tale, I want to pretend that I actually traded something with good timing.
4459.28s: Really nice. So in this alternate universe that in no way mirrors reality, I chose to sell a put
4473.44s: here on September 11th. So to put, then Nike goes on. So we fast forward one, two, three, four,
4484.48s: five, six, seven trading days, seven trading days forward.
4495.84s: What's my profit mechanism here? Now I don't want to be mean. So I'm already going to give you a hint.
4502.88s: There's more than one. There's a primary and a secondary. I never give hints like this,
4510.80s: but I really want the point to hit home. So I'm being a little too soft.
4515.28s: Cedric says stock going up, I've changed. Land says good timing. Rowan Clity says stock up,
4532.16s: theta decay. Tommy says time decay. Underlying price moves away from the short strike.
4540.08s: Joey is exactly correct. Joey has the most comprehensive answer.
4545.60s: Joey says main is underlying movement. That's absolutely correct. So the primary profit factor here
4551.76s: is going to be delta, the movement of the underlying completely correct. So the first profit mechanism
4558.40s: is price movement up. The second profit mechanism is long theta and time is passed.
4568.64s: The third profit mechanism, whether or not it happened, I'm not sure we could take a look,
4574.96s: is if volatility changed. And in this case, volatility would have gone against us. So that
4584.32s: wouldn't be a profit mechanism. And it doesn't surprise me. Let's use this as a great foundation for
4589.44s: a hypothetical, not even a hypothetical practical question. Why is volatility expanding here?
4594.48s: The stock price is going up. Normally, volatility contracts when stock price is going up.
4599.28s: Look carefully at the chart because your answer is there. Why, oh, why is volatility?
4609.12s: Brad says because the gap up with news, nope, that's not it. It's good news. So
4617.52s: Joey says it went up more than expected, more volume. Nope, not at either. Can you guys,
4621.76s: let me see if you can see it on the screen. Yeah, you guys can see it. I was concerned that it
4628.56s: might have been hidden, but it's not. Roin clitty says big move up and maybe also a larger range
4633.84s: during the day. Nope, not at either. Re says sudden move. Nope, not at either.
4641.44s: I'd rather be skiing says volatility increased with price movement. Nope. Roin titty says
4646.24s: valiant profile. Nope. Ah, roaring clitty.
4654.08s: Roin clitty gets a round of applause.
4660.32s: So I need to find my little trophy for roaring clitty.
4668.64s: Fuck, we're into you can get one, two anyways, because why not?
4676.40s: But it was meant for roaring clitty. You get plus fake plus one fake internet point.
4685.28s: Roin clitty says we're a team. It's chill. Yes, perfect. I guess you it's yeah, you guys can share
4689.76s: them too. This is the art of trading. It's learning how to decipher all kinds of market
4699.92s: information. Now for a new trader, you probably wouldn't know that and that's okay. You're not
4704.32s: supposed to know all of it upfront. You're not going to. But that's exactly why volatility was
4710.16s: increasing is because we're getting closer to earnings. And again, as you surround yourself in
4715.84s: options more, you will learn more things. And this is one of those things that we typically will see
4722.88s: volatility, implied volatility expand leading into earnings starting about two weeks out.
4730.40s: It's common behavior. I know it's going to happen more often than not.
4734.96s: So, in fact, let's talk about profit mechanisms. Is there something there?
4744.64s: Any ideas? What profit mechanism exists based on that phenomenon I just told you
4751.44s: that I know implied volatility tends to expand about two weeks out leading into earnings.
4757.92s: Long vote. Bingo. Reese is cracked. 100% cracked. So the way that we think about
4770.00s: profit mechanisms is the specific thing, these specific thing that leads to making money.
4780.00s: Now, what's the signal? Well, the signal in this case is knowing that earnings is coming up
4789.60s: in a few weeks and volatility tends to expand into earnings. That's my signal.
4796.00s: The profit mechanism itself is the movement of implied volatility.
4801.84s: Roryntady says long, long, long volume. Nope, it's long. In this context, it's volatility. Most of
4807.28s: the time when you hear people say, vol, it refers to volatility. But sometimes it can mean volume,
4813.20s: but that's less frequent. Normally, you'll see context dependent, but normally, you'll see it as
4818.00s: volatility. Roryntady says, if you take earnings out of the equation completely, would the gap up
4824.40s: not increase vol? Not necessarily no. Yeah, it doesn't mean that it would or wouldn't. We can't
4831.20s: really tell because there's other things at play. So, prime time example, it gapped up here, right?
4835.60s: But I can tell you that 30-day vol went from 27, 7, 9, 6, 3 to after the gap, it went to 27, 6, 4.
4846.56s: So, 30-day vol contracted. And then if I take a look at 7-day vol, it went from 25 to 23.
4855.20s: So, this is an example of a gap up and vol went down. That's why it's not a discrete answer,
4861.76s: right? And that's why I can tell you definitively that the behavior largely is going to be
4867.76s: attributable to earnings. Does that mean that the gap up didn't have an effect or the news didn't
4871.84s: have an effect? It absolutely could have. I can't decouple those entirely. But here's the other
4877.84s: thing I can show you is that leading into this gap up, do you notice the slope of volatility?
4885.04s: Again, it's these yellow lines. It's positive sloping. So, even before this news broke about Nike
4895.12s: CEO being replaced, it already, even as it was going up, volatility was expanding. And again,
4901.68s: from a practitioner standpoint, from experience, I know more often than not, if the underlying is
4910.56s: going up, volatility tends to contract. It doesn't always, right? That's not an absolute,
4918.16s: but it tends to contract. So, here, I see something that's going up, and I see volatility going up.
4927.36s: That tells me something's up. Don't always know what right out of the gate, but something's going on.
4933.44s: And in this case, I can clearly see a few things, but a big one of them is this earnings on the horizon.
4940.96s: Cedric says, I'm confused. What is difference between IV and volatility? There's no difference.
4949.92s: They're different things related to the same thing. This video is for you.
4962.56s: So, Cedric, that video is all about volatility. So, it's going to talk about
4969.36s: all different kinds of volatility, implied historic forecast, realized, future realized,
4976.96s: it'll break down, vol entirely. So, that's the video. I just shared there.
4986.56s: Cedric says, so it's a profit mechanism, right? Is what a profit mechanism be specific?
4993.92s: IV. Is it? Again, be specific. What IV?
5011.60s: Changes in IV. Cedric coming in for the all youp, or the assessed, correct.
5018.40s: Changes in implied volatility certainly would be a profit mechanism.
5023.52s: So, you'll notice here, in the profit mechanisms, I literally already had those written out for you,
5030.48s: right? Volatility up down, relative volatility plays. This is not a comprehensive list.
5035.84s: There's tons of things, relationships, correlations, tons of things. Now, the last thing, though,
5041.92s: that I want to highlight on this idea of profit mechanisms and their corresponding assessment
5049.20s: is that do you think all price up profit mechanisms are built the same?
5058.16s: And we actually already did a preamble to this a little bit earlier. So, you will actually
5064.32s: already know the answer. Riz says no, Cedric says no, I'd rather be skiing says no, exactly.
5069.68s: You guys are all spot on, correct. So, then what does that mean?
5074.40s: If all price up profit mechanisms are not built the same,
5085.20s: what is that then tell me?
5092.80s: Cedric says depending on the risk you take, not, that's not wrong, but that's not what I'm
5097.04s: leaning towards. It tells me very something very important about this step here, this next step.
5111.20s: Riz says we have to tailor the one that fits best with the thesis, maybe.
5116.48s: Zoom up one level. I think you all are down one level below where I want you to be.
5121.52s: Joey says to choose your own adventure, that's not wrong.
5124.56s: Roryntitty, Cedric is on the right path. How clear this signal is, that's not correct,
5128.64s: but it's the right path. Roryntitty says depending on trading goal on what you pick,
5132.72s: that's correct for sure, but zoom up one level for you as well.
5138.16s: So, if not all profit mechanism price up in this example are built the same,
5145.52s: what does that tell me about the signal? Riz says IDK what zoom up a level means. It means
5155.28s: take your thought level from where you're at to a higher level thought. So kind of like a broader
5161.76s: thought is the way to think about it. Depending on how the movement moves, now we're getting much
5166.48s: closer, we're getting much, much closer. Lance is leading us in the correct. There we go. Joey is on
5172.56s: it. Joey is on it, spot on. Joey says how to differentiate between different samples.
5180.96s: That's exactly it. So, what this means is, if I'm thinking about price going up,
5190.16s: what's one quality I can think of? I can think of something like positive drift.
5202.88s: I can think of things like momentum. I can think of things like breakouts.
5215.12s: I can sub-categorize some of these into things like peed.
5222.40s: Tommy, perfect. I can think of things like trend.
5225.60s: I personally would classify those in momentum, but I think that that's completely fine.
5239.36s: Roryn clities the short squeeze. Absolutely. That's literally a fantastic one.
5244.16s: So, did you see my point here? So, what I just gave you is homework. This is the next action step,
5261.68s: or you, as a beginner, advanced, wherever level you're at, doesn't matter. You still have to do this.
5271.04s: So, we need to open up a Word doc, started trading plan. We need to open up an Excel sheet.
5278.88s: And we need to create a trade log. And we need to start outlining all of these different
5285.44s: profit mechanisms. And we need to start thinking about the sub-categories of them,
5293.44s: so that we can assess signals. So, here, the way that I'm going to look for positive drift
5303.04s: is different than the way I'm going to look for momentum, which is different than the way I'm
5307.52s: going to look for breakouts, which is different than the way I'm going to look for post earnings
5312.48s: announcement drift. These are different signals, or characteristics, that qualify
5322.88s: this mechanism. So, then I need to tie signals to all of these different variations of the profit
5330.48s: mechanism. This is a specific profit mechanism. Price direction up with positive drift.
5339.12s: Price direction up via momentum. Price direction up via breakout to the upside.
5346.00s: This is a defined profit mechanism. It's very specific.
5355.60s: Because now, I can say, okay, I'm trying to look for things that are going up,
5361.52s: and I'm going to look between things that are exhibiting momentum or breakouts. How do I find
5367.04s: things that move like this? That's where we start playing with signals.
5373.20s: Maybe it's something that crosses above of 50-day moving average. Maybe it's something that's
5378.72s: been consolidating for the past 10 days, but then it starts to break above the high of the consolidation
5384.40s: period. Lots of different ways to go about it, and this, again, is trading. Guess what?
5394.48s: We still haven't even talked about options. We've been going for what? 90 minutes,
5402.40s: and in the three most common option trader mistakes, I haven't even touched options yet.
5413.28s: Because you have to put first things first. Doesn't matter if you're an option trader, a trader,
5418.80s: swing trader, day trader, value trader, whatever you are, this all has to happen.
5424.56s: And then depending on how comprehensive of a trader you want to be,
5429.68s: then it might be more or less. That's all there is to it.
5437.04s: Stedrick says, I used to just look at value. This is so complex. Yeah. I mean, that's the beauty
5442.00s: of trading. Because again, while somebody like you might be a value investor, while the market's
5446.16s: going down, I'm making money. That's the difference. That's why there's so much work that goes into
5454.08s: this is that the whole point of doing this kind of thing is so that you can build an approach that
5462.64s: meets your objectives. I've had two negative years. My entire trading career, the worst year was
5469.92s: down 4% in change. It was my second year trading. That was my worst down year. I don't have some sort of
5478.16s: crazy impressive positive return. I have a good return. But I've built a system that moves me
5486.16s: in the exact precise direction that I'm trying to go. So to Stedrick's point, if Stedrick enjoys
5494.64s: doing something like value investing or whatever the approach is, it's totally cool. And if that
5501.20s: works well for them, that's totally cool. It's like a very Warren Buffett-esque style. But again,
5506.64s: if I purposely compare my returns to the S&P 500 and then I have in my tracker Warren Buffett's
5513.20s: returns as well, specifically Berkshire. We bucket it up to Warren Buffett, but it's not just him.
5520.88s: But the point though is that I definitely out return Warren Buffett, and that's not better
5527.84s: trader than him by any sense. He has scale that he's dealing with and yada, yada, yada. But I do have
5534.16s: a better return than him. And I also have a better return variance than him.
5539.36s: So the whole point here is to develop something that works for you long term.
5547.12s: Roryntady says, this hurts my brain. I know. It's a lot. So then, oh, that'll probably hurt your
5551.92s: brain by zooming it in. So then let's let's simplify it a little bit. We can start very, very simply.
5563.04s: And then maybe this will make it a little more palatable.
5572.00s: So I'm going to group these so that I don't completely lose them.
5578.32s: Let's take a look at a hypothetical. So let's say, because Roryntady is brave and she said,
5588.24s: this hurts my brain, which is completely fair. It's a lot of shit. So let's start from a very
5596.80s: simple approach then, lack of structure. I'm a new trader. The first thing I'm going to focus on
5604.16s: is the fundamentals of the markets. So for the first month of my learning experience,
5611.44s: I'm going to focus on these. That's the first month. That's what I'm going to focus on.
5619.20s: So talking about the outlier big four, don't even worry about it. It doesn't matter yet. I'm going
5625.68s: to focus on just this. Then after the first month, or in conjunction with the first month,
5632.80s: depending on your pace, I'm going to focus on this. Don't care about the outlier big four.
5638.72s: Doesn't matter. I'm going to learn about the markets for the next month.
5643.44s: Now I'm going to start getting my house in order. And when I say my house, it's the proverbial
5650.40s: traders house. In having some organization to make sure I can track notes, tracks some ideas,
5660.08s: that's the next thing I focus on.
5661.92s: Then from here, I personally would gloss over these. Common trader, shortfalls,
5671.60s: trader behavior, decision making. I would just gloss over these. Know that they exist.
5677.68s: Again, you can pop on my website. It'll show you trader decision making, cognitive biases.
5683.76s: You literally can just run through and say, okay, I at least know that these things exist.
5688.24s: That's it. So these two here can take you moments not long.
5695.04s: Then we start getting into the actual components of trading. So now is when we add the next layer.
5703.76s: So essentially, the first two, three months, doesn't even worry about this.
5708.72s: Once we have a fundamental understanding of the markets, is when we get into this.
5713.28s: And I would start very simple. I know broadly, that price,
5722.16s: gifs up. I know that. Okay, cool. What else can I see in a chart? What else can I notice about
5735.60s: the market as I just poke through it broadly? Well, another thing I notice.
5743.36s: Is there's kind of clear relationships between different things. Don't know what they are in
5749.28s: the beginning, but I know that there's these different kinds of relationships. And I also know
5755.84s: that there are lots of different kinds of securities that will be based on my earlier lessons
5761.44s: on the market writ large is when you'll learn that. I'll kind of poke through here and I'll say,
5766.00s: okay, well, there's different sectors. The markets set up in these different ways. But I noticed
5770.72s: that price tends to go up. Price tends to go down. Price tends to go up. Price tends to go down.
5776.56s: It tends to go up. So price moves. Okay. What are the some of the things that I can eyeball
5784.80s: about these movements that might be interesting to me? I don't know yet. But I'm going to just
5789.84s: take some ideas. So the first idea is again, I know price drifts up. This is literally called
5797.20s: positive drift. And it's inequity premium. Then I just start looking at things and see what I
5816.40s: can come up with. So the other thing I just identified with you as I can see price goes up and down.
5828.16s: And from a trading perspective, I know that price will do the opposite of whatever I do at a
5834.08s: given point in time and make me wrong. I also know that one. So price goes up and down. So literally
5842.08s: what I'm doing right now is I'm starting this process right here. That's it. That's literally
5848.96s: the first steps as a trader, roaring titty. This is it. So all of that other stuff I'm showing you
5859.60s: gives you way more context on things to look at focus on so on and so forth. But this is where it
5864.72s: starts. Then we get to learn about options. So the next step after having a general understanding
5874.08s: of profit mechanisms, there's subsequent signals. Then we get to start playing with structures.
5881.28s: And we get to learn about options. This is where we learn about options. This is where we learn options
5889.52s: 101. This is where we learn options 201. Down here. All of this starts now in this.
5900.16s: We're in titty says, but I've already began trading options. Can I ring the bell? You can't,
5907.28s: but you can stop at any point. And then you can start where you should. And that's one of the
5912.88s: that we all all of us traders have these exact trading scars. Because most of us do just start.
5922.72s: It's about as is common as it is. It's it's what I did. It's what we all do. But you can
5930.16s: absolutely pivot and just start doing the right thing starting tomorrow. Exactly what I would do.
5940.40s: So this is the next part of this process. Once you get down to outline fitting structures,
5946.56s: you don't know what structures are. So now we have to learn options. This is where we learn options.
5952.64s: Then we build strategies optimization. That's all future state stuff. That's not stuff that
5958.16s: beginners have to worry about too much. This is where we learn options. So now you might be asking,
5966.64s: well, Eric, what's the third thing? We've gone through two things so far. What's the third thing?
5973.76s: Any guesses what the third thing is?
5980.48s: The third most common option trader mistake.
5988.72s: We got to swap out our spin drift. The more we got plenty of mango orange.
5995.60s: Reese says no more guesses. Joey says ill fitting structure.
6004.64s: Tommy says sounds like to be successful. The whole process has to be completed. I honestly wouldn't
6010.56s: say that personally. Tommy just because there are freaks. Like there are people that cannot do
6015.20s: any of this and do well. The way I look at it and I purposely would call that out because I
6020.96s: would never want somebody to think that what I do is the only way. But what I can tell you is
6028.08s: for somebody that's not super intelligent, going through this kind of process is really important.
6035.20s: And the other thing I would feel very confident in generalizing is that somebody who goes through
6040.88s: this kind of process is probably light years more likely to be successful than somebody who doesn't.
6052.00s: So I would feel really confident with that.
6058.88s: Tommy says not looking at downside risk management. That's fair.
6065.04s: I see saving. I think that that's good.
6070.96s: I don't see the answer yet.
6080.48s: So let's think about it.
6089.20s: Practicing is really good. Now if we think about where we would practice, probably
6095.52s: somewhere in here, hopefully, at least that's where I would practice, let's think about it.
6101.84s: Let's say that we have two traders. We have trader A and B. Sedrick says how are you going to
6107.68s: capture the profit mechanism? Ah, that's step three over here. We hit that entirely during the big
6113.84s: four trade process. That's the whole point of that.
6119.44s: Brad is the closest.
6121.20s: Think of a hypothetical. We have two traders. Both of these traders follow this process.
6134.00s: What will differentiate these two traders from one another? They follow the same exact process.
6140.24s: They do the same, they go through these same steps. What will differentiate them?
6145.20s: There we go.
6159.04s: I'd rather be skiing is spot on psychology. It's literally you, you as the trader, you as the
6168.24s: button clicker, you as the researcher, you as the risk manager, it is not taking the time
6177.84s: to understand you as a human being, your tendencies, your weaknesses. We don't like looking at those.
6187.36s: We don't like confronting our egos. All of us have one. Most of us spend very little time
6196.40s: analyzing ourselves or our actions. For example, in B honest, it's an anonymous pull.
6208.00s: But here's my question.
6227.12s: My question is too long.
6240.56s: I'll just add a word here.
6256.88s: And then I have to spell you with a you.
6261.68s: All right, there's your pull.
6266.16s: Do you have a comprehensive trading log right now that breaks down every single one of your
6275.92s: trades and your entire performance by strategy for the last 52 trading weeks?
6286.96s: I see 13 votes and I see 73% no.
6298.88s: I would even challenge the people that say yes. For the people that say yes, if you're
6307.20s: willing, email it to me. Email it to me now. I won't say who sends it to me. I'll just look at it.
6317.28s: Because my guess is it's probably not very comprehensive. That's my guess. I could be wrong.
6329.28s: And I hope I'm wrong. That would be fantastic. But that's my guess.
6335.04s: My guess is the 30% that have a trade log that analyzes their performance comprehensively
6342.80s: for the last 52 trading weeks. My guess is it's probably not quite comprehensive.
6355.44s: I'd rather be skiing says I'm sure you're right because we may have a different idea about
6359.04s: comprehensive potentially. We might have a different idea. But here's the way that I would reconcile
6366.88s: that is I would ask you basic questions and see if the trade log can answer those questions.
6374.08s: That it's not a matter of nuance of oh, you need to have return on invested capital here.
6381.52s: Maybe it's useful. Maybe it's not. It's not that kind of thing that I would question.
6386.64s: My response is or my sentiment is predicated on if I asked you something like
6395.20s: which of your strategies performs best in a bullish market. Something very simple like that.
6401.84s: Some people might be able to say might be able to say. My guess is if I look at the trade log,
6408.64s: what they say might not align with what's in the trade log. That's my first guess.
6413.84s: The second guess I would imagine is that if I actually asked more important questions
6420.88s: that we wouldn't be able to answer them. And again, it's not necessarily down by memory.
6427.20s: Like that's the whole point of having a trade logs. You don't have to remember. But could we reference
6431.60s: somewhere in your trade log by strategy for the last 52 weeks, the total number of trades that
6438.16s: went on, the number of winning trades average winner max winner lowest winner. Same thing for the
6444.96s: loss side average number of wins per week average number of losses per week. Could we like extract
6453.60s: data that could then inform our decision making meaningfully. My guess is even for the 27% that say
6462.08s: yes, they're probably missing a lot of really important details. Again, I hope not. I genuinely hope
6468.48s: but the reason why I mentioned this is because this goes into the faulty mindset.
6475.36s: Because again, for the 73% of people, the other thing I think about is if I asked that 73% grouping,
6486.88s: so if you answered no to this question, do you think a trade log would benefit you? Do you think having
6497.76s: a record of all of your trades and kind of corresponding important details? Do you think that that
6506.88s: would be beneficial? Yeah. So like everybody knows that this is good. Everybody knows that this
6514.56s: is good. Yet we don't do it. We we know it's good and we choose not to do it. For lots of
6527.28s: different reasons. I'd rather be skiing says it's the only way you can sometimes find what's
6532.56s: broken so you can address it or fix it. Yeah, exactly. But then again, going back to I'd rather be
6539.76s: skiing your earlier question of I've gotten lazy. So if you're telling me that you have this tool
6545.76s: that you know can fix what you're doing, then why would you get lazy about it? That doesn't make
6550.32s: sense. That doesn't jive. So what I'm highlighting here is this is a massive bucket
6563.20s: that we all gloss right over. We're worried about what new regulation is coming out or what
6571.04s: Senator is cheating based on their position and insider information. We're worried about
6576.96s: bitching about the market makers and what we think they may or may not be doing. We're worried
6582.08s: about a lot of shit. And what I find fascinating is as traders, we spend so very little time
6590.48s: worrying about the very one thing we can control ourselves. The only thing you can control
6600.64s: as a trader and we skip right over it. So here are in my opinion the three most common
6613.84s: option trader mistakes and action steps on how not to do it. I gave you the outline here
6625.12s: or lack of structure to create your own structure. I gave you the way to start thinking about
6632.64s: building profitable strategies that are centered on defined profit mechanisms and the ability
6642.16s: to measure signals that help us find those profit mechanisms. The third and final thing that I'm
6650.88s: showing you is that you have got to take time to start introspection. You have to look at yourself
6660.32s: and you have to understand your tendencies. An easy way to start this is again literally go
6668.08s: through my website and see what you think might align with you. We did this yesterday actually.
6675.28s: Somebody asked what they asked what I think my largest cognitive biases are and we ran through it.
6685.84s: So disposition effect. If you have a trade log, you can answer this. If you don't have a trade log,
6693.60s: you literally can look at your brokerage statement. It's not going to be as informative,
6697.84s: but I could still see it straight from a brokerage statement. No problem. That's one of the things
6701.36s: that I do again when I'm talking with people about this stuff because what you'll notice is that
6707.76s: I think I have one in here. Do I have one in here?
6717.44s: Whoa. I have a giant blind spot. Hold on.
6720.64s: Whoa. I'm literally about to have to edit this. So this is now going to become 24 trader decision-making
6736.16s: cognitive biases. As you look at this, actually, can you do you have an idea of what needs to be added
6743.60s: here? And I'll zoom this out so that you can see most of them. So we can get past the disposition
6752.40s: effect, high wind rates, can't go broke, taking profits, Goldilocks, SkillGap analysis.
6762.40s: This is interesting.
6768.88s: But there's a really important one that's missing.
6773.68s: Yours was 15, no. Mine was a bunch of them. So I think for me, the ones I identified were
6790.32s: anchoring hindsight, availability.
6798.48s: I think those are the main ones. A recent one. That was another one.
6811.68s: Don't drink and trade. Maybe that actually could be a solid strategy. Maybe somebody would crush it
6816.88s: with that as their approach. Nope, that's not it. It's a good guess, though.
6827.60s: But not quite correct.
6840.24s: I'm literally updating it so that you can see real time what it is.
6857.60s: So, and I think that this one is probably really, really common, actually.
6875.20s: Self accountability, I think that that's fair.
6888.00s: I see.
6897.76s: That says 12, 22, 23, 20, and 13. I mean, I imagine is probably most of these for most people.
6909.28s: Tommy says expert info by thinking your information sources are the best.
6913.76s: Yeah, I think lacking the ability to objectively evaluate a data source is really,
6919.36s: really important. Like really, really important.
6922.32s: So here is the updated version.
6946.96s: And I don't think anybody guessed it. And it's kind of a slightly different version of what
6956.88s: like the true definition is, but I think it applies here. So if I hit refresh, it should say 24
6961.04s: now. There it is. This one. So the one that I think is probably really, really common
6970.80s: is when a person fails to objectively evaluate something. And there's a cognitive gap between
6981.52s: their perception of reality and what reality actually is. So cognitive dissonance.
6988.24s: So the idea behind cognitive dissonance, and I guess I can get rid of bias if that doesn't need to
6992.56s: be there, is that we essentially fail to connect reality to what it is.
7000.32s: And it's really easy to do this. It's really easy to do this.
7006.72s: Off-Poon says this is much more rigid and organized than I care to be. Yeah, it's, I don't like
7011.60s: this either to be like it's work. Nobody wants this. But what I can tell you is that something like
7020.48s: this is a primary driver of why I've been successful as a trader. Hopefully we'll continue to be.
7027.44s: We never fully know, but I'd like to think that I'll be able to continue on the path. And it's
7034.16s: because of taking the time to look at all this stuff. But most people don't like to look at this
7039.44s: stuff because it's uncomfortable. It's a lot of work. It's not fun. But yeah, I totally feel you.
7046.56s: Cool. So that's the main part of the session.
7053.28s: Is you now have an understanding at least from my perspective, the three most common
7059.28s: option trader mistakes, you now know what they are, how to overcome them, and then you actually have
7067.84s: you have an approach now on how you can work on them. I'd rather be skiing says,
7074.08s: sent one log in journal. Yeah, I'll take a look. I'll literally look right now.
7083.60s: Reese says when you go through trades, it seems easy. Of course it is. Yeah, of course it is because
7090.88s: what happens, what happens with the trade? The trade is simply a culmination
7100.48s: of an idea. All of the work to be a successful trader is done light years, light years before you
7114.64s: ever click a button. And I say this openly and genuinely trading the actual process of trading
7123.92s: is fucking easy. It's mindless because at that point, all of the work is done. All you do
7135.36s: is apply everything else that's been done. But all of the work literally all of the work is done
7146.16s: before ever pressing a button. And this is exactly why good trading is effortless. Good trading
7159.04s: literally is effortless. But to get to that point is very difficult.
7165.84s: Okay, so for I'd rather be skiing. One of the first questions I have for you is what was your maximum
7179.52s: portfolio risk? So let's say on it looks like you're mostly looking at shares, which is totally cool.
7192.16s: And I see that you have total risk as a dollar amount. What's your total portfolio risk?
7200.88s: Like let's say all equity trades and I trade 2% of allocated capital per trade max. Yep. So
7212.00s: then so for example though, my point is is when I look at this, well one, it doesn't look like
7220.08s: you do that because you're holding equity. So you actually you can't risk 2% of capital max per
7230.16s: trade if you're holding equity. Why is that? Why do I say that? So if you tell me you risk 2%
7238.16s: max per trade and I'm telling you if you're holding equity, you're not doing that.
7244.48s: Why is that?
7248.40s: Cedric says no leverage. That's not it. And also a giant shout out to I'd rather be skiing for
7254.08s: being brave and sending this in. So first thing I'm going to do is look I'd rather be skiing up
7263.52s: with three fake internet points because he's the only person that took me up on that.
7269.44s: And that's not easy to do. They have somebody look at your stuff and give you feedback.
7273.68s: It's very vulnerable. So straight up straight up props to you. So now
7283.36s: but why why is that? Well let's take a look at an example. I'm going to save this and then I think
7290.48s: we can probably close this for now. Cedric says if you're trading equity it's harder to manage your
7299.92s: risk. No, not not harder necessarily. But there is a dynamic aspect to it. So I don't want to
7311.60s: I'd rather be skiing. I'm not going to dox your trades and stuff. I'm just going to pick an
7315.84s: example though of something here. I'd rather be skiing says I used position sizing is 2% loss
7325.68s: tradable capital so not 2% of all capital is much smaller than that. Yeah, that's okay too.
7330.08s: That's not so much my point though. My point is is why does that not matter because you're risking
7335.52s: more than that. So let's say you like Nike and you buy Nike here and you're going to risk 2% of
7345.44s: your capital on Nike. Right? So we're going to do 2% of our capital on Nike here. Well, what happened?
7364.88s: Something very specific happened here that does not care about what we defined as our risk.
7371.84s: You gap down. There's nothing to be done here. So you got in just proverbial again, I'm not doxing
7381.28s: and I don't even think this is on your list. I'm just picking a random ticker. But we're defining it
7386.32s: as 2%. But it gaped out. We have more than 2% risk on. If we use a stop, it doesn't matter
7399.36s: because this blows by your stop because it's a gap down. There's no controlling this.
7405.84s: So now again, let's play the proverbial. When I ask how much portfolio risk is on at a given point in time,
7415.92s: then we obviously can have what our perceived risk is and I think it's completely fair to use the stops.
7423.68s: Right? Royincliddy says, what if only 2% of your capital is in the stock? There you go. Literally the
7430.40s: exact point I'm driving towards is I think it's completely reasonable to use what you anticipate
7440.56s: getting stopped at because here's the other thing. Let's be realistic. We can't make trading rules
7447.44s: based on stuff like this. Right? Because this happens. So then how do we actually define the total
7455.20s: risk of a portfolio at a given point in time if we're trading something like an equity or an option
7460.40s: that you can't get out or even a future that there's periods of time that you technically can't get
7464.72s: out or don't have offsetting positions is by the size of the position. But then the total portfolio
7470.40s: risk is still different. So I measure a few different things, but one of them is absolutely I use
7479.04s: the most severe day overnight day drawdown and I just leave it in the sheet as a as a reference.
7485.76s: So like for example, what we can do is we can say, all right, let's say for the individual stocks
7492.88s: that I'm trading. Let's say I'm trading Nike. I'll go back and I'll say like what's the worst
7498.64s: overnight move that I've seen? And this is if I trade something a lot, I wouldn't necessarily
7503.28s: go through all this hassle if it's something that you know, like I just anticipate trading once. But
7508.24s: from an options trading perspective, you tend to do the same stuff over and over again, like in
7514.16s: the same name, excuse me, there's not that many. So I develop a footprint for all of them. So what
7518.80s: I'll do is I'll say, okay, over the last 10 years, what is the biggest overnight gap the stock had
7526.32s: that I'm trading? Now I at least have a reference. Again, it could be more than that that the worst
7532.88s: days typically are ahead of us. So maybe I can buffer a little bit add a little bit more,
7538.32s: but I at least have an idea of the total portfolio risk. And again, I personally wouldn't use that as
7543.52s: my planning factor, but I would absolutely want to know that in my trade log. Because again,
7550.32s: what is a terrible scenario is if we don't even think about that. And for whatever reason,
7555.84s: there's a giant global macro economic event that causes just widespread market panic. And then
7562.72s: we have 15 trades on that are sized on a presumed 2% max risk. But they all somehow again, highly
7572.64s: unlikely. But let's say not even all of them. Let's say 80% of them gap down 10%. That's not that
7578.72s: crazy to assume. That can become a massive problem. If our entire planning factor is on a 2%
7586.16s: that we think we're going to control with a stop or with an exit or whatever. That's something
7590.64s: that I think belongs in a trade log. And again, you don't have to go through that process with every
7596.16s: single ticker. You can figure out what's the worst that you've seen. And it doesn't even mean that
7601.68s: it needs to govern what you choose to put on. But it should be known. That's an important part
7610.24s: as a trader is just objectively looking at information as long as it's known and understood. And
7617.28s: that's okay. Because I again, I don't plan like that myself. I do not plan all of my trades based
7623.44s: on the worst overnight move. It's ever had in its entire history. I don't do that, but I'm aware of
7629.84s: so that as I'm sizing things, if I'm coming into a market period that for whatever reason I
7635.12s: perceive as slightly more volatile or whatever's going on, maybe I'm a little more conservative with
7640.64s: where I choose to manage or process my total portfolio risk just because of that context. Now,
7647.60s: what I'm highlighting here that I want to be very, very specific. This is like the most nuanced
7655.36s: little branch you can start going out on as a trader. But the reason why you should at least be
7661.52s: aware of this nuanced little branch is because the probability of this branch snapping and you
7668.24s: falling is very low. It's very, very low. The probability of having 30 positions on your portfolio
7674.48s: opening up in 20 of them are down by 10% on a gap down. It is so low. It's not zero. So let's say
7682.56s: that you think you're putting money into your trading account and you're like, I don't need this
7686.72s: five years. I'm okay. And you go through that experience because you're aware of it. Then you can
7691.44s: come out just fine. It's not necessarily the worst thing ever. But let's say that you're trying
7695.68s: to save up for a down payment on a house and maybe you want your money in like three years.
7700.16s: Then you open up your platform and you see that happen. I guarantee you, your decision making
7706.32s: capability is completely fucked. It is going to be entirely compromised because you just got
7712.16s: punched straight in the forehead from something you didn't see. And now you're trying to process
7717.84s: the fact that your down payment is now gone because of this drawdown that you didn't see happening.
7724.40s: So again, very, very niche nuanced super low probability event, not what I would use as a
7729.68s: planning factor, but it should be something that you should be aware of at least. That's what I
7736.08s: think about here. So yeah, just a couple ideas on that. Now, I mean, my dinner's not here yet. So
7745.52s: I'm happy to keep going. We can dive into really anything that you guys want to hit. I have a
7752.48s: generally open agenda until my B-dubs gets here. I'm actually pretty stoked for some wings.
7759.20s: Not gonna lie. Anything that you guys want to talk about?
7766.96s: And then I'll get caught up on the chat.
7774.48s: Brad says, Brad says I left a comment on the other video, but are you able to check out the unity
7782.32s: calls today? Several five K buys for 8 million premium paired with swaps, GME a lot.
7792.08s: How do we know that they're paired with GME? Just out of curiosity.
7800.64s: Day swags says I'm appreciating the Bloom's taxonomy for learning objectives.
7806.08s: What does that mean? I don't know what Bloom's taxonomy is.
7812.32s: What does that mean? I looked this up. Am I going to be?
7817.20s: Do I not want to look this up? Brad says swaps are public data. No, I'm fully aware that the swaps
7822.40s: are public data. I'm specifically asking about the relationship with GME, like what the,
7829.44s: when you're talking about the pairing, what is this?
7833.52s: Whoa, I literally have never heard of this. This looks old too. Like I see older graphics for it.
7848.40s: What is this?
7849.60s: The original, commonly for two PlexiSxonomy created by Bloom in 56. Yeah, it looked old,
7864.40s: just the stuff. As you travel up the pyramid, the level of complexity increases. Yeah, I love that.
7869.76s: The framework is important for designing, learning experience because it helped the instructor
7873.28s: identify, classify outline what they're expected to learn in the course. I love this.
7877.68s: Yo, this is cool as shit. Yo, who showed me this? They swag. Thank you very much.
7885.20s: Thank you. I literally have never heard of this. This is so cool.
7893.92s: This is so cool. Remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, and value. This is so cool.
7902.24s: This is great. Oh my God. I gotta look at, I gotta, I gotta do something with this.
7909.76s: This is so cool because this is like, this is exactly what trading is.
7919.92s: Oh, I love this. Dude, thank you so much. Yeah, they swag.
7925.36s: We gotta hook you up. We're gonna give you plus four fake internet points and then a dab.
7938.08s: Because that is super, super cool.
7947.44s: Very cool. Thank you so much for this. I love this. You have, like, I don't know if it comes,
7952.24s: I love learning new shit and this is like a really cool one to me.
7956.96s: And I think that this kind of framework is such a great reference for people.
7960.64s: Like, when you're learning about something like options, this is something I should be
7964.96s: integrating and I apologize for being ignorant to this because this is such a great way to frame
7973.60s: a lot of these things that new option traders are trying to learn that. I literally never
7980.72s: knew existed in this format, which is such a perfect format.
7984.80s: Like, understanding, being able to like reiterate something you've heard,
7988.96s: understanding the basic concepts, knowing how they work, understanding how to tie them together,
7994.72s: then being able to come up with some sort of perceived information from the things tied together.
8000.64s: And then innovating. Like, I literally love this. This is so sick.
8005.60s: Giant, giant fan. Thank you very much.
8008.64s: Big fan. I'm going to find a way to start integrating blooms,
8012.88s: taxonomy more because that is, I think that's like a really good reference for people to think
8018.48s: about like what they should be focusing on. Yeah, that's so sick.
8026.32s: I'd rather be skiing says I never saw that before either. Yeah, literally, I've never heard of
8030.24s: that. And that's so cool. Like literally, literally so cool. Big fan.
8038.32s: All right, back up towards the top, though, because I think there's a couple others.
8046.72s: Reese says I'm at whatever stage in the journey where I'm questioning why I own shares at all
8050.96s: besides the fact that they don't expire when I could express my disposition through options,
8054.48s: which are cumbersome. Yeah, well, I think that that's you kind of outline it, right? Like, when you
8058.88s: trade options, you add complexity to what you're doing. So unless there's a reason to add the complexity,
8065.04s: then that's how I personally would arrive at the answer of is the option, the correct vehicle.
8071.76s: But again, going back to the original principles, we first need to define and have a profit
8079.76s: mechanism that's in mind. And then depending on that, we can determine, you know, what makes the
8084.64s: most sense if it's something like using options because we want leverage or because we want
8091.28s: exposure to volatility or because we want something that collects theta, like those are common
8096.40s: reasons to trade options. Equities themselves are just much simpler products. So I think that's
8103.20s: essentially the way that I would navigate through when it makes sense to hold equity versus options.
8109.12s: I think that's completely fair. Paul says, do you think DJT could have a short squeeze?
8118.72s: Well, let's see. We need this.
8123.92s: It doesn't look like it right now. It's only shorted 11% days to cover is super short,
8145.20s: less than like four days. Yeah. So could it happen? Sure. Like things definitely could go down.
8152.40s: But that doesn't look like something I would consider a candidate. So there's I think I have a video
8160.16s: on squeeze. The this one's more about I don't know what this one's about. Maybe that one has something
8172.08s: that's useful in there. I don't really know. But yeah, I don't to me like as I look at this now,
8178.64s: it doesn't look like it's something I would expect a short squeeze in personally.
8191.44s: And then I think there was a couple other questions up at the top.
8196.16s: Off-Poon says, have you ever considered doing an AMA on Reddit about trading options?
8200.56s: Not really. I mean, I would be happy to. The AMA thing, I don't know, I guess it's fine. I
8206.72s: love answering questions and I love talking with people. I feel like especially, well, it depends
8212.32s: on like where on Reddit to because I just imagine the like people on Reddit would probably take
8219.20s: it as like somebody that just wants to talk about themselves, which obviously wouldn't be my intention.
8223.76s: But I mean, I would be down. But yeah, it's not something I had set up before. The way I would think
8229.84s: about that is like if for whatever reason there was interest for sure, but I don't really view
8235.60s: myself as that interesting. So I wouldn't do something white as like a bowel Eric. So yeah,
8243.60s: if it's helpful, obviously, we'd be happy to. But it's not something that I've like really thought about.
8253.76s: Okay.
8257.36s: Paul says more generally, how do you set the odds of a short squeeze? Okay, cool. Great question
8262.16s: so when looking at something like a short squeeze, there are a few things that are primary drivers.
8270.40s: Actually, that video that I sent you is is that because yeah, so the way that I look at it.
8281.68s: Short squeezes become more probable in a few scenarios. High short interest. So like greater than
8288.48s: 20% I think and then large days to cover those are the two main things I would look at personally.
8297.04s: And then exactly to off Putin's point, there's definitely squeezes that are driven by things like
8309.28s: gamma. That's super comment. Well, not super common, but I know relative in the world of squeezes,
8315.28s: that's a common cause for squeezes. So yeah, there's different origins of a squeeze. Short
8320.16s: squeeze are very, very specific as are things like gamma squeezes. But for short squeeze, I would
8324.96s: look at short interest greater than 20% and then days to cover definitely greater than four days at
8329.68s: the very, very least probably like six plus. That starts to become like really, yeah, really
8336.96s: appropriate, I think. And again, it can still be tamped down really fast. It doesn't inherently happen.
8343.04s: But I would say that those objectively would raise the conditions.
8348.40s: Vladimir off Putin says, I asked because so many have questions. Yeah, I think and I agree with you.
8355.44s: And I think that the problem is a lot of like new options traders I find when I interact with them
8361.12s: because I'll post on the options read it once in a while. But I noticed that a lot of new
8366.72s: options traders are just option traders in general. I think that they don't even know how far off
8373.68s: the mark that they are that I notice I have a hard time connecting with the people on like the options
8381.44s: read it because so many of them are at like such a basic level. And a lot of them think there's
8390.24s: so much further than they are that like trying to talk to somebody like, for example, if I made a
8397.76s: post actually, I think I did make a post about this. Let me see. I'm just curious now because I think
8402.48s: I made a post about profit mechanisms at one point on the options read it. Well, let me see.
8410.64s: Yeah, here we go. Literally perfect. And this is like this is exactly why I think Reddit is a
8422.96s: is a tricky place to operate because you can see like I made a post about
8430.96s: creating like focusing on profit mechanisms and you can see like literally it got
8435.36s: downvoted into oblivion. So I think the the thing is with people on Reddit, they're at like such
8443.36s: a different level when it comes to options. It's so elementary that I think the way that I do
8450.64s: things is probably not even relatable to them. That's what I think because and I still go on
8457.04s: Reddit to interact because I do know that there are people on there that are trying to figure this
8461.12s: stuff out like they're trying to they're trying. And I know that a lot of people will go there
8467.76s: and you know, try to get some information. So I do try to post there once in a while
8474.48s: again to just try to help new traders. But the stuff that's celebrated there is the stuff that I
8480.40s: actually think it just sets traders up like it's there was a post not too long ago that I saw that
8486.48s: somebody had like a straight winning week or whatever and like the Reddit exploded about that
8491.68s: like they really, really loved that which is cool. I think it's really cool to celebrate each other's
8497.60s: victories. But to me, the fact that people find that cool is so troublesome. And I think that
8510.08s: explaining that to somebody would come across as me like trying to tear down somebody else,
8515.76s: you know, who's doing well, which is clearly not my fucking objective at all. But people are
8524.08s: like really sensitive and they're very superficial I find on there. So I try to share like
8531.44s: straight up information as best as I can. And I'll share a little bit about like my path and my
8536.64s: journey because I do think that that's probably helpful for people to hear because it is helpful to
8543.44s: see somebody that's again, like not supremely educated kind of just a basic average dude that
8550.24s: has been able to figure some of this out. Right. So I know that there's some value there.
8556.96s: But yeah, maybe we can set up like an AMA. I don't even know really how to do an AMA. I've never
8562.24s: done one. So but maybe we can set one up on like a live stream or something. I don't know if that's
8566.96s: easier. Is it better to do them on like a written platform? I literally have never done it.
8573.84s: But I would I would be down to I would be down. I just don't know how to do it.
8580.96s: The doing it on like a YouTube live is easy. But I don't know if that's the right format for how
8586.88s: people would want to do it. Yeah. Ricky says I feel like all your live streams are basically AMAs.
8594.08s: Yeah. And I try to be like really open to questions. So then that's I'm glad to hear that because
8600.24s: that's one of the big objectives. I think maybe structuring something that's I don't know.
8606.40s: I don't know if it's better to be more meta or less meta because on the live streams and stuff,
8612.96s: we actually spend very little time talking about like governance, meaning how how I even started
8620.80s: doing all this stuff. How I did this was like on active duty in the Marine Corps at the full-time
8625.76s: job deploying like all those kinds of things are just not really spent on because I generally don't
8632.00s: care that much to talk about myself. But that would be like more meta and then there's like sub meta
8638.88s: stuff. That would be like very, very specific with respect to approach. And those I feel like would be
8647.04s: easy because I those we do all the time, right? Like talking very specifically about approach. And
8652.88s: that's mostly with a lot of the videos are as well. So I'll think about it. Like one of the one of
8660.88s: the ways we could do it if it would be useful is I could set up like a Google form and see if people
8666.56s: prefer to like submit stuff that way so that if people like to like write out something. So I also
8672.48s: know on YouTube live, you're limited by the number of characters. It's like super succinct. So we
8678.32s: could do something like that like a Google form. And then obviously we can have more questions or
8683.44s: whatever during the during the live session. If if people are interested, I'm down again, I haven't
8690.16s: really thought about it because I don't find myself that interesting to that degree. But happy to
8695.04s: it would be helpful. Sedric says, did you start with trading or investing investing for sure? I
8701.28s: started I started with buying a few a few shares of companies that I saw and I did that for like
8709.68s: a few months. And then I immediately started pivoting to options. So yeah.
8715.68s: And then Ricky says, what practice were you into Lloyd auditor at KPMG for a minute and it's
8721.76s: sucked? Sounds like yeah, I was in consulting. So auditor sounds terrible. There's nothing to me that
8729.28s: sounds even remotely interesting about auditing. Hey, swag says, although our bank accounts have
8736.32s: different dollars, there's still something extremely relatable to you. Yeah, well, it's because I
8740.96s: probably bet whatever your bank account was, I probably had it and probably worse. I don't know,
8747.04s: maybe yours is like really, really bad. But I mean, I've definitely have had zero dollars in
8750.72s: mind before. So yeah, that is that is right up. So yeah, let me think about that. I'll actually work
8760.96s: on setting up like a Google form. And then we can set up like a AMA session. I probably would do
8767.20s: it on a YouTube live stream because I honestly much prefer these and I'd rather talk to you all.
8771.92s: It's way better than like responding to fucking Reddit posts, I think. But I can collect like
8779.12s: different questions and stuff there and see and kind of integrate them. So yeah, let's take a look at that.
8786.32s: All right, gang, super fun. I hope the session was useful. I hope that those common mistakes make
8791.44s: sense. I hope that you have a pretty clear roadmap on how I would go about doing things. And then
8797.44s: as I said, I entirely encourage you to pop in the discord, go into the beginners section because
8803.20s: there's one there built for you. And you can share what you're working on with each other. I obviously
8808.40s: will do my best to jump in for the Patreon folks. We have a specific room that I obviously will
8813.68s: do my best to prioritize called the learning lab. So that if somebody has like a roadmap, they built
8818.80s: I can give you feedback. But the goal is to share the things that I really think are transformative
8824.72s: for me and hopefully can make a difference in somebody else's trading career and approach.
8830.40s: Because what I can tell you unequivocally is trading is not easy to start. But once you build the
8839.12s: skill set, it's it genuinely is tremendously simple. And it is one of the very few things you can do
8848.24s: that there are no clients, there are no meetings, there are no customers, there are no partners,
8855.36s: there are no bosses. It is truly one of the few things you can do in this world that is as
8864.08s: solo of an endeavor as you can think of in all of the positives that go with that. Because even if
8871.04s: you start a business, you're still responsible to people. You still have to pay roles. You still
8878.56s: have to make sure that your customers are happy. That is really, really challenging for people.
8885.20s: And trading is completely different. Trading doesn't have any of that. Trading is just you.
8893.52s: So whatever you're able to do is dependent on you, tons of autonomy. But there's also drawbacks
8900.80s: to that. A lot of people struggle to handle that amount of autonomy. Which again, that's one of
8905.60s: the reasons why we have our community, the outlier community is to help support one another in that
8910.16s: and to add some structure. So that's the idea. That's why I think it's worth your while. And even if
8916.32s: you trade and realize that trading is not for you, you will be better off as a human being by at least
8921.20s: going through the process of attempting to trade understanding risk better, understanding yourself
8925.44s: better. It's a win. The main thing is just don't lose all your fucking money and then it's a win.
8930.56s: I'll see you guys on the GME live stream tomorrow at 5 p.m. Pacific time. And then yeah, I'll
8936.88s: give you a Google form, gend up. And then we can set up some sort of AMA, which hopefully
8942.16s: would be a good time. I would definitely enjoy interacting and sharing anything that's useful. So
8947.68s: that'll be fun. All right, gang. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
