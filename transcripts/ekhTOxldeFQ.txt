0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.72s:  you
64.56s:  where
67.36s:  What's up, outliers, we have, I think, our final options trading for beginners session
92.04s:  for today. So I am slightly, I don't know, like, I mean, we'll still do the live sessions
101.28s:  on Friday, but I'm going to pivot away from like this specific focus necessarily on
106.64s:  like a topic. It'll still be for beginners, but I'm going to leave it to be a little
113.20s:  bit more open-ended. So the goal of this session for today is actually to walk through
122.04s:  a path forward and to talk about three of the biggest mistakes that I see and hopefully
130.52s:  the goal here would give you some ideas on how this trading journey will look like for
137.00s:  you going forward. So I am very excited to get into this. I'm also very excited because
143.28s:  I have a new self-inflating lumbar support thing so that I can apparently hopefully
151.04s:  sit a little more comfortably looking forward to that. But as you know, we got to say hello
156.88s:  to everybody. Let me grab this chat and let's get right in. So a few things right from
162.44s:  the jump. As always, this is a live session. So feel free to jump in with anything that
169.56s:  you want to cover. That is the entire goal. I'm going to get through some set material
173.84s:  first and then we'll go more into like the open-ended side of things. But yeah, come
179.92s:  with whatever you want to talk about. Alright, so the starting point for the session today
184.48s:  is three common beginner mistakes. And there's essentially an entire listicle series you
191.32s:  can do off of this. You can do 10, 15, 20, 50. Like there's a bunch of trade-em mistakes.
196.28s:  But the goal for this is to talk about it in kind of a broad sense. And the reason why
203.20s:  I want to talk about it in a broad sense is because I think that by covering these broader
210.96s:  topics, I think you will have some tools to then build out going forward that cover specifics.
220.20s:  So as most of the stuff that I do, you're not going to get a lot of highly prescriptive
225.72s:  things like never do blank. Because guess what? Like I've learned in my trading career
232.72s:  that sometimes there is a time and reason to do whatever it is that you're never supposed
237.96s:  to do. So I don't really speak in absolutes. So let's talk about where this begins. And
245.44s:  it starts on this blank screen. But the first thing I actually want to start with before
249.60s:  I bring up the first item that I think is a really common mistake is I want to ask
254.88s:  you in the chat. So if you were to summarize the top three biggest trading mistakes focused
264.92s:  a little bit on options traders. Obviously, what would you guess they are? And you can throw
270.32s:  one, two, or three. I want to give you a few seconds to think about that. And while
276.64s:  you're answering, my guess is we are going to see a highly varied set of answers. And
285.04s:  I want to highlight that the fact that I'm expecting a highly varied set of answers.
291.16s:  Because if I don't see a highly varied set of answers, obviously, I'd be completely
297.84s:  wrong. But my guess is that your answers are actually going to introduce my first point,
306.44s:  which I'm excited for. So Rhys says for myself or all traders, whatever, it's up to you.
316.36s:  Joey says probably a profit versus expectancy. That's a really interesting one. Roaring
321.96s:  Titty is focusing on changing stops and not thinking about entries and exits. I like
327.00s:  that. Brad says expiring too soon things that are out of the money. I think that's a good
333.72s:  long song. He long song says not knowing how to roll covered calls. Another really good one.
337.80s:  So a lot of I would qualify these as kind of tactical levels. So for those that are unfamiliar
344.12s:  with like the military hierarchy crap. I just dropped my thing one second. I can grab that.
358.52s:  I just scared the crap out of Thor because I dropped my little tablet when I was trying to
362.76s:  grab it. And Thor was just like, yo, I am not here for that. He's literally sitting at like a
370.84s:  alert right now.
381.96s:  All right. We had to make sure that the homie was good. So for those that don't know,
386.84s:  the military kind of thinks about different layers and levels very specifically with respect to
394.76s:  how we organize stuff. So when we talk about trading, a lot of what I do is adaptations of what
402.84s:  I've learned in the military. So one of the things here is we have strategic level.
409.72s:  Then we have operational.
419.24s:  And then we have tactical.
424.44s:  So I'm not here to teach you about military history and orders, process, and stuff like that.
430.12s:  This is all going to be trading focused. I just want these relationships to make sense to you
434.76s:  as I use them because it's literally how I talk about this stuff. So just think strategic
439.96s:  is like the 30k even bigger than that probably. Call it like the 100,000 foot view.
445.96s:  And then maybe call this like the 30k foot view. And then we would call this kind of like front line.
456.04s:  So essentially a lot of the things that you highlighted to me. So things like
461.72s:  probability of profit versus expectancy, I would bucket that here.
466.04s:  Something like changing stops bad entries exits, I would bucket that here.
471.64s:  Something like buying options that expire too soon like Brad's talking about, I would bucket that
476.60s:  here. Something like not knowing how to roll covered calls very specific. That's very tactical.
484.68s:  Taking profits early, which is kind of a dovetail off of Joey, I would probably bucket that here.
491.56s:  That Lauren says for getting to look at theta, I would bucket that here.
499.32s:  Ricky says taking profits early doesn't seem like a big issue better than watching your trade go red.
504.12s:  Ah, we have, we now have a really important conversation to have because anybody that knows me
514.04s:  is probably I am going to disagree vehemently with Ricky vehemently. And Ricky's, their position is
523.72s:  not unfounded. I understand that mindset. And it's because that's one of the perversions of
530.84s:  the trader mindset is your thought that that's supposed to be enlightened. Right. The idea of
536.52s:  take a smaller profit rather than let your trade run red. Right. That sounds not greedy.
542.52s:  It sounds like you're doing the right things, but it's actually not enlightened at all.
548.92s:  Unfortunately. So Ricky, it's a completely reasonable thing to say. I would have said the same thing.
555.72s:  Like there's absolutely nothing wrong with that as a theory. The problem is it's a perverted theory
562.44s:  that people don't fully understand. So we'll talk about that in a little bit, but ear market.
570.04s:  Because what you brought up is completely fair and it's so common. And I want to make sure we
576.44s:  talk about that specifically, but absolutely fantastic point. Vladimir says I close some calls.
586.68s:  Reese says Eric might disagree. One of the biggest things I've learned from him. Yeah, exactly.
590.68s:  Reese's spot on. I do disagree. Cedric says looking at macro economic events. That's interesting
596.84s:  because I actually don't think that's bad. I think over waiting it wouldn't be good. But I would
603.40s:  call macro economic events probably somewhere like here. I would call it maybe operational.
609.48s:  Maybe a little bit of strategic, but mostly operational level still.
614.68s:  Roing Titty. Roing Titty. Everybody shout out to Roing Titty. One of the greatest names on earth
619.80s:  says, oh, triggered. Cedric says, I am of the belief most money is lost, not in a recession,
627.64s:  but preventing one. It's the same with taking profit, taking on trading. That confuses me a little bit.
636.76s:  I think we'll talk about it a little bit, but the idea about profit taking is not most people,
642.60s:  I notice, especially when I'll take a position on something, they'll generally think that if I
648.52s:  disagree with a position that then I inherently mean the inverse, which is actually very rarely the case.
655.64s:  But I think something like profit taking the way I would bucket it broadly is that it's very,
662.44s:  very nuanced, which we'll talk about. And Mike says, hey, fellas, Mike, it's fellas and ladies to
673.16s:  you. I would I will happily let you know, hold on, let me check my YouTube analytics right now.
678.92s:  I am overflowing with female audience members. It's like, it's incredible how many,
686.28s:  what's your guess? If you were to speculate how many male versus female as a percentage,
692.84s:  what's the percentage you would guess here? I'm going to start a poll.
697.32s:  What percentage of Eric's audience is male?
714.60s:  Less than 10, we'll do 25% to make it faster, less than 25,
720.36s:  25 to 50%.
733.32s:  Then we'll do like 50 to 75.
742.44s:  Okay, so most, all right, well, I realized that the poll is, you guys are all way closer than I was
747.88s:  expecting. I thought I might have misled you well enough. So I actually need to reconfigure my
752.20s:  poll because apparently I didn't trick anybody. So we'll do like 80. I think there's actually enough
760.20s:  responses in here. I can probably just guess. So I see 80%, 99%, 93%, I see Lauren raising her hand,
772.44s:  offering herself as the notification that there is a female.
777.72s:  Lauren Titty is letting us know that there is a second female with us. So yeah, fun fact,
785.08s:  it is 94.4% male, 5.7% female. And then it looks like the bulk for Brad says under 35,
799.72s:  fascinating enough, it's not. So under 35 is 27.4% at 25 to 34. And then 4% 18 to 24. So the bulk of my
816.68s:  people, this is actually news to me, the bulk of my people are 35 to 44, 34% with 20% 45 to 54.
825.80s:  And then 10% 55 to 64. And then 4% 65 plus fascinating. That was actually kind of fun. I did not,
836.04s:  I wouldn't have guessed some of that myself. Vladimir says, wait, how do you know the gender, Eric?
844.52s:  It's a great question because what do you, what even is a, I'm in California. So I don't even know
850.52s:  what a fucking gender is at this point. So yeah, I mean, one of my favorite things to do, I'm not
855.72s:  even kidding is when I go places like physical therapy and whatnot and like you're filling out
859.24s:  the forms, I literally will fuck around and I'll say that, oh, I'm obviously a female. It's
864.92s:  kind of shocking to me that you could think I'm anything else, but and that's obviously for the
872.28s:  people that are trans or whatever it is, like whatever makes you happy, makes me happy. But I also
879.00s:  like to play games and fuck around with people because it's fun. And I think it's completely fair
884.36s:  that most people would assume I mail. It's a fair guess, but it's very fun in California
892.52s:  like every time I go donate blood. My favorite thing is if I have the ability to fill out a
897.56s:  form before I go. And then I get to, because then obviously they're expecting something and then
905.64s:  normally I'll do you know that I'm a six foot 223 pound female and I just find that very entertaining.
917.00s:  It's very confusing to people, which I'm here for. So
924.52s:  Brad says, what percentage of your audience is non-binary? Actually, it showed 0% as like non-disclosed.
929.80s:  I think it calls it not necessarily non-binary, but Joey says Eric is going to get Estrogen
936.84s:  by accident one day. That would be hilarious because actually if you get some Estrogen,
943.40s:  it can actually spike testosterone because testosterone starts to counteract the excess Estrogen.
950.60s:  So maybe that's the way to do it. Roaring Titty says Native Americans recognize several
956.28s:  genders as well. Yeah, definitely. Well, I think the problem is, well, I don't want to get into that
960.36s:  debate. But yeah, I think I like telling people when I'm going to an appointment that I'm female,
967.88s:  because I find it funny. But beyond that, that Lauren says, I'm so old that woman, the assman,
974.20s:  and a medical forms, what pro-known I know was I didn't know what it meant. Same. That one's
978.12s:  also very funny to me. But I just come from like, just treat everybody with respect as long as
986.12s:  there's mutual respect. I don't give a fuck. That's how I feel. So back to trading though,
993.56s:  a lot of the things that you all highlighted in my opinion fall in this bucket, the very, very
1000.12s:  tactical level bucket. And that's okay. This actually is in line with what I would expect
1007.40s:  a newer trader to think they should be focusing on is the very tactical level of things.
1014.44s:  Now, if you know anything about me or the content that I produce, you're probably going to be a
1019.56s:  little upset for this video about three common beginner mistakes because we're actually going to
1024.60s:  spend all of the time up here. And here's why. If you get the strategic and operational components
1034.28s:  of trading down, literally, the tactical level of trading will straight up take care of itself.
1043.56s:  It will take care of itself. And I know that sounds weird esoteric, but it's really not. It really
1048.44s:  is not. And you'll see why. So the goal here is to try and offer a way to model and think about
1056.36s:  trading that's sustainable in does well. Cedric says strategic guess, valuing a company, even
1064.76s:  higher level than that. So in a trading way, well, it kind of like in a trading language,
1073.40s:  the way that I think about the strategic level, that was a fun squeal line, the way I think about
1078.52s:  the strategic level is like we're literally talking about things like philosophy. We're talking about
1085.56s:  self-awareness. We're talking about habits and dependencies.
1101.24s:  So at this strategic level, we're talking about literally what governs everything else we do.
1111.56s:  At the operational level is how we trade. What's our approach? What do we think we do? That's
1123.24s:  operational level. What's the broad mandates that we follow? Tactical level is the execution
1130.28s:  of the skill set. So let's now take a look at what Eric seems to believe these three mistakes
1143.80s:  are. We'll start with the very first one, lack of structure. Does this surprise you in the least
1152.20s:  that I would call this out? Like to me, as I think about the very first mistake, every single
1163.08s:  option trader makes, myself included, is a complete and utter lack of structure. 100%.
1172.84s:  So for example, I have another question for the chat. If you were to tell somebody,
1179.24s:  these are the first three things you need to learn in order to be an options trader.
1188.36s:  What are those things? What would you tell them? And I'll give you a few moments to throw it
1192.92s:  in the chat. You can list one, two, or three, whatever you want. But I want to know from each person
1197.80s:  that's willing to participate, what are three, what are the three things you would tell
1203.24s:  somebody that says, hey, I want to be an options trader. What are the first three things I should do?
1208.36s:  What are those? And again, what I'm going to highlight is something that I don't think most people
1215.96s:  consider. So so far, Cedric says, understand the mechanics of options and why they are used
1222.04s:  completely fair. I think that that's very reasonable. Joe says risk management also completely
1228.52s:  reasonable. Elon's song says, block some time to learn, gotta create a space in order to pick
1233.64s:  up the skill set makes a ton of sense. Off Putin says paper trade first. I also think that that's
1239.96s:  a fair answer. Roy Titty says position size stops something something delta. Fair. I don't think
1247.32s:  anything. Those are like good foundational concepts. Paulo says learn technical analysis. You
1253.80s:  got to figure out what you want to trade. That Lauren says learn the Greeks. We need to know how
1259.88s:  options behave. I'd rather be skiing says risk slash money management. So we've seen that one,
1265.72s:  the very first one twice now. That's the only thing we've seen twice so far. Create a plan system,
1270.76s:  create rules to follow that plan and never deviate. Let's talk about that one just a little bit in a
1277.64s:  second. Joey says purpose and portfolio fit. Gotta know what we're trying to do with our money.
1283.96s:  So let's Brad says learn to control your emotions. Huge one. We're actually going to talk about
1290.36s:  that one. So let's go to I'd rather be skiing's comment specifically the create rules to follow
1298.20s:  that plan and never deviate. So if I were let's let's say a jujitsu player and let's say that I'm
1309.48s:  a white belt. I'm brand and I actually technically I'm a white belt because I've been a jujitsu dude
1315.32s:  my whole life essentially for like 15 years but I've been in a gee like four times. So technically I
1320.52s:  am a white belt. I actually love being able to tell that people with a clear conscience. So
1328.04s:  if I'm working with a brand new white belt. Is it fair for me to say?
1334.44s:  Is it fair for me to say to a white belt. Create your own approach to jujitsu and never deviate from it.
1344.60s:  Make your own and never deviate from it. Do we think that that's reasonable for me to tell a brand
1353.16s:  new jujitsu player? No, doesn't make sense does it? But we say all the time in trading. We say it all
1363.00s:  the time in trading. We tell new traders make a plan and never deviate because it sounds good.
1371.80s:  It makes sense. But guess what? They're the last person that's in a place to make something that
1379.80s:  they should never deviate from. They don't even know what they don't know yet. And again, I'd rather
1386.04s:  be skiing. There's absolutely nothing wrong with what you said because it makes sense. That's
1390.52s:  another thing that you absolutely consider as a new trader because you'll hear that. But again,
1397.96s:  it's just not logical. OMG legend says 15 year white belt. I think if you're grappling in BJJ
1405.00s:  for 15 years, you're grappling and not ranked via a belt. I mean, technically speaking, they still
1409.96s:  will like we still do belts for no gui. But it's like non-traditional. That's why I make the joke.
1415.96s:  It's like in a traditional sense, I literally have been in a kimono like literally less than
1421.88s:  a handful of times. So in a traditional sense, I am absolutely a white belt. But yeah, I mean,
1428.52s:  I've been grappling the vast majority of my adult life. It's actually super fun too. Like I said,
1434.36s:  it's always hilarious to me. Like if I'm traveling somewhere and I go to a new gym and they're like,
1438.84s:  what level are you? Again, I can say with a clean soul. Like I am a white belt. But that's not my skill
1445.00s:  level. I don't think. But it's my technical level. So pretty fun. So anyways,
1454.76s:  in this context back to trading, as you guys could tell, right? Like the same thing when I'm doing
1460.12s:  the doctor stuff. I just like fucking with people. I just like these little jokes specifically that
1464.92s:  denigrate me more often than not. But I like, I like jokes. I think it's, I think it's fun. Yeah,
1470.60s:  exactly. Joey picked up on it exactly. I just like playing with people. It's fun.
1474.44s:  Another one of my favorite things to do is whenever I donate blood and they say like,
1478.12s:  oh, are you scared of needles or anything? I always tell them that I'm fucking terrified.
1482.84s:  And every time it's like magic, they end up pairing me with like this really tiny nurse that's
1488.28s:  always super sweet and nice to me. And then every time I stand up after donate, I pretend to pass out
1493.64s:  to see what they would do. Fun fact, all of them would let me drop on my fucking face. But I love
1499.88s:  doing that too. It's too funny. It's way too funny. So yeah, I enjoy having some fun with people.
1506.60s:  It's a good time. So if we think about though exactly what we're talking about
1516.52s:  with like a new trader creating their own rules set, very difficult to do that.
1521.08s:  So then how do we get there? Let's say, oh, Joey,
1526.84s:  I haven't thought of that one. Joey, that one's actually hilarious.
1533.88s:  Joey says whenever I go out to eat, I order something and then when they ask if I have allergies,
1538.20s:  I say one of the main ingredients. I literally love that. It's like
1546.60s:  getting a pizza and be like, oh, yeah, I'm allergic to flour. Can't do flour.
1552.12s:  I love that. That's so fun. All right. So lack of structure. Where does this all go with
1558.92s:  lack of structure? It's super simple. The idea is if I were to tell somebody,
1565.96s:  you need to teach a 10-year-old, let's just say the 10-year-old is a non-native English speaker.
1576.28s:  And you need to teach a 10-year-old how to speak English. What's the very first thing you
1582.52s:  would have them learn? The very first thing. Throw that in the chat. My guess is we'll probably find
1590.04s:  a little bit more of a trend here. That's my hypothesis. Run, spot, run. Hey, I don't know.
1600.20s:  I'm assuming that's a reference to something, but I actually don't know what that's from.
1603.08s:  Alphabet is what Brad says.
1609.96s:  Vialobo says picture books.
1614.36s:  Follow says common words. I'd rather be skiing says maybe saying their name in another person's name.
1620.84s:  Okay. So Joey goes with IU, they them us we. Okay.
1628.28s:  I'm not going to lie, this is more varied than I thought, but it still highlights an interesting
1635.16s:  point because I can see some very common threads as I look at this. So Brad is starting with the
1644.04s:  alphabet. What are the letters? What are the symbols we use to represent noise? And then other folks
1650.44s:  like Vialobo, Paulo, Vladimir, I'd rather be skiing. They're going with more the practical approach.
1659.48s:  Right? So those are like two giant differences between the methodology that we literally just
1665.00s:  summarized if somebody was to start to learn English. We have the structural approach.
1672.52s:  Alphabet. And then Joey used like specific words or phrases.
1680.84s:  And then there's kind of a more experiential approach.
1689.72s:  This is more go watch a movie with subtitles.
1696.68s:  This is talk with kids.
1701.72s:  As you're you know outplaying with them or whatever.
1703.96s:  If we look at this, there's two kind of general approaches here, but what's common behind all of this?
1717.64s:  The main commonality I see is we're starting with basics. However, we get to those basics,
1724.12s:  but we start with basics. Okay. So now why am I going through this example with you?
1729.80s:  Is because I'm trying to highlight a completely different model that we apply in trading.
1737.48s:  So one more example and then I promise I'll tie it in. If I were trying to teach somebody math.
1746.28s:  Right? Let's say that they're new to math. What are some of the beginning ways that I would
1752.28s:  teach them math? I would probably start with things like derivatives or maybe I'll start with
1759.72s:  like proofs. Now obviously not. I would start with numbers. I would start with addition, subtraction.
1770.12s:  Maybe, maybe hit them over the head with some pendoz. Maybe then move them to algebra.
1778.68s:  So, notice is taxes. That's the last thing I would teach somebody that's new to math because I
1784.52s:  wouldn't want them to quit on life before they even started. I feel like that would just be absolutely
1791.56s:  absolutely brutal. Absolutely brutal.
1799.56s:  So when we look at the learning process though for something like math,
1807.88s:  what I'm highlighting is regardless of your background with math, there's a general approach you
1814.92s:  would take. You would start with some basic shit. You would then start with some less basic shit.
1820.84s:  Then you would go to some moderate shit, then some like medium moderate shit. And this happens like
1826.76s:  year over year over year. This happens with a teacher showing you how to do it. This happens with
1835.24s:  exams. This happens with quizzes. This happens with projects. Yes, I actually had fucking math projects.
1841.48s:  You want to talk about a demoralizing event. Do a math project.
1846.60s:  So when we look at the process of learning math or really anything else, it's a very building block
1853.48s:  approach because exactly to Brad's point, still got to learn numbers. He's 100% correct. It's the
1857.96s:  same thing when we're talking about learning English. If you're going to learn English to be able to
1862.52s:  speak, read and write, you still have to know the fucking alphabet. So there's basic things that you
1868.76s:  learn. Yet, if I go back up to what you guys told me, you would tell a brand new options trader they
1876.12s:  should start with. I saw things like risk management, which is good. There's nothing wrong with that.
1882.36s:  But that's pretty specific. I saw something about probability of profit versus expectancy.
1888.28s:  I would see a common mistake of not knowing how to roll covered calls.
1893.80s:  So if we're talking about first steps, there is stuff like learn technical analysis.
1900.04s:  Shit. What is technical analysis? If I'm a new options trader, what the fuck does that even mean?
1907.64s:  So what I'm highlighting and hopefully delivering together with a bow is that the first step for a new
1914.92s:  option trader is to build a fucking structure to learn because you are in the wild west.
1924.28s:  There's nobody out there telling you what to do. There's nobody out there that's quizzing you
1930.92s:  on what you've learned. There's nobody out there giving you practice fucking problems. It is you,
1937.96s:  the individual. It is all you. So the whole point here, and this is again, why I built this exact
1948.36s:  thing for us. And this isn't even what I would consider to be like the ultimate end state. This is
1953.64s:  just something to offer somebody so that you have something because I recognize that there's a giant
1961.00s:  gap for this that people want to start talking about things like probability of profit versus
1967.24s:  expectancy, which is a really important lesson. But should that happen before compounding interest
1972.84s:  is well understood? And my guess is just like if we all took myself included, if we all took a basic
1980.60s:  math test that like a five year old had to take, we probably would not get all of those questions
1984.84s:  right. I would guess because you know how that goes. Sometimes those kind of math problems can be
1988.44s:  like really, really specific. The point is is even people that are really well seasoned traders.
1994.28s:  My guess is if you go through these starting modules like this, you'll probably find a bunch of
2001.64s:  shit that you don't know. Probably. So even though we're trying to operate down here on using
2009.64s:  intraday gax in zero DTE SPX options to inform entry periods, we might not know some of the
2018.68s:  fundamental concepts that govern literally the process of trading or learning. Notice how the
2026.60s:  humor of all of this is and I will continue to reiterate this point because I think it's very
2032.12s:  important is that the question I say is most common option trader mistakes. I haven't even
2041.64s:  mentioned the fucking word options yet. I haven't even said the word because it doesn't matter.
2051.08s:  It options themselves are just vehicles. We have to get a lot of other things
2060.04s:  solidified first before we even think about options which leads us to the next common mistake.
2070.60s:  It's a broken foundation to options or trading in general because most options traders immediately
2082.76s:  start jumping in somewhere like here. This is where we have an option trader that's relatively new.
2091.32s:  Maybe they've studied options for a few months or a few years and they're like, well, let me,
2096.28s:  this is going to be my strategy because I'm supposed to make a plan that I never deviate from.
2101.88s:  So my plan is going to be to buy seven day options that are out of 15 delta because they're really
2107.64s:  cheap and it controls my risk. That's what I'm supposed to do. That's another thing that we covered
2113.72s:  that is super important is risk management. So if I buy these call options, then I'm controlling my
2120.68s:  risk from the jump and then I'm going to exit the trade every single time. It's up two dollars
2127.08s:  because the other thing I was taught is that I'm supposed to manage my winning trades because I can't
2132.76s:  let a winning trade turn into a losing trade. That's another thing that I'm not supposed to do.
2139.56s:  So I'm doing a good job now, right? I'm creating a plan that I'm never going to deviate from.
2144.84s:  I'm managing risk. I'm not letting winning trades turn into losing trades.
2150.04s:  Guess what? That trader is going to fucking fail. Strait up. That trader that's following all
2157.00s:  of the rules and doing the right things is straight up going to fail. And it's because they are
2164.28s:  focusing on the entire wrong shit. They're focusing on the entire wrong stuff. It doesn't even matter
2170.36s:  yet. And that's why I try to highlight, I'm calling it the big four trade process because in my
2178.28s:  opinion, these are the big four steps that have to happen if you want to be a successful trader.
2188.20s:  Every single trade, these four steps have to happen. So before I determine if I want to sell a
2196.76s:  30 DTE option, 10 DTE option, five delta, or if I want to buy the 15 delta, none of that
2206.68s:  matters. If I don't have a completely clear line of sight on what the profit mechanism is,
2215.80s:  what is it that I'm making money from? The second step is to create a signal.
2225.80s:  We need to measure the profit mechanism as it sits. We need to know when the profit mechanism
2233.08s:  exists. And we need to understand the qualities of the profit, the profit mechanism.
2242.20s:  So that leads us to our next spot. And what do you notice so far? This is again a video
2253.32s:  about option trader mistakes. What's the, what's what do you notice? I still haven't even said the word
2260.92s:  options. I got through the first mistake with not using the word options. It's in there because
2268.28s:  you do need to learn about options once you develop structure, but the mistake of lacking structure
2272.68s:  is nothing to do with options. The next thing broke trade foundation. The first things as part of
2280.12s:  the big four trade process is not about options at all. Literally at all. You don't get to even
2289.72s:  worry about options until you get here. That's all there is to it because here's why. If I'm worried
2302.20s:  about if I'm going to buy a 30 delta call or buy a 20 delta call, that's what I care about.
2311.64s:  What happens if the underlying goes down? If I buy a 30 delta call or if I buy the 10 delta call,
2320.20s:  15 delta call, what happens? Underline goes down.
2329.40s:  Any guesses? Lose money. That's exactly correct. Reese is 100% correct. You fucking lose money.
2339.16s:  And Joey adds a little color around it, which is important. You lose money depending on what it is.
2345.32s:  So the way and the quality that you lose money, the circumstances will be slightly different.
2350.12s:  But guess what? You fucking lose money. Same thing to the inverse. Let's say that I'm deciding if I
2359.80s:  should sell a put or buy a call. Sell a put or buy a call. Underline goes up.
2366.76s:  What happens to my trade? If I sell a put or buy a call and the underlying goes up, what happens?
2381.72s:  Any guesses?
2390.28s:  Make money defined with put. Cedric says depending on IV, not so much.
2395.48s:  Joey says depends, not so much, doesn't.
2400.76s:  Brad says say it again. I'll say it again for the homies in the back.
2404.92s:  If I sell a put or buy a call and the underlying price goes up, what happens?
2413.16s:  Roryn Clity says P&L moons, potentially on the right path. Roryn Titty says income is capped
2420.36s:  on selling the put. It's correct. Joey says, well, if the call goes up, if it goes up a little,
2427.32s:  the call may lose money. Not in that scenario because we haven't added anything about volatility.
2434.12s:  So even we haven't talked about the passage of time. Literally just saying, if I buy a call,
2438.92s:  underlying goes up. Not adding any other qualifiers. I'm not saying time is past. I'm not saying
2445.08s:  volatility has changed. Simply underlying has gone up. Cedric says make money then. It's exactly
2451.24s:  correct. The point I'm making here is that if I sell a put or buy a call and the underlying goes
2459.32s:  up, I fucking make money. I make money. So what I'm trying to highlight to you is that this is
2470.68s:  this is trading. This is trading. I'm going to keep saying this is trading. This here.
2478.84s:  This is what trading is. Because once you understand this, then you can figure out how to best
2489.00s:  fit what you're doing for your circumstance. But it doesn't matter what you end up choosing
2497.24s:  if it's built on a faulty foundation. That doesn't matter. You have to understand profit mechanisms
2508.36s:  first signals second. That is unequivocally the case. Because then if I'm a new options trader,
2519.24s:  but I'm really good at understanding profit mechanisms, I've put in the time to understand
2525.00s:  post earnings announcement drift. I understand variance or premiums. I understand the market
2529.80s:  exhibits positive drift. I understand that if something crosses below a 50 day moving average
2534.92s:  on average for this specific product, it'll fall to a maximum of x percent before after certain
2540.68s:  amount of days. It rallies back up above it. That's all simple research to do. And once that's done,
2548.28s:  then I can either sell the put or buy a call. It doesn't matter. I'm going to make money either
2553.08s:  away. So then I can say, OK, I can fairly reliably identify this profit mechanism as it sits.
2562.36s:  I understand when it happens because I've tested different signals. I understand the behavior
2570.44s:  of the profit mechanism. Then I can figure out what structures generally fit with the profit mechanism.
2578.92s:  Again, something goes up short call. I'm sorry short put long call either or totally fine.
2585.16s:  And then I can build strategies about those structures that let me maximize things. So for example,
2595.40s:  if I'm trading something like let's look at JPM. If I look at something like JPM,
2603.24s:  and I see it rallying up here, let's just say I'm bullish for whatever reason. I don't have anything
2607.80s:  in JPM just using it as a random example. So I see a few things, right? Higher lows, higher highs,
2614.60s:  bit of a decline, but still a higher low that's now rallying up and out. Let's just say I'm bullish for
2619.48s:  whatever reason. If I'm bullish in here, the next part of what I need to do is say how bullish in
2626.28s:  what time frame? Do I think that this is going to skyrocket from 211 to 225? Maybe, maybe I do, maybe I
2633.56s:  don't. It depends on the individual trader. But what I'm going to tell you is that if I think it's
2639.40s:  going to go from 211 to 225 in the next week, I'm going to put on a different trade than if I think
2646.44s:  it might take a month to get from 211 to 225. Or maybe I think it might catch up to this high
2654.04s:  in here and then stall out. That's still up. I can still make money on it going up. But instead of
2661.40s:  buying a ratio called diagonal, maybe I sell puts. Maybe that complements the portfolio better.
2669.64s:  But the point is we have to clearly identify what it is we're trying to trade and then we have
2677.24s:  to study it so that we understand how it behaves. Another great example is if I'm running any sort
2684.36s:  of breakout trade. So here, I'm going to look for things that have consolidated for at least
2691.64s:  10 days and they've stayed within a 15% range. And then I want to see something that's at least
2699.88s:  5% greater than a bar ago. Let's see what we get. This is my bad. I have to fix this because I want
2708.20s:  it to be weekly. So it's a smaller population than it's scanning. There's only 12 there anyways.
2712.92s:  Nike. And I don't actually love that. We clear that. Let's see what these 12 were.
2721.88s:  Here. This is a good example. I don't know this from a hole in the wall. I'm just giving you
2736.12s:  an example. But this is a good example that if I look at this and I say, okay, well, it's been
2740.92s:  consolidating. It's been staying within a 15% range. It's now just starting to break out of this
2745.64s:  consolidation period. It did have a lower low. Let's just say it was super bullish again, again,
2751.08s:  just hypothetical. Well, do I favor buying or selling here? Well, it entirely premium, by the way,
2758.84s:  when I say buying or selling in this context, it depends entirely on what my thesis is for the move.
2766.60s:  If I look at this and I'm like, yeah, okay, based on my research and what I think is possible,
2771.88s:  maybe using prior reference moves like here, it consolidated for a while, started marching up
2776.76s:  and out. Maybe I'll give it another couple days because based on again, my breath of experience,
2781.88s:  learning, technical analysis and studying signals, then I'll take a look at, give it another day,
2787.00s:  see if it continues the rally. And if it does, then I favor a breakout move to the upside,
2791.72s:  potentially. Okay. Well, if I do that, then I would not want to sell puts. I would rather buy calls
2800.60s:  of some sort. Then I have to go through the rest of my trade process to see that it lines up.
2806.44s:  But this goes back to this. I cannot overemphasize this point enough. I think between these first two,
2814.92s:  this is probably the downfall of the overwhelming majority of traders. I genuinely,
2820.20s:  we feel comfortable saying that you guys know, hopefully, that I don't like giving bad statistics.
2824.92s:  I don't like saying numbers that aren't based on something. So this is, I'm postulating here.
2831.96s:  But I would feel pretty confident in that as a measure. Like I think that's probably pretty damn
2836.28s:  close, as my guess. So I'm going to take a pause on the first two, most option, most common
2844.68s:  option trader mistakes. Anything jump out at you here? Because there's something that jumps out at
2850.36s:  me compared to your answers from the beginning of the session. It shows me at the beginning of the
2857.56s:  session, most of you are here looking at individual strategy level decisions. We're talking about
2868.20s:  the ways that we manage individual trades. But from my perspective, I think this
2880.44s:  accounts for the vast majority of options traders that don't succeed.
2886.68s:  Because again, what I can tell you is that if you are good at finding specific profit mechanisms
2893.32s:  and you're good at measuring, creating signals, understanding the characteristics,
2898.76s:  your probability for failure becomes minute. As long as you maintain good overall trade hygiene,
2906.20s:  things like managing risk, as you guys point out, that's massive. You have to manage risk,
2910.20s:  have to manage risk. But you can manage risk perfectly and still fail.
2917.00s:  If we can't find things that are doing what we think it may or may not do,
2922.44s:  and then building stuff around it, first two steps. So your action steps here
2932.44s:  work in progress, but where we're at so far. First one is for the next, I realize that's right behind
2941.00s:  my head, sorry. First one here is for the next three months, you should create a monthly
2953.24s:  and weekly learning roadmap.
2974.28s:  That's your first action item. Now, I would highly encourage you, you don't have to do this,
2980.52s:  but I would highly encourage you to pop into the Discord and share.
2991.88s:  Share what you think you're going to focus on. We literally have a beginner's,
2996.76s:  we have an entire beginner's channel, and it's free for everybody that's in the free area.
3004.68s:  It's, everybody can access it. It's completely free. You can join.
3011.32s:  And then you can figure out if what you're focusing on makes sense. But guess what,
3015.24s:  even if you don't want to join the Discord and do that, I'm completely agnostic. I honestly don't
3019.88s:  carry their way. You can go to my website, because I literally built it for you. I literally give
3025.32s:  you a starting point. But the point is to start getting detailed. Re says not to sound defensive,
3033.88s:  but you ask an options question to the answer did involve options. No argument at all, though. Yeah,
3039.88s:  definitely that's the point, though, right? Is the whole point of asking it in the context of
3046.12s:  option traders is because option traders forget this shit because they're not thinking about it.
3053.08s:  That's exactly the purpose of that question is because option traders become too focused on
3061.48s:  options. And they put the cart so far in front of the horse that you can't even see the fucking cart.
3068.60s:  So yeah, completely agree with you. That Lauren says, what exactly do you mean by learning road map?
3074.04s:  You tell me, what do you think that that means? It's a great question, by the way. But I'm very
3077.48s:  curious what that means to you. And if anybody else has any ideas on what they think a learning
3082.92s:  road map might be, what feel free to chime in, I'm going to try my super cool back pillow thing.
3090.04s:  So far, the back's been pretty good, but I wonder how this Oh, Jesus, nope. That's like way too much.
3101.32s:  I don't like that. We're not there yet. I'd rather be skiing says a structured process to
3109.88s:  real and intended goal with the success to reach an intended goal with success potentially.
3115.96s:  The steps you take to learn a complex system. So Cedric is on it. So this is a road map.
3123.48s:  And then again, you can get this on the website. And then what I do actually is at the bottom,
3130.04s:  you can take a look at a more in depth syllabus. So what I do is I give you a starting point.
3138.28s:  Again, this is not the whole answer in my opinion. This is literally a starting point. And the reason
3142.92s:  why I give this as a starting areas because I do think you need to take the time and figure out
3150.28s:  what holes you need to plug, right? Because maybe you already understand compound interest.
3154.52s:  Okay, cool. Then you don't really have to spend a lot of time on that. But my guess is if you
3159.64s:  for the next three months decided, okay, month one, I'm going to start with module one. And again,
3166.20s:  I'm just using this as a framework. You can make your own. I'm not saying that this is the best
3169.88s:  solution out there. Comprehensive solution. This is a starting point. You could say, okay, my first
3176.52s:  goal for this month. And maybe I go faster. Maybe I can get through two modules in a month. It's
3181.08s:  up to you. Right. You can set whatever you want. But my recommendation is to set structure and hold
3186.60s:  yourself to the structure. So you should be able to look at something like this and have solutions
3194.04s:  for all of them mentally. Whether or not you want to take notes in a trading plan,
3198.60s:  entirely up to you, I do, but totally up to you. But like, for example, setting financial goals,
3204.20s:  I guarantee you, if I walked all of you through what I do, the people that are in the mentoring
3211.24s:  program on the Patreon, I guarantee you, if I walked all of you through that, you would have
3218.12s:  completely, completely insufficient financial goals, completely insufficient. And that's not
3225.80s:  to dig it anybody. But it's just because it's something that we don't think about. We just kind of
3231.48s:  start moving and we forget that we have to think about this. And some people, they're financial,
3238.12s:  they think they have financial goals. But then you ask them, what are the financial goals? Oh,
3243.40s:  I want to be financially free by the time I'm 40. Okay, cool. What does that mean?
3249.08s:  Well, I don't really know. It's just to have enough. Okay, cool. What's enough? How much is enough?
3254.20s:  Well, I don't need that much. Okay, well, that's what you're saying right now. What if you have a kid?
3260.84s:  What if you have another kid? What if you decide by the time you're 40, you want to enjoy life a
3265.96s:  little bit more and you don't want to eat ramen every day? Consider that. Right? So the point is,
3272.04s:  we as traders want to get so far ahead of ourselves down to this shit that we completely foresaic
3280.92s:  completing the basics of setting up an absolute rock solid foundation for what we were trying to do.
3291.00s:  So again, that's my guess is that if we went through this in depth, this idea of setting
3297.00s:  financial goals, my guess is just about every single person in here would have underdeveloped
3302.92s:  financial goals. And that's not a dig. Hopefully, it's a shot across the bow that it's something you
3309.24s:  probably need to think about. Probably because again, I've done a bunch of these mentoring sessions
3314.44s:  at this point and it is universal across everybody. So if that's the case, it's probably generally
3322.84s:  applicable to a much larger, larger sample. Same thing here, risk profiles and tolerance.
3331.32s:  Let's do a hypothetical for the chat. What's your risk tolerance?
3345.08s:  Just whatever that means to you, what is your risk tolerance?
3350.92s:  And I guarantee you, for those that answer, there's going to be a common theme. I already know
3355.32s:  there's going to be a common theme. Vladimir says, hi, he says 1% drawdown, Sam Cleman says extreme.
3367.56s:  Roy Titty says not good enough. Cedric says if I know the value of a company,
3372.68s:  Elon Song says medium, Reese says depends on conviction.
3376.12s:  So what do you guys notice about essentially all of these answers?
3386.36s:  Paul says 1% drawdown.
3392.52s:  I'd rather be seeing says a percentage of the portfolio based on risk reward of a trade.
3397.24s:  Cedric is on it. These aren't numbers. If we're talking about risk tolerance,
3402.20s:  whether we think about risk tolerance as a function of total portfolio risk, what you put on an
3410.20s:  individual trade again, it's an open ended question by design. But there were two people that even loosely
3417.32s:  defined it. And the other thing I can tell you is that for the people that save 1% drawdown
3421.72s:  of portfolio, that's essentially impossible to trade. Like if you think about a 1% drawdown on
3428.28s:  the portfolio, that's almost impossible to achieve even in the best returning assets. So for the
3435.80s:  people that quantify it, that's still insufficient because if we rationally think about 1% of the
3447.80s:  portfolio risk, we would be overutilized as soon as we do anything. So when I think about something
3457.56s:  risk tolerance, this is again why setting financial goals is so important. And why having this in order
3469.08s:  is essential? Because how are we going to go down here and worry about options if we don't even
3478.12s:  reconcile with ourselves the way we think about risk and what we're okay with?
3482.92s:  How does that make sense? It doesn't. And the reason why it doesn't is because most traders skip
3492.12s:  this entire process of building structure, building a solid foundation. Again, the leading mistake,
3501.72s:  I see options traders make. And again, I don't say this from a whole year than vow perspective.
3506.92s:  I did this exact fucking thing. We all do it. I didn't do this in the beginning. I didn't think to
3515.96s:  do this. I didn't know to do this. But now looking back at it, I realized that as I was trading things,
3524.36s:  when I had the largest percent drawdown on my portfolio, I can guarantee you it's because this,
3530.92s:  I did not strongly consider my risk tolerance and actually think through how I would feel in
3537.08s:  different risk on scenarios. So this is again, a generalized starting point that I think new
3549.56s:  options traders can leverage for themselves. This is not comprehensive, but I think this is a good
3555.08s:  starting point. Then we look at we have our roadmap, we know what we're doing now, we know what we're
3564.36s:  focusing on. So now what's our next action item? I gave you your first action item. The first
3571.72s:  action item is for the next three months, define what you're going to learn or focus on monthly
3580.20s:  and weekly. Again, I gave you a starting point. I literally gave you an example. You don't even
3584.44s:  have to make your own. You can make your own. I encourage you to, but I'm giving you something
3589.16s:  that you can start with. So then the next part of this is for every, every single thing you think
3604.04s:  you're going to trade. You start here.
3614.76s:  We need to create a trading plan in a trading log. In that trading plan, we're going to start by
3623.16s:  listing all profit mechanisms you can think of.
3636.20s:  And again, this is all free game. This is what I do with the people in the mentoring program.
3642.04s:  And the reason is because most people, if I ask them, talk about a profit mechanism.
3650.04s:  It's such a broad question that a newer trader doesn't even know how to define that for themselves.
3656.20s:  So I'll help you. What are some basic profit mechanisms you can think of? You guys start,
3662.60s:  you guys tell me first, and then I'll give you some ideas.
3665.80s:  I'd rather be skiing says, what do you mean by profit mechanism? It's a great question. What do you guys think?
3684.28s:  So for a rather be skiing, that video is for you.
3690.20s:  And let's see. Reese says shares. Joey says stock goes up.
3697.00s:  VRPP. Okay. Sedric says I look at undervalued company with the turning story and use options as leverage.
3703.24s:  Okay.
3705.56s:  Apollo says directional selling premium volatility. Vladimir off boot and says price movement.
3712.92s:  I'd rather be skiing says by low sell high. Reese says long call short puts.
3719.72s:  Seater says they did K.
3723.48s:  So what does this say here?
3731.48s:  Might be hard to see. So I'll read it out loud.
3736.52s:  What is the specific mechanism that makes money?
3744.20s:  What is the specific mechanism that makes money?
3749.56s:  So for example, Roaring Tittie says look for news catalyst. To me, that's a signal.
3771.88s:  Something that's providing some sort of news catalyst is a signal.
3775.64s:  So Roaring Tittie expand on what happens. So let's say Roaring Tittie that there's news that comes out
3785.88s:  and it provides a catalyst. Then what happens?
3791.40s:  The very important step in this process.
3794.28s:  Brad is on it, but I'm waiting specifically for Roaring Tittie.
3809.24s:  Check out the chart for volume. Nope.
3812.60s:  This is exactly why I want to work through this example. I want to make sure that this is
3816.76s:  crystal clear. So Roaring Tittie, we have news comes out that provides a catalyst.
3825.48s:  Then you check the chart for volume or whatever and you see volume expanding.
3830.44s:  So far, does any of that happening equal you've made money?
3839.80s:  I think we're going to do boneless wings tonight. Come on, I'm feeling some buffalo wild wings.
3844.68s:  Cedric says nope. Cedric would be correct.
3850.84s:  I'd rather be skeens is not really. That's also correct.
3854.12s:  Okay. And Roaring Tittie confirms. No. Okay, great. That's perfect.
3860.92s:  So now Roaring Tittie says, but you have to think through your trade before you do it, of course.
3867.72s:  Absolutely. Absolutely. What again, stay with me here.
3874.04s:  We're talking about profit mechanisms and defining profit mechanisms.
3879.48s:  So what I'm getting you to do is called a root cause analysis. So Roaring Tittie,
3887.40s:  keep following me here. You said news catalyst that then leads to volume, both completely fine.
3894.60s:  But we both agree that that doesn't actually equal profit yet. So then keep going. Walk me through
3903.00s:  what gets us to profit. And in the meantime, cheers. I got to take some aside of benefit.
3918.12s:  So in Roaring Tittie scenario, we have news. We have a catalyst. We have volume that's expanding.
3924.36s:  We have volume. We have faith in the titty. Let's take a look at this.
3939.00s:  Let's take a look at Nike. So Nike had a new CEO. That's news. Right. That's a catalyst.
3952.60s:  And then Roaring Tittie, to your point, we see volume going up. So there's your volume.
3960.20s:  The news itself doesn't make you money. Volume expanding doesn't make you money.
3966.84s:  So then what happened here that would actually make you money?
3974.76s:  It has something to do with the chart itself.
3981.96s:  And think about it. If you put in a dollar and the news breaks,
3991.00s:  does your dollar change? Doesn't. Roaring Tittie says support and resistance close.
3997.40s:  That's moving in the correct direction. The thing that makes you money is the stock moving.
4006.36s:  So let's use an alternate scenario. Let's say Nike announces a CEO. Let's say stock volume goes up,
4017.40s:  but it's highly constrained. Buyers and sellers are on top of one another. You have news.
4022.68s:  You have a catalyst. You have expanded volume. You might not actually make any money.
4028.52s:  Or you could have news. You could have catalyst. You could have an expense and volume. And it could go down.
4036.20s:  You could lose money. So what I'm trying to do
4043.48s:  is get all of you to think about the specific mechanism that leads to making money.
4052.12s:  And we'll go into a couple examples.
4053.48s:  Mel just got home so I had to make sure I let Thor run out and go run over to her.
4069.96s:  So first, let me take a pause there. Roaring Tittie.
4074.76s:  Does what I say makes sense? My guess is you're inherently thinking of that.
4078.84s:  Like I don't think I'm saying anything that's necessarily revolutionary.
4082.92s:  But hopefully the point that I'm driving home is the requirement to break things out and down
4090.60s:  into these requisite pieces. That's my goal. I'm hopeful that that's the point that you will take away.
4098.92s:  So when we think about a profit mechanism, it is how something functionally makes you money.
4108.44s:  So let's think about a few of them. We just covered one of them.
4114.12s:  So we have something that can have, let's do profit mechanism.
4123.32s:  First one, easy. Price direction up.
4129.32s:  Another one, price down.
4138.44s:  Another one, volatility up, down, the RP or relative.
4159.40s:  Roaring clitty says if something is trading sideways, you can make money selling options. You can.
4163.88s:  And the way that you do that is either through volatility or you can absolutely classify that
4169.72s:  if you would like. You can absolutely do. I'm value.
4175.08s:  Now your time value stuff will almost always have a volatility component, but you can absolutely
4180.04s:  break out something like theta decay.
4183.08s:  Cedric says yields. That's exactly correct. That's another very good one.
4188.76s:  This can be dividends.
4193.48s:  For anything. Stocks, ETFs, bonds, they have yields.
4200.04s:  So all of these are absolutely profit mechanisms. Now, Cedric says merger.
4209.08s:  Merger itself is not a profit mechanism.
4212.20s:  Because again, and this is why this point is so important is because mentally we conflate things.
4219.64s:  A merger can happen that doesn't do anything. The stock cannot move.
4229.00s:  That's not the actual mechanism. That's a signal. Same thing with roaring titty.
4239.32s:  If we think about signals, so literally just get rid of this and think of it this way. Profit.
4250.12s:  Mechanism.
4252.60s:  Signal.
4257.32s:  What you what you all are on to now.
4263.16s:  Captain Chris says, yo, I'm in public and everyone keeps hearing you say, titty. Yeah,
4267.00s:  man. Well, we have the titty in here. So I'm a say her name, loud and proud, so that everybody there
4274.44s:  around you knows that we have roaring titty in the house.
4279.48s:  It's actually essentially vital for our operation here to acknowledge titty.
4289.00s:  And I think everybody here has a strong affinity for titty as we should.
4298.76s:  So now, let's think about what, funny enough, titty. Let's think about what titty said.
4308.04s:  Share by back. So what what happens in a share by back?
4313.80s:  Typically, and as all Putin says, not all bybacks are created equal as chewy holders, which, yeah,
4319.96s:  that's uh, yeah, that's something in it. But it's fair. So anyways, let's talk about a share
4329.16s:  by back. Usually move price up. I'd rather be skiing is on this like white on rice now.
4336.28s:  So we see price move. That's what that means. So this is the process you have to follow.
4349.80s:  And again, I can tell that not everybody has it down still because like Cedric here,
4354.36s:  and there's not to pick on Cedric, we're all learning. But here's Cedric says it's a change in
4358.60s:  demand. It is a change in demand. But again, a change in demand is not a profit mechanism.
4365.72s:  A change in demand is simply a change in demand. Demand can go up. Demand can go down.
4372.60s:  And if we don't see anything, then price doesn't inherently have to move. Same thing with like
4379.32s:  a merger arbitrage. Price isn't dictated to move in a merger arbitrage.
4387.08s:  So the way I want you to think about profit mechanisms is hyper specific. I want you to think
4395.00s:  about what a trade does that actually makes you money. So let's take a look at some examples.
4405.88s:  And see if we can dial this in. Let's say, perfect. Let's say, Nike's here.
4425.00s:  Okay. And let's say, for a change of pace, I, Eric, for once, actually time the market successfully.
4442.04s:  I enjoy these hypotheticals. It's a chance that we can play fairy tale. So I can be whatever I want to
4448.76s:  be. And in this fairy tale, I want to pretend that I actually traded something with good timing.
4459.24s:  Really nice. So in this alternate universe that in no way mirrors reality, I chose to sell a put
4473.48s:  here on September 11th. So to put, then Nike goes on. So we fast forward. One, two, three, four,
4484.44s:  five, six, seven trading days, seven trading days forward.
4495.88s:  What's my profit mechanism here? Now, I don't want to be mean. So I'm already going to give you a hint.
4502.92s:  There's more than one. There's a primary and a secondary. I never give hints like this,
4510.84s:  but I really want the point to hit home. So I'm being a little too soft.
4515.32s:  Cedric says stock going up, IV change. Land says good timing. Rowan Clity says stock up,
4532.20s:  faded a K. Tommy says time decay. Underlying price moves away from the short strike.
4540.04s:  Joey is exactly correct. Joey has the most comprehensive answer.
4545.56s:  Joey says main is underlying movement. That's absolutely correct. So the primary profit factor here
4551.80s:  is going to be delta, the movement of the underlying completely correct. So the first profit mechanism
4558.36s:  is price movement up. The second profit mechanism is long theta and time is passed.
4568.68s:  The third profit mechanism, whether or not it happened, I'm not sure we could take a look,
4575.00s:  is if volatility changed. And in this case, volatility would have gone against us. So that
4584.36s:  wouldn't be a profit mechanism. And it doesn't surprise me. Let's use this as a great foundation for
4589.40s:  a hypothetical, not even a hypothetical practical question. Why is volatility expanding here?
4594.44s:  The stock price is going up. Normally, volatility contracts when stock price is going up.
4599.32s:  Look carefully at the chart because your answer is there.
4604.60s:  Why, oh, why is volatility? Brad says because the gap up with news, nope, that's not it.
4613.56s:  It's good news. So Joey says it went up more than expected, more volume. Nope, not at either.
4621.08s:  Can you guys, let me see if you can see it on the screen. Yeah, you guys can see it.
4626.92s:  I was concerned that it might have been hidden, but it's not.
4631.32s:  Rowan Clity says big move up and maybe also a larger range during the day. Nope, not at either.
4638.04s:  Re says sudden move. Nope, not at either. I'd rather be skiing says volatility increased with
4643.96s:  price movement. Nope. Rowan City says value profile. Nope.
4650.12s:  Ah, Rowan Clity.
4654.12s:  Rowan Clity gets a round of applause.
4660.28s:  So I need to find my little trophy for Rowan Clity.
4668.60s:  Fuck, Rowan City, you can get one, two anyways, because why not?
4674.44s:  But it was meant for Rowan Clity. You get plus fake plus one fake internet point.
4685.32s:  Rowan Clity says we're a team. It's chill. Yes, perfect. I guess you, it's yeah, you guys can share
4689.80s:  them too. This is the art of trading. It's learning how to decipher all kinds of market information.
4701.08s:  Now for a new trader, you probably wouldn't know that and that's okay. You're not supposed to know
4705.16s:  all of it upfront. You're not going to. But that's exactly why volatility was increasing is
4711.00s:  because we're getting closer to earnings. And again, as you surround yourself in options more,
4717.00s:  you will learn more things. And this is one of those things that we typically will see volatility,
4723.72s:  implied volatility expand leading into earnings starting about two weeks out.
4730.44s:  It's common behavior. I know it's going to happen more often than not.
4735.00s:  So, in fact, let's talk about profit mechanisms. Is there something there?
4744.68s:  Any ideas? What profit mechanism exists based on that phenomenon I just told you
4751.40s:  that I know implied volatility tends to expand about two weeks out leading into earnings.
4757.96s:  Longval, bingo. Reese is correct. 1% correct. So the way that we think about
4770.04s:  profit mechanisms is the specific thing, the specific thing that leads to making money.
4780.04s:  Now, what's the signal? Well, the signal in this case is knowing that earnings is coming up
4789.56s:  in a few weeks and volatility tends to expand into earnings. That's my signal.
4795.96s:  The profit mechanism itself is the movement of implied volatility.
4801.80s:  Roryntitty says longval, longvalu. Nope, it's long in this context, it's volatility. Most of the time
4807.56s:  when you hear people say vol, it refers to volatility. But sometimes it can mean volume,
4813.24s:  but that's less frequent. Normally, you'll see context dependent, but normally, you'll see it as
4817.96s:  volatility. Roryntitty says, if you take earnings out of the equation completely,
4823.48s:  would the gap up not increase vol? Not necessarily no. It doesn't mean that it would or wouldn't.
4830.12s:  We can't really tell because there's other things at play. So, prime time example, it gapped up
4834.92s:  here, right? But I can tell you that 30-day vol went from 27, 7, 9, 6, 3 to after the gap, it went to
4845.48s:  27, 6, 4. So, 30-day vol contracted. And then if I take a look at 7-day vol, it went from 25 to 23.
4855.24s:  So, this is an example of a gap up and vol went down. That's why it's not a discrete answer,
4861.80s:  right? And that's why I can tell you definitively that the behavior largely is going to be
4867.80s:  attributable to earnings. Does that mean that the gap up didn't have an effect or the news didn't
4871.80s:  have an effect? It absolutely could have. I can't decouple those entirely. But here's the other
4877.88s:  thing I can show you is that leading into this gap up, do you notice the slope of volatility? And
4885.00s:  again, it's these yellow lines. It's positive sloping. So, even before this news broke about Nike
4895.16s:  CEO being replaced, it already, even as it was going up, volatility was expanding. And again,
4901.72s:  from a practitioner standpoint, from experience, I know more often than not, if the underlying is
4910.52s:  going up, volatility tends to contract. It doesn't always, right? That's not an absolute,
4918.12s:  but it tends to contract. So, here, I see something that's going up, and I see volatility going up.
4927.32s:  That tells me something's up. Don't always know what right out of the gate, but something's going on.
4933.40s:  And in this case, I can clearly see a few things, but a big one of them is this earnings on the horizon.
4941.00s:  So,
4943.88s:  Cedric says I'm confused. What is difference between IV and volatility? There's no difference.
4949.96s:  They're different, different things related to the same thing.
4957.08s:  This video is for you.
4962.52s:  So, Cedric, that video is all about volatility. So, it's going to talk about
4969.32s:  all different kinds of volatility, implied historic forecast, realized, future realized,
4977.00s:  it'll break down, vol entirely. So, that's the video. I just shared there.
4986.52s:  Cedric says so it's a profit mechanism, right? Is what a profit mechanism be specific?
4993.80s:  IV.
5001.00s:  Is it? Again, be specific.
5007.40s:  What IV?
5011.64s:  Changes in IV. Cedric coming in for the all youp, or the assessed, correct.
5018.44s:  Changes in implied volatility certainly would be a profit mechanism.
5023.48s:  So, you'll notice here, in the profit mechanisms, I literally already had those written out for you,
5030.44s:  right? Volatility up down, relative volatility plays. This is not a comprehensive list.
5035.80s:  There's tons of things, relationships, correlations, tons of things.
5040.76s:  Now, the last thing though that I want to highlight on this idea of profit mechanisms and their
5046.20s:  corresponding assessment is that do you think all price up profit mechanisms are built the same?
5058.20s:  And we actually already did a preamble to this a little bit earlier. So, you will actually already
5064.68s:  know the answer. Rises, no, Cedric says no, I'd rather be skiing, says no, exactly. You guys are all
5070.76s:  spot on, correct. So then what does that mean? If all price up profit mechanisms are not built the same,
5085.24s:  what is that then tell me?
5092.84s:  Cedric says depending on the risk you take, not that's not wrong, but that's not what I'm leaning
5097.40s:  towards. It tells me very something very important about this step here. This next step.
5111.16s:  Rises, we have to tailor the one that fits best with the thesis, maybe.
5116.44s:  Zoom up one level. I think you all are down one level below where I want you to be.
5121.48s:  Joey says to choose your own adventure, that's not wrong.
5124.60s:  Rowing Titi, Cedric is on the right path. How clear this signal is, that's not correct,
5128.68s:  but it's the right path. Rowing Titi says depending on trading goal on what you pick, that's
5133.16s:  correct for sure, but zoom up one level for you as well. So if not all profit mechanism price up
5143.00s:  in this example are built the same, what does that tell me about this signal?
5150.52s:  Rises IDK what zoom up a level means. It means take your thought level from where you're at to
5159.00s:  a higher level thought. So kind of like a broader thought is the way to think about it.
5163.96s:  Depending on how the movement moves, now we're getting much closer, we're getting much,
5168.04s:  much closer. Lance is leading us in the correct. There we go. Joey is on it. Joey is on it,
5175.40s:  spot on. Joey says how to differentiate between different samples. That's exactly it.
5182.68s:  So what this means is if I'm thinking about price going up, what's one quality I can think of?
5194.84s:  I can think of something like positive drift.
5198.12s:  I can think of things like momentum. I can think of things like breakouts.
5215.16s:  I can subcategorize some of these into things like peed.
5222.36s:  Tommy, perfect. I can think of things like trend.
5228.44s:  I personally would classify those in momentum, but I think that that's completely fine.
5239.40s:  Roryn Clity says short squeeze. Absolutely. That's literally a fantastic one.
5244.20s:  So did you see my point here? So what I just gave you is homework. This is the next action step
5262.04s:  for you as a beginner, advanced, wherever level you're at. It doesn't matter. You still have to do
5269.88s:  this. So we need to open up a war doc started trading plan. We need to open up an excel sheet.
5278.92s:  And we need to create a trade log. And we need to start outlining all of these different
5285.48s:  profit mechanisms. And we need to start thinking about the subcategories of them so that we can
5294.44s:  assess signals. So here, the way that I'm going to look for positive drift is different than the
5304.20s:  way I'm going to look for momentum, which is different than the way I'm going to look for breakouts.
5309.96s:  Which is different than the way I'm going to look for post earnings announcement drift.
5314.20s:  But these are different signals or characteristics that qualify this mechanism. So then I need to tie
5326.60s:  signals to all of these different variations of the profit mechanism. This is a specific profit mechanism.
5335.96s:  Price direction up with positive drift price direction up via momentum price direction up via
5343.88s:  breakout to the upside. This is a defined profit mechanism. It's very specific. Because now I can say
5357.96s:  okay, I'm trying to look for things that are going up and I'm going to look between things that
5363.72s:  are exhibiting momentum or breakouts. How do I find things that move like this? That's where we
5370.76s:  start playing with signals. Maybe it's something that crosses above of 50 day moving average. Maybe it's
5378.12s:  something that's been consolidating for the past 10 days, but then it starts to break above the high
5383.32s:  of the consolidation period. Lots of different ways to go about it. And this again is trading.
5392.60s:  Guess what? We still haven't even talked about options. We've been going for what? 90 minutes.
5402.36s:  And in the three most common option trader mistakes, I haven't even touched options yet.
5413.24s:  Because you have to put first things first. It doesn't matter if you're an option trader, a trader,
5418.76s:  swing trader, day trader, value trader, whatever you are, this all has to happen.
5424.60s:  And then depending on how comprehensive of a trader you want to be, then it might be more or less.
5434.44s:  That's all there is to it.
5437.08s:  Tedrick says, I used to just look at value. This is so complex. Yeah. I mean, that's the beauty of
5442.12s:  trading. Because again, like while somebody like you might be a value investor while the market's
5446.20s:  going down, I'm making money. That's the difference. That's why there's so much work that goes into
5454.04s:  this is that the whole point of doing this kind of thing is so that you can build an approach that
5462.68s:  meets your objectives. I've had two negative years. My entire trading career, the worst year was
5470.04s:  down 4% in change. It was my second year trading. That was my worst down year.
5476.84s:  I don't have some sort of crazy impressive positive return. I have a good return.
5482.28s:  But I've built a system that moves me in the exact precise direction that I'm trying to go.
5491.48s:  So to Tedrick's point, if Tedrick enjoys doing something like
5496.60s:  value investing or whatever the approach is, it's totally cool. And if that works well for them,
5502.04s:  that's totally cool. It's like a very Warren Buffett-esque style. But again, I purposely compare my
5508.44s:  returns to the S&P 500. And then I have in my tracker Warren Buffett's returns as well.
5515.16s:  Specifically, Berkshire, we bucket it up to Warren Buffett, but it's not just him.
5520.92s:  But the point though is that I definitely out return Warren Buffett, and that's not better
5527.88s:  trader than him by any sense. He has scale that he's dealing with and yada, yada, yada. But I do
5534.04s:  have a better return than him. And I also have a better return variance than him.
5539.32s:  So the whole point here is to develop something that works for you long term.
5547.08s:  Roryntitty says this hurts my brain. I know. It's a lot. So then, oh, that'll probably hurt your
5551.88s:  brain by zooming it in. So then let's let's simplify it a little bit. We can start very, very simply.
5563.32s:  And then maybe this will make it a little more palatable.
5572.04s:  So I'm going to group these so that I don't completely lose them.
5576.44s:  Let's take a look at a hypothetical. So let's say, because Warren Titty is brave, and she said,
5588.28s:  this hurts my brain, which is completely fair. It's a lot of shit. So let's start from a very
5596.84s:  simple approach then, lack of structure. I'm a new trader. The first thing I'm going to focus on
5604.20s:  is the fundamentals of the markets. So for the first month of my learning experience,
5612.36s:  I'm going to focus on these. That's the first month. That's what I'm going to focus on.
5619.24s:  So talking about the outlier big four, don't even worry about it. It doesn't matter yet. I'm going
5625.64s:  to focus on just this. Then after the first month, or in conjunction with the first month,
5632.76s:  depending on your pace, I'm going to focus on this. Don't care about the outlier big four.
5638.68s:  It doesn't matter. I'm going to learn about the markets for the next month.
5643.40s:  Now, I'm going to start getting my house in order. And when I say my house, it's the proverbial
5650.44s:  trader's house, in having some organization to make sure I can track notes, track some ideas.
5659.08s:  That's the next thing I focus on. Then from here, I personally would gloss over these.
5669.72s:  Common trader, shortfalls, trader behavior, decision making. I would just gloss over these.
5676.04s:  Know that they exist. And again, you can pop on my website. It'll show you
5680.76s:  trader decision making, cognitive biases. You literally can just run through and say,
5685.40s:  OK, I at least know that these things exist. That's it. So these two here can take you moments, not long.
5695.08s:  Then we start getting into the actual components of trading. So now is when we add the next layer.
5703.72s:  So essentially, the first two, three months, doesn't even worry about this. Once we have a fundamental
5709.96s:  understanding of the markets is when we get into this. And I would start very simple. I know
5716.76s:  broadly that price gifs up. I know that. Okay, cool. What else do I, what else can I see in a chart?
5733.88s:  What else can I notice about the market as I just poke through it broadly? Well, another thing I notice
5743.32s:  is there's kind of clear relationships between different things. Don't won't know what they are
5749.16s:  in the beginning, but I know that there's these different kinds of relationships. And I also know
5755.80s:  that there are lots of different kinds of securities that will be based on my earlier lessons on
5761.80s:  the market writ large is when you'll learn that. I'll kind of poke through here and I'll say,
5766.04s:  OK, well, there's different sectors. The markets set up in these different ways. But I notice that price
5771.48s:  tends to go up. Price tends to go down. Price tends to go up. Price tends to go down. Tens to go up.
5777.88s:  So price moves. Okay. What are the some of the things that I can eyeball about these movements that
5786.04s:  might be interesting to me? I don't know yet, but I'm going to just take some ideas. So the first idea
5792.28s:  is again, I know price drifts up. This is literally called positive drift.
5800.36s:  And it's an equity premium.
5802.84s:  Then I just start looking at things and see what I can come up with. So the other thing I just
5819.24s:  identified with you is I can see price goes up and down.
5825.16s:  And from a trading perspective, I know that price will do the opposite of whatever I do at a given point in time
5835.32s:  and make me wrong. I also know that one. So price goes up and down. So literally what I'm doing right now is I'm starting this process right here.
5844.92s:  That's it. That's literally the first steps as a trader, roaring titty.
5854.92s:  This is it. So all of that other stuff I'm showing you gives you way more context on things to look at focus on so on and so forth.
5863.88s:  But this is where it starts. Then we get to learn about options. So the next step after having a general understanding of profit mechanisms, there's subsequent signals.
5877.32s:  Then we get to start playing with structures. And we get to learn about options. This is where we learn about options.
5887.72s:  This is where we learn options 101. This is where we learn options 201.
5895.40s:  Down here. All of this starts now in this.
5901.16s:  We're going to he says, but I've already began trading options can't unring the bell. You can't, but you can stop at any point.
5909.16s:  And then you can start where you should. And that's one of the that we all all of us traders have these exact trading scars.
5919.96s:  Because most of us do just start. It's about as is common as it is. It's what I did. It's what we all do.
5928.44s:  But you can absolutely pivot and just start doing the right things starting tomorrow. Exactly what I would do.
5940.36s:  So this is the next part of this process. Once you get down to outline fitting structures, you don't know what structures are.
5948.12s:  So now we have to learn options. This is where we learn options. Then we build strategies, optimization. That's all future state stuff.
5957.08s:  That's not stuff that beginners have to worry about too much. This is where we learn options.
5962.20s:  So now you might be asking, well, Eric, what's the third thing? We've gone through two things so far. What's the third thing?
5973.72s:  Any guesses what the third thing is?
5976.20s:  The third most common option trader mistake.
5989.64s:  We got to swap out our spin drift. The more we got plenty of mingle orange.
5994.60s:  Reese says no more guesses. Joey says ill fitting structure.
6004.60s:  Tommy says sounds like to be successful. The whole process has to be completed. I honestly wouldn't say
6010.76s:  that personally. Tommy just because there are freaks. There are people that cannot do any of this and do
6016.20s:  well. The way I look at it and I purposely would call that out because I would never want somebody to
6022.12s:  think that what I do is the only way. But what I can tell you is for somebody that's not super
6029.80s:  intelligent, going through this kind of process is really important. The other thing I would feel
6036.84s:  very confident in generalizing is that somebody who goes through this kind of process is probably
6044.44s:  light years more likely to be successful than somebody who doesn't. So I would feel really confident
6053.80s:  with that. Tommy says not looking at downside risk management, that's fair.
6065.08s:  I see saving. I think that that's good.
6073.80s:  I don't see the answer yet.
6083.72s:  Let's think about it.
6089.16s:  Practicing is really good. Now, if we think about where we would practice, probably somewhere in
6096.04s:  here, hopefully, at least that's where I would practice, let's think about it.
6101.08s:  Let's say that we have two traders. We have trader A and B. Sedrick says how are you going to
6107.72s:  capture the profit mechanism? Ah, that's step three over here. We hit that entirely during the big
6113.88s:  four trade process. That's the whole point of that. Brad is the closest.
6121.16s:  I think of the hypothetical. We have two traders. Both of these traders follow this process.
6134.04s:  What will differentiate these two traders from one another? They follow the same exact process.
6141.16s:  They go through these same steps. What will differentiate them?
6145.24s:  There we go. There we go.
6159.08s:  I'd rather be skiing is spot on psychology. It's literally you, you as the trader, you as the
6168.20s:  button clicker, you as the researcher, you as the risk manager, it is not taking the time
6177.88s:  to understand you as a human being, your tendencies, your weaknesses. We don't like looking at those.
6187.32s:  We don't like confronting our egos. All of us have one. Most of us spend very little time
6196.44s:  analyzing ourselves or our actions. For example, in B honest, it's an anonymous poll.
6207.96s:  But here's my question.
6226.44s:  My question is too long. I'll just add a word here.
6256.92s:  And then I have to spell you with a you.
6261.72s:  All right, there's your poll. Do you have a comprehensive trading log right now
6272.60s:  that breaks down every single one of your trades and your entire performance by strategy
6278.76s:  for the last 52 trading weeks?
6287.00s:  I see 13 votes and I see 73% no.
6298.92s:  I would even challenge the people that say yes. For the people that say yes,
6306.76s:  if you're willing, email it to me. Email it to me now. I won't say who sends it to me.
6313.16s:  I'll just look at it.
6322.28s:  Because my guess is it's probably not very comprehensive. That's my guess. I could be wrong.
6329.24s:  And I hope I'm wrong. That would be fantastic. But that's my guess.
6335.08s:  My guess is the 30% that have a trade log that analyzes their performance comprehensively.
6342.76s:  For the last 52 trading weeks. My guess is it's probably not quite comprehensive.
6355.48s:  I'd rather be skiing says I'm sure you're right because we may have a different idea about
6359.08s:  comprehensive. Potentially, we might have a different idea. But here's the way that I would reconcile
6366.84s:  that is I would ask you basic questions and see if the trade log can answer those questions.
6373.96s:  So that it's not a matter of nuance of oh, you need to have return on invested capital here.
6380.76s:  Like yeah, maybe it's useful. Maybe it's not. It's not that kind of thing that I would question.
6385.56s:  My my response is or the my sentiment is predicated on if I asked you something like
6395.24s:  which of your strategies performs best in a bullish market. Something very simple like that.
6401.88s:  Some people might be able to say might be able to say my guess is if I look at the trade log,
6408.68s:  what they say might not align with what's in the trade log. That's my first guess.
6413.80s:  The second guess I would imagine is that if I actually asked more important questions
6420.92s:  that we wouldn't be able to answer them. And again, it's not necessarily down by memory,
6427.24s:  right? Like that's the whole point of having a trade logs. You don't have to remember. But could we
6431.00s:  reference somewhere in your trade log by strategy for the last 52 weeks, the total number of trades
6437.96s:  that went on the number of winning trades average winner max winner lowest winner. Same thing for the
6444.92s:  loss side average number of wins per week average number of losses per week. Could we like extract
6453.64s:  data that could then inform our decision making meaningfully. My guess is even for the 27% that say
6462.04s:  yes, they're probably missing a lot of really important details. Again, I hope not. I genuinely hope
6468.52s:  but the reason why I mentioned this is because this goes into the faulty mindset.
6475.40s:  Because again, for the 73% of people, the other thing I think about is if I asked that 73%
6485.88s:  grouping. So if you answered no to this question, do you think a trade log would benefit you?
6495.72s:  Do you think having a record of all of your trades and kind of corresponding important details?
6505.32s:  Do you think that that would be beneficial? Yeah. So like everybody knows that this is good.
6513.56s:  Everybody knows that this is good. Yet we don't do it.
6518.36s:  We know it's good and we choose not to do it for lots of different reasons.
6529.88s:  I'd rather be skiing says it's the only way you can sometimes find what's broken so you can
6533.16s:  address it or fix it. Yeah, exactly. But then again, going back to I'd rather be skiing your
6540.36s:  earlier question of I've gotten lazy. So if you're telling me that you have this tool that you know
6546.44s:  can fix what you're doing, then why would you get lazy about it? That doesn't make sense. That
6550.92s:  doesn't jive. So what I'm highlighting here is this is a massive bucket that we all gloss
6565.32s:  right over. We're worried about what new regulation is coming out or what Senator is cheating
6573.16s:  based on their position and insider information. We're worried about bitching about the market
6578.28s:  makers and what we think they may or may not be doing. We're worried about a lot of shit.
6584.28s:  And what I find fascinating is as traders, we spend so very little time worrying about the very
6591.80s:  one thing we can control ourselves. The only thing you can control as a trader. And we
6602.12s:  skip right over it. So here are in my opinion the three most common option trader mistakes and
6617.80s:  action steps on how not to do it. I gave you the outline here for lack of structure to create your
6626.44s:  own structure. I gave you the way to start thinking about building profitable strategies that are
6635.96s:  centered on defined profit mechanisms and the ability to measure signals that help us find those
6646.44s:  profit mechanisms. The third and final thing that I'm showing you is that you have got to take time
6654.68s:  to start introspection. You have to look at yourself and you have to understand your tendencies.
6663.48s:  An easy way to start this is again literally go through my website and see what you think might
6672.20s:  align with you. We did this yesterday actually. Somebody asked what they asked what I think my
6680.36s:  largest cognitive biases are and we ran through it. So disposition effect. If you have a trade
6690.36s:  log, you can answer this. If you don't have a trade log, you literally can look at your brokerage
6695.00s:  statement. It's not going to be as informative, but I could still see it straight from a brokerage
6699.56s:  statement. No problem. That's one of the things that I do. Again, when I'm talking with people about
6703.88s:  this stuff, because what you'll notice is that I think I have one in here. Do I have one in here?
6717.40s:  Whoa, I have a giant blind spot. Hold on.
6720.84s:  I'm literally about to have to edit this. So this is now going to become 24 trader decision-making
6736.20s:  cognitive biases. As you look at this, actually, can you do you have an idea of what needs to be
6743.32s:  added here? And I'll zoom this out so that you can see most of them. So we can get past the
6751.80s:  disposition effect, high win rates, can't go broke, taking profits, Goldilocks, skill gap analysis.
6762.36s:  This is interesting.
6763.96s:  But there's a really important one that's missing.
6778.36s:  Yours was 15, no. Mine was a bunch of them. So I think for me, the ones I identified were
6789.40s:  anchoring hindsight, availability. I think those are the main ones.
6805.00s:  A recency. That was another one.
6811.64s:  Don't drink and trade. Maybe that actually could be a solid strategy. Maybe somebody would
6815.96s:  crush it with that as their approach. Nope, that's not it. It's a good guess, though.
6832.44s:  But not quite correct.
6834.28s:  I'm literally updating it so that you can see real time what it is.
6846.20s:  So, and I think that this one is probably really, really common, actually.
6869.32s:  Self accountability. I think that that's fair.
6878.76s:  I see. That says 12, 22, 23, 20, and 13. I mean, I imagine is probably most of these for most people.
6909.32s:  Tommy says, expert info by thinking your information sources are the best.
6914.04s:  I think lacking the ability to objectively evaluate a data source is really, really important.
6938.84s:  So, here is the updated version.
6949.80s:  And I don't think anybody guessed it. And it's kind of a slightly different version of what
6956.84s:  like the true definition is, but I think it applies here. So if I hit refresh, it should say 24 now.
6961.56s:  There it is. This one. So the one that I think is probably really, really common
6972.84s:  is when a person fails to objectively evaluate something. And there's a cognitive gap between
6981.56s:  their perception of reality and what reality actually is. So cognitive dissonance.
6987.24s:  So the idea behind cognitive dissonance, and I guess I can get rid of bias if that doesn't need to be there,
6994.28s:  is that we essentially fail to connect reality to what it is. And it's really easy to do this.
7002.36s:  It's really easy to do this.
7006.68s:  Off Putin says this is much more rigid and organized than I care to be. Yeah, it's, I don't like this either.
7012.60s:  It's work. Nobody wants this. But what I can tell you is that something like this is a primary driver
7022.92s:  of why I've been successful as a trader. Hopefully we'll continue to be. We never fully know.
7029.08s:  But I'd like to think that I'll be able to continue on the path. And it's because of taking
7035.80s:  the time to look at all this stuff. But most people don't like to look at this stuff because it's
7040.12s:  uncomfortable. It's a lot of work. It's not fun. But yeah, I totally feel you.
7046.60s:  Cool. So that's the main part of the session.
7054.28s:  Is you now have an understanding, at least from my perspective, the three most common
7059.32s:  option trader mistakes, you now know what they are, how to overcome them. And then you actually have
7065.96s:  a, you have an approach now on how you can work on them. I'd rather be skiing says,
7074.12s:  sent one log in journal. Yeah, I'll take a look. I'll literally look right now.
7083.64s:  Reese says when you go through trades, it seems easy. Of course it is. Yeah, of course it is. Because
7089.88s:  what happens, what happens with the trade? The trade is simply a culmination of an idea.
7105.40s:  All of the work to be a successful trader is done light years, light years before you ever
7115.00s:  click a button. And I say this openly and genuinely trading the actual process of trading is
7124.28s:  fucking easy. It's mindless. Because at that point, all of the work is done. All you do
7135.40s:  is apply everything else that's been done. But all of the work, literally all of the work
7145.32s:  is done before ever pressing a button. And this is, it's exactly why good trading is effortless.
7157.96s:  Good trading literally is effortless. But to get to that point is very difficult.
7165.88s:  Okay, so for I'd rather be skiing. One of the first questions I have for you is what was your maximum portfolio risk?
7186.04s:  So let's say on, it looks like you're mostly looking at shares, which is totally cool.
7191.64s:  And I see that you have total risk as a dollar amount. What's your total portfolio risk?
7199.40s:  Like let's say, all equity trades and I trade 2% of allocated capital per trade max. Yep. So
7211.96s:  then, so for example, though, my point is is when I look at this, well, one, it doesn't look like
7220.04s:  you do that because you're holding equity. So you actually, you can't risk 2% of capital max per trade
7230.36s:  if you're holding equity. Why is that? Why do I say that? So if you tell me you risk 2%
7238.12s:  max per trade and I'm telling you if you're holding equity, you're not doing that. Why is that?
7246.36s:  That's not it. And also a giant shout out to I'd rather be skiing for being brave and sending this in.
7255.32s:  So first thing I'm going to do is look, I'd rather be skiing up with three fake internet points.
7266.84s:  Because he's the only person that took me up on that. And that's not easy to do. They have somebody
7271.96s:  look at your stuff and give you feedback. It's very vulnerable. So straight up, straight up props to you.
7280.36s:  So now, but why is that? Well, let's take a look at an example. I'm going to save this and then I
7290.36s:  think we can probably close this for now. Cedric says, if you're trading equity, it's harder to
7299.56s:  manage your risk. No, not not harder necessarily. But there is a dynamic aspect to it. So I don't want to
7311.64s:  I'd rather be skiing. I'm not going to dox your trades and stuff. I'm just going to pick an
7315.88s:  example though of something here. I'd rather be skiing says I used position sizing was 2% loss
7325.56s:  tradable capital. So not 2% of all capital is much smaller than that. Yeah, that's okay too.
7330.04s:  That's not so much my point though. My point is, is why does that not matter? Because you're risking
7335.48s:  more than that. So let's say you like Nike and you buy Nike here and you're going to risk 2%
7345.40s:  of your capital on Nike. Right? So we're going to do 2% of our capital on Nike here. Well, what
7354.20s:  happened? Something very specific happened here that does not care about what we defined as our
7371.00s:  risk. You gap down. There's nothing to be done here. So you got in just proverbial again, I'm not
7380.92s:  doxing it. I don't even think this is on your list. I'm just picking a random ticker. But we're
7385.56s:  defining it as 2%. But it gaped out. We have more than 2% risk on. If we use a stop, it doesn't
7398.44s:  matter because this blows by your stop because it's a gap down. There's no controlling this.
7405.64s:  So now, again, let's play the proverbial. When I ask how much portfolio risk is on at a given point
7412.84s:  in time, then we obviously can have what our perceived risk is. And I think it's completely fair
7422.04s:  to use the stops. Right? Royne Clity says, what if only 2% of your capital is in the stock? There you
7429.24s:  go. Literally the exact point I'm driving towards is I think it's completely reasonable to use what
7437.80s:  you anticipate getting stopped at because here's the other thing. Let's be realistic. We can't make
7446.20s:  trading rules based on stuff like this. Right? Because this happens. So then how do we actually
7453.96s:  define the total risk of a portfolio at a given point in time if we're trading something like
7458.68s:  an equity or an option that you can't get out or even a future that there's periods of time
7463.48s:  that you technically can't get out or don't have offsetting positions is by the size of the position.
7469.00s:  But then the total portfolio risk is still different. So I measure a few different things,
7475.72s:  but one of them is absolutely I use the most severe day overnight day drawdown and I just leave it
7483.00s:  in the sheet as a as a reference. So like for example, what we can do is we can say, all right,
7490.84s:  let's say for the individual stocks that I'm trading, let's say I'm trading Nike, I'll go back
7496.84s:  and I'll say like what's the worst overnight move that I've seen and this is if I trade something a
7501.48s:  lot, I wouldn't necessarily go through all this hassle if it's something that you know like I just
7506.44s:  anticipate trading once, but from an options trading perspective, you tend to do the same stuff
7513.08s:  over and over again, like in the same name, excuse me, there's not that many. So I develop a footprint
7517.40s:  for all of them. So what I'll do is I'll say, okay, over the last 10 years, what is the biggest
7524.20s:  overnight gap the stock had that I'm trading? Now I at least have a reference. Again, it could be
7530.92s:  more than that that the worst days typically are ahead of us. So maybe I can buffer a little bit,
7537.16s:  add a little bit more, but I at least have an idea of the total portfolio risk. And again,
7541.96s:  I personally wouldn't use that as my planning factor, but I would absolutely want to know that
7547.72s:  in my trade log. Because again, what is a terrible scenario is if we don't even think about that,
7554.76s:  and for whatever reason, there's a giant global macroeconomic event that causes
7560.12s:  just widespread market panic. And then we have 15 trades on that are sized on a presumed 2% max risk,
7569.88s:  but they all somehow again, highly unlikely, but let's say not even all of them. Let's say 80% of
7576.20s:  them gap down 10%. That's not that crazy to assume. That can become a massive problem. If our entire
7584.36s:  planning factor is on a 2% that we think we're going to control with a stop or with an exit or whatever.
7589.96s:  That's something that I think belongs in a trade log. And again, you don't have to go through that
7595.08s:  process with every single ticker. You can figure out what's the worst that you've seen. And it
7600.68s:  doesn't even mean that it needs to govern what you choose to put on, but it should be known.
7608.84s:  That's an important part as a trader is just objectively looking at information as long as it's
7614.76s:  known and understood. And that's okay. Because again, I don't plan like that myself.
7621.32s:  I do not plan all of my trades based on the worst overnight move it's ever had in its entire
7626.52s:  history. I don't do that, but I'm aware of it. So that as I'm sizing things, if I'm coming into a
7633.32s:  market period that for whatever reason I perceive as slightly more volatile or whatever's going on,
7638.28s:  maybe I'm a little more conservative with where I choose to manage or process my total portfolio
7644.68s:  risk just because of that context. Now, what I'm highlighting here that I want to be very,
7650.60s:  very specific. This is like the most nuanced little branch you can start going out on as a trader.
7659.32s:  But the reason why you should at least be aware of this nuanced little branch is because the
7665.16s:  probability of this branch snapping and you falling is very low. It's very, very low. The
7671.48s:  probability of having 30 positions on your portfolio opening up in 20 of them are down by 10%
7676.60s:  on a gap down. It is so low. It's not zero. So let's say that you think you're putting money into
7684.68s:  your trading account and you're like, I don't need this five years. I'm okay. And you go through
7688.92s:  that experience because you're aware of it. Then you can come out just fine. It's not necessarily
7693.32s:  the worst thing ever. But let's say that you're trying to save up for a down payment on a house
7697.56s:  and maybe you want your money in like three years. Then you open up your platform and you see
7702.44s:  that happen. I guarantee you your decision making capability is completely fucked. It is going to be
7709.48s:  entirely compromised because you little just gotten punched straight in the forehead from something
7714.84s:  you didn't see. And now you're trying to process the fact that your down payment is now gone because
7721.40s:  of this drawdown that you didn't see happening. So again, very, very niche nuanced super low
7727.72s:  probability event, not what I would use as a planning factor, but it should be something that
7733.40s:  you should be aware of at least. That's what I think about here. So yeah, just a couple ideas
7740.84s:  on that. Now, I mean, my dinner's not here yet. So I'm happy to keep going. We can dive into
7749.72s:  really anything that you guys want to hit. I have a generally open agenda until my B-dubs gets here.
7757.08s:  I'm actually pretty stoked for some wings. Not going to lie. Anything that you guys want to talk about?
7766.92s:  And then I'll get caught up on the chat.
7768.68s:  Brad says I left a comment on the other video, but are you able to check out the unity calls today?
7783.32s:  Several five K buys for 8 million premium paired with swaps, GME a lot.
7792.12s:  How do we know that they're paired with GME? Just out of curiosity.
7798.68s:  I'm appreciating the Bloom's taxonomy for learning objectives. What does that mean? I don't know what
7808.12s:  Bloom's taxonomy is. What does that mean? I looked this up. Am I going to be, do I not want to look
7818.04s:  this up? Brad says swaps are public data. No, I'm fully aware that the swaps are public data.
7824.60s:  I'm specifically asking about the relationship with GME.
7830.28s:  The pairing. What is this?
7841.00s:  Whoa, I literally have never heard of this. This looks old too. I can see older graphics for it.
7848.44s:  What is this?
7854.12s:  The original.
7859.32s:  How many for two taxonomy created by Bloom in 56? Yeah, it looked old. Just the stuff.
7865.88s:  As you travel up the pyramid, the level of complexity increases. Yeah, I love that.
7869.80s:  The framework is important for designing learning experience because it helped the instructor
7873.24s:  identify, classify outline what they're expected to learn. I love this. Yo, this is cool as shit.
7879.72s:  Yo, who showed me this? They swag. Thank you very much. Thank you. I've literally
7888.12s:  have never heard of this. This is so cool. This is so cool.
7897.24s:  Remembering understanding, applying, analyzing, and value. This is so cool. This is great.
7904.20s:  Oh my God. I got to look at I got to I got to do something with this.
7909.72s:  This is so cool because this is like this is exactly what trading is.
7919.88s:  Oh, I love this. Dude, thank you so much. Yeah, they swag.
7925.40s:  We got to hook you up. We're going to give you plus four fake internet points and then a dab
7938.04s:  because that is super, super cool.
7947.48s:  Very cool. Thank you so much for this. I love this. You have like, I don't know if it comes
7952.20s:  like I love learning new shit and this is like a really cool one to me.
7957.00s:  And I think that this kind of framework is such a great reference for people.
7960.68s:  Like when you're learning about something like options, like this is something I should be
7965.00s:  integrating and I'm I apologize for being ignorant to this because this is like such a great
7972.52s:  way to frame a lot of these things that new option traders are trying to learn that like I
7978.76s:  literally never knew existed in this format, which is such a perfect format.
7984.76s:  Like understanding, be able to like reiterate something you've heard, understanding the basic
7990.04s:  concepts, knowing how they work, understanding how to tie them together, then being able to come up
7996.12s:  with some sort of perceived information from the things tied together and then innovating.
8002.04s:  Like I literally love this. This is so sick. Giant, giant fan. Thank you very much.
8008.68s:  Big fan. I'm going to find a way to start integrating blooms,
8012.92s:  taxonomy more because that is I think that's like a really good reference for people to think
8018.52s:  about like what they should be focusing on. Yeah, that's so sick.
8026.36s:  I'd rather be skiing says I never saw that before either. Yeah, literally I've never heard of
8030.20s:  that. And that's so cool. Like literally literally so cool. Big fan.
8038.28s:  All right, back up towards the top, though, because I think there's a couple others.
8046.76s:  Reese says I'm at whatever stage in the journey where I'm questioning why I own shares at all
8051.00s:  besides the fact that they don't expire when I could express my disposition through options,
8054.52s:  which are cumbersome. Yeah, well, I think that that's you kind of outline it, right? Like when you
8058.84s:  trade options, you add complexity to what you're doing. So unless there's a reason to add the complexity,
8065.00s:  then that's how I personally would arrive at the answer of is the option the correct vehicle.
8071.72s:  But again, going back to the original principles, we first need to define and have a profit
8079.72s:  mechanism that's in mind. And then depending on that, we can determine, you know, what makes the
8084.68s:  most sense if it's something like using options because we want leverage or because we want
8091.24s:  exposure to volatility or because we want something that collects theta, like those are common
8096.44s:  reasons to trade options. Equities themselves are just much simpler products. So I think that's
8103.24s:  essentially the way that I would navigate through when it makes sense to hold equity versus options.
8109.16s:  I think that's completely fair. Paul says, do you think DJT could have a short squeeze?
8118.68s:  Well, let's see. We need this.
8123.88s:  It doesn't look like it right now. It's only shorted 11% days to cover is super short,
8145.16s:  less than like four days. Yeah. So could it happen? Sure. Like things definitely could go down.
8152.44s:  But that doesn't look like something I would consider a candidate. So there's I think I have a video
8160.20s:  on squeeze. The this one's more about I don't know what this one's about. Maybe that one has
8171.56s:  something that's useful in there. I don't really know. But yeah, I don't to me like as I look at this
8178.44s:  now, it doesn't look like it's something I would expect a short squeeze in personally.
8191.48s:  And then I think there was a couple other questions up at the top.
8196.12s:  Off-Poon says, have you ever considered doing an AMA on Reddit about trading options?
8200.60s:  Not really. I mean, I would be happy to that the AMA thing, I don't know, I guess it's fine.
8206.36s:  Like I love answering questions and I love talking with people. I feel like
8211.00s:  especially well, it depends on like where on Reddit to because I just imagine the like people
8217.56s:  on Reddit would probably take it as like somebody that just wants to talk about themselves,
8221.40s:  which obviously wouldn't be my intention. But I mean, I would be down. But yeah, it's not something
8227.56s:  I had set up before. The way I would think about that is like if for whatever reason there was
8232.52s:  interest for sure. But I don't really view myself as that interesting. So I wouldn't do something
8239.16s:  white as like a bout Eric. So yeah, if it's helpful, I obviously would be happy to. But
8247.16s:  it's not something that I've like really thought about.
8252.12s:  Uh, uh, okay.
8257.32s:  Paul says more generally, how do you say the odds of a short squeeze? Okay, cool. Great question
8262.20s:  so when looking at something like a short squeeze, there are a few things that are primary drivers.
8270.44s:  Actually, that video that I sent you is, is that because um, yeah. So the way that I look at it.
8281.72s:  Short squeezes become more probable in a few scenarios. High short interest. So like greater than
8288.52s:  20% I think. And then large days to cover those are the two main things I would look at personally.
8297.00s:  And then exactly to off Putin's point, um, there's definitely squeezes that are driven by things like
8309.24s:  gamma. That's super comment. Well, not super common, but an relative in the world of squeezes.
8315.24s:  That's a common cause for squeezes. So yeah, there's different origins of a squeeze. Short
8320.12s:  squeeze are very, very specific. As are things like gamma squeezes. But for short squeeze, I would
8324.92s:  look at short interest greater than 20% and then days to cover definitely greater than four days at
8329.72s:  the very, very least probably like six plus. That starts to become like really, um, yeah, really
8337.00s:  appropriate. I think and again, it can still be tamped down really fast. It doesn't inherently happen.
8343.00s:  But I would say that those objectively would raise the conditions.
8348.20s:  Vladimir off Putin says I asked because so many have questions. Yeah, I think and I agree with you.
8355.48s:  And I think that the problem is a lot of like new options traders I find when I interact with them
8361.08s:  because I'll post on the options read it once in a while. But I noticed that a lot of new options
8367.08s:  traders are just option traders in general. I think that they don't even know how far off the mark
8374.28s:  that they are that I notice I have a hard time connecting with the people on like the options
8381.48s:  read it because so many of them are at like such a basic level. And a lot of them think there's
8390.28s:  so much further than they are that like trying to talk to somebody like, for example,
8397.00s:  if I made a post actually, I think I did make a post about this. Let me see. I'm just curious now
8401.88s:  because I think I made a post about profit mechanisms at one point on the options read it.
8409.48s:  Well, let me see. Yeah, here we go. Literally perfect.
8415.40s:  And this is like this is exactly why I think Reddit is a is a tricky place to operate
8426.04s:  because you can see like I made a post about
8430.92s:  creating like focusing on profit mechanisms and you can see like literally it got downvoted
8435.96s:  into oblivion. So I think the the thing is with people on Reddit, they're at like such a different
8444.36s:  level when it comes to options. It's so elementary that I think the way that I do things is probably
8451.88s:  not even relatable to them. That's what I think because and I still go on Reddit to interact
8457.96s:  because I do know that there are people on there that are trying to figure this stuff out like they're
8461.96s:  trying to they're trying. And I know that a lot of people will go there and you know try to get
8468.92s:  some information. So I do try to post there once in a while again to just try to help new traders.
8476.12s:  But the the stuff that's celebrated there is the stuff that I actually think it just sets traders
8482.60s:  up like it's there was a post not too long ago that I saw that somebody had like a straight
8488.04s:  winning week or whatever. And like the Reddit exploded about that like they really really love that
8493.08s:  which is cool. I think it's really cool to celebrate each other's victories. But to me the fact
8501.96s:  that people find that cool is so troublesome. And I think that explaining that to somebody would
8511.88s:  come across as me like trying to tear down somebody else, you know, who's doing well, which is
8518.04s:  clearly not my fucking objective at all. But people are like really sensitive and they're very
8527.64s:  superficial I find on there. So I try to share like straight up information as best as I can.
8534.44s:  And I'll share a little bit about like my path and my journey because I do think that that's
8539.72s:  probably helpful for people to hear because it is helpful to see somebody that's again like not
8545.96s:  supremely educated kind of just a basic average dude that has been able to figure some of this out.
8553.48s:  Right. So I know that there's some value there. But yeah, maybe we can set up like an AMA. I don't
8559.88s:  even know really how to do an AMA. I've never done one. So but maybe we can set one up on like a
8565.16s:  live stream or something. I don't know if that's easier. Is it better to do them on like a written
8570.60s:  platform? I literally have never done it. But I would I would be down to I would be down. I just
8579.48s:  don't know how to do it. The doing it on like a YouTube live is easy, but I don't know if that's
8585.08s:  the right format for how people would want to do it. Yeah. Ricky says I feel like all your
8592.60s:  live streams are basically AMAs. Yeah. And I try to be like really open to questions. So then
8598.68s:  and that's I'm glad to hear that because that's one of the big objectives. I think maybe
8603.24s:  structuring something that's I don't know. I don't know if it's better to be more meta or less meta
8609.72s:  because on the live streams and stuff, we actually spend very little time talking about like
8617.32s:  governance, meaning how how I even started doing all this stuff. How I did this was like on active
8624.44s:  duty in the Marine Corps, the full-time job deploying like all those kinds of things are just not
8629.72s:  really spent on because I generally don't care that much to talk about myself. But that would be like
8636.28s:  more meta and then there's like sub meta stuff that would be like very, very specific with respect
8642.12s:  to approach. And those I feel like would be easy because I those we do all the time, right? Like
8649.56s:  talking very specifically about approach. And that's mostly with a lot of the videos are as well.
8657.24s:  So I'll think about it. Like one of the one of the ways we could do it if it would be useful is
8663.56s:  I could set up like a Google form and see if people prefer to like submit stuff that way so that if
8669.48s:  people like to like write out something. So I also know on YouTube live, you're limited by the
8675.48s:  number of characters. It's like super succinct. So we could do something like that like a Google
8679.64s:  form and then obviously we can have more questions or whatever during the during the live session.
8686.44s:  If if people are interested, I'm down again, I haven't really thought about it because I don't
8691.16s:  find myself that interesting to that degree. But happy to if it would be helpful.
8696.68s:  Sedric says, did you start with trading or investing investing for sure? I started I started with
8703.16s:  buying a few a few shares of companies that I saw and I did that for like a few months and then
8710.68s:  I immediately started pivoting to options. So yeah. And then Ricky says, what practice were you
8719.00s:  into Lloyd auditor at KPMG for a minute and it sucked sounds like yeah, I was in consulting.
8724.92s:  So auditor sounds terrible. There's nothing to me that sounds even remotely interesting
8732.68s:  about auditing. Hey, swag says, although our bank accounts have different dollars,
8737.16s:  there's still something extremely relatable to you. Yeah, well, it's because I probably bet whatever
8741.88s:  your bank account was, I probably had it and probably worse. I don't know, maybe yours is like
8747.88s:  really, really bad. But I mean, I've definitely have had zero dollars in mind before. So yeah, that is
8754.84s:  that is right up. So yeah, let me think about that. I'll actually work on setting up like a
8762.60s:  Google form and then we can set up like a AMA session. I probably would do it on a YouTube
8767.80s:  live stream because I honestly much prefer these and I'd rather talk to you all. It's way better
8773.40s:  than like responding to fucking Reddit posts, I think. But I can collect like different questions
8779.96s:  and stuff there and see and kind of integrate them. So yeah, let's take a look at that.
8786.28s:  All right, gang, super fun. I hope the session was useful. I hope that those common mistakes
8791.24s:  make sense. I hope that you have a pretty clear roadmap on how I would go about doing things.
8796.84s:  And then as I said, I entirely encourage you to pop in the discord, go into the beginner's
8802.60s:  section because there's one there built for you. And you can share what you're working on with
8807.08s:  each other. I obviously will do my best to jump in for the Patreon folks. We have a specific room
8812.44s:  that I obviously will do my best to prioritize called the learning lab so that if somebody has
8817.64s:  like a roadmap, they built I can give you feedback. But the goal is to share the things that I really
8823.48s:  think are transformative for me and hopefully can make a difference in somebody else's trading
8828.84s:  career and approach because what I can tell you unequivocally is trading is not easy to start.
8837.64s:  But once you build the skill set, it's it genuinely is tremendously simple. And it is one of the very
8846.28s:  few things you can do that there are no clients, there are no meetings, there are no customers,
8853.64s:  there are no partners, there are no bosses. It is truly one of the few things you can do in this
8861.72s:  world that is as solo of an endeavor as you can think of in all of the positives that go with that.
8870.28s:  Because even if you start a business, you're still responsible to people. You still have to
8876.52s:  you know pay roles, you still have to make sure that your customers are happy. That is
8882.60s:  really, really challenging for people. And trading is completely different. Trading doesn't have
8889.24s:  any of that. Trading is just you. So whatever you're able to do is dependent on you,
8898.04s:  tons of autonomy. But there's also drawbacks to that. A lot of people struggle to handle that
8904.12s:  amount of autonomy, which again, that's one of the reasons why we have our community, the outlier
8907.88s:  community is to help support one another and that into add some structure. So that's the idea.
8914.20s:  That's why I think it's worth your while. And even if you trade and realize that trading is not for
8918.04s:  you, you will be better off as a human being by at least going through the process of attempting to
8923.00s:  trade understanding risk better, understanding yourself better. It's a win. The main thing is just
8927.80s:  don't lose all your fucking money. And then it's a win. I'll see you guys on the GME live stream tomorrow.
8934.12s:  At 5 p.m. Pacific time. And then yeah, I'll give you a Google form,
8938.04s:  Gendop. And then we can set up some sort of AMA, which hopefully will be a good time. I would
8943.96s:  definitely enjoy interacting and sharing anything that's useful. So that'll be fun.
8949.08s:  All right, gang. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
