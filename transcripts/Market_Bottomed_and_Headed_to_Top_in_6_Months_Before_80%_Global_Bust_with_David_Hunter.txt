2.52s: what's up everybody Eric here and I am
5.58s: back with David Hunter I was just
7.80s: chatting with him real quick before we
9.18s: started this is the fourth time he and I
11.28s: are meeting and it's actually really
13.80s: useful at least from my perspective
15.54s: because I get to understand his thought
17.76s: process then as we get new data how that
20.70s: impacts his thought process because
22.92s: really you're teaching us different ways
25.32s: to think about markets and the economy
27.18s: and I think that that's just
28.40s: tremendously valuable so first off
30.54s: welcome back great to have you
32.28s: yeah thanks Eric glad to be back
35.34s: yeah and since the last time we spoke
37.98s: there's been no shortage of drama in the
41.46s: economy and the market so I'm really
43.80s: eager to get into you know how you think
46.20s: things are rolling out and what you're
48.18s: looking at so I figure we could start a
51.48s: little bit about
53.34s: um the broader markets last time we
55.26s: spoke again is about three months ago we
57.30s: were talking about this idea of
58.44s: recession and I had asked you if you
61.02s: thought we were in a recession at that
62.52s: point you said you thought so if not
65.10s: right on the precipice of entering one
67.08s: and I'm curious how have your thoughts
70.32s: evolved around that concept what are
72.06s: your thoughts on our position in
74.10s: relation to a recession
75.72s: yeah for sure since I I think we we
78.54s: spoke in June so so after after that
82.74s: last conversation uh we obviously got
85.80s: second quarter GDP in you know later in
89.28s: July
90.72s: um and it confirmed that we had two
92.64s: quarters of negative GDP which by you
96.12s: know traditional definition that's a
97.74s: recession
99.30s: um you know there's lots of ways to kind
101.28s: of look at what is you know whether it's
103.02s: a recession or not but I think for sure
105.18s: the economy is weak I think technically
108.00s: we're in recession I think more than
109.62s: technically you know the economy was
111.84s: showing negative GDP
114.72s: um third quarter we bounced a bit not a
117.66s: lot but you know a little bit so you
120.36s: know you can argue that we
122.46s: um may have stopped the negative but I
124.86s: think we're heading for much deeper
126.48s: weakness and so you know you're gonna in
131.16s: recessions you're gonna go in and out of
132.84s: GDP positive GDP negative GDP until you
136.80s: really get into the the depth of the
138.72s: recession
140.16s: um so you know my my view which has not
142.44s: changed is that we're on our way to a
144.48s: global bust I Define a global bust
147.12s: actually a global deflationary bus I
149.70s: Define that as something bigger than a
151.74s: recession uh but not as long as a
154.68s: depression it might have some of the the
157.08s: characteristics of a depression but
158.70s: happen in kind of a concentrated period
161.04s: of time like a year so I think you know
163.86s: 2008-9
165.72s: was almost a bust but they saved it
168.60s: before it really got into that so I
171.12s: think this time we see something worse
173.16s: than 20089 which would make it the worst
175.68s: since the Great Depression
178.08s: um and I think it'll be accompanied by a
180.60s: financial crisis the likes of which we
184.02s: have not seen so bigger than 2008 nine
187.86s: um and that means you know bank failures
190.26s: a lot of uh
192.54s: um involuntary debt liquidation
195.72s: um you know lots lots of unpleasant
197.52s: things I think that's likely second half
201.30s: of 2023
204.84s: um you know I I don't you never know
207.54s: exactly when because we're we're a
210.06s: recession into a global bus isn't two
212.76s: different things it's just it takes a
214.50s: while for you to move into the real
215.82s: depths of it
217.62s: um to where you get to the point where
219.18s: the financial
220.16s: crisis gets big enough where it causes a
223.56s: bust
224.58s: um so like I said we haven't seen one in
226.74s: post-world War II era we came close in
228.60s: 2008 nine I think this is going to
231.00s: surprise people in terms of the
232.80s: magnitude but before we get there you
236.58s: know you're you're going to be kind of
238.44s: going through this period of up and down
240.24s: are we in a recession we're getting off
241.86s: a soft Landing are we going to have a
243.36s: hard Landing ultimately I think we're
245.52s: gonna have a hard Landing
248.04s: well that actually leads beautifully
250.50s: into my next question which is last time
252.54s: we talked about exactly that the
254.52s: concepts of soft landing hard landing
256.74s: and the way that markets have been
259.08s: moving in relation to which one of those
261.96s: is more likely last time you also felt
264.72s: that we were more likely leaning towards
266.82s: a hard Landing it sounds like that's
268.26s: about the same
269.88s: um has there been any additional data
272.10s: input that has reinforced that
273.90s: hypothesis or is it essentially just
276.42s: ceteris paribus nothing has really
277.92s: changed same same
279.78s: probably the thing that has uh just
283.38s: increased my the probabilities of a hard
285.36s: landing and increased probabilities of a
287.22s: global bust is the feds in transit
290.96s: transitions in terms of
293.94s: um rate hikes and feeling like they have
296.82s: to go a lot farther
298.98s: um as I keep saying on Twitter I believe
302.78s: the fed the current fed is making
306.90s: perhaps the largest policy error in
310.56s: history
311.70s: certainly in the history of the fed and
314.90s: what that means is I think they are over
317.46s: tightening we've seen uh rate increases
321.18s: at a speed that is beyond there's no
325.44s: precedent for the speed with which rates
327.60s: have gone up and you know the FED
330.78s: doesn't think their work is done they
332.58s: keep talking about another 75 and maybe
334.98s: another 75 uh in November December and
339.60s: then maybe you know pause there or maybe
342.36s: you know do some more hikes in 2023
345.02s: that's got the market very spooked and
348.66s: for good reason again they haven't
351.12s: really even they've just begun
353.72s: quantitative tightening meaning pulling
356.52s: money out of the system but these rate
359.16s: hikes are unprecedented and I think are
362.94s: having a dramatic impact just look at
364.98s: mortgage rates mortgage rates went from
366.96s: Two and a half percent to seven and a
368.58s: half almost seven and a half percent
369.92s: here in a matter of you know within this
372.90s: year
373.68s: and uh you know in Pastime this is what
377.04s: really surprised me in in Past Times you
380.22s: know I've been through many cycles and
381.78s: have watched the FED through many cycles
384.12s: oftentimes
386.52s: um they over they overshoot but what
389.40s: typically happens is they start hearing
392.10s: from you know the
395.30s: Realtors and you know the you know the
399.54s: um Banks
401.82s: um industrial uh companies and again you
404.76s: know they all have their
407.34s: um a spokesman that speak for the whole
409.74s: industry
411.00s: and they they get to the fed and say you
414.06s: know we're worth maximum pain now you've
416.46s: got to back off
417.84s: the FED seemed I'm sure they're hearing
420.36s: from from some of those folks but the
423.36s: FED has shown an inability it's almost
426.60s: like they've they've got
429.06s: um their years closed and blinders on
430.98s: and they're saying we we don't care what
434.52s: pain is going to happen short term
436.32s: because we think that's so necessary to
438.42s: get inflation down and they are I think
442.56s: this is a fed that's way over their head
444.24s: I don't think it's the most qualified
446.40s: Federal Reserve or fomc we have ever had
449.34s: in fact I think it's it's being led by a
451.68s: lawyer who has bought into a I think a
454.68s: very false narrative or a bad narrative
458.16s: um in terms of thinking that he's got to
460.20s: drive the stock market much lower
463.16s: to impact Financial conditions to the
466.38s: degree necessary to get inflation down I
468.78s: think that's a very false narrative it
471.24s: was started by Bill Dudley who's the
473.52s: former president of New York fed former
476.34s: senior Economist at Goldman Sachs it's
479.40s: probably the dumbest thing or or most
482.46s: dangerous thing that's come out in a
484.08s: long time and yet he convinced Powell
487.56s: that that's that's important that that
490.68s: should be their primary focus and and
494.82s: Paul has very clearly indicated that
497.58s: that's his intention and that's what
499.68s: we've seen for
501.66s: um several weeks to the last few months
505.98s: um you know particularly the last few
507.54s: weeks he's trotted out all his fomc
510.90s: members
512.18s: speaking from the same Hymnal constantly
514.92s: saying the same thing and one trying to
517.74s: up the other one in terms of sounding
519.42s: more hawkish trying to scare the market
521.88s: down that's his whole intent and you
525.42s: know we we saw last Thursday a week ago
529.20s: Thursday
531.12s: um the market opened went straight to
532.80s: 3500 and it broke some important some
536.64s: levels that people thought were
537.66s: important technically and just you know
540.42s: cascaded down to 3 500 the first hour of
543.78s: the open and and then reversed that that
548.46s: was driven by comments you know more
551.58s: hawkish comments and ever since he's
553.80s: continued that they I think they believe
556.82s: minimum we've got to get the market down
559.02s: near 3 000 and I think Dudley really
562.50s: believes it has to go a lot lower than
563.94s: that so maybe Powell does who knows I
566.16s: think they're going to be
567.90s: um have their head handed to them I
569.76s: think they're going to be be surprised
571.50s: that they don't don't control the market
573.02s: but for a while the rhetoric did Scare
576.18s: the market and that was what really has
577.68s: pushed the market down and kept it down
579.48s: and every time it lifted its head it'd
581.94s: go back because they'd send out some
583.50s: more speakers
585.32s: it's just a very amateurish way to run
588.60s: policy in my opinion and it's also a
590.76s: very wrong-headed narrative that he's
592.86s: bought into
593.96s: but the good news is
596.76s: you know the markets can overpower the
598.98s: fed the FED thinks they're in charge
600.48s: they're going to be surprised that the
602.58s: markets will move against their efforts
604.86s: and and today you see the market up
608.28s: you know the the SPs up almost 80 points
611.30s: uh over two percent and and uh that was
616.38s: the result of one or two fed officials
619.68s: coming out and softening their
622.86s: commentaries so they weren't they
625.32s: weren't uh quite as
628.14s: um aggressive in stating that you know
631.14s: we have to do another 75 and we have to
632.94s: do another 75 Mary Daley who's head of
636.12s: the San Francisco fed and has been
638.88s: talking like all of them very hawkishly
641.52s: just indicated that maybe we need you
644.94s: know we need to consider that we're
646.74s: doing you know we're causing harm
648.54s: overseas there's there's risks Rising
651.00s: all around the world maybe we need to
653.52s: think about softening our approach here
657.06s: a bit maybe we need to if not pause at
660.18s: least
660.96s: hike less aggressively for a little
663.18s: while here and see what you know what
664.92s: comes because that's that's the other
666.96s: thing that I think is the Amateur hour
668.52s: about fed is is that they don't
671.46s: understand leads and lags they give lip
673.98s: service to it but the legs of mags are
676.44s: quite you know quite lengthy so they're
679.32s: they're looking at current
681.48s: uh when the CPI comes out it's the last
683.94s: month's CPI so they're looking backwards
686.22s: and determining forward policy based on
690.00s: a number that's already a month old
692.96s: and
694.50s: um and with with a number that is with a
698.82s: inflation that is typically
701.82s: um you know a year lagged at least so
705.72s: you know in other words they can if
707.58s: they're going to conduct policy based on
709.26s: old news they're guaranteed to go way
712.56s: too far in their tithing and my belief
714.90s: is they've already done that as I say
716.28s: the seeds for a global bust are already
719.58s: sown in other words the tightening
722.10s: they've done already is way past where
725.16s: um you've already created a hard landing
727.08s: and that hard Landing is going to become
729.02s: uh something even worse than a hard
731.34s: landing and a global bus and again it's
734.22s: global
735.42s: what uh also surprised me is that the
738.06s: FED is not hearing from central banks
739.74s: around the world saying ease up guys you
742.44s: know you're causing us a lot of pain you
744.54s: know we can't handle it we don't have
746.28s: some resiliency you have you saw it in
749.28s: the UK when
751.32s: um the guilt Market went crazy and there
754.50s: was you know the pension uh funds over
757.44s: there were at risk
760.26s: um
760.86s: you've seen it you know in other
763.08s: countries in other areas around the
765.00s: world you know Japan's going through
767.24s: some of its
769.38s: um self-inflicted but they're going
771.24s: through some real problems that I think
772.68s: are down the road going to cause real
774.84s: problems for them but but um you know
777.96s: it's surprising because in the past
780.00s: you'd see by now you would see the
782.82s: central banks get together and do a
785.10s: coordinated
786.54s: um you know easing or you know in this
789.90s: case the dollar is very very strong
792.00s: against all those currencies and
794.82s: normally you'd see a coordinated
797.52s: um you know effort to get the dollar
800.28s: down because it's putting a lot of
802.44s: strain on on countries around the world
804.42s: and on other currencies so the fact that
807.42s: we're not seeing that is troublesome
809.88s: because it indicates either the FED is
813.54s: you know basically deaf to all the all
816.72s: the conversations they're they're
818.04s: hearing or
820.08s: that we have central banks around the
822.90s: world they're all over their head and
824.34s: not really doing what we would have seen
826.50s: in the past cycles and that is my
828.48s: concern I think we clearly have a
831.30s: situation where inflation hasn't been
832.86s: around for 40 years so you got a lot of
835.20s: people in these positions that never
836.76s: lived through the early 80s I did and
840.00s: you know they all think we got to do
841.56s: what volcker did well there's you know
843.66s: number one that's a very different
844.98s: Situation Number Two the pandemic
847.02s: happened and so a lot of what's happened
849.84s: here is related to the pandemic in terms
853.20s: of inflation
854.82s: um Ukraine happened the invasion of
856.98s: Russia's invasion of Ukraine happened
858.98s: that also
861.36s: um is something that's different than
863.34s: the early 80s so you've got a lot of
865.14s: things here that you've got to sort
867.18s: through and realize this isn't just
869.76s: simple you know well this is the first
872.70s: time we've had double-digit inflation or
874.68s: close to double digit inflation since
877.14s: the early 80s
878.76s: we got to follow volcker's Playbook he
881.10s: was a hero I'm going to be a hero I mean
883.50s: I I don't know what's going through
885.12s: Paul's mind but it is he has invoked the
889.44s: volcker either many times and said he
892.20s: you know he's trying to basically
894.42s: emulate that so so it's very concerning
897.30s: right now that we have a Federal Reserve
899.34s: that
901.26s: um
902.34s: may think they have a handle on things
905.34s: but really don't
907.56s: um so in the end
910.74s: um I think they're closer to the end of
913.26s: their Titan whether they realize they're
915.12s: not because I think the markets will
916.92s: ultimately force their hand
919.56s: um and and the economy is moving towards
922.38s: a place where they're going to finally
923.88s: wake up but you know who knows when
927.00s: exactly they're you know and and the
929.52s: street in typical Street fashion they
931.80s: get caught in narratives so they think
933.66s: you've got to have a Fed pivot meaning
936.66s: fed lowering rates again
939.90s: um before the market can move and I've
941.88s: been pretty clear that I don't think
943.26s: that's what's coming that the market
945.48s: will move before the fed both the bond
948.30s: and stock markets I believe will start
950.46s: rallying before the FED pivots and
953.58s: today's a good example all you need is a
956.34s: little change in the rhetoric and the
958.56s: market will you know have more hopeful
961.38s: uh movement and then you know could it's
965.28s: not going to be a straight line all you
967.26s: need is them to come out next week and
969.36s: reiterate their hawkishness you'll have
971.70s: a couple speakers come out and reiterate
973.44s: hawkishness and it can take a step back
976.20s: again but
977.52s: ultimately I think we've seen the lows
979.74s: in the stock market last week
982.38s: and I think we're beginning what I call
984.54s: the final leg of a 40-year uh secular
987.42s: bull market
991.86s: one of the things you mentioned that I'm
993.48s: really curious about from a personal
995.10s: perspective is the fed's receptiveness
998.16s: to kind of foreign Partners expressing
1002.42s: concern over the way we're approaching
1005.00s: rates and inflation one of which comes
1007.34s: to mind is the UN they I saw an article
1009.92s: I don't know all the details behind it
1011.54s: but essentially they were asking the U.S
1014.24s: to chill out with the interest rate
1015.92s: raises
1017.12s: that made me really curious because I
1021.02s: anticipated that the FED is wise enough
1023.90s: to understand the impacts of what
1026.84s: they're doing on the global market and
1029.48s: other economies and I thought it was
1031.58s: interesting that the UN chose to
1033.80s: essentially ask them to stop I don't
1036.86s: understand why it they went about it
1039.20s: that way is it literally like a
1041.12s: last-ditch Hail Mary I assume they must
1043.40s: have already talked before you know they
1045.44s: come out with an official statement
1046.70s: asking did the U.S fed to stop raising
1049.64s: rates is do you think that the U.N is
1052.04s: just backed into such a corner now that
1054.20s: that's where they thought was the last
1055.70s: chance for them to get any reprieve from
1057.50s: the rate movements
1059.96s: um frankly the last person I want to
1061.94s: take advice from on on uh how to conduct
1065.36s: monetary policy is is the United Nations
1068.20s: so uh you know they're they're I'm sure
1071.42s: some of their constituents are are
1073.22s: concerned about
1075.20s: um what's happening in the world economy
1077.18s: so I think it comes from there and and
1080.00s: they're seeing some of the strains I'm
1081.68s: sure but it's really the the other
1084.74s: central banks and other Central Bankers
1086.78s: that and and I have no doubt the central
1090.02s: banks are talking I'm not saying that
1092.18s: Paul is shutting shutting down
1094.22s: communication at all I'm sure he's
1096.14s: hearing from others like I said I'm not
1099.20s: sure what others are saying uh you know
1102.02s: they don't speak in one voice either so
1104.42s: he may have heard from some that are
1107.00s: concerned
1108.56s: um but the ECB I think is probably a bit
1112.82s: wrong-headed just like he is
1115.40s: um the bank of England I think is you
1118.94s: know they all are focused on inflation
1121.18s: and I think at the
1124.58s: um
1125.12s: you know without understanding that with
1128.36s: the leads and legs the real risk now is
1130.88s: deflation you know I think as I said
1133.58s: next year is a global deflationary bust
1136.34s: in my opinion and they're all worried
1139.28s: that inflation's running away so they
1141.74s: they're kind of caught in what I think
1144.14s: is yesterday's problem and and because
1147.38s: of leads and lags they're staying the
1150.02s: party way too long on the tight side
1152.84s: um so it's not that he's not hearing
1157.04s: um that he's you know refusing to hear
1159.40s: uh I just think they are in a mantra
1162.08s: right now they're locked in a narrative
1164.12s: or
1165.68s: um believe that the most important thing
1168.14s: right now is to to defeat inflation and
1171.50s: their idea of defeating inflation as we
1173.78s: need to see the signs in the CPI in the
1176.48s: past CPI wasn't even something the FED
1178.40s: paid a lot of attention to because it's
1180.20s: you know it's a flawed index
1182.78s: um but for whatever reason it's the
1185.66s: headline index and certainly since June
1189.52s: Powell has made that front and center so
1192.50s: the market makes that front and center
1194.06s: every time there's a CPI release a
1195.92s: monthly CPI release that's that's
1198.68s: watched as closely as the jobs number of
1201.02s: the monthly jobs number and like I said
1203.68s: in the past the Fed
1206.30s: looked at the consumption deflator and
1210.56s: that was their primary one that tends to
1212.84s: you know not be as the big swing so
1216.86s: um I I there's just a lot of reasons why
1219.86s: I argued that this fomc led by this guy
1224.30s: and I've been you know critical of him
1226.34s: in the past but also complimentary at
1228.14s: times but I I personally think Jay
1230.72s: Powell is way over his head
1233.68s: so thinking about the FED handling all
1237.74s: of this one of the things you were
1239.06s: talking about is the market potentially
1241.82s: forcing their hand to kind of pause
1244.70s: their campaign on raises I'm curious
1247.40s: what do those Market circumstances look
1250.34s: like that would cause the fed or Powell
1253.40s: to then take a step back and say okay we
1255.92s: need to stop raising rates here or you
1258.20s: know whatever other pivot they think
1259.64s: makes sense
1261.56s: foreign
1262.96s: it's going to be the economy
1265.52s: and inflation uh probably it could
1269.42s: either be either one that you know what
1272.48s: what we're setting up for and I don't
1274.70s: have a prediction of when it's going to
1276.26s: happen like I said it starts with
1278.18s: something like today where
1280.34s: some fomc members maybe they've heard
1283.34s: from people or maybe they're just using
1285.02s: their own their own heads but
1287.90s: um they're beginning to question how far
1290.42s: do we go before we pause because that's
1292.16s: the other thing and this is another sign
1293.98s: uh not to jump around but this is
1296.24s: another sign of I think Paul's I don't
1299.84s: want to say an experience because you've
1300.92s: been on the FED for a number of years
1302.12s: you know in this role and prior to that
1304.34s: but he's a an attorney and he's you know
1307.70s: he's a financial guy he's not an
1309.56s: economist and
1312.08s: um the the problem is that I think he's
1315.38s: seeing this as linear so in other words
1318.16s: we've got to do all our tightening now
1321.26s: you know again in previous times not not
1323.66s: that other fed chairman haven't made
1325.28s: plenty of mistakes but
1327.28s: oftentimes you tighten and then you know
1330.80s: going back let's go back to the to the
1333.26s: early 80s you know we had a double dip
1335.48s: recession
1336.98s: um you know in 1980 you went in you came
1339.62s: out of it in 81 you went back into it in
1341.84s: 82 and it was because they didn't do
1345.02s: everything in a straight line they they
1347.00s: paused to see what because of the leads
1349.58s: and legs you don't know what damage
1351.92s: you've done for many many months and if
1355.40s: you just kind of decide we're going to
1357.56s: go here because that's you know we're
1360.32s: going to go until we see the the
1363.04s: inflation come down
1365.30s: you know you've gone too far so you know
1368.36s: what you're going to see I think at some
1370.22s: point in the next I'd say next few
1373.58s: months is a pause where they're gonna at
1377.72s: least finally wake up to the fact that
1380.30s: hey we don't know how much damage we've
1382.46s: done there's plenty of signs that we've
1384.74s: done a lot of damage in housing uh
1387.26s: there's plenty of science that the
1388.40s: consumer is starting to have problems
1391.76s: um and and Industrial is obviously
1394.76s: having problems commodity prices have
1396.32s: come down maybe we need to pause and see
1400.28s: what the effect of all these hikes that
1402.62s: we've done since April you know April
1405.38s: and June and and July and and September
1410.14s: and and soon to be November you know all
1413.42s: those hikes maybe we need to pause
1415.04s: because we've you know we've taken rates
1417.26s: from almost zero up to over four percent
1420.94s: right and you know maybe we need to
1424.22s: maybe we need to step back and I I think
1428.54s: today was kind of the beginning of that
1430.34s: unfreeze and I think as we move forward
1433.40s: in the next couple months you'll see
1435.02s: more of that because I think the economy
1437.06s: is going to be softening
1438.86s: um certainly housing is going to be
1440.00s: showing some a lot of pain
1442.88s: um Autos probably
1444.86s: anything interest sensitive is getting
1447.32s: hit now and and so the other the other
1451.04s: thing that kind of along with inflation
1453.98s: he's he's saying okay we also have we
1457.88s: have a double mandate it's employment
1459.44s: basically and inflation inflation is too
1462.14s: high we're going to work to get that
1463.46s: down you know we're going to stay tight
1464.78s: because of that and we're not worried
1467.42s: about being too tight because employment
1470.36s: is pretty strong well employment's
1472.52s: another laggard you know you're you're
1474.68s: not going to know you're not going to
1476.06s: see the employment tip until way too
1478.58s: late so he's using you know again he's
1481.58s: not showing that he really understands
1483.14s: leads and legs and I keep repeating that
1486.38s: not here not just here but you know in
1489.38s: all my commentaries that's really the
1492.20s: issue is there's big there's long leads
1494.60s: and legs to policy and and if you don't
1498.62s: understand that you almost guarantee
1501.14s: that you're going to overstay On The
1502.94s: Tight side and create a crack up
1507.50s: what's the risk if they do take that
1510.92s: pause like what would stop them from
1513.26s: taking that pause and seeing how things
1515.84s: go is it simply the appearance that they
1518.42s: don't have it under control still I
1520.28s: don't understand the the downside if
1523.22s: they go through cycles of raising and
1525.50s: they apply that methodology where they
1527.12s: say okay we've raised you know 75 basis
1530.06s: points three quarters in a row or
1531.50s: whatever or you know three meetings in a
1533.42s: row let's take a pause for a cycle and
1536.30s: see what happens why don't they do that
1538.70s: yeah it's uh I think there are a couple
1540.86s: reasons one
1542.18s: they they got criticized roundly for
1545.42s: being late to
1548.24s: um fight inflation you know they they
1550.46s: viewed it and I don't even hold him you
1553.22s: know people think of the task for that
1555.44s: last year that he called it transitory
1557.90s: because he was right some of it some
1559.94s: inflation was certainly transitory and I
1562.10s: think he was right about that but this
1564.56s: year's inflation took everybody by
1566.06s: surprise certainly him and so I think
1569.72s: he's taken a very uh personally uh and I
1573.56s: think the whole FLC that they've been
1575.90s: roundly criticized for being late to
1578.48s: understand what they needed to do and I
1580.94s: think they're trying to make up for that
1582.32s: by being overly tight now and they keep
1586.16s: they've even said it themselves they're
1588.38s: worried about their credibility they're
1590.12s: trying to protect their credibility by
1592.46s: staying tight to say see we we really
1595.04s: you know yes we were late we admit we
1597.62s: were late and we should have tightened
1599.48s: sooner but now you're seeing we're real
1601.70s: inflation Fighters and I think they're
1603.50s: overdoing
1604.84s: their concern about their credibility I
1607.34s: mean the focus is do the right thing for
1609.56s: the you know for the economy and and
1612.86s: um you know set the right policy and I
1615.44s: think they think they are but you know
1618.02s: anytime you allow your personal
1620.78s: credibility to be part of the argument
1623.66s: I think you run risk of an error that's
1626.36s: number one and I'll go back to Dudley uh
1629.12s: Dudley's Dudley's thesis about the
1633.20s: market having to go a lot lower to to
1635.50s: feed inflation is front and center with
1639.68s: the fed and certainly with Powell and I
1642.92s: think that's more than anything else
1645.02s: right now the reason why he's afraid to
1649.16s: pause if he pauses he knows the market
1651.92s: will just like today I'm sure he doesn't
1654.20s: like today
1655.28s: do you want to mark it down and today
1657.32s: the Market's up two percent and looks
1659.00s: like it's running
1660.32s: he doesn't want that at all because he's
1662.42s: bought into Dudley's thesis
1664.94s: so I I think
1667.82s: every time we rally it's pushing off his
1670.82s: his willingness to pause not that he was
1674.00s: thinking about it anyway I think he's
1675.98s: he's the the positive thing about how
1679.88s: is I think he's been very transparent
1681.98s: and very sincere about what he's trying
1684.62s: to do I I don't think at all that he's
1688.16s: playing a game or you know you get that
1691.94s: a lot his people are distrustful of the
1693.98s: facts so they always think they're kind
1695.48s: of doing this on purpose or uh you know
1698.66s: trying to hurt the economy for a new
1701.48s: world order reasons or
1704.72s: um
1705.32s: or that he's lying to us you know he's
1707.84s: doing what he's saying it but he's not
1709.76s: really meaning it or whatever no I think
1712.52s: he's very transparent very sincere I
1714.74s: think he's a you know he's a decent man
1717.14s: trying to do his job I just think he's
1719.90s: very wrong-headed and over his head
1722.72s: um and making a big error
1725.30s: one of the things we talked about last
1727.16s: time and you touched on it earlier was
1728.72s: the housing market and the hypothesis
1730.76s: was that we would see some contraction
1733.76s: in the housing market which we certainly
1735.68s: have started to see that I'm a little
1738.20s: surprised at the relationship though
1741.80s: between what we're seeing happening with
1743.54s: rates and subsequent housing prices it
1746.24s: doesn't seem like housing prices have
1748.10s: contracted quite as much at least as I
1750.62s: would have anticipated with rates going
1752.18s: where they are as fast as they are but
1754.16s: obviously I haven't been around as long
1755.54s: as you have so I'm curious what you
1757.34s: think about that relationship and where
1759.98s: you see the housing market moving over
1761.96s: the next six to 12 months
1764.00s: yeah I I think the next six 12 months is
1766.58s: going to be pretty awful in housing I
1769.34s: think what you get is and you certainly
1772.10s: saw it in July you you had a spike in
1775.70s: rates in early June when we got the CPI
1779.00s: out the FED did their first 75 base
1782.06s: Point hike
1783.98s: um and then and then through the balance
1786.50s: of June and through July rates came down
1790.70s: um and what you get is all those people
1793.52s: that felt they missed
1796.30s: their chance to buy a house because
1798.44s: rates went up when they came down they
1801.50s: they're kind of that pen up demand that
1803.54s: jumps back in say oh we got our last
1806.00s: shot let's get in so that postpones the
1810.14s: real hit to housing and you've had some
1812.72s: of that over the last you know certainly
1814.82s: the summer months I think now with
1817.16s: mortgage rates at seven seven percent
1819.44s: Plus
1821.48s: um it's shutting down housing quickly
1823.70s: and I think the next six months and
1826.34s: certainly the next 12 months you can
1828.50s: easily see a 20 25 maybe even a 30 back
1832.82s: up and that was you know housing prices
1835.64s: um you know uh breakdown housing prices
1838.42s: and you're definitely seeing them in the
1840.80s: activity a lot the Realtors are telling
1843.38s: you you know the the activity has really
1845.96s: slowed down the interest has really
1848.24s: slowed down it's a that's part of why
1850.88s: the bust is you know probably second
1853.34s: half of next year is because it just
1855.68s: takes time for all this stuff to work
1857.48s: through the system for those reasons you
1859.88s: know you got you got people who will if
1862.88s: they get you know if let's say the
1864.68s: mortgage rate went from
1866.66s: um three percent to four and a half or
1868.58s: five when it came back down to four I
1871.40s: don't remember what the numbers were
1873.74s: people aren't saying well I want I gotta
1875.72s: get back down to three no they say okay
1877.48s: at least we got a break and race let's
1879.68s: jump on now so they think they're
1881.84s: they're you know they're getting their
1883.40s: last chance
1885.14s: um and and that works through you know
1887.36s: at various levels but I think once you
1890.06s: get up to here you know if you've seen
1893.06s: any of the numbers on what a seven
1895.94s: percent mortgage does versus uh two and
1898.76s: a half or three percent mortgage to the
1901.40s: what you can afford
1903.14s: it's it's
1904.84s: tremendously much you know you can't pay
1908.00s: nearly you can't buy nearly the same
1910.40s: house because your mortgage payment is
1913.16s: doubled
1914.36s: um so I mean that obviously there are
1917.66s: people that it doesn't you know money is
1919.52s: No Object but for the majority of people
1921.62s: buying that's how they were buying is
1923.84s: what can we afford and you know they
1926.90s: they move from Two and a Half to seven
1928.66s: changes affordability in a huge way so
1931.82s: there's zero question in my mind that
1934.46s: housing is going to get hit as hard as
1936.50s: you know the hardest it's been hit in
1939.80s: you know since 2008 and and could be
1943.64s: harder than that even you know 2008 you
1946.28s: had the subprime situation this time
1948.62s: it's a different Dynamic but I think
1950.72s: it's a you know this rapid Rising rates
1952.94s: is a is a big one
1955.28s: yeah I think that makes sense and it's a
1957.74s: really good explanation thank you for
1958.94s: sharing that because I was genuinely
1960.08s: just curious for my side because I was a
1961.64s: little surprised at how they seemed to
1963.50s: decouple a little bit
1965.24s: um moving forward now we've talked a
1968.00s: little bit about your general hypothesis
1970.70s: that we see a pretty robust Market run
1973.64s: up or a melt up as you refer to it as
1975.80s: before we start you know this later
1977.90s: capitulation
1979.94s: um I'm curious you've shared a little
1982.04s: bit of background on what that looks
1983.72s: like and what the Catalyst could be but
1985.94s: could you dive a little further into
1987.62s: detail in terms of you know you've
1989.84s: shared that you've felt maybe last week
1991.88s: is where we might have posted Lowe's
1995.36s: so what really drives the next stage of
1998.96s: this melt up in your eyes
2000.94s: sure
2002.08s: um yeah let's talk about last week last
2004.00s: week I thought going into
2007.24s: uh you know the end of last week last
2009.28s: Thursday it looked like we were going to
2012.34s: retest June those basically June those
2014.44s: were I think 36 40 or thereabouts we
2018.40s: went down through a 3600
2021.58s: um in the month of October and you know
2024.46s: last week and and it looked like it was
2027.28s: going to probably stop you know 30
2030.94s: five eightish I think was about where it
2033.52s: was and it looked so that and people
2036.82s: said oh it's broken that that June low
2039.22s: so you were talking about a retest that
2041.08s: can't be a retest or a successful retest
2043.54s: I said no that's the way a lot of
2045.58s: retests go is they'll they'll Break by a
2048.64s: little bit and then uh reverse you know
2051.52s: the the market loves to get you guessing
2053.76s: and so when it when it went through 3600
2057.94s: I was hearing that and then Thursday
2060.64s: morning when it went down to 34.90 to
2063.70s: you know went down 3 500. that was a you
2067.24s: know a bigger break and I had people say
2068.86s: well now your your retest of the June
2071.50s: those that piece is out the window and
2074.32s: it really isn't or was it
2076.90s: um you know it was just a a slightly
2079.54s: bigger break to scare a lot of the weak
2082.30s: hands out to convince people we're going
2084.58s: a lot lower and then within an hour of
2087.46s: the opening it began building up the
2089.80s: other way and you know we're we're a
2092.38s: couple hundred points or more above that
2094.54s: now
2096.04s: um and so
2098.38s: um I think that was a successful retest
2100.72s: of the Juno is basically a double bottom
2103.90s: um as as crazy as that might sound since
2106.18s: it you know it's 140 150 points lower
2109.72s: than the June bottom but that's that's
2112.72s: within the way you know past bottoms how
2115.60s: they retest
2117.16s: um and so I think we're probably you
2120.16s: know I could be wrong it could go back
2122.02s: through there and go to 3400 or
2124.60s: somewhere around there I I think there's
2127.18s: a very good chance that that was our
2129.64s: retest that we had a double bottom and
2132.58s: that we're beginning the next leg up
2135.16s: um and I I do want to explain because
2136.66s: people always say well is the Melt up
2138.34s: started and I go
2140.08s: um yeah I just want people to understand
2141.84s: the term melt up the real melt up part
2145.54s: of the next leg up is probably going to
2149.62s: kick in after the new highs so 4800 SMP
2153.04s: you get above that decisively let's say
2155.68s: to 4 900 five five thousand that's what
2159.88s: will convince people that hey this is
2161.68s: real this isn't just a bear Market rally
2164.62s: you know and you're gonna have people
2166.66s: coming in that's when you can get the
2168.46s: vertical run a melt up means basically
2172.18s: the parabolic part of a rally
2174.40s: so so the Melt up doesn't start at 3500
2178.12s: or you know it's not a melt up now it's
2181.66s: a it's a new in my opinion it's a new
2184.06s: leg of a new bull leg of a secular bear
2186.82s: uh bull market so so this you know just
2190.06s: like March 2020 to December 2021 was a
2194.32s: full leg
2195.58s: this one will be you know from 3 500 up
2199.06s: to 6 000 Plus in my opinion and I think
2202.06s: this one that one took 21 months you
2204.64s: know the 2020 rally
2206.50s: this one probably takes
2208.78s: half that or less so you know I'm
2211.36s: guessing it could take six months or
2213.94s: less but
2215.50s: um it's basically the Melt up is the
2218.50s: latter stage of it it's when you finally
2220.72s: are in what I call the blow off or melt
2222.76s: up stage going into a top but
2226.66s: it is the rally that leads to the Belt
2228.76s: up it is the final leg in my opinion and
2231.64s: I think it's begun
2233.50s: um that doesn't mean it goes straight up
2235.06s: you could rally
2237.34s: you know for a little while and then
2239.50s: have a you know a week or two of
2241.66s: pullback
2243.46s: um you could you could go straight up so
2246.16s: it's hard to know exactly how you know
2249.52s: how the path will proceed but what I
2252.46s: think is pretty clear is that we've seen
2254.14s: the lows or at least I believe we've
2256.42s: seen the lows and that we could we could
2260.02s: run here pretty fast to 4 600 46.50 and
2264.22s: maybe maybe pause there
2267.28s: um pull back correct you know give it a
2269.50s: chance to breathe uh before it runs
2273.16s: um because this thing's going to be a
2274.66s: steep rally it's hard to know you know
2277.00s: it's not going to do you're not going to
2278.86s: be able to count on charts and say it's
2282.22s: going to do exactly this but I think I
2284.50s: think you're it's dependent on how
2287.61s: [Music]
2288.46s: um
2289.00s: you know first you're gonna have short
2290.86s: covering you're going to have a lot of
2292.42s: you know we're in we're in pretty high
2294.58s: short uh shorting territory those shorts
2299.20s: as this thing moves up because they
2301.00s: thought yeah we can rally to 3 700 or a
2304.18s: little above as this thing moves up
2306.22s: above say 38 3900 you can have more of
2310.06s: them saying hey maybe I got a cover you
2312.16s: know maybe this has more legs than that
2314.14s: then as it moves further than that
2316.42s: you're going to have more people saying
2318.94s: more investors saying well the momentum
2322.06s: is to the upside now I got all this
2323.74s: money on the sidelines maybe I'd better
2325.66s: put some money to work uh you know both
2328.54s: institutional and Retail saying I've
2330.58s: been positioned defensively now I've got
2332.44s: to get back in because this thing has
2333.82s: legs
2334.90s: and then the final piece is when you get
2337.96s: to those new highs and I think fomo
2342.40s: kicks in you know fear of missing out
2343.96s: kicks in and everybody jumps in and says
2346.12s: oh wow this is this is real and this is
2348.94s: going a lot farther how
2351.58s: uh the the big question I get a lot is
2354.40s: how can you be so bullish
2356.74s: when you're talking about a global bus
2358.96s: next year
2360.52s: the economy looks like it's heading for
2362.38s: a global bust right now the fed's
2364.60s: talking about tightening for many many
2366.64s: more months
2368.56s: um the bond Market's been going against
2370.42s: you how how can you be so sure you're
2373.18s: going to have a melt up and uh two
2376.48s: pieces of that one
2378.58s: um
2379.30s: is the fact that we have sentiment at
2383.26s: levels where you don't get to very often
2385.00s: by some measures it's the worst ever but
2387.34s: certainly it's back to 2008 nine levels
2390.60s: or you know previous bear market levels
2393.76s: like 1982 or
2397.08s: 1987 or 2003 so so you're at levels that
2402.64s: historically have indicated you're
2405.04s: pretty close to a bottom
2407.02s: um it's not a timing element so it's not
2409.30s: like you can look at Bear sentiment and
2411.34s: say okay I Gotta Buy but it does say an
2414.70s: awful lot has been built into the market
2417.04s: already discounted in terms of the bad
2418.96s: news
2420.00s: one you have something at that level and
2422.56s: you have you know you don't have to look
2425.08s: very far to hear people talk bearishly
2427.66s: everybody's as I say everybody's on one
2430.00s: side of the boat
2431.08s: you know they're all sitting on one side
2433.30s: of the boat negative
2435.34s: and if you get this thing moving against
2437.74s: that view
2439.60s: you got an offline Firepower there and
2443.14s: and I just describe different kinds of
2445.18s: investors you know short covering and
2446.98s: and institutions and Retail and uh some
2450.64s: of their momentum and some that are just
2452.56s: long-term investors that got scared but
2455.08s: you have an awful lot of people who for
2457.36s: different reasons
2458.86s: are going to say my gosh I'm missing
2461.98s: this my gosh I can't afford to be this
2464.50s: defensive you know with so much cash
2466.60s: it's gonna you know it's gonna start
2468.22s: punishing institutional investors that
2470.56s: have bogeys to me
2472.48s: Etc so as it moves up and then
2475.00s: psychology is is the other big piece as
2478.06s: it moves up
2479.26s: people chase momentum you know the
2481.36s: psychology people are most bearish at
2483.58s: the bottom and most bullish at the top
2485.20s: and the tape draws them in each
2487.18s: Direction so as as the tape got more and
2489.46s: more negative investors got more and
2491.02s: more negative as a tape meaning the
2493.30s: day-to-day movement in the market got
2495.34s: gets more and more positive investors
2497.98s: will become more and more positive and
2499.60s: put money to work so that's you know
2501.82s: psychology is a big part of how markets
2504.16s: work so that's you know because we're so
2507.70s: so positioned against the market right
2509.98s: now so bearish
2512.14s: um it's pretty easy for me to say once
2514.60s: this thing gets started it has a lot
2516.94s: farther to go Than People realize
2518.86s: because everybody's been you know in in
2521.62s: agreement that it's going a lot lower
2523.42s: and they'll have to reverse that so
2526.00s: that's one and then how how do they
2529.12s: fundamentally get there and what I say
2531.76s: is that once investors
2535.00s: and particularly institutions but retail
2537.10s: follow them once investors the
2540.04s: institutional investors
2541.54s: get the sense that the fed's tightening
2544.00s: cycle is coming to an end
2546.88s: um you know that they went too far and
2549.10s: the economy is really getting weak
2550.90s: they're not they're not looking at
2553.24s: today's earnings or today's fundamentals
2555.94s: and buying or selling stocks based on
2558.46s: that they're looking out six to nine
2560.86s: months they're looking at What will what
2563.20s: will the landscape look like a year from
2565.24s: now nine months from now once they get
2568.42s: convinced that the FED is done or almost
2571.00s: done
2572.02s: they will start looking over the trough
2574.18s: the trough in the economy the trough in
2576.22s: earnings and they will start factoring
2578.80s: in let's say 20 uh 2024 earnings
2583.84s: um and so they'll be able to say yes
2586.90s: earnings are getting you know the
2588.40s: quarterly earnings are getting worse but
2590.92s: we don't care about that because that's
2592.24s: very discounted we're looking over the
2594.22s: trough to the next cycle that's what I
2597.04s: think particularly that moved from say 4
2600.22s: 800 to six or seven thousand that's what
2604.30s: that move will be mostly is the belief
2607.06s: that hey the tightening cycle is behind
2609.04s: us and this is you know this is 2009
2612.76s: again or this is 1980
2615.64s: two three again or this is 2003 again
2618.64s: where you have a full cycle ahead of you
2621.52s: so you you need to get back in because
2623.98s: there's a big cycle in earnings coming
2626.92s: um so that's what you know again I'm not
2629.14s: saying that's what ultimately happens
2632.38s: um because I do think this is a last
2634.06s: hurray not the beginning of a new cycle
2635.80s: but that's how I think it will draw
2638.08s: investors in and you know that will be
2640.30s: the narrative that drives the market
2643.90s: it's interesting you actually did a
2645.64s: really good job I think as well
2647.44s: explaining the initial Catalyst because
2649.12s: that was going to be a follow-up
2650.56s: question but you hit it right at the end
2652.12s: like what actually gets the wheels
2653.92s: started moving you know from here to
2656.14s: that
2657.22s: um you know 45 48 100 handle but I I
2660.16s: think you you shared that pretty pretty
2662.20s: well thank you for that one of the
2664.48s: things I want to make sure we touch on
2665.92s: is
2667.18s: let's say we get this melt up and we're
2670.36s: now hanging out around 6 000 between six
2673.48s: and seven thousand s PS
2675.46s: what starts the conversion then from
2679.48s: that last blow off top into this Global
2682.78s: bust
2684.76s: yeah so so as I said before it's not you
2688.24s: know some people think when I talk about
2691.24s: the recession now and a global bus next
2693.70s: year they think somehow they're two
2695.68s: different things I go no the the
2698.14s: recession ultimately morphs into a bus
2700.84s: because things progress to that point
2703.24s: where you know Banks start failing and
2705.52s: things start happening it's you know I
2708.04s: think Traders have a hard time with it
2710.02s: because
2711.30s: they're thinking in the moment you know
2713.56s: they they don't realize that this stuff
2715.36s: takes a long time to play out I'm
2717.22s: forever saying you gotta let the cycle
2719.20s: play out and that just means it takes
2721.72s: months and months and months for all
2723.28s: this stuff to piece together just like
2724.84s: your question about housing you know it
2726.70s: doesn't all happen the minute rates go
2728.62s: to seven percent it happens over time
2731.32s: because you know there are different
2733.18s: people out there in different places in
2735.40s: terms of their
2736.90s: um
2737.64s: positioned to buy a house or what have
2739.84s: you so and and plan to do it so
2743.38s: um so inventories build up and you've
2745.84s: got a correct inventory that's a process
2748.60s: all of those things so
2751.36s: um so it it just takes time but once we
2754.78s: get up to the top psychologically most
2757.78s: people are going to be all in so the
2759.88s: investor uh looking at the market the
2762.52s: investor is going to be most bullish at
2764.38s: the top he's he's extremely bearish now
2768.22s: and you know when markets up you know up
2772.12s: of two or three thousand points from
2774.16s: here
2775.18s: he's going to be fully bullish and he's
2777.88s: going to be arguing with me who's now
2779.92s: turned bearish as to why I'm wrong
2782.62s: because don't I understand there's you
2785.44s: know there's a long cycle ahead the
2787.84s: fed's not tightening anymore because the
2789.82s: economy's so weak but the other piece to
2793.60s: this
2794.38s: is that the economy can get a lot weaker
2798.58s: because of the Damage Done Now that
2801.22s: whole thing of staying too long now and
2804.88s: and I think what's going to happen
2806.68s: around the world
2808.90s: um is you're going to have
2811.66s: a crisis financially like we haven't
2814.06s: seen so it's it's going to require
2816.78s: a lot of
2819.24s: effort on the part of the fed and other
2822.52s: central banks in terms of pumping money
2825.10s: and on the part of governments to try to
2827.62s: prop everything up I think it's just
2829.60s: going to be a huge mess so
2832.30s: um and there's pieces of this I can't
2834.40s: know yet but I suspect given the The
2837.88s: Dudley thesis
2839.92s: imagine what Powell and Dudley are going
2842.74s: to be thinking if the market's at six or
2845.50s: seven thousand when they thought it
2847.90s: needed to get to say 2500 to tighten
2851.32s: Financial conditions so they're they're
2853.66s: not going to walk away from tightening
2855.22s: now the street isn't going to be worried
2856.66s: about that they're going to feel like
2858.58s: because the economy's weak
2861.10s: and inflation has come down a bit in the
2863.50s: next say four or five months
2866.62s: um there you know they're going to say
2869.08s: tightening is behind us or at least for
2871.54s: period of time is behind us but I think
2873.70s: the fed's mindset is going to be we have
2876.52s: unfinished business so yes inflation's
2878.50s: down I don't know where it will be six
2880.06s: months from now but let's say it's
2883.12s: um
2884.08s: five five or six percent on the CPI
2888.04s: um you know
2889.54s: they're going to say we're we're about
2891.22s: it you know we're not we haven't beaten
2893.32s: inflation yet it's starting to come down
2894.76s: but there's still risk and guess what we
2898.54s: got a a very speculative Market here
2900.64s: with investors at you know hyper risk
2905.02s: levels again
2907.06s: um you know very bullish and and uh
2910.48s: speculating we need we need to tighten
2913.78s: again you know and we need to get this
2916.24s: thing down so again I think Dudley's
2919.30s: thesis is going to rear its ugly head
2921.40s: and we'll play a role in that top I
2924.70s: think they'll be back to tightening
2927.94s: um the market will probably ignore it
2930.10s: initially but I don't know for how long
2932.38s: because I think I think
2934.54s: if if I think they've sown the seeds to
2936.94s: a bus now
2938.08s: and then they come back and tighten
2939.88s: again they're exacerbating something you
2942.76s: know
2944.08s: um so it's it and again it's there's
2946.84s: leads and legs to all of this so it's
2950.32s: it's not going to be evident in in the
2953.56s: results
2954.58s: uh immediately in other words there if
2957.58s: they raise right rates and yet the
2959.38s: Market's moving up
2961.66s: um people aren't going to necessarily
2962.98s: say oh wow this hiking rates is
2965.02s: dangerous you know so so they they may
2968.08s: not it's not like a Bell's gonna go off
2970.96s: and people say okay I made my money now
2972.64s: I'm getting out again they're going to
2974.32s: be getting in you know they're gonna
2975.76s: think there's a long Runway ahead and
2978.10s: they're going to disagree with the fit
2981.34s: got it and I know we're coming up on
2984.04s: time there's just two questions I have
2985.78s: left for you the first one is what's
2987.52s: your take on the relationship and the
2989.32s: behavior that we're seeing really in the
2991.48s: bond market right now
2993.82s: um I've obviously I I've been trading
2995.80s: for a while and a lot of times I'll
2997.36s: trade risk on risk off relationships and
3000.36s: this year is very interesting in that
3002.52s: that relationship is obviously different
3004.14s: than it's been historically I'm curious
3006.00s: your thoughts on how bonds are behaving
3009.00s: and what that looks like going forward
3012.12s: yeah it's it's certainly been a surprise
3014.58s: to me I you know I was this summer
3017.46s: saying it looked there was a you know
3020.16s: there was a setup where it looked like
3022.14s: you were gonna run back from 250 to
3024.30s: three three and a quarter and then head
3026.82s: lower and it pushed right through that
3029.10s: three and a quarter and has run up to
3031.08s: you know four and a quarter here a
3032.88s: little higher
3034.26s: um and so that was you know not in in my
3037.50s: you know I didn't have any foresight in
3039.24s: that I missed that
3040.98s: um but I I think it is part of
3044.58s: um
3045.56s: Traders have gotten caught in what the
3048.24s: FED is doing which is
3049.98s: watching CPI every month so if you you
3052.74s: know if you go back and look September
3054.42s: CPI came in everybody thought okay
3057.72s: um you know they they may if not pause
3061.44s: at least start lightening up on the rate
3063.42s: hikes because September is CPI may start
3067.08s: showing that you know we've peaked in
3069.24s: inflation that's starting to come down
3070.38s: well instead we got to hire in CPI print
3072.90s: part of it's technical part of and part
3075.48s: of it is the makeup of the CPI and the
3078.12s: fact that it's you know imputing rent
3081.80s: uh rent probably peaked a year ago but
3084.60s: it's it's making it look like Grant has
3086.58s: a lot for the bill Etc
3089.04s: um
3089.64s: so so CPI was a surprise and the market
3092.64s: is just hyper tuned in to CPI now and
3097.86s: tuned into anything that goes with the
3100.56s: The Narrative that the FED has a long
3102.60s: ways to to hike here and so that kind of
3106.20s: Hit the markets in September and again
3108.12s: here this month
3110.40s: um but
3112.56s: um I kind of lost my train of thought
3114.12s: what was that oh so that that pushed the
3117.06s: rates up you know once you got above
3118.62s: three and a quarter then you got you
3120.84s: know you went back to the highs around
3122.22s: 348 I think uh once the 10 year got
3125.34s: above that it became just a technical
3127.80s: run and then this most recent jump and I
3131.10s: thought okay
3132.78s: um you know we've gone up above four and
3134.88s: then came back down and it looked like
3136.44s: we were going to go back and retest you
3138.72s: know 408 or wherever it's gotten to
3142.20s: um and it just pushed right through that
3144.36s: today and it went all the way to 431 I
3148.26s: think
3149.22s: um I think it's really just kind of
3153.42s: um a little bit in in the same way that
3156.72s: the stock market had to go to 34.90
3159.96s: to get investors
3161.94s: spooked enough
3163.64s: and get investors to start extrapolating
3167.46s: that into oh we're going to 3000 or what
3169.92s: have you I think the 10-year going to 4
3173.28s: 30 all of a sudden everybody's on you
3176.04s: know on the uh you know out on the ledge
3179.64s: saying okay we're going to 450 or 5
3182.72s: in other words I think it was the
3184.98s: capitulation sell-off potentially it's
3187.20s: still early to know that too early to
3189.00s: know that but I think that may have been
3191.04s: just kind of the last
3192.72s: uh gasp to get all the weak hands out of
3196.20s: the bond market and and then you can
3199.08s: start the reversal so if I'm right right
3201.78s: should start coming down uh between now
3204.42s: and the end of the year
3206.52s: um maybe fairly fast
3208.80s: um but certainly roll over and start
3210.42s: coming down uh if I'm wrong and it heads
3213.30s: higher I'm just missing it but but um I
3217.68s: don't think right now when I and I look
3220.80s: at a lot of things I don't just look at
3222.48s: you know what's the bond what's the 10
3224.94s: you're going to versus what the stock
3226.92s: market going to do there's a lot of
3228.66s: factors out there right now a lot of my
3230.76s: cross-market stuff and things are more
3233.58s: confirming my belief that we are at a
3236.94s: very important reversal Point here both
3239.10s: in bonds and stocks you know bonds are
3241.98s: are lagging here a little bit so you've
3244.20s: got to wait and see
3245.64s: stocks I think we bought them last
3247.56s: Thursday if if bonds follows through
3250.32s: next week and you get more rally uh I
3253.32s: think it will it will
3255.00s: just add more evidence that maybe
3256.86s: today's action early you know this
3259.68s: morning's action and bonds is a lot like
3262.80s: early morning third last Thursday in
3265.20s: stocks meaning that then they reverse
3268.68s: right
3270.06s: got it and I'm we're pretty much
3272.82s: buttoned right up the time but I got to
3274.74s: make sure I squeeze this one in because
3277.26s: um I think it's still really pertinent
3279.06s: to the broader picture here how do
3280.98s: precious metals fit into this picture
3283.92s: for you I've actually been really
3285.78s: surprised at some of the behavior of
3287.70s: gold specifically I trade gold Futures
3289.68s: pretty regularly and gold has been
3292.02s: interesting to me so I'm curious how
3294.06s: does how do precious metals fit into
3296.94s: this broader hypothesis of us into the
3299.46s: Melt up and then subsequent bust yeah
3301.86s: I'm glad we didn't leave this this
3304.38s: interview without talking about gold and
3306.54s: silver because I think we are we were at
3309.00s: a huge pivot point in gold and silver in
3311.76s: my opinion you know I've been I've been
3314.06s: uh bullish for a long time and I keep
3316.68s: thinking we bought them and then we go
3318.18s: back and make lower lows I think we're
3321.54s: at a
3322.92s: um so I'm the boy that cries wolf but
3325.26s: but I think we were at a major pivot
3327.72s: point and I'm expecting
3331.32s: um both the miners and the medals
3334.44s: to begin to move up from here pretty
3336.90s: aggressively so you know you could see
3339.60s: uh you know 15 or 20 move in the miners
3344.04s: um let's say in the next couple weeks
3347.04s: um you know I think so working in the
3348.96s: very short term silver looks like it's
3350.34s: got room to run 22 23.
3354.60s: um you know gold I think back over 1900
3357.24s: and in in the course of the next you
3360.24s: know six to nine months uh you know I
3362.94s: continue to call for gold at 3 000 and
3365.04s: silver at 50 or higher so I'm I'm a huge
3369.72s: Bull on the metals and when when I did
3372.24s: my work for my last letter
3374.22s: when I went back and looked what is very
3376.62s: clear
3377.64s: is that gold and silver rolled over in
3380.94s: particularly gold but gold and silver
3382.38s: rolled over almost coincident with the
3385.32s: dollar moving up back in April uh March
3389.28s: April and it it's almost entirely that
3393.84s: rates played a role too for sure and
3397.20s: most recently I think played a role in
3399.12s: this weakness but I if I'm right the
3402.90s: dollar is about to roll over
3405.12s: and if the dollar rolls over that's
3407.22s: going to be music to the ears of gold
3410.46s: and silver you know investors so
3414.06s: um I I don't think it's a lot more
3416.16s: complicated than that
3418.62s: um you know gold and silver are in my
3420.78s: opinion has undervalued at this point as
3424.32s: they've been in decades relative to
3427.32s: other markets and I think once they
3430.02s: start going they're going to get
3431.82s: sponsorship you know this this idea that
3434.04s: crypto is taken away their particularly
3436.86s: gold you know taken away from gold uh
3439.68s: may have been the short run uh attracted
3442.14s: people that would have other been wise
3444.12s: been gold buyers but I think the story
3447.18s: really was the dollar and again we talk
3450.60s: about rates when we talk about the Fed
3452.82s: but the truth is that
3456.36s: the dollar being where it is is because
3458.64s: of fed policy it's it's another reason
3460.74s: why I am so adamant about saying the
3463.68s: fed's making a huge policy error because
3466.14s: they seem to ignore
3467.94s: you know the the dollar in in just in
3471.02s: 2022 just this year just 10 months the
3474.72s: dollar has moved from I think 95 uh you
3479.34s: know dxy from 95 up to you know uh 115
3484.38s: or we're about yeah that's a huge move
3487.88s: with the FED with the fed and the
3490.32s: treasury not even paying attention to it
3492.00s: as if it didn't matter that that's why
3494.94s: I'm surprised we haven't heard more from
3496.98s: you know foreign entities and why the
3499.74s: central surprise central banks haven't
3501.42s: been on on the phone with the FED over
3503.58s: and over saying you got to do something
3505.14s: I mean look at look at what's happened
3506.94s: to the Yen now again that's a lot of
3509.76s: it's self-inflicted inflicted there and
3512.40s: it's going to lead to a disaster there
3514.08s: because they're about to
3516.96s: um
3517.88s: d-peg interest rates they've been
3520.02s: keeping their rate of the quarter and if
3522.60s: they let that run
3524.58s: they don't have the you know they're
3526.62s: gonna they're gonna run into real
3527.82s: problem to give it what they've done
3529.32s: over the last several decades with with
3532.38s: um you know how they've held things
3533.94s: together there so so uh you know there's
3537.12s: there's plenty uh that will be part of
3539.58s: the bust as well there's plenty of
3541.02s: things out there that will you know a
3542.76s: year from now be front and center in the
3545.64s: global bus because of policies that have
3547.92s: taken place here in the last few years
3550.14s: but
3551.28s: but um I think if the dollar is rolling
3554.82s: over as I expect gold and silver are
3557.22s: about to have big runs
3560.10s: David I know we're at time and thank you
3562.44s: honestly for taking some extra time on
3564.54s: that last question it was kind of an
3565.98s: unfair one to throw in at the last
3567.54s: second but
3568.92s: um I wanted to make sure we had a chance
3570.30s: to talk about it because it is I think
3572.28s: part of you know my general curiosity as
3574.80s: well and one thing I want to make really
3576.96s: clear to people who listen to this video
3578.76s: is I I definitely see a lot of folks
3581.40s: comment about oh well this didn't happen
3583.92s: or this didn't happen at that exact
3585.66s: point and what I think is so powerful
3588.48s: about the information you share is the
3591.00s: thought process you share the things
3593.64s: that you look at the relationships
3595.56s: between different factors and I learned
3599.04s: so much every time I talk to you so
3600.84s: thank you so much for taking some time
3602.52s: to chat with me and to share your
3604.44s: experience with the broader Community I
3606.06s: think it really is super useful yeah if
3608.58s: you if you don't mind I just want to
3609.90s: comment on that a little bit because it
3611.70s: is what I see on Twitter too
3615.48s: um I really believe and this this dates
3619.98s: me a lot because I was in this business
3621.72s: before computers were were on our
3624.06s: desktop so I really believe that you
3628.38s: know what we've evolved to now on the
3630.72s: retail side it's true on both
3632.58s: institutional retail but on the retail
3634.32s: side in particular they are now
3637.70s: bombarded with all kind of information
3639.60s: you know they have their fingertips
3642.90s: um you know charts and things that they
3645.18s: can see second to Second minute to
3647.22s: minute
3648.00s: and unfortunately I think what has
3650.16s: happened again this is my my view but I
3653.64s: think what has happened is it's turned a
3655.68s: lot of people who would have otherwise
3657.60s: been investors into Traders and somehow
3660.96s: I think I a very large
3663.54s: chunk of retail investors somehow
3667.14s: Believe by watching the market every day
3669.66s: and watching it minute to minute they're
3672.48s: more on top of their portfolios are more
3674.58s: on top of what's going on and what it's
3678.06s: leading to is expectations of things are
3680.88s: going to happen quickly you know again
3683.58s: the institutional Traders I you know I
3686.40s: oversaw a trading desk when I was Chief
3688.68s: investment officer or head of a equity
3690.84s: department so and and I had good friends
3694.14s: that were traders that worked for me
3696.60s: um but and Traders have a different
3698.46s: personality a different mentality and
3701.10s: they're watching markets from a
3702.60s: different perspective than a portfolio
3704.16s: manager so I'm not putting them down but
3706.62s: Traders
3708.54s: um retail Traders unfortunately I think
3712.26s: a lot of them don't understand how long
3714.36s: it takes for things to play out so my
3716.88s: biggest Critics on Twitter and the
3718.56s: reason I have so many
3720.72s: um people obsessed that I'm the most
3722.70s: extreme Bull in them in a bear Market
3724.50s: but but
3726.36s: um a lot of them what I see in the
3728.22s: criticisms is a lack of understanding of
3731.04s: what a big picture macro call is versus
3734.00s: a trading caller and you know or how
3738.42s: long it takes for the big picture to
3740.58s: play out and I'm not just using that as
3743.28s: a you know to Kick the Can down road so
3745.74s: you got to let it play out it's a cycle
3747.66s: call means it takes time to work through
3750.18s: that and so I'm you know I'm focused on
3754.02s: you know where's the market going to be
3755.88s: at the top I'm not necessarily focused
3758.40s: on what's the you know what's the bottom
3761.34s: in the market on the way to that top or
3763.20s: what have you so you know I'm not or or
3766.14s: if I think you're gonna make a double
3767.58s: bottom and it goes a little lower that's
3769.68s: not my focus so but the most important
3772.92s: piece of what I wanted to say was just
3774.96s: that I think if people could understand
3777.42s: that watching the market
3780.60s: so closely is typically
3783.12s: counterproductive for most of them you
3785.46s: know there's exceptions some may be
3786.90s: really good at picking things off and
3789.24s: and doing the short-term trading stuff
3790.98s: but most of them are investors but they
3793.44s: think somehow watching it every day
3795.12s: means they're getting more information
3796.92s: and they're going to be better at it and
3798.78s: or you know better at understanding
3800.82s: what's coming and what I see is
3802.92s: completely opposite I think it it leads
3805.74s: to
3807.18s: um almost a blindness from from watching
3810.18s: things too closely
3812.10s: I and not to draw it out too long but I
3814.74s: just I couldn't agree with you more I'm
3816.36s: a Trader myself and I've noticed my
3818.88s: Evolution where that exact thing
3821.10s: happened where I wanted to trade short
3823.14s: time frames
3824.76s: and then as I started integrating longer
3827.46s: time frames I actually started becoming
3829.74s: far more successful in trading so I'm
3832.62s: really glad you bring that up especially
3834.06s: from a Trader's perspective and I think
3835.68s: that's actually one of the reasons why I
3837.24s: love talking with you is because folks
3839.16s: with your perspectives you force me to
3842.76s: zoom out you forced me to consider an
3845.40s: alternative way of looking at the bigger
3847.56s: picture that you're absolutely right a
3849.78s: lot of Traders get sucked into you know
3852.12s: the X move that S P 500 made today
3855.24s: so I I really appreciate that
3857.28s: perspective and sincerely again thank
3859.68s: you so much for taking some time to chat
3861.48s: with me and share your your information
3862.98s: and obviously would love to have you on
3865.32s: again in the future
3866.88s: um and until next time though thank you
3869.46s: okay Eric
3871.20s: thanks David um
