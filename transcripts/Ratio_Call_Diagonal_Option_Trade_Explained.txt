0.00s: I made 28 return on my money in less
4.26s: than two months on this trade but I
6.00s: could have made more I want to walk you
7.62s: through the Apple ratio call diagonal I
9.84s: brought up on some of the YouTube live
10.98s: sessions and I want to share with you at
13.20s: the end of the video some different
14.52s: scenarios that could have played out if
16.74s: I placed the trade differently and talk
18.72s: about how I think about those because
20.64s: it's really important to keep things in
22.56s: context what's up everybody Eric here
24.36s: welcome back to all the outliers shout
26.22s: out to the patreon family if my videos
28.50s: are useful to you consider signing up
30.30s: helps me out a bunch let's get right
32.22s: into the video okay so here we have a
34.68s: trade in apple and essentially I entered
37.68s: here with some 190 days to expiration
41.22s: deep in the money long calls and I also
43.62s: sold some short premium against them the
46.44s: reason why I like this trade is because
47.82s: it allows me to benefit from The
49.32s: Leverage of options but then also
50.88s: collect some premium up front so that's
52.38s: exactly what I'm doing it's also known
53.94s: as a poor man's covered call which is
55.80s: slightly different than what I'm doing
56.94s: here so ratio diagonal now as I progress
59.64s: through the try trade I started noticing
61.26s: that there is definitely some bullish
62.64s: bias here I was getting the movements
64.08s: that I wanted to see and I needed to
66.48s: make some interesting adjustments to my
68.64s: position so here's what we got overall
70.68s: in apple I was bullish that's why I
73.20s: chose a ratio call diagonal and for
75.66s: those that you know don't really
77.16s: understand what I was seeing at the
78.42s: point in time I'm going to zoom this in
79.98s: so you can see exactly what it looked
81.54s: like when I entered which is this right
84.12s: here this is when I entered after a good
86.64s: earnings release after the earnings
88.50s: release it was holding that Gap up and
91.32s: the other thing I found interesting is
92.82s: that this is near-term highs right on
95.40s: the chart at the point in time and this
97.38s: is counterintuitive to a lot of Traders
99.00s: Traders are typically like they got a
100.38s: bargain buy they gotta look in the
101.76s: bottom of the bins and find the cheap
103.08s: cigarette butts that are half smoldered
105.00s: and hope that it goes up I'm partially
106.86s: making fun of Warren Buffett but not
108.24s: really he's a genius but I'm too
109.80s: impatient I'm not as good as he is and
111.54s: my goal is to make money a little bit
113.10s: faster so what I mean by all of this is
115.38s: I'm looking to buy on strength if I'm
118.02s: bullish and that's what I saw here so
119.70s: that's why why establish the position
121.02s: that I did let me Zoom this back into a
122.82s: six month daily that's a three month
124.08s: daily great job Eric you missed there we
125.70s: go we're back at it and let's take a
127.32s: look at the entry so like I said this
129.72s: was on the 10th of May I bought the 17
131.76s: nove 130 at a two to one ratio that's
134.64s: why I have two here and one's down here
137.52s: for the short calls and most of them so
139.62s: I'm just giving you an idea of the ratio
141.36s: this is the minimum size I could show
142.68s: you a two to one ratio and I had bought
145.02s: those for 47.45 they were around an 86
147.66s: Delta when I first bought them when I
149.34s: exited they were like a 98 Delta and the
152.04s: way that I was thinking about managing
153.54s: risk to the downside was actually pretty
155.22s: simple I entered here and I was using
157.50s: this near term resistance right down
159.30s: here as my stop so essentially as long
162.24s: as we didn't fall below like 164 I would
165.00s: have given it down to 162 before I got
167.34s: out and if it had gotten to that point
169.80s: it would have been a 22.50 loss on the
173.64s: two contracts again that I'm using here
175.38s: for the position sizing so it would have
177.66s: been a meaningful loss but again nothing
179.46s: too crazy easy relegating it to a pretty
181.44s: small portion of the account in total
183.18s: that's just of the allotment that I'm
185.34s: using here for the proxy ten thousand
187.02s: bucks okay when I first entered it was
188.88s: trading 172.73 something like that and I
192.12s: was starting with selling short premium
193.92s: against it as I typically do but then I
195.66s: started to notice that it was rallying
197.88s: it was continuing to Rally so what that
199.74s: meant was I had to take some of my short
201.54s: calls down actually the first one was in
204.24s: the money but I was able to take it down
205.80s: at a small profit because it so much
208.20s: time had passed that there was still a
210.36s: net credit to be seen even though it was
211.98s: in the money I love those scenarios and
213.72s: then I reloaded I downsized I went from
216.42s: a two lot to a one lot because I was
218.34s: seeing that bullish confirmation I
219.90s: wanted to let it move to the upside and
221.94s: that's exactly why I wanted to reduce
224.10s: some of the short Deltas against the
226.26s: Longs give it some more room to run and
228.00s: then the rest of the short calls that I
229.74s: was using in this instance I kept it
231.24s: down at that two to one ratio the reason
233.04s: why I had a one-to-one when I first
234.60s: entered is because the Deltas were
236.34s: offset enough that I still had upside
238.02s: potential to run now I did end up having
240.96s: a bunch of these that I closed for
243.06s: losses throughout the cycle of the trade
244.92s: and again that's because I was favoring
247.02s: the upside potential as compared to
249.60s: salvaging the credit that I could
251.16s: collect on the trade so you can look
252.78s: through this see what you think and the
254.82s: ultimate end State here is I exited I
257.64s: didn't exit both leaps at the same time
259.62s: I exited one of them to cover the cost
261.54s: of this in the money short call that I
263.64s: couldn't wiggle out of and then I closed
265.32s: the other one on this date right here on
270.36s: the 28th of July and the reason why I
272.52s: did that is because I had this position
274.56s: that was expiring 28 July they were the
276.96s: 190s and at this point we're at like
278.52s: 196. so there was nowhere for me to go
280.56s: it definitely there wasn't a great role
282.72s: available without going super far on
284.28s: time that kind of thing and I looked at
285.72s: it and said it made the move that I
287.46s: wanted and it had already started to
289.50s: stall out after hitting this high volume
291.84s: was Contracting down if we look at it on
294.42s: average and I also saw starting to hover
297.00s: into this nine-day moving average short
299.46s: term moving average so all of that led
301.50s: me to say like I actually thought there
303.30s: was going to be a little bit more upside
304.56s: potential after I got out but I didn't
306.36s: think it was gonna be too much so that's
307.98s: exactly why I got out here sometimes
309.72s: when something makes the move that you
311.40s: want it to make you don't have to fight
313.32s: it all of the way now one of the things
315.06s: somebody was asking me is how did I kind
317.40s: of decide when to take profits like why
320.34s: didn't I exit here or why didn't I exit
323.34s: here the main reason is is I'm following
326.10s: the trend as long as the trend continues
328.56s: to move where I want it to move what I
330.48s: like to do is continually slide up my
333.90s: stops so what I mean by that is if I
335.82s: grab this price level and I show you my
337.50s: original stop was you know like I said
339.24s: somewhere right around here around 162
340.80s: and that's when it was on the 10th of
342.48s: May then when I saw it rally up here
344.76s: into this like one high 170s I slid my
348.36s: stop up to here to 170. then as I saw it
351.00s: start to catch this leg I look for the
353.04s: next set of near-term resistance which I
355.08s: considered something around here maybe
356.88s: like 181 and I'm just using the tops
359.34s: from here and then the bottoms from here
360.84s: and then I'm using the moving averages
362.40s: as my shorter term indicator as I'm
364.68s: sliding this thing up I care about the
366.48s: slope and I care about the organization
368.16s: so as long as it continues following the
370.62s: trend then I'm gonna try to stay in it
372.54s: if I didn't have these short calls
374.34s: expiring that forced my hand to close
376.20s: here I would have held it until here and
378.06s: I would have gotten out as price firmly
380.70s: closed below the nine and was touching
383.58s: the 22 that would have been exit
385.26s: protocols for me in that case so just
387.00s: giving you some context there okay now
388.98s: as I promised I want to walk you through
390.48s: these three scenarios the first scenario
392.40s: is exactly what happened this was buying
394.38s: the long options and selling options
395.94s: against it which in this case worked
397.56s: against me I gave up some money doing
399.78s: that so in this case I walked out again
401.88s: 28.8 percent return on invested Capital
404.10s: if I didn't trade any short options knew
407.28s: the future and knew it was going to go
408.78s: up and just bought the same long options
411.36s: I would have had something between a 35
413.04s: 38 return on invested Capital depending
415.56s: on you know exact exit and entry so I'm
418.02s: giving up anywhere from you you know six
420.36s: to ten points on my return here but this
423.60s: is predicated on me knowing the future
424.92s: that it's going to go up I didn't that's
426.36s: why I trade these and then if we look at
428.16s: buying the commensurate size in shares
431.16s: it would have been a 13 return on
433.02s: invested Capital that's another thing
434.34s: people ask all the time is is it better
436.44s: to just buy the shares it can be
438.48s: sometimes but in this case it's a little
440.70s: more nuanced because if I had bought
442.98s: again using ten thousand dollar account
444.90s: as the sample if I had bought ten
447.00s: thousand dollars worth of Apple when it
449.16s: was trading at 172 I would have had like
450.96s: 55 shares something like that 57 I think
453.36s: and if that made its run from 172 up to
456.78s: 196 that's my return 13.1 but what
460.26s: you're seeing here is leverage in this
462.18s: scenario I would have controlled again
463.68s: like 57 shares in this case I was
465.78s: controlling 200 shares on the same exact
468.36s: cost structure this is why sometimes if
471.06s: you use options for leverage it can
472.80s: actually be a pretty beautiful thing so
474.36s: if you have any questions on what I did
475.80s: why I managed it the way I did let me
477.78s: know throw down in the comments if you
479.58s: make the same trade and if so what would
481.98s: you make the trade in and until next
483.48s: time be an outlier I'll see you guys
484.74s: later
