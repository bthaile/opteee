0.08s: how did I go from consistently
1.88s: underperforming the market to
3.48s: consistently beating the market well
5.84s: this video is exactly how it's through
8.76s: trading plans strategy outlines and
10.92s: trading logs this is the work of trading
14.56s: so my goal in this video is to walk you
16.20s: through how I approach all of those
18.24s: different tools what's up everybody Eric
20.20s: here welcome back to all the outliers
21.52s: and shout out to the patreon family you
23.24s: guys make content like this possible for
25.36s: everybody else so if what I do helps you
27.32s: in any way consider signing up let's get
29.60s: straight to it so how did I go from
32.28s: underperforming the market really
34.16s: consistently over my first 5 years I
36.20s: think there was one year that I
38.04s: outperformed the market and even in that
40.68s: year technically I was still negative I
42.76s: was just less negative than the S&P 500
45.32s: how did I go from that to where I'm at
47.12s: now where as I look at my performance
49.84s: from 2018 to 2022 this shows my returns
53.16s: on average were 24.6 my compound annual
56.00s: growth rate was actually a little bit
57.48s: lower than that but that's about my
59.56s: compound pound annual growth rate from
61.24s: when I started in 2007 until the last
64.08s: full year in 2022 how did that happen
66.32s: well it is from this from Trading
68.24s: documentation so what's the purpose what
70.52s: are these tools for the first thing is
72.84s: for organization the markets literally
75.60s: have infinite variables you as the
77.96s: trader cannot be another uncontrolled
82.04s: variable the problem with that you're
84.08s: never going to see the same Market twice
85.72s: it'll have you know similarities but
87.40s: it's never the same thing so if you do
89.32s: not have a good understanding of what
92.12s: works optimally when and when you should
95.48s: use different tools you kind of just
97.16s: bounce between things like if you ask
99.28s: yourself right now how did you do 6
101.52s: months ago you might not know but if you
103.72s: don't have good trading logs to go back
106.32s: and look to see then what good is the
109.40s: information that you mastering that time
111.04s: frame if it's only as good as your
112.60s: memory so organization forces you to
115.32s: track these things so that you can
116.80s: optimize over time which that's number
119.00s: four but you'll hear hear me reiterate
120.64s: that a few times it's a thought exercise
122.84s: the second purpose for doing these
124.56s: things is so that you are not building
126.44s: the plane as you are flying it what that
128.92s: means is think about when you are in a
131.08s: stressful scenario when you don't really
133.80s: have a clear plan of action what tends
136.12s: to happen to people some people like to
138.20s: climb mountains I like to build
141.20s: planes in the
143.76s: air if you're in a kinetic scenario
146.40s: people very frequently will freeze when
148.52s: you're in a financial trading scenario
150.68s: from the comfort of your home you still
152.08s: might mentally freeze you still might
153.52s: make bad decisions typically we do when
156.00s: we're under a lot of pressure without
157.48s: any preemptive thought this is the same
159.00s: thing in the Marine Corps if you're in
160.32s: the military you definitely have gone
162.08s: through planning exercises and the main
164.56s: purpose of those planning exercises is
166.36s: to have an idea of what you're going to
168.64s: do but we fully acknowledge that what we
171.04s: end up doing rarely looks exactly like
174.04s: what we're planning but that plan gives
175.88s: you something to go off of because my
178.72s: boy Mike Tyson set it the best everybody
181.20s: has a plan until they get punched in the
183.08s: mouth so the whole idea behind that is
185.92s: we have an idea of what we're doing and
188.08s: then we can adjust as needed off of it
190.88s: but it gives us a starting point and
192.24s: that leads us into planning because I
194.32s: ask my community regularly like hey what
196.36s: what are your trading objectives and I'm
198.04s: actually really surprised how frequently
199.76s: I get really insane objectives or none
201.96s: at all some of them will say oh I'm just
203.72s: trying to practice this strategy what's
205.64s: the point of that like what is the point
207.36s: of that the whole point of trading is to
209.48s: make money if everything you're doing in
212.16s: trading is not in the purpose of making
214.60s: money you literally are wasting your
216.84s:  time that's harsh man so when
219.60s: we're planning out our efforts we should
222.92s: always go back to what is our goal and
225.48s: then make sure everything we're doing
228.08s: serves that ultimate goal sure if you
230.52s: want to learn random things here and
231.88s: there go for it but the whole idea is
233.72s: that it should be pretty specifically
235.64s: designed to move you closer to your end
237.72s: state that should be clearly defined
239.28s: optimiz ation without this it's very
242.84s: difficult to get better as I look back
244.76s: at my returns again using my first 5
246.92s: years they're unimpressive my first two
249.44s: years were negative that's also cuz I
251.48s: started in 2007 but my third fourth
254.44s: fifth year they were all positive but
256.44s: they were like trailing the market by
258.40s: like tenths of a point I wasn't
259.84s: outperforming the market so what I was
262.00s: doing wasn't working objectively and
265.08s: because I started this process of
267.56s: outlining what I think I'm doing via the
269.76s: plans I have my strategies in terms of
271.60s: how I think I'm going to trade my
272.88s: different tools and then logs to
274.88s: validate them I was able to objectively
277.72s: look at the information and say this is
279.76s: not working these things look to show
282.52s: the best promise let me try to develop
284.96s: these further without that we are just
287.20s: running in circles and that leads to the
289.08s: fifth point if you don't go through this
291.48s: process of creating these tools you lose
293.88s: so much time and effort when I talk
295.96s: about things like paper trading one of
297.84s: the beautiful Parts about it is not just
299.72s: to validate a strategy without losing
301.40s: money but it's because you were learning
303.20s: along the way and you're creating a data
305.36s: set I cannot overemphasize that part
308.04s: enough creating a data set drastically
311.00s: increases your efficiency because then
313.08s: it's not a guessing game you don't look
314.68s: at the market and say hey the Market's
316.52s: behaving like XY or Z what should I try
319.48s: next as you build out this toolkit you
322.24s: know what works best so it drastically
326.28s: decreases the amount of wasted effort
328.92s: that you can then feed back into your
330.96s: system again to further optimize and
333.28s: then accountability I'm not going to go
334.76s: through the whole psychology of trading
336.24s: and what that all looks like that's a
337.64s: whole other conversation but suffice it
339.44s: to say that we all have an ego none of
341.32s: us like being wrong and we don't like
344.40s: reconciling when we are at fault unless
347.20s: you get good at it unless you get used
348.72s: to it so accountability in your trading
350.68s: plans via trading logs all of these
352.72s: different tools it forces you to take
355.24s: accountability for the things you can
357.08s: control and to optimize those things to
359.80s: make sure that you are controlling them
361.64s: and fixing them in case they're not
363.84s: working for example if you have a mental
365.88s: stop and then the trade goes past your
368.20s: stop and you don't do anything and then
369.88s: you have this giant loss even though you
371.88s: had that stop written in your trading
374.28s: plan but you just didn't let it go
376.88s: you're to blame you know exactly who
379.52s: dorked that trade up and it's you so it
382.16s: forces us to come to terms with our own
384.36s: performance which is absolutely massive
386.08s: so now that we understand why this stuff
388.28s: so important and why I spend so much
390.52s: time talking about these concepts with
392.36s: you guys let's get into what the trading
393.84s: plan looks like so mine typically has
396.48s: somewhere around 8 sections big sections
399.16s: and then it's just massive now mine is
402.56s: literally like 380 Pages as it sits
405.48s: that's because my trading plan has
407.00s: evolved it's not even I don't even label
408.96s: as a trading plan anymore I label as
410.56s: wealth development it has my real estate
412.48s: stuff in there my Angel Investing stuff
414.16s: in there because what I'm doing in terms
416.52s: of tracking applies to all of my
418.80s: business ventur
419.92s: so these are the primary sections and
421.88s: I'll walk you through each of these so
423.68s: that you have an idea of what they look
425.12s: like so that when you download the free
426.84s: guide at the end you kind of have a jump
428.52s: start on what this thing should look
429.96s: like the very first section purpose and
431.92s: goals there's nothing you know fancy
434.04s: here this is one of the most interesting
435.72s: things about trading in my opinion is
437.44s: that I am by all accounts average all
440.52s: accounts the reason why my performance
443.12s: continually outperforms the market is
446.00s: literally because of structure
447.92s: organization stuff like this I'm not
450.20s: super smart I just make sure that I'm
452.52s: using the best information I have to
455.04s: inform my decision-making so purpose and
457.20s: goals there's two sections to that we
458.96s: have the desired end State this is what
460.72s: we're trying to accomplish in investing
462.72s: in totality and then we have kind of
464.72s: midterm objectives I typically break
466.68s: this out 6 month maybe I don't do that
468.60s: anymore myself but you know you can I
470.48s: used to I used to do 3 6 9 12 but we
473.04s: have short-term objectives so stuff
475.12s: that's less than a year one-ear
476.52s: objectives 5year objectives 10e
478.40s: objectives again inspect what you expect
481.72s: the whole purpose of this is to force
484.08s: you to think through what you're doing
485.64s: and it's funny because my mentor trading
488.04s: Mentor is the one who literally forced
490.32s: me to start thinking about a trading
492.08s: plan specifically strategy outlines that
494.04s: was the main thing he was harping on and
496.12s: once I realized how impactful that was I
498.60s: started building it out into all of
500.32s: these other things I bring that up to
502.08s: your attention because do not get
503.72s: overwhelmed here I'm going to run
504.96s: through a bunch of with you guys
506.84s: don't look at this and be like wow this
508.68s: is so much I don't even know where to
510.68s: start even if you have no clue where to
513.64s: begin this process start right here
516.24s: purpose and goals open up the example
518.44s: that I'm sharing with you guys or open
519.92s: up a blank word dock put these sections
522.20s: in there and just start so many people
525.76s: could literally transform their lives if
529.00s: they just start doing don't let
531.88s: your dreams be
533.44s: dreams yesterday you said tomorrow so
536.76s: just do it and then you can fix fix it
539.68s: as you learn more as you go along you're
541.72s: not going to have all the answers don't
543.24s: worry about all of that what you need to
545.32s: worry about is the mental hurdle of
548.28s: allowing that to not permit you starting
550.64s: something just start so now we know what
552.76s: purpose and goals is this is just giving
554.60s: us guide right what are we trying to do
556.28s: here General market notes this is a
559.60s: large section of my trading plan that
562.04s: walks through a ton of things this I
565.12s: would consider broadly optional for you
567.92s: but there's a couple things in here that
569.56s: I would implore you to include if you
571.96s: would the first thing here I have is
574.32s: structure this literally is how does the
576.56s: market work how do options work I have
578.88s: like an entire section on the history of
580.72s: options you don't have to do all that
582.20s: that's just cuz I'm a nerd about this
585.82s: [Music]
587.76s:  but what you should pay attention
590.12s: to are mechanisms how markets operate
593.56s: that's important AKA what does a broker
596.00s: do that's important for you to
597.92s: understand how does the impact the
599.96s: market how do different economic factors
602.64s: impact the market those kinds of things
604.28s: are good to build out over time studies
606.32s: is exactly what that sounds like I spent
608.00s: a lot of time reading through different
609.44s: things different report outs from the
611.72s: big Banks different studies off of
614.20s: academic papers and I track the outputs
616.80s: of that it's useful for me you don't
618.32s: have to do that this one I do think you
620.12s: need observations this is literally
622.00s: where you just capture what you saw
624.24s: happen in the market and what that means
625.96s: to you the reason why this section is so
628.20s: important is because this starts getting
630.28s: our brain tailored towards Pattern
632.40s: recognition that serves you massively in
635.36s: the long run so I highly encourage you
637.52s: to include that section the next we have
640.00s: this is actually backwards boom we're
642.52s: back at it and it's fixed so what we
644.60s: look at in the third section is analysis
647.16s: so in here I'm looking at things like
649.24s: just how do I think about conducting
651.68s: analysis and for me I actually have a
654.16s: video coming out soon on technical
655.56s: analysis but I'm very interested in
658.08s: having an efficient process meaning I
660.36s: start with really big filters that get
662.40s: rid of most things and then I hone in
665.36s: over time to the best possible tools for
668.08s: me to look at products for me to look at
670.04s: and the reason for that is because
671.12s: there's a lot of things out there to
672.20s: trade but I tell you what you can get
673.64s: rid of a lot of them again as an options
675.36s: Trader if they don't have options boom
676.76s: get rid of a ton of stuff right there
678.12s: stuff like that so my overall guidance
680.72s: here for Section 3A is think about how
683.08s: you can do whatever you do efficiently
685.16s: and then when you look at technical
686.60s: analysis tools fundamental analysis
688.36s: tools I have kind of subsections under
690.40s: each of these I have what tools I use
693.12s: and then I kind of created a library of
695.00s: everything that I've experimented with
696.60s: and that's on purpose the reason being
698.36s: is I'm able to tie things I've tested to
701.60s: an actual note section on outlining what
704.60s: the tool is and then what my experience
707.08s: was using that tool so then if I ever
709.48s: want to go back to the archives and say
711.04s: hey maybe I'll dust this one off and try
712.52s: it again I'm not starting from scratch
714.16s: again I I can literally recall all of
716.68s: these different details and again you
718.40s: could start with the simplest things for
720.24s: technical analysis you could start with
722.04s: trend lines and just write out how you
724.72s: think you will use them this all feeds
726.92s: in and evolves over time so don't get
729.24s: overwhelmed up front and then systems
731.16s: this is actually where I capture known
733.24s: entire trading systems can slim for
735.40s: example that goes into my analysis tools
738.60s: you can put that wherever you want
739.92s: really but that's where I track notes on
743.20s: known developed systems for me to
745.20s: reference that's all now trade checklist
747.44s: super simple this is just where I write
749.48s: out a generalized pre and post- trade
751.56s: checklist the reason why I use the term
753.00s: generalized is because each strategy
755.00s: will have specific things that matter to
757.08s: it that belong in the individual trade
759.32s: checklist but there are things that
760.84s: apply to everything so when I think
762.52s: about generalized pre-trade checklist
764.12s: it's literally things like looking at
765.72s: the broad stock market and seeing what
767.80s: the overall trend is what is the trend
769.76s: of the sector that you want to trade or
772.36s: the stock that lives in that sector
774.56s: what's that sector doing stuff like that
776.24s: is earnings coming up for the product
777.88s: that you're trading are there any
778.92s: announcements all of those kinds of
780.48s: things fall into the general category
782.72s: that apply to literally every single
784.64s: thing that you put on the idea here
786.56s: admin know don't make this massive
788.84s: because if you make your pre and post
790.40s: post- trade checklists too big you're
792.16s: not going to do it you're just not going
793.32s: to do it so make this efficient put
796.12s: things in there that matter to what
797.56s: you're doing but don't put stuff just
799.52s: for the sake of it again because you
801.40s: will lose adherence now portfolio
803.48s: management this is a big section this is
805.48s: where I break down allocations so that's
808.32s: how I put my portfolio into core and
810.64s: speculative I have a video out on
812.52s: portfolio management that talks about
814.20s: this stuff but this is where I get into
816.36s: detail on how do I treat my core
819.04s: allocations how do I treat my
820.48s: speculative allocations how do I
822.08s: allocate money from the entire portfolio
824.08s: into those two buckets how do I think
826.00s: about risk management there's two levels
828.08s: to risk management in my opinion there's
830.00s: the portfolio level that applies to
831.92s: everything you have on your book at a
833.28s: given point in time and then there's the
834.84s: individual trade risk management
837.12s: protocols I Define that stuff here here
839.08s: how I think about utilizing the account
841.04s: and then what metrics I need to track in
843.88s: order to assess my performance in
846.00s: service of this desired end State and my
848.40s: objectives again don't let this stuff
850.48s: overwhelm you if this section seems way
852.80s: too massive way too much stuff going on
854.56s: in there literally just put risk
856.28s: management and think about how you're
857.96s: going to manage risk in your portfolio
859.60s: cuz you need to do that no matter what
861.40s: now let's take a look at strategy
862.72s: outlines you'll notice over here that
864.24s: there's actually kind of a a section and
866.76s: for each strategy outline
869.28s: there are a handful of key sections that
871.88s: I look at this says that there's more
873.72s: four main sections and I actually think
876.48s: that that's correct because there's the
878.56s: executive summary setup management and
880.44s: Analysis this fifth section can be tied
883.56s: either to the individual strategies or
885.64s: later down the line actually in section
887.44s: s which is notes and rfis so this is
889.88s: kind of like a bonus section but these
891.24s: are the main pieces to a strategy
893.08s: outline the executive summary literally
895.32s: is like the assd test this is do you
897.88s: understand how this strategy works it
899.68s: should be three to five sentences in
901.72s: outline exactly how this thing makes
904.28s: money as if you're explaining it to a
905.92s: child this is purposefully designed to
908.52s: just make sure that you have a solid
910.84s: understanding of what this thing is the
912.56s: second section here is the setup so this
914.48s: is what we're looking for how this thing
916.56s: makes money how do we scan for whatever
918.80s: the strategy calls for what technical
921.04s: fundamental analysis indicators are you
922.96s: going to use and what do you need to see
924.96s: from them how do you expect to allocate
927.80s: money to this strategy how do you expect
930.16s: to outline your initial outlay how much
932.68s: money you're going to use up front and
933.92s: then any scaling protocols either in or
936.52s: out all of that should be built out into
939.12s: your setup section management is exactly
941.32s: what that sounds like how do you intend
942.92s: to manage the trade throughout the life
944.52s: cycle there's kind of three main things
946.20s: you can consider there's time bound
948.08s: management there's profit management
950.40s: Loss Management you can start with those
952.00s: sections or you can take a look at what
954.04s: I have here for your own but again this
956.00s: is forcing you to think through how
957.64s: you're going to manage to this position
959.40s: before it goes on even before you like
961.76s: find what's going on for this position
963.92s: you should have all of this outlined for
965.72s: yourself analysis so when we're building
968.16s: out our trading log and we're making
969.96s: sections for each of our strategies this
973.08s: tells us what Details Matter for this
976.52s: strategy for example if I'm trading zero
979.08s: DTE SPX variance risk premium strategies
982.76s: so call it short strangles short
984.56s: straddles zero DTE I really don't care
987.88s: what the onee trend is I really don't
990.08s: care I might care what the 5day trend is
992.80s: or what the average daily range is those
995.08s: might matter to me I also might care
996.76s: about the variance risk premiums IV
998.64s: versus HV but then if I'm trading
1000.60s: something like ratio diagonals I don't
1002.88s: really care about IV versus HP so this
1005.52s: is where we like put down what things
1008.48s: matter to our strategy and how do we
1010.48s: track them this is what's going to feed
1013.16s: our trading log setup later and then
1015.12s: again this RFI tracking section I'll
1017.40s: pull it up over here as well well but in
1019.52s: terms of the individual strategies this
1021.32s: is just what do you want to test for
1022.88s: that individual strategy maybe you want
1024.48s: to try instead of zero DTE 5 DTE maybe
1027.04s: you want to try 14 DTE this is just
1029.28s: where you hypothesize different
1031.44s: permutations of your strategy and then
1033.28s: you test them now in terms of the
1035.40s: broader trading plan this notes and RFI
1038.80s: section I highly encourage you to
1041.04s: actually start with this first one which
1042.68s: is a self assessment sounds super lame
1044.72s: boring esoteric whatever the reason why
1047.28s: this is important is because this forces
1049.60s: you also how do you like that uh Arrow
1052.00s: right there really nailed that didn't I
1053.80s: I'm using the mouse so chill out oh
1055.24s: that's not good either there we go
1056.44s: that's better you must be joking the
1058.60s: reason why this is so important is
1059.92s: because it starts to force you to look
1062.00s: at yourself and start analyzing yourself
1064.16s: if you're going to do this longterm and
1065.44s: be successful guess what you need to do
1067.12s: analyze yourself if you think about the
1069.32s: difference between different Traders we
1071.88s: all have access to the same tools you
1073.80s: have the same platform I do you now are
1075.80s: going to have the same trading plan
1077.32s: outline that I do you're going to have
1078.80s: the same technical analysis tools that I
1080.48s: do so on and so forth yet there is such
1082.60s: a massive variance in performance why it
1086.36s: comes down to the individual to the
1087.92s: trader so this is where we acknowledge
1090.72s: that aspect and we try to find things
1092.96s: that we're good at and then specifically
1094.76s: for our weaknesses we need to make sure
1097.40s: that it doesn't impact our trading and
1099.12s: if it does we need to create known
1101.04s: controls about it so what I mean by that
1103.00s: is if you're impulsive if you go into
1104.76s: things too quickly this is where I would
1106.84s: literally list that out as a weakness
1108.48s: I'm impulsive I tend to do things
1110.28s: without fully analyzing them to control
1112.48s: this I'm going to force myself to
1114.52s: complete the pre-trade checklist for
1117.00s: every position I put on before entering
1118.80s: the trade something like that also in
1120.52s: here is where I'm going to list out my
1122.52s: performance reviews I like to look at my
1124.64s: performance every single month kind of
1126.20s: an in-depth Deep dive so I literally
1128.16s: would just write down you know for
1130.20s: September this is how I did this is what
1131.88s: worked well this is what didn't work
1133.16s: well this is what the market did so that
1134.96s: I have a log of what works when then I
1137.88s: also have kind of this section for
1140.24s: audits this is kind of important to
1142.28s: include because I believe it is really
1145.44s: wise for Traders to embrace external
1148.76s: audits have other people look at your
1151.68s:  and give you feedback if they start
1154.32s: reading through your trading plan and
1155.96s: they're like hey well what do you do in
1157.32s: this scenario that tells you that you're
1159.32s: not defining that quite well enough and
1161.40s: you probably should think through it
1162.92s: because if there's too much variability
1164.72s: in Your Capacity to deploy there's a
1166.68s: good chance that you are going going to
1168.92s: pick route a sometimes route b sometimes
1171.68s: and then you're not going to understand
1173.28s: what works best over the long run now
1175.52s: let's take a look at the trading log
1176.92s: very quickly and then a couple last
1178.44s: things beyond that the trading log for
1180.00s: me is super simple I use Excel you can
1182.04s: use Google Sheets you can automate some
1184.64s: of it if you're so inclined I do but I
1187.00s: really am an advocate of the process of
1189.68s: inputting the trades the reason why I'm
1191.40s: an advocate for that is it gets you
1192.96s: closer to the data as compared to just
1195.28s: porting things over via an API or
1197.56s: something like that now I have the first
1199.60s: tab is just kind of a portfolio summary
1202.36s: and different calculators so that's
1204.36s: actually what this is right here just
1205.88s: literally summarizing the portfolio I
1207.84s: have a binomial tree calculator here
1209.72s: this is kind of like a a workshop
1211.36s: version I'm actually looking at
1212.60s: producing a version of this for the
1213.88s: patreon family that's what this is it's
1215.64s: a work in progress variant of that but I
1217.64s: have things like how the market is doing
1219.52s: year-to date stuff like that and then I
1221.52s: also have you know different calculators
1223.44s: expectancy blah blah blah blah blah this
1224.96s: is something you can build out over time
1226.60s: the reason why I like the portfolio
1228.16s: summary section though which will live
1229.80s: over here is because it summarizes the
1232.76s: key notes from the individual strategy
1235.20s: tabs so the reason why I have individual
1237.28s: strategy tabs is because the things that
1239.36s: I need to track are different and it's
1241.40s: very difficult to combine all of that
1243.32s: into one tab so each strategy has its
1246.32s: own Tab and that's it so all of the
1248.36s: individual strategy tabs then feed into
1250.12s: the portfolio summary and then I have
1252.04s: another section where I run different
1254.12s: studies maybe you're curious how a
1256.44s: 50-day crossover works works and you
1258.68s: start back testing it well don't just do
1261.12s: that and not track what you're doing
1263.64s: because then that data is only as
1265.80s: efficacious as your memory is don't do
1267.76s: that what you should do is consider
1269.24s: something like this like this where you
1272.56s: track the results of your study now you
1275.48s: have a reference point it might not be
1277.36s: perfect it might not be the best study
1279.04s: on planet Earth but it gives you
1280.72s: something again when we're going through
1282.88s: this trading log it gives us an
1284.40s: opportunity to validate strategy
1286.56s: performance we get to see how our
1288.20s: portfolio is behaving and then we get to
1289.96s: test our hypothesis and quantify the
1292.84s: outcome because lots of people have very
1295.48s: Rosy Recollections about how good things
1298.44s: went when really they might not have
1300.36s: gone that well so it forces us to
1302.32s: reconcile that so those are trading
1304.32s: plans strategy outlines trading logs I
1306.44s: talk about these all the time because
1307.80s: they are absolutely pivotal it is work
1309.88s: but it's something that evolves over
1311.56s: time so you don't have to get stuck in
1313.44s: the mud early on start simple and build
1315.52s: on it if you have any questions comments
1317.32s: concerns any anything that you want to
1318.76s: dive into a bit further let me know this
1321.40s: is where Traders are made this is where
1324.44s: people become outliers by doing this
1328.16s: work be an outlier see you guys later
