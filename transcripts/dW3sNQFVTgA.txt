452.00s:  you
456.00s:  you
480.00s:  percent plus lower. So with these defined terms, then we can fill in some blanks, right?
486.60s:  We can figure out what we personally would define as a drawdown. I would first start
493.50s:  though by understanding what is normal market behavior. And the way we can figure out
501.12s:  what normal market behavior is is we can go to a place that provides data downloads. I
508.88s:  don't know if Yahoo Finance does maybe one of you can throw into the chat if they do
513.44s:  where you can download stock data for free. But there's because it used to be, I think
519.20s:  you used to be able to get it from Yahoo Finance. I don't know if they took it down and
522.04s:  I think it might be only one other place that does free data. I'm honestly not sure.
527.24s:  But okay, so James says no longer free last I checked. Yeah, I think there is still one.
531.24s:  I don't know if it's investing.com. You guys, I'm sure can find it. But what we can do
536.84s:  is we can literally go into some sort of data source, free or paid. And we can download
544.28s:  the actual performance data metrics for the underlying that we happen to be looking at.
550.88s:  So we can grab the performance data metrics or something like SPX or NDX. And again, the
555.60s:  reason why I start with these from the market perspective is because of the history. SPX
561.44s:  has been around the longest. So this is absolutely the tool to use in any of these broader market
568.28s:  studies. So then what we could do is we can download that data and then we can create
572.72s:  a distribution plot distribution plot simply looks at all of these individual data points
578.68s:  and these data points that you look at here actually weeks. It's not even individual
583.88s:  days, but we can look at all of these individual data points and then we literally create a frequency
589.24s:  plot. So we say how often is there a move that's zero to 0.5% and so on and so forth.
597.52s:  You can do this for negative values as well and you can combine them. So then you can have
602.76s:  a frequency plot that looks like this where this is your zero line. And then this is your
608.20s:  again, zero to 0.5% on the negative zero to 0.5% on the positive. And they just plot all
617.96s:  the price performance. And what you will find is under the central limit theorem in the law
626.32s:  of large numbers, even things that can be log normally distributed. Once you have a large
631.36s:  enough sample size, they typically become they approximate towards a normal distribution.
635.64s:  So what you'll notice is the curve will look something like this. And one of the important
641.88s:  notes here though is that these tails are fatter than a standard distribution might assume.
648.04s:  The fatter tails corresponds to a frequency. So here your y-axis would be the percent of
656.88s:  occurrences or the count of occurrences. The thing to keep in mind is the majority of the time,
666.28s:  the market will fall within this nice one standard deviation range here. And then the
671.80s:  overwhelming majority of the time it will fall within this nice two standard deviation range here.
676.76s:  And the even more overwhelming amount of the time it will fall within three standard deviations.
683.80s:  However, it will have instances where it moves outside of both of these into four, five, even six
691.16s:  standard deviation moves. Why does all this matter? It matters because of the problem that we're
695.96s:  trying to solve today, which is how do we behave during market drawdowns? Well, the first thing we
701.00s:  have to do and that is define a drawdown. And I can tell you one thing, I personally wouldn't want
706.36s:  to define a drawdown based on this range, meaning where price tends to behave because that's where
713.08s:  we expect price to be. So when I'm looking at something like a market drawdown, that's when I
718.28s:  start looking at outside of one standard deviation moves specifically isolating the lower end of this
726.68s:  distribution because we're effectively saying for this sake of this conversation, we're not worried
732.52s:  if we have an excessive move to the upside. Maybe our portfolios are positioned to take advantage
736.76s:  that we're okay. So we're more worried about when we start to see excessive moves to the downside
742.60s:  outside of an expected range. And depending on the time frame you look at, you're going to get
747.56s:  different measures for what we might consider a drawdown. But in this case, I would argue plus minus
754.36s:  5% that's kind of normal. That's nothing outside the realm of what actively happens,
760.60s:  particularly, again, depending on the time frame that you're looking at. So I think once you start
764.76s:  looking at things that are kind of like 8% plus, this is where you'll find that we start to operate
772.04s:  outside of a normal distribution. We start pursuing larger and larger moves towards the tails.
779.64s:  So when I'm thinking about how we want to manage a portfolio during these different conditions,
787.32s:  when we have 5% moves plus or minus, we don't really care. Again, that's just normal. That's normal
792.68s:  market movement. As soon as we start seeing this move expand, let's call it 8% plus, then we start
802.04s:  thinking of things differently. The reason why I attach a percent move to it is because the way
810.12s:  that I would prepare for these different phases changes. The reason why I have a phased approach
817.80s:  is because there can be instances where the market goes to 8% down, but then rallies back up.
825.32s:  It can go to 10% down and then rally back up. So what I'm saying is these serve as early
831.96s:  warning signals that something different than usual is happening. We don't know what yet.
839.48s:  I've done an insane amount of statistical analysis to take a look at what is the frequency if we
844.92s:  experience an 8% drawdown that it then turns into x% future drawdowns, all of that ad nauseam.
852.28s:  So specifically with the SPX data said, I am supremely familiar with and it's because I base a lot
858.84s:  of ideas off of it. This analysis is important to conduct, especially for you as a trader because it
865.00s:  gives you a ton of insight into how things move. Now for the pro members during the case study tomorrow,
871.40s:  I'm going to talk to you a little bit more about these different thresholds and some of the
876.28s:  descriptive statistics around them because we can use them to preemptively start building our
882.36s:  portfolio to look a certain way based on the probabilities of a subsequent move that's not limited
888.28s:  to just simple descriptive probabilistic analysis such as if we hit a percent drawdown,
894.52s:  how frequently does it go to greater than 8% drawdown? There's other overlaying statistics and
901.32s:  filters criteria that we can add on top of it that give us a much better picture.
906.04s:  So all of that is stuff aside though keeping this at a higher level. Let's now talk about
912.52s:  what this then means. 8% drawdown. It means that depending on how your portfolio is structured,
921.72s:  the market, the undertones of the market is starting to change. Now what it's turned into,
928.60s:  we don't know yet, but we do know it's starting to change. So this means that if you're holding
934.68s:  some sort of just generally long portfolio that when we start experiencing near correction moves,
940.92s:  you kind of have to start thinking about, okay, what's the gameplay in here? Because
944.84s:  I got to do something and depending on what I think the market is going to do, it's going to
950.44s:  look different. Now I want to take a second and I want to talk about the other end of the spectrum.
956.36s:  Like we talked about drawdowns, maybe starting 6 to 8%, then we get into corrections 10%,
963.00s:  then we get into bear markets. Let's take a look at bear markets because this is useful context
969.48s:  for you to have as it pertains to bear markets. And here they are.
977.16s:  You didn't notice anything?
981.32s:  There's really not a lot of them. And you'll notice a couple of traits as we look at these
988.20s:  bear markets. Now one really important note is this is looking at the trading year and that's on
995.72s:  purpose. This is not looking at peak to trough moves in a vacuum. So I have two different ways
1004.60s:  that we can look at this in timestamp it. The reason why I'm looking at it in this context of an
1010.76s:  annual frame is because I think it gives you some descriptive statistics from the idea of
1016.52s:  holding a portfolio. Meaning how long if I start trading might I look at a bear market that could
1023.32s:  be consuming the portfolio. One of the things you'll notice is that as time has progressed,
1028.92s:  the duration of these bear markets on average has declined and so is the severity.
1034.92s:  Why would that be? Well, there's a couple of things you'll notice on this little list below the
1040.12s:  graphs that are useful for you to know. And it's that there are a lot, a whole lot of different
1048.84s:  evolutionary components to the stock market that have happened from the 20s, literally over the
1054.84s:  last century just about. So you'll notice there's eight things that I want to talk about from the lens
1061.80s:  of a bear market quickly. Now this is all going to be part of a video I'm doing in the future
1066.84s:  actually. So you're getting a bit of a sneak peek on some of the stuff. The video is going to talk
1071.72s:  about a little bit more than just the bear markets that will talk about corrections. But
1075.88s:  I think understanding the extreme is useful because it gives us a lot of context.
1082.60s:  So if we think about investor psychology during a bear market, this really impacts people broadly.
1089.40s:  The thing to note is that generally people become really nervous. This is hedge fund managers
1095.56s:  because their jobs depend on their ability to maintain people's money. This comes from high
1101.16s:  frequency trading firms that might have positions that could be going against them or liquidity is
1106.20s:  widening out and they're not able to run their book the way that they might. This is retail traders
1110.84s:  that are watching. There are 401ks or their retirement accounts evaporate. It becomes pretty widespread.
1117.16s:  And if you'll remember, a big part of the stock market is actually the human element. So you can't
1124.92s:  just not pay attention to the psychological factor of what's happening right there across the board.
1132.20s:  The next thing on this list is volatility. Valtility will expand across the board that will lead to
1140.52s:  decreasing of liquidity, which actually serves as a natural breaking function for market declines.
1146.20s:  You'll also find as volatility is coming up as the market is starting to drop,
1151.80s:  uncorrelated returns become more and more correlated. This means that if you're holding some
1157.40s:  sort of diversified stock portfolio, you're following kind of fundamentals. You have eight different
1162.28s:  stocks and eight different sectors. Well, they can start acting a lot like the same thing,
1166.76s:  which is always funny because people build these portfolios in the context of well, I should have
1173.16s:  at least X number of stocks, 15 stocks to decrease my total correlation risk. But during things
1180.12s:  like bear markets, they become generally very correlated. And we've seen this in a lot of different
1186.20s:  instances. We've seen this with equities in gold in the mid 1900s. And a big reason for that is
1194.84s:  people were liquidating gold positions to have cash on hand. So even though the equities were
1200.44s:  dropping and most people will say, well, gold typically is a flight to quality and people are trying
1205.16s:  to move their money into safer assets. Gold even plummeted. And again, it's because people
1209.80s:  were like, shit, I need money. I need cash. I don't need the gold right now. So those kinds of
1214.92s:  relationships can become broken. And again, really important for us to know because if you're a
1222.76s:  trader that's trying to maintain a book that's based on simply diversification of the underlines
1229.80s:  that you're trading, then your correlation approach actually might not withhold the way you think,
1235.88s:  especially as it becomes tested in more severe environments. Next thing, during draw downs,
1242.60s:  we tend to see more bear market. Sorry, during bear markets, we tend to see more mean reversion
1248.68s:  specifically for extended downside moves. So what you'll notice is that when we look at big,
1255.80s:  big changes in names during extended down moves, you still will find bear market rallies.
1263.72s:  Bear market rallies are actually quite robust, meaning they're sharp, but then they tailor
1270.28s:  off pretty quick and then the downside resumes. Things that are more defensive and low beta tend to
1277.48s:  outperform. These are your staples, healthcare utilities. And that's typically because they have
1282.12s:  better cash flow and they're more resistant to recessions, right? That's the nature of staples.
1286.76s:  People need staples. That's where they go and get products to live their day-to-day lives.
1293.48s:  Growth stocks tend to crash because they tend to have higher PE, higher future expectations that
1298.60s:  have now come under fire. And then we have the last involvement of things like central banks
1303.56s:  and broader fiscal policy that tries to intervene. And the tools that central banks and broader
1311.56s:  fiscal policy has to intervene has gotten more sophisticated as time has developed, which is a
1316.60s:  big reason why you see the 2020 bear market literally was one day that then rallied up soon
1323.24s:  thereafter. So this is what inside of a bear market looks like. And again, the whole purpose of
1330.20s:  doing this exercise is so that you at least have a general understanding of what this could look like
1338.60s:  both in terms of severity, which you can see here, in terms of duration both from peak to
1344.44s:  trial and then trial to recovery. So that then we can inform what our approach might be.
1353.32s:  This is one of the overwhelmingly skipped steps by the vast majority of traders because they don't
1361.88s:  want to do this work. But this work is so important because if you don't do essentially what I'm
1370.44s:  showing you here, then you have no idea what you're preparing for or how to adjust your approach
1377.64s:  to be able to exist through it. So this is as always why the step of defining things is so important
1388.20s:  in something I quite literally insist that we do because now we have some ideas on how bear markets
1396.84s:  work specifically. And the reason why I'm focusing on bear markets is because they tend to be a little
1403.00s:  more dangerous to traders than something like a pullback. So the first thing now as we're talking about
1410.68s:  approach is this. What does my portfolio look like and what is my risk profile?
1427.24s:  Here's why this matters because if I'm trading a long futures portfolio that's leveraged to the long
1445.80s:  side as we think about that gradient for drops that I explained earlier, we know that 8% is when
1459.16s:  things start to change, 10% is when we enter a correction and funky market behavior starts ramping,
1468.20s:  and then 20% is when we're actually in the throws of things. If I have a leveraged long portfolio,
1476.60s:  I need to be more ready to act earlier in these stages. Whereas if I'm trading a wheel, a coverage
1485.96s:  strangle, those kinds of things, then I actually can kind of use these as opportunities to do different
1492.60s:  things to the portfolio, meaning maybe scale in a little bit, those kinds of effects. I'm not really
1498.60s:  over underreacting. I can just kind of play it as far as I want. So understanding your portfolio
1505.80s:  structure, not just at what it is right now, but the different ways that you run your portfolio,
1511.32s:  because we can experience these broader drawdowns pretty quickly. They tend to take a little while.
1517.88s:  So what I mean by that is if we take a look at, let me hide this really quick,
1523.08s:  if we take a look at SPX and let's zoom these in now, let's do a three year, now it's a little
1532.68s:  bit longer now, let's do a five year. So if we take a look specifically at the 22, I called the
1540.84s:  22 a bear market. It technically isn't, but I call it that. The reason why it's technically
1545.80s:  isn't is because it was down 19.4% on the year. But if we take a look at even this down move that
1553.32s:  happened during 22, you notice that these are weekly candles. This didn't just like happen like
1559.24s:  that. It takes a little time for it actually to materialize. That's important information for us,
1564.60s:  because it means we have time to act if we're paying attention. So then when we're defining our
1571.16s:  approach, first we need to define what our portfolios typically look like. These are things like
1577.64s:  what kind of strategies are in there. What kind of time frames, especially with options.
1587.80s:  What kind of beta-weighted delta is? This is something like SPI.
1593.40s:  We also care about allocation and utilization. The reason why we care about utilization is because
1607.56s:  this tells us, depending on what different strategies we have, how much more money we have to use
1612.04s:  as condition shift. One of the things that most of you know about my approach by now is that when
1617.72s:  we're sitting near all time highs, I actually tend to be slightly less invested, not massively so.
1624.28s:  But depending on what I'm trading and how much it's moving, I'm not going to be 80%. Let's say in
1630.04s:  the T-Triple Cue's coverage triangle, I'm not going to be 80% equity during that period.
1635.88s:  And it's because I know the way that T-Triple Cue's can move. And if I was that invested during that
1642.84s:  time frame, if there's a pullback, I also know that I'm kind of stuck. There's not a whole lot I
1648.84s:  can do other than sit and wait and just hope that it eventually works out, which is not
1653.80s:  an efficacious approach to trading. So this is your first step. Is to actually look at your portfolio
1660.84s:  and see what's in there. The second step is to actually conduct an analysis of market
1670.20s:  and economic themes. Now this can be done before this, these are essentially interchangeable and they both
1684.68s:  happen in parallel with one another. But the reason for the analysis is to help bolster our internal
1693.56s:  probabilistic assessment of how probable is it that this gets worse. Because again,
1700.04s:  one of the things to remember is as a trader, we should have different phases where paying attention
1704.36s:  in early warning systems. So I'm not sitting here thinking about what am I going to do with my portfolio
1709.16s:  when things are down 25%. Guess what? Way too fucking late. Way too late. It's already happening.
1718.44s:  So you have to be prepared to do things before we get to that step, understanding the opportunity
1725.24s:  costs that will come with it, which we'll talk about. So let's use the current landscape for
1731.08s:  an analysis. It's a great example. The markets have been teetering around a correction. They close
1736.52s:  below it already. And we know that what we did just get the FOMC statement. So the economy still
1741.88s:  looks strong, but there's a lot of holes in the economy. We're seeing unemployment rise a little
1745.24s:  bit. We're seeing the terror of conversation expanding and so on and so forth. So all of that
1750.60s:  leads me to say not that market's crashing, but the same thing I've been telling you guys for
1756.92s:  literally two months now. I think that the market is in a transition period and we have to be
1761.64s:  really careful because I still think that the market can roll either way from this breadth of evidence.
1766.60s:  This is exactly what I'm doing here. I'm analyzing all these different things and I'm coming up with
1771.48s:  a conclusion. Based on that conclusion, I'm going to position my portfolio appropriately.
1781.00s:  So here we need to adjust the portfolio
1787.96s:  to fit our analysis. So here's what this means. With the market as it is now, again,
1796.36s:  using current day as an example, there are a handful of things I can tell you definitively.
1801.00s:  One of them is I do not want to be long lots of small caps.
1812.68s:  I know this. The other thing is I actually don't want to be long
1817.96s:  autos.
1821.64s:  Big part of this is because of the tariffs and so on and so forth. So all I'm doing is I'm
1826.68s:  analyzing what the portfolio currently looks like. I'm seeing how I view the total market economic
1833.32s:  force and then I'm reconciling those two. I'm saying does my portfolio reflect my broader idea
1841.56s:  in understanding about what's happening here. Now this adjustment the portfolio is kind of the
1847.64s:  first step to make sure if this move does become more severe, we're positioned okay for it.
1855.80s:  This isn't the end state here. There's still a couple more steps that are super important,
1860.92s:  but this is the next step to make sure that we are alive throughout the rest of this process.
1866.60s:  Because again, go back to this. If we're leveraged long futures and we get a 15% down move over
1874.20s:  the course of a few weeks, that could send a portfolio insolvent. So the rest is moot. If we're
1880.60s:  too worried about what opportunities we want to take advantage of, if we have no portfolio.
1885.00s:  Well, that's why this is now. And then after this,
1895.96s:  how to profit. So once our portfolio is positioned in a way that's logical,
1901.80s:  given the current market conditions, then we can say okay, my portfolio is set, it's robust.
1909.00s:  If this drawdown continues to expand, my portfolio is well positioned to at least deal with it.
1915.56s:  How can I now take advantage of the current market behavior? Because again,
1920.76s:  on towards the beginning of this, I gave you a list of things that happens, that we know tends to
1925.96s:  happen. So we can trade a lot of those different ideas. So then it turns to what do we think we can
1932.76s:  do to profit from it? And some again, examples from the current market environment. One of them is
1938.52s:  volatility. I am running way more different kinds of SPX volatility capture strategies.
1945.56s:  I told you all not that long ago that I had slowed down on their production. And it's because
1950.60s:  volatility had siphoned out and there really wasn't as much money to be made based on the risk I
1955.08s:  was taking. And it's the exact opposite. Today's a great example. I was trading volatility almost
1959.40s:  all day with FOMC because it's such a lucrative event. So that's one method to profit from the
1967.88s:  current market conditions that have us placed somewhere around that 10% mark.
1975.16s:  The other things that I do in these time frames is I trade things directionally, but I shorten my
1980.60s:  durations and the types of directional ideas that I trade look a lot different. So for example,
1987.72s:  if I'm trading something from a post earnings announcement drift lens, which I do,
1991.96s:  I still will not hold those things as long as I typically would, which a lot of times post earnings
1998.44s:  announcement drift will happen over the next quarter. And I'll show you.
2004.44s:  Let's run a quick scan. And then I just want to eyeball the performance of some of these things with
2010.20s:  you. Do we have a post earnings announcement? We don't. We can build one really quick. It's easy.
2019.64s:  So the first thing for post earnings announcement drift, we know that we want something that's
2023.48s:  at least a few bucks. Normally I would filter this to be at least like 10 bucks, but I normally use
2029.08s:  a lighter filter for the streams and stuff simply because the cheaper stuff can actually provide
2033.72s:  pretty good opportunity for people. I prefer things that have options. So I'm adding another
2039.00s:  filter that I wanted to have at least 500 open interest, which is very, very light. Now the next
2044.68s:  thing we need to take a look at two different things. We need to take a look at earnings.
2050.76s:  So we need, I forgot if it's most recent or latest, I don't remember. One of these will give us
2059.72s:  the correct one of them won't. So let me just fact check it really quick. So we want to do at least,
2066.44s:  we just want to look back over yesterday. Let's see if these look correct. 319,
2073.88s:  19, 19, 18, these look correct. This is great. Okay, good. So then this is accurate so far.
2079.32s:  So this is essentially looking at things that have had earnings in the last day. Now the next thing
2084.76s:  is I want something that has had a gap. Following earnings. So in this case, we want something that
2093.56s:  gaped. We're looking for post earnings announcement drift to the positive for this example.
2098.20s:  So we'll look for things that have had a gap of at least 5%. And then we also need surprise.
2106.20s:  So the last earnings release, we need something that had at least a greater than 0% surprise.
2113.40s:  So nothing fits the filter for this. So all I'm going to do is open up the time a little bit.
2118.92s:  Again, just for the example. Let's move this up.
2123.08s:  I just want to find a name that actually fits the criteria.
2133.08s:  Okay, so something seems off with this.
2139.56s:  Turning surprise last. Let me get rid of this and see if that's it.
2144.20s:  Let's take a look at Sig.
2154.60s:  Yeah, see, oh, no, it's looking at a correct. It had a really terrible surprise.
2158.44s:  It actually missed to the downside. So this is actually looking.
2163.64s:  It's actually looking correct. So this is just saying that right now there are really just
2168.76s:  very few things that are meeting this criteria. Let's look back over the last month.
2172.76s:  I know that there would be something at some point.
2176.12s:  And then if not, I'll just eyeball some stuff.
2178.52s:  Okay, yeah, I will abandon ship on this.
2181.24s:  And let's just take a look at thinkorswim really fast.
2188.20s:  What I want to show you is the type of moves that happen.
2193.24s:  Let's go to the calendar.
2200.44s:  And let's look at something that had good earnings.
2207.40s:  MRVL looks like they had good earnings. Let's take a look.
2215.72s:  They had good earnings, but they fell off a cliff. Let's take a look at some of their previous
2219.08s:  earnings. So if we go back to their December 3rd earnings, you can see that after this massive
2227.72s:  gap, there's this drift that occurred essentially from the 4th of December peaking out to the 24th
2235.00s:  of Jan. So what, like six weeks? One of the things that I noticed for post earnings announcement
2241.16s:  drift in any sort of consumable form for this most recent earnings cycle is that one,
2247.64s:  it's way fewer and further in between. But the second thing is that the duration of the
2254.28s:  positive move is much lower. Now, one thing to remember is you can trade things like post earnings
2260.12s:  announcement drift either to the upside or downside. It's just slightly different criteria.
2264.12s:  But the point here is that I modify my current tool bag so that I can trade things that make the
2272.36s:  most sense given the current market conditions and the suite of things that thus changes with.
2278.76s:  Other things that change is very basic sector rotation strategies. Those come down right now.
2284.84s:  They're not suitable. Things like that. So to summarize what we've covered about managing
2291.88s:  an options portfolio at a high level, and then I want to talk about some specific tendencies quickly,
2298.28s:  is that it's super important to take a look at the actual portfolio. What it's doing,
2304.84s:  we then need to conduct an actual analysis of the market and broader economic themes to inform
2310.84s:  our decision making. Then we adjust our portfolio. This can include things like taking trades down,
2318.28s:  balancing our deltas by adding short deltas to the portfolio if we're too long, or adding long
2325.16s:  deltas if we're too short. This can be done by finding individual opportunities and structuring
2331.16s:  trades off of those, or it can be done via managing the risk via index positioning. So selling
2338.12s:  calls, selling puts, buying calls, buying puts, again, depending on what you're trying to capture.
2343.16s:  One of the things I notice during the profit function here is most of the timeframes that I'm trading
2350.12s:  start to siphon down, and I start to conservatively position my core allocation,
2357.08s:  and then more strongly pivot into my speculative allocation. So that is the general concepts
2366.36s:  about managing an options portfolio during a market drawdown. Any questions that you guys have on
2371.88s:  that? I'm going to pop the door for the way.
2380.12s:  Lauren says the volume on a lot of stocks I watch have been very low recently. That'll definitely
2404.52s:  happen depending on the names. Sometimes you'll actually find certain stocks can get way more
2409.96s:  active now because what ends up happening is a lot of money will siphon out of the more speculative
2418.04s:  names and it'll migrate into the more defensive or safer names, which is a really interesting thing.
2426.04s:  So if we take a look, I'll clear all this stuff off.
2431.64s:  If we take a look at this, this is looking at the different sectors, take a look at the average volume.
2445.64s:  You'll see that the average volume in builders is going down. The average volume in
2451.56s:  XLC, calm services is kind of going down and peeking up a little bit. You can see that for energy,
2459.48s:  it ramped up and it went down, but on average, it's still drifting up. You can see for things like
2466.28s:  healthcare, actually, it's starting to slow down, which is a little antithesis. It's not always
2470.84s:  perfect. Obviously, but then you can also see staples has seen a massive surge and that surge
2476.92s:  really correlates with the broader market drawdown. So this is super common.
2482.20s:  And it's a really tradable effect, actually, to find the things where money, we call it
2488.28s:  flows. So finding where money is flowing into and out of can be really, really effective.
2495.80s:  So I think one of the things to keep in mind with the broader market right now is that
2501.56s:  as the market is in like this decision mode, volatility looks really attractive to me.
2507.80s:  And volatility is still at attractive levels. It's still above 20. So there's definitely a lot
2515.88s:  to do, but the position sizing for me tends to come down and I tend to start throwing more stuff
2523.88s:  out there. There's actually a great example of one of the approaches I use is actually a trade
2531.24s:  that I ran today is in AI. So AI is C3 AI. And the thing that really stuck out to me here is,
2543.96s:  what do you notice about the call versus put volume today? What sticks out to you here?
2549.96s:  There's a couple things that should be really, really drawing your eye in a pretty big way.
2563.24s:  The first thing is, Jordan says it's skewed. It is. That's correct.
2571.40s:  You want to click in a little bit though, because that's where a lot of the information is.
2576.92s:  So the fact that there's big call versus put skew is definitely our first indicator that
2582.92s:  something's going on. The next thing is if you take a look at the actual transactions,
2590.52s:  the unbelievably overwhelming number of these calls were bought. 46% came in at the offer above.
2599.40s:  Of the 2700 puts, the overwhelming majority were sold.
2606.60s:  Interesting. If I take a look at the total call volume today, 91,000,
2613.96s:  against the total call open eye of 300,000, it's almost a third of the entire existing
2621.32s:  OI traded just today. So then that for somebody like me, that draws my eye. Why? And where?
2632.44s:  So then if we come in here, we can see that in the 20 June, there was 37,000 of the 25 traded out in 30 June.
2641.80s:  And then we can also see in 21 March at the 35, there was 36,000 traded, huge numbers traded today.
2649.96s:  So then we can say interesting. It's in those two explorations, 20 June and then 21 March. So let's go look at those.
2657.08s:  20 June here. Take a look.
2662.04s:  The 25s with 37,000 contracts traded. It's 96 times volume over OI.
2669.72s:  Really interesting to me. And then if you take a look at 21 March,
2674.68s:  or I'm sorry, was it 21 March or...
2680.68s:  Yeah, I already forgot.
2686.20s:  Well, it should be 21 March.
2688.36s:  The 35s.
2695.56s:  Here. There's 36,000 that traded today against 43,000. So massive, massive volume
2708.52s:  build out here. It's just interesting. So then you can use these as different trade ideas.
2714.60s:  There's a couple of other steps that I typically follow to take a look at the vol curve and stuff
2719.64s:  like that. But these ideas become very interesting during markets like this, right?
2725.08s:  Where the coverage triangle is kind of mellow, not really doing a whole lot, but this stuff
2729.56s:  can provide really solid returns in the meantime.
2733.88s:  So that's all I got, gang. As always, if you need anything, let me know. Be an outlier. See you
2741.56s:  later.
