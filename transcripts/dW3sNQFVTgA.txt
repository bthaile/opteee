422.00s: you
450.00s: farm
480.00s: percent plus lower. So with these defined terms, then we can fill in some blanks, right?
486.60s: We can figure out what we personally would define as a drawdown. I would first start
493.50s: though by understanding what is normal market behavior. And the way we can figure out
501.12s: what normal market behavior is is we can go to a place that provides data downloads. I
508.88s: don't know if Yahoo Finance does maybe one of you can throw into the chat if they do
513.44s: where you can download stock data for free. But there's because it used to be, I think
519.20s: you used to be able to get it from Yahoo Finance. I don't know if they took it down and
522.04s: I think it might be only one other place that does free data. I'm honestly not sure.
527.24s: But okay, so James says no longer free last I checked. Yeah, I think there is still one.
531.24s: I don't know if it's investing.com. You guys, I'm sure can find it. But what we can do
536.84s: is we can literally go into some sort of data source, free or paid. And we can download
544.28s: the actual performance data metrics for the underlying that we happen to be looking at.
550.88s: So we can grab the performance data metrics or something like SPX or NDX. And again, the
555.60s: reason why I start with these from the market perspective is because of the history. SPX
561.44s: has been around the longest. So this is absolutely the tool to use in any of these broader market
568.28s: studies. So then what we could do is we can download that data and then we can create
572.72s: a distribution plot distribution plot simply looks at all of these individual data points
578.68s: and these data points that you look at here actually weeks. It's not even individual
583.88s: days, but we can look at all of these individual data points and then we literally create a frequency
589.24s: plot. So we say how often is there a move that's zero to 0.5% and so on and so forth.
597.52s: You can do this for negative values as well and you can combine them. So then you can have
602.76s: a frequency plot that looks like this where this is your zero line. And then this is your
608.20s: again, zero to 0.5% on the negative zero to 0.5% on the positive. And they just plot all
617.96s: the price performance. And what you will find is under the central limit theorem in the law
626.32s: of large numbers, even things that can be log normally distributed. Once you have a large
631.36s: enough sample size, they typically become they approximate towards a normal distribution.
635.64s: So what you'll notice is the curve will look something like this. And one of the important
641.88s: notes here though is that these tails are fatter than a standard distribution might assume.
648.04s: The fatter tails corresponds to a frequency. So here your y-axis would be the percent of
656.88s: occurrences or the count of occurrences. The thing to keep in mind is the majority of the time,
666.28s: the market will fall within this nice one standard deviation range here. And then the
671.80s: overwhelming majority of the time it will fall within this nice two standard deviation range here.
677.48s: And the even more overwhelming amount of the time it will fall within three standard deviations.
684.68s: However, it will have instances where it moves outside of both of these into four,
690.20s: five, even six standard deviation moves. Why does all this matter? It matters because of the problem
695.64s: that we're trying to solve today, which is how do we behave during market drawdowns? Well,
700.44s: the first thing we have to do and that is define a drawdown. And I can tell you one thing,
704.60s: I personally wouldn't want to define a drawdown based on this range, meaning where price tends to
710.68s: behave because that's where we expect price to be. So when I'm looking at something like a market
717.40s: drawdown, that's when I start looking at outside of one standard deviation moves, specifically
723.40s: isolating the lower end of this distribution, because we're effectively saying for this sake of
730.20s: this conversation, we're not worried if we have an excessive move to the upside. Maybe our portfolios
735.64s: are positioned to take advantage of that. We're okay. So we're more worried about when we start to see
740.28s: excessive moves to the downside outside of an expected range. And depending on the time frame you
746.36s: look at, you're going to get different measures for what we might consider a drawdown. But in this case,
751.88s: I would argue plus minus 5%, that's kind of normal. That's nothing outside the
758.28s: realm of what actively happens, particularly, again, depending on the time frame that you're looking at.
763.64s: So I think once you start looking at things that are kind of like 8% plus, this is where you'll
769.24s: find that we start to operate outside of a normal distribution. We start pursuing larger in larger
777.72s: moves towards the tails. So when I'm thinking about how we want to manage a portfolio during
785.56s: these different conditions, when we have 5% moves plus or minus, we don't really care. Again,
791.48s: that's just normal. That's normal market movement. As soon as we start seeing this move expand,
798.28s: let's call it 8% plus, then we start thinking of things differently. The reason why I attach
807.48s: a percent move to it is because the way that I would prepare for these different phases changes.
815.16s: The reason why I have a phased approach is because there can be instances where the market
820.84s: goes to 8% down, but then rallies back up. It can go to 10% down and then rally back up.
828.76s: So what I'm saying is these serve as early warning signals that something different than usual
835.64s: is happening. We don't know what yet. And I've done an insane amount of statistical analysis to
842.92s: take a look at what is the frequency if we experience an 8% drawdown that it then turns into
847.88s: x% future drawdowns, all of that ad nauseam. So specifically with the SPX data said, I am
855.48s: supremely familiar with and it's because I base a lot of ideas off of it. This analysis is
861.32s: important to conduct, especially for you as a trader because it gives you a ton of insight
866.60s: into how things move. Now for the pro members during the case study tomorrow, I'm going to talk to you
872.44s: a little bit more about these different thresholds and some of the descriptive statistics around them
877.80s: because we can use them to preemptively start building our portfolio to look a certain way
884.52s: based on the probabilities of a subsequent move that's not limited to just simple descriptive
889.88s: probabilistic analysis such as if we hit a percent drawdown, how frequently does it go to greater
896.52s: than a percent drawdown? There's other overlaying statistics and filters criteria that we can add
903.08s: on top of it that give us a much better picture. So all of that is stuff aside though keeping this
908.76s: at a higher level. Let's now talk about what this then means. 8% drawdown. It means that depending
919.64s: on how your portfolio is structured, the market, the undertones of the market is starting to change.
926.20s: Now what it's turned into, we don't know yet, but we do know it's starting to change. So this means
933.48s: that if you're holding some sort of just generally long portfolio that when we start experiencing
939.88s: near correction moves, you kind of have to start thinking about, okay, what's the game plan here?
943.88s: Because got to do something and depending on what I think the market is going to do, it's going
950.36s: to look different. Now I want to take a second and I want to talk about the other end of the spectrum.
956.36s: Like we talked about drawdowns, maybe starting 6 to 8%, then we get into corrections 10%,
963.00s: then we get into bear markets. Let's take a look at bear markets because this is useful context
969.48s: for you to have as it pertains to bear markets and here they are.
977.16s: You didn't notice anything?
981.32s: There's really not a lot of them and you'll notice a couple traits as we look at these bear markets.
989.00s: Now one really important note is this is looking at the trading year and that's on purpose.
996.52s: This is not looking at peak to trough moves in a vacuum. So I have two different ways that we can
1005.32s: look at this in timestamp it. The reason why I'm looking at it in this context of an annual frame
1011.96s: is because I think it gives you some descriptive statistics from the idea of holding a portfolio,
1017.64s: meaning how long if I start trading might I look at a bear market that could be consuming the
1023.88s: portfolio. One of the things you'll notice is that as time has progressed the duration of these
1030.60s: bear markets on average has declined and so is the severity. Why would that be? Well there's a
1037.40s: couple things you'll notice on this little list below the graphs that are useful for you to know
1042.84s: and it's that there are a lot, a whole lot of different evolution components to the stock market
1052.52s: that have happened from the 20s literally over the last century just about. So you'll notice
1058.68s: there's eight things that I want to talk about from the lens of a bear market quickly. Now
1063.80s: this is all going to be part of a video I'm doing in the future actually. So you're getting a bit of
1068.28s: a sneak peek on some of the stuff. The video is going to talk about a little bit more than just
1073.08s: the bear markets it'll talk about corrections, but I think understanding the extreme is useful
1079.80s: because it gives us a lot of context. So if we think about investor psychology during a bear
1085.72s: market this really impacts people broadly. The thing to note is that generally people become
1092.68s: really nervous. This is hedge fund managers because their jobs depend on their ability to maintain
1098.44s: people's money. This comes from high frequency trading firms that might have positions that could
1104.12s: be going against them or liquidity is widening out and they're not able to run their book the way
1108.52s: that they might. This is retail traders that are watching. There are 401ks or their retirement
1114.04s: accounts evaporate becomes pretty widespread. And if you'll remember a big part of the stock market
1121.08s: is actually the human element. So you can't just not pay attention to the psychological factor of
1129.72s: what's happening right there across the board. The next thing on this list is volatility.
1135.40s: Valtility will expand across the board that will lead to decreasing of liquidity which actually
1143.00s: serves as a natural breaking function for market declines. You'll also find as volatility is coming
1149.40s: up as the market is starting to drop uncorrelated returns become more and more correlated. This
1156.12s: means that if you're holding some sort of diversified stock portfolio, you're following kind of
1160.60s: fundamentals. You have eight different stocks and eight different sectors. Well, they can start
1165.32s: acting a lot like the same thing which is always funny because people build these portfolios
1171.16s: in the context of well, I should have at least X number of stocks, 15 stocks to decrease my
1177.56s: total correlation risk. But during things like bear markets, they become generally very correlated.
1184.52s: And we've seen this in a lot of different instances. We've seen this with equities in gold.
1190.60s: In the mid 1900s and a big reason for that is people were liquidating gold positions to have
1197.56s: cash on hand. So even though the equities were dropping and most people will say, well, gold
1203.00s: typically is a flight to quality and people are trying to move their money into safer assets.
1207.56s: Gold even plummeted. And again, it's because people were like, shit, I need money. I need cash.
1211.48s: I don't need the gold right now. So those kinds of relationships can become broken. And again,
1218.92s: really important for us to know because if you're a trader that's trying to maintain a book
1225.56s: that's based on simply diversification of the underlines that you're trading,
1231.00s: then your correlation approach actually might not withhold the way you think, especially as it
1237.00s: becomes tested in more severe environments. Next thing, during draw downs, we tend to see more
1244.44s: bear market. Sorry, during bear markets, we tend to see more mean reversion specifically for
1249.64s: extended downside moves. So what you'll notice is that when we look at big, big changes in names
1258.52s: during extended down moves, you still will find bear market rallies. Bear market rallies are
1265.08s: actually quite robust, meaning they're sharp, but then they tailor off pretty quick and then the
1272.04s: downside resumes. Things that are more defensive and low beta tend to outperform. These are your
1279.00s: staples, healthcare utilities. And that's typically because they have better cash flow and they're
1283.56s: more resistant to recessions, right? That's the nature of staples. People need staples. That's where
1288.92s: they go and get products to live their day-to-day lives. Growth stocks tend to crash because they tend
1296.04s: to have higher PE, higher future expectations that have now come under fire. And then we have the
1301.08s: last involvement of things like central banks and broader fiscal policy that tries to intervene.
1308.60s: And the tools that central banks and broader fiscal policy has to intervene has gotten
1313.96s: more sophisticated as time has developed, which is a big reason why you see the 2020 bear market
1319.64s: literally was one day that then rallied up soon thereafter. So this is what inside of a bear
1327.56s: market looks like. And again, the whole purpose of doing this exercise is so that you at least have
1333.64s: a general understanding of what this could look like, both in terms of severity, which you can see
1340.84s: here, in terms of duration, both from peak to trow and then trow to recovery, so that then we can
1348.28s: inform what our approach might be. This is one of the overwhelmingly skipped steps by the vast
1359.56s: majority of traders because they don't want to do this work. But this work is so important,
1367.56s: because if you don't do essentially what I'm showing you here, then you have no idea what you're
1374.20s: preparing for or how to adjust your approach to be able to exist through it. So this is as always
1382.28s: why the step of defining things is so important in something I quite literally insist that we do,
1392.44s: because now we have some ideas on how bear markets work specifically. And the reason why I'm
1399.00s: focusing on bear markets is because they tend to be a little more dangerous to traders than something
1405.64s: like a pullback. So the first thing now as we're talking about approach is this.
1417.32s: What does my portfolio look like and what is my risk profile?
1429.32s: Here's why this matters, because if I'm trading a long futures portfolio that's leveraged to
1445.16s: the long side as we think about that gradient for drops that I explained earlier, we know
1456.20s: that 8% is when things start to change, 10% is when we enter a correction and funky market
1465.64s: behavior starts ramping, and then 20% is when we're actually in the throes of things.
1472.84s: If I have a leveraged long portfolio, I need to be more ready to act earlier in these stages,
1482.20s: whereas if I'm trading a wheel, a coverage strangle, those kinds of things, then I actually can
1489.96s: kind of use these as opportunities to do different things to the portfolio, meaning maybe scale in
1495.08s: a little bit, those kinds of effects. I'm not really over-underreacting. I can just kind of play it
1501.16s: as far as I want. So understanding your portfolio structure, not just at what it is right now,
1509.00s: but the different ways that you run your portfolio, because we can experience these broader
1514.12s: drawdowns pretty quickly. They tend to take a little while. So what I mean by that is if we take a
1520.44s: look at, let me hide this really quick, if we take a look at SPX and let's zoom these in now,
1529.80s: let's do a three year, now it's a little bit longer now, let's do a five year. So if we take a look
1537.72s: specifically at the 22, I called the 22 a bear market, it technically isn't, but I call it that,
1544.84s: the reason why it's technically isn't is because it was down 19.4% on the year.
1549.56s: But if we take a look at even this down move that happened during 22, you notice that these are
1556.12s: weekly candles. This didn't just happen like that. It takes a little time for it actually to
1562.44s: materialize. That's important information for us, because it means we have time to act if we're
1566.92s: paying attention. So then when we're defining our approach, first we need to define what our portfolios
1574.52s: typically look like. These are things like what kind of strategies are in there. What kind of time
1582.92s: frames, especially with options. What kind of beta-weighted delta is? This is something like SPI.
1593.40s: We also care about allocation and utilization. The reason why we care about utilization is because
1607.56s: this tells us, depending on what different strategies we have, how much more money we have to use
1612.04s: as condition shift. One of the things that most of you know about my approach by now is that when
1617.72s: we're sitting near all time highs, I actually tend to be slightly less invested, not massively so.
1624.28s: But depending on what I'm trading and how much it's moving, I'm not going to be 80%. Let's say in
1630.04s: the T-Triple Cues coverage strangle, I'm not going to be 80% equity during that period.
1635.88s: And it's because I know the way that T-Triple Cues can move. And if I was that invested during that
1642.84s: time frame, if there's a pullback, I also know that I'm kind of stuck. There's not a whole lot I
1648.84s: can do other than sit and wait and just hope that it eventually works out, which is not in
1653.96s: efficacious approach to trading. So this is your first step. Is to actually look at your portfolio
1660.84s: and see what's in there. The second step is to actually conduct an analysis of market
1670.20s: and economic themes. Now this can be done before this stat, these are essentially interchangeable,
1683.96s: and they both happen in parallel with one another. But the reason for the analysis is to help bolster
1691.80s: our internal probabilistic assessment of how probable is it that this gets worse.
1699.08s: Because again, one of the things to remember is as a trader, we should have different phases
1703.56s: we're paying attention in early warning systems. So I'm not sitting here thinking about what am I
1707.96s: going to do with my portfolio when things are down 25%. Guess what? Way too fucking late.
1714.84s: Way too late. It's already happening. So you have to be prepared to do things before
1721.72s: we get to that step. Understanding the opportunity costs that will come with it, which we'll talk about.
1728.68s: So let's use the current landscape for an analysis. It's a great example.
1733.24s: The markets have been teetering around a correction. They close below it already. And we know that
1739.24s: what we did just get the FOMC statement. So the economy still looks strong, but there's a lot of
1743.00s: holes in the economy. We're seeing unemployment rise a little bit. We're seeing the terror of
1746.20s: conversation expanding and so on and so forth. So all of that leads me to say not that
1753.48s: markets crashing, but the same thing I've been telling you guys for literally two months now.
1759.16s: I think that the market is in a transition period and we have to be really careful.
1762.60s: Because I still think that the market can roll either way from this breadth of evidence. This is
1767.32s: exactly what I'm doing here. I'm analyzing all these different things and I'm coming up with a
1771.64s: conclusion. Based on that conclusion, I'm going to position my portfolio appropriately.
1781.00s: So here we need to adjust the portfolio
1787.96s: to fit our analysis. So here's what this means. With the market as it is now, again,
1796.36s: using current day as an example, there are a handful of things I can tell you definitively.
1801.00s: One of them is I do not want to be long lots of small caps.
1812.68s: I know this. The other thing is I actually don't want to be long
1817.96s: autos.
1821.64s: Big part of this is because of the tariffs and so on and so forth. So all I'm doing is I'm
1826.68s: analyzing what the portfolio currently looks like. I'm seeing how I view the total market economic
1833.32s: force. And then I'm reconciling those two. I'm saying does my portfolio reflect my broader idea
1841.56s: in understanding about what's happening here. Now, this adjustment the portfolio is kind of the
1847.64s: first step to make sure if this move does become more severe, we're positioned okay for it.
1855.80s: This isn't the end state here. There's still a couple more steps that are super important.
1860.92s: But this is the next step to make sure that we are alive throughout the rest of this process.
1866.60s: Because again, go back to this. If we're leveraged long futures and we get a 15% down move over
1874.20s: the course of a few weeks, that could send a portfolio insolvent. So the rest is moot. If we're
1880.60s: too worried about what opportunities we want to take advantage of, if we have no portfolio.
1885.00s: Well, that's why this is now. And then after this,
1895.96s: how to profit. So once our portfolio is positioned in a way that's logical, given the current
1902.52s: market conditions, then we can say, okay, my portfolio is set, it's robust. If this drawdown
1910.12s: continues to expand, my portfolio is well positioned to at least deal with it.
1915.56s: How can I now take advantage of the current market behavior? Because again, towards the beginning
1922.28s: of this, I gave you a list of things that happens that we know tends to happen. So we can trade a
1927.96s: lot of those different ideas. So then it turns to what do we think we can do to profit from it?
1934.04s: And some again, examples from the current market environment. One of them is volatility.
1939.72s: I am running way more different kinds of SPX volatility capture strategies.
1945.56s: I told you all not that long ago that I had slowed down on their production. And it's because
1950.60s: volatility had siphoned out and there really wasn't as much money to be made based on the risk I was
1955.24s: taking. And it's the exact opposite. Today's a great example. I was trading volatility almost all
1959.56s: day with FOMC because it's such a lucrative event. So that's one method to profit from the current
1968.20s: market conditions that have us placed somewhere around that 10% mark. The other things that I do in
1976.92s: these time frames is I trade things directionally, but I shorten my durations and the types of
1983.08s: directional ideas that I trade look a lot different. So for example, if I'm trading something from a
1989.08s: post earnings announcement drift lens, which I do, I still will not hold those things as long as
1996.28s: I typically would, which a lot of times post earnings announcement drift will happen over the next
2000.04s: quarter. And I'll show you. Let's run a quick scan. And then I just want to eyeball the performance of
2009.32s: some of these things with you. Do we have a post earnings announcement? We don't. We can build one
2018.12s: really quick. It's easy. So the first thing for post earnings announcement drift, we know that we
2022.76s: want something that's at least a few bucks. Normally I would filter this to be at least like 10 bucks,
2027.88s: but I normally use a lighter filter for the streams and stuff simply because the cheaper stuff
2032.92s: can actually provide pretty good opportunity for people. I prefer things that have options. So I'm
2038.36s: adding another filter that I wanted to have at least 500 open interest, which is very, very light.
2043.96s: Now the next thing we need to take a look at two different things. We need to take a look at earnings.
2049.24s: So we need, I forgot if it's most recent or latest. I don't remember. One of these will give us the
2059.96s: correct one of them won't. So let me just fact check it really quick. So we want to do at least we
2066.68s: just want to look back over yesterday. Let's see if these look correct. 319, 1919, 18, these look
2075.40s: correct. This is great. Okay, good. So then this is accurate so far. So this is essentially looking
2080.60s: at things that have had earnings in the last day. Now the next thing is I want something that has had a
2087.00s: gap. Following earnings. So in this case, we want something that gaped. We're looking for post
2095.56s: earnings announcement drift to the positive for this example. So we'll look for things that have had
2099.48s: a gap of at least 5% and then we also need surprise. So the last earnings release, we need something
2109.32s: that had at least a greater than 0% surprise. So nothing fits the filter for this. So all I'm going
2117.24s: to do is open up the time a little bit again, just for the example. Let's move this up.
2125.72s: I just want to find a name that actually fits the criteria.
2130.28s: Okay, so something seems off with this.
2139.56s: Turning surprise last. Let me get rid of this and see if that's it.
2147.08s: Dig. Let's take a look at sig.
2150.60s: Yeah, see, oh, no, it's looking at a correct. It had a really terrible surprise. It actually missed to
2159.32s: the downside. So this is actually looking. Actually looking correct. So this is just saying that right
2167.56s: now there are really just very few things that are meeting this criteria. Let's look back over the
2172.12s: last month. I know that there would be something at some point. And then if not, I'll just eyeball some
2177.56s: stuff. Okay, yeah, I will abandon ship on this. Let's just take a look at think or swim really fast.
2188.12s: What I want to show you is the type of moves that happen.
2195.16s: So let's go to the calendar. And let's look at something that had good earnings.
2204.44s: M-R-V-L looks like they had good earnings. So let's take a look.
2215.72s: They had good earnings, but they fell off a cliff. Let's take a look at some of their previous earnings.
2220.36s: So if we go back to to their December 3rd earnings, you can see that after this massive gap,
2228.28s: there's this drift that occurred essentially from the 4th of December peaking out to the 24th of
2235.08s: Jan. So what, like six weeks? One of the things that I noticed for post earnings announcement drift
2241.72s: in any sort of consumable form for this most recent earnings cycle is that one, it's way fewer
2249.00s: and further in between. But the second thing is that the duration of the positive move is much lower.
2257.32s: Now, one thing to remember is you can trade things like post earnings announcement
2260.52s: drift either to the upside or downside. It's just slightly different criteria.
2264.12s: But the point here is that I modify my current tool bag so that I can trade things that make
2272.20s: the most sense given the current market conditions and the suite of things that thus changes with.
2278.76s: Other things that change is very basic sector rotation strategies. Those come down right now.
2284.92s: They're not suitable things like that. So to summarize what we've covered about managing an
2291.96s: options portfolio at a high level. And then I want to talk about some specific tendencies quickly
2298.28s: is that it's super important to take a look at the actual portfolio. What it's doing? We then need to
2305.80s: conduct an actual analysis of the market and broader economic themes to inform our decision making.
2312.28s: Then we adjust our portfolio. This can include things like taking trades down, balancing our
2319.08s: deltas by adding short deltas to the portfolio if we're too long or adding long deltas if we're too
2326.12s: short. This can be done by finding individual opportunities and structuring trades off of those
2332.28s: or it can be done via managing the risk via index positioning. So selling calls, selling puts,
2339.08s: buying calls, buying puts, again, depending on what you're trying to capture.
2343.16s: One of the things I notice during the profit function here is most of the time frames that I'm
2349.48s: trading start to siphon down and I start to conservatively position my core allocation and then
2357.40s: more strongly pivot into my speculative allocation. So that is the general concepts about managing
2367.64s: an option portfolio during a market drawdown. Any questions that you guys have on that? I'm going to
2372.36s: pop the door for the way.
2374.36s: you
2396.68s: Beautiful. Lauren says the volume on a lot of stocks I watch have been very low recently.
2403.72s: That'll definitely happen depending on the names. Sometimes you'll actually find certain stocks
2409.08s: can get way more active now because what ends up happening is a lot of money will siphon out
2416.60s: of the more speculative names and it'll migrate into the more defensive or safer names,
2423.96s: which is a really interesting thing. So if we take a look, I'll clear all this stuff off.
2429.64s: If we take a look at this, this is looking at the different sectors, take a look at the average volume.
2445.64s: You'll see that the average volume in builders is going down.
2450.44s: The average volume in xlc, comm services is kind of going down and peeking up a little bit.
2457.08s: You can see that for energy, it ramped up and it went down, but on average, it's still drifting up.
2464.52s: You can see for things like healthcare actually starting to slow down, which is a little
2469.56s: antithesis. It's not always perfect, obviously. But then you can also see staples has seen a massive
2475.48s: surge and that surge really correlates with the broader market drawdown. So this is super common.
2482.20s: And it's a really tradable effect actually to find the things where money we call it flows.
2488.76s: So finding where money is flowing into and out of can be really, really effective.
2495.80s: So I think one of the things to keep in mind with the broader market right now is that
2502.52s: as the market is in like this decision mode, volatility looks really attractive to me.
2507.80s: And volatility is still at attractive levels. It's still above 20. So there's definitely a lot to do.
2517.24s: But the position sizing for me tends to come down and I tend to start throwing more stuff out there.
2524.60s: There's actually a great example of one of the approaches I use is actually a trade that I ran
2531.80s: today is in AI. So AI is C3 AI. And the thing that really stuck out to me here is what do you
2544.28s: notice about the call versus put volume today? What sticks out to you here? There's a couple things
2551.00s: that should be really, really drawing drawing your eye in a pretty big way.
2562.28s: The first thing is Jordan says it's skewed. It is. That's correct. You want to click in a little
2572.68s: bit though because that's where a lot of the information is. So the fact that there's big call versus
2579.00s: put skew is definitely our first indicator that something's going on. The next thing is if you take a
2585.88s: look at the actual transactions, the unbelievably overwhelming number of these calls were bought.
2594.60s: 46% came in at the offer above. Of the 2700 puts, the overwhelming majority were sold.
2607.56s: Interesting. If I take a look at the total call volume today, 91,000
2613.96s: against the total call open eye of 300,000, it's almost a third of the entire existing
2621.32s: OI traded just today. So then that for somebody like me, that draws my eye. Why and where?
2632.76s: So then if we come in here, we can see that in the 20 June, there was 37,000 of the 25
2639.88s: traded out in 30 June. And then we can also see in 21 March at the 35,000, there was 36,000
2646.28s: traded huge numbers traded today. So then we can say interesting. It's in those two
2653.16s: explorations, 20 June and then 21 March. So let's go look at those. 20 June here. Take a look.
2662.04s: The 25s with 37,000 contracts traded, it's 96 times volume over OI.
2669.88s: Really interesting to me. And then if you take a look at 21 March,
2674.76s: or I'm sorry, was it 21 March or
2680.76s: yeah, I already forgot.
2686.20s: Well, it should be 21 March. The 35s.
2690.68s: Here. There's 36,000 that traded today against 43,000. So massive, massive volume
2708.52s: build out here is just interesting. So then you can use these as different trade ideas.
2714.52s: There's a couple of other steps that I typically follow to take a look at the vol curve and
2719.40s: stuff like that. But these ideas become very interesting during markets like this, right?
2725.08s: Where the coverage triangle is kind of mellow, not really doing a whole lot, but this stuff
2729.48s: can provide really solid returns in the meantime. So that's all I got, gang. As always,
2738.20s: if you need anything, let me know. Be an outlier. See you all later.
