0.00s:  What's up everyone? Welcome back to the LR podcast. We have you and
5.34s:  St. Clair hanging out with his pets and also you have a pretty cool picture of
10.70s:  one up above your head as well I noticed but it looks like you have the the
15.18s:  think tank ready to have a conversation about options trade and a. Yeah looking
20.46s:  forward to it let's go. Sounds awesome. So starting zoomed out zooming in you
26.06s:  and I have talked a few times and I like kind of getting deeper and deeper into
30.44s:  detail. Most people are familiar with your background. I do want to talk a
34.30s:  little bit about your book later retail options trading that you wrote with
37.72s:  Andrew Mac which is a really good read. I was actually set to talk to him. He
41.90s:  was going through some health stuff but I'm set to reach back out to him soon
45.50s:  and also chat with him. But to kick off at a high level thinking about 2024. If
53.10s:  you were to recap 2024 from your own trading and market lens. What sticks out
60.60s:  to you any lessons learned anything draw your attention from last year specifically.
65.28s:  The other thing I really remember is being slightly unusual day was the August
72.38s:  the 5th I think it was the Monday after Japan Japan dropped Sunday night. Yes
79.06s:  the future is what down a lot I think 3% and everyone was like oh my god this
83.50s:  is going to be terrible it's going to be terrible and the next day nothing really
86.26s:  happened to it absolutely bananas right the big to end up to I think mid 60s
90.38s:  in 3 day from I can't remember where it opens like around 20 and I think it
95.30s:  closed in the mid 30s that was a that was a very unusual day it's almost like
102.34s:  and I don't want to be like one of these people who are like the reason this
106.18s:  happened is because there were a lot of shorts concentrated mean more notes
109.74s:  that stuff I mean basically that's a good filter if you're listening to someone
113.54s:  on YouTube or Twitter or something if they start going on about that stuff you
116.98s:  can probably tune out all the other stuff they say to but it was very
120.74s:  interesting the way that VIX massively over reacted yeah but that was the
127.38s:  interesting thing the interesting thing was the S&P VIX went above the NASDAQ
132.76s:  VIX and that happens almost never right like about 2 and a half
138.56s:  3% of the time depending on the lookback period you've got so to me that was
145.12s:  people people ask me like you know what's the right show I love for when I do a
149.36s:  trade what should I be looking for to try and get edge the best way to do it is
154.16s:  to know what something normal is like you know don't think about the abnormal
160.00s:  just become so familiar with how things usually are but then something
163.96s:  different happens you're like oh my god that's that's not right and then you can
169.12s:  look for what's not right and it's sort of a different way of approaching the
172.56s:  world I don't know if you've heard this story about the Chinese man who was
179.52s:  sent to the Jade carving master to try and learn to carve Jade and so every day
186.28s:  the master gives him a piece of Jade and says just hold it in your hand just
193.24s:  hold it that's all he did and I think students like this is ridiculous how
197.80s:  am I learning from this and masters like you know just trust me and after a
201.96s:  year student goes wait this thing you gave me isn't Jade that's what you should
208.48s:  be looking for when you're looking for edge as well you should become so
211.84s:  familiar with the normal situation that abnormal situation like leaked out
216.52s:  and punches you in the face so it's sort of the way I'm to told a detective
224.48s:  looks at a crime scene they kind of look at the whole thing and take it in and
228.72s:  it's like what's not right here they don't look for the thing that's standing
233.52s:  out so much just look for the normal stuff and then like it's kind of like a
238.44s:  where's lolly I guess that thing doesn't fit and I think trainings like that as
242.76s:  well and that was a very good example if you know the relationship between the
247.64s:  Nasdaq Vex and Vex and you see that you've done all the hard work that's
253.08s:  free money and people get to wound up then on but how do I trade it do I do
259.64s:  straddles do I do triangles do I do futures and honestly at the point you found
265.40s:  that dislocation you can do about a million things and you'll make money so
271.00s:  the point is finding that standout situation that's where good trades come
278.08s:  from people get to special options they get to wound up in the mechanics and
281.76s:  the Greeks and all that stuff and should I do three week options should I do one
286.08s:  week options no and that's such a minor part it's not unimportant
291.76s:  to call the little things the little things for a reason right it's that big
297.44s:  first observations where the money is and honestly that's about the only
300.68s:  thing I can remember about last year that was like a I mean obviously other
306.24s:  things happen but that's the standout thing for me that the situations like
311.56s:  that obviously happen all the time if you're looking at enough things in
314.12s:  different areas that was that that was an interesting day well I think the thing
320.56s:  and I actually would like to understand and one fully agree on like the the
326.80s:  Fox finance talking points right like summing up a complex system to a single
331.48s:  tagline is effectively meaningless but when you do see that kind of move that
337.68s:  isn't supported by the subsequent move in the index obviously the high level
343.76s:  summary of that is people expected more than what happened okay great but for
348.40s:  that just looking at spx vix by itself for that kind of spike to occur does
356.20s:  that level of a spike mean anything to you the fact that it shot up that much
360.40s:  on that information well I think it's the difference between descriptive and
366.68s:  predictive like when the VIX does that and the S&P doesn't it's pretty easy to
372.76s:  come up with some story for what's going on and you're probably right it's
376.04s:  probably a vol liquidation event probably a lot of people will be person
382.12s:  trouble and they had to blast out of their VIX position or there are some P
386.00s:  options because otherwise the S&P would have gone down quite a bit for the VIX
390.24s:  could do that on the other hand going forward oh what like how do I trade on
396.56s:  that and that's where the difficult it is and I think I think there's a
403.16s:  tendency for people two things right people have stories and so they always
407.80s:  like to put a release and on top of an activation and in this case that
413.24s:  that reason is probably right but it doesn't mean anything it's kind of like
419.00s:  you know the you see the analysts on NFL Sunday right they know a lot about
423.76s:  football they really do like most of them are in the hall of fame if you think
427.48s:  you know more about football than Jimmy Johnson you're the idiot right he knows
431.72s:  more than anyone ever going to forget but he can't gamble on football at all
436.28s:  like his picks a garbage and it's knowing that kind of information or knowing
444.32s:  why the VIX did that and it's liquidation event or knowing that you know
449.96s:  the stock went up this much on earnings because you know of this line and the
455.12s:  balance sheet so what that's not how you're gonna make money and I think in
462.32s:  most things in life knowledge is very correlated to success but in trading
470.24s:  that kind of knowledge really isn't helpful and I think in a lot of ways it
476.22s:  can be dead from mental because it leads people I don't know I wouldn't say
482.68s:  overthinking but putting like discretionary overlays and filters and stuff
488.60s:  on top of things so I don't know if I want to get into this right now because
495.88s:  it's a long story but I was talking to someone at work about this today and I
501.24s:  think it kind of fits so let's say you've done some back tests right and you've
506.08s:  done all the good stuff and you haven't done overfitting and you haven't got
511.00s:  any free parameters and you've just I don't know let's say the back test is
514.84s:  I'm gonna sell ESMP zero DTE options only open every day and you look at
522.92s:  four years of data that you've got thousand data points and you see the P&L
528.16s:  distribution and you're like right it's a great trade I have an edge or at
532.88s:  least I had an edge in the past I'm gonna do that trade and then you do that
537.56s:  trade for a month right and because I keep telling people they should keep
542.80s:  records see what's going on try to learn what they do and this is completely
550.40s:  understandable is at the end of that month I'll say well I've learned don't do
554.92s:  this trade on a Thursday into half an hour after the open and I don't know
561.00s:  don't do it after two o'clock in the afternoon but they've now essentially come
568.52s:  up with a trading strategy based on 20 observations that's got three free
574.16s:  parameters in it right and their original their original one was so much
579.80s:  better and had a thousand observations and no overfitting and they just
584.16s:  absolutely decimated that by thinking that their knowledge is helping and
590.76s:  because you've added three parameters you're now gonna need like a thousand
595.96s:  divided by square root of three observations time square root of three
601.00s:  observations to have the same statistical evidence as your original system
605.40s:  so learning like that is a terrible idea you know keeping records is really
613.76s:  important doing trades is really important because I will tell you about
616.52s:  execution and it will tell you about intra-trade volatility and I'll tell you
621.28s:  about adverse selection and that's really hard to practice but trying to sort
628.20s:  of improve the edge based on your knowledge based on a month of trading it's
637.88s:  almost certainly hurting you and I think that's where that sort of Jimmy Johnson
642.44s:  level of knowledge hurts you because you've essentially basically decided
648.88s:  that you're gonna completely ignore your real practice and just override that
653.92s:  with free stories because people like stories and you want to learn right
660.60s:  well no that's not true some people do a lot of people don't like learning
665.00s:  they don't like thinking but let's say you do right and you work hard and you
670.12s:  want to learn it's very easy to learn the wrong stuff whereas if you're I
676.24s:  don't know your a physicist you can't really learn the wrong stuff all the
682.84s:  stuff is right might not be relevant but it's all right you don't learn
686.76s:  stuff is good trading is not like that so trading's hard and that's one of
693.96s:  the reasons I think it's hard is you can put a lot of effort in and actually it
697.36s:  hurts you well you bring up another point kind of set it without saying it
703.36s:  that of just the path of the return sample as well and I think that that can be
708.28s:  really confusing to people so dovetailing off of that idea if there is a
714.52s:  trader that did back test in approach and then as they're ingesting new
720.32s:  information how would you recommend or discuss to them different methodologies
725.72s:  to integrate the new information that they're getting into their test
729.44s:  effectively versus just kind of you know using those random changes based on a
734.96s:  super small sample right well if it's about something like that first
739.52s:  election or execution the stuff you're learning is really good it's good
743.12s:  learning stuff right so leave that aside let's say you've got the I think it's
749.32s:  better to get in half an hour after the open idea okay you observing that
754.08s:  means nothing what you have to do is do your test again based on that but then
762.36s:  you have to handicap your test because essentially what you're doing is
767.56s:  introducing a look back bias into your back test right so if your original
772.92s:  back test gave you I don't know making up some numbers right if your back
779.16s:  test gave you a chart of two I would want that new augmented one to give me a
784.76s:  probably a sharp closer to three because every time you're adding something to it
790.32s:  you're making it less robust so you've got to have a really good reason for
797.56s:  thinking why why half an hour what is what does that mean you know you the
803.12s:  reason has to become before the the testing and the statistics otherwise
808.40s:  you'll test a whole bunch of things and you'll find something so the worst
811.92s:  thing you could do in that situation is say well I think 930 what is 30
815.60s:  whatever time don't you're in I think that's the right time oh that didn't work
819.72s:  let's try 15 minutes let's oh let's try 20 minutes and you'll end up coming up
825.32s:  with that ridiculous rule that popular in Indian markets a few years ago I
829.24s:  think it was called the 9.20 travel where you sold a straddle at 9.20 that's the
835.20s:  important thing and that's almost like a red flag right if it works at 9.20 but
840.68s:  it doesn't work at 9.10 or 9.45 explain to me what's special about 9.20 so it's
849.24s:  better to start with you know the observation that 9.20 is special because of
853.92s:  I don't mean it's not in that case and then test that rather than just say
860.56s:  well I've noticed in the three weeks I've been doing this that that was a
864.24s:  bit of time that's where the danger comes so it as you're talking about it I can
873.96s:  obviously follow how you differentiate between descriptive elements when they
879.88s:  matter and when they don't matter but for a new retail trader it like what
884.80s:  you're talking about here I feel would be confusing because in the context of
890.00s:  the VIX spike we say the reason doesn't matter right it's just the observation
894.16s:  that this is abnormal and then in this case we have an observation that is
898.48s:  abnormal but now the reason does matter I fully by the way agree with you and I
902.16s:  follow your logic but how would you lead a basic trader to reconcile those two
907.76s:  instances well I think the the VIX thing the single observation that the VIX went
914.48s:  up when the S&P didn't that doesn't really help me but if I'm watching the VIX
919.84s:  and I say oh my god the VIX is above the NASDAQ mix that's a prey I'm
924.16s:  eating a why that's happened I know that that happened like 2% of the time in
929.04s:  the past I mean so that's a great opportunity and it's not dependent on what's
933.84s:  going to happen to the VIX in the future because the VIX did this it's just
938.80s:  it's a straight-mean reversion that relationship is wrong so I think a lot of
944.80s:  things can be based on analyzing distortions and things that are
952.16s:  usually true right and I can't tell you what those things are because I don't
957.20s:  know exactly how you trade but like in my world
961.84s:  I'll look at the ratios of the volatility between all the index indices you
966.96s:  know like recently the the Dow has been out of whack relative to
971.44s:  everything else doesn't really help you because they don't trade on the same
975.92s:  degree of liquidity but it's an observation look at the relationship between
980.64s:  the VIX and the VIX there's a very strong relationship between those two
985.84s:  they and then they get stretched that's usually a sign that the VIX
990.16s:  itself is the thing that's going to revert back
994.64s:  the VIX is a volatility measure right those they had the money volatility
999.52s:  what's the relationship between those two what happens when that gets out of line
1003.92s:  um there's the skew index and you can get the skew from the risk reversal
1010.32s:  what happens when they get out of line so all those sort of things or even as simple as like
1015.76s:  I don't know um the five-year ten-year yield curve usually behaves like this
1022.48s:  and basically all of these things are mean-reverting traits right I'm saying
1026.96s:  this relationship is so strong when it gets out of line it's going to come back
1032.24s:  the VIX VIX thing it's telling you you know the VIX is cheap relative to VIX
1038.80s:  you want to sell VIX options and buy the VIX that kind of thing um
1045.04s:  so I think I think the best way to do it is to look for relationships like that
1051.28s:  and I think looking for a single signal to forecast a single thing like what does this mean
1058.56s:  for the VIX going forward uh I don't know that's a difficult question but what it looks like to me
1064.40s:  is the VIX versus the NASDAQ VIX is crazy I couldn't tell you the VIX is crazy the VIX
1069.12s:  goes crazy your time right that's not a trade I'd want to do just purely based on that
1074.80s:  um I think knowing what these relationships are that's that
1083.20s:  and I story about the J right that I held the J for a year you're not picked this up overnight
1090.80s:  right they're the sort of valuable things for you to learn looking at those things it's not like
1096.32s:  overlaying lines on charts it's actually doing statistics on things that are related
1101.60s:  that's a useful thing um so yeah I can't really remember the second part of the question you
1108.00s:  asked no it's it's completely okay I think you you hit it during that but it opens a follow-on
1115.36s:  question we know that the world of trading obviously is difficult multivariate and sometimes
1123.12s:  traders can go through paths where things they might be observing or seeing might not actually
1127.68s:  represent reality but we obviously need to see things in order to understand and build these
1133.12s:  relationships to find distortions or a newer trader that can't really tell the difference between
1140.64s:  those two do you have any ways to help navigate that yeah come up with the simplest thing you can
1146.72s:  come up with um like especially people with technical backgrounds like engineers they try to
1152.64s:  engineer the market or they try to engineer their system so they will take the observation
1160.32s:  zero-bq option throw the price and instead of saying well the simplest way to do that is I'm
1164.96s:  going to sell a straddle every day they will say well what if I sell straddle when the S&P's
1171.28s:  above it's 200 day moving average or what if I sell a straddle when the VIX is above this and they
1176.96s:  keep adding more and more stuff onto it and every time they do that they are taking the risk that
1184.08s:  they're putting one of the curious orchard things on I mean it's very unlikely that all the
1189.84s:  things are putting on are actually meaningful it's quite likely none of them are meaningful but
1194.88s:  people want to over-improve something that works so they want to take something that works and
1202.16s:  gives them a sharp ratio of one and be like okay I'm going to work on this until I get to be a
1206.72s:  sharp ratio of two that is very tempting but it's the wrong way to do it the better way to do it is
1214.16s:  come up with something completely different might also have a sharp ratio of one and now you're not
1219.92s:  going to find perfectly anti-correlated things but they don't have to be perfectly anti-correlated
1225.36s:  you know instead of just selling zero DCE options on the SPS maybe sell them on the cues as well
1233.84s:  maybe sell them on IWM as well and people will be like well those things are 100% correlated
1240.08s:  but not you know they might only be 80% correlated 80 and 100 and not the same thing and they
1247.12s:  really do help so I would say keep things way simpler than you think you should and also
1258.24s:  real eyes have a good idea of how much money you can expect to make and what runs profile you can
1266.40s:  expect you know that the number of people who think they can make 1% a week a scholarship you know
1273.36s:  unless you've got a really miniscule account or you're really lucky one percent a week means you're
1280.16s:  as good as gym assignments think about that for a second right that's like you're taking up both
1286.32s:  and you're going to be as good as Rory McElroy at the end of the year I mean that's just not going
1293.52s:  to happen but if you take up both and say you know I want to have a 25 handy cap in a year well you
1298.72s:  can probably do that you know if it works you can probably do that equally with especially with
1304.64s:  options people are like well I want to collect the risk premium but I don't want to lose more than
1310.00s:  three times when I make one an average price it's like yeah I want to do that too but if you
1316.48s:  cap your losses that aggressively you're not going to make any money so what you're telling me is
1321.20s:  you want a risk premium but you don't take any risk like the risk premiums only there
1327.12s:  because you have more balls than the person who's buying the options from you and if you don't
1334.32s:  if you don't like the risk profile well that's not great for you so I guess that's the sort of thing
1341.52s:  keep it really simple I mean don't find something else that's also really simple and don't
1349.12s:  don't try to especially with risk premium right you kind of have to just accept that it's there
1357.20s:  timing risk premium is really hard like there are things if you want to time the market there are
1364.88s:  things you could time but if you think you're going to time be volatility risk premium or time the
1373.44s:  equity premium so you're buying dips as if if you can do that you shouldn't be doing that
1381.68s:  because it means you're good enough to apply those methods for something else that will make
1386.24s:  you a lot more money like Warren Buffett right fictional investor but he's only beating the S&P by
1394.72s:  a couple of percent a year on his good years so unless you've got a massive account all the amount
1401.84s:  of effort you have to do to beat the S&P by two sendage points I mean you're probably better off
1409.44s:  getting a job at Starbucks you think of it as an income dollar per hour the amount of efforts
1415.44s:  you're putting in so if you can do all that do it on something else like predict stuff where the
1423.04s:  predictability is higher like I don't know future spreads right really strongly mean reverting look
1429.52s:  at five years ten years two years and the interest rates very strongly mean reverting there's a
1434.88s:  definite pattern there apply all your climbing hopes and dreams to that and then you know if it's
1441.60s:  working fine it's the same technique you can apply to the stock market but don't start with the
1448.00s:  hardest thing put first you know start easy because there's no you don't get extra points for
1455.52s:  doing the hard stuff you know the guys who made all the real money on the floor with the guys who
1461.20s:  found that easy loophole they weren't the guys who tried to solve the hardest problems
1469.28s:  this echoes something I've heard you mentioned before and it's something that I've always
1474.16s:  thought about in some different settings this idea of like focusing on your strengths like the
1479.92s:  market is the kind of place where it tends to benefit people who focus on their strengths obviously
1484.64s:  if to fix like gross deficiencies but you're not compensated quite as well for you know bringing up
1490.72s:  deficiencies to be your future strengths over your trading career how did you find your trading
1497.36s:  strengths um okay so I'm going to do that really annoying thing people do where I'm going to go
1504.00s:  back into that question a little bit before I answer that next question yeah I love that good
1508.72s:  you might have to remind me of that last bit I got you what I said there is very much applicable
1514.88s:  to you if you're a solo trader or you're trading in a pod at a fair um because then you
1523.68s:  you can avoid the things you're bad at right you don't have to do the things you're bad at
1530.24s:  but if you're part of a team in like a real big trading firm or a bank you don't have those
1539.52s:  choices to make sometimes you will have to do the things you wouldn't want to do so
1544.56s:  you know you might not be any good at computer programming but if you're a quanted a bank you're
1549.76s:  going to have to do computer programming so you're going to have to fix that whole so it's a little
1556.56s:  bit different the things you need to be good at be a retail as opposed to institutional so bearing that
1565.52s:  in mind um I don't know how I found my strengths to be honest I don't think I did I think other people
1573.76s:  did because they put me in situations as I was working for other people and I think they put me
1579.36s:  in situations where I could make them the most money hence I began to realize that these were
1585.28s:  the things that I could do which were valuable in the market so I think it's often easier for other
1592.32s:  people to recognize what you can do than what you think you can do because what you want
1598.88s:  what you think your strengths are probably highly correlated with what you want them to be
1603.84s:  um so yeah I don't think I really sat down and said you know what I'm good at that's what I'm
1609.76s:  going to do I think it was my boss at the time saying why don't you go and do this so but I was lucky
1617.68s:  because my first boss who I'm still really good friends with um he was really good you know he gave
1626.88s:  me a lot of leeway to do stuff and with strengths comes weaknesses one of my weaknesses is I'm not
1632.88s:  very good at grinding stuff out because I tend to get bored and going to want to do something at
1638.40s:  all of this and so he was very good at putting me in a situation where I could do that do projects
1644.08s:  here and there go on to the next thing go back do this and that so I was very lucky and I think to
1650.88s:  be honest anyone in any career has to have a bit of luck like that you know you could have put
1657.20s:  exactly me in that same time with a different boss and things probably wouldn't have worked out
1665.76s:  you know there's a lot of luck involved and I think being able to find a mentor like that is
1671.04s:  exceptionally important and I'm not going to be able to tell you how to do it so I don't know
1676.32s:  I think a lot of it's just luck um you know there'll be plenty of people on LinkedIn
1682.32s:  I'll tell you what's about having a big network and blah blah blah but those people who are always
1686.64s:  networking going to events and stuff not just a moan the big thing about someone you want to
1693.28s:  mentor is you like them and those people those LinkedIn type people like it's someone like them
1700.32s:  but to me they're just annoying well I feel like it's also really superficial relationships there too
1705.68s:  right because you kind of know what's going on I'm networking just to network and that's a much
1710.16s:  yeah shallower style relationships but to your earlier point it does sound like if you do a good
1715.28s:  job keeping a trading log in like good documentation you can at least get some sense of your potential
1722.64s:  strengths obviously you need a large enough collection period but that could be maybe a spot to
1728.40s:  start for something like that now yeah and I think people I think that people are looking
1736.40s:  too much at the numbers that that's keeping track of and I'm trying to learn what those numbers tell
1742.96s:  them in terms of age and stuff I kind of see it now as much more of a kind of a meditation
1751.28s:  like thing kind of you put yourself in a situation where you're thinking vaguely about the market
1757.44s:  but not about any specific thing that's sort of how ideas come to you like I mean it's to cliche
1765.52s:  right but I'll often have ideas in the chat because I've just got up I'm still thinking my
1770.96s:  subconsciously about what I was thinking when I was asleep I'm getting ready to go to work
1776.56s:  I sort of think back to things I was thinking about yesterday but got stuck on I think it's
1781.28s:  that kind of process like when the market closes I really enjoy that half an hour afterwards
1786.72s:  where I'm just writing down you know this strategy made this amount of money I did this many
1791.44s:  trades got as many fields my average film quality was this and this I just like doing this before
1797.92s:  the open as well like half an hour before the openness great you know you're like going through
1803.68s:  your little procedures it's like being a pilot right going through the checklist and you're
1808.32s:  excited you're about to get to do something you like so that's way more fun than like one o'clock
1814.24s:  in the afternoon like in a day like today when I'm just sitting around waiting for the day to end
1820.00s:  work it's just read some stuff played games with Sudoku don't care about the basketball I just want to
1827.36s:  get home but before the market's open and after it's closed that little bit of time I think
1833.76s:  that's important the more you think out the market the more you're going to have
1841.28s:  subconscious thought processes help so I think I'm a bit more of a believer in that stuff that I
1847.84s:  used to be what's something that you used to firmly believe in with respect to markets that you've
1857.44s:  kind of found to be not accurate okay so I wrote a blog on this recently on whole no it was on a
1871.04s:  private discord thing that was stuff from my first book which I no longer believe or it's
1878.96s:  certainly not to the degree I believed it a lot of that was kind of technical stuff like
1886.32s:  I don't believe the sampling distribution of all utilities particularly important
1890.96s:  I don't believe it's as important to be really good at hedging as I used to think it was
1897.28s:  that kind of thing I think for options trading the big change I've made is in volatility forecasting
1910.00s:  I used to think it was the basis for every trading strategy now I can I still do it but I don't know
1921.44s:  that I really benefit from it at all anymore I think all those garch models and so forth I think
1928.88s:  most of that is priced in most of the time and when you see a thing like the VIX asdex VIX when you
1936.64s:  see something like that blow out the actual specific model you're using to measure volatility or
1944.24s:  that relationship doesn't really matter because it's such an extreme event so it's like if you're
1950.88s:  looking at all these different stocks right and you want to see the one that has the most
1954.16s:  overpriced volatility the best forecast for volatility in the world might say volatility should
1961.60s:  be 20.1 you know a really simple model might say it should be 21 you know but if volatility is 22
1971.60s:  in neither of those cases would you do a trade but if volatility was 30 you'd do a trade no matter what
1979.04s:  you know so I think if you're looking for big distortions you can now because you know 20 years
1987.12s:  ago there weren't nearly as many things to trade and you couldn't sign up for some scanner for like
1993.04s:  20 bucks a month you know all that stuff's out there now and if you're looking for big distortions
1999.68s:  having a really good time series model I mean I just probably wouldn't bother with it at all to be
2006.96s:  honest I don't think it's really going to make you any money anymore. It leads to a broader
2014.32s:  not like philosophical question but definitely thoughtware question I definitely notice throughout
2019.52s:  my life that people that tend to do things longer longer tend to continually simplify like what
2026.80s:  they're doing and get really good at staple components of whatever that thing is whether it's
2033.76s:  things in rugby whether it's in trading jiu jitsu like a lot of these things I see that
2039.12s:  people have been doing for a long time it really does seem like over their careers things become
2044.88s:  simpler and it sounds almost similar in a way to what you're doing at a higher level what do you
2052.96s:  make of that trend is that something that you agree with or disagree with and if so what's your
2059.12s:  observation I think it's probably true but I think part of it is because a lot of the
2069.92s:  experience is a thing right and intuition does build if you're trading some if you've been
2076.00s:  trading like for I don't know how long I have now 30 years or something there's a lot of stuff that
2081.60s:  I kind of just know because I've been doing it so long and that matters but I might not be able
2089.44s:  to explain it to someone when I'm actually just teaching them they come day one because I might not
2094.00s:  even know that I know that so I think sometimes when you see that process is simplified it's because
2100.64s:  of there's a lot of that complex knowledge behind it that is now implicit rather than explicit
2106.80s:  but I do also think you do simplify things because you realize the important things more
2112.88s:  like at the beginning you have to do your best what you should always do your best right at the
2120.00s:  beginning you have to really try to be really good at every part of the process because you don't
2125.12s:  know what the more important parts are so I definitely think that's a factor as well so like when
2133.76s:  I said about hedging right and I'm talking about dynamically belter hedging and no one who's not a
2140.24s:  market maker should be doing this anyway but I just don't think it's as important as I used to
2147.12s:  think it was so that would now be it would be something you do still I'd have an algo for it but
2151.92s:  it would be down the list of things and it would probably never get to the top of the list of
2156.88s:  things I have to improve because it's just not the most important thing so I think that's
2163.60s:  also the effect as well so yeah you make it's funny you reference your original book I was reading
2170.56s:  that not too long ago just kind of poking through it a lot of the stuff that you produce at least
2177.36s:  from a writing perspective it seems that there are maybe some elements that you could argue could
2184.16s:  be geared more towards an institutional side of things whether it's market making or something else
2189.52s:  and then obviously there's clear material directed towards the retail side of things right
2193.68s:  and ergo your latest book for sure what like why those two different audiences for you why do you
2201.28s:  write materials for both of them it wasn't a plan the first book came around because someone was I was
2210.80s:  talking to someone who was an editor and she said I said there are no good books for professional
2217.44s:  options traders and she said what are you right one and so that was a book basically aimed at
2225.52s:  market makers because it was all about dynamically hedging complex positions oh by the way I don't
2234.56s:  believe any of that stuff about psychology in that book and I don't really believe a lot of the
2240.88s:  stuff about sizing in that book either but that's way more what I don't believe about that's way
2246.32s:  more nuanced and really criteria and it's really important in a different way then the second
2254.08s:  book was like okay I think Nathan Burke's got the job right up at a introductory book and then the
2259.36s:  third book was much more on the on the buy side it was like quantitative traders for quantitative
2267.20s:  traders you literally want to positionally trade but you're not dynamically hedging you're doing
2273.12s:  big bets you want it to be a low-punch bet so it's a different thing so I guess each one kind of
2282.56s:  aligned with what I was doing at the time the last one didn't that just sort of happened by accident
2290.56s:  really it came about because first we'll retail's been huge over the last five years
2296.88s:  growth of retail options trade and I think it's the most important thing that's happened to the
2300.64s:  industry ever I think it's fantastic I think a lot of professional traders but I hate gatekeepers
2310.24s:  in anything but it strikes me as very odd that you could be a professional trader and not think
2315.04s:  it's a good thing when your industry is expanding but that book came about largely because I'd
2322.56s:  been booking to Andrew through DMs and privately and stuff for a long time and I always thought
2333.36s:  I always thought in general retail could bring ideas from outside the industry you know because
2340.16s:  at a certain point everyone in the industry has read the same books they've gone to the same classes
2345.04s:  you don't get new ideas from those people so my idea was retail can bring you stuff and Andrew's
2351.92s:  really has done that like I've learned a ton from him so that book really came about as a we were
2362.16s:  just trying to sort of throw down the conversations we'd had and someone on Amazon said it looked
2369.52s:  like it'd been rushed I wouldn't say it was rushed but it was definitely done in a hurry and because
2375.68s:  we didn't we wanted to put it down the hurry specifically we wanted to get it out before the election
2381.60s:  because we thought there'd be a lot of opportunities then we didn't quite make that I think we got it
2386.16s:  out two days before which is probably pointless for people but we wanted it to be kind of an immediate
2393.76s:  thing certainly not as polished I don't like the writing in it but I think the ideas in it are
2401.12s:  really good so there's another I can see that person's point on Amazon there's another person who
2406.80s:  wrote that there's nothing new in there that guy's not going to make it because literally the entire
2414.56s:  section about finding inefficiencies is completely new it's never been done anywhere in any book on
2421.28s:  anything any other kind of trading so we that was largely Andrew by the way but we were really happy
2427.92s:  with that but other than that yeah the whole thing is kind of a mess because if you want to talk
2433.52s:  about options you've got to talk about Greeks you've got to talk about implied volatility but we
2438.88s:  didn't want to write 50 pages on those things before you get to the next thing so it's all jumping
2445.92s:  round and it's not going to be your first book right it shouldn't be and I think we say that
2452.08s:  start but so I don't really like it as a book but I think the contents excellent well
2459.04s:  even off of the point on there's nothing new in there I can definitely see the non-dessurning
2467.28s:  readers experience if they've read your other books and they just saw similar topics for some of
2474.16s:  the things that you covered in your other books but I actually noticed a lot of variants in even some
2481.12s:  the topics that I've seen in multiple of your other books so yeah it's you've seen this more
2488.32s:  than I have but there's never a shortage of critics I always would point to those people and say
2493.76s:  where's your book I would love to read it I think people have this idea that you know they sometimes
2502.16s:  I get questions it's like I read this book in this book what am I reading next and at a certain point
2507.76s:  I mean you've read the stuff you need to read right just start yeah now reading about trading is
2514.32s:  not trading right it's like you can read a lot of books on rugby eventually you've got to go and
2520.24s:  play a game so I think people always think there's another secret there there's another thing
2526.16s:  they should know and after a certain point there really isn't particularly with the mechanics
2531.04s:  of options I mean what do you want me to say about gamma you know it's there it's all being said
2539.68s:  yeah I mean it's always really tempting when you get a critic like
2544.08s:  I don't think criticism if it's valid criticism right but when someone does something that's
2549.44s:  clearly more of a reflection on them in the book like you know I don't know what to tell you or as
2556.96s:  you'd say it's a sooner someone who isn't very discerning you know I mean as soon point you
2564.00s:  can't care about those people too much either because their opinions really don't matter right yeah
2569.76s:  well tends to be lazily informed one of the things that I find interesting with respect to
2580.00s:  sizing is you go into the concept of continuous Kelly which is I actually think is really really
2587.12s:  pertinent because a lot of people just you know viewed in the binary sense and then also overlaying
2592.08s:  that with fractional because regular Kelly can be a little bit scary are there other optimization
2599.44s:  models that you think are worth loosely exploring with respect to sizing and risk outside of Kelly
2606.96s:  yeah I think there are lots because Aaron Brown who was the risk manager at AQR
2618.00s:  finance professor been around forever notes everything he won't say that Kelly is the optimal
2624.16s:  solution to a problem that no one actually has and that what Kelly does is it will maximize your
2633.20s:  long run runs no one really is around for the long run in that sense right people really even if
2644.24s:  they think in long run terms they won't have more money in five years than they do now and Kelly's
2651.20s:  not going to guarantee you that you can have the best edge in the world and Kelly might take you
2656.48s:  a thousand dollars down to one cent before it goes ballistic and makes tons of money so I think
2663.92s:  you have to start with the concept behind Kelly that if you have more edge you bet bigger you have
2670.88s:  more risk you bet small smaller you should bet proportional to the size of your account
2678.64s:  but there's a lot of other things you've got to sort of overlay on that too like you have to
2682.56s:  have an idea what's the probability of me finishing up at the end of year because especially if
2688.16s:  you're an institutional trader that's what you want because if you finish down you're not going to
2693.28s:  get a bonus and you're probably get fired so having a probability based model of probability of
2701.68s:  making money in a certain time that is a valid thing to look at optimizing as well and I talk about
2709.60s:  that in the first book but unlike I called Sid Brown the problem with that is as you get close to
2717.12s:  that time period at the end we're going to end up taking massive bets if you just follow his
2724.40s:  his rule so you have to sort of put a whole bunch of caveats on that one as well and the other
2730.32s:  thing is you don't want your money to go from a thousand to down to one cent so you have to incorporate
2737.28s:  some sort of risk control and Kelly doesn't have that because Kelly's like look the risk control is
2743.52s:  you've asked me to throw your bankroll I'm doing exactly what you asked me to do now don't tell me
2751.60s:  that it's too volatile that's a problem this is what you asked me to do so you've got to put something
2756.32s:  on top of that that's also kind of based on Sid Brown stuff I talk about that in the positional
2764.40s:  trading book basically what I do is I split my account into a risky bit and a safe bit and then I
2772.80s:  go full Kelly on the risky bit and I rebalance between those so I've always got typically 90%
2779.28s:  in the risk free bit so that gives you a big upside possibility but you're not going to lose more than
2785.76s:  10% so it's kind of setting a floor and I prefer to do that than use a fractional Kelly
2794.48s:  the guys who used fractional Kelly it goes back to the blackjack guys they they have a hard stop at the end
2804.24s:  of each trip you know they have a bankroll for that trip so they've always kind of got a risky part
2813.20s:  and a safe part as well so everyone always says no one uses full Kelly people don't really use
2821.68s:  fractional Kelly either you know you've got your house right you're not
2827.12s:  mortgaging everything you own to put in your trading account and then go full Kelly on that
2832.72s:  so your house is like out of the safe part of your bankroll so anyway that's what I do
2840.16s:  so I think you don't have to use Kelly but if you don't understand it you really haven't thought
2847.84s:  deeply about sizing now when you're thinking about the general trajectory for a trader you
2859.36s:  mention one thing that I'm always I don't know I'm not shocked by but I see it where
2865.28s:  it feels like when I talk to newer traders they have a lot of things that they want right like
2871.52s:  they want a good return they want really consistent returns they don't want big drawdowns they
2876.72s:  don't want to spend a lot of time and so on and so forth right when you're talking with traders
2882.40s:  trying to guide them into like the right mindset when it comes to like even how to approach this
2889.04s:  problem what kind of expectations to even have how do you approach that I don't know is there a
2898.80s:  trading problem or is that just a life problem you know because I think if you talk to someone who
2904.64s:  was I don't know a cabinet maker right but tell you I want to make the greatest furniture in the
2911.04s:  world I want to sell it to these people I want to own as chain of stores I don't want to work on
2916.88s:  Sundays I mean they've all got multiple goals as well so I'm not sure that's entirely a trading
2924.64s:  specific thing the thing that I think is most important though is you've got to have a very
2933.68s:  good understanding of the edge you've got and the natural variance that comes with that edge
2941.76s:  because you can't take an edge and then put a stop on it and keep all the good stuff so you've
2948.16s:  got to first before you do anything in terms of risk control or drawdown or anything you've got to
2953.28s:  have a really good idea of before I do any of that stuff what does the distribution of my results
2959.36s:  look like and you have to be basically happy with that distribution and then like with selling
2967.04s:  straddle say then you can be like well okay I don't want to lose my house so what is the absolute
2976.00s:  maximum I can lose and I don't mean oh I'd be sad if I lost three times the straddle I mean
2984.56s:  the market doesn't care if you're sad or not right but it's legitimate to say if I lose 30 times
2991.28s:  the straddle price I'm in a bit of a problem so having that idea of knowing the natural distribution
2999.20s:  and then putting in a catastrophic edge that makes sense and then you can calculate how much
3004.64s:  am I throwing away by doing that and then you see is it's still worth it so I think basically
3013.92s:  you're not going to get all that stuff until you really understand the edge first because
3019.60s:  everything comes from edge that's funny and I I think people want to sort of wrap up that edge
3029.76s:  in a risk profile they like as well and that's not always the case in terms of that other stuff
3036.96s:  you don't want to work too hard you do all that just from an attitude standpoint if you don't
3045.68s:  think about this all the time you're probably not going to be good enough right because there are
3051.92s:  people out there who think about stuff all the time so sometimes you'll find a trade you know like
3059.12s:  I don't know I saw options over the weekend that takes two minutes but I'm not doing it because
3065.04s:  it takes two minutes I just happen to find that because it's like anything right go back to my
3070.56s:  cabinet maker you don't become the best cabinet maker in the world like kind of wanting to do it
3076.40s:  you become good because you really that's what you do it's not what you do it's what you are right
3082.96s:  now the other thing though is if you're really good you're probably not going to want to not do it
3087.36s:  very often but also if you're really good you're going to end up with money and money is going to
3093.60s:  buy you the ability to do lots of different things like that as well right you can have you can
3098.16s:  employ someone at that point watch your trades you know you can employ someone which means you can
3103.68s:  take three weeks off in the summer and go somewhere else so making money takes care of a lot of these
3110.08s:  problems but I'd be very wary of someone who said I don't want to put too much time in I think
3117.76s:  most people I know who are good put too much time in you know because they're always thinking about it
3125.68s:  probably not always in a really productive way yeah and I imagine that's got to be the case
3132.72s:  from like a professional side of things right because it's what you do I think the path for a lot
3140.08s:  of retail traders is it's something that they try to do in addition to like a standard profession
3147.44s:  so understanding that paradigm and I know that we're coming up on time here
3154.48s:  how would you walk one of those traders onto like a realistic target right because obviously to your
3162.64s:  point they're not going to be able to fit everything exactly how they want and you know continue
3167.68s:  to do this other stuff but obviously they're also saying well can I do this as like a supplement
3172.72s:  or can I do this to help me grow what kind of like realistic guidelines or targets or just ways of
3178.56s:  thinking about it would you give somebody like that well first I'd be very careful about are they
3185.60s:  doing this because they really want to do this and it's like having a hobby that'll make them some
3189.60s:  money like learning how to play daily fantasy sports or something because you like it and you
3197.84s:  might make some money that's a good thing if you're doing this to supplement your income that's a
3202.24s:  really bad thing because income is like a steady stream of money trading is very much not
3209.60s:  so if you need that money from trading you should not be trading drive a number or something
3217.84s:  after that there are very low touch ways of trading so you can certainly be have a full-time job
3226.32s:  and still do this stuff a lot of the most successful trades I've got are overnight right so you put
3233.68s:  them on the clothes cover them in the morning and you're pretty much done so that'll be like 15-20
3239.60s:  minutes trading you know there's earnings trades like that there's the weekend trade overnight
3246.32s:  things not as all these things go through ups and downs right but those things are all very low
3251.76s:  touch and even if you want to you can't adjust them because the market's closed which is actually
3258.40s:  another good reason like good is because you can't over complicate them and fuck them all up
3264.96s:  so there's that and there's also a lot of other options trades kind of evolve at a fairly low
3272.40s:  frequency you know like buying options before earnings you know you buy them two weeks before and
3280.24s:  you just let them go let them breathe you'll do better with that if you go to your day job and just
3286.72s:  take them once in a so I think in a lot of cases a lot of these kinds of trades you're probably going
3295.28s:  to do better if you aren't like fully on the more the time so I think it's definitely possible
3303.12s:  in that regard and it sounds like one of the main elements there is like
3307.60s:  it in approach it something more so to your lifestyle and what can work like to your exact point
3317.52s:  right like if somebody's not able to check the phone during the day if you're trading an overnight
3321.68s:  thing that you can take off in the morning then that seems to fit the broader requirements that
3326.16s:  they have obviously there's a drawback do that it's not fully going to be optimal necessarily but
3331.68s:  it's something that Bradley fits yeah I just emphasised people to start find trades that have
3339.20s:  edge and then ask yourself can I do this trade so whether that's for capital adequacy or the
3346.96s:  attention you can give it or whether you can psychologically deal with it or whatever
3353.76s:  don't say you know what I need a trade that's this and this so I'm going to do this you've got to
3362.56s:  start with the edge and then ask yourself can I do that you know like oh you think it's scary selling
3369.04s:  options okay but buying options is just you can lose all your money so just because something
3375.12s:  scary doesn't mean you can automatically just do the thing that isn't scary like that's the
3380.08s:  wrong way round what it means is you if you think it's scary to sell options and that's fine
3386.24s:  it just means that trade's not for you what go and go and find another trade amongst all the
3391.60s:  hundreds that have edge that is for you so as long as you start with that process this trade will
3399.44s:  make money is it a trade I can do you know because like I don't know capital structure arbitrage
3405.92s:  that makes money but it's not a trade I can do because you know I can't trade convertible bonds
3411.52s:  at billion dollar clicks so there's plenty of things out there and you then will find that
3417.60s:  not for you so you just have to keep looking but it always starts with edge don't start with
3424.40s:  your other requirements your other requirements are not unimportant but the market's not that
3432.32s:  you have right okay we are nearly at time I'd one one other question at a curiosity you
3439.68s:  obviously spend a lot of time specialing in volatility have you tinkered or explored with
3446.72s:  I hate the term it's so cringeworthy but you'll know what I mean like different kinds of options
3452.56s:  flow like if you're seeing things like big volume over OI or like those kinds of things have
3458.40s:  you tinkered with those and if so what's your experience um yeah I have um there's some acronym for
3470.40s:  it like essentially it's a volume wasted a volume wasted open interest by strike right so you're
3480.88s:  and it does have limited predictable power for the stock going forward it does but the bad
3493.52s:  inference from that is to say well I'm gonna book for poll walls or big hedging things and that's
3500.56s:  like the only game in town it is an effect but it's a minor effect and usually it's not an effect at
3508.88s:  all times it is like around expiration you'll see pins to strikes and stuff so that it's a real
3516.08s:  thing I think the dangers when people think it's a really important real thing and what they're
3522.08s:  really telling me is I who am not a professional trader know more about how options should be
3529.92s:  hedged than Susquehane you know all those guys do all day is hedge options so I'm there is a way
3539.60s:  of the world right now which will tell you you know experts know the least about any problem which
3546.08s:  I would have to disagree with I want to buy no you know I'm an expert um but yeah it is an effect
3554.32s:  um and it also there is if you're doing very high you know minute by minute trading you can sometimes
3567.28s:  see a big options trade and piggyback on that like a big call buyer but the problem is it's
3575.36s:  actually quite difficult to know if it's a call buyer or a call seller you know you've got to
3580.16s:  actually be looking at the order book level and see who initiated it how long it was on the order
3587.20s:  book all that kind of stuff it's not easy to do that kind of stuff I think I'd probably put that
3593.84s:  down in the it's a it's a thing but is it the thing you should be doing not the easiest thing
3601.60s:  you know I'll do the easiest stuff first make sense awesome last question then we'll get you out
3608.48s:  of here you have your new book it's available pretty much everywhere right like I've seen it online
3614.88s:  all over the place retail options trading with um injure mac do you have anything else in the pipeline
3623.04s:  any more books we can expect uh I doubt it I said when I finished my well I haven't anything to write
3632.40s:  like I only wrote this because Andrew wanted to do it um so if he wants to do something else I'd
3639.04s:  be happy to do it just for the amount of stuff I learned from him okay so I'll proud I'll proud him
3644.72s:  I've got a few papers I'm working on but nothing on the book side yeah but you should talk to him
3651.60s:  most of the really uh innovative different stuff in that was from him so he's got a really
3660.40s:  interesting way of looking at the market it I could see it and one of the things that was
3665.44s:  actually kind of fun is compared to the people that I don't know I just hate people that bitch about
3670.32s:  stuff without like good cause because I actually found both of your writing styles fascinating
3678.08s:  like you literally could immediately tell when it's a switch in some of the like the actual sections
3683.92s:  and you can kind of pick up some of the context about how you both just view things so I'm
3690.00s:  I'm actually really looking forward to connecting with them I had a chance to talk to him just a
3693.60s:  little bit he seems absolutely awesome so um yeah I'll definitely look to bring them on and then
3698.80s:  for your for your papers are these going to be like published on SSRN or where do your papers
3704.72s:  tend to land um but yeah I mean they'll probably end up on SSR in first um I mean you can any
3711.76s:  idiot can put anything on there so typically you dump something on there and then go through the
3716.08s:  whole referee in process which takes like six months yeah I mean they submitted something I don't know
3722.08s:  last September and it's still going through the process and that's not uncommon I didn't realize
3728.00s:  the lag was that much though I mean that's oh it could be over a year easily yeah that's like no one
3735.44s:  reads journals anymore everyone reads the pre-prints and then we're getting in the journal is kind of
3741.76s:  a validation but no one reads the journal first it's all pre-print stuff yeah well awesome you
3750.64s:  and absolutely awesome to hang out is there anywhere that you want to send people to obviously I'll
3754.56s:  throw a link to the book but anywhere else that you want to send send people to check your stuff out
3762.88s:  I'm on LinkedIn like technically I hardly ever go there because I don't understand why anyone
3767.76s:  wants to it all seems pretty boring and you can find me if you go to a whole technical blog
3773.68s:  I usually write something very non-technical you know once a week yeah very short very non-technical
3780.72s:  you know like 7800 words yeah I'll throw a link to all those for everybody but in the meantime
3786.96s:  as always it's a pleasure I know that sometimes you'll say that you don't know what to talk about
3790.96s:  but I always find stuff interesting um in your perspectives refreshing they're fun so thank
3796.24s:  you for taking the time to hang out thanks so what interesting talk do again have a good
