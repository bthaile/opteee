0.00s: What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I got my friends
5.92s: from Duneberg back on my favorite green chicken. I think maybe the only green chicken that
10.28s: I'm aware of, but welcome back to the podcast. Great to have you. Eric, great to be back with
15.04s: you. So it's been about a quarter since we've spoken last and maybe like a lot has happened
22.84s: also not. I guess there's always a lot happening, but I thought it would be cool to start with
27.84s: looking back at 2023 and from your purview as a whole, two things. First, what stood out to you
36.24s: in two? How did things progress against expectations for you? Great questions. And first of all,
43.12s: great to be back with you. I always enjoy our conversations and it's going to be a fun one today.
47.60s: The thing that jumps out to us in 2023, first and foremost, is the lack of a recession in the US.
56.16s: I think the consensus view heading into the year was the Fed couldn't raise rates at the speed
64.24s: with which they were attending to without destroying the economy. They're going to raise until they
67.84s: break something was the common knowledge on Fin Twit and in much of the punitive class of which
74.48s: were a charter member. So that's meant not as a derogatory term. And also I think there was
81.76s: consistent or sort of as an auxiliary observation to that, there was this view which we held up
87.36s: that the US was probably reaching its capacity to produce hydrocarbons and the shell patch would roll
95.36s: over. And the big aha for us during the year is neither of those materialized. The US kept producing
103.60s: record-breaking month after record-breaking month of oil and NGLs and natural gas and even
109.84s: exported a record volume or value of coal. And also the US did not slip into a recession. And
118.24s: as an analyst, when you get something raw, what matters most is what you learn from it.
124.48s: And the difference between an analyst and an advocate is an analyst seeks to understand, as opposed
129.44s: to an advocate seeks to be proven right. And we pride ourselves on trying our best to be analyst.
134.32s: Look every time you make a call, you'd like to be right. But when you're not right, that's a really
138.80s: amazing opportunity to learn. And one of the rare big sort of aha's in the second half of 2023
144.08s: was connecting those two dots. The US did not go into recession precisely because it is a
150.40s: hydrocarbon-producing powerhouse. The shell revolution has added 2.5 Saudi Arabia's to the US
158.56s: energy mix. The vast majority of which is trapped and or used here, which feeds a pretty decent
165.76s: manufacturing sector unlike other petrol states who just have the commodities to rely on. The US has
170.88s: all manner of downstream manufacturing chemicals and other motives and fertilizers and you name it.
176.40s: And today at $1.65 from the UNB2 natural gas, natural gas is selling in the US for the energy
182.00s: equivalent price of $10 a barrel oil. And if you plug 2.5 Saudi Arabia's into a manufacturing
187.68s: sector, it's unlikely even at 5% interest rates that that economy is going to suddenly go into a
193.52s: recession. And I think that was a big aha for us. I still think the vast majority of analysts
199.60s: don't really understand the critical role that energy plays in the economy. The view energy is
204.00s: just another input into the economy. We have a different view. And that was the big story of 2023.
212.00s: The US kept smashing. I mean smashing production records for natural gas and oil and petroleum
219.28s: with record refinery runs. Cheap coal. You mix all those things in with elite universities, all
226.16s: of the deep water ports and river systems and fertile farmland and all of the other inherited
232.80s: damages that Peter Zahane will tell you makes America great. That's pretty tough,
238.48s: pretty tough to overcome if you're in the recession camp, which we were in. And so having gotten
244.24s: both calls wrong, we decided to try to understand why. And so that was the big sort of second half
250.08s: saga for us. Yeah, I have one of your posts pulled up over here. It's called Atlas Won't Shrug. And
257.04s: there's a section here that follows the thread that you're literally just talking about. And it says,
262.88s: quote, energy is not an input into the economy. It is the economy. Can you expand on that?
270.24s: Yeah, if you go on to read the rest of that post, it says humanity organizes its economic activities
276.40s: to ensure a steady growth in the extraction and exploitation of primary energy. Because energy is
281.76s: life. Standards of living are defined by how much energy is available to be exploited. And most
287.36s: importantly, all humans ever are perpetually seeking a higher standard of living. And when you,
293.52s: the introduction of that piece, we catalog a parade of catastrophes that have occurred since
299.20s: the 1970s. Nixon took us off the gold standard. And the Shah of Iran was overthrown. We had the
306.88s: young people war in between. And the embargo against the West Biopakken. The 1980s brought the war
314.48s: between Iran and Iraq. And then of course, Saddam Hussein evaded Kuwait. And we had a million
320.96s: troops in the Middle East in short order. We had the Asian financial crisis. We had the
327.68s: rubble default in the late 90s. We had the connected long-term capital management collapse as a
333.92s: consequence of the rubble default. Not 11 happened. The war on terrorism. We destabilized Syria. We
340.88s: destabilized Libya. All manner of negative consequences. Afghanistan collapsed. We had COVID. All of
347.44s: these things happened in the last 50 years since Nixon took the US off the gold standard. And yet,
353.60s: as we showed in the piece, the total primary energy consumed by humans grows in an upwardly
361.52s: sloping gentle sine wave. And it's because all humans ever want a higher standard of living. The
368.48s: human endeavor requires an ever-increasing amount of primary energy. And so it shall be. And this
376.16s: is our big aha. The further we were grass from that primary energy upward sloping sine wave,
383.44s: the quicker we'll snap back to it. And this of course was a response to a series of pieces that
389.44s: we've had when we wrote a piece that we thought was kind of a throwaway piece called Pichipo's
393.60s: Amit late last year that it stirred up this ordinance nest of angry response like we were kind
399.92s: of shocked. Like those people who have tied their entire life identities to this concept. And
405.52s: we come at this problem from an above ground chemical background with 20 years experience in the
411.12s: industry. And this concept of Pichipo, I mean, it's just, you know, these are ultimately technopesimists
418.16s: who underestimate the human potential for ingenuity. I feel bad for such people because they've
424.00s: literally tied their livelihoods to it. It's not coming. It's not going to happen. We'll figure it
427.84s: away. We always have and we always will. One question I have for you on that energy
434.24s: consumption thread is you're saying that it's tied to standard of living. Have you analyzed or
442.32s: thought about the tie to an expanding population versus standard of living or vice versa?
448.16s: Oh, sure. So you could do these very famous charts and we've done them where you plot energy
453.28s: use per capita versus GDP per capita. There are no rich countries that are energy poor.
461.28s: And in fact, ultimately energy is the economy as we say in the piece. And look, the human
466.56s: endeavor is a constant, unrelenting struggle against the forces of entropy, disorder is spontaneous.
471.76s: Right angles do not appear naturally in the environment. In order to have a high standard
478.48s: of living, you need to impose order on your local environment and it by the law of thermodynamics
483.92s: necessitates that you must harness primary energy and ultimately waste heat. You can't like
490.88s: to balance the energy equations in order to have order, you need to waste heat.
497.12s: And the economy is basically one giant heat wasting machine. You know, abandon your
503.76s: house for a year and you get a sense of the forces of entropy. Your home requires constant
509.04s: maintenance. Check the roofs, make sure like no animals are getting into it and cut back the
514.80s: shrubbery and all of the things that go into running your home. Painting the exterior,
519.84s: all of this stuff. You do these things because left on its own your house would eventually
524.80s: devolve into a chaotic mass. Whereas order is the opposite of chaos and to create and maintain
534.24s: order requires a constant stream of primary energy. And if you look at the global south and you
540.40s: ponder the fortified billion people currently living at seventh, sixth or fifth of the energy that
546.96s: we use here in the west, all of those people would love nothing more than to be able to waste as much
553.36s: energy as we do. And I mean waste in the most neutral sense. You can't have order without wasting heat.
560.00s: And who are we to deny them? This prospect that the world is just going to do without, I think,
568.56s: is fundamentally anti-human. How do you decipher the relationship between energy as a contributor
576.24s: to standard of living versus something like technology or is energy a feat to technology in your
581.44s: perspective here? You can't have technology without energy. What's powering the server rooms,
585.92s: like what's powering the data rooms? Who is literally providing the food to the brilliant
591.76s: entrepreneurs and programmers and startup founders and so on that are creating all of this
597.36s: amazing technology? That's why energy is different. Energy is different than labor because you can't
604.56s: have labor without energy. The people working need to eat food is the derivative of energy.
609.52s: Clean water is a derivative of energy. And so during times of energy abundance,
616.56s: we have excess energy. Energy can be reasonably well modeled as an input into the economy like all
622.56s: the others. But during times of energy crises is where this, you know, where there's a shortage of
626.96s: energy. And look, if you just take a step back, we know that if all goes to $200 a barrel, what happens?
633.92s: We trigger recession. We know that Germany screwed up its energy policy. It's deindustrializing.
638.40s: It's in the middle of a recession. The UK doesn't produce hardly any of its own energy.
642.24s: There's a victim of the energy crisis. It's in a recession. If the lack of energy
648.88s: is a catalyst for economic malaise, what does it mean in the US to have added to an
655.12s: a half Saudi Arabia since 2010 to it mostly its domestic energy mix? Have you been to Saudi Arabia?
661.12s: Like the sidewalks are paved and cold. When you are in energy superpower, you're wealthy.
668.24s: And then when you're in energy superpower, who has forward integrated world-class manufacturing
674.40s: base to feed that advantageous energy to all the homes in the US that are heated with natural gas
680.32s: or heating their homes at unbelievably cheap prices today, all of the cogeneration facilities
686.08s: that are heavy manufacturing centers across the US are experiencing windfall cost reductions
692.40s: compared to their global competitors. You plug two and a half Saudi Arabia into a pretty
696.72s: strong manufacturing sector with all of the other geo advantages that we described earlier.
701.28s: It's very hard to imagine why it would be that a recession would suddenly
704.56s: inspauntany some materialize. And we got it wrong. Let's understand why we got it wrong.
709.28s: I think we have a pretty good theory.
710.88s: I think the interesting part of that theory though, at least to me, is you guys have a lot of
717.52s: expertise. You guys have a fair-sized team. I don't know how big your team is obviously, but you have
723.20s: a lot of smart people as the punchline. And it's interesting to me that you guys seem to come across
729.68s: this last year as compared to the some other time when you guys were analyzing the prospects of
735.52s: recession. What do you think led you guys to coming up to this concept last year versus some
740.96s: other period in time? Look, the Fed raised rates from 0 to 5% in the snap of a finger and nothing broke.
749.76s: And I could tell you that if you were to ask us that in 2022, we would have said things would
754.64s: break. They didn't. So I think as an analyst, if you're a content creator in the finance
760.96s: energy world, and you produce that the volume and cadence that we do, you're going to get some
765.68s: things right. We've got a lot of things right. I'm proud of the things we've got right. We got the
769.44s: sanctions right, for example, from the earliest days. I think that's one of our best calls.
773.68s: But you're going to get some things wrong. And how you react to the things you got wrong is the
777.28s: defining characteristic of your team. We intend to be doing this for decades. So what happened
783.28s: in late 2023 and even now as GDP prints came in hot and jobs reports came in hot. The people that
793.76s: were in the recession camp many of them found ever creative ways to try to figure out how this data
798.96s: was wrong or fraudulent. And to me, that that reeks of advocacy, not analysis. I mean, at some point
806.48s: you have to trust some data, does the government massage the data for political reasons sure?
811.52s: But like there is a manufacturing construction boom going on in the US. And in the next two job
816.56s: prints, we're going to see ever increasing manufacturing jobs as those construction projects wrap up.
822.16s: And the people who are going to work in those factories, you know, start checking in.
828.88s: If you get something wrong, you have to try to understand why. And that's how you get better.
833.04s: And if you're stuck on insisting that every jobs report is made up.
839.04s: Oh, look at the part-time versus the full-time or look at the seasonal adjustments and so on and so on and so on.
846.24s: I think you can very quickly, you know, lose the chance to learn something.
852.96s: And so we're always more than willing to be wrong as long as we learn. We have a philosophy here.
858.32s: And we're putting out a piece a couple of days from after we're recording this called
863.44s: Lucense where you know every 30 to 40 pieces related to look back at what we wrote and see what we got
869.12s: right and what we got wrong and admit our mistakes and explain to our subscribers why we made them
873.68s: and what we learned from them. I think this is very healthy. You know, we intend to be in this business
878.64s: for decades. And the only thing worse than being wrong is having no view. So long as you are
886.08s: willing to show your homework and to authentically embrace why it is that you got something wrong so
891.84s: that you can implement that mindset of continuous improvement. And that is one of our brand ambitions.
896.88s: Our long-term subscribers know this is always how we have behaved and how we intend to continue to
901.84s: behave. And I think it's pretty healthy. It's a great way to be because that way you don't need to worry
908.96s: about what if I got something wrong. Because if I got something wrong, it's just going to be an opportunity
912.16s: for me to explain to our subscribers what it is we got wrong why and what if we learn from it.
916.56s: So our mistake management philosophy has four parts. Mistakes shall be rare admitted to corrected
923.68s: and learned from. It's just that simple. Yeah and that makes a lot of sense to be clear. I'm not
929.68s: harping on whether the any call is right or wrong to be honest from from my perspective the idea of
936.48s: judging the merit of something based on right or wrong is at least in this context with economic
942.64s: systems that are like wildly complex. That's less interesting to me. The part that I was really
948.88s: honing in on there was what do you think led to you guys coming across this change last year compared
956.32s: to another point in time. And it sounds like the summary of that was the rate change environment was
962.00s: very unique. And that's that was the catalyst for the assessment there. The lack of a follow-through of
968.72s: a recession once the rates were hiked so violently. Right. So you see you know Powell takes it from
974.56s: zero to five. And if you look at the GDP prints like show me on the chart where Powell you know
980.32s: raised the rates you can't find it. And so one interpretation is the data is all made up.
986.48s: That's fine. Another interpretation is wow something is fundamentally different here what's
992.16s: going on. And then we realized sort of an aha moment as the US shell patch kept producing
998.32s: record print after record print that maybe these two things were connected. You can't
1001.76s: on the one hand understand why it is that Germany is de-industrializing because they have totally
1007.60s: screwed the pooch on their energy policy. And then look at the US producing 20 million barrels of oil
1012.56s: in petroleum products a day 105 BCF of natural gas a day more cold than it burns all the nuclear fleet
1021.04s: humming along at 9% capacity factors. And say to yourself this is an environment that is conducive
1026.16s: to a recession. Just isn't. So it isn't like that there was staring in a face and look we were we
1035.44s: got it wrong. And when we told our subscribers when we came and the big realization for us came in
1040.64s: November to give you a bit more detail. So every month we have a pro tier who in addition to our articles
1046.72s: they get a monthly doom zoom which is usually a 40 slide presentation from us but can also be
1053.28s: a similarly land public or a presentation from an expert in a field like this month we're going
1060.00s: to record hopefully tomorrow a uranium supply chain expert talking to us about the journey from
1065.36s: or to fuel and all the nuances in between. So we do that once a month and in November we decided
1072.32s: to do a deep dive on the global natural gas market and it was called simple molecule complex
1077.04s: markets. And after doing the research for that we went all around the world like we not physically
1082.08s: but you know we looked at Qatar we looked at Saudi Arabia we looked at Europe we looked at North
1086.00s: America we looked at Australia and Russia and South America and we came to the conclusion that
1092.16s: there was a lot of natural gas coming and that the world had pivoted from energy scarcity to energy
1099.36s: abundance. And we often say from the beginning of Dumber the most important question and analysts must
1104.48s: ask themselves about an economy is is that economy currently in a state of energy abundance or energy
1111.44s: and by the way the very pondering of that question implies two possible answers and we came to
1118.00s: prominence during an energy crisis. So for the vast majority of time that Dumber has been a thing
1122.80s: the world was short energy. It's an elongated short energy we came to that conclusion in November
1128.00s: that was a profound one for us and so we did the doomsom for our pro tier then we wrote a full article
1134.08s: called liquefied natural glad and then because this was a significant change in our view we sent to
1139.60s: all of our paying subscribers for free a copy of that November doomsom and then we've since followed
1145.12s: it up with several pieces like slick landing which explains why the US has not fall fall into a recession
1151.92s: and so on like if we have a change in view we want our subscribers to know it but really the
1156.96s: turning point for us was in November we had seen these hot GDP prints we'd seen the hot job prints
1162.40s: and then concurrently we were starting the natural gas market for our pro tier and we came to
1165.76s: utilization like wait a minute natural gas is 25% of global primary energy and we're swimming in it
1173.84s: we're not short energy anymore and what does that mean well that that might explain why the US didn't
1180.40s: fall into a recession for example I see so the first thing is I have to give a shout out to doomsom
1191.04s: it's just so great I love the branding on that I love that um you also as you were talking about
1197.84s: this you reminded me of a quote one of my mentors used to say to me which was a wise man changes his
1203.92s: opinion a fool never does so it seems to be a pro here now going back to this idea of a recession
1212.56s: so it sounds like at least as of thus far you're of the opinion that we've successfully avoided a
1219.76s: recession do you view it still as on the table or do you view it as something that is probably been
1225.92s: averted I think the odds of a recession before the election which was the time frame that we had
1231.36s: constrained our analysis to is very low um Biden is a political animal or at least the people around
1237.92s: him who still have access to their full mental capacities are political animals and they understand
1243.76s: somebody on that team understands commodities which is why the SPR draining gambit worked out so
1249.04s: well ahead of the midterms and I think this move to put a pause on energy exports which will
1254.72s: signal to the US market that you know a glut might be coming and has really dampened at least
1260.72s: contributed to the dampening of of a drawdown in the natural gas curve futures curve here in the US
1269.60s: by the way we originally interpreted that incorrectly and that would be the lead
1273.44s: um point that we make in the piece that we publish later this week about grading ourselves on the
1279.52s: past 30 to 40 pieces um they understand that cheap natural gas is good for the economy and they
1286.80s: want to do everything it can for the US to avoid a recession ahead of the midterms or sorry ahead
1291.12s: of the president's election this time and so I think they will be successful and look this is not
1296.00s: a partisan statement if you hate Biden and you think Trump you know was done wrong in the last
1303.60s: election and you hope that he wins this time you have to be cognizant of the fact that somebody
1309.76s: on the Biden team has made a sure move first in draining the SPR for raw political purposes and now
1316.24s: in keeping the world's largest source and cheapest source of hydrocarbons stuck in the US
1323.52s: um somebody understands what's going on um when Joe had full access to his mental capabilities
1330.56s: um I remember interacting with senator Biden back in the day when I was in industry and he
1336.96s: always had a visceral understanding for the price of gasoline at the pump and what it meant for
1340.80s: national political figures and and so I think it's dangerous to underestimate your political opponents
1349.44s: assuming that you know perhaps most of your listeners would fall on the conservative side um
1354.80s: I think the fact that the election has the the recession has a materialized is
1359.28s: is a net tailwind for the incumbents if Republicans were in office and no recession materialized
1366.96s: when one was expected that would be bullish for them as well um the incumbents have home field
1372.56s: advantage and they are doing whatever they can to avoid a recession and I think you need to factor
1377.68s: that into your models um period whatever it makes you feel about the outcome like this is reality
1385.04s: that needs to be uh properly incorporated and how you think about things if you were to steal man
1391.36s: the argument for a recession to then come back on the table what would that look like oh you
1397.44s: could imagine that the property collapse in China and the de-industrialization of Europe and um you know
1403.68s: um uh uh uh political um polarity in the U.S leading to societal disruptions I mean I don't think
1412.72s: that we're free and clear of of any possible downside I'd say like all things being
1418.32s: equal plugging two and a half-satellar rabies into a manufacturing base is not an environment
1422.00s: that's conducive to a recession but there's all kinds of ways we can screw up from here and if we do
1427.92s: our prediction that we probably won't before the election will have been wrong which is fine
1431.84s: because we have a protocol to manage those things um but I think you know a total collapse of China
1438.16s: which is possible um and you know our export partners and import trading partners struggling
1445.04s: as much as they are like the U.S. is an island right now of economic strength um but that's
1451.76s: you can imagine scenarios where despite the energy tailwinds we still manage to find ourselves
1458.24s: in a recession yeah definitely so thinking of those kinds of scenarios what would you
1464.80s: oscillate as the most viable if it were to occur again in a steel man context and for those
1470.88s: that might not be familiar with that we're just we're playing the other side of the argument just
1474.08s: they always infer yeah always infer and so um I think the the most likely is um a sort of upheaval in
1485.28s: China I mean I do think that Xi Jinping runs a sort of Stalin-esque form of government where nobody
1491.52s: tells them the truth and history teaches us that such systems tend to be very meta-stable and can
1501.44s: collapse rather quickly and the the property situation the stock market gyrations in China
1508.80s: um you know they're there's such a huge part of the global economy right now that a sudden
1515.92s: sort of crisis in China could be a catalyst now it should be said that people have been predicting
1523.04s: this since uh 60 minutes first expose the ghost cities a decade ago uh I remember being in China
1530.96s: entering a ghost city and thinking oh my god this is all a facade that's going to collapse
1535.76s: that was a long time ago and nothing has collapsed um it it's the the functionally equivalent of
1541.76s: arguing about the um you know the in the the pyramid scheme that is so security yes we all know
1549.84s: it is but yet the checks keep going out every year um the yes the US is is a cesspool of waste
1555.76s: and mismanagement and huge deficits and the fiscal cliff and all of these things and yet
1561.28s: treasury auctions keep going off you know at reasonable terms so in you know um
1567.44s: until it happens it won't happen and if it does happen it would be catastrophic I do think
1574.00s: we're keeping close eye in China it and the problem with China is it is impossible for a Western
1579.44s: analyst to make any sense of the data um we have lots of friends in China but even they or hesitant
1586.40s: to like send you anything meaningful over reach out because they know they're being you know monitored
1591.92s: all this other stuff and so um China is a giant Ponzi scheme but if there's one thing we've learned
1600.00s: from the 2008 crisis and the European you know uh foreign or the government bond crisis is that
1609.04s: Ponzi schemes with the full support of the government can go on for a very long time
1615.36s: and so you know if you push just everybody knows Europe is a basket case and that's priced in
1621.76s: but China is a black box and so if you're looking for areas of potential surprise for deviations from
1627.84s: what the sort of consensus view is I think China is probably a decent place to start
1635.52s: interesting would you outline a little bit more I know it's a potentially really deep
1641.60s: objects so I'm not looking to to put you through that but just to understand a little bit better your
1645.52s: assessment of China's a Ponzi scheme can you explain that a bit more?
1648.56s: the the the the entire engine nothing entire a major source of the engine of economic growth in
1656.80s: China for the past 20 years has been a speculative bubble in construction mostly of residential
1665.68s: apartments but entire city infrastructures there was this need to keep that bubble blowing
1674.96s: and also a thought that there would need to be homes for hundreds of millions of people who
1683.12s: eventually came in from the countryside and and were sort of not migrant laborers but became part
1689.92s: of the middle and professional class in China and you know when I when I hear people talking about
1694.72s: the demographics of China and they they should have due top-down looks I always try to remember that
1699.76s: the number that matters most in China is the size of its middle class and is that growing?
1704.72s: and the middle class can be joined by by any age group you know as soon as a
1709.52s: ascending economic ladder so I wouldn't underestimate China but there are
1716.32s: thousands of large empty apartment buildings for whom speculation on the level of what we saw
1730.00s: in the US housing market before they collapsed like 2006 2007 you know a huge amount of individual
1740.00s: savings i.e household net worth in China is tied to what I believe to be air pockets
1750.24s: yes you own claim to apartment 281 of building x26 in ghost city a 14 nobody wants that and you
1762.80s: haven't marked in your books at a million bucks and then you just sold it to somebody else for 1.1
1769.12s: Ponzi schemes require ever fresh sources of capital before they ultimately collapse and this
1775.92s: one that is perhaps the greatest in the history people have been warning about it for as long as
1783.36s: we've been paying attention to China and so it's one of those chicken little type situations but it
1791.28s: is real like I've seen them I've been there and it's awe inspired it's jaw dropping when you see an
1799.04s: entire city designed centrally planned from scratch built a modern specifications the copper and
1806.80s: the concrete and the wood and the finished carpentry and the plumbing all of it built for nothing
1815.36s: just sits there and then it becomes a vehicle for speculation and the speculation is rampant
1821.36s: and then all of those asset values are marked to market and perhaps use this collateral for
1827.28s: debt and so when you look at the stock market collapse in China and you look at the collapse of the
1832.56s: various you know construction companies and so on it's it's pretty hard to imagine how the CCP
1843.20s: keeps a handle on things now they have the full weight of government behind them and the military
1850.08s: behind them and the desire to keep extending and pretending and so maybe this isn't the year
1857.52s: but it it seems clear that at the heart of all of this is very little in the way of fundamental
1864.16s: economic you know these investments aren't in producing assets they're in assets that are basically
1873.36s: then become vehicles for speculation and it is staggering like in the years where I was traveling
1879.76s: to China you could see the change and like it's important to like go to these places people making
1887.04s: fun of Tucker Carlson because it was tripped to Moscow and you know how impressed he was with the
1891.28s: subway and the grocery stores and a beautiful Moscow is the city I would say most of the people
1896.32s: making fun of Tucker have never actually traveled to these major cities and as you do travel around
1901.76s: the world you see the differences and you get a you get a sense of course some of it is managed
1908.32s: and yes you know western business people get treated differently then the locals and all of that
1912.32s: stuff but there is still something very visible traveling there and one of the ways this
1916.64s: manifests for me is and we've written about this from the earliest days there's techno arrogance that
1920.96s: we have in the west that the Chinese and the Indians and the Russians were would be unable to keep
1924.80s: the Russian energy complex going in the face of western sanctions it's just it's just redevignaments I
1930.48s: I toured the major universities in India and China and lectured at some of them and and you see the
1937.28s: army of petroleum engineers the China is putting out every year and how difficult it is to get into
1942.16s: IIT the IT school system in India and how everybody ever met in my life who had a degree from Moscow
1948.32s: state was just a genius we used to call it the genius school we underestimate these people at
1952.88s: our own peril and by the way let's take a look at the US University System in comparison like
1957.52s: who are we kidding so you know until you go there and you see it and you live it you feel that you
1963.36s: touch a you eat with the people you you stay with the people my friend Nate Hagen's who you know
1967.68s: probably has different views than we do great youtuber and thinker just spent I think a six or seven
1974.64s: weeks in India and then his response to having been there for the first time resonated with me because
1979.60s: I've been to India many times and and I I have sympathy for him or not sympathy I can understand
1986.88s: how he can be so blown away by actually going and visiting and and if you don't go and you don't
1991.52s: visit you don't know you just don't and so like you can make fun of Tucker all you want at least he
1996.32s: had the you know what to go and he scored an interview with Putin and I watched it and sorted
2001.60s: a billion other people and it was interesting to me I think Putin got a lot of stuff wrong but I
2006.80s: wanted to hear it and and and kudos to Tucker for having done it definitely on that exact threat I
2012.80s: actually think that that's one of the coolest things about people that join the military is because
2017.76s: it gives them a chance to at least see some other places because I do find Americans in general and
2023.92s: I'm a red blooded American I'm a patriot but I do think a lot of Americans are very close-minded
2030.16s: and we don't have a respect or other places what other places value how other places behave and we
2038.72s: use our value system for them all that kind of stuff gets really interesting to me yeah I would say
2044.00s: a very important follow on to that which is because nobody's gone anywhere and nobody's served
2051.76s: in the military we have a very loose relationship with war and and I think we we would do well
2061.36s: to have a little bit of higher bar to have picking fights with powerful people around the world you
2066.08s: know you you go into a bar today and there's a guy there and he's got a cut off gene jacket on
2071.20s: he's ripped six four looks like he was tied in for a D1 school and he's got tattoos up and down
2076.72s: his arms and he's looking around and saying if anybody sits in this stool next to me I'm going to punch
2080.88s: him in the face so you're just going to go sit in that stool now give it a little bit of wide
2084.96s: birth you know like we live in a dangerous world with people who could do violence to us and the
2091.84s: exact same mental processing you do when you walk into a bar or you walk into a public situation where
2098.56s: you're gut instinct your spotty sense tells you that you know something might go down here and I'm
2103.68s: going to like keep my back to the wall and keep an eye on the exit we ought to have that in our
2108.56s: foreign policy and I think too many of the people in DC have too low regard for the cost of war
2115.76s: because they're not the ones paying you know cash in those checks and and have too little appreciation
2122.80s: for the other cultures of the world and here we are world war three basically and we sleepwalked
2129.36s: into it and and that's I think significant challenge. Talk to me about the world war three comment
2136.88s: well I mean I often wonder when everybody sort of in the US for example thought world war two
2146.24s: began and I think they would all probably say when Pearl Harbor started but if you go back in
2151.12s: history you'll see world war two actually really began when Japan invaded China in the 30s and
2157.28s: everything that followed from that led to the dominoes that became world war two and I wonder
2163.76s: when historians will look back at this time and say world war three started we have
2168.24s: a proxy war between Ukraine and Russia which is essentially a war between NATO and Russia which
2174.16s: is essentially a war between the US and Russia that's a hot war I've spent the last couple of
2179.12s: months going down the rabbit hole of these these mappers were chronicling the day-to-day ebbs and
2186.72s: flows of the line of contact between Russia and Ukraine and it probably won't write about it but
2192.00s: it's interesting to me and because of the connections to the energy markets is how I sort of got
2196.72s: into this because Russia shuts an important you know the energy exporter and then when you compare
2201.44s: what you can learn just from open source from people that you sort of categorize people into their
2207.52s: sort of Russia focus or Ukraine bent or some people that try to be down the middle and then you
2213.04s: could be two three weeks ahead of the mainstream media and then you see how things are characterized
2216.48s: in the media totally inconsistent with reality on the ground you begin to question of course you
2222.80s: know what you're being fed we're in world war three like we have that conflict in Ukraine which
2232.08s: by the way when I watch those videos you see that Putin is just leveling these towns in these
2236.64s: villages right I mean step one is they carpet bomb them step two is they they they sent in the
2242.08s: stormtroopers and then step three is they occupied them and raised the Russian flag and they're
2245.44s: just doing it over and over and over again and they've got complete domination of the air and I think
2252.24s: one of the under appreciated catalysts say or blacks one events for 2024 is is a rapid collapse
2258.72s: of Ukraine and so lensky being ousted in a coup I think that's real I think that's possible
2262.96s: as being totally downplayed in the west and market participants need to have that on the
2267.04s: radar now we have a kinetic conflict in the middle east and where the ones are being Israel
2272.80s: um and much of the rest of the least is uniting against the west it's not being reported at all
2278.48s: how we are being pummeled at the United Nations both in the security council then I think eventually
2285.44s: uh at the floor of the general assembly the world is lining up against our support for Israel
2290.24s: whatever your views on the war are like I get again it's a controversial topic I spend a lot of
2293.84s: time studying Israel um and its history and um but just agnastically as an analyst we're losing
2302.40s: the public relations war um here and then you have the tensions with China and by the way if China
2308.32s: is that blacks one event with the property collapse and so on the CCP will create a war that's what
2313.76s: that's what you know dictators do and so we have this strange cyber attack last week which kind
2324.64s: of caught our eye you know like literally as I'm talking to you trending on on x which I still
2334.40s: use as a as a news following sources of World War III um and I think we're a lot close to World War
2341.92s: look we have the houthis shutting down the red sea we have the war in Gaza we have potential spread
2348.08s: to the north we have a potential direct connect conflict with with Iran and by the way over the weekend
2354.32s: I'm watching and this is not reported in the US at all I'm watching um you know geolocated videos
2362.56s: of ten thousand dollar drones tracking billion dollar patriot missile systems and guiding
2371.52s: cheap missiles to destroy them I've seen three such videos in the past week these run a billion dollars
2377.76s: upon and cheap drone warfare is changing the battlefield have we caught up to this as congress debates
2389.60s: sixty billion dollars to send into that you know in front of it may be that that's what we should do
2395.12s: I'm not making a case either way but I'm watching billion dollar patriot missiles being destroyed
2403.04s: by weaponry that I personally could afford to buy
2407.60s: I'm of course I would have never you know I'm not an engage in an arms dealing but I could afford
2412.80s: to destroy a billion dollar patriotism today and that's profound and I don't think a bureaucracy
2419.92s: has cut up to this and a big ahaha for us is the same architects of our insane sanctions policy
2426.72s: and Europe's crazy energy policy are the political force behind the military strategy and
2432.32s: they look as you probably know a military is only as good as its political leaders like the troops
2437.44s: can be well trained but they're told what to do and if those decisions are terrible the troops
2442.80s: suffer and if you have very bad political issue I don't care how good the military is that
2449.04s: military is in trouble assuming they follow orders and so it's pretty we're at a very dangerous point
2455.76s: here in the west we have the president who I think objectively is is not all there and who is
2465.04s: insisting on sleepwalking us into the major war with at least one and potentially two you know
2474.48s: nuclear superpowers and I'm old enough to remember when wars required of other Congress
2480.72s: so it's scary times based on that I can follow a lot of your train of thought how do you define
2489.76s: wool war three like how do you define a wool war because me there's a slight disconnect there
2497.04s: at least in terms of the way that you're laying out the timeline meet before when you were
2502.24s: singing maybe I misheard but before I'm saying that we're in war three look what's going on right
2507.44s: now is or at least the third time in the past 100 years Russia is marching from east to west and
2519.36s: raising the lands as they moved towards western Europe that war is being funded by the US
2528.72s: so in the prior two times that this has happened in the past 100 years we were allies with them
2534.00s: and the opponent was Germany now we're allied with Germany and we're funding basically Ukrainian
2539.76s: resistance and if you doubt that you can just see how quickly Ukrainian resistance has been
2547.36s: falling as weapons supply has dried up from the west and of course that makes total sense
2553.76s: we are funding and providing the weapons for is Israel's war in the Middle East again
2559.76s: whatever think of October 7th whatever you've used our on Palestinians right to self determination
2564.48s: and all those things forget about all that there is a hot war going on in the Middle East and we are
2569.68s: supplying weapons or one side which means we're at war with the other side we're not supplying weapons
2575.60s: for the Palestinians or go the US is at war with the Palestinians I mean I think it's we should just
2582.48s: say it and we should debate whether that's the right thing to do but that is what we're doing
2589.12s: and then we're gearing up for a confrontation with China, vis-a-vis Taiwan so it feels to me like
2598.72s: 1941 before Pearl Harbor we were supporting the UK you know land lease the whole nine yards
2608.24s: we were supporting certain parts of a European war which means we're effectively at war
2612.56s: with the other side we were supporting the Russians in their war with Germany
2616.88s: and we were supporting China in their war with Japan and then when the Japanese attack
2623.52s: Pearl Harbor we became officially part of the war but if all of that is true then World War 2
2629.76s: actually started when Japan first invaded China in the early 30s and Hitler came to power in
2636.24s: 33 and in all of those events that sort of led to what we now call World War 2 I see the echoes
2643.04s: of that pattern here today I see yeah I from my ignorant perspective I think that that suffers a
2651.28s: little bit from hindsight because then if you look back at any conflict between two countries that
2657.12s: then didn't have the rest of the war and then we've had a hundred degrees that if we end up
2664.16s: having a hot war with China then the collective action of the past three years was probably
2668.88s: in hindsight we'll be labeled as war war through I mean I would agree that that's a catalyst
2674.88s: for the world war but I wouldn't consider that war war because so let me give you a different view
2682.56s: 110,000 people died of fentanyl overdose last year in the US China makes all the precursors for that
2689.60s: and if you look over the fentanyl deaths are it's basically the US in Canada how is that not a chemical
2695.04s: warfare act by China on the US it's a piece we've pondered writing we haven't written it yet we've
2700.08s: done some studying of it they know where the precursor factories are they know how to shut nothing
2706.00s: happens in China without the CCP's approval drugs finding their way to directly into the US and
2712.72s: through Mexico are at least with a knowingly deadly poison that is killing a hundred thousand
2720.88s: military age people a year I mean just because it's not tanks in artillery and planes doesn't mean
2729.76s: we're not a war just this week we've got another balloon flying over the US I don't know what any of
2735.20s: that means but like cyber attack last week like there are the modern embodiment of war between
2744.88s: superpowers need not necessarily be a traditional game of acts you know like it it it a hundred thousand
2752.88s: people died last year from something that China is doing on purpose to the American Peter
2762.32s: are we at war with China
2765.20s: I would say no or not yeah I would say perhaps we should ponder whether we are because they might
2771.12s: be at war with us and we don't know it or yeah and I think we're in direct competition to your point
2777.20s: I think with places like that we continually fraud one another to find weaknesses but again just
2783.60s: from my layman's perspective war is a defined thing how do you think the CCP would react if we were
2791.12s: doing something that we knew we're killing a hundred thousand of their citizens a year
2796.16s: I'm not convinced that we're not yeah well it's fair enough there you go even more proof yeah
2801.36s: I don't know my view is in 10 years and 20 years time we will look back at 2022 2023 and 2024
2809.60s: and characterize this time period as the beginning of World War III I hope I'm wrong by the way
2814.32s: yeah because I have you know draft eligible children
2817.36s: yeah I mean it's it really is a fascinating perspective and I enjoy you sharing it with me because
2824.24s: it just it continues to elucidate how complex of an environment that we're in we're even you and
2831.28s: I we're talking about a specific term just a term yeah and meanwhile behind what we're talking
2838.72s: about we're just massive pieces moving and to your point I do fully agree with you that this
2845.84s: this time could absolutely be a precursor when you look at the relationship between the US
2856.64s: Russia and China kind of that trio what comes to mind I think a tragedy of missed opportunities
2865.68s: comes to mind I think in a world where the three great powers behave in a manner that sort of
2880.96s: prioritized mutual respect things could have evolved quite differently but they didn't
2890.64s: and things have evolved the way they have I think for example in a piece we wrote eight last year I believe
2898.96s: the Western hemisphere did not even mess around with Europe or the Middle East or China we have so
2906.00s: much here that we could just do you know I'm old enough to remember when the the Department of Defense
2910.48s: was meant to defend the US like let's start there you know what what are we doing all over the world
2918.24s: and defending you know shipping lanes in a release so that China could have access to energy let China
2925.04s: let China's Navy take care of the Middle East and they don't have one well they best start
2928.72s: best start build one you know like it what are we doing you let's say we're doing that out of the
2934.32s: kindness of our hearts no I I do think there is a very strong look I think Eisenhower is right I think
2942.24s: the military industrial complex in the US is is extremely strong and greedy and is pillaging the US
2951.76s: treasury spending blood that's not theirs I think our bar to going to war should be much higher I think
2959.04s: Lindsey Graham is one of the most reprehensible figures in modern politics I I see him on Fox
2965.44s: news demanding we start carpet bombing and raining refineries like get in the plane you do it
2972.40s: like what what what are we doing like you first you know like that by the way are you ready for the
2978.40s: counter punch you know walk up to that guy at the bar in the sleeveless gene jacket with the with
2985.44s: the you know rip muscles in the tattoos and sit on that stool next to him and put your finger
2990.56s: in his face I mean go ahead let's see how it goes it's insane like we we have this view
2997.52s: that we're the dominant superpower we could do whatever we want and I just don't think that is
3005.44s: conducive to world peace or economic development or human prosperity and I think it risks
3016.64s: nuclear war like can we have a vote in congress please
3019.92s: I it's mind boggling to me the flippant way in which major US politicians like Lindsey Graham
3032.72s: think war is in our kid game and all they got to do is put more quarters in the machine and they
3037.52s: could keep playing like we have vulnerabilities one of the reasons you don't go to war as you might
3044.64s: lose it and and lord knows our track record in this regard in the past few decades is not
3053.20s: been a glorious one I remember people hanging on to us air force jets as they flew out of
3059.92s: SKS tank not that long ago like what did we do and the sacrifice of the countless men and women
3068.96s: and largely American soldiers who died there during that war what was it for and how tragic is that
3077.12s: same thing with Iraq same thing with Libya what are we doing like can we take a beat can we take a pause
3084.72s: can we have a national conversation about the neocons and whether we need to be the world's police
3092.48s: how about we start being the US's police I don't know what do your thoughts on the concept of like
3100.32s: a defense and death the big thing from military doctrine I'm curious what your thoughts are on it
3106.88s: I'm unfamiliar with the terms so maybe you can yeah not served in the military which is why I
3112.32s: perhaps have a lot of respect for people who have from from a defensive position like if if my
3119.12s: notebook is this is the border this is where we are and then this is where the enemy is defense
3126.00s: and depth is a concept where we don't want our first lines of defense to be here we want it to be
3132.16s: here here and here here here I get that where does it end how much is enough and by the way like
3142.56s: let's start with our border where you know we have 10 million people crossing the border to
3148.96s: I've flown into the US countless times and stood in customs and immigration lines and make sure that
3154.80s: you have make sure that you have your papers in order and and all these other things and we have
3160.40s: 10 million people crossing the border many of whom are military age men again are we in World War
3168.40s: how many of them are from China how many of them are from Iran or their proxies how many of them
3173.36s: are from the drug cartels I saw a story last week where gangs of people that have come over the border
3182.16s: are rating rich neighborhoods in Detroit and bringing their loot back down to Texas
3189.52s: like this is coming like 10 million people is a lot and the disparity between what you and I do
3195.60s: taking your shoes off at TSA and all of that security theater standing in line for an hour at a time
3204.00s: at Lagardia or pick your favorite airport at land and all here meanwhile people just scrolling across
3209.52s: the border and like where where is national defense is that literally not the definition of national
3218.80s: defense the book that you just held up the binding of that book is that not like does not begin with
3224.00s: the US border and somehow approximately when you crane matters more than the border between
3231.04s: Mexico and Texas I think one one thing I would offer to that at least from my perspective is I
3237.20s: I think we when we when people talk about these things we fall into kind of like binary positions and
3241.76s: I'm not sure that I've seen anywhere somebody say or even in the way that we behave that one is
3247.92s: discreetly more important than the other now I get probably your point based on where the money is
3252.64s: flowing the amount of money the actions were taking those kinds of things so on that on that thread
3260.40s: though what would you suggest for the border out of curiosity I just think having interacted with
3268.32s: US immigration for a fair part of my life and always try to do so legally that like we have laws
3277.84s: for reason and they should either be enforced or not and anybody who's cross bridged to Canada or
3284.64s: you know flown in from overseas and I flown all over the world and in every country I've landed
3290.64s: I have to produce my passport they ask me what I'm doing there I fill out forms I am a privileged
3296.40s: guest of that government while I'm in their country which is their national territory there's
3301.20s: sovereign territory and I think a country without borders that it complies as no country at all
3307.60s: and I understand that there's humanitarian issues and all that but we used to handle those in the
3312.48s: you know we had we the US has always been a country of immigrants and the assimilation of immigrants
3319.20s: into the country is part of the fabric the tapestry of what makes this country great I'm very much
3326.00s: for a vibrant legal immigration system and even the people that are desperate to get here you know
3334.96s: they do have rights and we should treat them with dignity and respect because of humans but there
3338.32s: has to be law and order there has to be a system it can't just be people you know hordes of people
3347.12s: crawling over barbed wires most of whom are desperate to just get here and to live the American dream
3352.00s: I am not casting a white net on the composition of the people that are coming here but it doesn't take
3356.64s: many we're bad apples the whole point of customs and border control is to prevent bad apples from
3363.68s: getting into your country like that the post 9-11 world is one we've all submitted to because we were
3369.04s: afraid of a reoccurrence of what happened on 9-11 so we agree that an uncontrolled border situation
3376.64s: is conducive to 13 people figuring out how to get flying lessons and blowing up a bunch of buildings
3382.08s: in the US like so if that was if it was worth it for us to give up so many freedoms and to spend
3387.84s: so much money and to frankly lose the wars that we have lost how is it not worth it now because we
3393.04s: don't know what the next threat is going to be and so I think it all starts with control at the
3398.00s: border and if you don't have that then do you really have a country and so I have deep sympathy and
3402.56s: visceral sympathy for the people that are desperate to get the US because the US is look the direction
3408.24s: of flow is in one the arrow is in one way right it's coming here because this is a great place
3414.32s: I understand that and I have deep sympathy for it but we have to have rules we have to have
3420.48s: controls and we have to have processes that make sure that we eliminate or identify the people on
3426.88s: terrorist watch list for example who are slipping through the border today or M13 gang members who are
3431.68s: slipping through the border today or you know various other cartel members that are slipping through
3436.08s: the border today and they are and it's just not an eyeball that they are like there will be victims
3441.92s: in the US because of that and this is a failure of government and it's most primary duty which is
3448.16s: to defend the nation's borders as it exists and the citizens within it that's what actually
3454.24s: the Department of Court defense is is meant to do you have always thought a big contributing factor is
3463.68s: that we have so many holes like once somebody is in US they're kind of there it's very difficult
3473.76s: to manage that because I in the reason why I said question is I agree in terms of
3479.92s: needing to control a border needing to have a defined process I think fully
3485.04s: in page I think one of the tricky parts is I consider the problem is like we know it's not solved
3491.92s: and I'm to be clear I'm not against a physical barrier I think a physical barrier is good
3496.80s: I think something like that doesn't solve it though not that difficult to circumnavigate
3502.32s: something like that so to me it seems like there needs to be some sort of structural adjustment
3508.16s: within the country yeah I think the first thing we need is an agreement that such things are
3514.56s: necessary and that doesn't exist to one side with for whatever reason thinks that in open borders
3521.60s: amateurs to that and so that's like the biggest political issue is an honest open discussion
3528.00s: about what does it mean to be a country like again having stood in line for as many hours as I
3539.36s: have like it's it's profound to me that we've just decided in this particular instance the rules
3546.72s: don't count so then why do I have to stand on the line of TSA right I mean why am I taking my shoes
3552.24s: off I'm not the shoe bomber the the government knows who I am I've done the TSA pre-check they know
3557.28s: all about my internet search history they know about my bank accounts they know about my but they
3560.72s: know everything about me I'm no threat right but still I take off my shoes and oops I have an
3568.64s: iPad on top of a computer so my bag gets searched because it looks funny on the screen and we all
3573.28s: pretend like this is making anybody safer on a plane when they know I'm not a threat right they
3579.76s: have the systems to know I'm not a threat believe me if the government wanted to get rid of me that
3584.96s: have no shortage of reasons to do so like this is this is the world we live it and yet we all
3591.04s: submit to this computer of security when we have a completely open border you know both in North
3600.64s: and South by the way like people getting into Canada then coming in from North same thing I've been
3605.12s: on the Canadian border in a car and interrogated and randomly selected for a full search and they
3611.68s: basically take tools and take apart your car looking for you know I don't know grandma marijuana
3616.00s: or whatever like how is this making either side safer I don't know I just stand by and let them
3622.48s: because I know there's nothing in my car and so on but they treat us that way and yet we have
3631.60s: this situation that just seems very incongruent there's something deep and malicious about what's
3636.56s: going on that I don't understand that's my visceral response to your question yeah interesting
3644.24s: really interesting I know that we're we're up at time here I had one last question for you
3649.60s: is you're looking out over 2024 what's most interesting to you in life I think the thing that's
3656.24s: most interesting to me is weather and how fast the in a great situation resolves because I think
3664.48s: again many in the west have their heads in the sand as to what's actually going on on the ground
3669.60s: and it is readily accessible to anybody who's willing to look and invest the time to have a pretty
3675.28s: good understanding of what's going on on the ground and the contrast between what you can learn
3684.00s: on your own and how it's portrayed in the major western media outlets would shock people
3689.04s: if they actually took the time to do it it would really make them ponder who it is that works
3694.08s: at these organizations and what is their real agenda and I actually think part of the success of
3698.72s: Duneberg is we are just authentically ourselves we right what we believe we're not afraid to be
3706.00s: wrong and we're not beholden to some you know messaging that the government would like to put out
3712.80s: there and so the that story wraps everything that is interesting to us it's connected to energy
3721.36s: it's connected to the ever changing role of the media and the in particular the emergence of
3731.44s: sort of micro sources of news where people begin to trust one outlet over another for their own
3738.40s: reasons and instead of having three news anchors that dominate the narrative you have
3745.28s: five six hundred major sources of news that people select into their news flow and
3749.68s: in our own small way for the two hundred and ten thousand people that subscribe to Duneberg hopefully
3755.12s: we've been able to carve out a bit of a an interesting source for them but I think
3762.96s: the biggest disconnect on the board today is how the western media is portraying the situation in
3768.16s: Ukraine and and what we or I happen to think is coming interesting time will tell but
3779.84s: yeah absolutely awesome chatting with you I enjoy the dialogue I enjoy your perspectives I
3783.92s: always have an opportunity to learn a lot and so does the audience so thank you for hanging out I
3788.72s: will throw links to your sub stack in the notes below but is there anywhere else that you want
3793.36s: to send people to that's that's where we are duneberg dot subsac dot com we're about to embark on
3799.12s: a potential rebrand as we we're able to eject a squatter from duneberg dot com so now we now own
3804.88s: that domain name and we might do a little rebrand there we'll see in the coming weeks and months
3809.76s: ahead but for now everything we do is at duneberg dot subsac dot com and look you know I I think
3814.96s: this conversation probably went in a different direction and we were planning but I very much enjoyed
3818.32s: it and I appreciated the opportunity to talk about a few things that we probably won't have a
3822.64s: read about yeah yeah I had a blast I really enjoy these and it's a great wave for other people to
3828.64s: hear different perspectives conversations about complex things so thank you very much for your time
3833.12s: back to you soon thank you
