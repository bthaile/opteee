0.00s:  What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I got my friends
5.92s:  from Duneberg back on my favorite green chicken. I think maybe the only green chicken that
10.28s:  I'm aware of, but welcome back to the podcast. Great to have you. Eric, great to be back with
15.04s:  you. So it's been about a quarter since we've spoken last and maybe like a lot has happened
22.84s:  also not. I guess there's always a lot happening, but I thought it would be cool to start with
27.84s:  looking back at 2023 and from your purview as a whole, two things. First, what stood out to you
36.24s:  in two? How did things progress against expectations for you? Great questions. And first of all,
43.12s:  great to be back with you. I always enjoy our conversations and it's going to be a fun one today.
47.60s:  The thing that jumps out to us in 2023, first and foremost, is the lack of a recession in the US.
56.16s:  I think the consensus view heading into the year was the Fed couldn't raise rates at the speed
64.24s:  with which they were attending to without destroying the economy. They're going to raise until they
67.84s:  break something was the common knowledge on Fin Twit and in much of the punitive class of which
74.48s:  were a charter member. So that's meant not as a derogatory term. And also I think there was
81.76s:  consistent or sort of as an auxiliary observation to that, there was this view which we held up
87.36s:  that the US was probably reaching its capacity to produce hydrocarbons and the shell patch would roll
95.36s:  over. And the big aha for us here in the years is neither of those materialized. The US kept producing
103.60s:  record-breaking month after record-breaking month of oil and NGLs and natural gas and even
109.84s:  exported a record volume or value of coal. And also the US did not slip into a recession. And
118.24s:  as an analyst, when you get something raw, what matters most is what you learn from it.
124.48s:  And the difference between an analyst and an advocate is an analyst seeks to understand, as opposed
129.44s:  to an advocate seeks to be proven right. And we pride ourselves on trying our best to be analyst.
134.32s:  Look every time you make a call, you'd like to be right. But when you're not right, that's a really
138.80s:  amazing opportunity to learn. And one of the rare big sort of aha's in the second half of 2023
144.08s:  was connecting those two dots. The US did not go into recession precisely because it is a
150.40s:  hydrocarbon-producing powerhouse. The shell revolution has added 2.5 Saudi Arabia's to the US
158.56s:  energy mix. The vast majority of which is trapped and or used here, which feeds a pretty decent
165.76s:  manufacturing sector unlike other petrol states who just have the commodities to rely on. The US has
170.88s:  all manner of downstream manufacturing chemicals and other motives and fertilizers and you name it.
176.40s:  And today at $1.65 from the UNB2 natural gas, natural gas is selling in the US for the energy
182.00s:  equivalent price of $10 a barrel oil. And if you plug 2.5 Saudi Arabia's into a manufacturing
187.68s:  sector, it's unlikely even at 5% interest rates that that economy is going to suddenly go into a
193.52s:  recession. And I think that was a big aha for us. I still think the vast majority of analysts
199.60s:  don't really understand the critical role that energy plays in the economy. The view energy is
204.00s:  just another input into the economy. We have a different view. And that was the big story of 2023.
212.00s:  The US kept smashing. I mean smashing production records for natural gas and oil and petroleum
219.28s:  with record refinery runs. Cheap coal. You mix all those things in with elite universities, all
226.16s:  of the deep water ports and river systems and fertile farmland and all of the other inherited
232.80s:  damages that Peter Zahane will tell you makes America great. That's pretty tough,
238.48s:  pretty tough to overcome if you're in the recession camp, which we were in. And so having gotten
244.24s:  both calls wrong, we decided to try to understand why. And so that was the big sort of second half
250.08s:  saga for us. Yeah, I have one of your posts pulled up over here. It's called Atlas Won't Shrug. And
257.12s:  there's a section here that follows the thread that you're literally just talking about. And it says,
262.88s:  quote, energy is not an input into the economy. It is the economy. Can you expand on that?
270.24s:  Yeah, if you go on to read the rest of that post, it says humanity organizes its economic activities
276.40s:  to ensure a steady growth in the extraction and exploitation of primary energy. Because energy is
281.76s:  life. Standards of living are defined by how much energy is available to be exploited. And most
287.36s:  importantly, all humans ever are perpetually seeking a higher standard of living. And when you,
293.52s:  the introduction of that piece, we catalog a parade of catastrophes that have occurred since
299.20s:  the 1970s. Nixon took us off the gold standard. And the Shah of Iran was overthrown. We had the
306.88s:  young people war in between. And the embargo against the West Biopakken. The 1980s brought the war
314.48s:  between Iran and Iraq. And then of course, Saddam Hussein evaded Kuwait. And we had a million
320.96s:  troops in the Middle East in short order. We had the Asian financial crisis. We had the
327.68s:  rubble default in the late 90s. We had the connected long-term capital management collapse as a
333.92s:  consequence of the rubble default. Not 11 happened. The war on terrorism. We destabilized Syria. We
340.88s:  destabilized Libya. All manner of negative consequences. Afghanistan collapsed. We had COVID. All of
347.44s:  these things happened in the last 50 years since Nixon took the US off the gold standard. And yet,
353.60s:  as we showed in the piece, the total primary energy consumed by humans grows in an upwardly
361.52s:  sloping gentle sine wave. And it's because all humans ever want a higher standard of living. The
368.48s:  human endeavor requires an ever-increasing amount of primary energy. And so it shall be. And this
375.92s:  is our big aha. The further we would grasp from that primary energy upward sloping sine wave,
383.44s:  the quicker we'll snap back to it. And this of course was a response to a series of pieces that
389.44s:  we've had when we wrote a piece that we thought was kind of a throwaway piece called P.G. Poles
393.60s:  Amit late last year that it stirred up this ordinance nest of angry response like we were kind
399.92s:  of shocked. Like those people who have tied their entire life identities to this concept. And we
405.68s:  come at this problem from an above ground chemical background with 20 years experience in the
411.20s:  industry. And this concept of P.G. Poles, I mean, it's just, you know, these are ultimately techno
416.96s:  pessimists who underestimate the human potential for ingenuity. I feel bad for such people because
423.84s:  they've literally tied their livelihoods to it. It's not coming. It's not going to happen. We'll
427.52s:  figure it away. We always have. And we always will. One question I have for you on that energy
435.04s:  consumption thread is you're saying that it's tied to standard of living. Have you analyzed
442.16s:  or thought about the tie to an expanding population versus standard of living or vice versa?
448.16s:  Oh, sure. So you could do these very famous charts and we've done them where you plot energy
453.28s:  use per capita versus GDP per capita. There are no rich countries that are energy poor.
461.28s:  And in fact, ultimately energy is the economy as we say in the piece. And look, the human
466.56s:  endeavor is a constant, unrelenting struggle against the forces of entropy disorder is spontaneous.
471.76s:  Right angles do not appear naturally in the environment. In order to have a high standard
478.48s:  of living, you need to impose order on your local environment and it by the law of thermodynamics
483.92s:  necessitates that you must harness primary energy and ultimately waste heat. You can't like
490.88s:  to balance the energy equations in order to have order, you need to waste heat.
497.12s:  And the economy is basically one giant heat wasting machine. You know, abandon your
503.76s:  house for a year and you get a sense of the forces of entropy. Your home requires constant
509.04s:  maintenance. Check the roofs, make sure like no animals are getting into it and cut back the
514.80s:  shrubbery and all of the things that go into running your home. Painting the exterior,
519.84s:  all of this stuff. You do these things because left on its own your house would eventually
524.80s:  devolve into a chaotic mass. Whereas order is the opposite of chaos and to create and maintain order
534.56s:  requires a constant stream of primary energy. And if you look at the global south and you ponder the
540.96s:  fortified billion people currently living at seventh, sixth or fifth of the energy that we use here in the
547.76s:  west, all of those people would love nothing more than to be able to waste as much energy as we do.
554.56s:  And I mean waste in the most neutral sense. You can't have order without wasting heat. And
561.44s:  who are we to deny them? This prospect that the world is just going to do without, I think, is
568.72s:  fundamentally anti-human. How do you decipher the relationship between energy as a contributor
576.24s:  to standard of living versus something like technology or is energy a feat to technology in your
581.44s:  perspective here? You can't have technology without energy. What's powering the server rooms,
585.92s:  like what's powering the data rooms? Who is literally providing the food to the brilliant
591.76s:  entrepreneurs and programmers and startup founders and so on that are creating all of this amazing
597.68s:  technology? That's why energy is different. Energy is different than labor because you can't have
604.72s:  labor without energy. The people working need to eat food is the derivative of energy. Clean water
610.16s:  is a derivative of energy. And so during times of energy abundance, we have excess energy. Energy
619.36s:  can be reasonably well modeled as an input into the economy like all the others, but during times of
623.84s:  energy crises is where there's a shortage of energy. And look, if you just take a step back,
630.72s:  we know that if all goes to $200 a barrel, what happens? We trigger recession. We know that Germany
636.16s:  screwed up its energy policy. It's de-industrializing. It's in the middle of a recession. The UK doesn't
640.64s:  produce hardly any of its own energy. It's a victim of the energy crisis. It's in a recession.
645.76s:  If the lack of energy is a catalyst for economic malaise, what does it mean in the US to have added
654.80s:  to a half Saudi Arabia since 2010 to, it's mostly domestic energy mix? Have you been to Saudi Arabia?
661.04s:  Like the sidewalks are paved and cold. When you are in energy superpower, you're wealthy.
668.16s:  And then when you're in energy superpower, who has forward-integrated world-class manufacturing
674.40s:  base to feed that advantageous energy to, all the homes in the US that are heated with natural gas
680.32s:  or heating their homes at unbelievably cheap prices today, all of the cogeneration facilities that
686.16s:  are heavy manufacturing centers across the US are experiencing windfall cost reductions compared
692.72s:  to their global competitors. You plug two and a half Saudi Arabia into a pretty strong manufacturing
697.60s:  sector with all of the other geo advantages that we described earlier. It's very hard to imagine
702.72s:  why it would be that a recession would suddenly in spontaneous materialize. And we got it wrong.
707.84s:  Let's understand why we got it wrong. I think we have a pretty good theory.
712.40s:  Yeah, I think the interesting part of that theory though, at least to me, is you guys have a
717.04s:  a lot of expertise. You guys have a fair-sized team. I don't know how big your team is obviously,
722.72s:  but you have a lot of smart people as the punchline. And it's interesting to me that you guys seem to
729.04s:  come across this last year as compared to the some other time when you guys were analyzing the
734.88s:  prospects of recession. What do you think led you guys to coming up to this concept last year
740.08s:  versus some other period in time? Look, the Fed raised rates from 0 to 5% in the snap of a finger
747.92s:  and nothing broke. And I could tell you that if you were to ask us that in 2022, we would have
754.08s:  said things would break. They didn't. So I think as an analyst, if you're a content creator in the
760.48s:  finance energy world, and you produce that the volume and cadence that we do, you're going to
765.28s:  get some things right. We've got a lot of things right. I'm proud of the things we've got right.
769.04s:  We got the sanctions right, for example, from the earliest days. I think that's one of our best calls.
773.68s:  But you're going to get some things wrong. And how you react to the things you got wrong is the
777.28s:  defining characteristic of your team. We intend to be doing this for decades. So what happened
783.28s:  in late 2023 and even now as GDP prints came in hot and jobs reports came in hot. The people that
793.76s:  were in the recession camp many of them found ever creative ways to try to figure out how this data
798.96s:  was wrong or fraudulent. And to me, that that reeks of advocacy, not analysis. I mean, at some point
806.48s:  you have to trust some data, does the government massage the data for political reasons sure?
811.52s:  But there is a manufacturing construction boom going on in the US. And in the next two job prints,
816.88s:  we're going to see ever increasing manufacturing jobs as those construction projects wrap up. And
822.96s:  the people who are going to work in those factories start checking in.
828.88s:  If you get something wrong, you have to try to understand why. And that's how you get better.
833.04s:  And if you're stuck on insisting that every jobs report is made up,
839.04s:  oh, look at the part-time versus the full-time or look at the seasonal adjustments and so on and so on and so on.
846.24s:  I think you can very quickly lose the chance to learn something. And so we're always more than
855.04s:  willing to be wrong as long as we learn. We have a philosophy here and we're putting out a piece
861.52s:  a couple of days from after we're recording this called loose ends where every 30 to 40 pieces
866.56s:  related to look back at what we wrote and see what we got right and what we got wrong and admit
870.96s:  our mistakes and explain to our subscribers why we made them and what we learned from them.
876.16s:  I think this is very healthy. We intend to be in this business for decades.
880.16s:  And the only thing worse than being wrong is having no view so long as you are willing to show
886.64s:  your homework and to authentically embrace why it is that you got something wrong so that you can
892.48s:  implement that mindset of continuous improvement. And that is one of our brand ambitions.
896.88s:  Our long-term subscribers know this is always how we have behaved and how we intend to continue to
901.84s:  behave. And I think it's pretty healthy. It's a great way to be because that way you don't need to
907.84s:  worry about what if I got something wrong. Because if I got something wrong, it's just going to be
911.76s:  an opportunity for me to explain to our subscribers what it is we got wrong why and what if we learn from
916.48s:  it. So our mistake management philosophy has four parts. Mistakes shall be rare admitted to
922.88s:  corrected and learned from. It's just that simple. Yeah and that makes a lot of sense to be clear
929.12s:  I'm not harping on whether the any call is right or wrong to be honest from from my perspective the
935.20s:  idea of judging the merit of something based on right or wrong is at least in this context with
942.08s:  economic systems that are like wildly complex. It's less interesting to me the part that I was
948.72s:  really honing in on there was what do you think led to you guys coming across this change last year
956.08s:  compared to another point in time and it sounds like the summary of that was the rate change
961.04s:  environment was very unique and that's that was the catalyst for the assessment there.
966.56s:  But the lack of a follow through of a recession once the rates were hiked so violently right. So
972.72s:  you see you know Powell takes it from zero to five and if you look at the GDP prints like show me
978.72s:  on the chart where Powell you know raised the rates you can't find it. And so one interpretation is
984.32s:  the data is all made up that's fine. Another interpretation is wow something is fundamentally
991.20s:  different here what's going on and then we realize sort of an aha moment as the US shell patch kept
997.28s:  producing record print after record print that maybe these two things were connected. You can't
1001.76s:  on the one hand understand why it is that Germany is de-industrializing because they have totally
1007.60s:  screwed the pooch on their energy policy and then look at the US producing 20 million barrels
1012.16s:  of oil in petroleum products a day 105 BCF of natural gas a day more cold than it burns all the
1020.24s:  nuclear fleet hominal log at 9% capacity factors and say to yourself this is an environment that
1025.52s:  is conducive to a recession just isn't so it isn't like that there was staring at a face and look
1034.96s:  we were we got it wrong and when we told our subscribers when we came and the big realization for
1040.24s:  us came in November to give you a bit more detail. So every month we have a pro tier who in addition to
1046.16s:  our articles they get a monthly doom zoom which is usually a 40 slide presentation from us but
1051.84s:  can also be a similarly land public or a presentation from an expert in a field like this month we're
1059.84s:  going to record hopefully tomorrow a uranium supply chain expert talking to us about the journey from
1065.36s:  or to fuel and all the nuances in between. So we do that once a month and in November we decided to
1072.40s:  do a deep dive on the global natural gas market and it was called simple molecule complex markets
1078.40s:  and after doing the research for that we went all around the world like we not physically but you know
1082.40s:  we looked at Qatar we looked at Saudi Arabia we looked at Europe we looked at North America we looked
1086.72s:  at Australia and Russia and South America and we came to the conclusion that there was a
1092.56s:  glut of natural gas coming and that the world had pivoted from energy scarcity to energy abundance
1100.08s:  and we often say from the beginning of doom bird the most important question an analyst must ask
1104.64s:  themselves about an economy is is that economy currently in a state of energy abundance or energy
1110.40s:  deficit and by the way the very pondering of that question implies two possible answers and we
1116.96s:  came to prominence during an energy crisis so for the vast majority of time that doom bird has
1121.20s:  been a thing the world was short energy it's a long a short energy we came to that conclusion in
1127.20s:  November that was a profound one for us and so we did the doom zoom for our pro tier then we wrote a
1133.52s:  full article called liquefied natural glad and then because this was a significant change in our view
1139.04s:  we sent to all of our paying subscribers for free a copy of that November doom zoom and then we've
1144.56s:  since followed it up with several pieces like slick landing which explains why the US has not
1149.28s:  fall fall into a recession and so on like if we have a change in view we want our subscribers
1155.76s:  to know it but really the turning point for us was in November we had seen these hot gdp prints we'd
1160.72s:  seen the hot job prints and then concurrently we were starting the natural gas market for our
1164.96s:  pro tier and we came to realization like wait a minute natural gas is 25% of global primary energy
1171.76s:  and we're swimming in it we're not short energy anymore and what does that mean well that that
1179.12s:  might explain why the US didn't fall into a recession for example I see so the first thing is I
1186.80s:  have to give a shout out to doom zoom it's just so great I love the branding on that I love that
1196.16s:  you also as you were talking about this you reminded me of a quote one of my mentors used to say to
1201.68s:  me which was a wise man changes his opinion a fool never does so it seems a pro here now
1209.52s:  going back to this idea of a recession so it sounds like at least as of thus far you're of the
1217.44s:  opinion that we've successfully avoided a recession do you view it still as on the table or do you
1223.12s:  view it as something that has probably been averted I think the odds of a recession before the
1229.36s:  election which was the time frame that we had constrained our analysis to is very low Biden is
1235.60s:  a political animal or at least the people around him who still have access to their full
1240.16s:  mental capacities are political animals and they understand somebody on that team understands
1244.88s:  commodities which is why the SPR draining gambit worked out so well ahead of the midterms
1250.48s:  and I think this move to put a pause on energy exports which will signal to the US market
1257.36s:  that you know a glut might be coming and has really dampened at least contributed to the dampening
1262.88s:  of a drawdown in the natural gas curve futures curve here in the US by the way we originally
1270.56s:  interpreted that incorrectly and that would be the lead point that we make in the piece that we
1276.00s:  publish later this week about grading ourselves on the past 30 to 40 pieces they understand
1284.80s:  that cheap natural gas is good for the economy and they want to do everything it can for the US
1288.72s:  to avoid a recession ahead of the midterms or sorry ahead of the president's election this time
1292.96s:  and so I think they will be successful and look this is not a partisan statement if you hate Biden
1299.76s:  and you think Trump you know was done wrong in the last election and you hope that he wins this time
1305.76s:  you have to be cognizant of the fact that somebody on the Biden team has made a short move
1312.64s:  first in draining the SPR for raw political purposes and now in keeping the world's
1318.88s:  largest source and cheapest source of hydrocarbons stuck in the US
1324.56s:  somebody understands what's going on when Joe had full access to his mental capabilities
1331.04s:  I remember interacting with Senator Biden back in the day when I was in industry and he
1336.96s:  always had a visceral understanding for the price of gasoline at the pump and what it meant for
1340.88s:  national political figures and and so I think it's dangerous to underestimate your political opponents
1349.44s:  assuming that you know perhaps most of your listeners would fall on the conservative side
1354.80s:  I think the fact that the election has the recession hasn't materialized is
1360.24s:  a net tailwind for the incumbents if Republicans were in office and no recession materialized
1367.12s:  when one was expected that would be bullish for them as well the incumbents have
1372.08s:  home field advantage and they are doing whatever they can to avoid a recession and I think you need
1377.20s:  to factor that into your models period whatever it makes you feel about the outcome like this is
1384.56s:  reality that needs to be properly incorporated and how you think about things if you were to
1390.72s:  steal man the argument for a recession to then come back on the table what would that look like?
1397.12s:  Oh you could imagine that the property collapse in China and the industrialization of Europe and
1405.60s:  political polarity in the US leading to societal disruptions I mean I don't think that we're
1413.12s:  free and clear of of any possible downside I'd say like all things being equal plugging two and a
1419.36s:  half-satellar rabies into a manufacturing base is not an environment that's conducive to a recession
1424.32s:  but there's all kinds of ways we can screw up from here and if we do our prediction that we probably
1429.44s:  won't before the election will have been wrong which is fine because we have a protocol to manage
1433.04s:  such things but I think you know a total collapse of China which is possible and you know our
1441.76s:  export partners and import trading partners struggling as much as they are like the US is an
1446.72s:  island right now of economic strength but that you can imagine scenarios where despite the
1454.56s:  energy tailwinds we still manage to find ourselves in a recession. Yeah definitely so thinking of
1462.08s:  those kinds of scenarios what would you oscillate is the most viable if it were to occur again in a
1468.96s:  steel man context and for those that might not be familiar with that we're just we're playing the
1473.12s:  other side of the argument just to always invert yeah always invert and so I think the the most
1479.68s:  likely is a sort of upheaval in China I mean I do think that Xi Jinping runs a sort of Stalin-esque
1490.08s:  form of government where nobody tells them the truth and history teaches us that such systems
1499.44s:  tend to be very meta-stable and can collapse rather quickly and the the property situation the
1505.92s:  stock market gyrations in China you know they're there's such a huge part of the global economy right
1512.88s:  now that a sudden sort of crisis in China could be a catalyst now it should be said that people have
1522.40s:  been predicting this since 60 minutes first expose the ghost cities a decade ago I remember being
1530.56s:  in China entering a ghost city and thinking oh my god this is all a facade that's going to collapse
1535.76s:  that was a long time ago and nothing has collapsed it's the functional equivalent of arguing about the
1543.92s:  you know the the pyramid scheme that is so security yes we all know it is but yet the checks keep
1551.04s:  going out every year the yes the U.S. is is a cesspool of waste and mismanagement and huge deficits and
1558.16s:  the fiscal cliff and all of these things and yet treasure reactions keep going off you know at
1564.00s:  reasonable terms so until it happens it won't happen and if it does happen it would be catastrophic I
1572.40s:  do think we're keeping it close to China and the problem with China is it is impossible for a
1579.04s:  Western analyst to make any sense of the data we have lots of friends in China but even they or
1585.92s:  hesitant to like send you anything meaningful over we chat because they know they're being you know
1590.72s:  monitored and all this other stuff and so China is a giant Ponzi scheme but if there's one thing
1599.04s:  we've learned from the 2008 crisis and the European you know foreign or government bond crisis
1608.64s:  is that Ponzi schemes with the full support of the government can go on for a very long time
1615.44s:  and so you know if you push just everybody knows Europe is a basket case and that's priced in
1621.76s:  but China's a black box and so if you're looking for areas of potential surprise for deviations from
1627.84s:  what the sort of consensus view is I think China is probably a decent place to start
1633.60s:  interesting but you outline a little bit more I know it's a potentially really deep
1641.52s:  objects so I'm not looking to put you through that but just to understand a little bit better your
1645.52s:  assessment of China's a Ponzi scheme can you explain that a bit more? The entire
1652.88s:  engine nothing tired a major source of the engine of economic growth in China for the past 20 years
1658.96s:  has been a speculative bubble in construction mostly of residential apartments but entire city
1668.40s:  infrastructures there was this need to keep that bubble blowing and also a thought that there
1678.72s:  would need to be homes for hundreds of millions of people who eventually came in from the countryside
1686.24s:  and were sort of not migrant laborers but became part of the middle and professional class in China
1692.40s:  and you know when I hear people talking about the demographics of China and they should have
1696.64s:  do a top-down looks I always try to remember that the number that matters most in China is the
1701.36s:  size of its middle class and is that growing and the middle class can be joined by any age group
1708.40s:  you know as soon as they ascend the economic ladder so I wouldn't underestimate China but there are
1716.32s:  thousands of large empty apartment buildings for whom speculation on the level of what we saw in
1730.00s:  the US housing market before they collapsed like 2006 2007 you know a huge amount of individual
1740.00s:  savings i.e household net worth in China is tied to what I believe to be air pockets
1751.20s:  yes you own claim to apartment 281 of building x26 in ghost city a14 nobody wants that
1762.48s:  and you haven't marked in your books at a million bucks and then you just sold it to somebody
1766.48s:  else for 1.1 Ponzi schemes require ever fresh sources of capital before they ultimately collapse
1775.60s:  and this one is perhaps the greatest in the history people have been warning about it for as long
1783.28s:  as we've been paying attention to China and so it's one of those chicken little type situations
1790.88s:  but it is real like I've seen them I've been there and it's all inspired it's jaw dropping
1798.16s:  when you see an entire city designed centrally planned from scratch built a modern specifications
1805.84s:  the copper and the concrete and the wood and the finished carpentry and the plumbing
1812.24s:  all of it built for nothing just sits there and then it becomes a vehicle for speculation
1819.12s:  and the speculation is rampant and then all of those asset values are marked to market and
1825.28s:  perhaps use this collateral for debt and so when you look at the stock market collapse in China
1831.04s:  and you look at the collapse of the various you know um
1836.08s:  construction companies and so on
1839.04s:  it did pretty hard to imagine how the CCP keeps a handle on things now
1845.52s:  they have the full weight of government behind them and the military behind them and the
1851.04s:  desire to keep extending and pretending and so maybe this isn't the year but it it seems clear
1860.64s:  that at the heart of all of this is very little in the way of fundamental economic
1866.40s:  you know these investments aren't in producing assets they are in assets that are basically
1873.36s:  then become vehicles for speculation and it is staggering like
1878.32s:  in the years where I was traveling to China you could see the change
1882.64s:  and like it's important to like go to these places people making fun of Tucker Carlson
1887.92s:  because of his trip to Moscow and you know how impressed he was with the subway and the grocery
1892.32s:  stores and how beautiful Moscow is the city I would say most of the people making fun of
1897.20s:  Tucker have never actually traveled to these major cities and as you do travel around the world
1903.68s:  you see the differences and you get a you get a sense of course some of it is managed and yes
1908.72s:  you know western business people get treated differently then the locals and all of that stuff
1912.56s:  but there is still something very visible traveling there and one of the ways this manifest for me
1917.28s:  is and we've written about this from the earliest days there's techno arrogance that we have in
1921.36s:  the west that the Chinese and the Indians and the Russians were would be unable to keep the Russian
1925.68s:  energy complex going in the face of western sanctions it's just it's just redevignaments I
1930.56s:  toured the major universities in India and China and lectured at some of them and you see the
1937.28s:  army of petroleum engineers the China is putting out every year and how difficult it is to get into
1942.16s:  IIT the IT school system in India and how everybody ever met in my life who had a degree from Moscow
1948.32s:  state was just a genius we used to call it the genius school we underestimate these people at
1952.88s:  our own peril and by the way let's take a look at the US university system in comparison like
1957.52s:  who are we kidding so you know until you go there and you see it and you live it you feel
1963.20s:  that you touch it you eat with the people you you stay with the people my friend Nate Hagen's who
1967.44s:  you know probably has different views than we do great youtuber and thinker just spent I think
1973.76s:  six or seven weeks in India and then his response to having been there for the first time resonated
1979.28s:  with me because I've been to India many times and and and I I have sympathy for him or not sympathy I
1985.52s:  can understand how he can be so blown away by actually going and visiting and and if you don't
1991.12s:  go and you don't visit you don't know you just don't and so like you can make fun of Tucker all
1995.60s:  you want at least he had the you know what to go and he scored an interview with Putin and I watched
2000.96s:  it and sorted a billion other people and it was interesting to me I think Putin got a lot of
2006.16s:  stuff wrong but I wanted to hear it and and and kudos to Tucker for having done it definitely on
2011.92s:  that exact threat I actually think that that's one of the the coolest things about people that
2015.52s:  join the military is because it gives them a chance to at least see some other places
2021.20s:  because I do find Americans in general and I'm I'm a red blooded American I'm a patriot but I do
2027.60s:  think a lot of Americans are very close-minded and we don't have a respect for other places what
2035.28s:  other places value how other places behave and we use our value system for them all that kind of
2040.88s:  stuff it's really interesting to me yeah I would say a very important follow-on to that which is
2048.40s:  because nobody's gone anywhere and nobody's served in the military we have a very
2054.00s:  loose relationship with war and and I think we we would do well to have a little bit of higher bar
2063.28s:  to have pick and fights with powerful people around the world you know you you go into a bar
2067.60s:  today and there's a guy there and he's got a cut off gene jacket on he's ripped 64 looks like he
2073.20s:  was tied in for a D1 school and he's got tattoos up and down his arms and he's looking around
2078.40s:  and saying if anybody sits in the stool next to me I'm going to punch him in the face so you're
2082.00s:  just going to go sit in that stool now give it a little bit of wide berth you know like we live
2087.68s:  in a dangerous world with people who could do violence to us and the exact same mental processing
2093.76s:  you do when you walk into a bar or you walk into a public situation where you your gut instinct your
2099.76s:  spotty sense tells you that you know something might go down here and I'm going to like keep my back
2104.56s:  to the wall and keep an eye on the exit we ought to have that in our foreign policy and I think
2110.48s:  too many of the people in DC have too low regard for the cost of war because they're not the ones
2117.44s:  paying you know cash in those checks and and have too little appreciation for the other cultures
2124.40s:  of the world and here we are world war three basically and we've sleep walked into it and that's
2131.28s:  I think significant challenge. Talk to me about the world war three comment. Well I mean I
2139.44s:  often wonder when everybody sort of in the US for example thought world war two began and I think
2147.44s:  they would all probably say when Pearl Harbor started but if you go back in history you'll see
2152.16s:  world war two actually really began when Japan invaded China in the 30s and everything that
2157.84s:  followed from that led to the dominoes that became world war two and I wonder when historians will
2164.80s:  look back at this time and say world war three started we have a proxy war between Ukraine and
2170.80s:  Russia which is essentially a war between NATO and Russia which is essentially a war between
2176.00s:  the US and Russia that's a hot war I've spent the last couple of months going down the rabbit hole of
2181.84s:  these these mappers were chronicling the day-to-day ebbs and flows of the line of contact between
2188.24s:  Russia and Ukraine and it probably won't write about it but it's interesting to me and because of
2194.64s:  the connections to the energy markets is how I sort of got into this because Russia is an important
2198.56s:  you know the energy exporter and then when you compare what you can learn just from open source
2204.48s:  from people that you sort of categorize people into their sort of Russia focus or Ukraine
2209.52s:  bent or some people that try to be down the middle and and then you could be two three weeks ahead
2214.16s:  of the mainstream media and then you see how things are characterized in the media totally inconsistent
2218.56s:  with reality on the ground you begin to question of course you know what you're being fed
2226.48s:  we're in war war three like we have that conflict in Ukraine which by the way when I watch those
2233.52s:  videos you see that Putin is just leveling these towns in these villages right I mean
2237.68s:  step one is they carpet bomb them step two as they they they send in the stormtroopers and then
2243.12s:  step three is they occupy them and raise the Russian flag and they're just doing it over and over
2246.72s:  and over again and they've got complete domination of the air and I think one of the underappreciated
2254.88s:  catalysts say or blacks one events for 2024 is is a rapid collapse of Ukraine and so lensky being
2260.40s:  ousted in a coup I think that's real I think that's possible it's being totally downplayed in the west
2265.28s:  and market participants need to have that on the radar now we have a kinetic conflict in the middle
2269.12s:  least and where the ones are being Israel and much of the rest of the Middle East is uniting against the
2276.32s:  US it's not being reported at all how we are being pummeled at the United Nations both in the security
2283.36s:  council then I think eventually at the floor of the general assembly the world is lining up
2289.04s:  against our support for Israel whatever your views on the war are like I get again it's a controversial
2293.04s:  topic I spend a lot of time studying Israel and its history and but just agnastically as an analyst
2301.04s:  we're losing the public relations war here and then you have the tensions with China and by the way
2307.76s:  if China is that blacks one event with the property collapse and so on the CCP will create a war
2313.20s:  that's what that's what you know dictators do and so we have this strange cyber attack last week
2324.24s:  which kind of caught our eye you know like literally as I'm talking to you trending
2331.92s:  on on axe which I still use as a as a news following source is World War Three
2339.52s:  and I think we're a lot closer World War Three look we have the Houthis shutting down the Red Sea we
2344.72s:  have the war in Gaza we have potential spread to the north we have a potential direct kinetic
2350.48s:  conflict with with Iran and by the way over the weekend I'm watching and this is not reported
2355.92s:  in the US at all I'm watching you know geolocated videos of $10,000 drones tracking billion dollar
2367.92s:  patriot missile systems and guiding cheap missiles to destroy them I've seen three such videos
2374.72s:  in the past week these run a billion dollars upon and cheap drone warfare is changing the battlefield
2385.92s:  have we caught up to this as congress debates 60 billion dollars to send into that you know in
2392.56s:  freno but it may be that that's what we should do I'm not making a case either way but I'm watching
2399.12s:  billion dollar patriot missiles being destroyed by weaponry that I personally could afford to buy
2407.68s:  I'm of course I would have ever you know I'm not gonna engage in an arms dealing but I could
2412.32s:  afford to destroy a billion dollar patriotism today and that's profound and I don't think
2418.96s:  our bureaucracy has cut up to this and a big ahaha for us is the same architects of our insane
2425.36s:  sanctions policy and Europe's crazy energy policy are the political force behind the military
2431.76s:  strategy and it look as you probably know a military is only as good as its political leaders like
2436.88s:  the troops can be well trained but they're told what to do and if those decisions are terrible the
2442.56s:  troops suffer and if you have very bad political issue I don't care how good the military is
2448.80s:  that military is in trouble assuming they follow orders um and so it's pretty we're at a very
2455.12s:  dangerous point here in the west we have the president who I think objectively is is not all there
2464.40s:  and who is insisting on sleepwalking us into the major war with at least one and potentially two
2474.16s:  you know nuclear superpowers and I'm old enough to remember when wars required of other Congress
2479.76s:  so it's scary times
2484.56s:  based on that I can follow a lot of your train of thought how do you define
2489.76s:  wool war three like how do you define a wool war because me there's a slight disconnect there
2497.04s:  at least in terms of the way that you're laying out the timeline meet before when you were saying
2502.40s:  and maybe I misheard but before when you're saying that we're in war three look what's going on right now
2508.40s:  is or at least the third time in the past 100 years Russia is marching from east to west and
2519.36s:  raising the lands as they moved towards western Europe um that war is being funded by the US
2528.72s:  so in the prior two times that this has happened in the past 100 years we were allies with them
2534.16s:  and the opponent was Germany now we're allied with Germany and we're funding basically Ukrainian
2539.76s:  resistance and if you doubt that you can just see how quickly Ukrainian resistance has been
2547.36s:  falling as weapons supply has dried up from the west and of course that makes total sense
2554.80s:  we are funding and providing the weapons for is Israel's war in the Middle East again
2559.92s:  when everything of October 7th whatever you views are on Palestinians right to self-determination
2564.56s:  and all those things forget about all that there is a hot war going on in the Middle East and we are
2569.76s:  supplying weapons or one side which means we're at war with the other side we're not supplying
2575.36s:  weapons for the Palestinians or go the US is at war with the Palestinians I mean I think it's we
2582.16s:  should just say it and we should debate whether that's the right thing to do but that is what we're
2587.52s:  doing and then we're gearing up for a confrontation with China, vis-a-vis Taiwan so it feels to me
2598.48s:  like 1941 before Pearl Harbor we were supporting the UK you know land lease the whole nine yards
2608.24s:  we were supporting certain parts of a European war which means we're effectively at war with the
2612.88s:  other side we were supporting the Russians in their war with Germany and we were supporting China
2618.88s:  in their war with Japan and then when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor we became officially part of
2625.60s:  the war but if all of that is true then World War II actually started when Japan first invaded China
2632.96s:  in the early 30s and Hitler came to power in 33 and all of those events sort of led to what we now
2639.68s:  call World War II I see the echoes of that pattern here today I see yeah I from my ignorant
2648.64s:  perspective I think that that suffers a little bit from hindsight because then if you look back at
2654.80s:  any conflict between two countries that then didn't have the rest of the war
2659.84s:  sure sure then we've had you would agree that if we end up having a hot war with China then the
2666.08s:  collective action of the past three years was probably in hindsight we'll be labeled as war war through
2671.68s:  I mean I would agree that that's a catalyst for the World War but I wouldn't consider that
2678.16s:  World War because so let me give you a different view 110,000 people died of fentanyl overdose last year in the US
2686.80s:  China makes all the precursors for that and if you look over the fentanyl deaths are it's basically the
2692.40s:  US and Canada how is that not a chemical warfare act by China on the US it's a piece we've pondered
2698.16s:  writing we haven't written it yet we've done some studying of it they know where the precursor
2703.84s:  factories are they know how to shut nothing happens in China without the CCP's approval
2710.00s:  drugs finding their way to directly into the US and through Mexico are at least with a knowingly
2715.92s:  deadly poison that is killing 100,000 military age people a year I mean just because it's not
2726.32s:  tanks in artillery and planes doesn't mean we're not a war just this week we got another balloon
2733.36s:  flying over the US I don't know what any of that means but like cyber attack last week like there
2740.80s:  the modern embodiment of war between superpowers need not necessarily be the traditional
2748.64s:  game of acts you know like it it it 100,000 people died last year from something that China is
2756.72s:  doing on purpose to the American Peter are we at war with China I would say no we're not
2766.80s:  yeah I would say perhaps we should ponder whether we are because they might be at war with us and
2771.92s:  we don't know it yeah and I think we're in direct competition to your point I think with places like
2778.32s:  that we continually prod one another to find weaknesses but again just from my layman's perspective war
2786.32s:  is a defined thing so how do you think the CCP would react if we were doing something that we
2792.40s:  knew were killing 100,000 of their citizens a year I'm not convinced that we're not
2798.32s:  yeah well it's fair enough there we go even more proof yeah I don't know my view is in 10 years
2803.92s:  and 20 years time we will look back at 2022 2023 and 2024 and characterize this time period as
2811.28s:  the beginning of World War III I hope I'm wrong by the way yeah because I have you know draft eligible
2816.56s:  children yeah I mean it's it really is a fascinating perspective and I enjoy you sharing it with me
2823.92s:  because it just it continues to elucidate how complex of an environment that we're in we're even
2831.04s:  you and I we're talking about a specific term just a term yeah and meanwhile behind what we're
2838.24s:  talking about are just massive pieces moving and to your point I do fully agree with you
2844.48s:  that this this time could absolutely be a precursor when you look at the relationship between the US
2856.64s:  Russia and China kind of that trio what comes to mind I think a tragedy of missed opportunities
2865.68s:  comes to mind I think in a world where the three great powers behave in a manner that sort of
2880.96s:  prioritized mutual respect things could have evolved quite differently but they didn't and things
2893.04s:  have evolved the way they have I think for example in a piece we wrote eight last year I believe
2900.64s:  the west hemisphere need not even mess around with Europe or the Middle East or China we have so
2906.00s:  much here that we could just do you know I'm old enough to remember when the the Department of
2910.16s:  Defense was meant to defend the US like let's start there you know what what do we do it all over
2917.60s:  the world and defending you know shipping lanes in a lease so that China could have access to
2923.28s:  energy let China let China's Navy take care of the Middle East and they don't have one well they
2928.08s:  best start best start build one you know like it what are we doing you've let's say we're doing that
2934.00s:  out of the kindness of our hearts no I I do think there is a very strong look I think Eisenhower's
2941.68s:  right I think the military industrial complex in the US is is extremely strong and greedy and
2950.16s:  is pillaging the US treasury spending blood that's not theirs I think our bar to go into war should be
2957.44s:  much higher I think Lindsey Graham is one of the most reprehensible figures in modern politics I
2964.56s:  I see him on Fox News demanding we start carpet bombing and raining refineries like get in the plane
2970.32s:  you do it like what what are we doing like you first you know like that by the way are you ready for
2978.32s:  the counter punch you know walk up to that guy at the bar in the sleeveless gene jacket with the
2984.72s:  with the you know rip muscles in the tattoos and sit on that stool next to him and put your
2990.32s:  finger in his face I mean go ahead let's see how it goes it's insane like we we have this view
2998.32s:  that we're the dominant superpower we could do whatever we want and I just don't think that is
3005.44s:  conducive to world peace or economic development or human prosperity and I think it risks
3016.64s:  nuclear war like can we have a vote in congress please
3019.92s:  I it's mind boggling to me the flippant way in which major US politicians like Lindsey Graham
3032.72s:  think war is in our kid game and all they got to do is put more quarters in the machine and they
3037.52s:  could keep playing like we have vulnerabilities one of the reasons you don't go to war as you might
3044.64s:  lose it and and lord knows our track record in this regard in the past few decades is not
3053.20s:  been a glorious one I remember people hanging on to us air force jets as they flew out of
3059.92s:  SKS tank not that long ago like what did we do and the sacrifice of the countless men and women
3068.96s:  and largely American soldiers who died there during that war what was it for and how tragic is that
3077.12s:  same thing with Iraq same thing with Libya what are we doing like can we take a beat can we take a pause
3084.72s:  can we have a national conversation about the neocons and whether we need to be the world's police
3092.48s:  how about we start being the US's police I don't know what do your thoughts on the concept of like
3100.32s:  a defense and death the big thing from military doctrine I'm curious what your thoughts are on it
3106.88s:  I'm unfamiliar with the terms so maybe you can yeah not served in the military which is why I
3112.32s:  perhaps have a lot of respect for people who have from from a defensive position like if if my
3119.12s:  notebook is this is the border this is where we are and then this is where the enemy is defense
3126.00s:  and depth is a concept where we don't want our first lines of defense to be here we want it to be
3132.16s:  here here and here here here I get that where does it end how much is enough and by the way like
3142.56s:  let's start with our border where you know we have 10 million people crossing the border to
3148.96s:  I've flown into the US countless times and stood in customs and immigration lines and make sure that
3154.80s:  you have make sure that you have your papers in order and and all these other things and we have
3160.40s:  10 million people crossing the border many of whom are military age men again are we in World War
3168.40s:  how many of them are from China how many of them are from Iran or their proxies how many of them
3173.36s:  are from the drug cartels I saw a story last week where gangs of people that have come over the border
3182.16s:  are rating rich neighborhoods in Detroit and bringing their loot back down to Texas
3189.52s:  like this is coming like 10 million people is a lot and the disparity between what you and I do
3195.60s:  taking your shoes off at TSA and all of that security theater standing in line for an hour at a time
3204.00s:  at Lagardia or pick your favorite airport at land and all here meanwhile people just scrolling across
3209.52s:  the border and like where where is national defense is that literally not the definition of national
3218.80s:  defense the book that you just held up the binding of that book is that not like does not begin with
3224.00s:  the US border and somehow approximately when you crane matters more than the border between
3231.04s:  Mexico and Texas I think one one thing I would offer to that at least from my perspective is I
3237.20s:  I think we when we when people talk about these things we fall into kind of like binary positions and
3241.76s:  I'm not sure that I've seen anywhere somebody say or even in the way that we behave that one is
3247.92s:  discreetly more important than the other now I get probably your point based on where the money is
3252.64s:  flowing the amount of money the actions were taking those kinds of things so on that on that thread
3260.40s:  though what would you suggest for the border out of curiosity I just think having interacted with
3268.32s:  US immigration for a fair part of my life and always try to do so legally that like we have laws
3277.84s:  for reason and they should either be enforced or not and anybody who's cross bridge to Canada or
3284.64s:  you know flown in from overseas and I flown all over the world and in every country I've landed
3290.64s:  I have to produce my passport they ask me what I'm doing there I fill up forms I am a privileged
3296.40s:  guest of that government while I'm in their country which is their national territory there's
3301.20s:  sovereign territory and I think a country without borders that it complies as no country at all
3307.60s:  and I understand that there's humanitarian issues and all that but we used to handle those in the
3312.48s:  you know we had we the US has always been a country of immigrants and the assimilation of immigrants
3319.20s:  into the country is part of the fabric the tapestry of what makes this country great I'm very much
3326.00s:  for a vibrant legal immigration system and even the people that are desperate to get here you know
3334.96s:  they do have rights and we should treat them with dignity and respect because of humans but there
3338.32s:  has to be law and order there has to be a system it can't just be people you know hordes of people
3347.12s:  crawling over barbed wires most of whom are desperate to just get here and to live the American dream
3352.00s:  I am not casting a white net on the composition of the people that are coming here but it doesn't take
3356.64s:  many we're bad apples the whole point of customs and border control is to prevent bad apples from
3363.68s:  getting into your country like that the post 9-11 world is one we've all submitted to because we were
3369.04s:  afraid of a reoccurrence of what happened on 9-11 so we agree that an uncontrolled border situation
3376.64s:  is conducive to 13 people figuring out how to get flying lessons and blowing up a bunch of buildings
3382.08s:  in the US like so if that was if it was worth it for us to give up so many freedoms and to spend
3387.84s:  so much money and to frankly lose the wars that we have lost how is it not worth it now because we
3393.04s:  don't know what the next threat is going to be and so I think it all starts with control at the
3398.00s:  border and if you don't have that then do you really have a country and so I have deep sympathy and
3402.56s:  visceral sympathy for the people that are desperate to get the US because the US is look the direction
3408.24s:  of flow is in one the arrow is in one way right it's coming here because this is a great place
3414.32s:  I understand that and I have deep sympathy for it but we have to have rules we have to have
3420.48s:  controls and we have to have processes that make sure that we eliminate or identify the people on
3426.88s:  terrorist watch list for example who are slipping through the border today or M13 gang members who
3431.68s:  are slipping through the border today or you know various other cartel members that are slipping
3435.92s:  through the border today and they are and it's just not an eyeball that they are like there will be
3441.52s:  victims in the US because of that and this is a failure of government and it's most primary duty
3447.44s:  which is to defend the nation's borders as it exists and the citizens within it that's what
3453.60s:  actually the Department of Court defense is is meant to do you have always thought a big
3462.32s:  contributing factor is that we have so many holes like once somebody is in US they're kind of
3471.92s:  it's very difficult to manage that because I in the reason why I asked the question is I
3477.04s:  agree in terms of needing to control a border needing to have a defined process I think
3484.24s:  fully ampage I think one of the the tricky parts is I consider the problem is like we know it's not
3491.52s:  solved and I'm to be clear I'm not against a physical barrier I think a physical barrier is good
3496.80s:  I think something like that doesn't solve it though not that difficult to circumnavigate something
3502.56s:  like that so to me it seems like there needs to be some sort of structural adjustment within the
3508.88s:  country yeah I think I think the first thing we need is an agreement that such things are
3514.48s:  necessary and that doesn't exist to one side with for whatever reason thinks that in open borders
3521.60s:  advantageous to them and so that's like the biggest political issue is an honest open discussion
3528.96s:  about what does it mean to be a country like again having stood in line for as many hours as I have
3540.96s:  like it's it's profound to me that we've just decided in this particular instance the rules don't
3546.96s:  counsel then why do I have to stand on the line of TSA right I mean why am I taking my shoes off
3552.48s:  I'm not the shoe bomber the the government knows who I am I've done the TSA pre-check they know all
3557.36s:  about my internet search history they know about my bank accounts they know about my but they know
3560.80s:  everything about me I'm no threat right but still I take off my shoes and oops I have an iPad on
3569.28s:  top of a computer so my bag gets searched because it looks funny on the screen and we all pretend
3574.32s:  like this is making anybody safer on a plane when they know I'm not a threat right they have
3580.16s:  the systems to know I'm not a threat believe me if the government wanted to get rid of me that have
3585.12s:  no shortage of reasons to do so like this is this is the world we live it and yet we all submit to this
3592.40s:  complicate theater of security when we have a completely open border you know um both in
3600.32s:  the north and the south by the way like people getting into Canada then coming in from north same
3604.24s:  thing I've been on the Canadian border in a car and interrogated and randomly selected for a full
3610.56s:  search and they they basically take tools and take apart your car looking for you know I don't know
3615.12s:  grandma marijuana or whatever like how is this making either side safer I don't know I just stand by
3621.84s:  and let them because I know there's nothing in my car and so on but um they they treat us that way
3630.48s:  and yet we have this situation that just seems very incongruent there's something
3634.80s:  deep and malicious about what's going on that I don't understand
3639.84s:  that's my visceral response to your question yeah interesting really interesting I know that we're
3646.72s:  we're up at time here I had one last question for you is you're looking out over 2024
3652.80s:  what's most interesting to you in life I think the thing that's most interesting to me is
3658.00s:  whether and how fast the in create situation resolves because I think again many in the west have
3666.08s:  their heads in the sand as to what's actually going on on the ground and it is readily accessible to
3671.84s:  anybody who's willing to look and invest the time to have a pretty good understanding of what's
3676.24s:  going on on the ground and the contrast between what you can learn on your own and how it's portrayed
3685.60s:  in the major western media outlets would shock people if they actually took the time to do it
3690.80s:  it would really make them ponder who it is that works at these organizations and what is their
3695.52s:  real agenda and I actually think part of the success of Dumburg is we are just authentically
3701.68s:  ourselves we right what we believe we're not afraid to be wrong and we're not beholden to some
3709.52s:  you know messaging that the government would like to put out there and so
3715.60s:  that that story wraps everything that is interesting to us it's connected to energy
3721.36s:  it's connected to the ever changing role of the media and the in particular the emergence of
3731.44s:  sort of micro sources of news where people begin to trust one outlet over another for their own
3738.40s:  reasons and instead of having three news anchors that dominate the narrative you have
3745.28s:  five six hundred major sources of news that people select into their news flow and in our own
3750.32s:  small way for the two hundred and ten thousand people that subscribe to Dumburg hopefully we've
3755.28s:  been able to carve out a bit of an interesting source for them but I think the biggest disconnect
3764.00s:  on the board today is how the western media is portraying this situation in Ukraine and what
3771.44s:  we or I happen to think is coming interesting time will tell but yeah absolutely awesome chatting
3781.44s:  with you I enjoy the dialogue I enjoy your perspectives I always have an opportunity to learn a
3785.28s:  lot and so does the audience so thank you for hanging out I will throw links to your substack
3790.88s:  in the notes below but is there anywhere else that you want to send people to that's that's where
3795.36s:  we are Dumburg.substack.com we're about to embark on a potential rebrand as we were able to eject
3802.16s:  a squatter from Dumburg.com so now we now own that domain name and we might do a little rebrand
3808.40s:  there we'll see in the coming weeks and months ahead but for now everything we do is at Dumburg.substack.com
3813.20s:  and look you know I I think this conversation probably went in a different direction than we
3816.88s:  were planning but I very much enjoyed it and I appreciate the opportunity to talk about a few
3821.20s:  things that we probably won't ever write about yeah yeah I had a blast I really enjoy these and it's
3827.20s:  a great way for other people to hear different perspectives conversations about complex things so
3831.52s:  thank you very much for your time. Back to you soon. Take care.
