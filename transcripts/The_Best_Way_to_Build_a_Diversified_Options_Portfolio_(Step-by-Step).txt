0.12s: as a Trader you are taught to diversify
2.36s: even as an investor this is one of the
4.44s: basic concepts of building a robust
7.48s: approach to investing as an umbrella
10.04s: however like most things in markets and
11.72s: trading specifically there's a lot of
13.36s: nuance and in that Nuance is the
15.92s: potential to really increase your
18.32s: returns or really hurt your returns so
20.92s: the goal of this video is to walk
22.24s: through that exact Nuance I want to walk
25.08s: you through the process of building a
26.88s: diversified options portfolio
28.88s: specifically bu built around your use
32.28s: case as an individual because not all
35.08s: diversification is created the same and
37.04s: that has to be kept in mind so let's
39.76s: start first with just defining this idea
43.36s: of diversification and there's basic
46.80s: definitions and then there's common use
48.92s: definitions we're going to use the
49.96s: common use definition here it's more
51.60s: practical this is essentially where you
53.44s: spread your money your Investments
56.40s: across different asset classes and the
58.92s: idea is as some asset classes are doing
61.56s: well others won't be doing well and
63.40s: they'll kind of balance each other out
64.68s: and reduce some of the overall risk
66.56s: however with options as you know options
68.72s: add complexity and more elements to a
71.20s: trade and we can achieve even greater
74.32s: types of diversification when we do
76.80s: trade options so the first thing that I
79.92s: want to start with really it's the first
81.68s: two things on this list three things is
84.52s: we really want to understand what our
88.00s: current assessment is of the market the
90.92s: reason for that is if we're going to
93.36s: tailor and customize our diversification
96.96s: approach to suit the current market
98.80s: needs we have to have an understanding
101.40s: of what the current markets are and what
103.56s: we want our portfolio to look like a
105.64s: great example last year in 2024 in the
108.36s: beginning of the year I was long small
111.00s: caps because I was expecting rate Cuts
113.36s: earlier in the year based on positioning
115.88s: and then after a couple months it ended
117.44s: up not happening so then I had to pivot
120.48s: that position into other things that
122.12s: were more topical and relevant to the
123.96s: market as it sat at that time so that's
126.80s: based on an economic and stock market
129.92s: analysis and then updating that analysis
132.52s: you have to start with that because for
134.68s: example if you're really really bullish
137.04s: that will lead to one portfolio
138.88s: structure as compared to if you're kind
140.48s: of bullish but you're kind of nervous
142.00s: about a downturn so that will lead to
143.64s: another which blends beautifully into
146.52s: the second thing on this list which is
148.36s: that of purpose a lot of times people
150.96s: default into doing things because it
153.76s: sounds smart or it's something that
155.92s: they've been told that they should do so
158.24s: then we just kind of start doing it
159.72s: without really thinking about the
161.16s: purpose and does it apply to us so what
163.36s: this means is if we are thinking about
165.24s: building a diversified portfolio what is
167.72s: the actual purpose for you great example
171.12s: let's say that you're really really
172.64s: bullish you think the Market's going to
174.00s: go up a lot and you're just typically
176.68s: taught to diversify but you're an active
178.92s: Trader so you're going to to use
180.60s: momentum moving averages and stuff like
182.92s: that to scale in and scale out of your
184.44s: position which inherently manages your
186.04s: risk so then you might say to yourself
187.52s: well I don't actually really want to
189.20s: diversify that much because if I have a
191.56s: bunch of different non-correlated
193.48s: returns and I get the move that I think
195.92s: is going to happen the stock market's
197.16s: going to go up a lot well I'm not really
198.80s: going to benefit from that as much and
200.96s: I'm already going to manage risk to the
202.44s: downside by scaling out of positions
205.16s: getting hit at stop losses and stuff
206.92s: like that so when we're talking about
208.72s: this idea of diversification it's really
211.08s: really important to Define what you're
213.52s: doing and why so some common uses for
217.32s: diversification the first one you
218.76s: already heard is absolutely to reduce
221.52s: portfolio risk where we have some things
224.36s: that make money at a point in time and
226.20s: other things that might be losing money
227.92s: at that same point in time and they kind
229.60s: of offset one another a little bit the
231.24s: second purpose is actually more
233.40s: appropriate for somebody like me where I
236.04s: primarily am managing risk through
238.44s: sizing and the actual management of the
240.84s: strategy so the second purpose is if
244.52s: we're trying to trade any kind of Market
248.00s: condition so that means when the
249.32s: Market's going up down sideways broad
251.64s: market trends you have to have different
255.00s: kinds of things in your portfolio to
257.40s: take advantage of different Market
259.44s: forces that are going on at a given
261.36s: point in time great example right now
263.52s: it's the middle of January as of making
266.24s: this video and things like Quantum
268.88s: computing just got crushed because of
271.80s: the CES keynote speech and a lot of
274.40s: names like R GTI and so on and so forth
277.32s: they got slammed after that and they
279.80s: started making a little bit of a
281.04s: recovery so there might be an
282.72s: opportunity there specifically in
285.68s: tradeing the recovery move there there's
287.64s: also earnings going on right now which
289.96s: provides a non-correlated return Source
292.32s: from volatility so I'm inherently
295.04s: diversifying by trading these different
297.00s: kinds of profit mechanisms simply
298.64s: because there are different things that
300.32s: make sense right now so that's the
302.52s: second purpose of diversification in my
304.92s: opinion is to be able to take advantage
306.52s: of different things at the same time now
308.36s: when we're deciding what our
310.40s: diversification is going to look like we
312.12s: have to decide what our portfolio
314.60s: exposure is going to look like and what
316.20s: we're comfortable with the reason why
317.72s: that's so important is because of
319.88s: reverse planning it's when we begin with
322.04s: the end in mind it's where we're
323.72s: visualizing what this thing is supposed
325.68s: to look like and then we kind of create
328.76s: a road map to get to whatever that end
331.84s: state is from where we are today so what
333.80s: that looks like specifically for Target
335.68s: portfolio exposures we might say I want
337.40s: to earn at least 10% per year cool if I
340.16s: have $100,000 that tells me I need to
342.68s: make a certain amount on average every
344.76s: single month in order to hit that at the
347.00s: end of the year so then I can figure out
349.84s: what my portfolio exposure needs to be
352.08s: based on my risk management plans both
353.92s: profit and loss for all of the trades
355.48s: that I'm going to put on because like a
357.36s: good Trader you are defining that before
359.00s: you enter your position so you can see
361.08s: how many positions you need to have on
362.84s: at a given point in time in order to
364.24s: maintain that Glide slope that's the
366.36s: purpose here so now let's talk about the
368.36s: actual elements of diversification
370.80s: within options there's a bunch of them
373.08s: you've already heard me use the term
374.76s: correlation a few times this is the
376.44s: relationship between two different
378.84s: Securities one thing to know about
381.28s: correlation is that it is not static a
385.08s: great way to visualize this is if we pop
387.24s: over to the platform and we take a look
389.04s: at bitco coin and E Minis and we
391.12s: literally talked about this on a live
392.52s: stream not too long ago so that's why
394.12s: it's up and I want you to take a note of
396.92s: the correlation across all these
398.48s: different time frames so this is using a
400.20s: 3-day 5day 10day 30-day 60 90 180 360
406.00s: and let's take a look in the short-term
407.56s: correlation if I eyeball this short-term
409.92s: correlation I see 3day and 5day it's
413.20s: like 95% however if I go out here to a
416.68s: 30-day correlation it's actually like 57
419.56s: % and then if I go out again to a
421.96s: 360-day correlation it's like 90% so
425.12s: what I'm showing you is the relationship
427.16s: between these tickers changes so then
430.60s: when we're analyzing correlation we need
432.44s: to do two things we need to make it
434.20s: relevant to the time frame we're trading
436.08s: but then you also need to look at it
437.32s: across different time frames to have a
438.72s: sense so like this is a great example
441.08s: even though there's one period where
442.76s: it's like 57% correlated which is on the
445.68s: lower end in general it's above 70 so
449.40s: it's generally correlated there are
451.36s: periods where that correlation becomes
453.00s: dislocated but that's pretty constrained
455.64s: here that's the point next we have the
458.00s: Direction one of the beautiful things
459.84s: about trading options is you can trade
461.64s: things in all different directions with
463.80s: different kinds of strategies which is
465.52s: the next bullet point we kind of blend
467.12s: these two together so with Direction I
469.72s: can trade things up down sideways with
472.88s: strategies I can trade things with long
475.60s: premium or short premium long premium
478.28s: will be undef find profit defined risk
481.52s: it will suffer things like Theta Decay
483.68s: it will be think long gamma think like
486.08s: that short options or short premium will
489.24s: have defined profit undefined risk it
493.00s: will be collecting Theta which benefits
496.72s: the position and the way that those
499.24s: trades perform over different time
501.60s: frames will be very different so you'll
503.36s: see in a little bit when we get into an
504.92s: example we can build something that
506.84s: blends all this stuff together so as
509.60s: I've already noted we can go across
511.88s: different kinds of expirations and we
513.76s: can also trade tickers of varying
516.36s: volatility levels one of the things you
518.36s: will have heard if you sell premium
519.88s: frequently is oh you know you got to
521.44s: look for stuff that's high volatility to
523.68s: sell well that might be okay but there's
526.56s: a lot of drawbacks to that because if
528.12s: you build a portfolio where you're
529.80s: selling premium only in high volatility
531.96s: tickers guess what your portfolio is
533.84s: going to be super volatile that's what
535.84s: volatility is so if you're okay with
538.00s: that cool but if you're not okay with
540.08s: that then you have to consider what
541.64s: you're building let's talk about some
543.20s: common mistakes these are pretty simple
545.36s: but defaulting to a specific kind of
547.32s: strategy the issue with this is you
549.60s: start to stack things together and then
552.16s: you have a portfolio that kind of looks
553.64s: like one thing so let's say you like to
555.08s: sell puts if all you do is sell puts
557.60s: you're going to have a bunch of stuff on
558.92s: that is defined profit undefined risk
562.80s: and is going to be probably giving you
564.68s: some pain potentially from something
566.48s: like gamma so even if you prefer to sell
569.44s: that's fine not my Approach but it's
571.60s: fine as long as we're including some
573.92s: other kinds of strategies to help offset
576.08s: some of that concentration next super
579.24s: super simple is mizing trades in the
583.20s: overall portfolio this is what happens
585.48s: when we're too focused on the profit
587.76s: side of the equation and we're not
589.48s: paying attention to the risk side of the
591.12s: equation and then the last Super common
593.92s: mistake is when we do not think about
596.64s: how the trade is going to behave over
598.88s: its lifespan so what that means again
601.60s: going back to the short putut example if
603.08s: you're trading a bunch of short puts and
604.96s: you're just thinking about the credit
606.32s: that you're going to collect and how
607.40s: it's a high probability trade but you're
609.32s: not realizing the fact that as you hold
611.44s: short puts gamma big moves in gamma can
614.60s: really cause a lot of volatility in the
616.56s: portfolio which can be unnerving if
618.92s: you're not thinking about it that's the
620.68s: kind of stuff we're talking about here
622.36s: now let's talk about a stepbystep
624.84s: process to build your very own
627.76s: Diversified options portfolio first
630.44s: thing we start by establishing goals
632.60s: next we come up with our current
634.20s: disposition for the economy and the
636.16s: stock market this informs how we are
639.16s: going to use our portfolio how much do
642.00s: we want to use how do we want to split
643.92s: it up we can use things like beta
646.04s: waiting to put the risk of whatever
648.96s: you're looking at in the context of a
650.76s: single underlying I have a video that
652.48s: talks all about beta waiting I'll link
654.64s: to that in the notes below for me I then
658.32s: allocate I figure out how much money is
660.44s: going to go into my core and speculative
662.76s: allocation if you don't split your
664.60s: portfolio up like I do this is
666.60s: essentially where you divvy up your
668.04s: money where you're going to put it into
669.52s: what trades and why if you're curious
671.64s: how I manage a portfolio I have a link
673.56s: to that I will throw that in the notes
675.76s: below next we start figuring out the
679.16s: individual strategies that we're going
681.16s: to put on to make sure that we have a
682.92s: mix of different directional plays if
686.00s: you want that we have long and short
688.48s: premium tra
689.76s: if you want notice how I'm saying if you
691.88s: want because again this is relative to
694.92s: your perception of the current market
696.92s: another example using the short putut
698.88s: example let's say that you really like
700.40s: selling short puts in spy and that's
702.60s: pretty much what you do if you're
704.12s: expecting a big Market contraction for
706.96s: some reason whatever that reason is
708.80s: based on your research you might not
710.92s: want to have all of your portfolio in
713.00s: short puts because the risk reward
715.76s: profile on that starts to become skewed
718.56s: if that risk ends up being realized so
721.40s: this is exactly why you have to start
723.72s: and go in this order to make sure
725.60s: everything that you're doing is aligned
728.16s: next we need to identify the tickers the
730.16s: kinds of tickers that they are one of
731.80s: the great things you can use when you're
733.36s: analyzing different tickers is you could
736.08s: take a peek at the beta the beta tells
739.04s: you how does it move in relation to the
741.76s: market and in general we use the S&P 500
744.16s: to represent the market so spy will be
746.64s: one if I take a look at QQQ you'll
748.60s: notice that the beta is 1.3 that tells
750.68s: me that the NASDAQ is more volatile than
753.28s: the S&P 500 that means if the S&P 500
755.72s: goes up by a dollar we might expect the
757.72s: cues to move by a130 up or down both in
761.40s: favorable Direction and non-favorable
763.24s: Direction so we need to identify the
765.40s: tickers that fit in with the broader
767.04s: portfolio and then I like to spread
769.44s: across some different time frames so
771.36s: let's take a look at this we already
773.40s: gave the example of wanting 10% per year
776.44s: let's say that we're bullish right now
778.52s: we're risk open we're ready to use up to
780.80s: 100% of the portfolio so we're figuring
782.80s: out what we want to put on so we're
784.44s: going to use a $100,000 portfolio we're
786.64s: going to say that we're going to use
788.04s: $60,000 in the core allocation
790.28s: allocating 60% of it long beta that's to
792.88s: track the broader market and then we
794.12s: have about $40,000 we can use at no more
796.80s: than 2% risk per trade for other things
799.92s: so now we start putting the actual
802.20s: strategies on of this $60,000 that's
805.00s: going to be allocated to the coverage
806.72s: strangle maybe I start with $4 $5,000
809.96s: leaving 15K to scale then I might look
812.72s: at adding some other strategies into the
815.36s: mix here that allow me to tweak the
818.12s: overall portfolio risk something like
820.80s: volatility risk premium trades which I
823.80s: have a video for that a link below are
826.24s: really great because it's kind of
827.48s: non-correlated returns they're just
829.12s: going to do whatever they're going to do
830.24s: by themselves which is beneficial
832.32s: because it's not going to have a direct
834.04s: relationship with the rest of the
835.32s: portfolio and then maybe we have things
837.52s: that are more directly correlated we're
839.40s: trading like a momentum breakout style
841.64s: strategy again limiting risk to no more
844.00s: than 2% for this case no more than 1%
846.48s: for the risk premium approaches and for
848.44s: the momentum approaches we might have 3
850.72s: to 10 trades on at a given point in time
853.88s: with at least 20% of them providing
856.88s: short beta weighted Deltas to your core
859.28s: Holdings this starts to offset things
861.64s: now the 20% short is going to be
863.44s: completely variable based on this thing
866.64s: up at the top which is your current
869.80s: disposition towards the market if you
871.36s: don't think the Market's going to go
872.72s: down you think the Market's good where
874.00s: it is then maybe you don't have any
875.24s: short because you're not you don't think
876.64s: the Market's going down but if you start
878.12s: to see the market rolling over you start
879.88s: to see short-term moving averages um
882.40s: faltering on a bunch of different
884.52s: sectors we're seeing all the sectors
886.52s: running negative trending down maybe we
888.88s: start jacking up the number of short
890.80s: Holdings we have on this part of it
892.32s: maybe we start sizing this down in order
895.08s: to manage our risk it's all entirely up
898.16s: to you but you have to Define it so I
900.56s: want to show you a cool tool in here
903.20s: which is thinker swim we could take a
904.84s: look at this is the risk profile but
907.68s: what you can do actually down here is
909.64s: you can move this to your entire
911.36s: portfolio so what I have is a bunch of
913.64s: random trades in here just for an
915.20s: example and what I'm showing you is I
917.44s: can put my entire portfolio against
920.08s: something like spy and I can say based
922.76s: on this hypothetical portfolio where I'm
925.08s: trading Q's Sofi and mstr I can figure
928.32s: out if the S&P 500 drops 10% and goes
931.80s: down to 550 I would be down 18K am I
936.24s: okay with that does that feel reasonable
939.48s: and maybe it does maybe it doesn't so if
942.72s: it does cool if it doesn't then maybe I
945.80s: say well I'm going to scale down my Q's
947.60s: position and then if it actually does
949.28s: move down a full 10% not a little bit
951.72s: shy but we're actually full 10% closer
953.92s: to 540 and we're at 16k at that 10% move
957.52s: we're like okay yeah that's fine based
959.32s: on my portfolio size I'm comfortable
961.20s: with that risk I want a little more beta
963.00s: than the S&P 500 for a better end ofe
965.40s: return so I'm okay with this so you can
966.96s: use this tool to assess your overall
969.48s: portfolio Okay lightning rounds some
972.52s: common questions the first one is I like
975.52s: to sell premium do I have to buy no you
977.44s: can do whatever you want the cool part
978.80s: about selling premium is you can sell
980.44s: premium in counter opposing positions so
983.76s: you can have short puts that are bullish
985.60s: you can have short calls that are
986.68s: bearish next one should we diverse I ify
989.32s: across strategies and time frames
991.28s: absolutely I think we covered that here

995.00s: different time frames and strategies
996.36s: will behave differently over their life
998.24s: cycle which is what you're supposed to
999.68s: pay attention to here so absolutely how
1001.96s: do I know if I'm Diversified effectively
1004.36s: great question the first thing we can
1006.00s: use is beta weighted Deltas to make sure
1008.36s: that the total portfolio makes sense
1010.60s: based on our risk the second is you can
1013.00s: model the total risk of your entire
1015.08s: portfolio like I was just showing you
1016.60s: here you can build this for yourself
1018.04s: thinker swim does it for you which is
1019.48s: convenient but if you have a good trade
1021.16s: log which most of you should you can
1022.76s: literally build your own graph for this
1024.52s: and it can give you this idea so that
1026.48s: you can then say based on what I just
1028.56s: showed you is this current portfolio
1030.96s: setup able to get me to my monthly
1033.08s: return Target yes good if I get a down

1041.48s: down move am I okay can I consume that
1043.60s: risk yes okay great then you're good if
