0.68s: I got a DM asking what happened to the
3.24s: implied volatility today in GameStop
5.80s: after the shareholder meeting and you
7.60s: know if it's about some options I'm here
9.48s: for it so it's exactly what we're going
11.16s: to talk about today because
12.16s: interestingly enough that volatility
14.36s: didn't bleed out as much as I expected
16.20s: which makes me believe there might be
17.88s: something else that the market is
19.04s: looking at which we'll take a look at
21.28s: while I was at it a couple other updates
22.72s: that I saw wearing kiddy dropping his
25.00s: standard cryptic messages with no
27.32s: captions at all you guys are really
29.20s: really good at interpreting what these
31.16s: mean I am not I don't know all the
33.12s: details yet I did look up both of these
35.36s: quickly and this dude was complaining
37.12s: about the reing at some tennis matches
39.88s: and then this guy apparently is from a
41.36s: Disney movie that he can see the future
43.00s: and people are really reading into this
44.80s: green reflection although he looks super
47.60s: sad to me so I don't know what to make
49.24s: of either of those you guys will have to
50.48s: tell me but let's talk about this real
53.40s: quick too this is from Ryan Cohen after
55.44s: the shareholders meeting and it seemed
58.16s: interesting cuz on Twitter it seemed
59.76s: like a lot of people were expecting this
61.48s: big rallying cry from Cohen and to me at
65.32s: least this is a very standard
67.16s: shareholders meeting update where
69.92s: they're just talking about broad brush
71.44s: Strokes they're not getting super far
73.04s: into detail this is kind of standard
74.80s: Fair it seems like you guys were
76.44s: expecting something else at least to
77.76s: some
78.48s: degree again I don't know the history I
80.72s: don't know if he promised a specific
82.64s: road map with specific action items and
84.52s: things like that if so that would be a
86.04s: big Miss but I didn't see anything like
88.16s: that this looks like standard fair I
89.76s: just just bring that up for context
91.76s: because I don't like seeing newer
93.68s: Traders kind of getting their
94.96s: expectations super accelerated compared
97.68s: to where we may or may not be and then
99.76s: disappointed on the back end it just
101.16s: doesn't really help anything at least
102.72s: from the Traders perspective which is
104.36s: what I care about the most I care about
106.44s: you guys and your ability to trade
108.44s: effectively all right let's get into now
110.84s: actually what I do know about which is
113.92s: this some options so if we take a look
116.64s: at GameStop this is today the 17th of
118.96s: June this was yesterday the 16th of June
121.04s: over the weekend and there was a big
124.24s: drop in implied volatility yesterday it
126.48s: was hovering 280 cracked over 280 for a
128.92s: little bit and then today after the
131.36s: meeting after the close this is now down
133.00s: at 204% so 76 points it's a big drop
136.64s: especially over the course of a day not
139.84s: as big as I thought in terms of the
143.16s: anticipation around this event the fact
145.76s: that this is still over 200% with now 4
148.88s: days left to go
150.60s: is actually quite interesting to me so
153.60s: if we take a look at the market right
156.72s: now it's
158.28s: 20451 and right now I would have
162.24s: expected this to be down quite a bit
163.88s: more I also noticed that the expiration
166.32s: for next cycle 28th of June is also
168.80s: still pretty elevated
170.48s: 180% compared to everything else which
172.72s: is in the 160s
174.80s: 150s that's a big difference so to a
177.96s: degree the market is still pricing in a
180.44s: larger price band now another question I
182.56s: got from somebody is is high Vault good
185.68s: or bad it's not inherently either the
188.96s: reason for that is this is agnostic this
191.40s: isn't saying it's going to go up a lot
193.00s: or down a lot it's saying it could do
195.48s: either and we don't really know so this
198.40s: is kind of projecting a cone of price
201.00s: movement so that's why this says plus or
203.52s: minus and actually this number doesn't
205.04s: look correct to me I think it's slightly
206.44s: higher than that now but the uh
208.76s: specifically the $4
210.56s: 36 I think it's higher than that we can
213.32s: do the math on it in a second but this
216.44s: essentially means that the market is
217.80s: expecting a fairly large move in a
220.32s: relatively short period for a Rel
222.80s: relatively cheap product right it's 25
224.56s: bucks so to see these kinds of moves
226.68s: over the course of 4 days that's still
228.68s: pretty significant volatility now from a
231.28s: chart perspective which I think in this
233.00s: case doesn't really apply that much to
234.60s: GameStop really because of the way that
236.52s: it operates but it does look like it's
239.24s: kind of in this 242 handle pretty well
242.24s: that's the main thing I see at least
244.04s: from a support perspective but again I
247.08s: really would be very hesitant to apply
249.36s: my typical technical analysis approach
251.28s: to something like GameStop it clearly
252.92s: Breaks the Rules all the time it's a
254.96s: completely different product that's what
256.56s: makes it kind of the special thing that
258.48s: it is a couple of the things that though
260.68s: that I want to show you in the options
262.96s: chain the first thing if you remember
265.12s: yesterday when we were looking at this
267.04s: exact thing down at the bottom I'll
268.56s: slide out of the way so you can see this
271.04s: has changed massively so yesterday we
275.32s: saw the put side of this front
277.76s: expiration the IV severely depressed
281.44s: that typically leads to a upward price
284.24s: sensitivity meaning we're pricing in
285.92s: more vs to the upside this is now turned
288.88s: into almost a standard volatility smile
292.00s: slight call skew still in terms of the
294.56s: vs but not massive this is way more
297.68s: normal so if you compare this to the
299.40s: video I did yesterday you'll see a huge
301.48s: difference between these and this is
303.60s: exactly how V adjusts based on current
306.08s: market conditions now if you look at the
308.92s: following expiration 28 June we see
312.64s: something different again we see that
316.00s: same kind of call skew that we saw
319.12s: yesterday so this is again the market
323.00s: very clearly pricing in more vaults to
325.44s: the upside pricing in more upside rate
328.12s: so you can't take away too much from
330.28s: that right out of the jump but that just
332.00s: tells me how they're pricing options via
334.36s: the
335.04s: volatility now if we take a look at the
338.36s: overall volumes for today very
340.64s: interesting day and it's because if you
342.76s: look at the calls versus puts a lot of
344.68s: calls traded compared to the puts that
346.64s: typically means oh wow people are
348.92s: expecting upside that's what you would
350.84s: assume if they're buying calls I don't
354.40s: actually think that's the most of what's
356.24s: going on here and I'll tell you why if
358.68s: you take a look at be traded at the bid
361.36s: or below traded at the ask or above if
364.64s: you're buying things and you're trying
367.04s: to get your trade on it's going to be at
369.16s: or above the offer the ask this is if
371.88s: you're buying options in this
373.76s: scenario and if you're selling options
376.32s: and you're trying to get your sold
377.84s: options out there and on it would be at
380.32s: the bid or below so what I see here and
384.12s: then just to kind of finish this part
386.40s: out between the market is if you're
388.04s: playing the midpoint and in this case
389.72s: you can't tell if you're trying to open
391.36s: a contract close a contract sell to open
393.92s: buy to open you can't tell anything in
395.72s: here so this for kind of this purpose
398.28s: you typically would just get rid of this
399.88s: line because you can't tell anything
401.64s: from it
402.64s: essentially now what I can see is from
405.80s: the calls that traded today 36% of them
408.76s: were done at the bid or below that tells
410.88s: me those are likely sales meaning people
413.16s: selling calls meaning we are expecting
415.56s: the market to go down or want the market
417.40s: to go down this can be done against
419.60s: covered call scenario where you have the
421.68s: shares and sell calls against your
424.00s: shares that is one of my guesses on what
426.96s: could be going on here now the other
429.44s: thing I see is on the put side it's the
432.28s: inverse so if you're buying puts you
435.60s: would want the market to go down and if
437.36s: you're buying them and you want to get
438.52s: your puts on it would be at the offer
441.04s: the ask or above 39% of them took place
445.60s: there as compared to 26% at the bid so
448.76s: this tells me there's a smaller subset
450.48s: of people who are selling puts which is
452.32s: bullish and more people that are buying
454.48s: puts which is bearish wanting something
456.16s: to go down again this could be buying
458.84s: protective puts against long shares you
460.40s: don't know but what I do know is from a
462.56s: pure speculative standpoint there's more
465.84s: downside transactions occurring between
468.00s: the calls and the puts here now the last
470.04s: thing I want to look at real quick is
471.88s: the expiration this week and next week
474.64s: because there's massive volume so again
478.68s: quick recap open interest are contracts
481.16s: that are open and
482.92s: outstanding and volume are just the
485.64s: number of trades on that contract today
489.16s: we can't tell if these are opening
490.36s: trades or closing trades but we can make
492.36s: some inferences so for example on these
494.84s: 26 calls there is 5400 oi
499.44s: 20,000 volume today even if we close all
504.12s: of these oi out that still means 15,000
507.36s: of these were Buys so there's a a lot of
509.92s: people buying out of the money calls
512.28s: that essentially expire in a few days
514.20s: same thing at this 30 handle there's no
517.88s: doubt buying volume here because again
520.04s: if you sell all of these against the
521.96s: existing oi which is 67,000 there's
524.28s: still a net positive figure here that
526.12s: means that there's still additional buys
528.80s: happening and again it looks like it's
530.36s: more than that so the market still is
532.88s: looking at some upside here it's hard to
535.04s: tell exactly to what degree though we
536.76s: really don't know now the other thing
538.76s: that you can read in between the lines
540.48s: ever so slightly is if you look at the
543.12s: closing price
545.28s: 2522 and if you look at kind of the
547.72s: first out ofthe money put which is 25
550.44s: and then the first out ofth money call
552.08s: which is 2550 which one of those is
555.00s: closer are we closer to 25 or 255 we're
558.84s: technically closer to 25 yet it has a
563.08s: lower Delta that's informative that
566.40s: means that the market is at the very
568.20s: least pricing in a slight favorable up
570.80s: move to the 255s which is again slightly
574.32s: further away than these puts and that to
577.80s: me is slight buying pressure at least in
579.88s: terms of the way that these are being
581.84s: priced options are fascinating there's
584.48s: all these little things you can take a
585.80s: look at to kind of make inferences but
588.12s: it's really important you can't look at
589.64s: any one of them and think okay this is
591.84s: what's going to happen the vast majority
593.16s: of the time you kind of have to piece it
594.48s: all together and see what you see and in
596.96s: this case it's a really mixed back looks
599.60s: like the vast majority of options volume
601.56s: that we're seeing today is cell pressure
605.04s: it looks like from an implied volatility
606.96s: perspective we're approximating to more
609.20s: of a smile for the close expiration
611.68s: meaning this very front expiration and
613.52s: then the very next expiration which is
615.52s: next Friday it has that more kind of
618.24s: call skew Focus that we've seen
619.92s: previously for this expiration now let's
623.04s: take a look at the 208 June super fast
624.84s: see if anything sticks
626.72s: out and it still looks like some pretty
629.44s: big call oi this is across a lot of
633.28s: these
635.28s: different Deltas which is interesting
638.28s: because if we look at the overall call
639.68s: transactions on this side compared to
641.56s: this side it's still pretty massive so
644.28s: one of the other things we can do real
645.68s: quick out of curiosity is we can take a
647.40s: look at the volume for today we can look
649.60s: at this kind of near-term series let's
651.36s: take a look at calls and puts and so
655.04s: this is just looking at the front
657.00s: two expirations and and the a lot of
660.92s: this volume for both of them actually
662.76s: the majority of the volume that we're
664.64s: seeing across all contracts were in
667.00s: these front
668.24s: two which again is interesting to me and
672.00s: there is a lot of volume here at the 30s
674.96s: which I think we
677.88s: saw which was this block here so not
682.36s: dead meaning there's still a lot of
684.56s: people playing in these really
685.64s: short-term expirations which is very
687.44s: interesting to me if you're interested
689.44s: did from a retail trading perspective
691.00s: why that can be really really dangerous
692.92s: check out the last video I did I'll
694.56s: throw it in the notes below because I
696.72s: think that's super important for new
698.04s: traders to be aware of that buying far
700.20s: out of the money options seems really
702.12s: attractive but it's not as attractive as
704.68s: you might think it is and you should
707.00s: just be aware whether you still want to
709.12s: trade them or not that's obviously
710.56s: totally up to you you seemingly are
712.40s: grown people as you should be slaying in
714.64s: trades however you feel like it but it
716.08s: should be at least informed we should
717.48s: know the trade-offs so that's the goal
718.76s: of that video
719.92s: as always anything you want me to take a
721.40s: look at just send it to me I love
722.92s: looking over this stuff as you can tell
724.92s: I'll see you guys later
