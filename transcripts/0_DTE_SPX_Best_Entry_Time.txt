0.32s: what is the best time to enter a zero
3.08s: DTE trade in SPX well we're going to get
6.32s: to the bottom of that and we're going to
8.40s: answer a couple questions along the way
10.04s: that people commonly get wrong so buckle
13.36s: up we're going to look through over
15.28s: 25,000 trades from 2022 and we are going
19.84s: to get to the bottom of this question
21.96s: let's get straight in so first thing is
25.92s: first contrary to popular belief like
28.40s: this person says down here you never put
30.80s: on an iron Condor or premium selling
33.32s: strategy with zero DTE 1 hour before the
36.20s: close they're referencing a previous
37.68s: video that I did where I was entering
39.28s: the last hour before the close and if
41.44s: you guys know anything about me there's
42.96s: probably a reason why I was doing that
44.76s: which will learn more about this person
47.32s: up here commented on that same video and
49.52s: they were saying commonly people open a
51.56s: trade a bit after market open did you
54.28s: discover something that made you decide
55.92s: otherwise and I want you to keep that in
57.96s: mind as we move through this now couple
60.84s: notes on methodology this is nothing
63.28s: super complex I track zero DTE data
67.12s: because I trade it myself but for
69.36s: something like this where we're going to
71.00s: look through a bunch of different
72.80s: permutations of strategies I already
75.96s: have a data set that I've purchased from
78.12s: sibo intraday with full Greeks and I run
82.00s: it through Python and then I share those
84.00s: results with you all here so let's take
87.20s: a look at what this looks like so we'll
90.60s: get rid of those two and what I want to
92.64s: start us with is kind of an overview and
95.72s: there's a reason why I want to start
96.84s: with this overview it's specifically
99.00s: because it will help you identify some
101.76s: trends that I want you to see from the
104.08s: beginning and then we're going to move
105.68s: into each individual year now why did I
108.96s: pick 2022 pretty simple that's when the
112.20s: zero DTE expirations kind of expanded
116.00s: and it wasn't just a Friday expiration
117.72s: but we started having midweek expiration
120.44s: and then after 2022 is when we actually
123.08s: fully launched daily expirations so this
126.84s: gives us kind of a the purest sense that
129.76s: we can I have larger data sets that
131.56s: we've looked at previously but this is
133.16s: looking more closely at zero DTE
135.24s: specifically now the other thing to keep
137.36s: in mind is 2022 and 2023 were important
141.16s: years 2022 was a down year in SPX just
145.32s: shy of 20% and then 2023 was a positive
149.12s: year in S&P 500 just over 23% so you get
153.40s: to see how this works in two very
156.04s: different market conditions now run
158.28s: through column a very quickly so you
160.48s: know what we're looking at we have the
162.64s: short call Long call short put long put
166.84s: Deltas so as you can see right here
169.44s: we're looking at strangles the lot size
172.44s: for all of these will be a one lot I'm
174.20s: starting the entry times at two
176.16s: different periods 0935 eastern time and
179.20s: then 15 100 eastern time you'll see when
182.12s: we go through the rest of the data that
183.48s: I actually have by every single hour I'm
185.92s: just giving you some brackets to start
187.64s: with there's no profit or Loss
190.56s: Management applied to any of these which
192.84s: is something we can look at in the
194.16s: future if you're interested and then we
196.36s: have the profit and loss for the
198.36s: strategy the compound annual growth rate
200.60s: the Max draw down the average return per
204.24s: trade average win average loss Max win
207.40s: Max loss the number of Trades the number
210.08s: of winning trades and then win rate loss
212.56s: rate and expected return you'll see that
214.96s: the expected return is the same thing up
216.52s: here as the average per trade it just
218.60s: gives you um a little more data behind
220.56s: it okay so a common complaint that I got
223.52s: from my last video is that I didn't
225.88s: include iron Condors which you might
228.08s: expect there's a reason why but to
230.00s: satiate those people let's take a look
233.24s: at those okay so first things first we
235.68s: noticed that 0935 for the single option
238.92s: variations perform worse than the later
242.20s: entries then we also notice that if you
245.56s: add five Delta Wings to all of these
248.76s: they're all losing positions so it takes
251.44s: something that previously was profitable
253.48s: and it makes it not profitable now if we
256.20s: look at the best performing iron Condor
260.24s: which was short the 30 Deltas long the
263.40s: five entered at 1500 Pacific time the
267.32s: best performer was it returned
270.56s: 18,6 26 not bad now what I want to
273.80s: highlight about that though is if you
275.28s: look at the worst performing single
277.96s: option variant the 10 Delta entered at
280.40s: the same time that returned
282.36s: 20,5 22 the other thing I want you to
285.32s: notice is take a look at the max loss
287.28s: the max loss in this 10 Delta was 4600
289.52s: bucks the max loss for this 30 Delta
291.44s: with the five Wings was 3880 so it's
294.04s: less than a thousand difference between
296.68s: the max loss but if you look at the
298.44s: average loss there very similar the
300.92s: average loss on this 10 Delta short 791
303.96s: and for the 30 Delta long the fives $799
307.76s: not a big difference here it's important
309.64s: to know and obviously it's because some
311.44s: people will say we should use really
312.92s: wide wings to define the risk or to
314.88s: manage margin and that's what you're
316.52s: seeing here so this is again from 2022
320.32s: to 2024 March 25th that's just where I
323.20s: grabbed the data from now we can take a
325.88s: look at each hour across that same time
329.80s: frame so 22 to 24 we have a 10:00 a.m.
333.40s: 11 12 1 2 3 all Eastern Time entries I
338.04s: want you to notice something notice how
340.20s: the entries closer to the close tend to
342.84s: perform better even those that are
345.00s: slightly Negative they tend to perform
348.24s: at least better on the further outof the
351.84s: money strikes so the 10 Delta they
354.76s: perform better later in the day now
356.76s: there's a bit of a an uptick here in
359.12s: this 12 Eastern Time bracket where you
361.56s: can see this actually does well it
363.32s: doesn't quite perform as well as the
366.00s: 1400 and 1500 entries on average but
369.12s: it's still noteworthy and what we'll do
371.40s: next is look Year bye but a couple
374.64s: things to note again this is with no
376.68s: management applied that actually changes
378.64s: things quite a bit however when you look
380.76s: at stuff like this and let me get myself
383.08s: out of the way for you when you look at
384.88s: stuff like this it's really important to
387.04s: note a few things what we see in this
389.24s: back test is what we call in Sample this
392.40s: is when we look at a specified sample
394.72s: and we know what happens so we can you
397.28s: know see what's optimal for that but you
399.88s: run the risk of overfitting overfitting
402.80s: is where our future results we know will
405.88s: be different and if we make our approach
409.92s: fit historic data perfectly it runs the
413.44s: risk of not adjusting well to what
416.24s: things look like in the future which is
417.60s: unknown to us so to avoid overfitting
421.04s: what we want to do is look for trends
423.24s: that generally hold true across periods
427.72s: across deltas and make some informed
430.60s: decisions about what the future might
432.12s: look like based on that you can run
433.52s: forward projections as well to help with
435.32s: that I didn't do that in this video for
436.84s: the sake of time so a couple things I
439.08s: notied and this is nothing revolutionary
442.12s: if you use lower Deltas you're going to
444.80s: have a lower Max loss as compared to the
448.64s: higher deltas on average but you're also
450.92s: going to have a lower average win per
453.96s: trade slightly so that's the trade-off
456.32s: you're going to see a higher win rate
458.44s: notice for these 10 Deltas you're
459.80s: winning 87% of the time as compared to
462.52s: 66 on the 30 Deltas but let's take a
465.08s: look then at how this looks year
467.40s: over-year cuz you'll notice across both
471.56s: a bare Market which is up here in 2022
474.84s: and then a bull market which is here in
476.76s: 2023 it actually doesn't change that
479.12s: much we see the same thing here where
482.44s: the early entries tend to not perform
485.24s: well why is that a bunch of different
487.56s: reasons but a lot of it comes down to
489.92s: the first hour of the market is very
492.12s: volatile there are a lot of orders
494.32s: resting from the night before that are
496.00s: getting pushed through from Pension
498.00s: funds that need to clear out their
499.48s: trades and so on and so forth they're
501.52s: not really caring about getting optimal
503.48s: fills so they're just blasting stuff
505.00s: through this is where everything is
506.60s: digested quickly so the first half hour
509.12s: to of a market tends to be pretty
512.57s: [Applause]
514.28s: busy the other thing is because there
517.16s: are now daily expirations you'll notice
519.80s: that the rate of Decay is actually a
523.08s: little bit slower in the beginning of
524.92s: the day relative to the end of the day
526.36s: and it's the same thing that you'll see
527.60s: with options in general where it gets as
529.84s: parabolic as you can into expiration but
532.72s: that's just happening on a shortened
534.40s: zero DTE time frame so when you're
536.36s: entering these things first thing right
538.36s: on the open you're going to see more
540.40s: money you're going to see a higher
542.12s: premium received but a lot of that's not
545.04s: actually going to Decay out for again
548.12s: relative to a zero DTE time frame until
550.20s: later in the day so you're really
551.96s: holding things exposing yourself to a
553.96s: lot of directional risk unless you're
556.56s: Delta hedging and Gamma hedging these
558.48s: positions which SPX is very difficult to
561.72s: do in any sort of peer sense so that's
564.84s: why you see this this is also why in
567.40s: general entering as you get nearer to
569.84s: the close tends to work better now I
571.76s: want you to notice something in
572.88s: particular though look at the average
575.96s: p&l for 20122 compared to 2023 in 2022
580.52s: the average p&l is better for a 1,400
583.76s: eastern time entry for 2023 that
586.60s: actually shifts across the board for all
589.04s: of them whether it's a 10 15 20 or 30
591.44s: Delta strangle it all shifts out to the
593.68s: right to the 1500 2022 bare Market 2023
598.28s: bull market is there a direct conclusion
601.36s: to be led by this not so much not just
604.00s: yet but it's something to be aware of
606.32s: now the other thing that I noticed that
608.80s: was interesting to me is in a bare
611.12s: Market the, 1500 entry noticed the loss
615.12s: of size of these losses 4600 bucks 53
618.64s: that's about you would expect fairly
620.52s: high if you look at that compared to a
622.76s: bull market in 2023 notice how low these
626.36s: are really small losses for the max loss
629.68s: relative to here but if we look at that
632.00s: you would think yeah that makes sense
633.24s: bare Market I would expect this to have
635.44s: bigger losses more volatility but take a
637.80s: look at the 1400 entry the losses
640.84s: actually get bigger in 2023 during a
644.96s: bull market not something I necessarily
647.68s: would expect but notice that the win
649.64s: rates here for the 10 Delta are slightly
652.08s: better and for the 30 Delta slightly
654.64s: better so what I'm highlighting here
656.40s: these are like little things you can
657.68s: hone in on but if I were to think about
660.64s: this in it just a general broad context
664.32s: here's what I'm thinking about later in
666.04s: the day works better using single
668.52s: options via a strangle works better this
671.44s: I used to include straddles in this but
674.32s: I haven't for some time because they're
675.84s: underperforming and they underperform
677.60s: here as well that has been a trend I
679.64s: noticed as of General last couple years
683.04s: and that's something else to be aware of
684.88s: with the integration of this I'm still
686.36s: continuing to test those but that's what
688.00s: I'm seeing so far now what you'll see if
691.12s: we do a future video if you let me know
693.16s: in the comments that you'd like me to do
694.64s: that we can take a look at how to think
696.96s: about managing the profit and the loss
699.56s: side and then what subsequent impacts
702.40s: that has on the performance so if we
705.28s: should do that let me know don't forget
707.20s: to like the video be an outlier see you
709.24s: guys later
