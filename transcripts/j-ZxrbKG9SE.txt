0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here.
2.00s: One, do a small stacks update.
4.00s: I made a couple trades in the current diagonals that I have on.
8.00s: And then I am analyzing another potential called diagonal.
12.00s: Somebody was mentioning that they were, you know, essentially hoping that I could share real time, like when I'm analyzing a trade.
19.00s: So that's what I'm doing in the trade.
21.00s: I'm going to go through with you guys today. Walk through some of it.
24.00s: I didn't put it on yet. I'm going to watch it.
26.00s: But I intend to put it on when I see that the conditions are right.
29.00s: And then I have some hot air balloons that are going up right now.
33.00s: So I'll show you that real quick.
35.00s: Well, that was a big bummer.
37.00s: The camera wouldn't focus. So I'm sorry.
39.00s: You don't get to see the hot air balloons.
41.00s: But trust me, they're dope.
43.00s: So let's go over to the main screen real quick.
45.00s: This is small stacks part 12.
47.00s: So I didn't write it in because I'm lazy.
50.00s: And I just copy and paste it everything.
52.00s: So this is what we're looking at in the portfolio right now.
56.00s: Utilization is 2263.
59.00s: So we're still under 40% utilized.
62.00s: Total PNL is now at 757.
65.00s: So that represents just over 13% return since kicking this off on one September.
71.00s: Credit outstanding right now is 182,
74.00s: which represents a 3.16% return on the portfolio.
78.00s: Everything's looking healthy.
79.00s: We're not super utilized right now.
81.00s: So we still have room to add positions on,
83.00s: which is exactly what I want to talk about.
85.00s: Okay, so next up is some of the adjustments that I made.
92.00s: First off in Ford.
95.00s: The 9 October, obviously put that trade on today.
100.00s: But I sold one more of the seven calls,
105.00s: expiring 30 October, which is right after their earnings.
108.00s: And I collected 58 cents on that.
111.00s: The reason why I did that is I have three long call options right now.
116.00s: And now I have three short calls against it.
121.00s: And the reason why I did that is when I looked at the risk profile,
125.00s: I generally like to keep the leap uncovered,
129.00s: which I did for a while.
131.00s: But now that I see Ford kind of making a move up,
134.00s: I perceive more room to the downside at this point.
139.00s: So by adding that final short call to essentially,
144.00s: to essentially collect that premium upfront,
147.00s: if Ford stays essentially where it's at,
150.00s: or if it goes up about 20 more cents,
153.00s: I will make more money with the three short calls as compared to the just two short calls.
160.00s: Now where that will start to change is if it goes up over 20 cents additional
165.00s: from where it's at right now,
168.00s: is when I would have made more money with the two short calls as compared to the three.
173.00s: So right now based on my assumption,
175.00s: expecting a little more downside movement,
178.00s: especially with earnings coming up.
180.00s: That's why I put that additional call on,
183.00s: collect that money upfront,
185.00s: because I think that there's a higher propensity for it to stay where it's at,
188.00s: or maybe even go down a little bit as compared to increased greater than 20 cents.
192.00s: So we'll see what happens,
194.00s: but that is just why I made that adjustment.
197.00s: The other adjustment I made was really easy.
199.00s: It was actually the day after I did the last update,
202.00s: and I think the last time we did was six October.
205.00s: So on the seventh of October,
207.00s: in Croger, I sold the six NOVE 35 short call.
218.00s: So that took this to a one-to-one ratio as well.
221.00s: Except it was a really, really simple trade.
227.00s: I ended up taking it down very, very shortly thereafter.
231.00s: Sorry, I just realized I'm a spoke,
234.00s: because I'm changing the dates down there for when I took it off.
236.00s: So this was on last time we spoke that second call,
239.00s: and this was taken down on the seventh of October,
242.00s: which is the day after the last video.
245.00s: And I took these down for $0.58.
248.00s: So that realized $75 PNL,
253.00s: which is a 5.53% return on Vesit Capital.
256.00s: Essentially, that was an easy decision for me,
259.00s: because I was getting very, very,
262.00s: I was already over 50% Max Profit pretty early into the trade.
266.00s: And most importantly, by doing this,
269.00s: I uncovered the Max potential gain on Croger again.
274.00s: So I will continue to do this same exact system,
277.00s: where I'll either allow it to move up until I proceed more
281.00s: downside risk, then add that short call to collect more money.
285.00s: Sometimes I move the strike a little further out.
287.00s: It kind of just depends on the scenario.
289.00s: But as of right now,
291.00s: I left it with just the 6 NOVE 355 call,
295.00s: so it's uncovered.
297.00s: And that's because that trade is still not...
302.00s: It's about at par, as you can tell,
305.00s: from the other trade that I took down.
308.00s: Okay. So now, kind of the more important part,
312.00s: I want to talk to you about Intel.
316.00s: So I am eyeing a call diagonal in here.
320.00s: I really want some tech exposure,
323.00s: which in the small stacks right now,
325.00s: I have very little.
327.00s: And by very little,
329.00s: it's essentially only if I play smaller products like Zingga.
331.00s: So right now, what I'm eager to do is keep an eye on Intel.
337.00s: I like them at large.
339.00s: I've liked them for a long time.
341.00s: I've been trading them in my margin portfolio very frequently.
344.00s: And as of right now,
346.00s: it's a little bit of a too far run up for me.
348.00s: It's not a good entry just yet.
350.00s: I want to see a little bit more of a pullback.
353.00s: But seeing it already starting across above the 50 day,
356.00s: approaching the 200 moving day average,
358.00s: I'm like, those are very bullish symbols to me.
361.00s: So I'm actually hoping for a little bit of a pullback
364.00s: closer to the 48 handle so that I can look at an entry.
367.00s: What I was eyeing as of right now was taking a look at the 18 June 2140s.
374.00s: And this would only be a one lot.
377.00s: I wouldn't want to offer more than one in this position,
382.00s: just to avoid over sizing the account.
385.00s: And that would tie up around $1,400.
390.00s: Essentially, you can call it $1,400.
392.00s: So that would be a little oversized compared to a couple of the others.
398.00s: It would put it about on par with Kruger.
400.00s: And then Ford would be the smallest of the pack.
403.00s: But in general, I would be okay with that with that risk profile.
408.00s: So we're going to see how it reacts,
410.00s: especially as it moves closer to earnings.
414.00s: If I see an opportunity to get into these, like I said,
417.00s: when Intel looks like it's a little closer to the 48 handle,
420.00s: I would be interested.
421.00s: But until that point, I will probably stay hands off
425.00s: because with these small stacks portfolio,
428.00s: it's very intolerant of periodic moves where I would have to sit and wait.
434.00s: And in comparison, in my margin account,
437.00s: if I wanted to put a trade on this because I liked it,
439.00s: I would just put on a partial position right now,
441.00s: maybe a third of the overall position,
443.00s: and then continue to add into it as it goes,
446.00s: because that allows me to capture upside if it occurs,
449.00s: but then add and scale into the position as it goes down.
453.00s: Obviously, in the small stacks portfolio,
455.00s: that strategy doesn't work,
457.00s: which is the reason why we have this segment
460.00s: to look at a different way of trading a portfolio.
462.00s: So overall, that wraps up where we're at on the small stacks portfolio,
468.00s: still cruising right along, happy,
471.00s: primarily happy, honestly, with the utilization.
474.00s: I'm really, really stoked that we're returning very well
478.00s: without redlining the account, which is important to me.
482.00s: So I'm going to continue eyeing other opportunities.
485.00s: Financials is also on the docket,
488.00s: something like a Bank of America.
490.00s: I've traded them a lot.
491.00s: It's a cheaper product for financials.
494.00s: That's another tool that I'll keep an eye on.
498.00s: But right now, I just don't feel super warm and fuzzy about banks
502.00s: with interest rates being held where they're at,
504.00s: which is why I'm not prioritizing financials over tech.
507.00s: Right now, I think tech is definitely looking better,
511.00s: as you could tell us the same reason why I picked Kroger.
514.00s: I think things like that in the middle of the pandemic
519.00s: would perform well.
521.00s: And then the other thing, obviously, is Ford,
524.00s: that's a longer term, kind of COVID play,
527.00s: because I do think that it's still a strong company.
529.00s: It's had a significant pullback.
531.00s: So we'll see, also where that winds up.
535.00s: But so far, Ford's also looking good for me.
538.00s: In the meantime, I will always cover whatever you guys want me to.
542.00s: Anything that you want me to talk about, let me know.
544.00s: And we'll catch everybody later.
