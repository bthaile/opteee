 I'm going to show you what gamma scalping is, what the major components are, and then walk you through an example so that you can see how this thing works from beginning to end. What's up everybody? Eric here, and I'm stoked to talk a little bit about gamma scalping because I actually think there's better opportunity now than there has been in the past few years. So let's jump over and get right into what this is. What is gamma scalping? It's essentially Delta adjustments around a base trade. So the way to think about it is you can scalp without having any sort of base position. And what I mean by that is you could try to benefit from the interim price movements of whatever it is that you're trading. Now the difference between that and gamma scalping is we typically have some sort of base trade on and we're adjusting the Delta's on that trade. So when we're looking at these, there's kind of two main categories. There's long premium trades and then short premium trades. Now for gamma scalping more often than not, this is typically an institutional practice. So there's a lot of differences between what an institution will do with this and what retail seeks to do with it. A lot of that has to do with transaction costs and things of that nature. But that being said, the normal way retail traders will gamma scalp is typically having some sort of long base volatility trade. Their very common move is long straddles. So buying and at the money call and put, which we'll talk about, but that's a very common base trade to gamma scalp around. And the idea here is the main enemy of any sort of long premium trade is time. We need whatever it is that we're buying to move so that we can make money. Now there is another use for this for short premium traders. And this is a way to minimize some of the directional risk. However, you're going to see this a lot less frequently with short premium traders. And it's primarily because we want time to pass. And that benefits our position. Whereas for the people who are long premium, the main utility of gamma scalping is to pay for theta so that you're experiencing less erosion in your base position. So that's the main difference between long premium short premium gamma scalping. I'm going to spend more time talking about the long premium side again, because that's the more common use case. All right, let's talk about the components. There's two main things that we're going to have here. We have Delta and gamma, which I'll talk about those in a second. But what is the base style trade look like? As I mentioned, it'll normally be some sort of long premium strategy. So in this case, we're looking at something like a long straddle. I'm using think or swim, the on demand feature. So this is actually back in time on the 1st of June of 21, just for some context and what you're looking at here. But the base position typically would be something like this where we buy the 419 call and put. And that's really the base position that we have here. So now we're long in at the money straddle. So that is the beginning. Now in order to understand the idea of gamma scalping, we need to understand how these two Greeks specifically Delta and give them a move around. So as you can see on this top chart, we have two lines, the white line and the yellow line. The yellow line is a 325 days to expiration option. And then the white line is 31. Really, what I want you to note is the steepness in Delta. That's what I'm highlighting because the closer we get to expiration, the more Delta is going to move because options are approximating to one of two conditions, either it's going to zero if it's out of the money or if it's going to want to fit in the money. And this becomes steeper and steeper, the closer we get to expiration. Okay. Now we need to talk about gamma because it's called gamma scalping. Gamma is simply the rate of change of Delta. So when we're thinking about gamma scalping, what we're doing is identifying how much our Delta's are going to move. And then we're using that movement to buy in and out of the underlying so that we can cover our theta costs. So again, right now pretend we're long that straddle. And as we start to get some movements, we're going to trade the underlying, which I'll show you when we get into the example. Let's talk about some of the traits of gamma. We have a 10 DTE gamma here in yellow and then a 30 DTE gamma here in white. Again, notice how steep gamma becomes as we get closer to expiration. The other thing that you're going to note is as we get closer to expiration, the overall level of gamma is significantly higher. Whereas on a 30 DTE option, the highest the peak gamma, which is going to be at the money, is 0.04. Meanwhile, on the 10 DTE option, our at the money gamma is 0.08. Now this can vary quite a bit depending on what you're trading. And there's one other condition that matters. So I just went over this first one here where gamma in general will get, will increase in magnitude, the closer we get to expiration, it will also be highest for at the money options. Now there's one other function is this right here. Gamma decreases as volatility increases. So what I have sketched over this in these awful hand drawn lines are two different volatility scenarios. So if we have a high volatility scenario represented here in orange, notice how that is a bit more flat. And if we have low volatility, notice how we will have more gamma. The reason why this exists is because the way that options move. If we have really high volatility, a lot of that is already priced into the options. So a slight move in the underlying isn't going to make as big of a difference as it would have before. So two other things we got to talk about. One is if you are long premium, whether it's long calls, long puts, it doesn't matter, you are long gamma. The way to think about this is if you're long gamma, you just want something to move. You need it to move ideally in your favor. But in this scenario, if we're talking about a long straddle, we don't care which way it moves. We just need it to move because otherwise as time passes, we are just losing theta. If you were short premium, you were short gamma. This is kind of the inverse. We don't want things to move that much, which is again, why this entire concept of gamma doesn't really matter quite as much for short premium or short gamma positions is because we don't want it to move much anyways. Now, if it does, you can do some adjustments about it, but it doesn't work to the same degree as what we will see with long gamma positions. All right, we'll take a quick pause there, do a quick recap, and then I want to get into an example. So gamma scalping is a very active style strategy. We typically will try to create varying thresholds that we choose to gamma scalp on. Now, I'm not going to go super far in detail because I don't have time in this video for that, but in maybe a couple gamma follow on videos, I will go into some of the considerations because it's going to be largely dependent on what you are trading, how frequently it makes sense to gamma scalp. As we have our long base position, we are fighting theta. That is the entire premise of gamma scalping. All right, let's get over to an example. I have here a series of trades really, but I'm going to start with what I was just showing you in here. So again, today is one June 2011. It's I'm sorry, 2021 really, it's a November 22, but I again am using on demand. And I established this 419 long straddle. So what does this look like? Let's take a look. We bought to open 10 of the 21 June. So this is just a 20 days to expiration trade. And I bought the 419 column put at $10.79. So the initial position here has an outlay of $10,790. It's 20 DTE. Right now, we have long 59 gamma. We are long 67 delta's. And we are losing $260 to daily theta decay. So we don't want to just continually get sucked into our daily theta erosion while we're waiting for that ideally large move. So in order to maximize this base position, what we're doing is we're going to sell to open 67 shares of spy at 419 83. So really the current price as of right now, that's going to give us a $28,129 credit. So what just happened here? This is where we entered the trade. I drew a line right through the candle for some context. And we'll go back over to the thinkers woman a second. But I want you to see how this is working. So we have this long straddle. This was the remaining Greeks that really pertain to us right now. And we want to neutralize this delta. The whole point of this long straddle is we're not necessary. We don't want to be directional. That's the point of a straddle. It's designed to be non directional. We are just trying to gain exposure to volatility expansions or just a big move one way or the other for us to exit while we're waiting for that. We're fighting theta. So this is a way for us to attempt to offset theta. So right now as we sell those 67 shares, it's going to take that 67 delta and it's going to reduce it to just about nothing. So let's take a look. I have the same trade pulled up here. Notice how our dam is 59.12 delta is 67.83. So maybe we can do 68 shares instead of 67 just to go a little on the oversight just kind of rounding it up because you can't sell partial shares. And time is paused. So nothing is moving around. And I want you to look at what happens to delta. So we just got filled on our fake trade and notice delta is now 0.17 negative 0.17. Gamma doesn't move because we couldn't do anything in that scenario to adjust our gamma. If we wanted to be gamma neutral for a completely different style trade, we would structure the trade based off of gamma, not off of delta like we did here because if you look gamma on this option is 0.03 0.03 here, but they're going to adjust over time as time moves, which is why you see this discrepancy between the two, even though they're the same strike. So our long straddle is essentially flat. Maybe we're just seeing a small volatility expansion on the put side relative, which is why we're seeing that come down just a little bit. But overall we have a flat position or delta is a flat. Okay, now let's get back over to the screen and I want to show you I am just fast forwarding us to the end of the day because for me personally, if I'm gamma scalping more often than not, it's a daily endeavor. Some people will gamma scalp way more throughout the day, which is okay, but again, there are costs associated with that even though we don't have those upfront commissions on each order we send, we're still paying for those trades via payment for order flow, which comes in at where we're seeing quotes and where we're getting filled at. So don't allow the absence in the US, at least, of underlying commissions to mislead you into thinking that there's no cost associated with hedging. There still most certainly is. So that's why I typically will hedge daily, maybe a little more frequently depending on the size of the position and how much theta I'm losing. So I'm just using a beginning of day entry and an end of day adjustment just so that you can see how this thing works. Okay, so now let's fast forward time and instead of it being 0801 AM, now it is 1601. This is Eastern time. And here's the trade that we have on. Our long straddle is now losing some money. It's net PNL or it's unrealized PNL is negative 356. And the short shares are showing a very small profit of plus $65. So I'm going to fast forward time over here as well, just so that you could see exactly what this looks like. And as that loads, we can talk about it. Coming back over here, this in my opinion for me would be a slightly premature delta adjustment. And this goes back to the preference in terms of what we're trading and what we're trying to accomplish. So in this scenario, I would create a delta range. I think attempting to keep this at zero delta's at all times is very, very troublesome. So you can do it again, like I'm sharing end of day, you could do it for a percent or dollar move in the underlying. You could do it based on a delta threshold. So what I typically will do is I'll look at the size of the position. I'll create a delta range. And then I will simply hedge once we get outside that range. In this case, I would not be using 67 delta's, it would be more than that, probably at least 100 delta's. But again, for the sake of the example, I'm going to show you the adjustment. If we were doing an end of day adjustment, so each day. So in this case, we have our third trade. And we're going to buy to close 59 shares of our 67 really, we did 68 in a bit of an audible on the platform itself, which we'll see in a second. But this will show you the debit that we paid out and then the realized PNL. So in this case, we're still losing $260 a day in daily theta. In this scenario, we offset $57.82. It's not enough. Obviously. So if this were the case and we're hoping to get some sort of movement that we can scalp, but you're not guaranteed it. So that's why the frequency of scalping starts to matter a lot. So let's come over here real quick. Take a look at the platform and see where we're at. As you can see, it's about the same as what I was just showing you. Now we're in a unique scenario here because both the call and the put are both losing value. And that's because of theta and volatility in this scenario. So it is entirely possible when we're long straddle to lose on both. It's the less typical scenario, but it certainly does happen. And a lot of that's going to be dependent on again, volatility and theta. So in this case, as you could see, our position now has a total short delta's 57. And we're up about 65 bucks. So what I would do in this scenario is essentially flatten out the delta's again. And in this case, it means that I would have to buy 57 shares. I think it might be the same or slightly different in this scenario again, just because we changed the original the original hedge, but essentially all we're going to do then is make whatever that PNL is. So in this example, let's just do it real quick. We know that we need to buy. So we'll come up over here. We'll calm down here. And then we'll go to buy. And we need to buy 57 delta's in order to get us out of here. The midpoint on that is 41890, whatever it's paper trading. So it's all fake. And it looks like it's frozen up on me, which is super fun. So we'll just pretend that it went through. But realistically, all that's happening is I'm saying, okay, I sold them for 41983. I just bought them back at 41880 or whatever this thing said before it locked up on me. Or yeah, 41890. And then that's it. You make that PNL. Now you're delta flat again. And we're ready for the next move. So the end of day position here is we're still long the straddle. Nothing has changed there. The current price of the straddle is 1044. So we have a $350 unrealized PNL. And we're now just short the eight shares of spy at 41885. We realized 5782 today in PNL, although we lost more than that in daily theta. And this is gamma scalping. There are a ton of variations to it, which again, if there's interest, I'm happy to go into more in depth videos than some of the nuance differences. But I wanted to show you the primary mechanics so that most people can become more familiar with the concept. And then we could dive further into detail from there. I will say in a broad overview, this is still a very, very small part of my overall trading strategy. I typically will deploy these kinds of things if I want to be long premium. The only time that I typically want to be long premiums if I'm expecting some sort of big move. Now you can do this if it's not a straddle. You can do this with a long put or a long call. It's the same exact concept. But you start to introduce different risk because you don't have the same hedge available to you. Because remember, if you bought a call, bought a put, we're defining the risk in some shape or form again, depending on the structure of the trade. So this is a really fun conversation for me. I like game is scalping. I think it's a good thing for people to become familiar with.
