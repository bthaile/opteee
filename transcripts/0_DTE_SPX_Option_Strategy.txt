0.80s: hey everyone eric here somebody
2.64s: submitted
3.36s: a really good question so figured we'd
5.68s: do a quick video on it
7.12s: um i realized that this is a little bit
9.12s: miss size let's change that while we're
10.96s: on here perfect
11.92s: okay so here's the deal the question is
14.40s: on the screen here i'll summarize it as
16.24s: always to make it a little easier to
17.76s: follow along
18.72s: essentially this person whose name is
20.64s: also eric spelt with a k
22.56s: which is exactly why i made sure to get
24.80s: to this question because they have a
26.16s: super dope name um but essentially
29.04s: they're saying that they came across
30.48s: a zero days to expiration spx
34.32s: strategy and this is a
37.52s: really common trade that's popping up
39.84s: more
41.12s: and if you'll remember this is actually
43.20s: one that i also
44.72s: personally tested and there
47.92s: is a lot of hype around them because
51.28s: they're so appealing it's just like
53.04s: anything else with money
55.20s: when you see things that seem really
58.24s: cool
58.80s: or advantageous or anything like that it
61.92s: tends to draw a lot of attention it's no
63.92s: different here
65.04s: if i could tell you that you can make
66.88s: one thousand dollars
68.16s: in one day or 30 days which one sounds
70.88s: better to you
72.00s: one day so that's really what this is
74.24s: playing on
75.28s: is people's um lack of patience
78.48s: essentially
80.00s: where we think that if we can continue
82.72s: to make
83.44s: you know whatever amount of profit daily
86.88s: that we're going to be better off than
88.72s: if we establish a longer term trade
90.96s: and to give a you know bottom line
93.52s: upfront bluff
94.96s: response to it um it's not as good as it
97.76s: sounds
98.32s: and like i said i i tried it this is a
100.48s: strategy that i wanted to work
102.88s: and i found a hybrid of this strategy to
106.56s: be
106.88s: far more effective where whereas instead
109.76s: of doing
110.24s: zero days to expiration i will do
112.64s: something closer to seven or nine days
115.60s: with slightly different mechanics and
117.84s: that performed
118.96s: significantly better for me than this
121.68s: zero days to expiration
123.44s: trade so let's walk through the the
126.16s: general setup just for those who aren't
128.00s: familiar with the trade
129.36s: generally speaking you people will trade
132.08s: the larger indices
133.68s: spx ndx um things like that simply
137.52s: because they're larger so you don't need
139.12s: to put on
139.76s: as many trades or as many contracts to
142.00s: still earn
143.04s: a decent amount of money and the reason
145.28s: why that's so important is because
147.12s: most folks will trade this at a very low
150.00s: delta
151.28s: as you can see what they have
152.48s: highlighted here something close to a 5
155.36s: or 10 delta so if we take a look at that
158.40s: it technically would be a little bit
159.76s: lower than what you're seeing here
160.96s: because this is for a one day
163.20s: it should be a zero day but nonetheless
165.04s: if we look at a five delta
167.52s: you're looking at something close to 90
169.36s: cents on
170.56s: the the index and don't forget it's a
173.84s: spread so typically we're going to go
176.48s: out
176.88s: pretty far to buy something further out
179.44s: and then you're really
180.72s: walking away with 55 cents if you get
184.16s: hit at the mid
185.20s: so that's why most folks will trade an
187.76s: index
188.40s: of some sort so that they can
192.00s: still collect some money without having
194.64s: to trade as many
195.68s: uh contracts so the other thing that
199.04s: draws people to this trade obviously the
201.12s: short duration is there
203.04s: limited risk a lot of folks think
206.08s: and perceive limited risk because it is
208.24s: a spread
209.12s: which is factual anything that's spread
211.44s: off like this will have
213.44s: limited risk the reason why i say
215.60s: perceived
216.80s: is because there are some issues with
219.68s: that limited risk
220.96s: and really we'll get into that a little
223.12s: bit later but
224.48s: what it's going to come down to is most
228.08s: will have that spread set up and most
231.52s: will not be willing to risk the entire
234.80s: spread
235.68s: so most will will set some sort of stop
239.28s: on top of that spread so the spread
242.32s: serves is like oh if things go
244.32s: really really sideways that's my max
246.32s: loss
247.36s: but then most folks will also set a stop
249.60s: on top of that
250.88s: so that they can have something
252.32s: returning a little closer to their
253.92s: profile
254.88s: and what i mean by that is if we take a
257.60s: look again
258.48s: at this let's go a little further out to
260.64s: at least make some money
262.00s: let's take a look at selling this 3460
265.60s: and then we'll buy something that's you
268.24s: know
268.64s: a lot of folks will do something like 50
270.32s: wide so something like this 3410
272.96s: so in this trade we'll make a dollar 55
275.36s: and
276.56s: if we pull this over to an analyze
280.24s: um let me get rid of my other trade so
283.12s: for this
283.76s: trade and i have portfolio margins so my
287.28s: margin requirement is going to be lower
288.72s: than
289.12s: folks who don't the requirement for one
292.16s: of these trades for me
293.92s: is 4 800 so
297.12s: our max profit is 155 and then as we
300.72s: start decreasing
301.76s: our max loss skyrockets very quickly
305.20s: so if we zoom this out just a little bit
307.92s: more so we can get some more numbers
309.44s: down here
310.32s: what you see on the screen right here
312.16s: are our plus one
313.92s: and minus one standard deviation moves
316.72s: so
318.40s: one of the things that people really
320.56s: like about this trade is that it starts
322.88s: seemingly very deep in the profit zone
325.84s: whereas you would need a fairly
327.52s: meaningful move
328.48s: for it to fall out of profit the problem
331.60s: with this
332.56s: is once you start adding the stop
337.04s: you actually don't get this entire
339.44s: buffer
340.24s: you know where the break even is on the
341.60s: spread you're gonna get stopped out
343.12s: somewhere closer to where you're at
344.88s: maybe around here
345.84s: and we'll explore that now the other
348.08s: thing i want to highlight
349.12s: is the overall expectancy for the trade
351.76s: you all can calculate it on your own
353.44s: i've shared the formula but
354.96s: if you take a look this is 155 max
358.24s: profit
359.20s: max loss on this trade is 4 845
363.36s: so we are risking a whole lot to make
366.00s: very little
367.04s: and again most folks don't just trade a
369.92s: one law
370.40s: on these they'll try to size it up at
373.04s: least
373.60s: five ten lots something like that so
375.28s: that you can make some sort of actual
377.04s: money that would make 775 dollars but
379.92s: then again
380.88s: your max risk if it does go that way is
383.36s: 24
384.32s: 225 dollars so
387.52s: that's why i say the spread is really an
390.40s: illusion
391.44s: in that most people are using it simply
393.60s: for buying power reduction because a lot
395.52s: of these accounts
396.40s: can't support taking the naked risk
399.28s: because if you were to just sell the
400.80s: puts you would need two hundred and
402.08s: twelve thousand dollars in margin
404.56s: so first off just like any other
407.52s: conversation
408.16s: i've had if you can trade this
411.68s: strategy or a similar style strategy and
414.64s: not
415.44s: use the spread you're going to be far
417.12s: better off you're going to be safer
419.28s: not having to give any of that money
421.36s: back in
422.48s: just using the stop so that's kind of
424.96s: the first note on that limited risk for
426.96s: most people
427.68s: it's simply a buying power reduction
430.16s: tool as compared to truly minimizing
432.40s: your risk
433.52s: the other thing to remember is when we
434.88s: use a spread our expectancy
437.20s: in and of itself changes quite a bit
439.20s: especially
440.48s: when you choose to manage the spread
443.68s: and i have quite a few videos on that as
446.64s: well
447.76s: so the other thing that
450.88s: i have on here is the perceived margin
453.68s: of safety
455.12s: and i was just kind of discussing that
456.72s: in some capacity when we look at the
458.40s: spread
459.28s: um but the most important point that i
462.24s: wanted to drive home
463.36s: on that component is the fact
466.80s: that if you set a stop you're going to
469.92s: find yourself
470.88s: in a kind of much higher probability of
474.16s: being hit
474.88s: so let's explore the the overall
477.52s: probabilities on this trade
479.28s: so first let's say where is the earliest
482.88s: max
483.36s: loss realized let's call it 3407.
489.36s: we'll call it 3407. you're you're pretty
491.28s: much at max loss
493.12s: so if we go to the probability analysis
495.36s: and we go to
497.20s: um a one day trade
500.48s: so that would be tomorrow the
502.64s: probability of it going to 34.07
506.64s: is something close to the
509.28s: probability is off the goddamn
512.40s: it's off the chart that's kind of
513.52s: annoying uh he
517.68s: so the probability of it going to 3407
520.64s: is
520.96s: something close to 10 11
524.08s: something like that so it's a you know
526.40s: 11
527.12s: probability that you're gonna realize
529.36s: that max loss
530.64s: on the trade which is still pretty high
533.04s: now what again what most people do is
535.44s: they'll set a stop
536.32s: two times your credit received two and a
538.00s: half times your credit received three
539.28s: times your credit receives something
540.56s: like that
541.36s: statistically what i found for my seven
543.68s: days to expiration trade two and a half
545.84s: was the magic number for me so
549.44s: if we received a dollar 55
552.56s: that's gonna put us somewhere close to
554.56s: five dollars and 43 cents for this
556.72s: spread
557.44s: so that means that we would put a stop
559.92s: when this
560.72s: spread is trading somewhere close
564.08s: to five dollars in 43 cents so we can
567.36s: take a look at that
568.72s: and notice this um
572.08s: purple line this is telling us today
575.76s: what this thing would be trading for so
578.56s: again
579.28s: if we're looking at a dollar 55 and
582.56s: we're gonna allow that to
583.84s: expand to around five dollars and 43
586.72s: cents
587.44s: there are a few ways we can estimate
589.12s: that first one is you can use this
591.60s: which is a very reasonable tool you can
593.36s: just see where
594.96s: that that loss would occur again to make
597.92s: this a little easier
599.04s: you can zoom it down to a one lot so you
601.76s: can see where you would be at 543
604.96s: on your max loss which would occur
608.00s: somewhere around 34.76
611.04s: call it 34.78 because there's a higher
614.48s: probability as well that if the
615.84s: underlying is moving down like that
617.60s: buying power expansion is going to occur
619.68s: so let's call it 3478.
621.84s: we go to our probability analysis let's
623.84s: take a look at the probability of seeing
626.12s: 3478
627.92s: and you are much closer to
631.36s: 40 it it's looking like it'll be
634.96s: 38 or so the reason why i have it off
637.92s: the date is because when i put it on the
639.60s: date itself it
641.28s: um is off the chart like i can't
643.84s: actually see the percentage which is
645.60s: super annoying but
646.72s: it is what it is um but you get the
649.04s: point so it's
650.64s: about a 40 chance just just shy
653.92s: of a 40 chance of getting stopped
657.12s: out at your stop if you're using two and
659.52s: a half times credit received
661.20s: so what that means is sixty percent of
663.52s: the time
664.24s: you'll make something close to your max
665.84s: profit of 155
668.24s: dollars and then somewhere close to 40
670.48s: percent of the time
671.60s: you're gonna lose that 543
674.80s: on that zero days expiration trade you
677.12s: can work that out yourself
678.40s: but again you see the issue with the
680.88s: trade
682.08s: okay so we already talked about the
683.92s: allure in some capacity it's quick money
685.84s: so
686.64s: it's just anytime you see that you need
688.24s: this you need to approach with the
689.68s: skeptical mind so we've been walking
692.32s: through
693.76s: the the constraints as i was walking
695.76s: through the general setup and kind of
697.28s: correlating it to the trade-off
699.68s: in general this trade does not work very
703.20s: well
703.84s: when the market is two-sided if we have
707.92s: a floating bull market like we did this
711.12s: strategy works
712.48s: very well i used it myself for some time
714.88s: during the bull market
716.48s: but my biggest recommendation this isn't
719.20s: like a set it and forget it this is your
721.04s: you know one trick pony you can do this
722.64s: one trade and be successful into
724.64s: perpetuity this
725.60s: this isn't that it is very much
727.84s: conditional
728.96s: so setting up different environments
731.92s: where you will
732.64s: employ this trade becomes increasingly
735.28s: important particularly the shorter the
737.12s: time frame that's why i like the seven
738.88s: to nine data expiration because that
740.64s: allows me
741.76s: a little bit more of a buffer for some
744.08s: movement in the
745.20s: underlying itself so i don't exit the
747.44s: trade too frequently
749.60s: because most of these trades will work
752.00s: out
752.64s: but it's also going to test your pain
754.32s: tolerance if you see
755.68s: something that your max profit is 775
759.60s: dollars and you're looking at a 15 000
762.00s: loss temporarily that's not easy not to
764.72s: mention again that most would be
766.16s: stopped out before that point so
769.44s: in general this is an interesting
771.60s: strategy it is
772.88s: definitely conditional it's useful in
775.76s: kind of perpetual bull markets
777.92s: but again the biggest drawdown in that
780.32s: is there's no volatility so you really
782.40s: can't make a lot of money on this trade
783.84s: you have to size up even more on top of
786.40s: a really wide spread or if you're
787.84s: trading naked
789.04s: and then you have to deal you know with
790.64s: the the fallout from that
793.12s: in general i think that it is a
796.24s: again a fun one to paper trade if you
798.88s: set
799.36s: good criteria around it it is absolutely
802.16s: one that i would revisit in the future
804.64s: if my certain circumstances are met but
807.84s: the seven day seven to nine day version
810.08s: that i employ
811.20s: is a lot more utilitarian and it has a
815.04s: far better expectancy than what you see
816.72s: here so the punch line is
818.64s: anybody that is selling this trade as
821.44s: you know the end-all be-all one-trick
823.04s: pony
823.76s: or this is a super successful strategy
826.24s: it's just
827.36s: statistically not there so if that is
830.00s: the case for them
831.28s: there's likely other things they're
832.80s: doing on top of it you know whatever
834.64s: that looks like i don't want to dive too
836.56s: far
837.28s: into other folks strategies simply
839.36s: because i i don't know them well enough
841.20s: to to comment on all of it
843.28s: but i am sharing my personal experience
845.60s: testing this because i was interested in
847.76s: it myself
849.12s: i tend to accept
852.64s: higher probability higher risk trades
856.72s: because it's a higher probability that
858.96s: that doesn't scare me off per se
860.88s: but there is a balance and in general
862.88s: this trade does not hit that balance
865.28s: so i really like this conversation this
867.44s: is a fun one to check out
869.12s: if anybody else you know has anything
871.04s: else they want me to take a look at in
872.32s: terms of strategy or trades you know
874.08s: send them in that's kind of
875.68s: a fun thing to take a look at and talk
877.36s: to folks about and i will catch
879.28s: everybody later
