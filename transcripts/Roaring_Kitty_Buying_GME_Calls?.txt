0.64s: oh yes GameStop the old starting to look
3.20s: like it might be slowing down throw a
5.00s: little curveball and now I'm going to
7.76s: walk you through what I'm seeing here
9.28s: because yesterday I was not planning on
11.04s: doing an update video and we saw a very
14.08s: meaningful expansion call volume today
16.64s: we actually see the same I'm also seeing
18.92s: a lot of conjecture about roaring Kitty
21.48s: dfv buying more calls I'm going to walk
24.00s: you through exactly what I'm seeing in
26.76s: terms of how viable that might be as a
29.36s: theory couple things do come to mind for
32.20s: me the first one is based on the call
34.72s: volume yesterday I actually entered a
36.88s: position on earlier today myself and
39.72s: that's specifically because I am
42.72s: designed as an options Trader to look
45.20s: for opportunity agnostic of how it shows
47.92s: itself and that kind of volume actually
51.32s: is something that I tend to trade so
55.16s: that's how I originally came across this
56.96s: entire Saga when roaring Kitty at the
60.20s: time I didn't know was him was buying a
61.60s: bunch of calls and it popped up on a few
63.12s: of my scanners so let's take a look at
65.16s: what's going on here 24th of June
67.24s: yesterday I actually wasn't planning on
68.88s: doing an update saw that crazy call
70.72s: volume so I was like ah let me take a
72.16s: look with everybody see what I see and
74.56s: the call volume is interesting what was
76.16s: really annoying honestly about yesterday
77.92s: was this I I couldn't dig into the
80.16s: details um what was going on so I
82.56s: actually used another tool that I have
84.36s: access to to help me pull down a bunch
87.00s: of Market data to look at what this
89.36s: looked like and I'll show you that in
91.16s: just a moment but starting from the top
94.24s: as per usual we see a really interesting
97.64s: movement in volatility and what I mean
100.12s: by that is not just the fact that the
101.88s: front month has expanded nearly 60
104.16s: points from 142% Vault to 2011 but even
109.28s: more interesting obviously there's less
111.36s: time there's only 3 days left to
113.72s: expiration and now this is expecting a
116.04s: 3.6% move it's actually a little higher
118.20s: than that last I looked as compared to
120.32s: the 2.79 that's not an insignificant
122.48s: difference but that's also nothing
123.76s: that's going to you know send us to the
125.44s: moon it's just interesting then I look
128.12s: across the options chain here and it's
130.88s: bumpy and that might sound a little
133.12s: esoteric I'll explain exactly what that
135.00s: means it's kind of weird it's almost
136.60s: like if you ever watch The Matrix when
138.48s: that one dude the operator there's all
140.16s: the zeros and ones and it kind of just
141.72s: looks like a full picture to him that's
143.36s: kind of what the stuff looks like to me
145.04s: I can see the lines that are going on in
147.60s: here in terms of the smile on the
149.44s: surface
150.52s: and I'll walk you through exactly what
152.80s: I'm looking at when I see front
157.28s: expiration busy that just means
159.28s: something's going on in the front end
160.80s: that's okay this can happen but follow
163.32s: along with me let's go on a journey
165.04s: together 21 82% Vol 158 15455
179.92s: down comes down a little bit more but
182.20s: then goes back up very interesting and I
184.60s: also don't think it's any mistake that
186.48s: this is the 19th July expiration
188.48s: obviously Opex is typically a thing
191.48s: across products but you can tell that's
194.12s: also part of what's going on here this
196.28s: also Keys me off likely into some of
199.08s: what I'm going to find when I go through
200.96s: the time in sales with you all then as
204.36s: we continue down this path 156 now it
206.48s: drops back down to 150 140
210.76s: 42 very interesting the fact that we
214.04s: have volatility that's kind of ebbing
216.08s: and flowing like this and not observing
218.92s: more either like a standard smile or
221.84s: even a slight decline or even a slight
223.92s: raise the fact that there's this
225.76s: bumpiness to it it tells me that the
228.08s: market is pricing in different things
229.60s: and different periods for you guess that
232.24s: different reasons we don't always know
234.40s: what's going on as Traders and we cool
237.00s: enough don't have to know but what we do
238.96s: need to do is be able to see something's
241.12s: going on and as I could see it clear as
242.96s: day something is going on here I don't
244.96s: know exactly what to what degree it's so
247.36s: hard to tell and I keep reiterating this
249.44s: message because I think it's so
250.64s: important to be respectful of everybody
253.20s: I am not here to spread hype or fud I am
256.40s: here to look as objectively as humanly
258.76s: possible at the data that I see based on
260.88s: what I've seen before over Decades of
262.84s: doing this and share that information I
265.84s: want you all to come to your own
267.68s: conclusions I am not here to press any
269.72s: anything on to you guys it's your own
271.04s: account it's your money you have to do
272.20s: what's right for you okay this is weird
275.68s: I think we've hit that going down to the
277.80s: implied volatility curve again these
280.56s: kinks are getting massive compared to
283.00s: what we saw even recently if we go back
285.64s: here take a look at some of the Kinks
288.28s: we're seeing in the front expiration and
291.48s: then if we start going back to what we
293.28s: were just looking at now like these are
295.76s: very large now which is really
297.20s: interesting especially notice how smooth
299.16s: it is on the put side the other thing is
302.16s: the put side is continuing to expand I
304.36s: already told you guys back on Sunday I
306.56s: fully expect to see this and again this
308.92s: is a tradable event for the options
310.60s: Traders out there specifically those who
312.24s: can isolate volatility this is a very
314.68s: predictable movement at this point right
316.36s: now on the product where we're seeing
318.76s: the near-term out of the money far out
321.40s: of the money V expand pretty
323.32s: meaningfully and as of late the far out
326.32s: ofth the money call volatility is not
328.84s: moving in line with it whereas before it
330.76s: was actually outpacing it pretty
333.44s: significantly okay the implied
335.80s: volatility thing cool but again there's
337.88s: nothing in here that's screaming at me
340.08s: as something super crazy is going on now
342.40s: let's take a look at this somebody sent
345.00s: me this post from Howard Kitty that's
348.20s: actually a great name Howard Kitty dummy
350.32s: come on man don't put yourself down like
351.92s: that you're a smart ape got plenty of
354.04s: wrinkles on that brain and uh let's see
357.00s: what they have to say it says the $20
359.04s: mark flooding with calls for the 19th of
363.28s: July I don't see this and I want to take
367.40s: a look at it with you guys to maybe see
369.32s: what I might be missing and what time
372.48s: frame you guys are looking
374.64s: at because so far this isn't what I'm
377.64s: seeing and let's see keep an eye on this
380.32s: today but just remember premium on this
382.64s: shot up a week later when he posted his
385.16s: YOLO update speculation called it then
388.20s: calling it now watch this 20 call option
390.80s: today and tomorrow so this was from
393.24s: earlier today the 25th of June so let's
395.60s: take a look at the 20 call option volume
398.96s: from today and if I pop in here we
402.48s: scroll down to this right now I have it
405.24s: filtered by just the 20s and I have it
408.68s: limited to minimum 500 size buys we can
412.44s: open this up just a little bit more
414.20s: maybe to add a little more efficacy
416.12s: behind the
417.48s: thesis and here's what I see
420.44s: I
422.08s: see three tranches of call volumes go
425.72s: through at the 20 in 19 July one for 16
429.72s: Aug one for 28 June I see
434.16s: all very small size and again I I'm not
438.16s: trying to put down the idea the idea
439.68s: might be right still I'm just telling
441.08s: you what I see here today I I don't see
444.52s: this big massive flow into the 20s today
448.12s: in any expiration cycle
450.16s: I see overall really small transactions
454.00s: that's what this shows me and then I do
456.36s: see actually more put transactions is
460.04s: also somewhat interesting there could be
463.60s: something to be said about people
465.48s: looking to transact puts and it's like
469.72s: kind of split right like if we look at
471.28s: the overall volume today it's kind of
473.68s: split down the middle between people
475.76s: that are selling and buying puts whereas
477.76s: on the call side that's not the case on
479.76s: the call side they're buying calls 35%
483.52s: which is a Sixpoint lead over selling
486.48s: calls so that's not
488.80s: insignificant but it's not
491.44s: materializing necessarily centralized in
494.00s: this 20 so then if I get rid of this
497.60s: strike limitation and I open it up we
501.04s: see that there's 60 calls that have had
503.20s: a pretty big volume I'm seeing
506.48s: 1474 then in the 22s I'm seeing just shy
509.68s: of a thousand then I'm seeing that this
512.20s: is putside don't care don't care like
515.16s: even this it's just not a ton of big
518.52s: positions so then this does beg the
521.28s: question is it possible that roaring
525.16s: Kitty is buying calls yes is it possible
529.32s: that he's buying calls in much smaller
532.24s: sizes than what he did previously yes
534.88s: that is possible the reason why it's
536.88s: possible is because he doesn't have this
539.48s: the same amount of liquid Capital that
541.48s: he did before right so if I try to find
545.52s: let me pull this up real
547.00s: quick here we go this is back from an
549.48s: update I did on the 13th of June I'm
551.68s: pretty sure this is the position he
553.08s: posted on the 10th of June so obviously
555.44s: it's actually a little bit old now we
558.28s: don't know what this looks like but what
559.56s: I'm highlight like he still has $6
561.32s: million in cash it's not as much as he
563.68s: did before because he put on a massive
566.80s: options position before this case it's
570.52s: much more conservative so is it possible
574.52s: that some of the buying activity that
576.12s: we're seeing is raring Kitty sure it is
578.52s: possible what I can tell you though is
580.88s: based on what I've seen him do
582.88s: previously this doesn't line up but it
585.80s: could not line up for those reasons it
588.24s: could be that he's entering with a much
590.84s: smaller stake but still if we kind of go
594.68s: with this theme of looking at the 20s I
597.48s: really want to focus on a specific point
599.68s: because if we look at the value of these
602.08s: transactions it's just not that much
605.32s: that we've seen today so we have
609.48s: $4
611.32s: at 200 something like that
614.36s: so it's 80 grand like we're not even in
617.92s: the ballpark of his sizes because the
620.88s: thing is is even for he's still a $6
623.56s: million at least the last we saw so
627.28s: punchline could this be him yes does it
630.12s: seem to be likely it's him based on
632.04s: previous by activity that I seen and
634.24s: then also based on sizing even if he's
636.44s: not you looking to use all six but if
638.48s: he's looking to use two right putting on
640.52s: an 80 g position at a clip with just one
644.04s: doesn't really make sense and I actually
646.00s: started going through the previous
648.24s: periods before he launched his position
651.20s: updates and I looked at the time frames
653.40s: in between them so I could see and
655.52s: identify what kind of activity he uses
658.88s: what time frame does he use in between
661.44s: his transactions as he's phasing in and
663.44s: phasing out of these positions cuz
665.12s: that's the cool part about the fact that
668.56s: we have the screenshots and they're time
671.20s: bound I I literally can look at historic
673.60s: data and see what happened and this just
676.36s: doesn't line up with that so again not
679.24s: saying it's not him just so far I don't
682.08s: see it now the other thing is going back
686.04s: to yesterday this is data that I pulled
689.64s: from the 24th of June these are kind of
691.60s: just the larger transactions and again
694.28s: it's to test this kind of idea about the
696.84s: 20s and here's what I see at the 20s the
700.28s: first thing is you'll notice there's not
702.68s: a ton of transactions the next thing is
705.32s: we have to get rid of a bunch of these
706.76s: right we're not looking for calendars
708.20s: and all that stuff we're looking for
709.92s: long calls so if we break it down to
712.12s: Long calls there's three tranches that
715.48s: are pretty far apart which is much
717.56s: further apart than what he was trans
719.24s: transacting at when he was phasing in
720.84s: and out of his previous options
722.80s: positions and again these are all very
726.00s: small positions very very small position
729.24s: don't feel insecure it's okay small
731.36s: position still a position but I don't
733.92s: really think that this is roaring Kitty
737.28s: again may not be more clear it could be
740.60s: but based on the total breath of
742.88s: evidence that I see in front of me it's
744.88s: just not what I see right now so when I
747.28s: go back to the options chain and I try
751.08s: to understand what's going on with this
752.80s: volume so if we come down here we throw
755.00s: this volume on let's take a look at all
757.28s: of it we still see 200 almost 278,000
760.52s: calls transacted today against 88,000
762.56s: puts massive massive call volume and
765.44s: then if I look at where it's happening
767.60s: take a look at all these large boxes
770.68s: where it's highlighting it's the 28th of
772.24s: June it's this front expiration the
774.64s: probability of roaring Kitty putting on
777.32s: a massive options position today
780.44s: yesterday that's set to expire this week
784.40s: it's so low because IV is so expensive
787.64s: he's bidding himself up he has to do
789.76s: something with the position before the
791.20s: end of the week so it doesn't really
792.52s: have any time to work I don't see him
794.88s: coming here if he's buying if he's
797.56s: looking to build a position I would
799.00s: expect it to be further out but again
802.12s: who really knows he's done a lot of
803.84s: things so far that when I try to assess
805.76s: it objectively I can't always connect
807.88s: the dots and I do think part of that is
810.24s: why he does what he does is purposely
812.56s: for that reason but if we look at this
815.40s: overall volume today I mean like take a
817.68s: look at this this is at the 25's 24,600
822.28s: VA volume volume I don't want to say VA
824.76s: like that in this case and then if we
827.00s: take a look here it's at the 24s 19 so
830.96s: if we come in here and we take a look at
833.48s: these chains a ton of this is at the
835.28s: money transactions and this is actually
837.56s: really cool because again this does
839.28s: start to build a little bit of a gamma
841.36s: Ram these are out of the money the
842.68s: market makers are not going to fully
844.00s: hedge these positions yet so it's still
845.88s: very probable that they land out of the
847.76s: money so they're not going to have a
848.88s: bunch of shares to cover these more
850.20s: often than not and we can tell again
852.92s: definitively from the volume even if we
854.84s: wipe out all of the oi with the volume
856.84s: that transacted today at least 10,000
859.48s: were opened so this does look like a lot
861.48s: of buying volume and the other thing
863.72s: that I find interesting is that it's at
865.40s: the money that's not the cheapest place
867.72s: because this stuff I see out here this
869.64s: is more YOLO activity in my opinion like
872.60s: if we open this up to all we go super
875.88s: far out and we see 8,000 here with
878.80s: 51,000 depth at the 128s that doesn't re
882.24s: that doesn't tell me this is going to
883.40s: 128 at all there's a really low low low
886.40s: probability move this is literally in my
889.16s: opinion people trying to gain really
890.88s: cheap exposure not understanding how
893.44s: options work this also could be a bunch
896.24s: of other activities going on I'm looking
898.08s: at it specifically from from the retail
899.52s: trading perspective and postulating what
901.64s: I see and that's what it is so where do
904.40s: we go from here straight up I am going
907.04s: to be watching like an absolute Hawk now
909.16s: this options chain not even the front
910.92s: expiration again like it's interesting
912.40s: to me with the Vall but I am so curious
914.92s: about this volume that we're seeing
916.52s: because if we click this in and see
919.16s: where most of that 277 is 165 800 is in
924.00s: the front expiration then if we go out
926.08s: the next two expirations it's 47 total
929.40s: then if we go to 19th July it's 38
931.20s: against 8 so really big call skew in
934.00s: terms of volume here as well but it's
936.48s: not as
937.28s: much all of the activity right now is up
939.64s: here in the in the 28 June massive
942.68s: massive call volume on a relative basis
944.60s: so I'm going to keep watching I'm going
946.24s: to see if any interesting buying
947.96s: activity comes in I'm going to keep
949.48s: looking at the volatility see if
950.88s: anything is keying off there and we'll
952.96s: see where we go from here I always
954.92s: appreciate people sending me stuff like
956.52s: this I'm always happy to take a look at
958.00s: it and I hope Howard Kitty is right that
960.76s: would be really cool to see Cann not
962.24s: know yet any questions let me know be an
964.92s: outlier I'll see you guys later
