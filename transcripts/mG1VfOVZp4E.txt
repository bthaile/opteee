0.00s: They're going to see the. Yeah, the tight things already.
2.76s: So we got Mr. David Hunter back on last time we talked, I think,
7.44s: is there's a lot of December or so?
9.24s: Welcome back to have you again. Yeah, thanks Eric.
12.04s: Glad to be back.
13.72s: So we were talking before we started just a little bit about the stuff
17.12s: that's going on and you know, you create a rush up.
19.52s: It's just a very fascinating start to 2022.
24.28s: Um, you know, we were just talking a little bit about how that's looked
27.80s: so far, but one of the things I'm curious to dive into,
31.44s: dovetailing off of that initial conversation is,
34.44s: how does that impact the markets in your eyes?
37.84s: There's a lot of things that obviously Russia contributes, natural gas,
42.48s: things like that.
43.44s: Just curious from a broad perspective, what does that look like to you?
46.28s: And how does this play out throughout the rest of the year?
50.08s: Yeah, for sure.
50.96s: I mean, they've certainly pushed the commodity prices up higher.
54.84s: You know, well, obviously had this spike.
58.20s: And it just creates a lot of uncertainty, which markets don't like the
62.32s: amazing thing is that almost to the day that Russia invaded Ukraine,
69.68s: the market started rallying.
71.16s: So I mean, this is a classic example of,
74.68s: sell the rumor by the news, you know, and, um, and basically, I think there,
81.48s: there's still is plenty of uncertainty, but I think the market was able to
84.60s: wrap their arms around the fact that we kind of see what this is going to be,
90.76s: you know, barring some unforeseen thing that drag us into some kind of a world war.
95.64s: And I think they pretty quickly kind of surmised.
99.00s: Yes, we can deal with this.
100.92s: Yes, it's going to cause an inflation spike and cause, you know, some shortages,
105.60s: et cetera.
106.68s: But, you know, markets are pretty amazing in terms of kind of diskind of things
111.88s: very quickly.
113.32s: And I think that's what they've done.
115.24s: Um, unless this thing really escalates again, uh, I think you've seen, you know,
120.72s: the effect of Ukraine and Russia already, uh, and now the big thing is if they
127.00s: can get a negotiated settlement, and I, I know means say that's a given.
131.16s: But if that happens over the next month, next few weeks, um, I think you will
136.40s: see that will help the markets, you know, that it has, even though we've
141.44s: rallied since they, they went in there.
144.20s: There was plenty holding the market back in, you know, January, February,
147.76s: prior to the rally that I think had something to do with the risks in Ukraine.
152.72s: So, so I, I think if we get Ukraine resolved, um, and it's some sort of a
158.48s: solution that looks like it can last, uh, I think that will take us, you know,
163.28s: up sharply to maybe, maybe to my, my targets.
167.96s: Interesting.
168.52s: And it leads to kind of a following question.
170.84s: So, and you alluded to some of it, um, being the quality of the peace talks,
177.16s: but is there a scenario where you think, you know,
181.08s: Russian Ukraine have these peace talks and the market doesn't like the outcome?
185.44s: What kind of thing would have to happen for there to be a negative reaction to
189.24s: that in your opinion?
191.44s: Yeah.
192.36s: I think anything short of dragging NATO into this,
197.32s: probably the market just has handled and discounted.
201.32s: Got it.
201.80s: If it becomes something that widens to the point where it looks like the US is
206.12s: stepping in or NATO is stepping in, uh, that is something I think the markets
211.04s: would be shaken up by and certainly possible, but at this point doesn't look
215.96s: like the most probable scenario.
218.12s: Yeah.
218.64s: And then the other just last part on that out of curiosity, do you think the markets,
223.64s: or how do you think the markets would react to China potentially interacting?
227.88s: Because obviously we've been talking about the US interacting with Russian Ukraine.
231.68s: There's been some back talk of China, but I'm just curious, you know, your thoughts on that?
235.96s: Yeah.
236.24s: My sense is China is smart enough to know that they'll, they'll support Russia in,
242.92s: in kind of subtle ways or in, you know, back channel ways.
247.20s: They're smart enough to know, you know, an awful lot of their, the bread is
251.32s: buttered by US, you know, dollars and, and, you know, do we want to
257.56s: jeopardize our economy to support a situation like this?
261.48s: I think they're probably, you know, if they, if they didn't have to worry about
266.36s: that, they'd be in there probably very supportive.
269.28s: I think they're trying to walk a line right now.
271.68s: Clearly they're, you know, they're coaxing up to Russia or Russia's
275.20s: coaxing up to them, but they're still trying to appear like, you know, they're
281.20s: not, they're not pushing this.
283.36s: They're not vocally against it, but they're certainly not, you know, coming in
286.84s: with both feet saying, yeah, we're here with you, Russia.
289.92s: So I think they understand we have, we have some leverage over them too.
296.72s: Yeah.
297.08s: And I think that that's one of the things I was actually talking a couple
300.24s: friends about is there's the saying I'm sure you've heard it, you know, the
303.56s: enemy of my enemy is my friend.
305.52s: And, you know, right now, US isn't necessarily the first pick for either
310.20s: Russia or China in a broad sense in terms of alliances and whatnot.
314.20s: But it does seem like China's in this very precarious spot because I know
318.28s: that they again, our economies are so intertwined.
321.48s: And I find that to be such an interesting ad in to defense measures.
327.80s: You know, we're talking about one country invading another and then the
330.92s: global stance against that.
332.68s: And then there's still this backdrop behind it.
335.08s: Um, just for my own edification, if China did decide to back Russia more openly,
343.56s: personally, I don't see that really happening.
346.32s: But if it were to happen, what kind of, you know, follow through, do you think
350.44s: we would see across the economy and just the marketplace at large?
355.32s: Yeah, we certainly indicate that China was becoming more aggressive.
359.24s: Uh, not, not, you know, sizing it up as, you know,
363.60s: what's the economic cost to us, et cetera.
365.84s: And they're basically, I think they'd be becoming, uh, a, a,
369.68s: be becoming more open about their alliance with Russia.
374.60s: I mean, we all know, you know, two commutes nations that, uh, are much closer to each
379.68s: other than they are to us.
381.08s: But I think they still want to appear to be that country that is not the
386.40s: aggressor that is, yes, they're building a strong defense.
390.20s: And yes, you know, there are signs that they're getting more aggressive.
393.92s: But I think that would be a crossing of the line that would, the markets would
398.76s: take that pretty negatively.
401.80s: Yeah.
402.32s: The other big, the other big issue with all of this, obviously, are the sanctions.
408.20s: And the fact that we're kind of, you know, pushing, um, these,
414.44s: these large countries and countries that do a lot of world trade away from the
419.56s: dollar.
420.72s: And, you know, we're really not necessarily.
424.24s: I'm not sure if that was all well thought out, uh, in terms of when, you
428.52s: know, when they took the, um, the last steps, um, they're really, you're,
433.68s: you're seeing obviously Russia is backing the rubble with some sort of a
438.36s: gold backing and, and China's, I think, celebrating the fact that the
443.68s: dollar is becoming, uh, you know, under fire a little bit here in the,
448.56s: you know, some settlements, even, even Saudi Arabia is talking about
452.32s: settling, uh, you know, oil contracts in China and in, in you on it.
458.28s: So, I mean, I, I think we are seeing some fallout from those sanctions
463.80s: that I think are not necessarily the smartest things we could have done.
468.04s: Um, but, you know, again, the market seems to be handling it.
471.72s: So it's more, I think that's more of a, it may speed up, uh, an inevitable
477.48s: thing that was going to happen that the, you know, dollar was going to
479.84s: lose some reserve status down the road.
482.36s: I continue to say I think it's farther down the road than some of the,
486.64s: you know, some of the bears think I think you're still probably several,
490.44s: you know, five years away from anything that really impacts our, our,
496.88s: leadership as a reserve currency.
499.76s: Yeah, and it's funny because that was the follow on point I was going to
502.76s: ask you, especially as it pertains to the swift banking system and, um,
507.20s: some of those impacts.
509.08s: Do you think that if, you know, Russian Ukraine come to a peace agreement,
515.24s: do you think that those sanctions will be backed off?
518.64s: And if so, what would the impact to the market be in that scenario?
522.88s: Or do you think the sanctions would remain in place and kind of tailored off over time?
527.44s: Yeah, I think it's going to be probably, um, reduced over time.
532.60s: I, I think I would be, we'd be foolish to accept the, you know,
537.64s: any agreement in, you know, and swallow the whole thing.
542.00s: All at once as if we, we can trust food and we really can't.
545.96s: Right.
546.24s: However, I do think they will, it'll probably be part of the settlement is that
551.08s: there will be certain give and take on the part of, you know, NATO too.
555.32s: Um, so I would think some of those sanctions will be, you know, pulled away
559.76s: and some, some left in place and pulled away slowly.
563.36s: Um, I, I would think, um, you know,
566.88s: the swift situation would be resolved early.
571.20s: I don't know that, but I would think, you know, because that, that's
575.08s: hurt to everybody.
575.88s: So, right.
578.20s: Yeah, it felt like at one point it really did feel like Putin was kind of playing
582.36s: chess while we were playing checkers.
584.00s: I don't know if you saw the, the video that he put out, um, you know,
588.92s: he, he had a fascinating video.
591.12s: I'll throw it in the link to the video here for people want to check it out.
594.08s: And, you know, I'm paraphrasing.
595.60s: So definitely check out the source directly, but, um, it was to the effect of
600.40s: this is why we can't trust a dollar because they choose to do things like this.
605.36s: And it's, you look at that and you're like, the guy's not wrong.
609.92s: You know what I mean?
610.44s: Like I, I could see a lot of people look at that saying, well, yeah, how safe is
614.40s: this if they can just choose to react like this.
619.08s: And I was like, I was kind of, you know, it's like, well, well,
622.68s: play because that's a really effective.
626.00s: Wine of thought.
627.52s: If you really think about it in the last several years, we've chosen to say,
632.80s: particularly with Russia, in particular, Russia, we've chosen to say rather than
637.68s: get into any kind of armed conflict with these guys, we're going to throw our
641.12s: weight around with the dollar and with, with our economic weight.
645.52s: Right.
645.84s: And, you know, we're going to sanction and hurt the oligarchs, et cetera.
650.56s: And I, he probably had calculated some of this ahead of time in terms of saying,
655.24s: you know, I think we can get them to move and actually in the long run, hurt
661.00s: themselves here.
661.84s: So we'll see.
663.12s: But I don't think what we did is without risk.
667.12s: Yeah.
667.48s: I think that's a literally perfect characterization there.
672.64s: So that leads you were talking a little bit about your, your forecast.
678.32s: How could we not talk about those?
680.44s: So, you know, last time we were talking in early December, you know, you were
685.76s: messaging about the melt up.
689.52s: You obviously had your levels in place there.
692.84s: And then a proceeding global bust of some sort, you know, potentially to the
697.76s: magnitude of, you know, an 80% drawdown.
700.72s: Obviously, you know, things change and new information comes in.
705.68s: So I would be curious just to get an update on that.
708.44s: I've seen a couple of your Twitter posts, but obviously I always enjoy hearing
712.44s: the, you know, the overall thought from, from you directly.
716.16s: So I'd love to hear just from a macro standpoint.
720.40s: What are you thinking about the markets here?
722.68s: Yeah.
722.92s: The forecast had to really change.
724.52s: I still believe we're going to see a melt up to 6000, the S&P 20,000.
729.92s: That's actually, I should say, since we talked in my January letter, which came
734.76s: out the first week of January, I did raise my target.
738.20s: So my target, I think in December was 15 to 300 S&P.
742.80s: Yeah.
743.08s: I think he's 55,000.
744.72s: 18,000 NASDAQ.
746.64s: And I'm now 20,000 NASDAQ, 6,000 S&P, 40, 45,000 Dow, which had been 42, I think.
756.44s: So, so I definitely got more aggressive on the upside.
760.72s: My 80% bear market and global bust has not changed at all.
766.28s: If anything, it has stretched out a bit because of Ukraine, you know, the, you know,
772.80s: the correction in the first couple months of this year, I actually forecasted that.
777.12s: But what I obviously didn't know back in December was that we were going to have, you know,
783.56s: the Russian and Vagie Ukraine.
785.44s: So that has probably changed the timing a bit.
789.08s: Not a lot.
790.00s: I was kind of saying we could see the 6,000 S&P by mid-year this year.
796.80s: And that's still possible.
800.20s: I'd say more likely it pushes it out into the summer further.
804.52s: And the, the bust is probably a fourth quarter event.
809.44s: And again, not that it all happened, like people on Twitter will go, well,
814.72s: you're talking about 2023 now.
816.64s: And I said, well, it starts in 2022, but it's a, it's a year-long process.
821.16s: You know, you don't go through a bust, which is a severe economic downturn in a couple months.
826.40s: It's not the market to see economy.
828.32s: So it'll probably start later this year, maybe fourth quarter and carry through at least mid-year
836.28s: next year, maybe much of next year.
838.32s: You know, it's going to be in my opinion, the worst downturn in the post-war war two era.
843.88s: So, you know, worst downturn since great depression, but not a depression,
849.44s: not something that lasts over many, many years, but rather something that probably
854.04s: is contained within about a year.
856.76s: And then the bear market peaks trough to about 80%.
861.40s: Again, we haven't seen anything like that in the post-war war two era.
865.24s: Last time, I think we were down 60 some other percent in 2008,
869.68s: nine.
870.16s: So this is worse than that.
872.52s: And I think a lot of the problems are global, are outside the US.
878.88s: So whereas 2008, nine, our banks were really the ones that took it on the chin and were in the
884.00s: worship.
885.68s: This time around our banks kind of got religion because of what happened in 2008,
889.84s: nine.
890.84s: And the real problems now are more the European banks are in, you know, rough shape,
896.28s: particularly after what's happened in this first quarter of this year with Ukraine.
902.64s: And the Canadian banks are not, you know, they were much more pristine back to 2008,
908.44s: nine.
908.76s: They're more like we were then.
910.56s: They're kind of extended Australia.
913.40s: It's got some issues, their real states through the roof.
918.24s: So you've got, I think lots of banking issues and financial issues that are outside
924.04s: this country.
924.60s: So there's people have to remember, this is, even though my focus is US,
929.64s: this is going to be a global bust.
931.28s: It's not, it's not just the US.
935.48s: Obviously, ton to unpack there.
938.56s: So going into the overall flow of the market kind of this melt up and then a bust from a
946.16s: secular standpoint, what do you think leads to melt up and then what do you think leads the bust?
954.40s: Yeah, the melt up is, I've said for a long time, I believe this is the culmination of a 40 year
962.56s: bearable market.
963.64s: So in August of 1982, the Dow was at 786, maybe.
970.96s: And is now, you know, in the mid 30s.
974.24s: So it had a huge run in the last 40 years, you know, S&P and Dow, and that is the same thing.
981.76s: You know, huge runs driven by the fact that we went from 15% long bond, 15% 10 year, 20% T Bill rates,
991.48s: 20, actually 21% T Bill rates back in the early 80s.
995.68s: And we took it all the way down to last year.
998.28s: We were at 40 basis points on the 10 year and basically zero on short rates.
1004.28s: So that big drop in rates over many decades was the wind at the back of the market
1010.60s: because that just pushed P E multiples price earnings multiples up.
1014.76s: We're at the point now where, you know, not right now, but within the next year,
1019.84s: we're going to probably bottom out rates for the cycle, meaning for the last 40 years.
1025.64s: And P multiples will be going in the opposite directions.
1032.24s: So it's funny.
1033.88s: So yeah, not to throw you off.
1035.68s: Sorry, two of the things you just mentioned, I just had a couple charts, you know,
1039.28s: that I pulled from long term trends.
1041.56s: But anyways, this top one is P ratio, just as you were talking about.
1045.60s: And then this bottom one looks at the S and P 500 index to the total bond return index.
1051.52s: So kind of two, two trends that you were talking about, just visualized here, where we're seeing.
1057.68s: Sorry, go ahead.
1059.08s: Yeah, I said sure.
1060.04s: Yeah, the rates coming down, places stocks higher, all things being equal.
1065.16s: Obviously you have periods of recession where earnings go down.
1069.60s: So even though rates are low, stocks go down.
1073.60s: But overall, it's been a secular bull market since 1982.
1078.28s: I think it comes to an end this year.
1081.40s: And I think the last leg of that bull market will be parabolic.
1087.00s: So you could argue we've been in a parabolic meltup since, you know, 2020,
1093.12s: since the March lows in 2020, it's been a hell of a ride.
1096.80s: It was a doubling in the market off those lows.
1100.68s: But this last leg, which I think begins probably in the next month, will take the S and P up to 6000,
1111.20s: maybe higher than 6000, even, you know, not a lot higher, but it could go higher than that.
1117.20s: And we'll be pretty straight up, you know, it's going to be a very vertical rally.
1120.96s: So as steep as the run has been since March 2020, this last two years,
1127.12s: this last run is going to be steeper.
1129.48s: So I mean, you covered more ground in a shorter time amount of time type of thing.
1134.52s: So it's steeped a little.
1136.04s: And basically, I think it's a little hard for people to understand why when we're staring at a Fed that's talking about,
1144.12s: you know, six or seven hikes this year and pulling money out of the, out of the economy, you know,
1151.44s: shrinking their balance sheet is a little hard for people to grasp why that would be bullish.
1158.24s: And all I can say is history tells you that as the economy slows, and I think we've already done, I keep saying,
1165.36s: that the bond market has done the tightening already.
1169.20s: And by exacting like the Fed is just starting a tightening cycle, I think we're coming to the end of the tightening cycle.
1175.24s: The bond market did it.
1177.00s: Over the course of the last several months, you know, we've got an inverted yield curve can get a little bit more inverted.
1183.88s: But I think given the fragility in the system because of the pandemic and given the leverage in the system that's been building for decades,
1193.32s: I think this economy can can be hurt much faster by rising rates than would be normal.
1201.00s: So in other words, a slightly inverted curve might not have had the same impact.
1206.36s: In the last cycle or the cycle before that, but I think, you know, given what's, you know, the fragility has been built in by the pandemic, that this time around that is enough tightening to really send things negatives.
1222.16s: And I think the surprise may be that we'll see negative GDP in the second quarter.
1227.96s: And that the Fed will look at that and say, hey, maybe, maybe we can't do all these hikes that we're talking about.
1235.16s: The other risk what I'm hearing lately, which I think could be part of the story for the bus is you're hearing the Fed talked about some federal officials anyway talking about, well, maybe we'll pause on rates at some point, you know, a little hike for, you know, a little bit here, but that.
1255.72s: You know, maybe we shouldn't focus on rates, maybe we really need to kind of shrink our balance sheet a little bit bring that back down into a more normal period.
1265.00s: I'm a monetist and I can tell you that's that's the message I would, I would not want to hear.
1273.56s: In terms of that could be what really brings on a bus you pull money out of the system and you're going to see it's you know, for some reason, an awful lot of economists think interest rates are the key.
1285.56s: I think money is the key and if you pull money out, you're going to see it reflected in a much weaker economy.
1292.56s: It's interesting do you think that that might be why Jerome Powell's been messaging so hard around interest rates because you bring up a good point they did bring up, you know, potential tightening of their their spending, but it always seems like that's I wouldn't call it secondary but not the primary focus of their conversations they really seem to be centered on rates.
1313.56s: Do you think that's on purpose to try and like steer the thought process a little bit or just curious what.
1320.56s: I think forever for as long as I've been a fed watcher which goes back to 1973.
1328.56s: Interest rates seem to be the focal point for most economists and for the fed typically and they do they do mess around with balance sheet they do you know they do understand you know pumping money into the system or pulling money out is tightening or easing or tightening.
1346.56s: So that's not new and I don't think he was trying to you know I don't think what we're seeing is anything different just remember we've had a balance sheet grow to nine trillion dollars from you know three point seven trillion back in March 2020 so it's right five trillion dollars and so of course and you know in 2008 October 2008 it was eight hundred seventy five billion.
1376.56s: So we've gone up you know eight trillion dollars from there so we're we're looking at money in in terms of the balance sheet of the fed at levels that nobody could have ever fathomed just a couple of years ago so of course they're saying maybe we need to rain some of that in we get a lot of that because of the pandemic and all the you know the things we were worried about so I think that's normal what they're doing it makes sense.
1406.56s: I just worry that we may find out and I use that word fragility a lot we may find out that the economy is just not resilient enough to withstand even a little bit of that kind of you know typing of money and same thing with rates you know normally when you got inflation
1431.56s: five six seven percent normally you'd expect sea rates pushing five six seven percent to rain it in and I don't think this economy can withstand much beyond where we are so I mean I think that's that's what's different this time and those are dangerous words but I really think we are much more fragile system and fragile means we can unwind much faster and surprisingly and in a surprise
1461.56s: in a way that you know we just don't have precedent for speaking of not having precedent for what do you think about you mentioned it already but I wanted to talk about it explicitly what do you think about just the overall leverage that we see in the markets right now obviously there's a bunch of different metrics out there that tied to the essentially leverage right now being at untold levels before do you think that plays into you know what I'm saying is that the
1490.60s: plays into your rapid meltdown slash bust concept or does it draw things out potentially if they start unwinding earlier and bringing leverage down because we saw a little bit of that too with real margin debt plummeting a ton you know essentially from late 2020 into this year so just curious what the role of leverage in your opinion has into your forecast.
1516.16s: Yeah I mean it's key to my forecast my whole definition of bust comes from the fact that we have as I say my equation is massive leverage plus fragility in the system equals bust I mean you basically you know we're off the charts there's no even 2008 nine didn't have the leverage we have today and I I use leverage I define leverage as two things one
1546.16s: leverage of the economy which is debt you know we've got 300 trillion by the way we've gone from 250 trillion in global debt to 300 trillion in two years we've added 50 trillion because of the pandemic that's a huge jump and well and so we've got 300 trillion in debt and then we've got quite
1567.92s: trillion the national value of derivatives and derivatives are a form of leverage on markets whether they be fixing come markets whether they be equity markets there's so many different derivative products out there and then an awful lot of common party risk etc so what leverage isn't just very much added risk to the system when you have massive leverage to degree we do it's just much higher risk and so I do think
1597.04s: you know in business school you learn that leverage on the way up can enhance returns on the way down it really exacerbates the losses so what I think we'll see is that you're not going to reduce leverage in any meaningful way deliberately
1613.08s: you know margin that's a different story margin that when you know markets correct you know some margin gets you see some turn around in margin because pretty quick you know you get margin calls you get you know that stuff gets liquidated quickly and reduce the margin so you did have a step down
1631.80s: but in the overall debt the way that gets liquidated is involuntarily right down turns so and that's what makes downturn so so bad I mean that's why downturn can turn into something much worse when you've got this kind of leverage on the system so I do think you're going to see a lot of involuntary debt liquidation during this next down cycle
1657.08s: but it won't be unlike a lot of the strategies and economists out there I am not saying this is the high watermark in debt I believe the high watermark in debt will be much higher than we are we're you know we're 300 trillion today in global debt I believe in you know before the end of this decade will probably be closer to 40 or 50 or 500 trillion and the reason I can say that
1687.28s: is because I think the response to the bus
1691.68s: keep in mind I'm talking about major bank failures you know major bank in Europe and wherever else Asian Australia can wherever major bank failures coming at you all at once there's only one tool they have
1705.92s: to deal with that and that is to print money like there's no tomorrow and combined with massive fiscal expansion so you get a lot of what
1717.08s: you saw in March April of 2020 you'll get that times you know what times five times ten so as I know the printers can handle that right my I don't know if anybody can be able to handle this but it's it's the only thing that's the only game in town if they wait if they say okay we're going to we're going to sit and deliberate you know we're going to go to Congress and let them figure this out
1744.28s: system will be bus by the time you get by the time you get some figured out I mean they move pretty fast in March 2020 the Fed certainly did and Congress came along behind them fairly quickly for Congress
1756.52s: yeah but when you got banks failing and and one after another in a domino effect you know I'm time to say let's let's deliberate and figure out what policy makes sense here all you can do is shove money up the door and hope you can stabilize now they'll you know they'll do what they can
1772.68s: declare more Toriums and what have you but it's going to be money times ten I mean you know that's why I say we could see a 30 trillion dollar Fed balance sheet and by the time we get to 2024 it's wild it's I don't that's why I even conceive and so what that does is that just sets you up for you know problems down the road it's not that it fixes anything it just it
1802.36s: postpone the you know the reckoning that so do you think that's the game plane here because again like I think it's always easy to look at what the government in general at large is doing to solve problems in
1817.48s: poke holes and say you know there's a better way to do this here a better way to do that there do you I assume the Fed is wise enough to at least perceive some of the proverbial kicking the
1830.04s: can down the road what do you think their game plan is here is it just to kick the can down the road as long as they can postpone it until the
1837.48s: bust inevitably occurs or do you think they're hoping that there's a solution along the way yeah I think they are doing what they can
1846.04s: within their models I mean they get you know they get data every day and they're looking at you know when they
1851.88s: have their meetings they're looking at dreams of data and they're trying to read the tea leaves like everybody else
1859.08s: like every economist try to figure out what's the path we're on and what do we do to make sure we don't you know fall off that path or you know make things worse so they're they're
1872.84s: legitimately trying to do the right thing I know they have lost credibility with a lot of people and you know there's plenty of critics out there but
1883.00s: frankly if you were in there if you were in polls shoes you you can only do so much I mean you can't say hey let's let's just
1892.36s: throw this model way and start over you can't do it you know as I say if you if you did what the Austrian
1899.64s: school recommends we'd all be living in caves I mean you can't just say let's go on a gold standard or let's do
1906.84s: something to put discipline and system you got to deal with the cards you've been dealt and and the cards we've been
1913.40s: dealt is massive leverage you know an economy that now is showing inflation breaking out etc so what they're what
1922.76s: they're trying to do and they are a consensus building operation you know their committee is you know
1930.44s: they work it's not like one guy dictates it's the whole committee and what they're trying to do is sort
1935.40s: out all of that and say okay how can we kind of bring this down in a way that's not going to disrupt
1943.24s: everything so that's why it's kind of the gradual as you go quarter point hikes maybe a half point
1949.08s: hike here or there you know that's all nice I just don't think it's gonna they're gonna be able to
1955.00s: live that out you know I think ultimately things are gonna change their expectation but they I
1961.64s: have no doubt they are sincerely trying to do things right right by by everybody and they've
1968.04s: got obviously they've got an up balance unemployment or jobs and inflation and right now inflation's
1976.28s: kind of you know and got center court and everybody's paying attention to that and they're they're
1981.96s: hearing from lots of constituencies that you know you've got to fix this inflation so that's kind
1988.76s: of taking precedence a little bit over you know worrying about the economy my my forecast basically
1995.40s: is based on fact that I think within the next few months the economy is going to take precedence again
2001.48s: we're back at it small technical difficulty but we work through it um so conveniently we are
2008.84s: coming up on time here um I definitely don't want to overkeep you got family and that always comes
2014.52s: first so there's two two last things I wanted to talk to you about quickly um the first one is when
2021.08s: I think about your forecast kind of this melt up and bust concept I see a lot of varying strength
2028.76s: and weaknesses across different sectors and I'm curious if there are any sectors in particular that
2035.32s: you think will lead the melt up and if there are any sectors that you think will lead the bust you
2042.04s: mentioned banks financials before but I'm curious if you have any specific thoughts on those
2047.56s: yeah first uh for the melt up I think it's going to be a very broad melt up I know for a lot of
2053.88s: people they've kind of been told and are believing that we're going to see a very narrow market
2060.60s: any any rally it's left as narrow I think we're going to broaden out here so I think a lot of
2065.64s: things are going to play growth is going to play value is going to play at the same time
2070.84s: uh large cap's going to play so a small cap I think the Russell can go to 3000 so that's
2076.44s: you know that's a big move from here um I think you're going to see you know the big cap tech um
2083.32s: you know the fang stocks do quite well I think you're going to see small cap tech you know
2089.80s: the Kathy Wood type stocks do do okay maybe do quite well um I think industrials are going to play
2097.00s: for sure commodities are going to continue to play I think you're going to see some of the early
2101.80s: cycle things like autos and and airlines play uh as we you know focus on the fact that the
2108.36s: economy's reopening and you know this new home of crime string doesn't shutting anything down and
2114.04s: actually we're opening up um so I think it's going to be a broad base the areas that probably will lag
2120.12s: will be defensive so utilities and maybe staples um but otherwise I think the sickles do very well
2129.16s: I love semis I think semis will do very well again it's not straight from here I think we've had a
2134.60s: very nice rally in the last three weeks so you could see um you know a pullback here of you know
2143.08s: five to ten percent depending on the the sector um and uh I think um you know the the summaries
2154.76s: and the fangs will pull back with everything else so um but then on the other side of this once
2162.36s: you get to the top with an eight percent bear market you're going to see an awful lot of things
2169.08s: get hit so it's it's going to be broad based on the other side too I don't know that anything is
2174.60s: going to get hit more so if the whole if the index is going down to eat percent pretty much
2178.76s: everything's going down and going down hard um the the one thing I would say is that you know
2186.60s: tech is so over-owned you know particularly the fangs and the you know the Microsoft's and the big
2192.12s: cap that have been um you know the ownership has been built over many many years I think we're at
2198.28s: the top when we reach this top it's the top of that cycle for those stocks and they will not be
2204.76s: leaders in the next cycle they will be laggards in the next cycle so they're going to get hit hard
2209.72s: in the bust along with everything else the big story of the next cycle is it's going to be an
2214.76s: inflation cycle that will favor value stocks and you know everything from energy I think come it's
2223.16s: a huge commodity cycle so everything from energy to metals to agriculture and the things
2230.76s: will lag will be the winners of this cycle which would be you know your fangs your gross stocks
2237.72s: you know health care those things I think are going to be laggards in the next cycle so just
2242.36s: understand once we go through the bus and the bear market coming out the other side it's a very
2248.44s: different cycle than the one we've just come through huge huge point right there and I think that
2253.64s: that's uh like a very important nuance to your forecast because I think at least most of my
2259.48s: generations the millennials you know we've just seen tech that's really what we're so used to
2264.60s: seeing skyrocket tech goes up and other things sometimes go up so that's uh I think a very
2271.24s: interesting call out there do you think that it's just because they will become so over-value
2275.16s: they won't be attractive anymore what do you think leaves tech to not necessarily participate
2281.16s: that's a great question the real answer to that is the next cycle with inflation going from
2288.20s: basically negative I'm calling for a deflationary bus so as much as inflation's on the
2294.12s: everybody's uh you know it's the talk of the town right now a year from now will be in deflation
2300.52s: in my opinion because of how bad the economy gets hit globally so it will be a short-lived deflationary
2306.68s: cycle but we'll be in deflation and I think the 10 year will be down at zero zero percent 10 year
2313.08s: I think we're peaking right now in the 10 year it's 1.5 could go to 260 but not a lot above that
2319.48s: we'll be at zero in the bottom of the bus from there I expect the 10 year to go to 15% before the
2325.88s: end of the decade 30 year to go to 15% treasury bills to go from negative rates probably in the bus
2333.24s: up to 20 21% that's a real trace of 40 years of declines and rates if you have rates moving up
2341.32s: that dramatically and it's not coming right away but over the course of the decade that's uh as I
2347.56s: said rates coming down was a wind at the back of the market that becomes a wind a headwind
2354.84s: fierce headwind that shrinks P multiples so gross stocks depend on multiple expansion
2361.80s: you know they grow steadily and and what moves them is the expansion in in their P multiples
2368.28s: whereas value stocks, cyclical stocks depend on big earnings spurts you know when the economy gets
2374.04s: going and they're in favor they can have big runs and earnings so you're going to need to be in
2379.24s: stocks that can outpace that big jump in interest rates that's commodities you know I think oil is
2385.56s: going to go from I think oil can fall down into the 30s maybe even into the 20s during the bus
2393.56s: from where we are $100 but in the next cycle before the end of the decade I expect oil to be
2401.64s: at $400 that does a lot to earnings for oil companies so oil companies will have oil companies
2409.72s: will have tremendous earnings that's what can outpace the the bigger jump in rates
2416.84s: you know I expect gold I expect gold to go to 10,000 maybe 20,000 so we're to go to 400
2423.64s: those are the kind of price moves that can outpace inflation you know what what that generates in
2429.40s: terms of earnings is where you're going to make your money if you're in an index fund if you're
2435.96s: in an index fund you know you get you get squeezed because interest rates are going up you know
2445.16s: you're not going to have multiple expansion the reason indexes did so well the reason people could
2450.84s: put their money in an S&P you know back in 1982 and just ride it for 40 years is because interest rates
2457.56s: came down if interest rates reverse and go the other way it works opposite index funds are not
2463.80s: going to be a place to be so the next cycle is going to be you know for a lot of people they're going
2469.16s: to have to learn to understand a different cycle yeah and that leads actually into just a quick
2476.04s: follow on question there do you think things like cryptocurrencies and stuff like that change the
2481.56s: role of gold going forward I see a ton of conversation about that I personally think that there's
2487.88s: still two different things and a lot of people think that cryptocurrency is ready to be like the new
2492.68s: gold I have a hard time conceptualizing that but be curious your thoughts yeah that's certainly a
2499.32s: popular narrative out there I I'm not in that camp either I think gold and silver and the precious
2506.92s: metals will be in favor again in a big way and in a cycle unlike any we've seen and the crypto is
2515.16s: not going to hold them back it was it was you know it was a narrative that fit because gold went
2523.48s: you know peaked out in 2011 it went sideways to down for 10 years more than 10 years so people
2531.16s: were trying to figure out why and you know crypto was doing well so it must be crypto well
2535.72s: that's not that's not my belief I don't think crypto is going to stop the move in the metals
2543.08s: and I think what I've always said I don't follow bitcoins or crypto but what I always say is let's
2550.12s: see how it holds up in the bust you know it's never really been tested in a in a down cycle let's see
2556.12s: what what it does in in that period it's you know it's easy to like it when it's going up we'll see
2562.68s: what happens when I think most of that so it's going to be going down including crypto
2567.96s: the good it's a good point it would be kind of an interesting observation okay one last question
2573.24s: as I promised to get you out of here on time what are you looking at for the rest of 2022 what kind of
2579.56s: things are you keeping a close eye on that inform your analysis of you know your forecast essentially
2588.52s: yeah well center plays a big role in my forecast and right now obviously we've had a 10% run off
2596.84s: the bottom in the in the indexes so short term I think they maybe I headed themselves and you know
2603.56s: we may not be out of the woods in terms of you know the worries about what the fed's going to do
2609.32s: and inflation etc so there's room here in the next two or three weeks it's not a long move but I see
2616.60s: a setup where you could see the s and p down 68% and the Nasdaq down 10% from these levels right here
2625.32s: or close to here but then I do feel that miltapry carries us into the summer maybe through the summer I
2632.84s: don't know but you know something between three and six months is what I kind of expect for the rally
2638.76s: and it to be and like I said it could be 6000 might be 62 or 300 but somewhere in that range
2646.28s: on the s and p and I suspect at that point in time I get told I'm crazy with my miltap call
2654.92s: at that point in time I think I'm going to be told I'm crazy to be talking about the other side
2659.40s: you know there are people are going to be all in you're going to see the the sentiment will have
2664.04s: shifted from you know what it was a month ago you know the sky is falling we're going down we've
2670.28s: seen the top I think at six thousand everybody's going to be telling you how there's many years to run
2676.84s: in this full market you got to get in and that'll be a sign of a top I think if everybody's bullish
2683.72s: be a contrairion and look the other way and and then I think the unwind will be something to be
2692.28s: hold I mean I think you know 2008-09 is not that far behind us that is not fresh in some people's minds
2699.64s: anyway I think this is going to be worse well as always it's an absolute pleasure you know chatting with
2708.28s: you I think the the experience and the perspective you bring is really refreshing it's enlightening to
2713.56s: hear so thank you very much for taking some time to to share your wisdom with us and obviously
2719.64s: looking forward to chat with you again in the future and for anybody that's interested you can
2724.60s: find David on Twitter I'll throw the link to his profile in the video description below there are
2732.04s: a bunch of Dave imposter's out there so make sure you pay attention to the to the handle I give you
2738.04s: which will be the correct one and yeah unless there's anything else you got I pleasure chatting with you
2743.72s: yeah let me just reempsize that because thanks for mentioning that because I
2748.28s: of late there have been I think probably a couple dozen imposter's and they just change one letter
2754.84s: in it might be contrairions spelled wrong or they add a letter or they do something
2762.12s: make sure you're at Dave H. contrairions spelled correctly because it is easy to get tripped up
2770.52s: the other things I've got 165,000 followers these imposter typically you'll see they have
2776.52s: you know hundreds of followers or or follow hundreds of people not thousands and so you should be
2781.88s: able to discern that but I've seen enough people that will DM me and say you know I heard from you
2790.36s: you told me you have a service on you know on telegram and I go I'm not on telegram so these
2796.76s: guys are trying to take your money be very aware that there are these guys out there trying to scam
2802.20s: people so you know it as long as you keep your eyes open and look for Dave H. contrairions shouldn't
2808.12s: have any problem you know separating me out but just they have my profile picture so it can
2813.40s: fool you it looks like it's me it's not yeah thank you and like I said I'll make sure I get the
2818.84s: the you know obviously your right profile and there's everybody should be good fun and fun in the
2822.76s: way over to you but otherwise absolute pleasure thanks for chatting okay thanks sir if you take
2828.20s: care take care
