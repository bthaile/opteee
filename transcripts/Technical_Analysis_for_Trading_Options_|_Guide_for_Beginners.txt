0.12s: systematic technical analysis this is
2.16s: going to be a two-part series that walks
4.40s: you through exactly how I've developed
6.64s: my approach to using technical analysis
9.20s: when trading options for the past 16
11.48s: years I really emphasize finding things
14.60s: that are simple yet effective and the
17.60s: first video here is going to walk you
19.08s: through my methodology for technical
21.40s: analysis and then the tools that I use
23.68s: and then the second video is going to
25.12s: walk you through the process I employ
27.56s: with some examples and best practices my
30.16s: goal for these two videos is to really
32.36s: give you a sense on how I use TA in my
35.48s: trading I know there are some
36.76s: evangelists out there that think ta can
38.84s: perfectly predict the future I'm not one
40.88s: of them I know there's also people out
42.52s: there that think it's complete Voodoo
44.20s: not one of them either I find myself in
46.04s: the middle of the road where I find it
47.60s: useful in helping me determine
49.32s: probabilistic outcomes so that I can
51.76s: make better informed decisions so what's
54.76s: up everybody Eric here welcome back to
56.56s: all the outliers and a shout out to the
58.32s: patreon family you guys make editing
61.00s: like this possible which makes the
62.76s: videos more fun for everybody so if what
64.44s: I do helps you in any way consider
67.16s: signing up it helps me make better
69.04s: content for you so let's take a look at
71.60s: what we have first methodology so really
75.20s: what I want to talk about here are a
77.08s: handful of Concepts that really guide my
79.40s: Approach when it comes to technical
80.96s: analysis the first one is it has to be
82.72s: efficient you can spend way too much
84.92s: time getting into the weeds even trying
86.68s: to learn individual Candlestick patterns
89.56s: and stuff like that and that's not me I
91.92s: don't think that's a great return on the
93.32s: time especially compared to the
95.00s: literally thousands of hours of research
97.44s: I've put into comparing how effective
100.80s: these different tools are in helping me
102.64s: determine Direction so I'm looking at
105.60s: what gives me the best bang for the buck
108.08s: what things allow me to look at over
111.16s: 5,000 products and quickly distill it
114.04s: down into something that is a usable
116.48s: list for me to then get more in depth
119.36s: applicable is really important this
120.88s: might not jump out to you as an
122.28s: important point up front but making sure
124.36s: that the analysis we're applying is
127.00s: appropriate for what we're analyzing so
129.08s: for example if I'm trading a one-year
131.28s: thesis the intraday charts really don't
134.40s: matter at all so it's making sure that
137.32s: whatever analysis we're employing aligns
140.52s: with the broader thesis that we're
142.12s: exploring and that takes a little bit of
143.96s: time I still use the same tools I just
146.96s: adjust what I'm looking at so that it
149.28s: applies
150.28s: context first and then Precision I use
153.12s: technical analysis to help me understand
155.20s: the broad stock market because here's
156.96s: the deal technical analysis is based on
159.16s: two things price and volume and no
162.04s: matter what price and volume are the
164.16s: ultimate things that matter to us as
166.40s: Traders that's what determines Direction
169.08s: price and volume so understanding the
171.44s: broad markets behavior in that context
175.32s: and then using technical analysis to
177.20s: help me really pinpoint specific areas
179.32s: of interest it helps me formulate where
181.36s: I want my profit and loss targets to be
183.56s: things like that so it's going to start
185.00s: zoomed out and then it's going to zoom
187.16s: in over time to help me get really
189.60s: detailed another quick note on this
191.56s: concept of price and volume it's that
194.44s: markets inherently are not purely
197.00s: rational however investor behavior is
199.52s: still captured in price and volume so
201.60s: it's one of the few tools we can use
204.24s: that allows us to truly understand
205.84s: what's going on in the markets outside
207.64s: of the theoretical understanding of
209.40s: people being rational actors because
211.44s: markets are not always rational it's
213.04s: because human beings are emotional we've
214.56s: already talked about this idea of
215.72s: multiple time frames so I'll skip over
217.20s: that for now when I'm going through my
219.28s: technical analysis tools I have a subset
221.56s: of tools that allow me to analyze a few
223.84s: different things which we'll get into in
225.16s: just a second and I'm looking for a
226.68s: Confluence of evidence what that means
228.32s: is if I see moving averages moving in
230.36s: one way and then a momentum indicator
232.52s: moving in another way and volume
234.16s: behaving a certain way I'm not
235.88s: necessarily going to look at any one of
237.60s: those as the end all Beall of my thought
239.40s: process process each one of them comes
241.64s: together to form a picture so I'm
243.76s: looking to create an entire Vision using
246.96s: all of these different tools that
248.52s: analyze different aspects of technical
250.88s: analysis so that I can then apply a
252.76s: decision so it's important to think of
255.32s: this as a individual system then leads
258.88s: into a total process the entire concept
262.32s: when we're going through any sort of
264.24s: analysis is these two things right here
266.80s: we're looking for nose and trades have
269.36s: to to earn your money what does this
270.88s: mean what is looking for a no I think
273.12s: one of the defining features for
275.44s: unsuccessful retail Traders is as
277.84s: they're looking for trades they're
279.48s: looking for reasons to say yes they're
282.16s: trying to coax themselves into the trade
285.16s: whereas I find more successful Traders
288.20s: were typically saying no 98% of the time
292.04s: I'm saying no and then I'm finding that
294.64s: smaller subset of occurrences that looks
297.12s: so appealing to me that I can't say no
300.24s: it makes too much sense in terms of a
302.32s: risk to reward profile for me to turn it
304.72s: down that shift in your mindset I think
307.56s: is really important because it moves us
309.40s: from forcing trades into finding really
312.52s: great trades now let's get into the
315.84s: tools this should be pretty
318.32s: straightforward for most people if
319.88s: you've ever looked at my charts but I
321.60s: want to look at the tool and then I want
323.36s: to show you it on the chart quickly so
325.20s: first things first we have moving
326.72s: averages we have a long-term moving
329.12s: average which is the 200 or the 150 then
331.40s: we kind of have a mid longterm which is
333.12s: like a 50-day and then two shorter term
335.44s: moving averages a 21 and a 9 these
338.08s: numbers change slightly you can Tinker
340.20s: with different variations as you could
341.72s: tell I tend to move between these the 50
344.44s: is almost always on the chart and then
346.40s: these sometimes change sometimes I use
348.24s: an 11 sometimes I use a seven sometimes
350.56s: I use 22 instead of 21 you can play with
353.12s: these numbers a little bit it doesn't
354.44s: make that big of a difference these are
355.96s: what I found to generally work and
358.04s: there's a handful of things that matter
359.84s: to me as I'm looking through these but I
361.96s: want to really emphasize this point to
363.84s: you as we go through all of these
365.76s: different indicators there are a handful
367.48s: of traits that I'm going to apply the
369.96s: first is multiple time frames so I'm not
372.16s: going to look at moving averages just in
374.48s: a vacuum I'm going to look at them
376.20s: across different time frames just like
378.04s: all of these it helps me gain context
380.68s: first and then Precision scale velocity
384.16s: durations the relationships all of these
386.92s: things matter to me so I'm not just
389.08s: looking
389.92s: at the moving averages and saying oh
392.76s: here is a 9-day moving average below the
395.52s: 21-day I'm looking at what's the width
398.12s: between these two what's that
399.72s: relationship doing what's the steepness
402.44s: of these moving averages understanding
404.20s: how they behave so for example 9-day
406.32s: moving averages they're going to move
408.04s: pretty voraciously because it's not
409.80s: using a lot of data however if we look
411.84s: at something like a 200 day moving
413.52s: average notice how it doesn't really
415.56s: move quite that much but then when I see
417.72s: it picking up this kind of slope this is
420.48s: massive in relation to how this moving
422.88s: average typically looks so part of is
424.76s: you have to develop a relationship with
426.40s: the different tools you use so for me
428.12s: I'm going to use moving averages across
429.60s: those time frames I'm looking for the
431.16s: width between them that indicates
433.00s: strength just as slope how steep is the
435.40s: slope I'm looking for orientation is the
438.08s: 9 above the 21 above the 50 above the
441.96s: 200 with price above the M if that's the
444.20s: case that's pretty dang bullish in terms
445.80s: of moving averages then you can take a
447.88s: look at short-term crossovers like the 9
450.12s: below the 21 or the 9 above the 21 you
452.84s: can see how that all looks in relation
454.68s: to longer term moving averages all of
456.80s: these things matter now I'll leave you
458.64s: to Tinker with this to find specifics
460.48s: that work for you but for me I really
462.64s: want to understand what the slope is
464.96s: what the relationship is between them
466.72s: and where is price in relation to them
469.20s: that really matters to me and then
471.08s: depending on the duration of the trade I
473.36s: use different crossovers for different
475.20s: things because if you'll notice if you
477.04s: use let's say for example a 50-day cross
479.40s: in below the 200 day that's going to be
481.12s: a much slower indicator because there's
483.64s: a lot more data integrated into it if
485.80s: you're trading a really short-term
487.28s: strategy this might not align well with
489.08s: you so you have to figure out what time
490.80s: frames matter most for the individual
492.48s: strategy you're applying next up linear
494.44s: aggression channels 50 and 100 so these
497.72s: are the kind of these gray lines in the
499.48s: background this gray line here is the 50
501.48s: this one is the 100 the 50 encompasses
504.04s: 50% of the moves on the chart in the
505.92s: aggregation period the 100% encompasses
508.48s: 100% of them you can view these kind of
510.64s: like standard deviation Channels with
512.24s: this being a plus one - one plus 2 -2
514.64s: it's not perfect slight difference but
516.40s: it typically will operate so I'm looking
518.72s: at two things primarily the first thing
521.08s: what is the trend are we positive
523.56s: sloping are we flats are we negative
525.60s: sloping so as I look at iwm on a
527.64s: one-year daily this is positive sloping
529.76s: maybe if we come into a six-month daily
531.64s: we see it still positively sloping then
533.52s: if we come into a 3-month daily we see
535.40s: it negatively sloping so you can see as
537.36s: you look at different time frames you're
538.56s: going to see slight different things the
540.20s: first one I'm looking for is the overall
541.76s: direction the second thing I'm looking
543.32s: for is price extension most price is
545.92s: going to fall within this inner band the
548.44s: 50% band when I see price starting to
551.12s: get strung out to these outsides it can
554.08s: tell me that we're looking a bit
555.48s: overextended does it mean that it can't
557.60s: go past it further no it certainly can
560.08s: but I'm looking at technical analysis in
562.20s: terms of probabilistic outcomes so if I
564.08s: see something hovering near an extreme I
566.80s: tend to think we might see some sort of
568.72s: reversion provided that we see other
570.84s: support for it so in this case linear
572.48s: aggression channel is upward sloping
574.28s: however we get up near a plus two linear
576.56s: aggression Channel which is near-term
578.12s: resistance price balls flow the 99 day
581.44s: moving average and so on and so forth so
583.44s: you can kind of paint a picture for
585.16s: yourself now back to moving averages
587.08s: really quick in terms of simple moving
589.20s: averages exponential moving averages
591.20s: volume weighted moving averages you can
592.96s: Tinker with all of them I I've studied
595.60s: all of these in depth and I genuinely do
598.72s: not think think there's a giant
600.04s: difference between them I think it
601.36s: doesn't matter what I like to do is for
603.08s: the short-term moving averages I use
604.96s: Simple moving averages because they
607.36s: already have enough sensitivity to
608.84s: current price and for the longer term
610.48s: moving averages I like to use
611.96s: exponentials sometimes because it helps
614.56s: me become a little more sensitive to
616.04s: current prices with the longer term
617.28s: moving average again you could use SMA
619.44s: for all of them so Mas linear regression
621.68s: channels next we have volume profile
623.36s: average volume if you'll recall the two
625.32s: things we care about is price and volume
626.96s: so the volume profile tells us where
629.40s: transactions have occurred in the
631.20s: highest frequency this gives us an idea
633.16s: of support and resistance inherently so
635.08s: so what this means is where we see the
636.64s: most transactions that tends to serve as
639.20s: support than resistance resistance than
641.16s: support depending on where price is
642.52s: around it so for example the point of
644.84s: control which is where the most
646.16s: transactions occurred in that
647.64s: aggregation period that happened right
649.52s: here around like 184 something like that
652.56s: notice how when price came down to it it
654.48s: bounced around here for quite a while
656.36s: that's because there's a lot of people
657.64s: willing to buy here then it bounced up
659.40s: and out came back down now it fell below
661.72s: so this tells me that if it comes back
664.00s: up to this point there's probably going
665.80s: to be a good bit of resistance there
667.88s: because there's a lot of people that
669.04s: might be wanting to get out that bought
670.96s: here they have a chance to get out for a
672.68s: scratch and they might want to exit the
674.60s: trade the other thing I use them for is
676.52s: kind of these shelves these nodes so you
678.80s: notice how when price fell below the
680.52s: point of control notice how there's no
682.12s: gray area here that tells me that there
683.76s: was not a lot of transactions at this
685.44s: point and notice how easily price fell
687.68s: below until it started getting to these
689.72s: other nodes and now price is starting to
692.00s: congest out again so when you see nodes
693.96s: like this it just means that again
695.36s: there's people willing to transact there
697.00s: and when you look at these big gaps
698.80s: those to me look like areas that we can
700.52s: move quickly around whether it's up
703.08s: through them to the bullish side whether
704.60s: it's down below them and again it's
706.40s: really important to look at different
707.60s: time frames because if we look at a
709.08s: one-year daily this note is still there
711.32s: it's just not the point of control the
712.76s: point of control is actually down here
714.32s: and if you'll notice price happened to
716.20s: bounce right around it so this tells me
718.64s: that there there's a lot of people
719.76s: willing to buy here and again on both of
722.12s: those two time frames we looked at
723.44s: there's a big gap here there's not a lot
725.56s: of people transacting at that price so
727.64s: that just kind of doubles down that
729.28s: thesis that we might see movement
731.44s: quickly through this Zone where there's
733.08s: not a lot of transactions occurring Now
735.04s: volume average is really just for
736.96s: context and it helps me understand
738.76s: breakouts and breakdowns the thing to
741.00s: know about price is that it can fall
743.88s: under its own weight it doesn't need a
745.96s: lot of transactions to fall fast in
748.20s: order to raise and kind of bounce
750.52s: through resistance or to have an
752.16s: extended up move it needs outsized
754.68s: volume so what I like to do is use a
756.44s: volume average this purple line is a
758.48s: 30-day volume average and you can see
761.04s: I'm wanting to use kind of a shorter
763.36s: term time frame which is 30 days you can
764.96s: use longer term 50 days depending on you
767.20s: know the duration that you're looking to
768.44s: trade but I'm looking for anomalies I
770.32s: want to see periods where if we're
772.16s: rallying and volume is really low like
775.08s: this case here I'm I don't really trust
777.40s: that that much that's really what what
778.96s: that means to me if we're rallying and
781.00s: we see outsized volume like this I'm
783.56s: more interested especially if there's
785.24s: multiple days with extended volume to
787.76s: the upside like these two days here if
789.68s: you look at this transaction these three
791.80s: days we had a red day here then two
794.00s: green days but on all three of these
796.16s: there was a lot of volume so that gives
798.40s: me an idea that there could be some
800.28s: support at this level cuz there's a lot
801.68s: of people looking to transact then if
803.36s: you look back at the point of control
805.08s: that we saw on a longer term time frame
806.76s: that confirms that we know a lot of
807.96s: people are looking to transact here so
809.72s: you again you can see how we paint a
811.20s: picture using these things remember
813.20s: stock can fall under its own weight so
815.52s: if it starts dropping on less impressive
818.12s: volume that doesn't mean anything now if
819.84s: it starts dropping and it has impressive
822.48s: volume that means there's a lot of
823.88s: people selling a lot of people selling
825.84s: so you can also add that to your toolkit
827.88s: next support resistance Trends this is a
831.00s: visual representation of support and
833.20s: resistance which again I'm kind of
834.64s: getting from these volume profiles and
836.20s: moving averages anyways but I like to
838.88s: use different trends for different time
840.84s: frames so if you notice if I go out here
842.36s: to like a 2-year I have this pretty
844.32s: long-term Channel plotted out and then I
847.20s: also have these price levels at
849.36s: interesting points where there was a lot
850.72s: of transactions the way to think about
852.88s: support and resistance is you're looking
854.44s: for congestion look you're looking for
856.64s: areas where price has moved around a lot
859.36s: and also remember the more recent the
862.20s: time frame is that you're looking at the
864.44s: more powerful that that support and
867.28s: resistance area is the more relevant it
869.32s: is so if we see some sort of support and
871.56s: resistance here like this is a great
872.92s: example this section right above my head
874.92s: this will serve as near term resistance
877.48s: whenever we get back up here and if we
879.24s: get back up there quickly this is very
881.16s: recent so this would be kind of powerful
883.52s: especially because the number of touches
885.44s: or transactions in a very congested area
888.16s: that tends to amplify the strength of
890.88s: whatever indicator you're looking at so
893.24s: if you're looking at really old charts
895.64s: like something like a three-year weekly
897.24s: and there's a bunch of you know
898.72s: congestion up here it may or may not be
901.48s: relevant in this case I think it would
903.04s: be just because there's a lot of people
904.44s: bag holding right now but the point
906.40s: being is when we're looking at these
908.04s: different areas using support resistance
910.20s: I'm looking for where's congestion and
912.08s: then when I'm evaluating it the more
914.00s: recent the congestion is the more
915.96s: interested I am in it I don't I'm not
918.68s: that passionate about these breakdowns
920.68s: like you could see it fell below this
922.64s: longer term Trend and it was okay it
924.44s: came back up it's more for context that
927.00s: I put these like if it dropped down and
928.80s: it really shot down below it then I
930.72s: would just view this as potentially
932.56s: resistance but not so much for the trend
934.48s: lines it's more these price levels that
935.84s: are horizontal that are showing me where
937.64s: there's congestion of um transactions an
940.24s: oscillator this is like a secondary
942.00s: indicator for me so I use the money flow
944.12s: index or volume weighted moving average
946.00s: convergence Divergence the money flow
947.64s: index is kind of like a volume weighted
949.20s: RSI but you can use it to help with
951.84s: pinpoint timing things like that the
953.76s: main thing I would talk to you about
955.12s: using these is one seeing if they're
957.36s: flattening out and if if price starts to
959.92s: flatten out Beyond it that's interesting
961.84s: to me I also am interested not so much
964.44s: if it gets overextended undere extended
966.36s: I'm less concerned with that but if
968.44s: there's Divergence so if price is
970.64s: rallying and this is going down that
973.40s: tells me that the rally is suspicious or
976.68s: if we see price starting to shoot up and
978.72s: out and this was negative trending for a
980.96s: while that tells me that I would expect
982.76s: this to start turning up and if it
984.80s: doesn't again I would be suspicious so
987.04s: it's just kind of like a tertiary
988.64s: indicator to me breath allows me to look
991.56s: at the market as a whole so slightly
993.76s: different than all these ta tools breath
996.04s: like net highs and lows that gives me a
998.20s: sense of the total market and net highs
1000.24s: and lows is down here so this is looking
1002.00s: for the New York Stock Exchange and it's
1003.56s: telling me exactly that net highs and
1005.04s: lows how many stocks are making highs
1007.52s: compared to those to those making lows
1009.92s: and typically when we're bullish you'll
1011.88s: see net highs being very positive same
1014.40s: thing when we're going down you'll see
1016.60s: net highs lows being quite negative so
1018.44s: so it's almost like uh macd if you're
1020.36s: used to those but this is for the whole
1022.16s: stock market this is looking at
1023.28s: everything in the New York Stock
1024.32s: Exchange and I like to add two moving
1026.76s: averages I have a 10day and a 50-day
1028.68s: this is all just think scripts that I've
1030.28s: made but the whole idea here is to get a
1032.60s: sense on what the market is doing as a
1035.16s: whole so as this sits at the bottom of
1037.12s: my chart this is not tied to whatever
1039.40s: I'm looking at this is always tied to
1041.48s: the entire New York Stock Exchange and
1043.60s: again looking at this in multiple time
1045.20s: frames is really important because you
1046.60s: can see this period here looks really
1048.48s: big really interesting like wow that's a
1050.60s: lot of net highs in this time frame but
1054.04s: if we zoom out to kind of like a weekly
1055.96s: time frame you notice how lame it
1057.84s: actually looks compared to something
1059.28s: like you see back here so getting that
1061.20s: context is really important when using
1063.28s: something like net highs and lows but
1065.24s: this is a big important indicator for me
1067.08s: because when I see this kind of
1068.80s: consolidation I'm not looking to get
1070.36s: really along the market here RIT large
1072.56s: I'm looking to get that Confluence of
1075.12s: evidence if I'm bullish I want as many
1078.04s: of the these things to look bullish to
1079.64s: me as humanly possible which we'll get
1081.44s: more into in the next video on how I
1083.92s: overlay all of these together but it's a
1086.08s: good reminder and then the last one here
1087.68s: is the IV HV plot this one's super
1090.12s: simple this one is really for those
1092.28s: options Traders out there and it's a way
1093.88s: for me to visualize implied and historic
1096.68s: volatility that's all so if you're not
1098.80s: an options Trader this will mean nothing
1100.24s: to you but if you are an options Trader
1102.52s: I am making sure that in general I want
1105.24s: to see implied trending over historic
1108.52s: because that's where variance risk
1109.68s: premiums are and that's typically how
1111.36s: they will be priced and I use this a lot
1113.36s: during earnings I use this a lot if I'm
1115.68s: trading any sort of Varian premium
1117.72s: capture strategy but the idea here is to
1120.04s: give me a better understanding of the
1122.24s: gap between implied and historic moves
1125.16s: that's additionally important context
1127.60s: specifically when you're trading options
1129.28s: and volatility strategies so that's
1131.92s: mostly it some of these tools change
1134.08s: sometimes I add some sometimes I remove
1135.96s: some it's a slightly breathing list but
1138.12s: in General you're always going to see
1139.88s: the Mas and you're going to see the
1141.68s: regression channels you're going to see
1142.88s: the volume average profiles support and
1144.76s: resistance oscillators sometimes less
1146.84s: weighted the breath will always be there
1148.80s: so these are kind of the heart and soul
1150.64s: of what I do I tinker with a lot of
1152.68s: different tools but I have hands down
1154.72s: the highest efficacy with these now your
1157.16s: challenge is in your own trading figure
1160.20s: out what tools you like to use ideally
1162.40s: it's not a huge list and then track how
1165.40s: well you can determine Direction open up
1167.56s: an Excel sheet list out a bunch of
1169.32s: random stocks apply your technical
1171.48s: analysis in the columns list out the
1173.84s: different analysis you're performing
1175.40s: with the different moving averages if
1176.84s: you're using volume profile so on and so
1178.76s: forth and then at the end list out
1180.76s: whether or not you're bullish bearish or
1182.40s: you're neutral and then track how you do
1184.60s: that will help you so much with
1187.08s: identifying what works and what doesn't
1188.64s: work for your specific style of trading
1190.44s: it's massive cannot emphasize that
1192.40s: enough so the next video we're going to
1194.32s: go into the actual process how I put all
1196.44s: of this together to look at things
1198.52s: efficiently with a pretty high degree of
1200.28s: accuracy as always if there's any
1202.36s: questions throw them in the show notes
1204.80s: below and I'm happy to take a look I try
1206.68s: to answer all of them when they pop up
1209.12s: if there's anything I left out also let
1210.96s: me know don't forget to like subscribe
1212.88s: share the video so we can get some more
1214.96s: views on these things huh and uh be an
1217.12s: outlier and see you guys later
