0.08s: beta waiting explain I'm going to walk
1.76s: you through exactly what this metric is
3.64s: and why you should care about it because
5.32s: this is one of the few things in trading
7.00s: where one tool can provide a ton of
10.40s: great information and it's super simple
12.44s: to access so I'm going to walk you
14.04s: through exactly what it is how it's
15.64s: calculated how you can use it and then
17.32s: some best practices at the end of the
19.12s: video so what's up everybody Eric here
21.52s: welcome back to all the outliers and a
23.04s: shout out to the patreon family because
24.84s: you guys make content like this possible
26.72s: for everybody so if what I do helps you
28.36s: consider signing up it helps me a lot
30.44s: let's talk about what beta waiting is
32.36s: and I'm going to get my face out of the
33.64s: way because I caught a little too much
35.60s: sun this past weekend playing some sick
37.60s: pickle ball and I'm burnt so not much to
40.96s: look at not that I'm typically much to
42.72s: look at but let's look at this we have a
45.04s: portfolio inside this portfolio we have
47.32s: all different kinds of positions I'm not
48.68s: going to run through them all but you
50.04s: could see that we're short calls short
51.72s: straddles long calls all different kinds
53.96s: of things so if we think about this
56.32s: portfolio how do we answer some simple
58.56s: questions like if the broad Market using
61.64s: spy in this example goes up 10 points
63.92s: what happens to our portfolio how is
65.56s: that going to behave you don't really
67.16s: know that's one of the things we can use
68.88s: beta weight at Delta for the other thing
70.76s: is with all of these different positions
72.32s: on you probably know you know in
74.72s: aggregate how much money you have out at
76.88s: a given point in time but what's the
78.36s: notional value of the risk also don't
80.76s: know that but beta waiting Deltas will
82.96s: help you understand that so let's take a
85.44s: look now at what these raw Deltas are
88.52s: and then we'll get into beta waiting
89.72s: them what's a raw Delta it's just
91.48s: whatever you get from the options chain
93.32s: now to be very clear stock can also have
96.80s: and has Delta so if we take a look at
99.36s: this example down here where we're long
101.12s: 500 shares of AMC that's long 500 Deltas
104.72s: but I kind of combine this one because
106.56s: it's a covered call and we have short
108.52s: two calls against it so that takes our
110.28s: Deltas down a little bit that kind of
111.68s: thing but these are just raw deltas and
113.80s: why is this metric not good enough well
116.20s: because it's a little misleading in this
118.16s: case if we take a look at this long long
120.12s: deep in the money calls in vix I didn't
122.52s: put any specific trade details but I'm
124.48s: just pretending that these are plus 180
126.96s: Deltas these are approximates these
128.84s: aren't directly pulled from anything but
130.56s: they're pretty close to give you a good
131.72s: idea but in this case we have something
133.64s: that's long Deltas however vix is
136.64s: typically inversely correlated to the
138.56s: stock market so as you see in a second
140.32s: this metric actually looks quite a bit
141.92s: different when it's put into the
143.24s: language of beta waiting Deltas so let's
145.56s: do exactly that I'm going to slide up
147.28s: out of your way so in The Thinker swim
149.44s: platform this is super easy to do if you
151.20s: don't use thinker swim I have no idea if
152.96s: your platform has it a lot of them do
154.80s: this is nothing novel most account
157.08s: managers use this tool because it's very
158.76s: simple but if you do use thinker swim
160.84s: there's just this little thing under
162.36s: monitor activity and positions position
164.52s: statement there's a little box you could
166.16s: tick for beta waiting and then you just
168.44s: type in whatever you want to Beta weight
170.36s: against that's one of the cool things
171.68s: about beta waiting actually is that you
173.56s: don't have to use spy you could beta
175.56s: weit against whatever the hell you want
177.08s: it just kind of makes the most sense to
178.56s: use spy typically from most people or
180.48s: SPX or just some sort of broad market
182.44s: index but you can also use vix you could
184.40s: use a volatility product and what this
186.52s: is doing is taking all of these
189.20s: positions and it's putting them into a
191.24s: common language that language is how
194.04s: many shares of spy or whatever you're
196.84s: beta waiting against does this position
198.88s: represent so if we look at these two
200.40s: short calls in xlu they're - 60 Deltas
203.28s: by themselves but if you beta waight
205.04s: them to the Spy they're only -20 so what
207.64s: is this -20 again this means that this
209.84s: is going to behave like negative short
212.32s: 20 shares of spy and then so on down
215.20s: this list so if you take a look at that
216.88s: vix trade that I was kind of
218.28s: highlighting before and you see that's
219.80s: actually plus 180 Deltas but then when
222.36s: we beta weight it to the Spy it's
223.60s: actually -200 Deltas so in this case
227.08s: again this means that this is pretending
229.24s: this is essentially the same thing at
231.80s: this point in time as short 200 shares
234.32s: of spy notice how I said at this point
236.84s: in time it's a really important note
238.84s: because as the market moves as the value
241.76s: of spy moves as these Deltas move all of
245.12s: these things change so these are pretty
247.20s: regularly updating figures they're just
249.36s: static obviously in the snapshot so now
251.84s: I want to walk you through those other
253.08s: two things I was talking to about the
254.48s: notional value and the p&l now you'll
256.84s: notice how beta weighted spy Deltas we
259.12s: you know have the each individual
260.92s: position so you can beta weight all of
262.48s: them but then you can also summarize
265.24s: them you could do totals so right now
268.04s: our portfolio is behaving like 300
271.12s: shares of spy so with that information
273.96s: you should already be able to calculate
276.60s: the answer to this question over here
278.84s: but if you can't don't worry the only
280.92s: piece you need for this is whatever spy
283.00s: currently is trading at and in this
284.36s: example I'm going to use
285.68s: $430 so you can with that detail you can
289.56s: answer essentially this you can answer
292.16s: this and you can answer this but if
293.72s: you're unfamiliar with it let's talk
295.04s: about it so when we look at something
296.92s: like notional value all we're going to
299.40s: do is take the beta weighted deltas and
302.32s: then we're going to multiply that by the
303.68s: current price of spy so in this case
305.92s: like I said I'm going to use spy at
308.32s: $430 and these are the notional values
311.76s: for each of these trades and then in the
313.84s: aggregate so again you can either do the
317.36s: math for each individual position which
319.80s: you know again your platform typically
321.12s: will do this for you so you can get a
322.56s: view of each individual position but
324.44s: then you can also look at the aggregate
326.76s: this is so useful because one you get
330.24s: One-Stop shop for your overall portfolio
332.88s: metrics and to be clear once you beta
334.96s: weight against the Spy you can get beta
337.64s: weighted Deltas you can get beta
339.36s: weighted all different kinds of metrics
341.64s: that help you understand the disposition
343.20s: of your portfolio what do I mean by that
345.52s: you can also beta weight things like
347.00s: your gamma now things like Theta and
349.16s: Vega don't matter if you beta weight
350.92s: them you're not going to see them change
352.32s: because it doesn't matter what they're
353.76s: ranked against they are what they are
355.92s: but those two things specifically and a
357.52s: bunch of others you can bait we but I
358.92s: want to focus on Deltas here so as you
360.92s: can see we can see the overall value of
363.36s: each of these positions so one of the
364.80s: things we should be doing as we're
366.12s: seeing this is do any of these positions
368.24s: strike you as odd his eyes seem to be a
371.20s: little bit odd don't they and again this
373.72s: is all going to be completely predicated
375.88s: on your risk tolerance and the way you
377.92s: like to structure your portfolio but the
379.64s: first thing that I see is this is a
381.44s: giant position in Northrup Grumman this
384.00s: position down here by itself is
385.88s: $193,500 whereas the rest is kind of 20,
389.44s: 000 this one is essentially flat if you
391.72s: look at them side by side but if you
393.56s: look at them individually they're
394.56s: $10,000 trades this one is also pretty
396.88s: big at $86,000 but this is double that
399.56s: so this is a big trade and I can tell
401.80s: you right out of the gate that's
403.52s: something that interests me this is how
405.20s: you use beta weighted Deltas to get one
408.36s: an understanding of your entire
409.72s: portfolio but then the individual
411.28s: positions within it so that's just one
412.92s: thing that jumps out to me maybe you
414.20s: really like North or grman and you want
415.76s: that position cool that's totally fine
417.44s: but if you look at this you're like oh
418.76s:  this that way bigger than all of
420.56s: these other ones because if you take for
422.16s: example these AMC versus North R Grumman
424.80s: positions they have essentially the same
426.60s: raw Deltas the AMC covered calls 440 the
429.64s: northr gring calls are 400 but when you
431.80s: beta weight them it's massive difference
433.56s: so that's the kind of thing we can use
435.56s: now if you hadn't already let's take a
438.28s: look at how we do the math here to
440.32s: figure out how our p&l moves based on
444.44s: movements in the S&P 500 so in this case
447.20s: again you should be able to do this math
448.64s: before I show you the numbers so you can
450.36s: pause the video run through do the math
451.88s: real quick and then here are your
453.80s: answers so I just did it for the S&P 500
456.16s: at $440 again you can do the same exact
459.12s: thing with it at $430 but this is the
461.28s: same process what we're looking at is
463.60s: whatever the Delta is in spy meaning the
466.00s: change that can be a little confusing
467.80s: when you talk about Delta in terms of
469.44s: change versus delta in terms of
471.28s: representation of um an options product
474.36s: but in this case I was referring to it
476.04s: as in change that's why I kind of
477.24s: purposely use change here so if we use
478.96s: the price price change in spy so again
480.84s: going from $430 to $440 that's $10 so
484.76s: we're saying spy change by $10 then we
487.20s: need to multiply our beta weighted
489.32s: Deltas by whatever that changes so in
491.44s: this case I'm taking 20 beta weighted
493.96s: deltas and then I'm multiplying it by
495.92s: the change here which is 10 that gives
497.88s: you your -200 and then you can do that
500.16s: all the way down now again this is in a
502.92s: vacuum because volatility is going to
505.20s: change the Deltas on things are going to
507.16s: change so it's very rarely going to be
509.56s: this neat math where you see spy move
512.00s: $10 and none of these other things
514.08s: change but this is just to give you an
515.64s: idea of how this broadly works because
517.80s: roundabout this is what you would see
519.76s: again barring massive other changes in
521.52s: volatility or other products but the
523.60s: main tool that you can derive from this
526.64s: notional value for the positions how
528.48s: those positions are correlated to the
530.92s: Spy and then the notional size for the
532.88s: portfolio so overall this one tool gives
536.40s: you a ton of information so again to
539.80s: recap what you learned you now know that
542.16s: beta waiting is a tool for helping us
544.24s: normalizing positions into a Common
546.32s: Language so that we can see how
548.32s: everything fits together as a broad
549.88s: puzzle piece we can also understand our
552.00s: directional risk because if you have
554.20s: really big either individual trade
557.32s: sizing that's beta weighted or the
559.24s: portfolio that's a shot across your bow
561.72s: and what I mean by that is if we come
563.16s: back to this example if you look at this
565.68s: beta weighted Deltas of
567.28s: $130,000 if you have't you know $50,000
570.40s: account this means that you are in a
572.92s: pretty big size and by the way let me
574.80s: get out of your way so you can
576.08s: see thank god um I'm referencing
578.72s: this down here so if you see this
580.76s: $129,000 and that looks really big
582.92s: relative to your portfolio let's say
584.40s: it's $50,000 that means that you're
586.36s: levered you have more risk than you have
589.40s: capital in the account again that might
590.84s: be part of your game plan but that gives
592.92s: you a sense of your overall risk but
595.12s: then again you can also see if you have
597.00s: individual trades that are out sized
599.76s: compared to others so the other thing
601.92s: you can grab here is the overall size of
604.96s: positions but the correlation of them
607.48s: because you can have things that by
609.84s: themselves if you look at the raw Delta
611.84s: you might not actually fully understand
613.56s: how these things behave against one
614.96s: another so like for example these short
617.32s: calls in xlu compared to SPX short
619.76s: straddle this Delta relationship from
621.80s: the raw Deltas doesn't really tell us
623.56s: much but if you look at the beta
624.76s: weighted Deltas you're like oh wait a
626.16s: minute these essentially cancel each
627.84s: other out interesting so the overall
630.40s: risk in the portfolio is quite different
632.48s: than what the raw Deltas would lead you
634.16s: to believe so this helps you get way way
636.76s: way more precise understanding the risk
638.84s: in your portfolio mapping out what
640.68s: changes you need to make so that you are
642.92s: more effectively employing and
645.20s: protecting your Capital if you have any
646.80s: questions as always drop them in the
648.40s: notes Below in the comment section if
650.36s: you have anything else that you want me
651.68s: to cover throw those suggestions in
653.28s: there too like subscribe be an outlier
656.40s: I'll see you guys later
