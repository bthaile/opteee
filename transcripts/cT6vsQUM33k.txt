0.00s: What is up to the ape outliers for today? We have kind of a mixed docket. I want to spend
9.72s: a little time going through the bed bath and beyond case because I think that that's
14.48s: generally interesting. And then there was a couple other questions that we got in the
19.88s: discord that I want to hit. And as always, whatever you all decide that we should talk about,
26.88s: we should take a look. So anything that you want to hit throat in the chat, we can dip
31.52s: dive, duck, dodge and dodge any direction that we want, dive into whatever. Unfortunately,
37.32s: our boy Newton is still slightly under the weather. So he and I were texting to figure
43.64s: out when we want to do our next session, but he's just looking to kind of, you know, take
47.72s: it easy this weekend. Rightfully so he's been working a lot now and live streams, I love
53.12s: him, but they do kind of require a lot of focus in order for it to be kind of a good conversation,
58.96s: right? So he's keeping it chill for himself. So make sure you all send your best wishes to our
65.68s: boy Newton. And I were talking a little bit, he actually had a couple recommendations. I always
69.84s: like to talk to him about what he thinks we should take a look at. And he had two things that he
76.32s: brought up. He thinks we should take a look at Causing Chewie. And then he also wants to take
83.04s: a look at some, he suggested that we take a look at some of Roaring Kitty's charts is the last
89.12s: that I got. So I think we will dive through those. Also, we have somebody in the chat name,
95.52s: California pizza is best, who you, you just know that probably a great person, but they are just
104.16s: trying to start some shit is what I think because it is objectively probably some of the worst
111.36s: pizza I've ever had. I've had better pizza in Las Vegas than I've had in California. And I'm from
116.96s: New York. So I do have a lot of respect. And that's where I think the best pizza is I would not call
123.44s: it California by any stretch of the imagination, but I have to imagine our friend California pizza is
129.28s: best knows exactly what they're doing. So shout out to them for ruffling people's feathers because
134.24s: that can always be kind of fun. All right, let's see who we got in the chat. I see
140.40s: PFA, Nola, Ron, ape of spades. That's a great name. ape of spades. Eating crayons. I second that
148.72s: with you. Shrey J is here. We got California pizza is best, which again, I probably have to argue
155.28s: against. Sadrick is here. Chris is here. Somewhere nowhere. That's kind of tricky. I guess it's
162.48s: nowhere as in they know where. That's pretty good. Let me grab this chat. Move it over here. So
168.88s: it's a little easier for me to keep up with you guys. Mark says, Johns of bleaker best pizza in
175.28s: New York City. I don't I'm not sure if I've had theirs before, but I think really when it comes
180.72s: down to where the best pizza actually is a lot of it comes down to like what hits up like nostalgia
186.40s: metrics because I remember as a kid, my favorite place was Tommy's in in the Bronx. Love that
192.80s: place. But yeah, I think a lot of it also comes down to like just what yeah, like what nostalgia
199.60s: buttons get hit. Snehill, Veyha says, sir, no, Richard Newton. No, so Newton is not available to
208.32s: join us today. Like I said, I still think that he's trying to like completely recover because he
213.04s: also started like his standard work. And it's a lot of work. One, doing all the game stop stuff.
219.12s: And then also doing like his standard job picking up. And he was sick most of last week.
224.08s: So day swag says, also, I like that you know, Newberg. I literally grew up there. So I went to
229.84s: NFA and went to South. I know Newberg super well. It's where I got stabbed in my hand. So super,
237.44s: super familiar with, yeah, super familiar with Newberg. California pizza's best says I got booted
245.76s: from Jackie stream after he talked about turning 1000 to a million. I don't know anything about any of
250.32s: that. And so I am not going to weigh in. I got to be honest, like I've heard people mention him
255.44s: before. I'm just not familiar with his work. So I have really no opinion one way or the other on,
263.20s: that side of things at least. I am, I kind of stick to the stuff that I spend time experiencing.
269.04s: Like with Newton, the main reason why I started working with him on this stuff is that like I could
273.44s: just tell he's a genuine human being, which is kind of rare to find in finance media, finance
279.44s: YouTube and stuff like that. So I naturally gravitate to those, those kinds of people just because I
285.36s: identify with them a lot more. I'm not saying that Jackie is not that again, I don't know him. I
290.16s: literally don't know him from a hole in the wall. But that's how I started working with Newton,
295.12s: especially unlike the broader GameStop stuff. So all right. Let's start here.
309.44s: So I started reading through this. A lot of it is mostly because, damn it, I keep forgetting to not
317.44s: put it behind my head. I changed sides. So it completely screws me up. Now that I'm on this side
325.68s: as compared to that side. And as you can tell, I forget all the freaking time. So when I look at,
335.60s: when I look at this, there's a couple of things I'm looking for. And again, just as I'm trying to
340.80s: develop a fingerprint for roaring kitty, the way that he does things more just because I think
346.32s: as an actor, he's interesting, not like an actor putting on a show, but like as a participant in
352.24s: this market, I think really, really interesting. So I enjoy learning about him the way he thinks about
359.44s: things, the way he does things. Cohen is obviously another one of those people. I spent some time
365.12s: watching a live stream. He did a while ago. No, that's a lie. Sorry, it wasn't a live stream. It was a
374.16s: like a podcast, I think. And it's like one of the only podcasts I've seen him do. And I learned a
381.84s: lot about Cohen, honestly, during that podcast. Let me see if I can find it really quick for you.
386.00s: I'm sure you all have seen it, but just in case somehow somebody hasn't, I think it's good context.
393.60s: Ryan Cohen podcast. Yeah, this one right here. So
403.44s: I think this podcast here. This was really fun to watch. If you guys haven't had a chance to watch
418.64s: this, I cannot emphasize it, or I cannot like recommend it enough. It was so good because it was
425.36s: such a cool opportunity to get a chance to like learn about like Cohen, the way that he views
432.24s: things the way that he interacts in a much more kind of relaxed setting, right? So he's not being
439.60s: deposed. He's not on some sort of like large media interview. He's just kind of having a
444.72s: conversation with this dude. And I think the conversation that they had was fascinating because
452.48s: it was a really good mix of shit that was about Cohen specifically. His background, him as a person.
461.20s: But then there was a lot of stuff that we got to talk about the way that he thinks about business
466.00s: and the way that he does things, which is really cool. This is actually where I learned a lot
470.80s: about his tweeting and his tweets now to me, they make so much more sense. So if I grab Cohen's Twitter,
481.28s: if you go through that podcast and then you look at his Twitter, I mean, it literally lines up
491.44s: perfectly. The fact that he did this, the fact that I think he changed this a few times, it used to be
500.56s: I forgot. He had like two different versions in his bio. One of them was like, she heard something
505.60s: and then the other one I think he had was like, unemployable or something. I forgot exactly what it was.
510.00s: Again, you guys probably would know better than me. But the point being is it's just very clear
515.28s: that the dude, he just like fucking around like he's just he's just playing games and it's hilarious.
521.92s: So like this, the Kamala coffee and the Trump coffee and what they are absolute joke Kamala 2069
529.36s: absolute joke. This absolute like he's just he's literally just playing games and it's hilarious
537.68s: because when I listen to this interview, it made way more sense. Like the dude just doesn't take
545.44s: the stuff that's seriously. He actually reminds me a lot of musk in the sense that like they're
550.56s: obviously very successful people that actually think that like the system and the game is kind of
556.40s: bullshit and they don't want to play like the corporate game by standard corporate game rules.
563.92s: And they like moving around a little bit more freely and just calling the nonsense as it is.
568.80s: Like that's some of what I see. And it's it's just so refreshing. So I bring all of this to context
575.44s: because when I'm looking through like this stuff and then I start reading through the the
580.48s: deposition a little bit again, I'm like I'm developing a deeper and deeper understanding of how
588.48s: this thing all works for him and the way that he thinks about things because I think it's important
595.52s: for us, especially because like I own shares of GameStop. So it's admittedly a small part of my
601.52s: portfolio, but nonetheless, I still care about the performance. I don't hold stock in pretty much
606.80s: anything. I trade options. So there's a few things I hold stock in and it's again, I remind you
612.96s: a lot of it is to support the movement and it's to participate, right? Because when there's
618.32s: something cool that's happening, I like to try to contribute to it the way that I can. But in my
623.92s: DNA, I'm a trader man. Like I'm always going to be a trader. It's how I do what I do. I started in 2007.
629.52s: And it's not going to change for me. It's how I make a living. So there's like the trading part of
635.20s: me that does stuff. But then there's in this case, part of me that's an investor in a company.
641.44s: And I'm holding shares for it, which I don't do much. So when I am in that position, I want to
646.00s: know about the company. And I started kind of getting caught up on this whole case. So I want to
652.80s: preface kind of poking through this with you guys that I'm not an expert at any of this stuff.
657.68s: I'm not an attorney. I'm literally just a dude that's online. I'm intrigued by these things. So
664.00s: there will be parts that I have some background information on, but I would wager hands down. You
670.80s: all know collectively, definitely far more than I know about this whole thing. So because of that,
679.04s: I want to poke through some things that I did see that were pretty interesting though.
685.36s: So as you can see that this case started in 23, log of 22. And from my understanding,
692.56s: and again, please help me understand if I'm wrong. That's really the whole point of doing these
697.04s: in a live session specifically in these instances is because it helps me learn as well. And not
702.96s: here just to teach the elements that I know again, like if it's something about options, I probably
707.12s: can teach you about it. That I know inside and out in sideways managing a portfolio analysis.
712.16s: That's my bag. But getting more and more the context of this broader story, that's where I'm learning.
717.28s: And I traded the squeeze twice, the one that we had recently and then the one before that.
724.64s: But I traded the movement of the price. That's what drew me to it as a trader. But after this
730.08s: most recent one, I started paying more attention to the broader story because at this point,
735.68s: I had been on YouTube. And I started just getting infatuated with the background of this whole thing.
743.44s: Because it is such a fascinating place to be. The way that I approach markets is so different
750.00s: than this. So all of that context is to say most of this is not my strength. There's pieces of
756.88s: this that I can definitely talk about very strong. Well, but there's a lot of it that I don't know.
763.04s: So anyways, going back to this, I was trying to understand even the origin of this, which it really
769.52s: seemed to amounts to some sort of stock market manipulation pump and dump. So when I was reading
775.52s: this initial complaint to again, get that general context, you can see that a few things came up.
783.76s: And the way that this thing is moved is actually been also pretty interesting because if I'm not
789.60s: mistaken, do you guys remember when the first bedbath and beyond when this happened? Because if I'm
795.84s: not, what was it like 2020 that it went down or something like that? Or was it 2022 specifically?
805.04s: Let me see. So the reason I'm thinking about the timelines is just the timelines that this unfolded
811.20s: from like when the initial event happened versus when they actually filed.
818.24s: Twit2b says, make your position larger. I'm near 45% of my portfolio. Yeah, it's not going to be me.
823.52s: Again, I just got to keep it a buck. There's I like the stock for sure. Like I think it's interesting
828.88s: and I think it's at a really, really cool spot here. But the nature of being a trader, it's
833.84s: completely different, man. Like the way I look at markets is I'm looking to find opportunities
839.84s: that I can trade up, down, sideways. I don't care. But it needs to be something that I can trade
844.72s: and consistently make money off of. The way that I trade is completely different. I don't want to
848.32s: make this about that. Just because nobody cares. But yeah, the the cliff notes version of it,
855.84s: those that what I do as a trader is is completely different. It's literally completely different.
862.48s: So yeah, the two parts of my brain are engaged in this kind of story. There's the stuff that's
870.96s: just fascinated by GameStop, Ryan Cohen, Roryn Kitty, the whole background, FDDs, the swaps,
878.16s: the different kind of tailwind cycles that we think exists. Like what Newton put together,
883.52s: this is like a freaking, it's, I call, he's like a, I call him I scribe, not my, right? It's not
890.24s: possessive like that. But like he's like the GME scribe because he's done such an incredible job
896.72s: staying in touch with what's going on. And he absolutely spends a lot of time and effort,
904.64s: you know, finding things that feed into the story. And he and I actually spend quite a bit of time,
911.92s: both on live streams. He and I have spoken more off live stream than on live stream by quite a
917.52s: lot at this point. And we talk about like these different things that he's coming across and try
922.40s: to analyze them. It's again, this stock moves so differently than normal stocks. And for somebody
930.16s: like me that's been in markets for so long, coming across products that do that is so intriguing.
937.44s: Like there's no other way for me to describe it than pure intrigue to see things. It's like if you
944.72s: play a sport, right? If you're a martial artist and you think about certain movements,
952.00s: movement patterns, there are things that are generally universal. But then every once in a while,
956.40s: somebody will come up and do things completely different. So that's kind of like a John Jones
961.12s: kind of fighter who's not really perfect at anything, but he's really good at most things.
966.00s: And he's super creative or like a Mikey Mousametshi from a Jiu-Jitsu world. Like they move
970.56s: differently than like the standard. And it's part of what makes them so intriguing. So when I look at
977.12s: GameStop, it's that. It's absolutely intriguing the way that the thing works. So
983.04s: Jay Swag says, I feel like you could trade GME pretty consistently, but not your portfolio. Yeah,
987.60s: absolutely. I think that's a completely fair statement. I think traders have to figure out
991.84s: what's right for them. So like, for example, if I look at GME and the way that GME has been moving,
998.88s: the notion of could it be traded? Absolutely. This can be traded, no doubt. But from the context,
1006.32s: also, there's a hundred of us here. So shout out to the outlier apes or just the apes who
1010.48s: ever is here hanging out, all are welcome. But when I look at something like GameStop,
1017.44s: could I trade this here? Of course, I could always trade something if I'm so inclined.
1022.64s: But the question I think a trader has to ask themselves is not like, could I conceivably place a
1029.20s: trade in this? Could I conceivably place a trade? Yes. The question realistically is where is the
1036.32s: best place for my money? That's what I care about as a trader. So to me, the question when I look at
1044.56s: something like GameStop or any other opportunity is not, could I trade this at this point? I can
1050.72s: structure a trade for anything. But it's where is the best possible place for my money? And it's not
1057.92s: just in terms of where can I make the most money? Where's the best return? It's how do things fit
1064.16s: into my portfolio so I can deploy all of my capital in a way that achieves my broader objectives
1072.96s: with my money. So yeah, day swagger, I completely agree with you. Somebody could easily focus only
1079.04s: on GameStop. That is completely possible. But it's a really tough way to make money in general
1086.48s: for a trader. For an investor, it's definitely a different story. Investors have to do whatever's
1090.88s: right for them. But even somebody like Roy and Kitty, that's one of the reasons why I'm so fascinated
1095.68s: by him because he is an outlier. He's a true outlier in the way that he approaches markets and the
1101.20s: way that he approaches money and the way that he runs trades. And he's been extremely fortunate.
1107.52s: I will again, keep it a buck. The dude's smart. He's super smart. But the thing about the way that
1113.76s: he's been able to grow his money is that it's not even just about being smart. It's also a lot about
1120.56s: fortune. Like how much luck is involved with how positions happen to be built at given
1126.08s: different point in time? Now for him, he's obviously sustained the approach for some time.
1132.56s: So it shows that I would argue it's more skill than luck. But there's still a healthy dose of luck.
1139.28s: So with stuff like that, like looking at somebody like Roy and Kitty, I think it is so important,
1146.40s: absolutely so important that we have to have like a healthy understanding of survivor ship bias,
1155.12s: how that works. And again, even the cat, he's moved from at least I think. I don't know if he's sold
1161.52s: out of GME. I can't say definitively, but I think he has. And it looks like he's rotated into Chewie
1167.20s: for now. I don't necessarily think by any means that he's done with GME. I still think that, again,
1172.56s: based on the breadth of evidence I've come across, it seems like GME is kind of like his bag. But I
1177.20s: also think he's venturing out for opportunities where he sees them. So I think that's part of the reason
1181.84s: why he moved. At least in the short term. Now again, I want to be very, very clear. I don't know
1190.00s: because I haven't seen his portfolio. I don't think anybody has. And with that is the case,
1195.28s: it's impossible for me to say definitively and I refuse to. That's another thing that you'll
1199.76s: find about the way that I talk about these things. I am so mindful about the framing of things.
1207.20s: And I think a lot of people are too comfortable saying things is fact when it's impossible for
1211.92s: them to know it is fact. And I think that's dangerous. That creates a really bad habit in our brain.
1217.52s: That we turn things that are well educated guesses into fact and they're different things.
1224.32s: So yeah, somebody like growing kiddie is just absolutely fascinating to me in the way that he trades.
1230.16s: So back over to this though, I started reading through the case to understand the broader context
1237.36s: of like what the problem is, what they're thinking about. Let me zoom this in a little bit.
1247.52s: Let me know if that's easier for you guys to read. If not, I can zoom it in a little bit further.
1252.72s: PFA has to step away for a few moments. PFA, let's not joke around. We know that you'll be back
1261.92s: in about 45 seconds, but that's good. Enjoy those 45 seconds as best as you can. And then yeah,
1267.92s: that's great. We'll catch up with you in a few moments. We got roaring titty. You guys didn't tell
1272.40s: me roaring titty was here every time I have a chance to say that name. I'm always here to say
1276.96s: roaring titty. It's great to see you. Oh, PFA pulled their message back. That's unfortunate.
1288.16s: It was good for everybody. That's okay. It's all right. PFA. It looks like PFA might be back
1292.56s: already. That was quick about time I think. All right. Back into this. So let's take a look at
1299.76s: the primary complaint. And I'm not going to go through each piece in this docket at all. My intent
1306.32s: is just to help us align on the big muscle movements and have everybody on the same page.
1313.20s: Because one thing I do find people do not just in the ape community, but in most communities,
1319.12s: is I don't find people take the time to go to sources. And I think it's important to go to sources,
1324.56s: to like actually see with our own eyeballs what something is. Because a lot of people,
1331.04s: they have like different opinions of stuff. And that's okay to hear the opinions. But I think
1335.68s: it's really important to see the actual information. Again, like you can tell from the way that I
1339.68s: typically present content to you guys. I'm very specific when I'm talking about something as an
1345.60s: opinion, I literally will say in my opinion very purposefully so that you know that is my brain
1351.28s: interpolating information and coming up with what I think. But there's also a difference between
1357.44s: like objective information. So that's what I aim to align with on this specifically is what is
1363.68s: the objective information? What is the origin of this thing as it sits? So the lead plaintiff,
1371.52s: this homie, individually and on all other person situated. So from my understanding,
1378.72s: stuff like this happens when there's going to be some sort of potential class action suit,
1383.52s: bigger suit, but they pick a lead plaintiff. And then they represent all their people that are
1390.48s: in similar scenarios. So from my understanding, they'll typically do this so that they have
1395.76s: obviously a focal point to work with. But they'll also try to find somebody that like represents
1399.76s: the case. Well, the most recent case against roaring kitty that was filed I think on a Friday.
1407.52s: And it was dropped on the Monday, which was really interesting. I did a video on that a while ago.
1412.72s: That was a similar scenario where they picked somebody to be kind of like the lead in that case.
1418.80s: But I thought the lead for that case was really, really weak. So I'm actually very curious how strong
1423.84s: this lead is in this case because yeah, I think that's kind of an important, I don't want to say
1430.56s: that important, but it is kind of an important factor to have somebody that represents it that has,
1435.68s: I don't want to call it like a more exaggerated story, but definitely more severe story would make sense.
1441.12s: So let's see, the within allegations based upon the investigation conducted through the plaintiff,
1451.68s: they reviewed analysis of Ryan Cohen, Arnalg Gustavo's public filings with the SEC, press releases,
1461.76s: public report news articles, research reports, so on and so forth. So this is a federal securities
1468.40s: class action brought on behalf of those folks who purchase stock from within the time frame,
1475.60s: essentially that they're referencing. And it says the plaintiff brings action, derivative action
1481.92s: within the meaning of rule that. So this is kind of just the foundation for the case writ large.
1492.00s: It's talking about everything what it ties to for different case laws and different rules that they
1497.92s: have to abide by who has jurisdiction, yada yada yada, I want to see where we see the,
1507.28s: where we see the, where we see the meat potatoes here. So here is the first part. So
1512.88s: paying Chang-C, it looks like they're saying that they acquired 8,020 shares.
1520.56s: And then they got it, they're arguing when it was artificially inflated. And then they lost 106
1527.76s: thousand dollars. First off, I boo fucking who, crime me a river, but that part of side,
1535.92s: let's see what they say. Canadian citizen called by media is the meme stock champion?
1542.16s: Is that accurate? Is this, is this true? Like is this actually what he's generally known as the
1553.20s: meme stock champion? I've heard of him, I know like Elon calls himself like the meme stock king
1558.48s: or some shit like that, but I don't know about the, the meme stock champion. What does that make sense
1566.56s: to you guys? I'm most, I think we should be back up. My bad. We just took, we took a little hiatus,
1578.96s: you know how it goes. I think I messed up something in, in OBS. Okay. So Paulus says full iceberg.
1586.56s: Well, all right. We're back at it. Also, there's 69 of us. So that, that was worth dropping out
1591.04s: for a moment. Okay. So it sounds like a kernel says you're breaking up. Let me know if the audio is
1597.04s: still coming through choppy. The OBS looks like it's going through. Okay. I see 60 FPS, 4600.
1604.80s: All right. So Paulus says I'm thawed. That sounds great. I'll go with thawed. That's all right.
1610.56s: And doctors A says we sound okay. So it looks like whoever says that I'm coming through broken.
1617.20s: We're just going to have to get you off of bad Wi-Fi. So okay. So it sounds like from consensus,
1624.08s: though, this isn't actually something he's like overly well known for. The reason why I was asking
1628.56s: this is because I see this where again, like in the deposition that I was reading most recently,
1635.20s: it looked like they were really trying to lean into this shit. And I'll explain a little bit why
1638.80s: I think that is when we get there. But I was genuinely just curious if this is like a well-known name
1643.92s: for him. And it sounds like generally not. So it says Cohen has employed, oh shit, they're getting
1650.80s: right into the meat and potatoes has employed pump and dump scheme to raise as much capital and
1655.84s: ignited several meme stocks to draw dropping heights. He served as chairman of game stops boards
1660.96s: in January 21 and throughout the class period. So that's also fascinating. Now obviously they have
1665.76s: to come out with their forks and knives in order to start getting something spicy going here.
1671.36s: But when I'm reading this, I think that they kind of forget quite a lot that he can't, like he
1679.92s: can't actually do this that well. The problem with larger float stocks is that they're difficult
1686.00s: to manipulate. That's why traders like me tend to not trade penny stocks. So if you've ever been in
1692.80s: any of my like my weekly update live streams, whenever people bring up, you know, penny stocks,
1700.16s: I'm always not about it. And it's because like I can't really trade it and they're really prone
1705.44s: to manipulation. So
1710.56s: Evergreen says more on alert. Yeah, I mean, I don't think you're wrong, brother. I'm probably
1715.20s: fall squarely into that category, but I'm enjoying learning about the the story and whatnot. So
1720.00s: hopefully we can learn a little bit together. But back to this, it's difficult to actually
1728.08s: run some sort of broad pump and dump on something like this in my opinion. So
1733.92s: could it be done? I absolutely think so. But I think it would be really difficult. There was a
1740.64s: recent case. I'm not sure if you all are familiar with it, but there was an entity. I'm not going
1746.24s: to name them because I don't want to give them any undue press. And the entity though, they were
1752.72s: like straight up running pump and dumps. And it was clear to see that there was like very clear
1757.68s: messaging behind it that they got from fact finding. So yeah, I mean,
1765.52s: that's like a clear example of pump and dump. I think this is a really difficult argument for
1769.84s: them to make here. But when somebody has a lot of money, a lot of times they're not necessarily
1774.08s: trying to position something that is super solid enough to go through and win a trial.
1782.00s: Because really if they can get them to settle ahead of time because they don't want to go to trial
1787.20s: or whatever else, that's what this is for. So even if this case is not the strongest thing based
1794.24s: on our opinion or whoever else's opinion, the main thing is they're kind of just taking a shot
1799.36s: here. And if they can get some of this to stick, then it becomes kind of again, just how much can we
1807.36s: potentially get from this dude to settle before even going to trial? Because that's the vast majority
1812.88s: path of cases is not trial. So this has like a little bit of mango on the lip.
1827.04s: Gotta get my mango.
1834.16s: Warring Titty says isn't Colin also the son of a big time trader? Yeah, I think his dad not
1838.72s: only was a trader, but I'm pretty sure he was a businessman. So let's see Ryan Cohen's dad.
1846.32s: Ted Cohen. Let's look up Ted Cohen.
1855.60s: This shows philosophy. That's not right. There's a lot of
1860.48s: I don't know if you guys can find a Wikipedia page on it. Let me know. I didn't see one doing
1868.96s: like a really quick
1890.80s: like a really quick pick through, but yeah, I think he came definitely from money. He also came
1899.60s: from a pretty well educated background. So yeah, Evergreen says so buy Fubo tomorrow since they
1907.76s: won the federal lawsuit against Disney and competitors. Oh, I see. Evergreen's just talking to somebody
1912.48s: else. I see. All right. No, this says he's really known for true, though. Yeah, yeah, that's exactly
1919.92s: right. So Ryan Cohen is really the one that started Chewie and that was a fascinating business
1926.64s: venture for him because his direct competitor, somebody like Amazon, and he found a way to angle in
1932.64s: between Amazon and a broader market that overall by all intents and purposes, they they had dominated.
1940.64s: So that is a really, really interesting outcome, I think, for Chewie and how how successful
1948.96s: he was able to able to make it. Roing Td says never mind. A.A says he's not a big time investor.
1954.00s: Yeah, I thought he was a businessman more so. Pat Smith says, Glassware Company. Yeah,
1959.04s: okay, that checks out. I thought he was a business dude. So they're trying to say essentially
1964.88s: that he ran a pump and dump. And this is talking about JP Morgan. Don't care. Defendant RC ventures,
1972.40s: Delaware Corporation. That's super common, by the way. LCs very often are going to be out of
1977.52s: Delaware because they have more favorable business laws. It's talked about, okay, so he bought in
1985.68s: 10% stake and best buying beyond, a bad bath and beyond in March of 2022. And the defendant has
1995.04s: served as the company executive vice president since May of 2020. And here are the allegations.
2003.68s: Plaintiffs claims or typical claims members class adequately protect the interest.
2010.96s: Here we go. So the class is so numerous that jointer of all members is impractical,
2017.52s: will impracticable. Why would it not just say impractical? What does this word mean?
2028.00s: Impossible impractice to do or carry out. Why not just impractical?
2033.84s: Why does it have to be impracticable? Huh. Learn a new words. As of 22,
2040.88s: BBBY is essentially 80 million shares outstanding. So such shares traded on NASDAQ,
2051.36s: exact members not known at this time, numbers in the thousands. Okay, so here are the actual
2056.96s: allegations. It says that there were materially misleading statements, omissions made to investors
2064.64s: regarding the company plans, financial conditions, so on and so forth. So not representing the
2069.20s: company is effectively at all times Gustavo as the executive VP, CFO and Treasurer control day to
2078.80s: day affairs. And Cohen was the largest shareholder who appointed three directors to the board, a
2084.08s: controlling person pursuant to section 20a. Through mid August, 22 BBBY appeared from the company's
2091.84s: perspective statements and financial reporting to be a successful turning around companies. So let's
2095.36s: grab a chart of BBBY. And then let's go back five years. I don't even think we have to go back five
2106.96s: years. We do like maybe three years, except I want daily. So let's do a three year daily chart
2115.60s: like that. That's better. Okay. So this is not going to be behind my head, but I think I'm mostly out
2121.12s: of the way. So here we can see where 22 was. So 22 just for reference starts right here.
2136.32s: And they were saying the time frame that they're referring to
2141.52s: through mid August, which is here, which is really interesting. Because if you actually look at this
2150.00s: chart from that time frame, this wouldn't look like a company that's turning around. I mean, just
2155.52s: I don't know, maybe I'm being nitpicky there, but I wouldn't consider that a company that's
2159.44s: turning around. It looks like a company that's having giant problems. Now for those that don't know,
2165.28s: from my understanding, somebody like Ryan Cohen seems to
2172.24s: just realize the chair was like screwing up the background remover. Ryan Cohen seems to like to
2177.36s: intervene in seller boxing, which seller boxing is a man. It's an interesting business practice,
2184.56s: but it's essentially to not go super far in the weeds. It's a predatory business practice where
2193.04s: you attempt to extract as much money from a company before it goes bankrupt. And the reason
2200.48s: why you do that is because if you essentially extract as much value as possible,
2206.48s: and then you short sell something and then it goes bankrupt, you don't have a tax footprint.
2213.92s: There's you don't owe anything because the entity is gone. So there's an incentive
2218.72s: for this predatory practice. And essentially the way it works is investors of different sorts,
2224.08s: sometimes in goods with a broker of some sort, well, identify a company that's otherwise struggling,
2230.48s: they'll put a board in that specifically or one of two things either a grossly incompetent board
2236.96s: and leadership team that they know is not really going to save it, driving it into the ground,
2241.28s: or somebody that's complicit with the behavior, either or again, don't know in this circumstance
2247.76s: what that was looking like. But the process can make a ton, a ton of money. So that's why
2257.36s: they're incentivized to do stuff like this. Now for somebody like Ryan Cohen, if you're able to
2263.44s: turn the company around, it leads to stuff like this, to squeezes. And it leads to movements
2271.84s: that force the other side of the trade that was shorting it to get out of their trade and it
2277.44s: can make a shit out of money to the upside. Now it's very, very much difficult in order to make
2285.68s: that kind of turnaround. But if you are able to make that kind of turnaround, you can make a ton of
2290.64s: money. And I think Cohen started getting more into this activist investor role because of some
2297.92s: of the possibilities there. Now again, I don't know his actual motivations. I don't know if he's in
2302.40s: there till, you know, for Chevrolet to go in there and save a company. I like, I think he's still a
2307.68s: businessman. But I think it happens to Cohen side with doing something that I would consider to be
2314.16s: more honorable than, you know, participating in purposefully sending a company into the dirt
2322.16s: because you have a chance to make a tax regain on it. So that's what I think in general,
2329.84s: one of the reasons why he started moving into this is because he saw an opportunity here to navigate
2337.12s: that. So here it says through mid August, it appeared to be successful turning around the company
2346.08s: appeared to be moving rapidly towards growth, profitability through fundamental reshaping strategies,
2352.56s: spending off the best, the buy-by baby business, the picture almost entirely fiction from March 22
2360.08s: through August 22. They're saying that Cohen in conspiracy with Gustavo engaged in fraudulent
2367.20s: scheme to artificially inflate the price of BBY publicly traded stock. More specifically,
2374.00s: with JPMs aiding in a betting, blatantly misrepresented the value of the profitability of BBY
2380.32s: causing it to report revenues that was fictitious and all right. So they're any here talking a bunch
2388.48s: of shit. I think if anybody has any questions on this, I think we can go further into detail if
2393.68s: you'd like. The only reason why I really wanted to start with this document is so that everybody has
2399.28s: again, from the source, what the issue is, what they're looking at and why they're looking at it.
2405.84s: So my intent isn't to go through this entire document because it's going to be super one-sided.
2410.48s: This is the complaint. When you see a complaint, this is the people who have a complaint that are
2416.48s: going to talk all their shit. So it's going to be super one-sided. I don't care to go through this,
2422.16s: but for those that want to go through the whole thing in detail, I'll drop a link in the chat. You
2428.16s: guys all have access to that now. Then I'll drop a link to the broader thing as well in the chat
2432.64s: just so that you can have the entire docket. I'm pretty sure this is on Newton's sheet somewhere.
2438.40s: If I'm not mistaken, if not, I'll make sure that he also has exits. Not really GME, but it's
2443.76s: tangential via Cohen because this does impact Cohen when he has pending litigation like this going
2451.52s: on. So that's this one. We now understand, again, from the source, what the general gripe was,
2459.60s: they think that these two incahutes were trying to spread a fake story about Best Buy essentially
2467.36s: for their own gain. I have to open my door real quick because the boss is here, aka Thor.
2480.64s: I think he heard us talking about legal stuff and he decided to come check it out. The main thing is
2496.96s: he is hilarious. He goes up to my door and he just scratches it once. Oh, you're tired. Why
2503.12s: are you so tired? You've been sleeping, bro. He comes up and he scratches the door once and then
2508.56s: he scratches it again and then he scratches it again. It's like a very, very specific cadence.
2514.40s: But as you can tell, he's ready. He's interested to get into the legalities of game stop. Do you know
2519.44s: about this? Hey, need you to focus. We're going to talk about depositions. You know what deposition is?
2527.44s: I think he's ready. I feel like he's essentially, you can tell he's ready for court.
2532.48s: He has his tuxedo on. He does have a mohawk. I don't know how well perceived that would be in court.
2542.80s: But yeah, we got the boss here. All right, let's get my ugly face out of the way now.
2548.88s: Alan says real quick. Can you explain for me how to buy shares of GME on the lot market?
2557.36s: I've seen a lot of talk about retail traders orders not making it to a lit market. Okay, you
2561.44s: meant lit market. Yeah. So depending on who your broker is, you can choose where to route your
2566.16s: order. So again, I don't know who your broker is. But if you choose order routing, then you can
2574.96s: essentially determine where you want it to go so that it's not gone through a market maker.
2579.68s: So if you use something like the ice, it's an electronic exchange.
2585.04s: You can change the routing of your order so that it's not being fulfilled through
2590.16s: a market maker, that kind of thing.
2592.32s: Cedric says, oh, shit, this guy's USMC. Yes, sir. That is exactly what all that
2597.76s: paraphernalia is that you see in the background.
2601.68s: Rohingtini says, IEX, I think, yeah, so you can take a look at a couple different ones.
2606.64s: Alan uses Robinhood. So I honestly have absolutely nothing to say to you because the last thing
2611.84s: I would use is Robinhood. That is like straight up the last possible broker I would use.
2619.20s: I would rather use a fucking notepad that I mail to people then using Robinhood and supporting
2625.76s: that business. I would rather use stone tablets that I chisel my trade and deal with the delay
2634.00s: of FedEx shipping stone tablets in order to get trade confirmations than going through
2643.28s: Robinhood. There's just no way.
2646.08s: So the main thing you want to look up though is like specific to your broker once you get a
2651.20s: natural broker is just how to route orders directly to the exchange. So if you route orders
2657.28s: directly to an exchange, you're now bypassing the market maker and you don't really need to
2665.20s: you don't have to have your order internalized. So yeah, that's what you can do there for that.
2672.80s: It's a good question. Ian says, dude, I remember these livestreams two years ago where you
2678.08s: attend 13 people so sick to see other communities going, yeah, man, I have to be honest. The funny
2683.76s: thing about the way that you could tell that I'm not in this for like the fame or the attention
2687.84s: because exactly as Ian is saying, I've done livestreams since I started on YouTube essentially
2693.12s: and like we used to have like 10 people which I was totally cool with. My goal for being on
2698.64s: YouTube is just to try to share information because when I started looking at the broader picture,
2705.28s: there's so much shitty information and terrible people that are just trying to make money off
2710.48s: of people that it drives me crazy, especially because the people that they're trying to make money
2716.00s: off of are the exact people that don't have the money to waste. So that's I did a thing for a while
2722.96s: where I was doing like these trade service reviews stuff because I was like super pissed off about it.
2728.48s: And I was trying to find like decent trade services and I can't find them really. They're hard
2733.76s: to find, but yeah, we've been running this for a minute and it's fun. Yeah, I love seeing the
2741.12s: community grow. It helps also with just collective intellect and like the hive mind and the overall
2747.36s: amount of information we have available to us. It's just straight up beneficial for everything.
2752.24s: Paulus says when is it advantageous to bypass the market maker? Really, if you don't want your order
2759.76s: being internalized. So like if you want your order to be processed on the actual exchange,
2769.20s: that's when you could do it. But other than that, again, from like a practical perspective,
2772.96s: it's it's not really beneficial. More often than not, you are going to get a slightly better
2777.52s: fill through a market maker because of the way that payment for order flow is structured.
2782.48s: Again, just keeping it real. I'm not saying that I love payment for order flow or anything.
2786.72s: It's I will again, objectively say markets now are more efficient with payment for order flow
2792.64s: than when they were when I started trading like 2008, 2007 is when I started, but specifically
2799.20s: with options. So like payment for order flow isn't all negative, but I also don't think it's great.
2807.04s: Like I think we're at a point now where we've seen how this works and I think that we're at a
2811.52s: point where we can kind of move past payment for order flow into the next thing because there is
2817.52s: a next thing that's better than payment for order flow without a doubt. But yes, just kind of where we're
2822.08s: at at least at the point now. So yeah, that's the the idea about bypassing the market maker.
2832.24s: Eric, it's my doppelganger. Eric says, have you heard about the cat error reporting
2837.68s: numbers? There appears to be a correlation of a significant number of equities error reporting
2843.36s: dates with GME price runups. Interesting. Really, really interesting. Now, I haven't looked into that.
2851.36s: If there's somewhere that I can take a look at it, let me know. You can either email it to me now
2856.00s: and just let me know when you email it to me or you can drop it in the discord if you're in there,
2859.76s: either or is totally cool. Eric at outlier trading.io, that's the new email address.
2868.56s: So for everybody that doesn't know, I've moved the branding from ES invest to outlier trading. I
2873.44s: just want it less like focused on me. It shouldn't be about me. So that's what that is. So that's my new
2879.12s: email. Okay, yeah, if you put it in the discord, I can grab it real quick and pull it up.
2883.84s: No problemo. I see. Let's take a look.
2897.12s: All right. So this is from region formal. I say those names because you guys might know them.
2905.44s: I honestly don't so I don't know exactly who they are if they have a background with you all.
2911.84s: I don't know them, but just in case you do. This is finra is just released the latest cat error data
2917.76s: and it has them intrigued. So once a month it says finra reports cat errors volume
2923.20s: reached trading day. Yep. Notice the error rate percentages which are trades that occurred on all
2928.88s: dates did not contain all regulatory required information. On most dates, the rate is less than
2935.52s: 21%. However, occasionally much higher numbers first of May and
2946.72s: I'm just trying to follow the logical thing here. Specifically, a nine occasions, there were
2950.88s: excessive errors over a short duration, 1.8 billion within five days. All nine instances
2956.48s: resulted in significant price rents for GME within the next 60 days.
2960.88s: Yeah. Here's the deal. I again, I could see the interest here. The interest is interesting.
2968.00s: That was kind of a funny sentence. But again, for like if this is the trigger,
2973.68s: right, that if this happens that there's a price run within 60 days, that's a long ass time.
2981.04s: And what happens over that 60 days, it's like unless you can purely isolate this thing,
2990.72s: the cat error as the thing, unless you can purely isolate that. Then to me,
2998.80s: and that's one of the things that makes the whole GME story so difficult, because it's so
3004.64s: difficult to actually isolate individual things. So in this case, does it look like there's a
3013.60s: relationship? I mean, they're saying in nine instances, there was a relationship. I would need to
3019.84s: know essentially the full data set though. And maybe they have it in here. But like I would want to see
3026.40s: all of the instances, not just nine instances. So this says all nine instances resulted in
3031.52s: significant price runs. But were there any instances where it went up and price didn't move? I would
3037.92s: need to know that. But the other thing is with such a big window of like 60 days, I think it's
3043.92s: really hard to like point at this and say this is the thing. Again, to their point, I'm not saying
3049.60s: that that's what they're doing. But to them, it looks like there's an interesting correlation,
3054.80s: right? So it says I found this trend applies to the market as a whole.
3062.16s: Much stronger for GME than other stocks. BlueBars average performances of the stocks from 15 to 25
3068.72s: in the nine instance of the higher billion aerosicles. Tested price action after huge cat option
3078.32s: air periods found the opposite trend. It looks really interesting. So this is the kind of data
3086.24s: that I find really interesting. Because again, the what I see is there's two different parts of
3095.20s: this. The first part is from just a general trading perspective. So I'll again use the example that
3105.44s: I share with you guys here, which is in GME. If we go back here, if we go back here,
3118.80s: I noticed something even before like the market started taking off on this first leg up.
3127.92s: You can see on the third of May, there was a massive, massive increase in price and volume.
3139.76s: So what causes this? I couldn't tell you, but this is one of the things that caught my attention.
3146.96s: So when I look at this kind of run up, I see just interesting behavior. I see an explosion and volume
3156.24s: that's focused on by side. And I see a massive movement in price. So now how that corresponds with
3166.64s: again, this other data that we're looking at, I don't know. But what I do know is that before all
3174.08s: of the squeezes that I've seen, there's been a really anomalous run up in average volume.
3180.40s: That I can point that. What causes the run up in that volume, I don't know.
3188.16s: But I do know that whenever I've seen GameStop run, the volume has changed. So for me, that's the
3194.00s: indicator I look for personally, because I can directly look at it. Nathan says, yeah, in those
3199.84s: nine times price run happened completely different ways over those 60 days. So it's not exactly
3204.16s: isolated. I got downvoted to hell saying that on his post. Well, I think the problem is
3212.16s: Nathan for that, like why you would get downvoted is because like depending on the way that you frame
3216.72s: it, right? Because I think one of the problems is it's so easy to cast stones and disprove theories.
3223.92s: And it's much harder to come up with like efficacious theories. So the way that I typically try to
3228.96s: look at addressing those kinds of things, at least from my mind, is from a pure scholastic
3235.12s: standpoint, I am interested in finding the holes in the faults in a theory, not to tear it down
3241.20s: because I don't want it to be true, but because I'm attempting to find truth. But I normally try
3246.40s: to approach it from a method of how can we, if there's a hole in the theory on how we can build
3255.12s: on the theory to try and again, identify as much truth as possible. That's the idea at least.
3262.72s: So yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not exactly sure what the background is behind like your comment or
3269.68s: how it went. But yeah, that's, it's really interesting to see those kinds of connections made
3276.56s: because again, like there's no doubt that that is a fascinating, fascinating correlation with
3283.68s: the cat error data. Like that, that's something. But whether or not that's the actual trigger to
3291.84s: something, I'm actually like, I'm not sure. I'm really not sure. It's very difficult for me to tell.
3300.80s: So it's something that I would keep an eye on and see what I could then
3309.20s: tie it to and try to isolate. That's one of the hardest parts when I look at this here.
3318.16s: And I explore Newton's data. We kind of talked about this. I can find a lot of instances where it's
3324.32s: like there's kind of these really neat correlations between things where we might see FTD skyrocket
3330.72s: or we might see some of the ETF FTD skyrocket. Like we can see these different pieces that start to move.
3337.44s: But then I can also find instances where like the pieces move and then price doesn't move.
3344.56s: So again, from like a correlation standpoint, which again, like my background is based in stats.
3352.64s: So from a correlation standpoint, it becomes really interesting to try to isolate it.
3358.80s: And again, for me, the cleanest isolation I found so far is volume. And no shit, Sherlock,
3367.36s: there's nothing magical about that. It's like very common. Now that the tricky part, I think for
3371.76s: a lot of people is trying to identify where the volume comes from, which again, it looks like
3378.64s: this is a start on that. But I think Noah says not every cat error equals an FTD, which is
3385.52s: another really important point, I think. I think when we look at cat errors, it tells us there's
3391.12s: something going on with tracking, but we don't know exactly what. So I'll have to see.
3399.52s: Okay, so let me grab this link really quick.
3410.00s: So this is the cat data. Where's the actual data? I see the presentation. So this link,
3419.36s: it says the error update, including the data. So maybe it's in the presentation.
3425.68s: So that's what I'm looking at here.
3430.40s: So what I can do is I can pull this data down and then I can run a slightly different analysis
3440.48s: that essentially can test for correlation and then I can regress it and assign a confidence
3450.16s: interval. So I'll take this as an action item. Let me write that down. I have to write it down
3456.80s: because I'm pretty dumb and I mess things up a lot. All right, so
3468.40s: let me get rid of this. Because it's interesting. Again, like all of these different kinds of things,
3475.84s: I really, really enjoy looking at because they are so interesting. But a big part of it, at least for
3481.36s: me, is to try to like actually see if I can get to the heart of signal from the information.
3488.72s: Because there's so much interesting information. So I need to do like a cat error, regression,
3498.16s: and correlation. So then I'll add this to my to do list.
3506.56s: This I'll save this as a bookmark on to do and then we'll take a look at that.
3514.64s: So I will follow up on that to see like what I can find because I'm not sure.
3522.88s: But this looks interesting to me. I can objectively say that this looks interesting to me.
3529.68s: But it looks like there was another comment. Let me see.
3536.48s: Diana says what initiates more volume? I know news and earnings usually does but what else?
3541.84s: The this isn't designed to be like pedantic. But the genuine answer and just to start from like a
3549.76s: base level understanding is it's more interest in the stock. It's demand. It's people buying.
3556.32s: So when I look at volume, I'm it's in the simplest form telling me people are buying.
3566.08s: Now why they're buying? That's where it starts to get interesting. So in this case,
3572.56s: are they buying because there's an FDD cycle and they need to accumulate shares in order to cover?
3578.08s: That could be. Could they be buying because there are swaps coming up and they need to be able to
3582.96s: deliver on the underlying? It could be. There's a lot of reasons why volume might start to emerge.
3589.84s: But again, from like a trading perspective, we actually try to eliminate as much of that noise as
3595.92s: possible because it's noise. The thing that matters to me is volume moving. Now again, from like just
3601.04s: the general interest standpoint and markets, which obviously I'm fascinated by GME, but like I just
3606.48s: love markets. You could tell because even when I was on vacation in Alaska, I was making videos
3610.64s: about this stuff because I love markets. But so there's that side of me that wants to understand
3617.28s: some more of the background. But I always make sure that there's a bifurcation in my mind. I'm
3622.08s: compartmentalizing. Like I want to know why this volume is here because I'm generally interested.
3627.20s: And maybe I can find a way to detect different kinds of volume signals to make decisions. So I can
3633.28s: do that. Now with GameStop, it's interesting because again, like if I zoom this in a little bit more,
3639.44s: it'll be easier for you to see. This is right now. Let's go to six months. Notice something very
3645.44s: specific. And this is my initial key. And this is actually what made GameStop pop up on a scan for
3651.76s: me. Notice this day doesn't look interesting by itself. I'll zoom in so it's easier for you guys to
3657.68s: see this day right here. It doesn't look interesting by itself. It actually looks like it pales in
3662.64s: comparison to everything else that we saw here. But relative to the time frame before all of this
3670.16s: happened, this looked like a freaking mountain. As did this, these periods looked really interesting to
3678.96s: me. So when I saw this day come through where the bi volume was 8 million, the average volume at
3688.24s: that point was 3.9 million per day total. The bi volume in this case essentially was almost two and
3698.00s: a half times that. Well, two times. This becomes super interesting to me. So I this popped up on a
3707.76s: scan. So then I started following it and I see this volume jumping in. So something's going on.
3714.56s: And the fun part is is if you look at the options chain, you could see somebody knew something was
3719.28s: going on. And it wasn't just roaring kitty. There was more players in there than roaring kitty.
3723.84s: Because I started getting in along with a bunch of other people that are looking for these same
3728.00s: kinds of things. Now, it's really important to note sometimes it turns into nothing. That happens.
3736.80s: It's not a sure thing. But what I'm trying to do again from a trading perspective is just picking
3742.16s: up breadcrumbs from options markets, which are highly informed smart people use options.
3751.12s: And it's not because options are like cool or anything like that. It's because options provide
3758.16s: leverage smart people like leverage. You can make more money on your smart idea with leverage exactly
3768.40s: what's going on there to a T. So when I see this kind of movement, I am very, very interested.
3780.00s: With GameStop though, obviously it's super tricky because we don't know exactly what causes the
3786.88s: volume. And it looks like there's that this is the other part of the story. That's really interesting
3792.88s: to me is that when I look at these different really large movements in GameStop, a lot of times,
3799.44s: I think there are different factors that drive the price performance. That's just been another
3807.60s: wrench in identifying like what the the real signals are is that it looks like it's multivariate.
3814.16s: That's as far as I can tell. So it makes it much more difficult to discreetly identify stock
3820.48s: prices moving because of X because of Y or because of Z because sometimes it moves because of X
3827.44s: other times it moves because of Y other times it moves because of Z. So again, for me,
3833.52s: I funnel all of that into what I can tell you again with near certainty volume moves.
3841.36s: I've not seen any sort of massive movement in GME before volume has moved. So if we go to a five
3849.12s: year daily and we look at the the pre squeeze move here, look what happened to volume.
3855.20s: You got a ton of crazy expanded volume here. I'll zoom it in. So it's easier to see.
3866.72s: Take a look at the volume here, right? This is well before it started running up even above 100.
3874.40s: In this case, it had already made a giant move here. It was like five bucks and here it doubled
3882.56s: to like 10. But look at the volume. It's massive. So that's realistically the ultimate trigger that I
3891.04s: personally use for stuff like this. Now again, as I'm analyzing it, this stuff I just find interesting
3897.52s: and I want to learn more about it. I want to understand more about the product, how it moves,
3901.76s: it's quirks. But this really comes down to just interest in what drives the volume.
3909.20s: From a trading perspective, I'm just looking for volume. That's how I'm going to find movement.
3913.36s: That's why I've been so disenfranchised as of late because we're, I mean, literally,
3920.32s: you can't even see the volume anymore. It's so suppressed. And part of that suppression to be
3925.36s: clear is going to come from this. Jerry Diamond says volume is the ultimate trigger he uses after
3935.76s: the facts. No, that's what I'm trying to show you is that volume starts to kick off before.
3941.60s: That's the whole point I'm trying to explain to you guys. So again, maybe the point wasn't clear.
3947.60s: So in this case, look at the second of May, we can see that price of GameStop second of May,
3954.96s: it closed at 1276. And we can see that the volume though, the buy volume on the second of May,
3963.20s: when it was still sub 15 dollars, the second of May, the buy volume was 8 million shares.
3971.12s: The 20 day average volume at that point was 3.9 million shares. That's 3.9 million shares
3979.44s: over the entire day on average for the past 20 trading days. On this day, the second of May,
3986.96s: the buy volume, only the buy volume, the buy volume was 8 million shares. So the buy volume on the
3995.52s: second of May was twice the average total day volume. This is again, when GameStop closed at 1276,
4008.88s: this is light years before the interesting move happened, right? This is on the second of May.
4015.84s: You didn't get the ultimate moves until the 13th or the 14th of May. This is exactly what I was
4022.88s: just showing you again, going back into 21. Before, in this case, we went above 100,
4033.44s: the volume started growing above average volume levels days before. So like the 13th of Jan,
4042.00s: you can clearly see excessive volume, even on the 11th of Jan. So what I'm highlighting is actually
4049.20s: the exact opposite, Jerry. I'm highlighting that volume can start showing us positioning before
4056.48s: the move because exactly to your point, what good is it to be able to say like, oh yeah,
4061.92s: on the 28th of January, it was so clear that this was going to happen because the RSI started
4068.72s: peaking and you know, it's all bullshit. Like the ability to look at something afterwards and
4074.72s: paint a pretty picture is completely useless exactly to your point because it's after the fact.
4079.60s: Of course, it's clear. It's hindsight. But what I'm trying to show you specifically with volume
4084.88s: is that volume is such a great indication of things that might be happening. And again,
4089.52s: I already told you, it's not perfect. There will be times where you'll see a volume run up and
4093.52s: then something falls flat on its face. That absolutely happens. But when you're trading,
4101.20s: it's about a probabilistic assessment of things and where can you find a higher probability of a move.
4107.60s: And the reason why this happens is because markets take time to position. It's not an instantaneous
4115.36s: thing. We as retail traders, that's one of that's one of our very few advantages that we get to
4121.92s: position however we want, whenever we want. And you can essentially do it with your entire account
4130.16s: that is not the case for larger institutions at all. Larger institutions have to take time to
4138.16s: position things however they want. And even somebody like Rory and Kitty, which we clearly had
4144.08s: an example with not that long ago, and when he started posting his yellow updates, we can trace
4151.20s: back his behavior when he was entering the position. And you can see that he had to build it
4159.12s: over time. So yeah, I mean, that is again, like one of the very, very few benefits that we have.
4168.40s: And I am getting a dinner order ready for my wife and I. I think we're going to do barbecue tonight.
4177.84s: A little bit of barbecue. It's supposed to be good for the soul they say. I'm think I'm going to do
4182.80s: try tip and pull pork. I think that's what I'm leaning towards. What do you guys think?
4191.76s: Maybe do it like the spicy barbecue. That's what I'm going with. I think that's a good pick.
4199.84s: I'd rather be seeing says increased volume starts before the actual move. Yeah, exactly right.
4204.16s: The vast majority of instances you'll see volume move before the underlying starts to move.
4212.88s: Dan says, doing a stir fry with veggies rice chicken steak. Oh, dude, that sounds so good.
4218.08s: Tomorrow, I was going to do pasta with garlic and oil. My mom used to do that. She does like,
4224.16s: I don't know, it's super, super good. And I like, I like that a lot, but I always add chicken to it
4231.20s: because I don't just like eating pasta by itself. Obviously, it's just like a lot of carbs for the sake of carbs.
4235.84s: And then also, I need to text my wife quick to see if she can hook me up with a reload.
4247.60s: And you grab me a reload of mango orange.
4254.40s: Spend drift. She's the homie. She essentially keeps it keeps it pushing in here because,
4261.36s: but I think I've told you guys like towards the end of the day is when I normally break my fast.
4265.76s: So I start going through liquid like a mother.
4270.24s: Colonel says, you're living the life of Pat Riley. I actually don't know who that is. Is that like,
4275.52s: I actually have no idea if it is off the lift them up.
4281.92s: And then back for I forgot, Jerry, I think Jerry originally was talking about the volume.
4287.44s: I just want to make sure, Jerry, that that makes sense for you because I think that that's like a
4291.44s: really important general point for people for traders in general because it's one of the cleanest
4297.04s: indicators that you can use. It's very difficult to use just volume by itself. Like I said,
4301.52s: you kind of have to pick up other context clues by volume versus cell volume, by volume versus
4307.12s: recent average volume. There's a lot of these like smaller quirks that I think you have to pay
4313.52s: attention to. So another thing that you'll find on my chart sometime that not here now,
4317.92s: but is actually two moving averages. So in this case, I have a longer term moving average.
4324.24s: You're the bomb. Thank you. And then I sent you a part.
4330.72s: She came in with the hook off. Thank you.
4336.88s: There we go. We got another mango orange.
4340.48s: I was having to drink my backup watermelon, Seltzer water, which is just a, you know, just a
4347.52s: to giant step down. All right. So it looks like we might have lost Jerry. That's okay. I just
4352.88s: wanted to make sure that the explanation was clear because I really do hate it when people are
4358.24s: doing technical analysis after the fact and we pretend like it's all so clear and we could see
4364.56s: all these things. But ahead of time, it was like the clearest thing is possible.
4369.68s: And yeah, I just don't think that that's useful.
4381.52s: It looks like there's a question from Tommy. Tommy says, what volume specific scans you use
4386.16s: and toss? There's a bunch of them. So I'll use percent growth. I'll use percent growth over an
4392.56s: average. I'll use percent overnight growth. If I'm trying to trade something next day,
4396.96s: continuation style, I'll use standard deviation. That's another big one. So like volume that exceeds
4404.80s: two and a half time standard deviation. I'll use volume that's accompanied with a price gap.
4409.84s: All of those are on the table for me. Volume is one of my favorite scans because it really is
4417.68s: super, super telling. You can learn a lot by looking at volume. And again, it's not a perfect thing,
4424.48s: but what I like to do is start with volume. And then I'll then start to build off of it with
4433.28s: what else I can see. So sometimes if you start with volume and then you start seeing,
4439.12s: for example, the moving average starting to expand. And then you start to see
4446.16s: the buy volume as a larger percentage of total volume. All of those things start to coalesce,
4453.20s: I think, into a really, really cool picture. That's relatively, I don't want to say easy to see,
4460.96s: but it's relatively high probability, I believe. But I definitely like to make sure that
4468.16s: if I'm playing something one of the base requirements, oh, it almost always is volume. If there's
4474.32s: no volume, you're losing liquidity, which you need in order to get in and out. And you also need
4481.92s: volume because that's again, what ultimately moves stock price, which is kind of that smaller component,
4487.60s: we were talking about a little bit earlier when I kind of glossed over it.
4499.04s: I'd rather be skiing says volume is like hearing a gunshot. You just don't know where
4505.20s: or if it will continue. I know. Yeah, I think it's a weird comparison because if you've been shot
4509.36s: at you actually get kind of good at knowing how to detect like different sounds of gunshot where it is.
4515.04s: So I get your point though. I think overall it's a good point.
4519.52s: No, this says what's your analysis of these recent low volume days? Yeah.
4523.92s: Yeah.
4525.68s: To me, it looks like we're consolidating. So a couple of things that I think about in this
4533.36s: like within this context, you can see that even on this really light volume,
4542.88s: GMEs not being pushed down, which is actually to me like really good news.
4548.72s: So when I look at like this day, it was 64% sale volume, meaning people hitting the other side
4555.36s: of the bid ask spread. And it still was a small update like not huge. It opened at 2237 and it
4562.00s: closed at 2240. So I mean, we made three pennies on the day. It's nothing really to write home about.
4567.60s: But if you think about it in the face of doing that with pretty decent sale volume on a relative
4572.56s: basis for the day, I actually consider that a little bit of a win. So I think GameStop is getting
4579.60s: really close to a point where like investors are generally agreeing on the value. We did exercise
4586.88s: not too long ago on like what the intrinsic value was. And I know a lot of people got pissed off at
4591.12s: me for talking about like the intrinsic value. I don't know why because I'm not suggesting that
4596.72s: that's, you know, GameStop is worth something. But what I'm using that as a benchmark for is like
4601.92s: when people ask how far we think GameStop can go down to, to me, using something like
4608.32s: intrinsic value is just a really great back of the napkin parameter to use to start with.
4613.92s: Because again, like as something starts getting towards its intrinsic value, just about all
4618.00s: investors get interested in it. Because then it's not even trading at a premium to future discounts
4623.60s: to discounted future cash flow. So because of that, I think it's just a good general tool to use
4630.80s: from like overall context. Cedric says 13 is the book value, right? I don't know. So I looked it
4637.52s: up on chat GPT and it was a little bit lower than that. Let me see. What is GameStop's current
4645.84s: intrinsic value? And I'm using intrinsic. So if you use in book value, that's a little bit different.
4654.00s: What is, let me ask that question too, GameStop's current book value. Which I think I have actually.
4664.32s: Let's see. Book value per share, three or average is like 10, 403. This is just giving me an average.
4675.04s: Book value per share here you go. This is like 438. That's a different metric. So intrinsic value
4687.12s: is kind of what the actual price if it unwound entirely. So this says as a 14-og 24,
4696.40s: the intrinsic value is estimated to be 845 per share based on DCF. Now a discounted cash flow
4703.04s: model is still kind of different. I wouldn't use that in this case because it misses a lot of context.
4709.60s: It looks like the other thing that chat GPT is saying is that the intrinsic value ranges between
4715.84s: seven, which is not true, an 1109, which I think is a little bit low. But I think using 11 is like
4721.84s: a floor is reasonable. Again, it's like a conservative reasonable floor. But to me, I would probably
4728.96s: guess it. I haven't ran it yet myself. So I can't tell you. But it's not hard to run. I can
4733.52s: download the fundamentals and look at again, like the objective if we were to flatten this entire
4739.12s: company, what it was looking at. But in this case, I would guess somewhere around 12. That's my
4745.20s: best guess. Like if I were to just swag what I think the current intrinsic value is. Now,
4751.68s: the problem with using an intrinsic value like that though is that you also have to take into
4756.48s: account the IP intellectual properties, the brand value itself. And this does have that.
4762.96s: So that's also another reason why I think it might be a bit higher than those, like generally
4769.20s: super conservative estimates, in my opinion. So yeah.
4775.92s: Cedric says, now we are 22. So let's six per share different on the books.
4781.28s: Right. Well, that's because again, you have to remember when you're looking at the stock price
4785.20s: of something, you're looking at a forward projection. It's an expectation. So right now, this is
4791.20s: looking at like the future. This is discounting the future cash flows. This is what we think
4798.32s: GameStop will be able to produce over the next six to month timeframe, six to nine month timeframe
4803.60s: given what we know now. So it's it's by its very nature a very conservative estimate.
4808.80s: So yeah, I think Nola says, intrinsic value includes inventory, physical, real estate,
4821.84s: or negative value for a lease. It depends on what model you use. The way that I like to think about
4829.12s: intrinsic value is that if it had to start liquidating and essentially like closing out the
4834.72s: business, what would the value be per share? So I think about something like a lease, whatever
4841.60s: value is remaining on the term of the lease, that would have to be absorbed, that would be negative.
4847.28s: But if we're going to unwind the physical real estate, the current market value of the
4851.60s: physical real estate would be whatever that value is. So the difference still in the way that I
4857.68s: think about intrinsic value is that I don't think about like overnight liquidation because that
4863.44s: would infer having to do things at like just a gree just prices, right? Because of the time
4869.52s: bound constraint, you would have to sell things crazy. So I think of it as like a reasonable time
4874.64s: frame for liquidation so that you can get like fair market value for things. So Dan says,
4882.96s: I'm all in on GME. Yeah, that's awesome. I like again, from a trader perspective, the trader has
4888.24s: to do whatever is right for them. In this case, I don't think GME is positioned poorly. I think
4893.76s: that right now it's running again, like kind of consolidation. That's the overall feel that I get
4900.80s: here. We're starting to build out this volume node. You can see it breaking out right here that's
4906.08s: starting to grow and grow and grow. Just as more people transact here. This was also pretty cool
4911.68s: to see people starting to buy in because my original idea, which I was a little bit off,
4918.40s: but it's this I haven't moved this price handle, which was like just around 18. So I used 18 just
4925.84s: because it looked like near term support based on what we saw here. And again, like this is not
4932.48s: something I added after the fact kind of what we were talking about before I added this before we
4937.60s: started getting down here. I added it when we're back up here because I was just curious
4942.64s: where things were looking like they were going. So when I see like price move here, but you can
4950.80s: see volume expanded that day. So it was 93% by volume at 11 million shares where the average at
4957.44s: that point for each day was 12.9 million shares. So that was good to see. That was like a lot of
4963.60s: people buying at a specific value area that they thought. So yeah, that's kind of what I think
4971.20s: about at least the the recent lower volume periods. The options chains have also been much more quiet
4980.56s: than I've typically have seen them, which has been kind of interesting.
4985.84s: Again, let me know whatever else you guys want to look at. I'm going to pivot back over to taking a
4990.64s: look at the rest of this kind of like the new developments in the case. And then but yeah,
4996.96s: like we literally can pivot as much as you guys want. So you can see that there's been a bunch of
5002.00s: stuff going on. So the appearances and stuff. Yeah, this is talking about like summons for things.
5014.56s: Essentially everything has to be logged, but the interesting stuff is way down here.
5020.32s: Down down down down down down. But I think it's attachment five is the
5030.00s: exhibit 40. Let me double check. I think this one is the deposition. Yeah, this is the deposition.
5038.40s: So let me open this one here. And then all as always give you guys the source
5046.00s: so that you can look for yourselves. And we'll grab the text. So
5053.28s: let me see if this starts here. I haven't looked through four yet.
5060.80s: Yes, so I'm okay, here we go. Let's see what this is.
5065.04s: So this is showing price volume data. So we don't have to worry about that. Let's take a look here.
5080.80s: Paul and install says been swinging this from the beginning. I'm feeling great and still transferred
5086.00s: to the purple circle. Yeah, that's great. I think that's awesome. I think something like GameStop
5091.76s: when it's when it has volume, I mean, it has a ton of volatility. It moves all over the place.
5096.32s: It really is a great trading vehicle. So yeah,
5104.40s: Stephen Brown's dropping some random ass stocks in here. So I'm actually going to get rid of those
5109.04s: because we don't need that floating around some random ass bullshit. If we want to take a look at
5114.08s: it together, I'm down, but that didn't look like it. That look like you're just sharing a random ass name.
5118.64s: All right. So let's see. You were investing more money into GameStop. Correct. I've invested since
5124.32s: 2019 and never sold my shares to date and you never shorted. No, not even one, not that I believe.
5135.36s: You don't like short sellers. That's correct.
5139.76s: So the queue obviously is the counter side, the opposition, and then the answer in this case is
5146.64s: I don't know how to go in. I believe you sent out a tweet. 15th May saying taxpayer money should be
5153.68s: spent cracking down on hedge funds and short sellers. Why did you delete the tweet? I don't think so.
5164.00s: So you don't believe that you deleted it. I don't know. Can you show me the tweet? Well, I cannot,
5168.72s: because I couldn't find it. It's not there in your page anymore. So then it was deleted.
5173.76s: So this is really interesting. The reason why attorneys do this is because they're
5183.68s: to like non to the non initiated. A lot of the questions that go down during a deposition can look
5191.84s: really stupid. But in fact, they're not stupid. They're very, very, very educated movements that
5200.64s: they're making because one of the things that they're trying to do is essentially box in
5207.44s: the response is given so that if it goes to trial, they know what he's going to say.
5213.68s: And then if he says something else, he looks, it creates a problem, right? Because then they'll say
5219.92s: something like, oh, well, you said this during under oath, why is it different now? So
5226.96s: that's why they're asking these questions so that if during trial, he contradicts himself in
5232.48s: any way, it again will look not good. Mr. Freena, who is obviously Cohen's attorney, says
5243.76s: objection form witness. No, I don't remember. Well, let me back up a little bit. Did you delete the
5248.48s: tweet? And then so right, like they're trying to box him in just even on this stupid little thing.
5253.60s: The other thing to know about depositions is that it is literally, it's just a war of attrition.
5258.96s: They have a certain amount of time that they can spend with people. And their goal is to ask the
5264.56s: same question in as many permutations as they can. And part of it is just becomes, it becomes like
5270.00s: a metronome. You feel like you're answering the same thing or you feel like you fully answered
5274.24s: a question, but in the attorneys mind you haven't because they want to close out the question.
5278.64s: So that's why you'll see stuff like this. It's like really arduous to get through.
5284.08s: So Cohen says, I've made multiple tweets and comments about the fact that I do not like both
5287.92s: hedge funds and sort sellers. What's the reason for that? I think it's un-American to bet on and
5293.04s: to profit from someone else's failure. It's one thing not to invest in someone's success. That's
5296.88s: another thing to profit from someone's failure. And I think it's un-American. And it's illegal.
5301.36s: And it's legal and they're entitled to it, but I don't like them. Like what a great answer. I
5305.52s: literally love that answer. This says, I mean, that's my opinion. I don't feel as people should
5311.12s: profit on and bet on somebody else is going to fail and employ tactics in order to increase the odds
5317.68s: that they're going to be that they'll end up failing. And that's what a lot of these hedge funds
5321.60s: and sort sellers do. Yeah, that's awesome. Why do you feel so strongly about the fact that they're
5325.28s: un-American when you're not an American citizen? That's so funny. Mr. Frieda says,
5333.44s: objection form. The witness says it's not about being a citizen, being un-American. It doesn't matter
5338.16s: about whether it has nothing to do with citizenship. Then, Jofri says, so then has to do with innovation,
5345.76s: entrepreneurism. The fact that this is the greatest country in the world, less than 5% of the population
5350.48s: is 25% of GDP. So much of innovation come out of America. So then the other side says, let
5358.16s: me get to straight. You don't like short sellers. You want the government to crack down on them,
5361.44s: but you allowed your lawyers in this case to make filing saying that retail investors were croaked
5367.52s: manipulators because they were trying to bet against shorts. objection form.
5374.00s: I don't know what my lawyer said. What I'd say with respect to hedge fund short sellers,
5378.00s: I find it ironic that if you have a large position, you just close that long position. But if you
5381.68s: have a short, but if you short that position, there's not the same kind of disclosure requirements,
5385.68s: which is a really great point. But I believe there should be more transparency. This is just
5390.40s: absolutely like I love this. Holland install says the vagueness in RC replies is defining to the
5398.64s: ears. I think you might have meant deafening to their ears, hearts and minds. I love it. Yeah. Well,
5404.40s: the other reason why he would answer like this is because if he's talking about like a previous
5410.00s: recollection of some time ago, again, like he also doesn't want to contradict himself. So his
5414.96s: council, they will coach him on how to answer all of this stuff. So that's why a lot of the
5420.96s: responses are going to be broader in nature because he's again, being advised by really smart
5428.80s: attorneys and he's doing his best to fall in line with again, the coaching that he got.
5435.52s: But you said more than that, they're against entrepreneurship on Americans. So it's not just about
5440.00s: the disclosures. It's more than right. More than that, right? And then the attorney, the
5446.40s: opposition says, so I'm going to back to the questions about the filing in this case. Are you
5450.88s: aware that there's a motion for class certification that's pending in this case? He asks, do you
5457.84s: understand what it is? Then Mr. Farina, which is Cohen's attorney says, I don't think he can have
5464.64s: an understanding other than what he obtained from council. Then the other side says it's a public
5470.24s: document. He can have an understanding of a public document. And then he goes on to say, unless Mr.
5478.24s: Farina tells you not to address my question, you have to address my question, would you like me
5482.64s: to repeat it? Then Farina says, well, if you can address the question without anything that you've
5487.44s: learned from your lawyer, why don't you go ahead and repeat the question? So they asked the question
5492.16s: again, have you read the motion for the certification and what's filed in this case? So now the attorneys
5498.88s: are going back and forth. I'm not going to go through all of that. So right now what they're trying
5505.04s: to do is they're playing a game of like gotcha, right? They're just trying to see if they can get
5509.92s: them to say something or do something. And I think, yeah, they're just trying to play gotcha,
5518.48s: which is just super annoying. My question was, are you were the fact that your attorneys in your name
5524.64s: have argued that the fact that people couldn't short BBB Y stock enough meant that the market for
5530.56s: that stock was inefficient? So for those that don't know, one of the arguments for efficient markets
5537.60s: is the ability to short things because sometimes we know traders can bid things up to nosebleed levels
5545.20s: and sometimes it's based on like FOMO euphoria. It's not based on the actual value of the company
5550.72s: itself necessarily. So one of the arguments for short selling is that it does technically make
5556.40s: markets more efficient by starting to press down some of that value until enough people oppose
5562.64s: the selling value, which would likely denote some sort of equilibrium where we both agree the short
5568.72s: sellers are like, okay, well, there's enough buyers here. I can't press it down anymore. So this is
5575.04s: where people actually think the stock is worth. That's kind of the general argument behind it.
5582.00s: So they're just fighting back and forth. I think we can skip through some of that.
5588.88s: This they're talking about attorney, client privilege, right? So they're not talking about answering
5594.96s: conversations behind these. Alfonso says not for nothing, but Cohen bought his most recent shares
5601.84s: in GM E in March 22 and then liquid dated all BBY shares five months after mid August in 22 RC
5609.04s: ventures, most recent 30 F only holds GM E. Yeah, well, I think in this case, a lot of that is because
5615.36s: he realized that he was going to run into structural issues when he was trying to get kind of start
5620.32s: angling into best buy. That was going to cause him problems. So I think that's why he started his
5625.28s: unwind. Ars says, what stops shorting from just being bidding down problems the way bidding
5631.44s: up was a problem. It's inefficiency in both directions, isn't it? Well, that's the idea, though,
5637.20s: is that because both directions are possible is that it would gain efficiency. So again,
5642.64s: you can have something to your point that gets bid down like, for example, a great example of this,
5648.00s: I think, is crowd strike. And again, full disclosure, I traded this because this movement. So this
5655.12s: was bid down into the dirt until people started to buy it. And then now it's obviously moving
5661.60s: back up towards some sort of accepted value, broad accepted value for the price of the underlying.
5669.52s: Now this will happen, though, because of information in discreteness, it takes time for information
5677.68s: to permeate through a market and then to be positioned by people. So this kind of thing, again, is
5685.36s: because I sold this short to the downwind and sell it short, I don't typically use that. I use
5689.60s: options to trade it to the downside. But as it's running to the downside, then there's a bunch
5698.40s: of different reasons why this gets sent down so far until enough buyers start to step in. They're
5704.48s: like, okay, well, I actually really like this all the way down here at 200. So the short seller
5710.00s: start to get tired. This movement becomes the representation of the failure that they had in the
5717.44s: systems, which overall to me didn't look quite that pervasive. So ape of spade says we already
5724.88s: have that it's called selling not so much. Selling again, it doesn't have the same effect as shorting
5732.56s: because selling it's almost like the removal of something, but it's not the active suppression of
5741.52s: something. So they're kind of different effects. I wouldn't equate the process of like selling out
5748.32s: of a position as short selling. Apospeed says supply and demand can still exist. Yeah, of course.
5755.92s: Yeah, no doubt. There's absolutely no doubt. Again, I'm not arguing that short selling has to exist.
5761.60s: I'm not saying that at all, but I'm simply talking about the way that people and again, like from
5768.16s: an objective analysis standpoint on why it's argued that short selling increases market efficiency,
5774.96s: because again, like arguably it does. So to ape of spade's point, and I get the point totally,
5782.48s: that essentially we can get to a point where like here that enough people are like, okay,
5787.52s: I don't think crowd is, crowd strike is worth more than this. So then from here,
5795.60s: they stop buying and then price naturally could start to drift sideways. But if you have people that
5801.84s: can actively sell against it, the process would happen faster because there's kind of a counter
5805.92s: opposing force. Ars says I'm not arguing against short selling. I'm just skeptical of efficiency
5811.52s: arguments. I don't know why. I mean, the the process of identifying like activities that make
5818.48s: markets more efficient are kind of easy and clear to see. Now, the secondary and tertiary effects
5825.44s: of those obviously is up for debate. And then whether or not we like the practice in and of itself
5832.16s: is obviously up for debate. But again, like I can look at something like payment for order flow.
5837.60s: And that's it's objectively made markets more efficient. We might not like it. We might not
5843.60s: like elements of it. I don't. I think it creates some fucked up incentives. But I can still look
5850.32s: back 50 years. And I can say markets now are more efficient. And one reason for it, I'm not saying
5856.72s: the only reason, but one reason for it is because of payment for order flow. So if you have people
5862.32s: competing to obtain order flow, that competition will make things slightly more efficient. Your
5868.24s: order execution, your bit asks spread, your price improvement. Again, I don't think payment for
5872.48s: order flow is great. I think there are better systems. It's not my favorite thing in the world.
5876.16s: But it's not it's not the again, like the the boogie man, um,
5885.20s: ape of spade says with efficiency can comes conflict of interest. Why I think anything related
5890.16s: to financial markets is going to bring conflict of interest. So yeah, R says I don't think market
5898.88s: participants are motivated in their moves to make markets objective. I think profit is created
5904.96s: from differentials from price movement. So to profit, you want price to move, right?
5913.36s: I'm not totally following the first part of your argument there. But yeah, for the second part,
5918.48s: I would agree with you that in order to make money, you would want price to move in some sort of
5923.92s: direction. If you're buying equity or selling equity, if you're buying or selling a product,
5930.16s: you would want it to move. I agree with that. Yeah. Dr. Zay says more efficient in this context is a
5935.76s: step in the wrong direction for most people. Yeah, again, I'm not sure I would fully agree with
5942.08s: that. I like markets now more than when I first started trading. I and that's for a bunch of
5948.00s: different reasons. Not only is it cheaper from a commission standpoint, but I get better
5952.64s: fills. Markets are now much narrower. So yeah, I mean, for me, I think markets being more efficient
5961.04s: now is good for me. So again, like if that's the ultimate stop or if people want it to be more
5968.16s: efficient, I think that's a completely fair argument. And I think we're in a position that
5971.04s: markets can be more efficient than they are now. I agree with that. Willie says can it be argued
5979.44s: that payment for order flow contributes to monoplystic practices? I agree. Yeah. Now places like
5985.76s: Citadel and Virtue, they're not necessarily the only entities that can enter or can run payment
5991.84s: for order flow. Other people can enter that market, but it's really competitive and it's hard to
5996.88s: break into. It's kind of like the search engine market, right? Like could there are there competitors
6003.92s: for Google? Sure. But it's really difficult to compete in that space. That's what makes Ryan
6009.76s: Cohen, I think so fascinating because he was able to compete with Amazon with something like Chewie,
6016.24s: which is not an easy online market, especially from a logistics standpoint. So that kind of thing
6022.96s: is crazy that he was able to do what he was and he was very successful. So yeah, I think that
6030.40s: Willie, to your point, I agree with that. But Willie says payment for order flow itself is not a bad
6036.24s: thing in itself, but when a handful of firms that have that power, it can be abused. Absolutely
6040.00s: zero debate. Completely agree with that. I also would even take that argument a step further
6046.16s: and say that payment for order flow itself is I actually don't love that as an incentive.
6051.84s: I think it should be an open competition for order flow. Like I don't think it should be bundled
6058.08s: because from an execution standpoint that actually disincentivizes the optimal order routing
6063.76s: for your transaction, which is really frustrating. But again, like even though that's the case,
6070.40s: the order routing, even though it's not optimal, it's still better than what it was. This is the
6076.16s: nature of the game is that it's not exactly black and white. There are shades of gray that have to
6081.52s: be considered, I think, in order for it to be like a good discussion about the structure of markets.
6088.80s: So I completely agree with you, Willie. I think that anytime you have money involved, lots of money,
6098.16s: there's going to be bad actors. That is how it's always going to go. As soon as there are
6105.84s: large buckets of money that are accessible, there will be bad actors. I guarantee it. Always going
6112.08s: to be the case. And that's just how things go. Like the people that want to try to take advantage of
6118.72s: things, they're always there. And they shape shift over time, but they're still there. They just
6124.96s: take different forms as things evolve. Fonsus is home computers and the internet have brought
6131.60s: efficiency. I remember my dad getting phone calls it dinner to confirm his traits that he
6135.44s: placed by his phone earlier. Yeah, that's hilarious. That's so true. Beach says, who do you have in
6141.04s: the UFC main event tonight? I don't know who's in the UFC tonight. I was looking at the Craig Jones
6147.28s: invitational first. I really want to see him in Gabby, because I just think that's going to be
6152.00s: hilarious. I also want to know who won it. I haven't I was watching yesterday's stuff earlier.
6156.96s: So let me see it. The UFC card tonight was that is that easy and do plusy tonight?
6162.00s: Or am I making that up? It is. Oh man. Man, that's a toughy.
6175.92s: That is such a tough. That is such a tough card. Who's the what are the odds on it?
6194.16s: So it has is easy. It is easy is the minus 130. I could see that. I mean, from a striking
6203.84s: perspective, I would have to give it to Izzy from a striking perspective. No doubt. But
6211.04s: Izzy, I feel like he hasn't really been showing up as he like as good as he has been. Even like
6218.32s: that fight with Strickland showed that. So it would not shock me to see do plusy win. But
6230.32s: like I would have to agree with the odds on Izzy. I think that that's a fair I think that's a fair
6236.72s: line. Now you got me looking at oh, how did Jenkins do? He won. That's good.
6248.96s: I'm glad Jenkins won. All right. I'll get out of UFC. You fucking sent me down a tangent. You always
6254.08s: know I'm down to look at some fight stuff. But yeah, I would I would have to lean towards Izzy
6261.68s: personally. All right. Let's poke through this a little bit more. And then I want to take a look
6266.00s: at Chewy a little bit. No, it says Chewy calls when kind of crazy Friday afternoon. Yeah, we'll take
6273.92s: a look at that for sure. I'm trying to see if there's any other like really interesting
6283.68s: bits that they got out of here. This looks interesting.
6295.44s: Q. No, it's in it. But I think that my question is a little different, which is when it comes to
6301.04s: those people who interpret your tweets, like the ones you discussed with Joe Fonacelo,
6306.40s: like people on Twitter who respond with your tweets, you've never tried to correct them in any
6311.68s: way and say that you are misunderstanding what I meant. My tweets are just being or just me being
6319.20s: me there. I don't know what tweets you're referring to. I don't know what comments you're talking
6323.52s: about. And you're again, you're talking about people as in they are speaking in generalities.
6330.16s: So if you have a specific question, I'll answer it, but I don't understand these generalities.
6333.60s: It's impossible to answer the question. That's a great, that's a great response, by the way.
6337.04s: So right now, it seems like what they're trying to do is to start creating a line between his tweets
6347.44s: as possible drivers of movement. And in this line of questioning, they're trying to say, well,
6353.52s: you're not necessarily outright saying, you know, you listen to these things of what I'm doing,
6359.60s: but you're also not correcting people when they're misinterpreting your stuff.
6364.56s: So they're trying to catch them with like the null is what that looks like, which is against
6370.00s: super annoying. I'm specifically referring to Twitter, yes, in which comment on Twitter and
6374.72s: which posts that I make any comment, do you recall even one instance? I rarely reply to my comments.
6379.44s: Sure, that's not my question, Mr. Cohen. Do you recall even one instance where you posted something
6384.16s: in someone interpreted a meaning and you said, that's not correct? I don't remember. That's hilarious.
6389.12s: And it looks like the reporter needed to take a break.
6393.44s: There. Can we focus on the final sentence here in the third paragraph? You know the one that
6399.68s: started with as a role model among apes? We talked that about it already. You know, in that final
6405.12s: sentence here, yeah. When it says any news about the investors often enough to generate positive
6411.12s: sentiment among apes active on Reddit, hey, shout out to you guys. Do you see that? Yes. Okay.
6418.56s: Now have you seen another article saying that they have that specific thing that we just read to
6423.76s: you? I don't remember. Okay. But you may have no. I meant I don't. What I said is I don't remember.
6431.60s: Okay. Now you've never eat. Now you've never gone. Shit, I fucked that up. Sorry. Now you've never
6438.40s: gone ever publicly and said, I'm not a role model for the apes. I don't believe so. Okay. And you've
6444.96s: never gone and publicly said, I've never said I'm a role model for the apes either. Please let me
6449.76s: finish my question. That's just jockeying for a position. You never gone and said that you're not
6455.44s: influential among this community of retail investors. I've never said that I was. That wasn't my
6460.00s: question. You've never said that you weren't. Correct. So that that's all this is they are trying
6466.56s: to catch him with noils, right? Because obviously like who would go on social media? And for example,
6474.32s: with Jeffrey Epstein and all the bull crap that he did did everybody have to go on social media
6482.56s: and be like, I don't agree with that. No, like it's kind of inherent that what the did what the
6490.72s: dude did was shitty. And it was like most people don't agree with that. So in this case, they're
6497.60s: they're trying to start lining them up for well, you've never explicitly said, you're not this
6503.92s: thing, which is crazy. Absolutely crazy, especially because the way he communicates on
6510.00s: Twitter or X, right? Like if you look through his stuff, a lot of it is jokes like this.
6519.76s: Like he's just playing games. So that's like the whole the whole point of he's a troll. So
6529.12s: this is kind of nuts. Okay, you have publicly said nothing in fact to assert that you do not
6536.00s: influence stock prices like this. Who would go out of their way to say like I don't influence stock
6544.88s: prices? I don't believe so. And you've never said that I Ryan Cohen don't generate positive sentiment
6552.64s: among meme stock investors on Reddit. This I never said I do, but you've never said I didn't,
6560.32s: right? I don't believe so. So you never contested any of. So then he goes into investment advice stuff.
6569.76s: My question wasn't about, you know, whether you should provide an investment advice, your question
6575.12s: is putting words in my mouth. Yeah, yeah, you're this, honestly, this, this from the door, leave that.
6586.16s: This from the attorney is hilarious from the opposing counsel. This is this is literally
6591.84s: hilarious. You're giving me a justification for why you didn't do this. I understand I'm not
6597.20s: interested in I don't care. It's just a funny line from the from the opposing counsel.
6606.08s: Alfonso says, must trolls much, much harder than Cohen must absolutely does. That's the funny part
6611.04s: is that a lot of these guys are just trolling, but in this case, they're trying to they're trying to
6615.44s: use it against them. My question is very, very simple. You've never gone and said something like,
6620.96s: you know, please stop saying that I generate positive sentiment against these so-called apes on
6625.44s: Reddit. You never done that answer. I've answered your question, which is a yes that you've never
6630.08s: done it. I answered your question. What was the answer? Is it a yes or no? It's a simple yes or no.
6634.96s: You can go through the transcript and you'll see my answer. Well, I think you said yes to some
6641.04s: of the things and I don't know why you're struggling so much with this one. Again, this is this is
6646.24s: quintessential. They're trying to fatigue him. That's why Cohen is starting to answer like this
6652.00s: because he's starting to become slightly belligerent and this actually doesn't normally
6657.76s: bowed well for his argument because it does make him start to look slightly belligerent. I would
6663.20s: understand why I would be furious with this. This would get so old, so fast, but it's also
6671.36s: it's part of the game and it's why they're doing this. Is they're purposely trying to they're
6677.28s: trying to do this? So then when I told you have you ever said for instance that you don't have
6686.72s: influence on stock prices, you said that you haven't. So this is a very similar question. It's just
6691.68s: about a different topic, which is have you ever said that you don't generate positive sentiment
6695.92s: among the apes on Reddit publicly? I don't know. You haven't, right? No, I mean, I don't know.
6700.48s: You don't recall any instance, right? So again, this is them trying to close out the topic.
6705.36s: Recall any instance. It's very purposely phrased like that. These these can seem like really
6713.52s: stupid questions and they kind of are in a sense, but they're really calculated. I just try to remind
6719.12s: you guys of that because some people can look at this and kind of just think like, oh, what what is
6723.44s: all this buffoonery? But it's actually really, really tactical what they're trying to do.
6729.36s: You don't recall any instance. You can't tell me one example where you have publicly said it. I
6732.80s: don't know. Okay. I don't remember every single thing that I've said. So then
6745.04s: very, very short transformation that the company, especially going into a macro time,
6748.40s: a lot of uncertainty given the balance. She you see all that, right? Yep. So he's obviously
6752.40s: talking about a specific documentation or tweet that he said. He said, so when you said that,
6758.24s: I you, is it true that you said that to the company did not have the balance sheet to transform
6763.60s: the business answer. I don't remember exactly. These are not my notes. Okay. But do you believe that
6768.72s: the company did not have the balance sheet to do a transformation? I believe that the company
6772.72s: was doing a lot worse than I expected and losing a lot of money. I didn't have visibility obviously
6777.60s: into the future trajectory, but based on what I saw in the previous corner, the company was using
6781.92s: a lot of money. So again, they're trying to now tie Cohen to the perception of the stock,
6788.80s: which was one of the things if you remember from the first document that they're trying to contest
6792.56s: that they were providing a skewed perception of the stock. Let's see. The final section of
6801.84s: the page here says again, is attributed to you. It says RCD. Do you see that? But operationalizing
6806.56s: a plan. You see that. So it says, but operationalizing a plan SGNA at 33% is insustainable in GM
6814.00s: contracting by 400 BPS. So back to SGNA mid 20% will involve pretty significant changes in the
6820.72s: company, given the macro backdrop we're heading into probably some big changes. Is it true that
6827.28s: you wanted the company to come back to cut back on its SGNA expenses to get it down to the mid 20%?
6832.40s: I wanted them to reduce expenses. Yes, to mid 20%. I mean, that sounded like a good target.
6838.56s: That number happened while you were invested. Correct? I don't believe so.
6842.80s: And then the answer says, and then over here, does this jog your memory where it says we
6846.80s: scrap the 2020 plan? I don't remember that. I think it was, and this is a funny comment.
6856.80s: I think this was 150 page. God knows what they paid McKinsey to to talking about how they were
6862.48s: going to have private label, all kinds of things. And I thought it was crazy. And I said in the letter,
6866.72s: I thought it was crazy. Did it? But they never changed their behavior. So they're just going back
6871.60s: and forth now about the operation of the company and how it was doing.
6878.16s: Let's see. So this one says, so you wrote, given that I'm going to be in the market buying,
6882.88s: I'd like to cancel the call and ask her to speak next week. No, let's says so as an activist
6887.76s: investor, he RC ran into resistance from the board on the direction he was interested in taking
6892.96s: the company that definitely seems part of it. I don't know exactly what ended up making him divest.
6898.88s: So let's see. I'll ask Chattat Gpt. When Ryan Cohen bought into BBBY, what ended up making him divest?
6912.24s: Let's see what that comes up with.
6915.28s: After initially buying into the company earlier that year, the decision to the FS was interested
6922.32s: influenced by a combination of factors, including the lack of substantial progress
6925.84s: in turning around the company, as well as growing concerns about the financial stability.
6930.64s: So I think there was a lot more to it than that. I don't remember all the details,
6935.12s: but I know that there was a significant change in the backdrop.
6940.24s: And he definitely didn't like the direction that things were going. Now I also think that there
6946.56s: was a couple of forcing functions that came with his size that he came in at. And then what he was
6952.16s: trying to grow up into. A fun says, but the lawsuit asked for a return of short swing profits
6957.52s: on his sale of BBBY Shales Persection SEC rule 16B. Yeah.
6964.24s: Alfonso says, I don't see any impact on GME. Well, I think the impact that this can have on GME
6968.80s: is that while Ryan Cohen is wrapped up in any sort of litigation, it just is immediately going
6975.92s: to complicate other stuff that he does to your point. I don't think that this prevents him from
6980.88s: running GME. I don't think that this has a direct impact on GME. But I would kind of
6988.00s: I would frame it that there's a secondary and a tertiary effect that this will have on GME.
6993.76s: Just again, in the sense that the CEO of GME is wrapped up in this other litigation.
6998.80s: So even down to as simple as this is something on the back of his mind that he has to deal with
7005.52s: while he's trying to run another company that again, like we have to be honest with ourselves.
7009.84s: GameStop has to innovate here. It has to change things quite a bit in order to kind of really rise
7015.44s: into what it can be. And that requires a ton of effort. And for most CEOs, that is a full time
7022.96s: effort. It's not like I have to spend 30% of my time dealing with this case and then 70% of my
7029.12s: time trying to grow this company. Most of those kinds of transformations take like the majority
7034.88s: of effort. So even from just a drain perspective, this in my opinion will have an impact.
7041.52s: Hopefully, and I think so far he's done a great job. Like he's obviously super resilient.
7046.32s: This isn't like killing him or anything. You can even tell from the way that he's trolling and
7050.56s: still having fun. But again, it's just in the backdrop. It's something that's there.
7056.48s: Raspberry pizza says it's the BBYC in the board leading up to the bankruptcy that totally misled
7062.08s: people that need to be sued straight up lies. That's kind of the general thing that I've been
7067.36s: noticing. It looks like he's been wrapped into this for a few different reasons. So here,
7074.72s: they're he's talking about like what he's gotten into and why.
7082.64s: This is interesting. Did you know, did you question her about whether there was bankruptcy risk?
7086.56s: I don't believe so. So we'll show you one dot. So this is also really common, which is super
7091.44s: annoying. So a lot of times in these kind of depositions, the council will ask you about something
7098.88s: that they already have shit on and they won't show it to you unless you ask for it and you know
7104.56s: to ask for it. So in this case, when he said, you know, did you question her about whether there's
7109.12s: bankruptcy risk? I don't believe so. And then he says, oh, well, let's take a look at this document.
7114.16s: Right. So it's like those kinds of things are really, really frustrating because it's so easy
7120.40s: than to double back on yourself unnecessarily.
7128.96s: I'm just seeing if there's anything else that like really sticks out to me as I scan through it.
7133.44s: This overall just looks like kind of a standard deposition. I like a lot of the things that
7138.08s: Cohen said. I think he's handling it overall really, really well. But as you can tell, it's just
7144.72s: tiring. Like it's just annoying to go through this.
7153.60s: If you're going to ask him about the motion, then show him the motion and ask him whether it's
7157.36s: like this is another, that's funny that I stopped here. This is another like
7162.24s: very specific example about this very specific thing. So he said, the next thing I want to
7167.28s: just, are you aware of the factual representation on your behalf that were made in the motion to dismiss
7172.88s: about this tweet? Right. So like, again, he's asking him about a document and he hasn't shown
7178.80s: him the document. So his lawyer is like, yo, if you're going to ask him about this thing,
7183.20s: then show it to him and then ask him about it. So
7189.36s: for instance, I would suggest you take the document if you want to ask him about it.
7193.44s: Right. So yeah, it's just like standard super annoying lame practice, but it's how it gets done.
7200.40s: This stuff is so annoying, man. Oh, I saw the word trading. Hold on, I got to look.
7207.36s: You want to know how long this will take? Am I prevented from trading? In the mean time,
7212.08s: can this be done today? The answer I was not trading. So then they're saying they're questioning.
7217.60s: So then why were you telling him that you, why were you questioning him about whether or not you
7222.96s: could prevent from trading? Because my bank told me that I was prevented from trading.
7227.04s: I told him what the bank said. Okay. And why did you contact the bank? Because I was interested
7232.56s: in being able to trade. Being able to trade and do what? That being able to trade, sell,
7240.00s: depending on the price. So you were thinking of buying shares on this day, depending on what
7244.56s: the price would have been. So they're going back and forth now about like this trading thing.
7250.32s: Did you have a thought in your head on this day that you might be that you might buy shares of
7254.40s: BVY? My dog is letting me know I need to open the door.
7269.84s: I think for him, he's going to go now how and I'm going to text my wife real quick and ask her
7276.00s: to feed him. Because I believe that's what he's looking for. He's looking for his dinner,
7282.08s: rightfully so it's about dinner time. I think my barbecue should be here in a little bit.
7287.52s: Depending on the price, which what he would have done obviously, but my question is nothing to do
7292.08s: with the response. My question was whether at any point you thought about buying shares on August
7297.52s: 15th. I don't remember what I was thinking on that day. Okay. So since it's based on your testimony,
7303.36s: then you obviously didn't tell Nebel on this day that you were selling shares correct. I was not
7308.32s: selling shares on that day. So you only told him that you were trading. I told him what's in the
7313.36s: email that you were contemplating trading. He was in communication with the bank that I was contemplating
7320.48s: trading and that I wanted the option to be able to trade. So this is just this is going back to trying
7325.44s: to contradict his intent. They're trying to say like you were doing this one thing but you were
7330.32s: talking about this other thing. I wonder what the average duration is for a deposition because I
7340.40s: actually think there's rules about how long it can go for. How long can a deposition go for?
7352.56s: The duration can vary widely depending on the complexity, the number of parties, generally depositions
7357.84s: last a few hours but they can extend to a full day or even multiple days. In federal cases,
7363.36s: there is typically a seven hour limit for a deposition in a single day unless the court orders
7369.52s: otherwise. Although however the parties can agree to extend this time if necessary, that's brutal
7373.60s: man. They imagine doing this for seven hours. Seven hours. Shit. Again, this goes back to
7385.28s: to I think it was Alfonso's point about the impact to me. That's an impact. Man, I'm fatigued
7392.24s: just trying to read this. You can see he's starting to get more and more frustrated. Literally even
7398.24s: in his written responses, I can see him becoming more belligerent. That's my statement. Those are not
7404.24s: my words. These are his. He's becoming more and more belligerent. Right. Fully so. I would be too.
7411.92s: This is absolutely exhausting to deal with. How does this end? I just feel like this.
7423.12s: I just feel like even the council is getting upset. It's not surprising. So anyways, that looks like
7433.84s: the heart and soul of the overall deposition, which bam, bro. I just opened that one. I'm just
7445.52s: seeing if there's anything else interesting in here.
7447.28s: Yeah.
7452.08s: A sedric is asking for the link again. You got it. Here is the link right there.
7471.52s: You got it, Cedric. Anything else we want to take a look at? That was kind of fun.
7476.88s: I wanted to spend a little time going through the case just because I was really interested to
7482.48s: again, learn a little bit more about how he handled the situation, what it looked like,
7488.24s: what kind of things they're talking about. And also to Alfonso's point, what kind of potential
7492.08s: impacts that I think it could have in his operation of something like GameStop. If there's any
7497.36s: potential carryover and again, I don't really see a lot of that. I just see a really arduous,
7503.84s: annoying process to have to tolerate. That's what it looks like. It doesn't look fun.
7508.08s: It looks like a lot of effort that goes into answering the same questions over and over again,
7512.96s: which looks like pretty freaking fatiguing to me, to be honest. So that's what I have for that.
7518.48s: Now the other thing I did want to look at quickly before I wrap is Chewie.
7524.72s: And it's because Chewie has been starting to gain some legs,
7530.80s: little bit different here. And you can see where I got interested in Chewie.
7534.32s: So as soon as it broke above this 2524 handle is when I started biting a little bit. I don't have
7541.68s: a big position, but I definitely am interested in seeing where this runs to the upside. If it does,
7548.32s: and I mean, if it stops me out at 2524, I don't really care. It's not really...
7553.76s: It's not going to hurt me. That would just be flat on the trade.
7556.64s: Razberry says nice to see RC in action. Dudes and mystery amazed that he even did that GME interview.
7564.08s: Yeah, I agree. Because that's an exactly to your point, Razberry. Because we don't have a chance.
7569.52s: He's not doing stuff like this. He's not jumping on a bunch of live streams. He's not doing
7574.40s: a ton of other things. Afonzo says, is this for non-payment of BCG for consulting services?
7580.56s: It's completely different. I think that's already done and gone.
7583.44s: The... This case is clearly more so about manipulation. So they're trying to frame it as if he knew
7591.76s: BBBY was doing terribly, and he was putting out a different message so that then he could sell his
7597.60s: shares for a profit. That's essentially what they're trying to say. So...
7604.32s: I think that other madness with BCG is a completely different thing.
7607.20s: I think that was like $30 million or something in unpaid stuff to them, which up to that was pretty
7615.12s: interesting. But yeah, anyways. So, Chewie's been looking interesting. It does have earnings coming up
7626.24s: on the 28th. So that's part of the activity that you see there. And then GME has earnings
7633.52s: still coming up on what is it the 4th? September 4th, I believe. I don't know why it's not showing up
7644.16s: on this one. Normally it does. Let me... Yeah. It might be just because there's too much crap on here
7661.84s: right now on this one over here. But yeah. So this... And the reason why that's been so
7668.40s: interesting is because the expiration that contains earnings is so low. I would expect this to be
7674.88s: much higher, but it's not. I haven't really been able to make quite heads or tails on that just yet.
7683.60s: But you can see that the options chain has now just become so anemic after everything from the
7690.64s: past week was stripped out. The bulk, obviously, of the volume was in the last expiration cycle.
7696.00s: And now you can also see that the open interest across the board is just a crap shoot. It's all
7701.28s: over the place. But the bigger positions are actually pretty far out in time.
7708.56s: There's 17 Jan 25. Like we don't have a bunch here yet in 23.
7713.04s: The next primary expiration is 27, which there's just not much build out yet.
7722.56s: Nola says it makes all the social media post up for microscopic scrutiny even up to today.
7728.48s: Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. That's one of the most annoying parts about that. It essentially
7733.76s: makes everything under scrutiny. Even if he was texting with his friends and having
7740.24s: like a standard joke between friends, that can be added as evidence for whatever reason.
7746.16s: I'm not saying it in this case, but in general, they'll purposely go through literally, literally
7751.36s: everything, which is super annoying. Now, to your point, though, it's also, I think, one of the
7759.68s: reasons why he's trolling the way that he is because it's kind of continuing to second the fact
7765.68s: that he's a troll. He enjoys just playing jokes and not taking it super seriously.
7774.00s: Raspberry says, hoping to get out of my 20 steps unscathed and throw that into Jan's.
7780.16s: Yeah, the problem with 20 step is depending on the position, you're going to start running into
7787.44s: pretty accelerated faded decay. So, Fonsus says, Chewie volume doesn't see to be linked to share
7795.60s: price. What do you mean? Chewie. What do you mean? Willis? It looks like it's definitely linked here.
7807.12s: Big drive up here. Big drive up here here. I think it does.
7817.20s: We talk about this move, even this move. It's important to, I think, it's important to keep
7825.20s: things in context. So, this move here, the 20-day average volume is going to be super skewed
7835.36s: by this stuff. So, let me grab this really quick. I have another version of this.
7845.76s: Is this... Yeah, okay, this is the right one.
7855.76s: So, I'm just going to swap it out so that you can see a little bit. But, Fonsus, what's your
7870.32s: specific question? Because to me, I actually don't... I don't follow your point. Because to me, I feel
7878.24s: feel like it's there. No, it says those are pure green volume. Exactly. So, to me, it's like massive,
7886.16s: massive buying pressure.
7896.56s: If I change... Where am I at? Oops.
7901.04s: So, if I change this, let's do, instead of 20, let's do what the past...
7912.24s: 10 days looks fine. So, if you do 10-day, M-A there. Yeah. So, even this is
7919.52s: exceeding the 10-day average. So, like, the previous 10 days in here, which is getting rid of this.
7927.68s: But, the volume on this day was 4.8 million, which was 93% by volume. And then the average
7934.48s: volume at that point for the day in total was 4.686 million. So, it literally had more by
7941.84s: only volume on that day than the total average for the past 10 days. So, yeah, I'm not exactly
7948.72s: sure what you're looking at, but for me, that looks super bullish. Again, it's all in context.
7956.00s: It's none of these things typically are going to be, you know, like the most discrete answers
7961.60s: or the clearest things on planet Earth. But, at least for me, like, volume is pretty consistent.
7967.76s: So, like, here, on most of these upmoves, like, I can see volume behaving a certain kind of way.
7974.96s: So, yeah, to me, I feel like chewy volume, just like anything else. I don't think it's specific
7980.24s: to chewy or really anything. Like, if you look at GameStop, we were just looking at this.
7984.48s: The upward price move that it had here. It was definitely, again, if I close this time frame down,
7991.44s: it will be about close to average, but it's like all by volume. So, there's definitely people
7997.92s: that are looking to get along the product. So, all right, gang, I think this might be my longest
8006.48s: live stream ever, but super, super fun. Love hanging out with you guys. Like I said, I'm in,
8011.36s: I was just chatting with Newton to see what we want to try to set up another joint session to,
8016.16s: you know, see what's good for his schedule. I know he's getting busy now with the school year
8019.36s: starting and stuff. But as always, whatever you guys need, just let me know. Hit me up in the
8023.44s: discord. You can hit me up on the video comments or whatever works for you works for me. But
8028.96s: I always love doing this with you all. I think next week, I'll either do this on Thursday or Saturday
8035.92s: undecided yet. But I'm going to keep the cadence going. Once I start something, I tend to
8041.12s: keep doing it. So, we have daily live streams and we have one weekly live stream that is dedicated
8046.64s: to taking a look at all of the GME and peripheral stories. So, that's the point of this.
8051.28s: And if there's ever anything that you want to look at in those, just let me know. I love trying
8056.00s: to integrate as much of the stuff that's interesting to you guys into them so that we can spend time
8061.04s: looking at what you want to see. So, let me know if you have anything being outlier, being ape.
8066.08s: And I'll see you guys later.
