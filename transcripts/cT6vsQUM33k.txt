0.00s:  What is up to the ape outliers for today? We have kind of a mixed docket. I want to spend
9.72s:  a little time going through the bed bath and beyond case because I think that that's
14.48s:  generally interesting. And then there was a couple other questions that we got in the
19.88s:  discord that I want to hit. And as always, whatever you all decide that we should talk about,
26.88s:  we should take a look. So anything that you want to hit throat in the chat, we can dip
31.52s:  dive, duck, dodge and dodge any direction that we want, dive into whatever. Unfortunately,
37.32s:  our boy Newton is still slightly under the weather. So he and I were texting to figure
43.64s:  out when we want to do our next session, but he's just looking to kind of, you know, take
47.72s:  it easy this weekend, rightfully. So he's been working a lot now and live streams, I love
53.12s:  him, but they do kind of require a lot of focus in order for it to be kind of a good conversation,
58.96s:  right? So he's keeping it chill for himself. So make sure you all send your best wishes to our
65.68s:  boy Newton. And I were talking a little bit, he actually had a couple recommendations. I always
69.84s:  like to talk to him about what he thinks we should take a look at. And he had two things that he
76.32s:  brought up. He thinks we should take a look at Causing Chewie. And then he also wants to take
83.04s:  a look at some, he suggested that we take a look at some of Roaring Kitty's charts is the last
89.12s:  that I got. So I think we will dive through those. Also, we have somebody in the chat name,
95.52s:  California pizza is best, who you, you just know that probably a great person, but they are just
104.16s:  trying to start some shit is what I think because it is objectively probably some of the worst
111.36s:  pizza I've ever had. I've had better pizza in Las Vegas than I've had in California. And I'm from
116.96s:  New York. So I do have a lot of respect. And that's where I think the best pizza is I would not call
123.44s:  it California by any stretch of the imagination, but I have to imagine our friend California pizza is
129.28s:  best knows exactly what they're doing. So shout out to them for ruffling people's feathers because
134.24s:  that can always be kind of fun. All right, let's see who we got in the chat. I see
140.40s:  PFA, Nola, Ron, ape of spades. That's a great name. ape of spades. Eating crayons. I second that
148.72s:  with you. Shrey J is here. We got California pizza is best, which again, I probably don't have to
154.96s:  argue against. Sadrick is here. Chris is here. Somewhere nowhere. That's kind of tricky. I guess
161.92s:  it's nowhere as in they know where. That's pretty good. Let me grab this chat move it over here.
168.64s:  So it's a little easier for me to keep up with you guys. Mark says, John's of bleaker best pizza in
175.28s:  New York City. I don't I'm not sure if I've had theirs before, but I think really when it comes down
180.88s:  to where the best pizza actually is a lot of it comes down to like what hits up like nostalgia
186.40s:  metrics because I remember as a kid, my favorite place was Tommy's in in the Bronx. Love that
192.80s:  place. But yeah, I think a lot of it also comes down to like just what yeah, like what nostalgia
199.60s:  buttons get hit. Snehill, Veyha says, sir, no, Richard Newton. No, so Newton is not available to
208.32s:  join us today. Like I said, I still think that he's trying to like completely recover because he
212.96s:  also started like his standard work. And it's a lot of work. One, doing all the game stop stuff.
219.12s:  And then also doing like his standard job picking up. And he was sick most of last week.
224.08s:  So day swag says, also, I like that you know, Newberg. I literally grew up there. So I went to
229.84s:  NFA and went to South. I know Newberg super well. It's where I got stabbed in my hand. So super,
237.44s:  super familiar with, yeah, super familiar with Newberg. California pizza's best says I got booted
245.76s:  from Jackie stream after he talked about turning 1000 to a million. I don't know anything about any of
250.32s:  that. And so I am not going to weigh in. I got to be honest, like I've heard people mention him
255.44s:  before. I'm just not familiar with his work. So I have really no opinion one way or the other on,
263.20s:  that side of things at least. I am, I kind of stick to the stuff that I spend time experiencing.
269.04s:  Like with Newton, the main reason why I started working with him on this stuff is that like I could
273.44s:  just tell he's a genuine human being, which is kind of rare to find in finance media, finance
279.44s:  YouTube and stuff like that. So I naturally gravitate to those, those kinds of people just because I
285.36s:  identify with them a lot more. Not saying that Jackie is not that again, I don't know him. I literally
290.48s:  don't know him from a hole in the wall. But that's how I started working with Newton, especially
295.52s:  on like the broader GameStop stuff. So all right. Let's start here. So I started reading through this.
312.56s:  A lot of it is mostly because damn it, I keep forgetting to not put it behind my head. I changed
319.68s:  sides. So it completely screws me up. Now that I'm on this side is compared to that side. And as
326.80s:  you can tell, I forget all the freaking time. So when I look at, when I look at this, there's a
337.04s:  couple of things I'm looking for. And again, just as I'm trying to develop a fingerprint for
343.36s:  roaring kitty, the way that he does things more just because I think as an actor, he's interesting.
348.00s:  Not like an actor putting on a show, but like as a participant in this market, I think really,
355.20s:  really interesting. So I enjoy learning about him the way he thinks about things, the way he does
360.16s:  things. Cohen is obviously another one of those people. I spent some time watching a live stream.
366.24s:  He did a while ago. No, that's a lie. Sorry, it wasn't a live stream. It was a like a podcast,
375.28s:  I think. And it's like one of the only podcasts I've seen him do. And I learned a lot about Cohen,
383.28s:  honestly, during that podcast. Let me see if I can find it really quick for you. I'm sure you all
386.72s:  have seen it, but just in case somehow somebody hasn't, I think it's good context. Ryan Cohen
395.20s:  podcast. Yeah, this one right here. So I think this podcast here,
413.92s:  this was really fun to watch. If you guys haven't had a chance to watch this,
419.84s:  I cannot emphasize it or I cannot like recommend it enough. It was so good because it was
425.36s:  such a cool opportunity to get a chance to like learn about like Cohen, the way that he views things,
432.72s:  the way that he interacts, you know, much more kind of relax setting, right? So he's not being
439.68s:  deposed. He's not on some sort of like large media interview. He's just kind of having a conversation
445.36s:  with this dude. And I think the conversation that they had was fascinating because it was a really
453.44s:  good mix of shit that was about Cohen specifically, his background, him as a person. But then there was
461.76s:  a lot of stuff that we got to talk about the way that he thinks about business and the way that he
467.04s:  does things, which is really cool. This is actually where I learned a lot about his tweeting and
472.72s:  his tweets now to me, they make, they make so much more sense. So if I grab Cohen's Twitter,
483.28s:  if you go through that podcast and then you look at his Twitter, I mean, it literally lines up
491.60s:  perfectly. The fact that he did this, the fact that I think he changed this a few times that
498.00s:  used to be, I forgot, he had like two different versions in his bio. One of them was like,
504.40s:  she heard something and then the other one I think he had was like, unemployable or something.
508.56s:  I forgot exactly what it was. Again, you guys probably would know better than me. But the point
513.36s:  being is it's just very clear that the dude, he just like's fucking around. Like he's just,
518.72s:  he's just playing games and it's hilarious. So like this, the Kamala coffee and the Trump coffee
525.84s:  and what they are absolute joke, Kamala 2069, absolute joke, this absolute, like he's just,
532.80s:  he's literally just playing games and it's hilarious. Because when I listen to this interview,
542.08s:  it made way more sense. Like the dude just doesn't take the stuff that's seriously. He actually
547.12s:  reminds me a lot of Musk in the sense that like they're obviously very successful people that
553.04s:  actually think that like the system in the game is kind of bullshit and they don't want to play
559.52s:  like the corporate game by standard corporate game rules and they like moving around a little bit
565.68s:  more freely and just calling the nonsense as it is. Like that's some of what I see. And it's,
571.60s:  it's just so refreshing. So I bring all of this to context because when I'm looking through like
577.68s:  this stuff and then I start reading through the the deposition a little bit again, I'm like I'm
583.76s:  developing a deeper and deeper understanding of how this thing all works for him and the way that
591.52s:  he thinks about things because I think it's important for us, especially because like I own
597.84s:  shares of GameStop. So it's admittedly a small part of my portfolio, but nonetheless, I still care
604.72s:  about the performance. I don't hold stock in pretty much anything. I trade options. So there's
609.36s:  a few things I hold stock in and it's again, I remind you guys a lot of it is to like support the
614.24s:  movement and it's to participate, right? Because when there's something cool that's happening,
620.16s:  I like to try to contribute to it the way that I can. But in my DNA, I'm a trader man. Like I'm
625.76s:  always going to be a trader. It's how I do what I do. I started in 2007. It's not going to change
630.64s:  for me. It's how I make a living. So there's like the trading part of me that does stuff.
636.88s:  But then there's in this case part of me that's an investor in a company and I'm holding shares
642.32s:  for it, which I don't do much. So when I am in that position, I want to know about the company.
647.36s:  And I started kind of getting caught up on this whole case. So I want to preface kind of poking
654.80s:  through this with you guys that I'm not an expert at any of this stuff. I'm not an attorney.
658.56s:  I'm literally just a dude that's online. I'm intrigued by these things. So there will be parts
665.12s:  that I have some background information on. But I would wager hands down. You all know collectively,
672.24s:  definitely far more than I know about this whole thing. So because of that,
679.04s:  I want to poke through some things that I did see that were pretty interesting though.
685.36s:  So as you can see that this case started in 23 August of 22. And from my understanding,
692.56s:  and again, please help me understand if I'm wrong. That's really the whole point of doing these
697.12s:  in a live session specifically in these instances is because it helps me learn as well. And not
702.96s:  here just to teach the elements that I know. Again, like if it's something about options, I probably
707.12s:  can teach you about it. That I know inside and out in sideways managing a portfolio analysis.
712.24s:  That's my bag. But getting more and more of the context of this broader story, that's where I'm
716.96s:  learning. And I traded the squeeze twice, the one that we had recently and then the one before that.
724.64s:  But I traded the movement of the price, right? That's what drew me to it as a trader. But after
729.92s:  this most recent one, I started paying more attention to kind of like the broader story because at
735.20s:  this point I had been on YouTube. And I started just getting infatuated with the background of
742.80s:  this whole thing because it is such a fascinating place to be. The way that I approach markets is so
749.68s:  different than this. So all of that context is to say most of this is not my strength. There's
756.48s:  pieces of this that I can definitely talk about very strong. Well, but there's a lot of it that I
762.72s:  don't know. So anyways, going back to this, I was trying to understand even the origin of this,
768.64s:  which it really seemed to amounts to some sort of stock market manipulation pump and dump. So when
774.80s:  I was reading this initial complaint to again, get that general context, you can see that a few
782.08s:  things came up. And the way that this thing is moved is actually been also pretty interesting
788.40s:  because if I'm not mistaken, do you guys remember when the first bedbath and beyond when this
794.96s:  happened? Because if I'm not what was it like 2020 that it went down or something like that?
802.08s:  Or was it 2022 specifically? Let me see. So the reason I'm thinking about the timelines is just the
808.80s:  timelines that this unfolded from like when the initial event happened versus when they actually
815.28s:  filed. Twitch to be says, make your position larger. I'm near 45% of my portfolio. Yeah, it's not going
822.80s:  to be me. Again, I just got to keep it a buck. There's I like the stock for sure. Like I think
828.32s:  it's interesting. And I think it's at a really, really cool spot here. But the nature of being a
833.04s:  trader, it's completely different, man. Like the way I look at markets is I'm looking to find
838.88s:  opportunities that I can trade up, down sideways. I don't care. But it needs to be something that I
844.32s:  can trade and consistently make money off of. The way that I trade is completely different. I
848.08s:  don't want to make this about that. Just because nobody cares. But yeah, the Cliff notes version of
855.84s:  it though is that what I do as a trader is is completely different. It's literally completely
861.60s:  different. So yeah, the two parts of my brain are engaged in this kind of story. There's the stuff
870.80s:  that's just fascinated by GameStop, Ryan Cohen, Rory and Kitty, the whole background, FTDs,
876.72s:  the swaps, the different kind of tailwind cycles that we think exists. Like what Newton put together,
883.44s:  this is like a freaking, it's I call it he's like a I call my scribe, not my right. It's not
890.24s:  possessive like that. But like he's like the GME scribe because he's done such an incredible job
896.72s:  staying in touch with what's going on. And he absolutely spends a lot of time and effort,
904.88s:  you know, finding things that feed into the story. And he and I actually spend quite a bit of time
911.92s:  both on live streams. He and I have spoken more off live stream than on live stream by quite a
917.44s:  lot at this point. And we talk about like these different things that he's coming across and try
922.64s:  to analyze them. Again, this stock moves so differently than normal stocks. And for somebody like
930.32s:  me that's been in markets for so long, coming across products that do that is so intriguing.
937.44s:  Like there's no other way for me to describe it than pure intrigue to see things. It's like if you
944.72s:  play a sport, right, if you're a martial artist and you think about certain movements,
952.00s:  movement patterns, there are things that are generally universal. But then every once in a while,
956.40s:  somebody will come up and do things completely different. So that's kind of like a John Jones
961.12s:  kind of fighter who's not really perfect at anything, but he's really good at most things.
965.68s:  And he's super creative or like a Mikey Musamechi from a Jiu-Jitsu world. Like they move differently
971.36s:  than like the standard. And it's part of what makes them so intriguing. So when I look at GameStop,
977.84s:  it's that. It's absolutely intriguing the way that the thing works. So
982.96s:  Gasewag says I feel like you could trade GME pretty consistently, but not your portfolio. Yeah,
987.60s:  absolutely. I think that's a completely fair statement. I think traders have to figure out
991.84s:  what's right for them. So like for example, if I look at GME and the way that GME has been moving,
998.96s:  the notion of could it be traded? Absolutely. This can be traded. No doubt. But from the context,
1006.40s:  also there's a hundred of us here. So shout out to the outlier apes or just the apes who
1010.48s:  ever is here hanging out, all are welcome. But when I look at something like GameStop,
1017.52s:  could I trade this here? Of course, I could always trade something if I'm so inclined. But the question
1024.16s:  I think a trader has to ask themselves is not like, could I conceivably place a trade in this?
1030.00s:  Could I conceivably place a trade? Yes. The question realistically is where is the best
1037.28s:  place for my money? That's what I care about as a trader. So to me, the question when I look at
1044.56s:  something like GameStop or any other opportunity is not, could I trade this at this point? I can
1050.72s:  structure a trade for anything. But it's where is the best possible place for my money?
1057.28s:  And it's not just in terms of where can I make the most money? Where's the best return?
1062.24s:  It's how do things fit into my portfolio so I can deploy all of my capital in a way that achieves
1071.04s:  my broader objectives with my money. So yeah, day swag. I completely agree with you. Somebody could
1077.60s:  easily focus only on GameStop. That is completely possible. But it's a really tough way to make money
1085.44s:  in general for a trader. For an investor, it's definitely a different story. Investors have to do
1090.32s:  whatever's right for them. But even somebody like Roy and Kitty, that's one of the reasons why I'm
1094.96s:  so fascinated by him because he is an outlier. He's a true outlier in the way that he approaches
1100.24s:  markets and the way that he approaches money and the way that he runs trades. And he's been
1106.48s:  extremely fortunate. I will again, keep it a buck. The dude's smart. He's super smart.
1111.84s:  But the thing about the way that he's been able to grow his money is that it's not even just about
1116.56s:  being smart. It's also a lot about fortune. Like how much luck is involved with how positions
1124.40s:  happen to be built at given different point in time. Now for him, he's obviously sustained the
1130.80s:  approach for some time. So it shows that I would argue it's more skill than luck. But there's
1137.20s:  still a healthy dose of luck. So with stuff like that, like looking at somebody like Roy and Kitty,
1143.12s:  I think it is so important, absolutely so important, that we have to have a healthy understanding
1153.12s:  of survivorship bias, how that works. And again, even the cat, he's moved from at least I think. I
1160.88s:  don't know if he sold out a GME. I can't say definitively, but I think he has. And it looks like
1165.92s:  he's rotated into chewy for now. I don't necessarily think by any means that he's done with GME.
1170.80s:  I still think that again, based on the breadth of evidence I've come across, it seems like GME is
1175.44s:  kind of like his bag. But I also think he's venturing out for opportunities where he sees them.
1180.64s:  So I think that's part of the reason why he moved. At least in the short term.
1186.80s:  Now again, I want to be very, very clear. I don't know because I haven't seen his portfolio.
1191.84s:  I don't think anybody has. And with that is the case, it's impossible for me to say definitively
1197.52s:  and I refuse to. That's another thing that you'll find about the way that I talk about these things.
1201.84s:  I am so mindful about the framing of things. And I think a lot of people are too comfortable saying
1209.76s:  things as fact when it's impossible for them to know it as fact. And I think that's dangerous.
1214.64s:  That creates a really bad habit in our brain that we turn things that are well educated guesses
1221.28s:  into fact and they're different things. So yeah, somebody like growing kiddie is just absolutely
1227.92s:  fascinating to me in the way that he trades. So back over to this though, I started reading through
1234.48s:  the case to understand the broader context of like what the problem is, what they're thinking
1239.52s:  about. Let me zoom this in a little bit. Let me know if that's easier for you guys to read. If not,
1249.92s:  I can zoom it in a little bit further. PFA has to step away for a few moments. PFA, let's not,
1259.92s:  you know, let's not joke around. We know that you'll be back in about 45 seconds, but that's good.
1264.00s:  Enjoy those 45 seconds as best as you can. And then yeah, that's great. We'll catch up with you
1269.44s:  in a few moments. We got roaring titty. You guys didn't tell me roaring titty was here. Every time I
1274.16s:  have a chance to say that name, I'm always here to say roaring titty. It's great to see you.
1282.96s:  Oh, PFA pulled their message back. That's unfortunate. It was good for everybody. That's okay.
1289.92s:  Sorry, PFA. It looks like PFA might be back already. That was quick about
1295.04s:  correct time, I think. All right, back into this. So let's take a look at the primary complaint.
1300.88s:  And I'm not going to go through each piece in this docket at all. My intent is just to help us
1307.52s:  align on the big muscle movements and have everybody on the same page. Because one thing I do find
1315.28s:  people do not just in the ape community, but in most communities is I don't find people take the
1320.64s:  time to go to sources. And I think it's important to go to sources to like actually see with our own
1326.88s:  eyeballs what something is. Because a lot of people, they have like different opinions of stuff.
1332.88s:  And that's okay to hear the opinions, but I think it's really important to see the actual
1337.44s:  information. Again, like you can tell from the way that I typically present content to you guys.
1342.24s:  I'm very specific when I'm talking about something as an opinion, I literally will say in my
1347.52s:  opinion very purposefully so that you know that is my brain interpolating information and coming up
1353.52s:  with what I think. But there's also a difference between like objective information. So that's what I
1360.08s:  aim to align with on this specifically is what is the objective information? What is the origin
1366.88s:  of this thing as it sits? So the lead plaintiff, this homie,
1372.88s:  individually and on all other person situated. So from my understanding, stuff like this happens
1380.00s:  when there's going to be some sort of potential class action suit, bigger suit, but they pick a
1385.68s:  lead plaintiff. And then they represent all their people that are in similar scenarios.
1392.08s:  So from my understanding, they'll typically do this so that they have obviously a focal point
1396.72s:  to work with, but they'll also try to find somebody that like represents the case. Well, the most
1400.88s:  recent case against roaring kitty that was filed. I think on a Friday and it was dropped on the
1409.04s:  Monday, which was really interesting. I did a video on that a while ago. That was a similar
1413.52s:  scenario where they picked somebody to be kind of like the lead in that case, but I thought the
1419.44s:  lead for that case was really, really weak. So I'm actually very curious how strong this lead is
1424.96s:  in this case because yeah, I think that's kind of an important, I don't want to say that important,
1431.20s:  but it is kind of an important factor to have somebody that represents it that has, I don't
1435.92s:  want to call it like a more exaggerated story, but definitely more severe story would make sense.
1441.12s:  So let's see, the within allegations based upon the investigation conducted through the plaintiff,
1451.68s:  they reviewed analysis of Ryan Cohen, Arnalg Gustavo's public filings with the SEC, press releases,
1461.76s:  public report news articles, research reports, so on and so forth. So this is a federal securities
1468.40s:  class action brought on behalf of those folks who purchase stock from within the time frame,
1475.60s:  essentially that they're referencing. And it says the plaintiff brings action, derivative action
1481.92s:  within the meaning of rule that. So this is kind of just the foundation for the case writ large.
1492.00s:  It's talking about everything what it ties to for different case laws and different rules that they
1497.92s:  have to abide by who has jurisdiction, yada yada yada, I want to see where we see the,
1507.28s:  where we see the, where we see the meat potatoes here. So here is the first part. So
1512.88s:  Peng Chang see it looks like they're saying that they acquired 8,020 shares.
1520.56s:  And then they got it, they're arguing when it was artificially inflated. And then they lost 106
1527.76s:  thousand dollars. First off, I boo fucking who, crime me a river, but that part of side,
1535.84s:  let's see what they say. Canadian citizen called by media is the meme stock champion.
1542.16s:  Is that accurate? Is this, is this true? Like is this actually what he's generally known as the
1553.20s:  meme stock champion? I've heard of him. I know like Elon calls himself like the meme stock king
1558.56s:  or some shit like that, but I don't know about the, the meme stock champion.
1564.88s:  What does that make sense to you guys?
1573.12s:  I think we should be back up. My bad. We just took, we took a little hiatus. You know how it goes.
1579.84s:  I think I messed up something in, in OBS. Okay. So Paul says full iceberg. Well,
1586.80s:  all right. We're back at it. Also, there's 69 of us. So that, that was worth dropping out for
1591.20s:  a moment. Okay. So it sounds like a kernel says you're breaking up. Let me know if the audio is
1597.04s:  still coming through choppy. The OBS looks like it's going through. Okay. I see 60 FPS,
1603.12s:  4600. All right. So Paul says I'm thought. That sounds great. I'll go with thought. That's
1609.68s:  right. And doctors A says we sound okay. So it looks like whoever says that I'm coming through
1616.56s:  broken. We're just going to have to get you off of bad Wi-Fi. So okay. So it sounds like from
1623.68s:  consensus though, this isn't actually something he's like overly well known for. The reason why I
1628.16s:  was asking this is because I see this where again, like in the deposition that I was reading most
1634.88s:  recently, it looked like they were really trying to lean into this shit. And I'll explain a little
1638.48s:  bit why I think that is when we get there. But I was, I was genuinely just curious if this is like
1642.72s:  a well-known name for him. And it sounds like generally not. So it says Cohen has employed. Oh,
1650.08s:  shit. They're getting right into the meat and potatoes. Has employed pump and dump scheme to
1654.64s:  raises a much capital and ignited several meme stocks to draw dropping heights. He served as
1659.60s:  chairman of game stops boards in January 21 and throughout the class period. So that's also
1664.24s:  fascinating. Now, obviously they have to come out with their forks and knives in order to
1668.72s:  start getting something spicy going here. But when I'm reading this, I think that they kind of
1676.16s:  forget quite a lot that he can't like he can't actually do this that well. The problem with larger
1684.00s:  float stocks is that they're difficult to manipulate. That's why traders like me tend to not trade
1691.04s:  penny stocks. So if you've ever been in any of my like my weekly update live streams, whenever
1695.84s:  people bring up, you know, penny stocks, I'm always not about it. And it's because like I can't
1703.04s:  really trade it. And they're really prone to manipulation. So Evergreen says more on alert. Yeah,
1712.24s:  I mean, I don't think you're wrong, brother. I'm probably fall squarely into that category. But
1717.04s:  I'm enjoying learning about the the story and whatnot. So hopefully we can learn a little bit
1721.20s:  together. But back to this, it's difficult to actually run some sort of broad pump and dump
1730.32s:  on something like this in my opinion. So could it be done? I absolutely think so. But I think it's
1738.80s:  would be really difficult. There was a recent case. I'm not sure if you all are familiar with it.
1743.84s:  But there was an entity. I'm not going to name them because I don't want to give them any
1748.00s:  undue press. And the entity though, they were like straight up running pump and dumps. And it was
1756.00s:  clear to see if there was like very clear messaging behind it that they got from fact finding. So
1763.28s:  yeah, I mean, that's like a clear example of pump and dump. I think this is a really difficult
1769.28s:  argument for them to make here. But when somebody has a lot of money, a lot of times they're not
1773.44s:  necessarily trying to position something that is super solid enough to go through and win a trial.
1782.00s:  Because really, if they can get them to settle ahead of time because they don't want to go to
1786.88s:  trial or whatever else, that's what this is for. So even if this case is not the strongest thing
1794.00s:  based on our opinion or whoever else's opinion, the main thing is they're kind of just taking a
1799.04s:  shot here. And if they can get some of this to stick, then it becomes kind of again, just how much
1807.12s:  can we potentially get from this dude to settle before even going to trial? Because that's the
1812.16s:  vast majority path of cases is not trial.
1816.88s:  So this has like a little bit of mango on the lip.
1827.04s:  Gotta get my mango.
1834.16s:  Warring Titty says, isn't Cohen also the son of a big time trader? Yeah, I think his dad not
1838.72s:  only was a trader, but I'm pretty sure he was a businessman. So let's see, Ryan, Cohen's dad,
1845.36s:  Ted Cohen. Let's look up Ted Cohen.
1855.52s:  This shows philosophy. That's not right. There's a lot of
1860.48s:  I don't know if you guys can find a Wikipedia page on it. Let me know. I didn't see one
1865.84s:  Cohen's dad. That's funny.
1880.00s:  I don't see like I was curious if there was a Wikipedia page or something. If you guys can
1883.76s:  find a Wikipedia page on it, let me know. I didn't see one doing like a really quick
1888.24s:  pick through. But yeah, I think he came definitely from money. He also came from a pretty well
1900.48s:  educated background. So yeah. Evergreen says so buy Fubo tomorrow since they won the federal
1908.40s:  lawsuit against Disney and competitors. Oh, I see. Evergreen's just talking to somebody else.
1913.52s:  I see. All right. No, this says he's really known for Chewie though. Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly
1919.84s:  right. So Ryan Cohen is really the one that started Chewie. And that was a fascinating business
1926.64s:  venture for him because his direct competitor, somebody like Amazon, and he found a way to angle in
1932.56s:  between Amazon and a broader market that overall by all intents and purposes, they had dominated.
1940.56s:  So that is a really, really interesting outcome, I think, for Chewie and how successful
1948.96s:  he was able to able to make it. Roing Td says never mind. A.A. says he's not a big time investor.
1954.00s:  Yeah, I thought he was a businessman more so. Pat Smith says glassware company. Yeah. Okay,
1959.36s:  that checks out. I thought he was a business dude. So they're trying to say essentially that he ran
1965.36s:  a pump and dump. And this is talking about JP Morgan. Don't care. Defend an RC Ventures,
1972.40s:  Delaware Corporation. That's super common, by the way. LLCs very often are going to be out of
1977.52s:  Delaware because they have more favorable business laws. They talked about. Okay. So he bought in
1985.68s:  10% stake and best buying beyond, bad bath and beyond in March of 2022. And the defendant, his
1995.04s:  served as the company executive vice president since May of 2020. And here are the allegations.
2003.68s:  Plaintiffs claims or typical claims members class adequately protect the interest. Here we go.
2012.64s:  So the class is so numerous that jointer of all members is impractical.
2016.80s:  Impract.
2018.24s:  Impract.
2019.24s:  Tickable. Why would it not just say him.
2022.24s:  Practical. What does this word mean?
2026.24s:  Impossible impracticed to do or carry out.
2030.24s:  Why not just impractical? Why does it have to be impracticable?
2035.24s:  Huh. Learn a new words. As of 22.
2039.24s:  So 22.
2040.24s:  Uh, BBB why is essentially 80 million shares outstanding. So such shares traded on NASDAQ.
2051.48s:  Exact members not known at this time numbers in the thousands. Okay. So here are the actual allegations.
2059.24s:  It says that there were materially misleading statements. Emissions made to investors regarding
2065.12s:  the company plans financial conditions on and so forth. So not representing the company is
2070.32s:  effectively at all times Gustavo as the executive VP, CFO and treasure control day to day affairs.
2080.24s:  And Cohen was the largest shareholder who appointed three directors to the board a controlling
2084.56s:  person pursuant to section 20a. Through mid August 22 BBB why appeared from the company's
2091.84s:  perspective statements and financial porting to be a successful turning around companies.
2095.24s:  So let's grab a chart of BBB why. And then let's go back five years. I don't even think
2106.24s:  we have to go back five years we do like maybe three years except I want daily. So let's
2111.88s:  do a three year daily chart like that. That's better. Okay. So this is not going to be behind
2119.88s:  my head but I think I'm mostly out of the way. So here we can see where 22 was so 22 just for reference
2134.76s:  starts right here. And they were saying the time frame that they're referring to through mid August
2144.60s:  which is here which is really interesting because if you actually look at this chart from that
2150.76s:  time frame this wouldn't look like a company that's turning around. I mean just I don't know maybe
2156.12s:  I'm being nitpicky there but I wouldn't consider that a company that's turning around. It looks
2160.44s:  like a company that's having giant problems. Now for those that don't know from my understanding
2167.56s:  somebody like Ryan Cohen seems to just realize the chair was like screwing up the background
2174.60s:  remover. Ryan Cohen seems to like to intervene in seller boxing which seller boxing is a man it's
2182.52s:  an interesting business practice but it's essentially to not go super far in the weeds. It's a
2190.44s:  predatory business practice where you attempt to extract is much money from a company before it
2198.28s:  goes bankrupt. And the reason why you do that is because if you essentially extract as much
2204.92s:  value as possible and then you short sell something and then it goes bankrupt you don't have a
2213.08s:  tax footprint. There's you don't owe anything because the entity is gone. So there's an incentive
2218.76s:  for this predatory practice and essentially the way it works is investors of different sorts
2224.12s:  sometimes in goods with a broker of some sort. Well identify a company that's otherwise struggling
2230.52s:  they'll put a board in that specifically or one of two things either a grossly incompetent board
2236.92s:  and leadership team that they know is not really going to save it driving it into the ground
2241.08s:  or somebody that's complicit with the behavior either or again don't know in this circumstance
2247.72s:  what that was looking like but the process can make a ton a ton of money. So that's why
2257.32s:  they're incentivized to do stuff like this. Now for somebody like Ryan Cohen if you're able to
2263.40s:  turn the company around it leads to stuff like this to squeezes and it leads to movements that
2272.68s:  force the other side of the trade that was shorting it to get out of their trade and it can
2277.56s:  make a shit on of money to the upside. Now it's very very much difficult in order to make that
2285.80s:  kind of turnaround but if you are able to make that kind of turnaround you can make a ton of money
2291.64s:  and I think Cohen started getting more into this activist investor role because of some of the
2298.20s:  possibilities there. Now again I don't know his actual motivations I don't know if he's in there
2302.52s:  till you know for Chevrolet to go in there and save a company I like I think he's still a businessman
2308.84s:  but I think it happens to coincide with doing something that I would consider to be more honorable than
2317.88s:  you know participating in purposefully sending a company into the dirt because you have a chance
2323.08s:  to make a tax regain on it. So that's what I think in general one of the reasons why he started
2332.20s:  moving into this is because he saw an opportunity here to navigate that. So here it says through
2340.92s:  mid August it appeared to be successful turning around the company appeared to be moving rapidly
2348.28s:  towards growth profitability through fundamental reshaping strategies spending off the best
2353.88s:  the buy-by-baby business. The picture almost entirely fiction from March 22 through August 22
2362.68s:  they're saying that Cohen in conspiracy with Gustavo engaged in fraudulent scheme to artificially
2368.28s:  inflate the price of BBY publicly traded stock more specifically with JPMs aiding in a betting
2375.88s:  blatantly misrepresented the value of the profitability of BBY causing it to report revenues
2382.28s:  that was fictitious and all right so they're any here talking a bunch of shit. I think if anybody has
2390.84s:  any questions on this I think we can go further into detail if you'd like. The only reason why I
2395.64s:  really wanted to start with this document is so that everybody has again from the source
2401.48s:  what the issue is what they're looking at and why they're looking at it. So my intent isn't to go
2408.04s:  through this entire document because it's going to be super one sided this is the complaint.
2411.56s:  When you see a complaint this is the people who have a complaint that are going to talk all
2417.16s:  their shit so it's going to be super one sided I don't care to go through this but for those that
2423.00s:  want to go through the whole thing in detail I'll drop a link in the chat you guys all have access
2429.08s:  to that now and then I'll drop a link to the broader thing as well in the chat just so that you
2433.16s:  can have the entire docket. I'm pretty sure this is on Newton's sheet somewhere if I'm not mistaken
2439.32s:  if not I'll make sure that he also has exits not really GME but it's tangential via you know
2445.80s:  Cohen because this does impact Cohen when he has pending litigation like this going on.
2451.56s:  So that's this one. So we now understand again from the source what the general gripe was
2459.56s:  they think that these two incahoots were trying to spread a fake story about Best Buy essentially
2467.32s:  for their own gain and I have to open my door real quick because the boss is here aka Thor.
2489.96s:  So I think he heard us talking about legal stuff and he decided to come check it out. The main
2496.04s:  thing is he is kind of hilarious he goes up to my door and he just scratches it once. Oh you're tired.
2503.00s:  Why are you so tired? You've been sleeping bro. He comes up and he like scratches the door once
2508.28s:  and then he scratches it again and then he scratches it again like a very very specific cadence but
2514.52s:  as you can tell he's ready. He's interested to get into the legalities of game stop. Do you know
2519.40s:  about this? Hey need you to focus. We're going to talk about depositions. You know what deposition is?
2527.32s:  Yeah. I think he's ready. I feel like he's essentially you can tell he's ready for court.
2534.36s:  He has his tuxedo on.
2539.72s:  He does have a mohawk. I don't know how well perceived that would be in court but
2543.72s:  yeah we got the boss here. All right let's get my ugly face out of the way now.
2548.92s:  Alan says real quick can you explain for me how to buy shares of GME on the lot market?
2557.40s:  I've seen a lot of talk about retail traders orders not making it to a lit market. Okay you
2561.48s:  meant lit market. Yeah. So depending on who your broker is you can choose where to route your order.
2567.00s:  So again I don't know who your broker is but if you choose order routing then you can
2575.00s:  essentially determine where you want it to go so that it's not gone through a market maker.
2579.72s:  So if you use something like the ice it's an electronic exchange.
2585.08s:  You can change the routing of your order so that it's not being fulfilled through a market maker
2590.84s:  that kind of thing. Cedric says oh shit this guy's USMC. Yes sir that is exactly what all that
2597.80s:  paraphernalia is that you see in the background.
2601.64s:  Roaring Titi says i.e. X I think yeah so you can take a look at a couple different ones.
2606.68s:  Alan uses Robinhood so I honestly have absolutely nothing to say to you because the last thing I
2611.88s:  would use is Robinhood that is like straight up the last possible broker I would use. I would rather
2619.72s:  use a fucking notepad that I mail to people then using Robinhood and supporting that business.
2626.92s:  I would rather use stone tablets that I chisel my trade and deal with the delay of FedEx
2634.76s:  shipping stone tablets in order to get trade confirmations then going through Robinhood.
2644.36s:  There's just no way so the main thing you want to look up though is like specific to your broker once
2650.76s:  you get an actual broker is just how to route orders directly to the exchange. So if you route orders
2657.32s:  directly to an exchange you're now bypassing the market maker and you don't really need to
2665.16s:  you don't have to have your order internalized so yeah that's what you can do there for that.
2672.76s:  It's a good question. Ian says dude I remember these livestreams two years ago where you attend
2678.44s:  13 people so sick to see other communities going yeah man I have to be honest the funny thing about
2684.04s:  the way that you could tell that I'm not in this for like the fame or the attention because exactly
2688.52s:  is Ian is saying I've done livestreams since I started on YouTube essentially and like we used to
2694.12s:  have like 10 people which I was totally cool with. My goal for being on YouTube is just to try to
2699.96s:  share information because when I started looking at the broader picture there's so much shitty
2707.16s:  information and terrible people that are just trying to make money off of people that it drives me
2712.20s:  crazy especially because the people that they're trying to make money off of are the exact people
2717.56s:  that don't have the money to waste. So that's I did a thing for a while where I was doing like these
2724.44s:  service reviews stuff because I was like super pissed off about it and I was trying to find like
2730.20s:  decent trade services and I can't find them really they're hard to find but yeah we've been running
2737.56s:  this for a minute and it's fun yeah I love seeing the community grow it helps also with just
2744.36s:  collective intellect and like the hive mind and the overall amount of information we have available to
2749.72s:  us it's just straight up beneficial for everything.
2754.28s:  Paulus says when is it advantageous to bypass the market maker really if you don't want your order
2759.80s:  being internalized so like if you want your order to be processed on the actual exchange that's
2769.48s:  when you could do it but other than that again from like a practical perspective it's it's not really
2773.72s:  beneficial more often than not you are going to get a slightly better fill through a market maker
2779.32s:  because of the way that payment for order flow is structured again just keeping it real I'm not
2784.04s:  saying that I love payment for order flow or anything it's I will again objectively say
2789.88s:  markets now are more efficient with payment for order flow than when they were when I started
2794.60s:  trading like 2008 2007's when I started but specifically with options so like payment for order
2803.08s:  flow isn't all negative but I also don't think it's great like I think we're at a point now
2809.00s:  where we've seen how this works and I think that we're at a point where we can kind of move past
2815.24s:  payment for order flow into the next thing because there is a next thing that's better than payment
2818.84s:  for order flow without a doubt but yes just kind of where we're at at least at the point now
2825.88s:  so yeah that's the the idea about bypassing the market maker
2832.20s:  Eric it's my doppelganger Eric says have you heard about the cat error reporting numbers
2837.72s:  there appears to be a correlation of a significant number of equities error reporting dates with
2844.04s:  GME price run ups interesting really really interesting now I haven't looked into that if there's
2852.28s:  somewhere that I can take a look at it let me know you can either email it to me now and just let
2856.52s:  me know when you email it to me or you can drop it in the discord if you're in there either or
2860.12s:  is totally cool Eric at outlier trading.io that's the new email address so for everybody that doesn't
2869.72s:  know I've moved the branding from ES invest to outlier trading I just want it less like focused on me
2875.56s:  it shouldn't be about me so that's what that is so that's my new email okay yeah if you put it
2881.16s:  in the discord I can grab it real quick and pull it up no problemo I see let's take a look
2897.08s:  all right so this is from region formal I say those names because you guys might know them I honestly
2906.44s:  don't so I don't know exactly who they are if they have a background with you all I don't know
2912.28s:  them but just in case you do this has finra has just released the latest cat error data and it has
2918.76s:  them intrigued so once a month it says finra reports cat errors volumes reach trading day yep
2925.64s:  notice the error rate percentages which are trades that occurred on all dates did not contain all
2930.36s:  regulatory required information on most dates the rate is less than 1% however occasionally much
2937.24s:  higher numbers first of may and I'm just trying to follow the logical thing here specifically a nine
2950.04s:  occasions there were excessive errors over a short duration 1.8 billion within five days all nine
2954.92s:  instances resulted in significant price runs for gme within the next 60 days here's the deal I
2963.72s:  again I could see the interest here the interest is interesting that was kind of a funny sentence
2969.72s:  but again for like if this is the trigger right that if this happens that there's a price run within
2977.48s:  60 days that's a long ass time and what happens over that 60 days it's like unless you can purely
2988.52s:  isolate this thing the cat error as the thing unless you can purely isolate that then to me and
2999.08s:  that's one of the things that makes the whole gme story so difficult because it's so difficult
3005.56s:  to actually isolate individual things so in this case does it look like there's a relationship I
3014.52s:  mean they're saying in nine instances there was a relationship I would need to know essentially the
3021.00s:  full data set though I would and maybe they have it in here but like I would want to see all of the
3027.00s:  instances not just nine instances so this says all nine instances resulted in significant price
3033.00s:  were there any instances where it went up and price didn't move I would need to know that
3039.40s:  but the other thing is with such a big window of like 60 days I think it's really hard to like point
3045.48s:  at this and say this is the thing again to their point I'm not saying that that's what they're doing
3050.92s:  but to them it looks like there's an interesting correlation right so it says I found this trend
3056.60s:  applies to the market as a whole much stronger for gme than other stocks blue bars average
3065.96s:  performances of the stocks from 15 to 25 in the nine instance of the higher billion error cycles
3075.16s:  tested price action after huge cat option error periods found the opposite trend
3081.96s:  and it looks really interesting so this is the kind of data that I find really interesting
3088.28s:  because again the what I see is there's two different parts of this the first part is from
3097.40s:  just a general trading perspective so I'll again use the example that I share with you guys
3107.56s:  here which is in gme if we go back here do a year if we go back here I noticed something even before
3122.44s:  like the market started taking off on this first leg up you can see on the third of may
3131.80s:  there was a massive massive increase in price and volume so what causes this I couldn't tell you
3143.24s:  but this is one of the things that caught my attention so when I look at this kind of run up
3151.16s:  I see just interesting behavior I see an explosion and volume that's focused on buy side
3159.00s:  and I see a massive movement in price so now how that corresponds with again this other data
3167.96s:  that we're looking at I don't know but what I do know is that before all of the squeezes that I've
3175.32s:  seen there's been a really anomalous run up in average volume that I can point that
3182.20s:  what causes the run up in that volume I don't know but I do know that whenever I've seen
3190.92s:  game stop run the volume has changed so for me that's the indicator I look for personally because
3195.80s:  I can directly look at it Nathan says yeah those nine times price run happened completely
3201.72s:  different ways over those 60 days so it's not exactly isolated I got downvoted to hell saying
3207.00s:  that on his post well I think the problem is Nathan for that like why you would get downvoted is
3214.84s:  because like depending on the way that you frame it right because I think one of the problems
3220.04s:  is it's so easy to cast stones and disprove theories and it's much harder to come up with like
3225.48s:  efficacious theories so the way that I typically try to look at addressing those kinds of things at
3231.00s:  least from my mind is from a pure scholastic standpoint I am interested in finding the holes
3238.28s:  in the faults in a theory not to tear it down because I don't want it to be true but because I'm
3242.84s:  attempting to find truth but I normally try to approach it from a method of how can we if there's
3249.64s:  a hole in the theory on how we can build on the theory to try and again identify as much truth as
3259.48s:  possible that's the idea at least so yeah I'm not sure I'm not exactly sure what the background is
3268.52s:  behind like your comment or how it went but yeah that's it's really interesting to see those kinds
3275.08s:  of connections made because again like there's no doubt that that is a fascinating fascinating correlation
3283.16s:  with the the cat error data like that that's something but whether or not that's the actual
3290.92s:  trigger to something I'm actually like I'm not sure I'm really not sure it's very difficult for me
3299.48s:  to tell so it's something that I would keep an eye on and see what I could then tie it to and try
3310.28s:  to isolate that's one of the hardest parts when I look at this here and I explore Newton's data
3321.00s:  we kind of talked about this I can find a lot of instances where it's like there's kind of these
3325.08s:  really neat correlations between things where we might see FTD skyrocket or we might see some of the
3331.88s:  ETF FTD skyrocket like we can see these different pieces that start to move but then I can also find
3339.32s:  instances where like the pieces move and then price doesn't move so again from like a correlation
3346.92s:  standpoint which again like the my my background is based in stats so from a correlation standpoint
3354.52s:  it becomes really interesting to try to isolate it and again for me that the cleanest isolation
3362.44s:  I found so far is volume and no shit Sherlock there's nothing magical about that it's like very
3369.40s:  common now that the tricky part I think for a lot of people is trying to identify where the volume
3376.04s:  comes from which again it looks like this is a start on that but I think Noah says not every cat
3383.80s:  error equals an FTD which is another really important point I think I think when we look at cat errors
3389.80s:  it tells us there's something going on with tracking but we don't know exactly what
3397.00s:  so I'll have to see
3403.48s:  okay so let me grab this link really quick
3409.96s:  so this is the cat data where's the actual data I see the presentation so this link
3417.40s:  it says the error update including the data so maybe it's in the presentation
3425.72s:  so that's what I'm looking at here
3433.40s:  so what I can do is I can pull this data down and then I can run a slightly different analysis
3440.52s:  that essentially can test for correlation and then I can regress it
3449.08s:  and assign a confidence interval so I'll take this as an action item let me write that down
3455.88s:  I have to write it down because I'm pretty dumb and I mess things up a lot all right so
3463.40s:  let me get rid of this
3472.84s:  because it's interesting again like all of these different kinds of things I really really enjoy
3477.00s:  looking at because they are so interesting but a big part of it at least for me is to try to like
3483.48s:  actually see if I can get to the heart of signal from the information because there's so much
3489.88s:  interesting information so I need to do like a cat error regression and correlation
3502.60s:  so then I'll add this to my to-do list this I'll save this as a bookmark on to-do and then we'll
3513.40s:  take a look at that so I will I'll follow up on that to see like what I can find because I'm
3521.08s:  I'm not sure but this looks interesting to me I can objectively say that this looks interesting to
3528.84s:  me but it looks like there was another comment let me see
3536.52s:  Dynastas what initiates more volume I know news and earnings usually does but what else
3541.64s:  the this isn't designed to be like pedantic but the the genuine answer and just to start from like
3549.56s:  a base level understanding is it it's more interest in the stock it's demand it's people buying
3556.36s:  so when I look at volume I'm it's in the simplest form telling me people are buying
3566.04s:  now why they're buying that's where it starts to get interesting so in this case are they buying
3573.40s:  because there's an FTD cycle and they need to accumulate shares in order to cover that could be
3579.08s:  could they be buying because there are swaps coming up and they need to be able to deliver
3583.24s:  on the underlying it could be there's a lot of reasons why volume might start to emerge but
3590.04s:  again from like a trading perspective we actually try to eliminate as much of that noise as
3595.96s:  possible because it's noise the thing that matters to me is is volume moving now again from like
3600.84s:  just the general interest standpoint and markets which obviously I'm fascinated by GME but like I
3606.20s:  just love markets you could tell because even when I was on vacation in Alaska I was making videos
3610.68s:  about this stuff like I love markets but so there's that side of me that wants to understand
3617.24s:  some more of the background but I always make sure that there's a bifurcation in my mind I'm
3622.04s:  compartmentalizing like I want to know why this volume is here because I'm generally interested
3627.24s:  and maybe I can find a way to detect different kinds of volume signals to make decisions so I can
3633.24s:  do that now with GameStop it's interesting because again like if I zoom this in a little bit more
3639.48s:  it'll be easier for you to see this is right now let's go to six months notice something very specific
3646.44s:  and this is my initial key and this is actually what made GameStop pop up on a scan for me
3652.60s:  notice this day doesn't look interesting by itself I'll zoom in so it's easier for you guys to see
3657.80s:  this day right here it doesn't look interesting by itself it actually looks like it pales in comparison
3663.56s:  to everything else that we saw here but relative to the time frame before all of this happened
3671.24s:  this looked like a freaking mountain as did this these periods looked really interesting to me
3679.80s:  so when I saw this day come through where the buy volume was eight million the average volume at
3688.20s:  that point was three point three point nine million per day total the buy volume in this case
3695.88s:  essentially was almost two and a half times that well two times this becomes super interesting to me
3705.24s:  so I this popped up on a scan so then I started following it and I see this volume
3711.56s:  jumping in so something's going on and the fun part is is if you look at the options chain
3717.64s:  you could see somebody knew something was going on and it wasn't just roaring kitty there was more
3721.72s:  players in there than roaring kitty because I started getting in along with a bunch of other people
3726.84s:  that are looking for these same kinds of things now it's really important to note sometimes it turns
3733.40s:  into nothing that happens it's not a sure thing but what I'm trying to do again from a trading
3740.84s:  perspective is just picking up breadcrumbs from options markets which are highly informed smart people
3749.72s:  use options and it's not because options are like cool or anything like that it's because
3756.44s:  options provide leverage smart people like leverage you can make more money on your smart idea
3766.12s:  with leverage exactly what's going on there to a tee so when I see this kind of movement
3774.12s:  I am very very interested with GameStop though obviously it's super tricky because we don't know
3785.32s:  exactly what causes the volume and it looks like there's that this is the other part of the story
3791.56s:  that's really interesting to me is that when I look at these different really large movements in
3797.16s:  GameStop a lot of times I think there are different factors that drive the price performance
3804.84s:  that's just been another wrench in identifying like what the the real signals are
3812.28s:  is that it looks like it's multivariate that's as far as I can tell so it makes it much more
3817.32s:  difficult to discreetly identify stock prices moving because of X because of Y or because of Z
3824.84s:  because sometimes it moves because of X other times it moves because of Y other times it moves
3830.04s:  because of Z so again for me I funnel all of that into what I can tell you again with near certainty
3838.68s:  volume moves I've not seen any sort of massive movement in GME before volume has moved so if we go
3848.60s:  to a five year daily and we look at the the pre squeeze move here look what happened to volume
3855.16s:  you got a ton of crazy expanded volume here I'll zoom it in so it's easier to see
3866.76s:  take a look at the volume here right this is well before it started running up even above 100
3874.36s:  in this case it had already made a giant move here it was like five bucks and here it doubled
3882.52s:  to like 10 but look at the volume it's massive so that's realistically the the ultimate trigger that
3890.76s:  I personally use for stuff like this now again as I'm analyzing it this stuff I just find interesting
3897.48s:  and I want to learn more about it I want to understand more about the product how it moves its
3902.12s:  quirks but this really comes down to just interest in what drives the volume from a trading
3909.96s:  perspective I'm just looking for volume that's that's how I'm going to find movements that's why
3914.52s:  I've been so disenfranchised as of late because we're I mean literally you can't even see the
3921.40s:  volume anymore it's so suppressed and part of that suppression to be clear is going to come from this
3928.52s:  uh Jerry Diamond says volume is the ultimate trigger he uses after the facts no that's
3936.84s:  what I'm trying to show you is that volume starts to kick off before that's the whole point I'm
3942.44s:  trying to explain to you guys so again maybe the point wasn't clear so in this case look at the
3950.04s:  second of May we can see that price of game stop second of May it closed at 1276 and we can see
3958.92s:  that the volume though the buy volume on the second of May when it was still sub 15 dollars the
3966.12s:  second of May the buy volume was 8 million shares the 20 day average volume at that point was 3.9
3976.60s:  million shares that's 3.9 million shares over the entire day on average for the past 20 trading days
3983.88s:  on this day the second of May the buy volume only the buy volume the buy volume was 8 million shares
3993.64s:  so the buy volume on the second of May was twice the average total day volume
4002.20s:  this is again when game stop closed at 1276 this is light years before the interesting move happened
4013.40s:  right this is on the second of May you didn't get the ultimate moves until the 13th for the 14th of May
4021.24s:  this is exactly what I was just showing you again going back into 21 before in this case we
4031.08s:  went up above 100 the volume started growing above average volume levels days before so like the 13th
4041.08s:  of Jan you can clearly see excessive volume even on the 11th of Jan so what I'm highlighting is
4048.76s:  actually the exact opposite Jerry I'm highlighting that volume can start showing us positioning
4055.08s:  before the move because exactly to your point what good is it to be able to say like oh yeah
4061.88s:  on the 28th of January it was so clear that this was going to happen because the RSI started peaking
4069.08s:  and you know it's all bullshit like the ability to look at something afterwards and
4074.68s:  paint a pretty pictures completely useless exactly to your point because it's after the fact of
4079.72s:  course it's clear it's hindsight but what I'm trying to show you specifically with volume is that
4085.24s:  volume is such a great indication of things that might be happening and again I already told you it's
4090.28s:  not perfect there will be times where you'll see a volume run up and then something falls flat on
4094.76s:  its face that absolutely happens but when you're trading it's about a probabilistic assessment of
4103.40s:  things and where can you find a higher probability of a move and the reason why this happens is because
4111.32s:  markets take time to position it's not an instantaneous thing we as retail traders that's one of
4117.96s:  that's one of our very few advantages that we get to position however we want
4124.84s:  whenever we want and you can essentially do it with your entire account that is not the case
4132.20s:  for larger institutions at all larger institutions have to take time to position things however
4139.40s:  they want and even somebody like Roryn Kitty which we clearly had an example with not that long ago
4147.08s:  in when he started posting his yellow updates we can trace back his behavior when he was
4154.52s:  entering the position and you can see that he had to build it over time so yeah I mean that's
4162.68s:  that is again like one of the very very few benefits that we have and I am getting a dinner order
4170.84s:  ready for my wife and I I think we're going to do barbecue tonight a little bit of barbecue
4179.56s:  supposed to be good for the soul they say I'm think I'm gonna do try tip and pull pork
4186.84s:  I think that's what I'm leaning towards what do you guys think maybe do it like the spicy barbecue
4195.24s:  that's what I'm going with I think that's a good pick
4199.80s:  I'd rather be seeing says increased volume starts before the actual move yeah exactly right
4204.12s:  the the vast majority of instances you'll see volume move before the before the underlying
4211.40s:  starts to move Dan says do in a stir fry with veggies rice chicken steak oh dude that sounds so
4217.32s:  good tomorrow I was going to do pasta with garlic and oil my mom used to do that she does like
4224.20s:  I don't know it's super super good and I like I like that a lot but I always add chicken to it
4231.24s:  because I don't just like eating pasta by itself obviously it's just like a lot of carbs for
4234.68s:  the sake of carbs and then also I need to text my wife quick to see if she can hook me up with a
4246.28s:  reload and you grab me a reload of mango orange spend drift she's the homie she essentially keeps it
4259.72s:  keeps it pushing in here because I think I've told you guys like towards the end of the day is when
4263.96s:  I normally break my fast so I start going through liquid like a mother Colonel says you're living
4271.16s:  the life of Pat Riley I actually don't know who that is is that like I actually have no idea
4276.76s:  if it is off the lift them up and then back for I forgot Jerry I think Jerry originally was
4285.64s:  talking about the volume I just want to make sure Jerry that that makes sense for you
4290.04s:  because I think that that's like a really important general point for people for traders in general
4295.48s:  because it's one of the cleanest indicators that you can use it's very difficult to use just
4299.88s:  volume by itself like I said you kind of have to pick up other context clues by volume versus cell
4305.64s:  volume by volume versus recent average volume there's a lot of these like smaller quirks that I think
4312.84s:  you have to pay attention to so another thing that you'll find on my chart sometime that not
4317.08s:  here now but is actually two moving averages so in this case I have a longer term moving average
4324.20s:  you're the bomb thank you and then I sent you a part she came in with the with the hook off thank you
4333.96s:  there we go we got another mango orange I was having to drink my backup watermelon
4344.52s:  salsa water which is just a you know just a it's a giant step down all right so it looks like we
4351.16s:  might have lost Jerry that's okay I just wanted to make sure that the the explanation was clear
4356.12s:  because I really do hate it when people are doing technical analysis after the fact and we pretend
4361.88s:  like it's all so clear and we could see all these things but ahead of time it was like the the
4367.16s:  clearest thing is possible and yeah I just don't think that that's useful
4381.48s:  it looks like there's a question from Tommy Tommy says what volume specific scans you use and
4386.28s:  toss there's a bunch of them so I'll use percent growth I'll use percent growth over an average
4393.24s:  I'll use percent overnight growth if I'm trying to trade something next day continuation style
4399.00s:  I'll use standard deviation that's another big one so like volume that exceeds two and a half
4405.24s:  time standard deviation I'll use volume that's accompanied with a price gap all of those are on
4411.56s:  the table for me volume is one of my favorite scans because it it really is like super super telling
4418.68s:  you can learn a lot by looking at volume and again it's not a perfect thing but what I like to do
4425.96s:  is start with volume and then I'll then start to build off of it with what else I can see so
4435.00s:  sometimes if you start with volume and then you start seeing like for example the moving
4441.00s:  average starting to expand and then you start to see the by volume is a larger percentage of total
4449.56s:  volume like all of those things start to coalesce I think into like a really really cool picture
4457.64s:  that's relatively I don't want to say easy to see but it's relatively high probability I believe
4464.76s:  but I definitely like to make sure that if I'm playing something one of the base requirements
4471.16s:  oh it almost always is volume if there's no volume you're losing liquidity which you need in order
4477.48s:  to get in and out and you also need volume because that's again what ultimately moves stock price
4486.12s:  which is kind of that smaller component we were talking about a little bit earlier when I kind of
4490.76s:  glossed over it I'd rather be skiing says volume is like hearing a gunshot you just don't know
4504.60s:  where or if it will continue I know yeah I think it's a weird comparison because if you've been
4509.08s:  shot at you actually get kind of good at knowing how to detect like different sounds of gunshot where
4514.92s:  it is so I get your point though I think overall it's a good point no this says what's your analysis
4521.48s:  of these recent low volume days yeah it to me it looks like we're consolidating so a couple of
4529.56s:  things that I think about in this in like within this context you can see that even on this really
4541.64s:  light volume GMEs not being pushed down which is actually to me like really good news so when I
4549.16s:  look at like this day it was 64 percent sale volume meaning people hitting the other side of the
4555.64s:  bit ask spread and it still was a small update like not huge it opened at 2237 and it closed at 2240
4563.48s:  so I mean we made three pennies on the day it's nothing really to write home about but if you think
4568.60s:  about it in the face of doing that with pretty decent sale volume on a relative basis for the day
4574.12s:  I actually consider that a little bit of a win so I think GameStop is getting really close to a
4580.52s:  point where like investors are generally agreeing on the value we did exercise not too long ago on
4587.88s:  like what the intrinsic value was and I know a lot of people got pissed off at me for talking about
4592.12s:  like the intrinsic value I don't know why because I'm not like I'm not suggesting that that's
4597.24s:  you know GameStop is worth something but what I'm using that as a benchmark for is like when people
4602.52s:  ask how far we think GameStop can go down to to me using something like intrinsic value is just
4609.64s:  a really great back of the napkin parameter to use to start with because again like as something
4615.32s:  starts getting towards its intrinsic value just about all investors get interested in it because
4620.36s:  then it's not even trading at a premium to future discounts to discounted future cashflow
4626.12s:  so because of that I think it's just a good general tool to use from like overall context
4633.32s:  Cedric says 13 is the book value right I don't know so I looked it up on chat GPT and it was a
4638.76s:  little bit lower than that let me see what is GameStop's current intrinsic value and I'm using
4650.84s:  intrinsic so if you're using book value that's a little bit different what is let me ask that
4655.48s:  question to GameStop's current book value which I think I have actually let's see
4668.52s:  book value per share three or average is like 10403 it doesn't this is just giving me an average
4676.04s:  book value per share here you go this says like 438 it's that's a different that's a different
4683.16s:  metric so intrinsic value is kind of what the actual price if it unwound entirely so this says as
4694.92s:  a 14 aug 24 the intrinsic value is estimated to be 845 per share based on DCF now a discounted
4702.36s:  cashflow model is still kind of different I wouldn't use that in this case because it misses a
4706.92s:  lot of context it looks like it the other thing that chat GPT is saying is that the intrinsic value
4714.92s:  ranges between seven which is not true and 1109 which I think is a little bit low but I think
4720.76s:  using 11 is like a floor is reasonable again it's like a conservative reasonable floor
4727.64s:  but to me I would probably guess it I haven't ran it yet myself so I can't tell you
4732.28s:  but it's not hard to run I can download the fundamentals and look at again like the objective
4737.64s:  if we were to flatten this entire company what it was looking at but in this case I would guess
4743.48s:  somewhere around 12 that's my best guess like if I were to just swag what I think the current
4749.00s:  intrinsic value is now the problem with using an intrinsic value like that though is that you also
4755.80s:  taking it to account the IP intellectual properties the brand value itself and this does have that
4762.92s:  so that's also another reason why I think it might be a bit higher than those like generally super
4769.56s:  conservative estimates in my opinion so yeah
4775.88s:  Cedric says now we are 22 so let's six per share different on the books
4780.28s:  right well that's because again you have to remember when you're looking at the stock price of
4785.32s:  something you're looking at a forward projection it's an expectation so right now this is looking at
4791.72s:  like the future this is discounting the future cash flows this is what we think
4798.28s:  game stop will be able to produce over the next six to month time frame six to nine month time frame
4803.64s:  given what we know now so it's it's by its very nature a very conservative estimate
4813.32s:  so yeah I think nola says intrinsic value includes inventory physical real estate or negative value
4823.00s:  for a lease it depends on what model you use the the way that I like to think about
4829.08s:  intrinsic value is that if it had to start liquidating and essentially like closing out the
4834.76s:  business what would the value be per share so I think about something like a lease whatever
4841.56s:  value is remaining on the term of the lease that would have to be absorbed that would be negative
4847.24s:  but if we're going to unwind the physical real estate the current market value of the physical
4851.96s:  real estate would be whatever that value is so the the difference though in the way that I think
4857.88s:  about intrinsic value is that I don't think about like overnight liquidation because that would
4863.96s:  infer having to do things at like just a gree just prices right because of the time bound
4869.80s:  constraint you would have to sell things crazy so I think it is like a reasonable time frame for
4875.24s:  liquidation so that you can get like fair market value for things so Dan says I'm all in on GME
4883.96s:  yeah that's awesome I like again from a trader perspective the trader has to do whatever is
4889.16s:  right for them in this case I don't think GME is positioned poorly I think that right now
4895.08s:  it's running again like kind of consolidation that's the overall feel that I get here we're
4901.80s:  starting to build out this volume node you can see it breaking out right here that's starting to
4906.60s:  grow and grow and grow just as more people transact here this was also pretty cool to see people
4912.44s:  starting to buy in because my original idea which I was a little bit off but it's this I
4919.32s:  haven't moved this price handle which was like just around 18 so I used 18 just because it looked
4927.08s:  like near term support based on what we saw here and again like this is not something I added
4933.40s:  after the fact kind of what we were talking about before I added this before we started getting
4938.36s:  down here I added it when we're back up here because I was just curious where things were looking
4943.80s:  like they were going so when I see like price move here but you can see volume expanded that day
4953.16s:  so it was 93% by volume at 11 million shares where the average at that point for each day
4959.56s:  was 12.9 million shares so that was good to see that was like a lot of people buying
4964.92s:  at a specific value area that they thought so yeah that's kind of what I think about at least the
4972.52s:  the recent lower volume periods the options chains have also been much more quiet than I've typically
4981.64s:  have seen them which has been kind of interesting again let me know whatever else you guys want to
4987.64s:  look at I'm going to pivot back over to taking a look at the rest of this kind of like the new
4993.80s:  developments in the case and then but yeah like we literally can pivot as much as you guys want
5000.52s:  so you can see that there's been a bunch of stuff going on so the appearances and stuff
5009.64s:  yeah this is talking about like summons for things essentially everything has to be
5017.00s:  logged but the interesting stuff is way down here
5020.28s:  down down down down down but I think it's attachment five is the
5029.96s:  exhibit 40 let me double check I think this one is the deposition yeah this is the deposition
5038.44s:  so let me open this one here and then all as always give you guys the source
5045.96s:  so that you can look for yourselves and we'll grab the text so
5053.24s:  let me see if this starts here I haven't looked through four yet
5060.76s:  yes so I'm okay here we go let's see what this is
5069.56s:  so this is showing price volume data
5075.96s:  so we don't have to worry about that let's take a look here
5080.76s:  Paul and install says been swinging this from the beginning I'm feeling great and still transferred
5086.04s:  to the purple circle yeah that's great I think that's awesome I think something like GameStop
5091.72s:  when it's when it has volume I mean it has a ton of volatility it moves all over the place it
5096.76s:  really is a great trading vehicle so yeah
5104.36s:  Stephen Brown's dropping some random s stocks in here so I'm actually going to get rid of those
5109.00s:  because we don't need that floating around some random s bullshit if we want to take a look at it
5114.12s:  together I'm down but that didn't look like it that look like you're just sharing a random ass name
5119.64s:  all right so let's see you were investing more money in the GameStop correct I have invested since
5124.28s:  2019 and never sold my shares to date and you never shorted no not even one not that I believe
5134.60s:  uh you don't like short sellers that's correct
5139.72s:  so the queue obviously is the counter side the opposition and then the answer in this case is
5146.44s:  uh Cohen I believe you sent out a tweet 15th May saying taxpayer money should be spent
5154.12s:  cracking down on hedge funds and short sellers why did you do uh did you delete the tweet I don't think
5160.76s:  so so you don't believe that you deleted it I don't know can you show me the tweet well I I cannot
5168.68s:  because I couldn't find it it's not there in your page anymore so then it was deleted so this
5175.32s:  is really interesting the reason why attorneys do this is because they're
5183.64s:  to like non to the non initiated a lot of the questions that go down during a deposition can look
5191.88s:  really stupid but in fact they're not stupid they're very very very educated movements that
5200.68s:  they're making because one of the things that they're trying to do is essentially box in
5207.48s:  the response is given so that if it goes to trial they know what he's going to say
5213.64s:  and then if he says something else he looks it it creates a problem right because then they'll say
5219.96s:  something like oh well you said this during you know under oath why is it different now so
5227.00s:  that's why they're asking these questions so that if during trial he contradicts himself in any
5232.68s:  way it again will look not good um mr. Freena who is obviously Cohen's attorney says objection form
5244.68s:  witness no I don't remember well let me back up a little bit did you delete the tweet
5249.56s:  and then so right like they're trying to box him in just even on this stupid little thing the
5253.80s:  other thing to know about depositions is that it is literally it's just a war of attrition they
5259.16s:  have a certain amount of time that they can spend with people and their goal is to ask the same
5264.92s:  question in as many permutations as they can and part of it is just become it becomes like a
5270.12s:  metronome you feel like your answer in the same thing or you feel like you fully answered a question
5274.76s:  but in the attorneys mind you haven't because they want to close out the question so that's why
5279.24s:  you'll see stuff like this it's it's like really arduous to get through so Cohen says I've made
5285.32s:  multiple tweets and comments about the fact that I do not like both hedge funds and sort sellers what's
5289.56s:  the reason for that I think it's un-American to bet on and to profit from someone else's failure
5294.84s:  it's one thing not to invest in someone's success that's another thing to profit from someone's
5298.28s:  failure and I think it's un-American and it's illegal and it's legal and they're entitled to it but
5303.32s:  I don't like them like what a great answer I literally love that answer this says I mean that's
5309.32s:  my opinion I don't feel as people should profit on and bet on somebody else is going to fail
5314.44s:  and employ tactics in order to to increase the odds that they're going to be that they'll end up
5319.80s:  failing and that's what a lot of these hedge funds and sort sellers do yeah it's awesome
5323.32s:  why do you feel so strongly about the fact that they're un-American when you're not an American citizen
5329.00s:  that's so funny mr. Frieda says objection formed the witness says it's not about being a citizen
5336.28s:  being un-American it doesn't matter about whether it has nothing to do with citizenship
5342.36s:  then jafrey says so then has to do with innovation entrepreneurism the fact that this is the
5347.48s:  greatest country in the world less than 5% of the population is 25% GDP so much of innovation come
5353.88s:  out of America so then the other side says let me get to straight you don't like short sellers you
5359.96s:  want the government to crack down on them but you allowed your lawyers in this case to make filing
5364.76s:  saying that retail investors were croaked manipulators because they were trying to bet against
5370.60s:  shorts objection form I don't know what my lawyer said what I'd say with respect to hedge
5377.08s:  short failures that I find ironic that if you have a large position you just close that long
5380.92s:  position but if you have a short but if you short that position there's not the same kind of
5384.84s:  disclosure requirements which is a really great point but I believe there should be more transparency
5389.24s:  this is just absolutely like I love this uh haul and install says the vagueness in rc
5395.96s:  replies is is defining to the ears that think you might have meant deafening um to their ears
5402.68s:  hearts and minds I love it yeah well the other reason why he would answer like this is because if he's
5408.84s:  talking about like a previous recollection of some time ago again like he also doesn't want to
5412.84s:  contradict himself so his counsel they will coach him on how to answer all of this stuff so that's why
5420.44s:  a lot of the responses are going to be broader in nature because he's again being advised by really
5428.36s:  smart attorneys and he's doing his best to fall in line with again the the coaching that he got
5435.48s:  but you said more than that they're against entrepreneurship on americans so it's not just about
5440.04s:  the disclosures it's more than right uh more than that right and then the attorney uh the opposition
5446.92s:  says so I'm going to back to the questions about the filing in this case are you aware that there's
5451.48s:  a motion for class certification that's pending in this case he asks do you understand what it is
5458.60s:  uh then mr. Farina which is Cohen's attorney says I don't think he can have an understanding other
5465.40s:  than what he obtained from counsel then the other side says it's public document he can have an
5471.24s:  understanding of a public document and then he goes on to say unless mr. Farina tells you not to
5479.08s:  address my question you have to address my question would you like me to repeat it then Farina says
5484.76s:  well if you can address the question without anything that you've learned from your lawyer why
5488.60s:  don't you go ahead and repeat the question so they ask the question again have you read the motion
5494.12s:  for the certification and what's filed in this case so now the attorneys are going back and forth
5499.88s:  I'm not gonna go through all that so right now what they're trying to do is they're playing a
5506.68s:  game of like gotcha right they're just trying to see if they can get them to say something or do
5511.56s:  something and I think uh yeah they're just trying to play gotcha which is just super annoying
5521.40s:  my question was are you were the fact that your attorneys in your name have argued that the fact
5525.88s:  that people couldn't short BBBY stock enough meant that the market for that stock was inefficient
5532.28s:  so for those that don't know one of the arguments for efficient markets is the ability to short
5539.16s:  things because sometimes we know traders can bid things up to nosebleed levels and sometimes it's
5545.96s:  based on like FOMO euphoria it's not based on the actual value of the company itself necessarily
5552.36s:  so one of the arguments for short selling is that it does technically make markets more efficient by
5558.12s:  starting to press down some of that value until enough people oppose the selling value which
5564.52s:  would likely denote some sort of equilibrium where we both agree the short sellers are like okay
5569.64s:  well there's enough buyers here I can't I can't press a town anymore so this is where people actually
5576.12s:  think the stock is worth that's kind of the general argument behind it so they're just fighting back
5583.64s:  and forth I think we can skip through some of that this they're talking about attorney client
5591.96s:  privilege right so they're not talking about answering conversations behind these alfonso says
5598.60s:  not for nothing but Cohen bought his most recent shares in gme in march 22 and then liquid
5604.12s:  dated all BBBY shares five months after mid august in 22 RC ventures most recent 30F only holds gme
5612.44s:  yeah well I think in this case a lot of that is because he realized that he was going to run into
5617.08s:  structural issues when he was trying to get kind of start angling into best buy that was going to
5622.92s:  cause him problems so I think that's why he started is unwind R says what stopped shorting from just
5629.24s:  being bidding down problems the way bidding up was a problem it's inefficiency in both directions
5635.00s:  isn't it well that's the idea though is that because both directions are possible is that it would
5640.12s:  gain efficiency so again you can have something to your point that gets bid down like for example
5646.84s:  a great example of this I think is crowd strength because and again full disclosure I traded this
5652.68s:  because this movement so this was bid down into the dirt until people started to buy it and then
5659.80s:  now it's obviously moving back up towards some sort of accepted value broad accepted value for
5667.80s:  the price of the underlying now this will happen though because of information indiscreteness
5674.84s:  it takes time for information to permeate through a market and then to be positioned by people
5682.12s:  so this kind of thing again is because I sold this short to the downwind didn't sell it short I don't
5688.68s:  typically use that I use options to trade it to the downside but as it's running to the downside
5695.80s:  then there's a bunch of different reasons why this gets sent down so far until enough buyers
5703.32s:  start to step in they're like okay well I actually really like this all the way down here at 200
5709.00s:  so the short sellers start to get tired this movement becomes the representation of the failure that
5716.84s:  they had in the systems which overall to me didn't look quite that pervasive so ape of spade says
5724.52s:  we already have that it's called selling not so much selling again it that's it doesn't have the same
5730.28s:  effect as shorting because selling it's almost like the removal of something but it's not the active
5740.76s:  suppression of something so they're kind of different effects I wouldn't equate the process of like
5746.76s:  selling out of a position as short selling ape of spade says supply and demand can still exist yeah
5755.88s:  yeah no doubt there's absolutely no doubt I'm again I'm not arguing that short selling has to exist
5761.56s:  I'm not saying that at all but I'm simply talking about the way that people and again like from
5768.20s:  an objective analysis standpoint on why it's argued that short selling increases market efficiency
5774.92s:  because again like arguably it does so to to ape of spade's point and I get the point totally that
5782.84s:  essentially we can get to a point where like here that enough people are like okay I don't think
5788.28s:  crowd is crowd-check is worth more than this so then from here they stop buying and then price
5797.72s:  naturally could start to drift sideways but if you have people that can actively sell against it the
5803.48s:  process would happen faster because there's kind of a counter-opposing force our says I'm not arguing
5809.16s:  against short selling I'm just skeptical of efficiency arguments I don't know why I mean the the
5815.48s:  process of identifying like activities that make markets more efficient are kind of easy and
5821.00s:  clear to see now the secondary inter-shary effects of those obviously is up for debate and then whether
5829.64s:  or not we like the practice in and of itself is obviously up for debate but again like I can look
5835.96s:  at something like payment for order flow and that's that's it's objectively made markets more
5841.16s:  efficient we might not like it we might not like elements of it I don't I think it creates some
5846.76s:  fucked up incentives but I can still look back 50 years and I can say markets now are more efficient
5854.68s:  and one reason for it not saying the only reason but one reason for it is because a payment for
5860.12s:  order flow so if you have people competing to obtain order flow that competition will make things
5867.24s:  slightly more efficient your order execution your bit asks spread your price improvement again I
5871.64s:  don't think payment for order flow is great I think they're better systems it's not my favorite
5874.92s:  thing in the world but it's not it's not the again like the the boogieman um
5884.92s:  ape of spade says with efficiency can comes conflict of interest why I think anything related to
5889.96s:  financial markets is going to bring conflict of interest so yeah ours says I don't think market
5898.84s:  participants are motivated in their moves to make markets objective I think profit is created
5904.92s:  from differentials from price movement so the profit you want price to move right
5911.40s:  I'm not totally following the first part of your argument there but yeah for the second part
5918.28s:  I would agree with you that in order to make money you would want price to move in some sort of
5923.96s:  direction if you're buying equity or selling equity if you're buying or selling a product you
5930.36s:  would want it to move I agree with that yeah doctors a says more efficient in this context is a
5935.72s:  step in the wrong direction for most people yeah again I'm not sure I would fully agree with that
5942.36s:  I like markets now more than when I first started trading I and that's for a bunch of different
5948.20s:  reasons not only is it cheaper from a commission standpoint but I get better fills markets are now
5954.44s:  much narrower so yeah I mean for me I think markets being more efficient now it is good for me
5963.24s:  so again like if that's the ultimate stop or you know if people want it to be more efficient I
5968.60s:  think that's a completely fair argument and I think we're in a position that markets can be more
5972.20s:  efficient than they are now I agree with that Willie says can it be argued that payment for order
5980.20s:  if you flow contributes to monopolicistic practices I agree yeah now places like Citadel and virtue
5986.92s:  they're not necessarily the only entities that can enter or can run payment for order flow
5993.00s:  other people can enter that market but it's really competitive and it's hard to break into
5998.20s:  it's kind of like the the search engine market right like could there are there competitors for Google
6004.52s:  sure but it's really difficult to compete in that space that's what makes Ryan Cohen I think so
6011.80s:  fascinating because he was able to compete with Amazon with something like Chewie which is not an
6017.40s:  easy online market especially from a logistics standpoint so that kind of thing is crazy that he
6023.96s:  was able to do it but he was and he was very successful so yeah I think that willie to your point
6031.24s:  I agree with that but willie says payment for order flow itself is not a bad thing in itself but
6037.24s:  when a handful of firms that have that power it can be abused absolutely zero debate completely
6041.40s:  agree with it I also would even take that argument a step further and say that payment for order flow
6047.96s:  itself is I actually don't love that as an incentive I think it should be an open competition
6054.84s:  for order flow like I don't think it should be bundled because from an execution standpoint that
6060.60s:  actually disincentivizes the optimal order routing for your transaction which is really frustrating
6066.92s:  but again like even though that's the case the order routing even though it's not optimal it's
6073.16s:  still better than what it was that this is the nature of the game is that it's not exactly black and
6079.08s:  white there are shades of gray that have to be considered I think in order for it to be like a good
6084.20s:  discussion about the structure of markets so I completely agree with you willie I think that
6093.24s:  anytime you have money involved lots of money there's going to be bad actors that is that is how
6102.12s:  it's always going to go is soon as there are large buckets of money that are accessible
6109.88s:  there will be bad actors I guarantee it always going to be the case and that's I mean just how
6114.84s:  things go like the the people that want to try to take advantage of things they're always there
6120.92s:  and they shape shift over time but they're still there they just take different forms as things
6126.92s:  evolve Alfonso says home computers and the internet have brought efficiency I remember my dad
6133.00s:  getting phone calls it dinner to confirm his traits that he placed by his phone earlier yeah that's
6137.08s:  hilarious that's so true beach says who do you have in the UFC main event tonight I don't
6143.16s:  know who's in the UFC tonight I was looking at the Craig Jones invitational first I really want to
6149.00s:  see him in in Gabby because I just think that's going to be hilarious I also want to know who
6153.40s:  want to I haven't I was watching yesterday stuff earlier so let me see at the UFC card tonight
6159.16s:  was that is that easy and do plusy tonight or am I making that up it is oh man man that's a
6174.92s:  toughy
6180.84s:  fuck that is such a tough that is such a tough card
6188.36s:  who's the what are the odds on it
6194.20s:  so it has easy it is easy is the minus 130 I could see that I mean from a striking perspective I
6204.60s:  would have to give it to Izzy from a striking perspective no doubt but Izzy I feel like he hasn't
6213.80s:  really been showing up as he like as good as he has been even like that fight with
6221.08s:  Strickland showed that so it would not shock me to see do plusy win but like I would have to
6231.24s:  agree with the odds on Izzy I think that that's a fair I think that's a fair line
6243.40s:  now you got me looking at oh how did Jenkins do you want that's good
6249.00s:  I'm glad Jenkins won all right I'll get out of UFC you fucking set me down a tangent you always
6254.12s:  know I'm down to look at some fight stuff but yeah I would I would have to lean towards Izzy
6261.64s:  personally all right let's poke through this a little bit more and then I want to take a look at
6266.20s:  Chewy a little bit Nola says Chewy calls when kind of crazy Friday afternoon huh yeah we'll take
6273.88s:  a look at that for sure I'm trying to see if there's any other like really interesting
6283.64s:  bits that they got out of here this looks interesting
6295.40s:  Hugh no it's in it but I think that my question is a little different which is when it comes to
6301.00s:  those people who interpret your tweets like the ones you discussed with Joe Fonacelo like people
6307.56s:  on Twitter who respond with your tweets you've never tried to correct them in any way and say that
6312.44s:  you are misunderstanding with I meant my tweets are just being or just me being me there I don't
6320.76s:  know what tweets you're referring to I don't know what comments you're talking about and you're
6324.68s:  again you're talking about people as in they are speaking in generalities so if you have a specific
6331.16s:  question I'll answer it but I don't understand these generalities it's impossible to answer the
6334.68s:  question that's a great that's a great response by the way so right now there what it seems like
6342.60s:  what they're trying to do is to start creating a line between his tweets as possible drivers of
6349.64s:  movement and in this line of questioning they're trying to say well you're not necessarily outright
6355.24s:  saying you know you listen to these things of what I'm doing but you're also not correcting people
6362.28s:  when they're misinterpreting your stuff so they're trying to catch them with like the no is what
6367.64s:  that looks like which is against super annoying I'm specifically referring to Twitter yes in which
6373.72s:  comment on Twitter and which post that I make any comment do you recall even one instance I really
6378.28s:  reply to my comments sure that's not my question mr. Cohen do you recall even one instance where you
6383.40s:  posted something and someone interpreted a meaning and you said that's not correct I don't remember
6388.12s:  that's hilarious and it looks like the the reporter needed to take a break there
6396.36s:  can we focus on the final sentence here in the third paragraph you know the one that started with
6400.20s:  as a role model among apes we talked that about it already you know in that final sentence here yeah
6406.84s:  when it says any news about the investors often enough to generate positive sentiment among apes
6412.60s:  active on reddit hey shout out to you guys do you see that yes okay now have you seen another
6419.96s:  article saying that they have that specific thing that we just read to you I don't remember okay
6426.20s:  but you may have no I meant I don't what I said is I don't remember okay now you've never eat now
6433.72s:  you've never gone at shit I fucked that up sorry now you've never gone ever publicly and said I'm
6440.76s:  not a role model for the apes I don't believe so okay and you've never gone and publicly said
6447.24s:  I've never said I'm a role model for the apes either please let me finish my question that's just
6451.00s:  jockeying for a position you never gone and said that you're not influential among this community
6456.92s:  of retail investors I've never said that I was that wasn't my question you've never said that you
6461.96s:  weren't correct so that that's all this is they are trying to catch him with noils right because
6470.12s:  obviously like who would go on social media and for example with Jeff Reapstein and all the
6477.88s:  bull crap that he did did everybody have to go on social media and be like I don't agree with that
6486.84s:  no like it's kind of inherent that what the did what the dude did was shitty and it was like most
6494.68s:  people don't agree with that so in this case they're they're trying to start lining them up for
6499.64s:  well you've never explicitly said you're not this thing which is crazy absolutely crazy especially
6506.60s:  because the way he communicates on twitter or x right like if you look through his stuff a lot of it
6514.84s:  is jokes like this like he's just playing games so that's like the whole the whole point of he's a troll
6527.88s:  so this is kind of nuts okay you have publicly said nothing in fact to assert that you do not
6535.96s:  influence stock prices like this who would go out of their way to say like I don't influence stock
6544.84s:  prices I don't believe so and you've never said that I Ryan Cohen don't generate positive sentiment
6552.68s:  among meme stock investors on Reddit this I never said I do but you've never said I didn't right
6561.16s:  I don't believe so so you never contested any of so then he goes into investment advice stuff
6569.80s:  my question wasn't about you know whether you should provide an investment advice your question
6575.08s:  is putting words in my mouth yeah yeah yeah you're this honestly this this from the door leave that
6585.96s:  this from the attorney is hilarious from the opposing counsel this is this is literally hilarious
6593.40s:  you're giving me a justification for why you didn't do this I understand I'm not interested and I don't
6600.20s:  it's just a funny line from the from the opposing counsel
6606.04s:  alfonso says must trolls much much harder than Cohen must absolutely does that's the funny part
6611.00s:  is that a lot of these guys are just trolling but in this case they're trying to they're trying to use
6615.56s:  it against them my question is very very simple you've never gone and said something like you know
6621.24s:  please stop saying that I generate positive sentiment against these so-called apes on Reddit you never
6626.12s:  done that answer I've answered your question which is a yes that you've never done it I answered your
6631.00s:  question what was the answer is it yes or no it's a simple yes or no you can go through the transcript
6637.40s:  and you'll see my answer to well I think you said yes to some of the things and I don't know why
6642.20s:  you're struggling so much with this one again this is this is quintessential they're trying to fatigue him
6648.68s:  that's why Cohen is starting to answer like this because he's starting to become slightly belligerent
6654.84s:  and this actually doesn't normally bowed well for his argument because it does make him start to
6661.88s:  look slightly belligerent I would understand why I would be furious with this this this would get
6666.92s:  so old so fast but this it's also it's part of the game and it's why they're doing this is they're
6674.68s:  purposely trying to they're trying to do this so then when I told you have you ever said for instance
6686.20s:  that you don't have influence on stock prices you said that you haven't so this is a very similar
6690.28s:  question it's just about a different topic which is have you ever said that you don't generate
6694.92s:  positive sentiment among the apes on Reddit publicly I don't know you haven't right no I mean I
6699.88s:  don't know you don't recall any instance right so again this is them trying to close out the topic
6705.32s:  recall any instance it's it's very purposely phrased like that these these can seem like really
6713.48s:  stupid questions and they kind of are in a sense but they're really calculated I just try to remind
6719.16s:  you guys of that because some people can look at this and kind of just think like oh what what is
6723.48s:  all this buffoonery but it's actually really really tactical what they're trying to do
6729.40s:  you don't recall any instance you can't tell me one example where you have publicly said it I don't
6733.08s:  know okay I don't remember every single thing that I've said so then
6745.00s:  very very slow transformation that the company especially going into a macro time a lot of
6748.76s:  uncertainty given the balance she you see all that right yep so he's obviously talking about a
6752.92s:  specific documentation or tweet that he said he said so when you said that I you is it true
6760.20s:  that you said that to the company did not have the balance sheet to transform the business answer
6764.92s:  I don't remember exactly these are not my notes okay but do you believe that the company did not
6769.56s:  have the balance sheet to do a transformation I believe that the company was doing a lot worse than
6773.88s:  I expected in losing a lot of money I didn't have visibility obviously into the future trajectory
6779.16s:  but based on what I saw in the previous corner the company was using a lot of money so again
6783.48s:  they're trying to now tie Cohen to the perception of the stock which was one of the things if you
6789.88s:  remember from the first document that they're trying to contest that they were providing a skewed
6794.44s:  perception of the stock let's see the final section of the page here says again is attributed to
6803.80s:  it says rc do you see that but operationalizing a plan you see that so it says but operationalizing
6810.36s:  a plan sgna at 33% is insustainable in GM contracting by 400 bps so back to sgna mid 20% will involve
6819.56s:  pretty significant changes in the company given the macro backdrop we're heading into probably some
6823.80s:  big changes is it true that you wanted the company to come back to cut back on its sgna expenses
6831.00s:  to get it down to the mid 20% I wanted them to reduce expenses yes to mid 20% I mean that sounded
6836.84s:  like a good target okay and that number happened while you were invested correct I don't believe so
6842.76s:  and then the answer says and then over here does this jog your memory where it says we scrap the 2020
6848.12s:  plan I don't remember that I think it was and this is a funny comment I think this was 150 page
6859.00s:  god knows what they paid McKinsey to two talking about how they were going to have private label all
6863.72s:  kinds of things and I thought it was crazy and I said in the letter thought it was crazy did it
6867.88s:  that but they never changed their behavior so they're just going back and forth now about the
6873.16s:  operation of the company and how it was doing let's see so this one says so you wrote given
6880.92s:  that I'm going to be in the market buying I'd like to cancel the call and ask her to speak next week
6886.28s:  no less says so as an activist investor he RC ran into resistance from the board
6891.08s:  out in the direction he was interested in taking the company that definitely seems part of it
6895.32s:  I don't know exactly what ended up making him divest so let's see I'll ask Chattatubt
6901.88s:  when Ryan Cohen bought into BBBY what ended up making him divest see what that comes up with
6915.40s:  after initially buying into the company earlier that year the diet the decision to divest was
6921.32s:  interested but influenced by a combination of factors including the lack of substantial progress
6925.88s:  and turning around the company as well as growing concerns about the financial stability so I
6930.84s:  think there was a there's a lot more to it than that I don't remember all the details but I know
6935.88s:  that there was a significant change in the backdrop and he definitely didn't like the direction
6944.84s:  that things were going now I also think that there was a couple forcing functions that came with
6948.68s:  his size that he came in at and then what he was trying to grow up into a funzus says but the law
6955.24s:  suit asked for a return of short swing profits on his sale of BBBY sales per section SEC rule 16B
6962.76s:  I yeah a funzus says I don't see any impact on GME well I think the impact that this can have on
6968.60s:  GME is that while Ryan Cohen is wrapped up in any sort of litigation it just is immediately going
6975.96s:  to complicate other stuff that he does to your point I don't think that this prevents him from
6980.92s:  running GME I don't think that this has a direct impact on GME but I would kind of I would
6988.28s:  frame it that there's a secondary and a tertiary effect that this will have on GME just again in
6994.68s:  the sense that the CEO of GME is wrapped up in this other litigation so even down to a simple
7001.16s:  as this is something on the back of his mind that he has to deal with while he's trying to run
7007.00s:  another company that again like we have to be honest with ourselves game stop has to innovate here
7011.56s:  it has to change things quite a bit in order to kind of really rise into what it can be and that
7017.08s:  requires a ton of effort and for most CEOs that is a full time effort it's not like I have to spend
7025.32s:  30% of my time dealing with this case and then 70% of my time trying to grow this company most of
7031.32s:  those kinds of transformations take like the majority of effort so even from just a drain perspective
7039.24s:  this in my opinion will have an impact hopefully and I think so far he's done a great job like he's
7045.00s:  obviously super resilient this isn't like killing him or anything you can even tell from the way
7049.56s:  that he's trolling and still having fun but again it's just in the backdrop it's something that's there
7056.44s:  raspberry pizza says it's the bbysio in the board leading up to the bankruptcy that totally misled
7062.12s:  people that need to be sued straight up lies that's kind of the general thing that I've been noticing
7067.72s:  it looks like he's been wrapped into this for a few different reasons so here they're he's talking
7075.80s:  about like what he's gotten into and why this is interesting did you know did you question her
7084.92s:  about whether there was bankruptcy risk I don't believe so so we'll show you one dot so this is
7089.48s:  also really common which is super annoying so a lot of times in these kind of depositions the
7096.60s:  council will ask you about something that they already have shit on and they won't show it to you
7102.36s:  unless you ask for it and you know to ask for it so in this case when he said you know did you
7108.04s:  question her about whether there's bankruptcy risk I don't believe so and then he says oh well
7111.96s:  let's take a look at this document right so it's like those kinds of things are really really
7117.56s:  frustrating because it's so easy then to double back on yourself unnecessarily
7127.08s:  hmm just seeing if there's anything else that like really sticks out to me as I scan through it
7133.48s:  this overall just looks like kind of a standard deposition I like a lot of the things that
7138.12s:  Cohen said I think he's handling it overall really really well but as you can tell it's just tiring
7145.40s:  like it's just annoying to go through this
7147.64s:  um
7153.64s:  if you're going to ask him about the motion then show him the motion and ask him whether
7157.08s:  sit like this is another that's funny that I stopped here this is another like
7162.20s:  very specific example about this very specific thing so he said the next thing I want to
7167.24s:  address with are you aware of the factual representation on your behalf that were made in the
7171.08s:  motion to dismiss about this tweet right so like again he's asking him about a document and he
7178.20s:  hasn't shown him the document so his lawyer is like yo if you're going to ask him about this thing
7183.16s:  then show it to him and then ask him about it so
7189.32s:  for instance I would suggest you take the document if you want to ask him about it right so
7194.60s:  yeah it's just like standard super annoying lame practice but it's how it gets done this stuff
7200.68s:  is so annoying man uh oh I saw the word trading hold on I got to look
7207.32s:  you want to know how long this will take am I prevented from trading in the meantime can this be
7212.60s:  done today the answer I was not trading so then they're saying they're questioning so then why were
7218.20s:  you telling him that you why were you questioning him about whether or not you could prevent from
7223.64s:  trading because my bank told me that I was prevented from trading I told him what the bank said okay
7229.88s:  and why did you contact the bank because I was interested in being able to trade
7235.72s:  being able to trade and do what that being able to trade sell depending on the price
7241.40s:  so you were thinking of buying shares on this day depending on what the price would have been so
7245.56s:  they're going back and forth now about like this trading thing did you have a thought in your head
7251.80s:  on this day that you might be that you might buy shares of bv y my dog is letting me know I need to
7259.96s:  open the door I think for him he's going to go now how and I'm going to text my wife real quick
7275.56s:  and ask her to feed him because I believe that's what he's looking for he's looking for his dinner
7282.04s:  rightfully so it's about dinner time I think my barbecue should be here in a little bit
7287.56s:  depending on the price which what what he would have done obviously but my question is nothing
7292.04s:  to do with the response my question was whether at any point you thought about buying shares on
7297.24s:  August 15th I don't remember what I was thinking on that day okay so since it's based on your
7302.28s:  testimony then you obviously didn't tell Nebel on this day that you were selling shares correct
7307.80s:  I was not selling shares on that day so you only told him that you were trading I told him what's in
7313.16s:  the email that you were contemplating trading he was in communication with the bank that I was
7319.88s:  contemplating trading and I wanted the option to be able to trade so this is just this is going
7324.44s:  back to trying to contradict his intent they're trying to say like you were doing this one thing but
7329.96s:  you were talking about this other thing I wonder what the average duration is for a deposition
7339.96s:  because I actually think there's rules about how long it can go for how long can a deposition go for
7352.52s:  the duration can vary widely depending on the complexity the number of parties generally deposition's
7357.80s:  last a few hours but they can extend to a full day or even multiple days in federal cases there
7363.56s:  is typically a seven hour limit for a deposition in a single day unless the court orders otherwise
7370.28s:  although however the parties can agree to extend this time if necessary that's brutal man
7374.04s:  they imagine doing this for seven hours seven hours
7380.52s:  shit again this goes back to I think it was Alfonso's point right about like the impact to me
7389.64s:  like that that's an impact man like I'm fatigued just trying to read this right and you can see
7395.08s:  he's starting to get more and more frustrated literally even in his written responses I can see
7400.36s:  him becoming more belligerent that's my statement those are not my words these are his right like
7406.52s:  so like he's becoming more and more bullet rightfully so I would be too like this this is
7412.52s:  absolutely exhausting to deal with how does this end I just feel like this I just told it like
7424.20s:  even the the council is getting upset so I mean it's not surprising so anyways that looks like
7433.88s:  kind of the heart and soul of the overall deposition which bam bro I just opened that one I'm
7445.40s:  just seeing if there's anything else interesting in here
7447.32s:  yeah
7452.04s:  uh Cedric is asking for the link again you got it here is the link right there
7471.56s:  you got it Cedric anything else we want to take a look at
7475.96s:  that was kind of fun I wanted to spend a little time going through the the case just because
7480.84s:  I was really interested to again learn a little bit more about he handled the situation what it
7487.32s:  looked like what kind of things they're talking about and also to Alfonso's point what kind of
7491.56s:  potential impacts that I think it could have in his operation of something like GameStop if
7496.92s:  there's any potential carryover and again I don't really see a lot of that I just see a really
7503.00s:  arduous annoying process to have to tolerate like that's what it looks like it doesn't look fun
7508.04s:  it looks like a lot of effort that goes into answering the same questions over and over again
7513.00s:  which looks like pretty freaking fatiguing to me to be honest so that's what I have for that now
7518.76s:  the other thing I did want to look at quickly before I wrap is uh Chui and it's because Chui has been
7528.36s:  starting to gain some legs right a little bit different here and you can see where I got
7532.92s:  interested in Chui so as soon as it broke above this 2524 handle is when I started biting a little
7541.00s:  bit I don't have a big position but um I definitely am interested in seeing like where this runs to
7547.40s:  the upside if it doesn't I mean if it stops me out at 2524 I don't really care it's not really
7552.76s:  that's not going to hurt me that would just be flat on the trade
7558.60s:  raspberry says nice to see RC in action dudes and mystery amazed that he even did that
7563.16s:  GME interview yeah I agree because that's in exactly to your point raspberry because like
7568.20s:  we don't have a chance he's not doing stuff like this he's not jumping on a bunch of live streams
7572.76s:  he's not doing a ton of other things of onzo says is this for non payment of BCG for consulting
7579.96s:  services now it's completely different I think that's already done and gone the this case is
7585.56s:  clearly more so about manipulation so they're trying to frame it as if he knew BBBY was doing
7592.92s:  terribly and he was putting out a different message so that then he could sell his shares for
7598.28s:  for a profit that's essentially what they're trying to say so I think that other madness with
7605.64s:  BCG is a completely different thing I think that was like 30 million dollars or something in like
7612.12s:  unpaid stuff to them which up that was pretty interesting but yeah anyways so
7622.52s:  chewy's been looking interesting it does have earnings coming up on
7628.28s:  the 28th so that's part of the activity that you see there and then GME has earnings
7633.48s:  still coming up on what is it the 4th September 4th I believe I don't know why it's not showing up
7644.20s:  on this one normally it does let me yeah
7654.60s:  yeah it might be just because there's too much crap on here right now on on this one over here
7664.44s:  but yeah so this and the reason why that's been so interesting is because the expiration that
7670.12s:  contains earnings is so low I would expect this to be much higher but it's not I haven't really
7680.12s:  been able to make quite heads or tails on that just yet but you can see that the options chain
7685.16s:  has now just become so anemic after everything from the past week was stripped out the bulk obviously
7693.24s:  of the volume was in the last expiration cycle and now you can also see that the open interest
7698.68s:  across the board is just a crap shoot it's all over the place but the bigger positions are actually
7704.04s:  pretty far out in time there's 17 Jan 25 like we don't have a bunch here yet in 23
7714.04s:  hog and the next primary expiration is 27 which there's just not much build out yet
7722.60s:  nola nola says it makes all the social media post up for microscopic scrutiny even up to today
7728.52s:  absolutely yeah absolutely that's one of the the most annoying parts about that it essentially
7733.80s:  makes everything under scrutiny like even if he was texting with his friends and you know like having
7739.64s:  like like a standard joke between friends that can be added as evidence for whatever reason not
7746.36s:  saying in this case but in general like though they'll purposely go through literally literally
7751.40s:  everything which is super annoying now to your point though it's also I think one of the reasons
7760.04s:  why he's trolling the way that he is because it's kind of continuing to second the fact that he's
7766.52s:  you know a troll he enjoys just playing jokes and not taking it super seriously so
7774.04s:  Raspberry says hoping to get out of my 20 steps unscathed and throw that into jans
7780.12s:  yeah the problem with 20 sap is depending on the position you're gonna start running into like
7787.48s:  pretty accelerated faded decay so Afonso says Chewie volume doesn't see to be linked to share price
7796.84s:  what do you mean Chewie what you mean Willis looks like it's definitely linked here
7806.20s:  big drive up here big drive up here here I think it does
7817.16s:  we're talking about you talk about this move even this move it's important to I think it's important
7824.84s:  to keep things in context right so this move here the 20 day average volume is going to be super skewed
7835.32s:  by this stuff so let me grab let me grab this really quick I have another version of this
7845.72s:  is this yeah okay this is the right one
7865.00s:  so I'm just gonna swap it out so that you can see a little bit but Afonso what's your specific
7870.68s:  question because to me I actually don't I don't I don't follow your point because to me I feel
7878.52s:  feel like it's there no this is those are pure green volume exactly so to me it's like massive massive
7888.12s:  buying pressure
7894.68s:  if I change where am I oops
7905.96s:  yes so if I change this let's do instead of 20 let's do what the past
7912.20s:  10 days looks fine so if you do 10 day M a there yeah so even this is
7918.52s:  exceeding the 10 day average right so like the the previous 10 days in here which is getting rid of this
7928.60s:  but the volume on this day was 4.8 million which was 93% by volume and then the average volume at
7935.08s:  that point for the day in total was 4.686 million so it literally had more by only volume on that day
7943.72s:  than the total average for the past 10 days so yeah I'm not exactly sure what you're looking at but
7949.80s:  for me that that looks super bullish again it's it's all in context it's none of these things
7957.40s:  typically are going to be you know like the most discrete answers or the clearest things on
7962.60s:  planet earth but at least for me like volume is is pretty consistent so like here on most of these
7970.36s:  upmoves like I can see volume behaving a certain kind of way so yeah to me I feel like chewy volume
7977.80s:  just like anything else I don't think it's specific to chewy or really anything like if you
7982.20s:  look at GameStop we were just looking at this the upward price moving that that it had here it was
7987.72s:  definitely again if I close this time frame down it will be about close to average but it's like
7994.20s:  all by volume so there's definitely people that are looking to get along the product so
8004.28s:  all right gang I think this might be my longest live stream ever but super super fun love hanging
8009.16s:  out with you guys like I said I'm in I was just chatting with Newton to see what we want to try to
8014.12s:  set up another joint session to you know see what's good for his schedule I know he's getting busy
8018.20s:  now with the school year starting and stuff but as always whatever you guys need just let me know
8022.92s:  hit me up in the discord you can hit me up on the video comments or whatever works for you works
8028.12s:  for me but I always love doing this with you all I think next week I'll either do this on Thursday
8034.68s:  or Saturday undecided yet but I'm gonna keep the cadence going once I start something I tend to
