0.76s: what's up you guys taking another look
2.08s: at roaring Kitty's position from
4.72s: yesterday because I was in the middle of
6.56s: making a video he dropped his position
8.72s: and I shared a hypothesis that I don't
10.96s: think is accurate so I want to walk
12.68s: through what I'm seeing what it could
14.80s: mean and essentially why nobody can tell
18.20s: definitively what's going on here now a
20.36s: couple things you guys have been sharing
22.36s: so much of the background of roaring
25.20s: Kitty the way he behaves which is
26.64s: actually really useful for me and one of
28.12s: the things you guys said is hey he seems
29.56s: to exercises options a lot can you take
31.16s: another look and absolutely and as we
33.72s: take a look at this it absolutely could
35.80s: be the case but it's kind of a bit of a
38.68s: stretch in different ways depending on
40.32s: the scenario we're looking at but some
41.72s: of them are very plausible so let's
44.08s: quickly recap what his position was on
46.12s: the 10th of June which is long 5 million
48.88s: shares at $212
51.48s: 74 and he was long $10,000 of the 20
55.20s: calls at $567 54 now couple things right
58.96s: out of the gate these are Big positions
61.52s: when you're trading 5 million shares
63.44s: 120,000 contracts of options you don't
66.12s: just enter a single order to get into
68.52s: that position it's something that you
70.28s: scale into over time and the reason
73.04s: being is you don't want to bid yourself
74.88s: up the other thing is in order to get
77.64s: essentially reasonable fills instead of
81.20s: just getting killed by submitting some
83.28s: sort of Market order to get a fill at
85.32s: that you again would scale into the
87.72s: position over some time so that tells us
90.52s: an important fact meaning he averaged
93.52s: into these
94.96s: positions we can also determine that and
97.88s: confirm it by the fact that there's more
99.56s: than two decimals on all these prices
101.56s: meaning the average price paid varied
104.08s: more big positions scaled into over time
106.96s: all kind of checks out the reason why
109.08s: that matters is because that tells us
110.68s: specifically on these calls that some of
113.68s: the premium he paid was above this price
116.08s: some of it was below this price how much
119.12s: higher and how many of those contracts
121.12s: we don't know and same thing to the
123.04s: downside so it makes it really really
125.00s: difficult to pinpoint what the premium
127.88s: he would have paid on the exercised
130.44s: options which is what we're using to try
132.60s: to determine if that's what he did so
135.92s: I'll show you what I mean by that now a
138.44s: really probable scenario here is that he
140.84s: could have exercised
142.96s: 4,010 of those 20 calls that accounts
146.32s: for the number variance here it doesn't
149.36s: account for the cost variance here which
151.76s: is important it could but it doesn't
155.36s: outright equate which is unfortunate
157.60s: because if it did it would have been a
158.64s: much easier problem but I guess that
160.24s: would have been less fun at least for me
161.60s: because I like looking at this stuff so
164.72s: we'll kind of walk through the math of
166.40s: that now one of my favorite scenarios
168.64s: that I have to give a shout out just
170.28s: because it's so off the top rope is the
173.28s: scenario that he might have sold all 5
175.72s: million shares and then
177.84s: exercised 90,000 in 10 options which
181.68s: we'll take a look at that scenario as
183.12s: well I think that's probably lower
185.96s: probability much lower but not again
188.92s: impossible so let's take a look at some
192.08s: math what I did up here is show you the
196.40s: original position on the 10th of June
198.12s: for the
199.40s: equities and then the same thing on the
201.84s: 13th of June now one important admin
204.16s: note is actually when you multiply his
206.52s: new bases of 23 4135 by 9 million 1,000
211.28s: shares it's it's crazy to use these size
213.76s: of a positions in GameStop for a retail
215.96s: Trader it's hilarious to me but as you
219.68s: do that math it actually doesn't come
221.32s: out to this it comes out to like 21074 n
223.92s: in change the reason why that matters is
228.48s: because I'm using what he has here on
231.48s: the platform which might account for
233.16s: some other costs or whatever the case is
235.52s: I can't say for sure but just noting
238.60s: that variance
240.32s: so if we take a look at the difference
242.60s: between what his Equity position was and
244.52s: what it became we can figure out
246.16s: essentially how much he bought and how
247.92s: much he bought per share so in this case
250.24s: the cost variance between these two is
252.24s: 104 374 465 the share Delta we already
256.16s: know is 4, 1,000 so that comes out to a
258.96s: cost per share of
260.96s: $269 now let's take a look at this
264.08s: scenario here where we exercise 40,1
267.36s: options that essentially brings us to a
271.68s: slightly different number the combined
275.52s: assigned or exercise basis in this case
278.08s: would be
278.92s: $256 754 we're taking the strike price
282.04s: adding the premium this is what the
284.20s: broker would calculate within the
285.48s: platform here this is different than
287.80s: what the exact transaction cost would be
291.36s: for the shares on the market which would
292.88s: be at the strike price but after these
295.32s: Shares are added at the
297.32s: $20 purchase price the broker can then
300.40s: marry the premium paid in the scenario
303.96s: so that leads us to
306.68s: 26754 which is quite a bit off on a
310.00s: percentage basis as well from this 2609
312.60s: it might not seem like a lot 41 cents
314.64s: but that's definitely a lot on a
316.88s: relative basis and if we take a look at
319.36s: that exercise cost in the scenario of
321.72s: 40,000 and10 contracts the cost variance
327.36s: between what we see now as the
330.40s: difference between these two which is
333.00s: 104 374 this would show it as 102
338.04s: 727 close but still off by $1.65 million
343.56s: that's not an insignificant amount of
345.84s: money now this could be explained by the
349.36s: fact that this is a small subset of this
353.76s: 12,000 lot position it's essentially a
356.68s: third so because it's a smaller subset
360.12s: depending on whether he's using first
361.72s: and first out fifo or lifo last and
364.00s: first out and depending on the relative
366.32s: cost on the premium of the options that
368.76s: he happened to have exercised this is
371.76s: not outside the realm of possibility for
374.56s: this 41 cents to come out here it's not
377.64s: crazy and because this is a smaller
380.12s: subset of this that absolutely means
383.28s: that there're can be a higher variance
385.52s: from the average so that's within the
387.92s: realm of possibility for sure now
390.08s: another scenario somebody threw out the
391.72s: crazy one I like is exercising 90,000
395.04s: and10 the problem is the variance is
397.60s: massive now this is wrong here this
400.08s: shouldn't be comparing it just to the
402.16s: equity it should be comparing the total
403.96s: cost in this scenario so the total cost
406.64s: here would be
408.48s: 23114 275 and his cost was 210 744 so
413.40s: that's a a big variance I just probably
417.08s: wouldn't see that happening because the
418.48s: other thing is it would not account well
421.84s: at this point cuz now instead of it just
423.64s: being essentially a third it becomes 3/4
427.04s: right 90,000 and10 to the
429.88s: 120,000 so then the probability there of
432.48s: a big variance from this average price
434.40s: goes down so I don't see that one quite
437.72s: as plausible in this scenario so all of
440.60s: this is to summarize a few things one we
442.48s: don't know definitively two he
444.24s: absolutely could have exercised some
446.56s: number of contracts in bought shares he
449.12s: also absolutely could have simply sold
451.84s: all of this and then bought shares
453.92s: because if we take a look at the price
455.28s: of GameStop over the period that he
457.04s: would have been buying shares it was
458.32s: trading all around essentially this
460.40s: exact basis the 2609 so it's entirely
464.24s: possible we don't fully know and the
467.32s: impact doesn't seem to be severe at
470.04s: least as of now because when we take a
472.24s: look at the way that GameStop behaved
473.96s: today really inside day it had lower
477.28s: than average volume this is looking at a
480.08s: 22-day period for the average just to be
482.72s: clear and it was mostly sale volume
485.36s: today we also saw just in terms of price
487.68s: a very inside day the range for today
491.20s: was 1186 the 5day average daily range
494.12s: was
495.36s: 2524 and the 11-day average range is
498.64s: 3252 so pretty significantly less than
502.24s: those other reference
503.68s: periods now if we take a look at the
506.32s: options chain quickly and we go to
508.20s: Roaring Kitty strikes I still think this
509.84s: 20 strike is his all the same he put his
512.92s: footprint on it it still has a lot of
515.84s: open interest 64,000 718 contracts now a
519.68s: big drop from yesterday which we
521.20s: expected
522.76s: 58,4 and a lower volume today of 12,468
526.48s: but there's still people in this for
527.76s: sure and it's super deep in the money at
529.76s: this point it's uh one Delta now there
532.72s: are a couple other centralizations that
534.52s: I see at the 30s there's 57,8 two but
538.96s: today there was massive volume 46010 we
541.76s: don't know if that's opening or closing
543.12s: just yet but that's just something to
546.28s: note so either this number will probably
548.16s: go up pretty significantly or start to
550.12s: contract my guess is probably the latter
552.28s: but we don't know and same thing for a
554.88s: couple other these noteworthy strikes
556.92s: like the 35 and also the 40 the other
561.76s: thing I see here is the implied
563.80s: volatility across these expiration
565.64s: Cycles has contracted massively it's
568.08s: cratered this was above 300 before and
572.08s: now it's below 250 same thing for
574.96s: essentially the the next few series the
577.64s: other thing I noticed here is that if we
579.00s: look at the call open interest compared
581.28s: to the put open interest if you look at
582.88s: the videos that we did the past few days
585.80s: these used to be much bigger disparity
588.36s: for the calls even excluding roaring
591.32s: Kitty's position there was still a lot
592.56s: of participation skewing this these are
594.64s: now starting to normalize we typically
596.44s: would see more puts than calls people
599.08s: tend to hedge to the downside with
600.72s: options rather than speculate to the
602.48s: upside in Mass at least obviously an
604.72s: anomaly here that we're looking at so it
608.24s: looks like there's still a little bit
609.40s: more to the story perhaps roring Kitty
611.60s: will let us know but he also is the
614.00s: master of mirrors he has my head in a
615.56s: blender trying to figure out what's
616.64s: going on here and it's super fun to try
619.20s: to figure it out so I'm really thankful
621.32s: to learn along you guys about the
624.64s: history of this stuff and talk about
626.48s: options so thanks for sharing so much
628.36s: with me if there's anything else that I
630.32s: can help with or if any questions you
632.04s: guys have just let me know and see you
634.64s: guys later
