0.00s:  you
0.00s:  What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the outlier podcast where we talk about all things
7.60s:  extraordinary. I'm here with David Hunter yet again for another conversation. I was actually looking
13.52s:  back at our conversations and I think we started connecting in the spring of 22. So it's been
20.08s:  about two years. I wanted to wish you a happy anniversary. It's been great for me. I hope it's
24.56s:  been great for you. Yeah, it's been great Eric. Great to know you. So we were literally just talking
30.64s:  off air for a couple of seconds just about how interesting things are and I feel like every time
36.40s:  we connect, you know, you and I maintain like a quarterly cadence give or take and there's always
43.04s:  stuff that pops up. So I honestly would love to just start right there with you as you think about
48.40s:  the markets today and as you think about the economy, the world today specifically over the last
52.88s:  week or so like what's jumping out at you? Yeah, it's definitely been a period where the markets
59.68s:  are nervous and given lots of reasons to be nervous, you know, it started out weeks ago with
65.20s:  inflation kind of raising its ugly head and everybody was kind of expecting inflation to be
72.32s:  trending further down from here from where it was when it came into this year and instead it
77.60s:  went the other way for, you know, less two or three months. Excuse me. And so, you know, you had
83.44s:  the bond market back up. You had investors get nervous that the Fed's not going to cut and start
90.24s:  out with, well, it's not six cuts. May it be it's three and then it's down to two. Now people
95.84s:  worried that we're not going to get cuts this year. So you get you get all of that and then on top
101.60s:  of that we get what's going on in the Middle East and investors are certainly nervous. What's
108.32s:  interesting is that, you know, the SEP hasn't even backed up 4%. You know, it's been maybe 3.8%
115.84s:  from the all-time highs and that's with all this distress and all, you know, investors very nervous.
124.08s:  As I say, you know, yes, you had a big move from last October, you know, almost 30% in I think 31%
133.36s:  in the NASDAQ and almost 30 in the S&P and 30% in the Russell. You had that run and people got
143.60s:  more bullish obviously. The tape moved up and investors got more bullish. But what I've noticed
149.12s:  is that they're bullish without conviction, which means when you get a roll over like we've had
155.12s:  this last month, you know, first it started out kind of flat. Now it's rolled over this week with
160.80s:  what's going on in Israel. People run through the hills quickly. They turn tail very quickly. So there
168.96s:  they yes, they got more bullish with the tape and that's kind of how it works. But they aren't there
174.72s:  with conviction. So it doesn't take much for them to lose that bullishness and go back the other way.
180.72s:  That's a good thing from a standpoint of my outlook, I think, which is bullish. And because I think
187.44s:  that just builds that wall of worry back up very quickly. So you don't need 10 and 15% corrections.
195.36s:  You get what you would normally get with a 10% correction. You get with something that's less than
200.96s:  half of that. So I think we have, you know, lots of things to worry about out there. But I don't think
207.36s:  any of it's going to interrupt the meltup. Interesting. So I saw a comment literally from Powell's Q&A
216.16s:  in Washington today. Powell had said, this is a quote from him. It says quote, the recent data
224.00s:  have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it is likely to take longer
230.56s:  than expected to achieve that confidence. Obviously, this has to do with inflation. And their
237.36s:  disposition towards how they want to manage inflation. To me, it seemed like the market got a bit
243.52s:  of a head of itself. And you could see that written in even across the bond market, starting to price
249.36s:  in cuts. And then I think the recent bit of data ingestion has shocked that a little bit. What are
255.12s:  your thoughts on that? Yeah, I agree with that. Certainly. The market got way ahead of itself with
261.28s:  expecting six cuts. And then it, as I said, it took her down to three and then two. And now with Powell's
269.36s:  comments, you know, there are people wondering if we're going to get a cut this year. He's not coming
273.68s:  out and saying, we can't have a cut in June. He's not coming out and saying we can't have cuts this
278.24s:  year. But he's basically, and I've claimed this over and over defended him over and over and said,
285.60s:  he's being as transparent as he can be. You know, take him at his word. He's not trying to fool you. He's
291.60s:  not trying to, you know, play games with you like Greenspan used to be do where you had to read
296.16s:  between the lines. What he says is what he, what he thinks at the time. And what he's thinking right
301.84s:  now is what I think the street is thinking, which is, gee, we've had three months in a row where
307.04s:  inflation ticked up. And, you know, we're expecting to tick down. We've got an economy that
314.72s:  continues to show resilience. What's the rush? We don't need to cut right away and then create
321.92s:  a problem for ourselves down the road by being premature in that cut. So, so I think he's basically
330.24s:  echoing what the street already expected or saw. And I think you see that in the markets
335.76s:  because his comments in other times might have been taken bearishly and you might have had the
341.20s:  market down 2%. Instead, the market's up. It sold off on his comments initially, not all that far,
347.76s:  but it did sell off. And now it's turned right around and we're not quite at the highs for the day,
353.84s:  but we're up there. And I personally think we may have seen what we're going to see in a correction.
361.04s:  You know, it could go, you know, it could reverse this week and go a little lower, but I'm not
367.12s:  looking for any big correction here. I think, yeah, as I said, we rebuilt the wall,
371.76s:  worried with not a lot of so off. Now out of curiosity, when I look at markets,
379.68s:  I tend to think that they're pretty smart. There's a lot of people that interact with markets with
383.92s:  a lot of good data. And the fact that we got, again, seemingly pretty far ahead of ourselves,
390.80s:  it surprises me a little bit. Just I'm wondering what's the function from a market perspective
399.20s:  that would lead them to front run the move quite that much? Because when I've been looking at this
405.12s:  from a layperson's perspective, it's been very clear the way Powell, at least, has been synthesizing
410.96s:  the data and I've been kind of not quite mimicking him, but thinking of it in the same way.
415.12s:  Like you see the data released and then you make an assumption, but it seemed like the market had
420.48s:  been front running that data so much and it seemed like they were just like pretty far off.
425.36s:  I don't understand why they would do that. Like what's the built-in incentive for them to do that?
432.16s:  Yeah, it's interesting because I think when you refer to the market, I think you're referring to
437.20s:  the professional investment community basically, right? You're thinking in terms of
441.60s:  the long-term participants for large. And the supposed least smart money.
448.00s:  When I refer to the market, I refer to the market in the aggregate, which includes all
453.12s:  investors, whoever's in there, it's what the market is saying. So not what the smart investor is saying
461.20s:  or the street analyst is saying, it's what the market is saying. And those are two different things
466.88s:  because as you know, the so-called smart money fought this rally all the way up from 3,500,
474.24s:  two years to a year and a half ago. When it was 3,500 on the S&P, it didn't get bullish until we
480.40s:  were up over 4,800 basically. And so they may be smart money, but they got it wrong.
489.52s:  Meanwhile, the market itself, for whatever reason, saw a reason for it to keep going.
497.92s:  And as you know, I basically have echoed the market in terms of, you know,
502.80s:  anticipating what the market is doing in terms of being bullish when most people were bearish
508.24s:  and saying we were going to have a melt-up. So what I think the market is anticipating and seeing,
515.04s:  and what I'm seeing is that ultimately, no matter whether it's this month, next month,
521.52s:  two months ago, four months ahead, we're nearing the end of a tightening cycle. That tightening cycle
528.80s:  has been going on for two years. That's a big deal. And ultimately, in spite of the numbers that
537.20s:  may say, we're going to have no landing or a soft landing or no recession, I think underneath
544.96s:  the surface, there are lots of signs that we are heading for a recession. And as you know, I think
550.48s:  it's going to be a lot more than recession, you know, going robust. But in the meantime, what you
556.16s:  get is you're taking it to because the economy's operating at a pretty low recovery level. It's not
565.04s:  roaring, caught. Inflation has been trending down in the last few months, notwithstanding.
572.80s:  And what you've got is inflation that was 9% now down at three, essentially, depending on the
580.08s:  measure you want to use. And ultimately, in my opinion, and I think the market's been
586.24s:  still trending down, it just isn't going to be a straight line. So I think that's what the market's
591.76s:  picking up. And as you know, I look at what I call cross-market, I look at a lot of things
601.36s:  underneath the surface in terms of individual companies and sectors, et cetera. And they're
607.28s:  saying the same thing, which is we're about to have things that have been out of favor, come into
614.00s:  favor. So copper producers, which have been out of favor for quite some time, are now starting
621.36s:  to look great. They're moving to certainly 12-month highs and beyond. And they look like they've
629.76s:  got 50-75% upside in them. That doesn't happen in a situation that fits what this so-called smart
639.68s:  money thinks we're heading for, which is higher for longer an economy that needs in-treat cuts,
647.60s:  but it isn't going to get them inflation that's trending up, not down. And that's not what the
652.88s:  market's telling us. So I think I learned long ago, I haven't done this for 50 years,
659.92s:  to pay attention on the market when it disagrees with that so-called smart money,
666.16s:  or, you know, the informed professional investor or analyst. You know, they can get it right
674.64s:  sometimes, but they don't always. And I think the market in the aggregate, it's law of large numbers.
680.96s:  The market in the aggregate generally is a better predictor of the future than any individual,
687.44s:  no matter how smart we are. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And actually, I'd like to double-click
692.80s:  on that from a structural standpoint to understand your perspective a little bit better, because
697.76s:  when I think about the market, quote-unquote, I typically think about players that have enough capital
705.04s:  to make a meaningful movement in price. So to your point, I typically would exonerate retail
711.36s:  out of there, because there's very few retail traders that could even put it done to anything.
716.00s:  Now, going back to your point on this idea of smart money versus the market,
721.36s:  how do you differentiate between those two in your world view? Because obviously, if we go from
725.84s:  3550 to 60 in the S&P, there has to be big money that moves that. It doesn't just go up there
733.76s:  from retail traders buying. So who are the people driving that price appreciation in your world?
739.92s:  Yeah, this is not a kind of a either or of either retail or professionals. And it's not,
748.40s:  investors aren't monolithic. So there are very bearish people that are considered some of the
757.52s:  best investors out there. They're very bullish people who might be considered some of the top
762.08s:  investors out there, and there are people in between. So again, I'm not trying to pick and choose
768.40s:  which investors have this right. It's the fact that the market is a discounting mechanism,
774.64s:  and when you put all investors in there together, they're discounting what in the aggregate they see.
782.32s:  And that way, it's not about analyzing what kind of economy are we in, or what it's basically
791.36s:  understanding the market predicts the future. It is, and again, what's tricky about that is sometimes
797.92s:  the market gets it wrong. So you have to kind of decide where you are in that. But generally,
802.80s:  it's the law of large numbers. It's the market in the aggregate, all investors retail,
808.88s:  institutional hedge funds, insurance company, all in there together. When you put it all together,
817.68s:  is a pretty good predictor of the future. As I used to take Paul to ask when he was, and I think
827.12s:  he's still doing some extent, but when he was really, he and his minions on the FOMC were
835.20s:  saying so much time trying to job on the market down and deciding where the market should go.
840.96s:  I go think about what he's doing. He's taking out of his basket of indicators,
847.76s:  the stock market, which in my opinion is the best leading indicator. It is the most
853.12s:  accurate predictor of the future. And by forcing it to where he wants it to go or thinking,
859.68s:  he can force it to go somewhere. He's removed it as an indicator, and he's deciding he knows best
865.52s:  where it should be. I don't know if that's confusing, but to me, the stock market is one of our best,
873.28s:  if not the best leading indicator. Again, it's not full profit. Sometimes gets things very wrong,
879.04s:  but in general, it is a discounting mechanism that tells you what's coming.
885.04s:  So those that are spending time trying to figure out what the economy is doing or what
892.48s:  interest rates are going to do or what have you are probably not going to be as accurate as
897.68s:  that aggregate stock market in terms of what the future is.
901.84s:  I see. So yeah, I actually think then in general, you and I probably have a pretty similar view
907.52s:  on what we would consider the market. Now, when you think the market gets so far ahead of itself,
917.04s:  meaning in terms of discounting and including the prospects for a cut, what do you think drives
922.56s:  that? Is it people just trying to get in at the very precipice of a move to maximize the move?
928.88s:  Do you think that there's other imperatives that drive the behavior? I'm just curious from
932.64s:  a broad perspective, what would get a lot of people to pile into something.
938.08s:  Because when I look at it from my point of view as a trader, I look at it as, and this has been my
943.04s:  entire point of view the whole time, like actually very similar to Powell. Until I see stuff that
949.28s:  makes me think differently about what rates might do, meaning I'm typically looking at the bond
955.68s:  markets, I really look too far beyond that. I'm just kind of seeing what's happening there. And
960.48s:  the bond markets seem for a while to be pricing in like you were talking about quite a few cuts
965.52s:  this year, but then they've paired back. So do you think that they're just using different models,
971.28s:  whatever the case is that kind of project them forward and then we integrate new data,
975.12s:  or do you think there's a bit of mania that's built into this? And the reason I'm asking this question
979.76s:  is to differentiate for your kind of melt up scenario if that's going to be more of a mania driven
987.12s:  event? Yeah, good question. I'll give you my take on the whole rate cutting thing and how we got
997.12s:  there. People have speculated about why did they build in six cuts? There was no reason to build
1003.60s:  in six cuts or how did they get there. And I think, and again, that's really bond investors,
1009.52s:  right? Not the stock market, but the bond investor, the fixed income investor was trying to figure
1015.60s:  what the Fed was going to do. And you know, you look at the futures market that basically
1020.00s:  predicting six cuts for this year. I think they kind of took the ball and ran with it in terms of
1027.44s:  the whole scenario that the economy is weakening and inflation is coming down faster than the Fed
1032.72s:  thought. And that we are going to be in a sweet spot where you'd have very low growth if not
1039.12s:  negative at the same time that you almost were at or even could possibly get below the 2% target
1049.84s:  on inflation. So, you know, when we entered this year, I think that's where the mindset was,
1054.88s:  and that's pretty much bottomed out there. You know, on the bond market was, you know, they
1063.52s:  anticipated, as did I, that the economy was probably going to be weaker going forward this year.
1070.88s:  And that inflation was going to continue to trend towards target if not get there. And frankly,
1077.76s:  that the Fed was behind the curve because short rates were still up at 5%, you know,
1084.48s:  Fed fund rate was over 5%, and that if inflation is down at 2, you've got a pretty hefty real rate
1095.12s:  there, which is restrictive. And if the economy is softening and it's restrictive, you get a problem.
1101.92s:  And it means you've got to cut several times to get down to a level where you're not going to create
1107.04s:  a hard landing. So, that's where I think the mindset was. And they came into this year with that
1113.76s:  mindset. And then, you know, January, February, that kind of question, to question some of that
1121.68s:  mindset and take some of those cuts off the table. And then I think March was just a real surprise
1128.24s:  to them. Well, I, you know, one tenth of percent tick up tick from expectations. But I think they
1135.84s:  were thinking, you know, the whole housing real estate rental part of the CPI is overstating,
1147.44s:  you know, house prices and inflation in the real estate sector. And so we're going to get at some
1154.32s:  point here and we think it could be March, we're going to get that finally factor in. And we're
1159.52s:  going to get a better expected number. Instead, we got to worse the expected number. I just caused a
1164.40s:  really quick readjustment to questioning whether we were going to have, you know, the three cuts
1170.48s:  that they had thought or whether it's going to be two. And now, like I said, just in the last couple
1174.48s:  weeks, the real question becomes, is it going to be one or none? And, you know, I personally don't
1182.40s:  play that game. I'm not worried about my call does not depend on how many cuts the Fed does.
1188.48s:  But it does somewhat depend on what the bond market does. And I'm still, I believe,
1194.96s:  or that what we're looking at here is a consolidation, although it went farther than I expected,
1201.52s:  or I thought it would need to consolidation of that 120 base point drop in the 10 year,
1207.36s:  you know, in the fourth quarter, we went from 5% to 380. Now, we're, you know, we're back up at
1214.48s:  465. And that's, you know, it's, it was close to 470 today. You know, that's a steeper backup
1223.28s:  than I would have expected. But still, I think we're going to prove to be a consolidation of that run.
1230.40s:  And we'll just roll back over. And I still think we're going to head 3%, you know, in coming months.
1235.76s:  So, but that remains to be seen. That's why forecast not reality at this point.
1242.00s:  Now, you brought up something actually that I was taking a look at, which was the,
1246.88s:  the housing market. And I saw that we had some housing starts number, housing start numbers come
1252.00s:  out today. Those were forecasted at 1.485 million. And they came in at 1.321. And then building
1260.40s:  permits, they were forecasted at 1.51. Those came in at 1.458. So both starts and permits
1269.36s:  contract in a little bit. Does that mean anything to you? A little bit. I would say,
1276.32s:  coming into the spring with the interest rate forecast that I had and what the street was
1282.72s:  expecting until this last few weeks, I thought we'd probably have a spring bounce in housing
1290.00s:  that was pretty good. It's not, you know, we wouldn't go back to the highs in either activity
1296.32s:  or prices, but that we'd have a pretty good spring bounce and that that might actually feed
1301.12s:  into a little bit of a worry about, you know, the economy re-accelerating, inflation re-accelerating.
1307.04s:  What we've actually gotten, I think, is that, you know, from a standpoint of those that want
1312.88s:  strong housing, I think this backup in rates in the last few weeks really puts a damper on that
1321.36s:  spring bounce. And so I think the numbers today are showing that that you're still not
1329.12s:  just rolling over and going south, but you're starting to put a crimp in any kind of housing
1335.20s:  bounce. And ultimately, I think we are heading for recession and housing is going to get it hard.
1342.72s:  So, you know, any bounce here was going to be temporary. Anyway, you may still get something as
1348.32s:  you move towards the middle of the year if rates come back down, but I just think we're running
1353.28s:  out of time on housing. I think we picked in housing two years ago, 18 months ago, and I think,
1363.52s:  you know, most of what's ahead is downside, not upside.
1368.72s:  Do you differentiate it all between residential and commercial? Obviously we're saying housing,
1374.32s:  so I would think towards single homes. Yeah.
1378.32s:  Yeah, for sure. Housing is talking specifically about that. The commercial real estate,
1384.96s:  obviously the office buildings made the circuit, I think, a week ago, where there was a building in
1392.48s:  St. Louis that sold for like the big skyscraper. You know, looked fairly modern, and he has
1401.12s:  it sold for like $3 million. A couple of years ago was valued at $40-50 million.
1410.32s:  So we are seeing an adjustment in commercial real estate. There's a lot more of that to come.
1416.56s:  The banks are trying to kick the can down the road where they can, and yet in other places where
1424.00s:  you know, they've got bad debts, they're having to eat it, and you know, rationalize it to the real
1430.32s:  prices, but there's definitely commercials taking on the chin sooner than housing is, but I would
1438.32s:  say housing is coming. You know, that once we get into that global bust, probably next year, mostly,
1446.24s:  that you will see I would be surprised again, every market's local in housing, but I would be
1453.36s:  surprised if cross the board we saw something like on the average, a 30% or more decline in
1460.16s:  home prices from the peak. In some places I've already started that. I think, you know, I left in
1466.80s:  Phoenix and Dallas. I'm not sure about Dallas, but Phoenix, I think, has been in pretty hard.
1472.32s:  Some of those areas, you're already seeing supply back up, but across the board, the country,
1478.32s:  I think that's still ahead of us. I see two questions on that. The first one just didn't add on.
1485.04s:  I saw similar to what you saw in St. Louis. I saw a very similar story in San Francisco, and I
1492.80s:  think it was an apartment building that ended up selling very, very cheap compared to what it
1497.12s:  was very recently. So just another indicator of that, but going back to just housing from
1505.76s:  a broader perspective, part of me looks at it as the in office scenario for workers in general
1514.88s:  has changed a lot. And we still have a lot of office buildings. I don't think that they would all
1521.12s:  go away, but what are your thoughts on the future of office buildings in general? Do you think they're
1528.24s:  going to start getting repurposed into other style buildings? Or do you think that that's going to
1533.68s:  be just a fallen part of the market in the not-so-distant future? It's kind of a niche question,
1539.12s:  but I find that one to be interesting because when I look at different kinds of office building
1545.84s:  inventory, it's not contracting. So there are a lot of people trying to do something with this inventory.
1553.28s:  What I'm unsure of is what's the subsequent impact on how they choose to handle the inventory?
1558.96s:  I think we are seeing already some repurposing. It's tricky, I guess. I'm not in that field, but
1567.44s:  I know that some buildings are easier to remake into housing. Some of the downtown areas where
1575.60s:  New York City or somewhere like that, where there's a real need for housing. It could bring some
1581.20s:  of the prices down for apartments and things. They're trying to do it and it depends on the building,
1590.32s:  I think, as to whether it's easily converted or how expensive it's going to be to convert. You
1595.84s:  see that around the country, I think, to some extent, but it's kind of case-by-case building by
1603.04s:  building what it makes sense. I think the malls are trying to repurpose to some extent because they've
1609.36s:  lost anchors and they've lost retail stores. So something recently, one mall was converting some
1617.12s:  of them all to housing. So they've actually been there all right next door to their housing.
1621.60s:  So I think you will see definitely, it's not just going to die. There'll be new uses. Obviously,
1630.96s:  industrial commercial is up and coming. I mean, as we reshore and things, there are parts of
1639.60s:  the real estate market that will actually be investible and moving up, not down. But it's the commercial
1647.52s:  as you say, where we in the pandemic, so many people learned they could work for home and have
1654.48s:  been reluctant to go back that a lot of that office space in the big cities is excess now. So I know
1663.84s:  there are companies trying to bring their employees back and some have been successful doing it,
1670.40s:  and others not as much. It's a tough one. People really have learned and certainly technology
1679.52s:  supported them in terms of being able to be productive at home and not have to go through two-hour
1684.72s:  commutes. And obviously, we're dealing with in some of these inner cities now, more problems,
1694.72s:  whether it be from the migrants, whether it be from being less willing to keep people in jail.
1707.60s:  Crimes, crimes worse than it's ever been in some of these big cities. So another reason for people
1713.84s:  to work remotely. So I think that again, the trend is there. Some of it will have been flow back
1721.44s:  in the other direction, I think. So it's kind of work in progress. It's interesting to me because
1730.24s:  from a trading standpoint, whenever I see stuff like this, I can't help but look for opportunities.
1736.64s:  And to me, that does seem like a budding opportunity. However, I do invest in commercial real estate
1742.88s:  with some partners and the rate environment right now actually kind of puts a damper on the party.
1750.00s:  Not any of us are overly excited to be the ones to try the fun stuff right now. So it's an
1758.16s:  interesting perspective. Plus, you've got an awful lot of the refinancing
1764.88s:  is in this window over the next year or two, I think. And unless rates cooperate and come down,
1772.00s:  that's going to probably create another wave of problems for real estate. So and for the banks.
1779.20s:  So it's probably early. I'd say the opportunities there might still be a couple of years off.
1786.48s:  You know, you're in a half off. So it's tempting when you see the problem and you see that,
1792.00s:  you know, you see like that say like mentioned. But I have a feeling that, you know,
1797.28s:  stepping in here, you might be catching a falling knife from a while yet.
1803.12s:  Yeah, that's honestly at least from my world, most of us were looking at, but we don't really do
1809.60s:  a apartment or we don't really do office buildings. So it's a little bit of a different market.
1814.72s:  That's one thing I definitely have developed an appreciation for is I've gotten more involved
1819.36s:  in the commercial real estate space is just how bifurc, there's just so many niches within it.
1825.68s:  It's it's almost yeah, that that part is a little more pronounced than I even would have imagined.
1830.96s:  But stepping away from real estate going back to markets, I've noticed a few interesting themes
1837.60s:  specifically relating to the sectors where over the past three months, we're kind of getting a
1845.44s:  a bit of a change in vanguard where if I look over the past six months, I see mostly tech
1851.44s:  leading the pack. So commercial communication services, information technology kind of standard
1856.88s:  fair. But then if I go into a month, I see comm services still up top, but then I'm also seeing
1864.24s:  energy, industrials, utilities, materials, a lot of these sectors starting to bubble up to the top.
1872.72s:  Two questions. One, is that similar to what you're seeing and two, do you think that we're going
1880.64s:  through a bit of a sector rotation, recommitting of capital here? Or do you just think that these are
1885.20s:  some of the things that have been beaten down so far that they're being propped up a little bit,
1890.00s:  but then capital might rotate right back into tech or something like that.
1893.76s:  Yeah, I think it's all all the above. We we really have when you step back and look
1899.76s:  particularly at the S&P, but also the other markets, we really have had you know six or seven
1906.56s:  weeks here of consolidation where it kind of topped out back in, I don't know, early March,
1913.76s:  late February, early March. And we've gone sideways. And again, this week or in the last week
1920.56s:  rolled over some, but basically still in a kind of a high level consolidation. So some of what you
1927.36s:  saw with the market wasn't giving up a lot, but you were rotating. So you did have some of that
1932.56s:  sector rotation. And some of that sector rotation was back into the defensive areas that had not
1939.28s:  been performing in the fourth quarter, into the early part of the first quarter, because they
1947.12s:  were defensive and the market was taking off. So utilities, consumer staples, healthcare, some of
1956.32s:  those areas were, you know, had kind of come down where we're underperforming. And with the
1963.52s:  consolidation, people are running back to some of those safer havens where they're not so dependent on,
1971.36s:  say, you know, the market moving up, or where they saw that they had come down and saw them as value
1977.84s:  again. But at the same time, we've had, as I mentioned, copper producers, but we've had a lot of
1985.12s:  the kind of the industrial side of the economy, the old economy, the value industrial side of the
1993.44s:  economy, starting to pick up. So I noticed it in steel. I noticed it in, you know, the copper companies.
2002.00s:  You could see it in, I mean, XLI, which is industrial ETF, it's sort of roof. I mean, if people haven't
2009.68s:  looked at it, you know, if people bought into that magnificent seven narrative and didn't really
2016.80s:  look at these other things, they, I think they'd be shocked to see where some of these stocks have
2021.36s:  gone. They look like Nvidia. They don't look like stocks that were asleep. I mean, PAKAR, which is
2026.96s:  truck manufacturer and, you know, Eaton, which is involved in trucks, you know, you look at some of
2032.16s:  these heavy industrial companies, Parker Hanuff and then English all ran. Take a look at them.
2039.60s:  They're straight up. They've been great stocks for many months. And I was pushing back on that
2044.88s:  long ago, as you know, where people would say, it's not really a good quality rally. It's all the
2051.04s:  magnificent seven. It's a very narrow. That's not good. I go, look at the housing home builders,
2056.64s:  look at, you know, XLI, look at, you know, there are a lot of groups that have actually participated
2062.40s:  quite well in the last six months. And so, and by the way, in this last, say six or seven weeks,
2071.28s:  what also has happened is that the semiconductor in particular, but tech in general,
2079.20s:  that they started rolling over and consolidating their big gains. So, semis, which is about such a
2085.84s:  great run for the last 18 months led by Nvidia, but certainly microns done well and, you know, all the
2095.04s:  capital equipment companies in semis, you know, the the lab researchers and the AMATs, the KLA,
2101.12s:  A instruments, those stocks have basically been high level consolidations of late.
2109.20s:  And so, I think it looks to me like they're they're about to turn up again. So, we've had a lot of
2119.28s:  what we've had in this last month or six weeks has just been kind of correcting overboughts,
2126.96s:  consolidating the gains and getting position for another run. And I think the next run, and I've
2134.96s:  been consistent about this all along. I think we're going to see the market continue to broaden out.
2140.00s:  So, it's not either or it's not G. Well, tech had their run. Let's go somewhere else. No,
2145.68s:  it's said you can still have a big run in semis from here and from, you know, a lot of tech from here,
2152.64s:  but also be in some of the old, you know, industrial areas like copper producers and aluminum producers
2163.20s:  and steel and, you know, some of those areas, I think, are going to do very well. And then you're
2170.72s:  also seeing which may seem surprising since interest rate have backed up, but financials are starting
2179.04s:  to look, they had come alive and then kind of consolidating recently and they look like they're
2185.52s:  poised to move up again. So, you know, the broker dealers look great to me, particularly, you know,
2193.28s:  I can't name names, but, you know, a popular retail broker that has been out of favor for
2199.76s:  quite some time is starting to look very good on the chart. So, I think there's going to be
2208.08s:  just ahead, not very far ahead here, a broadening of market and, you know,
2214.08s:  resuming of the rally and probably getting steeper as we go.
2218.96s:  So, specifically for the banks, I find that perspective really interesting because
2224.88s:  a lot of what we're seeing across the banks here, at least for the smaller banks, is actually,
2231.12s:  I would consider more weakness. So, what gets you interested in them at these levels?
2237.60s:  Yeah, and I haven't looked out of this week, but I think what you're seeing is higher interest rates,
2242.72s:  obviously, hits them, you know, particularly the regionals with what happened, you know, a year ago.
2250.56s:  So, you got to kind of broaden, I think, and again, I don't have charts in front of me, but I think
2256.56s:  if you broaden your perspective and look at longer charts, you may see it in the context of
2263.52s:  a group that started to come alive and then got hit with the higher rates and is consolidated
2269.68s:  those that run, but hasn't broken down. And I think they will go. I focus more on the broker dealers
2278.80s:  of late, and they just look very good to me. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, because I was just
2285.92s:  curious, I've been trading earnings specifically for the big banks, you know, all S&P 500 banks
2291.44s:  as they're coming out, and they're all obviously having hired in chargeoffs, they're seeing lower
2297.76s:  interest driven returns, but they're able to compensate it in other ways, but we know the
2302.56s:  smaller regional banks don't necessarily have the suite of tools to be able to pull together
2307.36s:  quite as well, but that makes sense when you explain it. I remember I'm pretty biased by my view,
2313.60s:  the rates are going to come down. And you know, when I look at XLF, which is the ETF for the
2319.92s:  financial stocks, not just banks, but it looks very bullish to me. And I think it's again,
2326.32s:  another prediction, another market predicting or being predictive of the fact that I don't think
2332.56s:  rates are headed a lot higher here. You know, we've got to get through this consolidation in the
2337.44s:  rates, but I think once we do, and I think it's soon, I think rates roll back over and head to new
2345.12s:  lows. So 380 on the 10 year was where we got to, like I said, I wouldn't be surprised if we get
2350.08s:  the low threes by this summer. I see. Now, going back to metals, I was actually checking out
2358.08s:  aluminum because aluminum had been hopping a little bit. What are your perspectives on metals
2365.28s:  in general? One of the questions I know everybody has for you typically is gold and silver and kind
2370.40s:  of the the relationship and comparison between those two. But I also would like to get into some
2374.72s:  of the more niche metals like you were talking about copper aluminum specifically top of mind for
2378.88s:  me, but happy to start with gold and silver. Yeah, so, you know, I'll start with the base metals
2385.60s:  first, but I think there was, and I didn't follow closely, but they did something to take out supply
2396.40s:  from Russia, you know, they're full around with this. So I think you saw some of the strength
2403.92s:  this week just simply off of that. But I think ultimately to carry on, you know, for that to have
2411.52s:  legs, I think what we're going to see here is that basically, inventories are in good shape. I know
2418.16s:  I'm copper. They're in really good shape. China may be finally turning the corner a little bit,
2425.84s:  so we could have things, you know, where you get some some contributions from their demand.
2431.60s:  And, you know, I think the base metals look very good. Copper is the one that I tend to favor in
2439.84s:  that group in terms of where it's clearest, but, you know, like I said, the steels look like they
2445.12s:  are ready to run aluminum does and, and you know, the one that's kind of lagged is the iron ore,
2451.36s:  but that'll come along if I'm right about steel. In terms of gold and silver, which is really the
2458.72s:  area to focus on in my opinion, because I've come alive. It's been a long haul waiting for the
2466.16s:  breakout in gold. It finally happened new in the last month that it started to really run. We
2472.24s:  obviously, at the end of last week, going into the weekend with what was going on with the rain,
2480.16s:  and then the, you know, that was all pretty much telegraphed. The metals heated up on Friday,
2488.40s:  had great runs in the morning, and then gave it all up in the afternoon, and came into this week,
2495.12s:  kind of, furthering that weakness. And I think it's turned to corner here. So my guess is we're
2501.92s:  going to see new highs pretty quickly in both gold and silver. Gold already is much closer to that
2508.80s:  point. Silver took a bigger hit as it typically does, but I think it's coming back from that. And I,
2515.84s:  you know, I continue to say I think gold's going to 3000 this year. Silver I think is going to 60,
2523.76s:  and maybe 75 this year. That's a huge run. Very short term, I think silver can get up into the mid-to-high
2531.92s:  30s pretty quickly. Gold probably can get up over 2500 pretty quickly. So I think you got, you know,
2540.24s:  room to run there for sure. The miners which have lagged and everybody's frustrated by
2546.16s:  have come alive. They, you know, they had a run and then, you know, again, kind of with the metals
2552.64s:  Friday, and then early this week have given back some of those gains, but by no means have they
2559.92s:  gone back all the way or even close? And they are poised, I think, for much higher. So, you know,
2566.80s:  I think in many cases you're, you're going to be able to double and triple your money in the miners.
2571.92s:  And small miners probably much more than that. So it's an area that's been a long time coming,
2580.64s:  and I've been able, waiting for this for a while, and it would start and stop. Did that start
2588.32s:  and stop several times? You know, back in 2022, from the spring of 2022 to the fall of 2022
2596.08s:  when the equity market bottom, people should look at what the dollar did in that time. The dollar
2602.32s:  went straight up during that six months when you have to rush it. They did Ukraine and we had
2609.44s:  oil go to 130 dollars. All of that took the dollar straight up and took the miners straight down.
2618.08s:  So, you know, that was the first real kind of interruption. It was prior to that invasion.
2624.64s:  They were poised to break out and get going. And that dollar move just killed it. And since then,
2631.52s:  we've kind of been rebuilding and start to go and then it stopped and, you know, it's been up and down.
2636.80s:  And finally, in the last six months, you know, really the last probably three or four months,
2642.64s:  you've finally got them going. And I think there is so much upside.
2647.76s:  Now, when we think about something like gold running from what 24 or something like that,
2654.40s:  running up to you said three. Yep. What's the catalyst to get us there from here?
2662.40s:  We've already seen a pretty big leg of this move. Do you think that there are now people trying to
2668.00s:  pile in and get caught up? Do you think that people are seeing some sort of fundamental shift
2672.96s:  in the future that will want to rotate them into gold? Yeah. Well, first of all, people mind that we had
2680.48s:  really four tries to triple a triple top and then the fourth try finally broke through.
2685.20s:  So it was between 17, 1800 and 21, 104, you know, a couple of years there where I tried to try it again
2695.28s:  and try it again and it was always turned back. So that breakout is a big deal. When we got above 21,
2702.64s:  100 with some umph and kept going and got up to 24 or 50 or whatever it got to, that was a big deal.
2711.12s:  Once you break above that kind of a top, what we've seen so far is small. I mean, you know, it
2719.60s:  really does argue you've got, you know, easily a 50% run from there. So that's why I think 3000,
2726.48s:  I think my 3000 could be conservative. So that's one piece that just technically has just broken
2733.28s:  out. There's a lot more ahead. I think people are kind of with been so accustomed to it being in a
2739.52s:  trading range that, you know, two, three hundred dollars seems like a lot of gold. But it's not
2745.28s:  once you break out. You know, it's just because it was in that tight range. And, you know, Silver is
2752.56s:  so much farther behind gold. So it has to come through, you know, it's not anywhere near a long-term
2760.08s:  breakout, but it's rising above various resistant levels, resistant levels. And I think you're
2768.72s:  going to see which typically happens in a bull market for the metals that whatever gold does, Silver
2775.36s:  will outperform by quite a bit, you know, in bear markets, Silver upperformed on underperforms
2783.36s:  or gets hit harder on the downside when you're in a bull market, Silver outperforms on the upside.
2790.16s:  So it's just the more volatile metal. But yeah, that's, and then fundamentally, you've got, I think,
2799.36s:  and again, we haven't seen it yet. We've been in this consolidation in the dollar as well as
2804.40s:  interest rates. But I think we're very close to a roll over in the dollar, and I continue to say
2809.52s:  what the dollar finally rolls over in the head south that you're going to see go from 106 now,
2817.36s:  down to 80 this year. And if we get that kind of a move that's hugely helpful to the metals.
2827.04s:  I see. Quick market update. We're coming in on the close here, and I'm just watching SPX, and it is
2835.52s:  just bouncing right back and forth. It's almost that break even. It's up 0.02 percent,
2842.00s:  the less than a point. It is just pinned right now. When you think about your
2850.24s:  meltup and global bust thesis, when we first talked about it two years ago, you had kind of a
2856.56s:  clear roadmap in mind. Then we saw new information come out. Obviously, things shifted.
2864.32s:  Now, when you think about your meltup thesis now, especially with the rate environment,
2871.76s:  looking like it could be a little stickier to me, that would be pretty heavy headwinds for
2877.60s:  some parabolic up move in equities. How does that factor into your forecast there?
2884.16s:  Yeah, like I said, I do a lot across market work, and I just have a hard time squaring that with what
2890.80s:  I see across many sectors and across many stocks. In the tech sector, and I can't name names,
2897.28s:  I would love to, because there's some names there that look outstanding. Just tell me that there's
2904.80s:  big upside ahead, and it's not just semis. It's in other areas. Then in the industrials,
2913.84s:  I've already talked about what copper looks like, what steel looks like. There's a lot of upside
2919.12s:  there. The broker dealers is a big tell for me, because if they're going to go up, that means
2925.84s:  that the stock market's going up right. You're not going to have a big run in stock brokers
2931.28s:  if the market's going south. Those are for me indicators of a market that is
2939.68s:  poised for much higher and soon. I think what I would argue is you've had a, yes,
2948.64s:  the consolidation has been more than I expected, but it's, you had 120 base point drop in rates
2956.72s:  in a few months' time. It's not unusual to have a counter-trans move that has to shake up all those
2964.16s:  people. Then when I step back and look at non-treasuries, the jump bonds market, HYG,
2973.92s:  JNK, it looks poised to reverse here. It's been hit with interest rates going up, but not that
2983.04s:  hard. It's actually held up better than other aspects of the bond market. It looks to me like you
2989.84s:  can reverse here and have a nice run. That speaks to an economy that's not falling out of bed.
2996.64s:  It speaks to interest rates that are probably going to go down, not up. Then when I look at
3002.08s:  the investment rate, it's been hit along with treasuries. By the way, again, I think it looks like
3009.20s:  it's getting oversold now and ready for another move. It's easy to extrapolate a move, and that's
3017.92s:  what most people do is when rates are up, oh, they're going higher. That's not how I forecast. I mean,
3024.88s:  I'm looking at indicators that tell me it's more likely that you've had your consolidation.
3030.56s:  That doesn't mean it's going to turn tomorrow, but I don't think we're heading to new highs on rates.
3035.92s:  Let's put it that way. Is there a discrete catalyst that then precipitates an up move in your
3045.68s:  view from here? Do you think it's more of a slow capitulation and then stair step pattern up is
3050.48s:  just capital flowing in? If I put everything I see together, what I get as a scenario that basically
3058.88s:  says the economy still has enough legs. The industrial area is the non-consumer areas that have
3067.52s:  lagged for a while. They've been dealing with trying to get inventories down and rationalize their
3075.12s:  production to what the band is out there. I think they're starting to show signs that inventories
3080.88s:  are in good shape, but they're beginning to produce again. I think the industrial side of the economy
3088.48s:  looks like it's going to be pretty good into the summer. It's not about to fall out of bed. It's
3095.12s:  actually getting stronger. When I stepped back, the consumer, I heard Bank America today talking about
3105.36s:  and they seem to have the best window on the consumer of any of the banks. They say their consumers
3111.44s:  in great shape. Larry Fink at BlackRock just came out saying that money market funds are at 9 trillion,
3120.96s:  not 6 trillion now. We hadn't heard that before. We've heard 6 trillion. You've got a lot out there.
3128.64s:  Yes, credit card delinquencies are moving up. I think there's a highest they've been in
3135.28s:  since maybe 2011, but quite a waste back. You've got signs out there of things that are
3146.88s:  troublesome for down the road, but they don't impact spending right now. I think if I'm right,
3155.68s:  you're going to be in a sweet spot here where you're going to have an economy that's
3161.68s:  soft landing at worst. This is the narrative, not my prediction, not my forecast. But soft landing at
3167.84s:  worst and maybe no landing will be the narrative combined with interest rates rolling back over,
3177.44s:  dollar rolling over, inflation going back, trending downward again. All those things are again on
3186.56s:  the come that I can't point to a number now that says that's the case, but that's what I see in
3193.76s:  trying to interpret the tea leaves and what the markets are telling me. Then from a standpoint of
3199.44s:  what how it feeds into the market, what I think you're going to see here pretty soon, if I'm right,
3205.12s:  that this corrections run its course and we're about to turn up, I think a lot of those,
3212.64s:  and I said had no conviction. They were bulls, but they had no convictions. As a market turn tail,
3218.80s:  they did too, and they've been calling for 10% now, 15% down. I think that's wasteful thinking. These
3226.16s:  are people who missed the whole move. I had by and large missed the move from 3,500 up to now.
3234.00s:  May have jumped in a little bit here and there, but once we went to new highs,
3240.80s:  became more bullish, but said, I'm not chasing this thing here. It's overbought. It's way,
3245.76s:  you know, it needs to correct. They've been sitting saying, you know, like it's wishful thinking,
3251.20s:  but they're entry point in their mind is 10% down, at least. If they see an S&P that gave
3261.60s:  them less than 4% down and then turned around, I don't think they're going to wait very long. I think,
3267.60s:  once this thing gets back up over 5200, I think you're going to see investors say, we can't
3276.72s:  risk this again. We can't miss this again. We got to jump in. I've talked about this in letters,
3284.16s:  and maybe with you, I think we have the potential for what I would call a buying stampede,
3290.56s:  and I would define that as all this money on the sidelines or money that's in defensive areas,
3297.84s:  becoming more offensive, becoming more, you know, buying those groups I'm talking about,
3303.44s:  and saying, I got to get invested, and all of them try to do it in a fairly short two or three
3309.60s:  month timer rise, and you know, all coming in at the same time, because they all kind of missed
3315.20s:  this thing together, and then waited for a bigger correction that didn't come, and now are
3320.48s:  capitulating and saying, I got to get in. And if they all kind of jump in and you know, fairly
3326.08s:  concentrated period of time, I think you could find the market's pretty liquid meaning.
3333.44s:  On the way down, it was illiquid where everybody wanted to sell, and they weren't in a lot of buyers,
3337.92s:  on the way up, everybody's trying to buy in a lot of sellers, and what gives them is price,
3342.96s:  and that's how I think you can get, you know, an S&P that goes from $5,000 to $7,000 in a matter of months.
3352.16s:  Interesting. Now, if you were to assign a confidence interval on the probability of that thesis
3361.04s:  playing out as you outlined, let's say in the next few months, as you're kind of thinking about,
3365.60s:  how confident are you as of right now with what you know now that it'll play out in that frame?
3371.20s:  Yeah, I never put a number on, but what I have said is this is a high conviction call.
3377.12s:  It's not high conviction that it's going to happen between now and June or between now and July.
3382.64s:  It's high conviction that it's going to happen in a concentrated period, whether that is
3388.32s:  three months, six months, you know, but to go 40 or 50 percent, yes, and the Russell, I'm actually
3395.04s:  where it is now, is more than 60 percent to my target. To have that all happen in less than six months
3402.96s:  is unheard of. So that's my conviction. You know, I can't pretend to know which month
3411.52s:  we tap out, but my conviction is the next several months, and it could very well be that it's
3418.16s:  mostly done by the middle of the year, or it may be that it's not done until September, October,
3423.68s:  I don't know, but my conviction is that we are in for the steepest rally in history,
3431.44s:  or what certainly steepest, broadest rally in history. You know, Nasdaq might have been steeper
3437.12s:  in 2000, in 1999, 2000, but this will become pretty close to that.
3443.92s:  Mark it just closed. It landed down slightly down almost a quarter point, so not good.
3456.24s:  A couple of other questions for you real quick. One of them is one of the parts of your thesis I'm
3461.12s:  always interested to learn a little bit more about is the bust portion. And the things there that
3467.12s:  I'm always fascinated by, and what I try to draw the listeners attention to, I know a lot of people
3473.92s:  they cling onto the numbers that you say because they're big numbers, right? Obviously,
3478.48s:  somebody would latch onto that. But what I try to direct people to is your to use your term,
3485.52s:  the reading the tea leaves. I try to pull out the way that you think about and construct a
3491.52s:  narrative based on your breadth of experience, because guess what? The only way you get 50 years
3497.52s:  in Wall Street is by being in Wall Street for 50 years. You can't accelerate that time frame.
3502.56s:  I spent a lot of time in markets, but I've been them for 16 years, less than half of what you see.
3508.00s:  And so it is really interesting to me to tap into the way that you connect concepts together.
3516.40s:  So leading into the bust, what are the catalysts in your view after we go through this
3523.28s:  melt-up phase, which could take however long it takes, but the thesis being it'll be a condensed
3529.12s:  period when it does start. What then rolls us over into the bust? Because one of the things we talked
3535.60s:  about previously was kind of the global economy. And right now, at least as far as I could tell,
3542.72s:  emerging countries don't look great. Let's be clear. But some of the other just global
3548.48s:  our houses seem to be doing okay here. So I'd like to know if that part of your thesis has
3555.04s:  adjusted at all, but more importantly, what are the primary catalysts once we get to this blow off
3560.48s:  top that rolls us over? Yeah, first in terms of the other countries, what I'd say is I'm not sure
3568.00s:  it's all that different from here and from the standpoint of there's a lot of fragility underneath
3575.20s:  the surface. The countries, I'll just look at Europe as an example, it's been really amazing
3582.56s:  to see that two years ago, they didn't know where their energy was going to come from.
3589.52s:  There was all kinds of horror stories about what that winter was going to look like after
3593.92s:  maybe a lot of the Ukraine was invaded. And they fortunately had enough stockpiled.
3600.16s:  They got through that one and then the story was next winter where they were in that problems.
3605.76s:  The costs involved for them to purchase energy elsewhere on the market when they lost
3612.80s:  the pipeline from Russia, from Ukraine was amazing to me that they were able to
3620.72s:  kind of soldier their way through that and stay above water. They traded water, but they stayed
3629.04s:  above water. Listening to Lecguard today, she contrasted the US and Europe from the standpoint of
3640.56s:  saying, yeah, we're hanging in there, but the difference is the US has a resilient consumer who
3649.84s:  spends, spends, spends, we don't have that. She said our consumption is not showing those trends.
3656.16s:  So I would take issue with those saying that the rest of the world is in pretty good shape. I think
3663.36s:  they're in worse shape than us, but they're kind of doing what we are, which is kind of
3668.72s:  muddling through. And you think that maybe this is the worst of it and they can turn up from here.
3675.04s:  My concern is that's not the case. This is the good side and then we turn down from here.
3681.52s:  And I would say the same thing in Canada. I'm getting this in an October, but I see on Twitter
3688.16s:  and many videos and stuff of lots of people up north saying, I can't afford to live here anymore.
3695.52s:  I don't know where to run to, but Trudeau's made such a mess of this economy. I'm dying up here.
3702.56s:  The story we hear here in the US from a lot of young people saying, I can't afford to live on my
3709.04s:  own. I have to go back home. You see in Canada, times three. So I think Canada is not in great shape.
3718.24s:  Their policies are, I think, doing harm to their consumer too. Australia, I think, is
3725.52s:  some of that. China we know is in trouble. Japan is, I keep calling Japan the wild card.
3732.64s:  I mean, there is something there that you just can't print money out in the night.
3739.60s:  Like they have and not run into a situation and have zero rates.
3745.68s:  And basically own all their bonds, the central bank on their bonds. And not have that go the
3751.60s:  other way at some point really cause what we saw on steroids. You know, in other words, if
3759.20s:  once there are rates break out there and there are that quandary. And besides that, the ends break,
3766.88s:  you know, the young keep going lower. And so I actually, and this is not a prediction,
3775.44s:  but I wonder if we're getting close to some sort of a currency accord, like the plaza accord in 1985,
3786.48s:  where you actually coordinate a devaluation of the dollar versus these other currencies
3793.12s:  triggered by the yen, basically saying, you know, both the euro and the yen are having trouble,
3800.56s:  or struggle to, you know, not go down. And maybe, you know, maybe we need to do this. And
3807.68s:  it certainly wouldn't hurt the US to have dollar weaker. So I would not be surprised if that maybe
3813.68s:  some of what the metals market is sniffing out. But again, I'm not predicting that because it's,
3819.84s:  you know, it may not happen, but I think it's potential out there. So, you know, I do think
3829.12s:  that to get to the bust, it still could be triggered by a financial problem, particularly in Europe,
3837.12s:  but overseas somewhere. But my really, my shorthand for the bust, how we get there, it's, or how I,
3844.88s:  why I call for a bust is that we have this massive leverage, like we've never had before in the overall
3852.48s:  world system, meaning 320 trillion in global debt. And I realize a lot of this sovereign debt,
3858.88s:  that's not going to go belly up. But we got 320 trillion debt. That's, that's a,
3866.48s:  that's leverage that you don't want to have going into a weak economy. And then on top of that,
3872.32s:  you've got quadrillions and nocial value derivatives, which is massive leverage on markets. And it
3878.88s:  just means whenever the shit hits the fan, it's going to, you know, it's going to exacerbate whatever
3886.56s:  happens in a big way. So, you know, we're so far beyond the leverage we had in 2008-09, and that's
3893.52s:  why 2008-09 happened was because of massive leverage. We're so far beyond those levels now,
3900.24s:  that I think the next downturn, when it happens, you know, just go straight them, and particularly
3909.68s:  a financial system. And we've got a combination of all that leverage and the risks combined with
3920.08s:  central banks that are hell-bent not to make the same mistakes. So they're, they're telling us,
3926.00s:  you know, policy telling us, like arts telling us, you know, we don't want to pump up the system again.
3932.08s:  We're not going to do that again. We're not going to do QE times four again. Well, if you have a
3938.48s:  system that's imploding, that's the only thing you have you can do. And if they're going to drag
3944.80s:  their feet, they will ultimately come to the conclusion they don't have a choice. But that time
3951.84s:  spent where they have their mind in the wrong direction that slows down the reaction, the response,
3960.32s:  it's in that window of time when they're, you know, they're kind of fighting the last war,
3967.04s:  when they should be saying, now we don't have a choice, we got print money like crazy. Because it
3971.84s:  just happened in 2020, when they printed five trillion, they meaning the Fed, because that was so
3979.28s:  recent, and because, and because of all the criticism the Fed has received for what's happened to
3985.20s:  2008-09, you know, when pumping, you know, QE to infinity, all that stuff, because that's
3992.96s:  fresh in their minds and they're convinced that they can't do that again. That just causes them to
3999.04s:  miss the window, did not respond quickly. And it's during that vacuum that things can fall apart.
4007.12s:  And then they'll come in. I mean, they will react. It's just, they'll react slowly.
4014.16s:  Yeah, matter of how late and how much damage is done, I was pulling up from S&P global
4019.60s:  the current relative leverage of risk. And it looks like it's 349 times for non-financials
4028.48s:  in the financial sector combined, which is just... That's a mature number I've never seen that,
4033.76s:  but that's, yeah, that's really what is it? It's leverage. Leverage combined with a slow response
4042.40s:  and ultimately a huge policy error in terms of handling. But you put that together and, you know,
4052.08s:  something gives it a hurry. And again, it's not something you can time precisely. How
4059.84s:  I can say is a meltup comes first. And again, global bust is really referring to the financial
4064.96s:  system and the economy, but accompanying that, in my opinion, is an 80% bear market. So,
4072.64s:  you know, they go hand in hand, basically. Yeah. I know that we're a little bit over. So,
4080.48s:  I do appreciate you diving into that last part, though, because I always like
4084.00s:  understanding a little bit more peaked behind the curtain on the bust side of things. Because,
4087.92s:  I mean, let's be honest, people, whether or not it happens to that degree, whether it happens
4093.68s:  in whatever time frame, the theory and the way that you're thinking about the problem set
4098.32s:  is still fascinating. And there's a lot of interesting points you raise out. And again, like,
4103.60s:  as you start seeing stuff like 349 times leverage, that's terrifying. And you think that exactly
4112.64s:  to your point, that is the kind of thing that can get out of hand pretty quickly. The only thing I
4117.68s:  can say is I look at this chart that looks okay is that in June of 2020, it was at 352 times.
4124.32s:  And now we're at 349. Rob, three points. That's pretty good. We're safe now, right?
4132.00s:  Safe? Yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, interestingly, I mean, you saw how fast 2020 happened.
4140.72s:  I mean, in three weeks time, the SB lost 35%. It went from seemingly okay, in three weeks later,
4147.76s:  you were down 35%. It just shows you we live in a world today where the speed is just can be
4156.48s:  pretty amazing. And that's what I think ultimately when it finally hits, it can hit fast, you know.
4168.24s:  But I would also say people need to remember, because this is the hardest part about all of this
4175.04s:  as an investor is the return that can come here, like I said, the Russell called for more than 60%
4185.60s:  to my target. And that's being 40% or close to 40. And that's probably more than that. So the
4194.32s:  returns that we can get here are returns you would get over several years normally that could come
4201.20s:  in three to six months time frame. And I have people that know my whole scenario and are really worried
4208.64s:  about the other side of this. And they're scared to death to be in there. And I go just know
4214.64s:  yourself because, you know, these are returns. Yes, the timeframe is that we could be in a bus
4220.80s:  by the end of this year for all I know. But the timeframe is different than the magnitude of the
4227.20s:  return. The returns are three and four years worth of returns that may come in a very short window.
4234.08s:  And if you are out now, because you're worried about what's coming after that. And then the story
4242.40s:  becomes so compelling at the top as it will be that you jump back in saying, well, I guess he was wrong.
4247.92s:  There's no bust coming. You're getting in right as you're about to get hit, you know. So it's like
4254.40s:  just know yourself, you know, everybody has to decide for themselves how they manage that scenario
4260.24s:  assuming it's even right. But just know how psychology works and know that anticipating the downside
4270.96s:  today for most people is not going to do any good because you're going to get swept into this
4276.80s:  thing before it's over. You know, it's so easy to get caught up because because a story at the top
4283.04s:  will be this is just getting started. You know, this is a cycle. This is a new cycle. Steel just got
4289.04s:  started six months ago and copper just got started. And, you know, these things have a long runway ahead.
4295.52s:  And you're going to sit down and go, well, sure, it looks like it. Look what they've just done.
4300.56s:  And you get back in and then find out, you know, that light at the end of the tunnel is a train coming
4306.72s:  the other way. That part always just kick. I just get such a kick out of how repeatable the mistakes,
4316.64s:  retail investors and traders make. Obviously, I chuckle as you say that because it's the stories,
4321.68s:  oldies time itself. Just it's not even like mistiming one side of the trade. It's the ability to
4326.56s:  miss time both sides almost perfectly. I get such a kick out of the way that most traders think
4331.68s:  about that stuff. So it's a good thing. It's not even just in the stock market. Think about
4340.96s:  people have construction firms. It happens cycle after cycle. You know, they they swear to themselves
4347.52s:  they're not going to get caught with inventory again. You know, they're not going to build on spec or
4351.92s:  they're not going to have land or that. And then what happens, you know, now it's the national
4356.48s:  builders. But what happens is things are so strong and they just they look like it's going to go on
4361.92s:  for a long time. And there they are again, caught in the down, you know, the down turn. So, you know,
4368.64s:  get leverage. Leverage give it leverage take it. But yeah, David, really, really fun to connect
4377.52s:  with you. Thanks for hanging out for a little while. If there's somewhere that you want people to
4381.52s:  reach out to you, where would that be? Sure. I'm Twitter every day. So at Dave Age Contrary in
4391.20s:  I don't know if we have taken care of some of the duplicate account problems. I'm more of the fake
4397.44s:  accounts because I Twitter took it upon themselves to give me a blue chuck mark and they did that to
4403.60s:  a lot of people. I guess that are decent followings. And I don't know if that really eliminates that
4409.44s:  problem or not. But hopefully it does. I haven't seen so much of that lately. Yeah, I'll give the
4415.76s:  right link anyways. I'll throw that in the notes below. Okay. So I'm there and then I have a
4420.32s:  quarterly letter for those that want to subscribe. It's by, you know, by subscription. So there's a
4426.16s:  cost to it. If they want information, they can direct message me on Twitter and I'll give them details.
4433.04s:  Yeah, perfect. Well, David, thank you so much. Absolute blast hanging out. And we will see what
4438.24s:  happens between the next quarter that we connect. I can only imagine it will be smooth sailing.
4443.84s:  Everything will play out exactly as we think and then it will be recap. Great.
4450.64s:  Great. Thank you. David. Enjoy the spring. We'll see you in the summer. Thank you so much.
