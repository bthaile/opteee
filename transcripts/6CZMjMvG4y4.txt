0.00s: What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the outlier podcast where we talk about all things
7.60s: extraordinary. I'm here with David Hunter yet again for another conversation. I was actually looking
13.52s: back at our conversations and I think we started connecting in the spring of 22. So it's been
20.08s: about two years. I wanted to wish you a happy anniversary. It's been great for me. I hope it's
24.56s: been great for you. Yeah, it's been great Eric. Great to know you. So we were literally just talking
30.64s: off air for a couple of seconds just about how interesting things are and I feel like every time
36.40s: we connect, you know, you and I maintain like a quarterly cadence give or take and there's always
43.04s: stuff that pops up. So I honestly would love to just start right there with you as you think about
48.40s: the markets today and as you think about the economy, the world today specifically over the last
52.88s: week or so like what's jumping out at you? Yeah, it's definitely been a period where the markets
59.68s: are nervous and given lots of reasons to be nervous, you know, it started out weeks ago with
65.20s: inflation kind of raising its ugly head and everybody was kind of expecting inflation to be
72.32s: trending further down from here from where it was when it came into this year and instead it
77.60s: went the other way for, you know, less two or three months. Excuse me. And so, you know, you had
83.44s: the bond market back up. You had investors get nervous that the Fed's not going to cut and start
90.24s: out with, well, it's not six cuts. May it be it's three and then it's down to two. Now people
95.84s: worried that we're not going to get cuts this year. So you get you get all of that and then on top
101.60s: of that we get what's going on in the Middle East and investors are certainly nervous. What's
108.32s: interesting is that, you know, the SEP hasn't even backed up 4%. You know, it's been maybe 3.8%
115.84s: from the all-time highs and that's with all this distress and all, you know, investors very nervous.
124.08s: As I say, you know, yes, you had a big move from last October, you know, almost 30% in I think 31%
133.36s: in the NASDAQ and almost 30 in the S&P and 30% in the Russell. You had that run and people got
143.60s: more bullish obviously. The tape moved up and investors got more bullish. But what I've noticed
149.12s: is that they're bullish without conviction, which means when you get a roll over like we've had
155.12s: this last month, you know, first it started out kind of flat. Now it's rolled over this week with
160.80s: what's going on in Israel. People run through the hills quickly. They turn tail very quickly. So there
168.96s: they yes, they got more bullish with the tape and that's kind of how it works. But they aren't there
174.72s: with conviction. So it doesn't take much for them to lose that bullishness and go back the other way.
180.72s: That's a good thing from a standpoint of my outlook, I think, which is bullish. And because I think
187.44s: that just builds that wall of worry back up very quickly. So you don't need 10 and 15% corrections.
195.36s: You get what you would normally get with a 10% correction. You get with something that's less than
200.96s: half of that. So I think we have, you know, lots of things to worry about out there. But I don't think
207.36s: any of it's going to interrupt the meltup. Interesting. So I saw a comment literally from Powell's Q&A
216.16s: in Washington today. Powell had said, this is a quote from him. It says quote, the recent data
224.00s: have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it is likely to take longer
230.56s: than expected to achieve that confidence. Obviously, this has to do with inflation. And their
237.36s: disposition towards how they want to manage inflation. To me, it seemed like the market got a bit
243.52s: of a head of itself. And you could see that written in even across the bond market, starting to price
249.36s: in cuts. And then I think the recent bit of data ingestion has shocked that a little bit. What are
255.12s: your thoughts on that? Yeah, I agree with that. Certainly. The market got way ahead of itself with
261.28s: expecting six cuts. And then it, you know, as I said, it took her down to three and then two. And now
268.32s: with Powell's comments, you know, there are people wondering if we're going to get a cut this year.
272.88s: He's not coming out and saying, we can't have a cut in June. He's not coming out and saying, we can't
277.52s: have cuts this year. But he's basically, and I've claimed this over and over defended him over and
284.56s: said, he's being as transparent as he can be. You know, take him at his word. He's not trying to
290.80s: fool you. He's not trying to, you know, play games with you like Greenspan used to be do where you
295.68s: had to read between the lines. What he says is what he, what he thinks at the time. And what he's
301.20s: thinking right now is what I think the street is thinking, which is, gee, we've had three months in
306.16s: a row where inflation ticked up. And, you know, we were expecting to tick down. You know, we've got an
313.60s: economy that continues to show resilience. What's the rush? We don't need to cut right away and then
321.68s: create a problem for ourselves down the road by being premature in that cut. So, so I think he's
326.88s: basically equalling what the street already expected or saw. And I think you see that in the markets
335.20s: after then because his comments in other times might have been taken bearishly and you might have
341.04s: the market down 2%. Instead, the market's up. It's hold off on his comments initially, not all that far,
347.76s: but it did sell off. And now it's turned right around and we're not quite at the highs for the day,
353.84s: but we're up there. And I personally think we may have seen what we're going to see in a correction.
361.04s: You know, it could go, you know, it could reverse this week and go a little lower, but I'm not looking
367.36s: for any big correction here. I think, yeah, as I said, we rebuilt the wall, worried with not a lot of
372.88s: so off. Now, out of curiosity, when I look at markets, I tend to think that they're pretty smart.
381.68s: There's a lot of people that interact with markets with a lot of good data. And the fact that we got
388.24s: again, seemingly pretty far ahead of ourselves, it surprises me a little bit. Just, I'm wondering,
395.44s: what's the function from a market perspective that would lead them to front run the move quite
402.48s: that much? Because when I've been looking at this from a lay person's perspective, it's been very
408.24s: clear the way Powell, at least, has been synthesizing the data. And I've been kind of not quite mimicking
413.76s: him, but thinking of it in the same way. Like you see the data released and then you make an assumption,
419.28s: but it seemed like the market had been front running that data so much and it seemed like they
423.44s: were just like pretty far off. I don't understand why they would do that. Like what's the built in
429.68s: incentive for them to do that? Yeah, it's interesting because I think when you refer to the market,
434.80s: I think you're referring to the professional investment community basically, right? You're thinking
440.72s: in terms of the market participants with large numbers and the supposed least smart money.
448.00s: When I refer to the market, I refer to the market in the aggregate, which includes all
453.12s: investors, whoever's in there, it's what the market is saying. So not what the smart investor is
460.80s: saying or the street analyst is saying, it's what the market's saying. And those are two different
466.48s: things. Because as you know, the so-called smart money fought this rally all the way up from
473.36s: 3,500 to 2 years, a year and a half ago. When it was 3,500 on the S&P, it didn't get bullish until we
480.48s: were up over 4,800 basically. And so they may be smart money, but they got it wrong.
489.68s: Meanwhile, the market itself, for whatever reason, saw a reason for it to keep going. And as you know,
499.84s: I basically have echoed the market in terms of, in terms of what the market is doing, in terms of
505.44s: being bullish, when most people were bearish and saying we were going to have a melt-up. So
511.12s: what I think the market is anticipating and seeing and what I'm seeing is that ultimately,
519.12s: no matter whether it's this month, next month, two months ago, four months ahead, we're
524.72s: nearing the end of a tightening cycle. That tightening cycle has been going on for two years.
531.68s: That's a big deal. And ultimately, in spite of the numbers that may say, we're going to have no
539.52s: landing or a soft landing or no recession, I think underneath the surface, there are lots of signs
546.96s: that we are heading for a recession. And as you know, I think it's going to be a lot more than
551.52s: recession, you know, going robust. But in the meantime, what you get is you're taking it to,
557.84s: because the economy's operating at a pretty low recovery level. It's not roaring
565.60s: cut. Inflation has been trending down in the last few months, notwithstanding. And
574.32s: what you've got is inflation that was 9% now down at three, essentially, depending on the measure
580.40s: you want to use. And ultimately, in my opinion, and I think in the market spending, still
586.64s: turning down, it just isn't going to be a straight line. So I think that's what the market's picking up.
593.52s: And, you know, as you know, I look at what I call cross market, I look at a lot of things underneath
601.84s: the surface in terms of individual companies and sectors, et cetera. And they're saying the same
608.16s: thing, which is we're about to have things that have been out of favor, come into favor. So
616.00s: producers, which have been out of favor for quite some time, are now starting. The charts look great.
622.88s: You know, they're moving to certainly 12 month highs and beyond. And they look like they've got,
630.72s: you know, 50, 75% upside in them. That doesn't happen in a situation that fits what this so-called
639.28s: smart money thinks we're heading for, which is, you know, higher for longer an economy that
646.48s: needs interest rate cuts, but isn't going to get them inflation that's trending up, not down.
652.32s: That's not what the market's telling us. So I think I learned long ago, I haven't done this for 50 years,
660.00s: to pay attention on the market when it disagrees with that so-called smart money. And,
666.32s: or, you know, the informed professional investor or analyst, you know, they can get it right
674.64s: sometimes, but they don't always. And I think the market in the aggregate, it's law of large numbers.
680.96s: The market in the aggregate generally is a better predictor of the future than any individual,
687.44s: no matter how smart we are. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And actually, I'd like to double-click on
693.20s: that from a structural standpoint to understand your perspective a little bit better, because
697.84s: when I think about the market, quote-unquote, I typically think about players that have enough capital
705.04s: to make a meaningful movement in price. So to your point, I typically would exonerate retail
711.36s: out of there, because there's very few retail traders that could even put it done to anything.
715.76s: Now, going back to your point on this idea of smart money versus the market,
721.36s: how do you differentiate between those two in your world view? Because obviously, if we go from
725.84s: 3550 to 60 in the S&P, there has to be big money that moves that. It doesn't just go up there
733.76s: from like retail traders buying. So who are the people driving that price appreciation in your world?
739.92s: Yeah, this is not a kind of a either or of either retail or professionals. And it's not,
748.40s: investors aren't monolithic. So there are very bearish people that are considered some of the
757.52s: best investors out there. They're very bullish people who might be considered some of the top
762.08s: investors out there, and there are people in between. So again, I'm not trying to pick and choose
768.40s: which investors have this right. It's the fact that the market is a discounting mechanism,
774.64s: and when you put all investors in there together, they're discounting what in the aggregate they see.
782.32s: And that way, it's not about analyzing what kind of economy are we in, or what it's basically
791.36s: understanding the market predicts the future. It is, and again, what's tricky about that is sometimes
797.92s: the market gets it wrong. So you have to kind of decide where you are in that. But generally,
802.80s: it's the law of large numbers. It's the market in the aggregate, all investors retail,
808.88s: institutional hedge funds, insurance company, all in there together. When you put it all together,
817.68s: is a pretty good predictor of the future. As I used to take Paul to ask when he was, and I think
827.12s: he's still doing some extent, but when he was really, he and his minions on the FOMC were
835.20s: saying so much time trying to job on the market down and deciding where the market should go.
840.96s: I go think about what he's doing. He's taking out of his basket of indicators,
847.76s: the stock market, which in my opinion is the best leading indicator. It is the most
853.12s: accurate predictor of the future. And by forcing it to where he wants it to go or thinking,
859.68s: he can force it to go somewhere. He's removed it as an indicator, and he's deciding he knows best
865.52s: where it should be. I don't know if that's confusing, but to me, the stock market is one of our best,
873.28s: if not the best leading indicator. Again, it's not full profit. Sometimes gets things very wrong,
879.04s: but in general, it is a discounting mechanism that tells you what's coming.
885.04s: So those that are spending time trying to figure out what the economy is doing or what
892.48s: interest rates are going to do or what have you are probably not going to be as accurate as
897.68s: that aggregate stock market in terms of what the future is.
901.84s: I see. So yeah, I actually think then in general, you and I probably have a pretty similar view
907.52s: on what we would consider the market. Now, when you think the market gets so far ahead of itself,
917.04s: meaning in terms of discounting and including the prospects for a cut, what do you think drives
922.56s: that? Is it people just trying to get in at the very precipice of a move to maximize the move?
928.88s: Do you think that there's other imperatives that drive the behavior? I'm just curious from
932.64s: a broad perspective, what would get a lot of people to pile into something.
938.08s: Because when I look at it from my point of view as a trader, I look at it as, and this has been my
943.04s: entire point of view the whole time, like actually very similar to Powell. Until I see stuff that
949.28s: makes me think differently about what rates might do, meaning I'm typically looking at the bond
955.68s: markets, I really look too far beyond that. I'm just kind of seeing what's happening there. And
960.48s: the bond markets seem for a while to be pricing in like you were talking about quite a few cuts
965.52s: this year, but then they've paired back. So do you think that they're just using different models,
971.28s: whatever the case is that kind of project them forward and then we integrate new data,
975.12s: or do you think there's a bit of mania that's built into this? And the reason I'm asking this question
979.76s: is to differentiate for your kind of melt up scenario if that's going to be more of a mania driven
987.12s: event? Yeah, good question. I'll give you my take on the whole rate cutting thing and how we got there.
998.40s: People have speculated about why did they build in six cuts? There was no reason to build in six
1004.00s: cuts or how did they get there. And I think, and again, that's really bond investors, right? Not
1009.92s: the stock market, but the bond investor, the fixed income investor was trying to figure out
1015.60s: what the Fed was going to do. And you know, you look at the futures market that basically
1020.00s: predicting six cuts for this year. I think they kind of took the ball and ran with it in terms of
1027.44s: the whole scenario that the economy is weakening and inflation is coming down faster than the Fed
1032.72s: thought. And that we are going to be in a sweet spot where you'd have very low growth if not negative
1040.40s: at the same time that you almost were at or even could possibly get below the 2% target on inflation.
1051.04s: So, you know, when we entered this year, I think that's where the mindset was and that's
1055.52s: great pretty much bottomed out there. You know, on the bond market was, you know, they anticipate
1064.72s: as did I, that the economy was probably going to be weaker going forward this year. And that
1071.28s: inflation was going to continue to trend towards target if not get there. And frankly, that the
1078.08s: Fed was behind the curve because short rates were still up at 5%. You know, Fed fund rate was over 5%
1087.20s: and that if inflation is down at 2, you've got a pretty hefty real rate there, which is restrictive.
1097.52s: And if the economy is softening and it's restrictive, you've got a problem. And it means you've
1102.56s: got to cut several times to get down to a level where you're not going to create a hard landing.
1109.04s: So, that's where I think the mindset was and they came into this year with that mindset.
1114.96s: And then, you know, January, February, data kind of,
1120.16s: caused them to question some of that mindset and take some of those cuts off the table.
1124.72s: And then I think March was just a real surprise to them. Well, I, you know, 1-10th percent tick up,
1132.72s: you know, uptick from expectations. But I think they were thinking, you know, the whole housing
1140.48s: real estate rental part of the CPI is overstating, you know, house prices and then inflation in the
1151.12s: real estate sector. And so we're going to get at some point here and we think it could be March.
1156.00s: We're going to get that finally factor in and we're going to get a better expected number.
1161.68s: Instead, we got to worse the expected number and just caused a really quick readjustment to
1167.12s: questioning whether we were going to have, you know, the three cuts that they had thought or
1171.52s: whether it's going to be two. And now, like I said, just in the last couple weeks,
1175.36s: the real question becomes, is it going to be one or none? And, you know, I personally don't play
1182.64s: that game. I'm not worried about my call does not depend on how many cuts the Fed does.
1188.48s: But it does somewhat depend on what the bond market does. And I'm still a believer that what
1195.84s: we're looking at here is a consolidation, although it went farther than I expected or thought it
1202.16s: would need to. Consolidation of that 120 base point drop in the 10 year, you know, in the fourth quarter,
1209.28s: we went from 5% to 380. Now we're, you know, we're back up at 465. And that's, you know,
1217.36s: it's, and was close to 470 today. You know, that's a steeper backup than I would have expected. But it's still
1226.00s: I think going to prove to be a consolidation of that run. And we'll just roll back over. And I
1232.16s: still think we're going to head 3%, you know, in coming months. So, but that remains to be seen.
1238.72s: That's why forecast not reality at this point. Now, you brought up something actually that I was
1244.72s: taking a look at, which was the, the housing market. And I saw that we had some housing
1249.76s: starts number housing start numbers come out today. Those were forecasted at 1.485 million.
1256.80s: And they came in at 1.321. And then building permits, they were forecasted at 1.51. Those came
1264.32s: in at 1.458. So both starts and permits contracted a little bit. Does that mean anything to you?
1272.96s: A little bit. I would say coming into the spring with the interest rate forecast that I had and
1281.60s: with what the street was expecting until this last few weeks. I thought we'd probably have a
1288.56s: spring bounce and housing that was pretty good. Not, you know, we wouldn't go back to the highs
1295.12s: in either activity or prices, but that we'd have a pretty good spring bounce and that that might
1300.40s: actually feed into a little bit of a worry about, you know, the economy re-accelerating, inflation,
1305.76s: re-accelerating. Well, we've actually gotten, I think, is the, you know, from a standpoint of those
1312.24s: that want strong housing. I think this backup in rates in the last few weeks really puts a
1320.56s: damper on that spring bounce. And so I think the numbers today are showing that that you're,
1326.88s: you're still not just rolling over and going south, but you're starting to, you know,
1333.36s: put a crimp in any kind of housing bounce. And ultimately, I think we are heading for recession
1341.20s: and housing is going to get it hard. So, you know, any bounce here was going to be temporary.
1345.52s: Anyway, you may still get something as you move towards the middle of the year if rates come back
1350.88s: down, but I just think we're running out of time on housing. I think we picked in housing two
1357.04s: years ago, or 18 months ago. And I think, you know, most of what's ahead is downside, not upside.
1368.72s: Do you differentiate at all between residential and commercial? Obviously we're saying housing,
1374.32s: so I would think towards, you know, single homes. Yeah. Yeah.
1378.32s: Yeah, for sure. Housing is, you know, talking specifically about that. The commercial real estate,
1384.96s: obviously the office buildings, you know, made the circuit, I think a week ago, where there was a
1391.84s: building in St. Louis that, you know, sold for like, you know, the big skyscraper, you know,
1399.04s: look fairly modern. And he has it sold for like, three million dollars. And, you know, a couple of
1404.64s: years ago was valued at, you know, 40, 50 million dollars. So, we are seeing an adjustment in commercial
1412.48s: real estate. There's a lot more of that to come. The banks are, you know, trying to kick the can
1419.76s: down the road where they can. And yet in other places where, you know, they've got bad debts
1425.28s: or having to eat it and, you know, rationalize it to the real prices. But, but there's, you know,
1432.88s: definitely commercials taking on the chin sooner than housing is. But I would say housing is coming,
1439.92s: you know, that once we get into that global bust, probably next year, mostly, that you will see,
1447.68s: I would be surprised again, every market's local in housing, but I would be surprised if
1454.00s: cross the board we saw something like on the average, a 30% or more decline in home prices from
1461.04s: the peak. And some places have already started that. I think, you know, I left in Phoenix and Dallas.
1468.16s: I'm not sure about Dallas, but Phoenix, I think has been in pretty hard. Some of those areas,
1473.92s: you're already seeing supply back up. But across the board, the country, I think that's still ahead of us.
1480.88s: I see two questions on that. The first one just didn't add on. I saw similar to what you saw in
1486.80s: St. Louis. I saw a very similar story in San Francisco. And I think it was an apartment building that
1494.00s: ended up selling very, very cheap compared to where it was very recently. So just another indicator of
1500.64s: that, but going back to just housing from a broader perspective, part of me looks at it as
1511.76s: the in office scenario for workers in general has changed a lot. And we still have a lot of office
1519.60s: buildings. I don't think that they would all go away. But what are your thoughts on the future of
1525.60s: office buildings in general? Do you think they're going to start getting repurposed into other
1530.40s: style buildings? Or do you think that that's going to be just a fallen part of the market in the
1535.68s: not so distant future? It's kind of a niche question. But I find that one to be interesting because when
1541.60s: I look at different kinds of office building inventory, it's not contracting. So there are a lot
1550.48s: of people trying to do something with this inventory. What I'm unsure of is what's the subsequent
1555.76s: impact on how they choose to handle the inventory? I think we are seeing already some repurposing.
1563.68s: It's tricky, I guess. I'm not in that field. But I know that some buildings are easier to
1571.28s: remake into housing. Some of the downtown areas where New York City or somewhere like that,
1577.36s: where there's a real need for housing. It could bring some of the prices down for apartments and
1584.80s: things. They're trying to do it and it depends on the building, I think, as to whether it's easily
1592.08s: converted or how expensive it's going to be. You see that around the country, I think, to some extent.
1599.28s: But it's kind of case-by-case building by building what makes sense. I think the malls are trying to
1606.24s: repurpose to some extent because they've lost anchors and they've lost retail stores. So I saw
1613.20s: something recently where one mall was converting some of the mall to housing. So they've
1619.20s: actually been there right next door to their housing. So I think you will see definitely see
1626.24s: it's not just going to die. There'll be new uses. Obviously industrial commercial is up and coming.
1634.24s: I mean, as we reassure and things, there are parts of the real estate market that will actually be
1642.16s: investible and moving up, not down. But it's the commercial, as you say, where we in the pandemic,
1651.04s: so many people learning could work for home and have been reluctant to go back that a lot of
1658.00s: that office space in the big cities is excess now. So I know there are companies trying to
1667.12s: bring their employees back and some have been successful doing it and others not as much.
1673.28s: It's a tough one. People really have learned and certainly technology supported them in terms of
1681.04s: being able to be productive at home and not have to go through two-hour commutes.
1687.52s: Obviously, we're dealing with, in some of these inner cities, now more problems,
1693.76s: whether it be from the migrants, whether it be from, you know, our being less willing to
1705.36s: keep people in jail. Crimes, crimes worse than it's ever been in some of these big cities. So
1711.68s: you know, another reason for people to work remotely. So I think that again, the trend is there.
1719.76s: Some of it will have been flow back in the other direction, I think. So it's kind of work in progress.
1728.48s: It's interesting to me because from a trading standpoint, whenever I see stuff like this,
1734.48s: I can't help but look for opportunities. And to me, that does seem like a budding opportunity.
1739.52s: However, I do invest in commercial real estate with some partners and the right environment right
1746.88s: now actually kind of puts a damper on the party. Not any of us are overly excited to be the ones
1753.92s: to try the fun stuff right now. So it's an interesting perspective.
1760.08s: Plus, plus you've got an awful lot of refinancing is in this window over the next year or two, I think.
1768.40s: And unless rates cooperate and come down, that's going to probably create another wave of
1775.60s: problems for real estate. So and for the banks. So it's probably early. I'd say the opportunities there
1783.84s: might still be a couple of years off. You know, you're in a half off. So it's tempting when you see
1790.32s: the problem and you see that, you know, you see like that say, like mentioned. But I have a feeling
1796.24s: that, you know, stepping in here, you might be catching a falling knife for a while yet.
1802.16s: Yeah, that's honestly at least from my world, what most of us were looking at. But we don't really do
1809.36s: apartment or we don't really do office buildings. So it's a little bit of a different market. That's
1814.88s: one thing I definitely have developed an appreciation for is I've gotten more involved in the
1819.60s: commercial real estate space is just how bifurc, there's just so many niches within it. It's it's
1826.24s: almost yeah, that that part is a little more pronounced than I even would have imagined. But
1831.76s: stepping away from real estate going back to markets, I've noticed a few interesting themes
1837.60s: specifically relating to the sectors where over the past three months, we're kind of getting a
1845.44s: bit of a change in vanguard where if I look over the past six months, I see mostly tech leading
1851.68s: the pack. So commercial communication services, information technology kind of standard fare.
1857.60s: But then if I go into a month, I see comm services still up top, but then I'm also seeing energy,
1865.04s: industrials, utilities, materials, a lot of these sectors starting to bubble up to the top.
1872.64s: Two questions. One, is that similar to what you're seeing and two, do you think that we're going
1880.64s: through a bit of a sector rotation recommitting of capital here? Or do you just think that these are
1885.20s: some of the things that have been beaten down so far that they're being propped up a little bit,
1890.00s: but then capital might rotate right back into tech or something like that.
1893.76s: Yeah, I think it's all all the above. We we really have when you step back and look
1899.76s: particularly at the S&P, but also the other markets, we really have had you know six or seven
1906.56s: weeks here of consolidation where it kind of topped out back in, I don't know, early March,
1913.76s: late February, early March. And we've gone sideways. And again, this week or in the last week
1920.56s: rolled over some, but basically still in a kind of a high level consolidation. So some of what you
1927.36s: saw with the market wasn't giving up a lot, but you were rotating. So you did have some of that
1932.56s: sector rotation. And some of that sector rotation was back into the defensive areas that had not
1939.28s: been performing in the fourth quarter, into the early part of the first quarter, because they
1947.12s: were defensive and the market was taking off. So utilities, consumer staples, healthcare, some of
1956.32s: those areas were, you know, had kind of come down where we're underperforming. And with the
1963.52s: consolidation, people are running back to some of those safer havens where they're not so dependent on,
1971.36s: say, you know, the market moving up, or where they saw that they had come down and saw them as value
1977.84s: again. But at the same time, we've had, as I mentioned, copper producers, but we've had a lot of
1985.04s: the kind of the industrial side of the economy, the old economy, the value industrial side of the
1993.44s: economy, starting to pick up. So I noticed it in steel. I noticed it in, you know, the copper
2000.32s: companies. You could see it in, I mean, XLI, which is industrial ETF, it's sort of roof. I mean,
2008.80s: if people haven't looked at it, if people bought into that, magnets at seven, narrative,
2015.92s: and didn't really look at these other things, they, I think they'd be shocked to see where some
2020.64s: of these stocks have gone. They look like Nvidia. They don't look like stocks that were asleep. I mean,
2025.92s: PACR, which is truck manufacturer and, you know, Eaton, which is involved in trucks, you know,
2031.44s: look at some of these heavy industrial companies, Parker Hanuff and then English All-Ran,
2038.56s: take a look at them. They're straight up. They've been great stocks for many months. I was
2044.00s: pushing back on that long ago, as you know, where people would say, it's not really a good quality
2050.16s: rally. It's all the magnets at seven. It's a very narrow. That's not good. I go, look at the housing
2056.00s: home builders. Look at, you know, XLI, look at, you know, there are a lot of groups that have actually
2061.68s: participate quite well in the last six months. And so, and by the way, in this last, say, six or seven
2069.84s: weeks, what also has happened is that the semiconductor in particular, but tech in general,
2079.20s: that they started rolling over and consolidating their big gains. So, semis, which is about such
2085.68s: a great run for the last 18 months led by Nvidia, but certainly, microns done well and, you know,
2093.52s: all the capital equipment companies in semis, you know, the lamb researchers and the AMATs,
2101.28s: instruments, those stocks have basically been high level consolidations of late.
2109.20s: And so, I think it looks to me like they're about to turn up again. So, we've had a lot of what we've
2119.68s: had in this last month or six weeks has just been kind of correcting overboughts, consolidating the
2128.16s: gains and getting positioned for another run. And I think the next run, and I've been consistent
2135.68s: about this all along. I think we're going to see the market continue to broaden out. So,
2140.64s: it's not either or it's not G. Well, tech had their run. Let's go somewhere else. No, it's
2145.92s: said you can still have a big run in semis from here and from, you know, a lot of tech from here,
2152.64s: but also be in some of the old, you know, industrial areas like copper producers and aluminum
2162.40s: producers and steel and, you know, some of those areas, I think, are going to do very well.
2169.76s: And then you're also seeing which may seem surprising since interest rate have backed up,
2177.52s: but financials are starting to look, and they had come alive and then kind of consolidated
2183.68s: recently and they look like they're poised to move up again. So, you know, the broker dealers
2189.60s: look great to me, particularly, you know, I can't name names, but, you know, a popular retail broker
2197.68s: that has been out of favor for quite some time is starting to look very good on the chart. So,
2205.68s: I think there's going to be just ahead, not very far ahead here, a broadening of market,
2212.80s: you know, resuming at a rally and probably getting steeper as we go.
2216.96s: So, specifically for the banks, I find that perspective really interesting because
2224.88s: a lot of what we're seeing across the banks here, at least for the smaller banks,
2230.08s: is actually, I would consider more weakness. So, what gets you interested in them at these levels?
2237.60s: Yeah, and I haven't looked out of this week, but I think what you're seeing is higher interest rates
2242.72s: obviously hits them, you know, particularly the regionals with what happened, you know, a year ago.
2250.56s: So, you got a kind of run, I think, and again, I don't have charts in front of me, but I think if
2256.64s: you've run your perspective and look at longer charts, you may see it in the context of a group that
2264.08s: started to come alive and then got hit with the higher rates and is consolidated those that run,
2271.20s: but hasn't broken down and I think they will go. I focus more on the broker dealers of late,
2279.28s: they just look very good to me.
2284.16s: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, because I was just curious, I've been trading earnings,
2288.32s: specifically for the big banks, you know, all S&P 500 banks as they're coming out and they're all
2292.48s: obviously having hired chargeoffs, they're seeing lower interest driven returns, but they're
2299.84s: able to compensate it in other ways, but we know the smaller regional banks don't necessarily have
2304.24s: the suite of tools to be able to pull together quite as well, but that makes sense when you explain it.
2311.12s: I remember I'm pretty biased by my view that rates are going to come down and, you know, when I look
2317.20s: at XLF, which is the ETF for the financial stocks, not just banks, but it looks very bullish to me,
2325.04s: and I think it's again another prediction that another market predicting or being predictive of
2331.44s: the fact that I don't think rates are headed a lot higher here. You know, we've got to get through
2336.16s: this consolidation in the rates, but I think once we do, and I think it's soon, I think rates roll back
2342.96s: over and head to new lows. So 380 on the 10 year was where we got to, like I said, I wouldn't be
2349.52s: surprised if we get to low 3's by this summer. I see. Now, going back to metals, I was actually checking
2357.84s: out aluminum because aluminum had been hopping a little bit. What are your perspectives on metals in
2365.44s: general? One of the questions I know everybody has for you typically is gold and silver and kind of
2370.48s: the the relationship and comparison between those two, but I also would like to get into some of the
2375.20s: niche metals like you were talking about copper aluminum specifically, top of mind for me, but
2379.20s: happy to start with gold and silver. Yeah, so, you know, I'll start with the base metals first,
2385.92s: but I think there was, and I didn't follow closely, but they did something to take out supply from
2396.72s: Russia, you know, they're full around with the sanctions. So I think you saw some of the
2403.52s: strength this week just simply off of that, but I think ultimately to carry on, you know,
2410.64s: for that to have legs, I think what we're going to see here is that basically
2416.48s: inventories are in good shape. I know I'm copper, they're in really good shape. China may be
2422.80s: finally turning the corner a little bit, so we could have things, you know, where you get some
2429.12s: some contributions from their demand. And, you know, I think the base metals look very good.
2437.52s: Copper is the one that I tend to favor in that group in terms of where it's clearest, but,
2443.20s: you know, like I said, the steels look like they're ready to run, aluminum does, and
2448.24s: and you know, the one that's kind of lagged is the iron ore, but that'll come along if I'm right about
2453.28s: steel. In terms of gold and silver, which is really the area to focus on in my opinion,
2461.84s: because I've come alive, it's been a long haul waiting for the breakout and gold. It finally
2467.76s: happened new in the last month that it started to really run. We obviously, at the end of last
2475.76s: week, going into the weekend with what was going on with the rain, and the, you know, that was all
2482.16s: pretty much telegraphed. The metals heated up on Friday, had great runs in the morning, and then
2490.40s: gave it all up in the afternoon, and came into this week kind of furthering that weakness.
2498.48s: And I think it's turned to corner here, so my guess is we're going to see new highs pretty quickly
2504.48s: in both gold and silver. Gold already is, you know, much closer to that point. Silver took a bigger
2511.28s: hit as it typically does, but I think it's coming back from that night. I, you know, I continue to say,
2518.40s: I think gold's going to 3,000 this year. Silver, I think, is going to 60, and maybe 75 this year.
2526.48s: That's a huge run. Very short term, I think silver can get up into the mid-times,
2531.76s: 30s pretty quickly. Gold probably can get up over 2,500 pretty quickly, so, so I think you got,
2539.28s: you know, room to run there for sure. The miners which have lagged and everybody's frustrated by
2546.16s: have come alive. They, you know, they had a run and then, you know, again, kind of with the metals
2552.64s: Friday, and then early this week have given back some of those gains, but by no means have they
2559.92s: gone back all the way or even close, and they are poised, I think, for much higher. So, you know,
2566.80s: I think in many cases you're, you're going to be able to double and triple your money in the miners,
2571.92s: and small miners probably much more than that. So, it's an area that's been a long time coming,
2580.64s: and I've been able to wait for this for a while, and it would start and stop. That's starting
2588.40s: and stop several times, you know, back in 2022, from the spring of 2022 to the fall of 2022
2596.08s: when the equity market bottom, people should look at what the dollar did in that time. The dollar
2602.32s: went straight up during that six months when you have to rush it, invaded Ukraine, and we had
2609.52s: oil go to 130, all of that took the dollar straight up and took the miners straight down. So,
2619.12s: you know, that was the first real kind of interruption. It was prior to that invasion.
2624.64s: They were poised to break out and get going, and that dollar move just killed it. And since then,
2631.52s: we've kind of been rebuilding and start to go and then it stopped, you know, it's been up and down,
2636.80s: and finally, in the last six months, you know, really the last probably three or four months,
2642.64s: you've finally got them going, and I think there is so much upside.
2647.76s: Now, when we think about something like gold running from what, 24 or something like that,
2654.48s: running up to, you said three. Yep. What's the catalyst to get us there from here? We've already
2663.04s: seen a pretty big leg of this move. Do you think that there are now people trying to pile in and get
2669.36s: caught up? Do you think that people are seeing some sort of fundamental shift in the future that
2674.16s: will want to rotate them into gold? Yeah, well, first of all, keep in mind that we had really four
2681.04s: tries, triple, a triple top, and then the fourth try it finally broke through. So, it was between
2687.84s: 17, 18, 1800 and 21, 104, you know, a couple of years there where I tried and tried again and tried
2695.76s: again and was always turned back. So that breakout is a big deal. When we got above 21, 100 with some
2703.68s: umph and kept going and got up to 24, 50 or whatever it got to, that was a big deal. Once you break
2711.92s: above that kind of a top, what we've seen so far is small. I mean, it really does argue,
2720.72s: you've got, you know, easily a 50% run from there. So that's why I think 3000, I think my 3000
2727.60s: could be conservative. So that's one piece that just technically has just broken out. There's a lot
2734.24s: more ahead. I think people are kind of, we've been so accustomed to it being in a trading range
2740.88s: that, you know, $2,300 seems like a lot in gold, but it's not once you break out, you know, it's
2746.72s: just because it was in that tight range. And, you know, Silver is so much farther behind gold.
2755.76s: So it has to come through, you know, it's not anywhere near a long-term breakout, but it's rising
2762.64s: above various resistant levels, resistant levels. And I think you're going to see which typically
2770.08s: happens in a bull market for the metals that whatever gold does, Silver will outperform by quite a
2776.64s: bit, you know, in bear markets, Silver upperformed on underperforms or gets hit harder on the downside
2786.96s: when you're in a bull market, Silver outperforms on the upside. So, it's just a more volatile metal.
2793.60s: But yeah, that's, and then fundamentally, you've got, I think, and again, we haven't seen it yet.
2801.36s: We've been in this consolidation in the dollar as well as interest rates, but I think we're very
2806.80s: close to a roll over in the dollar, and I continue to say what the dollar finally rolls over in
2812.64s: the head south that you're going to see go from 106 now down to 80 this year. And if we get that
2822.24s: kind of a move that's hugely helpful to the metals. I see. Quick market update, we're coming in on
2830.88s: the close here, and I'm just watching SPX, and it is just bouncing right back and forth. It's almost
2837.84s: that break even. It's up 0.02 percent. The less than a point, it is just pinned right now.
2846.88s: When you think about your melt-up in global bust thesis, when we first talked about it two years
2854.48s: ago, you had kind of a clear roadmap in mind. Then we saw new information come out. Obviously,
2862.56s: things shifted. Now, when you think about your melt-up thesis now, especially with the rate
2870.96s: environment looking like it could be a little stickier, to me, that would be pretty heavy headwinds
2877.12s: for some parabolic up move in equities. How does that factor into your forecast there?
2884.24s: Yeah, like I said, I do a lot across market work, and I just have a hard time squaring that with what
2890.88s: I see across many sectors and across many stocks. In the tech sector, and I can't name names,
2897.28s: I would love to, because there's some names there that look outstanding that just tell me that
2904.00s: there's big upside ahead. It's not just semis. It's in other areas. Then in the industrials,
2913.84s: I've already talked about what Copper looks like, what steel looks like. There's a lot upside there.
2922.08s: The broker dealers is a big tell for me, because if they're going to go up, that means
2925.84s: that the stock market's going up right. You're not going to have a big run in stock brokers
2931.28s: if the market's going south. Those are for me indicators of a market that is
2938.72s: poised for much higher and soon. I think what I would argue is you've had a yes,
2948.56s: the consolidation has been more than I expected, but you had 120 base point drop in rates in a
2956.96s: few months' time. It's not unusual to have a counter-trend move that has to shake up all those
2964.16s: people. Then when I step back and look at non-treasuries, the jump bonds market,
2972.16s: HYG, JNK, it looks poised to reverse here. It's been with interest going up, but not that hard.
2983.84s: It's actually held up better than other aspects of the bond market. It looks to me like it can
2990.00s: reverse here and have a nice run. That speaks to an economy that's not falling out of bed.
2996.40s: That speaks to interest rates that are probably going to go down, not up.
3000.80s: When I look at investment grade, it's been held along with treasuries.
3007.20s: By the way, I think it looks like it's getting oversold now and ready for another move.
3014.00s: I think it's easy to extrapolate a move. That's what most people do.
3020.00s: Oh, they're going higher. That's how I forecast. I mean, I'm looking at indicators that tell me
3026.72s: it's more likely that you've had your consolidation. That doesn't mean it's going to turn tomorrow,
3032.80s: but I don't think we're heading to new highs on rates. Let's put it that way.
3037.76s: I see. Is there a discrete catalyst that then precipitates an up move in your view from here?
3046.40s: Do you think it's more of a slow capitulation and then stair step pattern up is just capital flowing in?
3052.88s: Yeah. If I put everything I see together, what I get as a scenario that basically says,
3059.84s: the economy still has enough legs. The industrial area is non-consumer areas that have lagged for a while.
3068.64s: They've been dealing with trying to get them in the inventory down and rationalize their production
3076.56s: to what the band is out there. I think they're starting to show signs that inventory is
3080.88s: in good shape, but they're beginning to produce again. I think the industrial side of the economy
3088.48s: looks like it's going to be pretty good into the summer. It's not about to fall out of bed. It's
3095.12s: actually getting stronger. When I step back, the consumer, I heard Bank of America today talking about
3105.36s: and they seem to have the best window on the consumer of any of the banks. They say their consumers
3111.36s: in great shape. I think Larry Fink at BlackRock just came out saying that money market
3119.52s: funds are at nine trillion, not six trillion now. We hadn't heard that before. We've heard six trillion
3125.36s: number. You've got a lot out there. Yes, credit card delinquencies are moving up. I think they're
3133.28s: the highest they've been in, and maybe 2011, but quite a waste back. You've got signs out there
3143.84s: of things that are troublesome for down the road, but they don't impact spending right now.
3153.04s: I think if I'm right, you're going to be in a sweet spot here where you're going to have
3159.68s: an economy that's soft landing at worst. This is a narrative, not my prediction, not my forecast,
3166.80s: but soft landing at worst and maybe no landing will be the narrative combined with interest rates
3174.24s: rolling back over, dollar rolling over, inflation going back, trending downward again. All those
3185.28s: things are again on the come that I can't point to a number now that says that's the case, but
3190.96s: that's what I see in trying to interpret the tea leaves and what the markets are telling me.
3198.16s: And then from a standpoint of how it feeds into the market, what I think you're going to see here
3203.52s: pretty soon. If I'm right that this corrections run its course and we're about to turn up,
3210.32s: I think a lot of those that I said had no conviction, they were bulls, but they had no
3216.24s: convictions. As a market turn tail, they did too, and they've been calling for 10% down, 15% down.
3224.64s: I think that's wasteful thinking. These are people who missed the whole move.
3229.44s: I'm buying large, missed the move from 3,500 up to now.
3233.76s: You know, may have jumped in a little bit here and there, but have, and once we went to new highs,
3240.80s: became more bullish, but said, I'm not chasing this thing here. It's overbought. It's way,
3245.76s: you know, it needs to correct. And they've been sitting saying, you know, like I said, it's
3250.48s: wasteful thinking, but they're entry point in their mind is 10% down, at least. And if they see
3259.52s: an S&P that gave them less than 4% down and then turned around, I don't think they're going to
3265.60s: wait very long. I think, you know, once this thing gets back up over 5,200, I think you're going
3273.20s: to see investors say, we can't risk this again. We can't miss this again. We got to jump in.
3281.36s: And I've talked about this in letters and maybe with you. I think we have the potential for what
3288.08s: I would call a buying stampede. And I would define that as all this money on the sidelines or
3294.48s: money that's in defensive areas, becoming more offensive, becoming more, you know, buying those
3301.44s: groups I'm talking about. And saying, I got to get invested. And all of them try to do it in a
3308.08s: fairly short two or three month timer, I said, you know, all coming in at the same time because
3313.28s: they all kind of missed this thing together and then waited for a bigger correction that didn't come
3319.92s: and now are capitulating and saying, I got to get in. And if they all kind of jump in and you know,
3325.68s: fairly concentrated period of time, I think you could find the market's pretty liquid being
3333.44s: on the way down. It was illiquid where everybody wanted to sell and they weren't in a lot of buyers
3337.92s: on the way up. Everybody's trying to buy in a lot of sellers. And what gives them is price.
3343.20s: That's how I think you can get on S&P that goes from $5,000 to $7,000 in a matter of months.
3352.16s: Interesting. Now, if you were to assign a confidence interval on the probability of that thesis
3361.12s: playing out as you outlined, let's say in the next few months, as you're kind of thinking about how
3365.92s: confident are you as of right now with what you know now that it'll play out in that frame?
3371.20s: Yeah, I never put a number on, but what I have said is this is a high conviction call.
3377.12s: It's not high conviction that it's going to happen between now and June or between now and July.
3382.64s: It's high conviction that it's going to happen in a concentrated period whether that is
3388.32s: three months, six months, you know, but to go 40 or 50 percent, yes, and the Russell, I'm actually
3395.04s: where it is now is more than 60 percent to my target. To have that all happen in less than six months
3402.96s: is unheard of. So that's my conviction. You know, I can't pretend to know which month
3411.52s: we tap out, but my conviction is the next several months. And it could very well be that it's
3418.16s: mostly done by the middle of the year, or it may be that it's not done until September, October.
3423.68s: I don't know, but my conviction is that we are in for the steepest rally in history,
3431.44s: or what certainly steepest, broadest rally in history. You know, Nasdaq might have been steeper
3437.12s: in 2000, 99, 2000, but this will come pretty close to that.
3443.92s: Mark it just closed. It landed down slightly down almost a quarter point. So not good.
3456.24s: A couple of other questions for you real quick. One of them is one of the parts of your thesis I'm
3461.12s: always interested to learn a little bit more about is the bust portion. And the things there that
3467.12s: I'm always fascinated by and what I try to draw the listeners attention to. I know a lot of people
3473.92s: they cling on to the numbers that you say because they're big numbers, right? Obviously somebody
3478.80s: would latch on to that. But what I try to direct people to is your to use your term that reading the
3486.40s: tea leaves. I try to pull out the way that you think about and construct a narrative based on
3492.72s: your breadth of experience because guess what? The only way you get 50 years in Wall Street is by
3499.20s: being in Wall Street for 50 years. You can't accelerate that time frame. I spend a lot of time
3503.36s: in markets, but I've been them for 16 years less than half of what you've seen. So it is really
3511.04s: interesting to me to tap into the way that you connect concepts together. So leading into the bust,
3518.56s: what are the catalysts in your view after we go through this melt-up phase which could take however
3525.76s: long it takes, but the thesis being it'll be a condensed period when it does start. What then rolls
3532.88s: us over into the bust because one of the things we talked about previously was kind of the global
3538.24s: economy. And right now at least as far as I could tell emerging countries don't look great. Let's
3544.48s: be clear. But some of the other just global our houses seem to be doing okay here. So I'd like to know
3553.04s: if that part of your thesis has adjusted at all, but more importantly, what are the primary catalysts
3559.20s: once we get to this blow off top that rolls us over? Yeah, first in terms of the other countries,
3565.12s: what I'd say is I'm not sure it's all that different from here and from the standpoint of
3572.24s: there's a lot of fragility underneath the surface. The countries I'll just look at Europe as an
3578.96s: example. It's been really amazing to see that two years ago, they didn't know where their energy
3588.00s: was going to come from. There was all kinds of horror stories about what that winter was going
3592.80s: to look like after Ukraine was invaded and they fortunately had enough stockpiled. They got
3600.48s: through that one and then the story was next winter where they were in that problems. And
3605.76s: the costs involved for them to purchase energy elsewhere on the market when they lost
3612.72s: the pipeline from Russia, from Ukraine was amazing to me that they were able to kind of soldier
3622.32s: their way through that and stay above water. They traded water but they stayed above water.
3631.44s: Listening to LeCard today, she contrasted the US and Europe from the standpoint of saying,
3643.12s: yeah, we're hanging in there but the difference is the US has a resilient consumer who spends,
3650.16s: spends, spends, we don't have that. She said our consumption is not showing those trends.
3656.16s: So I would take issue with those saying that the rest of the world is in pretty good shape. I think
3663.36s: they're in worse shape than us but they're kind of doing what we are which is kind of muddling
3669.20s: through and you think that maybe this is the worst of it and they can turn up from here. My concern
3675.68s: is that's not the case. This is the good side and then we turn down from here and I would say
3682.24s: the same thing. Canada, I'm getting this is anecdotal but I see on Twitter and many videos and stuff
3690.16s: of lots of people up north saying I can't afford to live here anymore. I don't know where to run to
3696.80s: but true dose made such a mess of this economy. I'm dying up here. It's the story we hear here in the US
3704.96s: from a lot of young people saying I can't afford to live on my own, I have to go back home.
3710.96s: You see in Canada times three. So I think Canada is not in great shape. Their policies are
3719.76s: I think doing harm to their consumer too. Australia I think is some of that. China we know is in
3727.68s: trouble. Japan is, I keep calling Japan the wild card. I mean there is something there that
3735.68s: you just can't print money. Audium finitum like they have and not run into a situation and have
3743.60s: zero rates and basically own all their bonds. The central bank own their bonds and not have that
3751.28s: go the other way at some point really cause you know what we saw on steroids. You know
3759.12s: once their rates break out there and they're a quandary and besides that the ends break, the
3767.20s: young keep going lower and so I actually, and this is not a prediction but I wonder if we're
3776.72s: getting close to some sort of a currency accord like the plaza accord in 1985 where you actually
3788.32s: coordinate a devaluation of the dollar versus these other currencies triggered by the yen basically
3795.04s: saying you know both the euro and the yen are having trouble, are struggling to you know
3802.56s: not go down and maybe you know maybe we need to do this and it certainly wouldn't hurt the US to have
3809.60s: dollar weaker. So I would not be surprised if that may be some of what the metals market is
3815.68s: sniffing out but again I'm not predicting that because it may not happen but I think it's potential
3823.52s: out there. So yeah I do think that to get to the bust it still could be triggered by a financial
3835.12s: problem particularly in Europe but overseas somewhere but my really my shorthand for the bust how
3842.24s: we get there it's or how I why I call for a bust is that we have this massive leverage like we've
3850.88s: never had before in the overall world system meaning the 320 trillion in global debt and I realize
3857.52s: a lot of this sovereign debt that's not going to go belly up but we got 320 trillion debt that's
3864.16s: that's a leverage that you don't want to have going into a weak economy and then on top of
3872.16s: that you've got quadrillions and nocial value of derivatives which is massive leverage on markets
3878.32s: and it just means whenever the shit hits the fan it's gonna you know it's gonna exacerbate whatever
3886.56s: happens in a big way. So you know we're so far beyond the leverage we had in 2008-09 and that's
3893.52s: why 2008-09 happened was because of massive leverage we're so far beyond those levels now that I
3900.48s: think the next downturn when it happens you know just go straight down and particularly a financial
3910.24s: system and we've got a combination of all that leverage and and the risks combined with central banks
3921.68s: that are hell bent not to make the same mistakes so they're they're telling us you know
3926.24s: Paul's telling us like art's telling us you know we don't want to pump up the system again
3932.08s: we're not going to do that again we're not going to do QE times four again well if you have a system
3938.96s: that's imploding that's the only thing you have you can do and if they're going to drag their fee
3945.52s: they will ultimately come to the conclusion they don't have a choice but that time spent where
3953.36s: they have their mind in the wrong direction that slows down the reaction the response it's in
3960.72s: that window of time when they're you know they're kind of fighting the last war when they should be
3968.16s: saying oh we don't have a choice we got print money like crazy because it just happened in 2020
3974.48s: when they printed five trillion they meaning the Fed because that was so recent and because and
3981.44s: because of all the criticism the Fed has received for what's happened to 2008-09 you know when
3987.76s: pumping you know QE to infinity all that stuff because that's fresh in their minds and they're
3994.72s: they're convinced that they can't do that again that just causes them to miss the window
4000.96s: did not respond quickly and it's during that vacuum that things can fall apart and then they'll
4008.32s: come in I mean they will react it's just they'll react slowly yeah matter of how late and how
4015.44s: much damage is done I was pulling up from S&P global the current relative leverage of risk
4023.92s: and it looks like it's 349 times for non-financials and the financial sector combined which is just
4031.84s: yeah that's an assured number I've never seen that but that's yeah that's really what is it's
4037.04s: massive leverage leverage combined with a slow response and ultimately a huge policy error
4047.36s: in terms of handling but you put that together and you know something gives it a hurry
4054.80s: yeah and again it's it's not something you can time precisely how all you can say is a
4060.64s: meltup comes first and again global bust is really referring to the financial system and the economy
4067.04s: but accompanying that in my opinion is an 80% fair market so you know they go hand in hand basically
4076.48s: yeah I know that we're a little bit over so I do appreciate you diving into that last part though
4082.96s: because I always like understanding a little bit more peaked behind the curtain on the the bus
4086.88s: side of things because I mean let's be honest people whether or not it happens to that degree whether
4093.20s: it happens in whatever time frame the theory and the way that you're thinking about the problem set
4098.32s: is still fascinating and there's a lot of interesting points you raise out and again like as you
4104.24s: start seeing stuff like 349 times leverage that's terrifying and you think that exactly to your point
4113.68s: that is the kind of thing that can get out of hand pretty quickly the only thing I can say is I look
4118.56s: at this chart that looks okay is that in June of 2020 it was at 352 times and now we're at 349
4127.52s: drop three points that's pretty good we're safe now right safe yeah yeah right yeah interestingly
4136.56s: I mean you saw how fast 2020 happened I mean in three weeks time the SB lost 35% it went from
4145.68s: seemingly okay in three weeks later you were down 35% it just shows you we live in a world today
4152.88s: where the speed is just can can be pretty amazing and that's what I that's what I think ultimately when
4162.56s: when it finally hits it can hit fast you know but I would also say people need to remember
4172.40s: because this isn't this the hardest part about all of this as an investor is the return that
4180.72s: can come here like I said the Russell called for more than 60% to my target and SB 40%
4190.56s: or close to 40 and now it's like probably more than that so the returns that we can get here
4196.56s: are returned you would get over several years normally that could come in three to six months time
4202.64s: frame and I have people that know my whole scenario and are really worried about the other side of
4209.84s: this and there's good to death to be in there and I go just know yourself because you know these
4217.20s: are returns the yes the time frame is that we could be in a bus by the end of this year for all I
4223.04s: know but the time frame is different than the magnitude of the return you know the returns are
4229.20s: three and four years worth of returns that may come in a very short window and if you
4236.08s: are out now because you're worried about what's coming after that and then the story becomes so
4242.88s: compelling at the top as it will be that you jump back in saying well I guess he was wrong
4247.92s: there's no bus coming you're getting in right as you're about to get hit you know so it's like
4254.40s: just know yourself you know everybody has to decide for themselves how they manage that scenario
4260.08s: assuming it's even right but just no no how psychology works and know that anticipating the downside
4270.96s: today for most people is not going to do any good because you're going to get swept into this
4276.80s: thing before it's over you know it's it's so easy to get caught up because because a story at the
4282.72s: top will be this is just getting started you know this is the cycle yeah this is a new cycle steel
4288.64s: just got started six months ago and copper just got started and you know these things have a long
4294.00s: runway ahead and you're going to sit down go well sure looks like it look what they've just done
4300.56s: and you get back in and then find out you know that light at the end of the tunnel is a train
4306.48s: coming the other way that part always just cake I just get such a cake out of how
4315.20s: repeatable the mistakes retail investors and traders make obviously I chuckle as you say that
4319.92s: because it's this story is old as time itself just it's not even like mis timing one side of the
4325.36s: trade it's the ability to miss time both sides almost perfectly I get such a cake out of the way
4330.80s: that most traders think about that stuff so it's a good thing it's it's not even just in the stock
4338.16s: market think about people have construction firms happens cycle after cycle you know they they
4346.56s: swear to themselves they're not going to get caught with inventory again you know they're not going
4350.88s: to build on spec or they're not going to have land or that and then what happens you know now it's
4355.92s: the national builders but what happens is things are so strong and they just they look like it's
4361.36s: going to go on for a long time and there they are again caught in the down you know the down turn so
4368.40s: you know get leverage leverage give it leverage take it but uh yeah David really really fun
4377.12s: to connect him with you thanks for hanging out for a little while if there's somewhere that you
4380.96s: want people to reach out to you where would that be sure mom twitter every day so at davage contrarian
4391.20s: I don't know if we have taken care of some of the duplicate account problems anymore the fake accounts
4397.76s: because I uh twitter took it upon themselves to give me a blue chuck mark and they did that to a lot
4403.84s: of people I guess that are decent followings um and I don't know if that really eliminates that problem
4409.84s: or not but hopefully it does I haven't seen so much of that lately yeah I'll give the the right link
4416.32s: anyways I'll throw that in the notes below okay so I'm I'm there and then I have a quarterly letter for
4421.36s: those that want to subscribe it's by you know by subscription so there's a cost to it um if they
4428.08s: want information they can direct message me on twitter and I'll give them details yeah perfect well
4434.08s: David thank you so much absolute blast hanging out and we will see what happens between the next
4439.60s: quarter that we connect I can only imagine it will be smooth sailing everything will play out exactly
4445.36s: as we think and then it will be exactly great chat with you David enjoy the spring we'll see you in
4452.80s: the summer thank you so much
