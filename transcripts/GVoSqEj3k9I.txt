0.00s: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the L.I.R. podcast. We have a familiar face, Matt.
7.44s: And it's been, is this the first time we talked this year? Is that correct?
11.72s: It's been a while. It's been a while now. I can't remember. But if it, if this is the
17.16s: first time we talked this year, we have a lot. And even if it's not within the last three
20.80s: months, four months, there's no shortage. So I am looking forward to catching up. We
27.36s: were literally just talking a little bit before we started about how business is going
31.36s: in general. So I thought maybe we'd just start there and dig right in.
34.92s: Yeah, for sure. So like we're like we're talking about just before. So again, my background,
39.56s: I'm always a little stock oriented, like more trend follower, but you know, tactical,
43.20s: not just like buying old kind of stuff. And came into the year, long started off well,
47.92s: then you know, the sell off began. And then it was like all the Trump tariffs were fortunately
51.84s: able to kind of pivot. And before things got nasty, so avoided all the drawdown, all the
56.48s: rest and able to kind of then reengage about a month now. And so like, you know, coming
61.52s: off the bottom is always, it's the biggest opportunity. But you know, the easy stuff's
65.12s: always visible in hindsight. So we got positioned pretty well. Like a, but like, you know,
69.76s: probably like half the stocks or the stocks I would have wanted to have together half
73.26s: have been a little more laggard because it's been like tremendous opportunity. So, but,
77.44s: you know, for me, every uptrend is like phases. You know, you get this first push. Now,
80.72s: I think we're due for a little bit of a pause and we're going to get another push. And
84.44s: so it gives you a chance to kind of then reposition whatever capital is not optimal. Let's say,
89.88s: you know, so it's been good. You know, thankfully, it's just like wild few years, even with clients,
94.04s: like talking about, it's like, you know, it's COVID, which was wild. You know, we dodged and
97.72s: participated. Then it was a 2022 bear market that was, you know, a tariff bear, it's like every
102.76s: year, just like a chance to really blow up and a chance to make a lot of money. So it's been a
106.52s: wild few years for everyone. It's funny because I find it, especially from like a step
114.28s: that's background, people always like to talk about the uniqueness of different time frames.
120.04s: Like, oh, there's a global pandemic. How often does that happen? Or oh, Russia invaded Ukraine.
125.96s: How well, Russia kind of has a history, but anyways,
130.60s: but it's like the thing that I try to remind people when we talk about market activity is that
137.40s: it's always something. There's always something. And it's actually more anomalous to be in these
143.56s: really prolonged periods where it's kind of quiet than to have these, you know, busier periods
149.72s: that just seem to have these different things going on now. It's been like a lot of weird things.
157.88s: I didn't have like, you know, school yard, like, fight on Twitter on my like, bingo card for things.
164.04s: I would just be up this year, you know? I'm literally getting smashed in a Tesla ratio called
169.24s: diagonal because big dad. I'm in a Tesla position. I'm like, you know, I feel like, you know,
174.28s: I was even watching it happening. Like, now it always in hindsight, you kick yourself. I should have
177.72s: I should have sold earlier, but at first, it's like a comment like Trump, Trump always has comments.
181.56s: He has a name for everybody. I mean, you must have a name for me somewhere in like Washington, you know?
185.32s: And it's like, then it's like, it was like a nuclear bomb and like slow, it was like a slow nuclear
189.56s: bomb like going off. And I was like, what the? And then finally I kicked it out and said, okay,
194.44s: just I don't know what way is going to go. I would want to be must right now. I'd have people
199.64s: tasting my food if I was and that's just the way it is, you know? It is so it's literally like
205.64s: watching mom and dad fight. And yeah, and they're they're they're driving the car and we're just
212.28s: kind of sitting in it like, yo, I can y'all figure this out? There's always something like I love
219.56s: history. I see kind of stuff. And like I was my boys now. They're seven and five. They love
224.92s: Rome and Roman history and all that. And I was just kind of think to myself it's so much like,
229.16s: you know, back even in the Roman era, there was like Caesar was, you know, that became the head guy,
233.80s: but there was like the triumphant at first. It was like, you know, I think it was Cassius. He was
237.80s: the guy with all the money. Then he was the, you know, Caesar was the politician. And so I,
241.88s: I mean, again, you have the like that scene dynamic must have the money guy and Trump's the politician
246.52s: guy. It's just amazing. Historically, how stuff just repeats in different ways. It's a wilder
251.40s: like the sea. You know, so it's it's always the same thing slightly different flavors. Yeah.
257.96s: I always one of my favorite things to think about is like, I call it the the veneer of civilization
264.20s: because I mean, I think like we are all vertical walking monkeys. And right now civilization
270.68s: makes it seem like we eat with forks and knives and we're so refined. I don't know which one to
275.08s: use, but I know there's multiple there, typically, but like if you strip everything away, right?
280.84s: And you put people in a survival situation, everybody's the same base against things. And you can
286.60s: see that magnify out in game theory, right? It's just different scope. Now, when you were positioning
294.28s: the beginning of the year, what did that look like? So again, because I genuinely can't remember if
299.88s: we connected early this year, but if we did, I remind me, if we didn't tell me for the first time,
307.00s: what, like what were your holdings? Not yeah, exhaustive list, but what were you doing the first
314.04s: part of the year? So funny enough, it's like a lot of the same stuff I still kind of have. Well,
318.04s: like not all, but like, you know, I had G. E. Vernova, which was like the big play of like a
321.64s: literacy demand that had a volunteer. But that, no, that I sold into a little earlier last year,
326.36s: but definitely G. E. Vernova. I mean, it was the AI trade. That's what I've been focused on.
330.84s: And it kind of fortunately, like I run some like extension hedges, like things get very extended.
336.60s: I'll buy us some like add-on money puts in case there's like a downside reversal, because it's
340.20s: always like stares up and elevators down. You know, so in that case, if you, it doesn't always work,
345.16s: but if you time it well, even once every four or five times, it's worth its while to do. And so
351.16s: at least I had some, because I had a really concentrated position in G. Vernova, and that broke with
355.48s: everything else, which now you look in hindsight, ridiculous, because of the whole deep seek.
360.36s: The number of news I had to deal with this year, like it's off the charts. But so that kind of
365.08s: got us already kind of happened to be change the portfolio, then the market just really started
369.00s: to deteriorate. And so then we went the cash, then after the whole paraffoluberation day thing
374.20s: happened. And when, you know, straight down, but we were already in cash by then, which was great.
377.88s: And then off the bottom. You normally don't trade to the short side, is that correct?
383.32s: You know what? It's like I've tried, I've done it over the years, like you went out as a market
387.08s: maker. It's like, it was always, but it was always like the long side. Even in two, I always tell
390.68s: people, even in 2008, I had a good year, but it was from the long side. I just, I'm not, I don't
394.92s: know what it is. I just like, everyone says you're always influenced by the first trades you make,
399.00s: whether it's long or short. And I guess that's, it's true in a certain extent. I always think long.
403.48s: So not that I'm always long, but that's just like the side I play from.
408.04s: I guess that might be true, unless you have like a lot of, what is it,
411.48s: fluoride in the water and you become semi on the spectrum like me because my first handful of
416.28s: trades were just buy and hold stock. And I haven't done that in like two decades. So that I guess
422.36s: I got broken. That doesn't apply at all. I can literally can't even imagine the longest I
427.08s: held the stock other than there's like two stocks I hold in the portfolio literally because of
432.92s: bets that I've made with people during live streams. And one of those bets I made, I literally
439.16s: want to call it like five four or five years ago. And I literally just hold the stock. And I
443.32s: said I would never sell it. So it's literally, it's going to die. I just going to, I'm going to
446.44s: die with the stock. Which one is it? It's AMC. AMC really. So we just, and I don't even know how
453.64s: I literally don't even remember how the bet came up. And I, and I don't remember who it's with.
460.28s: But they're out there and they'll know who it's with. And I now have to die with AMC in my portfolio
467.96s: because I said I would on a live stream. But I don't even know what it's doing right now. I've
473.96s: no idea. But I have it. So hopefully good. Hopefully people are watching movies. Hopefully good.
482.28s: So walk me through like the broader portfolio structure in terms of maybe average number of
489.16s: positions holding durations, stuff like that. It's a good question. Like I like to try and keep my,
495.96s: the way I put exposure on very consistent because I just through my, again, everything I do is through
500.92s: like looking back at the good and bad periods and trying to kind of figure out how, you know,
505.96s: raw wire differently and how to like not try and fight myself. So I just, and I think a lot of people
510.76s: go through this like, you know, when things are good, you tend to want to take bigger sizes. And
513.96s: when things are going bad, you want to go smaller. And then usually you're too cocky at the end of
518.76s: an uptrend and you too similar to the beginning of one. So it works against you on both sides. So
523.32s: for me, I just try and really make that part of the decision making black and white. I usually
528.12s: start your position at about a 10% of the portfolio. And, and I try and build like I like to have a
533.56s: position be about 25, 30% of portfolio, but I'll build with subsequent 10% purchases along the way.
540.92s: And so that usually, so usually like, you know, at the beginning of a trend, you don't know who the
544.76s: winners are going to be like we're talking about before. So you usually get up to like 8, 10, 12 stocks.
550.04s: And then my aim is always to kind of like trim the laggards, free up the cash, and then redeploy
554.36s: into the winners. So usually get up to 10, 12 and by the time like I'm hot in a trend, it's probably
558.76s: 5, 6 stocks that I'm holding. And that's just been like, that's always been like kind of the space
563.32s: that been comfortable in. It's not too few stocks that one will, will hurt you too badly. And it's
568.36s: not too many that you can't like stay focused and manage these positions. So that's always a work for me.
573.24s: When you're sizing one of your positions, let's say it starts at 10% of portfolio value.
580.44s: What's the average amount of portfolio value that's actually at risk? I'm assuming that there's a
588.04s: stop that you have in place, typically at some supportive assistance level.
592.92s: So like on the average, it's probably 4% to 5% of that position. So like, you know, 4, 10, 5, 10th of
598.28s: percent, this is like what it is. And that's a stat I track when I'm putting on positions. Because
603.32s: you know, it's like you can always look at one position, but you know, we all were all guilty. We
607.16s: all make a rule. Then we find ways to circumvent it with like other ways of achieving ourselves to
611.96s: doing what we really want to do. So yeah. So you know, you know, each, each stock is fully, you know,
618.20s: controlled and risk. But then you have way more positions open. And then after you still have
622.36s: all this exposure. So I always track when I'm putting on positions, what's the total exposure? If
627.56s: every stock gets to stop, what would be the actual cumulative loss of all of them? So like, I always
633.00s: try and keep that like under 2% like as I'm building. And then after I do Titan stops and freeze
638.28s: up risk capital for more positions, that's always kind of how I try and approach it.
642.44s: Got it. And then walk me through the process of trimming off the laggards. I assume there has to be
649.16s: some level of not just saying this one's worth this much, this one's worth this much. I imagine
653.88s: there's got to be an element of opportunity that you're expecting to see and stuff like that.
658.44s: Yeah. So it's a lot of it is time-based and then performance. So the kind of stocks I'm trying
665.56s: to approach is it's always from like the William O'Neill perspective. Those who don't know him,
670.20s: we were able to make money in stocks, legendary guy. And it's from the perspective of each cycle,
674.76s: there's like the it's stocks. There's like the main, like for example, the past couple years
678.12s: as it was in video. It's one of them. You know, right now, I'd say like Robin Hood is one of them.
682.68s: Don't say that. Don't say that. Well, anyways, you know, I've decided that everybody has to have
689.24s: a completely rational thing to hate. And I've selected Robin Hood. Really? Yeah, I just hated.
695.48s: I just decided one day that I hated with all my guts. So well, I don't edit these, but I'll pretend
703.00s: I edited that out. Okay. So you know, if you go back and you've studied these charts, like,
709.96s: you know, like William O'Neill would talk about, it's they have a character and they should be
713.64s: moving at a certain rate. And they'll always kind of like outperform the vast majority of stocks.
718.76s: Like it's not like a little bit of an out. It's like a game changer. Like if you add Nvidia in
723.16s: you know, 2023, 24, like not like my rule is a leader should have two qualities. It should go more
729.88s: up more than the market on up swings, but then also fall less than the market on downsuits. And
734.76s: and I think the track is as well as like we tend to kind of sometimes just look at a stock that's
738.44s: high beta, very volatile. So it'll go, it'll beat the market on the upside. But it's just so
743.00s: crazy. It's not really leading. It's just it's just an volatile stock. So my aim is always like, so
747.56s: once we get the stocks, I always look to the two, two, three weeks out to how the performance is
751.40s: going. And the ones that most closely satisfy that and have the biggest gains are the ones I try
756.52s: to fund on more money in and everyone else typically, even if it's like a half decent trade,
762.12s: it'll be a eight, 12, 15% gain. And you take some of those. It offsets the chop. The ones that are
768.20s: three, four, five percent losers several times. And then at the end, you should have like a good
772.52s: core position that will represent like sizeable profit cushions and some of the better names. And
778.12s: the the job is over the bull market to be able to kind of build into that a little bit more.
782.68s: Yeah. Now for those positions you had mentioned like a like a couple week look period, but when you're
793.00s: when you're looking at your winners and losers, I imagine very different average holding durations.
800.52s: What would those look like? Yeah. So that's why it's interesting. People always ask,
804.52s: like, came out, what's your holding period? And it's like it's like any staffed, you know,
808.60s: could lie if you want. But really, there's like two, like a bi-modal like this. There's like most
813.64s: stocks are probably two weeks, you know? And then after there's a smaller cohort, which actually
819.56s: is there is, which actually has most of your profit at the end of the year, like the net profit,
823.72s: that's probably three, four months. Like so it's kind of those are the two, the two ranges. It falls
829.08s: one and one of those. Which makes entire sense, right? Like if you think about the market effect
834.44s: in the profit mechanism, you're you're looking to capture, right? It moves, it's wrong removes
839.56s: over those kinds of durations. So I think that aligns exactly with what I would expect.
844.20s: When you're first building out your portfolio, what's the layering approach as you're both
854.52s: scaling into a position that you like and adding new ones? Like how do you decide between that?
861.32s: So it's like I run a couple of like there's two, there's two methods to my madness. Let's say,
865.56s: you know, so one is the relative strength. But you want to be in the best stocks. But then after
869.72s: there's like the core principle, like I always take a trade off of is like the risk of reward set up.
873.88s: So sometimes as the stock extends itself, yeah, I can just kind of keep ripping higher and higher.
878.76s: But there's no good place to base your entry off of. So like every time I buy a stock, like my
884.52s: baseline is like, hey, Matt, can I make five dollars for every dollar of risk I'm taking on in this
889.24s: trade? So as a stock, it's extended. It's harder and harder to say yes to that. So it's trying to find
893.80s: the best stocks as a layer one. So like the ideal time to go hunting is in a correction when everyone's
900.60s: scared and everyone thinks the market's going forever down. That's when it's so it's most obvious
906.44s: to see the leadership is that the stock won't break when the market's breaking down. I mean, there's
911.48s: no stronger indication that investors really want that stock, you know, because everything is just
915.80s: so tied to the indexes. And so once that kind of starts to move, you try and position the best you
919.96s: can there. And then after it's, that's always a fight. Once the best trades are gone, then it's all
924.52s: about trying to find lower risk entries because the situation is even if you identify the leaders,
930.12s: the volatility is so severe, like you can get easily over a couple of days, like 15% drops on
935.56s: these leading stocks. And so you take a few of those and even if you have a 50% gain or it doesn't
941.40s: matter anymore. So I always have to try and fight to find those lower risk entries. So it's a
945.88s: combination with factors. I see. So walk me through what February and March of this year looked
956.36s: like. Obviously, everybody thought that the sky is falling. It falls directly into I actually think
963.24s: it qualified as a bear market, but it definitely falls into your correction criteria. Well,
970.84s: what were your trading activities in that time frame looking like? Yeah. So it was it was tricky
975.64s: because we came in like doing really well. Like there was like the market was chopped to start the
979.96s: year, but like the outperformance and like I said, stocks like GE, Renova, I had Celestica, which is
984.52s: like another, you know, components for data. They were still rocking in that period of time. So it
989.32s: was like a good start to the year. And then, you know, like most things like when the market starts
993.72s: to turn, like the better names start to like break one at a time. So they kind of started the
997.32s: forces out, but still held held our own pretty well. Like still slightly positive, you know, the
1001.40s: market was rolling. But then by the time we got into like late February and things picked up,
1005.16s: like you're full cash. And then after by the time of liberation, they, you know, that whole
1008.68s: tariff rollout happened full cash, which was great. And so that's the beauty. You know, if you're
1016.28s: flexible with the market and you're not forcing it, for me, the aim, I have the two biggest
1021.00s: aims I have is to not miss a big full market and not get caught in a big, big market. Everything
1024.60s: else in the middle is noise. It doesn't matter. You'll sometimes you'll kill it some cycles.
1028.04s: Sometimes you'll you'll lag a little bit. It's not a big deal. So for me, it was like mission
1031.88s: accomplished came in. We were positioned well. The market frat a gas, you know, as a trend follower,
1036.04s: there's only so much you can do. And and then after repositioned late April start,
1040.92s: they kind of build back into some of the key names. So it's honestly, we're not like I,
1045.16s: it could have been a much better year if we've been more aggressive at the bottom. But again,
1049.00s: the bottom is never clearly the bottom in real time. You know what I mean? So I deal with a lot of
1054.04s: clients like you have to take into consideration. Like, you know, it's not as if you're a trader on a
1057.72s: desk when like you're just pouncing all the end because this is your call and you want to run it. Like
1062.36s: most people have very strong, you know, aversion to risk and all the rest. So trying to thread the
1068.20s: needle between finding these great stocks, but not taking that massive risk. So but we were able to
1072.92s: pivot nicely off the bottom. And so far, we have a good little stable of stocks that are performing
1077.32s: really well here. What what do your holdings look like in terms of numbers right now?
1083.24s: So right now we have the holdings we have our Palantir, Ibit, GEV, Hood, Meta,
1091.08s: will NBIS and a little more Ibit. But like I said, most of these have really good cushions like
1097.72s: Palantir. It's from like a $93 cost basis like GEV is from $375. I wish I had more of that one.
1105.00s: Robin Hood's from 47. So like these are the ones that like the the positions that were I mean,
1109.48s: there's others that have come and gone along the way. But again, kind of back to like our
1113.24s: mode of operation. It's the aim is to kind of call out what's not working and keep the better names.
1118.36s: And this is what's done. We had we had Tesla yesterday until yesterday, but that's that's not
1123.72s: there anymore. Unfortunately, but in just imagine what that could all look like with some long options.
1131.08s: The potential.
1134.92s: We've only we combined both of our craziness together. We'd have some super craziness.
1139.88s: Man, just think. Just think he creases the risk. You do have to pay for the ball. Who cares?
1149.88s: I think though, you know, because coming off the bottom though, like the ball is so high that
1154.92s: really makes it expensive. Like I mean, let's say you were so I also have like all my buy-in.
1160.12s: Most of these were put on beginning of me. Of course, obviously, you know, like let's say G.E.V.
1164.92s: was me first, Robin Hood me seven. When Palantir was April 23rd.
1170.36s: The ball was high back then. So I'm like at the same time, like that's that's the issue as well,
1175.00s: right? Sort of, right. But you know also from your market making days, there's a bunch of ways
1181.72s: that you can decrease the total impact of that ball. So it's funny because I have a long position
1188.28s: and Palantir myself, but I'm using options that are out in 2027. So the vague component to those
1196.12s: will be higher. But the overall changes involved that hit that under the curve is so low.
1202.36s: This is so far out of time. So the total ball that I've experienced has been trivial and the cost
1209.48s: itself is trivial, especially compared to like the leverage gained. I know that you have your
1216.36s: approach. And obviously I was joke about trying to like slowly, subtextually. My hope is to slowly
1221.72s: hypnotize you on one of these calls. All I'm going to do is put up like one of them spinning wheels
1227.00s: and then and then try to hypnotize you. So that's that's my long-term vision here is because
1236.20s: what could be cool is maybe if you and I if we find a way that as you're putting on your equity
1244.12s: position, I'll put on an options position and then we can just see how it goes.
1253.16s: Sure. Sure. I think that could be super fun because one of the things that I actually think
1258.20s: is really cool about using an options position, especially in some of these things, is you can
1264.44s: decrease a lot of the chop of like in and out if you use the option itself to define more of the risk.
1271.80s: So you buy the option at the component that it's 2% of the total portfolio risk whatever you want
1276.92s: it to be and then you just let that thing go until like directionally you're completely disproven.
1282.12s: Like the is some of that timing element I think, which is good because I can't time anything. So
1290.12s: it's what I've learned no matter what I do, the market obviously will find a way to do the opposite.
1296.60s: And my Tesla position is I mean I literally don't know if I could have timed it worse.
1303.24s: I might have been able to kind of slightly but it was pretty damn bad.
1308.52s: Did you buy that like a week and a half ago by Hens?
1311.08s: Where did I get into? Where did I get into Tesla?
1316.20s: So Tesla was on, ah good, love that 23 May. It's the old.
1321.56s: At least before the last hurrah up the last bump up.
1327.08s: The old 23 May. Yeah, yeah, definitely before the last hurrah bump up and right through the last
1334.28s: hurrah bump down. But again, it's funny right because in Tesla the way that I set up that position
1341.32s: is it's limit like the risk is defined by the position size. So that's also out in 2027.
1348.12s: I couldn't care less what Tesla does in your term because I think Elon Musk is going to have
1352.76s: a walking robot that can like bitch slap somebody pretty soon which is going to sell like hotcakes.
1357.00s: That was the idea and the whole thing but yesterday it was quite the curveball I guess you can say.
1365.48s: So it definitely will shake some hands out I think that that's the issue.
1369.96s: The issue I have because again, I think the reason behind Tesla was one of my larger positions,
1376.60s: the thinking is not only do you have to develop the AI, you also have to have the ability to
1382.04s: physically create all of this stuff. And so Tesla's uniquely positioned that it also has all the
1386.68s: manufacturing and all the rest. The only problem is when that kind of spat happened and it kind of
1391.80s: soured me, you're also like I really didn't want to have to go over and stalk was that the current
1398.60s: earnings per share for Tesla is two bucks. If you go to a 20 PE, you're a $40 stock.
1403.88s: You know what I mean? So there's a real halo around Tesla of confidence which you have to kind of
1408.20s: maintain or else the stock would be by any other normal metric like much much much lower. So
1413.88s: it was just kind of going like head to head with the president of the United States when you'd
1417.56s: probably need a lot of regulatory approvals coming in like the future if you want like autonomous
1422.20s: cars and autonomous robots and all this kind of stuff. That was it. I will see how it turns out.
1427.64s: It's just you know at this point it's going to be one to watch. I still think Musk is going to
1432.36s: deliver on all that but it's just the other risk that's there now. I don't know how sour or how
1437.80s: bitter that relationship is because it went pretty nuclear on the the chats. Yeah which is it's
1443.64s: super interesting because like if I were to think of another perspective on that I think regardless
1449.48s: of where Trump and Musk land I think there's no world where the US wouldn't want to be one of the
1456.68s: leaders of broader adoption of autonomous driving vehicles. That not only is just massive global
1463.08s: positioning but to be able to integrate that kind of technology can have a lot of all the
1467.72s: want impacts I think. So I always view these kinds of things it's Tesla. Like I know whenever you
1475.40s: look at Tesla you are partially playing the news cycle. Like just what happens? What happens?
1481.40s: Does Elon happen to puff a J on Joe Rogan? It pops up here. So it's like yeah I
1491.56s: and that's exactly why that's a perfect example of a position when I put on I literally define it
1496.84s: as the size of the trade and then I just let it go because yeah yeah. I don't know your experience
1502.44s: with trying to time it because you can make a lot of money in Tesla. I mean that that most recent
1507.80s: run post earnings from what? Like 230? Little higher 230 to like 365? That's a decent move.
1515.64s: But you have to be able to navigate it with with Elon just you know making silverware sculptures
1524.68s: while he's sitting next to the president. You know there's a reason why there's not many people who
1530.52s: have accomplished what he has. It's not it's not the the average guy who does the non average thing
1536.68s: you know so I guess it goes to the territory you know. Now when you were seeing the the Trump
1543.80s: tariffs rolling out were you starting to try to play another shorter term theme that you might
1552.12s: have been seeing around that time frame or was it just purposefully as you said moving to cash and
1557.40s: just fully waiting until you see the AI theme come back online. Yeah I was already in cash it was
1563.16s: just matter of staying there and then it was really the hunt day by day because okay the tariffs
1568.20s: there's you know there's many ways it could have seen a guy going worse but again you look at the
1572.76s: personality Trump you wrote the art of the deal you know so he's a guy who likes to make deals like I
1578.92s: mean I think most people it became very political for most people because some people either
1583.64s: love or hate Trump and so it was you know it was just another reason to like you know dislike him if
1588.52s: you didn't like him you know or whatever and so for me it was you know the baby was thrown out
1595.48s: the bath water like like everything was sold in an AI company a tech company that's innovating what
1600.04s: does that have to do with tariffs you know like it over the intermediate term like absolutely nothing
1605.16s: you know so I figured things would be walked back this is a little more of a V recovery than I
1609.08s: expected which is a good thing I'll take it when it comes you know it's it's always kind of hard
1612.92s: to tell when something will be or not but for me it was really about sitting back like I said it's
1617.96s: in those corrections if you're lucky enough to be in cash that's when you have like the biggest
1623.32s: opportunity not just because you have cash to deploy but like your mind is that your eyes are not
1627.88s: clouded by dealing with these losing positions like when you're dealing with the losing positions it's
1632.68s: not only that you have less buying power is that your mind frame is about fixing the mistake you made
1637.16s: so when you we're already in cash I mean that's why in 2020 as such a a banger year because like I was
1642.04s: again cash going to that drop and then coming out it was all about okay losing a benefit from this
1645.96s: is every crisis is going to have someone wins or at least or at least it's going to uncover who's
1650.68s: winning because the stocks will fall and it was similar playbook you know like there's for me
1655.80s: there's no better situation than when the market goes through I was 15 20% drops and I can
1660.44s: size that multiple that's like that that's that's all because it really sets up your mind and your
1665.08s: position for the next cycle let's talk about that a little more of your methodology of like
1672.04s: timing your timing just portfolio exits before or you know during the early stages of these kinds
1679.00s: of market corrections and deeper corrections into bear markets so I used to be more just trend oriented
1687.88s: but that can be quite painful at the end of a trend because you know by the time you realize
1691.80s: that trend is over there's a lot that can be given back so what I do is I when I see trend
1696.36s: extensions so so the tough part is that trends won't always end the same way you can end with a
1700.76s: bang where you get like a nice climax kind of run up and it's really obvious other times you
1704.68s: kind of just slowly top and then roll over and then by the time like this is more of that one day
1709.08s: like by the time you realize there was a problem like before was obvious like a lot of pain to be had
1713.64s: you know so so I run basically there's another indicator I use like on the short term basis I
1719.48s: call it by formal indicator it looks at the percentage of stocks on the NASDAQ above their respective
1723.96s: five day average and so when things are running hot I try to actively force myself to trim
1731.16s: into strength because if you're if you're trimming when things are coming down you're always playing
1735.16s: catch up and it's like a bad place to be so kind of my process when you're at the end of these
1739.56s: cycles and you're you want to prepare it's it's easy when it's a climax top because it's so obvious
1744.52s: and even if you're bitter early eventually there's going to be the parties in the end but it's
1750.28s: those those slow-growing top markets could be the really tricky ones and so that's just like the day
1755.56s: by day you know really looking at how how are the components of the market doing like there's the
1761.96s: index itself sometimes the index is super helpful once a climax top the index is helpful to study
1767.00s: because you can see that climactic action when it's a slow grinding top it's the action beneath
1772.84s: the surface and I think that those are the tops I get a lot of retail people because they're
1777.16s: looking at the attack it's just going sideways there's nothing wrong but internally you know people
1781.56s: are going into Apple they're going into Microsoft and it could be on a relative basis you know so I
1785.96s: mean people are buying Apple at this point for safety because it's like it's kind of like the big
1790.28s: stall work you know so looking at those rotations then looking at your P&L like you know
1795.08s: marketing you hide today but I can't make any progress it's like one day one week two weeks
1799.56s: and it all apples out performing or whoever's out performing and that's like a lot of the
1803.80s: science starts scaling back and you know in the past I would fight them because you know like not
1807.40s: all of the QQs to looks good and then but at the deterioration eventually unravels so there's
1812.84s: like the two types of tops and that's the kind of like the playbook they use for them yeah so the
1818.36s: recent top in SPX a little bit more of like that rolling top do you remember what some of like the
1826.60s: first early warning signals that you saw that were like this ain't it like what did the playbook
1831.80s: look like for this move specifically so this was tricky because like I said you start to see some
1839.40s: stuff beneath the surface but then after there was a subset of like AI stocks that were still
1843.48s: really really powerful so it's like I was you know so it's like even if there are warning signs if
1848.12s: you're like actually still pushing like you know a year-to-date highs you tend to start to kind of
1852.84s: ignore that a little bit unfortunately because you figure okay I've got the right rocket
1856.36s: ships if the market just improves a little bit we're gonna explode and then I forget exactly which
1861.08s: point it was it was like really like April 20 sorry February 21st or so like when you had those
1865.88s: big breaks we're starting to become like really obvious like especially actually on
1870.68s: February 20th was like one day off of all-time highs we kind of like just like step into all-time
1875.80s: highs on the on the S&P on low volume really uninteresting in the next day one metric I watch very
1882.84s: closely is the stocks making 52 week highs versus 52 week lows and the market should never be
1889.56s: at new highs and there's more stocks breaking down than breaking up that's actually you know the
1893.96s: exact same pattern we saw in 2021 when there's this like flight to safety these big names like it's
1899.32s: like Apple they absorb so much capital like an iceberg you know they take up so much capital and
1905.08s: you know the smart money rotates into those and they kind of distribute everything else slowly so
1909.48s: it's rare but sometimes like that was a signal there that really got me to kind of get more aggressively
1914.28s: sorry conservatively positioned because we were one day off of all-time highs and you have more
1919.40s: stocks making 52 week lows that was a really really funky internal kind of change and then things
1925.32s: really start to accelerate to the downside make sense it's funny because one of the indicators I
1931.72s: think you and I both use is net highs lows and it's that's actually one of the thing I have in my notes
1938.76s: on the the day following I I want a slightly different direction and I just started trimming a lot
1946.28s: of the more momentum based stuff but you boil run it to the downside which I didn't get in right
1953.96s: then it was actually the day after where we had that significant breakdown that was just like
1960.04s: yeah let's go yeah I am I am that D Gen retail trader that just paid through the nose for long puts
1968.76s: disgusting don't even remember what the vol was couldn't possibly care less let's just let's just
1973.32s: rock yep okay yeah it's worked out great which you can get a move to the downside there's no
1980.04s: better like return it's instant it's fast and it's like a it's it's wild so yeah well and I was
1985.56s: also thinking maybe I mean because when were you a market maker that was 2008 to 2012 13 yeah okay
1995.00s: so I feel like you should at least send me like a a thank you card at some point because obviously
2002.60s: with my trading antics I bought you something I don't know what it was you know best when you'd
2007.56s: have like a nice red you're waiting there and I remember he's like sit there having a coffee with
2010.84s: the guys and this was like before hft went wild you know so you have like your resting orders on
2015.48s: these stocks and like have a kind of like thing and like someone just crossed it like we get these
2019.40s: alerts you know I'll be little things it's like someone crosses widespread like well thank you I'll
2022.84s: take that thank you very much and so those are good days man that was a lot of fun that's me
2027.64s: bumbling over all the trip wires just just kind of stumbling along it's good I think like the newer
2033.24s: crowd who didn't trade back then they don't realize how lucky are how liquid stock like markets are
2039.00s: everything is pretty spread or fight like back then like there was like wider spreads and it was
2043.32s: because I mean because I remember like I never traded that way but you know eights and quarters and
2047.48s: all that kind of stuff like the older school guys when I started like they were used to like
2051.88s: these really widespread like I mean what I thought was wide at you know 10 cents 20 cents they're
2056.36s: like well this is this is like a narrow market you know if they saw today's market their heads
2059.64s: would like we're blow off you know so yeah like right now it's like things have changed so much because
2064.60s: of HFTs on the short term and it's great for Aussie for retail traders it's massively better it's
2070.04s: completely in the favor of retail and so many well it it it absolutely forces the market makers
2075.08s: to be more honest with what they're putting out there otherwise those start getting the market
2078.44s: makers are gone HFT 8 everything you know they made they made up for smaller spreads with just massive
2085.24s: scale so like now they're taking like a fraction of a penny but doing it like an endless number of
2090.52s: times every day rather before it was like a wider spread so it went from you know a few a few
2095.64s: thousand guys making really like an awesome living to four guys were billionaires and that's
2100.52s: kind of like what happened that's good that that is the American way nice and capitalist
2106.60s: just consume everything good that's it you had mentioned the V-shape recovery which I think
2113.08s: is interesting because I I also I thought that the V-shape recovery from COVID was slightly
2122.60s: interesting but I feel like you could explain it in a couple different ways right like on press
2127.48s: attempted fed stimulus and blah blah blah blah blah blah there's this V-shape recovery
2133.56s: what happened I think this is you know I know it's not the big political size but like you know
2138.52s: they say like Trump's arrangements syndrome like that the the amount of like this rule hate for
2142.68s: people who don't like Trump is so strong I think it caused like again like I I have a policy like
2149.32s: when it comes to like trading I'm politically neutral even with clients I ever talk politics you
2153.64s: know it's like we got to make money here the politics is for like the weekend but like I think I
2158.76s: think people got so upset I think it caused even people who ran models or all you know even like you
2164.04s: moving big you know blocks of stock I think they got political they got fear like I
2168.52s: mean I like do this and he's gonna do I mean you just thought everywhere it's like you know like
2171.80s: that people were just freaked out by like how like you know there's always like like you say
2177.16s: every cycle the same to worry about but when you already are a person who really dislikes and
2181.40s: distrusts the person in charge and you feel like they're going off the rails that that's your
2184.84s: perspective you feel like there's no coming back because your your your your eyes are kind of
2189.48s: covered by by your your dislike and so I think so we got so offside that after when
2195.32s: deal started to happen which in their mind couldn't happen I think this V shape it just that like
2199.48s: people were just forced to buy back and relentlessly higher pace because they just got way too much
2204.76s: to cash or to short bias or whatever so because it doesn't again I don't think it really
2210.28s: makes sense to kind of get back to like such a V it seems a little bit extreme like it's not
2214.20s: the way I would have thought of what it rolled out but I think it's because position just got
2217.56s: so one sided then it just forced everyone to have to pay whatever do you think that there's a new
2223.72s: general law I hate framing it this way because there's always this but like do you think that there
2228.20s: is a change in market paradigm though where volatility just base volatility is changing not in terms
2235.24s: of like VIX but in terms of just leverage position sizing frequency of trading is to your point the
2242.68s: expansion of things like high frequency trading we would expect actually to control some of that
2247.72s: but then the last couple big moves we saw were kind of like this that seemed to just just leave
2255.32s: volatility or do you think it's more just a function of what the events were?
2261.80s: It's hard the market's always changing like even the market itself like like you know we talk
2265.64s: about going from like before to hft to now and that there's something like points in time like
2269.56s: you know the advent of like the commission of free trading now retail traders so much bigger there
2273.96s: was Wall Street, Fats era like so it's hard to say you know I feel like markets eventually always
2279.72s: kind of get back to the same place and they adjust for all of these things I think the volatility
2283.00s: this time was because it was a headline driven issue like you know if you look at oh wait which was
2287.80s: you know bad it was was even worse but it's like it was a deteriorating situation where people would
2294.44s: wake up in the morning like oh there's no solutions at a problem okay sell here because it was literally
2299.88s: like similar to like yesterday with all the musk like Trump tweets it's like tweets going off and
2304.12s: like wow what happens like if you go back to actually early 2018 which is like that you know
2308.84s: tariff war version one with China was equally really really jumpy and volatile and all the rest so
2315.24s: I think it's just a function of like the way Trump does things and freaks out markets and
2320.92s: markets have to respond because it's a real economic consequence if you put something in you can't
2325.40s: just ignore it but I think it's I didn't think that why we go back to normal I mean even under Trump
2330.92s: if you look at like the 2019 rally like after there was like the whole powel pivot when you know the fed
2337.16s: kind of caused that bear market in late 2018 like when we came off of that Trump was still in power
2342.12s: and that was like a very nice smooth steady uptrend and all the rest so whatever it's like tariffs
2347.56s: that whenever Trump's like trying to deal making especially the way he does is deal making with like
2351.96s: massive threat and walks it back it's that's like a worst case scenario for markets in terms of
2357.00s: volatility also you know there's a lot of market out makers out there will probably love Trump for
2361.48s: that but if you're a directional trader it makes a trick I like to sit here and visualize the
2369.16s: prospects of like Trump sitting on the toilet or like just sitting on the back patio just completely
2375.40s: serene typing out this tweet launching it and like in the back of his mind going that's going to
2381.00s: fuck everybody up and then just like going about his day yeah you know it's a it's really
2388.28s: uncharted territory I feel like it probably is something like that yeah yeah so buddy so
2395.16s: with AI still developing your job and your approach is to find the next wave of AI leaders
2407.64s: yeah which is hard because there's so much stuff that's fluff and not true or exaggerations or
2415.32s: just straight up you know like made up and people pumping stock so you know like you have to you
2421.56s: have to try as much as you can to kind of say you know figure out what's the real deal on what
2426.84s: is and which is not always easy in real time and then charts help you to a certain extent but
2431.16s: but to me that it's like we were talking about before I think this is the internet rollout even bigger
2436.04s: because the internet made everything faster but in a lot of ways it did you know if we actually get
2443.00s: robots and things you know things to think for us and to actually physically act for us it's a
2450.28s: whole other step forward compared to what the internet was you know so this could be even bigger but
2455.00s: we're if you compare it's in terms of timing like I was saying before we start like I think it's
2458.76s: like a 1994 era because if you look at the internet similar kind of rollout it started off with
2463.48s: infrastructure stuff like it wasn't it wasn't Yahoo and AOL or Charles Schwab that like started off
2469.64s: that dot com like they were the peak that was the that was the output of all the infrastructure
2474.12s: spending early on like the early leaders regards like Cisco I mean I was like router switches like
2479.16s: yeah power is the internet but no one like goes onto their browser and is thinking of Cisco you know
2483.48s: that was like so similar to today like Nvidia even though it was a semiconductor it's infrastructure like
2488.68s: nobody uses Nvidia when they're writing their AI it's in the background powering everything so
2493.16s: we're still at the point where we're talking about electricity generation like we need nuclear
2497.24s: plants we need more power like this is this is still the phase of the massive investment of this
2502.52s: new opportunity to lay the groundwork for the stuff to actually be created like I think the autonomous
2507.32s: vehicles that'll be some of the first mass like AI products besides like the chatbots which are
2514.12s: already out so I think it's going to be interesting to see like all all these different new mechanisms
2520.28s: and products and services that actually go beyond like the chatbot box and really interact with
2525.80s: us in real life I think that's going to be that's going to be when we start to you know progress
2529.08s: from early 90s to the late 90s then to the to the eventual climax top that will get so as you see
2536.92s: every company in their earnings release saying AI just so that they can get some tailwind how do
2543.32s: you differentiate like the actual companies that matter you have to you have to really dive in like
2549.72s: what percentage of their revenue is really AI driven you know so you know like for example like
2554.52s: core we've had a big run because again like you you look at the this stuff and I'm not a tech guy
2558.76s: so it's like no struggle sometimes thank you they have chat gbt to help me out or groc oh yeah
2563.64s: like you know but like you know core we was like the neo cloud like what the heck is that like
2567.40s: already like you know there's there's AWS and Microsoft this year and it's you know it's like the
2572.12s: cloud infrastructure that's specifically tailored to people who want to run this AI type of
2576.60s: infrastructure and so specific chips and it's quicker and faster to connect and they just took a
2581.40s: big part of this new market and so it's like every time you look at someone like something like
2585.24s: Celestica like they're a components business like they have a lot of traditional businesses
2591.00s: and so if you look at their sales numbers they're like okay they're like mid 20s but if you dial
2595.16s: into their their businesses there's like the legacy business and then those that are like AI data
2599.96s: center related and like the data center related stuff like sales are climbing at 100% like year
2604.92s: over year so trying to figure out like you know okay if this is your business fine and how's it
2610.04s: directly benefit and how's it really going to the bottom line you know so I'm not someone who like
2614.36s: stuff that's like pre revenue or anything like I want to actually something selling something
2618.12s: it could be like earnings negative but there better be like some massive demand for your product
2622.04s: and you want to see that come through in sales so for me that's like one of the first first steps
2627.32s: I like to look for when trying to figure out if it's a company that's actually AI or just saying
2631.00s: like oh we're going to do some AI that doesn't really mean much so we get a list of companies that
2637.40s: actually have AI is a pretty meaningful percentage of their sales and revenue what's the next filter
2643.32s: so then once you get that I always want to see a certain amount of liquidity I don't like like
2648.60s: the very small cap types of names like I try and get more concentrated size so I need a little more
2653.24s: liquidity but then after truly about if that's the case we should see relative strength you should be
2658.28s: doing better than the market doesn't mean going up more but if the market is weak you should be
2662.76s: you know resisting that weakness and then be first the pop so it's you know if the whole thesis of
2667.72s: AI is correct and I feel super confident about that but then picking the winners there should be
2673.16s: like this insatiable demand by institutions during any kind of market weakness and it should show
2677.40s: up right away with things kind of pop if it doesn't then you can believe all you want but if
2682.92s: if they're not buying I mean they they they'll always know more than we do I mean their problem is
2687.72s: size like if you're managing 500 billion dollars like it's hard to get positioned in anything
2692.84s: but their advantage is that they have better access to information that we you know
2696.84s: stuff we could only dream of you know so they're their footsteps always comes through in the stock
2700.92s: race and then let's say that you see institutional sponsorship kind of the standard canceling stuff
2708.60s: yeah and let's say that you well you tell me if you look at X number of what's the number of stocks
2716.60s: in the top filter that get to like the final selection criteria so I run like a list each week
2723.56s: of always like these are all stocks that I'd be happy to buy and so like that that list is usually
2727.64s: around 50 to 60 days that these are all during care they're not always in this case they're not maybe
2732.52s: all AI there could be some like outliers that are are just like do still growing well and I'll watch
2737.56s: but in my mind I'm trying to honestly just focus on AI type of stuff so it's that 50 60 and then
2742.44s: the others variation sometimes they're they're strengthening but then they'll they'll flare out
2746.36s: and they won't do so well and so they kind of you know you've ignored and again the leaders should
2750.52s: always kind of be obvious they should always be popping up and it should always be hard to buy
2754.36s: it's never easy to buy the best stock you're always kind of wishing you bought it and not a little too
2758.52s: far baby pulls back and and so it's always a little bit tricky so you have to like kind of like
2762.52s: fight your way in so that's kind of so you know you're starting off with thousands of stocks you
2766.44s: bring it out to 50 60 and then it's a matter of this is my list our market conditions a
2770.76s: accommodative yes okay then let's try and find good points where we can manage risk and establish
2775.48s: positions for for uptrends and once you buy you know the strength confirm that you bought it
2781.56s: a good time you know sometimes the market to roll over or you're strong about the stock and then
2785.80s: that's your like your post trade confirmation from performance makes total sense and then when
2793.32s: you're looking at that list do you find yourself in a scenario where you're like a coin flip
2798.52s: I literally could buy either of these and they would both make me happy like do you find that
2804.44s: it could happen sometimes like when there's really a lot of opportunity and so then after like I
2810.04s: tend to if it's that situation I tend to lean to the higher beta stock that's just my personality
2815.24s: you know like if let's say there's meta set up the stitches for example meta and palantir like
2820.12s: my personality is algal for palantir or whatever whatever stock it is that moves a little more because
2826.44s: I get bored with stocks if they move too slowly it's a like it's Spotify like I've been trying to
2831.08s: I've been buying and trading Spotify since probably 200 and I made very little money because I get
2835.72s: in it doesn't do a whole lot I get out and I'll pick off without me if after two or three weeks I don't
2840.12s: get a lot of progress I end up moving it's it's one of my drawbacks I keep trying to work on but
2845.48s: yeah so that's why I find when I when I can time it well and I can get position stock that suits
2849.88s: my personality that's that's my do-yes right yeah and I can totally see that now after this initial
2857.88s: infrastructure wave goes through what general adoption theme around AI are you expecting to be
2866.20s: focusing on after that it's going to be actual products of services like I so if you look at I mean
2872.04s: it's a never ending cycle but if you look at the 90s it's infrastructure product services then you
2877.24s: get another infrastructure wave where things have to be upgraded because the man gets so strong and
2881.40s: all the rest and then there's another wave of new products of services you know like the I you
2885.48s: think of the iPhone is basically as you know still related to the internet it's thanks to you know
2891.00s: you know mobile internet and all the rest that we're able to have that on our phone so for so really
2895.96s: really next it should be actual products and services and it can be tricky because a lot of these
2901.08s: names like they have a lot of potential and so then after they trade a high valuations there tends to
2905.48s: be a lot of like retail interests so they could be very jumpy like a tempest AI for example TEM
2910.44s: very difficult stock to try and trade very choppy very wild but I mean they're trying to apply AI
2916.68s: to like medical diagnostics if they can pull it off tremendous opportunity right but you know
2922.84s: sometimes the stocks are trading at such a premium or they're just they're so closely watched
2926.92s: sometimes there's younger new names that give better opportunities like there's NBIS which we
2931.08s: had a great trade this week that was our position in and I find it's probably not as closely
2936.68s: watch as something like it's TEM so it tends to trade nicer when everyone watches something
2941.48s: gets a little more difficult right looking out over the next handful of months there's still a lot
2950.20s: of stuff that's kind of influx right we see just the employment situation changing slightly we
2956.68s: you know slight uptick and jobless claims and it seems there's just a mix of stuff coming out
2964.28s: how does that impact the way that you're approaching the market currently
2969.80s: yeah I don't really put too much weight into that for me the only the only importance of jobs and
2974.04s: all that is how it impacts like what the Fed's gonna do and not that the Fed controls everything but
2978.44s: the Fed is to me the driver of the markets is liquidity like globally the Fed's one of the big players
2983.88s: the US governments another big player then after it's like you know the private sector of
2987.48s: borrowing lending all that kind of stuff there's a three big pillars you know so that's the only
2992.12s: timeout like I'm not like tracking like oh they beat by you know non-form payrolls by so much
2996.76s: it's a buy for markets it's just trying to understand like most most prints don't really mean
3000.92s: very much to me just a matter of like the day-to-day like management of risk so for me it's just
3005.48s: really kind of trying to follow the different proxies I use for liquidity just to make sure they keep
3010.28s: rising and as long as that happens like you want to be a did by basically every time there's like a pause
3015.32s: if there's no impact to that and so you know the tariffs was you know the tariffs you would think
3021.64s: would be kind of like a negative for liquidity in general probably will be if the Fed doesn't
3027.16s: cut rates or whatnot so this was like the V-shape recovery it's gonna be interesting I really
3031.24s: think it's likely to get a pause here in the markets because of that like I think now we've
3034.84s: been overshot to the upside out of like forced buying I think the only the caveat like if we
3042.52s: didn't have the AI potential behind this bull market which could really lift things tremendously
3048.60s: I think this would be like a really negative setup for markets like retesting old highs you
3052.84s: can go over again quite a bit but I think that people are just kind of really seeing the impact of
3059.64s: what AI will be and that's gonna keep driving I think big tech and big tech has massive impact on
3064.36s: indexes and people are gonna have that fear of missing out of like the technological boom so
3069.80s: and and even for a while like there was all the talk when you know during the tariffs back that
3074.60s: Europe's outperforming is US exceptionalism over and all that like so much of all of the
3080.04s: innovations in the US you know what I mean so I think that was more just like some people who are
3084.36s: frustrated again with the US and they want to kind of move their capital out but long term
3088.76s: you know if there's someone that is inventing autonomous driving or whatever kind of robots or
3093.56s: not that's musk whoever wins those things and even services that we never thought of
3098.52s: probably gonna happen in the US in terms of the Western world maybe China has something I don't know
3103.48s: but so that may provide like a bit under the market so if we pull back at this point I think
3108.84s: it's gonna be a shower pullback but I think we do consolidate a bit and then we're gonna have to
3113.00s: position from there so we're gonna have to see how how things roll out with with Trump and what
3117.64s: headlines come out next week for me it's what comes out over the weekend because I had a time
3124.76s: anytime I have a couple weekend vault trades that I put on that have just been an absolute crap
3130.52s: shoot this year it's either been super lucrative or I'm just super wrong and it's like a coin flip
3137.00s: it's actually super fun because you kind of like just peruse through the news and you're like oh
3142.20s: shit like nothing crazy happened today this is nuts um a couple other questions before you wrap up
3150.92s: what are some of the the proxies that you like to use for liquidity and how
3155.32s: so one as interesting is net highs net lows is one if you look at so there's one indicator I
3161.32s: follow called NFCI so the national financial conditions index the Chicago Fed puts it out
3166.68s: they look at like a hundred indicators in there if you if you kind of plot this NFCI with like net
3173.40s: highs net lows would be amazed at how close the correlations really when liquidity is improving
3179.00s: net highs come into the market so it's a really good like mechanism so it's what's something to
3182.76s: kind of plot and you'll see what I mean uh another one I like to look at are high just a just a quick
3188.52s: note on that like it's not super frequent that I come across stuff like that that I've never even thought
3193.64s: to look at and that's one of them so I'm actually really excited to look at that thank you very
3198.12s: much for mentioning it like that's a cool one so NFCI they measure financial condition so when
3202.92s: the indicator is rising financial conditions are getting tighter right basically if you plot them
3207.08s: together you'll see whenever again the NFCI is declining you go from net lows to net highs whenever
3212.20s: it starts to climb you go from net highs to net lows it's amazing how it's related so it's for
3216.92s: me like when people ask well you know why would that work for me it's get and looks at the stocks but
3221.88s: the stocks are the mechanism for liquidity and if you look at the extremes of highs and lows those
3226.60s: are the best reflectors of liquidity as well so anyways cool thing to look at that's one and
3231.40s: something else I look at very closely is high yield bonds so we look at so that that everyone
3237.08s: looks at the Fed people look at the 10 year yield people look at the 30 year yield for me it's the yield
3241.16s: on high yield bonds with counts because what's cool about them again they're a good they're a good
3245.24s: proxy for liquidity and all the rest because it has the industry component it is a bond but because
3250.44s: it's like a high risk bond it has a risk component to it so if you look even let's say a 2008 or any
3257.00s: other kind of the you know that 2020 anytime there's these severe moves if you're just looking at
3261.08s: interest rates you say like the Fed's cutting race is zero or the 10 years falling this is you know
3265.40s: this is going to support stocks but if you look at high yield bonds the interest rates they're
3269.48s: skyrocketing because of the risk component so always keeping an eye on that to see how that's
3274.52s: shifting and that you know usually any kind of market move that's significant should be confirmed
3279.56s: by like those bonds you can look at the JNK ETF I was just going to ask if that's what you use
3284.68s: yeah there's a there's a really good my favorite one is to index where is it
3290.36s: to get the symbol up in trading view that I bring it up it's a bank of America here is the
3296.52s: ice bank of America US high yield index effective yield and I give you the symbol when it's like a
3303.32s: long symbol yeah I got it this cool yeah that's that's the one that I it doesn't always update real
3308.92s: time but that's my favorite way because you know because the JNK has like dividend distribution
3312.60s: issues and stuff that messes up the chart of it so here if you look at just the actual effective
3316.12s: yield there's a great job of kind of showing that of humans in high yield bonds beautiful super
3323.08s: informative as always you have a lot of stuff to share and definitely the the audience always
3329.00s: appreciate it's I get pretty good feedback yeah the the biggest thing is my my audience is most
3336.28s: interested in my my efforts to convert you deeper into the just the disgusting sloppy world of
3346.52s: retail options trading which it's kind of like I mean America's good at that right like we can
3352.68s: drag somebody into the mud so even though you're in Canada I think I might be able to to keep
3357.72s: dragging you down slowly so that's my intention you know I was trading nonstop for so many
3362.92s: year day trading for me it's like kind of being able to catch my breath I'll be able to go to the
3366.84s: wash without worrying about 300 order to be filled so it's just kind of with pacing myself a little
3371.72s: bit but at some point maybe I'll get back to when the kids get a little older maybe I'll get back
3375.00s: to the hundreds of trades a day you got a show right you're gonna have to show them like yo dad
3381.24s: used to get down and yeah she better believe it all right by the coming the Romans like it's like
3386.76s: oh hey dad it's like it's all green it's a good day today or it's all red or these are doing bad
3390.60s: these are good here I'm like yeah but that old these I don't have those unfortunately but it's good
3395.56s: it's fun it's fun so yeah the kids have the right eye you just don't have the right execution maybe
3400.12s: you just need to start them as an indicator I think that's what's next yeah yeah yeah definitely
3405.08s: definitely beautiful man I'll throw a link to your website below for everybody that wants to go
3409.08s: check you out but as always man thanks for hanging out and looking forward to catching up again
3413.24s: soon anytime man thanks for having me appreciate it yeah
