0.60s: what's up outliers welcome to outlier
2.96s: trading tips where in five minutes or
5.64s: less you will have some knowledge to
8.12s: walk away with today we're going to talk
9.64s: about whether or not options are zero
12.48s: sum this is actually a really important
15.00s: conversation specifically not for the
17.52s: pedantic side of things but for the
19.52s: implications and you'll see what I'm
20.80s: talking about so what is a zero Su
24.64s: system it's a situation in which
27.20s: whatever one entity gain
31.24s: another entity loses so if we think
34.72s: about options in that context let's
37.80s: start with a scenario if I buy a call
43.12s: and the stock goes up the seller loses
46.84s: money so we can visualize this if we go
50.16s: into the platform and we take a look at
53.24s: the selling side of a call they
56.92s: obviously will have lost money so
60.76s: let's now take a look at the implication
65.16s: of a zero sum game the reason why Zero
67.80s: Sum games are so important in the
69.80s: context of their implication is because
72.56s: especially in markets where we're
73.92s: interacting with a lot of really smart
75.64s: entities with a lot of information and a
77.48s: lot of powerful resources if we are
80.44s: playing a true zero sum game then we
84.92s: would be led to believe that the other
87.52s: side of our trade no knows something
90.56s: that we don't otherwise why would they
93.88s: sell the option to us so let's take for
98.44s: example if I knew stock XYZ was going to
102.48s: go up tomorrow I knew it and let's say
106.96s: everybody then knew it same time we all
109.76s: know the Stock's going to go up who
111.56s: would take the other side of that trade
114.76s: nobody because it's a known losing
117.60s: proposition however Market are a little
120.84s: more complex than this so what if this
124.36s: seller Delta hedged their position so
128.04s: let's say as soon as they sold their
129.64s: option they went out and they bought the
132.80s: Delta equivalent of offsetting the
135.56s: Deltas or what if the seller of that
138.48s: option is actually a retail Trader that
141.24s: sold that call against long shares that
144.24s: are already in profit would that also be
148.16s: a consideration now
150.36s: here's the reality when we look at
153.40s: options individual option contracts they
156.32s: absolutely are zero sum meaning one side
159.80s: is going to win one side is going to
161.56s: lose for the contract
163.40s: itself however if we focus too much on
166.16s: that pedantic component of options
168.84s: themselves individual transactions then
171.64s: we lose the true importance of a zero
174.48s: sum system which is again this
176.32s: implication that we talked about here so
179.08s: the reality is options as a practice
183.36s: options trading as a practice is not
185.80s: Zero Sum so let's take a look at this
188.24s: Zero Sum perspective if again I sell
192.16s: this call and in this case Nvidia goes
195.00s: up obviously the trade loses but what if
198.80s: I already have let's say 200 shares of
201.72s: Nvidia and let's say Nvidia goes up do I
205.64s: lose no I made money now again for the
209.32s: general point that option that short
211.76s: call absolutely will have lost but my
214.84s: motivation for putting that short call
217.00s: on might not actually be because I think
220.84s: the stock is going down it could be part
223.52s: of a broader system that I'm trading in
226.12s: this case a ratio covered call and the
227.88s: ratio component of that as you know is
229.68s: very important to not cap the upside
231.96s: potential so going back to this this is
235.24s: the most important part of this
236.52s: conversation the
238.12s: implications the implication of a zero
240.28s: some system is that the counterparty
241.60s: knows something that we don't and we
243.44s: might be stepping in front of a moving
244.72s: train the reality is options are complex
247.56s: systems that typically have additional
249.64s: positions in conjunction with or you can
251.32s: have a market maker for example that is
254.08s: working in a very low friction
255.92s: environment that essentially at the end
258.44s: of the trade even though the option
260.44s: itself might lose they can still walk
262.24s: out at a profit by Delta hedging and
264.28s: capturing the bit ass spread so remember
268.16s: from a pure perspective
270.44s: an individual contract certainly is zero
273.28s: sum but it's important to not get so
275.88s: stuck in a linear line of thought and
278.92s: think a little more broadly around the
280.56s: total system which is not at all Zero
282.44s: Sum so as always any questions let me
284.88s: know be an outlier see you later
