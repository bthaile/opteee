604.16s:  off
605.84s:  off
613.36s:  off
616.40s:  off
626.00s:  If I were to draw this for you so that you can see this here, this essentially is the
635.54s:  main volume node.
637.56s:  And you can see the prices that it's hovering on the 2737 and then the 2663 ish.
647.40s:  And the reason why I highlight that is that's kind of the near term value areas we can see
652.88s:  before it gets all the way down here.
655.32s:  I still struggle to see a world where it would go back down here primarily because it's
662.12s:  in a new financial position.
664.08s:  So I don't actually think this would be highly likely, but again, who actually knows I
672.06s:  don't.
673.50s:  But based on standard analysis, this level here that I have drawn out the 2567, this becomes
680.32s:  the next key level in my opinion, it's kind of falling on the next, like pre-key level,
687.04s:  if there's a pre-key level, it's this bottom of this consolidation area, which extends
692.24s:  over here.
693.24s:  But this would be like the next like true key level in my opinion because this captures
699.04s:  this entire new area that we've seen, this entire new value area, all of this is captured
707.70s:  above here, right?
709.00s:  That's when it's made the last stair step pattern up before it started consolidating sideways,
714.56s:  up, down, right?
715.56s:  Kind of doing standard game stop stuff.
717.72s:  It's all above here.
719.72s:  So that matters to me because if it does start falling below here, then that requires a
727.96s:  bunch of different position adjustments actually from the coverage strangle that I have on
732.52s:  in there now that I've been talking to you guys about a little bit that again, we can
737.08s:  either review or not.
739.72s:  But if it does start flirting with this area here, that doesn't necessitate some changes
745.24s:  for the position.
752.20s:  Thank you for the $1.99 and we got, you feel tingling for bone cone on Tuesday.
763.08s:  I mean, you probably know me well enough by now.
766.88s:  You've given me $1.99 enough time, enough times by now to know that the tingling at least
774.64s:  hasn't, hasn't been there for a little bit.
779.08s:  The reason why I say that is this was very normal standard price behavior.
786.80s:  All of this, this entire run up here, very, very standard price behavior.
790.88s:  It actually, again, it looked really good to me.
792.80s:  I was very, very happy to see that.
795.60s:  Then that down move, that giant red candle that you see there is very abnormal.
802.44s:  That doesn't make a lot of fucking sense.
804.76s:  Normally when you see stuff like this, it's news driven.
808.16s:  Some sort of fundamental change occurs that leads to a change in underlying perception
814.60s:  of value.
816.00s:  There was none of that.
817.44s:  Now this is to reiterate a point that I've mentioned a bunch of times now that a lot of
823.60s:  people seem to struggle with.
825.20s:  But again, this is my opinion that GameStop does not follow standard technical analysis.
834.00s:  It does not follow standard technical analysis.
837.12s:  Standard technical analysis is entirely predicated on assessing supply and demand relationships.
848.52s:  That's the whole point of TA.
851.36s:  It's to assess supply and demand relationships.
855.36s:  There are normal behaviors around those relationships.
860.40s:  We tend to see and can represent those across a larger data set.
865.92s:  GameStop sometimes absolutely will abide by those same norms.
871.48s:  And we've seen it again, like even this move here.
873.56s:  This is abiding by those same norms.
876.24s:  But the reason why I say it doesn't follow standard technical analysis, despite the fact
880.56s:  that frequently I would even argue a majority of the time it does is because the most pivotal
886.80s:  movements that you see in GameStop violate standard supply and demand relationships.
895.20s:  There are structural elements to GameStop that cause different kinds of moves that violate
902.60s:  those norms.
903.60s:  And it's both to the upside and the downside.
906.76s:  So the reason why I say it doesn't follow standard technical analysis because again, even
911.00s:  though it does, and again, I would argue the majority of time is because when it makes
917.72s:  some of its most pivotal moves, it's clearly not following that same suit.
925.76s:  Breakoff point at those key moments is exactly why it doesn't follow standard technical
932.72s:  analysis.
933.72s:  And I've heard time and time again from a bunch of different people like, oh, this person
938.72s:  predicts it really well with TA or that person predicts it really well with TA.
943.52s:  I've not found that yet.
945.88s:  And that's not to say nobody can do it.
948.24s:  I'm not saying that.
949.76s:  But what I am saying is that for something like GameStop, you can apply standard methodology.
957.32s:  I saw exactly zero posts or conjecture that on the 14th, the 14th, which was, what was
968.00s:  that like Tuesday, fucking Tuesday, a Tuesday, a random ass Tuesday that GameStop would
974.72s:  just drop by 10%.
977.64s:  Meanwhile, the underlying index that it's a part of, be it completely differently.
984.44s:  And then you overlay some of the other basket names, something like AMC.
991.52s:  And AMC had a semi-sympathetic move, but still not fully sympathetic move.
1000.04s:  So all of this is to say, when we're conducting analysis on something like GameStop, it is
1009.72s:  so unbelievably important to be really thoughtful about what we're doing and track things carefully.
1016.72s:  Because I notice especially in the ape community, I have observed long enough by now, I feel
1022.84s:  like who's that, who's that British dude that always does like the, the documentaries
1027.84s:  about animals.
1028.84s:  Is it David?
1029.84s:  Yeah, this guy.
1032.52s:  This is the guy.
1033.52s:  I feel like this guy, I feel like this guy kind of watching the ape community from this
1040.00s:  guy's perspective, right?
1041.00s:  Like I'm studying, I feel like I'm studying the apes.
1044.96s:  And I've watched enough and I've seen enough now.
1048.44s:  Holy shit, this dude is 98.
1052.16s:  Fucking shout out to this guy born in 26, bro.
1062.36s:  Holy fuck, that's incredible.
1068.76s:  Shout out to that dude.
1069.76s:  I feel like him when I'm observing the apes.
1073.52s:  And I noticed that a really common thread is that of pattern seeking.
1081.44s:  This is where the human brain is innately programmed to try to identify patterns, right?
1087.12s:  That's normal.
1088.12s:  That's normal behavior.
1089.04s:  What becomes slightly abnormal is when we do our best to interpret everything we see
1097.76s:  and to interpret in a way that supports our underlying ideas, what we want to see and
1104.32s:  stuff like that.
1105.32s:  That's the problem.
1106.72s:  Because we lose objective reality.
1108.28s:  Take this back to the technical analysis thing.
1110.52s:  I've done a ton of research now.
1113.16s:  I feel you guys will probably have noticed a difference in the way that I talk about
1116.56s:  this stuff from when I first started following along the game stop journey to now because I
1122.52s:  am now more confident in some of these things because I'm actually putting in the time.
1127.84s:  I know I'm putting in the time.
1128.84s:  I'm doing the research myself.
1130.48s:  So I'm physically seeing this stuff.
1134.68s:  What's really interesting is I ran a bunch of different studies on standard technical
1141.84s:  analysis in game stop like I would in anything else.
1144.80s:  I observed things like moving averages.
1146.80s:  I observed things like standard deviation channels, volatility, average volumes.
1151.96s:  I did a couple different oscillators.
1154.48s:  So I did RSI because that's my preferred one money flow index, stochastic, MACD.
1162.28s:  I even overlaid candle patterns, which I don't really do that much because I don't care
1167.52s:  that much about them.
1169.52s:  And the predictive value of a lot of things that are predictive in other things don't really
1176.16s:  translate well to this.
1178.20s:  So all of this is to come to a cautionary note.
1183.36s:  It's totally cool to be optimistic.
1186.04s:  It's totally cool to want to see something.
1188.80s:  It's totally cool to analyze things and look for trends.
1192.32s:  What becomes really dangerous is if we have such a selection bias in terms of what data
1197.68s:  points we will on board and remember versus what data points get shoved out.
1204.52s:  And the only thing that does is hurt you.
1206.48s:  It hurts you as an investor and a trader.
1209.00s:  So as an investor, this shit's easy for you, right?
1211.60s:  As an investor, it's just buy hold, buy hold, buy more hold, buy more and hold more,
1215.64s:  right?
1216.64s:  And investors perspective, this shit's as easy as it gets.
1219.40s:  But from a trader's perspective, it's completely different because we're trying to make money
1224.40s:  on a lot more of the movements, the micro movements that are happening.
1229.20s:  And you have to have a really, really effective analysis approach in order to be able to do
1233.32s:  that.
1234.32s:  Okay.
1235.32s:  Coffee Donuts says Susan Trimbet has done a few videos with Josh from the gist on YouTube
1241.96s:  by genuinely have no idea who that is.
1245.52s:  The stuff that I've seen from Susan, I think I saw one video with her.
1250.84s:  And then I think we came across her in the DD library.
1253.36s:  I was actually curious if we're going to come across more of her stuff as we go through
1256.28s:  it today.
1257.44s:  But I already looked at her work before and it looks cool to me.
1261.64s:  Like I, and again, I'm pretty sure that we'll be able to line up because it looks like
1267.16s:  her stuff is really interesting.
1273.60s:  And I'm wondering, especially with some of the new up and comences with like Chicago,
1279.80s:  change and whatnot, how she thinks some of the underlying market structure components
1285.76s:  are trending because I like, I literally am curious what, what her opinion is.
1290.00s:  So yeah, we'll definitely see if we can get lined up with her.
1294.44s:  Brad says, did you hear about the reverse repo?
1296.80s:  In terms of what?
1297.80s:  That's super, super broad.
1299.12s:  The reverse repo in general, reverse repo market is pretty expansive.
1304.68s:  I would need a little more context than that in order for me to respond back at least
1310.28s:  with anything useful.
1312.12s:  All right.
1315.36s:  Let's now, let's get into some homework.
1320.72s:  Shall we?
1321.72s:  It's been a little while.
1326.00s:  Right now what I'm doing is I'm just grabbing another tab with chat GPT because we probably
1332.32s:  will need that.
1334.40s:  And let's run through what we saw in GameStop last week.
1339.52s:  We saw a really significant pullback and I read it, I read it at the point that this
1346.96s:  pullback is seemingly not driven by anything.
1351.48s:  It's nothing that I can clearly discern.
1354.24s:  So what that then tells us is we need to take a peek at some of the underlying factors.
1361.36s:  One of the underlying factors I was curious about is if we take a look at GameStop and
1367.68s:  we take a look at insider transactions, which we know is actually really small, right?
1376.72s:  There's just every time that you see some sort of movement in here, it's not incredible.
1382.88s:  But there were some insider transactions here.
1386.68s:  So if you look at the sixth, we can see that two different entities were unwinding not
1395.04s:  huge positions, but some.
1398.36s:  So there's a bit of an unwind on some of these, but there wasn't anything that stuck out
1404.56s:  to me massively so.
1406.32s:  But it was two of them on the sixth around a similar time, which is kind of interesting.
1411.36s:  So we see two different groups here, Daniel Moore and Haymond, these two folks.
1419.76s:  So I thought that was interesting.
1422.96s:  Now that aside though, there wasn't anything else that I was like, yeah, okay, this is a
1428.76s:  really, really big change going on in here from like an insider's perspective.
1433.04s:  So then the next perspective we have to take a look at is an institutional ownership.
1437.80s:  So GME institutional ownership change.
1444.04s:  And let's see.
1453.24s:  This one's from Fintel.
1456.52s:  And if anything, it looks like expansion in sponsorship, right?
1464.60s:  As far as we can tell, for institutional ownership.
1468.08s:  So nothing really jumping out at me from this perspective.
1473.80s:  So as I looked through and try to find any semblance, any semblance of rationale, and when I say
1480.08s:  rationale, it doesn't mean like it has to be a good reason.
1483.60s:  But again, normally when we see moves like this, it's tied to fucking something.
1489.88s:  And what I can tell you is this is tied to something.
1492.80s:  I just can't tell what.
1494.72s:  And it's a lot of the standard.
1497.88s:  Some things that this might be tied to are not applying here.
1504.28s:  So I really, really struggled the other thing I had.
1508.44s:  And let's see if we run it really quick.
1511.16s:  I asked Chatship to essentially summarize all news related to GameStop and GameStop style
1518.00s:  stocks like it's peers on the 14th.
1522.44s:  So scour the internet for any news related to GameStop, GameStop peers, GameStop industry,
1539.20s:  or anything else that could in any way impact the price of GameStop specifically on 14
1552.40s:  Jan 25.
1558.76s:  Let's see.
1561.76s:  Okay, so we just, we just caught one of them ourselves.
1571.12s:  Right?
1572.12s:  So one of the things that we just caught ourselves, and this is from Chatship.
1576.08s:  T, this is actually interesting because I didn't ask it this before.
1579.08s:  But the first thing that I popped up with is on 14 Jan GameStop experiences 6% decline
1584.16s:  is actually 10% it, not enough.
1588.00s:  But it says this downturn coincided with insider trading activities, notably the sale of 1577
1593.96s:  shares by general council Mark Hamman Robinson on January three, which again, I'm pretty sure
1598.80s:  January six based on Banzanga, but same, same.
1601.96s:  Such insider transactions can sometimes impact investor confidence in stock performance.
1605.76s:  So that can be a thing.
1607.24s:  Here's the problem.
1608.60s:  That first was released on like the fucking sixth here.
1612.32s:  It's like several days after.
1614.20s:  So I don't buy it.
1616.64s:  The next one that I've heard come up a bunch of times were the store closures.
1623.04s:  So this is from the 12th.
1627.88s:  And the summary here says reports indicated that GameStop quietly closed the significant
1634.64s:  number of US stores after the holiday season, including locations in in McMindville or
1641.12s:  again Vancouver, Washington.
1644.08s:  The company has not released an official statement regarding these closures.
1648.80s:  Okay.
1650.20s:  So let's see the total impact potentially of said closures.
1657.00s:  This is again from the 13th.
1660.84s:  150 locations closed 10 in the Pacific Northwest, not even through the first month, the 25 store
1666.40s:  closes keep coming.
1669.44s:  Let's see.
1671.92s:  The injury of dissolving the cat.
1676.48s:  Shording.
1679.76s:  We know that they're closing stores.
1688.28s:  We know that the majority of these closures happen in 24.
1710.08s:  So it's like again, I don't think that this is not part of that equation, but this still
1717.04s:  doesn't explain the movement that I saw.
1719.40s:  It just doesn't explain it.
1721.44s:  So I would consider this a contributing factor, but I can't clearly with a logical mind say,
1728.20s:  oh yeah, this is what caused the 10% dip.
1731.04s:  It just don't see that.
1733.96s:  Now another thing that a lot of times people want to speculate, which is again, that's
1740.88s:  how we find shit out.
1742.12s:  I think it's good to speculate.
1743.88s:  But another thing that I see people talking about with game stop specifically is the fact
1752.24s:  that there's not been any significant updates from leadership regarding like what they're
1760.00s:  going to do, right?
1762.80s:  And it's a completely fair question, but that question in and of itself, I still don't
1769.56s:  think leads to a 10% decline.
1771.84s:  Again, to go back to standard standard technical analysis, standard behavior of equities, especially
1779.24s:  because game stops not even a small cap stock technically anymore.
1782.80s:  It's like a mid cap stock.
1784.40s:  What is the market cap?
1786.36s:  What is actually game stops market cap right now?
1788.28s:  Because I know that they have a bunch in cash, but I don't know what their actual market
1794.52s:  cap is.
1795.68s:  It's definitely over four billion and mid cap, mid cap stocks are two to 10.
1800.36s:  Wait, Joseph's 12 billion.
1803.12s:  Is it really, I didn't realize it was 12 billion.
1805.60s:  That's crazy.
1807.64s:  That's absolutely crazy.
1808.64s:  So then by all definitions, that's technically a large cap stock.
1813.84s:  So back to the point, mid cap, large cap, close, close.
1818.52s:  The main thing is companies of those sides don't tend to have 10% days.
1822.76s:  It's a very, very big cap stock.
1823.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1824.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1825.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1826.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1827.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1828.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1829.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1830.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1831.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1832.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1833.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1834.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1835.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1836.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1837.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1838.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1839.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1840.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1841.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1842.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1843.76s:  It's a very big cap stock.
1852.76s:  I have no dots to connect here.
1854.76s:  And I can't find the fucking dots.
1856.76s:  Which is another thing that is continually so interesting.
1862.76s:  How game stop?
1863.76s:  There is shit going on here that typically you can explain
1867.76s:  by something and there's fucking nothing here.
1873.76s:  That's bizarre.
1875.76s:  It's interesting, but it's bizarre.
1878.76s:  Okay.
1879.76s:  Now, that's the facade.
1881.76s:  Let's take a look at the options chain really quick.
1883.76s:  And then let me grab the workbook.
1887.76s:  I will grab the coverage strangle stuff so that we can take a look at this for the position.
1896.76s:  Because there is even if we don't run through the positions too much,
1899.76s:  I do want to ask you a couple of questions about the position that we that we have.
1905.76s:  Coffee says, how can they eek out a profit with less stores and no marketing to get people to buy on the e-commerce?
1910.76s:  Well, they eaked out a profit just literally because of interest.
1915.76s:  That's it.
1916.76s:  If they didn't have four billion in cash which does yield,
1921.76s:  but not especially for a company of that size,
1924.76s:  a not significant amount of interest.
1929.76s:  So that's literally the, there's like straight up the only reason.
1932.76s:  If they didn't have that cash, it would have been negative.
1936.76s:  So, and I think again, that's people know that there's nothing novel there.
1943.76s:  Here is one of the larger expiration cycles that we've seen.
1949.76s:  Huge expiration cycle that we've seen.
1953.76s:  We can see that.
1955.76s:  Now, total call, oh, I is 459.
1960.76s:  And we can see put, oh, I is 157.
1963.76s:  There we light.
1965.76s:  So that front expiration took out literally like 500,000 calls gone.
1972.76s:  Massive expiration cycle.
1975.76s:  And if we take a look now to figure out where is everybody positioning,
1978.76s:  you can tell that again, we're not playing the game of really near term positioning.
1985.76s:  The next primary expiration is 21 feb.
1989.76s:  That's this yellow color that you see here.
1992.76s:  If you'll notice that yellow color is quite dominant.
1996.76s:  There's a little bit of the orange going on.
1998.76s:  But if we take a look at that yellow color of that 415 change,
2002.76s:  there's 73 K there, 65 K in the front expiration.
2006.76s:  31, no, I'm sorry, 61 in 31 Jan.
2011.76s:  So two weeks out, seven feb is super light at 26 K.
2014.76s:  This is all calls.
2017.76s:  14 feb is 11, 21 still is the dominant expiration cycle that we can see.
2023.76s:  Next, close.
2024.76s:  This is 17 April.
2026.76s:  17 April is another primary expiration cycle.
2028.76s:  So that will tend to be a little bit busier.
2030.76s:  20 June.
2031.76s:  The thing I want you to notice is that a lot of times when game stop has these really big short term movements,
2038.76s:  you tend to see a lot of short term positioning and options.
2041.76s:  We do not see that here.
2043.76s:  Because we see that again, if we look at the 24 Jan expiration, it's like 65 C6 K.
2048.76s:  We find a bunch of different explorations now with that same amount of open interest,
2055.76s:  specifically on the call side.
2057.76s:  That's relevant because it tells us that the market is not overly positioning for a specific movement in a specific time frame.
2065.76s:  It's almost spread, not evenly, but it's distributed pretty well across all these different explorations.
2072.76s:  The other thing is volatility is now very, very low.
2076.76s:  The market is absolutely eyeballing something in seven feb.
2080.76s:  Is that maybe, no, it's not when their earnings is.
2083.76s:  What happens in seven feb?
2085.76s:  You guys know?
2088.76s:  That week, sorry, to clarify, it doesn't have to be on seven feb, but the week of seven feb.
2093.76s:  Because that's a big enough variance in the ball surface that the market's pricing something there.
2098.76s:  I don't know what it is though.
2101.76s:  But it's pricing something on this week.
2104.76s:  I can't tell what.
2106.76s:  Let's take a look at the implied volatility though.
2109.76s:  Let's take a look for the out of the monies.
2111.76s:  Let's go to seven feb.
2113.76s:  It's on the put side.
2114.76s:  So there's heavy putski.
2116.76s:  What I'm showing you literally is just options detective work.
2119.76s:  I doing this from a trader's perspective is how I identify a lot of trading opportunities.
2128.76s:  Now, from a trader's perspective, you don't have to be able to explain everything.
2131.76s:  You'll never be able to explain everything.
2133.76s:  But I can see stuff.
2134.76s:  It's pretty easy for me to see.
2136.76s:  So, yeah, seven feb, something's going on on the put side in terms of where they're pricing vol.
2144.76s:  However, yeah, it's like really, really put heavy on a comparative basis.
2153.76s:  It's actually favoring a downside move.
2156.76s:  And seven feb.
2158.76s:  So something weird going on there.
2161.76s:  Hands can't really tell what.
2165.76s:  Take a look again here.
2173.76s:  Yeah.
2179.76s:  Interesting.
2181.76s:  So definitely a downside skew.
2184.76s:  In that seven feb expiration.
2187.76s:  But do we have any idea?
2190.76s:  Coffee says funny watching Eric see the abnormalities in GME.
2194.76s:  I've been here since 21.
2195.76s:  Well, the funny thing is is like.
2198.76s:  GME is.
2200.76s:  Interesting, but it's not the first to do all of this stuff.
2203.76s:  I can't tell you how many tickers that I've explored and have seen have had very interesting movements.
2209.76s:  Now, there's some qualifying levels to GameStop that make GameStop a little bit interesting.
2214.76s:  Specifically at size now again, you can find movements like this actually pretty regularly in smaller companies that have less news coverage and stuff like that.
2222.76s:  Information to screen is a really big factor in terms of how things get priced in and how efficiently.
2229.76s:  But something like GameStop with as much coverage as it has.
2232.76s:  And the overall size definitely there's some things that stick out in a pretty big way.
2239.76s:  Coffee says earnings in March, nothing in fab.
2243.76s:  Interesting.
2245.76s:  Because this is saying something's going on in fab.
2248.76s:  I don't know what.
2250.76s:  Let's see if Chachupy Tinos.
2252.76s:  Is there anything going on or expected.
2261.76s:  During the trading week ending.
2266.76s:  On seven fab.
2268.76s:  That is.
2273.76s:  That might impact Jimmy's price.
2279.76s:  Being elevated volatility.
2284.76s:  In that cycle.
2296.76s:  Yeah.
2301.76s:  Not seeing.
2304.76s:  Chachupy T's not returning anything.
2306.76s:  It's not saying that it sees anything specific.
2309.76s:  The GameStop either.
2311.76s:  Which is really interesting.
2314.76s:  Terp Strasse says a lot of people think there will be a recoil by 28 Jan.
2320.76s:  Why 28 Jan.
2325.76s:  What's the.
2327.76s:  What's the thesis behind that?
2329.76s:  Can you guys.
2330.76s:  Can you guys direct me?
2331.76s:  I'd love to take a look at that.
2333.76s:  Are there any posts or anything that I could take a look at related to that.
2343.76s:  Because I'm.
2344.76s:  I'm very, very interested in that.
2346.76s:  Oh, yeah.
2347.76s:  I got to.
2348.76s:  Make sure I say hello to Newton.
2350.76s:  Every time I do these, I like to.
2352.76s:  Say hello to Newton.
2354.76s:  What's up, boy?
2357.76s:  Got out from the GME.
2361.76s:  Dream.
2362.76s:  Thinking of you.
2364.76s:  You and I were talking about options.
2366.76s:  He's a big fan of options.
2367.76s:  Now it's awesome.
2368.76s:  I'm such a big fan.
2376.76s:  Okay.
2382.76s:  I think it's because there's probably.
2387.76s:  From an institutional perspective, it starts to become an interesting play from a pod.
2391.76s:  It's perspective.
2392.76s:  You have a company that's got a.
2396.76s:  Pretty significant pile of cash.
2399.76s:  That has a really loyal fan base.
2401.76s:  So that provides a pretty reasonable springboard.
2404.76s:  In order to make a move of some sort.
2408.76s:  If the company can redefine itself.
2410.76s:  It's also sitting on a bunch of cash.
2412.76s:  The reason why that matters is because, again, from a pod.
2415.76s:  It's perspective, just kind of playing probabilities.
2418.76s:  We would probably.
2420.76s:  Surmised that the downside might be a little bit more limited because the current state is already so priced in.
2425.76s:  But then the possibility for new news of some kind to come out and to surge stock prices not insignificant.
2432.76s:  That's the idea of let's say GameStop comes out and they say that they're buying Bitcoin.
2437.76s:  I know a lot of people really want to see that.
2439.76s:  I don't really share that perspective, but if it does happen cool.
2444.76s:  And.
2445.76s:  From that.
2446.76s:  From that perspective, though, that can send the price.
2451.76s:  Just skyrocketing, at least in the short term.
2453.76s:  So people are probably.
2455.76s:  Looking to capitalize on some of that.
2459.76s:  Gabe says I wonder if there could be a T 35 and Fed is that what it is.
2463.76s:  I just.
2464.76s:  I'm curious where the the sequel is.
2467.76s:  Or like where the.
2470.76s:  Why why.
2471.76s:  Where did that day come from the end of Jan the the requal potentially happening then I just want to be able to actually take a look at it and analyze it a little bit.
2485.76s:  But because I yeah, I like to look at the source materials if possible.
2491.76s:  All right, so that's looking at the options.
2493.76s:  It's it's pretty mellow in there.
2495.76s:  And we'll do.
2499.76s:  What do we want to do next?
2501.76s:  Do we want to do a quick position update or do you guys prefer that in a separate video and then we just go straight into the DD library?
2507.76s:  Let me know.
2509.76s:  Coffee says new and retired from his job after you taught him options.
2512.76s:  He hasn't retired yet, but he's planning on retiring this year, which is going to be really cool.
2517.76s:  Yeah, the only thing that makes me a little nervous for him is that he.
2521.76s:  He said the magic words that always make me concerned for traders when he he is just like, yeah, it's like a you know an infinite money machine.
2530.76s:  That's that's not what it is.
2533.76s:  So I definitely don't want to see that potential issue coming up, but yeah.
2540.76s:  Lauren says maybe because everyone was saying that the chart looks similar to 21.
2546.76s:  That's still so interesting to me because we spent a lot of time last weekend looking at that.
2552.76s:  And the reality that it that it does not look very similar to 21.
2558.76s:  So it's really surprising to me that people are still potentially on that thread of I think this looks like 2021.
2565.76s:  That looks like pattern seeking to me in my opinion.
2568.76s:  That's not saying that it looks completely disparate, but it does not look the same.
2575.76s:  Yeah.
2579.76s:  The good thing is that we have a point of control here at 25.
2585.76s:  So there's a lot of volume there at 25.
2590.76s:  Gabe says could be swaps annual rolling.
2593.76s:  I don't think so.
2594.76s:  Again, I think people are.
2597.76s:  I think people see swaps and they were starting it's almost like it's almost like old.
2604.76s:  This is what it reminds me of.
2607.76s:  It reminds me of old civilizations, right?
2610.76s:  Old civilizations that couldn't explain things through reason and through scientific method because they didn't have the, you know, the understanding or the materials or.
2622.76s:  The process to test stuff we would chalk things up to different kinds of deities or we could say that it's bad luck or you know a bunch of different things when we don't know how to describe something we tend to then lean on other things as an explanation for it.
2642.76s:  So I don't think swaps have quite as big of an impact as people tend to think it is.
2652.76s:  At least as far as we can see because we've looked, we've looked pretty comprehensively at the swap data and again, what I do is I don't say like I think this is what it is.
2665.76s:  Let me try and see and prove that this is the case.
2670.76s:  What I say is based on all the swap data that I have, can I regress anything that shows any sort of defined relationship between price movement and swaps coming up on expiration.
2684.76s:  Then we get more scalpel we say, okay, well, there's different kinds of swaps.
2688.76s:  Maybe if I segment by types of swaps, maybe there's certain kinds of swaps that will correspond with different price movements and stuff like that.
2697.76s:  And I just don't see it.
2699.76s:  So yeah, the idea of swaps, I do think that they fit into the broader conversation here somewhere, but I don't think it's the Huckleberry.
2712.76s:  I don't think that that's as dominant of a component as people might think that it is.
2719.76s:  Let me get rid of this.
2727.76s:  All right.
2732.76s:  Just seeing if anything else sticks out to me here not much.
2736.76s:  Oh, one thing that did happen was.
2750.76s:  I don't know if you guys have dogs, but sometimes my dog just likes to sit there and like chew his foot.
2764.76s:  I don't really understand why.
2768.76s:  I've been like, let me just chew on my foot for a little bit.
2773.76s:  It's a strange, a strange sensation.
2780.76s:  All right.
2781.76s:  I'm going to get my watch plugged into charge while we're sitting here and we'll start running through this DD library.
2787.76s:  We'll see what's up.
2793.76s:  Okay.
2797.76s:  Hagel says too many people in GME just throwing around theories when the stock, when this stock is never normal.
2803.76s:  Yeah, it's that I really do think that there's some some truth to that.
2808.76s:  And we've talked about that before.
2809.76s:  I actually think some of it is not like damaging.
2813.76s:  That's kind of dramatic, but I do think some of it is not in the best interest of like the community writ large because it unfortunately.
2825.76s:  There are a lot of people.
2828.76s:  There are a lot of people that are a little bit more lay and they're more willing to accept things at face value, especially if they're not scrutinous.
2839.76s:  And I don't think that there's an insignificant number of people that place trades based on stuff like that based on the trust me, bro.
2847.76s:  And it's their own money. They should do whatever they want. And it's their own fault.
2851.76s:  But I do think that it starts to lead people unnecessarily down the wrong path.
2858.76s:  Again, my two cents.
2861.76s:  I think a lot of people are a little too.
2865.76s:  There are a little too eager to try to be the person that predict something and crack some sort of code.
2872.76s:  And I just don't think that it's healthy for the other people that are trying to follow along with this thing and might be influenced by that stuff.
2882.76s:  Now again, I don't like going down the path of like trying to protect people against themselves.
2888.76s:  It's like their own choice. So if somebody wants to read a trust me, bro, thing on Reddit and then place trades because of it, then I mean, that's on them.
2895.76s:  That's that's their own bag entirely.
2897.76s:  It's their right to be able to do that.
2899.76s:  But yeah, I just think it models.
2903.76s:  Models things a little bit more.
2907.76s:  Gregory says, do you have data or knowledge on why we ran in May and June?
2911.76s:  I know you have discussed this. Probably just want to know what you thought about those two spikes in GameStop.
2915.76s:  Well, yeah, that's in this year. This was a, this is a squeeze. Like that's exactly what this is.
2921.76s:  This is a squeeze.
2923.76s:  And then this is partially from earnings, but then this is also partially another squeeze.
2930.76s:  So these are people that are off sides and shorts starting to cover at these levels originally.
2938.76s:  There wasn't an abundance of shares around yet.
2942.76s:  So that meant it was still a little more difficult to access shares to cover.
2951.76s:  But we could see options positioning happening way back here, even before the cat dropped his shit.
2958.76s:  Once the cat dropped his stuff, everything went parabolic.
2962.76s:  And the reason for that is because a big thing that smooths out volatility in markets is even when you see really big orders come through.
2971.76s:  You don't know who it is.
2973.76s:  You don't know who it is or why they're doing it.
2975.76s:  But when somebody displays of really big position like he did, now you kind of fucking know why he's doing it.
2983.76s:  And that can cause a lot of jitters in the broader market because of now we know there's an option holder that has access to a bunch of shares potentially.
2994.76s:  And that can cause short-term movement, short-term pain.
2998.76s:  So that's a lot of people that are just looking to exit out of their position so that they don't get stuck in that if you know they're trading it from the short side of things.
3006.76s:  So yeah, these are literally just short squeezes.
3009.76s:  And I know again for a lot of people, you know, this isn't Moas, this isn't like the squeeze or whatever you want to call it, but like these are unequivocally short squeezes.
3018.76s:  And there might be a gamma squeeze element to it.
3024.76s:  I think that that is definitely part of it.
3029.76s:  But yeah, I think that this is overall a short squeeze probably coupled again with some aspects of a gamma squeeze.
3041.76s:  All right.
3045.76s:  So let's get into some of this and then I'll just do the like update video on the position just because I think that's probably less interesting to people then going through this stuff.
3059.76s:  Okay.
3061.76s:  So this is with Carl Hagberg.
3067.76s:  I don't know Carl Hagberg.
3071.76s:  Who's Carl Hagberg.
3085.76s:  Okay, here we go.
3088.76s:  Dr. T's book.
3096.76s:  Okay, so literally just like completely.
3100.76s:  Okay, cool. We're still on the screen just like crashed entirely.
3109.76s:  Okay.
3112.76s:  Gregory says been burned on call credit spreads for years. So just waiting on wait CCS call credit spread or something else.
3121.76s:  You mean the ticker.
3134.76s:  Who is okay, let me go through this.
3139.76s:  All right, 50 years of experience transfer agency distribution tabulation.
3145.76s:  Propsi adjudication services.
3150.76s:  What's the elections. Wait, what is this have to do with?
3157.76s:  Okay.
3159.76s:  Shareholder rights and corporate governance. Okay, cool. That's super, super helpful.
3168.76s:  All right.
3184.76s:  I'm just getting into the part where like they're talking about current stuff.
3190.76s:  I got to pop the door for real quick.
3204.76s:  Oh, you guys CCS is that's crazy work for covered calls.
3210.76s:  Everybody would just say CC nuts.
3215.76s:  All right, back to this explains the college dropout to young.
3220.76s:  Yeah, okay, I don't care about all this stuff to be honest. I want to see.
3226.76s:  The like his conclusions with respect to this thing.
3231.76s:  Wasn't messed democracy share ownership democratized.
3239.76s:  Okay.
3243.76s:  Keep up with the paperwork.
3252.76s:  Okay.
3258.76s:  I just want to open crease and volume.
3261.76s:  Just try not to understand like the the key takeaways here. I'm not really seeing a lot so far.
3275.76s:  Okay.
3281.76s:  I'm in order to solve the paper crisis. Carle and legman like him went out took surveys and try to find solutions. All right. Let's see.
3291.76s:  I've involved in shareholder meetings. New long to.
3296.76s:  Much in here.
3304.76s:  Okay.
3306.76s:  I think that's good.
3311.76s:  I think that's good.
3316.76s:  All right.
3320.76s:  Always short sellers.
3324.76s:  As long as I can remember.
3328.76s:  Literally vulture capitalists.
3332.76s:  I think they can then try to drive them down to zero.
3337.76s:  Now, I do. I don't fully agree with this.
3342.76s:  Because I genuinely don't believe all short sellers are trying to do this.
3349.76s:  I think there are different kinds of short sellers. I think there are short sellers that would be open and receptive to something like.
3360.76s:  I don't I just don't think it's fair to bucket all short sellers like this short sellers.
3366.76s:  Do you play a role in the market? I don't like short selling to be clear.
3370.76s:  I generally if I'm trading something to the downside, it's with options.
3375.76s:  But I there are still there's still a purpose for them. Right.
3381.76s:  So even if you think about vultures, there is a purpose for vultures in the just circle of life.
3388.76s:  So I wouldn't really consider them this necessarily.
3395.76s:  But I see its point. I think the main thing I'm trying to flag here is that this is what Carl is describing.
3402.76s:  I would argue is like a subset of short sellers.
3407.76s:  I don't think that that's descriptive of all short sellers in general.
3414.76s:  Okay. So they could sell why there's still life in them then buy them back.
3421.76s:  Okay.
3429.76s:  Um.
3436.76s:  So shareholder meeting had millions of shares outstanding.
3440.76s:  We got votes of a million and a half shares.
3443.76s:  It's because of short selling. You don't even have to have naked short selling.
3447.76s:  I grew with that.
3449.76s:  I'll try to explain in very simple terms that you'll have a meeting.
3452.76s:  There are 50% more votes than there are shares outstanding.
3455.76s:  And if you subtract the ones that are held by management and long term mutual funds.
3460.76s:  Really more like three times the number of shares that are held by real people.
3466.76s:  So we're trying to get to the bottom of this and trying to figure out how do you stop this?
3469.76s:  How do you reconcile this? Well, the fact of the matter is even when you're when you're not naked.
3473.76s:  When you borrow the shares and say, okay, I've set more shares the size of the lender keeps his vote.
3478.76s:  He's still the owner. Okay.
3480.76s:  He's only lent them.
3482.76s:  Like if I lent you a shovel, I'm still the owner.
3484.76s:  Yep.
3485.76s:  And I still get my voting whites.
3487.76s:  Meanwhile, if a short seller actually sells.
3489.76s:  Well, the law of economics say that you cannot have a seller without a buyer.
3493.76s:  Okay.
3495.76s:  I see.
3497.76s:  So what's happened is you say, all right, I'm going to repay the loan where you now have to go into the market and buy the shares, close the deal.
3504.76s:  You got what are known as phantom shares.
3507.76s:  So when you have an excessive sellers, as we've seen in GameStop.
3511.76s:  And you have a finite universe of buyers.
3514.76s:  The debits don't equal the credits anymore.
3516.76s:  Yep.
3517.76s:  So that creates a decoupling fully fully agree here.
3524.76s:  Sometimes the votes are two and a half or three times this.
3527.76s:  Yep.
3528.76s:  And I agree.
3529.76s:  Like that is a problem completely agree.
3531.76s:  Okay.
3532.76s:  Infinite liquidity cheat code.
3533.76s:  This is interesting.
3535.76s:  Sometimes they're doing this with mallocin fourth thought they're looking to drive the company down to zero or they can short sell at 50 drive price down to one or two.
3544.76s:  When you have unfettered securities lending.
3546.76s:  Okay.
3547.76s:  People can just keep lending to you when you can keep doing more deals.
3551.76s:  And then you can just keep borrowing more shares to buyers.
3553.76s:  You've downloaded the voting power and you've downloaded the apparent liquidity for that stock.
3556.76s:  Okay.
3557.76s:  Because what you have is infinite liquidity.
3559.76s:  You can just keep borrowing more and borrow against what you borrowed.
3563.76s:  Okay.
3565.76s:  So when the time that this is so clearly out of control.
3569.76s:  I have to hand it to the CEO of over stock.com.
3572.76s:  That's how I met Dr. T and how I met West Christian.
3576.76s:  Who's prominent highly successful lawyer in this field.
3579.76s:  We're all outraged and we're like wait a minute how can this possibly happen.
3584.76s:  The short sellers sometimes they actually have believed that the company is just a bag of feathers.
3589.76s:  But sometimes they just exercise their first amendment rights and spread rumors.
3593.76s:  And when you see the stock price go down the rumors seem to be true.
3596.76s:  And people act as if they are true and that's how stocks go to zero.
3604.76s:  And I don't agree with this fully.
3610.76s:  The reason why I don't agree with this fully is because of.
3616.76s:  New information and information availability.
3620.76s:  The reason why I say that is because.
3624.76s:  If all it takes is a couple rumors essentially to send a stock down to zero.
3629.76s:  That completely skims over the fact that you have to have a company.
3635.76s:  That is not doing well for some reason or another.
3639.76s:  And from a fundamental perspective doesn't look good.
3642.76s:  Because even if there's some ugly rumors milling about.
3648.76s:  That doesn't inherently send stock down to zero because there will be people at some point.
3654.76s:  That say stock XYZ yeah there you know CEO did some sleaze back things however.
3664.76s:  However the stocks been pushed down enough and I actually think it's at a good value now compared to the current price so I'm going to buy it here.
3673.76s:  It's a great example of what happened in GameStop.
3676.76s:  He says Hindenburg built a business on ugly rumors.
3680.76s:  Yeah I actually don't agree with that either I don't think that they've necessarily built a business on ugly rumors and I don't know Hindenburg research we've just done like a cursory overview.
3690.76s:  But what I can tell you is based on some of the prior names that we looked up for them.
3695.76s:  It looks like to a degree some of what they do I can't speak holistically because I don't know all that what they do but some of what they do from elements that I've seen they're literally.
3705.76s:  They're like detectives some short sellers to zoom out from Hindenburg but some short sellers literally act as a detective style arm that go deeper and focus on something so Hindenburg for example with some of the stuff that they did on Carvana as you're reading through it I can actually corroborate some of it with what I see happening from earnings releases happening from management meetings.
3734.76s:  Like I can see some of those things.
3738.76s:  So yeah it's like I'm not advocating for them and I'm not saying that they're not doing anything that they don't do ugly rumors or anything like that I don't know those elements but I just don't think it's fair again to bubble up what they do to saying they do ugly rumors that's their business because again if that's all it was predicated on people would buy it.
3764.76s:  If I knew for example a company like Hindenburg when they put out a report of some sort and I know that it's just hot air that I know it's nothing that I know that the company's fine and I know that this short seller who has a position because we know they have a position before they put out the report and they put out the report and I know the reporters bullshit guess what that tells me.
3786.76s:  It tells me that if I buy it because everything that they're saying I know is bullshit and it's just hot air I know that there's a short seller on the other side of that so I know if I start buying it and it moves enough against their position that starts literally to cause a short squeeze they now have to buy to cover which will drive the price up even more so all I'm trying to elucidate here is that I'm trying to get a
3816.76s:  short seller is inherently are not just this bucket of bad people that are spreading bad rumors and that's all they're doing there's more to it than that that's all I'm not saying that they don't do that I'm sure some of them do and I'm sure elements of them are predatory I'm sure some of them engage in seller boxing like we know that's the case.
3837.76s:  I just don't think it's good broad generalizations because we lose some of the really important nuance that we probably should maintain so same thing here I don't think that's the main thing I don't I don't align with is I don't think just spreading rumors is what will start to cause the stock to go down that has to be backed by something underlying that looks valid otherwise it wouldn't it wouldn't go.
3867.76s:  A great example of this is what Michael sailor with Bitcoin he's been saying that it's going to go up to like all these crazy numbers and all these really interesting time frames and it continues to not fucking do that and that's because broader market consensus is saying okay well I like Bitcoin it's good but maybe adoption is a little bit slower regulation isn't exactly where it needs to be so on and so forth so then it's not like this just surging at.
3897.76s:  I said because of what this dude says there's still market participants that help normalize price.
3904.76s:  Okay.
3907.76s:  Supplying to man out the window many companies will be not because the share price stripe but when it dropped they couldn't borrow any money and when they couldn't sell anymore stock the credit rating was ruined yep that's fair.
3923.76s:  I need to text me real quick if she is a dinner preference before you know it good businesses literally have to fold they just went bankrupt they couldn't afford their business anymore.
3941.76s:  The only thing I would question here is I don't see how we could objectively call them good businesses if this happens.
3959.76s:  But yeah they just want bankrupt couldn't afford okay so that's you started to pay a little bit of attention but I must tell you back in 2000s and from that time till now they have terror about crack record so they passed reg show which we all know about put a bandaid on things.
3974.76s:  Quite a down for a bit.
3979.76s:  Oh nine short sellers again tremendous profits guess what instances where many of these firms were destined for failure but they in a push down the drain twice is fast by everyone giving up on them and selling short.
3990.76s:  The C woke up again says maybe we need to look again have this little thing only a minute to read it they published this big thing here report to the report of the office of inspector general.
4004.76s:  Of the office of audit of the SEC damn that's a fucking mouthful shit.
4010.76s:  And here's what they said we have stated on several prior occasions we're concerned about the negative effect of that failures deliver may have a markets and shareholders and addition.
4025.76s:  Issues and investors have repeatedly expressed concerns about failure to deliver in connection with manipulate make a short selling completely agree to the extent that fails deliver might be part of manipulative naked short selling which could be used as tool to drive down company stock price such fails to deliver may undermine the confidence investor could not agree more I think that that is exactly correct which by the way understanding of the year completely agree completely agree.
4050.76s:  Okay.
4053.76s:  One of the 11 recommendations was adopted.
4057.76s:  Doctor T saw this with her eyes that the effect was happening the business world and they were adopting new audit standards called risk based standards.
4067.76s:  And it was you to judge the risk by the dollar amounts that's outstanding really bad idea oh that's that's not a really bad idea except as dr T said when the stocks keep falling they're like.
4079.76s:  Problem one million on your list of problems okay.
4086.76s:  I dig this you decide which problems need attention went along until the latest round scene where game stop.
4096.76s:  Where people were selling shares and they were called phantom shares of standing phantom votes phantom votes work really well if you're lucky enough to get your vote cast.
4105.76s:  And continue to long pretty recently actually until the presence.
4109.76s:  So let's see what's wrong with naked shorting I hope this kind of made it clear they create an economic dislocation to put it kind of yeah completely agree.
4116.76s:  Yeah naked shorting I think is straight fucking trash.
4120.76s:  Completely agree with this.
4125.76s:  Very rare votes ever exceed 100% so often when the issue short making rarely comes up wonder what happens when it does.
4131.76s:  Then explains the famous merger happen on the basis of those that length or shares became unable to vote on the basis that length or shares and in fact those those they lent succeeded in making a horrible deal interesting.
4147.76s:  Very very interesting.
4152.76s:  All right.
4158.76s:  Institutional investors by the way big pension funds make monster money enormous amounts of money by lending shares to people who want to sell short.
4165.76s:  So and that's you receive essentially a yield right for letting people borrow something that you have.
4175.76s:  So let's say I have a brokerage account if I have signed a margin agreement I signed to allow my account to be a margin account they can lend my shares to anybody make money unbeknownst to me.
4185.76s:  I lose my vote because the disclosure is really very very poor I hear that some game stop owners have been finding words my proxy words my annual report now they get canceled out.
4197.76s:  Because they happen to have margin account regardless of the fact they may not have a penny and margin loans but they have signed an agreement that allows it yep.
4205.76s:  They don't get a penny of compensation so the agent is making millions and millions investors individual investors who are in the dark they're not even discovering it most times you don't know you didn't get a vote.
4218.76s:  Okay now if game stop because the imbalances so big people are asking where's my vote and if you have margin account you often don't get a vote or no you missed the day you missed the magic day and you don't get a vote.
4230.76s:  And so that one that is one of the worst okay.
4240.76s:  Now I have my very last of the worst very happy to see that interim SEC Alison here and Lee she was the interim chair.
4248.76s:  SEC commissioner while Gensler hadn't been confirmed yet the instructed staff to look into mutual fund voting because mutual funds are often like non voting mutual funds many of them are deciding that shareholder votes do indeed value okay.
4262.76s:  Game for institutions and mutual funds is to make millions by letting us yeah we know all that okay cool we know about I'm assuming he's talking about the credits and debit misalignment here yep.
4277.76s:  Essentially confirms that it seems mathematically impossible the shorts have covered okay we definitely have to read this.
4288.76s:  I'm just going to skim through it really quick to see if I can find the section.
4308.76s:  Absolutely it's mathematically impossible for this to happen except for the fact that it's not just naked part that's important to focus on it's important to focus on short selling itself when you allow people to keep reselling those.
4321.76s:  These imaginary shares to make loans you know I lend you a shovel you've got my shovel but if I lend you a stock you don't just have my stock you have a voting rate okay.
4332.76s:  So in other words it's mathematically impossible of trading volumes like this.
4337.76s:  What it's done is pumped in this infinite supply shares I can get bought by somebody all be it at lower prices so this is a problem itself there's no way around it it's not a mystery the numbers are clear they are what they are.
4351.76s:  So I think it's a real thing what happens when the meeting convenes and it could be people are feverishly working in their back rooms trying to cook the books okay.
4362.76s:  Interesting.
4372.76s:  Okay he's talking about Gensler.
4388.76s:  All right right.
4396.76s:  Pro States that he's hopeful we'll see change.
4401.76s:  With Gensler taking the lead touches simpler topic to Dr. E with legislation being worked on in the euro zone.
4411.76s:  Okay.
4413.76s:  Born voting.
4416.76s:  All right.
4425.76s:  Interesting.
4433.76s:  Okay.
4434.76s:  We have our next leave off point.
4439.76s:  What do you guys think.
4445.76s:  I wonder what the evaluation of Gensler's performance would would be.
4453.76s:  I think one of the things a lot of people don't fully understand or like fully on board is just how much bureaucracy can slow things down which is probably a really big part of the expectations of what
4468.76s:  Gensler might do versus what Gensler was actually able to do.
4471.76s:  So that parts really interesting.
4476.76s:  But the main takeaways I have from that AMA really second a lot of the stuff that we're aware of specifically the concepts of
4486.76s:  the game shares we learned a little bit about the voting element which I wasn't fully apprised of I really hadn't spend that much time thinking about it.
4496.76s:  So that's an interesting learned point.
4500.76s:  I think the other main takeaway that I pull out of there is the fact that the system obviously it's run right now leads to this essentially
4515.76s:  unlimited liquidity source which again I think we know and that's part of the that's part of also what we're seeing with naked shorting and whatnot.
4527.76s:  So interesting.
4533.76s:  Cool.
4535.76s:  All right gang.
4536.76s:  I think that wraps me up. I got us a little over an hour.
4538.76s:  Absolutely awesome to hang out with you guys.
4541.76s:  I'm going to work on a video talking about some of the position adjustments and stuff in GameStop along with the other coverage strangles that I have.
4549.76s:  So for like the model portfolios.
4551.76s:  So you guys will have that to chew on.
4553.76s:  And if you guys need anything hit me up.
4555.76s:  I'll see you all later being out there catch you later.
