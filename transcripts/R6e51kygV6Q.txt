596.00s: you
598.00s: I
599.36s: think the
600.56s: certainly
601.36s: 하�ward
603.04s: incentives
604.16s: into
609.76s: is
611.76s: economic
614.44s: making
616.44s: vulnerable
617.44s: It's
618.12s: going directly into the
619.44s: corner of the
621.46s: R&D
623.94s: final
625.44s: for the
627.46s: so that you can see this here.
632.70s: This essentially is the main volume node.
637.30s: And you can see the prices that it's hovering on the 2737
643.18s: and then the 2663 ish.
647.06s: And the reason why I highlight that is
650.06s: that's kind of the near term value areas
652.58s: we can see before it gets all the way down here.
655.38s: I still struggle to see a world where it would go back down here
660.82s: primarily because it's in a new financial position.
664.02s: So I don't actually think this would be highly likely
669.90s: but again, who actually knows?
671.90s: I don't, but based on standard analysis,
676.38s: this level here that I have drawn out the 2567,
679.82s: this becomes the next key level in my opinion.
682.50s: It's kind of falling on the next,
685.86s: like pre-key level, if there's a pre-key level,
688.50s: it's this bottom of this consolidation area,
691.74s: which extends over here,
693.14s: but this would be like the next like true key level
696.06s: in my opinion because this captures this entire new area
702.86s: that we've seen, this entire new value area,
705.26s: all of this is captured above here, right?
708.86s: That's when it's made the last stair step pattern up
712.30s: before it started consolidating sideways up down, right?
715.62s: Kind of doing standard game stop stuff.
717.62s: It's all above here.
719.54s: So that matters to me because if it does start falling below here,
726.82s: then that requires a bunch of different position adjustments
729.58s: actually from the covered strangle that I have on in there now
733.58s: that I've been talking to you guys about a little bit
735.74s: that again, we can either review or not.
738.54s: But if it does start flirting with this area here,
742.82s: that doesn't necessitate some changes for the position.
752.10s: Thank you for the $1.99 and we got,
755.66s: you feel tingling for bone cone on Tuesday.
764.30s: I mean, you probably know me well enough by now.
766.78s: You've given me a $1.99 enough time enough times by now
772.22s: to know that the tingling at least hasn't been there
776.74s: for a little bit.
779.02s: The reason why I say that is this was very normal standard
785.74s: price behavior.
786.66s: All of this, this entire run up here,
788.94s: very, very standard price behavior, it actually, again,
791.78s: it looked really good to me.
792.82s: I was very, very happy to see that.
795.38s: Then that down move, that giant red candle that you see there
799.98s: is very abnormal.
802.38s: That doesn't make a lot of fucking sense.
804.34s: Normally when you see stuff like this, it's news driven.
807.94s: Some sort of fundamental change occurs that leads to a change
812.18s: in underlying perception of value.
815.94s: There was none of that.
817.34s: Now, this is to reiterate a point that I've mentioned
821.62s: a bunch of times now that a lot of people seem to struggle with,
825.06s: but again, this is my opinion that GameStop does not follow
831.78s: standard technical analysis.
833.94s: It does not follow standard technical analysis.
836.82s: Standard technical analysis is entirely predicated
841.06s: on assessing supply and demand relationships.
848.38s: That's the whole point of TA.
851.22s: It's to assess supply and demand relationships.
855.22s: There are normal behaviors around those relationships
860.14s: and we tend to see and can represent those across a larger data set.
865.70s: GameStop sometimes absolutely will abide by those same norms
871.38s: and we've seen it again, like even this move here.
873.46s: This is abiding by those same norms.
876.18s: But the reason why I say it doesn't follow standard technical analysis
879.78s: despite the fact that frequently I would even argue
882.38s: a majority of the time it does.
885.06s: Because the most pivotal movements that you see in GameStop
889.62s: violate standard supply and demand relationships.
895.06s: There are structural elements to GameStop that cause different kinds of moves
901.62s: that violate those norms.
903.70s: And it's both to the upside and the downside.
906.66s: So the reason why I say it doesn't follow standard technical analysis
909.90s: because again, even though it does, and again,
912.98s: I would argue the majority of time is because when it makes some
917.98s: of its most pivotal moves, it's clearly not following that same suit.
924.38s: That breakoff point at those key moments is exactly why it doesn't follow
931.94s: standard technical analysis.
933.50s: And I've heard time and time again from a bunch of different people,
937.46s: like, oh, this person predicts it really well with TA or that person
941.02s: predicts it really well with TA.
943.46s: I've not found that yet.
945.58s: And that's not to say nobody can do it.
948.22s: I'm not saying that.
949.50s: But what I am saying is that for something like GameStop,
953.58s: you can apply standard methodology.
957.26s: I saw exactly zero posts or conjecture that on the 14th,
966.38s: the 14th, which was what was that like Tuesday?
969.38s: Fucking Tuesday, a Tuesday, a random ass Tuesday,
973.98s: that GameStop would just drop by 10%.
977.38s: Meanwhile, the underlying index that it's a part of,
982.30s: they have completely differently.
984.30s: And then you overlay some of the other basket names,
988.34s: something like AMC, and AMC had a semi-sympathetic move,
993.90s: but still not fully sympathetic move.
999.86s: So all of this is to say,
1002.98s: when we're conducting analysis on something like GameStop,
1006.66s: it is so unbelievably important to be really thoughtful
1013.46s: about what we're doing and track things carefully.
1016.34s: Because I notice, especially in the ape community,
1019.50s: I have observed long enough by now, I feel like who's that?
1023.82s: Who's that British dude that always does like the,
1026.94s: the documentaries about animals?
1029.10s: Is it David?
1030.06s: Yeah, this guy.
1032.30s: This is the guy.
1033.18s: I feel like this guy, I feel like this guy,
1036.74s: kind of watching the ape community from this guy's perspective,
1040.90s: right? Like I'm studying, I feel like I'm studying the apes.
1044.54s: And I've watched enough and I've seen enough now.
1048.14s: Holy shit, this dude is 98.
1051.86s: Fucking shout out to this guy born in 26, bro.
1065.14s: Holy fuck, that's incredible.
1068.62s: Shout out to that dude.
1069.94s: I feel like him when I'm observing the apes.
1073.18s: And I noticed that a really common thread is that of pattern seeking.
1081.22s: This is where the human brain is innately programmed to try to identify patterns,
1086.70s: right? That's normal. That's normal behavior.
1088.86s: What becomes slightly abnormal is when we do our best to interpret,
1094.62s: interpret everything we see and to interpret in a way that supports our underlying
1102.70s: ideas, what we want to see and stuff like that.
1105.22s: That's the problem because we lose objective reality.
1108.06s: Take this back to the technical analysis thing.
1110.50s: I've done a ton of research now.
1113.14s: I feel you guys will probably have noticed a difference in the way that I talk about this
1116.74s: stuff from when I first started following along the GameStop journey to now,
1121.94s: because I am now more confident in some of these things because I'm actually putting
1127.42s: in the time, I know I'm putting in the time.
1128.90s: I'm doing the research myself.
1130.82s: So I'm physically seeing this stuff.
1133.34s: And what's really interesting is I ran a bunch of different studies on
1141.10s: standard technical analysis in GameStop, like I would in anything else.
1144.82s: I observed things like moving averages, I observed things like standard deviation
1148.86s: channels, volatility, average volumes.
1151.94s: I did a couple different oscillators.
1154.26s: So I did RSI because that's my preferred one money flow index, stochastic,
1160.98s: MACD, I even overlaid candle patterns, which I don't really do that much because I don't
1167.30s: care that much about them.
1169.26s: And the predictive value of a lot of things that are predictive in other things
1174.02s: don't really translate well to this.
1178.02s: So all of this is to come to a cautionary note.
1183.10s: It's totally cool to be optimistic.
1185.82s: It's totally cool to want to see something.
1188.66s: It's totally cool to analyze things and look for trends.
1192.14s: What becomes really dangerous is if we have such a selection bias in terms of what
1197.38s: data points we will on board and remember versus what data points get shoved out.
1204.38s: And the only thing that does is hurt you.
1206.34s: It hurts you as an investor and a trader.
1208.82s: So as an investor, this shit's easy for you, right?
1211.46s: As an investor, it's just buy hold, buy hold, buy more hold, buy more and hold more, right?
1215.90s: That's from an investor's perspective.
1217.58s: This shit's as easy as it gets.
1219.26s: But from a trader's perspective is completely different because we're trying to make money
1224.38s: on a lot more of the movements, the micro movements that are happening.
1228.90s: And you have to have a really, really effective analysis approach in order to be able to do that.
1234.66s: Okay.
1236.46s: Coffee Donuts says Susan Trimbet has done a few videos with Josh from the gist on YouTube.
1241.98s: I genuinely have no idea who that is.
1245.06s: The stuff that I've seen from Susan, I think I saw one video with her.
1250.70s: And then I think I, we came across her in the DD library.
1253.46s: I was actually curious if we're going to come across more of her stuff as we go through it today.
1257.18s: But I already looked at her work before and it looks cool to me.
1261.54s: Like I, and again, I'm pretty sure that we'll be able to line up because it looks like her stuff is really interesting.
1271.38s: And I'm wondering, especially with some of the new up and comences with like Chicago,
1279.70s: change and whatnot, how she thinks some of the underlying market structure components are trending.
1286.50s: Because I like, I literally am curious what, what her opinion is.
1289.78s: So yeah, what we'll definitely see if we can get lined up with her.
1294.26s: Brad says, did you hear about the reverse repo in terms of what?
1297.46s: That's super, super broad.
1298.90s: The reverse repo in general, a verse repo market is pretty expansive.
1304.50s: I would need a little more context than that in order for me to respond back at least with anything useful.
1312.90s: All right.
1314.98s: Let's now, let's get into some homework.
1320.50s: Shall we? It's been a little while.
1322.82s: Right now, what I'm doing is I'm just grabbing another tab with chat GPT because we probably will need that.
1333.86s: And let's run through what we saw in GameStop last week.
1339.38s: We saw a really significant pullback.
1342.10s: And I read it, I reiterate the point that this pullback is seemingly not driven by anything.
1351.22s: It's nothing that I can clearly discern.
1354.02s: So what that then tells us is we need to take a peek at some of the underlying factors.
1361.06s: One of the underlying factors I was curious about is if we take a look at GameStop,
1367.38s: and we take a look at insider transactions, which we know is actually really small,
1376.18s: right? Like there's just every time that you see some sort of movement in here.
1381.06s: It's not incredible, but there were some insider transactions here.
1386.50s: So if you look at the sixth, we can see that two different entities were unwinding,
1394.42s: not huge positions, but some.
1398.18s: So there is a bit of an unwind on some of these, but there wasn't anything that stuck out to me massively
1405.46s: so. But it was two of them on the sixth around a similar time, which is kind of interesting.
1411.14s: So we see two different groups here, Daniel Moore and Haymond, these two folks.
1419.54s: So I thought that was interesting. Now that aside though, there wasn't anything else that I was
1426.66s: like, yeah, okay, this is a really, really big change going on in here from like an insider's
1431.78s: perspective. So then the next perspective we have to take a look at is an institutional
1436.74s: ownership. So GME institutional ownership change. And let's see.
1448.74s: This one's from Fintel. And if anything, it looks like expansion in sponsorship,
1464.02s: right? As far as we can tell, for institutional ownership. So nothing really jumping out at me
1471.62s: from this perspective. So as I looked through and try to find any semblance, any semblance of rational.
1479.46s: And when I say rational, it doesn't mean like it has to be a good reason. But again, normally when
1484.34s: we see moves like this, it's tied to fucking something. And what I can tell you is this is tied
1491.86s: to something. I just can't tell what. And it's a lot of the standard, some things that this might
1500.18s: be tied to are not applying here. So I really, really struggled the other thing I had. And let's see
1508.66s: if we run it really quick. I asked chat GPT to essentially summarize all news related to GameStop
1515.94s: and GameStop style stocks like it's peers on the 14th. So scour the internet for any news.
1530.18s: Related to GameStop, GameStop peers, GameStop industry, or anything else that could in any way
1544.66s: impact the price of GameStop specifically on 14 Jan 25.
1554.02s: Let's see. Okay, so we just we just caught one of them ourselves. Right. So one of the things that
1572.98s: we just caught ourselves, and this is from chat GPT, this is actually interesting because I didn't
1577.70s: ask it this before. But the first thing that I popped up with is on 14 Jan GameStop experiences
1583.22s: a 6% decline is actually 10% it, not enough. But it says this downturn coincided with insider
1590.98s: trading activities, notably the sale of 1577 shares by general counsel Mark Hammond Robinson
1596.66s: on January three, which again, I'm pretty sure January six based on Benzenga, but same same.
1601.70s: Such insider transactions can sometimes impact investor confidence and stock performance. So
1605.70s: that that can be a thing. Here's the problem. That first was released on like the fucking sixth here.
1612.10s: Like several days after. So I don't buy it. The next one that I've heard come up a bunch of times
1619.46s: were the store closures. So this is from the 12th. And the summary here says reports indicated
1632.18s: that GameStop quietly closed the significant number of US stores after the holiday season,
1637.46s: including locations in in Mcminville or again Vancouver, Washington. The company has not released
1645.62s: an official statement regarding these closures. Okay. So let's see the total impact potentially of
1654.34s: said closures. This is again from the 13th. 150 locations closed 10 in the Pacific Northwest,
1664.34s: not even through the first month, the 25 store closes keep coming. Let's see.
1671.62s: The injury of dissolving the cat. Shording. We know that they're closing stores.
1687.78s: Pacific Northwest Games upstairs reported closing in January 25.
1691.86s: Close past Friday at 11 11. And then this one closed in whatever it doesn't give me a specific date.
1700.82s: The reason why I mention this is because we know that there's stores closing and we can see that
1706.50s: the majority of these closures happen in 24. So it's like again, I don't think that this is not
1714.74s: part of that equation, but this still doesn't explain the movement that I saw. It just doesn't explain
1721.22s: it. So I would consider this a contributing factor, but I can't clearly with a logical mind say,
1728.26s: oh yeah, this is what caused the 10% dip. I just don't see that. Now another thing that a lot of times
1736.10s: people want to speculate, which is again, that's how we find shit out. I think it's good to speculate.
1743.70s: But another thing that I see people talking about with GameStop specifically is the fact that
1752.74s: there's not been any significant updates from leadership regarding like what what they're going to do.
1762.26s: And it's a completely fair question, but that question in and of itself, I still don't think
1769.78s: leads to a 10% decline again, to go back to standard standard technical analysis, standard
1776.34s: behavior of equities, especially because GameStop's not even a small cap stock technically anymore.
1782.74s: It's like a mid cap stock. What is the market cap? What is actually GameStop's market cap right now?
1789.86s: Because I know that they have a bunch in cash, but I don't know what their actual market cap is.
1795.54s: It's definitely over four billion and mid cap stocks are two to 10. Wait, Joseph's 12 billion.
1802.90s: Is it really, I didn't realize it was 12 billion. That's crazy. That's absolutely crazy. So then
1809.22s: by all definitions, that's technically a large cap stock. So back to the point, mid cap, large cap,
1817.06s: close close. The main thing is companies of those sides don't tend to have 10% days.
1822.50s: Intraday on no news. It can have it, but typically it's going to be tied to a catalyst.
1828.58s: Sometimes it can be Jensen talking shit during a keynote speech about quantum computing to send
1834.34s: them crashing industry expert perceivably talking about a key industry trend quantum computing
1841.86s: and the fact that it's forever's away. That I'm not saying that that justifies the movement
1847.14s: definitely will impact short term sentiment and we can clearly connect the dot. It's a logical
1851.86s: dot to connect. I have no dots to connect here and I can't find the fucking dots, which is
1858.26s: another thing that is continually so interesting. How games stop? There is shit going on here
1866.18s: that typically you can explain by something and there's fucking nothing here. That's bizarre.
1875.94s: It's interesting, but it's bizarre. Okay. Now that's stuff aside. Let's take a look at the
1882.66s: options chain really quick and then let me grab the workbook. I will grab the coverage
1891.30s: triangle stuff so that we can take a look at this for the position because there is even if we
1898.42s: don't run through the positions too much, I do want to ask you a couple questions about the position
1903.14s: that we that we have. Coffee says how can they eek out a profit with less stores and no marketing
1909.62s: to get people to buy on the e-commerce site? Well, they eeked out a profit just literally because
1914.90s: of interest. That's it. If they didn't have four billion in cash which does yield but not,
1922.58s: especially for a company of that size, but not significant amount of interest.
1926.82s: So that's literally the, there's like straight up the only reason. If they didn't have that cash,
1934.50s: it would have been negative. So, and I think again, that's people know that. There's nothing novel
1941.38s: there. Here is one of the larger expiration cycles that we've seen. Huge expiration cycle that
1952.10s: we've seen. We can see that now total call OI is 459 and we can see put OI is 157. There we
1964.98s: light. So that front expiration took out literally like 500,000 calls gone. Massive expiration cycle.
1975.86s: And if we take a look now to figure out where is everybody positioning, you can tell that again,
1981.46s: we're not playing the game of really near term positioning. The next primary expiration is 21
1989.46s: Feb. That's this yellow color that you see here. If you'll notice that yellow color is quite dominant.
1996.82s: There's a little bit of the orange going on. But if we take a look at that yellow color of that
2001.78s: 415 changed. There's 73 K there 65 K in the front expiration 31. No, I'm sorry 61 in 31 Jan. So two
2012.10s: weeks out. Seven Feb is super light at 26 K. This is all calls. The 14 Feb is 11 21 still is the
2021.30s: dominant expiration cycle that we can see next closest is 17 April 17 April is another primary
2028.26s: expiration cycle. So that will tend to be a little bit busier. 20 June. The thing I want you to
2033.46s: notice is that a lot of times when GameStop has these really big short term movements, you tend to
2039.38s: see a lot of short term positioning and options. We do not see that here because we see that again,
2045.46s: if we look at the 24 Jan expiration, it's like 65 666 K. We find a bunch of different
2050.82s: explorations now with that same amount of open interest specifically on the call side.
2057.38s: That's relevant because it tells us that the market is not overly positioning for a specific
2063.30s: movement in a specific time frame. It's almost spread not evenly, but it's distributed pretty well
2070.74s: across all these different explorations. The other thing is volatility is now very, very low.
2076.82s: The market is absolutely eyeballing something in seven Feb. Is that maybe, no, it's not when
2082.82s: their earnings is. What happens in seven Feb? You guys know that week, sorry, to clarify, it doesn't
2091.22s: have to be on seven Feb, but the week of seven Feb because that's a big enough variance in the
2096.58s: ball surface that the market's pricing something there. I don't know what it is though, but it's
2102.10s: pricing something on this week. I can't tell what. Let's take a look at the implied volatility,
2109.30s: though. Let's take a look for the out of the monies. Let's go to seven Feb. It's on the put side.
2114.98s: So there's heavy putski. What I'm showing you literally is just options detective work. I
2120.50s: doing this from a trader's perspective is how I identify a lot of trading opportunities. Now,
2128.50s: from a trader's perspective, you don't have to be able to explain everything. You'll never be able
2131.86s: to explain everything, but I can see stuff. It's pretty easy for me to see. So yeah, seven Feb,
2139.54s: something's going on on the put side in terms of where they're pricing vol. However,
2147.14s: yeah, it's like really, really put heavy on a comparative basis. So that's actually favoring a
2154.82s: downside move. In seven Feb. So something weird going on there. Hands can't really tell what.
2165.78s: Take a look again here.
2173.62s: Yeah.
2180.18s: Interesting. Definitely a downside skew.
2185.22s: In that seven Feb expiration. But do we have any idea?
2190.90s: Coffee says funny watching Eric see the abnormalities in GME. I've been here since 21. Well,
2196.42s: the funny thing is is like GME is interesting, but it's not the first to do all of this stuff.
2204.02s: I can't tell you how many tickers that I've explored and have seen have had very interesting
2209.54s: movements. Now, there's some qualifying levels to GameStop that make GameStop a little bit interesting,
2215.30s: specifically at size now. Again, you can find movements like this actually pretty regularly and
2219.78s: smaller companies that have less news coverage and stuff like that. Information to screeness is a
2224.90s: really big factor in terms of how things get priced in and how efficiently. But something like
2230.42s: GameStop with as much coverage as it has and the overall size, definitely there's some things
2236.58s: that stick out in a pretty big way. Coffee says earnings in March, nothing in Feb.
2244.02s: Interesting. Because this is saying something's going on in Feb. I don't know what.
2250.90s: Let's see if Chachu Petinos. Is there anything going on or expected
2261.94s: during the trading week ending?
2266.74s: On Seventh Feb, that is that might impact GME's price,
2279.70s: being elevated volatility in that cycle. See.
2296.74s: Yeah, not seeing Chachu Petis not returning anything. It's not saying that it sees anything specific
2306.50s: to GameStop either, which is really interesting.
2312.74s: Terp Strasse says a lot of people think there will be a recoil by 28 Jan.
2316.82s: Why 28 Jan?
2326.10s: What's the thesis behind that? Can you guys direct me? I'd love to take a look at that.
2334.50s: Are there any posts or anything that I could take a look at related to that?
2338.58s: I'm very, very interested in that. Oh, yeah. I got to make sure I say hello to Newton.
2350.34s: Every time I do these, I like to say hello to Newton. What's up, boy?
2357.46s: Got out from the GME dream thinking of you.
2363.46s: He and I were talking about options. He's a big fan of options. Now it's awesome. I'm such a big fan.
2376.42s: Okay.
2382.26s: Haggis says, why are more institutions buying GME recently? Well, I think it's because there's
2386.98s: probably from an institutional perspective, it starts to become an interesting play from a
2391.14s: podod's perspective. You have a company that's got a pretty significant pile of cash
2399.54s: that has a really loyal fan base. So that provides a pretty reasonable springboard
2405.22s: in order to make a move of some sort if the company can redefine itself. It's also sitting on
2411.30s: a bunch of cash. So the reason why that matters is because again, from a podod's perspective,
2416.34s: just kind of playing probabilities, we would probably surmise that the downside might be a little
2422.42s: bit more limited because the current state is already so priced in. But then the possibility for
2427.46s: new news of some kind to come out and to surge stock prices not insignificant. So that's the idea
2433.62s: of let's say GameStop comes out and they say that they're buying Bitcoin. I know a lot of people
2438.26s: really want to see that. I have to be honest. I don't really share that perspective, but if it does
2443.38s: happen cool. And from that perspective, though, that can send the price just skyrocketing, at
2452.98s: least in the short term. So people are probably looking to capitalize on some of that.
2459.86s: Gabe says, I wonder if there could be a T35 in Fed. Is that what it is? I'm curious where the
2466.34s: sequel is or like where the why where that date come from, the end of Jan, the the recall
2474.82s: potentially happening then. I just want to be able to actually take a look at it and analyze it
2479.70s: a little bit. But because I yeah, I like to look at the source materials if possible.
2490.90s: All right. So that's looking at the options. It's it's pretty mellow in there. And we'll do
2499.86s: what do we want to do next? Do we want to do a quick position update? Or do you guys prefer that
2503.78s: in a separate video? And then we just go straight into the DD library. Let me know.
2509.38s: Coffee says new and retired from his job after you taught him options. He hasn't retired yet,
2513.46s: but he's planning on retiring this year, which is going to be really cool. The yeah, the only thing
2518.50s: that makes me a little nervous for him is that he he said the magic words that always make me
2524.18s: concerned for traders when he he's just like, yeah, it's like a, you know, an infinite money machine.
2531.06s: That's that's not what it is. So I definitely don't want to see that potential issue coming up. But
2540.10s: yeah. Lawrence says maybe because everyone was saying that the chart looks similar to 21.
2547.70s: That's still so interesting to me because we spent a lot of time last weekend looking at that.
2553.38s: And the reality that it that it does not look very similar to 21. So it's really surprising to
2560.58s: me that people are still potentially on that thread of, I think this looks like 2021. That
2566.18s: looks like pattern seeking to me in my opinion. They're not saying that it looks completely disparate,
2572.50s: but it does not look the same. Yeah. The good thing is that we have a point of control here at 25.
2585.62s: So there's a lot of volume there at 25. Gabe says could be swaps annual rolling. I don't think so.
2594.26s: Again, I think people are, I think people see swaps and they're we're starting. It's almost like,
2603.46s: it's almost like old, this is what it reminds me of. It reminds me of old civilizations.
2610.42s: Old civilizations that couldn't explain things through reason and through scientific method because
2617.78s: they didn't have the, you know, the understanding or the materials or the process to test stuff.
2624.58s: We would chalk things up to different kinds of deities or we could say that it's bad luck or,
2631.70s: you know, a bunch of different things. When we don't know how to describe something, we tend to
2638.58s: then lean on other things as an explanation for it. So I don't think swaps have quite as big of an
2649.06s: impact as people tend to think it is. At least as far as we can see because we've looked, we've
2656.50s: looked pretty comprehensively at the swap data. And again, what I do is I don't say like, I think
2664.18s: this is what it is. Let me try and see and prove that this is the case. What I say is based on
2672.26s: all the swap data that I have, can I regress anything that shows any sort of defined relationship
2680.18s: between price movement and swaps coming up on expiration? Then we get more scowl pulled. We say,
2687.06s: okay, well, there's different kinds of swaps. Maybe if I segment by types of swaps, maybe there's
2692.34s: certain kinds of swaps that will correspond with different price movements and stuff like that.
2698.26s: And I just don't see it. So yeah, the idea of swaps, I do think that they fit into the broader
2708.58s: conversation here somewhere. But I don't think it's the Huckleberry. I don't think that that's as
2714.34s: dominant of a component as people might think that it is. Let me get rid of this.
2727.86s: All right.
2732.98s: I just see if anything else sticks out to me here not much.
2736.18s: Oh, one thing that did happen was.
2750.82s: Uh-huh.
2754.02s: Off the prison or leave your foot alone.
2758.74s: I don't know if you guys have dogs, but sometimes my dog just likes to sit there and like
2762.90s: chew his foot. I don't really understand why. I've never been like, you know, let me just
2771.38s: chew on my foot for a little bit. It's a strange, a strange sensation.
2780.82s: All right. I can get my watch plugged into charge while we're sitting here and we'll start running
2785.86s: through this DD library. We'll see what's up.
2793.70s: Okay.
2798.26s: Hagel says too many people in GME just throwing around theories when the stock,
2802.18s: when this stock is never normal. Yeah. It's that I really do think that there's some truth to that.
2808.90s: And we've talked about that before. I actually think some of it is not like damaging. That's
2814.02s: kind of dramatic. But I do think some of it is not in the best interest of like the community
2821.06s: writ large because it unfortunately there are a lot of people. There are a lot of people that are
2831.46s: a little bit more lay and they're more willing to accept things at face value, especially if they're
2837.94s: not scrutinous. And I don't think that there's an insignificant number of people that place
2844.90s: trades based on stuff like that based on the trust me, bro. And it's their own money. They should
2849.06s: do whatever they want. And it's their own fault. But I do think that it starts to lead people
2856.34s: unnecessarily down the wrong path. Again, my two cents. I think a lot of people are a little to
2865.94s: they're a little too eager to try to be the person that predicts something and cracks some sort of
2873.22s: code. And I just don't think that it's healthy for the other people that are trying to follow along
2879.62s: with this thing and might be influenced by that stuff. Now again, I don't like going down the
2885.94s: path of like trying to protect people against themselves. It's like their own choice. So if somebody
2890.50s: wants to read a trust me, bro, thing on Reddit and then place trades because of it, then I mean,
2894.98s: that's on them. That's that's their own bag entirely. It's their right to be able to do that. But
2900.98s: yeah, I just think it models, models things a little bit more.
2907.70s: Gregory says, do you have data or knowledge on why we ran in May and June? I know you have
2911.86s: discussed this probably just want to know what you thought about those two spikes in GameStop. Well,
2915.94s: yeah, that's in this year. This was a this is a squeeze like that's exactly what this is.
2922.10s: This is a squeeze. And then this is partially from earnings, but then this is also partially
2929.54s: another squeeze. So these are people that are off sides and shorts starting to cover. At these
2937.62s: levels originally, there wasn't an abundance of shares around yet. So that meant it was still
2946.82s: a little more difficult to access shares to cover. But we could see options positioning
2955.22s: happening way back here, even before the cat dropped his shit. Once the cat dropped his stuff,
2961.06s: everything went parabolic. And the reason for that is because a big thing that smooths out
2966.34s: volatility in markets is even when you see really big orders come through. You don't know who it is.
2973.30s: You don't know who it is or why they're doing it. But when somebody displays of really big
2979.06s: position like he did, now you kind of fucking know why he's doing it. And that can cause a lot of
2987.14s: jitters in the broader market because of now we know there's an option holder that has access to
2992.90s: a bunch of shares potentially. And that can cause short-term movement, short-term pain. So that's
2999.06s: a lot of people that are just looking to exit out of their position so that they don't get stuck
3002.66s: in that if they're trading it from the short side of things. So yeah, these are literally just
3008.26s: short squeezes. And I know again for a lot of people, this isn't Moas, this isn't like the squeeze
3014.82s: or whatever you want to call it, but these are unequivocally short squeezes. And there might be a
3020.34s: gamma squeeze element to it. I think that that is definitely part of it. But yeah, I think that
3031.62s: this is overall a short squeeze probably coupled again with some aspects of a gamma squeeze.
3041.30s: All right.
3042.34s: All right. Cool. Let's get into some of this. And then I'll just do the like update video on
3053.06s: the position just because I think that's probably less interesting to people than going through this
3058.18s: stuff. Okay. So this is with Carl Hagberg. I don't know Carl Hagberg.
3069.86s: Who's Carl Hagberg?
3085.62s: Okay. Here we go. Dr. T's book. Whoa.
3090.50s: This literally just like completely. Okay. Cool. We're still on the screen just like crashed entirely.
3109.86s: Okay.
3110.74s: Okay.
3112.74s: Gregory says been burned on call credit spreads for years. So just waiting on wait. CCS call credit
3119.54s: spread or something else. You mean the ticker?
3134.58s: Who is? Okay. Let me go through this.
3136.90s: All right. 50 years of experience transfer agency, distribution, tabulation,
3145.62s: and proxy adjudication services. Wait. What's the elections? Wait. What does this have to do with?
3157.30s: Okay. Shareholder rights and corporate governance. Okay. Cool. That's super, super helpful.
3167.14s: All right.
3183.62s: I'm just getting into the part where like they're talking about current stuff.
3190.34s: And then I got to pop the door for three real quick.
3196.82s: Oh, you guys CCS is that's crazy work for covered calls.
3210.74s: Everybody would just say CC nuts. All right. Back to this.
3218.34s: Explains that college dropout too young. Yeah. Okay. I don't care about all this stuff to be honest.
3222.82s: I want to see.
3227.14s: The like his conclusions with respect to this thing.
3232.26s: Wasn't mass democracy share ownership democratized.
3240.10s: Okay.
3243.46s: Didn't keep up with the paperwork.
3253.22s: Okay.
3257.78s: Talks went up and increasing volume.
3261.38s: We're just trying to understand like the key takeaways here. I'm not really seeing a lot so far.
3275.46s: Okay.
3281.06s: Okay. So in order to solve the paper crisis,
3283.62s: Carl and legman like him went out took surveys and try to find solutions. All right. Let's see.
3291.22s: I've involved in shareholder meetings. New long to.
3296.82s: So much in here.
3304.18s: Okay.
3306.18s: This is a general like good investing tidbit. Right. This is similar to what Warren Buffett.
3312.74s: And then talk about.
3315.14s: Which is good management. So yeah, I think that's good.
3323.38s: All right. Oh, he's short sellers. As long as I can remember.
3328.26s: Literally, vulture capitalists, they would move on companies that were sort of weak and then try
3333.14s: to drive them down to zero. Now, I do. I don't fully agree with this because
3340.50s: I genuinely don't believe all short sellers are trying to do this. I think
3349.94s: there are different kinds of short sellers. I think there are short sellers that would be
3355.38s: open and receptive to something like seller boxing, which is this. But I don't, I just don't
3362.42s: think it's fair to buck it all short sellers like this. Short sellers do play a role in the market.
3368.18s: I don't like short selling to be clear. I generally, if I'm trading something to the downside,
3374.50s: it's with options. But I, there are still a there's still a purpose for them, right. So even if you
3382.34s: think about vultures, there is a purpose for vultures in the just circle of life. So I wouldn't
3391.70s: really consider them this necessarily. But I see its point. I think the main thing I'm trying to flag
3399.78s: here is that this is what Carl is describing. I would argue is like a subset of short sellers.
3407.78s: I don't think that that's descriptive of all short sellers in general.
3415.14s: Okay, so they could sell why there's still life in them, then buy them back.
3422.34s: Okay.
3436.50s: We had a shareholder meeting had millions of shares outstanding. We got votes of a million and a
3441.30s: half shares. It's because of short selling. You don't even have to have naked short selling.
3447.06s: I agree with that. I'll try to explain in very simple terms that you'll have a meeting. There are
3451.62s: 50% more votes than there are shares outstanding. And if you subtract the ones that are held by
3456.98s: management and long term mutual funds, really more like three times the number of shares that are
3462.34s: held by real people. Okay. So we're trying to get to the bottom of this and trying to figure out how
3469.46s: do you stop this? How do you reconcile this? Well, the fact of the matter is even when you're when
3472.98s: you're not naked, when you borrow the shares and say, okay, I've set more shares the size of the
3477.70s: lender keeps his vote. He's still the owner. Okay. He's only lent them. Like if I lent you a
3483.78s: shovel, I'm still the owner. Yep. And I still get my voting whites. Meanwhile, if a short seller
3488.82s: actually sells, well, the law of economics say that you cannot have a seller without a buyer.
3493.86s: Okay. I see. So what's happened is you say, all right, I'm going to repay the loan,
3501.78s: where you now have to go into the market and buy the shares, close the deal, you got what are
3505.78s: known as phantom shares. So when you have an excessive sellers, as we've seen in GameStop,
3511.78s: and you have a finite universe of buyers, the debits don't equal the credits anymore. Yep.
3516.66s: So that creates a decoupling fully fully agree here.
3525.30s: Sometimes the votes are two and a half or three times this, yep, and I agree, like that is a
3529.86s: problem completely agree. Okay. Infinite liquidity cheat code. This is interesting.
3536.42s: Sometimes they're doing this with mallison for thought they're looking to drive the company
3540.34s: down to zero or they can short sell it 50 drive price down to one or two. When you have unfettered
3545.78s: securities lending, okay, people can just keep lending to you when you can keep doing more deals
3551.46s: sending more shares to buyers. You've diluted the voting power and you've diluted the apparent
3555.30s: liquidity for that stock, okay? Because what you have is infinite liquidity. You can just keep
3560.10s: borrowing more and borrow against what you've borrowed. Okay. So when the time that this is so clearly
3568.02s: out of control, I have to hand it to the CEO of overstock.com. That's how I met Dr. T and how I met
3574.98s: West Christian, whose prominent highly successful lawyer in this field. We're all outraged and we're
3581.38s: like, wait a minute, how can this possibly happen? The short sellers sometimes they actually have
3586.98s: believed that the company is just a bag of feathers, but sometimes they just exercise their first
3591.38s: amendment rights and spread rumors. And when you see the stock price go down, the rumors seem to be
3596.10s: true. And people act as if they are true. And that's how stocks go to zero.
3601.54s: I don't agree with this fully. The reason why I don't agree with this fully is because of
3616.98s: new information and information availability. The reason why I say that is because
3623.38s: if all it takes is a couple rumors, essentially, to send a stock down to zero, that completely
3631.62s: skims over the fact that you have to have a company that is not doing well for some reason or
3638.90s: another. And from a fundamental perspective, doesn't look good because even if there's some
3644.98s: ugly rumors milling about, that doesn't inherently send stock down to zero because there will be people
3653.54s: at some point that say stock XYZ, yeah, there, you know, CEO did some sleaze back things. However,
3665.38s: however, the stocks been pushed down enough and I actually think it's at a good value now compared
3670.90s: to the current price. So I'm going to buy it here. It's a great example of what happened in GameStop.
3676.42s: Hafiz says, Hindenburg built a business on ugly rumors. Yeah, I actually don't agree with that either.
3682.98s: I don't think that they've necessarily built a business on ugly rumors and I don't know Hindenburg
3687.70s: research. We've just done like a cursory overview. But what I can tell you is based on some of the
3693.22s: prior names that we looked up for them, it looks like to a degree, some of what they do, I can't
3699.78s: speak holistically because I don't know all that what they do. But some of what they do from
3703.86s: elements that I've seen, they're literally, they're like detectives, some short sellers
3711.38s: to zoom out from Hindenburg, but some short sellers literally act as a detective style arm that
3718.98s: go deeper and focus on something. So Hindenburg, for example, with some of the stuff that they did
3725.30s: on Carvana as you're reading through it, I can actually corroborate some of it with what I see
3731.70s: happening from earnings releases, happening from management meetings. Like I can see some of those
3738.02s: things. So yeah, it's like I'm not advocating for them and I'm not saying that they're not doing
3745.54s: anything that they don't do ugly rumors or anything like that. I don't know those elements.
3750.02s: But I just don't think it's fair again to bubble up what they do to saying they do ugly rumors,
3756.66s: that's their business because again, if that's all it was predicated on, people would buy it.
3765.30s: If I knew, for example, a company like Hindenburg when they put out a report of some sort,
3770.82s: and I know that it's just hot air, that I know it's nothing, that I know that the company's fine,
3775.70s: and I know that this short seller who has a position because we know they have a position
3780.66s: before they put out their report and they put out the report and I know the reporter's bullshit.
3785.46s: Guess what that tells me? It tells me that if I buy it because everything that they're saying I
3792.98s: know is bullshit and it's just hot air, I know that there's a short seller on the other side of that.
3798.42s: So I know if I start buying it and it moves enough against their position, that starts literally
3805.22s: to cause a short squeeze. They now have to buy to cover which will drive the price up even more.
3811.38s: So all I'm trying to elucidate here is that it's short sellers inherently are not just this
3821.70s: bucket of bad people that are spreading bad rumors and that's all they're doing. There's more
3825.54s: to it than that. That's all. I'm not saying that they don't do that. I'm sure some of them do.
3830.58s: And I'm sure elements of them are predatory. I'm sure some of them engage in seller boxing.
3836.26s: Like we know that's the case. I just don't think it's good for all generalizations because we lose
3842.18s: some of the really important nuance that we probably should maintain. So same thing here, I don't
3848.18s: think that's the main thing I don't I don't align with is I don't think just spreading rumors
3854.74s: is what will start to cause the stock to go down that has to be backed by something
3861.78s: underlying that looks valid. Otherwise, it wouldn't it wouldn't go. A great example of this is what
3871.22s: Michael sailor with Bitcoin, he's been saying that it's going to go up to like all these crazy numbers
3877.70s: in all these really interesting time frames and it continues to not fucking do that.
3883.86s: And that's because broader market consensus is saying, okay, well, I like Bitcoin, it's good,
3889.30s: but maybe adoption is a little bit slower. Regulation isn't exactly where it needs to be so on and so
3894.10s: forth. So then it's not like this just surging asset because of what this dude says. There's still
3900.66s: market participants that help normalize price. Okay.
3908.50s: Supplying to man out the window, many companies will do not because the share price
3914.42s: stripe, but when it dropped, they couldn't borrow any money and when they couldn't sell any more
3918.82s: stock, the credit rating was ruined. Yep, that's fair. I need to text mail real quick
3926.34s: if she is a dinner preference. Before you know what good businesses literally have to
3934.02s: fold, they just went bankrupt. They couldn't afford their business anymore.
3941.06s: Again, the only thing I would question here is I don't see how we could objectively call
3951.46s: them good businesses if this happens.
3957.62s: But yeah, they just want bankrupt couldn't afford. Okay. So that's the start of to pay a little
3965.14s: bit of attention, but I must tell you back in 2000s and from that time till now, they have
3968.90s: terrible track record. So they passed reg show, which we all know about, put a bandaid on things,
3976.98s: quieted down for a bit. Oh, nine short sellers again, tremendous profits. Guess what?
3983.38s: instances where many of these firms were destined for failure, but they ended up pushed down the
3987.54s: drain twice as fast by everyone giving up on them and selling short. So as you see, woke up again,
3992.02s: says maybe we need to look again, have this little thing, only a minute to read it. They published
3998.58s: this big thing here report to the report of the office of Inspector General of the office
4007.62s: of the SEC. Damn, that's a fucking mouthful. Shit. And here's what they said. We have stated
4016.74s: it on several prior occasions. We're concerned about the negative effect of that failure's
4022.26s: deliver may have a markets and shareholders and addition. Issues and investors have repeatedly
4028.18s: expressed concerns about failure to deliver in connection with manipulative Naked Short selling,
4032.26s: completely agree to the extent that fails to deliver might be part of manipulative Naked Short
4037.30s: selling, which could be used as tool to drive down a company stock price. Such fails to deliver
4041.22s: may undermine the confidence investor could not agree more. I think that that is exactly correct,
4045.94s: which by the way, understanding of the year completely agree, completely agree.
4050.98s: Okay. One of the 11 recommendations was adopted. Dr. T saw this with her eyes that the effect
4061.38s: was happening in the business world and they were adopting new audit standards called risk-based
4066.10s: standards. And it was you to judge the risk by the dollar amounts that's outstanding, really bad idea.
4072.66s: Oh, that's not a really bad idea. Except as Dr. T said, when the stocks keep falling, they're like
4080.02s: problem one million on your list of problems, okay.
4083.62s: I dig this. You decide which problems need attention. Went along until the latest round, seeing where
4094.18s: games stop, where people were selling shares and they were called phantom shares of standing,
4099.54s: phantom votes, phantom votes work really well if you're lucky enough to get your vote cast.
4105.14s: So that continued along pretty recently, actually until the present. So let's see, what's
4110.02s: wrong with naked shorting? I hope this kind of made it clear. They create an economic dislocation
4114.58s: to put it kindly. Yeah, completely agree. Yeah, naked shorting, I think is straight fucking trash.
4120.42s: Completely agree with this.
4125.22s: Very rare votes ever exceed 100%. So often when the issue shortnaking rarely comes up,
4130.02s: wonder what happens when it does. Then explains the famous merger happened on the basis of those
4134.50s: that Lentair shares became unable to vote on the basis that Lentair shares. And in fact,
4139.94s: though those they lent succeeded in making a horrible deal. Interesting.
4147.62s: Very, very interesting. All right.
4158.50s: Institutional investors, by the way, big pension funds make monster money, enormous amounts
4162.66s: of money by lending shares to people who want to sell short. And that's you receive essentially a yield.
4169.62s: Right. For letting people borrow something that you have.
4175.78s: So let's say I have a brokerage account. If I have signed a margin agreement, I sign to allow my
4180.82s: account to be a margin account. They can lend my shares to anybody, make money, unbeknownst to me.
4185.62s: I lose my vote because the disclosure is really very, very poor. I hear that some GameStop owners
4192.98s: have been finding words, my proxy, words, my annual report. Now they get canceled out
4197.62s: because they happen to have a margin account. Regardless of the fact they may not have a penny in
4201.62s: margin loans, but they have signed an agreement that allows it. Yep. They don't get a penny of compensation.
4208.18s: So the agent is making millions and millions of investors, individual investors who are in the dark.
4213.94s: They're not even discovering it. Most times you don't know you didn't get a vote.
4219.22s: Okay. Now with GameStop, because the imbalance is so big, people are asking, where's my vote?
4223.46s: And if you have a margin account, you often don't get a vote or no, you missed the day. You missed
4228.34s: the magic day and you don't get a vote. And so that one, that is one of the worst. Okay.
4240.90s: Now I have my very last of the worst. Very happy to see that interim SEC, Alison Heron Lee.
4246.42s: She was the interim chair. SEC commissioner, while Gensler hadn't been confirmed yet, the
4253.38s: instructed staff to look into mutual fund voting because mutual funds are often like non-voting.
4257.94s: Mutual funds, many of them are deciding that shareholder votes do indeed have value. Okay.
4267.62s: The game for institutions and mutual funds is to make millions by letting us, yeah, we know all that.
4271.70s: Okay. Cool. We know about I'm assuming he's talking about the credits and debit misalignment here. Yep.
4278.42s: Essentially confirms that it seems mathematically impossible that the shorts have covered. Okay. We
4285.54s: definitely have to read this. I'm just going to skim through it really quick to see if I can find
4294.10s: the section. Here we go. Oh, absolutely. It's mathematically impossible for this to happen,
4312.50s: except for the fact that it's not just naked part that's important to focus on. It's important
4316.82s: to focus on short selling itself when you allow people to keep reselling those these imaginary
4322.90s: shares to make loans, you know, if I lend you a shovel, you've got my shovel, but if I lend you
4327.46s: a stock, you don't just have my stock, you have a voting rate. Okay. So in other words, it's mathematically
4334.26s: impossible to have trading volumes like this. What it's done is pumped in this infinite supply of
4340.58s: shares that can get bought by somebody, albeit at lower prices. So this is a problem itself.
4346.10s: There's no way around it. It's not a mystery. The numbers are clear. They are what they are.
4350.82s: So I think it's a real thing what happens when the meeting convenes and it could be people are
4355.46s: feverishly working in their back rooms trying to cook the books. Okay. Interesting.
4373.70s: Okay. He's talking about Gensler.
4381.22s: All right.
4397.70s: Pro States that he's hopeful. We'll see change
4402.34s: with Gensler taking the lead. Touches simpler topic to Dr. T
4407.22s: with legislation being worked on in the euro zone.
4412.26s: Okay.
4414.02s: Born voting. All right.
4426.26s: Interesting.
4427.46s: Okay.
4430.66s: We have our next leave off point.
4437.30s: What do you guys think?
4445.86s: I wonder what the evaluation of Gensler's performance would be. I think
4454.90s: one of the things a lot of people don't fully understand or like fully on board is just how
4461.70s: much bureaucracy can slow things down, which is probably a really big part of the expectations
4468.50s: of what Gensler might do versus what Gensler was actually able to do. So that part's really interesting.
4476.98s: But the main takeaways I have from that AMA really second a lot of the stuff that we're aware of
4484.26s: specifically the concepts of Bansam shares. We learned a little bit about the voting
4490.10s: element, which I wasn't fully apprised of. I really hadn't spend that much time thinking about it.
4495.86s: So that's an interesting learned point. I think the other main takeaway that I pull out of
4504.90s: there is the fact that the system obviously, it's run right now, leads to this essentially
4516.10s: unlimited liquidity source, which again, I think we know. And that's part of the
4522.74s: that's part of also what we're seeing with naked shorting and whatnot. So interesting.
4530.58s: Cool. All right, Gang. Well, I think that wraps me up. I got us a little over an hour.
4539.38s: Absolutely awesome to hang out with you guys. I'm going to work on a video talking about
4544.02s: some of the position adjustments and stuff in GameStop along with the other coverage
4548.58s: strangles that I have. So for like the model portfolios. So you guys will have that to chew on.
4553.94s: And if you guys need anything, hit me up. I'll see you all later. Be an outlier. Catch you later.
