0.00s: What's up outliers?
1.64s: Today's video is going to be talking about the covered
4.08s: strangle in GameStop.
5.44s: This is actually going to be a practical application.
7.76s: I've taken part of my holdings in GameStop.
11.60s: And I am turning it into an example for us to follow.
16.52s: So a while ago during a live stream,
19.44s: we took a look at GameStop together
21.36s: of Saturday Live Stream.
22.24s: And I asked, what is the average holding size
26.20s: for GameStop?
27.64s: And I looked through the chat and I picked a regularly
31.92s: occurring number or range within there.
34.84s: And what I did was take a portion of my GameStop holdings.
38.68s: And I'm tracking them desperately
41.24s: from the rest of the portfolio.
43.12s: And I'm going to show you how we can trade something.
47.92s: I can trade something specifically
50.56s: like the covered strangle in GameStop,
53.20s: which is one of my staple option strategies.
57.24s: There's a very specific use case in GameStop
60.44s: that applies beautifully.
62.76s: But first, let's start with a quick recap
67.04s: of what the covered strangle is.
68.52s: Now, I have a couple videos.
70.00s: I have an entire playlist, actually.
71.72s: About this specific strategy,
73.52s: because it's one that I use a lot.
75.84s: So I'm going to link to those in the notes below
78.96s: for your viewing pleasure if you want
81.68s: to get a little further into detail.
82.92s: But I'm going to give you a quick overview
85.24s: of what the covered strangle is.
87.44s: And then why this fits so well with something like GameStop.
92.36s: So first things first, what is the covered strangle?
94.80s: As you can tell by my very neat handwriting,
97.96s: it is long shares plus hash secured puts,
103.96s: short puts plus ratio short calls against the long shares.
110.32s: So let's take a look at what this actually looks like.
112.76s: And if you can't tell what these are,
114.04s: these are the risk profiles.
115.72s: This shows you what, which, what each of these individual
120.60s: positions looks like.
123.20s: And then I will show you what the composite looks like.
126.12s: So I have this pulled up in my pass through IRA account.
130.16s: So I'm recreating the position here with the current basis
135.48s: that I have for these different things.
136.92s: So the position itself is already on.
139.36s: Now, at the end of this video,
141.28s: I actually want you to comment what allocation you think I should
147.04s: use for this example.
148.96s: My game plan is to run this example at least for a quarter
152.36s: and do like a weekly update about it.
154.08s: Could go longer.
154.84s: It's however long we decide that it's interesting.
158.60s: Now to that note, I'm specifically trying to pick
162.00s: an amount of money or the allocation that is applicable
166.44s: to as many people as I possibly can.
168.48s: It's why I picked so far a very small amount of money.
172.16s: But we can modify it to be whatever we would like it to be.
176.24s: Now, for me, as I've already explained,
179.52s: GameStop is a very small part of my portfolio.
182.96s: And the main reason why I started holding the shares,
186.48s: like specifically holding the GameStop shares,
189.28s: was really just a participate and to show some love
192.96s: for what the apes are doing.
194.44s: Because I still very much consider myself aghast.
197.56s: But I'm a fan, so I like to try to support where I can.
201.88s: Now, what I did was pick an amount of money,
206.64s: 15,000 dollars is what I'm using right now.
209.88s: And that's based on that live stream.
212.16s: And I pulled some of my shares over.
216.28s: And I'm tracking them and I'll show you how I'm tracking them.
219.44s: And then I have the rest of the options positions on on top of it.
223.24s: So we're starting with 200 shares of GameStop
226.52s: at a basis of 2431.
228.96s: I actually have a much better basis than this.
231.76s: However, I picked a bit of a midpoint on the chart
237.00s: so that I can track essentially
240.00s: from the period of somebody scaling in during this up move,
245.00s: taking us back to towards the beginning of November.
249.20s: So that's where that basis comes from.
251.92s: Now, if we go back to this tab, this is what long shares look.
259.60s: It's essentially a positive sloping line
262.68s: that moves one for one dollar for dollar with the underline.
265.48s: So pretty straightforward.
267.44s: Now, if I show you the short put component by itself,
272.64s: you'll see that it has capped profit potential,
275.44s: uncapped risk to the downside.
278.04s: Same thing with the other put when you overlay the two different puts,
280.92s: it develops a slightly curved line
282.96s: because of the different expressions and the different strikes,
285.48s: but it's essentially the same.
287.32s: Apped profit potential undefined risk to the downside.
291.64s: Then if we add short calls by themselves,
294.08s: you'll see that we have risk to the upside
296.44s: and defined profit to the downside.
299.84s: Now, the ensemble of all of these put together
303.16s: is very purposeful.
304.64s: So the basis for the coverage triangle
307.08s: with respect to what we're doing here
308.92s: is very specific to those that are holding shares
313.64s: of game stop already that just want to hold the stock.
317.60s: And the way that I look at trading the coverage triangle
321.16s: is for those kinds of people that would like
324.36s: to hold the stock anyways.
327.16s: It is a method to make a little bit more money
331.12s: on something that you're going to hold anyways.
335.20s: So we start with our 200 shares.
338.88s: We layer on that short call.
342.52s: Notice how it's only one short call
345.52s: against the 200 shares.
347.64s: This is for two primary reasons.
350.36s: One, it makes sure I do not have capped upside
354.52s: if I chose to exit the trade as a whole,
358.64s: meaning I close the call.
360.40s: I close the shares at the same time, exit the whole thing.
363.48s: The other thing is it gives me more ability
366.08s: to manage these calls should they wind up in the money.
369.88s: And that will be a further video for when it hopefully
373.40s: eventually happens.
374.92s: And I can walk you through how I can avoid being assigned
379.28s: on these calls, although it is always a risk,
381.92s: which is why I keep it at a ratio,
383.72s: because I don't actually want the shares to go away.
386.72s: It's always a risk.
388.52s: But we can do things to minimize it, which, again,
391.24s: is we get into the management of the position
395.00s: and the strategy, and you'll see more of that.
397.72s: And then we have additional short puts on beyond
403.72s: just the long shares.
406.12s: And there's a reason why these short puts work so well
409.88s: in something like GameStop.
411.08s: So this is what the entire position looks like
415.24s: on a risk profile by itself.
418.44s: Pretty simple.
419.64s: It maintains a upwards sloping line.
423.16s: So it still has unlimited profit potential.
427.16s: And it maintains the downside cap is whatever we put
433.40s: into the trade essentially.
435.16s: So it's planning for in this scenario that going to zero.
438.96s: This trade would lose 12,000 to 244 bucks,
441.52s: something like that.
442.32s: That's if GameStop wants zero, which right now
444.64s: doesn't look like it's going to do.
446.44s: So let's now take a look at why the covered
450.52s: Strangle in GameStop.
452.36s: Well, there's a few things that contribute really, really well.
456.88s: The way that I trade GameStop directionally
459.52s: is very different than what I'm showing you here.
461.56s: Again, the covered strangle in this context
464.36s: is designed for something that you would want to hold anyways.
469.64s: Now, the way that I trade it when it's moving around a lot
473.88s: I'll use single options and trade the actual direction.
478.04s: The purpose of this strategy is to optimize
482.36s: and existing holding position of stock.
486.72s: So the base position in the covered strangle is long shares.
489.84s: And then the options are just to amplify the position.
493.68s: GameStop presents a really interesting opportunity
497.24s: because it's very, very high volatility.
501.76s: And the options positions that we use in the strategy
505.24s: are both short options positions.
508.44s: So it means we're selling.
510.00s: We're selling options in something
512.12s: that is very high volatility.
514.24s: That means that you're going to make a lot more money
517.12s: on a relative basis compared to selling options
521.88s: on something with lower volatility.
523.44s: You're also taking advantage of some structural components
527.52s: of volatility, things like volatility risk premium VRP.
532.48s: Now, that sounds a little heavy, but it's a very simple concept.
536.92s: If we take a look at this chart of GameStop,
539.40s: you'll notice this is volatility.
542.00s: This yellow line is implied volatility for a 30-day time frame.
546.44s: This gray line is one month vault 21 days technically,
551.76s: but it's also one month vault.
553.12s: So both yellow and gray are one month vaults.
557.32s: Notice how in general implied volatility is higher
562.80s: than realized volatility.
565.44s: In general, when you sell options, you capture some of this,
571.12s: depending on how you structure the trade and manage it.
573.76s: But in general, when you're selling options,
577.52s: if implied volatility remains elevated,
580.36s: it means that you are collecting more premium
584.28s: than the underlying is actually moving.
587.36s: So there's an edge baked into this from the options perspective,
593.08s: which is why something like GameStop is so advantageous.
597.28s: It has 110% IV, that's for a 30-day time frame.
602.20s: The implied vaults, let me present I was 53%.
604.88s: So it's very, very high volatility.
607.00s: And for comparison, if this doesn't make a lot of sense,
609.52s: do you'll see a look at Apple, AAPO?
612.16s: Apple is 26.6% volt.
615.52s: This is a 68% implied volatility percentile.
620.52s: implied volatility percentile is a really simple metric
623.68s: that plots all of the previous for the last year,
627.32s: implied volatility numbers against the current implied volatility.
631.72s: And this simply tells you that the current level of vault
635.84s: is higher than 68% of the time.
638.84s: This is very high.
640.32s: So then if we go to GameStop by comparison,
643.16s: it's almost quadruple plus the volatility from on average.
649.72s: Right now, vaults actually a little bit low in here.
652.28s: But it's 110% volt compared to 25% volt.
657.28s: And notice how implied volatility percentile is lower,
660.44s: even though this is so much higher than Apple.
662.96s: It means that on an average basis,
665.32s: GameStop is way more volatile.
669.84s: So you can capture that via short options.
672.84s: Now, there is another great benefit
675.92s: to trading the coverage triangle on something like GameStop.
680.56s: And it's because of this short call component.
683.36s: And I'll explain why.
685.32s: Hypically speaking, when we are selling options,
689.48s: options most often will exhibit what is called let's skew.
693.92s: That means that the puts are priced more richly
698.88s: compared to the corresponding out of the money call.
703.20s: So let's take a look and see if that's the case in Apple.
705.04s: Actually, don't know.
705.56s: I haven't looked yet.
707.40s: So a 29 delta put 36 days out.
714.04s: The vault in here is 26.9%.
716.76s: 26.99% call 27.
719.16s: That's for the 29 delta.
721.40s: There's no 29 delta call.
723.08s: There's a 31.
723.92s: So let's see what the 31 is.
725.12s: The 31 is 23.75.
727.80s: So even though this is an even higher delta,
732.88s: notice that this volatility is much higher
736.56s: on the put side than the call side.
738.60s: That is because the market tends to price puts more
742.20s: expensively than calls.
744.72s: And that's because the market's tend to crash down.
747.92s: And they kind of slowly go up saying is elevator down.
751.72s: There's up.
753.00s: OK.
754.40s: Let's take a look at GameStop.
755.80s: Now before we do that, let's just mentally
757.92s: note what the difference is.
759.36s: This is in terms of vault 23.7 against 27.
764.96s: So about 4.ish.
768.16s: So now let's take a look at GameStop.
770.96s: And let's do the same thing around a 30 delta.
773.12s: So I see a 29 delta here.
775.20s: These are running an 87.2% vault.
779.08s: This is at a 29 delta.
780.52s: If we could find a 29 on this side.
782.56s: 29 delta on this side is 143.37%.
790.64s: Notice how psychotically high that is compared to the same put.
797.12s: And notice how it's completely different than what
799.04s: I just showed you an apple.
800.64s: And what you saw an apple is normal.
803.08s: This is abnormal.
805.04s: You do not see calls priced as richly as they are
809.16s: on a relative basis against puts in most tickers.
813.12s: This is because the market fears the upside and GameStop.
815.72s: And it's pricing those really big swings that it has.
819.72s: So this goes all the way back to the opportunity.
822.96s: Because GameStop is high volatility,
825.60s: you're going to benefit on the short puts.
828.00s: Because GameStop uniquely has exceedingly high vault
833.16s: salinity on the call side, rather than what you typically
836.60s: get in the coverage triangle on like an index ETF,
839.32s: the calls don't really help you that much.
841.56s: Because you collect a little bit on them.
843.76s: But there's not a lot of vault in them on a relative basis
846.32s: to the puts in GameStop.
847.52s: It's the opposite.
848.68s: You make a lot of money on a relative basis
851.96s: by selling the calls.
854.12s: So this is a really lucrative selling position that, again,
858.12s: is based on the premise that we just want to hold the stock
861.84s: anyways because the short puts are cash secured.
867.88s: So what this means is if the stock expires below my strike
873.32s: on the puts, there are things we can do to manage
876.16s: to avoid getting assigned there.
877.44s: We can roll out and down, which we'll probably do,
880.68s: all of that at some point.
882.40s: But you want to own the stock anyways.
885.84s: And this isn't like the superficial people that
888.76s: sell a put and they collect the premium and they say,
891.72s: oh, I want to buy the stock anyways.
893.44s: And then the stock plumets and they're like, wait a minute,
895.60s: I don't actually want the stock.
897.20s: It's, I'm beyond that.
899.36s: I've thought through that enough.
900.84s: I've seen enough of these cycles that when I'm selling these puts
904.12s: at spots that I actually would want to be assigned,
907.32s: I'm selling them pretty aggressively, closer to at the money.
910.68s: So that's why it's something that you want to hold anyways.
915.96s: The difference is let's say we're using a $15,000 position.
920.76s: Rather than going into the long shares
923.08s: and just buying all $15,000 worth,
926.96s: we may be due a little bit less.
928.92s: Maybe $10,000 worth or less than that.
931.80s: And then get the rest of you of those short puts
934.16s: so that you can capture some of that premium,
936.80s: particularly when the underlying is doing stuff like this,
941.56s: kind of trending sideways or even coming down a little bit.
944.64s: So let's talk about the management plan.
947.36s: The risk in my GameStop coverage triangle
950.68s: is defined by size, the allocation.
953.52s: That means that I would be completely okay and comfortable
957.28s: if GameStop went to zero,
958.96s: meaning my entire investment is lost.
961.48s: That's not the standard for most of what I trade,
964.52s: most of what I trade is way more actively managed
967.80s: with stops and things like that.
970.08s: But I'm using my allocation as my risk management approach.
975.96s: And that is because I know GameStop can go through prolonged periods
981.16s: or kind of just trend sideways goes down a little bit
984.64s: and those can actually be really great accumulation phases.
987.80s: So my risk is defined by the allocation.
990.96s: Again, not my normal, but when I'm trading the coverage
993.64s: triangle, that's generally the case.
995.76s: Now if I'm trading the coverage triangle
997.20s: on something like a leveraged ETF,
999.24s: I normally apply some sort of trend following
1001.44s: different scenario.
1003.24s: So that's the risk management perspective.
1006.16s: Now I do not intend to unwind the shares
1009.76s: unless we're in the process of a squeeze.
1013.52s: And I would define that as any sort of movement similar
1018.24s: to this, where we're seeing volume jacking,
1021.92s: we're seeing price double triple plus at least doubling.
1026.44s: So that means from current steady state right now,
1028.84s: I wouldn't unwind any shares until it is at least
1033.16s: above 50, probably closer to 60.
1035.80s: And the share unwind in that instance is not
1040.56s: to get out of the stock.
1041.84s: It's to realize a profit to make more money
1044.72s: to then sell more puts and buy more stock.
1048.40s: That's the beauty of the strategy.
1049.84s: So it's opportunistic upside unwinds to realize the game
1054.96s: so that I can then use the money,
1057.08s: to buy more when it comes down.
1060.16s: Because as we know from squeezes, they're short term.
1063.56s: They don't last forever.
1064.48s: They actually typically last barely briefly.
1067.48s: So what I'm doing is I'm setting targets based on double
1071.88s: current price.
1072.76s: So double current price starts to open
1075.56s: unwind potential for the shares.
1078.60s: So that's the upside.
1080.44s: Now the next management component is how am I deciding
1084.68s: between selling puts versus buying shares.
1087.12s: And it's buy price direction in standard analysis.
1091.04s: If I see price doing what it's doing now,
1092.96s: trending sideways, this period in here
1095.84s: is via short puts.
1097.92s: Then if we had a period like this,
1100.44s: or it's more aggressively rising,
1102.44s: I would take some of the short puts in
1105.24s: and buy the shares outright.
1107.04s: Because I will make more money on the move as it goes.
1110.44s: So the goal for the strategy is to remain pretty much
1115.08s: always at least 70% invested if not more.
1119.00s: And depending on what the stock is doing,
1122.04s: it will have been flow.
1123.68s: How much of that is going to be in shares outright
1126.08s: versus cash secured puts, but there will always be both.
1130.16s: Okay.
1131.16s: So now let's take a look at the actual positions
1135.32s: as they are as I've pulled them over.
1138.16s: So I started doing this on the eighth of November
1143.64s: is when I marked the shares that I took over
1147.00s: from the other part of the portfolio.
1149.04s: It wasn't really trading the coverage triangle in it then
1152.04s: as you could tell, this is eight November
1153.48s: and we don't actually start with the options component
1155.84s: for this example until mid December.
1158.72s: But that's where we're picking up from.
1160.84s: So and this is just to show you an example.
1164.60s: I intend to wipe the slate clean and start the year
1168.48s: with just the shares.
1170.60s: So right now we have a $15,000 allocation
1176.48s: and the current requirement is 13K.
1180.24s: So we are 89% utilized.
1183.84s: For the example period of where I got in,
1187.32s: not where I started trading options
1190.16s: and actually trading the coverage triangle,
1191.56s: which is 18 December.
1193.16s: I'm using the price from here on eight November.
1197.68s: From eight November to current,
1199.48s: GameStop is returned 26%.
1201.84s: The strategy as it sits as I run it is returned 29.2%.
1207.32s: So several points variance over this
1210.96s: and I have realized gains as part of what I'm doing.
1214.32s: And again, I wanna try to hone the point
1216.00s: that I'm using this start date of eight November
1219.32s: but I didn't start the options component
1221.20s: until a month and a half later.
1223.04s: So this would be much better off
1224.96s: if I use the comparison from 18 December to now
1228.56s: but I'm using from when I got the shares.
1231.12s: So I've had a couple short puts that have come down
1234.72s: for super cheap nothing really to write home about.
1237.84s: And from the call side,
1239.44s: we still have the initial offering that's set out at the 35s.
1244.04s: So this is what the position looks like now
1246.48s: and this is what I will show you
1250.04s: as we move forward and as we continue to manage
1254.60s: and work around the position.
1256.28s: I will be managing all of these as I would
1259.36s: any other trade.
1260.60s: Again, we have 200 shares at 2431
1263.68s: and we have two contracts of the 21 Feb 28s.
1267.12s: We have one contract of the 24 Jan 29s here
1270.48s: and then we have one contract of the 17 Jan 35s.
1274.44s: So that's what it sits as today
1275.96s: and then like I said, going forward,
1277.48s: I will give you weekly updates
1279.24s: on this, what's happening, how it's going,
1281.48s: management, all that kind of stuff.
1283.44s: The last thing I need from you though
1285.20s: is I need you to let me know in the comments
1287.36s: is how much money do we want to use for the allocation?
1290.40s: I can pair this down, I can scale this up.
1294.16s: I want to drive home the point.
1296.00s: I don't want to just do whatever number
1299.28s: you guys think would be cool.
1301.16s: I want to specifically pick a number
1303.60s: that is meaningful to you.
1305.72s: So if you have a smaller account,
1307.52s: I want this to be relevant to you
1309.76s: so that you have an example of what this can look like
1314.08s: for a very basic strategy in something like a desktop.
1320.80s: So I realize that these are these need to be 24 instead of 25.
1325.92s: Those were all messed up.
1327.64s: So that's the game plan.
1328.48s: Let me know in the comments what you think we should do
1331.36s: what's most relevant to you
1333.56s: and then we will see what we can do.
1336.44s: If you have any questions, let me know.
1337.68s: Be an outlier.
1338.68s: I'll see you all later.
